The real secret here is how a novel with so many run-on sentences beginning with an 'and' or a 'but' ever made it through the editorial process. But, it was a fairly entertaining read. And, it had all the hilarious tropes Steel crams into her novels. And, yes, all her characters overcome their various tragedies and Find The Courage To Love Again. But, you really wouldn't expect anything less.
I picked this novel in honor of Bad Books Month (not a real holiday, or ALA-endorsed celebration) which my friend and I came up with in order to challenge ourselves to read popular fiction outside our normal reading habits.I knew I had to read Danielle Steel; she's so prolific.
I had read her nonfiction book about her son who committed suicide and remember the writing to be decent.
I'm not sure if Steel's intent was to demonstrate the character Zack as "turning straight" or that his homosexuality was a "mistake," but it made me uncomfortable to read it.Okay, get ready, I'm about to compare Danielle Steel to Shakespeare.
4.5Esta foi a minha primeira experiência com Danielle Steel. A minha mãe tem muitos (mas mesmo muitos) livros dela e decidi arriscar porque achei que os livros desta senhora são excelentes para serem lidos no verão.Não me enganei, a história rapidamente me agradou e gostei especialmente do facto de não haver uma só personagem principal. Todos os elementos são importantes, tal como as suas histórias e segredos. Tenho a certeza absoluta de que voltarei a ler um livro seu em breve!
Loved these chick lit romance books, years ago. Most I read weren’t too bad and the author is one of the best at what she does.
The abuse scenes were particularly heartbreaking to read and stomach, but when you think of the number of men and women that are going through this everyday, I'm sort of glad that Danielle didn't just sweep it under the covers and made it an important part of the book.
I loved reading this format and seeing how Danielle takes you piece by piece through each person's story and she slowly but surely, revealed everyone's secret.
This is Danielle Steel and I would recommend all of her books, even the ones I haven't read.
If you read Secrets by Danielle Steel, I promise you won't be disappointed.
A very dated book. While some 80's references (Perrier! Giorgio!) made me smile, some of the 80's attitudes, specifically toward the gay community, made me cringe. Otherwise, it held my interest but felt a little uneven. However, if you're in the mood for a soapy, glitzy 80's escape, give it a try. It's a pleasant evening's read.
Words cannot explain how in love I am with this book, I literally cannot stop thinking about it. I have never read a book that had characters that were so different yet fit together with ease. I do not know how Danielle Steel does it, but I hope she never stops.
The most intriguing book ever!
I seriously couldn't bear to put this down for once.
My friend brought it to school one day and I was like, why not try it out?
I didn't fall in love with the cover, and I usually DO judge a book by it's cover at times, but then I got to reading it during the boring periods, and I found myself really starting to like this book.
And the title describes the book perfectly.
Awesome read!
You'll love it if you like reading reality based, a with a bit of a dramatic touch to them, novels.
Secrets, this is Danielle Steele at her BEST, written in 1985.Reading the storyline was so Hollywood, very glamorous and giving you a great insight of all the great pleasures of being rich and famous.Secrets is a great tale of all the avenues actors do, to make their name and their mark, no matter what the consequences are. We all have to make a living.The characters in this book are all a highlight, their stories all stand out.This book is definitely a page turner no doubt.I throughly enjoyed this book, a definitely a ten out of ten.🤩
Detrás de cámaras, los actores tienen una vida que esconden y secretos que guardan. Es una buena historia, entretenida. Cada personaje tiene algo que oculta, algunos un pasado que los sujetan, un amor que no pueden dejar ir y alguien que los hieren. Me gusto que todos los personajes superaron las adversidades en su camino, sin embargo, no pude dejar de notar que la autora usaba mucho las palabras "and" y "but."
One of Steele's better books. Not as predictable and not as repetitive. Having many main characters made the book more interesting. Each character had an unhappy secret passed and each finds happiness and support from each other.
One word to describe this book: cheesy. It wasn't bad necessarily, but it was just too over the top, lifetime movie like for my taste. Not memorable for me, and the characters were not very likable. It was just "ok" for me.
چشمان آبی اش تنگ شد . همیشه وقتی موضوع مهمی در فکر داشت دقیق نگاه میکرد . لبخند زد , لبخندی که دل زنان را برای سالها برده بود . اگر دلشان را نمی برد , مقاومتشان رااز بین میبرد. بعضی چیزها در زندگی ارزش انتظار دارند ................... از متن کتاب
(c)1985 Characters for the film "Manhattan" are joined together and each with their own baggage. If you love to read about sex, money, power this is the book for you. There has not been a book that Steel has written that I did not enjoy.

Now America's number-one best-selling novelist, Danielle Steel, takes her readers from the intimacies and intricacies of family relationships, into the glittering heart of the nation's most glamorous industry: television.When Melvin Wechsler first conceived the idea of a television show like 'Manhattan', he was a man already known to have the Midas touch when it came to the entertainment industry.
And as the viewers watch the drama unfold on the small screen, they may never truly understand that the actors are the ones sharing their passion and pain in the performance of their lives.In my opinion, this book was typical Danielle Steel fare.
The abuse scenes were particularly heartbreaking to read and stomach, but when you think of the number of men and women that are going through this everyday, I'm sort of glad that Danielle didn't just sweep it under the covers and made it an important part of the book.
I loved reading this format and seeing how Danielle takes you piece by piece through each person's story and she slowly but surely, revealed everyone's secret.
This is Danielle Steel and I would recommend all of her books, even the ones I haven't read.

Excellent!!!
I really enjoyed reading this book especially since it was based on a combination of stories and characters. It really draws you into the lives of all the key characters and it really makes you feel like you are a part of their story.
The flow of the story was a little strange to me, and might have been improved by spending more time talking about the emotional development of the characters and less about their sartorial development.
(Fancy way of saying that the author spent too much time talking about what the characters were wearing, in my opinion.) I would have liked more depth from the characters, and for their stories to feel more connected, or at least interwoven better.
The whole narration felt very episodic, "this chapter we're going to focus on this character".
I just think it could have been improved.
Secrets is a complex character study, 6 people with intricate detailed histories and everybody is guarding a secret, except one.
This is a powerful plot that reflects how our past and present situations help to shape us into the people that we are today.
There is also a subtle lesson that sometimes we can think that we are perfectly happy with our lives until something changes, and the change may seem dreadful at the time, but the new life we are left with is actually happier and/or less stressful once the dust settles.
