Oh, Mickey, you're so fine, you're so fine you blow my mind, hey Mickey!No, I don't mean Mickey Haller, I mean Michael "Mickey" Connelly.
I prefer the Harry Bosch series, as the Haller series tends toward long courtroom scenes.
But really, I just love Connelly.
His homework and legwork and writing quality and plot complexity are so far superior to others in the genre.
I recommend avoiding detailed reviews of this book.
There's some exquisitely skillful misdirection in the story, and if you happen to read the wrong review it could spoil the whole thing for you.
I'm on a Michael Connelly/Micky Haller roll right now.
Not to worry, I went to bed satisfied.Once again, Michael Connelly excels in courtroom drama.
I loved it because it was so real and very much like what I've experienced during my many years in law enforcement.Connelly's Micky Haller defends school teacher Lisa Trammel, accused of killing the bank manager she believes is responsible for the foreclosure on her home.
Haller's feisty integrity pits him against a sharp and experienced prosecutor, while trying the patience of a Superior Court judge.
He did an excelent job capturing the demeanor and jargon used in sidebars and judge's chambers.
This is about the worst book Connelly has ever written.First, it seems rather obvious that Connelly wanted a Mickey Haller novel out around the same time as the big screen version of THE LINCOLN LAWYER, whether he had a compelling story or not.
I'm not one that usually guesses the outcome of mystery stories early, but I *knew* that this twist was coming; Connelly made such a big deal about how Haller believed in her innocence that you just knew it was going to play out the way it did.Fifth, I also couldn't believe the way Connelly chose to end the book, and his obviously skewed beliefs that defense attorneys are somehow evil and unnecessary to our judicial process.
I don't care wither it's Harry Bosch, Mickey Haller, Terry McCaleb or Jack McEvoy, I can't get enough.This has everything you could want in a courtroom thriller.
Lurking in the back ground is the omnipresent MOB.The police appear to have a near water tight case against Lisa.
Mickey has been hired to find if the water tight case has a leak.
Both the prosecution and the defence are well matched and it's a real tussle for dominance.
The end is not all that unexpected but it has a real "take that sucker" moment.Highly entertaining and highly recommended.
Connelly's fans and others who enjoy legal thrillers but who have not yet made Mickey Haller's acquaintance are sure to enjoy this page-turner of a book.***SPOILER ALERT*** PLEASE DO NOT READ ANY FARTHER UNLESS YOU WANT TO KNOW HOW THE BOOK ENDS!As a side note, one of the things that intrigues me about this series is the fact that in these books, as in real life, virtually all of the clients that Mickey Haller sees as a defense attorney are actually guilty.
I know that the author is not a lawyer, but if he has elected to write a story that is focused almost entirely on a trial, that doesn't seem like too much for the reader to ask.
I was very disappointed that I had waded through the detailed chapters of trial testimony only to be rewarded with that.Also, I felt like, at the end of the book, the author just gave up on the main character Mickey Haller.
But the big revelation that the end of this book that he wants to to mothball his fleet of Lincoln's and run for DA felt like a betrayal of the character.
Good series! a more dramatic storyline..lots of courtroom antics plus lawyer stuff then it ended with a plot twist..well written (paperback!)
Criminal defense attorney Mickey Haller, ever the opportunist and survivor, has shifted his practice to handle clients under foreclosure.
When one of them is arrested for the murder of the banker who's started foreclosure procedures on her home, Mickey finds himself handling a high profile case that becomes a potential beacon for all those disenfranchised homeowners facing displacement.
Mickey is pitted against a formidable prosecutor, Andrea Freeman, and handling an unlikable client.
I liked seeing Mickey in action, not always making the right decisions but appreciating his thought processes behind them.
I liked the story, didn't love it, but the ending was perfect.
4 stars.
The court room scenes dragged while other parts, especially the end, jumped in time & blazed by - almost outlines.
Anyway, I'm really on the fence between 3 & 4 stars for this one.On the plus side, the characters were great, as usual, especially Mickey & his life.
Right & wrong were constant questions that usually weren't really relevant & Connelly kept us all on point often through Mickey's new associate who wound up standing in for the reader.
As much as I love most Connelly’s series with Detective Harry Bosch, I was glad not to have the dllution of focus be having both on the caper in this one (which was the case in “The Brass Verdict” and “The Reversal”).
One caveat is the excessive drawing out a lot of the procedural elements of the case and the Hollywood ending.
With the success of a couple of adaptations of Connelly’s stories for film, perhaps he is trying too hard to make his tales more cinematic.
This is even better than the Lincoln Lawyer, there were times when I thought it was drifting away. But it all came together in the end, with some very unexpected announcements.As I said in one of my updates, I love the way the narrative explains why he is doing something or even the reason behind not saying anything. Makes you feel like you are having a lesson in law and the intricacies of Court.Personally I prefer the books about Mickey Haller, to the Harry Bosch, stories. The HB books are a bit hit and miss, but MH hits every time.
When one of his new clients, Lisa Trammel, is accused of murdering Mitchell Boudorant, the banker who is trying to take away her home, Mickey takes her case.
With evidence pointing at his client, Mickey and his team have an uphill battle to craft a believable defense.This book takes us from the arrest, through the collection of evidence, the preliminary hearing, a courtroom battle between the prosecution and defense, and the testimony of each witness in the case.
I thought it was well written, though I did get a little bored through the middle of the book.
Tra schermaglie, trucchi e trucchetti dell'accusa e della difesa, si impara qualcosina sul funzionamento del sistema giudiziario USA.Ho trovato un MISTERO.
Musica classica, di Ravel, credo.
Inizia lentamente con pochi strumenti e poi acquista intensità e potenza per culminare in un crescendo fino al finale grandioso in cui suonano tutti gli strumenti dell’orchestra.
È un brano straordinario, vi piaccia o non vi piaccia la musica classica.
E' vero che Ravel ha scritto un poema in musica dal titolo Shéhérazade, ma la descrizioone del brano riporta inequivocabilmente al Bolero.
I think it was composed by Ravel.Com'è potuto succedere che "Bolero" nella traduzione italiana sia diventato "Shéhérazade"?
No surprise to me that this was a 'blow me away' book since I've loved each and every one of the Mickey Haller series but there were surprises throughout this book.
They just kept coming page after page.Publishers Weekly stated "...The plot is worthy of a master storyteller." What does that mean?
Again, since Mickey Haller is a defense attorney, there are plenty of courtroom scenes which I happen to love.
Again, reading along enjoying every word, then BANG again, and an event happens which is a game changer.
I love Mickey's courtroom scenes when he pauses for effect; or picks up his pen with a flourishing hand.
Love Mickey Haller...I want more.
After the last several books just owned me, demanding my undivided time and attention, the latest legal thriller by Connelly was kind of a disappointment for me.
It just wasn't up the standard his last few books have set.But the good thing about Connelly is he's so prolific that within six months we'll have a new novel to read and hopefully get that streak going again."The Fifth Witness" opens with Lincoln Lawyer Mickey Haller falling on hard times.
Connelly even gets in a joke about the casting of Haller in the big-screen version of the first novel in this series.
So for defence lawyer Mickey Haller, most of his new business is not about keeping people out of jail; it's about keeping a roof over their heads as the foreclosure business is booming.
Lisa Trammel has been a client of Mickey's for eight months, and so far he's stopped the bank from taking her house.
But now the bank's CEO has been found beaten to death - and Lisa is about to be indicted for murder...---------------I’ve put off reading any Michael Connelly books for a good while now.
Haller, criminal defence lawyer extraordinaire defends Lisa Trammel on a murder charge.
That said, I may develop a reader's bromance with Mr. Connelly if his books, especially Mickey Haller, continue to be this good.
The hot/cold/tepid/arctic relationship with Maggie still goes on and Hayley is growing up in each chapter.From mortgage to murder, Connelly knows his stuff, especially courtroom stuff.
I love his antics, like John Corey in DeMille's great series, covered in sarcasm.** SPOILER ALERT**Only one question, why are his clients always guilty in the end?
nah.. not for me. although i did enjou lincoln lawyer, but the fifth witness is using the same plot as lincoln lawyer. maybe because i am not familiar with usa justice system making it harder for me to enjoy this book. basically, michael saves the day.
Its not quite the scheming criminal defense lawyer more like a little quid pro quo, but the main story is not about such an overt and clearly use of the system to allow someone to stay in her house while the lawyer gets paid.The defendant has been involved in a foreclosure case with some foreclosure mill.
I liked that Haller was going in as a crusader about it and also being straight forward that all he is doing is buying his clients some time, cause they are going to lose their homes.Haller was really good in this one.
I really did enjoy Haller's "The Lincoln Lawyer" because it does show Haller having to deal with the fact that a client of his is innocent and the guilt he feels because he was going through his usual motions for that case.
I did love that Haller called out Maggie about her wanting to be with him, but wanting him to do something different cause she's a prosecutor.
Il legal thriller è un sottogenere del giallo che va maneggiato con cura.
Deve intrigare senza annoiare e dev'essere congegnato con dosati colpi di scena sino alllo scoppiettante finale.
Nulla di questo accade in questo romanzo di Micheal Connelly che, contrariamente alla saga di Harry Bosch, non riesce a gestire la trama in modo minimamente interessante.
Tra i difetti de "Il quinto testimone", oltre alla mancanza di un ritmo adeguato al genere, c'è anche il finale piuttosto telefonato e non sufficientemente motivato.
Tra Harry Bosch e il fratellastro Mickey Haller, l'avvocato protagonista di questo libro piuttosto pasticciato, preferisco mille volte il brusco, avventato ma umanissimo Hieronymus.
Ending: Feel good but not enough details.FOUR SERIES (Bosch, McEvoy, McCaleb, Haller):I recommend reading the Harry Bosch books in order, but it would be ok to try “The Last Coyote” or “Lost Light” first, just to see if you like the style.
A Darkness More Than Night (McCaleb series #2) McCaleb is the primary investigator, but he interacts with Bosch.3 ½ stars.
The Lincoln Lawyer (Haller series #1) Bosch is not in this.4 stars.
The Brass Verdict (Haller series #2) Bosch has a small part in this.4 ½ stars.
(Bosch series #15) Haller has a small part in this.3 stars.
(Haller series #3) Bosch has a secondary role.3 stars.
Mickey Haller is kind of a quirky guy but somewhere beneath the layers of his person are things, traits if you will, that I can relate to and MC is one of the better authors at pulling the reader in with this element.
I highly recommend this book and his latest "The Drop" which I will read soon.____________________________________________________________________________________________________I just started this book a couple of days ago and every time I start a Connelly book, as a writer, I can't get over his finesse and skill level with sentencing and structure.
I like Connelly very much, especially the Harry Bosch series, and I liked Lincoln Lawyer, which featured Mickey Haller, the lawyer who operates from the backseat of a Lincoln.
This book seemed a bit “off” although it may have been the narrator, Peter Giles, who was certainly not as accomplished as Adam Grupper.Haller has made mortgage foreclosure cases a specialty (Connelly expounds at length and often about the evils of the mortgage industry.) He immediately drops everything when one of his clients is accused of murdering a mortgage banker.
Certainly nowhere near as good as his Harry Bosch novels.
Mind boggling and one of the best courtroom dramas you'll ever read, with Mickey Haller. Lisa Trammel, a jilted home foreclosure client accused of murdering the bank's loan officer. Holy cow this one was good. Without giving it away, I was very impressed with the characters involved, the strategies used in the courtroom and the doubt seeded. It is no wonder why defense attorneys charge so much for their services. If you get someone like Mickey Haller, he's worth every single penny. Brilliant, brilliant, brilliant!! Another favorite for sure.
This, the 4th in the Mickey Haller series was gripping! Mickey's client, Lisa Trammel, has been accused of murdering Mitchell Bondurant, the bank executive she blames for trying to take her house from her. With so many people unable to pay their mortgages, the forecloser business is booming, and Lisa is in the middle of it. The twists and turns in this case, while each side tries to prove whether Lisa killed Mitchell or not, will keep you on the edge of your seat. Surprise witnesses, shocking revelations..violence, the mob, it's all here...Michael Connelly has done it again......
Truly excellent. He really got the pace of the courtroom right and kept the hints in the right framework. I know many do not rate this as highly as The Lincoln Lawyer. However, I think it is every bit as good and maybe better.
I was bored out of my mind for the first half of this book.
I actually took a break so that I could read another book before picking it back up.
I am not a fan of courtroom dramas, for what are probably obvious reasons to anyone who knows me.
However, I will say that once I hit the 50% mark, things really started to pick up, and the last 20% of the book was crazy good.
It's a bit of a long haul for the payoff, but since I'm reading the entire HBU, I won't call it a waste of time.
Reading a Michael Connelly book is a win win deal. Mickey Haller is a favoriye character like Harry Bosch. Another great court room drama. Mickey is intelligent, owns a courtroom, his staff the least likely of characters and I imagine him to be easy on the eyes. If you haven't read this series, give it a try!
