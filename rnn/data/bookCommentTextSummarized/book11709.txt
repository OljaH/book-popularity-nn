Oddly to some, this still stands as my favorite Roald Dahl book.
It's hard for me to pinpoint why, since it's my opinion and I hate examining my opinions too closely, but to take a swing at it:It's one of the least zany of Dahl's books, which ultimately gives it staying power.
However, DTCOTW (wow, won't be writing that again) contains some of Dahl's best pure writing as the author beautifully and at times almost lyrically describes the relationship between Danny and his father.
I think this book very often gets overlooked and I think that's a shame, because it's so very good.
How well do you know your parents?Nine-year-old Danny always lived with just his dad in their cozy gypsy caravan.

How well do you know your parents?Nine-year-old Danny always lived with just his dad in their cozy gypsy caravan.
His father - his honorable, wonderful and loving father - has a very, very huge secret.
I will not pretend I wasn't petrified.
But mixed in with the awful fear was a glorious feeling of excitement.
Most of the really exciting things we do in our lives scare us to death.
I loved the father-son relationship.
The first third of the book simply describes all the things Danny does with his dad - from homemade kites to taking apart an engine.
ENGLISH (Danny the Champion of the World) / ITALIANO«When I was four months old, my mother died suddenly and my father was left to look after me all by himself.
She always likes each Dahl's novel.Vote: 7«Quando avevo quattro mesi, mia madre morì all'improvviso, e mio padre dovette occuparsi di me tutto da solo.
La storia prende una piega inaspettata quando Danny scopre che suo padre, oltre ad essere un esperto meccanico, è anche un cacciatore di frodo.Di tutte le opere di Roald Dahl che ho letto a mia figlia, forse questa è quella che mi è piaciuta di meno.
I am currently trying to read all of Roald Dahl's books this year. I want to start off letting you know where I stand. This book did not impress me. After reading sooo many of Roald Dahl's books this year, this book was a let down. There wasn't a lot to the plot and it became very boring at moments. If this book wasn't so short it probably would have been a DNF for me. This book also wasn't creative. The main character was very similar to the main character in George's Marvelous Medicine, they m

About the book: Danny's mother passes away, so it is only him and his father.
Danny wakes up in the middle of the night to find his father is not a sleep.
He finds out that his father has been poaching pheasants.
This is a dangerous and very illegal activity but Danny decides he wants to do it with his father.
A sleeping medicine that has all the pheasants fall asleep.
Dahl continues with his wonderful children's stories, telling one that has a realistic flavour to it, sure to appeal to the masses.
Able to convey a wonderful story in short order, Dahl continues to show how he earned the title of masterful children's author of the 20th century.
Short chapters foster a great adult-child joint experience and one can only hope that readers for decades to come will continue to be dazzled by the work Dahl made popular in my own youth.
Rest assured, I will soon bring these stories out for my own son.Kudos, Mr. Dahl for continuing to impress with your fluid prose.
Simply brilliant. Read this at school back in the 1980's. What a wonderful mind Ronald Dahl had. I remember how I envied Danny when he got to drive the vehicle. This was adapted into a film with Jeremy Irons I think. Film was good too🐯👍.
Danny, 10 years old, lives with his father in gypsy caravan behind a filling station in rural England.
And while I may not have made the same decisions about my son as William, I can see why he did it and I can feel his immense love for Danny.I's funny how the same images in your mind crop up over 20 years from reading a book.
But the copy that I read and reread from my local library had a different illustrator.

پایان نقل از پشت جلد کتاب.
A heartfelt read. A Beautiful father and Son bond.Another one of my favourite Dahl books Everyone so memorable. Brings back happy childhood memories.
But it is Danny himself who comes up with the most clever poaching plan ever conceived - a way to steal all one hundred and twenty birds at once, the night before Mr Hazell's shooting party arrives!Perhaps because of the different illustrator, or perhaps because it is more of a realistic and human story than many of Dahl's other, Danny the Champion of the World has a different tone and feel to it than classics like The Witches and The BFG.
Before the dystopian hit The Road, there was another father-son relationship hit, but for another audience altogether.This funny, witty and charming children's novel is a pleasure to read.Danny the Champion of the World is a win for the working class.
The objective reality is that they live in a caravan and just scrape by with the barest essentials, yet through the eyes of Danny, life is splendid: he's a mechanic at only nine years of age and he has a fabulous story-teller of a father.
A wonderful children's novel.
Up there with the very best - but aren't most of Dahl's stories?
What's more, soon Danny has to join his father as they attempt to pull off a daring and devilish plot against their horrible, greedy neighbour, Mr Victor Hazell.WHEN I Discovered This ClassicIt came in my lovely Roald Dahl box set, full of 15 wonderful Dahl novels.
As I discovered when I first read Matilda, Roald Dahl's stories can also be enjoyed immensely by adults."Most of the really exciting things we do in our lives scare us to death.
I adored that Danny's father would tell him stories, referencing Roald Dahl's other work, like The BFG and Witches.
Where Danny gets hit on the hand with the cane!*Gwen nods*D: Gwennie, so you liked the part with the cane in the school?*Gwennie nods*D: What did you like about it, Gwen?G: I'm not sure why I liked it.D: So, you liked the fact that he got hit?G: No.D: You liked it because you remember it?G: Yeah.D: Because it was interesting and you're glad it doesn't happen anymore?G: Yeah.D: El, what was your favorite part?Eleanor: I liked the pheasant part.
...Well, actually, I didn't like when they stole Mr. Victor Hazell's pheasants, and when the dad left Danny alone.
Like any really outstanding kids' book it has a lot to say to, and about, adults.Danny has a warm and loving relationship with his Dad: it's a touchstone that gives him a measure for sane and healthy adult behaviour.
But you can't piss on Danny's shoes and tell him it's raining: he knows what ethical behaviour in good faith looks like, and what it don't, bud.Love gives him wisdom, and strength: but of course even the kindest most loving adult is a well of secrets, and Danny finds out his Dad is a more complex character than he dreamed...
This is one of my favourite Roald Dahl books.
It's simply the story of a boy, Danny, and his father, who is a pheasant poacher.
It's one of his least crazy books and doesn't involve magic at all.
It's also incredibly cosy reading.
Danny and his dad live in an old gypsy caravan underneath an apple tree out the back of their garage.
So cosy.This book also taught me several methods for poaching pheasants and trout.
Despite having read pretty much all of Roald Dahl's other books, I had not read this one until recently.
I don't know why.
It was hugely popular when I was in second and third grade, but among the boys, and I had sort of dismissed it as a "boy's book." It is in fact a wonderful, lyrical book, some of Dahl's best writing.
And it's not just a heart-warming tale of a boy and his father.
Nope.
It's a how-to for poaching pheasants.
Brilliant.Update 2018: Read it aloud to the kids.
Kids do prefer a parent who is SPARKY!

I really enjoyed this story. I loved the overarching message, and I loved the relationship between father and son. It was entertaining, endearing and funny. This was one of the Roald Dahl stories that I hadn't read as a child, so it was nice to read it with fresh and new eyes, having zero expectations.
My God! this was what i said to myself; this man teaching his son who to steal from others? but then, some more pages . . . hummm . . . and some more pages . . . My God! this book is lovely, this is what all parents must to read, they do not know how react towards thier childeren, and this book teach them how . . . i love it . . .
I loved this book as a kid and the re-read as an adult did not disappoint.
In fact, started last night and I read it in just two sittings.
Danny and his dad live in a little gypsy caravan behind the petrol filling station which his dad runs.
One night Danny wakes to discover his father is missing from the caravan and this leads him into the discovery of his fathers secret.
But it leads to an amazing adventure and one which sees Danny declared as the Champion of the World!This is one of Roald Dahl's less zany books but still a great.
This book didn't reread well for me.
I'm not sure this is even a reread.
Had this read to me in elementary school along with other Dahl books, but this one I didn't remember one bit of it.
I think I can see why too.
While I liked the father/son relationship and the cameo of the BFG, this book got a little boring for me.
I think most of it has to do with Dahl writing got a little annoying in the book, which I normally don't mind.
I'm glad I visited this book again, but kind of disappointed.
I think this is my favorite Roald Dahl book. I've reread it at least a dozen times since I was a child, and it's just marvelous. I love the bond the father has with his son, I love the drawings, I love the coziness of the caravan, and I love the great poaching adventure that the father and son embark on. Three cheers for Danny!
One of the first books I ever loved though I thought it was a little sad too. I remember it really made me wanna eat a pheasant too, haha.
His father tries to make up for the lack of a motherly figure by trying to instill more fun into his life (my opinion).
We see that his gut instinct was right when he finds his father stuck in a big hole while trying to poach birds from another man's land.
Going alone at night despite your parents' teaching, his father calling 'poaching' an art (while in The Magic Finger, also by Roald Dahl, there was a moral about having empathy for animals and not to hunt them for fun) and then drugging birds of another man because you don't like his attitude.
I'd passed by this book many times before and it never caught my interest on account of it being long and the title not being more discriptive.
Drugging two hundred pheasants is not exactly what I had in mind.
All that crap Danny's father talks about poaching being an art.
Who in their right minds would consider stealing an art?
What's so fun about trying to steal a couple of stupid birds when the consequences include going to jail or getting shot?
If you ask me, this might've been a bit more interesting if Danny HAD landed in jail.
Long and boring, the worst of combinations.
Danny and his father live in a little gypsy caravan behind the filling station where they work.
Then one day his Dad tells him about poaching, and how exciting it is.
I loved reading this with my little girl.
Danny and his Dad are best friends and have the best conversations and interactions.
It's been my favorite Dahl book we've read together.
I kept thinking about how Roald's father died when he was very small and how he never knew him at all, and I wondered if this father and Danny were exactly what Dahl wished he had.
This was a lovely little book.
Roald Dahl çocuk kitapları ile ün yapmış bir yazar.
Bir arkadaşımın tavsiyesi üzerine okumaya başlamıştım ama kindle'im bozulduğu için birkaç aydır üşeniyordum yeni kindle'a aktarmaya.
Geçen gün tamamlayayım dedim ve kalanı iki oturusta bitirdim.Çok akıcı bir dili var.
Ama gerek çocuk kitabı olduğu için akıcı ve anlaşılır bir kitap gerekse de Roald Dahl'in güzel cümleleri ile süslü olmasından ötürü insana keyif veren bir eser.Danny henüz bebekken annesini kaybetmiş ve babası ile birlikte bir karavanda yaşayan akıllı bir çocuk.
İnsanı gerçekten mutlu eden bir ilişkileri var.Çocuk kitaplarını zaten severim ama Roald Dahl büyüklerin de okuyabileceği türden bir yazar.
It’s my firm belief that reading at least one Roald Dahl book every month will keep you young at heart forever.
Roald Dahl is one of the most iconic children's authors of our time.
His imagination spans far and wide and he knows just how to make you laugh and tingle with excitement all at once, perhaps because he was so young at heart himself.
Danny’s story is brave, bold, witty, touching, and utterly exciting all at once.
Great for boys and girls ages 5 and up (and by up I mean all the way into old age!), it’s one of Dahl’s lesser known but fiercely beloved tales.
I thought this book was a really good book.
The movie with Jeremy Irons, his wife, Sinead Cusack, his son and his father-in-law is just as good as the book! Great for all ages.
