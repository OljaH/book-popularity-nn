But this one is more, um, realish?The idea that what happened in Murder on the Orient Express could actually happen...is pretty far-fetched.
And when Gwenda begins to think she's losing her mind due to some startling coincidences at her newly purchased house, and a frightening reaction to the line of a play...*rubs hands together*Well, naturally, Miss Marple sticks her nose (delicately) into Gwenda's troubles, and steps in to help her sort things out.If you're a fan of Miss Marple mysteries, this is one that you definitely don't want to skip.
I think it shows a different side to her intellect and personality by having her play as a secondary character.

سجل يا تاريخ: خمنت القاتل من نص الرواية و لله الحمد و المنة :)رواية جميلة جدا .
You Chose Your Own Adventure!You have reached the end of your story, and it is like so many stories that have come before: a story of a murder long-buried, now reaching out to haunt those who live today.
As always, you read this story with care, and you read it with a warning to the young: do not believe what you are told - and do not open old graves!
Alas, they never listen.
You shall guide them on their journey, and in the end, you will come to their rescue.
But now it is time for you to sleep, old dear.
She has a much more prosaic one: Gwen has actually seen somebody murdered in the same house, where she has stayed as a child – a memory which has been suppressed.The young lady and her husband soon find out that Miss Marple had hit the nail on the head.
Gwen had stayed in the house as a little child, along with her father and her flighty stepmother Helen, who had disappeared, presumably run away with one of her many young men.
I love Miss Marple; she is wise and knows human nature and knows that people can not be taken at face value, they lie. This is her last murder mystery in the series, which don't have to be read in order to enjoy them, but I prefer to see her more in the picture than in this story. She hovers in the background, helping the nice young couple afflicted by a ghostly vision from the past, but she's not really present in the story literally and figuratively.
I thought I had read this Miss Marple before, but maybe I hadn't.
I would have thought the heroine (Gwenda) being both a New Zealander and having the same name as one of my childhood friends would have stuck in my mind if so.Although this book stretches coincidence just about to breaking point and did lose momentum near the middle, I still enjoyed it.
Some of Christie's earlier novels have a sly wit (in this book the scene with Miss Marple and her physician) and she evokes a long gone world of a quiet English seaside town.
But as nearly always, Christie plants her clues and red herrings with considerable skill.Overall entertaining and well worth a read.
According to the Agatha Christie website, it should sit between “The Moving Finger,” and “A Murder is Announced,” and that is where I have positioned it in my re-reading of these books.Gwenda Reed has arrived from New Zealand, charged with buying a house for her, and her new husband, Giles; who is due to join her soon.
Fearing she is going mad, she confides in Miss Marple, who not only believes her, but decides go and stay in Dillmouth to keep an eye on things.Some years before, Gwenda discovered she had lived in the house, as a small child.
رواية جميلة مختلفة الفكرة متناسقة الأحداث والتفاصيل .. كعادتها كريستي تعرف كيف تجذبك من البداية أحببت الفكرة كثيراً ( جريمة قتل كانت تبدو ميتة فيما هي نائمة فقط ) وهذا يأكد حقيقة وهي أن مصير كل الأسرار أن تكشف يوماً ولو بعد سنواتوستبقى أجاثا الروائية المفضلة لدي
خلاصه ای از داستان:گواندا رید و شوهرش جایلز رید که سه ماه است ازدواج کردهاند تصمیم دارند از نیوزلند به انگلستان بروند. جایلز که دارد کارهایش را در نیوزلند تمام میکند، گواندا را پیشاپیش میفرستد که خانه مناسبی در انگلستان پیدا کند. گواندا به ویلای کوچکی متعلق به دوره ویکتوریا به نام هیلساید برمیخورد که برای فروش گذاشته شده و این ویلا را میخرد.بعد از خرید ویلا اتفاقات عجیبی برای گواندا رخ میدهد و او چیزهایی را در ویلا کشف میکند که انگار قبلا از وجودشان خبر داشته. دری مخفی شده در بخشی از خانه، طرحی
اما در صحنه پایانی نمایش وقتی یکی از بازیگران جمله‌ای را بر زبان می‌آورد گواندا یکباره فریادی می‌کشد و از سالن بیرون می‌رود ..."جنایت خفته" آخرین رمان خانم مارپل است که از کریستی منتشر شد.
کریستی "جنایت خفته" را تقریبا زمانی نوشت که "پرده" را به نگارش درآورد، یعنی در طی سالهای جنگ جهانی دوم که واقعا نگران بود در حملات هوایی ارتش آلمان جانش را از دست بدهد.
در "جنایت خفته" از شیوه روایی خاصی استفاده شده که کریستی در رمانهای دیگرش هم استفاده کرده بود، یعنی شرح قتلی که در گذشته اتفاق افتاده و حل معمای آن قتل با نگاه به حوادث سالهای دور و کنار هم قرار دادن سرنخ‌های مختلف.
From there the book follows Gwenda, her husband Giles, and Miss Marple trying to get to the truth of an old memory of Gwenda's.
He constantly talked over both Gwenda and Miss Marple.
Miss Marple though I was slightly puzzled by, she knew pretty early on who was the one behind everything, why she didn't feel the need to tell Gwenda and Giles made no sense.
Miss Marple talks to Colonel Bantry's wife and he is mentioned too.
Things really don't get moving until Gwenda goes off to London to visit Raymond West and his wife and meets Miss Marple.
One of the more enjoyable Christies I’ve read.
It’s also aged rather well given that this is one of the few Christie mysteries I’ve read that isn’t shot through with at least some random moments of offhand racism.
If you’ve ever read a mystery and know how they try to provide you with a surprise-not-surprise through the kind of info they give/withhold/choose to discuss/not discuss/have turn up at just the right moment, you might also.
And you’ll obviously need to be up for a little “...but IS the house haunted...?!?!” sort of writing.
3.5/5
Miss Marple urges Gwenda and Giles to leave matters be but the two set out to investigate, and she soon joins them using her “social network” (the kind there was before the days of Facebook and such) to get introduced to Dillmouth society.
They identify and look up people from Gwenda’s family’s past, meet and interview them trying to pick up clues into what happened all those years ago and whether Gwenda’s memories were all real or mixed with fancy somehow.The mystery/puzzle itself was very enjoyable and I would have been entirely surprised by whodunit (only I remembered suddenly from a TV adaptation that I’d seen some time ago) since for most of the book I was thinking on the wrong track.
إن لم تكن الخلايا الرمادية الصغيرة في مؤخرة رأسي قادرة على مُجاراتِك ياسيدة، فإنها-قطعاً وعلى أقل تقدير- قادرة على اللحاق بكِ.فعلتها!! بعد عشر سنوات من قراءة أجاثا كريستي، القصة الأولى التي نجحتُ -بوضوح- في معرفة الجاني فيها، تمييز جميع رؤوس خيوط القضية وتوقع التفسير المناسب لمعظم مُعوقاتها. مع أنني -وللأمانة- شككت في وجود شريك للقاتل.ثلاثة نجمات ونصف لنقص في إستساغة دافع الجريمة.
Better than the one I read with her salivating over rose gardens, it focused on a young couple who moved into a house and needed help solving a mystery, mainly of a memory of a murder that doesn't make sense.It's not the classic whodunnit with a modern murder, and Miss Marple warns not to stir up the hornet's nest that is the past in the first place.
This extra depth of psychology that sometimes the past is left buried even when it reveals the truth was potent.It's a slower paced novel that focuses mainly on the couple with Miss Marple simply in the background as a supportive voice, ready to pop up in the end to offer an explanation when the villain is unmasked.

كعادتها أجاثا كريستي ... تجعلك تشك بكل شيئ حتى تنسى القاتل الحقيقي في الحقيقه شككت به في البداية ولكنني تناسيت هذا الشك كما تناساه جويندا وجايلز راااائعة :)
Last Marple story.After a slow start, this novel picks up in an engaging way.
Was there a murder?
Marple is present but rather in the background, as as guiding presence, with her down-to-earth, common sense logic.
As always, I am fascinated how events can be interpreted in such different ways, and how by turning a little bit, the picture becomes totally different.
The wrong clothes clue really spoke to me and reminded me of Glaspell's A Jury of Her Peers where women were able to 'read' certain clues while the men just disregarded it.
Very smart.Lovely crime classics read.
رهيبة جدًا رغم أنها القراءة الثانية
I finally guessed the murderer early in the book! Whew! I was beginning to fear I'd lost my edge. 🤔lol!
A young woman friend, TV reporter at US network, was recently working on a metoo.movement/ sex abuse story when, unexpectedly, a situation surfaced that jarred open her own sex abuse as a child; she had repressed the incident for years and collapsed.
A jolt from the past that involves memory and mind is the crux here of a new wife who suddenly remembers witnessing a murder as a child.
The Dame gets into psychological territory (a rarity) and makes some highly personal comments about love and how some marriages work -- or don't.
This is the last Miss Marple book, and I finally come to the end of my journey with the old lady.
This frightens her and it only gets worse when she gets the image of a murdered woman lying in her house in her mind suddenly.
Miss Marple befriends the young couple and helps them unravel the mystery.I think this is the creepiest of the entire series and some of the imagery has stuck to my mind now!
I do wonder if these references were deliberate or merely overlooked.The series has proved quite delightful with 5/13 books getting five stars from me.
From 2015:I started last month to read all of Agatha Christie's Miss Marple novels in publication order.
The first Miss Marple—The Murder at the Vicarage.Novels featuring Miss Marple:1.
They Do It with Mirrors, or Murder with Mirrors (1952)6.
"The world's thickest book (4,032 pages) is The Complete Miss Marple by Agatha Christie.
Through the 12 novels and 20 short stories reproduced in the book, Miss Marple solves 43 murders: 12 poisonings, six strangulations, two drownings, two stabbings, two people pushed to their deaths, one rather grisly burning, one blow to the head, and one arrow through the heart.
Coming to the end of Ms Christie's works, I started with the group somewhere in the middle, so will be circling pack to the beginning soon.
The last of the Miss Marple novels is ending on a high note, the misdirection was in full flower in this story, although years of reading Christie has taught me to think like Miss Marple, trust no one and accept nothing as truth without verification.
She gives a nice bunch of red herrings in this one, and a lovely newlywed couple.
A very enjoyable story of murder, I always enjoy my time with a Christie.
Este primul roman cu Miss Marple pe care il citesc si unul din ultimele pe care Agatha le-a publicat. El ar trebui sa fie ultimul din seria cu Miss Marple. Mi-a placut foarte mult felul in care a fost organizata si ca nu a mai respectat calapodul ala obositor de la Poirot, cu o mie interogatorii. Misterul... cam slabut, dar mi-a placut atentia sporita la personaje, spre deosebire de Poirot unde accentul cade pe mister.
Vintage Agatha Christie. I figured this one out well in advance of the ending, but I still enjoyed the read and remember why Christie was so popular in her time. At the time this was written, it probably wouldn't have been so easy to solve the who-done-it. Christie and others have honed my sense of possibilities. Miss Marple is a very subtle character in this novel, more a guide than a detective. A nice break from some heavier reading...I'm in the process of reading Middlemarch and needed some air.
I seem to prefer watching Agatha Christie rather than reading her books. This one grabbed me from the beginning and I was hooked. It was only towards the end that I thought it dragged on a tiny bit.
3.5 starsIt seemed that, unconsciously, I have suspected the murderer right from the start.
Even with so many red herrings and distractions thrown in the way, my suspicions for the suspect would not waver.
"You believed what he said.
It really is very dangerous to believe people.
I never have for years." - Miss MarpleI never realized how much influence Agatha Christie's books and characters have affected me and my reading, especially for mystery / thriller genre.
And thus, I would not really surprised if the story that I'm reading would make a 180 degree of twist or anything.
للأسف أن عنصر المفاجئة اختفى من الرواية في بدايتها، لقد عرفت القاتل فوراً، فهذه القصة نُقلت حرفياً من خلال مسلسل سوري بعنوان (جريمة في الذاكرة) ، و قد شاهدته قبل أكثر من 15 سنة مضت. و مع هذا شعرت بشيء من التشويق و المتعة في تتبع مجريات هذه الجريمة.
