It is probably the most apropos quote because it hinges almost entirely on the readers' familiarity with and reaction to Dan Brown's novel.If you found Da Vinci Code boring, trite, melodramatic, sophomoric, and preposterous, you will probably have a similar reaction to Blue Balliett's debut young adult novel, Chasing Vermeer.Balliett has stated that it took her five years to write Vermeer, but the central mystery is so lousy and ridiculous, it comes across as the product of a very drunken weekend in an art gallery.
Terrible." Point taken, kids.
I've recently become more interested in Vermeer, so that added to my motivation.There are some things I liked about the book.
The author also tells us quite a lot about the life and work of a famous maker of "old pictures," and if, as a result, young readers become interested in a kind of art that they might not otherwise have considered worth their notice, well, that's a good thing.
The book, especially at first, has a lot of promise.
At one point they try to derive clues from a series of random words uttered by the crusty but sympathetic old lady.
This book may very well be the worst book I have ever read in my entire life.
First of all, I generally hate mystery books anyway, which is most likely a prime factor of my hatred for this book.
Secondly, I hate mysteries that involve children, just adding on to my hatred.
This entire book includes about five separate mini mysteries within one large mystery, so it's like six mysteries which like sextuples my hatred for this book.
Overall, I may just hate this book because of my opinions about mysteries and needing to stop for an hour to understand what just happened mid-read.
The "there's no such thing as coincidence" stuff would have been way overdone in any other book, but I understand that that was one of the author's main points here; still, I wasn't convinced.
And the art history reads as coming straight from the author's Brown BA at least twenty years ago--very old-fashioned, to the book's detriment.
This just isn't the way people think about art history now, and the book would have been enriched by going into the paintings at a deeper level.
Ένα από τα 6 παιδικά βιβλία που κατά τη γνώμη μου διαβάζεται κι από ενηλίκους!Μπορείτε να δείτε ποια είναι τα άλλα στο μπλογκ μας, σε αυτό το λινκ: https://wp.me/pa25z8-79❤Το «Στα ίχνη του Βερμέερ» είναι ταμάμ για όσους αγαπούν το μυστήριο και τους γρίφους.
Η ιστορία περιστρέφεται γύρω από έναν κλεμμένο πίνακα του Ολλανδού ζωγράφου Γιαν Βερμέερ και τις προσπάθειες δύο έφηβων ερασιτεχνών ντετέκτιβ να λύσουν την υπόθεση ακολουθώντας στοιχεία που ανακαλύπτουν.
Κάτι σαν «Κώδικας Ντα Βιντσι» για εφήβους και παιδιά χωρίς όμως να ναι απλοϊκό, έχει πολύ ιδιαίτερη γραφή (σχεδόν λυρική σε κάποια σημεία), περιλαμβάνει ιστορία της τέχνης και η εικονογράφηση του Μπρετ Χέλκουιστ είναι αριστοτεχνική.
BONUS: Εχει και χάρτη!😍
I finished reading this to my 9-year-old last night, then poked around here on Goodreads, assessing what reader response had been when the book was originally published.I was surprised by how many reviewers didn't like this book, or couldn't finish it.
Believe me, I understand the issues readers had with "plot points." Yes, the plot does unravel somewhat at the end.
when it comes to criticizing this book as a "DaVinci Code for kids." Hmmmm.
Whether you liked The DaVinci Code or hated it, you must admit.
so what if it's like a DaVinci Code for kids?
Is that a bad thing, or an incredibly good thing?This book had my daughter scouring through art books all over our house.
I had read reviews that said it was clever, it has expert illustrations by Brett Helquist (Lemony Snicket’s illustrator), and the inside flap lead me to believe it was a puzzle tale in the same vein as The Westing Game, by Ellen Raskin.* Chasing Vermeer is not a terrible book, but it didn’t live up to my expectations.It tells the story of two outcast sixth graders, Petra and Calder, who come together and ultimately solve a mystery about a missing Vermeer painting.
Through a string of seemingly unrelated events, Calder and Petra find themselves in the center of an art heist that has the world buzzing and the Police and museum officials puzzled.
The University of Chicago campus and Calder and Petra’s neighborhood of Hyde Park are the backdrop for this fast moving tale of art and intrigue.
Though on the long side at 254 pages, the story, packed with clues, moves quickly and the codes both in the illustrations and in the text give the story an interactive element that is sure to keep readers engaged.
A belief in parapsychology is a dangerous thing to instill in children because it easily leads them to believe that their instincts are as valid as accepted science.
While questioning authority is on the face of it a healthy idea, once you start believing that people in paintings are talking to you and that the random drawing of geometrical shapes is conveying messages to you - well that is very dangerous thinking indeed.Quite frankly this book scares me.
Do we really need to convince our kids that their instincts are just as valid as accepted truth?
Here is a list of those rants: 1.) So it turns out that in order to be able to learn details that are instrumental in solving the mystery, the reader NEEDS to get out a pen or pencil and paper and decode the three coded letters between Tommy and Calder.
I will say, though, that it is annoying to me that a lot of the "clues" Petra and Calder used to solve the mystery were not reality-based at all, but coincidences and intuitions.4.) The best part of the book was learning about Petra's home life.
It reminded me a little of a Da Vinci code for younger minds, only in some ways this book was a lot trickier.
The range of topics covered is somewhat broad, but they flow together, and while in some cases the thinking behind it all seems highly advanced, at the same time, younger people tend to be much more open to "crazy" and wild ideas than some of their more learned counterparts who "know better."If you like mysteries, puzzles, or art, definitely give this book a read._____This is one of the books I've most enjoyed in the past few years.
The genre of this book is mystery.Its mystery because Calder and Petra are trying to find the famous Vermeer painting that has been stolen.
There are so many possible clues and connections.At the end of the book *spoiler alert* the painting is found hidden in a wall in a stairwell, Calder and Petra run for their lives as alarms scream behind them.
Petra is able to escape from the chasing man but soon loses the painting as she and a police officer search for Calder.
The conflict of the book is person vs person because Calder and Petra are tying to find the theft and the painting.
I had far too many problems with this book to even start to enumerate them.
I'll just mention the one thing I really liked about sharing the experience of listening to this book (the first half) and then reading it aloud (the second) with my son.
It so happened that when we reached the point in the story where Vermeer's painting "A Lady Writing" is introduced, we were visiting my mother's home in Northern Virginia.
On the morning of the drive home, it turned out to be really easy to make our first stop of the day almost immediately.
Chasing Vermeer is a fun children's book, easy to read, with pictures that involve some thought, if you want to put that thought into it.
(I am lazy, I did not.) I have some overall questions about the tack the book takes on Charles Fort and how it veers a little bit into magic without ever exploring that, but hey, a children's book that might introduce kids to Charles Fort?
I'm pretty much in.Note: The rest of this review has been withdrawn due to the changes in Goodreads policy and enforcement.
I loved the book because shows a new level of mystery for me because I liked how a painting was stolen.And too characters named Petra and Calder want to find it they use pentominos to help them find the painting and they find the painting but while they where doing that strange things are happining.
this book rocks, and so do blue m&ms!!!!!!!!!!! a really good story!
fave book from when I was younger
When a famous paing done by Vermeer called A Lady Writing is stolen on the way to a Chicago art museum, Petra and Calder beleive they are destined to help discover where the stolen painting is being kept.
Petra replies with, "I wonder if paintings that float in your mind on their own are kind of like flying frogs or disappearing people." Calder says, "Mmm...you mean your dream might be part of something bigger." This is a perfect example of just how these two sixth graders think.
I'm pretty sure the code is easily deciphered within the story, I just didn't write down each time the author mentioned a specific pentomino.The storyline really is pretty good with a reasonable premise, good suspense, and excellent resolution.
I thought the ending was pretty clever.Ms. Balliett explores some ideas that really weren't interesting to me, and they took up a large part of the narrative.
I think it was an excellent idea to invite Brett Helquist to illustrate this book.
He did an excellent job of inviting art into the book.
The problem here is a common one in YA, but magnified in this book I think.
And then the plot point where the general public rouses from their apathy and gets excited about Vermeer's art and the attribution of possible forgeries--I buy that even less.But I liked the story and many of the characters and would give it an average 3 stars if it weren't for the random mysticalness thrown in too.
I bet some kids would love it, but I bet most just skip it like I did.
It starts with Calder's favorite piece of art is a painting by Johannes Vermeer and Petra daydreams about a Vermeer painting.
Calder's and Petra's love for mystery and anything unusual create a great friendship.
Three people recieve a letter asking for their help to solve a mystery.
Calder and Petra accidentally are caught up in this mystery when a Vermeer painting, A Lady Writing, is stolen from the Chicago Art Institute.
Petra and Calder start solving the mystery.
Mrs. Sharpe and Mrs. Hussey were two of the three people who recieved the letters at the beginning of the book.
Chasing Vermeer, by Blue Balliet and Illustrated by Brett Hellquist,is a fascinating mystery novel that continually draws readers in.
They eventually in the end solve the mystery of a stolen painting ("A Lady Writing") by the famous Johannes Vermeer.
For one, as the students read along they try and solve the mystery along with Calder and Petra.
Also, students learn good team work skills and can model them after the friendship of Calder and Petra.
Children also can develop their problem solving skills by reading this novel.
As a teacher, I would try and develop a lesson for my students that used some of the same codes used in the novel.
Such as, the two kid main characters in Chasing Vermeer becoming obsessed with a work of art which reminded me so strongly of From the Mixed-Up Files of Mrs Basil E.
And the back rather made it sound like a mystery that could have been written by Ellen Raskin.
So, with those two things in mind, this book could be nothing but a disappointment.
I can't tell you how many times I've heard of a movie/book/word/person for the first time and all the sudden, mention of them starts popping up everywhere.
And I could name other such coincidental scenarios whose frequency can be quite startling!Also, it did pique my interest in Vermeer.
This book will relate well to children who feel as though they get caught in sticky situations or children who love to take on the role of being a spy.
This is also an excellent book to introduce for an art lesson.
There are not very many illustrations in this book, thus this is definitely a text for more advanced readers.
However, I also feel that the lack of illustrations allows the readers to create the images all their own, thus allowing imaginations to soar.
This is definitely a book I would use in my future classroom.
And unlike the DaVinci Code, to which it is strangely compared in a blurb, it drags and the adult characters are unidentifiable and bleed together.Now, with all that said, I've never yet had a more enjoyable time reading a book with a group of twelve-year-olds.
The kids were totally engaged and loved solving the simple puzzles and hung on the corny suspense.
The book provoked in the kids something you rarely get out of teaching lit to middle-schoolers: excitement.
I can't wait to teach this crappy book again next semester, and have been recommending all the sequels to the kids.
I really wanted to like this, and I think it could have been really great, but unfortunately the coincidences and psychic connections were all too far fetched for me within the context of an "ordinary" book (no supernatural/magical element).
I liked the kids, the way they were nerdy and both from interesting racial backgrounds, and the way the authority figures were all fallable and the kids genuinely cared about them.
I also liked the way art - history and interpretation - was handled, because art wasn't a subject discussed very much for me in school (besides making clay pots and drawing in art class).
La inceput, cartea mi-a placut mult.
Chiar ma gandisem sa ii dau 5 stelute.
Avea logica, mister si intriga si ma facea sa imi storc creierii.Dar pe parcurs au inceput sa apara prambureli despre vise magice, comunicari tablou-copchii si niste coincidente care tineau de ei insisi, nu de caz in sine.
De asemenea, speram ca hotul sa nu fie doar un alt ingamfat, iubitor de banet, ci chiar un fel de super erou al artei.
Ar fi fost mult mai interesant un idealist, cu principii, dar care face lucrurile intr-un mod nu prea dragut.Sunt usor dezamagita de final, dar cartea in sine a fost interesanta.
I loved Chasing Vermeer!!!
It has lots of art history and mystery.
I really like mystery books, and this is a great and mysterious book.
You have so many characters and events, that you have lots of different suspicions.
I actually had nothing to read, and so my mom texted my violin teacher because I was going to a violin lesson, and she suggested Chasing Vermeer.
She said that she knew I would love it, and I definitely did.
I would suggest this book to anyone looking for a good mystery book that you can sit back and relax with.
One star for Hyde Park as a character as Hanna so perfectly said, and one star for the laugh I had when one of the details of Ida Noyes (Dell) was that stinky garbage smell that always comes out of the east grates. The rest just read so non-sensically convenient even if that was the point? Couldn't. But HP love!
I love it so much!!!!! I love mysteries and I especially loved this one. I hope someone who read my review try or read this book.
