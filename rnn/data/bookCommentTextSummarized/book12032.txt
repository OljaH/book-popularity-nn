Not only was he the last possible suspect, but Tell conveniently forgot where he'd seen his tracks before, and where he'd heard his voice before, he couldn't be bothered to ask Nell what the culprit looked like (because she'd run him off in a direct confrontation), and did I mention he was literally the last possible suspect?
(hide spoiler)]So not a mystery writer, our Louis L'Amour.Still, a great tale and probably why Tell is my favorite Sackett (even if he can't keep a woman from one book to the next).
Only two books to go, so can even L'Amour screw it up this time?
There’s nothing like a Louis L’Amour novel. They may be formulaic celebrations of rugged individualism, but L’Amour was a master storyteller and his descriptions of the West are marvelous. I pick one up every year or so and each one is fun to read. Treasure Mountain, part of the Sackett saga, lived up to my expectations.
Something interesting here if you are a Harry Potter reader. There are two characters called Pettigrew and Trelawney. Did Rowling read L'Amour books?
I love Louis L'Amour novels, however my wife had never read any of his westerns, now she's hooked.
This story is one of 11 Sackett family chronicle novels and the setting alternates between French New Orleans and the Colorado mountains.
As usual, the story is riveting.
However what I like most about Louis L'Amour novels are his cultural euphemisms and especially his research.
An example of the latter: the term dixie originated from the French word for ten ("dix"), which was found on New Orleans ten dollar notes.
Louis L'Amour is a great western novelist, and this story is one of his finest.
I haven't had a chance to read all the novels written about the Sacketts but I absolutely love it when they show up in a novel I'm reading.
The insight into the life of cowboys is fun to read.
I love imagining what it was like to sleep under the stars, to follow tracks, and to be so in tune with nature that they can read signs and seemingly follow the trail taken by their father so many years before.
Another great read!
Can't wait to get my hands on the other Sackett novels.
No man should go down the long way without leaving something behind him, and I'll I've got to leave will disappear when the dust settles. A man can carve from stone, he can write fine words, or he can do something to hold himself in the hearts of people. I hadn't done any of those things, not yet. Maybe I never would.
Good western with a murder mystery twist. Tell Sackett was searching for the story of what happened to his father twenty years ago. Along the way he and his brothers make some friends... and some enemies. I always enjoy reading about Tell Sackett. And this was a good book with a good plot.
Now hopefully the brothers will have enough gold to take care of the family, especially their Mother who will be sad that her husband is buried in one and not scattered all over the mountain which happens when they are left unburied.Tell Sackett seems to be lonely for a woman whom he can settle down with, but that star seems to be out of his reach.
He compares his qualities with his other brothers, and he seems to feel they have a better chance because they know how to talk to the opposite sex, whereas he gets tongue tied and says the wrong things.
Case in point here:Our hero Tell Sackett has two final gun fights, both of which involve him going off alone looking for trouble while leaving his friends behind, each murderous bad guy sneaking up and getting the drop on him, each one alerting him with some gloat rather than just shooting him, Tell whirling around with his lightning fast draw and gunning each one down while they in turn miss.
Upon returning to his friends the final time he finds out they found the gold - which they all were looking for the whole book - while he was gone.
Tell Sackett is back in this book with Orrin Sackett, whose taste in women has definitely not improved.
Yes, gold does creep in, but it wasn't the main focus in my mind.
And there is another of L'Amour's spunky female characters that I like.The true love in this book is the land itself.
From the canyons around the Red River and the Tucumcari Mountain, to the San Juan mountains, you can feel the love of the land and the freedom it represents.Were there some less than plausible moments?
Yes. But fiction is rarely about "normal" life as it would be boring for the most part.
I liked the beginning of this book, struggled through the middle and just wanted it to end by the time I got near the finish. I liked meeting the Sacketts. The timeline of the story was a little unbelievable and the level of detail of hiking through the mountain trails dragged on and on. The resolution of what happened to their father and what might have happened to that gold took too long for a book this short.
Although this is not the last book concerning the Sacketts written by L'Amour, it is my favorite. Tell and Orrin Sackett track down a gold treasure found by their father and learn the history of his adventure procuring the hidden gold. They are accompanied in this hunt by family and associates such as the Tinker. This is a great book. It should be read by everyone, but not until they are familiar with the Sackett cast of characters.
Great book!!!Really enjoyed this book, as I have the others. Meeting other Sacketts, seeing them develop, and sharing their adventures are really worth the time. Reading them in the correct sequence, really helps. Great Book!!!
Great read! I have been reading L`Amour for 50 years and still enjoy every yarn an' jibe! You'll be able to feel the saddle under your "bum" and smell the pine off the mountain when your read L`Amour's books! Enjoy!

The sacketts go searching for what happened to there father, and treasure.
This was my second Louis L’Amour book. I didn't like it as much as I liked the first, but it was still a fun read. There are so many Louis L’Amour books. How do you pick the best?
What else can you say after 17 Sackett books. More of the same easy reading. I've enjoyed the all, but it's time to ride on down the road. It's been a pleasure riding with the boys.
A little slow on reading this one, but incredible book! Really enjoyed it, and the author’s knowledge of Colorado was astounding!
Loved it.
Tell follows brother Orrin, missing a few days from New Orleans and pa, gone twenty years guiding Pierre Bontemps, whose brother Andre Baston and servant Hippo Swan returned.
Tell follows landmarks described and "notch cut with an axe -- not a blaze -- pa never liked the glaring white of a new blaze" p 366 and "Indian ways of marking a trail" p 384.
Old Ute Powder-Face appears "suddenlike in the middle of the night" p 356 by campfire and tells how pa, "good man" borrowed horse "poof" p 357, supplied "rifle ..
Nat tells where he buried pa.
I really like some of those older western writers. I am becoming acquainted with the Sacketts, and I am finding their stories entertaining. Orrin and William Tell Sackett seek to find out what happened to their Pa who did not return from leading a gold mining expedition 20 years ago.

Louis L'Amour's books were one of the few things that we shared a great love for.So this story is about Orrin and Tell trying to find out how their father died and why.
About the first third of the story is set in New Orleans.
Now New Orleans is one of the cities I would love to visit.
The whole family is hoping to find a good ranch and settle down close to the other Sacketts that have moved west.We meet another Trelawney girl and she seems to set her cap for Tell.
Anyone that loves Louis L'Amour books is going to love this story.
Twenty years ago, Pa Sackett led an expedition into the Rocky Mountains to find gold.
Nothing will deter them from finding Pa’s trail though, not to mention the now legendary stash of gold he went to find.Louis L’Amour struck gold with 
Seems likely.I love the language of Louis L’Amour’s books.
Any audiobook that uses phrases like those is okay by me.
is my second Louis L’Amour audiobook.
I like that kind of consistency in audiobooks, and the more I listen to Strathairn, the more I like him.
He fits L’Amour’s books very well.Lovers of westerns will no doubt enjoy 
Of course he got it, then hid it, then was dry gulched up in 'dem mountains, and no body has found the gold.Except Tell.Le sigh.
That's just sloppy writing.Then, it borders on the ridiculous where right at the tail-end of the book, Tell has a gun pulled on his back at point blank range.
The killer isn't going to dry gulch him, and orders Tell to turn around so he can see being killed.
Even though the killer, at point blank range, first first, AND MISSES!
Through several books, we've heard of Pa Sackett -who is never named- and how he went west when Tell, Orrin, and Tyrel were kids.
I wish that we had Pa's story told through Pa's perspective.I'm re-reading this series; my first exposure was through my grandfather reading to his grand kids and this book is one that I remember from childhood because my family discussed the name of one of the background characters, Judas Priest - was L'Amour a fan of the band?
The names of Pettigrew and Trelawney didn't register during my childhood but they pop out now because of JK Rowling - is Rowling a fan of L'Amour?
The brothers never knew what happened to their father who, twenty years ago, guided a group of men searching for buried gold and never came back.
He found out that were two treasure hunters who came back - then he was drugged, kidnapped and interrogated in a river boat.
After Orrin's escape, they were able to gather more information about the route the treasure hunters took.
Tell and Orrin, accompanied by the brother of another member of the treasure hunters, set off to re-trace the route and find out what actually happened to group.

Very good read. Kept me in my chair. All of Louis Lamour get a high rating in my book !  4 more in this series to go. Johnjjt
Overall: another installment of the Sackett family.
I generally love the Sackett family and started the chronological story line as I drove around southeast Colorado and Texas.
The landscape outside was the perfect blank slate for the stories Louis L'Amour paints."Treasure Mountain" on the other hand feels like a short story that had a bunch of fluff added to it and turned into a 200-page novel.
I would recommend this book to: Louis L'Amour fans and people with tons of time on there hands and happen to be driving around Southwest Colorado.
