They’re both incredibly argumentative and both want their own way and they’re always quick to anger and shout at each other and watch out for a thrilling, pulsating conclusion so enthralling that I could hardly breathe as I read it – thankfully all followed by a wonderful epilogue.This is, quite simply, just a beautiful love story.
This may well be the most beautiful love story ever written.I very much enjoyed the writing style and I feel like I’ve been in safe hands – I felt that this story was meticulously mapped out and that Jodi knew from the very first page of This Man, exactly where this story was going, where every character fitted in and how it was all going to end.
I have never been more excited about a release of a book, the story of Jesse and Ava and there unrelenting relationship wraps up in this epic finale and I worshipped every page.Jodi ellen Malpas goes on my list of favourite authors she has two hugely redeeming qualities, number one: she is gorgeously British and proud of it, delivering (and not apologising for) her wonderful British-isms and number two: she delivered to the world Jesse Ward, a character never to be forgotten and never to be created again, so with all that gushing being said here are my over zealous book thoughts, welcome to 'This man confessed' as seen through my eyes ...What's it all about ...Well if you have got to this point and still haven't realised 'This man confessed' is the last book in a trilogy where we are thrown into the world of Jesse Ward and Ava O'Shea.
Why don't any of my friends like me enough to take me aside and tell me to stop hating myself and take some time to love me enough to stop punishing myself with terrible books that I know are only going to cause me agony?
How many people have to tell Ava, "Oh, yeah, Jesse's the most laid back guy in the world," and she's like, "Uh, I don't know that guy," until she realizes, "MAYBE I MAKE MY HUSBAND INTO A MONSTER" and also for her to realize that when she deliberately, oh, I don't know, RUBS HER VAGINA ALL UP ON ANOTHER DUDE TO MAKE HIM MAD, she also isn't being a lovely person when she's with him?- And yet, it's not that I think that all characters have to be likable people, because they don't.
‘To love you.’"What more can I say, about a series that drove me insane, made me pull my hair out, fall in love, break my heart and glued it back together all over gain?WORTH IT!And just like Ava and Jesse...This Man Confessed leaves no stone unturned, no skeleton in the closet, puts our heroes through Hell, but for the first time neither runs or lose hope.
It took too long for July to get his ass here!This Man Confessed Excerpt!You'll find it here...I really can't wait to delve deeper into the intriguing and addictive relationship of Jesse and Ava!!!Expected publication: July 2nd 2013 Come on, you freaking July!

Thats right, I am awake clicking the refresh screen on amazon to see if ‘This Man Confessed’ is live so I can stay up half the night and read it!
Before I get into my review, let me introduce you to my favorite crazy man JESSE WARD, and all his fabulous qualities that make me love him so!
I don’t care that he told Ava to watch her mouth over 25 times in this book- it’s endearing to me.
I am a little sad that Jesse and Ava’s story is over, but I was so happy with how it ended.
Nothing about this book, or trilogy rather, is romantic by any stretch of the imagination.This Man Confessed opens up on the day of Ava’s wedding—two whole weeks after the end of Beneath This Man. As usual, Jesse has gotten his way.
Then I thought, “Who am I kidding?” Next thing you know, the scene skips to the reception, where more crazy antics ensue.Speaking of crazy antics, why are Ava and Kate friends again?
I’m sorry, but that’s a little hard to do when I read a scene like this:
.(view spoiler)[ with the wedding and the couples unexpected pregnancy  (hide spoiler)] i found this book to very VERY similar to 50 shades freed.And just when i think ive figured out the story line, the plot twists in the most unexpected way ....He kisses my shoulder and whispers in my ear.."Baby, you take me to paradise everyday...."-JESSE when all the scorned lovers and painful pasts decide come back...they know Jesse and ava know they have huge barriers to break .But you heard 'trust and love gets you all the way'...
Now all they'll have to do is prove it.I know.i cant say much without giving away the plot,but atleast i can guarantee that ur going to Adore this final conclusion to the man we've all have grown to love..
"This Man Confessed" deserves 5++++++++++++ STARS!!! Wow!!! Ms Malpas you are a GENIUS!!I truly loved the entire series!Jesse Ward will always be in my top five book boyfriend list.This last installment was sheer perfection.We get all of our questions answered in this book and the love shared between Jesse and Ava has evolved so much, it IS UNBREAKABLE!! :)Jesse's over protectiveness with regards to the babies makes for a lot of the humor in this book and also just made him even more lovable.His
:)Jesse's over protectiveness with regards to the babies makes for a lot of the humor in this book and also just made him even more lovable.His need and total devotion for Ava is captivating."You've taken me completely,baby.
To love you.""I need you to let me do all of those things, Ava. I need you to let me look after you forever.""Let me see those eyes." I show him what he wants to see.
They can't exist without one another."Today I met you.This day was the beginning of the rest of my life.From this day I was your Ava, x."OMG I just loved that mural!!!!
★★★★★! This Man Confessed, book 3 of 3. The conclusion of the in-control yet so out-of-control, Jesse Ward’s intense & imperious romance of Ava O’Shea. A whirlwind tale filled with secrets, lies, villains & suspense plus their captivating love!   “Everything that happens between us is a result of the potent, sometimes poisonous, love we share. It pushes us to behave erratically and unreasonably— both of us.”   This Man Series is the intense, epic saga about Jesse Ward in his relentless
A whirlwind tale filled with secrets, lies, villains & suspense plus their captivating love!
This Man Series is the intense, epic saga about Jesse Ward in his relentless pursuit and seduction of interior designer, Ava O’Shea.
Story picks up shortly after the ending of book 2, Beneath This Man. Follow Jesse and Ava as their relationship is tested time and time again.
Ava O’Shea is everything that Jesse needed and everything we needed to keep the story going.
Fan-fucking-tastic, absolutely perfection!**fans self**  Maybe I should let myself cool off a tad before writing this review.. Nah, I'll dive in while it's HOT. Yes, this book is HOT. If you loved Jesse Ward in This Man or Beneath This Man, I will be astounded if you don't fall fan-crazy in love with him more in This Man Confessed. He's still got his uber controlling (even more-so in ways) attitude and his "Ava, watch your fucking mouth" hang up but in this book, he's absolutely swoonworthy. He'
He's still got his uber controlling (even more-so in ways) attitude and his "Ava, watch your fucking mouth" hang up but in this book, he's absolutely swoonworthy.
He's done a lot of growing up and he knows what he wants....a life with Ava and he will do anything to protect what's his.So, when I started reading this little gem I was a tad.....
But it took absolutely zero time being a tad (or a LOT)....
It's very hard to review this book as so much happens, I'm not leaking any spoilers.
Did Ava make me uber upset at one point in this book?
Ava finally gets to prove her love several times in this instalment, and I am glad!
They indulge in all sorts of different types of sex again, but my favorite hands down was the new: "sleepy twilight sex."I was impressed that even though this was the last book, there was still a lot of loose ends that were tied up beautifully and reveals that were brought up right up until the very end.
Now with great sadness, I say goodbye to Jessa and Ava; and I wish them nothing but happiness, lots of sleepy sex, good times...and let us not forget...many jars of peanut butter!
"Our normal. I love our normal, too. Our normal is Jesse loving me so violently. it drives him crazy. It's me returning that love. And it's me accepting him in all of his challenging way." I am ready for you, you crazy man! Well that is that... I can't believe it's over.amazing end to a crazy, possessive, count down giving, variety of mind melting sex giving of a series.  "This Man has thrown everything at me, and I still don't plan on going anywhere. Unbreakable."
It was a wild ride but it was a ride worth taking!Things I will miss about this trilogy:Jesse & his HUGE ...
(or at least the way she is for 2 and 3/4 of this trilogy)Things I won't miss AT ALL:1.
people bitching about editing I want to say a HUGE THANK YOU to Jodi Ellen Malpas for giving us Jesse who *gasps* IS in his late 30s, ISN'T obsessed with BDSM lifestyle & HASN'T deflowered a virgin (at least in this book!)!
Typical Jesse ...
Well done!Jesse, I am going to miss you, big guy!
(Collage by Lisa Jayne because she is awesome)Jesse Ward.......There really are no words to describe how much I loved this trilogy as a whole.
We finally got to the bottom of Jesse Ward.
I was so much happier with Ava the second half of the book.
The first half I was ready to reach in and smack her around and sayBut, she finally came around and I felt she finally gets a clue and starts acting more mature thank goodness!These books were worth every minute spent reading!
“You keep my heart beating, baby. And it will only ever beat for you.” Third book, third strike and I solemnly declare that I am totally addicted to Jesse Ward! Another crazy, heartbreaking, intense book with a few twists and turns. An unexpected villain, who was working secretly behind scenes, will try to destroy their happiness.

5 “What A Crazy and Awesomely Sexy Ride” Stars Let me just deep breathe for some seconds. *inhale*, *exhale*God, this was a hell of a ride.If you thought they couldn’t be worse than in the previous books, well, you are thoroughly mistaken. This book starts two weeks after the end of Beneath This Man, so if you've read the series you know what’s happening. And yes, it is a pretty beautiful part of this book.Unfortunately, it lasts very little time and soon the psychoses of both characters return
Jesse’s possessiveness and controlling issues are annoying Ava more than ever and Ava… well, she just have the gift of driving Jesse crazy.
Not always in a good way.In this final book of their story, we have new “things” happening that will change completely the course of their lives and we start to unravel the mystery of Jesse’s past.
In overall, considering the story line, the character development and just how the book made me feel in general (crazy, but SO ADDICTIVE!) this is definitely a series worth reading.I can’t believe I waited for so long to read it.
**Excited**   Five 'Everything happens for a reason....' Stars I'm struggling to find the words, my brain feels like it's had a work out and my Heart is fit to burst.....I cried and sobbed......just WOW.....this series has given me one of the best reading experiences EVER. Let me give you a flavour.....and share the love. ♥ ♥ ♥  Miss Malpas has given us a gift, the gift of Jessie Ward He was everything we have come to know and LOVE and so, so much MORE!!!!! He's dominant, controlling, strong, pr
Miss Malpas has given us a gift, the gift of Jessie Ward He was everything we have come to know and LOVE and so, so much MORE!!!!!
Jessie and Ava share a love and passion for each other that is physically and emotionally so powerful, it makes it truly beautiful to read and glimpse into their world.Our intense LOVE story develops at the perfect pace, creating suspense and intrigue, lust and passion, and of course some 
♥Miss Malpas gives us a real treat at the end of this book and it's the Epilogue, delicious and sweet and beautiful......Simply Stunning.
They separate ~again~ and that leads to more drama ~again~ but now we have someone who is after Ava. Naturally, Jesse flips out and unbelievable things take an even worse turn.
*It's scenes like this that make me keep reading this series.* Because just when things seem bleak, something wonderful comes out of it.
There's even more confessions and we finally get to know *supposedly* all of Jesse's secrets and boy, are there some doozies!
I love what Jesse did with The Manor and The Ava Wall.
But...my favorite, favorite thing was the epilogue...that was quite lovely and what a great way to end the series!
I love Jesse and Ava and am so sad the trilogy is over.The third, and sadly last book in this series picks up right after Beneath This Man ends.
I almost feel like if I tell much more of this I could be spoiling so I think I will opt out, haha.So, I'll just give you a hint of all of the excitement...car chases, scorned lovers, crazy deliveries from unknown people, of course, Jesse and Ava seem to get in their own way, break ins, admirers that go too far, meddling families, and so many confessions it will make your head spin but at the same time will make everything come together and explain Jesse so much better.
I love how Ava tried to keep her independence from him, but at the same time some of it was just childish on both ends, lol.
4 ish Stars ”You keep my heart beating, baby, but you can also make it fucking stop.” My rating for this book ranges from rating the story itself and a rating for the epilogue. 3 Stars for the story5 Stars for the epilogueThe story starts with the couple’s wedding day and then drops you off the love roller coaster as soon as you board. For the first half of the story Ava drove me insane but Jesse Ward FINALLY won my affections in this final installment, he was adorable and sexy the whole book! S
”You keep my heart beating, baby, but you can also make it fucking stop.”
For the first half of the story Ava drove me insane but Jesse Ward FINALLY won my affections in this final installment, he was adorable and sexy the whole book!
Sadly, Ava is still in danger and we soon find out that that there are three, yes three psychotic ex woman of Jesse’s past/present wrecking havoc on the couple.
Oh and add one crazy ex-husband and Ava's ex Matt to the mix and the story enters ridiculous territory.
Jesse’s past is completely revealed and things get crazy for the couple.
Secrets that answer every single question, and leaves us with an aching heart and a complete understanding of The Lord, The God, The Sexy and Cocky Man that is Mr Jesse Ward.No spoilers from us as per usual, but you will LOVE the conclusion.
I can't say enough how much I love this man!Gitte: So, we start with a wedding, a wedding done Jesse style and we all know what that involves; trampling, controlling behaviour and bucket loads of passion and emotions.
3 months tops...with all this Madness & Craziness going on between Jesse & Ava....~The only good thing I can say about these books is...the first 3 or 4 chapters from This Man were ok...
But she forgave him & blamed herself!!!lolAva is truly a walking door mat!!..I mean...its like Jesse can do no wrong!...she can walk in on him Banging some chick on the kitchen table...& she would forgive him & blame herself for it...lol...ughhh& To further prove my point that Ava is a door mat...
She should have just got up & hugged him...Ava treated her family like shit in this book...I hated it!Her Supposedly best friend Kate...
Let's begin...ONE....TWO...THREE...What a fantastic ending to the end of this wonderful series!!!!Ill be first to admit that this, Jesse and Eva frustrated me at times during this series but now knowing what I do... Everything makes perfect sense and all his actions were somewhat Justified-ish I wouldn't have my Lord, my Sex God, any other way!!!!! I'm just glad that I gave this series the time it deserved and Jodi Ellen Malpas did an excelled job in keeping every single one of us Intrigued, Aro
Ava, the girl I screamed at a lot for her stupidity throughout this series, she completely amazed me with her strength and Love towards This man.Ava finally understood the reasoning behind this controlling, crazy and arrogant ways but honestly I wouldn't have it any other way...These two, no matter that they had to face are destined to be together, through the good, the bad and the ugly...They are Soul Mates to the Core and its quite evident that they are the reason that each other lives, they keep each others hearts beating....
(hide spoiler)]This is still an absurd over-the-top version of the "Billionaire corrupts a young girl" trope...I still wanted Eva to run away.I still find the whole set up ridiculous....But it was a wild ride, and I had fun.I INSIST ON INCLUDING THE FOLLOWING JESSE WARD RANT IN ALL OF MY REVIEWS FOR THIS SERIES.
** Contains little spoilers, but you probably know them already **  He flattens my palms on his chest and holds them there firmly. ‘It was made to love you, Ava. For too long it was useless, redundant, not required. Now it’s gone into overdrive. It swells with happiness when I look at you. It splinters with pain when we fight. And it beats wildly when I make love to you. Maybe I go overboard with my love, but that’s never going to change. I’ll love you this fiercely until the day I die, baby.'
:O I LIKED AND VERY MUCH ENJOYED THIS BOOK.
:PSo let me start of by saying, I enjoyed this book far more than I could have imagined.
I liked the story drama of this book.
because that was just over the top but the whole story drama of this book was pretty good!
We got sooooo many answers, all the answers to the questions which filled my head.This book had crazy drama, and e amazing story *yes, I know..
was shocked myself!!* and a beautiful HEA~ :DJesse calmed the fuck down at last in this book, He was totally less insane compared to the first two books.

Things seem to be going smoothly for Jesse and Ava. She knows she will never be able to completely tone down the control freak in him, but she knows he his trying to be better for her.
If I want to make love to you, Ava, and make you purr, then I will....
Like I mentioned in my review of the previous book, I love it when Jesse opens up to Ava. I melted completely.
End of.Jesse may not have seemed so freaking insane in this book, but the story made up for it by introducing some pretty cray cray characters.
5 - "We're not conventional, baby... But we're special." Stars! Re-read April 2018. It's not until you re-read with a more unbiased mind that you realize just how fucking cray-cray this pair are together. Still loved it though. Still not sure that I want to risk the latest installment as this ended pretty well where it was.~~~ Original review from 2013. I am not going to write a great long essay about this book, not going to tag 100's of pictures to it, and dozens of JPegs, because quite frankly
I keep my reviews spoiler free and as such will just say, if you enjoyed books 1 & 2 you are going to be on Central Jesse Cloud Nine when you read this, Jodi has done our boy proud(sorry to steal him JEM).
I can hands down say this is the best ending to a series of books I have read so far, there wasn't anything else I would have wanted to see, and the epilogue is panty-droppingly awesome!!!
I cannot believe it's over!!! After I was done crying and convincing myself that it was truly the end... I sat down to contemplate the review I would write. First off, I absolutely, hands down give Confessed 5+ Stars. Yes folks, this is another book that I need more stars for.   With the "end of" this book comes the end of the countdown, the sense fuckings, all of the -ish's, always in lace, Johns gold tooth smile, Sam's where's the love, making friends, the mansion, all the women we love to ha
With the "end of" this book comes the end of the countdown, the sense fuckings, all of the -ish's, always in lace, Johns gold tooth smile, Sam's where's the love, making friends, the mansion, all the women we love to hate, and all of the childishness, unreasonableness, and bath time fun!
When we last saw Ava and Jesse they had agreed to head into the love & marriage of life.
What I loved about this book is that all of the questions we had and even some that we didn't know we had were answered.
We got Jesse's full story at the end and while it explained his crazy behavior with Ava, it didn't redeem him completely with me.
I almost feel like I need to re-read this series with this new knowledge and see how I feel the second time around.
I did get a lot of things that I like in my books in this series, but I also got just as much of the things I don't like.First let's go with what I loved.
Also, Jesse kept too many secrets from Ava. In his thoughts he was protecting her but she found out every time and all it did was hurt her.
4.5 TRAMPLED STARS!!!!!Jesse and Ava’s love is……Uninhibited Pure, unapologetic, powerful love. It’s potent. It overpowers us both.  …Unstoppable  Who wouldn’t want to be loved so powerfully, so passionately?  …Unbreakable  Nothing can break us.  …Unquenchable I never want to be without your fierce love.  And then my mind moseys through all things Jesse-ish-the lace, the calla lilies, the peanut butter, the scorns for swearing – and I mentally smile. All of the various degrees of Jesse style fuck
4.5 TRAMPLED STARS!!!!!Jesse and Ava’s love is……Uninhibited
Who wouldn’t want to be loved so powerfully, so passionately?
I never want to be without your fierce love.
And then my mind moseys through all things Jesse-ish-the lace, the calla lilies, the peanut butter, the scorns for swearing – and I mentally smile.
The way he flicks the collar up on his polo shirts, his various smiles – for women, for me, and now for my tummy, too.
The way he walks and the way he tramples, and all of the way in he loves me, with unapologetic raw adoration.
The way I return that love.
It took me almost 4 days to finish this book.
I only read it for a few hours a day!
didn't want to finish it yet, and now I'm done reading...no more Jesse the trampler, the sun-put lover, the lord of the manor, ava's god, no more countdowns....argghhh!!!

5 stars for Mr. Unreasonable, Neurotic JESSE "He's so handsome. I whisper." "This man stops me breathing when he touches me and fucks me until I'm delirious."  This is the third book in the This Man series. It picks up where Beneath This Man left off.

IF YOU HAVE NOT READ THE FIRST TWO BOOKS IN THIS SERIES, THIS REVIEW MAY CONTAIN PLOT SPOILERS*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*This Man Confessed is my favorite in the series, therefore, it is getting 5 JESSE LOVING STARS!So here's deal...
This Man Confessed basically follows Ava and Jesse through some monumental moments in their relationship, ties up all the loose ends from the previous books, and some MAJOR truths are revealed.
(view spoiler)[I thought it was completely ridiculous that she left him like a week after they were married when he finally confessed to taking her birth control.
I can't believe it's over...... The trampling, the sleepy, the retribution, the twilight, the sense, the -ish, the 321....zero baby, the laughter, the tears, the finger biting leg crossing twink twitching sex, the guttural roars, the suspense, the beautiful writing, the amazing story and most of all, Jesse and Ava...... The best erotic romance by far...... Jodie Ellen Malpas, you are quite simply a gifted girl, your mind intrigues me and I cannot wait to see what comes next..... Well done on This Man Trilogy, absolute amazeballs..... I need a lie down xxxxx
4 Solid StarsWhat a journey! This was a nice conclusion to the series. I got to know the famous Jesse Ward a bit more and wow there are so many layers to this character! Bottom line: Jesse Ward is still an OTT-asshole-alpha male that you just can't help but fall in love with! The story had some twists and turns and at times it was a bit long winded, but this was a beautiful love story and I'm glad I didn't give up on Mr. Ward.
I read a snippet of TMC and I cannot wait to know what is in Jesse's head. reading BTM for the second time. I absolutely love this trilogy.
The best in the series - the writing alone was a million times better than book 1!(Even though there IS a difference between WORSE & WORST Jodi ;) )And Ava & Jesse weren't as stupid anymore - most of time at least - so I really loved it :))BUT - the whole story basically took place in book 3 - it's a wonder we didn't find out Jesse's REAL age in book 3 too.
All the build-up to the suspense and secrets in the first 2 books ...
it was a bit much to put the revealings all in book 3....
but still - I really loved it!Now I can't wait to read Drew's story!!!!
All I Am: Drew's Story
...5++++ Lord of The Manor- Central Jesse Cloud Nine- StarsI waited 7 months for this book to be release and it fucking delivered.
I LOVED everything about this series.
At the moment I am mourning the loss of this series and MY Jesse.
I didn't know that I was able to fall more in love with Jesse like I do now.
A few of my favorites: ."It was made to love you, Ava. For too long it was useless, redundant, not required.
I’ll love you this fiercely until the day I die, baby."  ""You’ve taken me completely, baby.
You’ve made my life as beautiful as you are.
“I don’t know how I ever survived without this. I existed, Ava. I didn’t live. Now I live. And it’s only for you.”  What an amazing conclusion to the series!! It’s sad to leave Jesse and Ava but I’m more than thrilled with their HEA. The fights, the women, the secrets, the lies… they’ve faced practically everything to get to where they’re standing: their wedding day. Their love has conquered everything, but this man is not done confessing and once everything is out in the open, will it contin
It’s sad to leave Jesse and Ava but I’m more than thrilled with their HEA.
Their love has conquered everything, but this man is not done confessing and once everything is out in the open, will it continue to do so?What a journey!!
Jesse and Ava don’t do anything half-assed.
I didn’t love Ava in the beginning but towards the end, she grew on me.
One thing I didn’t like at all was (view spoiler)[ how she handled being pregnant, at first.
So once everything is out in the open she makes the f**king rash decision of getting an abortion without telling Jesse.
I received an ARC copy of this book in exchange for an honest review I've added a new world to my vocabulary. I've created it specifically for This Man Confessed. This would be -> Fan-F%$king-Amazingly-Tastic!The This Man Series is by far the best series I have read all year... possibly the best I've ever read, but I wont really admit it because there are other books and other series that I really do love... but right now my newest craze is the This Man Series by Jodi Ellen Malpas!If you lo
This would be -> Fan-F%$king-Amazingly-Tastic!The This Man Series is by far the best series I have read all year...
possibly the best I've ever read, but I wont really admit it because there are other books and other series that I really do love...
but right now my newest craze is the This Man Series by Jodi Ellen Malpas!If you loved erotic adult romance books and maybe you thought that Fifty or Bared to you are the bees knees...?
You don't know alpha controlling hotness, sexy sexcapades and tantalizing angst if you haven't read this series.
5 stars   I’ll always love you. End of.  Jesse and Ava are stronger together than apart, their history has proved that, but no matter how determined these two are at having their happily ever after someone always tries to get in the way. After Beneath This Man you would think there was nothing left to confess but there was more, so much more. Jesse and Ava have had the world against them, there were so many people to talk to, to explain things to, what they had was special only seeing them in pe
