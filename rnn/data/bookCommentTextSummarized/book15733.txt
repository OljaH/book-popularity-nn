OH HELL YEAH BABY.OH.
YEAH.I love this series - which, in case you live under a rock or have been up to this point blessed enough to have a Goodreads feed untouched by my screaming, is my favorite in the world - for so many reasons.These reasons include:- the characters- the world- the language- the precision of the secrecy- the mystery- EVERYTHING, BASICALLY.And this book is standout in all of those categories even in the realm of this series!!!
Lemony Snicket really out here blessing us in ways we didn’t know we needed.The characters introduced here are so fun, and the Baudelaires and Olaf and his troupe are at some of their respective fun peaks!!!

Dear Count Olaf,Sincerly,Violet, Klaus and Sunny Baudelaire
i) It's nonsense to say the oven reaches a temperature high enough to melt metal.
iv) The tongs would cool down during the 88 story descent to the cage.v) The tongs (even if white hot and having a much higher melting point than cage bars) would not hold enough heat to melt the bars - they would simply heat up the bar a bit.Yes, this is science pedantry, but it's also incredibly basic / obvious and Violet would be a far more interesting and compelling role-model if her inventions weren't ...
Another one I really loved. This time the kids are living with Mr. and Mrs. Squalor at the top of the penthouse at 667 Dark Avenue. Creepy :-) There is no elevator so they have to climb the stairs to go in and out and what a climbit is! Mrs. Squalor isn't nice at all and we find out she's a schemer!The kids also get information on their friends they met in the other book. And of course there is Olaf!!!
4.5 OMG OMG THIS KEEPS GETTING BETTER AND BETTER! I think this may be the best entry to the series as far as the first 6 books are concerned. A lot of revelations were revealed, especially with regards to the Quagmire twins. I knew there was something fishy going on with Esmé Squalor as soon as she was introduced in this book. As for Jerome Squalor...why? Just why would he abandon and give away the Baudelaires? I feel like he would be a really great guardian for them. Oh well, I understand his
I think this may be the best entry to the series as far as the first 6 books are concerned.
I knew there was something fishy going on with Esmé Squalor as soon as she was introduced in this book.
Oh well, I understand his decisions since he really wanted to protect them..Despite all that, I love seeing the Baudelaires overcome their adversities under the evil, good-for-nothing Count Olaf.
There's always a secret waiting to be exposed in this book.
Loved it!
I'll read maybe a couple of books before I could continue with it again.
It was a great journey so far.
naive public, but seriously now I expect some intriguing action, something to keep me in a stew, left me wonder "What will they do next?".Step 1: find a human sterotype and turn him into a guardianStep 2: make Count Olaf appear in a very random wayStep 3: find out his planStep 4: Reveal him in publicStep 5: let Count Olaf escape easilyThe End.I have to admit that I love Lemony's style.It is indeed simply addictive but it's worth nothing if he can't make some original stories.

No matter how many times I read this book, I always come to the same conclusion. Esme is my least favourite character that we are introduced to throughout this series. Other than Count Olaf, of course! She's just so self absorbed and so nasty to the Baudelaires, it's incredible. I particularly enjoy the series starting with this book, it starts getting a lot more intricate what with V.F.D. and the secret tunnel being revealed and I love the layers that these elements add to the plot!
Count Olaf's disguise here is very cool too, and even if he is not as present as in some other stories, his presence is pretty creepy this time.
The main objective of the children is to find their friends and nothing will stop them.It's a fight against time and they will work super hard not to fail.This was a super fun read, finally some mystery was involved too, to give to the series a little shake and a fresh new side story.The kids will be pretty busy next time, I guess!Till the next tragedy ;)
داستان تو جلد شش که بهتر و معماییتر بود، با سرپرست جدید بچهها که باز هم در نوع خودشون خیلی عجیب غریبن ادامه پیدا میکنه.یه مورد قابل توجه که به نظرم جالب بود، ترسیم شخصیتهایی کاریکاتورگون و اغراقآمیز از افرادیه که به صورت بیمارگون به این اهمیت میدن که چی مده و هر چهقدرم از سلایقشون دور باشه و حتی قشنگ نباشه، باز حاضر نیستن از مد دست بکشن و چشم بسته دنبالش میکنن.----------یادگاری از کتاب:حتی اگر از یک چیز نترسید هم ممکن است دوست نداشته باشید به آن نزدیک شوید....وقتی مدت درازی است که کسی را میشناسی

I definitely felt the spark from the first couple of books in the series return in this! It was a lot grittier and less repetitive than the last few, (which I was beginning to find a little tedious) but I thoroughly enjoyed it!! I loved that, although the basic plot was still very similar, there were added extras too. I'm really enjoying the newly introduced mystery surrounding the Quagmire triplets and the unexplained discoveries that occurred. This has definitely been one of my favourite additions to the series so far!
به نیمه ی این کتاب رسیده ام و احساس می کنم که باید درباره اش بنویسم.
این روزها بیشتر وقتم رو تو اتوبوس و یا مترو می گذرونم و بهترین کتاب هایی که می تونم تو اون حجم از شلوغی خفقان آور بخونم همین کتاب هان.
من عاشق این مجموعه شده ام.
با اینکه خیلی از اتفاقات ساده و حتی بچه گونه هستن، با اینکه بیشتر از اینکه از کنت اولاف حرصم بگیره از خود بودلرها شاکی می شم!استایل نویسنده رو خیلی خیلی خیلی دوست داشتم و خیلی دوست دارم بدونم که مترجم چه طور قسمت هایی که کلمات رو معنی می کنه ترجمه کرده.
فعلا یه کم از این مجموعه دور می شم و بعدا دوباره می رم سراغش:)
“The children knew, as I'm sure you know, that there is usually no reason to be afraid of the dark, but even if you are not particularly afraid of something, you might not want to get near it”   This installment wasn't my favorite but there was still lots to enjoy about it. The Baudelaire children are back again and as unlucky as usual. This time the Baudelaire's are staying with a couple that is obsessed with anything "in," meaning trendy. This leads to some great satire and some really fun s
“The children knew, as I'm sure you know, that there is usually no reason to be afraid of the dark, but even if you are not particularly afraid of something, you might not want to get near it” 
I have been loving this series and although this wasn't my favorite, it was still an enjoyable read.
I loved the story line about wanting only things that were trendy, including foster children.
One of my favorite things so far that has be satirized in these books.
I think if the book had been just a little shorter, it would have been a better read.
I'm starting to like this series even more. It may be repetitive but there's more mystery to it and I want to keep reading to find it out. So excited to start the next book!!!
( 3.5 STARS )Not my favourite in the series but it was still a great and addictive read! The plot was a little dull in my opinion but I did enjoy the Squalors and the way that Sunny seems to be growing and developing as an individual.
Listened to this and the two before it in one sitting at work one day. This is one of my favorites so far, along with The Reptile Room. Despite the same thing happening in each and every book for the most part, this one managed to introduce some new things and keep things interesting for continuing on. The humor in this one is pretty fantastic also.
My favourite in the series so far.Time for...
The Ersatz Elevator is the sixth book in the series in which Violet,Klaus and Sunny are standing of 667 dark Avenue which is not far away from their own house.Their new guardians Jerome and Esme Squalor lived in a creepy building where everything was decided according to the trend of 'IN' things.
As soon as the Baudelaire arrive they first encounter that the elevators were out, this means it was out of order as well as out of fashion trend.They climbed all the way up to 88 floors and finally reached the penthouse of their new guardians.The only reason they were allowed to lived in that penthouse was because the trend of 'In' was now extended to adopt orphans.
Ένα καυστικό βιβλίο για την μόδα... για παιδιά φυσικά. Το πόσο ηλίθιο είναι να αλλάζει κάποιος γνώμη τόσο γρήγορα και ακόμα και για ηλίθια, χάλια και τελείως μη πρακτικά πράγματα. Επίσης και για τους ανθρώπους που δεν λογομαχούν,δεν υποστηρίζουν τις απόψεις τους ή τα θέλω τους που είναι ακόμα πιο απογοητευτικό...
Quizás este me haya aburrido un poquito más que los anteriores, pero me sigue encantando la forma de contar las cosas de Lemony Snicket y estoy deseando saber qué les ocurrirá a los Baudelaire. ♡
this is the 6th book in the series,where the boudelairs orphans are moving on to their 6th guardian,
RTC
"He's a genius! He's a wonderful acting teacher! And he's the handsomest, innest man in town!""Don't be absurd!" Jerome said. "Ruthless kidnapping villains aren't in!" "You're right."
I loved this book!! Great story!! Don't see how count olaf keep finding the children!!
This was okay...but not a favorite :/ Esmé Squalor is definitely one of the worst guardians that the Baudelaire children have had in my opinion...I guess that is all I will say for now--Sorry, I know that wasn't much of a review XD
Frustrating, although that comes from reading this series
This book has always been my favourite in the series tied with the Penultimate Peril, a masterpiece. 🤩
Reread. Possibly one of my favourites but I HATE Esme.
The book "The Ersatz Elevator" is a book I chose to read, because it looked interesting and I thought the title would lead to an interesting story.
My interpretation was that something hard can actually be easy, if tested.I also thought that the author's style was interesting, and weird.
Also, I got really sleepy after a while of reading third person.
I think this book teaches great lessons, and stresses the meaning of life.
However, I would probably recommend this most to young adults, because this isn't the kind of book I think many young adults read.
It teaches vocabulary, and the meaning of life.
