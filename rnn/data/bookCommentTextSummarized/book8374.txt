Here's the gist of the plot: A little boy named Max dresses up in a wolf costume, plays with a hammer, chases his dog with a fork, then threatens to cannibalize his mother.
Then a forest starts to grow in Max's bedroom.
Read me a story about my bedroom becoming a forest inhabited by monsters, then put me to bed.
No, I hid out under my bed with a plastic baseball bat, a water gun and flashlight, hoping to God that if this was the night it all went wrong, I had the courage to look those monsters in the eye and pretend I wasn't wetting myself.
But I asked her to read me Where The Wild Things Are again that night.
This book is crap, and let me tell you why. The kid is a jerk and is sent to his room without supper. He proceeds to go to some magical place where these monsters live and he bosses them around and is mean to them. Then he gets back home...having not learned that being a mean jerk is wrong...and there on his table in his room is dinner...and it's still warm. What's the lesson here exactly? Hate the book.
Mom. MOM!"My mom whips around.
old for a book like that?"I pout.
"Put it in the cart."--ten minutes later--My mom leaves the car to go put the cart back.I look around suspiciously, making sure the coast is clear.I lean over the back seat and start digging through the bags.Finding the book, I crawl back into the front seat with it.My mom returns."Couldn't you wait until we got home?""Nope." I'm turning the first pages, reading everything slowly.My mom starts the car.
"Sometimes I can't tell if I have a twenty-four- or a four-year-old daughter."I'm still immersed in the book.
I have read the story of Max about 1,000,000 times and my kids love it too. The illustrations are magical and the text is beyond wonderful. It is one of the most fun and rewarding books for a parent to read to a kid (lots of fun making dancing sounds and monster sounds!) and features joyful plot. A must!
I loved this so much, I begged to star in it in an elementary school play.
And who doesn't love to act like an animal, parade through the jungle and revisit their roots!
But what do we love even more...
our family and those who love us.
here's the scoop: I read A LOT.
I write A LOT.
And now I blog A LOT.

Please visit our blog www.twogalsandabook.com for this review and others!I can still remember reading this for the first time in my grade school library. The pictures and illustrations can be a little scary at times, but they still remain incredible to me. I love children's books that are adventurous and take you places. This is one of them.5*****
However, once Max's emotions have been allowed and have flourished to the maximum, he retreats from the realm of the Wild Things and is happy to return home to his room, his waiting supper and his mother's love.I guess I should really mention that one of my more recent rereads of Where the Wild Things Are (in 2011 for the Picture Book Club in the Children's Literature Group) was the first time I had actually read this book in English.
None of this knocks Where the Wild Things Are any lower on the list of Great Children's Literature, where it is #1.It's everything, right?
He starts in media res, "The night Max wore his wolf suit..." I like to evolve the way I say wild things - in the beginning I put the emphasis like "wild Things," and then I switch it up to the Hendrixian "Wild things" as we build to this: 
Max making mischief of one kind and another is just a little picture on the page, but by the time the wild rumpus gets going it's full page spreads, there's not even room for any words.
Like a gremlin crouched in the back of a dim cave, Where the Wild Things Are lay on my cousin's bedroom floor.
That book with its-its things in it called to me.
And what were those things?
Were they, maybe, those things called monsters?
I'd not fully experienced fear before, perhaps because I'd not put a face on it.
Appendixed!: It's Maurice Sendak's birthday today.
Right around the time he died NPR was playing archival interviews of him.
I have nothing against his voice, rather the things that come out of his mouth.
I'm 40 and I'm still learning things from children's lit.
FINISCE SEMPRE COSI'Sì, per fortuna finisce sempre così. E meno male che c'è qualcuno che ce lo ricorda, aiutandosi con splendidi disegni come fa Maurice Sendak.Il film omonimo diretto da Spike Jonze, 2009.Questo libro è ormai un classico, non solo perché ha cinquanta e passa anni di vita, ma per il suo successo e la sua diffusione (videogiochi, composizioni musicali, teatro, cinema).Da piccoli la paura è un sentimento utile, perfino salvifico.È crescendo che diventa letale.Ancora il film diretto da Spike Jonze.Se qualcuno volesse far approfondire l'argomento al proprio bambino, consiglio caldamente "La Grosse colère" di Mireille d' Allancé.
Where the Wild Things Are What's the moral of this story? Some might say Sendack's work is a testament to the unbridled powers of a child's imagination. Others would posit that the true virtue of Where the Wild Things Are stems from the reversal of a timeless power dynamic in which monsters frighten children. In Sendack's carefully rendered world, monsters submit to the whims of children, which appears to suit Max well enough. I assume it works well for other children as well. If you can't convi
Others would posit that the true virtue of Where the Wild Things Are stems from the reversal of a timeless power dynamic in which monsters frighten children.
In Sendack's carefully rendered world, monsters submit to the whims of children, which appears to suit Max well enough.
Max, on the other hand, starves himself for a night and trees grow in his room.
On the other hand, what the hell is this book teaching our children?
At the end of the story, Max returns to his room "where he found his supper waiting for him." Way to be strong, mom.
My copy of this book is nearly fifty years old.
This guy was always my favourite!He looks as if he's up to no good.There are several key elements to the book's power.1.
It shows, graphically the power of imagination.That very night in Max's room a forest grew and grew until his ceiling hung with vines and the walls became the world all around 3.
Even when you're bad, your mother loves you.I can't see this book going out of print.
It's timeless.Join my 3-emails-a-year newsletter #prizes.
But sooner or later, they'll come around.I see quite a few people complaining about Max being a little shit and not learning a lesson in "Where the Wild Things Are." Well, guess what, a lot of kids are little shits.
And I believe Max did learn a few things on his journey.
Even with all his power over the wild things, he still missed home.
It's too bad people have to be so one-dimensional about children's books -- but given the amount of 4 & 5-star reviews this book gets on Goodreads alone, I'm certain the naysayers are way off the mark...
3.5 Stars Small fry was utterly enchanted, and I think we both loved Max’s unbridled excitement. The whole story reads like a love-letter to childish imagination.But Max was also a mean little snoot who threatened to eat his mother and was a little tyrant to the Wild Things... jussayingKid Lit Experiment 2018 #7
It’s as if I’m seeing the world again through a child’s eye.Nevertheless, this is a book worth keeping — for every reading always brings a new perspective, a nuanced view of the book’s message — which I will one day read to my future children and let them discover for themselves a world of their own creation; a world where the wild things are, where only they has the power to tame._________________________Book Details: Book #24 for 2011Published by Harper & Row, Publishers(Hardcover, 1963 First Edition)42 pagesRead on: June 15, 2011My Rating: ★★★★★[See this review on my book blog 
So not my normal choice of read.
But it was a me and little one book, where I read and he listens or pretends to...hopefully we can nail down the 'pretend to listen' game with the kid.
I remember when I was younger and saw this book.
I bypassed it then.
Apparently, I was onto something because I totally would bypass it now, especially after reading.
He didn't do anything but show up even if he's the one pulling the strings.But the pictures were nice.What did the kid think?
*shrugs* If he could speak, he'd rate it: 10/10 would read again.
**GET OUT THE COPY OF YOUR CHILDREN'S BOOK RIGHT NOW**...
then it grows larger and larger on every page, until the forest takes up one entire side by itself...
then as Max sails on the ship it begins to creep into the other half of the page...
getting wilder and wilder until the Wild Rumpus Dance (made up of six solid pages of GORGEOUS artwork, NO WORDS)...
and the artwork shrinks...
until the last page, which contains no artwork at all, but simply the words, "and it was still hot." Subconsciously, your mind goes on this fantastical journey into the extreme creative right brain where there are no concrete thoughts or language, just drug-trippy monsters and mayhem...
Man, I love that guy.
Pues eso, un cuento para niños con bonitas ilustraciones.
My kids weren't so keen on this beloved children's story but I loved the illustrations, although, the story was a little bit disturbing if you pay close attention to what the little boy is doing or threatening to do. Hmmm?
Of all the books I read my kids, and there are many, this is my favourite to perform.It is so easy to turn Where the Wild Things Are into a a big, rollicking tickle fest, and I am never able to resist the urge.
Sure he's being too much of a "Wild Thing," which gets him sent to bed, but he's not your modern kid.
Just a cool kid getting a little crazy on fun before being sent off to bed and a great adventure in his dreams.And when he comes back from his adventure he finds his dinner waiting for him...and it's still hot.Super cool fun for you and your kids.
Se lee en un santiamén... Me gustaron las ilustraciones pero hasta ahí.
If my parents were hard up on cash because there were four of us young kids in the family and their only source of income were the coconut trees, there were times when we had to eat rice with a couple of fresh raw eggs with pinches of salt.
Poor Max got hungry and started having delusions seeing forest, ocean, boat inside his bedroom then later all those scary-looking monsters with who he had a rumpus with.And many of my friends are saying her in Goodreads that this is the best children's book ever.
My son's favorite book! Now it looks like it’s Mr. H’s favorite book, too. Excuse me, I’m being summoned for the tenth rereading...in a row. 😘
I didn't want to add any children's books - but this one was just too cool...Update: Saw the movie - the book was much better!
شوفت الفيلم الأول معرفتش إنه كتاب إلا بعدهاوده من مساوئ إنك تشوف الفيلم الأول انا معرفتش إنه كتاب مصور برضه إفتكرته نوفيلا صُغيرة وفي حاجات بطبيعة الحال في الفيلم زيادة أو موجودة بطريقة تانية بس في العموم الاتنين أحلا من بعض في بعض الأقتباسات في الفيلم كانت جميلة والكتاب اتمنيت يكون عندي أخ صغير أو اي طفل اقرأه ليه بسبب حميميته
‘Where the Wild Things Are’ is a very simple but very effectively told story of a journey through the imagination of a child’s mind. There are very few lines of narrative here as very few are needed – it is the wonderful illustrations (by author/illustrator Maurice Sendak) which have secured the books deserved reputation as a true classic.I hadn’t realised until very recently that ‘Where the Wild Things Are’ was written more than 50 years ago and it’s a testament to the book that it feels so contemporary as well as so timeless, so long after its initial publication.
However, when Max realizes that the wild things do not love him as much as his mother does; he decides to face reality when he returns home from where the wild things are.Parents should know that for children who have not read “Where the Wild Things Are” might be frightened by the images of the monsters in this book.
However, as the book progresses, the monsters turned out to be a bit timid around Max which may lessen the fear that children would have for these monsters.“Where the Wild Things Are” is clearly a distinguished children’s book ahead of its time and has remained to be one of the best picture books of all time.
While I'm not sure I would call it a "favorite" (it didn't completely resonate with me as some books did, nor was it a "cozy" sort of story that I loved reading over and over), there was something utterly fascinating about it...
Max's adventure, into his imagination and his feelings, is one that I think I will appreciate for many years to come and look forward to sharing with my future children, little "Wild Things" that they may be at times, someday.
Ay fue muy tierno. Es la primera vez que lo leo y <3Quiero ver la película aunque supongo que debe arruinar el libro jajaja
Soon his room grows into a forest and a boat on the ocean carries little Max to where the wild things are.
When the wild things sleep, Max is ".
lonely and wanted to be were someone loved him best." So he hops back into his boat and sails home.
This imaginative book will keep little ones entertained with its colorful pictures.
It takes the monsters of nightmares and turns them into the child's loyal subjects.
Where the Wild Things Are presents the monsters of imagination and turns them into playmates.
But in the end, Max wants to be where someone loves him most.
