When you think something is happening something completly different is realy happening, one of the best books in the world for anyone who likes suspense, fear, and mystery, and a really great book, then I recomend Angels And Demons beyond compare.The Da Vinci Code was the book I read right after I was done with Angels And Demons, though I liked the other one better.
The Da Vinci Codes was one of the best books I have ever read also.
Again alot like the Angels And Demons it made you think about what was happening and what was not happening.
Gory,and (spoiler alert)--there isn't going to be any solution until all the murders are committed, so you have to sit through all the gore and you know it.Plus, Dan Brown's characters move through the plot at an unhuman rate...dont' they have to eat or go to the bathroom? :)
i read these books separately, but i'm reviewing them as one because they are practically the same book.
dan brown has found a niche and is clinging for dear life to it.
dan brown is good at giving facts, but those facts seem to just float on the surface of the story and nothing really seems to mesh.
i think his writing skills would be better suited to textbooks with dramatic flair.what i really hate about him is that he makes some great arguments for christianity, but in the next sentence, it feels like he's patting the entire faith on its head like a small child, which is frustrating to read.
4 Mayhem in Paris Stars! ----I REALLY LUV LUV, LUV THIS READ! Awesome!2nd re-read was done with the Illustrated specal edition~3rd re-read combine book 1 and 2...I'd recommend both...because this adult adventure/mystery is awesome❤️
اليوم انهيت قراءة افضل رواية كتبت بحنكة و ذكاء و تشويق , اكثر ما لفت انتباهي قبل قرائتها هو اسم الرو
I read the special illustrated edition of this book and I thought that was really worth it.
I had a clear vision of all the buildings in Rome and in my opinion you really could visualize Robert's quest through the different parts of Rome.
Dan Brown is just an awesome writer.
He keeps up the tension through the whole book.
I thought it was really interesting to read how Robert unraveled the mystery step by step.
You must be a really good writer to not only write a fictional and fun book, but also a well thought-out book.
Dan Brown did his research well.
I read this book after having read DA Vinci.
But I liked this one better than the Da Vinci Code.
This book according to me was ...
When I read the book, during the introdction of the villain character I knew he was the one.
I just knew that he was the one.
Nevertheless I kept reading.
And that was what set this book apart.
The story teller has told a good story in the best way possible :)What I learned from this book?
This book mad me think about people and their motivations.
Things that make people do what they do ...
I know I am supposed to forgive the latter for the sake of a really engaging story, which he can definitely deliver, but it's just easier said than done.
Angels and Demons is built on a very interesting premise (the link between science and divinity) and the historical facts woven into the story are, as always, fascinating.
Dan Brown pays lip service to the idea of God's existence, but then shies away from letting any of the characters actually experience it.
It's a worthy task and the book is a fun ride, but at the end of the day, I walk away from it feeling a little dizzy trying to sync what he's peddling with what I believe.
I loved this book.
I saw the commercial for the movie in a theater the other day and ran out to get this book it looked so good.
It is the prequel to the Da Vinci Code (Brown's other Robert Langdon book) and follows Langdon to Vatican City where he finds himself involved in a huge plot by the Illuminati, a satanic cult against the Vatican, to take down the church.
I don't want to go into too much detail because there is a lot of information that I could give away, but all in all I reccommend this to everyone!
I did not read this combined edition of these stories but I have read both and enjoyed both. I found Angels and Demons, the book written before Da Vinci Code to be a very good read, especially if you like history, mystery and travel. I did not like the ending to Angels and Demons, but really I guess it was really just the last few pages. I felt that after all of the mystery that the ending was just too plain, expected.
I read this book after having read the Da Vinci Code, and both seemed to very similar in terms of the fast-paced thrilling stories that were set in a background of deception, lies, mystery and involve plentiful of surprise turns and twists. Overall, it was an engaging book, can be a good travel companion.
I love Robert Langdon.
A great story; I had fun reading it
I thought that the Da Vinci code was his best book.🐯👍
This is not a great work of artistic prose, nor do I think that Dan Brown is one of the best writers of our time.
And while sometimes the writing was noticeably less than brilliant in some places, I did not feel that my overall enjoyment in the story was diminished.
The romantic plot line was at times unnecessary and a little rushed, but it wasn't a major part of the book so I didn't have an issue with it.
If you have one Arab character in your book and make him a terrorist....
A writer friend of mine told me that novelists often try to include only the details that will be relevant later in the plot.
Dan Brown succeeded at this, having pretty much no fluff.
If Brown mentioned a historical detail, it would inevitably be drawn upon later on.
I'm not saying that he has to go all out, including whole side-narratives like Victor Hugo does, but since there's such a rich amount of historical background to these books, it wouldn't hurt for some of it to just be enjoyable fluff.
، " روبرت " لَم أُحبَّ شَخصيتَهُ كثِيراً إلَّا فِي آخَر الرواية ، رُغَم إعجَابِي بذكَائِهِ المُتَّقَد !، أمّا " فيتّوريا " فَهِي عشِقي الأبدي !
، مِثَال رائع للفتَاة القَوية ، وَ التِي تُحَاولُ أن تتماسكَ قَدر المستطَاع لَأن لا تُبيَّنَ ضَعفهَا للذِين حَولهَا ، مَا أحزننِي شَكّي بِـ " كوهَلر " وَ موتِهِ ، رُغَم إنني قَد كنتُ أكرههُ وَ لا أحسُ تِجاهَهُ بِأيّ شَفقة !
، إلَّا أن جَاء السكرتير البابوي ، وَ جعلنِي أكرههُ أكثَر ، كنتُ أُحسُ بِشيءٍ فِي دَاخِلي فَلا يُمكنُ لأحدهِم أن يكونَ بِكل هَذهِ المثَالية !
Just by chance, I had finished "Holy Blood Holy Grail" when I picked up Dan Brown's book- so I was well prepared for the plot twists and turns.
Entertaining, thought-provoking as well as a darn good read- the DaVinci Code opened the doorway to think about the many possibilities of interpretation of things we may not have ever questioned.Angels & Demons:No one can marry action, adventure and religion like Dan Brown.
An intellectual thriller, once you start be prepared to read until you are finished.
A great entertaining read all the way around.
Robert Langdon, a Harvard professor, finds himself pulled into the mysterious murder of a famous CERN scientist who was -according to his daughter, Vittoria- on the track to using science to prove God's existence through the creation of antimatter.
Suspecting the Illuminati is behind this, Langdon is soon tripping over another murder, but this time- the Pope himself.
Brown allows you to follow Langdon and Vittoria as they're thrown and twisted between choosing who to trust and who to believe.
The fluid plot is complimented by historic settings and spiced with interesting facts that keep the reader interested.
Hmm...the Robert Langdon series.
Like many other readers, I read 'The Da Vinci Code' first, then 'Angels and Demons'.
I remember thinking though, "He's written these to be made into movies", rather than, "Whoa, what wonderful novels." And I've looked through a few reviews of 'The Lost Symbol'...am I the only one who HATED it?
I've read all five of the Dan Brown books now, and I can honestly say I would think VERY hard about reading another after 'The Lost Symbol'.
The others somewhat save him, though, and that's why I gave a three-star overall rating to the Robert Langdon series.
I didn't think I could read that fast through a book, but after every chapter I needed to know more, NEEDED!
I doubt there isn't a person on this site that hasn't read this book but I still wont give it away, all I will say is the movies are great but it's just the small things that were changed for the viewing audience that make the differences, such as Teabing is chubby in the book and he is played by skinny Sir Ian McKellian, Love Ian but that is what I'm talking about, little things, people don't like a chubby person in their movies.
There, I don't think I gave away too much.
At this point these books seem horribly antiquated, as much of the cleverness of Robert Langdon can be matched with a smart phone.
There is a lot of Langdon going to archives and looking for maps that now would all be accomplished with a smart phone (in fact in the latest book Inferno, Dan Brown has to kill or lose every ones cell phone so that Langdon can do his genius thing).
The reason I re-read these books and continue to enjoy the Robert Langdon story is because they make you want to visit the sites lovingly described in these books, so at this point I am using them more as travel guides of interesting sites than I am as actual thrillers.
Mysteries with cliffhangers and plot twists are fun, but Dan Brown tries way, way too hard.
Every chapter ends with a shocking revelation that changes everything, one that the characters find out but that won’t be revealed to you until later.
Meg said, “"It’s like he doesn’t trust the reader to keep reading without forcing you to!”Da Vinci, which came later, is definitely better.
Da Vinci scholars are amazed when a message uses mirror writing.
A Frenchwoman is stunned to find that “sangreal” means “royal blood” (what else could it mean in French?).But they are fun anyway.
And fun to complain about!
Brown is a master of detail and a wealth of knowledge when it comes to art, religion and history.
Robert Langdon is a great protagonist in this thriller.
I loved "The Da Vinci Code" and enjoyed "Angels and Demons".
It is an exciting thrill ride and in depth look at the machinations of the Catholic Church.
I was slightly disappointed with the ending and I also think it dragged on a tad longer than needed.
I will still look forward to reading more from Brown, who obviously lends a wonderful amount of research to his work.
Angels and Demons is a very good book written in the hands of Dan Brown. His series are phenominal, combining both mystery and danger. The beginning of the book starts out with an introduction leading to a mystery of an unkown body. The context in the book is so amazingly thought out, and it challenged me to not keep the book down.
no comment
Basically the Da Vinci Code with name changes. Some of the stuff pertaining to the Catholic faith not very well researched.
Still holds up on its second read. Very flamboyant ending.
Dan is intense !!
But it is a work of fiction so if your very religious or think the storyline is bogus and your going to read it then dissect it instead of just enjoying the amazing story and plot then just don't bother.
Like Angel and Demons it's a work of FICTION and if your going to over analyse this book then dissect it for all the stuff you think is wrong with it then just don't bother reading it.
