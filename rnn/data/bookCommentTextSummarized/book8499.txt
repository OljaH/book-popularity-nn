آن روز که به دیدن گنجینهی موزهی لوور رفته بودم از جوزف کمبل ممنون بودم که حجم عظیمی از اطلاعات را در کتاب «اساطیر مشرق زمین» گردآورده تا من جرعهای از آن بنوشم و دستکم در هنگام تماشای مجسمهها و اشیاي قدیمی کلمه و کلماتی برایم آشنا باشند و من بین موزه و صفحات کتاب در رفتوآمد باشم.
جوزف کمبل در این کتاب اساطیر را از منظر دینی بررسی میکند.
او با سفری عظیم در مشرق زمین به شکلگیری مذاهب کهن میپردازد و رشد و استمرار این ادیان را در نقاط مختلف نشان میدهد.
«اگر تنها یک قلمروی تجربهی انسانی باشد که بتواند
پرستش زن-خدا و کشف اشیایی که طرحی از گاو بر خود دارند و دنبال کرد ردّ این نقش‌ها در نقاط مختلف مشرق زمین او را به این سو می‌کشاند که نقل قولی از پرفسور آنتون مورتگات بیاورد؛ «زن-خدا مادر و نرهّ گاو مقدس یعنی قدیمی‌ترین ترجمان یا نمایش معنوی ملموس و برجسته یا معنی‌دار فرهنگ زراعی دهکده نمودار افکاری هستند که شکل خود را طی هزاره‌ها در خاور نزدیک حفظ کرده‌اند.»اما انسان‌ها شکل بیرونی مذهب‌شان را عوض می‌کنند.
به طوری که می‌توان بعد از گذشتن از این‌ها به این فکر کرد که انگار یک مفهوم مشترک، نوعی نظم راستین وجود داشته که نمود بیرونی‌شان به نظر یکسان می‌رسد اما اصطلاحی که برایش به کار برده می‌شود متفاوت است.
The second book in Campbell's seminal quartet, this one is much more engrossing and interesting than the first, as it covers Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, Tao and Shinto. The East, IMO, is more myth-heavy than the West. I enjoyed it immensely, even though it's a painstaking read.
Really not crazy about it.I remember liking the Masks of God series a lot more when I was a teenager, but on a recent 2nd run-through I found it somewhat less satisfying.
It made me feel unclean for liking Campbell in the first place, actually.Why?For one thing, Oriental Mythology is replete with massive amounts of information and anecdotes concerning various Eastern religions, but Campbell makes it quite clear where his personal judgments reside.
Note: This is also the volume where I invented the Joseph Campbell Masks of God drinking game.
The knowledge that Campbell pours out is relentless for the entire 516 pages, but at the same time it is captivating to explore the development of ancient mythology and religion and civilization beginning with Central Asia (what is currently known as the Middle East), then to ancient India, then progressing to China and finally to Japan, ending briefly with Tibet.In Chapter One, ''The Dialogue in Myth of East and West,'' Campbell explains how primitive belief of men who believed kings were in fact gods in flesh (found and explored in Campbell's Volume I, Primitive Mythology) is now becoming altered and slightly changed.
From the beginning I liked Oriental Mythology quite a bit more than the first volume Primitive Mythology, even if like that first book, it could be rather dry and scholarly and somewhat rambling in its arguments.
Although Campbell also mentions the idea of another strain in Western mythology distinct from the monotheistic "People of the Book." The Greek idea of theology as poetry and play rather than dogmatic scripture, and the Greeks in the conflict between Man and God are on Man's side--as encapsulated in the myth of Prometheus.
Easily my favorite so far of Campbell's books. While at times it was hard to read due to references to other studies I over all found the book a great read and very informative. I decided to read it with the hopes of learning more about oriental proto-myth and belief systems and this book more then met that goal. I would suggest the Masks of God series to anyone interested in various cultures and how their respective faiths influence that culture.
I love everything ever penned by Campbell-highly recommend! Like Bettelheim with European fairy tales, Campbell delves into the ways folktales used to act as cautionary illustrations to channel human behavior. This would be morality based on the way society actually functions, not on church teachings about how the world should be. Younger readers may not grasp how fabulous Campbell’s worldview first appeared because now it is so thoroughly believed, used, and imitated. But writers take note: His books are Number One on the syllabus for Hollywood Screenwriting 101. Everyone working in the arts or education—or anyone human—should read Campbell.
In graduate school, when I asked my beloved mentor, Freudian/Lacanian David Wagenknecht about Carl Jung, his response was, "I dunno: a little too Joseph Campbell for me." There is no better or smarter human on earth than David and so I didn't read either Jung (who I worship) or Campbell (who I now really, really love) for many years.
I think the wait was just fine for me (sorry Dave) but I know I will be reading at least Campbell's Masks of God for the rest of my life (and perhaps also his Skeleton's Key to Finnegans Wake at least twice more).
I love these four books.
I loved that it started with the idea of the "eternal return".He had me right away with that.The inf

As with the first volume, Primitive Mythology, this is probably at least my second time reading this book. Over the years of reading Campbell's works, I am gradually absorbing and comprehending more and more of his train of thought. This is truly a remarkable set of books. On to Occidental Mythology! --From A Reader's Journal, by d r melbie.

Second in a set of 4 works. All of which are an indispensible resource if you have any ambition to understand Mythology and comparative religion.
Everyone interested in cultural differences and cultural history should read Joseph Campbell. His insights into the foundational differences in world cultures are essential knowledge.
Bill Moyers summarizes this passage from Oriental Mythology in his introduction of Campbell in The Power of Myth (an audio collection of interviews which I finished around the same time).
And our friend the sociologist said to his friend the Shinto priest, "You know, I've now been to a number of the Shinto shrines and I've seen quite a few rites, and I've read about it, thought about it; but you know, I don't get the ideology.
"We do not have theology.We dance."For Moyers, Campbell's life epitomized the idea of the dance.
Then a time came when the mass evolved spirit, spirit evolved form, form evolved life.
I wasn't impressed by Oriental Mythology.I was hoping this book would provide a clear overview of the ideas in Oriental Mythology, while placing the myths of the orient in an overall context of world mythology.
Yet, as the book goes on, it becomes bogged down in meticulous retellings of myth such that the book loses the forest for the trees.For example, Campbell retells the entire story of the Buddha's life and enlightenment.
The book is long-winded in its inclusion of myths, but doesn't include enough discussion of the implications of its examples.As much as I was disappointed by this volume, I still have the highest respect for Campbell and will probably go on to read the other three books in the Masks of God series.
The evolutions of Buddhism as it moved from India northeastward through China and finally to Japan was the most interesting part of the book for me.
One of the earlier impressions I had of Campbell, that he favored Eastern religions over Western, was overturned by reading this book.
Throughout he holds up the Western hero's journey, with its emphasis on autonomy and worldly engagement as preferable to Eastern detachment.
Perhaps the final volume on Creative Mythology will present some answers and a summative statement on the relative merits of each mythological system.

this book (probably series) is not meant to be a quick read.
Campbell's book definitely went infinitely beyond any classes I had in religion or Oriental studies.
the narration, however, is surprisingly light-hearted and even humorous at times.I picked this volume up on recommendation of my friend (who is a religion major) and thought it would be a quick read, but I was definitely wrong.
I will admit I skipped a few sections just because I didn't find them relevant to what I wanted to learn, hence I am not rating this book yet and will probably return to Oriental Mythology at a later time.
A classic reference book for anyone interested in mythology, this volume of The Masks of God covers Oriental Mythology.
This is not an easy read but something for the student of classics, mythology or religion.
It's an important book not only because it is so well-written and from the point of view of such a great scholar but it is also one of the few comprehensive studies of mythology.
You may not agree with all of Campbell's assertions but if you enjoy delving deeper into the meaning of symbols and mythology this is a great book to have as reference.
Part 2 of Campbell's massive 4 volume "Masks of God" series.
Campbell's long-windedness is trying at times, but his lucid explanations of the origins of Eastern religions and philosophies more than make up for it.
My only real disappointment with the book is that last chapter, "Tibet: Buddha and the New Happiness", is less about Tibetan Buddhism (as one might expect) and more like a detailed laundry list of the atrocities committed by the invading Chinese Communists in the 1950s.
That being said, I still feel that the book deserves a full 5 stars for Campbell's remarkable scholarship in chronicling over 5000 years of human religious thought.
Overall, I found this an engaging and enjoyable read. There are obviously some areas that are a bit out of date and the author has some definite biases -- he doesn't like the Chinese traditions and he does seem to highlight the most titillating aspects of various mythologies whenever possible -- but his approach is generally pretty open-minded. I'm looking forward to reading more in this sequence. (And if you're looking for an overview of Chinese religious traditions that focus less on brutality and more on the positive aspects, try Prothero's God is Not One.
This was harder and more academic going than I expected, and there was a lot of discussion of pottery shards and glazes and scraps of papyrus. However, that made for a good solid archaeological foundation for the discussions of the evolution of mythological and religious thinking in the East. Some of the language choices are dated, but Campbell has a very even-handed approach to Eastern and Western philosophy, able to see and explain the strengths and weaknesses of both clearly and humanely. His discussions of Japanese Buddhism and Shintoism were especially enjoyable.
It is impressive how easily Joseph Campbell distills the history and impact of myth down into something manageable that gives the reader a true sense of how we have become who we are as humans, but still leaves enough unsaid to keep our interest and desire to learn more active. That being said, the chapters on Japan and Tibet could have had so much more added to them. However, the basic break between Eastern and Western philosophy and the resulting lifestyle is eloquently portrayed.
ok, read most of this on the break before the last residency, still have two chapters to read and probably won't get the chance before school starts again, but it is really brilliant, so much so i carried it with me all the way up north. people are the same all over the world and have been since before we learned how to write. we are bloody-thirsty bastard who love each other deeply. this is what i already knew, but campbell confirms it with research. deep research.
As the other books of this series, this book is full of precise details, super comparisons, and funny anecdotes. Naturally one can find the sections one is not so interested a bit tiresome, but overall i really enjoyed this and learned a lot. I enjoy the way Campbell brings together the main themes of different cultures. The mythological history of the humankind seems to be in details different but in big picture the same. Of course.
Inevitabilmente sintetico a dispetto della mole, perchÃ© copre una varietÃ  di temi incredibile. Un'ottima sintesi, per nulla superficiale. La parte finale (l'ultimo capitolo) lascia quel sapore di differenza fra gli intellettuali di un tempo (come Campbell) e quelli di oggi che rinunciano a collegare il loro lavoro accademico ad un messaggio morale. Bello.
All the Joseph Campbell books scratch a really deep itch to understand your favorite stories in the grand context of the history of humanity. I haven't ventured past The Power of Myth, but I'm especially excited to challenge my preconceptions with some of the non western myths he discusses.
An extremely in-depth historical survey, this series is drier than many of Campbell's more popular books such as "Hero of a Thousand Faces" or "Myths to Live By". Heavier on archaeological and mythological inventory than on storytelling.
Informative and often horrifying, but one cannot help reflecting that it takes fringe practices rather than mainstream philosophy of a great culture - perhaps more than one - and such portrayals can make anything at all look ugly.
