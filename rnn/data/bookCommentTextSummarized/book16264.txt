By far the weakest book in this trilogy---finished it because it was a library book and I had come this far already, but it was truly a bloated, over-written, melodramatic finish to a series that portrayed a compelling story, clumsily told.
A lot of the conversations he relates seem overly scripted to me, and the melodrama lessens the impact of Pelzer's otherwise compelling tale.
I respect Pelzer as a person for making something out of a life that had among the humblest of beginnings, but I was glad to see the end of this memoir trilogy.No significant errors in the e-version I read.

I really do love all three of these books, but there WERE some things that started to bother me by the end of this one.
I am a huge fan of dialog but I couldn't get past how hokey it was at times to feel like we're expected to believe that every word is fact.
I think that was a good step for him.
This was definitely the end of the bad things and the beginning of the good things, and it's nice to have some closure after the first two books.
(19/85) 5 stars *****How can you even begin to rate out of 5 the story of this guy's life anyway?
It's not doable and I still don't understand how he so successfully came out the other side of his abusive childhood and made so much of his life AND forgave both his parents as well!
He really is living proof that the cycle of child abuse can be stopped and that victims can live a healthy, fulfilling life of their own.
As he so succinctly puts it -'Life is what you make it.'
Several times, he came close to losing his life or suffering permanent damage.
For a young boy who lived most of his life struggling to survive in his own home, it was hard to adjust to a life that everyone takes for granted.All the way through to adulthood, his life was wrought with stumbling blocks but he managed to stay strong and even earned recognition from his country and the world for his achievements and his work to prevent child abuse.At times, he comes across as whiney and sometimes martyr-like.
Although it is clear from his books that both his parents were alcoholics, and that his mother may have in turn been abused somewhat by her mother, it's still hard to find justification for his mother's actions (and his father's extreme passivity)--if I were him, I don't know that I would have been able to forgive her (which he, in fact, never did do to her face--he just told her to "go in peace").
These are difficult books, in the sense of wading through horrific experiences of childhood abuse, but inspirational ones at the same time.

I know this is terrible to say, but I was super frustrated by this book.
I'm sorry - I know Dave had a terrible life (controversy aside), and that he suffered more than any child should ever have to, but I still couldn't get over his attitude as he got older.So I'm heartless, maybe.
But there was a clear movement from memories of horrors from his youth to accounts of how his adult life was too tough and altogether unfair to live through.At least he was given a chance!
I think it's a little rich of him to claim the book is about forgiveness: he clearly hasn't forgiven his mother at all for the abuse she handed out when he was a child, nor has he forgiven the foster care system that didn't give him the attention he needed.Yes, there's one thing to be said for needing to have your story told.
I think he milked his opportunity to keep writing, and should have stopped at the first book, or at least culled this one a little.

I haven't read The Lost Boy, and skipped straight ahead to this book in the Dave Pelzer series because my mother didn't have the second book in her collection.
I still haven't read The Lost Boy and I fully intend to reread the whole series this year.
Every time I think back on this book, I tear up a tiny bit, smiling because he made it.As a person who had to suffer through abuse in my childhood, and right up to when I was eighteen before I moved out, Pelzer is an idol.
The book I read about was a boy who had been in an abusive home.
The main characters would be Dave and his mother, along with Dave’s foster parents.
Mother would make Dave lie and lie to the nurse so she wouldn't get in trouble.
Father ended up moving out and mother would still beat him.
None of the other boys got beat besides Dave.
When Dave went to a foster home , he ended up going to high school doing good , but dropped out because of math.
I thought this was a very good book.
To tell children that only determination and hard work will get them through, is putting responsibility on them instead of the adults that should be taking care of them.I would have loved to hear more about Dave's relationship with his brothers after their mother died.
From where I'm sitting, the Finnish system of providing long-term homes for every child in foster care and after-care up to the age of 21 just seems superior in every way.A very sad book with a questionable message of self-reliance, success and "just getting over it".
"A man named Dave" was a fantastic story that talked about survival, forgiveness, love, confusion, and pain.
He escaped his brutal life at twelve years old, and enrolled into foster.
At twenty years old he enlisted in the United States Air force, and applied to become a firefighter in honor of his sick father.
While still enlisted he met a woman named Patsy, who he married, and had a child with.
He started to write a book about his life.
While working on his inspiring story, he interferes with a woman named Marsha.
The story is inspiring, he is a advocate, a husband, and a father.
I knew what to expect when I first picked up this book and begun reading it.
I remember awhile back I read Dave Pelzer's other books of him as child going through extreme levels of child abuse from his psychotic mother.
"A man Named Dave" had a different feel and tone then the two other books he wrote about his childhood.
This book had a different tone then the other books he wrote because the other stories had more fear in it since Dave was just a child and was completely helpless.
This is a great story along with the other two books he wrote.
The third and last book of Dave Pelzer's retelling of his experiences as he searched his way to recovery and total forgiveness.
He knows he cannot change his past but he must do something to vindicate himself especially his mother...
and father.
He will learn this the hard way and he will become a father himself.
More than forgiveness, this novel brings hope to those who are suffering similar child abuse traumas.Along one's road to recovery are people who will make you feel right about yourself, notwithstanding your dark past.
There are good people and people who had it worse in the past don't necessarily have to be wicked.
In the book there is a boy name david, but his family referrs him to "it".
As he grows older, from being tortured and constantly beaten he tries to find whats right for him when he escapes from the house he lived at all his life.
From bouncing around from foster home to foster home, he starts to better himself as a person and tries to escape the traumatizing life he once had.I rated this book 5 stars because it was a really intreiging book.
I would recommend this book because it is very senitmental and could help others who went through this or something similar to what David did.
Dave Pelzer’s childhood was one of unspeakable abuse at the hands of his mother.
His first two books went into more detail on his childhood, but it had been years since I read them.
This book is about the man Dave became and how he overcame everything that happened to him.
It is a powerful memoir about a man who refused to let his past rule him.
Today his is a motivational speaker and works with youth to help them get past their own demons.
Although it was about a terrible subject, I thought the book was interesting and moved fast.
Very good writing about the self improvement. Every sentences of the book might have encouraged the people who needed real help. Appreciate Dave and his wife for their services to foster children. I really appreciate Marsha, Dave's wife who believed him and encouraged him for his services. I really feel very good about the man and every area should have a man like Dave who helps others with his real experience he faced in his past. And I recommend this book for all who frustrated because of their past life.
What an amazing journey! A little boy who lived through such an extraordinary experience, treated so brutally by his own mother, the woman who at one time adored and loved him, and how he walked away a better and stronger person. A person who went on to help others in similar situations. His strength and determination helped him repair the damage done to him and gave him strength to grow as an individual.
This book was as touching as all the rest. I especially liked the part about his wife, Marsha, I got butterflies. This man is an inspiration and I'm so glad that he was brave enough to tell his story, the whole story to the world. As a victim of child abuse, it's encouraging to see a story of someone who made it good, and stopped the cycle.
This book was wonderful! It touches on so many topics. I don't even think you need to read the first two books, to enjoy this one. However, if you read the first two you will just see how much David has been through. This was a fantastic read. I was a bit hesitant to read these three books, but they taught me a lot and reassured me that forgiveness is possible and the importance of life.
This is truly a heartbreaking story of a man who has been through a lot as a child, and who continues to go through a lot as an adult. Someone who grows up to be better, than anyone expected to be. Who at the end, wins. This a story of a true underdog, someone who proved everyone wrong, and grew up to change the world a little, for the best.
Didn't like it at all, and I'm not finishing it.
The book I read is called A Man Named Dave.
It is written by Dave Pelzer himself, and that is his third book.
It is “A story of Triumph and Forgiveness”, it talks about child abuse and how Dave survived it and how he went on about his life when he became a man.
Dave had an abusive mother as a child and was able to escape her around the age of 12.
He was put in foster care and later placed with a family who cared for him.
Dave lost connection with his family for some tim
The book I read is called A Man Named Dave.
It is “A story of Triumph and Forgiveness”, it talks about child abuse and how Dave survived it and how he went on about his life when he became a man.
He wanted to do everything right for his son, and give him the life he always dreamed of as a child.
The falling action was that they were able to get along and Dave was welcome to see his son whenever he wanted to.
He was able to live his life and he became a good man.
The theme for this story is that you can get away from the abuse it will get better for you in the future never give up on yourself.You shouldn't get up on yourself you need to keep trying cause it will get better for you in your life.You will become what you want and have a smile on your face you can get threw your difficult times.Always believe in yourself that you can do it.My opinion in this book is that I really liked it you should read all the series.It teaches you that even if they come to a smile on there face you never know whats happening at home they will act all nice to you even when there hurting.You should always help people when they need help cause you never know what there going threw.I really liked this book it taught me a lesson and always be nice to people.
This took place in the first book “A Child called IT” David is now a grown man who is out of foster care, and wants to join the Air Force in Florida.
Dave went to boot camp to get training and the drill sergeant reminds him of his horrid mother.
David's mother was in the book "A Child called IT" who was brought back in this book as a reminder of the past.The setting takes place in 1979 in Southern California.
The reason this is the theme is, because in the book Dave went through abuse and was in a foster home looking for a reason to keep going in life.
but that is were the similarity ends quote.....as i child i was horribly ed abused by my mother..
but sociologically speaking take an individual experience for instance ONE-WORLD VISON A CHARITY to help those in need in Africa ..
" a girl walks four miles Evey day to get water filtered through a dirty cloth at best,, each day a norther is used by here parents to work in child factory's i in ban cock others are lured in to the sex-trade..
i never read his previous books lost-boy, & a child called it,..
and being sociologically abused by others from then on ( its called the human-trait)...some call it greed, the collective manipulation of others ..
never called abuse..
Dave Pelzer suffered terrible abuse at the hands of his mother as a child, and this book can be seen as a message to other survivors that it doesn't have to end there, you can get out of your situation and make a real life for yourself.
This whole thing of what happens in the home, stays in the home is absolute bullshit and is no excuse for the other adults in Dave's life), but then he got out, into foster care, found a loving family (who suddenly disappeared like halfway through the book).
Things go wrong in everyone's lives, and your life after that was in your hands, no one else's.
I realize that it was a long time ago, law-wise, but how can a family get away with so much?
And reading his brother Richard's book just made me angrier!
I know there's a middle book too but have yet to read/find it in my stacks.
And this book tells you everything you need to know.
At least this time it was closer to the end where he opens up his heart to his one true love Marsha.
It was nice to hear that Dave did end living life as a happily ever after.
