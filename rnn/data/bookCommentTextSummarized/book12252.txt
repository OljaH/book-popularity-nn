This is probably more of a reflection than a"review" I read this book when I first started teaching, and my naive and much younger self wanted to be exactly the kind of teacher Pat Conroy had wanted to be-one who worked with children who needed me and whose lives I could touch in some way-only I would do it better of course!
My first year was a pretty miserable failure and I did not achieve my glorified vision of "the Great White non-Hispanic Hope" (Hey, I said I was naive, right?).
He is to teach the children of the island, the people who used to live from fishing but now can't support themselves from polluted waters.
There is an overarching lack of concern as long as discipline is maintained.Conroy writes of his experiments in teaching methods and his gambles with the authorities to try new activities with the children.
The surface definitely does not reveal all.Conroy's prose is beautiful; he captures the natural world around him so wonderfully.
He also captures the individual children and their families so well.
You will feel that you have met many of them by the time you have finished reading this book.
It is that good a book.
There are sublime sentences, most often straight out of the mouths of the eighteen black kids whom he's teaching, 1969-970, on Yamacraw Island (Daufuski Island), South Carolina.
Until he got kicked out for insubordination after one year as a teacher!
He is a fantastic teacher.
He is the kind of teacher these kids needed.
In the prologue the author says how he felt the narration of his book by Dan Jon Miller was pure perfection.
It captures the essence of his kids' lives.
It improves what is at bottom a wonderful book.
Conroy spent a year teaching at an all-black school on an island off South Carolina.
Blacks who have gone through the civil rights struggle have met a hundred white boys and girls who would dive head first in a septic tank to prove their liberation from the sins of their fathers.”“In the fantasy of the races conceived in my mind, all blacks were noble people who had struggled against a repressive social order for years and who were finally reaping the tangible rewards of this struggle.
In 1969, Pat Conroy, a young idealistic teacher, accepted a position at a two room school house on an impoverished and isolated island off the coast of South Carolina.
He is assigned the class of 5th-8th graders.
The largely segregated school district of which this island was a part, had presumed that these Black children were inherently incapable of learning and treated them accordingly.
Conroy obviously cares deeply for these children and is proud of his efforts, so this is an upbeat, funny and heart-warming book despite the frustrations of battling a discriminatory system.
I realize this book has an underlying focus on racism in the South in the late '60s, but the other plot line I what resonated with me-a gifted teacher unfairly losing his job.
It was quite difficult for me to read how inspired Conroy was in the classroom, how much he cared about his students and their minds and futures only to be told he's insubordinate and no longer wanted.
Conroy and I are both not ass kissers, which in the education system that runs on a political hierarchy , is a much craved expectation.
All teachers have worked with a Mrs. Brown, a Piedmont, an Edna.
And no one cared.
Not only did I enjoy the story, which is true, but I also enjoyed the writing of Pat Conroy.
This is the first book I have read by Conroy.
This is about the experience Conroy had in the early 70’s teaching in a one room school house on Yamacraw Island (which is the pseudonym for Daufuskie Island), an island off the coast of South Carolina.
Conroy took a true life experience and put in down on paper in such a way that the reader felt like they were there on the island with him.
This was the first Pat Conroy book I read, and several years later, I had an opportunity to spend some time on Yamacraw, the island where he taught school. It was a magical place, with sandy roads shaded by great oak trees dripping with spanish moss. The people lived in backwards conditions, but they were tied to the land and their relationship with the land and the ocean in a way that few if any of the rest of us will ever experience. This is an inspiring, uplifting book and I am a better person for having read it,
Pat Conroy's memoir of his year teaching 1969-70.
It's kids of Gullah dialect S.C. island living who don't have cultural context to the English and other subjects, like American History and reading skills- that he is trying to teach them.
But in a larger, much larger picture, I now, in age, compare it to a classroom in which the class does NOT have a common language, be it Gullah or dialect, or standard anything.
And most of these Dominican sisters taught for 40 years in the same place until all of their students were Baptist and not a one was Catholic.
This was a time that I remember well, being 10-12 years old, but his story is in the south where Jim Crow was just beginning to erode, and school de-segregation was in its infancy.
He took on teaching at a 2 room schoolhouse of all black students on an island reachable only by boat, and was shocked at way these people lived, almost like a tribe completely set aside from civilization.
But I have no doubt that these people appreciated this white man who came over for a year, opened there eyes, and likely made impact on those student lives for years to come.
Published in the early 70’s, this is the phenomenal memoir of Pat Conroy as a teacher in 1969, on Defuskie Island, SC.
Without going into all Pat did for those students, he was fired trying to bring joyous teaching and exposure to the world beyond their island, but without the political skills to better the system.
Because this story still has relevance today, it should be a mandatory read by all educators and administrators alike.
If I could rate all of Pat Conroy's books at once it would save me a lot of time.
This was another outstanding book by Pat Conroy,he is a amazing storyteller. This book really makes you think about how society and how racism plays a big part in it. The characters were believable and you often felt sympathy for some of the characters. What separates Pat from most authors is the fact that lives what he writes, he is not just telling the story but he actually lived through it.
I like some of his stuff, despite his lunatic family4.
A friend of mine is mentioned in the afterword.I saw the movie made from this book when I was a teenager, a few years before my family moved to South CArolina.
I hated that this was what people would think of South Carolina.
It's changed a great deal in the years since I first moved here, (one would hope!!), and was already moving away from some of the worse stuff portrayed in the book by the time I arrived here in 1971.
There is great beauty here.
When Pat Conroy was a new teacher, he set out for a small island off the coast of South Carolina in 1969/70 to teach poor kids at a black school there.
Not only did these kids mostly not know how to read or write, but they had never experienced Halloween!
Pat did a lot for these kids over the year, and taught them in unorthodox ways.
I thought this was a memoir, but it was only at the very end of the book that it said it was “based on” his year on the island.
Reread.
Conroy, a successful novelist, spent a year teaching on an isolated island off the coast of South Carolina.
He is shocked by the impact of the historical malign neglect represented by the two room school house on Yamacraw—of course segregated until a few years before by policy and during Conroy’s moment by the demographics of the island.
On the Washington road trip, one of his students asks about the lines on the road, something Conroy, like all of us perhaps, takes for granted.
Conroy's idealism and belief that right and wrong are the only thing that matters leads to him becoming a passionate advocate of the island children, and earns him the enmity of people who just want to continue to ignore the islanders.I have to admit that he seems to spend more time teaching the kids about life than he does trying to teach them to read.
So Conroy is inspiring but it's heartbreaking to see him struggle.Part of the reason that I was interested in this book was because I read The Prince of Tides last year.
While I was hanging about the local bookseller (as opposed to a book store) waiting for Conroy to write another book, I realized I had never read The Water is Wide.
Parts of the book are absolutely hilarious!When I read most of Conroy's books, I was a Yankee who never wanted to live in the South.
I can't wait to read South of Broad!
I hope he never stops writing!What amazed me was that after I finished reading this book, I went to put it on the shelf with my other Conroy books and realized that I already owned a copy!
Moving and enlightening account of a year Conroy spent in the 60�s teaching disadvantaged black elementary school students in a two-room schoolhouse on a small coastal island off of Beaufort, SC.
It was exciting to experience the creative approaches Conroy uses to get through to the kids and efforts to get their parents and school administration to go along a series of field trips to expand the students� horizons.
Credit is due to Conroy for covering his own history of racial stereotyping and admitting that his own ego contributed to his being fired for bucking the system too much.
He made each of these students come to life and I was so involved both in the account of what went on in the classroom as well as what was happening behind the scenes in administration that had kept the inadequacies and inequalities in place.I guess I so connected with this story because I went to public schools in the rural South in the 60s and could remember the separateness so pervasive in the system.
I have also experienced how the rural South has changed maybe not for all and not as completely as it can, but largely due to visionaries like Pat Conroy who early on made that change the disparities are not as great and not as pervasive.
I can see why his strong opinions and vocal criticism would get people's backs up in opposition.
He comes on so strong that those who don't share his opinions cannot take the necessary step back to gain some perspective.
I hope the book made a difference in the lives of the people he writes about.
Since it was written in 1972, and the children now receive their education off-island via ferry, I suppose it was worth it.
I expect his name is mud with the powers that be, and shining light to the children who benefited from his willingness to speak out
This is the story of a white man, who in 1969, took a job teaching completely illiterate, isolated, culturally ignorant, poverty stricken black children on an island off the coast of South Carolina.
Conroy spent his year teaching these kids using unconventional methods, anything at all that would spark their interest and give them a chance in the world beyond Yamacraw Island and he was totally villified for it.
I fell in love with the kids and Conroy and I could have screamed at the ignorance of the school board.
I love Pat Conroy's way with words.
He has such a keen sense of description.
He doesn't use a lot of words, yet manages to be very precise in his details.
This detail makes his characters vivid and memorable.
There are crappy teachers who care more for their job than the students, and then there are the ones who roll up their sleeves and reach with both hands in order to make a difference.
Teachers need to be teachable.
The status quo should never be the norm when there are students failing.The writing was amazing.
The characters were memorable.
This is not his magnus opus- that would be my just finished Prince of Tides, but I enjoyed this just as much. A young, passionate Conroy has been fired after one year of teaching, then spends time reflecting and writing about his experience. While raging against the racial injustices, he's candid about his own shortcomings and surprisingly forgiving toward his adversaries. Mostly it's his love and support of his students which shine the brightest. A great book to end the year, but I think I'll keep dipping into the Conrad library in 2018
It would be hard to explain what Pat Conroy is like if one has never read any of his books. But imagine the beautiful flow of a river; the perpetual dance of its waters and the calming music they create upon their every stroke with every earthly matter. Imagine the soothing feeling you can luxuriate in when you let your feet touch its cool waters. That is what Pat Conroy and his words are for me. "beautiful ....calming ....soothing ....perpetual"
An informative look at social conditions in South Carolina in the 1960s. Also, one of the 60 or so books I own and have read multiple times. Influenced my decision that teaching wasn't a vocation in which I'd thrive. As did Deschooling Deschooling Society
With Mr. Conroy's recent passing, it occurred to me that I had not read any of his books. This one, his first, is a memoir of teaching in the south in the 60s. Much like Gloria Steinem's book from the 80s, his story reminded me that we really have a far way to go.
Devastating.
I liked a few of his earlier works that I read when I was much younger, but I found the stories in his later works of fiction to be just ridiculous, contrived, and far-fetched.
I kept hearing from Conroy fans that I should read The Water is Wide and The Great Santini.
I am currently reading some other works on racial reconciliation, and this book about Conroy's experience as a teacher during integration in the South was a good complement to those other works.
I am inspired now to read The Great Santini because, although it is fiction, it is supposedly based on his father.
This was a hard book for me to get into because of the time frame it was written. The way the people spoke about the residents and children of the island was really hard to stomach. Plus there were some questionable and inappropriate things done in the classroom and I needed to remind myself that this was the early 70’s and people didn’t know any better yet. I ended up enjoying it overall and had quite a few giggles because of the sweet kids reactions to new information or experiences.
