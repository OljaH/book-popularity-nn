I love Leonard Bloomfield and it's pretty much because of this book. Language is fun and accessible, and while some of it has not stood the test of time, a lot of it has and it is still a terrific read. Bloomfield comes across as brilliant as well as generous and he writes engagingly and clearly. I don't recommend it as an intro to linguistics because readers new to the discipline won't know what still stands from 1933 and what doesn't, but every linguist should read it. Most will really enjoy it.
Un classico per chi voglia approcciarsi alla linguistica e ai suoi problemi e anche per chi voglia rispolverare le conoscenze in modo interessante.

This book is 75 years old, yet reading it today, I can't help but feel that this would be a better introductory book for Linguistics students than the ones we use currently.Bloomfield, over the course of a little over 500 pages covers almost every area of language imaginable, and he does so in a clear, understandable style, with a plethora of examples.
In every area Bloomfield trears, it is clear he has a thorough knowledge.Of course, the book lacks many of the developments that linguistics has made in since the 1930s, but reading through this work, I'm surprised by how few these new developments actually are.It seems the linguistic 'revolutions' of the 20th century have brought us not that much further in understanding language than Bloomfield was back then.
A revised version of Introduction to the Study of Language, 1914. "The deep-rooted things about language, which mean most to all of us, are usually ignored in all but very advanced studies; this book tries to tell about them in simple terms and to show their bearing on human affairs. (vii)
One of the first serious books I read about linguistics.
Not my favourite linguist, but this book is good enough for introduction to linguistics.
