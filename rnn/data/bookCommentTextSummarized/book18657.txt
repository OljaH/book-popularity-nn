So my husband and I visited my sister and her family and the first room I checked when we got there was my niece’s and of course the first thing I inspected was her bookshelf.
She probably noticed me maliciously eyeing this one.
Good, sensible eight year old handed it to me even before I could say a word.
Greg tries his best to find a date for Valentine’s Day. It was a total disaster.
There’s chicken pox, pantsing, a head stuck in a chair and many other messes involved.
*Stop intruding, Ron Weasley!*

He has mastered the art of writing great episodes one after the other.Second : I am a lifetime fan. No proofs needed.Third : There's always something or the other thing trolling Greg. I can assure you that no square inch of the book turned out as boring. None.Fourth : The third wheel or the stepney, your life never fails to get hold of the funny bone. May true love bl
This one, the seventh in the last 20 days says some things.First : Jeff Kinney is a total ROCKSTAR .
No proofs needed.Third : There's always something or the other thing trolling Greg.
The end is hilariously fine tuned.So fine tuned that you're just counting days for the next novel to hit the stores.
Guess this is what will happen to me when my GR counter hits the 10th book of this series.Love is surely in the air.
Ummm...not in a way we see it the traditional sense though.Now this is why I absolutely love this series.
No way! This comes out on my birthday! May 17 Update: Ahhh joke's on me. It's the day AFTER my birthday now.August 3 Update: AHAHAHA publication on this book is trollin' me, it's being released on my birthday again. NOVEMBER 13, YEAAAH.It was okay... Definitely not as funny as the first ones.
Then, Abigail Brown, who is alone after her boyfriend, Michael Sampson, had a family obligation.
Greg asks Rowley to ask Abigail to go with them as a group of friends; she agrees.
Michael was supposed to go with Abigail, and he may have lied, and both Abigail and Sampson probably did not expect the other to be at the dance.
Finally, while dancing with Abigail, Greg spots what looks like chicken pox marks on her face.
It only turns out she had pimples when she was crying over Michael, but Greg panics, leaving Abigail crying and Rowley comforting her.
I recently started reading this book and so far I really liked it when Greg was talking about his life in his mom's belly.
I think Greg feels lovestruck because whenever he is around this girl named Holly Hills, he acts like she's some kind of glistening rainbow.
I just finished this book and I was suprised to find that Greg's best friend Rowly started to date Greg's dream girl, Holly, and Greg became the third wheel.
I think Greg is mad at Rowly because he started dating Holly when he should have.
I'm so exited for the book! [image error]Update: Finished reading! It lasted me two days. Thank you Ryan for checking it out from the libary for me!!! (Little brother)
This book was GREAT!!! It talk about Greg's life in the start then when you start reading more to it it goes from gregs life to his dance. But you should see what happens to him in the end. I could go on because this is the BEST diary of a wimpy kid book. I Kenny Hernandez could relate to Gregs life. Knowing from Greg that stuff goes great to bad is just like me because I may be in first then come in last. But my point is that this book is THE BEST!!! give this book a 10!!!!!
Finished reading!
It lasted me only two days.
It was FUNNY, well- written, easy and quick read.
Of course, this is for children but I don't care i read EVERYTHING!!••It talk about Greg's life in the start then when you start reading more to it it goes from gregs life to his dance.
But you should see what happens to him in the end.••I can relate to this character, i know what it feels like to only have one true friend .
This book is for ppl who want to laugh out loud.
But I don't know when cz right now I'm BROKE and pretty sure my mom would kill me if i bought another book right now
So far my favorite character is Manny, a.k.a 3 year old devil.
I like Manny because he is so clever and I have never experienced a little brother.
He does things that I would have never thought a 3 year old could do.
If I could change one thing about Manny, I would change his social life skills, because he should have real friends, so that he doesn't bully Greg so much, that Greg's older brothers job, Rodrick.
Now, an OLDER brother, i know what thats like, I have one myself.
Anyway i really like Manny, but he sure is mean for a three year old.
My brother and I are a big fan of the Wimpy Kid series. The books are usually hilarious! This one was probably my least favourite so far though. Just not as funny as the other ones in the series. Still enjoyable, but it felt like something was really lacking in this one...
Because you're not supposed to read other people's diary and that's what makes it more exciting.
However, I had given this up.I came across Wimpy Kid when all of my wishes to read diaries were at stake, since then my perspectives about diaries have revived!
I'm laughing out loud at what and how Greg's life is going to be.Manny is indeed a clever kid, getting all things done for him.
That's the thing about it.Of all the diaries, I've come across, Wimpy Kid is going to be my favorite.I've only one question in my mind, where does the writer get the names for its characters?
Στους δύο τρίτος δεν χωρεί, αλλά το θέμα είναι πάντα ποιος είναι αυτός ο τρίτος! Ένα βιβλίο για σχολικούς χορούς, καλτ μπεργκεράδικα, ανεμοβλογιά, ραντεβού με κορίτσια (τι είναι αυτό το παράξενο είδος;) και φιλοσοφικά ερωτήματα για τη ζωή του εμβρύου κατά την εγκυμοσύνη!
I even haven't read the Cabin Fever yet this one release date is out already? Oh geeez.
Any story that involves love makes me kind of crazy.Mum: Oh, so does Greg get some smooches?LRN: Not exactly, but his friend does.
LRN: The thing is, he gets a date, but really Rowley gets it.Mum: Oh, so like a middle school Cyrano de Bergerac?
LRN: No. Rowley is basically Greg's wingman, but he ends up getting the date instead of Greg.
Mum: Oh, so Rowley is Cyrano.
LRN: This book was the first time I saw that word.Mum: I hate Greg Heffley a little.
We got forced to read Diary of a Wimpy Kid as a transition text for year 7.
The teachers said that it would be great if we could finish it during summer holidays so when we began school we would feel more confident and know what it's like.
Erm..NO, DO NOT READ THIS AS A TRANSITION TEXT.
I was looking for a bit more plot and complexity in this one.
So this is middle grade aimed but Percy Jackson and the Olympians is a amazing example of who complex and intriguing this MG genre can get.
It's short and humour filled so if you tick off both of these points go and read this book.
I pretend to buy these books for my students, but the truth is I can't resist the humor myself.
It's mostly because - the first 5 books' box set lived right on my desk close to bed till I finished them all- I ordered and read the 6th book as soon as I finished the setSo how is this latest installment?
Gregory is still faltering at different levels and his filial love is still on tenterhooks.
Gregory has started to look at girls with an adolescent's perspective and the incidents may make you reminiscent.
If this book has craved me to read more about the wimpy kid and to wait for the next installment, that's thumps up from my side.
It starts out In an ordinary life in middle school and then to really gets to the point.
well, If you want to know what happens after that I can't tell you so I guess you'll have to read and find out!
Kinney really does a good job describing characters and really putting things in Greg's point of view.
I don't think that I can really relate to Greg because well, he's a wimp and is always getting in trouble.
Once you start reading you can't stop!
As you can see from this example, we know what happens to Dad because we read earlier that all the ties that are cut off go on the wall of shame, thus explaining a reasonable ending to a sub-plot.
As you can see, the author didn’t just randomly mention the mad panster in the middle of the story; he explained how the mad pantser came to be, thus explaining an example of a reasonable explanation.
As you can see from the examples above, this book is very good at telling many different sub-plots, but it doesn’t give us and reasonable explanations or endings to all of them.
In the book, there is a Valentine's Day Dance at Greg Heffley's school.
When I first read this book I was disappointed because it wasn't as funny or good as the the other book in the series.
Also sometimes the author goes off topic and starts talking about something that really has nothing to do with the main idea of the story which is Greg needs to find someone to the Valentine's Dance with him.
One example is in the beginning of the story it starts talking about when Greg's mom is still pregnant with him and all the ups and downs of it.
This one was actually pretty funny. It was fun to see Greg grow up, but still have the same hilarious adventures with Rowley and the gang from Greg's middle school. I would give it four stars because it was really funny and an easy read. I mean as far as comic books go. I can't say it's a very good book but in it's own field, this one was another prize winner by Jeff Kinney.P.S. Got this SUPER CHEAP at Target.
الجزء ده مضحك جدا خصوصا ان جريج يظن انه يستطيع ان يتذكر كل الذكريات الخاصة به حين كان في بطن امه استمتعت به
So addicting.
I LOVED the other books. this is the newest one and I'm seriously dying to read it ;)
After a bit of a lull in the previous few books, Jeff Kinney returns to comedic form in The Third Wheel, presenting some of his best jokes since the early entries in the series.
The Third Wheel's humor is top-notch, particularly for the first half of the book, and I appreciate Jeff Kinney's comedic insight.
Uncle Gary doesn't mind being unemployed and not having his own place to live, but Greg's father isn't happy with the open-ended arrangement, and it gets on the rest of the family's nerves after a while, too.
Greg wanted a date to the dance but no one likes him so he tries to do anything for a date.
The conflict is person vs person because Greg is trying to get a date to a school dance but many people are getting in his way by asking all the girls our that he wanted to.
I give this a 5 star rating because I can relate to this character, I know what it feels like to only have one true friend.
in this book Greg was looking for a partner for the valentain's day dance , he went with Rowley and his friend Abigail as a group to dance, the party turned to be a huge mess , you will probably enjoy reading this part , in the end Greg got chicken pox he thought it was from his friend Rowley , i like this book , it was funny in general 🙈
I have read all the Wimpy Kid books so far, and I canNOT wait for this one to come out! I am PSYCHED!!!!! Jeff Kinney, you rule!
It's nice, but quite short.
Excellent book.
