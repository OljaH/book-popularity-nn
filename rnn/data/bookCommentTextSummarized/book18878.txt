I don't know if maybe I'm getting over this style, maybe too much Law and Order watching, but this was a little boring for me.Yeah, it had all the classic KR stuff...bones, mystery, more bones, more mystery.But it was so predictable!
I think that's the main reason I was bored with it.
And throw in some 'colleague' never mentioned before, and there you go, another KRs book.
I hate when authors introduce a new character as a 'long-time friend' or 'long-time colleague' and yet, they've never mentioned them before, in any of the other books.
I might be looking for a new science-mystery author soon.

But she's also battling a crisis of the heart because she's shacking up with two handsome men - her ex-husband, Pete, and her current lover, Andrew Ryan.
There was a LOT going on with this story, but Reichs kept me interested and clear along the way.
-There were certain depictions in this book that I didn't care for, but I won't harp on them here.-I didn't like that Tempe keeps questioning her relationship with Ryan.
I kept wondering how he was going to play into the action since he was mentioned so much.
-I wanted lots more of Pete vs.
Ryan!!!
4,25 stars - Nederlandse hardcover - genoten van deze ! Wel een maand over gedaan omdat ik hem in bed las en steeds in slaap viel. Je wordt regelmatig op het verkeerde been gezet zonder de rode draad te verliezen. 🌺🌸🦋
meh.This was definitely not my favorite out of the series.
Well, it definitely didn't hold my attention, like at all.
It was just meh all around.
She's also always annoying or upset with Ryan.
I feel like I need a little break from this series again because I don't want to end up being annoyed as fuck with everyone.
I want my ship back together but like a lot less annoying.
I want Temperance to stop getting into sticky situations because that's annoying as well.I just want to be happy after a book and this book was just not that.
I found out that this series is the inspiration for the TV show Bones so I thought that it might be a fun read.
The book, to be honest, bored me.
In the book she's just a regular type of typical character.
I don't usually say this, but I like the show better than the book.
I didn't finish it so maybe I'm judging prematurely, but I was just too bored to continue.
I decided about a year ago that if I'm not enjoying a book there is just no reason to keep reading it.
I don't have to write a paper on it and reading is supposed to be fun.

Break No Bones by Kathy Reichs.This could have been just another mystery using a familiar set of circumstances but it was so much more. Tempe is filling in for a colleague during an archaeological dig. The site ia an American Indian burial ground in Charleston. Not too much exciting for the students or Tempe and then something among the old bones catches Tempe's eye. A fresh skeleton is unearthed. A chain of events/murders soon follows and this story takes off. Packed with non-stop excitement, clues and red herrings. Loved it.
Well, it’s never a good idea to watch The movie or TV series before reading the book... I got my hands on this book, and was very excited about it, because I just loved watching Dr. Brennan on TV. So, I ended up feeling a bit disappointed with the book... although it’s an entertaining read, I found it to be quite monotonous, and the twist at the end .. not worth it.
What began as a simple project turns into a heated homicide investigation when three more bodies are found.
While investigating, Tempe crosses paths with her estranged husband a lawyer on business in Charleston.
Matters become more complicated after her boyfriend arrives from Montreal, she is forced to put all distractions aside in order to solve the crimes.Ms Reichs has her own style of writing, short and choppy sentences.
For example sharing a girlfriend's house with her estranged husband and her boyfriend at the same time ??????.
This novel is a decent enough thriller, but it lacks style and passion.
I love her attitude, her personality.
She's not without flaws, just like any human being, and I love reading about her - her feelings, her emotions.
The novel is smooth with her thought process, and it wouldn't be the same without it.Reading about her troubles between Pete and Ryan, it feels natural and completely real.
I love how Reichs brings Tempe to life, like an everyday person that you could bump into on the street, no matter where you go.Again, unbelievable details in both crime scenes and crime solving.
The way she describes everything, you could swear that you're working the case step-by-step with Tempe.
Requires great suspension of disbelief to swallow the idea of Tempe (a forensic anthropologist from Charlotte), Ryan (her detective boyfriend from Quebec), and Pete (her estranged husband, a lawyer) solving murders in Charleston.
Hello, jurisdiction?And a shoutout to my librarian friends - you might find it annoying that Tempe searches in vain for a journal article online, and then suddenly her hindbrain reminds her where to find it (conveniently, in a book in her living room).
A woman with a PhD can't use a database?
Fun, quick, some red herrings to keep it from being *too* easy for the reader to solve.
I had avoided Kathy Reichs' books for a while, finding her plots somewhat repetitive and was getting bored with how (to me) unnecessarily complicated Temperance's personal relationships were and yet they were just going in the same circles.
So I picked this one up, not sure what to expect.
I'm glad I did.
Yes, her relationships are still complicated, but I liked the direction this book took them in.
Reich's writing can be almost formulaic (she always ends her chapters on a cliffhanger note...an effective if obvious technique).
All that being said, this was an enjoyable read and I'm looking forward to reading the next one.
Kathy Reichs books are either easy to read or hard to follow as they can be very heavy on the forensic science. This one was not over the top in that area and I found the story easy to follow and very enjoyable. I particularly liked the banter between Pete and Ryan (Tempes ex and current love interest). Although nothing like the popular tv series "Bones" which is based on these books, they are still great books to read, professionally written and with great characters. I would happily recommend "Break No Bones".
I would say that so far this is my favourite oneTempe is showing a bit more emotion in her love life particularlyI can see why she loved Pete however I really like RyanThe story itself was great, the villain in this book was extremely smart, making sure from the beginning to cover their tracks so it was even more satisfactory when they were captured

And when Pete gets shot it's up in the air as to who's problem has come calling to "Sea for Miles"There's a whole lot going on this book both with the central mystery and Tempe's emotional state of mind.
In the time since, I've often wondered why" and while this may be discussed more fully in future books the emotional rollercoaster Tempe (and the readers) are on because of the presence of both Ryan and Pete at "Sea for Miles" at points overshadows the mystery.Still the book is another solid read in the series and exposes yet another dark dirty underworld of society, this one of harvesting organs illegally, and it kept me roped in and interested until the end.
As it turns out, the client's daughter is the one who originally brought up the idea of the clinic cooking the books because she works there.
Having Pete and Ryan in the same vicinity as her sends Tempe's emotions into a tailspin.Break No Bones is one of the better Tempe Brennan Novels.
Some previous Tempe Brennan novels seemed to be a little big too big and complex for their own good and resulted in a disjointed read that got tied up all of a sudden in the last couple of chapters.
It's written by a Canadian forensic anthropologist from Montreal.
Kathy Reichs works for the Chief Examiner in North Carolina and Laboratoire de sciences et de Medecine Legale in Quebec.
This is her ninth book about a forensic anthropologist who is always getting too emotionally involved in strange murder cases.
It's not too heavy on the science and tech language and it is fairly engaging.
Also, she has a French Canadian cop boyfriend who she is afraid to commit to.Bones, the new forensic show is based on the main character from her books.Easy but intersting reading.
I read it in two days!
My lastest audio book in the car was Break No Bones by Kathy Reichs.
The main character was the inspiration for the Fox tv show Bones.
The only thing it has in common with the show is the character name and field of occupation.The book has a lot of extraneous, rambling information that contributes nothing to the story.
It could have been cut in half, and the story would probably have improved.If you are a fan of the show, I would suggest you avoid the books completely.
They are very disappointing and have nothing in common with the show.
It's a couple of years since I read a Kathy Reichs novel, and the last one was one I didn't enjoy that much, so it was with a little hesitancy that I started this.
Well, I needn't have bothered being concerned - she (or me, because it may have been my state of mind that caused the unhappines with that last one) was back to the great kind of story that I'd loved in all the former ones.What did I like in particular about this?
- I enjoyed the sparring between the ex-husband and the boyfriend, I enjoyed the verbals games that Tempe plays, I enjoyed the descriptions of places and people.
*4.5*
My first Kathy Reichs book - review to follow.Not bad - but for low maintenance/wise cracking/semi loner female detectives, I really prefer Kinsey Millhone.
I have been following this series of books for many years now and have always enjoyed every reading experience.
Recently I have revisited them again as my daughter wanted me to buddy read them with her after discovering the television series and then seeing the books in our bookshelves.
I am glad I read the books before seeing some of the television show because otherwise I may not have liked them quite so much.
I don't know why I stopped reading this series.
I love this author, I love this series and I love the forensics.
I adore the characters each and every one of them including new people that enter Tempe's circle of discovering the truth for the dead bodies she is asked to help identify.
Sheriff Gullet was cantankerous in the beginning and warmed up to Tempe's style of dealing with skeleton remains plus her side kick, Pete the ex, was also pushing her to find the truth.
I do like Pete, but I love Andrew Ryan more.
Well, it's official. I LOATHE Temperance Brennan in the books. This one just downgraded her from adolescent to infantile. Unfortunately, I still like the stories a lot so I'll have to put up with her for a while.How is it that the writers for the TV show made her likeable? There she is nerdy, introverted and socially inept, but still interesting and sane enough that you don't want to slap her silly every 5 minutes like I do when I'm reading the books. Reichs has made her such a whack-a-doodle and emotional basket case that it gives me indigestion.
a book you cannot put down
Kathy Reichs is an amazing writer. Her descriptions of Charleston made me homesick for living down there again.
*4.5/5*Mister. Suspans. Și foarte multe oase. Cu toate că romanul este puțin previzibil, firul narativ este detaliat și atractiv. Este pentru prima dată când citesc o carte având ca personaj principal un antropolog criminalist și pot spune că am fost plăcut surprins de complexitatea acțiunii și de subiectul care mi-a stârnit interesul încă din primele capitole.
Loved this book!!! Glad it included more of her personal life and included her friend dying because it made me love the character even more. I like that she is also in conflict over her old love and her current love because feelings don't just disappear over night I'm glad it highlights thy. The case was excellent and it's nice that it nodded at an actual serial killer and basically did a modern take on that. Better than the last book that was more theory and left me feeling frustrated
Reichs says that Brennan is merely at a different stage in her career in the television series.
I enjoy both characters...and just keep them separate in my mind.So if you are a TV watcher, don't expect the book Brennan to be like Bones.
I want less intrigue and overblown plot, and more investigation, I guess.My one other problem with this book series: I find Brennan's love affair with Andrew Ryan to be annoying.
In Break No Bones, Brennan and her husband are sharing a beach house in Charleston because both are working there at the same time.
