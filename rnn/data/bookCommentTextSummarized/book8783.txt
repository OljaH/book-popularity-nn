The cover of this book proclaimes Phyllis A Whitney to be the " Grand Mistress of Romantic Suspense".
Published in 1960, Thunder Heights tells the story of Camilla King.
The man her grandfather had treated like a son, Ross Granger agrees to stay on to help Camilla learn about her grandfather's business.
The only complaint I had with the book was that a time period was never stated.
But, I could never find where the exact period of time was stated.
Very well done.Although this is an old book, if you are a fan of mysteries or romantic suspense, you won't be disappointed.
I was hoping the same for Camilla King…that her courage would be somehow rewarded, and thankfully, the author gave me clues to indicate this would be so.The first clue came when I read about Camilla’s late mother Althea, and the way she remembered her as a graceful woman who knew how to love and who always seemed to carry an aura of excitement with her.
The man turns out to be her grandfather’s long time attorney, informing her that she’s to travel to Thunder Heights the very next day to visit Orrin, the haste, Pompton tells Camilla, is due to the fact that her grandfather is gravely ill with a heart condition and that he’s now confined to his sickbed.
***2017 Summer Lovin’ Reading List*** 2.5 starsA disappointment, as I had high hopes of Phyllis Whitney. So many gothic romances are set in England, at first I found it refreshing to read one set in New York instead. But I just couldn’t connect with the heroine, Camilla King, who seemed to be unrealistically naïve, especially for someone who had been through so much loss and was supporting herself through governessing. The big party that happens close to the book’s ending would have been better

So many gothic romances are set in England, at first I found it refreshing to read one set in New York instead.
But I just couldn’t connect with the heroine, Camilla King, who seemed to be unrealistically naïve, especially for someone who had been through so much loss and was supporting herself through governessing.
Whitney spent very little time letting Camilla form relationships with either one of them.
As a result, when the choice was made at the end, I just couldn’t feel it was realistic—she barely knew the man she ended up with.
I guess the late Phyllis Whitney (born 1903, died 2008) is, in Victorian Gothic romance, the U.S. equivalent of Victoria Holt (1906-1993), and, in romantic suspense, she's our own Mary Stewart (1916-2014).
Even so, I was delighted to see that many of Whitney's books are now being released in e-format and am enjoying a trip down memory lane whenever I find one at a bargain price.
It's a typical Gothic set-up with orphaned, impecunious heroine in her 20s working as a governess when she is summoned to meet her dying grandfather and the two sisters of her late mother.
She has no where to go as both parents are dead but before she has to leave the house, an attorney shows up and tells her that her grandfather who she has never met is dying and wants for her to come upriver to his estate at Thunder Heights.Thunder Heights is where her mother grew up with her sisters Hortense and Letty in a wealthy household dominated by their business mogul father.
One day school teacher John King met the family and eloped with Camilla's mother, the spirited youngest daughter Althea.
i love reading old romance and mystery book they have a great storyline to them . if i could give this book more than five stars i would . i love this book so much because it kept me guessing what would happened till the end of the book. i have not read a book by this writer till now .and i plan to read more of her book in the future.
When Camilla King is invited by her dying grandfather to visit the family estate Thunder Heights, she is equally astonished and curious to meet her late mother's relatives, which she has never seen before.
Soon, her life is in danger, just like her mother's was when she died on Thunder Mountain some 15 years ago...This was my first Phyllis Whitney.
I didn't care for her dead mother, but felt myself rooting for Camilla herself from the very beginning, overlooking some of her "weaker moments" like wanting to whisper sweet nothings into the ears of a man who hasn't even so much as looked at her...I am looking forward to reading more by this author!
Camilla King takes a trip to a gothic mansion named Thunder Heights where her grandfather resides, a grandfather that her father had done everything in his power to cut connections from.
She found two aunts; an Aunt Hortense who is set in a style of another day, Aunt Letty, haunted beyond reason, also Hortense's adopted son, Booth, a sarcastic man, idle in his ways and Ross Granger, an aid to her grandfather.
Mystery and intrigue surround this story in Camilla's grandfather's will, a painting never quite finished, and a long kept secret that someone doesn't want revealed.
So, not many surprises but an enjoyable story of a young woman who finds her confidence and pieces together pieces of the family secret.And speaking of which, I found that while this seemed to be an important part of the story, it really was a lame thing in that one of the characters felt it was their fault simply because (view spoiler)[no word was spoken to stop the unfortunate victim from going out riding in a storm which ultimately spooked the horse she was riding and tossing her (hide spoiler)].
But a reason was needed to get the heroine to the family estate so I guess this was as good a reason as any.One more quibble - there is a cat in this story but no mention is made of it at the climax of the story when (view spoiler)[the house catches on fire.
This book has been on my shelf waiting to be read for years (along with a LOT of others!). I just wanted to read an old-fashioned mystery and this one was just right. I'd forgotten how much I like Phyllis Whitney. Yes, her plots and characters are all similar (I told my husband, in general terms, how the book would end and, of course, I was right) but she does gothic mysteries so well that I enjoyed every moment while I read it.
I went through a period of time where I read Phyllis Whitney books back to back - I chain-read her books! Her writing style appeals to me, and these books make a great summer day in the park type read, or a good story to curl up with on a rainy day. The only drawback is the plots are all pretty similar (girl is usually trying to solve a family mystery and finds an attractive yet scary man, etc.) and I can't remember which is which! I liked them all, however.
Camilla's maternal grandfather suddenly passes away, leaving her his estate overlooking the Hudson River--Thunder Heights. She is an orphan and is hoping to have a family and home now, but...instead she gets to deal with two aunts--one very ghostlike and the other one cold. There are also other interesting characters and dangers to endure in solving the mystery of her mother's death. The ending was kind of abrupt, but worked.Ms. Whitney is like comfort food--familiar and vintage.
When I found this battered paperback in a library book sale I was delighted. I have read many books by Phyllis Whitney and I have enjoyed them all. However, this one was new to me. Yes, it is easy to guess the villain--especially if you've read other books by this author. Nevertheless, Ms. Whitney's strength lies in revealing character--bit by bit. All the players are carefully drawn and the descriptions are vivid as well as haunting.Take a trip back in time and read this book.
This was my first Phyllis A. Whitney. I was hooked and read nothing but Phyllis Whitney for about 2 years until I read almost all I could find.
I loved these romantic mysteries when I was 16-17 years old. I read lots of Phyllis Whitney and Mary Stewart.
Although it wasn't "amazing," I still gave it five stars, as it's classic Whitney: well written, suspenseful. Good memories of my teenage years reading this wonderful author.
Interesting.
Camilla has never seen her grandfather or aunts. One day she is called to her mothers old home by her grandfather, but someone doesn't want her there.
I read Thunder Heights many years ago back in the 1970s. Suspenseful and gothic! I loved it!
Not having had much exposure to classic gothic romantic suspense novels, I thought I'd try a few and Thunder Heights wasn't a bad choice - there's nothing particularly new or different about the fairly standard story, but sprinkling of "dun dun dun" suspense and a light romance makes this a solid rainy-day comfort read.It's the tried and true story - our young orphaned protagonist, Camilla King, is the recipient of a large inheritance from her estranged grandfather and travels to Thunder Heights to claim it, only to find herself faced with an extremely hostile environment.
Maybe it was because of reviews saying her style was similar to VH, and to me, it wasn't.
The mystery may not be great, but I love how she, Camilla, cannot trust anyone, and escapes death by mere luck.There were 2 negative aspects of the book: 1) the last chapter.
All ends too rushed, and kind of melodramatic; 2) Camilla's love interest.
And the little there is of him, he is always angry.Nevertheless, point Nr. 1 is due the edition of my book, and point Nr. 2 is only secondary to the story.
I saw this on a bookshelf recently and just had to read some Phyllis Whitney again.
I read a lot of Whitney and Victoria Holt, among others, as a young teenager.
I will admit that when I re-read this, it didn't take me long to "remember" who the hero and villain were but it was a nice respite from the more serious stuff I've been reading.I tended to avoid books that took place in America as a teen.
This book takes place on the banks of the Hudson River at the turn of the century, and is very enjoyable if you're looking for some light reading.
Probably a 3.5 really.
I am tempted to rate it higher for Whitney's skill in writing and the fact that it was compelling storytelling.
I liked the setting and the characters.
But the protag had moments of cluelessness and obstinance that, while they made for convenient plot turns/devices, didn't read true.
Also, I would rate it more of a mystery than a "haunting novel of suspense" as the cover describes.
That's not a bad thing at all, it just didn't have the moodiness or tautness I look for in gothic reads.
Definitely encouraged to check out more of her writing though.
I found it slow at the beginning, but there were a few twists along the way I didn't expect.
For example, when Ross admits to have feelings for her and then tells her he is going to leave anyway.
And I also really like she admitted to being attracted to Booth, which I thought was interesting, who doesn't like a bad boy now and then?But, in the end, she is saved by our hero Ross after Booth, who had been interesting, was suddenly reduced to a cardboard cut out of an evil villain.
All in all, I enjoyed the classic atmosphere and thought it was a fun read!
Phyllis Whitney was more popular in the 70s than she is now. I enjoyed reading her romantic thrillers over the years (my mother always had them laying around the house) and decided to read this one again. Not as good as some of her others, but it's still a little creepy and mysterious with the handsome stranger/pretty girl motif.
I read this book twice in the past... ten years. All I really remember is liking it enough to read it again before I sent it back to the thrift store, and that I was pretty confused the first time around. Having said that, I guess I won't write a detailed review since it has been so long. Liked it, don't think I loved it.
These are historical romances, the kind in which the heroine only kisses her true love twice, and there is slight handholding and brief dancing, things like that. The reason that I like these books is that they are also murder mysteries, with delightfully Victorian-tinged twists and turns. Yeah.
Another great book.
If you love gothic suspense with a touch of romance you will like this. Think American version of Victoria Holt.
See Quicksilver Pool.
