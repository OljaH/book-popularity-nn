If you can only have one star, it may as well be a Death Star.
What can I say about this book??
IT IS A BAD BOOK!!!
It has bad cheesy prose, a snotty annoying (and kind of a bimbo) heroine and the cliched, brooding Byronic vampire hero, needless to say that the moment they lay their eyes upon each other they fall hopelessly in love.
Oh yes!!
it also has a love triangle!!!!
I am ashamed to admit it...but yes I did!!!
This book is a guilty pleasure, pure silly escapism and I'm afraid I will be back for more...
Written long before Twilight. SMeyer's claim of never having read Vampire fiction is absurd. There are FAR TOO MANY parallel's between LJ Smith's characters and Smeyer's.And when it comes down to it? SMeyer has nothing on LJ Smith.The story is refreshing and action packed. The characters are likeable. Stefan and Damon are interesting. And they don't SPARKLE!All in all? 9 billion times better than Twilight. I can't wait to read the next one
I didn't expect this book to be what it was.
I was planning on reading the series, but I kinda forced myself to finish this book, which is obviously not a good sign.Elena's characters wasn't likeable.
I don't mind the being popular part, I just couldn't stand it when she was ordering people around to find out information about Stefan.
Even the pivotal moments seem kinda boring when described.From everything I've been hearing about the TV show, maybe this is a case where the book isn't better than the TV show or movie.
I read this on the usually-safe assumption that the book would be better than its adaptation.
The TV series is a dramatically revised and very loose adaptation of the book, and a HUGE IMPROVEMENT.
I'd give the TV series 4 stars, but this book is among the most worthless I have ever read.I was shocked to realize just how bad the book is: atrocious dialogue, Elena is arrogant from the start and does not improve on acquaintance (all the characters are pretty shallow, actually), the romance is woefully artificial, and the plot...
But there is no way I'm reading Book II.
After reading the vampire trilogy by Stephenie Meyer, I thought I would continue my bloodthirsty fiction rampage with this older teenage vampire trilogy. Lo and behold, it's almost the same story! Oh, Stephenie Meyer, now I know how you cranked out those three fat (should have been heavily edited) books in such a short span of time! For shame!
This book is from the early 90's, but with the Twilight phenomenon, it's now been reissued, bound with a new cover featuring some blonde model, and is being considered as the basis of a TV series on CW (not sure how I feel about that).
I like the original cover better (featured above).
Some parts of this are cheesy, but the story is this: Hot, slightly bitchy and arrogant girl-next-door catches the eye of TWO vampire brothers who hate each other.
Δεν είναι και οτι καλύτερο έχω διαβάσει, αλλά 3.5 αστεράκια θα τα βάλω, για τις αναμνήσεις που μου ζωντάνεψε!
At first the cover of my german version is ugly (yeah I know, don't judge a book by its cover, but it IS ugly)Second, I am really fed up with all this "ooohw dark handsome mysterious guy" or even better TWO gorgeous brothers.
What's about true beauty?
The beauty of the heart?Then the next point, Elena the school queen.
Ugh I really don't want to write about that.While her character isn't very complex, so it is the same with her friends and cute little Stefano, the mysterious loverboy.
It's just like "oh I saw you and you're like SO gorgeous!
I've always considered that no movie or TV show can produce better essence than the books.
But I guess I was wrong to some extent.
The book version of THE VAMPIRE DIARIES was too horrible for me.
Though I never knew that TVD is adapted from a book series, now it turns out that it would have been way better if my sister never enlightened me on this topic!
All in all, it felt as if I was reading a Vampire Diaries fanfic on the net.
The TV Show is hell better.
Go watch the TV series.
This book was pretty good, didn't really expect that. I enjoyed it alot and will be continuing with the series!Elena was quite annoying, and the insta-love was just ridiculous, but I found myself being able to look past that.I feel like the series is only going to get better, I hope that's the case :)
I've never read anything like it.Immediately I make my dad take me to the bookstore in the mall so he can buy me the rest of the series.
And everyone thought I was weird for liking vampires.
I know people don't like Elena because she's selfish and shallow but that doesn't bother me.
More power to Elena, I say.I literally don't understand how people think this is bad.
I get that they might not like it, but bad?
It ends on a cliffhanger, but if you're reading the new two-book edition, you get to jump right into The Struggle!Anyway.
If the show had not been made, if I had not read a ton of other vampire books, THE AWAKENING might have been OK.
Since the show was made and since I have read a ton of YA PNR with vampires as the central figure… I am amazed that I finished it.
First: This book pales in comparison to the show.
Which leads me to the boys, Steffan and Damon.
I intend to answer in the affirmative (and with a straight face) that, yes, I did read the books she got me.
1/5 StarsThis is the case when the adaption is better than the book.This book is just sooooooooo bad.I read this book back in 2015 because I was a big fan of the television show (which I'm not anymore) and wow what a disappointment it was. Elena was very annoying and arrogant, probably one of the worst characters I’ve read, and honestly all the characters were pretty horrible. This book is ridiculous and a waste of time, don’t read unless you want lose some brain cells.
These were some of my favorite books as a teenager. They are about a high school student, Elena Gilbert, who is torn between two hot vampire brothers. Melodrama ensues. They are not the most mature books, but they are all about nostalgia for me. Of course, as I get older, I think that a lot of the things Elena does are downright stupid, but I still remember how romantic it all seemed when I was 14.
The fact that Stefan could read minds also felt like it was just a Twilight knock-off, though if you asked me, I wouldn't be able to tell you which book was published first.
I know it's unfair to compare the two, since they are in different media and the plots are vastly different, as well (yes, I admit to looking up the plot summaries of the books, since I couldn't stand to read them myself).
My curiosity to see what happened in the plot was not enough to keep me going through the bad writing and horrible characterization, and when I did finally read plot summaries, I wasn't impressed by those either.
Δεν είναι κακό, μικρό και ευκολοδιάβαστο, αν κ σίγουρα έκανε κακό το οτι είμαι φαν της σειράς. Το βιβλίο και η τηλεοπτική σειρά δεν εχουν σχεδόν καμία σχέση. Όταν το δέχτηκα αυτό και άρχισα να το διαβάζω ως κάτι διαφορετικό άρχισα και να το απολαμβάνω. Παρ'ολα αυτα έχω ενστάσεις για το χαρακτήρα της Ελένα, ουτε στη σειρά τη συμπαθώ, ούτως ή άλλως, αλλά εδώ αγγίξαμε νέα όρια αντιπάθειας!
Elena isn't the typical ordinary girl.
Elena immediately falls in love with him and is willing to dump her boyfriend so he can have him.
Bitch.Stefan realizes that Elena looks like Katherine, his former lover, and the reason he is a vampire.
Even Elena said that she will die without him, before they even got together.
The only love triangle at the moment is the one between the Salvatore brothers and Katherine.
I'm still intrigued about what will happen with Elena and the Salvatore brothers, though.
Okay, yes, this book was predictable, cheesy, with bland characters and plot-less, but I still want to know what will happen next.
I on the other hand saw the first 20 minutes of it and my curiosity piqued (especially after seeing the gorgeous sexy Salvatore brothers haha) and I started on episode 1 and just kept going and been watching live after the season that was on netflix.
It's one of those RARE moments where the show was done perfectly, casting was/is fantastic, but I'm also glad the show is on their last season.
So I'm actually GLAD it took all these years to do a movie/tv series on it especially the casting.
Enough said haha.......
Creo que un buen indicador para valorar un libro es su capacidad para atrapar al lector y, al menos en mi caso, no podía soltar esta novela.
Si bien al comienzo podría sospecharse una historia simple y superficial, al ir avanzando va tomando un cariz bastante oscuro, con conflictos muy bien elaborados y en que los personajes van tomando mucha fuerza.
Además, destaco el estilo de la autora: muy limpio, claro y con un equilibrio perfecto en lo descriptivo como para crear todo el entorno en la imaginación del lector, pero sin hacerse excesivamente denso.
I know the TV show is MUCH better than the book, but let’s be honest you guys, this is the original piece that brought the characters to life. It was written in 1991 for god’s sake, give L.J. some credit! It’s pure gold. 💛💛💛💛
Elena is a BLONDE special snowflake and self proclaimed Queen of Robert E.
Totally sounds like someone an old world vampire would want, right?
Stefan is so blah and boring though, he probably needs some immaturity in his life.
Damon, hmm...we didn't get much of him, but he's as always, a snarky asshole :)Elena and Stefan have an insta-love worse than most.
Their lips touched, grazed from the sound of it, and she knew it was love.
And to top it all off, Stefan thinks our special snowflake is a tigress with insides of steel.
I have about a million positive things to say and only one negative: Elena says "I love you" too quickly.
It was written years before Twilight and I wonder if Stephenie Meyer may have gotten some of her ideas from this series.
Elena is somewhat pretentious in the beginning, but blossoms throughout the book.
He believes that he is no longer worthy of happiness, and instead seeks to blend into society only to find acceptance in Elena.
I fully recommend this book to anyone who has a fondness for love triangles, and the supernatural.
The Awakening (The Vampire Diaries #1)Genre: YA paranormal romancePages: 272 Published: 1991The Vampire Diaries #1Ok the vampire diaries.
First yes I get why they have this cover, but when she has dark hair and Elena has blonde, it's just weird.Elana fancies a boy, the boy Stefan is a vampire, she wants him, he is scared for her sake, they get together.That was the short version.First, 17 year old girl, 500 year old vampire, eww.Ok to the story.
I didn't like Elena.
She was the most beautiful girl at school, she was the most popular, everyone loved her.
And I am supposed to like her?
Poor, poor Elena.The Awakening is the story of an exceedingly privileged high school girl who falls insta-in-love with the new kid in town, who just so happens to be a 500-year-old vampire.
Oh yeah, she also begs Matt for favors… the guy she literally just dumped for Stefan… and now she’s asking Matt to help her win Stefan… (Matt has got to be the best character in this whole book, seriously.)Now I don’t want to get too spoilery, but the insta-love gets its chance to shine and proceeds somewhat like this:“There’s an almost desperate hunger inside him when he kisses me, as if he wants to pull the soul out of my body…”“She kissed the predatory mouth that had threatened her only a few moments ago.”Yeah that’s… healthy.So why didn’t I give this book one star?
Well, I didn't like this book.
I read half of the book and then got really really bored so I scanned the pages til the end.
I did not like the characters - especially Elena.
And relieved because I was saved from another half a day of pure stupidity.Elena's obsession with the Stefan was just too annoying plus there were a bunch of stupidly infuriating scenes that were so, well..
I might as well start reading other books that actually make sense.
I was thinking of starting this off by saying The Awakening reads like fanfiction, but .
On the first day back at school, Elena sees Stephan and decides she's going to have him, even "if it killed her.
She couldn't remember how long it had been since a boy had done that.
Elena decides this means Stefan thinks he's better than everyone else.
(view spoiler)[I think they speak like once sentence to each other, maybe.
*gag* (hide spoiler)]With that being said, I think I can see where the author was going with this.
NAME THAT BOOK First we have oh great i can't wait....then add some lines  wait for it! and then the big reveal.i'm shaking in anticipation =

Maybe my vampiric wishes will be granted :) I've also heard it's way better than the TV show but I can't comment on that as I've never actually seen it - I just can't bring myself to look past the fact that the male leads are clearly about 35, and everybody's acting as if they reasonably pass for 16 year old high school students.One more thing - every description I've seen of this book bizarrely describes the plot as 'a love triangle between a high school girl and two vampire brothers'.
