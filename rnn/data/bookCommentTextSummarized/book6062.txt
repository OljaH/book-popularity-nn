this book is sooo cute
The illustrations are very nice and the story, while simple, has a good lesson.The only qualm I have with it now is that Chip kind of did have a reason to get mad, even if he didn't handle it well and blamed the wrong person.
He was used to being spoiled and doted on by the family, and then they suddenly ignore him and give him the same treats as the adult horses?
A great book for teaching sharing to the little one in your life.
Stunning artwork!
Notes:one of our favorite horse books beautiful illustrationslonger story, best for 5+
My favorite book when I was a kid :) Beautiful artwork!
This is the story of Chip, the young racehorse and how he learned to make a friend.
Chip could hardly wait till he was big enough to partner up and swish fly's off his partner's face.
One day a new colt is born and Chip gets jealous.
Chip is not very nice to Strawberry, he even bites and chases him.
Will Chip ever learn to be nice?
Then one day when the fly's are particularly nasty he learns Strawberry could be his partner for swishing flys.teaching application- This is perfect for a partner activity.
