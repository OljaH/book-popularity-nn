The annoying thing about reading this book at home is that every time my DH walked by he said, "What are you reading about a blood clot for?" Annoying husbandly dyslexia aside, this was one I hardly remembered at all, though I know I've read it a number of times.
Bonfire, out of Volo Queen by The Black, is the star of this book, but the real standout is Bonfire's owner, Jimmy Creech.
The machinations that our hero, young Tom, and his elderly sidekick George, go through to keep Jimmy in nurses and good humor, are mind-boggling.
I loved The Black Stallion's Blood Bay Colt from start to finish--the characters were interesting (especially Jimmy Creech and Uncle Wilbur), the pacing was perfect, and the horses were lovable.Don't get me wrong, I love Flame and The Black, but it was nice to have a break from the 'wild stallions who will only submit to the boys they love' thing.
The vast majority of real horses aren't like that--they're more like Volo Queen and Bonfire.
Of course, every horse has its own personality, but those two things are usually traits that can be attained through training.
Also, I liked how Volo Queen and Bonfire were naturally sweet-natured.
I remember this book as having a hardback, green cloth cover.
I don't know how many times I read this book back then but I looked for it every summer.I also remember the book was titled The Blood Bay Colt so was confused by the current title.
A little research revealed the book was published in 1950 under the name The Blood Bay Colt.
I imagine if I had known this book was a series I would have read the whole series back then.I have to say I did enjoy rereading this book as an adult.
The title of this book should have been "Jimmy Creech's Personality Disorder and His Big Bad Ulcer". Jimmy this, Jimmy that. Jimmy Jimmy Jimmy...they should have sedated him in the first chapter. It's all about Jimmy. In between Jimmy's rants and raves, some interesting bits about harness racing and country fairs.
This book is all about over coming the odds and accomplishing things that other people don't think you can accomplish. Tom and Bonfire enter a race with a lot of other really good racers they have to overcome the odds and win.
In this book the main character is Tom and his horse, Bonfire.
They didn't have enough money to pay the expenses so Tom and Jimmy's friend, George Snedecker, have to race Bonfire at the night raceways to make enough money to pay the expenses.
Right before Jimmy got let out of the hospital George and Tom raced Bonfire at the night raceway in New York.
When they picked up Jimmy from the hospital George took him to the stable to see Bonfire.
Jimmy doesn't like the night raceways.
In my opinion I loved the book so much.
The book I read was called “The black stallion’s blood bay colt”.
The main character was called Jimmy Creech.
The main idea is that Jimmy Creech used to be a player of harness racing.
These younger players want to make the sport a business to make money.
Then, Tom messenger, a young player, with his blood bay colt came to the race again.
Actually, many people make sports or arts business to make money.
However, many athletes or artists play in the race or create their products not because they want to make money but because they have passion for their careers.
I grew up reading Walter Farley, and a visit in the fall to the Kentucky Horse Park prompted me to pick up one of the old favorites.
What I enjoy most is learning about the sport and seeing it come of life in print.
The characters in this book are some of my favorite, from the wisened friend to the crotchety owner to the boy full of hopes and dreams.
It's always enjoyable to see it all work out in the end and to see the struggle to get to the deserved reward.
A simple pleasure for horse-lovers.
Another great book by the author Walter Farley who takes you on a another loved up tale of what it takes to have the horse you loved as your best friend. This is the sixth book in the series and is exactly how I expected to turn out when I read it. I advise to any readers interested in animals and a strong bond of friendship.
"A race wasn’t always decided by speed alone."I don't know much about harness racing (well less than I know about Thoroughbred racing anyway), so this was an interesting read for me. It contains something I love: horses. But also something new: harness racing. So I got to enjoy a book but learn something at the same time.
This is one of my favorite Black Stallion books. I love the in depth descriptions of it. From the movement of the horses to the feelings of the characters. There is a lot of knowledge to be gained about horsemanship as well as the love of breeding and training that goes into it.
Tom Messenger takes care of a colt on his uncle's farm because the owner did not have a good place for it. But he would never have guessed that he would get to ride it in the races.
Read the whole series when I was in grade school
4.5
This book is the result of that pairing.We meet the trio - Jimmy Creech, veteran harness racer, George, his faithful sidekick, and Tom Messenger, a young boy who has a passion for horses and harness racing, before the colt is born.
Tom is just coming into his own with horses, and Jimmy entrusts the care of the mare and foal to him for the summer while he heads back out to race his current horse.
But Jimmy's health and Tom's capability change the landscape and soon Tom and George are training Bonfire, the colt, while Jimmy's every effort should be on getting well.
I liked the discussion of the modernization of horse racing, the contrast of the fairs and the racetrack.
I liked the way Tom's coming of age is balanced by Jimmy's growing old and by the older drivers he races against.
I liked the way the young characters respected the old ones, and the way the old respected the young.That may make me incredibly old-fashioned.
It also makes me a product of this book and all the books I read growing up, books published in the early 1900s.
It also makes me marvel at the way all eras are subconsciously recreated within their books' pages.
This is really one of my favorites of the series - it's so archaic - I'm just rereading it and just took note of the fact that Tom doesn't know Jimmy is hurt til they read about it in the newspaper....almost all the communication is by snail mail.
And I love Uncle Wilmer and Aunt Emma.
I love this sentence for some reason (page 123 of the original first edition):',No need to pay me anything," Uncle Wilmer returned, taking a long inspired reach across the table for the platter of fried chicken...' Long inspired reach.
I just finished reading this book for the umpteenth time.
I first read it as a child.
It is one of my favorite books by Walter Farley.
I wish that Random House had been more careful about choosing the illustration for the cover of this Yearling edition.
The blood bay colt, Bonfire, is shown with his dam, who in this picture is a grey Arabian-looking mare.
Bonfire's dam is described in the book as a dark bay with a white blaze.
How Yearling got a grey Arabian-looking mare out of that is a mystery to me!
I give this book 3.5 stars. I could not keep my attention on the story it could be because this series is for much younger readers then me. Beautiful horse descriptions very vivid imagery. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------SpoilerNote to Self: PennsylvaniaTom Messenger(nephew,horse trainer trainee),Bonfire(blood bay colt,second son of Black Stallion+Volo Queen(mare,retired to farm)),Jimmy Creech(62yo,pro reins man,veteran driver,owner of Bonfire,had ulcer surgery,pal),George Snedecker(veteran,pal),Uncle Wilbur(farmer)+wife ,Miss.

I started re-reading The Black Stallion series by Walter Farley in April and read five more from that series in May: Son of the Black Stallion, The Black Stallion and Satan, The Island Stallion, The Island Stallion's Fury, and The Blood Bay Colt. Only The Black Stallion and Satan was as enjoyable as when I was a kid, though I remember never really caring for the Island Stallion "spin-offs" or the two books on harness racing. Where's Alec and The Black? Bring 'em back!
We get to learn about the son of the Black Stallion and his relationship with his own boy. The Black Stallion's Blood Bay Colt by Walter Farley is a great addition to this series. We get to see that the Black Stallion can have amazing gentle offspring and have great relationships. A book for all the young horse lovers out there.
This book isn’t what you look for in the Black Stallion series. It isn’t about Alec Ramsey, it is about another boy who gets to help train a colt sired by the Black on a harness racing mare. Despite that, it is everything you could want from a Walter Farley book; big hearted horses, cool characters, and intense racing scenes.
I raced through this series as a child. Of course, "The Black Stallion" was my favorite, and I read it a few times, but I waited eagerly for any of the books to return to my branch of the library so I could snap them up.
I enjoyed the characters, and their world and hope I get the chance to read the story again and/or to read more within the series.My Rating System:* couldn't finish, ** wouldn't recommend, *** would recommend, **** would read again, ***** have read again.
OMG! This book has to be up there with my favorite books of all time! so... so much BREATHTAKING DETAIL! You have to read all of them (besides being a horse lover, as myself) to see the true beauty of them. All Walter Farley books are MY favorites. What are yours?
It has been a while since I've visited the Black Stallion series, but this book continues to remain distinct. Farley is a wonderful writer able to bring the story to life in a way captivating for younger readers. For any young horse lover, this book (and the entire series) is a must have.
JAR5-Far
One of the weaker ones in the early part of the series, but I enjoyed it because I loved Farley's work.
Extra 1/2 star.
There was not a Black Stallion book that I could ever put down. The stories are the best.
