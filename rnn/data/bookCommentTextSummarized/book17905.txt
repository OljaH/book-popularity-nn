It’s funny how some books can immediately grab hold of you and cast you under their spell.
“It seemed she had acquired all the drawbacks of being a mistress and none of the advantages - like sex.
(She was becoming bolder with the word if not the act.) For Perry, it seemed to be the other way around - he had all the advantages of having a mistress and none of the drawbacks.
Like sex.” Poor Juliet is truly naive and I had to keep reminding myself how young she was.
Great historical fiction in the world of British espionage in WW2 and the repercussions that emerge in the 1950s.
Touches on issues of class in spying circles, being gay, the monitoring of fascists, a young Juliet, recruited to engage in the process of transcription that develops into so much more.
Then some time after the war, Juliet is now a BBC radio producer and sees a familiar face that refuses to acknowledge her leading to the entry of a host of familiar figures from the past.
There are so many great reviews on this, so I will limit myself to saying this is complex storytelling that I found thoroughly absorbing, enjoyable and immersive historical fiction.
There is something comparable in theatre, when the actors takes off their masks for the final bow and we all celebrate together.Atkinson returns to the Second World War, periodic releases from the National Archives of secrets from that time fueling her creative process.
When she discovered [true fact] hundreds and hundreds of pages of transcripts of conversations of dissident groups in London, her story had a heart.What Kate Atkinson does is not necessarily unique (using historical documents to create fiction), but what she does with it is unique.
This novel has only three time periods to work with and really only one central character, which simplifies the action enough that I only had to reread an earlier section once.
I failed to connect with her and yet I enjoyed reading her thoughts.
The other characters in this book had their own sense of humor as well.
I do not read a lot of espionage/spy novels and it was nice to see the humor thrown in.
Plus, this is another way of giving the reader a glimpse into Juliet's life, her interactions with others in the M15.Apart from some pacing issues, I was hoping for a little more action in this book.
Unfortunately the anticipation for this novel went south as I become bogged down in a uneven plot, and the flipping of time elements.
It was hard for me to maintain attention and though I did skim a bit, and found myself adverse to continuing at times wishing and hoping it would get better.So, for me this novel just didn't come together.
I am hoping Ms Atkinson does continue to write for she does it so well.Thank you to my local library for a copy of this book.
“May I tempt you?” This question is the impetus which shifts a very young woman from a job merely transcribing traitorous conversations deliberately overheard during WWII in London into a bonafide spy. Working at the BBC ten years, later her misdeeds of the past come back to haunt her. For a novel about espionage, I found the characters to be rather dull and the plot lacking in tension.
The pivotal events occur in 1940, when Juliet Armstrong at 18, is recruited for the war effort.
(loc 152)It was a terrible place really, but she was predisposed  towards it.
(loc 277)And one final quote.Juliet felt rather ashamed, as her mind had been on  what dress to wear this evening rather than bottomless  pits of evil.
(loc 945)I believe these samples give an idea of the spark behind the prose of this novel.Atkinson provides an interesting Author’s Note outlining the inspirations and sources used before imagination and artistic license took over.
So I was absolutely convinced that dropping all my reading commitments to immediately pick up Kate Atkinson's new WWII spy novel would help raise my spirits.
I don't recall her other novels being so peppered with asides in parenthesis not to mention the Greek chorus like repetition of text from earlier in the story.
Was Atkinson trying to show that spy craft was relentlessly dull and often pointless ?.
The two books share some overlap in a setting of post-war London and espionage as a critical driver however in all other respects they could not be more stylistically opposed.
PLease see full review on my blog.I wasn't a fan of Kate Atkinson's Life After Life and was hesitant to try this, but after seeing the praises I couldn't resist the temptation of asking the publisher for a copy.This is a book that will take you to 40's and 50's, it's quintessentially British in all levels.
I haven't read a more satirical, sharp, enjoyable book that takes place in WW2 so far.
Thanks for Penguin for sending me a copy of this book.
The book gained no extra authenticity whatsoever from making it sound as if they were all eating someone called Vera (Faith!) in an endearing form!Q:I was beginning to think that you were lost.’‘But now I am found,’ (c)Q:‘Joy is an admirable goal,’ Juliet said.
Juliet was almost thirty and didn’t feel she needed much more improvement.
(c)Q:Juliet supposed that any one of those things – the war, philosophy, Vienna – was capable of making you both forlorn and earnest, and perhaps badly dressed too ...
Juliet sighed and wondered if one day she would think herself to death.
I had a sense of déjà vu through much of the novel, as if I had seen a documentary about the events Atkinson was writing about- essentially a secret service operation set up in a flat eavesdropping on the conversations of a motley crew of Nazi sympathisers in the flat next door.
Everyone is living double or even triple lives, one of Atkinson's favourite themes.
Atkinson perhaps could have dug a lot deeper on this theme.
Twenty pages from the end it delivers what for me was a thoroughly unconvincing twist and the novel suddenly becomes messily entwined with a very real and familiar part of British history.
How she does it I do not know.In Transcription she takes us to 1940 World War 2 London, where we meet Juliet, an eighteen year old girl who has just been recruited by MI5.
There is a lot more to this Juliet than meets the eye and she continued to surprise me right through to the end of the book.Atkinson writes splendid characters, especially the eccentric and bumbling upper class British.
I felt as though I was living and breathing London along with Juliet, Perry (poor Perry!) and the rest.It was so good that I am sorely tempted to go back and reread the Jackson Brodie series, where I discovered Kate Atkinson in the first place.
And then he was on his feet, pointing at the sky and saying, 'Look, a sparrowhawk!'Was that it then?ABOUT THIS BOOK: In 1940, eighteen-year old Juliet Armstrong is reluctantly recruited into the world of espionage.
MY THOUGHTS: If I could be any writer in the world, I would wish to be Kate Atkinson.
After Case Histories and One Good Turn, it was her third novel to feature the former private detective Jackson Brodie, who makes a welcome return in Started Early, Took My Dog. DISCLOSURE: I own my copy of Transcription by Kate Atkinson, published by Doubleday.
But it does have the one Atkinson trademark, where you finish it feeling like you've read a fancy literary novel while still indulging in real genre thrills.We start in 1950 where Juliet is moving towards spinsterhood with a rather dull job producing children's educational radio shows for the BBC.
It starts out as dull work but soon Juliet is roped into taking on a larger role in the operation.
It's not just a suspenseful spy novel, it's building a whole world for Juliet to live in, which makes the spy part work even better.
In not a big fan of spy novels, just not my genre, so maybe that was my problem with this book. I really expected to be blown away because, after all, it IS Kate Atkinson, but I never really connected with the main character, or any other character. I truly didn't care what happened to them, and it felt like only half my brain was engaged while reading. Having said that, there were some surprising twists and turns at the end, but, again, I just didn't care.
I loved this World War II British espionage thriller!
In 1940, Juliet Armstrong is recruited by MI5 to transcribe recorded meetings between undercover MI5 agents and traitorous British citizens who are secretly spying for Germany.
England is on the brink of war as Hitler’s forces consume Europe.
Juliet is eventually drawn into active spy duty, playing a role as a young German sympathizer working in the War Office.
Her job is to infiltrate the Right Club, a small group of antisemitic and fascist sympathizers within the British establishment.
I loved the 1940 storyline the best - wonderful characters and a glimpse into wartime England.
A Kate Atkinson spy novel set during World War II sounded like a winning formula to me.
Years later Juliet is working for the BBC when she starts to receive anonymous notes, saying "You will pay for what you did." Just what did she get up to during the war and is her past about to catch up with her?Atkinson has clearly done an immense amount of research for this novel.
But I also think that the story lacks the emotional heft that is a hallmark of Atkinson's best work.
This book is a wonderful mix of spies, counterspies, life in wartime London and the inner workings of the BBC.
It's written from the point of view of Juliet Armstong, an intelligent young woman who was recruited by the British Security Service when she was 18.
After the war, Juliet worked at the BBC, until her past caught up with her.
The beginning of the book was a little confusing because the author hopped around among several time periods.
I haven't always liked this author's books, but I enjoyed this one very much.
I received a free copy of this book from the publisher.
4.5 starsKate Atkinson's new novel, Transcription, follows Juliet Armstrong as she works in an obscure MI-5 department during World War 2 that monitors and records the activities of a pro-German group.
Fast forward a decade later, and Juliet is now working for a BBC radio station believing that her past is long behind her.
However, as Juliet soon learns, actions almost always have consequences whether the effect is immediate or doesn't surface until a decade or more later.
The fact that it is authored by Kate Atkinson was probably the only thing that motivated me to read it in the first place.The novel opens in 1981, “the year of a royal wedding,” with 60-year-old Juliet Armstrong falling down on a London street.
Juliet will eventually become a full-fledged spy herself.It’s quite a long time since I’ve read an Atkinson novel and I really don’t recall her writing being so fluffy and flippant.
I feel a certain sadness at leaving behind a once-favourite author, but I didn’t like A God in Ruins either.
The pace is sedate yet entirely compelling, Juliet is incredibly engaging and the lines between fact and fiction blur into one addictively riveting tale.Transcription is a literary delight, a tranquil pond in the middle of a storm, often unexpected, emotionally resonant and pitched perfectly throughout.
I loved it, the ending had me teary eyed and this is one of those books where I know I will miss those fictional yet honestly authentic characters for months to come.Magic.
Highly Recommended.
Transcription is the fourth stand-alone novel by award-winning British author, Kate Atkinson.
In 1940, eighteen-year-old Juliet Armstrong finds herself recruited into the Secret Service.
But there were some incidents about which Juliet doesn’t like to think too much, and when the war ends, she’s not sorry to leave it all behind.
Five years later, Juliet is working for the BBC producing children’s programs when a face from the past appears: the man who posed as the Gestapo contact passes her in the street.
We’re not approaching the end of a novel, Miss Armstrong.’” Another Atkinson masterpiece.
[2.6] Most of this novel is analogous to Juliet's transcription work for M15 - dull and monotonous with brief moments of action. Most of the action came in the last 50 pages of the novel and I was so grateful for relief of the tedium that I am rounding up to 3 stars.
Who knew that spycraft could be so boring?
Atkinson’s historical fiction novel is based on a composite of actual double-agents that worked for MI5 during WWII to uncover Third Reich devotees.
Eighteen-year-old Juliet takes a job of transcribing conversations that are being recorded from bugs in the next room.
Atkinson feels compelled to provide the reader with typical disjointed conversations—bugs in the 1940s were not able to pick up as much as ones today.
But, Juliet shines at this task.
It is not long before Juliet attends societal events whereby she can spy on women fascist sympathizers herself.
I tried....I really, really tried. I hung in there 'til the halfway mark but I'm packing it in. Such a disappointment as I've enjoyed other books by this author & heard rave reviews about this one. It's probably just a simple mismatch between reader & book. Not finishing a book always makes me feel like I missed something but I wasn't enjoying myself & with so many other books to read, I'm waving the white flag. On to the next one....
3.5 starsA low key, at times almost boring spy novel. I seem to be incapable of not liking a Kate Atkinson book though. I love her books for their immersive historical background, humor and vividness of characters.
“Who spies on the spies...?” I love a good spy novel and this one was a good one, even if it did have a bit of a slow start.Juliet Armstrong, a young woman with no family, finds herself recruited into M15, the UK’s domestic counter-intelligence and security agency.
Other characters weave in and out of her life and soon it’s obvious that it’s not a good idea to trust that anyone is who they say they are.It was a nice change to read a WWII novel that did not have anything to do with the concentration camps.
It also had some of her funniest lines and I often found myself laughing aloud (not something one generally experiences while reading a book set during war time) Juliet was an interesting narrator, very real and believable.
Atkinson’s themes of identity, spying, and the challenges of moving on in the years after the war also made me think of Michael Ondaatje’s new book War Light which recently read (also on audiobook).
War Light though begins in the years immediately after the war and tries to piece together the mysterious lives of people during the war.
[Happy sigh.] It's a new Kate Atkinson historical novel. It should (and does) have🔹a resourceful, witty Shakespeare-quoting heroine whom other people underestimate 🔹London🔹World War II homefront🔹the Blitz🔹one sister, aunt, mother, or friend who's hell on wheels🔹flashbacks to more than one era🔹intrigue🔹dogs🔹second-generation feminism🔹ironic wordplay, clever tropes, and quotes that are repeated at key points. 🔹dead-on accurate verbal snapshots of vanished fashion, architecture, technology, and manners. 🔹at least one (view spoiler)[dead body (hide spoiler)] hidden away 🔹should be read at least twice to get the most out of it. Time to reread!["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>
Uugh, I haven't felt so tortured and bored by by book since I tried to read Hausfrau.9731 ratings and 4113 are 3 stars or less. Halfway through I had to look through them for some closure and encouragement to let this one go. My day is about to get better.
