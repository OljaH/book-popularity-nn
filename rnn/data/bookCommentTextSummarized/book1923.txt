Too many whole sale changes in this edition for this to be considered Capablanca's book what was done to it was an abomination.Anyone who wants to read his classic text from 1921 should get the Cadogan Chess edition ISBN 1857440730 or even the Mckay edition for $5 used.
The book is simple, clear and easy to follow, though you'll need a chessboard to play out all the sequences yourself to fully appreciate what's being discussed.
Capablanca even makes a gesture of modesty by graciously including examples from games he lost (which were very few).
Capablanca was at the peak of his powers, and yet with this book you can follow any of his games and feel as though you would have made the very same moves he did.
If you can already play to a reasonable standard, then this book may not feel so useful.
There are basically 3 versions of this book in English.The old one, which this appears to be, in descriptive notation.
I don't care for descriptive notation, but I have a copy of the old version to double check text against the newer versions.
(Chess Fundamentals)The "Revised" version, where both the descriptive notation has been replaced with algebraic (thank you!) and some the text and some of Capablanca's game analysis has been removed or changed.
(Chess Fundamentals, Revised)The other algebraic edition, which simply replaces the descriptive notation but does not change any of the text.
(Chess Fundamentals Algebraic)I prefer the third version.
Written by Jose Raul Capablanca, one of the greatest chess players in the history, almost 100 years ago, it remains a classic that every chess player should read.
Of course, we can not judge a chess book written a century ago by the contemporary standards because chess progressed a lot meanwhile.
Capablanca's book reflects the best understanding of chess 100 years ago.
After going through such junk commentary, mostly obtained by running the last chess engine and falsely claimed to reflect the evaluation during the game, the amateur is confused.
In contrast, Capablanca's commentary is fair, sincere and mostly reflects his thoughts during the games.
This book is an important window into the mind of a World Chess Champion and one of few chess players in the conversation as greatest of all time. De Firmian includes many instructive modern games to show progression of chess beyond the life of Capablanca.
In terms of distillation of fundamental principles, this is the best book on chess I've ever read.
He comprehensively covers all of the important points for a new chess player to learn without going into too much depth.The great thing about a concise book is that the reader learns by doing.
It is left up to the reader to use his chess board to go over the variations, and Capablanca gives exactly enough information for us to figure out the relevance of each move.
It is the reader's responsibility to study on his own, as the author has not written a 500 page book doing it for us.There were perhaps a few more positions than needed to really be considered as concise as possible without lacking information, but that extra practice does help.

Capablanca was a chess grandmaster, one of the great chess players and this is his book of basic strategy. This book originally was owned by my mother; she taught herself how to play primarily by using this book, then taught me--and we went on to destroy the enemy! Er... I mean to enjoy playing the game with many others. It explains first principles such as good openings, controlling the center, attacking and cutting off pieces and good endgame strategies. A well-written, very useful guide accessibly for a beginner.
The great guide to master the fundamentals of chess, simple to follow and a very wide variety of principles, from game openings to middle games to end games plus some illustrated games of the greatest players there ever was.
A classic, but what I remember is a long combination nobody would be able to repeat.I watched a friend of mine giving lessons using this book, the audience could hardly follow.I wander to whom this book could benefit.
I feel 100 times smarter after doing each set of exercises. Then I forget to pick up the book for a few weeks and realize I forgot all those awesome lessons I just learned.
Read 143 pages.
I'd have to read this book 5+ times to get everything. So simply put together but so thorough too. Not to mention modest.
I enjoyed this but it was way too complex to be labeled a fundamentals book. I'm going to have to look somewhere else as a starting point.
a classic.
