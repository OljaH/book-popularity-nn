Some businessmen realized it was a profitable idea to make publications consisting almost entirely of such ads.
Basically it stated that a very rich heiress got tired of people around her and wanted to meet a simple country lad unspoiled by big money.
The guy had no clue about the identity of the girl so he had to come to Perry Mason asking him to find her and protect from a potential lawsuit.
Mason found the girl fairly quickly, but at the same time he realized that she was not kidding when she said about being rich.
THE CASE OF THER LONELY HEIRESS.
I am an heiress with a comfortable fortune coming to me.
Will some personable young man between the ages of 23 and 40 write to tell me he knows how I feel?
Also, when you write, tell me something about your background.
Communicate with me at Box 96, care of this magazine.”This sounds pretty straightforward, but it leads to a case of inheritance fraud, and, ultimately murder and other crimes.
Follow this case with Mason.
It’s a straightforward situation, with few of the confusions usual with Gardner’s writing.
#31 in the Perry Mason series.
The entree to the mystery is a minor plot wherein Perry represents the sleazy publisher of a lonely hearts magazine.
An advertiser in the magazine is the Heiress of the title and she soon becomes Perry's client as she hopes to remain an heiress.
Good, solid entertainment.Perry Mason series - Perry is defending a client who has been framed, and Perry engages in a few unorthodox practices to protect his client.
The client anticipates inheriting wealth from her mother who had nursed a sick man.
Murder enters within the confines of this thick plot.
Upon re-reading... I'll keep it at 4 stars. Totally enjoyable installment in the Perry Mason series, but a bit lackluster in its big reveal. Perry figured out the score based on a much smaller clue (and really only one) than he normally spots, so it felt a bit fantastic. But still great! Lots of suspects, though a fairly linear plot. This is one of the many instances (many being subjective) where Perry gets to play cupid a bit, as well as defense attorney extraordinaire.
Found this at the Hood Canal cabin and read it all on Saturday - perfect down to the trashy illustration on the cover (not shown here). Lots of '40s slang to read out loud in a Broadway Baby voice: "Looks like he's trying to cut himself a piece of cake - with a chisel." "For the moment, that leaves us behind the eightball."
Okay, so it's not ground-breaking literature, but I like these. I enjoy trying to figure out what clues the author has left for Perry to use in the courtroom (the clues the police missed!). Sometimes I do actually wish for the client to be guilty...this was one of those, but I always know that's not going to happen.
The twist at the end was good.One of the few books where Gardner has been more open about the relationship between Della and Perry.

A lonely heiress puts out a personal ad in a magazine and then ignores all the replies. Enter Perry Mason and, hot on his heels, an arrest for murder.Gardner's most famous lawyer must prove that his client is innocent and is willing to call on all his skills to prove the police wrong.
Are all Perry Masons this boring?I had liked all the Gardner I had read up to this point, but this was pretty tedious. I mean, folded laundry plays a key role in the plot. Folded laundry!Chandler this ain't.
Ingenious plotting and a cracking denouement. Vintage Gardner!
Loved it!
Rose was one of the witnesses when George Endicott signed the will that made Marilyn the primary beneficiary.
Marilyn is the primary suspect to Rose’s murder and of course Perry Mason, Della Street and Paul Drake are all in the middle of the action.
Since Robert also appears to be involved in an attempt to attract Marilyn, and does not hesitate to support his wife’s lie, there is no shortage of prime suspects.
As is the case in the best Mason stories, the guilty party is not the primary suspect, but you were given some clues along the way as to the identity of the murderer.
I bought this paperback potboiler Perry Mason mystery at a library used book sale.
I paid $1.00 for it, yet it originally sold for 95 cents new and a "50 cent" price is stamped in the front, indicating it must have been acquired as a used book in the past.
Oh well, it was to benefit a wonderful local library!
This copy was originally published in 1958, first copyrighted in 1948, before even *I* was born.
This one couldn't hold my attention.
I was reading the first edition, and it was in terrible shape: the paper was so brittle it would tear without the gentlest page turning, much faded, spotted and stained.
Several con games being juggled to shift the blame to a young heiress and con her out of her inheritance and to also lay blame on her for murdering a friend.
At the end, Paul and Della take the young lady, and one of Paul Drake's operatives (who has a crush on her) to the Ice Follies.
The Ice Follies.
My God a more innocent time.
Read the Perry Mason novel "The Case of the Lonely Heiress" by Erle Stanley Gardner.
Not one of his best novels.Mason sounds like an amateur detective who has no idea on things happening around him in this novel and not his usual confident, brilliant self.
He seems to have no discerning ability that is so his style.
The amateur detective work occupies nearly 3/4 th of the book.
Even the court scenes that ensues is not much of a breather.
The court scenes in Perry Mason novels are mostly breath taking in its brilliance, but not this one.
An overall disappointment.Rating: 2/5.
This book gets 3 stars solely for the verve of Erle Stanley Gardner's writing and pacing. The dialog is witty and there's never a dull moment in this intriguing set-up. What a shame, then, that the denouement is so poorly contrived. The bit about packing was clever, but everything else about the howdunnit was so tortuous and contrived that it's little wonder I forgot I'd read this book till nigh on the end. Great for characters and setting, but a fairly disappointing mystery at its heart.
Ah, it was a different age, wasn't it? This one, written some 15 years after the first one, does not immediately bring to mind Raymond Burr and the cast of the TV show. It still reads like a radio script, but Perry Mason comes off as a smart aleck, younger, somehow, than he was at first. I'm finished with this particular exploration of the past. Not bad, but there are better out there.
This plot was Farley straightforward. The end fooled me but was the only logical solution.
3.5Great stuff, definitely missed this growing up. Trying to catch up now.
My Rating System:* couldn't finish, ** wouldn't recommend, *** would recommend, **** would read again, ***** have read again.
Перри Мейсон в очередной раз крутой красавчик и вообще супер мужчина, который не только первоклассный адвокат, но защитник всех и всего, а особенно своих клиентов. Люблю, читаю и буду читать дальше.
