In fact, I think this is what Scott really wanted the reader to feel towards their romance, he wanted the reader to feel Locke’s love and pain towards Sabetha and I can’t help but feel there’s a subliminal message to Locke and Sabetha’s romance that were based on Scott’s divorce during the time of writing this book.
It provides a huge amount of depth to Locke Lamora and The Gentleman Bastards and I personally think it’s amazing how Scott created all three books with different settings and main plots surrounding the same main characters yet they’re all great to read.
4/5  “False names are fun,” said Calo. “Call me Beefwit Smallcock.”  **this review contains mass amounts of quotes and fanart because I'm so inlove with these books and can't get enough. You have been warned**This is a tough review for me to write, mainly because I really love this series and consider it a favorite, so I had high expectations for this novel.

You have been warned**This is a tough review for me to write, mainly because I really love this series and consider it a favorite, so I had high expectations for this novel.
I love him “Touch either of my children again,” said Chains in a tone of voice unlike anything Locke had ever heard, “and I’ll break you into so many fucking pieces not a whore in the city will ever be able to figure out which wrinkled scrap to suck.” Seriously I'm so glad we had the flashbacks, if it wasn't for the Sanza twins and the whack shit they say, I swear I wouldn't have been able to finish this novel.
“You want a lesson, boy? If you find yourself being born, climb back in as quick as you can, because life’s a bottomless feast of shit.” And isn’t that the truth? Locke Lamora has been through hell, and his life is about to get even more messy. After dealing with a dreaded Bondmagi in the Lies of Locke Lamora, and somehow surviving, Locke has found himself on borrowed time after his experience in Red Seas Under Red Skies.Pumping through his veins is a deadly poison. It is slowly eating away at
Sounds like the end of his thieving days until someone very unexpected offers him a deal in exchange for his life.
It became even more interesting as the sub-plot (how Locke and Sabetha first became romantically involved) is told along with it.
I stormed through this book as I wanted to see how the past shaped the future.
Locke loves Sabetha, and he understands that she needs space and time, but what he struggles to understand is the fact that she is his equal as a thief.
Time will bring them back together again, though I don’t think things will ever work out the way Locke wants.
So DOOMED, I say again, and then I fall on a heap on the floor because The Thorn of Emberlain doesn't come out till April and I'm suuuuuuffering with the waiting.(NOTE: the cliffhanger isn't actually as bad as the last book's.)(NOTE #2: that doesn't stop me hungering for the next one so so badly that I'm climbing my bookshelf and screeching at the moon.)(NOTE #3: status rabid-fan-level-10 acquired)A BRIEF RUNDOWN OF THE CONTENTS OF THIS BOOK:• it features politics because they get hired to rig an election• it's also aaaaaall about Bonds Mages again!
Before long they have been swept up by the Bondsmagi and forced into another heist filled with deception and trickery.The narrative switches between the present day, and flashbacks to when the Gentleman's Bastards were young and given an important task by father chains, to become part of a group of players, and learn to work together.We finally get to meet Sabetha in this book - which is great as we'd heard so much about her in the first two books.
Her on/off relationship with Locke kept me on edge, particuarly when it turns out that Sabetha had also been hired by the Bondsmagi to compete against Locke and Jean.With all the double crossing and secret keeping we have come to expect from Locke Lamora, there is plenty to keep the reader interested.
If she's the reason Locke is both obsessed with and wary of red-heads, I want to know who she is.
If saying 'What would Sabetha think of you, right now?' can shock Locke out of a depressed stupor, I want to know why.
I want to know who the frick this woman is to be able to make the Bastard a gibbering mess of self-pity.Locke's match in skill and wit?
We know for sure that Locke finds her attractive.
We know that she's a genius (a freaking MATCH IN WITS with our dear Locke).
In The Republic of Thieves, we have a full book of interlude flashbacks that contain all the original members of the gentleman bastard… include Sabetha!The flashback this time dealt, at first, with how Locke and Sabetha first met – how Locke was such a little school-boy trying to talk to and impress her – to suddenly everyone goes to a theatre pretending to be actors to start in the play, The Republic of Thieves.In The Republic of Thieves, the framework of the past operates around Locke and Sabetha's shared history, while the present is a competition over elections in a foreign country, the Bondsmagi's backyard.
Gentleman Bastards books are special and unforgettable to me for a good reason: Mr. Lynch used a strong, fun storyline that kept me hooked.
The main star of this novel is the political intrigue and the Bastards do it nicely with their sly and shrewd characters to run the show.I really enjoyed the past and present relationship between Locke and Sabetha (at last!).
Luv ya gurl <3 There was a darker shade that played in the relationship between Locke and Sabetha, and it was really interesting to see the differences between the past and present, as I could watch the growth of the main characters.
At least until I got fed up with both storylines.)The bit concerning events of the past focuses on the time before Locke Lamora became a masterful, thieving mastermind.
It’s more about characters (namely Sabetha and Locke) and their past vs.
So I don’t like Sabetha, yet she’s an enjoyable interesting enough character.
One of the things redeeming that book, I'd say.A fair warning – I don’t recommend reading  The Republic of Thieves  before getting through previous parts.
It was almost as if she lived to spoil a good thing (disclaimer: I don't need to like characters to enjoy reading about them, so I've survived.
2.5*- 3* RTCI was in love with the first book in the series, The Lies of Locke Lamora.
I loved the characters, the cussing, the banter between the characters, the dark side of Locke’s mind, even the never ending world building.
Still, the plot was interesting, Locke and Jean were as fun as ever and the ending did not disappoint.
I postponed reading it because I was expecting a fail based on my friends reviews and the author’s state of mind when he wrote the novel.
In short and spoiler free, Locke and Jean are hired (coerced) by half of the Bondsmagi to help them win/rig an election between two parties.
German Review on GosureviewsAfter 6 years I expected a better story.
Sabetha, teased in the previous two books, turns out to be a very weak and shallow character.
One of the main plot lines, their "love story" just doesn't work.
They don't really have any chemistry together and later in the book I actually got annoyed whenever they had a scene together.
It started very strong, but the main story was utterly boring and predictable, so much that I had a hard time finishing the book.
The end made up for it a little though.
Finally I sit down to write a thoughtful (let's say, trying to) review of the book.This is just the best book yet on Locke and Jean.
I love how we get to see a lot more of the Bondismage - the book reveals a lot and infers there is much more to know about the mages and about Locke.
But is it all truthful?Also, this is the first time we really experience and get to know Beth.
Finally we see Locke and Beth and their magnetic interaction.
We are back on track!!!I don’t have time for a super in depth review but let’s just say that some of the magic that was lost for me in Red Seas over Red Skies is now back again.
Part of the reason is the flashbacks to when Locke and Jean were kids running scams and seeing Sabatha when she was part of their team.
The other reason is Sabatha now.
You are either going to love her or hate her but I love her and I love Locke’s reactions to her.
“I’m, uh, going up to the room … to ge
Part of the reason is the flashbacks to when Locke and Jean were kids running scams and seeing Sabatha when she was part of their team.
The other reason was the competition between Sabatha, Locke and Jean.
I loved the games that they played with each other as Locke and Jean are pitted against Sabetha.
It seemed like he had a clear idea where his story was going and I loved the journey that he took me on.
You’re obviously in a mood.” “Am I?” There was danger in her tone.
"You're trying to be charming again," she said softly, "but I choose not to be charmed, Locke Lamora." Long last, after three hefty books, we finally meet Locke's lost love, Sabetha Belacoros.Quick crash course for those with short-term memory loss: Sabetha was a Gentleman Bastard and is hinted to be romantically involved with Locke, and then left for some unknown reason. Locke still loves her, but is slightly bitter about it. That's from the first two books. In this one, we finally meet the el
Long last, after three hefty books, we finally meet Locke's lost love, Sabetha Belacoros.Quick crash course for those with short-term memory loss: Sabetha was a Gentleman Bastard and is hinted to be romantically involved with Locke, and then left for some unknown reason.
If Gentleman Bastards is ever made into a movie or TV series, it will be Sabetha's "You know nothing, Jon Snow."I have mixed feelings on the ending.
He died trying to bring his wife back to life, who had red hair, and basically confirms Sabetha's worst fears, that Locke loves her because she's an object, not a person.
Crooked Warden, Nameless Thirteenth, guide Scott Lynch’s pen swiftly through Locke Lamora’s next daring adventure.
It felt more like a PG-13 version of an R rated movie … and only because of the swearing … which was great, but not enough to carry the story along.The Republic of Thieves isn’t a trainwreck by any means; more like a lazy hayride when I was expecting a roller coaster.
A good 300 pages of this book deals with (view spoiler)[Locke/Jean’s political competition with Sabetha, who incidentally is annoying as hell.
(hide spoiler)]Locke just seemed a bit "whipped" by Sabetha, and it got old fast.http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/g...If The Lies of Locke Lamora had been structured like this book I probably would have passed on the entire series.
Blessed is the one who aids a thief, hides a thief, revenges a thief, and remembers a thief, for they shall inherit the night.   I used to think of the Gentleman Bastard series as a mediocre series, but this third instalment finally managed to impress me. Action wise, this had quite a few. Not enough to fully impress me, but quite adequate to keep things interesting. This novel felt more like a character development novel for Locke and the ever mysterious Sabetha.So we finally get to know who
I really liked Father Chains in the fist novel, and it's quite refreshing to read more of him in the third one.
Locke and Jean will always be one of my favorite characters in the fantasy genre.Plot wise, this one kind of lost its track.
I would've hated this because of that, but Locke and Sabetha's story was just really interesting to read about.
The way the romance was written is not the typical cliche romance of two characters you mostly read about.
Of the three novels currently published, this is the only one that managed to really impress me.
I love the Locke and Jean bromance.
What I did absolutely love from this book was the backstory Interludes which brought the reader back to Locke's much younger days in Camorr - hence, the joy of having Chains and the Sanza twins back among the pages again.
The main reason for this period of backstory was to introduce Sabetha, the mysterious lady love of Locke Lamora.
If I'm asked to describe Jean with one word, it will be - solid!The mystery behind Locke's true identity was also revealed in this book.
Of the three books in the Gentleman Bastard series (Will there ever be any more?) I liked this one least.
I really loved meeting Sabetha finally, and seeing Locke and her past.
I also loved that we get more information on Locke's mysterious past.
I wish this one had kept up the same sense of urgency and suspense that the first two books had though.
I wasn't as captivated by the plot because this one focused so much on Locke and Sabetha's perpetually strained relationship.
I'm looking forward to what will happen in the future of the series if the forth book ever comes out.
Very much focused on the relationship between Locke and Sabetha, there were plenty of shenanigans to keep readers entertainedThe flashbacks may be a bit dry for some readers, despite plenty of the usually scheming large sections were still spent dealing with the workings of the theatre and the play being performed.
But be clear, it is just one more way she is the perfect counterpart to Locke, no stranger to sudden mood shifts, brooding, and anger himself.Yes, Sabetha will be a nice addition to future books, as long as the formulaic nature of their interactions is changed up a bit next time around.
An unedited preview of the first 5500 words of the Republic of Thieves can be read here. Publication has also been pushed back to September, 2013.I'm sorry all you gentlemen bastards, but now we wait.
As usual the worldbuilding is great. You really want to be a part of this world, the scents, the buildings, the people. The pace is a lot slower than the rest of the series and I found this one not quite as enjoyable as the prequels, but still a very good book.
Quit being so hard on yourself. We are what we are; we love what we love. We don't need to justify it to anyone... not even to ourselves.  Yes. You are absolutely correct, Locke. So no matter how unhappy I am with this installment, no matter how lovesick you were with Sabetha, no matter how thinner this book's plot is compared with the first two, no matter how bored I felt when Patience is talking, I am still giving this four stars, because gods damn it, I am so biased when it comes to Lynch's
If you wanted the scheming Locke fixated on a good haul, well then, better re-read the first two books.
The Republic of Thieves sets the stage for the future books' plotlines.
All in all, it's not that bad, but even the enlightenment of Sabetha's character is not enough for Republic of Thieves to be out of The Lies of Locke Lamora and Red Seas Under Red Skies' shadow.***July 17, 2013 Edit***WHAT?!Some goodreaders have ARCs already!!!!
Dying of envy here, people.It's time for a re-read, gentlemen.***End of edit***Crooked Warden, it's Sabetha.
Seeing as this is the 3rd book in a series, I don't want to say too much about the plot.
I will say that I enjoyed this one much more than Red Seas Under Red Skies but still not quite as much as the first book The Lies of Locke Lamora.
I appreciate that we *finally* got to learn more about Sabetha, and the flashbacks in this book, YOU GUYS, the flashbacks were SO good.
And as always, Locke & Jean are the ultimate BroTP (pretty sure I used that in my review of book 2, but it's true!
It was hilarious, as all the books in this series are.

full review...The Republic of Thieves is yet another outstanding and highly entertaining continuation of the witty, highly sarcastic and definitely R17-rated series Gentleman Bastards!4 ½ StarsAgain, Scott Lynch had me on the floor belly up laughing for most of the series, and trust me ‘The Republic of Thieves’ was just as fun as the previous 2 entries in the series!
Lynch has a delightful warped imagination, and he creates a world of thievery, magic, romance and betrayal in ‘Republic of Thieves’ The story picks up right where we left off from the 2nd book.
He is able to use sarcasm, very R-17 rated fun, magic and deep rooted emotions all to break away the tension of previous book.
I generally start with a first installment and even if I like it, I don’t usually continue with the series for a long time, if ever.
One good thing about Scott Lynch’s series is that that each installment of ‘Gentleman Bastard’ is set in a different location, so it never seems while reading that one is prodding through well-known grounds.
While not better than ‘The Lies of Locke Lamora’, this book is definitely better than ‘Red Seas Under Red Skies’.The backstory has its own benefits as well, as we are again entertained by characters like Calo, Galdo and Chains along with some new and interesting ones.
Without any doubts Gentleman Bastards is one of my favourite series to date even though from instalment to instalment it steadily goes down the slope with the full quintuple fuckdamn of stars for The Lies of Locke Lamora , three and a half star aboard for the Red Seas Under Red Skies and three very conflicted stars here.
In terms of the Sabetha-Locke affair, the interludes were clumsily done with loads of unnecessary details and as such they read more like a prequel than the genius intervals of the first instalment.
god the flashbacks."Here's to politics," said Sabetha.
Also, (view spoiler)[thirteen gods bless the Falconer.
(hide spoiler)] Never EVER thought I would say that.After the first book, I know I'd be a fool to NOT be wary of the Bondsmagi, any of them.
But the gig that runs the majority of the book honestly could not have kept my interest without the addition of Sabetha.
Honestly I didn't see a point to the whole thing -- was it ever explained WHY they had to win one way or the other, and what it would affect?
I was really glad for the decision to go back to the past-interlude-flashback things; origin stories are my lifeblood.["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>
[5 Stars] I love this series.
I had some issues with this book here and there, and at times some of the characters, mainly Sabetha, frustrated me.
I cannot, however, give this book anything less than 5 stars.
I love all of the back story we get and the world building and the relationship building and the character development and goodness it makes me want more.
I may do a full review of this book at some point, but as of right now I just want to say if you love fantasy and have yet to start this series you really need to drop everything and do such.
Locke and Jean are back, and as if dying from poison wasn't inconvenient enough, trouble soon finds our pair and throws them into a new game - this time into the very heart of Bonds Magi territory - The Republic of Carthain.This book we get two main story arcs - one taking us back to Camorr where we get more of Father Chains and and the Sanza brothers - very cool.
OMG I HAZ THIS!!!
