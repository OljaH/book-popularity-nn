And Lazlo—once a faranji dreamer and a war orphan of Zosma—is now confronted with the truth of him being the half-human son of a god, blessed with the same power that had been Weep’s curse for fifteen years.Now the scales have a heavy weight on them: Minya’s anger like a canker at the center of everything, dancing them around a chessboard, and Sarai and Lazlo’s hearts are things edged with the fear of it, every sweet moment spent together not really theirs, but just borrowed for a little while.
ARC provided by Hachette in exchange for an honest review.1.) Strange the Dreamer ★★★★★  “I would have chosen you, if they had let me choose.”  Strange the Dreamer was my favorite book of 2017, and Muse of Nightmares is probably going to be my favorite book of 2018. These two books just bring so much love into my heart, and so much hope into my soul. I have no word combinations to ever begin to describe how much this book meant to me, or to do a review worthy of it, but I am going to try.   “Sar
Whenever I try to give a synopsis for Strange the Dreamer I always say it’s about a librarian who is in love with a lost city, and a girl who only wants to know what love is.
Lazlo, the librarian who has finally found the city that has taken over his heart and mind for his entire life, is going through the greatest amount of changes.If Strange the Dreamer is about finding the lost city of Weep, Muse of Nightmares is about why no one can remember the city in the first place.
Good little girls don’t kill. They die.And Minya was not a good little girl. I know a lot of us were expecting Muse of Nightmares to be good, but I have to say, this book actually exceeded my expectations. I have a lump in my throat and I can't stop thinking about it. I usually spend time making detailed notes while reading a book but, at one point, I opened Notes on my computer just to type "oh fucking god, this is so good".No spoilers, of course.

I usually spend time making detailed notes while reading a book but, at one point, I opened Notes on my computer just to type "oh fucking god, this is so good".No spoilers, of course.
The beginning opens by introducing us to two new characters - Kora and Nova - and their compelling story eventually becomes deeply-entwined with the main plot in ways that were unexpected, thrilling, and sad.If you are that sort of reader, this is definitely a crying book.
11-1-18 Look what came today!
I already showed Strange the Dreamer but I got Muse of Nightmares too through Illumicrate with Silver Sprayed Edges to go with the front of the book.
A dream journal, beautiful art work and a letter from the author and signed editions.
Just keep them coming!
♥Do y'all like my funko pop I made of Sarai?
I would liked to have made a better one but it's okay =)Listened to the audible first thing.
God, this book.
More thoughts later and pics of my not professionally made Funko!
Happy Reading!

Absolute perfection
Wow. I am in awe of Laini Taylor's ability to craft such a magical world, beautiful characters and fascinating plots. I loved every minute of this journey, and now that I've finished, I'm just so impressed by how the author tied up this series. WOW indeed.Now to reread this series again!
Once upon a time there was a silence that dreamed of becoming a song, and then I found you, and now everything is music. This is one of the most beautifully written books I have ever read. I am always mesmerized by how much emotion a single word can carry and Laini Taylor has honed that skill to perfection. Her writing is truly divine. Every time I read one of her books I never fail to notice that she uses words so perfectly that not a single phrase could have been written any better. Every sen
The characters are beautifully written and I love every single one of them from this world to the next and back.
His character is one of my favorite things about this series and even though so much happens in this book and the last he maintains a central role in the story which I absolutely loved.
This story takes place before that of Lazlo and Sarai and watching this story collide with ours in the present is breathtaking.I loved every single sentence in this book and will miss this series dearly.
I swear, every time I read a Laini Taylor book, I’m like “This one!
This one’s now my favourite!” xD How do her books just keep getting better and better?!!!While Strange the Dreamer was very character-driven, Muse of Nightmares was definitely more plot-driven.
I ended up loving every character (even ones I initially hated) and I couldn’t put it down when I got past the halfway mark.
It was SO ENGROSSING!!!
I also love how I wasn’t able to predict a single plot point.
Laini Taylor’s storytelling abilities are AMAZING!Needless to say, this is my favourite release of 2018.
RTC!
The need is real. So very real.
(view spoiler)[ Also Thyon just being like "I am not interested in women...I am important and have work to do" and then Ruza saying "ya you're a pretty napkin I wouldn't wipe my mouth on" and then them bOTH PAUSING.
10/10 am sure Ruza is going to wipe his mouth on Thyon The Napkin.
I think he's such a good representation of PTSD and I just ache for him but am also so proud!!• SUHEYLA: an actual queeeeeeen I love her so much (view spoiler)[SHE WILL FEED ALL THE CHILDREN CAKE.
I thought I could not review Strange the Dreamer properly because of how much I loved that book and though I did kinda manage to review it, I’m not even going to try with this one.
The reading experience I had with these books could be summed up in two words: healing and spiritual.I can’t wait to revisit this world and all it encompassed, but that’s for another time.
That’s all I’m going to say.
US cover is great and all but let's be real, UK cover..
Highly doubt it, because UK cover > US cover.

2nd read: Oct 2018 (audiobook)Ugh I just love this series SO MUCH.1st read: Sep 2018THIS WAS EVERYTHING I WANTED IT TO BE AND MORE. It honestly feels like my heart is going to explode. I LOVE THIS SERIES SO MUCH!!! It's pure ✨ MAGIC ✨Thank you so much to Hachette Australia for providing me with a copy!
‘once upon a time there was a silence that dreamed of becoming a song, and then i found you, and now everything is music.’ i am so enchanted with this story, which lives and breathes magic. ‘muse of nightmares’ is the inspiration for dreams and the home of beauty. it is the sequel i have been desperately waiting for. my love for ‘strange the dreamer’ came entirely from lazlo. he was such a delight. a reader, a dreamer, a man after my own heart. i loved following him on his journey and seeing hi
my love for ‘strange the dreamer’ came entirely from lazlo.
i wouldnt exactly say lazlo took a backseat in this, but there was a lot more to this book that took some of the attention away from him.
where ‘strange the dreamer’ was primarily character driven, ‘muse of nightmares’ was all about the world building and storytelling.
new characters and events were introduced, which played a pivotal role in how and why the world of weep is the way it is.
which i hope if the case, because i will always need lazlo, my dreamer, in my life.
Click here to watch a video review of this book on my channel, From Beginning to Bookend.  Once upon a time, there was a silence that dreamed of becoming a song, and then I found you, and now everything is music.* An aching, sumptuous, harrowing book. Muse of Nightmares is an exquisite dance of monsters and goddesses, mystery and romance, witchlight and wonder. More thoughts to come in my June Wrap Up. :D-*Note: Quote taken from an advanced reading copy.
WHEN DID THIS GET A COVER AND WHY DID NO ONE TELL ME?? Purple and silver are literally my favorite colors and this book will now match most of my wardrobe and my bedroom walls and this pleases me greatly.ALSO A RELEASE DATEI AM DECEASED -----------------------------Can we at least get a release date so I know how long I will be suffering?
4.5⭐There’re two things I wish could have been rewritten. Aside from that, Laini Taylor, I’m in awe.

If the UK cover isn't this exact shade of purple but in matte, I'm setting something on fire*added several months later*narrator: it was not, in fact, purple
I haven't quite decided yet.This is how you write a sequel - you introduce a set of new intriguing characters with an expansive history of their own, and link their journey with the story of Weep, and make the whole thing 10 times fuller and more brutal.Frankly, I hadn't been super excited to go back to the conflict at the end of Strange the Dreamer.
But then Laini opened Muse of Nightmares on a new world, with two wonderful sisters who love each other and want to escape their small lives, and I was hooked and didn't want to go back to Weep.
😭😭😭 I hate that I didn’t love this.
Laini Taylor has developed into one of my favourite authors over the years so I always go into her books with massively high expectations.
The story is fantastic and packed full of likeable and interesting characters and imaginative magic all told in a beautiful and engaging writing style.The story was super fun in this second instalment.
The best thing about this series for me is the characters.
It is so easy to empathise with and understand the motivations of pretty much every single character on all sides of the conflict and that is what makes the story such an emotionally compelling read.
This review and other non-spoilery reviews can be found @The Book PrescriptionActual Rating: 4.5 stars“Once upon a time there was a silence that dreamed of becoming a song, and then I found you, and now everything is music.” 🌟 I feel that the above quote describes my feelings toward this book, after so many disappointments this year, this book comes to change everything to music.🌟 There are good writers who has good writing styles but are not very good plotters (I have a certain author I like in mind).
Obviously, this had great writing, a great story, great characters great everything.🌟 I find it weird when someone asks me to describe Laini’s books, DOSAB has teeth, a thurible, angels, monsters and magic.
I've been waiting months for this sequel, and at some point, my son and I both synced October 2, 2018, on our calendars, as "D day". I. Kid. You. Not.So, it was no surprise to ANYONE ( except for hubby who actually thought we could have a meaningful conversation today *snorts*) that I've been glued to this mesmerizing and brilliantly crafted book, which appears to be even more perfect than its predecessor. Mind effing blown!
Strange the Dreamer was perfect and Muse of Nightmares does not let it down.Probably the most amazing part is the world Laini Taylor has created which just gets better and better as this book progresses.
All so good.The characters too are wonderful.
Lazlo of course is perfect, Sarai is amazing and Minya is totally menacing.
She also has the best character development in the book and a tremendous role to play.
This book needs to be a movie and Minya would provide the horror scenes.All round excellent.
This is why I love books.This here.
This freakishly beautiful book is an actual physical representation of everything I love about reading and books.I swear my heart grew wings and flew out of my chest.Dear god, I'm so in love right now!Right now I'm in one of those, what to do with my life now moments.I'm absolutely and utterly at a loss for words.Please, please please for whatever you hold dear in your life, read this book, I beg you.
I'll do anything if it gets you to read this.And Goodreads choice awards 2018, I see you there lurking and I have my pick :)
if I still can’t unsee how “Nightmares” is more squished than the other words, I’m taking everyone down with me
we have a blu-urb and OCTOBER SECOND WOO BOY💃🏻FUN FACT TIME: here's a Laini Taylor interview confirming that this series was set in the universe of Daughter of Smoke and Bone!// Strange the Dreamer - ★★★★
I feel as if my insides have been torn apart, only for that ending to fill me with a happiness so profound I can’t seem to stop smiling...*wipes tears* I want my ice cream now.What a gem. Truly.Full review to come!Thanks again to the best bookstore in the world, RJ Julia’s in Madison, CT for providing me with this most precious ARC, you guys made my year with this as it was one of my most anticipated reads in 2018!
