It's easy for a writer like Roald Dahl to produce novels for kids.
Probably it's the perfect mix of experience and imagination to constitute the perfect recipe for a successful writer.Vote: 7Scelto da mia figlia come lettura serale prima di andare "a nanna", questo libro ha subito ottenuto i favori della sua critica.
Deve essere semplice per uno scrittore come Roald Dahl scrivere romanzi per ragazzi.
Perfino la sua vita prende la forma di uno stravagante romanzo per ragazzi.
L'immaginazione è componente fondamentale per chi scrive, ma dopo questa lettura capisco che l'esperienza di vita non è da meno.

This novel consists of a myriad of short stories that centered on memorable events throughout Dahl's childhood.

The stories about doctor's visits and accidents were the most memorable - for they were described in  extremely explicit detail.
His time at boarding school was the inspiration for Matilda - abuse was rampart and there was little (if anything) that could be done.
I felt for the little Roald but the author did not write a pity-me memoir.
The children took this extremely seriously and wrote long (and complicated) assessments.Roald Dahl never grew up.

I love reading nonfiction, especially autobiographies.
This book was not just any autobiography but a book about Roald Dahl's childhood.
Growing up I loved the book Matilda and enjoyed James and the Giant Peach and the BFG and now as an adult I am making it my goal to read all his books.
I just set this goal a couple weeks ago and have read this book and The Giraffe and the Pelly and Me.Roald Dahl told fascinating stories about his childhood up the the age of 18.
I really enjoyed Roald's autobiography, that he swears wasn't one and I suggest it to anyone that enjoys him as a writer.
I mean there is a lot of pain here and it's so funny.Dahl is telling stories from his childhood.
All the horror of adults he tells come from his experience at school.
Teacher would single out students and yet he makes it all funny.
It was too short and probably a good thing.
I mean the Trunchbull from Matilda is right out of his experience.In the last chapter, I got tickled the most.
In British boarding school an older boy would have younger classmen under him that did chores and things for him and he was called a fag.
I mean, so funny sounding.
"I have no doubt at all that, thirty-five years later, when I was looking for a plot for my second book for children, I remembered those little cardboard boxes and the newly-invented chocolates inside them, and I began to write a book called Charlie and the Chocolate Factory."Another sweet story was when Dahl became homesick while he was away at school, and he decided to fake an appendicitis so he could return home for a few days.
Two hours of writing fiction leaves this particular writer absolutely drained.
(Deciding to re-read this book was inspired by the wonderful ladies at Gathering Books and their fantastic bimonthly meme‘Everything Dahl and Magical’. Which I absolutely adore. ) “When writing about oneself, one must strive to be truthful. Truth is more important than modesty. I must tell you, therefore, that it was I and I alone who had the idea for the great and daring Mouse Plot. We all have our moments of brilliance and glory, and this was mine.” I first read this glorious memoir aged twelv
BUT, if she had said that to me today I would have found a desk,  stood on it and, with my chest puffed out, I would have declared: “Roald Dahl is a historical figure because if Roald Dahl hadn’t written his books then British children’s fiction… nay, British fiction would have been far too bleak to tolerate.
And if making generation after generation fall in love with his writing doesn’t qualify him as a historical person then I don’t know what does.”But… like I said.Mumble.
Witnessing these glimmers of inspiration that lead him to write his beloved stories, all those years later, was definitely my favourite thing about this book.
This is a good little book - quite a historical artefact now as Dahl, writing in the mid-80s, talks about events which are taking place about 100 years ago from today. Hes a very clear, cutting writer, with plain yet highly original style. This is mostly because of he sticks to writing about what HE finds interesting - caning, for example, which is described over and over in great detail. As he says, he is revolted by it - especially luxuriating in describing the ritual his Repton headmaster wou
Elsewhere he describes his Norwegian heritage, the removal of his adenoids (at home, without anaesthetic) and a filthy-nailed sweetshop harridan.My favourite passage comes late in the book, when he compares the life of the businessman he was then - working for Shell - with the writer he would later be."The life of a writer is absolute hell compared with the life of a businessman.
Two hours of writing fiction leaves this particular writer completely drained.
It happens to be a fact that nearly every writer of fiction in the world drinks more whisky than is good for him.
One of the great authors of children's stories, Roald Dahl entertains readers with this piece that encompasses his life to age twenty.
The eldest son of two Norwegians, Dahl's early years were a mixture of pain (he lost his sister and father within a single week) and childhood frivolity (he loved to play with his school chums whenever time permitted).
In one vivid memory, Dahl recounts his love of sweets and a shopkeeper who had a hate-on for him, which led young Roald to concoct a plan to exact revenge, which backfired horribly.
I read this in year 7 for English and I loved it.
Me, I normally hate school books.
But this one was different, I really liked this one.
It was just so interesting.
I can still remember half the stuff that happened in the book.
That is how much it stuck with me.
I recommend this to fans of Roald Dahl and even non fans, this book is different from all his other work.
Good different...I still recommend it, the things that happen and how he describes it is just...
That is the only word to describe the book.Such a sparkly review...
This is the first instalment of Dahl’s autobiography – written with his customary wit, style and accessibility.
‘Boy’ provides an entertaining insight into Dahl's early years and upbringing.
Included here are some events that undoubtedly provided influence and ideas for some of his later novels.Minor quibble – in the edition I was reading, many of the facsimiles of excerpts from letters / reports etc.
from Dahl’s childhood were somewhat difficult to read due to the size of the writing and maybe would have benefited from being slightly larger copies of the originals?
Definitely well worth a read for all fans of Roald Dahl.
My interest in reading this novel was stimulated a few weeks ago when I visited some friends, one of whom over the course of the evening dug up his collection of Roald Dahl books and proceeded to reintroduce us the magic we had near forgetten we had experienced as children in reading them.
Enchanting were his recounts of visiting his Norwegian family on holidays as a child, the confusion of language barriers and cultural differences I'm sure inspired some of Dahls more eccentric characters - Mr Willy Wonka for instance.
"When writing about oneself, one must strive to be truthful. Truth is more important than modesty." Memoirs are always interesting.Roald Dahl's Boy: Tales of Childhood is an interesting book. It is about the eventful and adventurous childhood days of Roald Dahl. The book is written in a simple language, which makes this a good read, a delightful memoir.
Before this year, I'd never read any of Dahl's work, and when I picked this up I didn't realize that it was an autobiography.
She was definitely a strong and committed woman to do what she did for her family.
I definitely saw some influence on his stories here, which isn't surprising but was fun because it's like watching the building blocks of the creative process being put into place.
I'll look for the second book in this series if I can find it because I'd love to get to where he was actually a working writer and read more about that.
Όπως χαρακτηριστικά αναφέρει ο Νταλ στον πρόλογο του βιβλίου (1984), δεν έγραψε μια αυτοβιογραφία, αλλά ένα μυθιστόρημα που αποτελείται από αναμνήσεις, τις οποίες ανέσυρε από το υποσυνείδητό του.
Οι αναμνήσεις αυτές ξεκινούν από την ηλικία των 6 χρόνων και καταλήγουν στη ηλικία των 20 χρόνων, το 1936.
Ο τίτλος του βιβλίου προέρχεται από τον τρόπο με τον οποίο ολοκλήρωνε τα πολυάριθμα γράμματά του προς τη μητέρα του (δεν έγραφε το όνομά του, αλλά τη λέξη 'Boy').
3  stars. I was sad and angry that so much punishment and cruelty was done to boys in the school system.Roald went to a Welsh school for kindergarten. The teacher beat him with a cane. His mother then sent him to different English schools thinking they were the best schools in the world. But sadly, in every school he went to he was beaten with a cane either by teachers, headmasters, or boys with the title Boazer(Prefect). When Roald was a teen he was a star athlete. That usually would have made

But sadly, in every school he went to he was beaten with a cane either by teachers, headmasters, or boys with the title Boazer(Prefect).
But the administrators would not make him a Boazer since they knew he would not use a cane to beat younger boys.
CAUTION - VIOLENT AND GRAPHIC CONTENT IN SPOILER:(view spoiler)[To be caned, the boy had to pull his pants down.
A really lovely, endearing and funny account of a very lovely, endearing and altogether adventurous childhood from a wonderful author. Full review to follow.Blog | Instagram | Twitter | Pinterest | Shop | Etsy
This was one of those eye openers for me as a child; I read Boy countless times (and back home still have the well worn edition from 1986).
Rather, a magical book that opened up another world, glimpsing a life I would never experience.
It's also great to pick out those glimpses of future Dahl stories and characters.
This is a truly great book for kids to read and discover, even more so as we move further away from the era depicted.

Funny and moving account of a 1920s chldhood in Wales, England and Norway, written by a master storyteller.
I was aware that he had published work for adults, too, but hadn’t experienced any of it until I was asked to join a blog tour in advance of Roald Dahl Day (September 13th).
I focused on Innocence: Tales of Youth and Guile, which opens with a reprint of Boy (1984), the closest thing to an autobiography that Dahl wrote.
His first placement was to East Africa for three years; soon afterwards he would become a fighter pilot in the Second World War. In the short years he spent as a London commuter, he realized how easy a 9-to-5 office job is compared to making a living as a writer.
( or you’d rather I put it bluntly , under the rotten educational system in Britain at that time ) Dahl narrated how he was such a poor innocent child .
Like Dahl, I was also a victim of wrong education from teachers who may have been ignorant of child psychology.
If I take him for his words, what he meant to say I believe is like what the famous American writer, William Arthur Ward, said: “The adventure of life is to learn.
Ο Ρόαλντ Νταλ, γνωστός και αγαπημένος σε όλο τον κόσμο χάρη στα πολύ ωραία και ευχάριστα παιδικά βιβλία του, έγραψε και δυο μικρά βιβλία, κάτι σαν αυτοβιογραφίες, με προσωπικές στιγμές από το παρελθόν του, με γεγονότα που τον στιγμάτισαν με τον έναν ή τον άλλο τρόπο.
Πρώτο βιβλίο είναι αυτό που μόλις τελείωσα, στο οποίο αφηγείται γεγονότα από τα παιδικά και εφηβικά του χρόνια.
Βέβαια, τόσα χρόνια που πέρασαν από τότε και τόσα βιβλία που έχω διαβάσει στο μεταξύ, είναι σαν μην το έπιασα ποτέ στα χέρια μου.
Εκτός από τις πάρα πολλές στιγμές που ο Ρόαλντ Νταλ μ'έκανε να χαμογελάσω, κατάφερε να με ταξιδέψει πίσω στον χρόνο, τόσο στα δικά του παιδικά χρόνια, όσο ακόμα και στα δικά μου.
Absolutely charming stories about Dahl's family and his early school days. As he says, it's not actually an autobiography, but its the bits and pieces he remembers. And you can see how those memories informed his books, and how his intelligent, close knit and fantastical family inspired him as well. Complete with illustrations and snippets of his letters home as well.
I don't know if it was the book itself, my affinity towards Roald Dahl, or Dan Stevens' narration, but I absolutely adored this and, like listening to your grandfather's old stories, would most definitely listen to it again.
Dahl, per me, è sopra qualunque giudizio - e non perché abbia preconcetti che mi fanno amare ogni suo libro allo stesso modo indipendentemente dalle sue qualità individuali, ma perché lui, come autore, è invariabilmente, costantemente fantastico.Non c'è niente da fare - lo adoro.Ho qualcosa da criticare però, perchè altrimenti non sarei io.Per quanto la traduttrice abbia reso bene il tono della storia e selezionato il lessico in maniera tale da renderlo accessibile a ragazzi più giovani ma comunque maturo e forse anche un po' nostalgico, per quanto sia rimasta complessivamente fedele alla stesura originale, e per quanto la qualità grammaticale sia notevolmente sopra la media attuale in fatto di traduzioni italiane, ho trovato una manciata di errori che mi hanno infastidita non poco - prevalentemente virgole fuori posto e un paio di congiuntivi cannati.Ma non ho la minima intenzione di valutare la traduzione qui.Soltanto uno dei miei libri preferiti.
I loved how the book is interspersed with his personal photographs taken with his family and in his different schools and well as the letters he writes home to his mother and the witty nicknames he kept for his step sister and brother (ancient half-sister and not so ancient half brother😄).
Through this book he also shares his point of view on some of the not so pleasant punishment practises in public schools in those days like getting thrashed by a cane, fagging, etc.
I'm not usually one for autobiographies, but this one rocked.
Ronald Dahl was a fortunate child.
Fortunate that he wasn't killed many times by events in his life and by the awesome adventures and memories he was privileged to have.I will give you my favorite excerpt from this book."It won't take two seconds, " the doctor said.
He spoke gently, and I was seduced by his voice.
Like an ass, I opened my mouth.The tiny blade flashed in the bright light and disappeared into my mouth.You must read the book to find out what the outcome of that encounter was.

Readers learn of seven-year-old Roald's personal adventures with the candy shoppe down the street, which no doubt inspired Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory, and a woman whom owns the shoppe that shares similarities with characters featured in The Magic Finger, even Matilda.
He attends Llandaff Cathedral School for two years, until his tencious mother, raising him and his siblings alone and determined to follow her late husband's wishes that his children have an English prepatory education ("The very best is the world"), sends Roald Dahl to St. Peter's in Weston-super-Mare, Somerset.
