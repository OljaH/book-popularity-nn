The first story in the collection tells of a group of yellow bird-like creatures called the Sneetches, some of whom have a green star on their bellies.
McBean then tells them about his Star-Off machine, costing ten dollars, and the Sneetches who originally had stars happily pay the money to have them removed in order to remain special.
Ultimately this escalates, with the Sneetches running from one machine to the next….تاریخ نخستین خوانش: روز سی ام ماه آوریل سال 2007 میلادیعنوان: اسنیچ های با ستاره و اسنیچ های بی ستاره و قصه های دیگر؛ نویسنده: زئوس؛ مترجم: رضی هیرمندی؛ تهران، افق، کتابهای فندق؛ 1384؛ در 32 ص؛ شابک: 9643691845؛ موضوع: داستانهای کودکان از نویسندگان امریکایی - سده 20 ماز بهترین کتابهای آموزشی برای کودکان است.

The Plain-Belly Sneetches
It’s not rare that Dr. Seuss came up with this charming tale in 1961, at the beginning of the decade where the civil rights were in a mass turmoil.This story reminded me about the classic TV episode “Let That Be Your Last Battlefield” from Star Trek: The Original Series where the last two individuals from the same planet were still battling against each other, since they consider themselves “different” from the other one, just because their faces have black-white colors in opposite sides (and not surprising that it was aired in 1969, still in this convulsive decade).Here, is the same concept (eight years before) just using stars in the bellies (curiously enough, a couple of decades before, in our messy world, stars were used to make look people as different, just in that time, nobody would want to interchange stars).And in the middle of the ignorance and prejudice, always......ALWAYS......somebody makes profit out of our foolish desires to be “different”, “better”, than others.A sad truth about our species, but we have Dr. Seuss to educate the future generations.

today too, but Anne pretty much wrote the best review ever for that one, so I’m eating a birthday donut in lieu of cake and reviewing my favorite Dr. Seuss book, The Sneetches, instead.
In a world where bullying happens nearly upon birth, this is a story that should be required reading for all.
were kinda a waste of your Christmas money.One day you will see that:“No kind of Sneetch is the best on the beaches.”One day you will forget all about stars.
Because there is still prejudice in the world, that's why.
In his unique way, Theodore Giesel points out the folly of judging anybody by physical characteristics, or any other inaccurate method.Lessons learned from this book:Whether we have stars or not, no matter the color, race, language, gender, religion or orientation, we are all similar, with similar wants and needs.
We will stubbornly stand, unrelenting, while the world passes us by, building roads and highways around us while we stagnate based on principle alone as the Zax characters did.Never name your children all the same name.
The Sneetches and The pale Green pants were favourites of my children and grandson, I have to admit they are favourites of mine too, paticularly the pale green pants, what a message that gets hammered home to children. Absolute classic Seuss!!
So, basically overall “The Sneetches and Other Stories” is a great children’s book to use to discuss racism and prejudice issues for young children and I think the more people read this book, the better they gain an understanding about how ugly racism and prejudice really is.
This is my favorite book to read to my kids.
"Too Many Daves" - Scott and I talked about this one last night and how it is a fun little story, but doesn't have and underlying message.
It's about making all of your kids feel special and letting them be different.
I LOVE reading this to Taz and Ash, because I bring out my inner actress (or story-teller, I guess).
This story is all about not being afraid of people who are different.
I love Dr. Seuss and the fun way that he teaches lessons that we all need to be reminded of.
All four stories in the book have the underlying message of tolerance, acceptance and compromise with those who are different from us or with whom we may not see eye to eye.In The Sneetches, we have the story of how the Star-Belly Sneetches think they are better than the Plain-Belly Sneetches, and as a result, the Plain-Belly Sneetches are excluded from the Star-Belly Sneetches's activities.
I thought this was another great story about the importance of accepting those who are different from ourselves.Overall, The Sneetches and Other Stories was an enjoyable book that managed to address some serious issues in a fun, easy to understand way.
SUMMARYThis collection of short stories touches on themes like the value of diversity, the get-nowhere-fast of stalemates, the value of individuality, and confronting fears.
Humorously, when she calls one, they all come running, and she is left wishing that she'd named them all differently.
This teaches the value in everyone being different.
This teaches children to confront their fears and to not be afraid of someone just because they happen to be different than them.
Its commentary is more subtle than some of the other books, but I think that the message—that diversity is valuable—is such an important one.
I highly recommend to everybody, to once in a while read a Dr. Seuss book (no matter what your age is).
All of these ideas, not only funny but touching important topics masked as a kids book.
This book has stories about prejudices and races, unnecessary stubbornness, and fear from the foreign.
The Sneetches tell us the tale of two different cultures/races.
Those two do not mix together, they keep apart (and the Star-Belly Sneetches have so much fun).
But fear from someone/something you don't really know because you see it from afar.
Cute adventure of meeting empty pants with nobody inside them.5 stars.
Dr. Seuss, you were one crazy man. First, I'm giving this 4 stars, because my youngest son really likes the story about the Sneeches. Second, the story about the empty pair of pants that follows that furry little dude around is just weird.Third, well... I guess there is no third.
.
This book is one of the first books that I understood had a message behind the story. As such it will always hold a special place on my life long bookshelf.
Absolutely amazing 🙌
I remember watching the cartoon version of this story about over a decade ago and I love how simple Dr. Seuss uses his imagination to illustrate an issue that invades all cultures and societies.The Zax: 5 starsI remember watching this short cartoon animation years ago and didn't understand the message until now.
I would rate this 3 stars but since it is such a short story I'll pretend that this story never existed.What was I Scared of?: 5 starsI love this story as I have with the others and how it dealt with how when we are afraid of a person we are frighten because we are confuse and we haven't walked in their shoes to understand how they might feel towards us or our reactions towards them.
The Sneetches is my absolute favourite Seuss story.
The rhythm trumps all other Seuss stories, and when I am reading this out loud to my kids I joyfully shift from Star-belly Sneetch voices to Plain-belly Sneetch voices to Sylvester McMonkey McBean's voice without even a hint of having to think about the shift.
Seuss's rhythm invites that.
Too Many Daves is just plain fun.
Or at least Zanzibar.What Was I Scared Of?
How are the Star-Belly Sneetches supposed to tell who is who?"The Zax" is a meeting of two immovable idiots around whom freeways and roads are built because each refuses to step aside and allow the other to move forward.
The South-going Zax refuses to budge to the east or the west while the North-going Zax never takes a step to the sideThis, of course, explains why our roads are so silly and twisty."Too Many Daves" is a rather stupid story of a mother who birthed 23 babies and named them all Dave.
"The more that you read, the more things you will know. The more that you learn, the more places you'll go!"- Dr.Seussعُدنا للطفولة، و ما أحلاها مِن عودة! إن هذا الكتاب، و رغم قصصه الخيالية البحتة إلا أنه يعكس مجتمعنا و مشاكله بِشكلٍ رائع و مُذهل! أحببتُ الرسومات كذلك، كُنت أتأمل كُل صفحة بتأني، فكتب الصغار دائماً ما تحمل أموراً كبيرة لا نلحظها إلا بعد فوات الأوان!
Dr Seuss is at his best with these four zany stories, 'The Sneetches', 'The Zax', 'Too Many Daves' and 'What was I Scared of?'To begin with the Sneetches came in two varieties, Star-Bellied Sneetches and Plain-Bellied Sneetches.
Every trip through either the Star-On or Star Off machine cost the Sneetches 10 dollars!By the time Mr McBean left as a very rich man the Sneetches had given up worrying who was the better of the species and settled down to live their lives knowing that whatever the variety, 'Sneetches are Sneetches'!There were two Zax, one a North-Going Zax and one a South-Going Zax and when they met head on while walking, neither would give way.
What's interesting is a scoundrel named Sylvester McMonkey McBean rolls into town and offers plain-bellied Sneetches a chance to get stars put on themselves, which of course causes the naturally star-bellied Sneetches to feel that their specialness needs to be preserved and that the have-nots being turned into haves is upsetting to the natural order.
My practical kid brain suggested that the various Daves certainly would have developed nicknames naturally in this situation.
They are standing on their own and that scares the narrator until he realizes the pants are also scared of him.
When people think about children's books they think of happy stories but I'm glad to see authors like Dr Seuss who are creating books about racism and how it is not morally right and giving us ways we could fix it.
Sylvester was my favourite character from this book because if it wasn't for him then the two groups of sneetches (one group with stars on their stomachs and the other group without) didn't matter whether you had stars on your stomachs or not.
Sylvester ended up with a lot of money and the sneetches finally realised that it didn't matter whether you had a star on your stomach or not.
Simply a great piece of children’s fiction with a nice moral at the ending, The Sneetches is about a race of strange looking, yellow coloured creatures, with big fat bellies that live near water, on beaches.
When along comes a character by the name of Sylvester McMonkey McBean, driving up the beach to meet the Sneetches in a car…The entire text of the story is in rhyme, though the rhyming pattern changes and varies throughout.
The accompanying pictures are basic but that is not a bad thing since it is sufficient to illustrate the characters and the story to your children.The ending to the book is beautiful and concludes with a moral lesson making it a fabulous children’s story.
This story is about two groups of people-like beings who live on the beach.
Star-Belly Sneetches think they are the best kind of Sneetch, just because they have stars on their bellies.
The Star-Belly Sneetches looked down upon the Plain-Belly Sneetches, and treated them like second-class citizens.
Then one day, an entrepreneur, Sylvester McMonkey McBean, showed up with a peculiar machine -- one, that could remove the star from a belly (or implant a star upon a belly that was previously plain.) His real purpose was to get money from the Sneetches by changing their appearances.
:)So that I will know for sure later that I read the other stories in this book, I've written a "moral" for each one:The Sneetches: "Just because you have a star on your belly doesn't mean you are better than those who don't." OR "Don't listen to that con-man; he's making money from your insecurities!"The Zax: "Being stubborn can be very inconvenient for you and for those who have to build a road over you."Too Many Daves: "Thinking of strange names for your children after you've already named them 'Dave' doesn't do you any good."What was I scared of: "Don't be afraid of empty pants.
The Plain-Belly Sneetches had none upon thars.” The book “The Sneetches” by Dr. Seuss is about the social dynamics between the two different kinds.
When the Plain-Belly Sneetches became Star-Belly Sneetches and the Star-Belly sneetches became Plain-Belly Sneetches and back and forth, Sylvester McMonkey McBean departs the beach leaving the Sneetches with the thought that they are all equal and are one of a kind.
This reminds me of the racism and discrimination that we face in our own world where although we are all human, we see each other as different because of the color of our skin.
While very short, I really liked The Zax. Do we ever get to set in our ways/ideas/opinions that we refuse to make adjustments?
It seems like this happens in politics a lot...one party takes an absolute stand on an issue, the other party takes the opposite stand...and both refuse to budge or even attempt to make concessions or see eye to eye...thereby hindering progress.
(I do not wish to turn this into a political discussion...and hopefully, you can see that as in The Zax, I think both parties are at fault.).
I wish I could say that we don't do that, but of course, it does happen.
This book has the following short stories for children:The Sneetches 5/5The Zax 5/5Too Many Daves 5/5What Was I Scared Of? 4/5
The Sneetches with stars on their bellies thought they were better than the ones without, but in the end they realized they were all just Sneetches.
Then Sylvester McMonkey McBean came to the beaches where the Sneetches lived.
Mr. McBean offered to take the stars off the original Star-Bellied Sneetches, also for only a small fee.
After going through that experience, all of the Sneetches realized they were equal and it did not matter who had a star belly and who did not.
It was important because this was where Mr. McBean came to add and remove stars from bellies.
The Sneetches- Contrary to popular belief, this is not a story about people who are over obsessed with superficial looks and material possessions to the point that they ostracize people that do not have the same things, but instead a well thought out business plan for future entrepreneurs.
5*The Zax- pretty sure Dr. Seuss was a time traveler and correctly predicted today's political environment.
4*Too Many Daves- I blame Dr. Seuss for teaching children that its okay to name your child something stupid.
Apparently no one back then taught basic color scheming and he decided it was okay to use black text on dark blue backgrounds.
Classic Seuss stories I haven't read since I was a kid. I had forgotten all of them except the title one, though they came back to me as I read. The title story especially is a nice little parable about prejudice and about how those who exploit it can profit from it--a message that remains germane today. The others are rather more slight, though the one about the youngster who makes friends with a talking pair of empty pants scores well on the endearingly weird scale.
