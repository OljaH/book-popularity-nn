I'm so FOND of this series.
This was a thoroughly great reread and perhaps one of the worst tortures the Baudelaire had to go through is Nero's horrific violin playing.
Like seriously my sister was learning violin once and I could've ended her with a spork.
I also love the Quagmires and how they're so NICE and the Baudelaires are always so confused.
😭😭Although lowkey think this is the least effort Olaf put into a scheme.OK onwards with my reread before Season 2 of the Netflix show comes out!
“Friends can make you feel that the world is smaller and less sneaky than it really is, because you know people who have similar experiences.”This was better than The Miserable Mill, mostly because of the Quagmire siblings.This doesn't change the fact that it's one of the most tiring series ever.
It is comical how depressing these books are, but a little change here and there wouldn't hurt.
On one hand I really want to finish this series, on the other I really don't want to read about Olaf tricking everyone and the Baudelaires being unlucky again and again and again.
I loved this book because the kids are taken to a boarding school where they actually make friends! They meet The Quagmire Triplets and they all hit it off so good until Count Olaf messes things up again !!
The formula is applied once more, but with a slight variation in that the Baudelaires find friends of their own age and this alliance faces Count Olaaf with predictably grim consequences.What steps this up from the previous book is a return to the established level of surreal, i.e. marked but not extreme.
The evil mill boss is left unchastened to profit from his slave-labor workforce, and five books in not a single one of Count Olaaf's large and murderous gang has suffered the slightest misfortune...Do children appreciate the honesty - bad people often prosper?
I decided to re-read this before watching the new tv adaptation on Netflix. This was by far my favourite book in the series and so it was beautifully nostalgic to return to it... Lemony Snicket is surely one of the greatest children's writers of our time. What was your favourite book in the 'A Series of Unfortunate Events' library?
AND SO IT BEGINS.Yes, technically this is the fifth book in the series, but to me, it is the very first.This is the book when I really start to love this series, which, in case you are new to my reviews or have been otherwise purposefully ignoring my Snicket-related screeching, is my favorite in the world.This book introduces V.F.D., my favorite combination of three letters in the universe.
Over such fan favorites as "eat" and "bye." This book also introduces the Quagmire triplets, who, in addition to being completely great on their own merit, in turn introduce a complex world of fatal fires and imperiled fortunes.
This is the one where the orphans get thrown into a difficult situation and are overseen by a caretaker who just doesn't care, allowing the evil Count Olaf to get at them...like deja vu all over again.In The Austere Academy the Baudelaire kids end up at a school, which should be good news, because they love the learning, but of course it's not good.
It's never good.I stopped reading the series for a good long while at this point.
The plot structure is cookie cutter and the material not interesting or funny (though I must admit "cake sniffer" as an insult is good stuff) enough to keep my attention.I seem to be losing more and more interest in the series with each book I read.
4.4 The best ASOUE book I've read so far. I love how the story is starting to have a bit of depth in it. For instance, we were introduced to the Quagmire twins (supposed to be triplets) who were also orphans whose parents died in a fire along with their third sibling. Vice Principal Nero was also very despicable, as well as the cheeky Carmelita Spats. Basically, the misfortunes of the Baudelaires are getting worse in every book. The vocabulary was excellent, it has characters that could potenti

I love how the story is starting to have a bit of depth in it.
Basically, the misfortunes of the Baudelaires are getting worse in every book.
The vocabulary was excellent, it has characters that could potentially still be around in future books, and it gives the series new places to go.
A book in the series you should look forward to!
Now I'm off to read the sixth book (and probably the last one I'll read since I just decided to take a break from this series) - "The Ersatz Elevator".
توی جلد پنجم بچهها سرپرست جدیدی ندارن و به یه مدرسهی شبانه روزی فرستاده میشن و اونجا هم ماجراهای خودشونو دارن.این جلد رو نسبت به دو جلد قبل که داستان روتین و قابل پیشبینی شده بود بیشتر دوست داشتم، از دو لحاظ. یکی اینکه بچهها تو مدرسه دوستانی پیدا کردن که جنبهی ارتباطات کتاب رو پررنگتر میکرد و دوم اینکه داستان حالت معماییتری به خودش گرفت و از حالت هر جلد یک داستان مجزا تا حدی خارج شد.----------یادگاری از کتاب:صرف اینکه چیزی مرسوم باشد، نمیتوان گفت که باید انجام شود....دوستان شما میتوانند باعث شون

Where the books become really clever is the additional bits of plot woven into the anecdotes, dedications and acknowledgments, written for the older reader, whether parents reading aloud or older children.
Although the actual definition of the words is sometimes glossed over, I assume the intention is to entertain the older readers and intrigue the younger ones into asking what they mean.Overall Lemony Snicket (real name Daniel Handler) uses the fact that he is writing a book to his advantage more than anyone else I have read.
He plays with the words on the page, often inviting readers to skip chapters, find out more, answer questions or search for hidden meanings.
I feel like I keep repeating myself about the series, so I will keep this very short.
I assume this will be a repeated sequence of events through out the whole series, but there is a change in the plot that will make the series more exciting.
It is nice that the children did find momentary happiness in their depressing lives in this novel, especially since they weren't really happy since book two.
I only hope at the end they find true happiness, and really, like most of you, that is my only motivation to read the series, because the children need a happy ending after all this insanity!
Loved the celery part 😂Best one so far
Quote from Lemony Snicket-"a good night's sleep helps you perform well in school, and so if you are a student you should always get a good night's sleep unless you have come to the good part of your book, and then you should stay up all night and let your work fall to the wayside, and flunk" lmao
In this, you are still following the crazy adventure that the Baudelaire children are on.
Violet, Klaus, and Sunny are now attention a boarding school where they still end up running into Count Olaf in disguise.Now, of course, I complain about the adults in these books but today I'm going to switch it up.
One character, child to be exact, annoyed the crap out of me.
I never want to hear that voice ever again.Sunny is still my favorite out of the children but that's just 'cause she always finds a way to make me laugh.
When season 1 of the Netflix show ended where it did I literally had to reread this because I can't wait much longer for the next season!!Feel like this book's plot is quite simple compared to the others and not a great deal happens, but Count Olaf's wicked plan still hit me hard.
I found myself getting pretty emotional at times because we get to see the Baudelaire's happy with their new found friends and then it just all goes bad again as always!!!Definitely going to have to carry on rereading this series now, it's just so compelling and I need answers!!!
These books are so addictive, I'm totally absorbed in the Baudelaire's world and I'm absolutely loving it!
Despite these books being totally depressing and grim, I just can't get enough of them!
I especially enjoyed this book because it introduces the Quagmires and V.F.D. which adds a whole new aspect to the series.
And I still can't get over how ridiculously blind the adults in this series are, it's quite hilarious actually!
I've said it in a review for one of the previous books in the series but I'll say it again, I'm so thoroughly enjoying my reread of this series.
This is possibly one of my favorite books in the series. It was kind of different. I liked the new setting and the new characters. Also, it was quite mysterious. Can't wait to start the next book!
3 stars!I enjoyed this one more than the previous one. It was better than ‘The Miserable Mill’ and much better than the initial books in the series. Will definitely carry on with the books to see what’ll ultimately happen to Baudelaire children!
3½ stars!I enjoyed this one more than the previous one. It was better than ‘The Miserable Mill’ and much better than the initial books in the series. Will definitely carry on with the books to see what’ll ultimately happen to Baudelaire children!
I’m over these but the kids still like them.
3.75* this was a really fun read! I definitely enjoyed it more than book four, it didn't feel quite so dreary and I loved the fact that the siblings finally have someone on their side! It was nice that the plot wasn't quite so similar as the previous few books and I'm excited to see how it continues on from here, as it feels as though this is the first book in the series so far to have left off on a lightly less conclusive cliff hanger!!
you would think a grown man would get tired of being bested by 3 children.
Para Beatrice: siempre estarás en mi corazón, en mi mente, y en tu sepulcro.What can I say, me encantan estos libros.
3.5 STARS!A little better than The Miserable Mill but it did have some chunky boring bits that really could've been scrapped.
I did like that there was this little mystery thrown in near the end of the book that intrigues the hell out of me and now Count Olaf has kidnapped the Quagmire triplets and will be using them for his insane fuckery filled operations I presume.
Those two things I'm excited to see develop in book 6 which I will be starting soon.
Carmelita Splats thooooooooooooooo!
someone give that little bitch a good kick in the ass please.
3.8/5It's school time for the Baudelaires!But of course this is no normal school for them lolThe thing that I liked the most in this book is that finally these children interact with other kids and have relationships with them.We can see how they approach people of their age and how they interact with them.I liked that the plot for this book is completely connected to the previous one.You know, usually once Count Olaf is discovered the kids get passed to another guardian and we get a completely new story.
This time it's since a while that in the previous book we somehow know that the three children will end up in a school in the sequel, and here we are.I liked how we are introduced to Count Olaf in the "old way".
I think I did like this book more than some of the others in this series...Of course, I was still irritated by some of the same things that happened in previous books...(Just so you know, a lot of these basically have the same plot lol :P, but they are pretty fast reads to me so I figured I might as well finish the series lol) But I'm glad the Baudelaire children at least have some friends in this one that help them with Count Olaf's evil schemes.
I really do love Lemony Snicket. Reading this just brought up so many feelings from childhood. Real review to come eventually.
Probably my favorite of the series so far.
شاید بهترین کتاب مجموعه تا به الان که خوندم. درسته که ایدهی کلیشهای مدرسهی بد و معلمهای حوصله سر بر و همکلاسی یاغی داشت اما واقعا نقشهی کنت الاف رو حتی من هم نتونستم حدس بزنم. شاید برخلاف تصورم هنوز اونقدری بزرگ نشدم و ذهن کودکانهای دارم. و همینطور پایان اسرارآمیزی داشت! برخلاف کتابهای گذشته قتلی داخلش اتفاق نیفتاد و با معمای سر به مهری رو به رو شدیم.
