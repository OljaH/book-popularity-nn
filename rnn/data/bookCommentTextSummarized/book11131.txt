I would use this book for students who may have a sibling on the way. This is a great book yo use to prepare children for the arrival of another baby therefore creating a text to self connection.
I love Keats' illustrations in this one! It's a gentle story about a young boy who is jealous of his baby sister getting all his old baby things, until his old toddler's chair helps him realize an important truth.
With all the events of the last few months, I nearly overlooked the fact that this year is the 100th birthday anniversary of one of America's greatest children's authors: Ezra Jack Keats.
This book is one of the many of his that I read in my early elementary school days.
the story is simple enough but what stands out to me, as always, is the art.
I am not an art expert).Keats spent his whole pre-The Snowy Day career as a illustrator for various things including the background for the golden-age era Fawcett/DC Comics title Captain Marvel.
Here is a reading of this story for anyone interested: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuZhS...
I really enjoyed the book, Peter's Chair" by Ezra Jack Keats.
When his blocks crash down and make a noise, his mother reminds him to play quietly because they have a new baby in the house.
Peter becomes jealous and upset that his new, little sister is receiving his old things and his parents are changing those things to pink.
Eventually he comes to his senses and wants his sister to have his old things.Younger students in kindergarten and first grade will enjoy this book.
I'm sure many young students can relate to Peter's situation with a new baby in the house and all the changes that accompany it.
First class presentation, this is.
His high chair gets painted pink.
Runs away right outside of his house, that is, and is eventually coaxed home and offers to paint his chair.While Peter does have a change of heart, I prefer introducing children to books with good attitudes and character to start with, so when they are in a similar situation, they know how to respond and there's no conflict over mimicry or their emotions.
I also have hundreds of detailed reports that I offer too.
These reports give a complete break-down of everything in the book, so you'll know just how clean it is or isn't.
This story is about a little boy whose family is about to welcome a brand new baby girl; as a result of this, they are painting all of Peter's baby things pink.
Well, naturally, he starts to feel left out, like all his baby things are being taken away from him for the new baby.
So, he decides to go back home, and offers his chair to be painted pink for the new baby.As a parent, I thought this story was great, and emanated a very important message.
I really enjoyed reading this book as it teaches children about different concepts in life such a sharing, changes of getting older and also growing up.
Peter’s parents are about to welcome a new addition to their family a baby girl and start to paint all of Peter’s baby furniture pink.
He starts to get upset because he feels all his baby things are being taken away but doesn’t realise he no longer needs them anymore because he is growing up.
He realises he has grown and grown too big for the chair so he eventually offers his chair to be painted pink for his new baby sister.
Peter’s Chair is an amusing book about young boy that has difficulty coping with the idea of having a new sibling.
However, Peter devises a plan to hide his old toddler chair, which his parents have not yet seen.
Towards the end of the book, Peter realises that he is too big for his things and comes round to the idea of his sister having them.
This is a wonderful book for explaining to young children the concept of growing up and learning to accept new family member’s, it can be used during PSHE lessons when discussing family and in particular sibling relationships.
Like Love You Forever I think this book would be good for learning about growing up and adapting to change. I think this book is very easy to relate to and is very relevant to the lives of many students mainly those who are getting used to having a new sibling. This book would be great for making personal connections and learning to express feelings an appropriate and constructive way.
Peter comes to terms with his baby sister. Even though my son is mostly used to his sister, I still think these sorts of books help him understand that having a sister is something that little boys all over the world have to deal with.
Great book for students with younger siblings. I enjoyed reading this book because it is easy to relate to. It focuses on growing up, getting angry, dealing with frustration and sharing with a baby sister. Cute illustrations also. Great flow of events in the story.
His family has been preparing for the new addition by painting all of Pedro's old things pink.
Pedro gets upset and he does not like what is happening to all of his things, especially his old favorite chair.
It also demonstrates sharing in the way of Pedro's things being given to his new baby sister.
He returns back home and decided that his baby sister can have the chair.I think that this story would be interesting for the children because many do end up being big siblings.
Although it is not all about culture, it does offer this story in Spanish.

Prompt Questions:Why do you think everything is being painted?
It is easy to relate to especially since i have a younger sister and remember seeing my parents reuse my things for her.
Eventually, Peter realizes he is too big for his chair and wants to help paint it for his new sister.I really loved the simplicity of the text and illustrations.
The text simply discussed Peter's story of him dealing with his new sister, and the illustrations focused on what was happening (him playing with his dog or stealing his sister's chair).
The story was very sweet; I loved that Peter realized on his own that his sister should have his old chair.I see a connection between this book and A Chair For My Mother by Vera B.
"They didn't paint that yet!" Peter shouted.

Mentor writing text:Organization- The story has a clear focus and effective use of transitions.

Peter doesn't like what's going on at home. All of his stuff, seemingly, is being commandeered, painted pink, and given to his baby sister. Peter doesn't like it one bit.He absconds with his chair so it cannot be ripped from him. But Peter soon realizes, he's too big for the chair and the other things that have been taken. He then helps paint the chair pink for his sister.It's difficult having someone else in the house who commands attention that used to be provided to you.Read this with my class for #classbookaday.
Peter's baby sister is not happy about how much attention she's getting.
Especially because his dad is painting all of his old furniture pink.
But Peter decides he'll run away and take his little chair with him.
So, he an his dog run away to the front of the house.
he soon decides to come in and mom and dad play hide and seek with him.
in the end he decides that the chair is small for him and asks his dad if he could help paint it pink.
The story had a good message but I thought that it was not as well developed.
I wanted to like this, but the gender color stereotyping ruined it for me. Peter's old baby things were various colors. He had a purple high chair, a blue chair, etc. But because his baby sibling is a girl, apparently every single thing she will ever use has to be painted bright pink. My 3 year old son immediately asked why the baby could only have pink, which was a good teaching moment I suppose.
This book is about a little boy named Peter who has a baby sister and gets jealous because his parents are painting all of his baby stuff pink so he tries to run away with his chair and then realizes he is too big for it.I like this book a lot. This book would be good to read with a student who is having a hard time adjusting to a new baby in their house or just to have in your reading corner. (Traditional Lit)
Good book for a big brother or big sister of a baby (or one on the way).Peter is jealous as he sees all his old stuff (his bed, his high chair) get repurposed for his new little sister. He decides to grab his chair before she can take it and run away. He makes it to the sidewalk outside. He realizes he can no longer sit in his chair because he's too big. He sneaks back in the house, tricks his mother, and suggests prepping his old chair for his sister.

He was playing with his toys and made some noise and his mother called him to stop because the baby still in the house.
And he found out that his crib and high chair were painted in pink because these are going to be his sister's.
He helped his dad to paint the chair to pink for his sister eventually.
The event in the book is plausible which children would believe that could happen.
Peter has a new little sister. His parents use his old crib and other things for his sister, painting them pink. He is worried his little chair will succumb to the same fate, so he takes his chair and he andhis dog Willie run away -- all the way to outside his house. :)His parents are understanding, and then Peter realizes he doesn't even fit into his chair anymore! He has to make a decision.

A boy has a new little sister. His parents have been painting his old baby furniture pink to use with his new sister. Peter's not happy about the baby getting his old furniture, so he takes a chair that is still blue. He runs away with the chair, but ends up changing his mind. A good story for youngsters that will be getting a new little brother or sister.
I like this book because Peter's baby is born and it doesn't show his mommy in the hospital, and everything that he had when he was a baby was painted pink for Suzy, the baby. And his old chair was not pink; he tried to sit in it when he [spoiler alert] ran away, and he was too big and the chair was too small.
