And as a counterpoint, with a sticky note in a different colour:“On Being Asked For A War PoemI think it better that in times like theseA poet’s mouth be silent, for in truthWe have no gift to set a statesman right;He has had enough of meddling who can pleaseA young girl in the indolence of her youth,Or an old man upon a winter’s night.”I remember pondering on the conundrum of accepting these lines as perfect truth while also being grateful that Yeats had not remained silent after all, that he had expressed his thoughts over and over again, in dramatic, long, narrative poems and short, lyrical ones, in stories of common people and kings and queens, in real-life poems and fairy tales.

Not everything in here works for me, but Yeats is never less than a pleasure to read. As others have remarked upon, he's what one might describe as a proper poet: his rhythmic structure and rhymes flow off of the reading tongue—and at his best, he cannot be touched for the ariose beauty of his lyrical genius. Before the World Was MadeIf I make the lashes dark And the eyes more bright And the lips more scarlet, Or ask if all be right From mirror after mirror, No vanity's displayed: I'm looking fo

Just looking at my bookcase and brushing off some old books covered in dust. Man how did I miss Yeats? Literary genius. 👍🐯
Okay.
Cards on the table.I'm not actually that into Yeats.
I mean, he's fine, don't get me wrong.
Kind of an interesting dude with his Cabalism and his Jacob Black-esque mother-to-daughter romantic transference thing.And some of his poetry I can't deny is pretty impressive stuff: the one about wishing for the cloths of the heaven, and the second coming, and the lake isle of innisfree.
All that silver apples of the moon stuff.
Very nice.But, honestly, I used to keep this on my bedside table in order to look sensitive so arty types would sleep with me.
It, uh, did the job.
The mysticism is there, and it's hazy and, er, full of mist and glowing eyes and faery wings and stolen children and dolphins and mechanical birds in Byzantium and Helen of Troy and eternal roses and astrology and gods incarnating in the form of a swans while they fuck humans and darkness and eternity and "the murderous innocence of the sea"...ruins and secret fountains and rolling hills and caves (WBY slept in one for awhile, you country boys know how it gets when the evenings wind on endlessly under a deep summer sky) and witches and little clay-wattle huts, far from the pavement's gray, by a lazy river deep in Innisfree.
The poetry was very good but rather depressing. I believe he could have used some happy pills. I would recommend it to all however.Enjoy and Be Blessed.
I have given hourlong recitations of Yeats's poems, among the easiest to recall in English; for example, his tetrameters in the late "Under Ben Bulben" which contains his epitaph.
I defy you to say this aloud three times without knowing most of it by heart: "Whether man dies in his bed,/ Or the rifle knocks him dead,/ A brief parting from those dear/ Is the worst man has to fear." And his own epitaph is memorable, "Cast a cold eye/ On life, on death/ Horseman, pass by!" It is anti-conventional, since most epitaphs were written by clergy to scare the readers back to church, like this one in Pittsfield, MA: "Corruption, earth and worms/ Shall but refine this flesh..." etc.
My favourite piece of Yeats, which I've known since I was a teenager. I've never really figured out what it means, but I think it's wonderful all the same:Rose of all Roses, Rose of all the World! You, too, have come where the dim tides are hurled Upon the wharves of sorrow, and heard ring The bell that calls us on; the sweet far thing. Beauty grown sad with its eternity Made you of us, and of the dim grey sea. Our long ships loose thought-woven sails and wait, For God has bid them share an equa
You, too, have come where the dim tides are hurled	Upon the wharves of sorrow, and heard ring	The bell that calls us on; the sweet far thing.
Beauty grown sad with its eternity	Made you of us, and of the dim grey sea.
Our long ships loose thought-woven sails and wait,	For God has bid them share an equal fate;	And when at last defeated in His wars,	They have gone down under the same white stars,	We shall no longer hear the little cry	Of our sad hearts, that may not live nor die.
I chose Yeats because the Clancy Brothers occasionally included readings of poems by Yeats on their records and in their concerts.
Given that the Clancy Brothers were very close Bob Dylan they constituted for me an important authority.Looking back I realized now what an anomaly Yeats was.
He was a master of cadence, sound and rhyme skills that are no longer valued by English poets.
At a minimum Dylan would have known the Host of the Air and the other Yeats poems in the repertory of the Clancy Brothers.To hear a masterful version of Yeats Host of the air, go to: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyPc6...
The woods of Arcady are dead,And over is their antique joy;Of old the world on dreaming fed;Grey Truth is now her painted toy;Yet still she turns her restless head:Everything he writes is beauty personified, from his love poems to his Irish mythology. We sat grown quiet at the name of love; We saw the last embers of daylight die, And in the trembling blue-green of the sky A moon, worn as if it had been a shell Washed by time’s waters as they rose and fell About the stars and broke in days and years.
I travelled from the other side of the world to visit your grave and leave you flowers as thanks.
It is very hard to pick a favourite poem but if pressed on the subject I guess it would be:He Wishes for the Cloths of HeavenHad I the heavens' embroidered cloths, Enwrought with the golden and silver light, The blue and the dim and the dark cloths Of night and light and half-light, I would spread the cloths under your feet But I, being poor, have only my dreams; I have spread my dreams beneath your feet; Tread softly because you tread on my dreams...
W.B. Yeats bought a signed 1st edition of Ulysses!  Yeat's poetry is deeply philosophical and moving. A Dialogue of Self and Soul is still a top favorite poem of all time for me.Reference for 1st edition info:https://www.baumanrarebooks.com/blog/...
چه سخت است که کلمات به کاغذ در می آیندزمانی که تصویری پهناور از روح استچشمانم را تاریک می کند؛ جائی میان شن زارجسمی با بدن یک شیر و سر آدمینگاهی خالی و بی هیچ دلسوزی شبیه خورشیدران های سست اش را به حرکت وا می دارد چرخش سایه وار پرندگان صحرایی.تاریکی قطره قطره می چکداما حالا می دانم که خواب سنگی قرن بیستمو گهواره ای که تکانش می داد کابوسی آزار دهنده بودوچه جانور خشنی ست؛ ساعتش رسیده و می لمد به سمت بیت الحم که زائیده شود؟جواني و عمركه چه بسيار در جواني خشم گرفتم پريشان و ستم ديده از دنياكه حالا با زباني متملق و غلط اندازبه خداحافظيِ مهماني كه تركش مي گويد سرعت مي بخشد.
If not for The Wanderings of Oisin, this was a 2.5/5. I think half of Yeats's poems include the word "dew." It's used so many times it actually increasingly pissed me off with each successive occurrence and almost culminated in my throwing the book across the room.Joyce was entirely right in his criticism of Yeats.Save for a few good poems, the rest are entirely forgettable.

Mostly because he likes Irish mythology and writes lots of poems about it - a basic knowledge of Irish myths is helpful, but not totally necessary.One of my favorites, for sheer Icky But Awesome Factor, is Leda and the Swan.
My class spent nearly an hour discussing it and I almost understand it.
Frequently did not know what was going on, but enjoyed many wonderful phrases and images. An endless wood, full of Celtic twilight.
Beautiful. I regularly return to this collection and reread them at random, out loud, to savor the language - a sign of poetry done right.
When You are OldWhen you are old and grey and full of sleep,And nodding by the fire, take down this 
When you hear a slouchIn your neighborhoodWhat troubles your sight?SPIRITUS MUNDI!(I ain't afraid of no rough beasts!)
The book contains Yeats’ complete and unabridged verse, exclusive of his plays.
Yeats employs a variety of rhyme schemes, when he uses rhyme at all, and careful reading of the poems often rewards the reader with approximate rhymes that might easily be missed.
Published the Collector’s Library, this 4” by 6” book fits easily into a pocket, facilitating its availability for brief readings at any opportunity.
And I always appreciate an attached ribbon for marking pages.
What a delight to read and treasure this small but complete work.
The Collected Poems of W.B. Yeats by William Butler Yeats has a gift for language even when the subject of his poetry devolves into repetition of Irish myths.
His way with words is admirable, and even though I am not very religious, his poems about God and angles really got to me.
There is no doubt that he is a Shakespeare with his words, but he is still rather good and very enjoyable on rainy days.
My favourite poem also happens to be written by Yeats and it goes like this: A mermaid found a swimming lad, picked him for her own, pressed her body to his body, laughed; and plunging down, forgot in cruel happiness that even lovers drown.
He's conceited. He's an elitist. He's sexist. He's more than a little crazy. But he's also a genius so we'll forgive him all that. That's what my Yeats teacher told me anyways!
"Words alone are certain good."
“The Wild Swans at Coole” celebrate the fashinating emotivity of a place, not only expressed in its geographical essence but more lived on the interior side, that Yeats’ verses trace in a pure state of grace.For many years in poet’s life, Coole represented the ideal shelter to rest from the efforts and pains.
Lady Gregory, the Irish Rock, who introduced Yeats to the beauty of Coole, was the most important friend, host and advisor of him.“The Swans” are a sort of gallery open to the seasons of life, where the friends gone receive their tribute and take a definitive leave, but with a melanchonic brimming intonation, in the special strenght gave by memory.This burial hymn to a black and white faced Demeter catches the poet weighing up a collar-bone of a hare.
I have enjoyed the poetry of William Butler Yeats for many years as evidenced by my well-worn copy of his Complete Poems.
But there is more to enjoy when considering this protean author for throughout his long life, William Butler Yeats produced important works in every literary genre, works of astonishing range, energy, erudition, beauty, and skill.
His poems and plays of middle age address the human condition with language that has entered our vocabulary for cataclysmic personal and world events.

What can one say about William Butler Yeats accept that he was an amazing poet!
He is a true inspiration to anyone who longs to write from their heart, mind, and soul.
The young In one another's arms, birds in the trees Those dying generations - at their song, The salmon-falls, the mackerel-crowded seas, Fish, flesh, or fowl, commend all summer long Whatever is begotten, born, and dies.
Read more and be absorbed!I took my time throughout the year to slip between the pages of this volume and travel where Yeats dared to take me.
I discovered Years last year during a university English unit. I am not a big fan of poetry but something about Yeats really resonated with me.
