I'm saying this not just because I'm in love with the cover. *stares at cover and sighs dreamily*And it's not just because the hero has a killer body and his stare could melt an iceberg. *dreamily thinks about the hero's hot body*No. This book is for educational purposes only. *thin

And yes, I skipped the first book and went straight for second.

*stares at cover and sighs dreamily*And it's not just because the hero has a killer body and his stare could melt an iceberg.
*dreamily thinks about the hero's hot body*No. This book is for educational purposes only.
*thinks Lucien is really hot*Trust me when I say you'll like the characters.
She is self-sufficient and intelligent, which is tragically rare in romance novels.
The hero is physically imperfect, another rare occurrence in romance novels.
Mostly, I think it is just a result of reading some phenomenal books recently, which has kind of raised the bar.
Any other week, it probably would've been a 4-star read.That being said, I found myself losing interest in this book.
Again, this was probably more of a reflection on how absorbed I was in another story that I was reading.
I just couldn't stay focused.Then, just as I thought the story was moving along, it changes focus.
I probably would have enjoyed this one much more if I hadn't been completely blown away by some really spectacular books recently.
He was known as The Dark One. Malach ha-Maet. Yama. Azreal. Shadow Walker. Mairya. King of the Dead. He was all of those things and more, for he was a Lord of the Underworld.

This one was sooo much better than the first, with two awesome main characters and a great story :)I really loved it :)Lucien, the Lord who carries the demon of Death, gets an order from Cronus, the King of the Titans, to kill someone.That someone is Anya, the goddess of anarchy, who has been following him for months.Anya is pretty much obsessed with Lucien and she wants him badly, even though she knows she can't have him, but that doesn't stop her from flirting with him :DAnd so the question is, will Lucien be able to say no to the gods and save Anya's life, before she kills him herself, or kill her and save his friends from suffering.Anya.
So, I have to say that Anya turned out to be a favorite for me in this series (after reading the first three books).
Although I was glad that Anya didn't take advantage of it.The Darkest Night was a little bit flawed as a start to the series, (definitely not as strong as this book), so I was very pleasantly surprised (although I think Gena Showalter is a very good author) how much I enjoyed this book.
I can see myself rereading this book sooner rather than later, because I really loved Lucien and Anya as a couple.
However he managed to draw Anya’s attention and she's following him for months.Anya is the goddess of Anarchy and definitely bad news for Lucien .She is courageous, fearless, dynamic and way different than him .She doesn’t know why she is attracted to this Lord but she has to be with him.In this book the fantasy plot is very rich.
Obviously Anya is a little spoiled goddess who loves taking what she wants.Due to her curse she has to be careful with men but Lucien is a safe deal and she is going to risk everything and be with him.***William***
This was Lucien and Anya's story.
Lucien was in love once and when the love of his life became sick and he had to escort her soul to Heaven he decided to take matters in his own hands so that no woman will ever want him again.
That is until the beautiful Goddess Anya starts coming around.
On top of Anya and Lucien's story we also get a chapter here and there on a few of the others.
I'm also sad that I have to wait until book 9 to get to Paris's story!
Μέχρι στιγμής αγαπώ δύο ηρωίδες: Την Ρόουζ Χαθαγουεϊ και την Ανια!!! 💖💖💖Επισης ο Λούσιεν είναι ο καλύτερος αλλά έχω μια μικρή αδυναμία στον Παρη!!!Πάμε για κυνήγι θησαυρού!! 💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖

Lucien: Demon of DeathButterfly: upper left shoulder and front of chestHis curse: He is the Lord of the Underword’s version of Grim Reaper.
Anya will be attracted to Lucien.
And Lucien cannot believe it, because Anya is pretty, funny, wicked, sparkly.
What does she want from him?But Anya is also untouched, cursed and she does not lie.
Unfortunately the gods will order (blackmail basically) Lucien to take Anya’s soul.
Lucien keeps rejecting her and avoiding her in order not to take her soul.
Anya is super funny.
“You stabbed me,” he said, incredulous. Grimacing, he jerked out the now-bloody dagger and rubbed a hand over the wound, then looked down at his drenched, crimson-stained fingers. Anger overrode the incredulity.“Feel free to keep the dagger as a souvenir.”    July 22, 2013 The Darkest Kiss is the second book of the Lords of the Underworld series, the story of Lucien, Keeper of Death, and Anya, goddess of Anarchy.

The Darkest Kiss is the second book of the Lords of the Underworld series, the story of Lucien, Keeper of Death, and Anya, goddess of Anarchy.
Though there is instant lust between Lucien and Anya, love slowly comes too.
I loved that Lucien learns to read Anya so well: he is perceptive to her behavior and mood swings.
He is unsure about her at the beginning, with all his insecurities, but once he believes her, he doesn’t let himself be deluded any more.Anya is not that sweet, innocent heroine who needs to be protected with unsheathed sword all the time.
At first she can’t believe Lucien’s insecurities, but realizes soon that she needs to reinforce him in his own attractiveness.

- 4 stars★Review★I read book 1 in the series a cpl years back, really enjoyed it, but for some reason, did not carry on with the series.I loved Lucien and Anya and the tension between them.
I was just waiting and waiting for Lucien to finally break!It is a great addition to the series.
(while at the same time feeling like the previous couple were barely mentioned or used as anything more than background props, as possibly their story had been told, so we can forget about them?)However, I did enjoy them, and will certainly carry on with the series and not leave it so long next time.["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>
This is now my favourite in the series, I doubt any of the books will live up to this The main reason why this is now my favourite is ANYA, the female protagonist.  You can go with me,” Lucien snapped.Ah, such enthusiasm. Irritated, she ran her tongue over her teeth. Still, his demands and growls were better than all those weeks of implacable composure. Huh. Maybe she should push him a little more. “Sorry. What’d you say?” She cupped a hand over her ear. “I couldn’t hear you.”“You can go with me
Anya is everything I love in female character, she exudes confidence, she is badass, knows what she wants and goes for it, she is not afraid to say what she wants, fashionable and is also a goddess, like seriously what more can we ask for.
Some of the other guys still have POV, this book is wholly written in third person multiple POV, I love the way Lucien’s POV is archaic cause he is not as modern as Paris and Sabin’s warriors.
I did not like that he was weak or losing for most of the book.
I think I missed that from the first book.
It seemed like all the main warriors in this book were left hanging or forgotten.
Something I forgot to mention in my review of the first book was the butterfly tattoo.
When I was reading the book and they first described the butterfly tattoo, I admit that my mental picture was awful.
Lastly, your cover lies because the guy on the cover looks NOTHING like Lucien was described in the book.
Αμυδρώς καλύτερο από το προηγούμενο, κυρίως εξαιτίας των πρωταγωνιστών που μου ήταν πιο συμπαθείς από αυτούς του πρώτου. Κατα τα άλλα μια από τα ίδια. Το background της θέλει πολύ δουλειά για μένα, κουραστική φλυαρία, εύκολες λύσεις και το τέλος δεν με έπεισε.Και ναι, κάπου εδώ παίρνω την απόφαση ότι αυτή η σειρά δεν είναι για μένα!
Ο Lucien οδηγεί την δικιά του παράταξη με τους Άρχοντες από την Βουδαπέστη στην Αθήνα έτοιμοι να αντιμετωπίσουν κάθε εμπόδιο που θα μπει μπροστά στο δρόμο τους.
Τότε είναι που πρώτο αντικρίζει και τον Lucien και αρχίζει να τον ακολουθάει όλοι μέρα μέσα από την καθημερινότητα του.
Και τα πράγματα θα γίνουν ακόμα πιο περίπλοκα όταν ο Κρόνος θα ζητήσει από τον Lucien να φέρει το νεκρό σώμα της Anya αλλιώς θα βασανίσει έναν έναν κάθε φίλο του Πολεμιστή.
Πάντα είναι ευχάριστες οι ιστορίες όπου τα ετερώνυμα έλκονται ενώ ο Lucien φαινόταν τόσο βαθύ χαρακτήρας είδη από το πρώτο βιβλίο αλλά δεν περίμενα να τους λατρέψω τόσο πολύ.
★★★★ 4.5 STARS!The Darkest Kiss is one of my most fave read in LOTU series.
He's the only person who have Teleportation to places also the boss in this group.Pros:+ As the (minor) Goddess of Anarchy, Anya is the most bad-ass heroine I've ever met.
Even Anya seems only want to play him, but Lucien slowly fallen for her.
I liked when he became possessive.
Anya is the star in this story.
Lol) and I liked her!
Lucien really fight for her and didn't give up.
Oh man, this series is getting so much better!
2.5 StarsI really thought I was going to love this but it didn't work for me. I enjoyed the beginning--so hot!--but for some reason, I just lost interest in the end. I probably wouldn't even have finished if I didn't skim through the last several chapters. But judging by the high ratings from my Goodreads friends, perhaps it was a case of it's not you, it's me.
The myth aspect of the story is very well done so if you know a bit about Greek myth it's a nice bonus but the main characters just kill the rest of the story.Lucien talks in such a formal manner nearly all the time that it’s hard to see him as sexy or to warm up to him.
Why?????” I was more interested in what was going on with the other characters that appeared in book 1 than in Anya and Lucien.So it’s safe to say that I didn’t like this story but I liked the background.
4 Sexy and Fun-Filled Stars - Paranormal Romance
Ölüm, ölüm dediğin nedir ki Lucien ben senin için yaşamayı göze almışım♡♡Bakın bu seri uyuşturucu gibi bişey.
Helal sana Gena!!Ölüm iblisi ile lanetlenen savaşçımız Lucien yüzyıllar önce aşık olduğu kadını kaybettikten sonra (ki çok üzücü bi durum lan gerçekten😔😔) bi daha kimseyi kendine yaklaştırmamak için yüzünü yara bere içinde bırakmış (bak bak ölüm dediğin böyle romantik olmamalı😍😍) Sonra işte anarşik tanrıçamız Anya aşüftesi bu ponçiğe kancayı takar ve Lucien'in kalbine giden yollar açılır.
Neyse efendim sülük gibi yapışan Anya ile Lucy bebeğim arasındaki yüksek dozda cinsel gerilim sizi inim inim inletse de 'sevişin de kurtulun' taktiğinin işe yaramayacağını biliyoruz.
Çünkü Anya'nın...
Sana bakmak nihayet cennetin kapılarına girmek gibi.
Λες και δεν θα γράψει άλλα βιβλία (16 αν δεν κάνω λάθος είναι αυτή η σειρά) και πρέπει να αναφέρει κάποιους έτσι για το μαμώτο...Θα επανέλθω στο τέλος για τους ήρωες σφήνες στην ιστορία του Θανάτου με την Αναρχία...
Δλδ συγνώμη στο 5ο ή ακόμα και στο τελευταίο βιβλίο της σειράς οι μισές σελίδες θα είναι για να μας πει το τι έχει γίνει????
(Whaaaaat???)Για τους άλλους άρχοντες μας πάει ένα τσικ να δούμε την κάνει ο Μάντοξ και η Ασλίν, ο Ρέγιες, ο Έρον, και οι υπόλοιποι ομάδα (είναι πολλοί δεν μπορώ να τους πω έναν έναν) Και για το τέλος το μόνο που κρατώ είναι....
Kocaman bir SONUNDA ve hızla sayfaları çevirmeye devam.Üçüncüsü- ki bence epey mühim bir mesele- Bu kitapta öyle bir gerilim,öyle bir elektrik vardı ki bir sonraki sayfada ne olacak, ne okuyacağım diye kafayı yemeden bitirmeyi başardım.
Elimde devamı olmadığı için -HENÜZ- kafayı sıyırmakla neden daha önce devam etmeye karar vermedim arasındayım bittiğinden beri.
Yalan yok son kısımlarda biraz yıkıldım.Çünkü biraz hızlandırılmış gibi geldi bana ve bu beni epey üzdü çünkü Lucien ve Anya'ya henüz doyamamıştım.
Bir kez daha belirtmek isterim ki EN AZ!Paris'i daha ikinci kitapta süründürmesi de beni epey üzdü.
Delicious, scarred and irresistible Lucien ❤️
Well I certainly enjoyed this book much better than the first in the series, and think that I will now continue on with the series so I am glad I decided to give it another chance.
I think I just enjoyed Lucian and Anya's characters much more than Maddox and Ashlyn.
Thus it was a lot of setup - like it was a first book in a series - but the heat between Lucian and Anya made up for that lack!
Although with all the damn Lord's who knows when your favorite character will get a book.
THE BACK STORY Long ago twelve immortals warriors made by Zeus, became jealous of Pandora she was chosen to guard a box. Inside that box housed some of the most dangerous demons ever known. The Immortals made a horrible mistake of killing Pandora and opening the box. As punishment for the evil they have unleashed each warrior was sentenced to carry one of those demons for all eternity. They are - Violence, Pain, Death, Disease, Disaster, Misery, Doubt, Promiscuity, Defeat, Lies, Secrets, and W
Time is now running out with the Titans have taken the throne, the Hunters are growing and one by one the Lords are learning to trust others besides themselves to help win the war.
Anya has had a thing for Lucien ever since she saw him while helping Maddox and Ashlyn.
We have all the main players mentioned in this one… Maddox – Violence,Lucien – Death, Reyes – PainAeron – Wrath,  Torin – Disease, Paris - Promiscuity,  Sabin - Doubt,  Gideon  - Lies,  Amun  - Secrets,  Strider  - Defeat,  Kane - Disaster, and  Cameo  (The only girl Lord)- Misery.
Opening Line: " Anya, Goddess of Anarchy, daughter of Lawlessness, and dealer of disorder, stood on the edge of a crowded dance floor."THE DARKEST KISS is book 2 in the exciting and original Lords Of The Underworld series and it's absolutely fantastic.
There are also several other immortals stories taking place at the same time which instead of distracting from only added to the tension in a very JR Ward kind of way.
This book starts out with a bang as Lucian meets the Goddess of Anarchy in a nightclub.
Anya doesn't mince words or actions in the fact that she wants Lucian and no other will do.
I was losing interest in this book through the story, but toward the end the story picked up a little and it was semi-enjoyable, I guess.
I didn't hate this book, but I didn't love it either.
There was one thing I really hated in this book.
H recalled his dead ex-lover everytime he did something with h as in: Mariah(ex) was my first and only true love.
I suffered and burnt like that time I grieved for Mariah.
I haven't been aroused like this since Mariah.
I haven't been with anybody since Mariah.
For a character that's been dead for more than a thousand years she had too much screen time.

Τι να φτουρήσει ο Κρόνος μπροστά στο Λούσιεν;;!!Και τι να φτουρήσουν τα 5 αστεράκια για να βαθμολογήσω ΑΥΤΟ το βιβλίο!!; Όλα τα είχε - ρομάντζο, έρωτα, χιούμορ, δράση, ποικιλία(λες και θα βαριόμουν ας πούμε αν διάβαζα μόνο για το Λούσιεν,το Λούσιεν και το Λούσιεν..Α ναι,και την Άνια του.Οι οποίοι έγιναν πλέον ένα από τα αγαπημένα μου ζευγάρια ever!)Ο ξενιστής του Θανάτου είναι σημαδεμένος,είναι γεμάτος ουλές,είναι μελαχρινός,έχει μάτια διαφορετικού χρώματος,και είναι ποινικά κολάσιμος..Όταν δε συνοδεύει ψυχές στον Παράδεισο και την Κόλαση κολάζει όσες τον διαβάζουμε με την περπατησιά του,το ανάστημά του,τη δύναμή του...Εντάξει νομίζω καταλάβατε πως ερωτεύτηκα!Αν ο Μάντοξ του πρώτου βιβλίου ήταν λουκουμάκι,ετούτος εδώ είναι όλη η λουκουμιέρα!!
Rating; 3.5/5Yazara Paris ile beni seriye kancalama hamlesiyle gıcık olmuş bulunmaktayım.
Onun kitabına daha yedi kitap var olduğunu görmedim sanma yazar!
Düşmeyeceğim şu anlık o tuzağına.
Kahretsin ki merakım dürtüldü bir kere.
Neyse geçer bunlarda yavrucuğum, unutursun diyerek yeni kitabıma yelken açıyorum.
Ayrıca o kısacık sahnede, bütün kitapta çiftimize hissettiğimden daha çok heyecan hissettim püüüüüü sana Lucien.
Resmen top gibi sektirdiniz aranızda.
Ayrıca bu elemanların tanrılar tarafından parmak ucunda oynatılmasına feci gıcık kaptım.
Antipatik bir durum benim gözümde.
Yazar bu kadar köle gibi yapmayabilirdi.
Dağ gibi adamları deviriyor namussuzlar ya.
Seriye şu anlık devam etmek yok.
