I Sing the Body Electric, a collection of short stories by Ray Bradbury gets less ink than the more popular collections The Illustrated Man and The Martian Chronicles but perhaps better demonstrates his great range of literary ability and imagination.
Focusing on a central Bradbury theme of nostalgia, while straying from the science fiction and fantasy genre, I Sing the Body Electric is best illustrated by the title story, which is by far the best and is on a short list of the best of Ray’s stories.
Dawwww!Other stories that made an impression on me (i.e. are sort of imprinted on my aging crack-addled brain):The funny one about the Irish Revolutionary dudes and saving some paintings.The sad/sweet one about a guy who impersonated Charles Dickens.The interesting one about the triangle baby and the human parents.The weird one about a descendant of John Wilkes Booth shooting a robot Abe Lincoln.The touching story about giving Ernest Hemingway a more fitting death.The strange one about the old dude on Mars who punks himself over and over again.Caveat emptor: There’s a poem at the end of the book that I sort of read in an I’m-almost-done-with-this-book-so-I’m-going-to-sort-of-speed-read-it-and-just-pretend-I-read-it way.Miller Analogy Bonus public service content for you potential grad-schoolers:Poetry : Jeff :: Kryptonite : SupermanThe relationship is thus: Prolonged exposure to Kryptonite will kill Superman and prolonged (hell even brief) exposure to poetry will eventually kill me.Good luck in grad school, kids!
Look at this glorious cover. My friend Kate/Monty brought this to my attention.
Imagine a summer that would never end.Imagine a boy who would never grow up.Imagine a dog that would live forever.Imagine a small town, the kind that isn't lived in any more.Ready?
I was finally prompted to take it down after reading Neil Gaiman's short story The Man Who Forgot Ray Bradbury.Yet another instance of one book leading to another in a never-ending chain of wonderments.Quite honestly, I've read better, more imaginative stories than the tales featured between the pages of this book.
ANYONE looking to learn the craft of writing, and wanting to discover how to create consistently fine, well written fiction, need look no further than Mr. Bradbury's work.I ran.
Dog ran.
Normally I find Bradbury a quaint and light read - something I can easily fly through and admire his imagination.
It seems he's always yearning for his past, and his future always seems to be some sort of recreation of the small mid-West town ideology that he remembers from his childhood.And while he is conscious of the nuclear standoffs of his Cold War era, he seems deaf to other contemporary social elements.
In another you had a guy rambling about a holocaust with imagery of burning in ovens - yet he wasn't talking about the Jewish Holocaust of WWII.It's just a curious, out-of-touch-with-modern-society feeling that I've noticed with him over and over again and the more I read by him, the stronger that feeling grows.
These stories explore what it is to be human, lonely, afraid, excited, and hopeful.
In their shared solitude and existential wonderment, these protagonists are all alike.Bradbury casts his characters in adverse and bleak environments, but avoids depressing narrative, instead endowing them with curiosity and excitability.
Bradbury illuminates longing, love, and loneliness with sprightly and hopeful prose.
This lightheartedness can make the book droll from time to time, as most of the stories have similar characters who react in similar ways to problems."I Sing The Body Electric" is an enjoyable, sometimes miry collection by a monster author who has a gift for evocative and driving prose.
I loved this book; I was drawn to it because I was so entranced by The Twilight Zone's adaptation of "I Sing The Body Electric" - this book really brings the wonderfully vibrant story and many others like it to life, and Ray Bradbury presents scenarios where the only limit to imagination is your mind and what you interpret from these fun little stories.
I SING THE BODY ELECTRIC.
Ray Bradbury.
***1/2.This was a collection of short stories, previously published in a variety of magazines by Bradbury.
They very cleverly reveal the author’s skill in his approach to the genre.
His themes run the gamut from fantasy to everyday reality.
One of my favorites was, “The Man in the Rorschach Shirt,” likely because I recently finished reading a biography of Rorschach and an analysis of his methods.
There are some real classics in this collection, and the reader is urged to read as many as possible to get a good idea of Bradbury’s talents.
I read this as a teen.
And now that I've re-read, I'm thinking about the things I missed when I was young, the nuance and the subtext...must reread everything!
Anyway, this is probably his most literary collection of stores.
It was published in 1969 but some of the stories are older than that, but this is really a timeless set of fictional parables, poems and ruminations.
I would still tell any teenager to read it and fall into its worlds.I was lucky enough to see Ray Bradbury and Ray Harryhausen on stage a few years ago at the LA Times Festival of Books.
Even if you're not a Bradbury fan, you should still read it."The Kilimanjaro Device" ***"The Terrible Conflagration Up at the Place" ***"Tomorrow's Child" ***"The Women" ****"The Inspired Chicken Motel" **"Downwind from Gettysburg" *** 1/2"Yes, We'll Gather at the River" ** 1/2"The Cold Wind and the Warm" ***"Night Call, Collect" ****"The Haunting of the New" *****"I Sing the Body Electric!" ***"The Tombling Day" **"Any Friend of Nicholas Nickleby's Is a Friend of Mine" ***"Heavy Set" ** 1/2"The Man in the Rorschach Shirt" ***"Henry the Ninth" ***"The Lost City of Mars" *** 1/2"The Blue Bottle" **"One Timeless Spring" ***"The Parrot Who Met Papa" ***"The Burning Man" **"A Piece of Wood" *** 1/2"The Messiah" **"G.B.S. Mark V" *** 1/2"The Utterly Perfect Murder" ** 1/2"Punishment Without Crime" **"Getting Through Sunday Somehow" ***"Drink Entire: Against the Madness of the Crowd" ***"Christus Apollo" *****
Not every story hits, but those that do are true classics of dark, fantastical, and general literature, especially "Tomorrow's Child," "Night Call, Collect," "The Lost City of Mars," "The Burning Man," "The Blue Bottle," "The Parrot Who Met Papa," "A Piece of Wood," "Drink Entire: Against the Madness of Crowds," "Punishment Without Crime," and especially "Heavy-Set," which is one of my favorite short stories in all of written history.Few writers in the English language are more talented, imaginative, influential, and important than Ray Bradbury.
If you enjoy Ray Bradbury's inimical style of writing, you'll enjoy this collection of stories.
It was a pleasure to revisit them, to enjoy Bradbury's prose.These are the stories in my version:"The Kilimanjaro Device""The Terrible Conflagration Up at the Place""Tomorrow's Child""The Women""The Inspired Chicken Motel""Downwind from Gettysburg""Yes, We'll Gather at the River""The Cold Wind and the Warm""Night Call, Collect""The Haunting of the New""I Sing the Body Electric!""The Tombling Day""Any Friend of Nicholas Nickleby's Is a Friend of Mine""Heavy-Set""The Man in the Rorschach Shirt""Henry the Ninth""The Lost City of Mars""The Blue Bottle""One Timeless Spring""The Parrot Who Met Papa""The Burning Man""A Piece of Wood""The Messiah""G.B.S.-Mark V""The Utterly Perfect Murder""Punishment Without Crime""Getting Through Sunday Somehow""Drink Entire: Against the Madness of Crowds""Christus Apollo"
Bradbury at his best combines nostalgia and creepiness in a tone reminiscent of the old Twilight Zone TV series.
The only positive female character in the collection is the Grandmother in the title story, and she is a female robot who has to care for the most angry and bitter little girl in fiction.While Bradbury uses the Walt Whitman quote "I sing the body electric!" just as a way of referring to a robot, he actually tries to use Whitman's literary cataloging technique in a few of his stories and the results are tough.
If you like Ray Bradbury in general, this is an awesome collection of weird little short stories.
If you don't know him, this is an excellent book to use to get acquainted with him.The stories in I Sing the Body Electric were so varied.
They range from fantastic (The Lost City of Mars) to scary (Night Call, Collect) to just plain weird (Tomorrow's Child).
It is in description that Bradbury really excels, but in my humble opinion, every other aspect of his craft is quite impressive as well.
I underlined so many tasty phrases in this book.
All that gorgeous language disguises some serious flaws. Namely: 1. Narrator, men, boys, and robots all have that same flights of fancy speech style, while women and girls are too weak and/or wily, 2. characters are indistinguishable from one another, only known by their roles, 3. Science & numbers are ridiculous, and 4. ideas, when stripped of language and summed, are simple. A two-star book, really... but oh that language.
I thought I would love this book but, as it's often the case with short story collections, it's pretty irregular. Tomorrow's Child, Heavy-Set, The Lost City of Mars and the title story are above average while stories such as The Inspired Chicken Motel and Henry the Ninth are not that successful. Still an interesting example of fiction that reaches beyond the sci-fi genre.
A really good collection of short stories. I think my favorite is Tomorrow's Child for all its quirkiness.
There are 18 stories by Ray Bradbury in this book and there were a few I loved, several I liked, some I didn't care for, and a handful that didn't really make much of an impression.Overall, this group of short stories seemed to have less of the sci-fi and fantasy elements than most Bradbury I've read.
Quite a few of the stories had literally no fantasy elements - "Yes, We'll Gather at the River," "Heavy-Set," "The Man in the Rorschach Shirt," "Any Friend of Nicholas Nickleby's," and "The Terrible Conflagration up at the Place." And in another few it was just barely hinted at.
I loved this collection of Short stories by Ray Bradbury but I will never understand how and why some stories were collected with each other. This collection really lacked a theme tying all of the stories together and in fact four of the stories could have been included in The Martian Chronicles but weren't. Though one story, "The Messiah," was included in The Martian Chronicles Mini Series starring Rock Hudson.Anyway it was still a good read and well worth the amount of time that it takes to read.
The stories in this collection are hit and miss, more misses for me than hits... Bradbury was always a weird writer for me. Here, I either understood everything he said in a story, or was so baffled that I had to skip a story because I just couldn't put the words together to a narrative I can actually grasp. I did love couple of the stories, like "The Terrible Conflagration Up at the Place", "Night Call, Collect" and "Punishment Without Crime". The title story is also quite decent.
This collection of short stories runs quite the gamut. Some stories are worthy of five stars and some only two. So I averaged them all together and give an overall rating of three and a half stars. Am I going to tell you which stories were my favorite? Nope. You're just going to have to read and judge for yourself. Enjoy!
The darkest story was “Drink Entire: Against the Madness of Crowds” which could have comfortably fit on the same block as “Something Wicked” and The October Country.
“The Cold Wind and the Warm” is a delightful carpe diem tale that may or may not involve the brief return of the fae to Ireland.
The extra layers of time continuing to pass and the resistance to and acceptance of change and growth.Probably the biggest part on the two stars was that it felt like I was listening to this audiobook forever.
He did a marvelous job with The Irish Stories, but he wasn’t quite the right fit for the rest.
A few of them are duds (by Bradbury standards, anyway), but even ones that tread old ground (like “The Lost City Of Mars”, where a group of people find said city, which traps them by appearing to be their own personal idea of paradise) are told so well that it’s hard to be too critical – although Bradbury’s tendency to wax lyrical occasionally overwhelms the narrative.
I have enjoyed reading Ray Bradbury's stories for many years.
Even when the content doesn't really hold my interest, I read him anyway because of his wonderful and unique way with words.I read this collection many.
ˆn this case, his better stories (from a content standpoint) are at the front of the book.
Sometimes I just couldn't figure out why he even wrote the piece, since it seemed to go nowhere.But still, it's Ray Bradbury after all.
He's worth reading whether you like it or not.
This collection of stories is (in total) not his best, but there's still plenty of delight to make it worth a read.
Ray Bradbury was a major talent, and this collection showcases his style of melancholy fiction to its fullest extent. Bradbury's specialty was the liminal, the moment of phase transition between the last golden summer of youth and the weary cares of adulthood, or the release of the accumulated tensions of life into the quiet of the grave. These stories are moody, painterly, and yet, even as I write this review, they fade from my mind. Bradbury is strong wine, and not to my taste.
Some great, some good, some crap.Enjoyed this collection enough, nonetheless.
Reading this reminded me of how excited I was to watch The Martian Chronicles mini series back in the '80s.
As a highly sensitive, creative type who is on hiatus from all things involving the world and its current dramas, I, perhaps, should have turned to a comedic writer versus one who is so adept at creating a mood with his words.
Said moods tending to lean toward the morose side of human existence.
Bradbury is a talented, talented writer.
Anyway, if you LOVE Bradbury, but have yet to read this collection, then by all means, grab a copy and enjoy.
Each of these stories is a fine example of Mr. Bradbury's work. No matter how many times I read something he wrote, it returns to my TBR shelf.
One of the stories was brilliantly done (Night Call, Collect), but as for the rest, while being well-written, just didn't hold my attention.
I was a little annoyed by the repeats (The Haunting of The New and The Cold Wind and The Warm) as well.
Maybe my expectations were a little too high, or maybe it's because I've read quite a lot by Mr Bradbury lately, but I was actually quite bored with this one.
I think I said this in another review, but short stories really seem to be hit-or-miss for the author, while his other stuff is pretty good.
Bradbury is undoubtedly the best science-fiction writer. This collection of short stories is mind-blowing. He wrote about things that I couldn't even imagine how he could link the story to the title in such a beautiful smart way! My first read and won't be the last.
