I like these clean Christian romances by Grace Livingston Hill; however, I will say that her good characters are almost too perfect and her bad ones horribly evil, which can make them amusing although that's not the intent.
Another classic from the late, legendary Grace Livingston Hill!
Revel does not get along with his father. His mother died and now, two years later, his father is going to remarry. Revel goes to the woods to clear his head and meets Margaret. They keep in contact through the mail for a time and love blossoms. Revel sends a package that Margaret never receives and they donâ€™t correspond for a couple years, but fate intervenes.This book shows you a different way of thinking about young romance. You will also note a different style of writing.
Found this in a used bookstore, an old solid colored hardcover with crinkly pages and a cursive handwritten note inside the cover. Had no idea what it was about, but was surprised and delighted at such a lovely story! So very sweet!
So sweet!
If this is the book I'm thinking of its a book about fate and chance meetings and was actually really good despite the cheesy cover shown here- not the original cover. I happened on it in the public library about 15 yrs ago and it may be hard to find now. I like how the story begins and ends with the footprints.

I picked up this book at a library sale and it was great! It was written in 1942 and is nice and clean and a great story of Christian Romance! If anyone would like to borrow it, let me know.
I was on a Grace Livingston Hill kick a while back and read several of her novels. They are always quaint and old-fashioned, sometimes a little preachy, but almost always a nice relaxing read.
I really love the parts where you get to laugh at Mrs. Martin.
Not her best, but a sweet story.
