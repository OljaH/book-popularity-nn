Life in the Annawadi slum is brutal, and sometimes your neighbors are the ones most determined to make you suffer.
The competition for limited resources and the need for most human beings to feel superior to someone makes many of the slumdwellers behave abominably, thinking only of their own survival while lying, cheating, and ruining the lives of their neighbors.
I can understand the author's purpose in showing us what life is like in a Mumbai slum, and how changes in the global economy affect those who subsist on the garbage left by the wealthy.
This is the one thing I did find that was most praiseworthy about some of the people in the slum.
MY RELATIONSHIP WITH KATHERINE BOO DID NOT START WELLWhat, we need another well-off well-bred well-fed well-educated white person to tell us about the miseries of extreme poverty in the developing world?
It’s like in so many movies about the poor countries, you have to have a white guy as the hero – The Last King of Scotland, which is about Uganda, or The Constant Gardener, about Kenya; and lots more.
As for the police, they are like kidnap gangs where the victims politely walk up to them and ask to be kidnapped.
Is the famous Indian fatalism now more likely to be found in the decayed working class of Birmingham England?
This is much scarier than any STEPHEN KING novel.
According to Boo's book,the "Undercity" is still there.
I wished that this was a novel.
It is hard to read because the details of life which I take for granted, are not even dreams for the scavengers of Mumbai.
This is a must read for anyone who thinks that he has a hard life.
Although, the tale is of abject poverty and sanctioned cruelty by corrupt institutions and those with a little bit of power, the people (not characters) are well developed and memorable.
Some people can not hold to their dreams and give up.
I knew this wouldn't be a feel-good book, but somehow the evocative title and the tragically poetic cover led me to be unprepared for the shocks that awaited from page one right through to the end.My advice to all who want to read it: first, read the author's note at the end, it is excellent. It situates the book in its proper context and prepares you to take it seriously. Without this anchor, the melodrama of the narrative seems like Days of Our Lives set in Indian slums. But apart from the au
But, particularly among the young, we also see hope, hard work, integrity and understanding.It is not an attractive image of the rise of capitalist India, and though we know it is a narrow view which only considers one slum in one city, its reality carries weight.Some more things that impressed me from the author's note: she says that the people who feature knew that everything they did and said would not come out 'pretty' in the book, but they participated because they shared the author's concerns about the distribution of opportunity in a fast changing country.She found that the children were more sensitive, they were not yet the cold, indifferent adults who turn the other way when someone is hurt, or shrug when someone suicides.

It often happens that I stay up with a book overnight because it is too good to be put down for something as mundane as sleep.
But this shockingly, heart-wrenchingly, even exhilaratingly real and excruciatingly beautiful book is definitely one of them.
[ This is my 'book-of-the-year' - being the one book I am most grateful to have read in the year.
]- Full review will be put up after the second reading...
I had three days to spend in Mumbai this February, and, reading my Lonely Planet guidebook, I considered undertaking a "slum tour." According to Lonely Planet, there was a company that did it right, a "sensitive" tour.
I know enough of life to understand that poverty makes for desperation, but that people everywhere long at root for the same basic things: a better life for themselves and, most of all, their children.Katherine Boo's book was recommended to me by someone who knew I'd been to India.
I kept asking myself how the author knew these intimate details of people's lives and innermost thoughts.
For the life-blood of the system they live in is bribery and corruption, at every single strata of society, from the Tamil who runs a couple of garish video console games as a loss leader, lending the road boys the rupee they need to play Metal Slug 3 and thus locking them into dependency on him as agent for the rubbish they harvest; the slum school set up to rake in government funding where children are taught only on the days an inspector is due; to the police who give metal strippers a tip-off about lax construction site security for a share in the profit; through to the executive officer of the state of Maharashtra and the Corporator of Ward 27 who reinvents himself as low-caste, with all the requisite documentation, in order to comply with a new legal requirement that all candidates for election should come from the lower caste; right up to the rich who pay out small sums to part slum dwellers from their property and thus reserve for themselves certificates of long-term residency that qualify them for ownership of the valuable new government-funded slum replacement housing.
(view spoiler)[Usually I only drink one or two but then I can only afford plonk (hide spoiler)]I first listened to an abridged version of this book and was intrigued.
It was more my interest was kindled than I really enjoyed listening to it - the abridgement was too sketchy and so I got the book.
2 stars for the abridged version.The book, the real deal, dead trees and ink made from oak gall and old rubber tyres was too verbose and repetitive, I felt like saying ok, I get it, time and again.
And none of the people Katherine Boo chronicles in her poetic and moving book Behind the Beautiful Forevers comes anywhere close to winning a game show or finding the love of their lives.
Behind the Beautiful Forevers is more than just a chronicle of the life of one Mumbai slum.
As Boo writes: In places where government priorities and market imperatives create a world so capricious that to help a neighbor is to risk your ability to feed your family, and sometimes even your own liberty, the idea of a mutually supportive poor community is demolished.

To briefly sum up the plot, this is a the story of Annawadi, a slum settled right in the heart of the a
While I found the horrors I expected, such as unsanitary living conditions and life-threatening ways in which to earn enough money to survive, I also saw a people filled with hope.
The same hope as many of us here in America.Behind the Beautiful Forevers loses some Stars because I got a little caught up in the mire of sooooooo many individual stories.
At the end of the day, the main character of this book was the slum itself – the people only lived there.Favorite quote:
Boo won me over when she presented the impoverished people of Annawadi as individuals with worries, ambitions and desires as everyday as yours or mine rather than victims.
I found myself brokenhearted by the recurrent police and governmental corruption they must wade through in order to just exist.
I may re-read it some time in the future.The book did cause me to reflect on many issues regarding what happened to the Annawadians when forced to move when Annawadi was cleaned up for aesthetic reasons.
However, I believe the real reason for the removal of Annawadi (and inner city homes) is not wanting a reminder that poverty exists.
I was greatly moved, and mostly uplifted, by this narrative account of the daily life and careers of real individuals and families in a slum near Mumbai’s airport called Annawadi.
It didn’t take much to take to heart the old Phil Ochs’ line that “there but for fortune go you or I.”My empathies were engaged the most for Abdul, a 16-something boy who has worked his heart out forever making money for his family from recycling of materials sorted from trash.
Extreme poverty usually strips "civilized" behavior from individuals and groups.
Poverty without hope destroys humanity.
Boo highlights the lives of several Mumbai slum inhabitants.
While some of her interviewees have hope of escaping the slum, none do so in the book, and as she shows, their future chances are extremely slim.
So why was the book unaffecting?
My heart goes out to the Mumbai slum dwellers, but I fear little can be done without a major overhaul to Indian society - - beginning with true education for all of its people.
But in choosing to write the book instead as "narrative non-fiction" she alienated me as a reader.
I couldn't get away from the fact that these were real people and real experiences, being described in terms of a novel.I would have also enjoyed the book if it had been written purely as a straightforward work of investigative journalism.
I just feel that the writing approach (for me) let the book down a bit.----------------------------------------------------------------------My first impression of the book 27/4/2014:This book is described as "narrative non-fiction".
I thought this book was non-fiction, but it turns out to be a novel.
The deaths (read suicides) of some of the lead characters are portrayed in the exact simplicity as their going to sleep after a hard day’s work.
Sometimes, you maybe able to see it coming, but at other times, it will strike you out of the blue, and you may want to re-read the passage to digest that dreaded line.This book is about India that many Indians try to conceal behind fancy establishments.
Maybe, i was imagining their faces as I was reading this book.All this is going to stay with me for a while.I’d suggest this book to anyone who wants to see more of India than those hyper-marketed “Incredible India” advertisements.
After several hours, the man had died, and only then did people stop to help pick up the corpse.Despite the abject poverty, I found the book to be inspiring because so many of the families were hopeful that they could someday rise up out of the slum and join the more prosperous middle class of India.
As Boo noted, there were three ways out of the slum: an entrepreneurial niche (like scavenging for scrap metals), politics (meaning corruption), or education.
Rise, Manju, rise!Update Aug. 2013: This is still my favorite nonfiction book I've read this year.
I must take up this issue at the upcoming Housing meeting.While meticulously placing their cups avoiding the untimely melody of their exquisite china, the urban snobs critique twirling their freshly sprayed coifs; applauded the heroic effort of a certain Katherine Boo for having the balls to submit herself to the putrid cocktail of sewage stench and decaying garbage for nearly four years.
On an eventful itinerary to India pick out a slum and pen the daily events of a close knitted neighborhood huddled together in congested housing.
I reckon the raspberry macaroons go very well with oolong and I might skip the Housing meeting .
I've not read a ton of narrative nonfiction, but Katherine Boo's account of the Annawadi slum in Mumbai and the people who inhabit it makes for a thrilling and moving audiobook.
So instead of me telling you what the book is about (there's a synopsis) or acting like an expert on poverty (which I am not), I'll offer a list.
Of course, this is part of the appeal of the book: it represents not just a single person or family's story, but is a story of many people.
As I started to read Behind the Beautiful Forevers, I expected a book akin to poverty porn, a literary version of those awful commercials that broadcast photos of downtrodden children on squalid streets whom you can save for only “one dollar a day!” But what I read was both a meticulous character study and a treatise on the livelihoods of an undercity; a protest against all forms of corruption and a captivating, almost seemingly fictitious, legal narrative; a celebration of 21st century free-market capitalism and an indictment of 21st century free-market capitalism.
Everyone is suffering; is someone’s suffering lessened just because people like the residents of Annawadi are suffering more?Behind the Beautiful Forevers is a story of many things.
What disturbed Me most about this book is that it didn't disturb Me more.
How is it that a book about the poorest, most exploited, ignored, trodden upon people didn't evoke more feeling or sustain more engagement?
I spent the entire reading reminding myself that these were real people so that I would endeavor to feel something toward their story.
I'm not sure if it was the choice of writing style -- that of making the story "feel like a novel" -- that made this so easy to disengage from or not, but something didn't work.
If you liked Slumdog Millionaire you will probably like this book.
I hated Slumdog Millionaire and I didn't like this book.
Boo tells the stories of several people who are trying to rise above their situations.
Then Abdul is accused of a crime, and the global recession hits Mumbai.Why I didn't like this book:1.
Boo says she did years of research, countless interviews with the people in the book, and that she has even captured their thoughts.
But I probably won't like the movie any better than I did Slumdog Millionaire.
The crookedness and crumbling are everywhere and the people Boo chooses to visit and document over several years are those on the society's bottom rung.This is a difficult book to read, at some times even more than others, but also important as it is real.
These people are living now (or at least as of date of publication!) in what is in some respects one of the most thriving countries on earth, but also one of the most troubled.Highly recommended and, lest the reader forget, there are places like Annawadi all over the world whether they are physically the same or in the way they kill the inhabitants' spirit.
The first time allows you to listen to the details of the individuals and judge their validity.
The second time, having completed the book, you can better judge the author's conclusions.
It is here that I wanted a bit more from the book.
I did not find it difficult to follow the numerous individuals even when listening.
I believe Boo wanted to show how different people will behave differently, but she also wanted to study which behavior would lead to improvement/success.
I actually got closer to the souls of the fictional characters in McCann's book than I did to the real ones in Boo's!
I had read that this book was well-written and would probably win some awards, which is why I picked it up.
As others have said, it reads like a novel, the characterizations are so finely-drawn.
Yes, we have gross inequalities in our own society, but I doubt anything can touch what you will read in these pages.
'We try so many things', as one Annawadi girl put it, 'but the world doesn't move in our favor.' "(p.219) I have a feeling I will be thinking about this book for a long time to come.
A much hyped book - I had heard and read a lot about it including high praise from some usually trusty sources.
I get it - life in a Mumbai sluim is brutish but the writing style tries too hard to shock and quickly left me jaded.
On the plus side, the book is a salutary reminder of the all pervasiveness of corruption - it permeates every level, and thwarts every well intentioned social scheme.
And no, much as I would have loved to read about change for the better, I am not judging her work for its bleakness.
I experienced the filth, poverty, disease (in the streets, 'almost-dead-people' sitting under filthy sinks reaching for drips of water in train bathrooms) --dirty hospitals (trying to get help myself) -- Food shortage --(eating only one small meal myself in the small 'poor village'), --- not enough room for sleeping in the small 'hut' (either made of hay or cardboard).
I also had the opportunity during that year adventure in India to visit an Indian Woman who lived in Goa (Southern India) -- stay in her house (middle class standard) -- I was given 3 meals a day during this period.
One of those books that gets better with a re-read.
It makes a good book to use in reading classes.Old Review:So wow.
Using the micro chasm of a few families in an Indian slum, Boo looks at how economic forces control lives for removed for the big CEO.
Take the character of Asha; it would've been very easy for Boo to make her a total bitch, but she didn't.
Sometimes I felt the descriptions were a bit too flowerly, but in terms of characterization and conveaying the people to the reader I though she did a good job.
What they have, they salvaged from the dump.The stench in the air, like incense, reaches the highest God, Brahman.
pray for those who are sick, pray for the dying,pray for a better job,for food that doesn’tcome from the dump.ask the Indian governmentfor help.write a book about it,and hope to shame thosewho are shameless.beg to be released fromyour karma, and if you can’t be released,hope your next life willbe better.There was a little boy who worked in the recycle plant, shredding plastic until his hand got caught in the shredder.

That most of these brave souls resist the lure of suicide is a testament to a life force that few of us can imagine.
