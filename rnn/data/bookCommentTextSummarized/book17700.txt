4.5 stars!!!  Vi Keeland and Penelope Ward delivered a fantastic enemies to lovers/work place romance with Hate Notes. This book was fun, sexy, and heartwarming. Both Reed and Charlotte were endearing and the twist was not something I saw coming. The way Charlotte meets Reed... it's interesting to say the least. While going to sell her unused wedding gown, she finds a gown she absolutely falls in love with. As the store will only give her in-store credit, she trades her gown for this one. Inside
Both Reed and Charlotte were endearing and the twist was not something I saw coming.
The way Charlotte meets Reed...
While going to sell her unused wedding gown, she finds a gown she absolutely falls in love with.
Then she finds out it's working with/for Reed.
Charlotte is sweet and Reed finds her amusing, with her 'bucket list' and all.
My heart was hurting towards the end, and there was even a point I was in tears, but my goodness did I love the way this book ended.
I loved the unique spin on the enemies to lovers/work romance.
Underwhelming *Big Spoilers***Unpopular Opinion**Look, I highlighted the crap out of this book but only because the whole thing was just too improbable and the plot sort of ran itself ragged, lacking a cohesive arc.
By a stroke of luck, Charlotte finds a love note that, as it turns out, leads her to Reed.
By another stroke of luck, she’s immediately hired by Reed’s grandmother because, of course, Reed was mean to her and while she was hiding in the bathroom, crying her eyes out, serendipity happens.
However much she assured that she wanted to be with him no matter what, he insisted that he shouldn’t have her as she deserves a better future with a (view spoiler)[healthier (hide spoiler)] man.Some divine intervention was necessary for Reed to understand that he should change his way of thinking and it of course happens.
Add some more drama about Charlotte’s mother to this sad tone of the book in the second half and you get a totally depressing 100 or more pages before their HEA.***********************************************There are few scenes where they get intimate so do not expect a hot romance; this is more like a mixture of fun and sad romance.***********************************************I really don’t understand why these writers do that.

:)Ps. Epilogue was so sweet, I absolutely loved it!!!
:D (^_^)Release date: Tuesday, November 6, 2018COVER REVEAL: SYNOPSISIt all started with a mysterious blue note sewn into a wedding dress.
Something blue.
That’s when I found another bride’s “something old.” Stitched into the lining of a fabulously feathered design was the loveliest message I’d ever read: Thank you for making all of my dreams come true.
If only my true-love fantasies had stopped there.
Thanks to a twist of fate, he’s my new boss.
But that’s not going to stop me from discovering the story behind his last love letter.
☺LET THE FUN TIMES BEGIN!What will happen to Charlotte & Reed?Will there be a HEA?READ THE BOOK TO FIND OUT ☺══════════════════ THAT WAS ADORABLE!!!!Charlotte is such a sweet and slightly crazy person!
Amazing cast!I SO need to see this as a movie!I loved reading this book.It was hilarious and sweet and romantic and crazy and office-y and sad and heartbreaking and moving.Charlotte and Reed are just perfect for each other - Iris knew all along.
BUT Reed was too adorable for the religion to make me hate the book.
(hide spoiler)]HATE NOTES was such a fresh and funny and very serious & heartbreaking rom-com-drama!I adored (aaaalllmost) everything about it!
*****FIVE STARS*****{ARC Generously Provided by Author}I wanted to taste her lips and suck away that sour look on her face, yet I knew that if there was one set of lips on this earth forbidden to me, it was Charlotte Darling’s.
This story had an endearing Heroine, a ridiculously sexy Hero with an abrasive attitude, and enough angst, heart, and steam to keep a romance reader’s appetite thoroughly satiated.While I swooned over Reed, I developed a huge girl crush for Charlotte.
There were surprises that I never expected from this story and it even made me shed a few tears.Here are my overall ratings:Hero: 4.5Heroine: 5Plot: 5Angst: 4.5Steam: 5Chemistry Between Hero & Heroine: 5HATE NOTES releases on November 6th!

They pulled a card with a long-lasting dicease, so I don't feel comfortable to complain a lot about the book...In a nutshell -> 🙄🙄🙄 same old incl. evil ex, clumsy heroine with hyperbolic hormonal level, who threw her beautiful self at the man, who rejected her repeatedly;handsome hero, whose rudeness was sold as alphaness 🙄; this time without secret baby, but with an old adoption of the heroine. What I liked: air typing - cool idea! It was on KU.
5 Stars!(ARC provided by author) Charlotte Darling is a 27 yr. old woman from Brooklyn who is newly single and in need of a fresh start. She’d recently lost everything including her belief in happily ever afters. Then while in a vintage clothing store she stumbles upon a gorgeous gown with a blue love note stitched into the lining of the dress. It’s embossed with the name Reed Eastwood. It’s the most romantic words she’s ever read. This note gives her hope that true love and romance exists.She h
This note gives her hope that true love and romance exists.She has built up this stranger to be the perfect man, but when she crosses paths with her dream man he’s not the Prince Charming she envisioned.
Now he’s forced to be around Charlotte and her cheery attitude.
Reed becomes completely infatuated with Charlotte, and the feelings are mutual.
As they explore what’s between them, will they have a future together, or is Charlotte in love with a man she can never have?
He'd made me feel things I never had before.-I needed to be one with this man more than anything in the world.
While I loved the epilogue and I felt like that gave us some good closure, I wanted more of them trying to be an actual couple and experiencing what that looked like.Brief Summary of the Storyline:  This is Charlotte and Reed's story.
Through bucket lists, funny situations, some deep moments, and some sexual tension...they fall in love and get a HEA ending.POV: This alternated between Charlotte and Reed's POV.Overall Pace of Story:  Good.
Genre: Contemporary RomanceType: StandalonePOV: First Person - DualRating: Just when Charlotte Darling thought there was no such thing as fairytale in real life, she found a love note sewn into a wedding dress at a vintage store.
There was always something magical about her, the way she’d just appeared in my life and turned it upside down.
It’s rare for me to love a female character, but Charlotte managed to make it on the list.
It’s quite entertaining to see him flustered by Charlotte “craziness”.
The story was funny and entertaining, and I like the secondary characters in their lives.
Will definitely wait for friend reviews on this one.
Cannot trust either the cover appeal or blurb for assumptions on content with these two authors.FYI: for the skeptical like myself this is currently a kindle unlimited release.
Might give it a whirl.
Have not seen any good unbiased reviews yet.3.75- 4 stars.🌟🌟🌟🌟Well, color me surprised.
I actually liked it.
No cheating, OW drama or major bombshell revelations.It gives me hope.
I had intended to avoid these authors books for a while based on Vi Keelands latest solo release and my diminishing enjoyment for their newer novels.
3 I didn’t love it like everyone else stars.A lot of people loved this book.
I usually like Vi Keeland and Penelope Ward reads but there are have been one or two books I just didn’t jive with and this is one of them.I didn’t get the feels like everyone else did and some where emotional, but like I said I.JUST.DID.NOT.FEEL.ITSebastian York is a seasoned audio narrator and I love his acting but I have listened to so many books with his voice, I’m okay finding a new narrator.
Like I said, this book didn’t click with me.

Took the romantic idea of a love note and held on to it.
Hate Notes-November 6th 2018For more Reviews, Free E-books and Giveaways
Hate notes by Vi keeland and Penelope Ward is a sweet (ISH) romance with a little Smut (not as much as we would normally get from these 2 author 😕) it's a fast read as you are routing for a happy ending they both deserve.There's some heartbreak,a little stalking (which will make you giggle) a little bickering,a little loving and a happy ending.If you looking for a quick romance with a few giggle's along the way and a couple of tears this is the book for you I highly recommend it 💕
In a moment of loneliness and vulnerability, Charlotte gets the dress in exchange for hers and decides to stalk the Reed in the note since he proves that love and romance still exist.
As she stalks Reed over the interwebs, she finds out that he is a high end realtor and books a showing with gag jobs.
Charlotte breaks down and ends up stumbling into the bathroom where lo and behold, Reed's grandmother gives her comfort, and a job- as Reed's assistant.What are the odds?So far it was quite funny.
This was snarky and fun and I always enjoy second-chance romances.
Reed and Charlotte are both imperfect and weird in their own ways, and I enjoyed the way they set each other off.
The first scene with the wedding dress completely had me, and the two continued to grow on me throughout the book.
This was definitely a slow burn, which I loved, and had the perfect balance of snarky friendship scenes versus steam versus bedroom moments.
I really liked how the book explored the issues of (view spoiler)[ chronic illness and potential long-term disability  (hide spoiler)] and how those can be something that destroys a weaker couple or brings a strong match closer together.
What I loved: This has some really fun banter between the main characters for most of the book.
Reed was pretty antagonistic with Charlotte but not in a hateful way despite the title.
He provoked her more because he loved how she reacted which is what made this fun.What I didn’t love: The pushing away.
I felt we lost the fun banter once Charlotte got up the nerve to ask Reed out.
I wish that part could have ended sooner but I’m also not a fan of the “I’m not good enough for you” pushing.Overall, an enjoyable read and listen.
3.5 Stars ⭐
3.5 Stars ⭐️
The blue note is romantic and heartfelt, and Charlotte is so moved she tracks the author, Reed Eastwood, but she finds he’s nothing like what she imagined.
I do enjoy antagonistic romances, but I don’t like it if they get really mean.
When Charlotte and Reed meet, they started off on the wrong foot, but they get to know the person underneath when forced to work together.
Reed on the surface was serious and could be a bit broody, but his actions showed his big loving heart!
I loved Hate Notes!
4★★★★Stars   Genre:  Contemporary Romance Type:  Standalone POV:  First Person - Dual    Charlotte Darling had been cheated and now with a broken heart and jobless she was definitely in need of a change from her poor sad life.  One drunken night was all it took to change her life for good.   "I think it's better to spend years treasuring a memory that might hurt sometimes than to never make one at all."   Reed Eastwood didn't believe in love any longer; after finding out the person he loved did
Charlotte Darling had been cheated and now with a broken heart and jobless she was definitely in need of a change from her poor sad life.
Reed Eastwood didn't believe in love any longer; after finding out the person he loved didn't truly loved him he was done trying to find a second change.
"Charlotte had no idea the level of impact she'd had on my life, the depth of my feelings for her, because I'd never told her."
Charlotte's character was refreshing her craziness was actually appealing and I found her very likable.
Overall; Hate Notes is an excellent story about true love and second changes.
Get it here: Amazon US * Amazon UKThis was a great boss/employee story that had me intrigued from the very beginning.
Getting his POV really changed how I felt about him in the beginning and he went from being just another douchebag boss to a character with a lot of depth.
She always found something to smile about and I really enjoyed that from her character.
She even made Reed smile, which I loved.
Overall, this is a book I would recommend to anyone that enjoys an A-hole hero and a funny heroine that changes his ways.
HAPPY BOOK BIRTHDAY!!There are authors who lean towards angst and drama, others who love their romances achingly sweet and swoony.
With Hate Notes, the dynamic writing duo comforted by Penelope Ward and Vi Keeland hit the perfect blend of humor, animosity, angst, sweetness and touching emotion in this tale of two broken hearts who were destined to meet.When a jilted Charlotte Darling goes into a vintage clothing store to sell her unused wedding gown she finds the most fabulous wedding dress with the sweetest love note sewn into it.
And that paid off very well.I had a hard time with Charlotte at first because she runs afoul of the Shopkeeper Principle, which probably isn't really a thing.
Fortunately, Keeland makes that scene what it needs to be and I spent the rest of the story in love with Charlotte.
It's clearly 4½ stars, but rounding up when I had such a hard time with Charlotte in the beginning and with Reed through most of the middle doesn't work for me.
It is sweet and prolific with the ideas about love and living a life that matters, making me 100% enamored with this story and couple.
Understanding his distance and his reluctance to love Charlotte makes readers want these two to find their HEA together.
What really made me love this story, as with most of my favorite romances, are the themes the writers create from the journey of the characters.
For Hate Notes, the theme of living each moment you’ve been given, truly embracing life and experiencing all it has to offer is inspirational.
4-4.5 ⭐'s I don't think I will ever not like a Keeland/Ward book, however, after reading all of them, I do think they have become a bit formulaic.
And yes, Reed is a bit of a jerk but not like I had heard he was.
She was like a cat in heat...I mean come on!
😉And let me just say, I think that was the most interesting proposal I've ever read!
The epilogue...at first, I didn't care for the time lapse but as I read, I realized it was exactly what we needed.

FIVE~FAVORITE ~STARS *****I loved, loved, loved, loved this book.
Hate Notes is a 2018 most favorite read of the year for me; it was absolutely fantastic!
She’s now having to sell her wedding gown in order to get some money to at least eat and pay some bills, while she tries to find a new job.
The color of the dress, the whimsical design is just perfect, and Charlotte also finds a beautiful and romantic blue note sewn into the dress.
The note is written on the stationery of Reed Eastwood, and Charlotte is now obsessing about finding this guy.
