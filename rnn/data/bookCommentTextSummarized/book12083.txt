The story, if one can call it that, is a mixture of incomplete biographical memories and revenge fantasies as imagined by a prisoner in a cell who is apparently awaiting trial for a petty violent crime (or maybe he has already been convicted), but we're never sure because the prisoner is one of the most unreliable narrators ever committed to the printed page.
Adding layer upon layer in his fantasies, he demonizes the cops as vicious rapists, and then imagines the most disgusting forms of revenge against them -- treating them like dogs in training and submitting them to the most explicitly brutal cruelties one can imagine.There are parts of this book (including the rape of a female motorist) that will make you queasy, I promise you.
The Room is the opposite of Last Exit to Brooklyn and there is a sad explanation for this.
Last Exit was his first and The Room was his second.
The Room is a book written by heroin.Last Exit gives you a tour of hell, a panorama of suffering, drag queens, hoods, lathe operators, union bosses, working class wives, old people, bartenders.
The Room gives you one man's mind.
The guy is sick, the guy is insane.
288 pages of an insane guy muttering revenge fantasies about the police and about women.
Selby’s second novel is his attempt at a knockabout comedy—drunk vicars chatting up girls on the village green, various cream-heavy pastries being lobbed into the faces of pompous landowners, amusing misunderstandings between bachelors and the parents of honourable virgins.
On second thoughts, I might have the wrong book.
Selby’s most inventive book structurally and typographically, and a contender for his most shocking and hopeless (tough competition), The Room is a pitiful howl from a personal abyss (Selby’s?) most people won’t care to hear.
Si al leer el romance del prisionero no has podido evitar que una lagrimita ruede por tu sonrosada mejilla; si te gustó La vida de pi o El alquimista; si nunca entendiste que, siendo siete los continentes, Memorias de África no tuviera ni una sola secuela, ni se te ocurra acercarte a esta novela.En su celda, un preso sin nombre mata las horas recurriendo al gran poder de su imaginación.
Una imaginación dividida en dos canales claramente diferenciados pero que se enmarcan y se resaltan mutuamente.
To be honest, I couldn't have been more wrong.The Room is basically the story of a man in prison (for reasons we are not too sure of) and his fantasies of revenge against the police officers that put him there.
I personally found myself gasping at most of this book and feeling sick to my stomach, and believe me when I say that this does not happen often for me.How do you compose a near 300 page book out of just a man in his cell?
The man (we never find out his name) has a seriously imaginative brain and this teleports us to incredibly different settings, numerous stories and narratives folding into one.
I am giving this 5 stars not because I liked it, but because it succeeded in what it was trying to accomplish. A beyond disturbingly horrible nightmare of a read but brilliantly executed. The completely anti-climactic ending left me stunned when I realized what it meant to the story. Another 'underground man' a la Dostoevsky. Hubert Selby, Jr. was quoted as saying that he could not read it for decades after writing it. Well, nor will I be able to. That said and done, I would not recommend this book to anyone.
The Room is deeply disturbing, but in the kind of way that makes you think about all the little things most people take for granted. For the main character, his own sanity is compromised by claustrophobia and isolation.
This is one of the only books I have ever read that made me outright nauseous.
Selby's violent and brutal and graphic descriptions of revenge were so real and vivid that I had to keep putting this book down to clear my head.
But the fact that an author is capable of making me feel such a strong and real queasiness makes me completely in awe of him.
While the narrative switches from the reality of the protagonist (who remains nameless throughout) to his fantasy world of beating the system as a hero to his graphic and horrific revenge fantasies, he remains completely serious amd dead pan throughout.
Reality as such becomes complete nonsense, a chain of few obsessive acts and gestures; time ceases to exist (lights are never turned off inside the cell, making it impossible to discern between day and night).
Selby's second book, a nameless convict takes us on a journey through his claustrophobic, deranged psyche: a bottomless pit of hate and frustration and desire that soon turns into a parallel world in which any fantasy of revenge can be satisfied.
According to the fragmented story we learn from his desperate soliloquy, the protagonist was arrested for no apparent reason by two sadistic officers (who also knocked him unconscious) and then locked into the TB ward, in solitary confinement, in order to further humiliate him.Is this story true?
Published in 1972, it was seen by the author as the most extreme of his novels, and one that he wasn't able to read again for 20 years after completion.
Having read Selby Jr's more well known novels, I know that he has his own unique style, yet he is able to capture a mood or setting perfectly.
In this book, one feels the claustrophobic atmosphere of the cell, and can see the character lost in his terrible thoughts.
Given how close to the edge some of his other books are, be warned that this is by far the most extreme I've read by him, and indeed I'd say by any author.
For me this book was a DNF however I'm still choosing (after much thought) to give it 3 stars as I realised the DNF was on me NOT the book or authors writing style. This was clearly written by a genius with the ability to write from the point of view of a total nutter or a bi-poplar sufferer and for that I gave it the 3 stars it was ME who couldn't make head nor tail of the words on the page therefore I couldn't finish and do it justice.If you like them strange this books for you <3
i read this a long time ago, but i remember it being so disturbing that i wondered if it was even legal to have this freely available in a pubic library. i was also fully convinced that there was no possible way hubert selby jr wasnt a serial killer.
Violencia en estado puro sin una gota de valor literario. Es a la literatura lo que el porno al cine.
This is a one disturbing piece of work, most fucked up novel i've ever read
And also the most rewarding in terms of depth in the investigation of the most neglected and denied human proclivities.It is a book about the either liberating or devastating power of dreams, about their equally destructive and elating potential.When I got to the cops/dogs training part, I first wondered what cops had done to Selby to cause this utterly evil and crude, sadistic depiction of the obliteration of two souls.
It's a not so gentle reminder that we must be living and loving, cause we all die anyway, at some point, alive or not.This novel is a work of genius, and it is an awesome read.
Best. Writer. Ever.
The other reason (which applies to this particular book) is that due to the way it’s written, I feel it deserves two separate reviews: one for story, and another detailing Selby’s own unusual ‘homegrown’ writing style.
He certainly has a way of getting inside the twisted mind of a convict to make the reader feel like an accomplice to all those terrible fantasies.
This makes Selby seem very unsympathetic towards his characters, yet like all good writers he knows that this kind of detachment is vital.
This is my third Selby journey; every time I pick him up again, I find myself drawn down into the murky black pit of horrific reality he creates.
Anyone with an aversion to negative or abrasive writing, anyone that lets despairing, violent, powerful art infect them and dislikes the feeling, should stay the hell away from this (and all Selby, but especially this).
The Room feels like an attack on your psyche, a rabid dog gnawing at your soul.
I stop, I think, to marvel at the effect the writing is having on me, to wonder how I could sink so deep inside something so awful.
While it still has all of the elements of a good Selby book, by about halfway through the book I couldn't help but feel that it was getting a bit repetitive.The story is one of a man who may or may not be wrongly imprisoned, and his sadistic and brutal thoughts of revenge on the people who put him in this place.
Needless to say, a story like this can't help but become repetitive after a while.Selby mines the depths of human depravity and sadism to get into the head of the narrator, and the result is nothing short of revolting.
Pero es otra perspectiva, otro estilo, otra escritura que es bueno conocer.
Ahora puedo imaginar qué es estar en la mente de un desquiciado, de un ser marginal, sociópata de principio a fin.
Nada de los horrores o asquerosidades de este texto le justifican (aunque lo intenta pobre y reiterativamente), aún así, le comprendes en su locura.De esos libros que llegan justo a tiempo.
Aquí no hay grandes frases ni poesía.
Pero está bien.
No quedarían con el texto, sería forzarlo a ser algo que no pretende...
pero personalmente, amo unas buenas frases y subrayar pasajes.
Cosa que no ocurrió acá.
A small time criminal is kept locked in a cell, we do not get to know his name, nor the exact reason why he is in jail, but we know that he is going to be there for a very long time, and we get to share all that comes to his mind.
As the time passes, and the fantasies become sicker and sicker, he completely withdraws himself from reality, and comes to dread the human contact he had earlier so much longed for.
Provocative and rich in mental anguish, Selby's second book can be forgiven for essentially being one long rant on the state of law enforcement and the system that allows the inherent cruelty, bigotry, and sadism to flourish without punishment. More to come . . .
Can we trust a man whose violent dado-sexual fantasies cause us to recoil in horror?So violent and horrific are the visions in fact, that I was greatly tempted to give this book 1 star.
It is the most disturbing and senselessly violent book I have ever read in my entire life.
The Room has burned it's own special hell within my brain" before going on to say "I have never thrown away a book but I didn't want to risk anyone else having to read it." In many ways I do not disagree.
A lot of people have probably read this book and only taken away the intense anger of the narrator and all the brutal violence and callous evil depicted in some of the scenes, and there certainly is a lot of it, but others will hopefully take away the knowledge that there is something deeply wrong with this world.
Thank whatever god you believe in that there have always been artists like Hubert Selby Jr. who have been blessed with the talent and courage to show us and remind us that humans are still capable of feeling compassion for each other, and that it may not be too late to cure the sickness so that those who feel locked up with anger and frustration and sadness may finally leave "the room."
Not that impressed.
I know he is highly acclaimed and feel perhaps I should read something else of his to see if it's just me.
A lot of people marked this as horrific or shockingly disturbing, and I suppose it probably was at time of release.
I won’t recommend it to anyone with a weak stomach (involves some descriptive torture - some physical, some sexual, mostly psychological) but it was fairly tame compared to a lot of stuff that’s out there.
Nothing was all that impressive to me and it took me a while to finish, because I was sort of bored with it and distracted by other reading.
I wouldn't give this book five stars if it wasn't for the residual effects of Cubby's writing.
I've read Requiem and Brooklyn, and didn't actually enjoy reading them���; but I was very affected.
He has this way of making stories hurt your feelings.I've done a prison term and have experienced solitary confinement.
This book is about neither.
It's a metaphorical account of human psychology.
It explores the banality of violence and the repetition of fantasy.
I don't think many people understood the court transcripts and hellacious fantasy juxtoposistion, but it is very effective if you get through it.
I was reading this haunting book on my way to London in 2014.
I was on a bus and I was looking out the window while reading the book and so the New-York suburbs in the book became London suburbs, but the story didn't change and it was indeed a disgusting, perverted story about a condemned man and his paranoiac ravings in prison, his past, his present, his future, full with nauseating scenes, sexy scenes, all one splotch of hate in this book.
See, when a book inspires you to write is not always a good thing, but I don't really care.
This book was a masterpiece. A sick, twisted, puke-inducing, gut-wrenching masterpiece. At the same time I want to never see this book again (although I know I will in my nightmares) and I want to start it again right away.
Uno de los libros más violentos que he leído en los últimos tiempos, no apto para estómagos sensibles (y lo digo muy en serio), sobre la impunidad, el destructivo deseo de venganza y la doble moral de las fuerzas del orden.
this is some white boy book bullshit
