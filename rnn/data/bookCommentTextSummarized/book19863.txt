Well, it's mine....so, er...yeah, a little biased. :) Shameless. I know, I know!
You start off tidying up but then you find something you forgot you had like a Katie Morag book or a recorder and you spend like a half an hour just fucking around with it and by the time you get back down to business, you can't be bothered cleaning any more and it all gets kicked right back under the bed because fuck it - no one's going to look under there.
He tasted a year old.He tasted like deceit.You're probably wondering what the hell this has to do with Legend.

____________________________________________The book was badassy greatly thrilly epic.I enjoyed every bit of it.It was also confusing because when I think about the characters,they are only fifteen and they are like Einstein smart and Bruce Lee strong,and when I was their age I didn't even know how to boil an egg.Way to build my self-esteem.But come on that's why I am a reader.To read about things that seem so unbelievable to achieve,but in the end proving that everything is possible.That's why I love reading.____________________________________________
A dystopian well worth reading!We've got two narrators: the notorious criminal, Day, and the noble citizen, though a little rebellious, June.
Day has escaped death before, and he's only trying to survive while taking care of his family, especially his sick brother.
June got a perfect score on her Trial and she's trying to get revenge for her brother's death.
We go through the story on both sides, night and day, and we're persuaded to root for each of them the all the same.
We did get enough to still make sense of it and enjoy the story, though.
Yes, I realize that’s not a word, but I have to admit I’m a bit sleep deprived seeing as I stayed up all night reading this FRICKEN AMAZING book!!
Marie Lu has created a book where the voices are powerful, the narrative is commanding, and the plot is explosive… all the way to the absolute end.
The characters in this book, including Day, June, Tess and Kaede are definitely qualified to pull this series through to the end and I’m curious how the relationships between these four will play out.
I liked both June and Day, and I was eager to learn more about the big mystery behind why the government is so interested in Day's brother.
The best thing about Legend, however, is the terrific action sequences that the author writes into the story: there are great chases, exciting escape scenes, girl on girl sparring, and lots more.
While the story is certainly well-written, most readers will be able to anticipate pretty much every plot development and thought that crosses the characters' minds...and really, what's the fun in that?Still, I liked this book and I think it's among the better dystopian YA books that have been released lately.
not to the extent that you ever mistake one for the other, because their circumstances are completely different, howevs they do indeed sound like one character split into two.
this would have been fine - two star-crossed lovers from different sides of the tracks that are in reality one soul split in two - oh true love and all that.
i'm not gonna lie, i had a great time reading this, but i think that if every book is going to be a variation on a theme, we gotta start raising the bar.
“Each day means a new twenty-four hours. Each day means everything's possible again. You live in the moment, you die in the moment, you take it all one day at a time.” So I finally decided to pick this up after sifting through all the reviews and reading positive after negative after positive after negative, sometimes I guess you just have to see for yourself. And Legend was all right, pretty good when compared to some of the crap I've read recently, it just wasn't anything particularly spectac
This gives me hope that Marie Lu is simply withholding her world building to prolong the reader's interest, but I just hope that I'm not left hanging on this matter at the end of the second book too.Another thing I didn't like - because I couldn't believe in it - was all the huge leaping to conveniently accurate conclusions.
Those who keep loving trashy dystopias with a forbidden romance story, those who liked any of those books I listed in the second paragraph.
This book fell short of a solid 5 for me because it had two small things I didn’t like, but otherwise it was golden.What I truly enjoyed:• Two unique POV’s of the hunter and the hunted –and I love, love, loved that the girl was the one sent to hunt Day, the criminal, as I tend to see this trope usually in the reverse.• The action scenes –since I had read The Young Elites I already knew Lu had talent in this arena (that end duel!), and while there was no magic powers this time around Day’s POV was especially good (the chase through the hospital!)• Mary Lu’s pacing is extraordinary, she knows what is too much and she gives us just the right amount.
Gets it’s hands on a few weapons in the form of interesting characters and solid writing, so when Blood Red Road makes a surprise attack from out of nowhere, Legend puts up a decent fight.However, lurking menacingly in the shadows are the Chaos Walking trilogy and Shipbreaker.
To start with, the good:Legend is a fast-paced, action-based novel that makes for quick, immersive reading.
At the end of the day, Legend is an entertaining book.
It’s fun to read, particularly if you like fast paced books with a cinematic feel.
That said, I don’t think it’s the most solid of dystopian novels out there.
4.5 stars.
I've been putting this one off forever because I thought I was pretty much over dystopian YA.
But friends won't stop raving about this trilogy (still) and...
it turns out it IS awesome.
The story has the typical dystopian society with an evil dictator, military control, and gifted teens who get sorted in life by a test.
The girl discovers the side she's working for has a hidden agenda and that the rebels might actually be the ones to help...
Marie Lu's writing is wonderful, the characters are all strong, and the story's so concise & action-packed that it read like a Hollywood blockbuster kind of movie.
I love that even though Day and June were enemies at first because of what June thought happened to her brother, they came together and found out the truth.
I better love the next two books because I'm losing the battle of trilogies lately.
The characters of June, Day and Tess were awesome!
Day is a sort of Robin Hood, steal from the rich and give to the poor.
They only let the rich people in, the jerks.
This turns out to be the brother of June, who is automatically brought in as a soldier of sorts to hunt down and bring Day to justice.
Marie just announced it - you can see it here!
https://twitter.com/Marie_Lu/status/1...I'm honestly not the biggest fan of dystopian as a genre, but oh my, Marie Lu nailed the characters.
thinking about Day...Day and June are so sweet and I LOVED their chemistry.
I'm not sure why Marie Lu didn't just make them 17 or 18- which would be much more believable.
The story is super fun, and as long as you find yourself connecting to Day and June- you'll definitely enjoy the series just based on them and their interaction.

The following gif shows my feeling toward this book:Okay, I can handle teenagers being stupid and clueless about how the world works, but I can't handle 15 years old teenagers who are supposed to be geniuses to act like a pair of hopeless idiots for an entire book.I am not a huge fan of dystopian novels but I especially dislike authors coming up with dystopian worlds which make no sense at all with governments doing evil things and killing off children for no good reason other than to show off how evil and fucked up said government is.
Legend by Marie LuHolyyyyy, omg, where do i start..This book was absolutely incredible!From the time i read the first page, i knew it was going to be great, but never as amazing as it truly was.
The characters were incredible, the world was so incredibly vivid that i literally feel like i just watched a movie and didn't read a book, even though i got all of the emotional aspects as well.
hahaha!Please, do yourself a favour and go read this book.It is now one of my all time favourites, and I cannot wait to continue the series!!:D
Sin embargo, habitan en mundos opuestos: June es una chica privilegiada, destinada a ocupar un lugar en la elite del país por su condición de niña prodigio y Day vive en la clandestinidad y se dedica a sabotear los manejos de un gobierno que considera corrupto y asesino.Los caminos de June y de Day se cruzan cuando Metías el hermano de June es asesinado, y Day se convierte en el principal sospechoso del crimen.✨✨✨It's a dystopia where The Republic is embarked on an interminable war with the neighboring country, the Colonies.June and Day, two citizens of the Republic, are the same age and live in the same city.


And I wasn't entirely disappointed because Legend features a strong, kick-ass heroine, a disturbing future world, multi-cultural characters, and tons of action.
Legend tells the story of a two remarkable 15-year-olds, Day and June, living on West cost of the United States now known as The Republic.
This book instantly reminded me of Aladdin because Day is from a very poor area of The Republic and steals from the rich to help out his family and community.
However, June soon finds out her safe world has not been what it appeared to be at all.I loved all the characters in Legend.
study to work like him till she hear the sad news..Her brother get killed in an assault.Start working for The Republic in her young age..not just cause her brother,But cause her intelligent made her a Prodigy ..Goes in a mission to hunt the boy she knows he killed her brother...and that what turns her life upside down..And between the two narrators ,Day and June , The story goes in the republic of America..It was the main reason why I got the trilogy the first place , the narrator is both male and female..
4 StarsI’m late to the Legend party, so I’ll keep this brief. I’m not rating this 4 stars cause it blew my mind (it didn’t) or because it was a brilliant fantasy book (it wasn’t). If anything, it could be deemed fantasy-lite, with two main characters who were basically the same person.However: I really appreciated the clean, crisp writing, the freedom from bogged down filler, the totally bitchin’ pace, and the fact that it took me less than two hours to put away, start to finish. So for that, dilly dilly.
THRILL RIDE. just posted a booktalk: review and discussion - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pvgIi...
In Los Angeles, Daniel "Day" Altan Wing, a rebellious 15-year-old deemed as the most-wanted criminal in the country for having escaped the 'labor camps' and done subversive actions, stages a failed attempt to steal a medicine from the Central Hospital for his younger brother, Eden Baatar, who is infected by a plague (released by the government to create biological weapons) that has caused their neighborhood's quarantine.
Metias' younger sister, June "Junebug", a 15-year-old prodigy and the only person to score perfectly in the Trial, seeks to find Day in revenge.
I low key knew that I would like this book from the beginning and it didn't disappoint.
In a world were the rich and the poor are devided by more than just money, Day is a boy who survives on the streets.
He is wanted by the government and he is their no1 criminal even tho he never killed anyone.
That is until one day he throws a knife at a soldier and that soldier turns up dead.Now his little sister June wants revenge.
She made it her mission to be the one to find Day and make him pay for his
It was easy flowing and I ended up halfway through the book without even realizing it.I loved the characters and it was one of the rare times in which I enjoyed both POV's without growning when they switched.However I had to take a star taken for it's lack of "Worldbuilding".We didn't got enough information on what happens in this world other than some mentions from our protagonists.• What is that test that every child is forced to take when they turn 10?• Why did they have to take this test?
What War?• Why does the government creat a virus to kill poor people over and over again?
❝Each day means a new twenty-four hours. Each day means everything's possible again. You live in the moment, you die in the moment, you take it all one day at a time.❞ Rating: ★★★★Being a fan of Marie Lu's The Rose Society, I didn't doubt my excitement for this one. Having a familiar taste in her writing, I knew I wouldn't be disappointed. And I wasn't! The only problem is, since this is Marie's first actual novel, I noticed changes made in her writing. But that's a good thing, meaning her writ
I mean, with all 3, I took my time reading them, being not only attached to them but actually being interested in finding out what would happen next.In Shiver I wanted to find out what would happen if Sam really did turn into a wolf again and what would happen to Grace and their relationship.In An Ember in the Ashes I wanted to find out how Laia would save her brother and how Elias would escape.In Legend I wanted to find out how June would find out the truth about her brother's death and discover everything hidden behind other secrets, and how Day would make and save up money for his little brother's illness.Our main character, June, is a prodigy who got a perfect score of her Trial, only ending up getting a better shot for wealth, education and success with whatever path her life is leading her to.
*4,5*Γιατί είναι δυστοπικό.Γιατί είναι ανθρώπινο.Γιατί με τράβηξε από την αρχή.Γιατί ήθελα συνέχεια να πηγαίνω παρακάτω.Γιατί μέχρι τη μέση δεν μπορούσα να το αφήσω κάτω.Γιατί ο Ντέυ είναι ένας από τους καλύτερους ΑΝΤΡΕΣ (15χρονους) που έχω διαβάσει.Γιατί έχω τον Μιτίας και τον Τζον μέσα στην καρδιά μου.Γιατί με έκανε να κλάψω.Γιατί και τώρα κλαίω.
I think I would've enjoyed this book  way way WAY  more if these characters weren't fucking 15 years old.
*suddenly remembers their 15 years old*Me: Wait...these little fetuses did this??
NOOOOOOOO *********Romance scene happens*Me: Ouuuuuu......WAIT THERE 15 YEARS OLD OMFG I FEEL LIKE A PEDOPHILE.
My sister is 15 like NOOOOOOO.
I hope the next book is set in the future like maybe 5 years later because NO .
I'm over exaggerating like don't get me wrong, this book was awesome.
I just wish the author made them 17 or 18 years old.
Would've been more believable, you feel???
Pardon me for raining on the dystopian parade but I'm 5 chapters in and- already the plot development and progression seem patently obvious. I thinkBecause I'm assuming the republic had Metias killed, pinned it on Day just so they could send June to track and kill Day. I'm also guessing the two will fall in love, fight the bad guys aka "The Republic", then become the symbolic heads of the resistance. Right?*passes book to 14-yr-old daughter*DNF @ 20%
I just find her writing style to be too dry and emotionless to be intriguing.
There’s plenty of action in her books, but her world-building doesn’t make all that much sense and it’s very hard to connect to characters because they are so flat and tell more than show.
Her books read like robots put them out—there’s just no life or warmth to her style.(view spoiler)[ (hide spoiler)]I gave this a chance, thinking that I just didn’t care for the world of the Young Elites, but no: the problem is her writing.
Also, what was up with switching fonts for the different character POVs?
Finishing Legend made me really wonder (not for the first time) what it was about Marie Lu's novels that seem to went completely over my head?
Could it be her characters?
I finished it yes.
It didn't offend me yes.
At the same time it also didn't give me anything strong to feel.Day was more interesting than June but that doesn't say much since June was quite bland to me.
The one character I thought had potential was Matthais (view spoiler)[ aaaannnddd he's dead oh well...
(hide spoiler)]Why were our two leads so much alike?
Wham, bam, thank you ma'am.
