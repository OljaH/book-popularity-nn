Horse is in the house!And he's badass! He's big! He's rough! He's a biker! He's a jerk most of the time! And he's best known for...  “Oh my god…”It was huge. I mean, huge. Not just long, but thick and hard and flushed bright red so it looked almost angry. It curved up, wider in the center of the shaft before narrowing under the ridge of his head....“Told you why they call me Horse,” he said. I dragged my eyes away to look at his face, reading satisfaction mixed with his desire.“They make condoms
Britney, I think my version is better!I loved this book so much, it was beyond awesome <3I laughed like crazy at almost everything Horse said, and swooned at the tiniest signs of affection from him <3 I just love the man so much, it isn't normal!!!!!
I mean, the man isn't called Horse for nothing!I know this will be a sh*tty review, but I just don't know what to write about the story or the characters unless it's something like: READ IT!!!!!!!!Loved it all, even Marie :D And Horse's POV!

Marie's brother Jeff is in some kind of a business with the Reapers.No one will tell her what it is.Meanwhile sparks have been flying between her and Horse.No matter how much she tells herself to stay away from him,she can't.How can she when he has the bad habit of giving her the most mind-blowing, spectacular orgasms???Their relationship is like a roller-coaster.Keeps going up and down.And then during a particular down time,Jeff steals from the Reapers.And then everything goes to hell.......Readers,though it won't be considered a spoiler if I tell you what happens next,but still,I want you to experience the blast for yourself."I don’t give a damn if you never wear panties again, but I know women are weird about that.
*****WOOT! I just saw that Reaper's Property is the 500th book that I have rated on GR!*****4 yummy stars. After leaving her abusive and cheating husband, Marie is living with her brother in a trailer. Jeff is working for the Reapers, a motorcycle club. Marie and Horse kind of hook up when Horse and his brothers are visiting Jeff to discuss business. Later on, Horse offers Marie an exclusive relationship with him; he wanted her to be his old lady, but she refused flat out and on top of that, she
Later on, Horse offers Marie an exclusive relationship with him; he wanted her to be his old lady, but she refused flat out and on top of that, she even insulted him and hurt his feelings.
When Marie found the Reapers holding a gun to her brother's head she did accept Horse's "offer" that if she would go with him they would give Jeff another chance to put things right.
Marie really annoyed me when she was jumping to conclusions instead of addressing her issues.Finally, the epilogue was a little bit too saccharine for my liking even though I loved Horse's (view spoiler)[proposal.
ROMANCE NOVEL FAIL.  Please note that I am not saying BOOK FAIL or STORY FAIL. I'm only taking issue with the romanticizing of things which should never be romanticized (in a contemporary) without some sort of heavy disclaimer or taboo label. I would have been easier on this book if it had been marketed as taboo and written from the point of view of challenging the reader's perceptions. But this is even labeled as romantica. So FAIL it is.Some spoilers ahead and a slight bit of swearing. I'm no
We're talking about a Motorcycle Club, right?As well, the next time I see anyone bitching about Twilight for being stalker-rific, i'm going to ask if they've read any of the recent "alpha biker" books to have come out.
The book starts off with Marie (one of the dumbest characters I've read to date) frothing at the mouth over a guy for reasons unknown.
Marie was FORCED into the situation (okay, so she went like a willing, whipped puppy dog...but only after being told that this was her fate, else her brother face the wrath of the Reapers).
Yes. A heroine named Marie who doesn't know her way in the biker world but somehow becomes a badass herself.
Yes.Did I get so caught up in the story and characters that when it ended I had to use my left hand to stop my right hand pointer from sliding the page on my kindle cause my brain didn't connect to said pointer that the book ended?
You bet your sweet butt I did!This book is not only about Marie and Horse.
The story flows perfectly that you do not want to leave the Reaper world.Loved the epilogue.
Hello, readers!!!!Let me introduce you all to Horse... Well, not this kind of horse!More like this kind of Horse...The kind that's handsome, like movie star handsome...The kind that has dark hair, broad shoulders and muscular arms filled with tattoos... the biker kind.And the reason they call him Horse? That's simple...because he's hung like one.   "Oh my god... It was huge. I mean, huge. Not just long, but thick and hard and flushed bright red so it looked almost angry. It curved up, wider in t
The story starts when Jeff, Marie's brother, who's working for the Reaper's Motorcycle Club, decides to steal from the club and to gamble away the money.
Soon the bikers find out about Jeff's stealing and, off course, they can't let him get away with doing something like that without paying for it...And so Marie comes in the picture...
What I would like to add, is that although the setting of the story reminded me a bit of the one in Undeniable, Reaper's Property was filled with much less drama and the "ugliness" in life.
I loved this book It starts out with Marie who had just left her abusive piece of crap husband she moves into her brother and mom's trailer (P.S. mom is in jail).
That is how Marie meets Horse in a so damn funny true trailer trash way.
He was funny and crude and it so worked for me.....“Nope, not Jesus, just a man,” Horse whispered.
So Marie's stupid loser stoner brother steals from the reapers and horse uses that to get Marie I don't wanna give away the whole story, but it was damn good.
ETA: 3/8 - Horse's POV short: http://totallybookedblog.com/2013/03/...Kudos to Joanna Wylde for coming up with a name like "Horse" for her bad@ss Alpha motorcycle male!
Granted, it made for some good drama but it did seemed a bit out of character.
Back to Horse...the one problem I had is that I never got why he wanted Marie so much and why he fell in love with her.
(which was fantastic!) I also loved that Horse was more than just a sex machine but that he had a good mind and was the accountant for the club.
(The dummy ledgers were perfect!!)And I loved all the drama.
Reading once more...there's a lot I forgotI don't think I'm destined to write a review for this one because...*big sigh*...the power just went off for 30 minutes (on the coldest night of the year)...but now that it's back on I guess I'll make an attempt to get my thoughts on paper.If I could sum up this story in one sentence I'd say something like... "Ohh, mama!" I was urged to read this one by my GR friends because of its similarity to Kristen Ashley's Motorcycle Man. And yes, there are some si
Both stories are told in first person from the heroine's POV, although Reaper's Property is also told in third person and we get to hear the hero's thoughts (which I appreciated).Our hero, "Horse" (as in "hung-like-a"...)
There were some dangling threads--(view spoiler)[what happened to Max when he tried to rape Marie; what happened to Marie's ex when Horse paid him a visit; what happened to Marie after she killed Max in self-defense--we know she gets off, but the story skips ahead to months later.
I dare you not to fall just a little in love with Horse and Marie...I know that I did!
2nd time Read & Review  Feb 17, 2013    IT'S OVER??? AGAIN?!?  Well what can I say about this book. It's awesome! It's crude, it's rude, it's rough and it's totally panty melting hot. Second time around I read this with my girls and it was just as good. I get it's it's a hardcore biker story and not for everyone. Meet Horse: A hot ass, rough, biker who want a clueless Marie. Getting introduced to biker life is a shock to Marie's system. She resists, she objects, she insults with her rejectio
Second time around I read this with my girls and it was just as good.
A hot ass, rough, biker who want a clueless Marie.
Getting introduced to biker life is a shock to Marie's system.
As she gets to know the true life of being a biker's old lady she realizes what a big mistake she made rejecting Horse, but thankfully there are always 2nd chances.
“I want you to be my old lady, babe.
It's quite an entertaining story as Marie navigates life in a clubhouse and having to deal with no filter Horse.
It’s an exciting, gritty, sexy story, one I enjoyed, start to finish.From the cover:Marie doesn’t need a complication like Horse.
Marie can save him by giving Horse what he wants—at home, in public, on his bike… If she’s a very, very good girl, she’ll get lots more of those orgasms only he can offer, and he’ll let her brother live.Maybe.I’ve seen a lot of rave reviews for this book, comparing it to Kristen Ashley’s writing, so being the KA Addict I am, I just had to see what all the hype was about.
I just want to share with you why this book wasn't my cup of tea and why I feel like I need to sleep for 3 days so my eyes can, somehow, forget this thing.And I'm sorry if this is your favorite book or you just love it.
And don't get me started with those sweet moments when he showed how much he cares about Marie because all I could think about was when a man who's hitting his woman gives her flowers or pats her damned head after the beating.
Reaper's proprety got the full package: Action, suspense, Alpha male/jerk, Motorcycle Club (It’s a disgusting world) ,love/hate relationship, Family,trust, anger issues.
somehow, Marie didn't like Horse (Yeah that's his street name, Cause he's hung like one Lol, his words not mine) at first but she sure as hell wanted him, It was funny to read about these two polar opposites characters and how they managed to come to terms with each other, then take their relationship to a whole new level( HEA: Marriage), this book was a total page turner, i enjoyed every second of it and here are my favorite quotes“Marie's drunk texts:Marie: Horse, muss yuMarie: Why dont anser?Marie: Horse like yur name.
I LOVE THIS FREAKING BOOK This book is impossible to write a review for so I'll just tell you what I felt when reading it.As soon as Horse opened his mouth I thought:As soon as Horse opened his mouth I:The things Horse would do to Marie made me feel: And think:And then I'd laugh some more-This book made me so happy!If you're wondering whether the book is worth the $7 bucks- I'll put it this way: I actually got this on loan but I'm pretty sure I'll end up buying it because I enjoyed it that much!
4 GALLOPING starsMeet Horse, the man from your worst nightmares that may be all your dreams come true...“So why are you called Horse?” “Cause I’m hung like one,” he replied, smirking.Attitude, arrogance, danger, sex appeal are oozing from this great specimen of man. Marcus Antonius Caesar McDonnell BikerAll man, warrior*insert pic of a sexy man in his underwear of your choice*Exciting and arousing this book drew me right in and never let me go. A glimpse in the life of a motorcycle club, in a da
A glimpse in the life of a motorcycle club, in a dangerous world with its own rules, living on the fringe of society.Brutal, occasionally offensive and totally in-your-face, the story surprisingly deals with many serious issues: death, ideals, family and abuse without losing focus of the main couple.
And now she is right in the middle of a Motorcycle Club, hot mess.
Sex, drugs and the proverbial rock 'n roll, is just the tip of the iceberg.And Marie and Horse are stuck in the middle of all these.
I really hope that there will be more stories of Reapers, Motorcycle Club!!
5 ‘HUGE’ Stars ;-) I loved this book! A big thanks to my many gr friends that raved about this one and got me to bump it way up on my tbr list! The very best part about this book... HORSE Horse was dangerous. I could smell it on him. Seriously. Under the delicious scent of leather, light sweat, and man was a pungent strain of pure trouble.  Even scary, the man made my panties wet.This story starts off with a lady named Marie. Marie has just moved in with her brother Jeff, after her lying, cheat
Even scary, the man made my panties wet.This story starts off with a lady named Marie.
Marie and Horse have chemistry.
Horse and Marie continue to hang out and start seeing each other more.
The Reapers will spare his life and give him time make things right, but Horse gets Marie.
Marie would do anything to save her brother, so she goes with Horse.
Horse wants to sleep with Marie, of course, but he also want to own her, to have her as his Old Lady, to be his property...
Marie and Horse had some heat between them!
Loved me some Horse!
Find all of my reviews at: http://52bookminimum.blogspot.com/2.5 StarsLook at me I’m becoming a real porno queen . . .  Whoops. They ain’t kiddin’ around when they say slippery when wet! When Casey recommended this book to me I requested it from the library immediately for one reason and one reason only . . .   “So why are you called Horse?”“‘Cause I’m hung like one.” BWAHAHAHAHAHA! Since I have the mentality of a 12 year old I just laughed and laughed forever at that. This one isn’t for the wea
Reaper’s Property wasn’t really my ideal cuppa for the simple fact that WHY THE EFF DIDN’T HORSE JUST TELL HER THE WHOLE INDENTURED SERVITUDE THING WAS A RUSE BECAUSE HE WANTED TO KEEP HER SAFE AND ALSO KINDA LURRRRRRVED HER AND MOST DEFINITELY WANTED TO MAKE ALL THE SEX WITH HER?!?!?!?!?!
However, if you can let your mind be free to the idea of some dumbshit sex robot type of woman who suffers the body betrayal B.S. anytime dude breathes near her, you’re probably in for a good time and will eventually be okay with the stupid ass plot too .
You make me feel crazy things, Marie, and I don’t want to lose you.”
Reaper’s Property, book 1 (stand-alone), Introducing Horse; tall, larger-than-life, movie-star handsome biker and everything that is sex with him.Horse’s and Marie’s story comes to pass when Marie’s brother, Jeff who had been hired by the Reaper’s MC club ends up stealing from the club.
I recommend reading after chapter 1 of Reaper’s Property.http://joannawylde.net/styled/styled-...Hero: Marcus Antonius Caesar McDonnell, “Horse”/30 years old/ex-marine - biker - Reaper’s MC member - accountant/black hair/green eyes/6’6”Heroine:  “Marie Caroline Jensen/25 years old/childcare worker/separated/dark brown hair/5’4”Story is mostly told from Marie’s POV, but every once in awhile we get Horse’s POV (in 3rd person).At first glance Horse has so many of the superficial qualities I like in a hero… sinfully good looks:
First of all I would like to apologize to anyone who stumbled upon my status updates during reading this book!Yes I know they were very spoliery (is that even a word?) but I just could not help myself!
As a story I would have rated it 4 stars, but as I had so much fun reading it I am seriously giving it a nice 5 stars!I don't even know what to say because pretty much you can read all my thoughts reading my upates so I will keep this short and I will focus only on one thing in this book: 
You would never know how would he respond to some things, either it shocked you or surprised you or just made you love him and want him more!
Four Stars** WARNING:  This review contains some graphic dirty talk, which if you know me, I fucking love that shit, but if you don’t, well…just proceed at your own risk** “This pussy,” he said, fingering me. I moaned in response, ashamed at how easily he made me wet. “This pussy is mine. You are mine. I’ll fuck you when and where I want, and you can either take it or get the fuck out. Are we clear?” Did that get your attention?? Because seriously, that line still gets to me. Holy Mother FUCK!!
This review contains some graphic dirty talk, which if you know me, I fucking love that shit, but if you don’t, well…just proceed at your own risk**
I ran across this book on Facebook, read the blurb and just couldn’t say no.
Not until you’re ready for me… But someday I’m going to own all of you, Marie.
Horse will do anything to have Marie.
When Jeff fucks up, this was his opening he needed to have Marie right where he wants her.
I’m keeping you and I don’t care if I go to hell for doing it.
I don’t care about anything but fucking you.” 
She discovers an entirely new world with Horse and his club and soon discovers a new side to herself...."So why are you called Horse?" "'Cause I'm hung like one." Yummm Horse was the ULTIMATE badass,sexy biker!He doesn't take any crap from anyone but he still has moments where he is sweet and gentle with his woman, Marie.
That's everything I've got and it's all yours if you'll take it." Marie wasn't bad either,she was a pretty strong woman,she was just very naive.Sometimes she was a little stupid for me but in the end I like her more!!I love the chemistry between Horse and Marie!!It was evident right from the start and it was sweet to see such a tough guy fall so hard.
WOW! WHAT. DID. I. JUST. READ? I started this book yesterday afternoon for a couple of hours, and then picked it up again last night... well needless to say at 2 am (when I finally finished the damn story.. because I couldn't put it down, and my eyes were crossing) I had a hard time falling asleep because the story kept running through my mind for the rest of the night/morning.The stories character's were so well written, I didn't know whether to hate Horse & Marie, smack them up side the he
It's a world of it's own, with it's own rules and laws.I can see where there would be a lot of mixed feelings about this story, because of Horse & Marie's relationship, but I think it's 'believable' because of the 'life' portrayed in the story when being a member of a Motorcycle Club, and what that means to the members and their women.This would definitely be classified as 'erotica' because the sex in this story was HAWT!
(Yep, we are talking about Horse!) Let me be honest with you - I would probably never look at this book twice if it weren't for all the status updates and reviews on Goodreads.
There's one thing you have to know - if you call someone "horse" (konj) on my native language, you better be ready for fight because it's like telling someone he's a dumb fuck or something similar.
(Now that I've read book, that kind of disturbs me.) Being good little girl, *winks*, I left everything aside and decided that it should be only appropriate to meet this big biker dude.
Sweet Butt! I loved this story, it was hot, gritty and definitely very exciting! Marie leaves her abusive ex-husband and seeks refuge with her brother Jeffery in her family’s trailer. Jeffery seems to be involved in some sort of “business” with the local motorcycle club the Reapers. During their many surprise visits, Marie meets Horse.Horse is...badass, alpha, rough, and all sorts of hot for Marie. He will do anything to get Marie on the back of his bike.  ”I want you to be my old lady, babe. Th

That’s all I have to offer.
That’s everything I’ve got and it’s all yours if you’ll take it.”
~HorseIn order to protect her brother, Marie finds herself thrown into Horse's world.
She develops strong feelings for Horse and members of the club.I found Marie to be easy to relate to.
I had two problems with this book; the heroine did a lot of slut-shaming, she spoke ill about women who had a lot of sex and showed bare skin, which I thought was despicable of her to do.
So, can't women fuck as many men as they want without this heroine judging them for it?And it wasn't JUST the heroine doing the slut-shaming.
Many women were looked down upon by a lot of other characters; "old ladies" and "men."And the other issue I had, was the time-jump.
Overall, I liked the two characters, the heroine annoyed me a bit, but not too much.
BUDDY READ WITH LINDSAY AND NIKKIJOANNA WYLDE DID AN AMAZING JOB OF THIS BOOK- I HOPE TO READ MORE ABOUT THE BIKERS IF THEY ARE ALL AS HOT AS THIS BOOK :)Bring on the Horse-[image error]I freakinthis bookWe all know why Horse got his name- Well most of us do for those who don't here is a helpful guide 'it was huge and I mean, huge.

Horse tore into me, fucking me so hard...his c@ck filled me exactly how I needed it...I don't know how many times I came"He slid further down the bed, taking my knees and pushing them up and over his shoulders and his mouth covered my clit.
Horse had the tongue of a devil sliding around my little nub...he worked me over until I twisted and moaned, hovering on the edge of climax.
That means against the wall, on the floor, in the middle of the f@cking grocery store, you give it to me when I want it or this deal is off"For all other Horse lovers- just want you to know
Reasons you should read this book. 1. His name is HORSE 2. It's erotica 3. He's a bad ass swearing demanding Alpha biker 4. She has some balls 5. His name is Horse, he's a demanding Alpha Male with shitload of stamina and wants the woman with balls. 'Nuff said
Reaper's Property was a great motorcycle-riding thrill ride of a romance.
Horse and Marie both make mistakes and it takes awhile for them to figure things out but it was a fun, very hot ride to them getting an HEA - she could be his old lady for life aka Property of Horse :)I loved how gritty and real this book was, I know nothing about real life motorcycle clubs but this book seemed fairly accurate from what I have read.
I hope we get more books featuring the Reapers!

She wasn't prepared for Horse and his sexual genius.
“I don’t want to hurt you.
Not until you’re ready for me… But someday I’m going to own all of you, Marie.
I got a little pissed off with story going back and forward between present and past tense.

This book is very nice hot read, love the storyline especially when it was written from Horse's POV!Everything is steamy here too!
The only thing that I felt was rushed was Horse and Marie's chemistry.
I would have love to see more of their attraction and banter before Horse can offering Marie the patch.
If you looking for hot read, this book is it!
