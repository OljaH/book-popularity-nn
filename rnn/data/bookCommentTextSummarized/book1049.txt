wow, Kierkegaard's actual writing was a lot more understandable and interesting to me than the "highly accessible" book written to introduce non-academic readers to his writings. This book certainly did what it set out to do, namely got me interested in his writings so now I'm going to attempt to read his full works as opposed to just selections.
Kierkegaard's writing style is unlike other philosophers' to whom I have been exposed. His scathing sarcasm and indictment of "Christendom" - he interrupts his own arguments with interjections of disgust - should cut any Christian who reads his work to the quick. The heresies he observed in his day (over 150 yrs ago) are still rampant today. Is the church representing Christendom or Heathendom? Kierkegaard argues a very good case that those who we call "Christians" are actually living lives of heathens, or worse. I will be re-reading "Preparation for a Christian Life" which was exceptionally penetrating in its insight.
i love you jesus christ
