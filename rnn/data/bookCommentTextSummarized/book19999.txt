Thirty-eight children are found murdered with markings like hers carved into their skin - and she knew all of them - until they suddenly stopped the same day she ran away from the fiefs, from Severn, from the horror of what she'd seen.Now, seven years later, her name has changed to Kaylin and she's a member of the Hawks, one of the three Lords of Law of the city of Elantra.
Since this is a 5-star book I figured I might as well write a 1-star review for it.
There's no way I can review this book!
It must come as a shock.♦ Flying people with wings.→ I know what you're thinking.
Don't worry though, I'm almost done here ← yep, I think this calls for another celebration.☛☛ One last thing before I go (see?
To those who have read this book: you might think my review doesn't do this fantastic book justice.

At least 3 times during the course of reading this, I checked to make sure that this was the first book in the series.
The first chapters are a total information overload without providing enough detail to really get to know the different races, social structure, or setting.
When it came to picturing the characters in my mind, it was a total blank to me.
Some kind of glossary/index would have been really useful when trying to figure out the definitions and identities of some of the characters.
I hope she improves on this in later books, but I won't be reading to find out.
Update:I just bought the audiobook and the narrator pronounces it differently.... my life is a river of disappointment----------------------------Like 75% of the reason I added this to my TBR is because the MC's name is Kaylin.
Elantra is a city like many others in fantasy, poised on that brink of industrialization, the throbbing heart of an empire riddled with corruption, magical or otherwise.
She has intense, personal relationships with high-ranking members, such as Sergeant Marcus Kassan, a Leontine (every bit as lion-like as the name implies) and the Hawklord himself, an Aerian.
At times she belabours the nature of Kaylin’s wardrobe, the arrangement of a courtyard or a tower … and then suddenly, the verbiage gives way to conversations about magic or history, and just as suddenly I have no idea where these people are or what they’re doing.It’s disheartening, because I would like to love this book.
A unique police procedural in which the cops are divided into three branches: Wolves, Hawks, Swords; and the people are divided into multiple races, including lion-like Leontines, flying Arielites, humans, and immortal Dragons and Barrantines. Someone is ritualistically killing children in this book, raising tattoo-like marks in their skin in pattern-like murders, but what are they trying to achieve, and can they be stopped?
I know that it didn't really work for a couple of my Goodreads friends whose opinion I trust, but for me, it was a fabulous start to a series.Sagara has an economical style to her writing, which worked very well with the way the story was layered.
World building and character histories are revealed through the current events of the story, which gave it a feeling of happening more in the moment.Based on this first book I am expecting this to be a very strong series overall, and I'm really looking forward to reading the rest of it!
A few chapters in I was surprised to find CAST IN SHADOW much more a mix of dark and high fantasy, peopled with a smattering of solid gold, humorous, and truly sinister characters living in a fully developed, layered, and fascinating world.Kaylin Neya is a Hawk.
Seven years ago Kaylin left a life of squalor on the streets of the fief of Nightshade, gave herself a new name, and made her way to Elantra in search of a fresh start.
Disturbing in their own right, they also bear an eerie resemblance to events in Kaylin's past she thought for sure she'd left behind.CAST IN SHADOW starts at a good clip and doesn't slow down once.
Every other character treats her with kindness and respect (OK, maybe not EVERYONE, but most) and she is frustratingly stupid back at them over and over again.The world also relies on nonhuman creatures, and expects you to just happily stay in ignorance (like the protagonist) of what their abilities are and what they look like.
The author barely gives you ANY tidbits about (what should be) FASCINATING races and again, expects you to fill in the blanks or not care.This book really "vaguebooks" the entire story through.
The author expects you to already know the characters, world and races, so she doesn't bother describing it.
I finished it in a day and a half and couldn't wait to start the next one.This book is more HF than UF.
True, if I think of it as HF, then it probably doesn't deserve 4 stars, so yeah, let's just leave it at this...HF, as in high fantasy, btw.The main difference between the two being that that UFs are based in the real world (as much as that can be).
I'm still waiting for Kaylin to grab a gun from somewhere and just shoot the bad guy at one point...Anyway, it had a wonderful world-builder, the politics were great and engaging  -yes, I actually said that politics were fun-  and the MC has a lot of potential.
Full disclosure: I only made it through 48% of this book.ETA: Anyone that wants to spoil me on all things Lord Nightshade, please do - I'm so incredibly curious about him, but I just can't force myself through anymore of the book in order to get such small moments/knowledge of him.ETA2: Or if there's a book that I should pick up later in the series where things start to become more smoothly written and I can skip the first-(several)-book(s)-syndrome....I've been looking forward to diving into this series for years, years, and when I finally did I am left with nothing but disappointment.
Incredible and complex world + strong but relatable main character = great series.
Add humour, lively banter and myriad of interesting support characters to spice up things and you get the first instalment of the Chronicle of Elantra.
They might criticise Kaylin all the time but you can feel the affection they have for her.
They felt like paternal figures most of the time even when they were trying to be stern and distant.
But most importantly all of those characters supported her and believed in her.
I just can't wait to get back on the streets of Elantra and learn more about this fascinating new world!
I'm percolating my thoughts. RTC.
I don't, however, feel it's so much the case of good idea gone bad so much as it was really horrible writing.
I know what I'm going to write here will be lost on those who haven't read the book because, taken out of context, it really doesn't seem all that bad.
It was just too much and she did nothing to blunt the blow.You know how some fantasy authors will take the hand of the reader and gently cox them into the warm waters of a story via the kiddie side, remaining beside you for that little bit it takes to learn how to float or to stand on your feet?Yeah.
Also, the author attempts to create a mystery (as if there wasn't enough) by withholding from the reader information that the view point character knows.
Kaylin knows what happened in her childhood that makes her attack Severn several times during the book, but the author deliberately keeps what happened very vague, even when Kaylin is directly thinking about it.
It remains a mystery until the middle of the book, but hiding it doesn't add anything and only makes Kaylin's motives more confusing.
Whenever an author hides something about the main character like this, it has the side-affect of keeping the reader at a remove from her.
I still don’t know how long the series is going to be, but I figured there are enough books out that I could get started and see if the wait has been worth it, and oh yes it has.
A lot of things are a mystery, some because they aren’t revealed all at once, and some because the world-building is difficult to understand at times.
By the end of the book, I felt like I pretty solidly knew what was going on, how the world was set up, who was in it, what the magic was - mostly.
Elantra is a city peopled by various different fantasy races as well as humans, including mortals and immortals.
And there's also a lot of deep history, as you'd expect when at least two of the major players here are essentially immortal, and there's hints of even older races, now gone.Kaylin herself has a lot going on as well, with her past in Nightshade, magic that she harnesses for healing and destruction and her role as a Hawk in an organization that she has essentially grown up in.
I've read all of the novels in this series and reccomend them to anyone.Michelle Sagara takes you to another world full of magic and darkness.
There are two types of people that live here: immortals and mortals.
Mortals are races such as Arians (Winged people.
The author describes these races very well throughout the novel, and although I've tried, I can't do them justice.What really makes the books, though, is the main character Kaylin Neya; a former street urchin from the wrong side of the tracks (in reality a bridge) that tries to make something of herself working in the law system.
I just don't understand this book.
The story starts and is written as if this is book two, like I was already knowledgeable on what's going on.
The author is jumpy, talking about one thing then going to another within one sentence.
And the scenes happen too fast I don't even know what happened.
The main character just does things.
Names and titles are given, I don't know them and don't get a disruption.
Characters are of different mammal types that I don't understand.
A good story with good writing written horribly in a sense that a book before this would have been better.
Some things like Kaylin’s bad grades were mentioned repeatedly.
I’d like to know more about him, but it’s not enough to make me want to read the rest of this series.
Hawks were explained in the general sense but the specifics were lacking.
Wolves were briefly touched on but swords were only mentioned.
After reading the whole book I still don’t get what distinguishes one species from the next.
I did things I don’t like such as cleaning or watching baseball games because it was vastly better than continuing to read this book.
It’s just one more thing to make this book unbearable.
There is something distinctly fannish in nature about the words on the page, something that says "I learned how to write solely through my friends on the Internet," and while that's not wrong (I learned a fair bit that way myself), that needs tempering with a healthy dose of "This is how we do it for pay."The first star is because I didn't throw it across the room.
The second star is because I like it enough to see what the second book holds, if my library has it (no way I'm paying a hold fee).
The heroine would say "I don't understand", and the others would just look at each other and shake their heads at her inability to figure it out.
I've rarely read a book in which so many nouns, adjectives, and verbs have come together without actually completing a sensical thought.
In truth, having read the entire book, I still don't completely understand what happened.
I only have a vague understanding of it, much, I think, like the heroine.
I have no idea what the heck happened in this book.
Till the end I don't know how old the MC was, I have a general idea but I'm not sure I'm right.
She acted like a teenager half the time and yet I think shes suppose to be in her 20's.
The whole power thing I did not understand, it felt like there was a book missing, at least a book to explain all the half information we had been given and make it make sense.
I will be reading the next book , hopefully that sheds some light on everything.
4/5; 4 stars; A-So, this series has been on my TBR for quite a while.
I like a story with a strong yet flawed heroine.
I like dragons, magics, and mysterious powerful races of beings.
This book has all that.
The main character in this book is only 20 years old though so a lot of the characters annoying shortcomings can easily be overlooked in light of the fact that she is practically a kid!
There are quite a few books in this series so I look forward to seeing the character grow and mature.
I tried.
I really did try to enjoy this book.
But I finally gave up.
I was 85% through this book, and still waiting for it to grab me.
I hate abandoning books, but I figured if i wasn't sold on this book at 85%, then there was very little chance I would be sold on it at 100%.
I just couldn't get into this author's style.
The writing was appallingly choppy.
There was no flow to the sentences.
And her train of thought must have run on tracks perpendicular to my own, because I had such trouble following the reasoning of the main character.
I just couldn't connect.
Counts towards the Cliterary Genius 2017 June part of the challenge: read a book suggested by another member of CG.
Kaylin is a Hawk - one of the arms of the law in her world.
She has an unusual ability for healing and also unusual tattoos on her arms which suddenly appeared on her when she was a child.
Because Kaylin believes in justice and enforcing the law, she must get involved in solving these murders and dredge up her past.
Probably one of the most interesting things is the different races and cultures in Kaylin's world and how they all interact with one another.
Not a bad first book but it was slow moving and tedious at times with too much 'filler' action. I'm on the fence about continuing the series.
Her most recent case involves a series of child murders in the fief of Nightshade that seem directly connected to the mystical tattoos that have been growing on her arms and legs since she was young.
Either way, this young-acting person's presence on a detective force is hard to explain.The setting of Elantra is interesting so far, with its several mortal and immortal races, and its good and bad sides of the tracks (or river, in this case), its modern conveniences and lack of machinery and guns.
We're given broad hints of the world's ancient history, and Kaylin's connection to it, which sets things up nicely for future books.
I wanted to love this book, and there is so much about it that is interesting, but I feel so underwhelmed after finishing it.
Other characters continuously call her little, child, clumsy, and assume she isn't capable of understanding anything.
I must be incapable of understanding as well because I finished the novel and I'm still lost.
There isn't much detective work going on, and everyone seems to already know who is behind it.
It's like they are putting the main character through the motions just so they can laugh at her when she comes out more confused at the end.
