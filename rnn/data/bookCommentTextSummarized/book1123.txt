Suppressed for good reasonNot a huge fan of Tennyson, so it's clear to me why these verses were suppressed. Page after page of tortuous rhymes and quasi-classical bloviation.
As a collection, they merely lack categorization, rather than being less than superlative poetry.As a side thought, these put me in mind that it might be possible to suggest that budding effervescents experimenting with words and paper might be required to actually read one or two of these poems before ever engaging in writing anything approaching poetry.
I think we've all read Paula's poetry somewhere along the line.
I can't help but think that maybe by reading Tennyson first, she would have understood what great poetry was all about and never written that crap.
There's not much more to say than has already been said about these poems. They were written at the height of Tennyson's career, but were either not published on the same scale as his other works or were thought to not be his best. My personal opinion is that they are well thought out and introspective. I enjoyed them greatly.
Great collection of poems by a classic poet. Love his stories!
