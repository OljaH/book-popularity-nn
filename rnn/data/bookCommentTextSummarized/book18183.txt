Once again, Colleen Hoover has delivered an emotionally charged masterpiece that will capture your heart! Maybe Someday is not your typical romance but I promise you, it is one of the most deeply passionate and uniquely beautiful books I have ever read.Pure perfection! 5++ stars!!   “I never realized how powerful desire could be. It consumes every part of you, enhancing your senses by a million. When you’re in the moment… all you can do is focus on the person in front of you.”  Maybe Someday wa
From the first few lines, I was fully immersed in this story and stayed connected until the very last word.Ridge was the kind of guy who everyone will fall in love with - a gorgeous, sweet, talented musician with a heart of gold and who was also hiding a big secret.
The strong emotional undercurrent that ran throughout the entire book was so intense that you could just  feel it in every single scene.There were moments that made my laugh so hard that I had to stop reading until I could recover and moments that broke my heart so completely that I just sat there with tears streaming down my face.The way Ridge and Sydney connected through their music was hypnotic, beautiful and downright hot.
If I hate love triangles that much then why in the world did I read this book?
But with this book, I just had to know how the author would resolve the love triangle from hell.This rant will just consist of the things I hated in this book.
Because at the end when Ridge came to Sydney's apartment and was kissing her all I could think of was him kissing Maggie and professing his love to her and begging her to take him back.
I've read love triangles before and ended up not hating them with a passion, because in those the character who has the choice between two others chooses one.
So shots all around, for another CoHo favorite!(The power of pine-sol, baby.)What I love most about Colleen Hoover books, in conjunction with her beautifully mapped out stories, is the fact that none of them are the same.
Sounds like the groundwork for a typical new adult love story, right?
The story is delivered through alternating dual perspectives, so we really get a solid feel for the journey of both characters.
Although this review has been intentionally vague, I can almost guarantee that you'll fall hard for this incredible cast of characters, and that this book will stay with you long after reading.
I'm going to work my way through some of the popular New Adult books and see if I can weed out the crap and hopefully find some surprising gems.
I'm starting to think that, if this pattern persists, Hoover might actually write a book I love in about five years time.
There's a reason I managed to read every single page of this with ease and it's the same reason I made it through Hopeless - the author writes in an addictive, engaging style.
Apart from what I mentioned above about the author's addictive easy-to-read style, I also liked the guy in this a lot more than in Hoover's previous works.
5 Someday stars!!!  Maybe not right now. Maybe not tomorrow. But maybe someday. Colleen Hoover is one of those authors that never disappoints. I don’t think she has it in her to write anything other than perfection. I loved every chapter, every page, every word of Maybe Someday. Sydney and Ridge’s story was so different, so original, and due to the nature of the story, it’s going to be hard to review. I’m going to hide all my spoilers, and I would highly recommend NOT reading any of them unless
Sydney and Ridge’s story was so different, so original, and due to the nature of the story, it’s going to be hard to review.
They are determined to keep it platonic, let it just be about the music but it’s not easy to fight this powerful attraction.
It’s not so easy when you’re trying to win a war against the heart.‘It shouldn’t be possible for the heart to love more than one person at once.’And Sydney’s part in all this...‘Hey, heart.
You and I are officially at war.’ I loved how Sydney or Ridge never wanted to sneak around and be the cheaters.
It almost felt like Ridge being apart of a music group was not even the reality since not much actually proved it, except for him playing guitar, writing songs and sharing some related info with his brother who was in of the group as well..Ridge is a good guy, really.
Also, I didn’t appreciate how the author made us love Maggie (Ridge’s girlfriend) and make us see how they both care for each other, especially Ridge, when we all know that having Sydney coming into his life (after her boyfriend cheated on her and needed a place to stay) was not going to do good in that relationship.I can’t deny that Sydney and Ridge have a beautiful chemistry because they do have one.

First off December has been the month for good reads. Everything has been so good! Second I've been on a total Colleen Hoover kick. Third I think going into a book completely blank and with the smallest amount of information about the novel is the way to go. I picked up Maybe Someday only knowing that it was a story about a girl
I picked up Maybe Someday only knowing that it was a story about a girl who falls in love with her musician neighbors and I assumed they hit it off.
It’s going to be so hard to review this book due to the fact that something right away was such a surprise.
Colleen Hoover is the Queen Bee of building up stories, sprinkling it with little surprises, then when she thinks you're not looking she reaches into your chest cavity and pulls out your heart.
I didn't think Hoover could surprise me any further than she did with Ugly Love, she managed to do so much more than that.
Really enjoyed this one, as I do with every Hoover book. Here's my full review/booktalk: http://youtu.be/2ZlpemVqyuk
Felt like I was in a bad episode of Beverly Hills, 90210 This is basically how things went down.
Heroine's POV :Ridge is so cute.
But he has a girlfiend.
I really wish he could be my life partner.
My soulmate.

This is basically how things went down.
Heroine's POV :Ridge is so cute.
But he has a girlfiend.
My soulmate.
He has a girlfriend.
I am so attracted to Ridge.
Ugh no, he has a girlfriend.
Hero's POV : Sydney is so incredible.
Sydney and I...
we are musical soulmates.
Sydney makes me feel things I've never felt before.
I have a girlfriend and I love her.
I have a girlfriend and I love her.
I have a girlfriend and I love her.
I loved Finding Cinderella.
Me when finding out about Colleen Hoover's new book:    This is now me waiting for the book to come out:
shot through the heart and this book is to blame.
it gives love a real name.a real, painfully heart-wrenching, delicately raw, tenderly hopeful name.
this is my fifth CoHo book and she is 5/5 on making me ugly cry.
romance books can feel a little formulaic to me, but i never know what im going to get each time i open a new CoHo book.
my heart was eager to back them up and support their actions because i understood everything little thing they did and felt and wanted and hated and needed.
by the end, my heart was just as deeply in love as they were.
First reading was 2014Second time was 2018#UltimateReadingChallenge For the January re-read challenge I decided to listen to Maybe Someday.
The beauty of MAYBE SOMEDAY is it's a book you feel.
I've heard rumors about a love triangle with this book.
If you want to know if the rumors are true or not click the first spoiler.
(view spoiler)[ Yes, there is a love triangle but remember this is CoHo and she isn't going to do us wrong.
I liked all the characters.Whenever you hear there is a love triangle the next question is- is there CHEATING?
(hide spoiler)]An epilogue is offered on CoHo's website.
This love triangle is different from others I have read because there isn’t a villain or an unworthy person in the equation. All three characters’ feelings are equal and relevant and although we are only privied to two povs throughout the story, the third person’s side is felt throughout. ”It’s not so easy when you’re trying to win a war against the heart.” Ridge is a work at home computer guy who song writes for his brother’s band Sounds of Cedar. He is in a five year relationship with Maggie,
When the betrayal of her best friend and boyfriend is revealed Ridge opens his apartment to her and two begin working on lyrics to Ridge’s music and they experience insane amounts of chemistry and both fight those feelings.
Maggie visits regularly, Sydney and Ridge struggle with their building connection and feelings for one another (they create the most beautiful songs together), Warren and Bridgette get it on and then all of sudden BAM things get crazy.
Ridge truly was in a battle with his heart.This is a story to be experienced and discussed with friends.
How can two people who both have such good intentions end up with feelings, derived from all the goodness, that are so incredibly bad? I thought is book was really sweet. I mean there were a lot of things that got on my nerves but it all worked out in the end. ****SOME SPOILERS****Sydney meets Ridge by listening to him play his guitar on his balcony every day. She sits on hers and he sits on his across the way. Ridge has been having trouble writing his lyrics for the band and he sees Sydney sin
Ridge has been having trouble writing his lyrics for the band and he sees Sydney singing to his music and thus it begins.
On Sydney's birthday she finds out from Ridge that her boyfriend of two years, Hunter, has been having a relationship with her roommate, Tori.
Syd finds out Ridge is deaf but he can still play guitar and writes music for the band his brother formed.
Syd writes the lyrics and Ridge plays, at least until he gets his muse back, which is through Sydney.
I loved being able to read a nice fluffy book.
REVIEW:There is no doubt that Colleen Hoover can write any amazing novel.
The development and interaction between Sydney and Ridge was pure magic.
Their method of communicating with each other felt like a language meant only for Sydney and Ridge and I felt like a fly on the wall playing witness to their romance.
I usually cringe when I read lyrics in books because they come off so cheesy and unrealistic but not with Maybe Someday.
This book is a must read!
4.5 STARS*I received an ARC from NetGalley in exchange for an honest review**Based off previous Colleen Hoover novels I will:1.
“Sometimes in life, we need a few bad days in order to keep the good ones in perspective.” This is my third book by Ms Hoover.
I loved Hopeless.
Was not too keen on Slammed.
Yeah, saw all the rave reviews for this one and thought to myself will I?
Still had a bit on the Amazon gift voucher….
Cos it’s not cheap for an e-book.
You UK buyers are getting it for a bargain at your price.
I buy on .com so it was a bit more.
Are you listening?You and I are officially at war.” I saw the rev
Still had a bit on the Amazon gift voucher….
I buy on .com so it was a bit more.
I saw the reviews but I did not read them and I am so glad I didn’t as this book was a complete surprise for me.
And a pleasant one.So I don’t want to say too much about the book for fear of giving anything away.
But it did not read like an NA book.
It was just a good book.
Like Colleen, I love music so this book had the added bonus of having music throughout it.
“I don't want to care.

3.5 - They can't all be a winner - starsI'm sad I didn't love it but oh well.....Ok now don't get me wrong this book was written great and I still love me some CoHo, but this was not by any means my favorite CoHo book.....Maybe its my fault for not reading the blurb bc I didn't care since it was a new CoHo book but I actually considered DNF because I saw where this book was headed and its one of my pet peeves.
They only get to choose who they stay in love with." 
Also, (view spoiler)[ I feel like he was with Sydney by default.
Like if everything wouldn't have gone down with Maggie he would have stayed with her.
The only thing we can control is whether we give our lives and our minds the chance to catch up to our hearts.Ridge has been having a block when it came to writing lyrics so he collaborates with Sydney, who is utterly passionate about songs and music.
They only get to choose who they stay in love with.Not only was this book heart wrenching, it was also fascinating, what with the aspect of music and lyrics bringing Sydney and Ridge together.
Not a bad thing, but the way it was introduced into the story i.e. the book structure (present, then flashback) cut my reading flow a little.
(hide spoiler)]****END OF SPOILER****Sydney has this special connection with Ridge that goes beyond their mutual love of music.
****DETAILS IF YOU NEED MORE****(view spoiler)[There’s no way to fluff it so I’m just going to say it: there is a love triangle so this story is essentially a forbidden romance.
I’m not saying I hated the way Ridge “chose” one of the two girls, but it ruined the uniqueness of the love triangle aspect and no matter how well-written it was, I was left feeling underwhelmed.
It goes fast, it doesn't bore and it ends like it has to end.The next book in this series is of Warren and I coudn't be happier.✨✨✨Con este libro se dan dos cosas totalmente nuevas para mí: un triángulo amoroso con dos mujeres y un hombre y un protagonista que es sordo.Lo más extraño de Ridge es que toca la guitarra y compone canciones, música y letra.
I inhale read this in one sitting. I highly recommend listening to the soundtrack along with the book. This is for fans of the slow-burn, angst-filled romance. This book deals with a delicate situation in a realistic and complex way. I adored it.
dnfmaybe someday i'll find a fuck to give about this book and finish it. so fucking boring goodbye@book you weren't good enough. now in the trash you can* go
4 Beautiful Stars. Sydney finds out that her boyfriend of two years is a cheater so she accepts help from her neighbor, Ridge. Ridge and Sydney connect trough music and soon very strong feelings starts to develop between them. But life always gets in the way and things aren’t always easy: there will be major obstacles, hearts they don’t want to break… and heartbreaking beautiful songs. Let me just start by saying that I love Colleen Hoover. She is an amazing writer and there isn’t one book of he
Ridge and Sydney connect trough music and soon very strong feelings starts to develop between them.
Let me just start by saying that I love Colleen Hoover.
(view spoiler)[The effing love triangle!
(hide spoiler)] I’m sorry, even when I love all the people involved and want everything to go for the best, which is the case, I can’t deal with those.
Character Development:  Sydney is pretty good and I love how respectful she is to the other parts in all this messed up situation.
Ridge is an amazing guy and I loved his position through the entire book.
2 STARSPeople don’t get to choose who they fall in love with. They only get to choose who they stay in love with. Well if there’s one good thing I can say about Colleen Hoover at this point in my reading canon, there is something about the way she writes that allows me to finish her book in a day. There’s an ease in the way she tells a story, a manner that keeps my attention even when I don’t like what is going on. I can’t seem to look away, even when half the time I’m alternating between wanti
Of course he is, he’s a musician.Me: I don’t know what kind of question that is, but if this is your attempt at flirting, I’ve got a boyfriend.
Please, don’t let it be Ridge.✔︎ I’ve never felt about anyone or anything the way I feel about him.✔︎ Oh, my God he looks incredible.
It’s the first time I’ve ever seen him on a stage.✔︎ I love the fact that Hunter is about to turn around and witness Ridge looking like this.
Well I guess I'm the odd duck here because I didn't like this. The only reason I'm rating it 2 stars and not 1 is because I did like how it ended, mostly. I completely lost respect for Ridge with his treatment of both women. Mostly Sydney, though.
2.5 starsI'm slowly beginning to think that Colleen Hoover just isn't for me.
I hate that cheating is such a common trope used in New Adult, and although it may be realistic, it's OBNOXIOUS.
If you cheat on your girlfriend, tell her and deal with the consequences and stop crying literally every 3 pages for half of this book.
This book had no other plot other than a sob story about cheating and regret.
I just hate how Colleen Hoover tackles these serious problems and over-dramatizes them.

Find all of my reviews at: http://52bookminimum.blogspot.com/A 4.38 average on Goodreads, you say? Yeah, that sounds about par for the course on books I rate 1 Star. Now, before everyone goes all cuckoo crazy I need to ask a favor . . . .  Don’t tar and feather me just yet. I’m actually one of you and have fangirled over CoHo in the past (see EXHIBIT A). In fact, the only story I didn’t like was Never Never and that was more because it was a serial (which I hate) and it didn’t have enough storyl
Soon Ridge discovers Sydney has a flair for writing song lyrics – something he has always done until a severe case of writer’s block kicked in.
I thought maybe it was just a case of needing the music rather than just reading the words so I took a couple of minutes to You Tube the songs themselves and hear what they sounded like.
Bottom line is I hated this story (I know I was pretty vague up there so you might have had a hard time reading between the lines), but I’m still a fan of CoHo. Not every book works for every reader.
So beautiful and amazing. I was a little unsure through the middle but I honestly adored it. Wow.
+5 AMAZING STARS  "It's you" "My heart..wants you."OMG I don't know what to say except that this book was amazing!!I loved it so much,I honestly couldn't stop reading it!I cried,I laughed,my heart was broken and then in the end I was happy!There are so many emotions!This book make me feel like I'm a part of this book!!This is one of the best book I've ever read!!
The way it loves is beautiful.
I close my eyes...and I cry." The characters were so well developed, they were so real!!I feel like they really exist!I loved Sydney and Ridge.
