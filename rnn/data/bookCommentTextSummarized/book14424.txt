The third sort—the best—unites the myth-making process to a setting precisely realized, a setting into which the monstrous erupts as a force both demonic and godly, a force which leaves in its wake not only pain and destruction but awe and an uneasy reverence too.There are five stories in this collection.
“Rawhead Rex” is about an ancient deity/monster long ago confined, a being dug up from under a sacred stone in a small English Village, who then proceeds to go on a rampage of child-devouring and fiery destruction.
“Rawhead Rex” is simply one of the best, most exciting horror stories I have read, and I advise you not to miss it.
If you're reading this after the week ending on August 21, 2016, you can skip to the next paragraph.
"Son of Celluloid" is one of my favorite short stories of all time.
I know no one disagrees with me more than Clive Barker himself, but different strokes and all that.
This story is Barker attempting to make a ghost in a sheet frightening again.
I read that version once upon a when, and I remember clearly that I hated the order of the stories.
I would have loved to have seen the order of volumes two and three reversed.
His revenge quest is cut short by his untimely death but that minor detail doesn't curtail his activities with ghosts and shrouds prominent.Scape-Goats get stranded on the beach of a deserted Island where converging undersea currents accumulate masses of dead bodies on the sea bed.
These dead bodies become fairly mobile when it comes to preventing their escape.Finally Human Remains sees a young gay prostitute hired by an archaeologist for some action, get a little bit more than he bargained for when he stumbles upon a statute in the man's bathroom.
Still flawless. I liked this one more than the second volume, and it turns out I had already read "Human Remains" in another story collection (Fangs: The Vampire Archives, Volume 2. I hadn't even added it to my bookshelves). My favourite story was probably "Rawhead Rex" (because D A M N), and my least favourite "Confessions of a (Pornographer's) Shroud". "Scape-Goats"'s ending was REALLY good, too; I felt it needed a special mention.
Определено най-добрата част до тук!
3.5All stories in this volume have one thing in common - they are all about ordinary people who found themselves in some strange and sometimes terrifying, occasionally disgusting, situations.
There are lessons to be learned from the old stories.
This is a story of revenge.
All four who appear in this story are colourless.
Still, the idea of an uncharted island in the middle of nowhere with weird atmosphere is really good.Human Remains is about obsession mostly.
The main character is a prostitute who is obsessed with his looks and youth.
Then, someone else (or rather something else) becomes obsessed with it too.
While not as startlingly original as the first volume, the five tales of Barker's third Books of Blood are a welcome improvement over the uneven and underwhelming fair found in the previous collection.
Barker is at his most campy with a hallucinatory story of a cineplex haunted by a shape-shifting predator, using the familiar beats of the drive-in creature feature to send-up silver screen icons John Wayne and Marilyn Monroe.
The final story of a rent boy with a primeval doppelganger is arguably the most accomplished of the quintet, showcasing Barker giving it his all to be poetically existential.
Of the first three volumes, I thought this was the strongest.
Back in 1984, Clive Barker made his name within the deeply competitive world of horror with the publication of the first three volumes of the macabre short stories 'The Books Of Blood'.
The story was later adapted by Steve Niles in 1991 into the Eclipse Books graphic novel 'Son Of Celluloid' where it was illustrated by Les Edwards.
The story was later adapted by Steve Niles in 1993 into the Eclipse Books graphic novel 'Rawhead Rex' where it was illustrated by Lionel Talaro.
The story was later adapted in 1989 into the graphic novel 'Tapping The Vein - Book 1' where it was illustrated by P.
Тук имаме вече един натурален, груб, мръсен Баркър, разказващ кървавите си истории, без алюзии и препратки.
Може би само последното произведение се разграничава от цялостната структора на сборника, но следва основната му идея.Рожба на киното – Един болен и прострелян затворник се стаява да умре в тавана на едно стаео кино, събрало в себе си емоциите на хилядите преминали по седалките му зрители - нещо много гнусно ще оживее от тази комбинация.Негово величество Ролхед – Трябва да изгледам филма.
Дали ще има против или е забравил вече какво е да си жив?Безмилостна, кървава и много, много добра подборка, идеална добавка към октомврийското ми четене.
A special book with a lot of history and personal significance for me. It shattered my book world and I never forgot it. I still refer to many of these stories in conversation.
The breakdown of the stories for me go like this:Son Of Celluloid: Very cool story and started the book off nice.
I love monsters and this one has a doozy of one, but this story really should have been longer for me to care more about it and it's characters.
Wish this one was longer too but I'll round it up to 5 stars.Human Remains: This was ok.
All in all, this book for me falls between that 3 and 4 star mark and the disappointment factor forced me to round down.
I really like this installement of the books of blood. I think The best so far. The last story Human remains I think got to me the most...Theres something about clives writing...it can be really bloody and gory and sick at times but at the same theres so much more to look for between the lines....Really good collection and iam looking forward to reading the next ones. 4 stars:)
Невероятна книга, която те кара да забравиш за цигари, храна и тоалетна, докато не я прочетеш от корица до корица. Най-добрата от трите досега. Тук просто няма слаб разказ/новела.
This book had five stories, all of which took me to a completely different world.
Barker provides a setting of the crawlspace behind a theater screen.
Confessions of a (Pornographer’s) Shroud was creepy, strange and funny.
So, I hope Barker intended this story to be funny, otherwise I have a good sense of humor, but no sense of decency.
Barker has that ability to pull the reader right into his stories and believe in whatever he is writing about.
I read to be transported into another world for a little while, and he provides the vehicle.
I am loving this series of short stories.
This wasn't quite as good as the other volumes of the Books of Blood that I've read but it was still great nonetheless. It's a varied and enjoyable collection of short stories that still hold up 30 years after publication.
Rawhead Rex plays out a lot like The Skins of the Fathers.
I also quite enjoyed the scene where Rawhead Rex sees and hears a car and believes it to be some sort of mechanical monster that the humans have tamed.
But, like many of Clive Barker’s stories, it seems, there are always unnecessary details about private parts and excrement.
Like I complained in Books of Blood 2, there seems to be further misogyny in this story with a rather pointless scene involving Maguire’s wife.
This reminded me a lot of the final story in Book 2, New Murders in Rue Morgue.
A few good stories in this volume, though I enjoyed Volumes 1 and 2 far more. The last story will stay with me, a very unique tale.Son of Celluloid An escaped convict dies behind a movie screen. After his death, his cancerous tumor gains sentience, over the years, from the strong emotions of the cinema's audiences and torments the few people that remain after a show. The sole survivor of the massacre is seen some time later, having tracked down the murderous entity which was roaming the country
The sole survivor of the massacre is seen some time later, having tracked down the murderous entity which was roaming the country after possessing the body of a young girl unaccounted for after the events.
The story was later turned into the movie Rawhead Rex (1986), which Barker has disowned.
In a gory finale, he enters the mouth of the man responsible for his ordeal and turns him inside out, literally.Despite containing graphic descriptions of acts of extreme violence, the story is written as a black comedy, revolving around the visual gag of a real ghost looking like someone wearing a bedsheet over his or her head.
I have now read the "Books of Blood 1-3" and although I enjoyed a few of the stories in #1, I felt that #2 was lacking and struggled to finish it.
1 - Son of Celluloid - I wasn't a huge fan of this one, a murderer's cancer comes to life after his death in the back of a movie theater and takes on the persona of the films that cross the screen.
This was another story that could have been made into a novella, I enjoyed it, but would have liked more background, more meat, more story.
“It was a filthy thing, a tumour grown fat on wasted passion.”“Confession of a (Pornographer's) Shroud” provides an interesting balance in the splatter.
Our revenant protagonist inhabits the classic death shroud, and Barker delivers on some clear menace in the sheeted ghost.
On the other cup of the scale, I was not expecting a ghost to reach down someone’s throat, grab their colon, and pull it out their mouth.
“Rawhead Rex” pulls some interesting inspiration from M.R. James and then proceeds to unsubtly rack up a body count.
I hate myself for achieving adulthood before reading Clive Barker's works. I have yet to be even slightly disappointed. These short stories were terrific and disturbing. Barker has a way of describing carnage and gore in a quiet serene way that makes it all seem almost dreamlike. He's also quite brilliant with his shorts. These tales would suffer under the weight of fluff and extraneous detail. They're just right.

Books of Blood, Volume 3 by Clive Barker
Clive Barker is such an author, and the Books of Blood marked his debut - his coming out to the world - in brilliant, unforgettable fashion.
Crossroad Press is proud to present Clive Barker's "Books of Blood" in digital for the first time.
The Books of Blood combine the ordinary with the extraordinary while radiating the eroticism that has become Barker's signature.
The Books of Blood confirm what horror fans everywhere have known for a long time: We will be hearing from Clive Barker for many years to come.
This was the volume that had convinced me about giving up Barker permanently. I had come to his works on the basis of impressions gained from an exquisite story dealing with cold war noir and werewolves. Instead, in volume after volume of Books of Blood, I had found stories that sought disgust and NOT horror. In a sense, it was an eye-opener, but with Barker that probably means removal of one's eyelids and exposing the eye to the most gruesome treatment conceivable.'Nuff said.
Five tales of uniquely crafted horror from the master Clive Barker. While they were all good, I think I'd have to say Son of Celluloid was my favorite, involving a distbrung evil that creeps its way into an old movie theater. Rawhead Rex is a close second, though, wherein an ancient nightmare creature reclaims the township it had previously ruled. If you dig Barker's stuff, or just like horror that doesn't shy away from getting real disturbing, give it a shot.
Not quite as good as the first volume but better than the second, the first three stories in this entry (Son of Celluloid, Rawhead Rex, and Confessions of a Pornographer's Shroud) were pretty great - grander in dread and thrust. Disappointingly, the two final stories were more aimless and dispirited. Nevertheless, I'd say this one was worth a read and hasn't deterred me from the next 3 volumes.
Цялото ревю в блога:http://knizhenjor.com/2013/12/karvavi...Най-сетне още Баркъъъърр!Предвид колко предстои да се унеса в словоохотлевене, вярвам, че е уместно да започна с признание.
Да бъде противоестествен, да съществува напук на системата и на разума: нима беше толкова лошо?
Никой не можеше да отрече, че съществува, докато имаше воля да бъде.
Мисълта беше възхитителна – като да откриеш нов смисъл в един сляп и глух свят”И още нещо от последните страници, все още отекващи в главата ми:“- Аз съм аз.
Не познавам други като мен, макар че защо да съм единствен?
Ако беше единствен на Земята, какво щеше да знаеш за себе си?
'Books of Blood: Volume Three' comprises five short stories which feature a compelling fusion of the paranormal and normal.In 'Son of Celluloid', an escaped convict winds up in a run-down movie theatre.
I enjoyed most of the movie scenes which were entertaining yet scary especially for those poor characters.
The horror in this story was in-your-face.In 'Confessions of a Pornographer's Shroud', Ronnie started off as a guy with an average yet decent life and an average job.
None of the characters were remotely likeable so I didn't care whether they survived or not and simply wanted the story to end.
И ето, че дойде време и за третия том от Кървавите Книги на Клайв Баркър!
Но, да не избързваме.Както може би знаете, Кървавите Книги не са точно сборници разкази, а по-скоро новели.
Изповедта на савана (На един порнограф) - господин Глас е съвестен счетоводител и добър католик, но за нещастие се замесва с грешните хора.
Болката на Глас обаче е така силна, че гробът не може да я удържи...4.
Остров, който не е обикновен.5.
Един от клиентите му обаче се оказва археолог, който ще обърка що-годе приятния му живот.
Awesme story, though some history into Rawhead and how he ended up in his grave would have been an interesting read."Confessions of a (Pornographer's) Shroud" -- A man screws over a mob boss.
Eventualy, he is murdered and exacts a bloody revenge on the mob boss by taking a second human form under the sheet that covered his corpse in the morgue.
I don't, however, understand how the corpse takes form under the sheet."Scape-Goats" -- This is the story that's just okay.
The Gods take revenge for the loss of their sheep with a haunting rain of rock and stone.
Представете си всичко, от което някога сте се страхували, и го вижте толкова образно и кърваво описано , че опитите на тялото ви физически да изстърже от себе си злокобните видения няма да закъснеят.
Торбалан е тук, триметров, древен и без кожа на лицето, ядящ хора като пуканки, и победен само благодарение на един древен спомен за утробата на живота, почти победена от любимата ни религия.
Ракът е тук, жив и с лице, с мечти и много амбиции, които надхвърлят ограниченията на физическата форма, която можем да предложим на най-актуалната форма за хуманоидно унищожение.
Баркър е всичко това, и много повече .
