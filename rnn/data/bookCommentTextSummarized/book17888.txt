Honestly, I love Lauren Oliver as much as the next person, I think she's very talented and creative.But come.on.This blurb?Am I the only one who realises?  Really?! To me, it practically screams Hunger. Games.But to be fair, I'm going to read it in respect to Lauren Oliver and to actually see if it will be a Hunger Games repeat.I'm praying it won't....
A "stand-alone" book? In the YA genre? By someone who's already had an extremely successful trilogy with FOUR bridges?   It will be a hit and then the publishers will be all   And I am TOTALLY alright with that. Update 7/17: Cover = simple and sleek. Me likey. Read all my reviews at www.rattlethestars.com
Actual Rating: 3.5 “Why did you play?” he asked.Revenge, Dodge thought, and Because I have nothing else. But out loud he said, “Money. Why else?” The name of the game is Panic, the name of the book should be Desperation, because this book is a psychological study of despair, anger, revenge. It's about the claustrophobia of growing up poor, the seething fury of revenge, the fear of a future you cannot contemplate. It is about love and loss, friendships and broken hearts; it is a literal rite of p
It is about love and loss, friendships and broken hearts; it is a literal rite of passage in a small town.I have read Lauren Oliver's books before, regardless of the book or whatever problems I have with them, one thing remains consistent: the characters in her books are intensely realistic and believable.
Her boyfriend, Matt, broke up with her to be with another girl, and like a typical teenaged girl in love, she cannot contemplate a future without him.Heather is a weak character to start, and we see her grow up as the book progresses.
But it's also a golden ticket, an answer to a hopeless situation, a high stakes event with life changing repercussions - for the winner and the losers - and I like how the dumb game is really a foil for a story that's really about taking that one chance because these are towns that have left their residents broken and with nothing left to lose.Even better, Oliver's made sure that that desperation comes through with every one of her characters.
It's this backdrop, this broken town of desperate people all needing that one payday because they've convinced themselves it's the one ticket to a future, and not the personal problems of any one character - although they are many, that makes Oliver's story work.Of course, I'm not saying Panic can't be read as teens playing, you know, Panic, the game.
There was an excellent chance to bring moral grayness to the story when a bystander dies in the middle of this "game" - but (view spoiler)[no, god forbid our positive teen characters actually see their stupidity costing dearly; no, just kidding, their victim actually died because of his own stupid choices, no harm done.
SpoilersLauren Oliver is known for her pretty writing.… “Now it looked like a person whose soul had been sucked out through his asshole.”“As soon as Heather saw the sign for Fresh Pines Mobile Park, she felt like her stomach might drop out her butt.” …Anyway, on to the review.This story had a lot of potential. Really – only a few things needed to be changed. Like, all the characters in the book, all the challenges of Panic, and the plot. That’s all.Panic started out as a game created by a bunch
Like, all the characters in the book, all the challenges of Panic, and the plot.
That’s all.Panic started out as a game created by a bunch of bored teenagers.
Then there’s the fact that her mother is a drug addict and they live in a trailer, and we’re all supposed to feel sorry for her when she eventually wins Panic.
Nat is afraid of checking her phone in the middle of the night and see no-one has texted.
The characters were dull, the challenges were dull, and I could go on all day about how bored I was while reading Panic.
I would highly recommend going into this expecting only entertainment value from it. I felt a bit detached from the characters, like there were 4 different undeveloped character arcs, but the plot was so interesting that I found myself not caring. If you're someone who needs to be able to click with the characters while you read something, though, I wouldn't recommend this. But I thought it was loads of fun and although it is completely unrealistic, I flew through it nevertheless.~~~~~OMG THE COVER IS GORGEOUS
Panic was different than i expected! I just posted my full booktalk/discussion: http://youtu.be/uR0U9yVC17w ! I flew through it and enjoyed the characters, the only thing i wasn't too crazy about was the last chapter before the epilouge! It wasn't bad.. I'm just never satisfied with the way that Lauren Oliver's books wrap up.
I swear the last 5 YA books read have starred the same female protagonist with a different name.
How many times am I supposed to read about an awkward, introverted, not popular, virginal girl (oh who also hates drinking) before I snap because that's the point I'm at.How many times am I going to suffer through a scene where a girl finally kisses the boy she likes only for an emotional debacle to occur RIGHT AWAY simply because the two *idiots* *cough* aren't on the same page?I have been incredibly unhappy with the last YA books I have read and am seriously considering taking a break from them overall for the next few months.
However maybe this is partially my fault, and I'm simply picking bad books.
***EDIT: 17 JULY***This cover is gorgeous!!! I can't even handle it!Can't wait for this book! ------------------ 24 June OKAY. We have a description! Sounds AH-MAZING! Now if we can only get a cover out of Miss. Oliver...But, let's be real here...March 2014??????? This is how I feel about that: Seriously, what kind of sick and twisted world is this????-----------------------------17 March TELL ME MORE LAUREN OLIVER!!!
On the other hand, the game Panic's frail, yet apparently enduring, nature was not very realistic considering the risks, keeping me emotionally detached, and I did find the plot ended up being fairly predictable.
Panic is a game where facing often life-risking fears can win you a small fortune - 50,000$ worth.
Bishop did not get enough face time for me to feel like I really knew him.
Above all, I liked the psychological aspects surrounding this game, as well as the depth and dramatic intensity of both the characters and plot.
Overall I felt that this was an exciting non-deep book. The characters were pretty flat, and their backstories were badly fleshed out, but I didn't care.. for me, this book was all about the crazy intense challenges, and boy did it deliver! Some of the challenges were so crazy I actually found myself feeling nervous for the safety of the characters! If you're looking for a book about "facing your fears" or "overcoming adversity" or "anything else deep" I don't think that this does a good job.. but if you're looking for something entertaining, exciting, and thrilling pick up Panic!
Disappointing. This book lacked something that "Before I Fall" and the "Delirium" series did such a great job of creating - that sense of desperation. Without it, Panic was just a stupid game. And I would have been fine accepting it as such, but I felt Oliver threw in too many sob stories that failed to pull at my emotional strings, leaving me calloused and disconnected from the characters.(Warning: Hidden parts contain major spoilers, so don't click them!) THE GAME I was very confused for the f
And I would have been fine accepting it as such, but I felt Oliver threw in too many sob stories that failed to pull at my emotional strings, leaving me calloused and disconnected from the characters.(Warning: Hidden parts contain major spoilers, so don't click them!)
That's it?"Now going back to being eager about finding out each kid's story and the motives driving his/her decision to stay in the game....
Even when she's being good, I just felt like she was a ticking time bomb.Nat - She was the biggest character disappointment in this book.
This was such a fun read! The only problem I had was that I didn't really feel for any of the characters. I also wasn't a huge fan of the ending. Here's a link to my video review for Panic: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIPbI...
Compare Panic to one sorority/fraternity hazing gone horribly wrong, and you'll know what you're getting into before you pick up the book.Funny thing is, I started out noting a lot of positives (all of which were turned on their head).
It explores character behavior outside of the actual game itself.
Most of those movies were more entertaining than this book was.Do I think Lauren Oliver had a good idea in exploring the mindset of what drives people to do what they do?
I know that some people hated the characters, but I didn't.
Yet, I think I kind of liked the book.
Apparently, Lauren Oliver can write anything WELL. This book is so different from her Delirium series and from Before I Fall, yet still awesome. The story wasn't something I would normally be interested in, but I read it because Oliver's writing style is so amazing. I was not disappointed.
She starts off with an intriguing concept, flowery writing, gorgeous atmosphere, and great character voices.
And yet again, as usual, Oliver nails character voices.
Panic begins to succeed with character work, and then begins to fall flat by failing to truly make the reader remember them.
Heather and Dodge do have distinguishable voices, and yet neither of them are really pushed to their limits.
But the real issue is that the characters joining Panic makes no sense.
This lack of true motivation makes the characters seem flimsy when they’re actually pretty good characters.Panic should've been so good.
Initial reaction: I really wanted to like "Panic" more than I actually did - some of it had measures where the character background and emotions were potent (particularly with Heather and Lily's circumstances), but I was surprisingly unaffected by much of the novel despite the daredevil stunts and overarching game the teens played.
Sometimes her tone was a little shrill for the character emotional inflections.The narrative has a third-person narration, with two main characters: Heather and Dodge.
I think Heather's circumstances were a little more palpable for me personally, since I saw the relationship with her sister, the abrasiveness of their mother, and how they connected with the eclectic lifestyle and animal preferences of Ann, who takes them in during a difficult measure.
**This is not a dystopian.***2 stars*This one was very disappointing, because I had high expectations and I feel like the synopsis misled me.I picked this book thinking ''A competition?
Why I love competitions is because I enjoy feeling the excitement, getting to know the competitors and picking my own champion.
But in Panic, we didn’t really get to know the other competitors around the main characters except by their name (which, by the way, I couldn’t help but forget.)This is really a contemporary.There is so much drama.Heather has problems with her mom and is heart-broken.
But if you have the choice between Panic and another book like, for example,To All the Boys I've Loved Before(in the contemporary genre), pick the latter.Happy reading!
5 words: Silly children playing dangerous games.I was pretty love/hate with this book the whole time I was reading it.
From loving the turmoil with the relationships to hating the actions of these stupid, irresponsible children, I was swinging backwards and forwards from a rope swing tied to a branch.There was something that just angered me so much about how these stupid little children endangered the lives of everyone.
The list of irresponsible, dangerous, IDIOTIC things these stupid little children get up to is endless.But I found that I enjoyed the other stories in this book, although they were greatly overshadowed.
Panic is an unexpected young adult story set in a realistic time and place but with a dystopian feel to it.
The first part of the story, I have to admit, got me asking "where is this going?" but when I reached the interesting parts of story especially the individual challenges, I felt almost like panicking myself.
I also like the love stories between the characters because although the love stories may not seem to be the center of the entire story, it is mainly love that moved the major characters into action.
I just...Why?! I mean I really don't like to be... This is seriously how I look right now. Life is just so bland...
takhle nejak to vypadalo:12:00 - doctu to aspon na 60 procent61 procent - tak na 6668 - sakra, no tak 7073 - ne, vubec neni pul druhy, a do 75 to dam...75 - ale ted je to zajimavy...80 - ted taky!85 - tak uz to doctu, no...je 3:15 a posledni stranky jsem malem nedychala... ani se mi nechce spat. tak asi... budu zirat do stropu.
Every part made my heart race. Oh, Lauren Oliver, I just love you.
Luckily, it did grow onto me in the duration of the 400 pages, but it made the first quarter difficult to venture by.Panic is told by Heather and Dodge--though really there felt like four main characters (Heather, Dodge, Natalie and Bishop).
I liked his back story and reason for joining the game, Panic.
His personality was determined and strong, which I liked.I do believe I should briefly explain how Panic works.
I like the idea of revenge to let everyone see what you're made of but Panic is not a smart way to go by it.The romance was very disappointing.
This book was alright, but it definitely wasn't as good as I wanted it to be.
I had a hard time getting into it because it was kind of a weird plot to wrap my head around, that these kids could play this horrible game for so long and it never once in all those years got shut down.
I had a hard time believing this concept that this could actually happen in a town, because it was something that seemed so unrealistic set In a contemporary book.
That just felt kind of weird to me, and there were some plot holes that were nagging at me as well.
A progressão da estória é muito boa e faz com que você não consiga parar de ler.
Isso é algo que eu admiro muito em autores que conseguem fazê-lo sem serem muito óbvios com o foreshadowing.Há dois pontos de vista no livro e os personagens principais são bem desenvolvidos, mas eu me senti mais conectada à Heather que ao Dodge.
Acho que isso se deve principalmente ao fato que a jornada emocional dela tem muito mais a ver com o tema geral do livro que a dele.
Dodge, on the other hand, does not feel scared of Panic; he wants revenge, and that thirst will drive him throughout the game.
Amidst the near-death experiences thrust upon them by the judges of Panic, both Heather and Dodge will discover new things about themselves, each other, and those around them.
The ending also left me feeling disappointed because it failed to give either character the growth or depth they needed.Overall, not the worst book - Panic kept my attention even if it did not have me flipping the pages.
I always set the bar low, and OF COURSE this book passed all of my expectations and then some.
It was relatively fast paced and had some good challenges.
I liked that I didn't feel the need to like every character all the time.
I felt like Oliver writes very human people who do screw up, and this novel shows them at their worst of times (at this point of their lives).
Even though the two main characters come from similar "side of the tracks" their stories were different and it shows how complex people really are.
So glad I gave this book a chance!
