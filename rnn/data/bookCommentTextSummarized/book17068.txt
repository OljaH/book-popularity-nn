I still believe no one could understand my love for Shaman King or have I not found the right place to fangirl about it yet.
Ren's fight, even if I already watched the anime several times and knew what was going to happen.
There is also another kind of story about the evil spirit that I supposed was at the old gym in the anime, the spirit that possessed Ryu but there is no other mention of Ryu in this book.
There is also no mention of ghost friends of Yoh helping him in school in the anime.
I remember when I first read this in that huge 'Shonen Jump' massive sized book of many anime series that started back in March 2003 and ended in August 2007.Man I used to fight with my brother over these darn things. But now I just buy the actual books. Curse you Half-Priced-Books for making this so easy!I love sassy Yoh. With his new buddy Admidamaru. The cute midget Manta.Bad Ass Wanna-be Ryu.Begin the world of Shaman King! WOOOO!
This was my favorite anime as a child. So I think it's more than appropriate to read it now that I've grown more comfortable with manga - reading in general.  Well, I can say that manga aren't for everyone. You should like the way the story is presented to really enjoy this experience, but this one is a good place to start. It is not really particular regarding style or message, and is really funny. And about what happens... I'm sure you've read the synopsis. If you haven't I advice you to go a

If you haven't I advice you to go and read that as I don't want to make this review a summary.
We meet Yoh. He is a carefree guy.
I don't like this type of guys in particular, but he is ok.
When I read the manga a few years later, however, I wasn't as moved.
Manta (Morty in the show, a name playing off the word "mortician") takes a shortcut through a cemetery at night and meets Yoh, a shaman.
The two inexplicably become friends and Manta follows Yoh on his adventures to become the shaman king.
Yoh's laid back personality allows for moments of humor that break up the action and seriousness that often pervades the story.If you read the manga and don't love it, give the anime a shot - Morty (Manta) isn't nearly as annoying and that alone makes a huge difference in my reception of the series.
I absolutely LOVE it!!! <3

65th book read in 2017.Number 626 out of 629 on my all time book list. By far the worst manga I have ever read.
I used to be a huge fan of anime.
But never of manga.
Not until now.Don't get me wrong, I still enjoy anime but I am very very picky now.Manga was not my thing, not that I had tried reading one, to be honest...I thought that they were boring, for some stupid reason.Guess what...
On the contrary, my first manga reading experience made me think that anime are boring!
I devoured it!!!It was brilliant, very funny, full of action and the art was simple but meaningful and flawless!!!I was worried that I wouldn't get used to reading a manga (you read it backwards, from right to left, really...).
It made me a fan of both manga and Shaman King!!!

This manga is “Shaman King”. I love this manga. The protagonist is Yo Asakura. He is a shaman. And he wanted to be a top of shaman - Shaman King He trains and fights against other shaman with the soul. The soul is Amidamaru. He was a samurai before he died. I like this character. He is so cool.  This manga is one of the most favorite manga for me. So I hope that you will read this manga and love this manga.
Waw, me encantó desde el principio. Mucho humor, mucha acción y mucho suspenso, espero que los próximos volúmenes se mntengan así y continuemos viendo la evolución y/o involución de estos personajes.
Shaman King is the first anime I ever watched and this happened to be the first manga I’ve read too.
But in all honestly I didn’t enjoy this as much as the anime.
Yoh is charming like always but I still think I’m used to watching him that it’s not the same but I still loved him a lot.
The biggest problem is Manta in this manga because his reactions look so fake and the art where he shouts is just horrible.
I enjoyed the parts which didn’t appear in the anime like saving children etc.
but I don’t know if it’s enough for me to go on.
Me encontré con lo que pensaba: shonen genérico que mezcla peleas con humor, con autosuperación, con indicios de tramas oscuras a desarrollas a posteriori, con super-deformeds que a veces son un poco irritantes y toda la bola. Y la verdad que mal no la pasé, pero tampoco me morí por agarrar el #2 cuando terminé este. Supongo que le iré tomando cariño a la serie con el correr de los tomos, por ahora se queda con una linda historia introductoria y poco más. Déjà vu...?
Not horrible. I guess I'll read the next one. Manta is very annoying, though, and the chibi art used for him is borderline stupid, frankly. I like the idea of a shaman in Tokyo, and Amidamaru is a cool ghost. We'll see.
SO HAPPY TO BE READING THIS SERIES AGAIN!!I read about 10 volumes back in 2012, but this time I'm planning on getting through the whole series. :)
Estado: todos los tomos/capítulos leidos.
Well that's how things went in the first few pages of Shaman King.After the first pages of these books I wa hooked.
I love how the action comes so fast in the first book.I really like some of the quotes from these books.
A few examples are "Everything will work out" and"don't be scared I got you." I know that manga's are not for everyone but if you like comedy, action and drama then this book is for you.I think this book is good for boys and girls alike.
Shaman King has also been featured in top ten articles by respected media.I give this book 5 stars.
First, I started with anime, quite a long time ago.
And ever since I started living in London, I promised myself that one day I would read manga.
The story is about the young shaman, named Yoh, who is coming to Tokyo to train himself to become more and more powerful.
There he meets Manta, a small boy, who becomes his friend.
From now on, they are having numerous adventures, finding out more about shamans and their role and abilities, and meeting new characters.
For fans of manga - a must read!
Ένα manga στο κλασικό Shounen ύφος, με πάρα πολύ καλό σχέδιο και ενδιαφέρουσα πλοκή. Αν και δεν πρωτοτυπεί ιδιαίτερα ωστόσο έχει όλα εκείνα τα στοιχεία που θα σε εθίσουν μέχρι το τέλος. Ο Γιο Ασακούρα είναι ο τύπος μεταξύ χίπη και φιλόσοφου που μέσα του καίει η αρχέγονη δύναμη των σαμάνων, και που θα μπορούσε να είναι φίλος σου και να αράζατε παρέα.Tο σχέδιο του Takei είναι πολύ καλό με καθαρή γραμμή και πολύ όμορφες λεπτομέρειες, και δίνει ένα τελικό αποτέλεσμα που πραγματικά αξίζει προσοχής και απόλαυσης.
Shaman King is a manga that I picked up while reading the monthly Shounen Jump growing up. It is one of the few titles that sparked my interest in manga as a whole and has special place in my heart.The series starts off rather comical at first but quickly shows that it has layers to the story and characters that I will not spoil for those who have not read the series.If you enjoy manga like Yu Yu Hakusho and Dragonball this is sort of a hybrid between the supernatural and tournament storylines and could be enjoyable.
When Oyamada takes a shortcut through a cemetery, he comes across Yoh, a young shaman that is looking for a soul to bond with. Their meeting starts an adventure involving swordfights, ghosts, and dangerous secrets! Takei gives readers a exciting journey into the supernatural with the beginning to the beloved "Shaman King" series. Beware the people you come across in the dark of night...
Shaman King (1998) is one of the best fantasy and religion manga of the 90s written and drawn by Hiroyuki Takei. Especially the well round characters like the love triangle between the twin brothers Yoh and Hao Asakura with Anna Kyoyama. Finally, to let you know that a sequel of the manga is available called Shaman King Flowers!
In the beginning the book was a bit confusing. I really liked the characters and thought that the one guy was funny cause he was always so angry. One thing that I didn't like about this book was that it would switch from topic to topic. Even though I didn't like this about the book, it came together nicely and I enjoyed reading it.
The Shaman King by Hiroyuki Takei is an absolutely fascinating manga to read, and the first manga book I ever read, and it really gave me a good idea about manga in general. I like how the author started his "Shaman King" manga series and he definitely showed some effort making this book.REVIEW TOO BE CONTINUED...
This was a lot of fun. It’s filled with action and silly humor by Manta who serves as the book’s comic relief. The artwork was good and the story is interesting. I think Yoh is a great character and his samurai companion Amidamaru is cool as hell. This looks to be an intriguing series and I’m definitely going to continue with it. This first volume of Shaman King is a good time.
Un tomo introductorio pero nada aburrido; es más, Yoh es muy gracioso aquí, luego se vuelve más serio. Se presentan a varios personajes principales (Len es muy canijo 😂) y empiezan las batallas. Me estoy leyendo la versión de Viz (inglés).
Lo admito.viendome tan a tras en mi meta de lectura este año, me aventuro a leer muchos mangas en pos de tener algo de esperanza.Yoh Asakura por ahora me has caido muy bien. esperemos a ver hasta donde vamos juntos.
**** 1/2
it was good
El mejor inicio para un manga. Humor súper divertido y personajes muy originales. Es genial ver un protagonista que no trata de ser el mejor sino simplemente relajarse.
