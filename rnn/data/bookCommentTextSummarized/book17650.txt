At least you know what you are about to get when you pick up her novels - Naughty Bits is a hard core brother/sister erotica.
She is "clean" like flower in pretty meadow, and all other girls are worthless sluts.
He is a jerk/bad boy/lost soul/little boy in hot, pierced, tattooed body.Whole book is series of their "forbidden encounters" and fighting against what they feel.
Oh look, girls like to read about bad boys, let's put that in.
Because he has daddy/brother/mommy issues.Now what about girl?
And she constantly repeats how her stepbrother is hot and imagines hundred dirty things she would like to do to him.
And once she got to know him it became clear that underneath all the anger that he showed the world was a guy with a very good heart who wanted her just as much as she wanted him.
I loved the way the author incorporated both sides of the story.
There were some things (in the second half) that I might have wanted a little differently but they didn't stop me from loving the story and there's really no doubt that this book was completely unputdownable!!If you want a sexy, unique, unconventional romance to fall in love with, try this one!!Rating: 4.5 stars.
★★★★ ! Stepbrother Dearest (stand-alone). Tragedy re-connects girl with the step-brother she still loves, but can’t have! Stepbrother Dearest = Heart Be Desert Ports!   “I want to be the first one to show you everything and to be the one you’ll always remember for the rest of your life.”   Stepbrother Dearest (stand-alone) opens up to high school senior Greta Hansen waiting for her stepbrother to arrive for a year-long stay. Nothing could have prepared her for Elec O’Rourke. He is eerily hand
Stepbrother Dearest (stand-alone) opens up to high school senior Greta Hansen waiting for her stepbrother to arrive for a year-long stay.
Soon Greta starts getting mixed signals from Elec.
But her heart never got over Elec.
Elec remains elusive sending Greta mixed signals.Much of story is them navigating after tragedy, spending time catching up and slowly opening up about their current and past situations.
Ultimately it’s their story of an soul searching passion and unending love and how in life sometimes everything still isn’t enough….
Just like Elec kept a piece of Greta’s heart, he kept part of mine.
4 Stars I’m not going to lie… the title and the cover of this book drew me right in and made me one click the minute it went live. I’ve never read this author and I wasn’t sure what the book was about (besides a stepbrother/stepsister) but I knew I had to read it. I LOVE forbidden love stories so the title alone drew me in. Stepbrother Dearest was different that I expected. It was a little ‘young’ for a lack of a better word, at the beginning. Then it got a little sweet and sexy. The last half w
It was one of those books that wasn’t perfect for me, but it was also one that I read in one sitting so you know I was hooked from the start.
She’s never met him, but he’s coming to stay with her family for a year while his mom travels from work.
Greta wants to get to know Elec, to make him feel comfortable.
No matter whats going on in their lives, Elec and Greta can’t deny the feelings they still have for one another.
There was a lot in the middle that stressed me out, but when I’m reading, I love when I get invested and feel like that, so it worked for me.

3.5 Stars "You make me feel things, Greta. You always have. When I'm around you, whether it's good or bad...I feel everything. Stepbrother Dearest, is written in two parts. In the first part the character are 17/18 years old and in highschool. In the second part the book fast forwards seven years. The characters are reunited, and so the story continues.So first of all let me just say that, Stepbrother Dearest was a really great book. The writing was engaging, the characters multifaceted and the
It means as per Goodreads rating system that I liked the book bordering on really liked it.Here's a quick summary of my feelings towards Stepbrother Dearest:Yes, the story follows the relationship of Greta and Elec who are step-siblings.
Rants are not done because we want to slam the book, I just rant because I have all these emotions inside me that need to be let out.Greta, was obviously still in love with Elec and I'm not sure but I think he was too, or maybe it was just lust.
His POV should have been interwoven into the book, it would have given me the reader the opportunity to empathise with Elec and not feel like he didn't want Greta as much as she wanted him.
To tell you the truth, I was not going to write a review for this book, because I really don’t have anything positive to say about it.
Ah, I don’t care, because this book obviously doesn’t have a problem with repeating itself.
I mean, in the first part I was willing to forgive her, she’s young and in love.
It’s making me sad that some really amazing books are not getting enough attention while crap like this gets a lot of undeserved hype.
So, to conclude, I didn’t like it and don’t recommend it to anyone.
"I know I'm not supposed to care. But when it comes to you, what I'm supposed to be feeling has never seemed to matter."  This was one angsty ride! The book was very intense and emotional. I couldn't stay away from it and kept flipping pages like crazy. I was enamoured with the story from the beginning till the end. It is divided into two parts. The first one tells us how Greta and Elec met. They were step siblings, Elec came to live with Greta, her mom and his dad for a year. She wanted to be
I know it was an issue for some of my friends, but I wasn't really put off by it, cause these things can happen in life and everything was resolved very well in the end.(view spoiler)[I know, the fact that he loved them both was not cool, but it's not like he didn't try.
Realizing that now put my feelings back at square one even though I wouldn't be able to act on them."But he couldn't fully love Chelsea IMO, because his heart was always with Greta, he just wasn't aware of that while they were apart.
I loved this book!
I had expected the story to be kind of hard to get into after reading many reviews that said it got off to a slow start.
The story of Elec and Greta captivated me from page one.
I devoured this book!Elec and Greta's story was full of passion, forbidden desire and angst.
Reading their story took me on an emotional roller coaster ride.
After a brief, but intense, fling, Elec disappears from Greta's life for years.
This was one of those books that kept me up late into the night.
Title: Stepbrother DearestSeries: StandaloneAuthor: Penelope WardRelease Date:  September 29, 2014Rating: 4 starsCliffhanger:. No HEA:  (view spoiler)[ Yes (hide spoiler)]"I know I'm not supposed to care. But when it comes to you, what I'm supposed to be feeling has never seemed to matter."This story follows Greta.

And even though I tried to stop it, I gave you a piece of mine."From the explosive start to the sweet finish,  Stepbrother Dearest  was engaging read.
I was turned on, I was pissed off quite few times, I also laughed so hard I probably looked like a psychiatric ward patient, because of the amazing banter between our main characters, so yes I can honestly recommend this book.
”“I know I’m not supposed to care. But when it comes to you, what I’m supposed to be feeling has never seemed to matter.” This is definitely a hit or miss type story. I totally get friend’s issues like Elec’s pov later on or that he’s kind of young to be that skilled in the bedroom and so on and so forth. For me, it was perfectly angsty and Elec was panty dropping hot and I truly fell for him while Greta was really likable and for me that’s a total win win. Greta’s stepfather’s son, Elec comes
For me, it was perfectly angsty and Elec was panty dropping hot and I truly fell for him while Greta was really likable and for me that’s a total win win.
This story is hot and highly entertaining and I just loved Elec.
Well, Elec felt like it would be disloyal to his mother and his mother is completely unstable as is her feelings for Greta and her mother.
Yes, Elec’s pov through his written story that he sends Greta was very helpful.Elec arrives at the funeral with his live in girlfriend, Chelsea but all the old feelings are still there for Greta.
I think that’s why I really fell into the story, I may not have connected 100% to Greta, but I got her and I liked her a lot.
While he may have said and done things to Greta to get a reaction from her, I honestly didn’t think any of his actions were truly mean or mean-spirited.
I made you feel like I didn’t want you looking at me – that self-respect bullshit I fed you.
Always.”  So clearly…I enjoyed the story, loved the characters, everything was great...but there was part towards the end of the book that I got a little frustrated with.
Stepbrother Dearest was a fast-paced, angsty ride. When Greata's new stepbrother moves in, he is not want she expected. Elec and his father have a difficult relationship. The last thing he wants to do is move in with him and his new family, but with his mother going out to the country for a year and he is out of options. Elec is rude, confrontational, and Greta is extremely attracted to him. "Physically, he was my dream and in every other way, my nightmare."  These two get off to a rough start,
The last thing he wants to do is move in with him and his new family, but with his mother going out to the country for a year and he is out of options.
Elec is rude, confrontational, and Greta is extremely attracted to him.
These two get off to a rough start, but as time passes, Greta discovers there is more to Elec than meets the eye.
Just as things are starting to progress, Elec gets a phone call that changes everything.
Years pass, now, 7 years later, a family tragedy brings Elec back into Greta's life.
Filled with many funny moments, interesting characters and a much deeper "meaning" than I thought it would have.
The first part ends with a heartbreaking goodbye and the second part is dominated by their strong feelings and Elec's side of events told in a refreshing way.I liked the writing style a lot, and I found Elec's way of telling his story genius, although a little bit repetitive in the dialogue it was very entertaining and so revealing.
Yes, this is one of the best step-brother romances you can find.THOUGHTS ABOUT THE BOOK- Their first time was very intimate and life altering for both of them.- The anagrams were an interesting touch.
THIS BOOK!This book is one of my most favorite books this year!I ABSOLUTELY, COMPLETELY, WHOLEHEARTEDLY LOVED it.I had a book buzz. *tingles, tummy dips, moments of skipping through my house, hugging my kindle, singing "this is the best book ever"... etc.*It's been FOREVER since I've had an actual freaking book buzz!!!!!F.O.R.E.V.E.R!Gosh, I was worried that I was never going to get that buzzing feeling back when reading! Wooo!But this.. This was angsty. It was sexy. It was just flipping awesome!If you buy one book... let it be this! ➔➔ http://amzn.to/1pBLSGu
The story starts with Elec coming to live with his father and his new family.
He is miserable in Boston, hates his father and decides being an ass to Greta will make things better for him.
My thoughtsCocky assholes are usually my thing and I did enjoy Elec, but throw in the immaturity it was just too much.
We do end up getting both POV's in the story.
I liked knowing Elec's POV, but the way this one is done it was basically retelling the same story I had just read.
I actually couldn't wait to start it today, but in the end it was just okay.
Elec and Greta take us on an emotional roller coaster that begins when they meet as teens and share a reluctant but very present connection.
One night, it comes to a head and the next day, Elec has to leave to take care of something important.
Time passes and Elec is brought back into her life at an emotional moment.
Where there once was fire, there are sparks but Elec didn't come back alone.
In the end I had quite a few questions so it didn't wrap up as well as I would've liked but all in all, it was a good read and quite hottt.
Elec tries to resist his feelings for Greta, but as they begin to spend more time together, he finds himself unable to deny their attraction.
She has strong feelings for Elec and she knew that underneath his cockiness there was a sweet guy.
I haven't read a taboo book before so I was worried that these two coming together would make me feel uncomfortable but the fact is I loved the story and all their hurdles and wasn’t uncomfortable at all.
"I fucking love you too.I don't think I realized how much until I saw you again."This story had everything I would want in a book and much more.
*****FIVE STARS*****{BR with Mel, Dee, and Sharon} This is the first Penelope Ward book I've read and I wasn't sure what to expect from all of the conflicting reviews on GR. I went in completely blind. I looked at reviews but skimmed only for fear of coming across any spoilers.I was sucked into the story from the very beginning!!! I was so pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed this one. It was funny, heart breaking, angsty, and had some pretty amazing sexy times as well!! PLUS a HOT new boo
Greta tries hard to get through Elec's impenetrable wall, and as time passes the two can't help but start to fall for each other.
I loved that Elec was a writer and that he opened up to Greta by letting her read one of his stories.
I did keep asking myself.."how are these two going at it when their parents are in the room down the hall????" Oh well, it worked for me anyway, so I wasn't going to harp on that too much.Elec leaves the next day, and it will be SEVEN YEARS before they see each other again!!!
**5 I-finally-know-what-the-fuss-was-about-these-anagrams stars**Greta lives with her mother and stepfather. One day her stepbrother moves in temporarily with them and although she had been excited to meet him, he turns out to be an ass. The worst is that she's attracted to him. Even worse, the moment they will get close to each other, his time will be up and he will have to leave. Since he doesn't seem to have the best relationship with his father, the odds are against them.  “You’re the only g
Let's start with the fact that I truly enjoyed this book and I believe it's probably the best Stepbrother romance I have read so far!
I truly enjoyed reading this and even though there were a few points where I thought that some kind of bullshit was about to happen, I couldn't express how pleased I was in the end by the outcome.
So, like I said I loved it, it was one of the best taboo romances I've read, loved the relationship between them, the banter and the built up and the hero was swoon worthy, the bad boy I had missed reading about (and let's not forget about him being pierced in all the right places ;D)

His reasons for not being able to be with her seemed bogus and like an accuse to love and leave.Then we come towards the end of the book....
"When I'm around you, whether it's good or bad...I feel everything."
This part in the book Greta reads Elec's bio and we see the story line in his point of view.
His feelings for Greta seemed really and the chemistry finally fell into place.
At this point I feel in love with the book!!
I loved the book and everyone should read it!!
“You were the best thing that ever happened to me. I hope someday I can say you were one of the best, but for now, it’s only you.”  You know those books that pull you in like a riptide, taking over all your senses and making you completely oblivious to the fact that there is a real life outside those pages waiting for you to live it? Well, this is one of those books. From the moment I read the title, something inside me started screaming, I want, the mere idea of a forbidden romance of this ty
Greta is his antithesis—innocent and somewhat naïve, she is the kind of girl who feels freely, openly, unreservedly because that is the way she has been loved all her life, and she is also the kind of heroine we cannot help but love from the start.
Greta’s silent pain from seeing that Elec has moved on with his life and perhaps never shared the same feelings as hers is as acute as it is compelling.
It added so much colour to the story, so many extra layers for us to ponder upon, making Greta and Elec two well-rounded, almost real characters popping out from these pages.
“You were the best thing that ever happen to me. I hope that someday I can say you were one of the best, but for now, it's only you.”  Well, I'll be honest if it wouldn't have been for my friends here, i wouldn't even have picked this book. Although the Title really attract me, but after so many fail reads of stepbrother & sister love, i was really wary to pick this one out. But after reading so many 5star reviews, i just decided to pick this out. And i am glad i picked it out. This was so
Although the Title really attract me, but after so many fail reads of stepbrother & sister love, i was really wary to pick this one out.
Elec really was an exception of the forbidden love between a stepbrother and sister.
But things can't go the way you wanted to and it happened with Elec & Greta too.
But tragedy happens and his father Randy had a heart-attack and died and that led Elec and Greta back to the square one from where they started.
I loved every single thing of this book with the fucking amazing plot twist and a story to break and cheer up your heart.
1.5 starsI don't even feel good to review this book. Ah, I'll do it soon.
I tend to avoid reading a synopsis but I could not help it the title made me do it.. Can't wait for this to release!

The book is told in Greta's POV, though, we do get Elec's POV later on.
When I started reading, I assumed this would continue with Elec and Greta being seventeen year old teens.
Greta has been an only child her whole life, that changes when her Step Father Randy decides to bring his son Elec to come live with them.
Greta and Elec form a bit of a bond, and with it, the connection they share grows, too.
I liked that I was able to feel the connection between Elec and Greta.
I also would have liked to have seen Greta grow up a bit.
3 STARSGenre: NA romanceCover: 8/10Writing: 8/10Heroine: 4/10Hero: 7/10Humour: 2/10Hotness: 7/10Romance: 6/10Extra book Details: Heroine POV; 1st person. Stand-alone. Approx 290 kindle pages. When Greta sees her new Stepbrother for the first time, she can't help but be overwhelmed with lust.... That is, until he opens his mouth.Living with him in such close quarters proves quite the challenge, Elec is a man-whoring, smoking (in more ways that one), tatted asshole that just loves to get under her
But she still wishes he'd get in her pants.Unfortunately Elec is definitely more than what's on the surface, and soon Greta starts to fall for her broken, talented, foul-mouthed Stepbrother.
I'm so conflicted (much like Elec was towards Greta)...It was one of those books where I wished I could have changed it around and made it a better read for me.I really loved the beginning.
There were also times when I felt that Greta needed some self-respect.At 66% there was a whole 20% of the book dedicated to Elec's POV.
Find all of my reviews at: http://52bookminimum.blogspot.com/Save your judgment because . . . .  I had a pretty specific M.O. when I started this . . . .  Followed with . . . . For some reason I thought I had read Penelope Ward before. Apparently I haven’t, but I have read Vi Keeland and they appear to collaborate on stuff every now and again so maybe my old lady brain only kinda failed me instead of completely failed me. #shrug So back to the book. Normally I try to live my life via the sage ad
Apparently I haven’t, but I have read Vi Keeland and they appear to collaborate on stuff every now and again so maybe my old lady brain only kinda failed me instead of completely failed me.
What I got instead was like zero smut and a terrible first half that had my eyes rolling so far back in my head I thought I’d never get them straightened out.
Apparently I read it wrong because I took a gander at other reviews and it seems everyone hated the second half but liked the first.
If you are looking for a jerk of a Hero you want to hate and love, then Elec is for you.SummaryTo sum it up, Elec moves in with Greta to live with her and the family for a year.
Elec is mean, says off handed comments to Greta and wants nothing to do with his new family.
Some of the things Elec does and says I’m just grinning from ear to ear, because it’s so mean, but it makes for such a great read.He calls her pretty plain, he says she is pathetic and he continues to make snide remarks.
"Why are you looking at me like that?”“Like what?”“Like you’re trying to remember what I looked like the other night…like you’d rather have me for dinner.” He snickered. “And why are you winking at me?” Stepbrother Dearest certainly had my attention in this first half. The second half became draggy and it was repeating the first half. But the last two chapters was sweet! This book is all about that stepbrother - he is such a bad boy, tattooed and pierced.  Hero  YUMMY, my type of hero!   Heroin
“And why are you winking at me?” Stepbrother Dearest certainly had my attention in this first half.
The second half became draggy and it was repeating the first half.
This book is all about that stepbrother - he is such a bad boy, tattooed and pierced.
Steamy  Yes, loved it and their UST was good.
I would have loved the book to remain in Part 1 itself.
Part 2 as said was repeating the dialogue from Part 1 and I skimmed it.
Hence it became a quick read for me.
Overall, I enjoyed the book but I didn't love it.
Happy reading D x
