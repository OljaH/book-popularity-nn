I’ve actually heard, quite a few times now, that second books can be a beast.
Just in case you don’t fully grasp how spectacular I found that book to be, a pristine signed copy has garnered a coveted spot on my bookshelf among the few others I’ve considered worthy over the years.This one on the other hand, not so much.
If you’re a crazed stalker that’s looking for a victim to watch, assault or murder, would you really turn to a website to provide the details of a woman’s daily commute on a train?
(hide spoiler)] The author provided an explanation within the story, but unfortunately it wasn’t enough to get this reader on board.
which, yes, is what The Girl on the Train did, but this is completely its own thing, although paula hawkins does blurb it, because british transportation-based thriller writing women gotta stick together.zoe walker is stuck on a stalled train during her commute home one night, forced to read the parts of the paper she wouldn't ordinarily in her desperation for diversion, when she notices a photo of herself in a classified ad with no information other than a phone number and a web address: findtheone.com.
Towards the end of this book I felt as if I was standing on the edge of a precipice, my stomach chasing butterflies, and my heart beating fit to burst - but forgive me, I'm getting ahead of myself, because there's much more to come before then.Nobody thinks too deeply about their daily commute to and from work by Tube, a bit mundane maybe, sometimes stressful, the hustle and bustle, but after reading this it would be hard not to see something a bit more sinister in your daily journey.
Worse still it's among the ads for 'escorts' chat lines and dating agencies.
So far, attempts to control surveillance have generally failed.Yes...there 'are' some obvious benefits: reduction of crime and other smaller abuses that go unreported--- but Clare Mackintosh gave us a precautionary story....and it 'is'creepy to think about.
Think about all the people being watched-- especially women.
After Zoe Walker sees her photo in the London Gazette, in the classified section, she is determined to get some answers....especially after immediately the next day the advert shows a photo of another woman.Can you imagine after there have been women murdered since discovering the picture of yourself --- you come to this thought:"What if someone's putting in photo's of women they're going to murder, and I'm next?"Fearful!
This is not a good follow up to Clare Mackintosh's debut blockbuster, I LET YOU GO.
I'm picky, but I loved that book.
I even added it to my TWISTER HALL OF FAME shelf!The problems with I SEE YOU:First, I figured out the "twisty" ending VERY EARLY in the book.
The entire story is built on a naive idea that stalkers would pay big money to join a website that would do the stalking for them.
Yes. Third, the story is boring.
Just don't.I see my GR friends are giving high ratings to Mackintosh's third book.
Let's hope this is simply a sophomore slump!
I have come across authors debut novels that have really made an impact on me then their subsequent book has fallen flat, so I opened this with trepidation, but I need not have feared because this author has a talent.
Yep, a real talent that just comes through this book immensely.
All the characters in this story are so real, from someone who is the main character right down to someone you would feel in life is insignificant.But they are not.This is a thrill ride, this is a 'is someone watching me, if so who'.At times its a scary read, a thrilling read, many bit your nail moments.This is an author that I will be following.My thanks to Little, Brown Book Group UK via Net Galley for my early copy.

PC Kelly Swift was told in the third person and sometimes I found her to be a little confusing when she would be recounting some incidences from her past.To sum it all up it was an entertaining, mostly enjoyable, suspenseful, steady-paced, quick and easy read with a twist ending.Review written and posted on our themed book blog:Two Sisters Lost In A Coulee Readinghttps://twosisterslostinacoulee.comCoulee: a term applied rather loosely to different landforms, all of which refer to a kind of valley.
She reminded me a bit of Havers in Elizabeth George's Linley and Havers series -- well meaning and smart, but often overly eager.-I didn't love Zoe as a character, but I did like the interactions with her various family members.-The very end was clever, although awfully disturbing.What bugged me:-I never quite bought into the purpose for which Zoe and other women's photos ended up in the dating service section of the newspaper without their knowledge.-Although generally very readable, the middle of I See You felt kind of slack and aimless.-The "who" part of the resolution irked me.
Zoe dismisses it and resumes her regular family life with her two adult children, Katie and Justin, and her live-in boyfriend, Simon.But as the days goes by, Zoe has the odd feeling that she's being followed.
Her first book, I Let You Go, was so outstanding.
That is a hard act to follow even when you're the actual author.
Mackintosh has done mega research here in online websites, social media, and police procedures.
It didn't hold me to the page as her first book did.It's still a worthy read, however.
There's the brillance of the Mackintosh writing here in place and time.
I wanted to be "WOWED" by this book, but unfortunately I wasn't. Good storyline, good writing yet it felt forced and a little stale.
3.5 It was a good thriller. Not the best but not the worst!
I can feel my heart racing just thinking of a couple of specific moments within the book.The short chapters written in italics throughout the story were rather creepy and gave me the heebie-jeebies.It would be misleading of me to say this is in any way the same as a TV mini-series I absolutely loved back in the late 1990s called Killer Net, but a couple of things about it really reminded me of it, so made it all that more exciting for me.
If you love the idea behind this book, you may wish to watch Killer Net, as I suspect you’ll enjoy it too.Crikey, what an ending to a great thriller...
Thank you to Net Galley, the publishers and to Clare the author for an ARC copy for review.Firstly, I loved Clare's first book a fantastic first novel, the second keeps to the same standard.A powerful, chilling, gripping tense thriller that keeps you guessing all the way.When Zoe Walker sees her photo in the classifieds section of a London newspaper, she is determined to find out why it's there.
Very powerful story, chilling, and gripping, like her debut author a book so powerful it stays in your head, are you being watched?Clare has done such a good job to keep up her high, no excellent standard of her first book, now cannot wait for her next book.
I would probably have liked ‘‘I See You’’ better if it were less of a commercialized novel.
Alright, so I know most books are written for some kind of gain – money – but not many actually feel that way.It’s rare for me to even think in such terms.
Unless it’s different in London, I don’t know much about that place, sadly.In this book, women are rapped then killed by men who download their information on a website and follow them around to corner them in order to proceed with their vile intentions.
It just very, very much feels like a commercialized book.Blog | Youtube | Twitter | Instagram | Google+ | Bloglovin’
So this book wasn't great but kept me turning pages and entertained. When I got towards the part to reveal who was behind this mess, the reason just didn't seem realistic at all. This was good on showing police procedure, and I did really like Kelly, the woman cop.
Routine is comforting to you. It’s familiar, reassuring. Routine makes you feel safe. Routine will kill you. A new thriller from the author of the bestseller  I Let You Go. What would you do if you discovered a photo of yourself being used to advertise a business that you'd never heard of? Zoe is flipping through the newspaper during her evening commute when she spots a photo of herself in the classifieds section. It's part of an ad for FindtheOne.com, a service she never signed up for. Zoe's f
The story alternates between Zoe Walker's personal life (first person) and PC Kelly Swift's investigation (third person), with occasional interludes from a potential stalker (second person).• Zoe is a single mom who lives with her devoted boyfriend and her two adult children.
While the lack of action in the first half did make me question whether Zoe's paranoia was warranted, the focus on the banalities of her domestic life made the story feel slow-paced.• Kelly takes an interest in the classified ads after Zoe alerts her to a possible connection to the case she's been working on.
On the investigative side, Kelly has to question her approach towards victims.
The first chapters were a bit on the rough side with too many unnecessary tangents from main character Zoe's point of view.
In fact, I wish we had a few extra chapters with Kelly as the focus as she felt a much stronger character than Zoe; Kelly's chapters had a bit more substance and mystery.
Zoe's internal thinkings slowed the book down, making it a bit monotonous in a few areas where the tension could have been ramped up.However, with that said, the tension is fantastic!
By far, it was the best part of the story and made me add another half star to my rating.
I felt the 'guilty party' was a bit over-the-top and their motivation was somewhat far-fetched, but after reading that last twist on the final page, the shock factor went up for me and things seemed to fall into place a little better.This book really made me 'think' and analyze my life and the idea of being watched.
It's one of those books that makes you worry that it could be happening in your own life.
Here's the thing about this book: it is a very strong thriller on its own, however I had such high expectations after reading Mackintosh's I Let You Go, I can't begin to compare.
So my rating is skewed a bit due to my personal experience.Clare Mackintosh is an extremely talented writer, she has crafted a fast-paced, well-developed plot.
This felt more like a police procedural rather than a thriller at times, but both aspects of the plot are extremely well-researched and thought out.
As with her first novel Clare Mackintosh manages to write a banging good psychological thriller that not only digs deep into some emotive character study but also keeps you on the edge of the seat, wondering what will happen and being surprised quite often by what does…The sounds of the underground echo through this one as an anchor, for any Londoners it will be a joy, you’ll be able to see things unfold in the minds eye – and to anyone who does not know London that well, has never experienced the joys (??) of that particular system you’ll feel like you know it well.
Zoe learns later on that other women who've also had their pictures stolen for these ads, have recently become victims of violent crimes including: theft, rape, and even murder.
Plot-wise, this story is intriguing, but I had major problems with the writing and the character development.
There is another character that is introduced in Chapter 2, Kelly Swift, an emotionally troubled but dedicated cop.
I was like, huh???I must say what did work for me were the plot twists.
It added a layer of creepiness that I didn't feel with the alternating chapters of Zoe and Kelly.
considering how much I loved her debut novel.
I wouldn't say I liked her debut novel better this one is just a very different storyline and plot from her first one.
Claire Mackintosh is extremely talented and she KNOWS how to grab you and leave you wanting more.
just thinking about being stalked and watched when you're merping around doing your thing......
you think you know someone....but DAMN............
AND Claire you delivered my lovely friend....
You have made me a definite fan of your writing and I look forward to the next novel that comes out!!!
Only Kelly, who works with the British Transport Police, seems willing to listen to Zoe.The highlight of ‘I See You’ was its atmospheric portrayal of the London Underground.
I was impressed too, with the descriptions of the police operations in the Underground and above.
I wanted more of that.Overall I found this to be pretty average for a psychological crime read.
Not what I was expecting AT ALL, from the author of ‘I Let You Go’.We get bombarded with too many details about Zoe’s dreary domestic life, her work and her daily traumas.
I think it might appeal more, if you haven’t read ‘I Let You Go’ and go into this without any expectations.
I loved Clare Mackintosh's first book and for some reason, two books later I hadn't picked up another.
I have no good reason and at this point, I'm kicking myself over it because this one was really great.
To me, what stands out about this book was the premise - there's a website that lists women's routes...now, what someone does with knowledge of where someone will be + when is entirely up to them.
Should you buy it?: Yes, i recommend picking this one up if it's something you're interested in.

I loved Clare Mackintosh's debut, I Let You Go, and was eager to read this one.
The women have no idea they are being targeted, followed, and stalked.There were times I wanted to whack the main character, Zoe, upside the head.
There were also times she did the right thing, like calling the cops, who were smart, dependable, and efficient.
There were several characters in Zoe's life who I didn't trust.The twists and turns were more like wiggles and curves, and the suspense was not severe.
All in all, it was a good book, but I liked the author's debut more.
Dear reader,You leave your house to go up work at exactly the same time each day, you sit on the same seat,in the same carriage,on the tube,walk the same path and arrive safely at your destination at the same time.
And if someone 'accidentally' bumped into you on any given day,struck up a seemingly innocent conversation the next day you happened to meet and ask if you'd like to perhaps go for dinner or a drink,you'd put such meetings down to happenstance,to pure coincidence,nothing more.
But what if your meeting was no accident?What if they were privy to your exact routine,watched you from afar and planned the whole 'accidental' meeting?
Clare Mackintosh’s debut novel I LET YOU GO was one of my favorite books last year, so I was excited to read her follow up.
When Zoe sees her photo advertising a mysterious website, she is understandably concerned.
Her concern turns to panic when she realizes other women whose photos have appeared in the same ad have become victims of terrible crimes.
Who is behind this awful site, and is she the next victim?I flew through this book quickly.
The chapters alternated between Zoe, Kelly (a cop investigating the case), and a mysterious third person.

Quite scary when you think about it.
I did the romance wee bit so I'm hoping i can find a suspense novel with some love here and there.Follow all things messy.
I loved Mackintosh's debut novel 'I Let You Go'and was thrilled to receive a copy of her newest novel. Though it was just as addicting the 'reveal' was not as climatic for me. Still very good. There were several loose ends left hanging, so I'm optimistic that Mackintosh will visit these characters again. I will continue to highly recommend these novels for a quick satisfying suspense/thriller. 4 stars.
