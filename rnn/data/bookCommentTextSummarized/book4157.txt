1,5 stars.
I am too tired of Leiris' sexually charged self-analysis to say much here. The author's intellect is on ravaging display throughout--but so is his sexism, his narcissism, his fascination with really fucked up female archetypes and the romance of self-annihilation. Insofar as being terrifically, HORRIFICALLY exposed, Leiris' book is a beautiful accomplishment. But also I am exhausted and I sort of never want to encounter this dude again.
Leiris' best book! Fascinating, sometimes very funny, and ultimately moving in its own peculiar fashion. I read this book first when I was in my early 20s, again a decade later, and now, at 42, I've read it again, and each time I've discovered new truths (and new sadnesses) in it that only my own aging could have disclosed...
A must read if you're obsessed with analysing your "self", your love life, or just enjoy a masterful autobiography.
Michel Leiris is very insightful. He Illustrates the obstructive mutation of humanity through their abstract interpretations. the corrosion of humanity, consequent to immense pressure. raw in its revelation of the perverse mind.
Une autobiographie pleine d'audace, écrite avec une "corne de taureau", plongeant dans la vérité d'un homme. A lire absolument : "De la littérature considérée comme une tauromachie" qui précède le roman en lui-même.
The author is something of a misogynist pig/ egomaniac, and I despise him. Period. Ugh. I hate this class on French autobiographies.
This one always keeps appearing to me in my thoughts. If only others were so willing to look at themselves with such stark honesty. A remarkable book this one.
