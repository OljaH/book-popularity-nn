I keep using the weird brag/justification of “Yes, I hate John Green, and no, it’s not because I haven’t read (insert The Fault in Our Stars or Looking for Alaska or Paper Towns here) yet, because yes, I’ve read all of his books, and yes, the reviews are in, and yes, it was absolutely all bad.”Except for the “the reviews are in” part.
“You’re deflecting.” I just stared at her. “You’re right that self isn’t simple, Aza. Maybe it’s not even singular. Self is a plurality, but pluralities can also be integrated, right? Think of a rainbow. It’s one arc of light, but also seven differently colored arcs of light.” This is difficult to rate. Looking back, there were definitely certain aspects that I thought were done well, but I just didn't enjoy either the story or the uber-philosophical writing. Given that I consider three stars t
“You’re right that self isn’t simple, Aza. Maybe it’s not even singular.
Unless, of course, it is yet another "deep metaphor" for the nonsensical nature of anxiety, but I would have found Aza's story far stronger without it.The ludicrous and boring plot acts as a superficial backdrop for Green to play out the usual "super precocious teens having philosophical conversations." Aza's mental illness and Green's philosophy bleed together into statements that are straddling the line between clever and nauseating:
And I think maybe deep down I am just an instrument that exists to turn oxygen into carbon dioxide, just like merely an organism in this .
It was with trepidation, then, that I wandered in to Turtles All The Way Down, thinking “yes, I’ve liked John Green books in the past, but maybe that was before I had grown tired of the same ingredients.” … NOPE.
It doesn’t ease up, it doesn’t get fixed, and at times it is nearly physically painful to read about a sad girl who can’t get better.
Pick up Turtles All The Way Down.Full disclosure: I read an early version of the book and worked with John Green and his editor, and my name is in the acknowledgments!
It's definitely my favourite YA book on mental illness that I've ever read.
What sets JG apart and makes him, IMO, a pioneer in the YA genre, is the fact that he writes knowledgable teenage characters.
(This may seem obvious, but I read a book on writing books for young readers recently and it emphasizes the fact that you have to use the most simplistic language possible so young teenage minds can understand it.
I think Aza is an especially relatable character for me with her struggles with anxiety.
Even though I just finished this book, I already know it's one that will stick with me for years to come. I can't fully express how cathartic this book was. I finally saw parts of myself represented in a novel - the parts that I was ashamed of and pretended didn't exist. This is by far my favorite John Green novel. I can't say much more about this because I'm still sobbing over it. Just read it, please.
My review is now up if you’d like to watch: https://youtu.be/T3t7Fhh2oiMI’m speechless. It’s stunning.
I'm guessing ex-convict and clown.
I'm going to guess it'll be a complex story that weaves together the lives of the ex-convict who becomes the first great poet in years, and the young circus clown who keeps having dreams of the constellation Hercules.
I think they will need to save the world from llamas.
And the romance.
One mustn't forget the romance.
All you really need to know is it will break your heart.
So, if I have guessed correctly, this book will be about a past criminal mastermind and a clown, living on the sun.
Not gonna lie, I’m tempted to flip right back to page 1 and read the book again. THAT NEVER HAPPENS TO ME.
Now, I realize that I - a 35 year old woman - am not the targeted demographic for this book, but still...There has to be at least some point to a book.Character development...a cool plot...a semi-decent romance, even...But this book?Had basically no plot.No true character development that I can see...And perhaps the most simplistic "moral of the story" I've ever seen.
So let me save you a few bucks or a trip to the library and just give you what amounts to the entire point of this book here:Ready?*drum roll**drum roll**drum roll**drum roll**drum roll**drum roll*Life Goes On.Yep, that's pretty much it.
Life.Goes.
I mean, I haven't read a "new" John Green novel in forever, but this is worth the wait.
I loved it.OK note on the title: I see a lot of people complaining about the lack of turtles and like...I'm sorry but I'M LAUGHING.
And that's freaking important ok.+ I have mixed feelings about Aza and Daisy's friendship tho...I mean, I LOVED them as friends but then Daisy (view spoiler)[said all that absolute shit about Aza and it wasn't only cruel, I don't think it was dealt with properly????
4.5 STARS I REALLY REALLY ENJOYED THIS BOOK.If I leave this review blank for now, I may force myself to film a video review (which I really want to do!) hahah
Rating 3.5   “Spirals grow infinitely small the farther you follow them inward, but they also grow infinitely large the farther you follow them out.”   Well, this is awkward.I went into this thinking I wouldn’t like it. Heck, I went into it pretty much expecting to dislike. And yes, I know that’s a horrible thing to say, and a terrible reason to read a book, but come on, you can hardly blame me.I hated The Fault in Our Stars, with all of its extremely pretentious characters (although I did cry a
And yes, I know that’s a horrible thing to say, and a terrible reason to read a book, but come on, you can hardly blame me.I hated The Fault in Our Stars, with all of its extremely pretentious characters (although I did cry at the end, and actually liked the movie).
Really, it’s about a lot of things, but more on that later.I think John Green does an excellent job at portraying Aza’s illness and the way that thoughts can sometimes control a person.
I am actually looking forward to whatever John Green writes next.Let me know what you thought!
I feel at a loss for words to describe my experience while reading this book; I've seen multiple reviews state they felt Turtles All the Way Down wasn't even on the same level as The Fault in Our Stars, and I have to agree.
I believe he was going for atmospheric, but when I think of setting the tone in a slow building way, I think of descriptive writing that can be filled with prose or not, but definitely something that draws me in and makes me feel a part of the story, and that's not what happens here.
It almost felt as if chunks of the story were missing and we were just supposed to fill it in our own way.
Edit: Well, I cannot stop thinking about this book, and it's been a few weeks, so that deserves me upping my rating to 5 stars. It has resonated with me more than I thought it would. “Your now is not your forever.” ― John Green, Turtles All the Way Down Wow. This book was stunning. Hard to read (trigger warnings for OCD and anxiety), but Jesus, did it feel healing at the same time. John Green wrote the shit out of this book.

“Your now is not your forever.” ― John Green, Turtles All the Way Down
John Green wrote the shit out of this book.
The way mental health was portrayed through Aza was excruciating, harrowing and educational to read about and it still made me feel that though the stigma might have lessened a bit, the understanding of this subject is narrow.
I was there with Aza when she was spiralling out of control, her mind constantly pulling her in different directions, finding no centre, the constant doubt hurling you further into finding no fixed point, so that you may breathe and focus.I've so much admiration for Green for writing so openly in this book.
4.4/5 Stars ⭐ ⭐ ⭐ ⭐ “You're the narrator, the protagonist, and the sidekick. You're the storyteller and the story told. You are somebody's something, but you are also your you.”GUYS GUYS! I FEEL THE FEELS I FEEL THEM! GUYS!This book this FUCKING BOOK. I devoured it in under a day! I couldn't leave it down even though I had studying to do. I was there, with Aza, feeling what she was feeling, understanding even though I don't suffer from it, wanting to "heal" her even though I know I couldn't. Thi
The other characters were brilliant, too (even though Daisy just pissed me off at times), the Star Wars references were cute, being a SW nerd myself, I relate (even though the Rey x Chewbacca parts were sort of weird) and I think he did his research a lot for this book.
6 years is a lot of time and he really produced amazing work out of them.I'm so looking forward to the movie I heard that is coming out, (a John Green book not becoming a movie would be a first) I hope they do it justice.
Click here to watch a video review of this book on my channel, From Beginning to Bookend. Turtles All the Way Down is quintessential John Green - exceedingly eloquent teens with advanced vocabularies ponder existential questions - but, much like its protagonist, the book suffers from a confused sense of identity, trying to be too many things at once. It subsequently lacks focus and offers weak emotional impact.
The first John Green book I ever read was TFIOS, which I loved.
I saw lots of people complain about an absence of plot, but some stories are more character-driven than others, as in this case.
Apart from this, there were lots of subplots that I loved - Daisy's relationship with Mychal for once, or the disappearance of Pickett Senior.The characters were fantastic.
Of course, wealth and poverty are extremely subjective topics and people hate to talk about money, but I think John Green managed to find a good balance.Find more of my books on Instagram

*sticks gold star on davis forehead*Back to us...So, reason #3 this book is the best I've read this month: the plot is so blunt and easy to follow, that it flows perfectly with whatever mood you might be in that moment.
I thought I would fall in love with this book but I just didn't.
😕Now I give all of the stars to Aza, Davis and Noah.
I loved Aza so much and as I have mental disorders I can totally relate to her.
She's a wonderful character.
Davis is her boy ish friend and he's awesome too.
Noah is his brother.
They are totally rich and their father is missing.
So this is about finding each other and finding a missing father.
I think what kept this from being a 5 star was Daisy.
She was Aza's best friend.
But at its heart is Aza Holmes, a young woman navigating daily existence within the ever-tightening spiral of her own thoughts.I feel like the only way I can accurately describe the heart of the book is by borrowing this phrase: Captures the everyday moments of teens' lives and then sets fire to those moments, heightening them until they become metaphor.“True terror isn’t being scared; it’s not having a choice in the matter.”I have so much my mind is eager to spit out, so I think a list is in order (mild spoilers ahead):• Let's start with Aza, who surprised me so much with her strong will and great depth of character.
100/10. Everybody READ THIS BOOK.
Click here for a video from my Goodreads friend Hannah and go to 7:16 - she does a great job describing how this book is many different things.
However, after finishing the book and showing the video to my wife, we agree that whether it is intentional or not, the many different directions this book goes is a great representation of the anxiety of the main character.Another thing that really raised my enjoyment of this book is that the entirety of the events take place within about 20 minutes of my house.

i loved all the intricacies, and poetic sentences, and overall warm feeling of this book.
i also really appreciate the personal side of this story and could really feel a difference with this book compared to his pervious works.
i thought this was so well done and i loved everything about it!↠ 5 stars
1.5 “John Green is definitely a miss for me” Stars “Reading someone’s poetry is like seeing them naked”  UHU. I just bumped to 2 stars because I am reading a 1-star book right now and this is not at that level. I can truly appreciate the OCD representation in Aza so yeah let's leave it at 1.5 near 2.➽ FULL REVIEW NOW POSTED. My problem was expectations. I thought I would relate, I didn’t. My problem was feeling. I thought I would feel, I couldn't. JG fans please don't throw tomatoes at me. Altho
OCD representation, yes hell yes, I am glad his book exists.
Many people could relate, many had this book piercing their heart, so yes I currently think what the hell is wrong with me.
I don’t think there is anything atrocious, I just can’t connect and I feel very much bored while reading his stories.
As a teenager, I always end up with the sensation that I am reading adults (like not only in this book, but pretty much everything John Green has written), and it bothers me.Aza: I think people who have OCD could relate a lot to her and this whole book, I just couldn’t.
"...we were looking at the same sky together, which is maybe more intimate than eye contact anyway. Anybody can look at you. It's quite rare to find someone who sees the same world you see. 3.5 stars. I haven't been the biggest fan of John Green's stories in the past because I found the characters to be too unrelatable. Like they were just trying too hard at times? But Aza's character felt super realistic and I am so impressed right now. This was honestly one of the best depictions of anxiety o
I haven't been the biggest fan of John Green's stories in the past because I found the characters to be too unrelatable.
It was incredibly raw, honest, and beautiful at times.I think everyone will relate to this on some level because the story grapples with the types of realizations we all face while growing up (so it's kind of reassuring that we're not alone in those thoughts).
The book did feel like more of a character study at times, though.
And even though I wasn't terribly into the overall story as a whole, I still really appreciated the depiction of Aza's mental health.
Aza tries to help Davis deal with his feelings of abandonment, whether he even wants his father to return, and what it will mean for him and his younger brother, Noah, since their mother died several years earlier.
Which means that I have maybe, like, no more of a soul than the bacteria do."I loved loved loved 
As someone who has struggled with depression and anxiety in my life, and struggled to describe how they make me feel, this book is definitely helpful.
I don’t have a very good relationship with John Green books, they are CLEARLY hit or miss for me (hit: TFIOS) (miss: Abundance of Katherines, Paper Towns, Let it Snow, Will Grayson x2) YOU CAN CLEARLY SEE MY DILEMMA IN PICKING UP THIS BOOKBut I was pleasantly surprised So Turtles all the way down did have the john green elements i.e. - Mental health rep- Tragic characters with tragic backstories- 16 year old philosophers (it wasn’t so bad in this book)- Hilarious best friends - The ending that l

“It's turtles all the way fucking down, Holmesy. You're trying to find the turtle at the bottom of the pile, but that's not how it works.""Because it's turtles all the way down," I said again, feeling something akin to a spiritual revelation.”  my relationship with john green is hit and miss and whether our relationship would end or continue all hinged on this book. folks, I'm pleased to say he's not cancelled yet.

Honestly, this book almost didn't feel like John Green.
It does have staple John Green aspects, but at the same time it's very thoughtful, very cohesive, and overall feels more mature.
And metaphor is actually one of the only ways to describe what having a mental illness FEELS like.
This is ownvoices representation and I think it's pretty clear how much John Green has put into putting forth an authentic and honest book about mental illness.
I really enjoyed the characters, I liked the writing and there was some lines and bits I really related to (after a good conversation you don't remember what you talked about, only how it made you feel being one of my favourites)There was also just ...
4 stars!! John Green is one of those authors that always brings the feels. Turtles All the Way Down is a book about mental illness, it’s a book about the power of lifelong friendship, and there is a bit of romance thrown in the mix (though not much).   “I would always be like this, always have this within me. There was no beating it. I would never slay the dragon, because the dragon was also me. My self and the disease were knotted together for life.”   Aza’s story isn’t the easiest to read, and
John Green is one of those authors that always brings the feels.
Aza’s story isn’t the easiest to read, and she probably won’t be a relatable character to all people.
Their friendship was actually my favorite part of this story.
I also liked Aza’s mom and the Davis story-line, even though it wasn’t the focus.
Aza’s story was one that made me think, made me feel, and spoke to me.
And it’s one of the first John Green books that didn’t make me cry LOL!
Once again, Green writes an unforgettable story with a fantastically flawed leading character.
