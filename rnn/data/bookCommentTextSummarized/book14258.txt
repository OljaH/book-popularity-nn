But you do get to choose how you react to it."Thomas Covenant, Unbeliever and white gold wielder, leper and lover, who had taught her to treasure the danger of being human.In this second book in the second Thomas Covenant trilogy, Covenant and Linden Avery travel with their Giant and Haruchai companions on a quest to find the One Tree.
Covenant believes that if he makes a new Staff of Law from this tree it will be the start of bringing back the Earthpower to the Land.
But, unlike that book, there is action (and sorrow) a-plenty in this volume.At the end, rather than feeling like it was all just "setup", we have had a serious undertaking that ends in (I won't tell you, not even with a spoiler tag.)Like book #1, this has a tighter structure to it that keeps your interest and moves the characters along.One small reminder: These books must be read in sequence.
(You could get away with skipping around in Roger Zelazny's "Amber" series and not feel completely lost or cheated.
But I would never, ever recommend that for that series!)
There is a scene where Avery outsmarts a sorcerer that sticks in my mind years later for the way different pieces came together in a dramatic showdown.This book shows more of Donaldson's world - evidencing an alternative creation story - and is more traditional fantasy adventure.
The original anti-hero, paving the way for all those who were not good by the conventional sense.
Even Thomas Covenant seems darker (if that's even possible; I mean, hell, his first reaction to The Land was to rape a 16-year-old).Anyway, The Second Chronicles are darker.
His fight with the Haruchai was probably one of the most gripping fight scenes I've read.And Pitchwife was like Foamfollower only even more endearing for his disability and un-Giantness, which made him all the more Giant-like in the end.The final novel of the trilogy made me anxious.
Not knowing there would be a third trilogy, I saw this as THE FINAL NOVEL, and I knew the story would have to be given a conclusion.
Really like this series. Great book. Exciting, keeps your interest.Thomas Covenant and Linden Avery begin their search for the One Tree that is to be the salvation of the Land. Only he could find the answer and forge a new Staff of Lawï¿½but fate decreed that the journey was to be long, the quest arduous, and quite possibly a failure....
Essentially, with Convenant out cold, out of his mind, in various ways during the novel, the One Tree is a switch in focus to Linden and her struggles with, among other things, her desire for power (to heal/to survive/to lash out) articulating her past and her guilt, the balance between peacefully passivity and violent action, and her painful love/need for Convenant.
Thomas Covenant is seeking for the One Tree to forge a new Staff of Law in order to free the Land from the clutches of the Sunbane and defeat Lord Foul.I love this book to tatters.
I'm not one hundred percent sure about what strikes me so much in this particular novel, but it just might be the fact that it's marginally lighter in tone after the ponderous, despair-ridden The Wounded Land, and contains a genuinely interesting supporting cast.
The Thomas Covenant books are great yet distressing.
Why are they great?
Because I love a never ending story.
I love to know the history of each character and how they were introduced and what they contributed to the story.
I love the generational progression.
The author pulls you in and the characters are full of exciting adventure yet despairingly negative, borderline depressing.
The writer laboriously takes you through the blow by blow account of every hill and every dell and the dispositions, emotional and physical health of each character which is also a bit laborious.
Having completed the second book in the second trilogy, I can definitely say I liked the first one better.
In the first trilogy, Thomas Covenant traveled back and forth between our world and The Land between each volume, allowing the reader to see how the war with the Despiser has progressed.
The second chronicles is all one sojourn in The Land that lacks for direction.I understand they had to sail to the isle of the Elohim in order to figure out the location of the One Tree.
I still don't entirely understand why Covenant has lost his added senses, while Linden perceives more than she wants to.
The gist, for those who want to skip the lengthy review: these three books are more action-packed and immediately engaging than the previous trilogy, and Donaldson continued to hold true to the strengths that made the first novels a pleasure to read.This trilogy was the better written, for me.
More action packed, more events-driven and easier to get into.
The horrors being wrought on the Land are a testament to Donaldson's originality, and seem worse than anything that came before.The scope of the World beyond the Land's borders is also greatly widened, introducing exotic new locales, people and races.
I might choose Lord Foul's Bane for that one, as it is the first, or White Gold Wielder (which follows the One Tree), as that might refer to more characters.Back to the story - it's a bit like Voyage of the Dawn Treader for adults; as the whole series is a bit like Lord of the Rings for realists.I thoroughly enjoyed the opportunity to read this again...Task 30.10 completed :)
The One Tree ticks along in a dramatically different vein to the previous 3 books. The Sunbane is marvellously detailed - the description of the time between The Power that Preserves and Covenant's next visit 10 years (3000 years later?!) is tackled fantastically, culminating in his explosion of wild magic mid-way through the book is unforgettable.
Re-read this as part of my preparation for the final Covenant book publication about one year from now! This is the only book of ther series that takes us outside The Land, as Thomas Covenant and Linden Avery travel by giantship in search for the mythical One Tree to form a new Staff of Law.
I picked this up right after reading the previous one (The Woudned Land). I think this one might be even better. It moved from just being a page turner to bringing in deeper themes of power, morality, and manipulation. I'm reading the next one now... we'll see how it stacks up.
And along the way Linen and Covenant, the two people from our world, learn more about what is behind the Sunbane and what can, and cannot, be done to stop it.As with the other novels, I can't be too specific without giving away too many details, but I will provide three reasons why this novel stands out as one of my favorites in the entire series.First, for reasons I can't go into here, the point-of-view character in this story is Linden Avery, rather than Covenant, for all but a handful of chapters.
In that time, Lord Foul has re-emerged from wherever Covenant sent him at the end of the first Chronicles, and is attacking the Land with the Sunbane, which send plagues of drought, flood, famine etc across The Land on an almost weekly basis.
So, he sets off across the Land with his companion, Linden Avery, a doctor who has accidentally come with him from our world, to the sea to find the Giants to help him find the One Tree to make another Staff of Law. The story then follows their quest across the seas, via the Elohim who are righteous smug bastards who know everything, won't explain anything, and take Covenant's senses so he can't do anything.
Few authors do it better than Tolkien but Donaldson does. His creates and entire fantasy world with totally fleshed out characters not least our hero Thomas who is the most unlikely hero ever. The author takes us on a journey through an incredible world during which we become totally invested in the an our new surroundings and every one within them. The books in both the first and second chronicles just keep getting better and better and it is difficult to choose a favourite. The One Tree wins by a hair.
We know, through the first 4 books, Covenant has his struggles and is often filled with self pity and struggles to overcome.
That's why we love him.
This book centers on Linden, and she brings the self pity to ridiculous heights.
Practically the entire novel is Linden in one form or another saying woe is me, poor me, I had a bad childhood so I won't contribute on the quest, I've let friends die due to my inaction so poor me I can't help my friends now.
This was a brutally painful read, sure hope the next is better or I may start rooting for Lord Foul.
I really like this series. Unfortunately, in this book the author starts repeating a phrase that I find deplorable! "There was no choice" Oh my how I dislike that phrase! There was another series that I read where the author overused it and it detracted from my enjoyment. All my grumbling aside, the introduction of other (new and interesting) characters (as well as new threats) in the Second Chronicles is refreshing.
it is not what it appears to bethe giants have agreed to take Thomas and Linden on their quest for the One Tree. there were warnings from the beginning that the quest would cost and cost dearly. the price to be paid might overwhelm them all.
I liked it when I was 17, but I want to review it again
God I hated Thomas Covenant so much. I read the whole trilogy hoping he would die! A great read! ðŸ˜ƒðŸ˜‚
See book 1 for description of all 6 books.
Gets Better and BetterSome of the best fantasy writing I've had the pleasure of reading. A s good as Tolkien and other greats, I look forward to the next book.
Cool new settings. Thomas needs to stop being a bitch.
An awful lot of journey for not very much in the end.
And in The One Tree, Donaldson actually focuses his story more on Linden Avery than Thomas Covenant.
Though some might consider it heretical, I consider Pitchwife an even better character than the Giant Saltheart Foamfollower from the first trilogy.Like the Giants, the Haruchai are better depicted in this book than anywhere else in the Covenant material (with the exception of Stave in the Last Chronicles), and definitely help strengthen TOT as well.
I understand it was only the first in the series, but the massive amounts of descriptive prologue somehow whetted my appetite for a spectacular climax that didn't happen.I know I sound too harsh on a book (I think) I gave four stars to, but my intention is only to show how much better 'The One Tree' fares w.r.t these points.It's not that The One Tree is spectacularly pacy, or full of twists - that's not what this story, or Stephen Donaldson is about.
Donaldson is in a class alone when it comes to squeezing every last melancholic drop out of a character; such considered, parsed, wrestled-with inner lives only exist on the page.
Because if there is anything Mr Donaldson loves, it is his thesaurus, and he is fearless in wielding the most unwieldy words repeatedly -sometimes on the same page.
A friend and I injected "vitriol" and "anathema" into our conversations regularly, to emulate in some small part the hot hoohaw of Donaldson's prose.
She could read the movements and mirth of the Giants passing through the decks below her; with effort she could estimate the number of people in Foodfendhall, the midship housing.
