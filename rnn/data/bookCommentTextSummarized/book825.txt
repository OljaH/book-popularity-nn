Like listening to sailors share war stories, this book is a mixture of narrative description and first hand tales of life in the merchant marine. It's interesting if you have an interest in naval history, naval combat, u-boats, etc. I've read many such books and know what to expect from them.
Somewhat interesting, but lacking vim.
