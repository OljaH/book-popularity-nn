Mason began investigating (usually involving Paul Drake) until a dead body showed up with all evidence pointing to his client being the murderer.
Mason continued the investigation while avoiding the obstacles created by his archenemy Sergeant Holcomb until the court hearing where he would finally show the truth with skillful cross-examination of witnesses.
This was quite surprising as Mason mentioned that he was partially responsible for Holcomb's departure - and I thought the two finally came to (reluctant) understanding in the previous book.
By the time Mason got involved another employee was shot with clues pointed at Mildred.
Most importantly, this is the book that finally introduces Lieutenant Tragg of Homicide, who will become Mason's principal adversary on the police force from now on.
But he's bright and determined, and Mason will have to step up his game a bit after dealing with Holcomb.This story is also a bit unique in that it takes a while for Mason to finally appear.
It's nice to finally have Lieutenant Tragg on the job and watching him and Mason match wits through the rest of the books is one of the pleasures of the series.
I'm so behindhand with my reviews. Summer madness or what?Still, very briefly, I love this Perry Mason book where Lt. Arthur Tragg gets introduced, though I missed Paul Drake.Otherwise the usual stuff: great plotting, red herrings & excitement aplenty.
***1/2.The owner of a three-unit flower shop business comes to Perry Mason with a problem.
She suddenly realizes that her business can be taken over by an unfriendly rival who has five shares in the venture.
His five shares can become a real thorn in the back if applied with evil intent.
Mason has trouble with stories that involve stocks and bonds.
Sure enough, the owner of the five shares begins to work his evil magic on the corporation and the stakes get higher and higher.
This is a better than average Perry Mason case, although there is no courtroom drama as is usual in his books.
Gostei do livro, embora não fosse tão bom como a maioria dos outros livros que li do autor.
Hardly any court scene in this one. It was a pure suspence. First one at that. Very interesting at that. Another variance is the civil proceeding at that. I don't think Mason has appeared in a civil suit in any other case.. Haven't read all. Till now, this is a first at that too.
No, but first we must discuss the cover.
A sultry but coy redhead in pool party attire, a stern male in a polo shirt crouching next to her, and a barbecue in the background.
I don't know who these people are, but they sure aren't in this book.
I think the 1962 publisher just told the illustrator, "Hey, Mason ya know, give me something hot and broody.
No need to actually read the thing."Meanwhile, back in 1940 Los Angeles, there is a lot of shenanigans going on regarding some missing stock and poisoned candy.
Instead Mason pairs up with his frenemy Lt. Tragg, of the (assumably) LAPD.
Not on, Mason.
The Perry Mason books are, in their 30s and 40a incarnation, a model of consistency, with characters that are a bit paint by numbers, clients that are always innocent of murder, and cops and district attorneys who are always wrong.
Well, finally Perry gets a series of opponents who actually stand a chance of outthinking him.
In this one, Lt Tragg, always the most formidable of Mason’s opponents, is introduced as the police Sgt who is hired to finally bring Mason to heel, and he gets a lot of time trying to solve his case at the expense of Perry’s client.
He sees that circumstantial evidence helps the detective, but he's skeptical of it in court: "Circumstantial evidence is frequently the most convincing perjuror that ever took the witness stand." Perry Mason always manages to surprise his opponent (and the reader) - the opposing counsel "sat down slowly, cautiously, as though after what had happened, it would not have surprised him if the chair had suddenly been jerked out from under him" (page 185).
Although this mystery was sometimes a bit hard to follow, things did fall into place in the end, and I couldn't help but say "oh ho ho" out loud.
I thought this Perry Mason episode was one of the better ones so far, mainly because the people and their actions seem credible.Holcomb (that jerk) is gone, and that is an improvement.
Mason's relationships with his new police adversary, Arthur Tragg, is much more nuanced.
He is a far more sophisticated police officer than Holcomb who was just a foil for the stories in which he appeared.Paul Drake is only distantly in this one, and the sexism continues, in the noir tradition.
Perry's relationship with Della continues a bit inappropriate (as in "he kissed her tenderly, then hungrily," but the book otherwise is better than than awful line.I never quite sorted out the plot, but who cares.
A pretty typical Perry Mason book in most respects, there are still a few things that make this one stand out. This is the first appearance of Tragg and Della gets some interesting stuff to do. Barely any Paul or time in the courtroom, but the changeup is welcome. Mildreth Faulkner and Esther Dilmeyer (those names!) are interesting characters and I finished the book wishing I'd gotten to see more of them. As usual for the early Perry books, especially, the lawyer isn't exactly scrupulous and his relationship with Della (including an unremarked "hungry" kiss) is bewildering.
When I found an old stash of Perry Mason books in my girlfriend's grandmother's old home, I thought I'd pick some up and be mildly entertained by the quaintness of old legal thrillers. I'm surprised by how much I ended up liking this! The plot zips along at a mile a minute, there are some relatively progressive female characters, and the book never speaks down to the reader. Sign me up for more!
Another mystery populated with genuine characters and Gardner's clear-eyed view of the power wielded by prosecutors in the U.S. This has not changed in the last 80 years. Perry Mason can be best understood as an attorney who takes on this power structure, and enjoys the fight!
I figured along the way that this one was heading in a quite different direction than it actually was, and I was thus somewhat disappointed with the way the mystery was resolved.
And of course the stock dispute was simply the tenuous tie to a mysterious murder with many a motivated suspect.
I'd rank it right up there with that one.I suspect many readers come to these books by way of the iconic television series, and I admit to seeing Raymond Burr, Barbara Hale, and Ray Collins as I read, though the description of Tragg in the book is of a much younger man than Collins.
From our vantage point, we know Tragg will prove a formidable foil to Mason, and it testified to Gardner's planning and plotting that he laid the groundwork in this initial appearance.
Enjoyable programmer - not one of the best but a respectable entry.Perry Mason series - Successful florist Mildred Faulkner finds that the flower business is no bed of roses when arch-competitor Harry Peavis secretly buys stock in her small, family-owned business.
To keep from being muscled out of her own company, Mildred goes to Perry Mason.
But the legal eagle is stymied when Mildred's company is plundered by her brother-in-law to pay off gambling debts.
The money trail leads to a nightclub hostess and her boss.
When one is poisoned and the other found dead, the trail of evidence leads back to Mildred.
Might be one of the better Perry Mason novels. The mystery itself is pretty typical of a Mason novel, but Gardner presents it better than in his earlier novels. We see things from other points of view than Masons, which helps make the plot less confusing. The other thing that makes this novel stand out is that Lt Tragg shows up, replacing Sergent Halcomb as head of homicide for the police. Tragg is much more intelligent and is a better foil to Mason, thwarting him at various steps.
Missing stock, control over business mergers, bodies galore. Things get a little too stretched out in number of players to keep it all straight. Lt. Tragg is still new to the scene and develops an interest in the female protagonist. Della continues to do whatever Perry asks, including passing bad paper. Lately, there's always someone in these books asking, "You're Mr. Mason...the lawyer?" His fame abounds.
A quite convoluted plot, but I was surprised at the who-dun-it. Perhaps the TV screenwriters were essential to get all of Gardner's set-up down to 30 minutes, so we could have a trial for the last 30 minutes. Perry really shines in his cross-examinations. The trial here is very short and on only a tangential point.
My first Perry Mason read. There is action before explanation in the book. Mason acts and then the reader understands what exactly happened. Faster than expected and the predictable end if someone has read/watched thrillers.
This book introduces Lt Tragg for the first time. He proves to be a much better adversary than Sgt Holcomb, the opponent in previous novels. His character makes for more interesting reading. Can't wait to read the next book in the series
My Rating System:* couldn't finish, ** wouldn't recommend, *** would recommend, **** would read again, ***** have read again.
Quick read. Not the most interesting, but doesn't drag.
Not sure why but was just an ok mystery. Was not able to guess or solve or anything, but didnt feel too impressed!
