5 THINGS I KNOW I learned from reading Sirens of Titan 1. Kurt Vonnegut was a brilliantly insightful GENIUS whose brain waves were ever so slightly out of phase with our universe making complete comprehension of his work by the rest of us impossible;2. In the hands of a master, literature can be both incredibly entertaining and soul-piercingly deep;3. Vonnegut had a rock hard MAD on the size of a Dyson Sphere against Organized Religion;4. Winston Niles Rumfoord is a Gigantanormous, Hobbit-blowi
The story is told by an unnamed far future historian and takes place over a 40+ year period during the “Nightmare Ages”…“sometime between the Second World War and the Third Great Depression.” The story revolves around 3 main characters are Malachi Constant, the aforementioned Winston Niles Rumfoord and Rumfoord’s wife, Beatrice.
The story begins with Malachi Constant, the richest man in the world, being granted a rare invitation to the Rumfoord Estate to witness a “materialization.” You see Winston Niles Rumfoord, while traveling between Earth and Mars with his pooch came in contact with a phenomenon called chrono-synclastic infundibulum (one of the truly remarkable concepts created by Vonnegut, but you’ll have to read for yourself).
I’m not sure if he is a fan of Kurt Vonnegut, but he should be and he should produce and direct the film adaption of Kurt Vonnegut’s novel, Sirens of Titan.
Sirens of Titan, Vonnegut’s second published novel, was released in 1959.
In fact, interestingly, aspects of several works in Vonnegut’s bibliography can be detected, including Galápagosand Slapstick or Lonesome No More!.Listen.Player Piano may have been the first book published by Kurt Vonnegut, but Sirens of Titan was the first Vonnegut book.Player Piano was an excellent story, a fine work of science fiction literature written by a man with much world experience and wisdom.
Chessplayers often prefer to hoard their ideas; it can be worth a lot to surprise your opponent in a critical game, and there are many stories about grandmasters keeping a new move in the freezer for years, or even decades.
Put them together and package the result as a 50s SF novel, and you might get something a little bit like Sirens.So, you have a naively optimistic central character, who suffers the most appalling reverses of fortune in a way that somehow ends up being more comic than tragic; but, instead of going to South America, he spends most of the book wandering around a Solar System which is very slightly more credible than Nick Park's cheese-flavored Moon.
‘the sirens of titan’ (or as i have alternatively titled it, ‘why life is the universes greatest long con’) is the perfect catalyst for my impending existential crisis - all courtesy of john!in this review, i will explore the two major themes of the novel, state what we can learn them, and explain how these lessons apply to our meager lives.
in this instance, i agree with the book, in that ‘the purpose of human life, no matter who is controlling it, is to love whoever is around to be loved.’ unfortunately for me, im painfully single.
In Kurt Vonnegut's The Sirens of Titan, we accompany Malachi Constant on adventures through time and space.
He is unlike any other hero you're likely to read about; Malachi "was a victim of a series of accidents, as are we all." The plot, which seems ridiculous and completely random (like those series of accidents), takes on visionary proportions in Vonnegut's hands.
Finally, by having our 'hero,' Malachi, as an unwitting victim of his own adventures (during a lifetime of learning and unlearning), Vonnegut approaches tragedy, but he turns away from it because that would be taking this life much too seriously.
او فهمیده، زنش و یکی از هنرپیشه های هالیوود توسط مریخیها دزدیده شده، و با هم بچه دار میشوند و ....؛ ونه گات باورهای روز دنیای غرب را، در این اثر به رشته ی نگارش درآورده؛ از عصر روشنگری، تا نظریه‌ های فیزیک کوانتوم؛ خوانش و درک طنز، و درونمایه های اثر، برای خوانشگرانی که با اسطوره های غربی آشنا نیستند، بسیار کند است، گاه خوانشگر منظور متن را درنمییابد، با اینحال اثری با چشم اندازی نو، و جهانشمول است.
This theology of the Weakness of God rejects the idea of God as the all-powerful fixer of the universe.
Its ethical import is that all of us are engaged in a search for God, and that the only help we have in this search comes from our fellow human beings.This is essentially Vonnegut's Titanic Theology.
“The two chief teachings of this religion are these: Puny man can do nothing at all to help or please God Almighty, and Luck is not the hand of God." God does not interfere in human affairs; he is what in traditional theology is called 'apathetic'.
3RD READ-THROUGH 4/18/17: Since I was about 19, I’ve been referring to this novel as my “favorite book.” I don’t know if *quite* holds that distinction still, having read a lot more in the succeeding 15 years, but it is STILL, without question one of the best!
This book might be the “plottiest” of all of Vonnegut’s novels, while I enjoy the voice later Vonnegut much more (The Sirens of Titan was only his second book) the ideas presented here are deep and varied, lying what is obviously the philosophical and spiritual groundwork for a lifetime of work to still come.
Do you read a Vonnegut book, or does the book read you?
Except that it also seizes the phrase 'to not give a damn' from your control.
The soulless slave of gravity.In between become "unstuck in time" while reading the events that led to the initiation of the formation of "The Church of God the Utterly Indifferent".
The Hindu religion does give a lot of importance to planets and their influences on your life and the reviews you write.I will abstain from asking myself these questions after a Vonnegut book in future.
Rented a, rented a tent.” — Snare Drum on Mars”That is funny until it suddenly becomes creepy, to tell you why would be a spoiler though.The Sirens of Titan is great stuff, this should come as no surprise to you if you are a Kurt Vonnegut fan, but it surprised the hell out of me.
This seems to be based on just the title.The story begins with a man named Winston Niles Rumfoord who, together with his dog, accidentally becomes “chrono-synclastic infundibulated” during a space voyage.
The magic of Vonnegut is he develops an idea to the point where -- just as you start believing it :: just as you are comfortable in his absuridty -- he kicks you down another Martian rabbit hole.
He doesn't want you sitting and enjoying yourself.
He wants you constantly bubbling with that 'da Fu?' look on your face.
He wants you to think -- goddammit.
He wants you to understand and that means he has to first confuse the hell out of you.
There are points in this book where if Vonnegut had said he was forming a church, I'd join.
If he said he expected a tithe, I'd buy another Vonnegut book.
He now regularly re-materializes as a Prophet / agent of social change, determined to bring humanity into a new Illuminated Age. Any man who would change the World in a significant way must have showmanship, a genial willingness to shed other people's blood, and a plausible new religion to introduce during the brief period of repentance and horror that usually follows bloodshed.The plot of the novel pretty much follows the above Rumsfoord script, but within these boundaries Vonnegut excells as usual in his particular brand of black humor, impassionate condemnations of the military mindset, sharp satire of religious fundamentalism (check out the new concept of handicapping the lucky ones in order to cancel out their born advantages).
Should we have chicken or fish for dinner?The story focuses on Malachi Constant, the richest man in America; Winston Niles Rumfoord, an older wealthy man who travels throughout the solar system with his dog Kazak, manifesting in various locations in space and time; Unk and Boaz, two buddies in the Martian Army preparing to invade the Earth; Beatrice Rumfoord, who is afraid of living but ends up having a troubled son named Chrono; Salo the Tralfamadorian, an alien robot stranded far from home who has more emotions than many of the human characters.The plot sounds ridiculous when written down.
So the person to whom I gave The Sirens of Titan (forever, and where has that book ended up now after its long discursive travels?), they too have disappeared, but what vague feeling was deposited in my being by having known them?
The convenient thing about books is, I can go to the library and check out The Sirens of Titan any time I wish and recover it all, live it all, feel it all again, and I will again be contained and I might know what that means.
Nope. Not for me. I enjoyed Slaughterhouse-Five so much more. This book, The Sirens of Titan was, to me, boring and just couldn't get into it. 😕

Since discovering that I love me some Vonnegut a few years ago after a humorless eighth-grade English teacher nearly kept me from ever giving him another go, I've read a not immediately dismissive number of his works.
And they've all left me in various degrees of speechless.
It can't be helped.
He delights me in the way that only a favorite writer can.
Reading Vonnegut makes me realize that there's nothing I can say that he hadn't already said better and more cleverly.
And knowing that continues to make me feel a little better about the world.
That has more than a faint whiff of colonial privilege, Salo being the first inhabitant of Titan though not native to it, who expends all his energies to improve the lot of an ungrateful, entitled newcomer.Another star off.Malachi Constant, reasonably dim, phenomenally lucky, is summoned to Rumfoord's famous reappearance after he's been chrono-synclastically infundibulated (seriously, if you're ever in a foul humor or just draggy, say or better yet type, "chrono-synclastic infundibulum." Your smile muscles will automatically activate and your crow's-feet will dance) in order to converse with the great man, though why he's so great really isn't much discussed.
Eh. Vonnegut thinks life is a bitch, and so has bitch-slapped some odd characters. Neither absurd nor insightful enough to be great. Indeed, there's something lazy about this book. And I can't be bothered to pin it down.
Vonnegut smacked them down with ridiculous, ham-fisted finality & then dragged them into their next moment of truth, only to find out it was really just a lie.It's an absurd morality tale, mildly humorous & immensely sad, that tell us there is no meaning to our lives or civilization.
Well, that's how I see it, anyway.Vonnegut's writing isn't for everyone.
My favorite book by him has always been Welcome to the Monkey House (which I just downloaded), a collection of short stories.
I just downloaded Armageddon in Retrospect, a collection of twelve new and unpublished writings on war and peace that was published a year after his death.
FERNThis fantastic quote from the fictional character Ransom K.
The story is billed as a tale from the Nightmare Ages.
The richest, most depraved man on Earth, Malachi Constant, is offered a chance to take a space journey to distant worlds.
This was told from the third person perspective of an omnipotent narrator.
I liked the themes of the story and enjoyed a lot of Vonnegut wry observations on humanity.
The story itself was OK, but nothing special.
Rating: 3.5 stars.Audio Note: This was narrated by Jay Snyder who gave an exceptional performance.
The Sirens of Titan is a rare masterwork, a novel with broad and varied powers.
It takes an unimaginably deft touch to make this overreaching jumble of tone and genre work.
It does drag a little in the exposition, but the narrator quickly commands your inquiry and the book rarely slackens its pace until the beautiful and alien finale.
No other work I've discovered has the same power of destabilization, of uprooting your resting assumptions and depicting what is and what could be.
Piercing the Veil on Religion27 January 2014 I'll start of by saying that I have read a number of Kurt Vonnegut books (five to be precise) and have a another one on my too read list (Player Piano) and of the five, three of them I have read twice (including this one) and of the remaining two, one I them I intend on reading again (Slaughterhouse Five). As a writer, a satirist, and post-modern thinker, I quite like Vonnegut's work, but for some reason the second time around I found that I simply co
As the protagonist comes to realise at the end (and the protagonist, whether it be Unk, the Space Wonderer, or Malachi Constant – I'll explain that in a bit – isn't actually searching for meaning, but rather stumbling around an absurd universe and ends up discovering the pointlessness of the universe) that the only purpose is love, and the love that he needed was around him all the time.
There’s nothing like a Kurt Vonnegut novel to show you how stupid your own species can be.Slaughterhouse Five illuminated the absurdity of war, and The Sirens of Titan does something similar with Christianity, sheathing its criticism in a fun read that is suffused with Vonnegut’s wit.Malachi Constant, ridiculously rich heir to his ridiculously (and undeservedly) rich father is a wastrel, a spendthrift and a fool who attributes his astonishingly good fortune to ‘someone up there’ liking him.As the narrative begins Malachi has no idea that he is to become a modern Job, send from calamity to calamity, forced to endure years-long trails that will see him bounced around the solar system according to the whims of a near-godlike power.This godlike power is Winston Rumfoord, a man who through contact with a strange astrophysical phenomenon floating between Earth and Mars has become distributed across space and time in a line from Earth to Betelgeuse.
I didn't care very much for the protagonist, Malachi Constant, who is the richest, most impossibly lucky man on Earth, and a degenerate wastrel.
However, if you want to redeem an incredibly wealthy, seemingly irredeemable character, the most effective way to go about it is to take away everything he has and give him amnesia, which is what Vonnegut allows to happen to poor Malachi Constant.
I now understand the affection that so many people have for Sirens, as this is the best Vonnegut I've read so far.Also, has anyone mentioned the influence that The Sirens of Titan must have had on Alan Moore's Watchmen?
I was wary of picking up Vonnegut for a long time, because even though he's such a well regarded author, his plots are so science fiction based, and I have little to no interest in science fiction.
After asking for book recommendations for my trip to Europe, my friend Amanda recommended this to me and I trust her taste, so I figured it was time for me and Vonnegut to get together.
And I am so glad that we did.As anticipated, yes, the plot was a bit ridiculous and very science fiction based, but the thing about Vonnegut is that there's so much going on outside of it that the plot almost becomes a supporting role in the entire construction.
(This is reminiscent of the Trafalmadorians of Slaughterhouse-Five—though aliens under the same name appear in this book, they don’t seem to have the same non-linear existence.) Through Rumfoord’s prophecies and Malachi’s arranged suffering, Vonnegut once more explores the tension between determinism and free will and whether we are really able to make choices at all.That last sentence sounds grand, but it actually requires a great deal of unpacking.
The non-linear way this strange story is told makes me think of a Mobius strip: I’m not sure where it really begins.Describing the story too much would be giving away the good parts, so I won’t try to go further, but I will tell you that I love Vonnegut’s slightly infantile humor, his humanist views and his disdain of corporations and organized religions.
It didn’t hit me as hard as “Breakfast of Champions” did, and it wasn’t as laugh-out-loud funny as I had anticipated (hence the rating), but in the grand scheme of Vonnegut’s work, this is an interesting and entertaining book about free will, the institutions that control our destiny without our awareness and how utterly insignificant we are when you think of how big the universe actually is.
His mind seems so strange and perfect and his books are delivery system for these wonderful ideas more than they are stories.
He is a philosopher and he wrote book long discussions of these ideas loosely framed on a story.
And I think those fantastic ideas distract from the story and that is why I find Vonnegut unique in the fact that I love him, I adore his books, but I forget so much of them.
Reasons I can't particularly explain...not because I don't want to, but because I can't.I suppose the best way is to sell this book is a quote.
This is the first one I read by Vonnegut and as it seems there will be a hell of a lot to come.
I saw all the high praises about this along with an interesting plot description and I thought "A journey from Earth to Mars to Mercury to Titan.
I was bound to find out this novel is a whole lot more than that.It certainly can be read as a fun, humorous sci-fi adventure.
Through his stereotypic characters, he makes such strong comments, that are hard to miss.The funny thing is that, hadn't I seen the comments and reviews here on Goodreads, I'd never have read it judging by the plot and the cover.
