After eight years, Hergé returned to Land of Black Gold, completing its serialisation in Belgium's Tintin magazine from September 1948 to February 1950, after which it was published in a collected volume by Casterman in 1950.
در این میان تن‌ تن راهی کشور «خمد» گشته و در پایان متوجه می‌شود دکتر مولر که در جریان جعل اسکناس در داستان جزیره سیاه نقش داشته، نه تنها در ایجاد مشکل برای شبکه نفت دست دارد، بلکه امیر بن کالش اذاب را نیز برای انعقاد قرار داد با شرکت نفتی دیگری که مولر در آن فعالیت داشته، تحت فشار قرار داده است.
Just huge fun.

Another wonderful adventure of tintin!! This used to be one of my favorite toons during my childhood!!In this adventure, tintin has got more of physical than his holmes' style!! Haddock was as usual!! Snowy has got a bit lesser role!! Thompson n Thomson are always a comic relief!! But the role of abdullah was hilarious! It will create a serious of troubles n laughters in this episode!! On the whole this can be rated as one of the best episodes of the entire adventures of tintin!!
به ترتیب که می خوانم متوجه می شوم که چند شماره ای ست که «هرژه» به پختگی مطلوبی در خلق تن تن رسیده. فرمول های تن تن تقریباً به ثبات رسیده اند ولی به هیچ عنوان خسته کننده و تکراری نشده اند. این کتاب (آلبوم) تن تن برای من بسیار عزیز و دوست داشتنی است. شوخی های بامزه هم کم ندارد.
This is my fourth Tintin comic.
Before this, I had read King Ottokar’s Sceptre, The Castafiore Emerald and The Blue Lotus and to be honest, I did not enjoy them as much as I should have.
Was starting to think maybe I should have read them at an early age.
But this one I thoroughly enjoyed (even with the deus ex machina), although I think this had to do with Thompson & Thomson getting featured more in the story than they usually do.
In any case, this book has convinced me to check out more Tintin stories.
Suurvaltapolitiikka kummittelee viidennentoista Tintti-seikkailun taustalla, jossa selvitellään räjähtävien moottorien arvoitusta aavikolla. Saksan ja Belgian kireistä suhteista ja toisen maalilmansodan syttymisen pelostahan tässä on kyse, vaikka tarinaa on vuosien varrella moneen otteeseen muokattu ja pyritty etäännyttämään todellisuudesta."Mustan kullan maan" sivuhenkilögalleria on herkullinen: mukana ovat niin pahailkinen Abdullah kuin mestarillinen tarinankertoja signor Di Olivieirakin.
Jälleen yksi Tintti-seikkailu Arabiassa. Politiikka, sisällissotia, salakuljetusta, taloudellista hyötyä sodankäynnistä jne. Dupond ja Dupont huikean hauskoja hahmoja!
#51 for 2018Genre: Adventure Comic
It's been a while since I've read comics. Thoroughly enjoyed it!
Rather a dilatory and loosely-plotted entry in the series, which to its credit the book wryly jokes about.
Captain haddock turns up out of the blue at one point to rescue Tintin, but each attempt on his part to explain the strange circumstances that brought him there in the nick of time is cut off; finally, he storms off in the penultimate panel, huffing that at any rate, the story is not going to be told by HIM now.
This book also introduces Abdullah, the extremely irritating son of a sheik, who is some plot importance but arguably the most unlikable figure in the recurring Tintin cast.
Fortunately, he has very few appearances overall in the series.
Kaikki Hergén sarjakuvat on tullut luettua lapsena, mutta esimerkiksi Tintit ovat suurimmaksi osaksi menneet yli hilseen, kun pienenä ei ole tajunnut mitään maailmanpolitiikasta. Nytpä ajattelin lukea kaikki uudelleen ja aloitin Mustan kullan maasta, joka oli valittu lähikirjaston Lähi-itä-näyttelyyn.Sarjakuvaa oli nopea lukea, ja hahmojen elävyys yllätti ja ilahdutti. Aiemmat muistoni Tinteistä (varmaan juuri lapsuuden tietämättömyyden takia) olivat hieman nihkeitä: "seikkailut" tuntuivat pitkästyttäviltä ja vaikeasti hahmottuvilta ja henkilöhahmot sekavilta. Nyt teoksen huumori avautuu aivan toisella tavalla. Erityisesti innosti se, että pystyin ymmärtämään arabiankielisiä kohtia.
Although funny, I felt this adventure is not as well developed as the previous ones... Somehow, a bit more confusing or foggy... Still, a lot of fun!Maria Carmo,Lisbon, 20 January 2015.
I wish it was called the black curse instead of Black Gold! Unlike what it might sounds, reserving oil is not the best thing that happened to the oil-rich countries!

These are one of my best books ever and I'm really in to these books!😋
very mysterious, archibald
Less engaging, largely because of the focus on the the Dupondt (who can be distinguished by their moustaches). It contains too many farces and to little of a good structure.
The beginnings of these stories have been around as long as the Lord of the Rings, the illustration and environments in the Tintin books are accurate and extremely detailed.
Anyone who has spent even a little time exploring Herge (Georges Remi) can see the painstaking research and adversity he worked through to compose the world around Tintin.
His ideas were ahead of his time (Exploring the moon, Industrialization, South American political conflict, modern slave trade, extraterrestrial life) and he made certain every detail for every object would be realistic (after the third book at least).
Herge's work can certainly be cited as an influence for any modern day graphic novel or comic book.
Another Tintin adventure that is full of laughter-inducing scenes, Herge takes Tintin on a James Bond-like adventure as he confronts a previous enemy involved in the contamination and sabotage of oil in an effort to start another world war. Captain Haddock, the Thompson twins, and the outrageously obnoxious Abdullah are again sources of antics that can leave you in stitches.
Not the best of the Tintin series, but a good work all the same.
Dating from the late 30s, has a strong sense of impending war and the role of oil in fuelling conflict. Plus ça change.
J'aime, j'aime, j'aime!
An awkwardly rehashed version of the story, to avoid political exposure...
Another classic Tintin by one of my favourite authors Herge. I love the humour that Thompson and Thomson brought to this story in particular.
A fond memory.... Mme Castafiore!!
Another good adventure - and while it's not one of the best, I still think it's worth it just to see Thompson and Tompson's crazy transformation :D
The Book Harry Potter and The Philosopher’s Stone is by J.K Rowling and it is a fantasy/magic/adventure/Mystery.
He hates his life and trying to get away from all these mysterious letters they go on an island where a big hairy man confronts them and tells harry he is a wizard and goes to hogwarts to study magic.
The general plot is Harry going after this stone that is supposed to be magical in hogwarts.
It is the best magical book that I have read ever and I would suggest it to 9 to any age above that for it is not that hard to read but still the plot is quite challenging to understand.
This wasn't the best Tintin comic by any stretch but it did have some good qualities.
First of all, this volume probably had the most realistic setting in the series so far.
(an interesting side note is that I read that Herge was criticized for not having many female characters in the series and when they do appear, have annoying traits) Having said all that, wasn't the most visually exciting or even artistic of the volumes.
The story didn't leave me super excited and it seems like this one was a stand alone volume.
