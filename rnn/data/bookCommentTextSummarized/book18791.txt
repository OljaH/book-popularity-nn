3.5 starsWhat kind of dimwit would decide to backpack the Pacific Crest Trail alone with zero backpacking experience?
Apparently the same kind of dimwit who would try heroin just because the stranger she spent the night with happens to need a fix.If you can tolerate essence of dingbat and overlook her lousy choices and even lousier excuses for those choices, this is actually an enjoyable read.
And if you have any backpacking stories of your own, you'll connect with so many of the little things that define the worldwide community of backpackers.
I finished this book a couple of days ago, and have not been able to get it out of my mind.
If you want to read about a well planned trip by a prepared hiker who has no issues, go and buy a guide book about hiking the Pacific Crest Trail.
I loved every moment of this book and am just blown away by the author's audacity and courage.
I will probably never be able to go three months in the wild, but I sure loved living vicariously through Cheryl in her 'Wild.'
A self-absorbed, ill-prepared woman, 26 years old, leaves her husband (a decent guy) for no good reason, mucks her life up even further with drugs and reckless sex, then engages in some vacuous navel-gazing on the Pacific Crest Trail. As a woman hiking alone she gets all kinds of special treatment and help from fellow hikers. She loses a few pounds, gets some muscles and some sun-bleached hair and calls her work done.
Cheryl Strayed's life doesn't, so far, have an unusual amount of sadness or tragedy or inspiring moments -- the kind of things that make for good memoir reading.
Once she actually gets the high of hiking (under the weight of a pack HALF HER BODY WEIGHT, for god's sake) the book becomes Mary Sue Goes on a Nature Walk.Everybody -- yes, literally everybody except the gay guy and a couple of women wants to have sex with her.
And what a rip-off, since readers are buying this book expecting to read about the experience of walking the PCT.
I have read a great many criticisms of this book by people who either expected it to be solely about the PCT itself, or were offended by the author's use of coarse language and discussion of her sexual proclivities.
A longtime lover of the PCT, I already know about the trail from end to end.
But every step of the way you're alongside her, watching as she learns to accept, to embrace, to let go, and how the PCT weaves through that.This is a book I will most definitely read multiple times over the years.
I know what Cheryl felt like on the Pacific Crest Trail because I felt like that reading her book.
[Warning: Spoilers] Wahhh, I did heroin and cheated on my husband and my life's a mess.
Wahhh I'm too tired to even masturbate.
Had sex anywayz.
B.T.DUBS I like sex!?!
Seriously: she had this problem with sleeping around with men and toward the end of her trek she's STILL sleeping with strangers.
It's fitting that she had a hard time reading a real compass because her moral compass was also off-kilter.
Should have read about Bill Bryson's trek across the Appalachian Trail instead.
“The universe, I'd learned, was never, ever kidding. It would take whatever it wanted and it would never give it back.” Wild is easily one of the best memoirs I've ever read. For two main reasons.1) It is extremely well-written. This book doesn't have that feeling which non-fiction books often give me - a feeling that I'm stuck in the dreary real world and that I should have read some exciting fiction instead. It reads like a novel. A novel about grief, and youth, and adventure. It's full of me
It reads like a novel.
It's one thing to feel a certain way at times in your life, but it's another thing entirely to be able to find the words to accurately portray how that felt to others.Her story is brimming with raw, visceral emotion.
And yet, I have never been more certain of anything than her unconditional love and her desire for my happiness.Strayed's shared emotions pulled out some deep ones of my own.Beyond the emotional pull of the novel, it is an adventure story that takes us through all the highs and lows of the wilderness.
Alternate title: How to be a Compete Idiot: Hiking Edition Cheryl goes off on a bender shortly after her mother passes.
Yes, you read that right.She gets on the Pacific Crest Trail as a way to find herself.
Many, many inspirational quotes have been posted and shared throughout the web thus I will share the two that stood out to me most:The first one is found during her mother's stay in the hospital and requests for morphine from the male nurse.
Frequently, Cheryl paused the narrative to admire masculine men that she met on the trail or remembered screwing with while married to her husband.
I had never been a big HATCHET fan myself (I preferred the Little House books, if you wanted to get right down to it), but reading it with this kid gave me a new appreciation for what the book allowed us both to do: live in the terrifying wilderness, live in the terrifying aloneness, live in the brave and cold and the that which seems both impossible and necessary.
Everything painful is written about with warmth and something I just, I don't know if I have a good word for it?
They are not impossible and far away and only written about in memoirs where people do incredible things.
Unpreparedness for the Pacific Crest Trail, risky decisions and miscalculations, as well as reckless living - poor choices in coping with a broken life.
Her mother died in her mid-forties and the threads of what little family Cheryl had disintegrated.
Married to a perfectly good man, but wed very young, in her grief, she eventually resorted to heroine abuse and promiscuity.
It is not a self-help book.
There comes a point in everyone's life when we have to forgive our own mistakes and accept how they define us.
The struggles along the trail gave her the strength and clarity to face who she really is and what she is capable of.
So far, a great read. It's Eat, Pray, Love without all the whining.
Re-Read on Audio 2017 ~ Just going to tweek my old review as I still feel the same about the book and movie.
Of course there are different things in the book than in the movie, but that just made it better, it was liked I was learning more about Cheryl's life.
I want to get books on it and read about it.
I want to see in a book the actual places that Cheryl was in the book.
Cheryl found out a lot of things about herself while on the trail.
If nothing else, those boots end up being a fine advertisement for REI’s amazing customer service.
While I’m happy she survived, her early hiking tales scared me.
Like her backpack, there’s so much personal drama to unload.
If you’re simply looking for tales of adventure on the PCT, you’re going to be disappointed.
The PCT is only the backdrop and therapist to all that personal drama.
Thank heavens, by the end of the trip, she’s unloaded and discarded a lot of the figurative and literal baggage.
Backpacking really is magic like that, if the excess weight doesn’t fling you over the edge first.
This author is the columnist who writes Dear Sugar?
Instead of focusing on how lucky she was to have ever had a mother who poured an infinite amount of unconditional love into her, she instead imploded, lost in her own self indulgence.
I haven't finished the book yet, but given that it was written about a journey that happened in 1995, I'm guessing that between 1995 and 2012, the author has grown up and endured even more, resulting in the wisdom that is Sugar today.
I guess I'm more accustomed to grittier and more desperate tales of endurance and transformation.p.s. I did end up finishing the book.
A memoir written by a woman who loses her mother and then promptly takes up heroin and cheating on her sweet husband (who she loves very much).
I figured nothing to relate to here: the loss of a parent, the drugs, the cheating, and any and all hiking/camping/roughing it…these are all completely foreign to me and also things I'd like to avoid.
Thus she is quite likeable even as you’re thinking “you’re an idiot!” It’s amazing she did this hike.
The fact she was a woman, alone, hiking for all those weeks is astounding.
A world that measured two feet wide and 2,663 miles long. A world called the Pacific Crest Trail. Cheryl's mother- who she was close with, comes down with cancer. She goes through losing her mom very fast. It seemed like one minute was the diagnosis and the next she was gone. She felt like a part of her soul was torn away.The amount she loved us was beyond her reach. It could not be quantified or contained. It was the ten thousand named things in the Tao Te Ching's universe and then ten thousand
She decides to hike the Pacific Trail with the thoughts that maybe she would get back that girl she used to be.I have seen several review that slam her for taking off on a trail with an over-packed backpack and little knowledge of what she was doing.
His book focused more on experiences of the actual hike though and not about just looking at cute guys on the trail and thinking about how horny she was.
Little "quotables" of her theory of life felt thrown throughout the book and at first I liked them but then it became too much.
The memoir basically could be summed up like this:My mother died.
I love my mother.
I love my ex-husband.
Hate and love her.
I was nothing to them and they were everything to me." "I walked through the spider webs, feeling them like magic on my face, pulling them out of my hair." P.S. Eating a loved one's remains will not ensure that they will remain with you forever.
--------------------------------------------------------Favorite Quote: N/A.First Sentence: The trees were tall, but I was taller, standing above them on a steep mountain slope in northern California.
I started with the movie, but became bored.
So I switched to the book, thinking it might be more gripping or eventful perhaps.
It’s at times impactful, at times redundant, but definitely a better ‘‘self-discovery’’ book than Eat, Pray, Love.
Good, but I would have liked it more if I had been able to connect to Cheryl, that’s for sure, and if I had felt the emotions going through her myself.
Also, not sure I like how Cheryl says she doesn’t know if she would have found herself if she wouldn’t have crossed paths with a certain man.
It's a breath-catching moment that relates to what she's been writing and means everything to her, and she delivers that everything right on the page, in actually just a few lines.WELL THEN little did I know that immediately next up is Lady The Horse, and I would soon be dead from crying.
But I was surprised that there is actually a lot of more literal identity crises in the story, not so much of finding where she fits as finding she's not even on the side of the line she thinks she's on.
The wilderness walk was born out of grief — her mother had died suddenly of cancer, and Cheryl was feeling lost.
She also felt regret over mean things she had said to her mother, and she was angry that her mom had died so young.
I highly recommend this book to those who like outdoor adventures or who appreciate grief memoirs.Favorite Quotes"Now that she was dying, I knew everything.
Until she was dying, the thought had never entered my mind.
What if what made me do all those things everyone thought I shouldn't have done was what also had got me here?
This was definitely an interesting story and uplifting, and every time I had free time, I was very eager to continue this!The reason I counted off one star is because she would sometimes go into veeeery extended stories about her life before the trail, which I understand is relevant to why she felt motivated to hike the trail, but at times, the information felt extraneous.
This was definitely an interesting read with a great message about self-discovery and resilience that also has its moments of friendship and humor.
ترجمهی این کتاب تجربهی خیلی عجیبی بود. کتابی که با خوندن همون فصل اول، دو کتاب دیگهای رو که توی لیست ترجمه داشتم کنار گذاشتم. همراه شدن با شِرِل برام تجربهی متفاوتی بود. قلمش خاص بود و خب کمی ترجمه رو برام سخت کرد؛ نویسنده ليسانس ادبيات انگلیسیِ و اصطلاحهایی توى کتاب وجود داره که مخصوص خودشه و فكر كنم يكى از دلايلى كه علىرغم شهرتش ترجمه نشده، همين بوده! ريسك بزرگى كردم بههرحال😁 اميدوارم تونسته باشم اون فضاى جذاب و عجيب ذهنش رو منتقل كنم و کمبودهاش رو هم نادیده بگیرین. حدود ۲۰ تا از مصاحبههاش رو
ترجمه‌ی این کتاب تجربه‌ی خیلی عجیبی بود.
حدود ۲۰ تا از مصاحبه‌هاش رو دیدم و خوندم و تا حد توانم سعی کردم به سبک متن وفادار باشم و درعین‌حال متن هم روان باشه.گاهى اين‌قدر با شِرِل همراه مى‌شدم كه شب‌ها كابوس مى‌دیدم؛ خودم رو تو بيابون احساس می‌کردم و من هم مار و جونورايى رو كه شِرِل باهاشون مواجه شده بود می‌دیدم.
رابطه و احساس شِرِل به مادرش برای من خیلی قابل‌درک بود.
باوجود حماقت‌هاش، دلم برای عشق عجیبی که نسبت به مادرش داشت، می‌سوخت؛ عشقى كه واقعا برام جذاب و قشنگه.
I recently listened to the audio of Tiny Beautiful Things: Advice on Love and Life from Dear Sugar, which I loved and which made me think that Cheryl Strayed has a special kind of wisdom.
It made me think that I should read Wild, which is also by Cheryl Strayed.
For the longest time, despite many encouraging recommendations, I had been hesitant to read Wild because how could a story about a 1000+ mile trek possibly be interesting?
But this is a minor complaint, Strayed’s honesty and wisdom resonate with me, and I will happily read her next foray into non-fiction – or even fiction.A note on the audio: Strayed does not read Wild whereas she does read Tiny Beautiful Things.
Strayed's ego manages to outsize even the magnificent Pacific Crest Trail.
Strayed never tires of relating the unending river of compliments she receives about her beauty and sexiness.
That obvious lie makes me wonder about the veracity of the rest of her tale (except her stunning beauty, of course).She appears to think she's somehow developed spiritually or emotionally by the book's close, but it's unclear how.
She seems like just as much of a thoughtless ass as she did on page one.She writes eloquently and there must some truth throughout, for why would someone fabricate a story that makes herself look like such a dick?
In her grief she has a.) not done the final work necessary to get her degree, b.) cheated on her sweet husband with multiple men, c.) as a result of (b) has gotten a divorce, d.) has a kind-of boyfriend named Joe who introduces her to heroin.After all this, Cheryl feels like she needs to get her head right.
She alternates between telling what's happening on the Trail and what happened to her in the past (her mom's death, her family's disbanding, her father's abandonment, her stepfather's abandonment, her divorce, her abortion, her drug use, her mindless affairs with men she has no feelings for, etc.).
There are others.I read this book despite all these things, and because I have never been steered wrong by Cheryl before (we're friends, and I've read most of her public writing, including about half of her Dear Sugar columns).
I read this book hoping to be proven right in my faith in her and wrong in my worry it would not go well, this struggle-against-the-wilderness, this wisdom-discovery.Indeed.
Very probably, if I did not know Cheryl I would find quibbles enough with this book to knock my five stars down to four.
Because I was a terrible employee who loved books too much to work in an environment in which I was surrounded by them, I used to hunch in the corner of the biography section and read small snippets of it; I was never caught, but it was Christmastime and my mother was asking without relent, "What do you want for Christmas?
If I were to lose my mother in two years time, I know my life would absolutely shatter.What the fuck is wrong with me?
One story is Cheryl's 90+ day 1100 mile solo hike of the Pacific Crest Trail when she was 26 years old.
The other story is of the tragic death of Cheryl's mother from lung cancer four years previously.
Even though it was the death of her mother which precipitated Cheryl's decision to solo hike the PCT, I felt like the two stories are so very different from each other that it just doesn't work to have both accounts in the same book.
These sections are at odds however, with Cheryl's account of her selfish, self-destructive behavior after her mother's death.
No … wait … … not two months … either - the year turned into t..h..i..r..t..y f..o..u..r d..a..y..s. Not even five weeks but thirty four days of hope then pain then fear then pain then dread then final admittance leaving the handmade cabin in the wilderness that when they moved in didn’t have electricity or running water or a phone or an indoor toilet or even a single room with a door and just a few years after adding and improving and making what was still not much of a house but was a HOME, when her mother walks out the door for that final admission says ”Bye, darlings,” to the dogs, and “bye, house,” to the house and then follows her daughter Cheryl out the door to the car for that last ride.
I was interested that toward the end of her journey, she realised that ending the trek scared her as much as when she was setting out - she learned so much and began to feel normal on the road, solo.
I think a lot of Cheryl's feeling lost, thus steering out on this amazing adventure to seek clarity, is because of her dysfunctional family situation, and her utter helplessness after losing her beloved mum.
Cheryl lost her way but certainly found it again, and I'm so happy for her.
