The research contained in this book has been cited by Ben Bernanke and Christina Romer, two of the most knowledgeable experts on the Great Depression, as some of the best empirical work in economics, yet it's rated 3.97 stars. That makes no sense.
I probably only understood 50-60% of what they were talking about in this book, but since it is considered one of the seminal achievements in economics in the 20th Century, I guess I don't feel I have the right to give it a bad rating.
Whew - can only read this one in chunks. Good info though.Finished ch. 4 - Am now past the 1907 financial crisis.Finished ch. 5 - Creation of the Federal Reserve System and post WWI crisis.
"A Monetary History of the United States, 1867-1960 by Milton Friedman (1971)"
Dry reading but good information.
The indispensable reference for historical data and commentary on the US monetary system in the context of economic history from the civil war until 1960.
Friedman is without a doubt one of the most dry authors out there. His writing style leaves much to be desired. Also, when you read his works, you get the impression that he is NOT a man of faith. I don’t know this for certain, but I walk away from his books with a feeling of deep spiritual foreboding. I’d recommend that Bible-believing Christians avoid this book.
A history of economics. Well researched and informative, but a dry read.
