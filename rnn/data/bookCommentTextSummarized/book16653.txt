Moments of the supernatural and plot aside, it's this subject that draws me to the book.For reasons I can't fully explain, I've read the first 200 pages of this one half a dozen times over the years but never finished it.
I'm glad I've decided to finally and fully experience the book in just this way.King himself read the the next two stories in the book.
I can see, however, that someone whose only reason for reading King is action/horror excitement may not find much of value in a book that's mostly composed of nostalgia and a look back at the turning points that shaped us as people.
I really felt like this is one of King's best collections. The film version of HEARTS IN ATLANTIS was also excellent. A great group of narratives...this is one of my favorite King books.
My favorite üíúüíú'
‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜBefore you go casting aspersions on this review, please note that I'm not a big fan of these short story collections, and I only read this for the Dark Tower tie-ins, which the first story delivered in spades.In Wolves of the Calla, Father Callahan shared some of his story with our ka-tet. Part of which involved his travels down highways in hiding, and the relentless pursuit of his trail by the Low Men in Yellow Coats. So I was eager to learn more about these mystery men through the first s
So I was eager to learn more about these mystery men through the first story in this collection.
‚ô´Such an awesome little tale, which drew back the curtains on those Low Men. Easy 4+ stars.Next, we fast forward to 1966 for the titular story Hearts in Atlantis with the addition of some funny new characters.
This story fell to a low 3 stars, for me.The last three stories are all extremely short in comparison to the first two, and, excluding a couple of scenes with minor Dark Tower relevance, there's nothing too noteworthy.
The Novella Low Men in Yellow Coats begins our interlocking string that winds through the rest of the book; including all the characters that will appear in the rest of the stories with a tale of children coming of age--Bobby Garfield, with friends Carol Gerber and John "sully" Sullivan playing the biggest roles, dealing with bullies, then a touch of the supernatural when an interesting older man rents the room upstairs in Bobby's house; Ted Brautigan.
This was a look into the hearts of man (and woman).Interestingly enough, I started out in the first story being entertained in the fantasy of a tale that not only took me back to a time of my childhood but was also connected to King's Dark Tower series, a series I consider a masterpiece.
King's mastery in weaving a tale really begins when he introduces William Golding's Lord of the Flies as the book that Ted gives young Bobby to read.
But does it even matter when the totality adds up to something that held me totally enthralled from start to finish.The parts are made up of two novella length tales, two short stories and an epilogue that seeks to tie up loose ends.
In the two short stories that follow we meet up two Vietnam War veterans.
This is really a continuance to or closure of the first story in the book.I listened to an audio version which was read by a combination of actor William Hurt and the author.
If I could give six stars to this book, I would. And seven. And eight...And nine. And ten...
I love Ted Brautigan's character, and seeing him in his little "vacation" to Connecticut is always interesting - but definitely more so now that I know where, and to what, he's taken by the Low Men in the yellow coats.
I like Ted's interaction with Bobby, and I like the way that the story kind of feels like a nightmare that's just getting going - shifting between confusion and horror (Liz's experience, the Low Men, etc), and normal summer reality for an 11 year old.
She made it work, and so, while I do appreciate that Liz was in a hard spot and I could understand her miserly ways - I could only feel sorry for her to a point.
Sometimes I think it would be better if we died when they did, but we don't."Hearts in Atlantis is quite an unusual book is that it is comprised of 5 interlinking stories (technically 2 novellas and 3 short stories) that contain the same recurring characters and take place chronologically.
This story contains amazing Dark Tower references and connections, and as a DT junkie, this was SOOO exciting.The next novella was the self-titled Hearts in Atlantis, which focuses on the story of Peter Riley, who gets addicted to playing the card game Hearts in the dorm when he is a student at the University of Maine.

It was one of the Stephen King books i was less bothered about reading because of a very stupid reason: the Anthony Hopkins film.
Turns out the book is one of the best Stephen Kings I've read.
I guess it's a coming of age story with a couple of links to story one.
The other stories are a lot shorter but are more heavily linked to story one.
I've read a couple of reviews that comment on the loose links between each story but i would have to disagree.
Who cares if it isn't a horror story, Stephen King is just a great story teller.
I definitely enjoyed this collection of stories more on my second read through but Hearts in Atlantis still remains on the bottom of the list of King story collections for me.
I just don't find myself wowed by these like I normally do with his work and found them a bit too slow paced.
One thing I particularly enjoyed about this collection was how each story had a common thread and we got to see the same characters throughout, just at different ages and in different situations.
I also really enjoyed the characters in Hearts in Atlantis, they were each so well developed and just so captivating!
I don‚Äôt recall exactly how long it took me to read the book, but it couldn‚Äôt have been more than two and a half days because that‚Äôs when we had to leave this one-horse-town and the novel was finished by then with time to spare.
My initial skepticism about Stephen King quickly turned into fascination, almost euphoria and I just couldn‚Äôt stop reading (talking addiction here).
In hindsight it turned out that this was a very good starting point into the universe of Stephen King.Now that I read each and every novel and short-story-collection by Uncle Steve I realize how closely connected they all are.

But as much as the sixties were about peace and love on the home front, there was as much disorder and harm created by the movement.Certainly, we can interpret the demise of John Sullivan as the death of the Age of Aquarius as he is bombarded with household furnishings and other possessions that the Baby Boomers sought to acquire as they grew up and abandoned their ideals.As much as Ray Bradbury chronicled pre-depression America with his tales of Greentown, IL, Stephen King is a chronicler of his generation with books such as this and It which masks a tale of growing up American in the 1950s with a horror story.
4.5 estrellas.Corazones en la Atl√°ntida es esa clase de obra que cuando la termin√°s, result√°s una persona diferente a la que eras cuando la empezaste.
A veces pienso que ser√≠a mejor si muri√©ramos cuando lo hacen, pero no lo hacemos.Este es uno de los libros de King que m√°s me gustaron.
Algunas se pueden tornar un poco pesadas en ocasiones, sin embargo, King me cautiv√≥ con lo que transmite cada una.
Los cinco relatos componen una cadena que ten√©s que seguir para saber hasta d√≥nde te llevar√°.
Llega a un libro como llegar√≠as a una tierra inexplorada.
Sin un mapa.
I must say I was stunned when the connection was made to a series of the author's other books and for a split second thought to myself that "if this theme can be this good, do I have another 4,500 or so pages to add to the plan?".
Felt that for a full 10 pages that is, and then I was lost again.The last 3 stories are shorter, but carries the suspense superbly.
The book or stories never lost focus I felt and all in all, this sailed high up on the list of the great man's many great books.
No one would claim that King is Shakespear.
That being said, SK has crafted stories like "The Body" and "Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption" in such a way that to dismiss the people within them or describe them as simply "characters" is somehow lacking.
"Low Men in Yellow Coats" although referential to King's SF Gunslinger series is easily a stand alone.
Bobby and Ted are drawn so expertly, so deftly, that as I read this book, I felt as though I was listening, rather than reading...being pulled into the circumstances.
I was so emotionally connected with Bobby and Ted, even Bobby's mother, that each reading was like visiting with and sharing the sadness of a friend.

This collection of novellas and short stories all intertwine into one lump story that I'll refer to as The Vietnam Story.
SK was extremely anti-Vietnam War and it shows in these stories.
Overall I gave the collection 3 1/2 stars.
Thought it was very confusing and I hated the character.
2 StarsWhy We're in Vietnam- the saddest story of the collection.
4 StarsHeavenly Shades of Night Are Falling- I felt this story was an afterthought, just added to tie up loose ends with characters from all of the stories.
Very little supernatural elements with the exception of the first story "Low Men In Yellow Coats" which is part of King's "Dark Tower" universe.
"Hearts in Atlantis" is more of a look at King's generation (the babyboomers/sixties) and how they haven't lived up to the expectations that they had for themselves and what others had for them.
Hearts is a dramatic bittersweet book laced with nostalgia and melancholic elements.
I think that it simply shows that Mr. King believes his generation had a lot of potential and could/should have been more.
"Hearts in Atlantis" is an accomplishment for Mr. King.
Outstanding Low Men in Yellow Coats - 5/5 I loved Bobby and Teds relationship!Hearts in Atlantis - 3/5I was less keen on Peter and co.Blind Willie - 2/5Didn't care much for this at all.
Willie was a low character as a teen in the first tale so why would be be any better as an adult I guess.Why we were in Vietnam - 2/5I enjoyed learning about how what the no longer kids got up to in 'nam but the ending was too weird?Heavenly Shades of Night are Falling - 4/5Bobby and Carol.
Brought tears to my eyes!
I'm such a softie!
The first story, "Low Men in Yellow Coats" (at 250 pages, about half the book), contains some of King's finest writing, with sensitive portrayals of children (of course), but also women.
A single working mother, struggling to make ends meet, while at the same time dealing with (extreme) sexism in her workplace and her own anger issues, is to my mind one of King's greatest fictional creations.
That's probably a cruel question since King has certainly signaled time and again his imaginative investment in the Dark Tower.
As a Stephen King fan, I am surprised to be writing a review like this on one of his books.
It was a very wise decision either on Mr. King's part or the Publishers part to put that at the beginning of the book.
I gave up on it a little more than half into the book at about 360 pages.
I didn't understand the plot, nor the whole point of the story as to where it was leading to.
i didn't even read on into the third story of the book because at this point I was bored out of my mind.
What can I say about this novel?
First and foremost I would say that this is not what we know as the typical Stephen King novel.
The book is 4 inter-related stories that deal with the 60's and the Vietnam war.
Outside of the Dark Tower tie-in and the Low Men in Yellow Coats, the emphasis here isn't on the supernatual.
While not altogether necessary, I found that my experience of this book was further enriched by reading Golding's 'Lord of the Flies' years ago.
This book is mentioned many times throughout all 4 stories and serves as a chilling comparison if not a metaphor.
This book is very special.
It's a collection of stories, and the themes seem to be the mystery of how life changes as you get older, how experiences change us and make us into who we become.
A film adaption was made.
The film made me cry.
It's based on the first short story, which is also a tie in with the Dark Tower series.
An old man meets a boy and they become friends.
The old man is one of the "breakers" in the last books and he has escaped.
It's very beautiful, very special to me.
Amazing. Second time was much better than the first. Full of beautiful passages about time, loss, regret, redemption. I really can't describe it. I can only say that it certainly might be King's masterpiece.
(I had world history in my high school and there were a chapter or two about Vietnam, first French colonization then hard on heel came U.S. so I had a gist of the plot and that made this book even more interesting than it'd have been if I knew nothing about the war.)"More than one, people are like diamonds in that way, Bobby.
This was my first read but no matter how many time I read this book, I'll never get bored and my favorite character'll not change."Anything with the power to make you laugh over thirty years later isn't a waste of time.
