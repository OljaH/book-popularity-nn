Sure, rereading the manga (now that it's being rereleased for a new generation of fans to adore) may make me want to deconstruct everything, pick apart the plot, and try to mash it into the logic of my "more mature" brain...but then I would be tainting the memories of the series and characters I have loved since childhood.
So much nostalgia omg <3
When I was a wee little child, Sailor Moon was my absolute favourite show of ever, I never missed an episode!
But I recently realized - Sailor Moon is a book to tv adaptations..
And don't I believe in reading the book as well as watching the adaptation?!
Basically, I loved this and now know that I need to get more invested into the Manga world because they are so fun to read..
As well as picking up the rest of the Sailor Moon series!
¡REVIVIR MI INFANCIA!Todo este manga no solo cuenta una historia poderosa sobre amistad y amor sino que además es fuente de girl power y no hay con que darle, es increible. La nostalgia es un gran factor para mi por lo que no estaría siendo muy objetiva, pero a quien le importa. ¡Amo Sailor Moon!
.... Tuxedo Mask is hot.
4/5 estrellas.Casi 23 años y por primera vez en mi vida leí Sailor Moon, y me encantó 😭💖Qué mágico todo. Ahora comprendo la obsesión de tantas personas aidjsnfak ¡definitivamente tengo que seguir con este manga! 😍✨
First book of the booktubeathon extended edition is complete!!I loved the anime as a kid (though I remember nothing of it) so this is nice to be reading! Thank you Ashlynn for getting me this!!I had one major issue and it's the artwork. I find it a huge mess. Too much on a page. I like simple, this is overdone and there's just too much going on. But I can ignore it and enjoy the story and dang I wish I had more of the volumes!!
Vamos para 22 años de obsesión, sin miras a que esto cambie jamás ❤El principio de la historia siempre me pareció lo más floji, así que me reservo las 5 estrellas para los demás tomos
✨🌙✨
Primer manga leído en su formato en papel.Por lo que esto es técnicamente un reread aunque la primera vez haya leído los tomos antiguos.
No es fácil para una principiante como yo leer mangas así que esta vez, estoy leyendo más fluidamente, y eso es un gran logro para mí.
Creo que Naoko es una genio, así que a la distancia le doy las gracias por esta maravillosa historia (￣ε(#￣)︴Este manga (y anime) pasó a ser uno de mis preferifos y gracias a ello, he encontrado a gente maravillosa con la misma pasión que tengo yo por él.
This makes me so happy.
BUT I WANT MORE. THE OBSESSION FROM MY CHILDHOOD HAS BEGUN AGAIN.
First, before you do anything else, go and listen to this.Good, now we can begin all proper and such. I feel like this should be a review in two parts. The nostalgia from my early childhood and the reality of the volume itself.  Part ONE: Back in the days long, long before I knew what anime or manga were, I was but a baby. A baby that really liked watching cartoons. Sailor Moon was a show that I would catch on TV every so often, during the days before I had to attend kindergarten. Sailor Moon wa
Sailor Moon was paired with Cardcaptor Sakura, Volume 1 and I remember sitting right up in front of my TV to watch these magical girls in pretty dresses dance and play.
But that show still played a bit of an role in my life, from strange dreams to odd doodles, Sailor Moon characters kept popping up even if I no longer remembered where they were from or what their names were.
For years I didn't know if these characters were from something I had seen or a combination of things in my own strange imagination.It wasn't till I was in my early teens that I started watching anime again.
This is the first time I've read the Sailor Moon manga.
As an adult, I hold it in great appreciation, and it earns a permanent place in my girl power-loving heart.So what to say about the newly translated and uncut manga Vol 1 edition?
Then she reluctantly but surely acts like a guardian should, and even her cat mentor Luna is impressed with her.I never really liked Tuxedo Mask in the anime - yeah, not a fangirl, I'm afraid - and my opinion of him has not changed much in this manga volume.
The relationship between Usagi/Sailor Moon and Mamoru/Tuxedo Mask is predestined, however at least they start out not liking each other much in their civilian forms.
My interest in manga (and, by extension, western comics) really started watching Sailor Moon early on weekday mornings, getting ready to go to high school.
And yes, Sailor Moon really does hold up to my memories of a fun, romantic, and beautifully drawn manga.
Maybe it's because she can get herself together to get done what she needs to, or because people don't make excuses for her all the time, or because she is so loving at heart.I love these new editions.
Yes, I did compare the first chapter in the new edition to the first chapter in the original Tokyopop translation.
DNF at p.119I really wanted to like this, but this was awful.
I'm sure a lot of people really like this sort of thing, but it's not for me.
FMA was so much better than this.Usagi drove me nuts.
WE KNOW WHO YOU ARE.At the the point where I would have given it 3/5 stars, I was considering reading the second one to see if there's an improvement, but now?After a certain point, I didn't have a clue what was going on.
I swear, the only reason I'm so close to my reading goal for this year is because I'm DNFing books left and right...
Rating: 5+/5 ||  Recenzia pe Secretele Cărților  "...Ah...The feeling.It feels a bit nostalgic...Like I've felt it...somewhere before...So soft...and warm...I've felt it...many times before...those sweet lips..." (p.160-161) Încă de când eram mică am fost o fană a anime-urilor, dar pe vremea aceea nu cunoșteam acest termen atribuit desenelor japoneze. Țin minte când se difuza Sailor Moon la televizor, și urmăream toate episoadele cu mare drag, ca mai apoi să discut cu gașca de joacă despre gardi
Protagonista acestei povești este Tsukino Usagi, o tânără de 14 ani care este extreeeem de goofy și amețită.Grijile cele mai mari ale lui Usagi sunt notele mici de la școală, dar nu îndeajuns de mari ca să întreacă poftele ei pentru mâncare sau dorința de a se juca jocuri video (precum este cel cu Sailor V.) și de a dormi.Mi-a plăcut că la începutul benzii desenate am avut parte de câteva pagini lucioase și colorate, deschizându-mi și mai mult apetitul pentru lectură.
Oh my goodness, how did I survive 25 years of my life with never ever reading this manga?? Never even watched the anime too.Sailor Moon always fascinated me, the idea of a group of warrior girls and of strong female friendship always sounded super good to me, I'm glad I finally started it!
Among the more notable offenses, the American dub handwaved away all the deaths in the series, turned one gay male character into a straight woman, turned a lesbian couple into cousins, and added in facile "and knowing is half the battle" tags to the end of the show.
Going into the manga, I was a little worried about how those series would affect my enjoyment of Sailor Moon -- would I be able to look at Luna and the Sailor Crystals without thinking of Kyubey and Grief Seeds?
I've loved Sailor Moon for years, honestly since before I can even recall.
I knew there were mangas out but I never got around to buying or borrowing them.
But I'm glad that I finally did.For some reason I think I always manage to block out the fact that Usagi is such a cry baby but reading through the manga and seeing some of those scenes, it all came back to me.
I missed her and all these characters!
I'm so excited to go through these and read them all now!
My library has them all, so it'll happen here soon.
This was fine and fun and all but. So... does it get better or
What a re-read ! And that end tho. ♡!
Me gustó mucho (más que el Anime, al que nunca me enganché, seguro jaja).¡Espero que los siguientes sean aún mejores!♥ (sobre todo cuando terminen de presentar a todas las Sailors)
4.5 starsThis was SO much fun! Loved the artwork, the cast of characters were hilarious and ridiculously cute, and Luna was just everything. Really glad to have started this manga - I have the rest of the series on my shelf too :) Full RTC
Favorite moment in the volume one manga:  I really enjoyed re-reading volume one of Pretty Guardian Sailor Moon and I was able to appreciate it even more as it has been almost six years since I've last read the content in the manga. Sailor Moon Vol. 1 tells the beginning of Usagi's journey as she is told be a cat named Luna that she is destined to protect the Moon Princess and the Earth from the Dark Kingdom. She is joined on this journey by Sailor Mercury, Mars and Jupiter, who are all discover
I really enjoyed re-reading volume one of Pretty Guardian Sailor Moon and I was able to appreciate it even more as it has been almost six years since I've last read the content in the manga.
Sailor Moon Vol. 1 tells the beginning of Usagi's journey as she is told be a cat named Luna that she is destined to protect the Moon Princess and the Earth from the Dark Kingdom.
We also get the character of Tuxedo Mask who serves as love interest to Sailor Moon.
In comparison to the anime I enjoy the way the story flows in the manga more for the most part.
The art work is nice, though there are a few drawings that look a bit odd due to awkward proportions on characters.
We're introduced to 5 of the main characters just in this volume.
It would be nice if it was a bit slower paced, with Usagi being given time to settle into her new powers rather than being action-paced.
It's still enjoyable, though, and there's lots of volumes so hopefully we get to know the characters better in the future.One thing that's fun for me is drawing parallels between the TV show and manga - it's interesting to compare the two and see how they differ, in events and timeline and such.
Ich denke, Sailor Moon ist fast jedem ein Begriff - die junge Usagi trifft eines Tages auf die sprechende Katze Luna, die ihr offenbart, dass sie eine Kriegerin des Mondes ist.
Und so nimmt ihr Schicksal ihren Lauf.Mir hat es riesigen Spass gemacht, wieder in die Geschichte von Usagi und ihren Gefährtinnen einzutauchen und die Zeichnungen sind einfach toll.
Kindheitserinnerungen sind auf jeden Fall wieder hochgekommen und ich freue mich auch schon auf die nächsten Bände.Ich kann diese Reihe jedem empfehlen, der wieder in die Welt von Sailor Moon eintauchen will.
Fünf Sterne von mir.
Oix! Que sensación el leer el anime de mi infancia. No es un manga sensacional, pero me trae buenos recuerdos.
Sailor Moon *__*Einfach toll, mal wieder in die Welt einzutauchen. Ich habe die Serie als Kind geliebt und hatte alles mögliche von den Zeitschriften zu Hörkassetten bis hin zum Kostüm mit Mondstab :DFreue mich schon jetzt auf die nächsten Bände :-)
Sailor Moon é sem duvida dos meus animes prediletos, por isso já à muito que queria pegar no manga e foi simplesmente sensacional, muito fiel ao anime crystal!!!!Adorei
