but there's a difference between ending the book with a bit of a cliff hanger...versus literally stopping in the middle of a story.
This is a case of the latter.Deeeeep Breaths.In this novel, we find Darren competing in the Vampire Trials.
While the other vampires do make some concessions, for the most part, Darren is thrown to the wolves.
Unlike most middle-school books, no one waved their wand to cure him.
He deals with pain and suffering head-on which is something unique compared to many other sugar-coated middle school novels I've read.
Another frustrating TO BE CONTINUED... Someone needs to explain to me why I paid $8 for a book that didn't have an ending to it. Honestly, it didn't have a beginning either because that was in book 4 Vampire Mountain. It's just the next installment in one long book you have to read one part at a time. I bitched about this when I reviewed Vampire Mountain. Maybe it's just me but when I pay for a novel I think it should be a full NOVEL with a beginning, middle and an end. Isn't that what I paid f
Honestly, it didn't have a beginning either because that was in book 4 Vampire Mountain.
I bitched about this when I reviewed Vampire Mountain.
Darren has to perform five trials to clear his master's reputation for making him an half-vampire so young.
First, I'm not quite sure how that's Darren's problem but then I'm not a vampire.
(view spoiler)[Finally, I'd pretty much figured out in Vampire Mountain that Kurda Smadlt was a traitor (pretty sure he's the Vampaneze Lord everyone is freaking out about).
So am I going to read Book 6 The Vampire Prince?
Book Four: Vampire Mountain 
Book Six: The Vampire Prince 
WHAT...........THE.........HELL?!!?!!?AREYOUFUCKINGKIDDINGMEHOW THE HELL CAN A BOOK END WITH SUCH A HUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUGE CLIFFHANGER OH MY GOD JESUS LORD HAVE MERCY ON MY SOUL AND EVERYTHING NO NO NO NOI AM A MESS RIGHT NOW!
This was an improvement over the previous book but not by much. The plot is still going nowhere up until the last few pages, but at least Trials of Death was action packed. I feel like the series has lost some of it's appeal with the lack of the Cirque background. Not that the vampire society is not interesting, but it alone is not enough to maintain interest. Maybe the next one will be better.
This was always one of my favorites of the series. 💕 ***Ignore the fact that it took me over a month to finish rereading it 🙈
Yes, it was a weird experience.‘Trials of Death’ wasn’t filler-ish, better than the fourth because the pacing and almost non-stop action made it hard to put down.
Some disturbing stuff happened during the trails, especially the weird flame stuff.
Characters are more fleshed out, seeming livelier and not imitations of their former selves (the fourth suffered from that a little, especially for Crepsley.) Arra is still irritating, as are a lot of the princes and other vampires following their rigid systems without the bend of common-sense exceptions.
There is something that soured it for me – I still think Darren shouldn’t do the trails because of his age and half-vampire status.
Re-read 14.7.17: Vrátila jsem se k re-readu, protože se mi o sérii zdálo... Od pětky dál je to pěkně depresivní. Věděla jsem, proč čekám. Zkoušky mě ale baví z mnoha důvodů - ať už to samotné zkoušení, opilecká fiesta nebo ten konec... Oh, you break my heart every time I read this, Darren.Nakonec se mi to líbilo ještě více než předchozí díly. Hezky to uteklo a zkoušky byly fakt vymakaný nápad. Bohužel ten konec... Ach! To mi Shan neměl dělat...4/5*
Just LOVE this Series!
آنها گفتند: اگر بتوانم از آزمون های سختی که برایم درنظر گرفته میشد، موفق بیرون بیایم، مرا خواهند پذیرفت، چیزی که به من نگفتند این بود که اگر در آزمونی موفق نمیشدم کشته میشدم. ا. شربیانی
Páni... tak tohle byl zatím nejlepší díl ze všech. Doufám, že to takhle bude i dál a s každým dílem to bude lepší a lepší
About the Book:When we last left Darren, he was told that he would have to complete five deadly trials to prove himself a worthy vampire.
It always makes it seem more real, and I didn't feel like I was bogged down with these kind of details either.My favourite part was definitely the climax of this book, and I found myself unable to put it down and wondering how Darren would put a stop to it.
All in all though, I really enjoyed this book and started the next one right away (the cliff hanger is a suspense like no other).
Pretty harrowing and brutal, this macabre fifth book in the running Cirque du Freak series continues in the vein of all those that came before it with a lot of action, a lot of blood, and a lot of fun. I liked this one better than the last, as I felt it got a little more involved. But, being a fan of the entire series, I have yet to be disappointed, at all. Shan delivered darkness with Trials by Death, and I would have expected nothing less.Five Stars!
One things for sure, if Darren passes the Trials he might have wished he didn’t in the end.PlotThe plot in Trials of Death is all about Darren going through five Trials of Initiation to prove himself to be a good standing vampire.
If you’re used to reading books that have slow, gradual development then Trials of Death may have been a little fast-paced.
I feel like Darren should have been in the company of these other characters more so that certain character’s death is more meaningful.Things I Didn't LikeUnfortunately one of the biggest negatives in books made into my Things I Didn’t Like section: plotholes.
Yay loved re-reading this one :D It's my favourite of the series. Loved the reappearance of (view spoiler)[the wolves (hide spoiler)], and the betrayal by (view spoiler)[Kurda (hide spoiler)] was rather intense! I didn't remember that one. But the descriptions of the (view spoiler)[trials (hide spoiler)] would have freaked me out! My paranoia and my imagination would have made me crazy. Darren's so brave.
Every book in this series is so different from the rest but I think this was my favorite so far, because it surprised me the most.I was kind of bored during the first half of the book.
I have read several books with trials a lot like these, so I thought that this was going to be one of the more predictable books in the series (Darren almost dies a few times but in the end he will probably succeeds in the trials, then i can move on to the next book).
Something else i like about these books is the world building.

This was a big step up from he last book, Darren has to complete 5 trials which will be randomly drawn. I will admit to having tears in my eyes after the 3rd trial. Failure to complete a trail ends in a very painful death and if you loose a trail you are dead anyway. How can the vampires expect Darren to survive I know he is good but this is taking it a bit far he is just a kid after all.
This was definitely the best book of the series yet! Lots of action and a huge plot twist in the end I'm starting the next one immediately
Waduh endingnya bikin pengen langsung baca lanjutannya... tp baru nyewa sampai nomor ini doang...
THAT ENDING KILLED ME. MY BABY IS DEAD
Tremendo giro de acontecimientos :Oa seguir con la sexta parte !
The readers know that Kurda is not a good person because he kills someone that everyone in the book likes.
Readers feel worried about Darren because we learn that a lot of his friends died, we get to hear his thoughts and what he thinks about his friends dying.I would recommend this book to people who enjoy paranormal stories, specifically stories with vampires and werewolves.
because it’s a really good book and I think they should read it because in the book it makes you attached to the characters.
Soo much better than the previous book.
If I pass I'll be accepted into the clan.Failure isn't an option...Hell!  YES! That was awesome; Trials of Death, is awesome! As I progress, each new entry pushes its predecessor out of the way to become my favourite. Spine-tingling action balanced with a fantastic plot and a cast of characters who are unique and utterly encapsulating. Trials of Death does a helluva lot: a stellar story which pushes forward an overarching plot; cast development that deepens the depth of already nicely fleshed ch
Trials of Death does a helluva lot: a stellar story which pushes forward an overarching plot; cast development that deepens the depth of already nicely fleshed characters; and an ending that has you blinking with emotional whiplash.
Knowing Shan's other works, they'll be inventive, heart-pounding and great vehicles to drive forward character development.And they don't fail the reader.
Probably because I was just so much in love with the little guy, but what he had to say in Vampire Mountain teases a huge plot; a huge plot that's expanded upon in Trials of Death: The Vampaneze Lord will rise and decimate the vampires, so they're obviously uneasy.
I have to admit I was disgusted and annoyed that Darren decided to escape rather than face the punishment of death I thought his character had become better than the coward he began as.
As he does each trial he finds his stronger side, his courage I started to admire him until he decided to run rather than face death doing that he showed his coward side.
The next challenge he faces is the hall of fire, the description of that scene is so detailed it feels as if your there living it with him, when he comes out of there he is delirious and severely burnt.
Trials of Death by Darren Shan is an outstanding book!
In trying to get the approval of the vampire higher-ups Darren has to face several trials...
Failure to complete these trials in immediate death to the vampire in the trial along with whatever number of mentors he has at that time.
Ultimately on his last trial, Darren is on the floor of the arena almost to be killed by a boar when harkat, his friend who sint a vampire, saves him from dying and then returns to their room at vampire mountain.

Darren Shan tries to survive and become a vampire.
You would have to read this great book in order to find out.
Darren Shan is creative like every other book.
In order for him to live, he must past several trails.
Darren Shan just continues to be descriptive and detailed.
All the trails that Darren takes, you would be able to see them happening in your head.
Darren has done great with his description and has been so creative in Trails of Death.
But the real question is does Darren become a vampire and live, or does he fail and face death?
In this 5th book of the Cirque de Freak series, Darren is still at Vampire Mountain.
Darren must compete the trials to prove he has what it takes to be a vampire.
The trials get their name from the fact that if you can't compete them, you are sentenced to death.
This book was more interesting than the last one, and the ones before that.However, having said that, I must point out that the author, Darren Shan, has a habit of repeating the word "snapped." This word is used over and over to indicate that one vampire is upset with another when speaking.
I thought the book Cirque Du freak book 5 the trials of death was a very interesting book because th
In this book, Darren must face five horrific trials by order of the Vampire Council to see if he is worthy enough to join them.
The descriptions in this still haunt me, of the horrific trials Darren has to face, and I still remember how vivid they are, the pictures my imagine created still seered into my mind from years ago.
Honestly, I recommend the whole Darren Shan series to anyone, and definitely to read up to this one, at least.
This is the one that made everything so much more intense for myself, and was the one that made me sell my soul to Darren Shan as an author.
