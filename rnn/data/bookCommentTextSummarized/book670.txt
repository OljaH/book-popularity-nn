Short (63p) Estonian children's book of 1920.This is the tale of a brother and sister who get lost in the forest while out picking berries.
But as Tom becomes increasingly homesick and plots his escape, he finds sister Jenny is more reluctant to leave - she's become very fond of the hag's baby ("Bumpy" on account of his little horns) which she has to care for.There are various themes from Russian fairytales: the animals which help the children after being kindly treated; the threat of being eaten by the witch's family.
Then the tiny hairy hand gives the bottle back to Jenny over the side of the cradle.
Kui Nukitsamehe film t채iesti k천rvale heita, on esialgne muinasjutt 체llatavalt hea, arvestades eriti, mis aastal see kirjutatud on. Film ja raamat on siiski erinevad ja 천nneks on raamat parem :)
