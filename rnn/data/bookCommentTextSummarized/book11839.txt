آخرین یادداشت های روزانه از آخرین ماه ها و روزهای زندگی ارنستو چه گوارا.
با خواندن این کتاب در یک سال آخر زندگی چه گوارا کنار او خواهیم بود.
شیوه نگارش اگرچه هیچکدام از مولفه های ظاهری داستان و رمان را ندارد و نویسنده هم تلاشی به پر و بال دادن به نوشته ها نمیکند اما دست به قلم بودن مدام و دقت در نوشتن مهمترین وقایع روزانه در کوتاه ترین جملات ممکن، کتاب را خواندنی تر از هزاران رمان جنگی در خانه نوشته شده میکند.
انبوهی از داده های غیر قابل استفاده دارد؛ به این معنا که اسامی زیاد است و حفظ کردن اینکه هر کسی کجا بود و باید چه می کرد و چه شد و ...
اما جدای از همه ی اینها آنچه بسیار در این اثر جالب است وصف نفس تجربه ی مبارزه ی چریکی و مشکلات و دشواری های آن است.
اما با این حال حال و هوای آن مبارزات را منتقل می کند...نکته ی دیگر پیوند چه گوارا با روشنفکران اروپایی است مثلا در جایی از قصد خود برای نوشتن نامه ای به راسل و سارتر صحبت می کند تا از آنها بخواهد برای جمع آوری پول جهت مبارزات آمریکای جنوبی کاری بکنند.
يحكي الكتاب عن يوميات حرب العصابات في بوليفيا وكيف نقل جيفارا الثورة بعد انتصارها في كوبا الى بوليفيا ، ينقل لنا جيفارا الصعاب التي واجهته أمام الجيش البوليفي النظامي ودور الامبريالية الامريكية في تحطيم المساعي لنجاح الثورة ، حيث ان جيفارا نقل الثورة بحذافيرها الى بوليفيا وأغفال عامل الخصوصية البوليفية حيث توقع انظمام الفلاحين الذين اصبحوا وشاة للنظام وتخلي الحزب الشيوعي البوليفي عن الثورة مثل بقية الاحزاب الشيوعية التنظرية التي ما أن تقوم الثورة حتى تختبئ في جحورها .
Che Guevara waas more than just an icon on a T-shirt, in his time he was a real revolutionary who played a key part in the Cuban revolution and was aiming to overthrow South American dictatorships to free the people.This book is a translation of the diary that he wrote when he was in Bolivia with a small team of revolutionaries.
It is written with daily notes and reports on their progress as they move through the jungle, avoiding the army that is looking for them and talking to the peasants to get them onside.
Takes a while to get going, and in the end isn't too bad as a read.
Otherwise it is a reasonable read
An introduction from Fidel Castro and the final diary of a figure like Guevara? It would qualify as worth a read on the back of that alone.The accompanying notes are very helpful as a Who's Who as you read through - I found myself referring to it frequently to keep on top of this. If you're looking to learn about the Guevara's history, there will be better books to start on. If, however, you want to get into the man's head, then what better place than his diary. It strikes me as honest and it's certainly interesting.
This diary is full of interest - Che wrote a daily journal from his arrival in Bolivia to start a new revolution, one planned to eventually include the whole of South America.
Che shows his humanity is noting birthdays of his family, his single mindedness in the revolution, his ability to maintain the spirits of his troops, his anger when people failed in their duties and his fairness to Army soldiers he captured.The small band of rebels at times suffered hunger, thirst, illness and petty jealousies as they trekked around the jungles of Bolivia setting up ambushes.
Though Che has a large ego, his intentions were sincere, and Nelson Mandela once called him "a hero for anyone who truly values freedom."It was interesting to note that Che was the leader from the start, though hailing from Argentina, having success in Cuba, and assembling a guerilla army made up of men AND women from Bolivia, Cuba and Peru.
were beginning to step in and suck the natural resources out of the country, and these companies could not operate under the threat of someone trying to help liberate the country (and later all of South America), while maximizing profit at the same time!Of the 4 men who made it out of Bolivia via Chile after Che was executed, all were Cuban, and 3 are still alive today.
The speech that Che Guevara gave to the United Nations in 1964 is included in it's entirety, and it is facinating to listen to this man of letters argue that the US is in the wrong for attacking Cuba, blockading supplies and medicine, and for sending troops and money to different factions around the World to protect corporate interests, which by definition makes the United States Not a Protector of Freedom, but an imperialist war monger out to make a profit.
Do not read the intro by Fidel Castro unless you want to get killed by war-cries against antirevolutionaries and pure propaganda.
I did read it.
It's hard to say what do I think about this book.
It's not really a book.
At first you get bored of accounts '3 kilometres this day.' the next day - '5 kilometres next day', but after a few pages you get past the boredom and just get into the experience - the jungle, the constant fear, the long kilometres and you find yourself supporting Che.He didn't write why he was fighting for.
یه بار تو استخر یکی رو دیدم که عکس چه رو، روی کمرش خالکوبی کرده بود، پوستر چه رو تو خیلی عکسا میبینم که تو اتاقاشون گذاشتند ...آدم فکر میکنه چندتای اینا کتاب های اون رو خوندن و نظراتشو میدونن؟

I only know that for me, those consultations with the peasants of the Sierra Maestra converted my spontaneous and somewhat lyrical resolve into a different, more severe force."Our mission is to develop what is good and noble in each person, to convert every person into a revolutionary, from the Davids who did not understand very well, to the Banderases, who died without seeing the dawn.
And they fully and clearly understand that the difference between human beings does not lie in the color of their skin, but in the forms of ownership of the means of production, in the relations of production."
Just seen Che Parts 1&2 so it made sense to re-read the Bolivian Diary.
Part 2 of the film documents Che's Bolivian campaign which ended in his death.
The film very much sticks to Che's account and that of some of his Cuban comrades who managed to escape during those fateful last days.
The failure to get the Bolivian communist party to support the campaign and then the failure to adequately gain the support and trust of the mostly indigenous people (campensinos)both contributed to the fateful ending.
Around the World = BoliviaThe Bolivian Diary of Ernesto "Che" Guevara details the 11 months of the guerilla campaign for the liberation of Bolivia, until the day before his death.
Found amongst Che's posessions following his capture and execution by the Bolivian Army, and thus not rewritten for publication, it soberly describes campaign efforts.
Preparing trails and provisioning expeditions; recruiting fighters and supporters; skirmishes and ambushes against the army; ilnesses, infections and injuries; starvation and exhaustion; frustration that the spark of revolution sputters and smoulders rather than bursting to life.Che was a remarkable man, and is now all too often portrayed as the iconic figure on posters and flags.
An interesting read but in truth not the best of Che's books both the motorcycle diaries and reminse
It's really fantastic to see Che's ultimately futile attempt to start a Cuban-style revolution in Bolivia recounted in his own words.
Especially interesting for me is his ceaseless optimism in the face of circumstances which we, in hindsight, know to be hopeless.
To really get a complete understanding of the "man behind the myth" (cliche, I know), it is vital to read this final diary: recommended.his very own words from the guerrilla front.As a sidebar, the glossary in the back which defines the (many) nicknames Che gives his companeros, while also giving their biographies, is indispensable to understand this volume more fully.
Ernesto "Che" Guevara de la Serna's Bolivian diary. It describes the frustration and military difficulties Guevara encountered in Bolivia that led to his capture and execution. I read both Spanish and English versions. Read the Spanish version if you can as somethings are lost in the translation.
Fascinating book of Guevara's travels to Bolivia to start a revolution. Insights into the difficulties he had there with the climate and lack of support from the populace. Great insight into his thinking and beliefs.
دیوانه کننده است قدرت روحی این مرد. مبارزه بکند، پیروز شود، رییس بانک مرکزی کوبا بشود، ول کند و برود کشوری غیر از کشور خودش را آزاد کند.در کوبا وقتی تازه جنازه اش را آورده بودند بر سر قبرش رفتمدر تاریخ۱۴-۲-۸۲ ان را خوانده ام
Jako zanimljivo štivo. Čak i danas kada sam u potpunosti ostavio tu politiku iza sebe. Che je, bar po dojmu mog sjećanja, bio dobar pisac dnevnika. Ovome bi se trebao vratiti. Kako sam bio mlad kad sam se u ovo uživio. Eh ta mladost.
Where is he when we need him?
increible lo detallado que fue escrito todo por el Che. Esta edicion es muy completa y detallada con buenas imagenes.
Ne ho letto solo una selezione, ma molto significativo
The reality of how he thought was pretty scary, very interesting
من المؤلم جدا قراءة كلمات بحروف كتبها وهو يتعايش مع تلك الضروف والحياه صعبه كلما توغلت باسطر تشي غيفارا كلما خالني مظهره وهو متكئ على جذع شجره يسرد تلك الاحداث
Every time I read Guevara I dislike him a little more. Arrogant ass.
He was angered and saddened by the fact that parents were losing so many of their children to poverty that it at times seemed to him that these parents looked upon this as an “unimportant accident.” These experiences convinced Che that in order to help these people he needed to leave the realm of medicine and consider the political arena of armed struggle.
Ed era solito farlo fin dalla giovent�: esempio � "Latinoamericana" (Notas de viaje), da cui � stato tratto il film "I diari della motocicletta" del 2004, in cui racconta il suo viaggio in motocicletta, in compagnia con un amico, nell'America del Sud. E proprio questa sua abitudine di mettere per iscritto gli avvenimenti salienti delle sue giornate ha fatto s� che giungessero a noi dei documenti importantissimi non solo dal punto di vista storiografico, ma anche che da quello umano e politico.
Tough I did enjoy to read this book because of the historical importance of the final guerria movement of Che, it is a diary with short notes and a lot of days without anything exiting happening. There are definitely more exiting books around by Che and about Che and guerria warfare. Fun bonus is the introduction written by Fidel Castro.
Its revolutionary to read Che's diary.
Almost all the days in Bolivia are spent trekking and hiking kilometres, eating all kinds of meat and vegetations, drinking brackish water (at times, his own!), setting up ambushes with his less than 50 compañeros, facing both victories and losses in the process of this long revolutionary odyssey.
The main reasons for his defeat were, lack of guerrillas in his army, betrayal of the peasants of Bolivia who served as informers, and the constant loss of contact between his army sections.
I finished reading Ernesto Che Guevara’s Bolivian Diary.
Che and his guerilla cadres eat horsemeat by killing the very horses that helped them to take their stuff, kill birds, fish, cows, and what not!
Though Che wants to maintain discipline in the team, there are instances of some cadres going against the rule and eat beyond the approved quota in secret.
But I feel that fighting a conventional government army with around 100 guerillas is a losing battle from the inception.
I wrote this just by reading the Bolivian Diary and I have not read in detail about Che or Cuban revolution.
