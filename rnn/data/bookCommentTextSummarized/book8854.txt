Carella doesn’t return until the very end, just in time to listen to the story about the cats.A violent mugger calling himself Clifford is running loose in the 87th Precinct.
Kling, a name readers of the 87th Precinct novels know well, is still a beat cop here.
Bert Kling dates Claire Townsend in this one, but I can’t say more in case you’ve not read any further than The Mugger.
Written after Cop Hater, this fills in some of the backstory of characters, as well as being a fine - if early - 87th Precinct novel.
Cop Hater had used a classic smoke-screen plot as an introduction to the series, with cops the victims of a killer who seemed out to get cops - a way of bringing my full (at the time) complement of cops onstage as both investigators and potential victims. Having set up the characters who would be around, more or less, in every book, I now wanted to experiment with my theory that the squadroom itself could function as a "hero", with different cops taking the spotlight in each book. --Ed McBain,
Detective Steve Carella is away on his honeymoon, so McBain takes the opportunity to give us some quality time with some of the precinct’s other employees, notably rookie cop Bert Kling, who gets talked into an unauthorized murder investigation, and detectives Hal Willis and Roger Havilland, who are on the trail of the title villain, sometimes with Detective Eileen Burke (making her series debut).A mugger is brutalizing the women of the 87th Precinct, stealing their purse, punching them up, and taking his leave with a dandyesque bow and the immortal words: Clifford thanks you, madam!
The central character in the first of the novels, Cop Hater, was a detective named Steve Carella, and in this book, McBain sends Carella off on his honeymoon and turns the focus to other members of the precinct.
McBain would later change his mind about the whole ensemble cast business, at least to some extent, and Carella would ultimately become the principal character in the series with other characters rotating in and out around him.The Mugger, though a good read is one of the less successful books in the series, in part because of Carella's absence.
This is the second installment in the 87th Street Precinct series.
As I explained in my review of the first book in this series, it is of utmost importance, if you have never read these novels, to keep in mind the era of time in which they were written.
I think that is part of what makes these older books interesting.
Although, the story has some problems, I still think these books are worth reading.
Not great, not terrible- 3 starsNote: For those who are enrolled in the Kindle Unlimited program many of the 87th Precinct books are available along with the audio.
When Patrolman Kling, still recovering from the gunshot wound he received in the last book, is asked by an old pal to sniff out what's up with the buddy's teenage sister-in-law, he suspects something's wrong, but can't put his finger on the problem.
One of these storylines was W-A-Y too predictable for me - (view spoiler)[Yeah...it was the old "he-knocked-her-up-then-knocked-her-off" trick...
(hide spoiler)] - BUT, the writing makes this book worth the read.
McBain, once again, details all the legwork and hours spent pouring over documents required to catch a criminal, without making it sound like the most boring job on earth.In Cop Hater, the first book in this series, detectives from the 87 were being picked off by a sniper.
This second book in Ed McBain's police procedural series shines more light on some of the other cops of the 87th Precinct while Steve Carella enjoys his Honeymoon with Teddy.
Although Hal Willis is running the case, with help from Roger Havilland and Eileen Burke, the story tends to focus more on Bert Kling, a beat cop recovering from getting shot in the first book.
An old friend asks him to talk some sense into a young girl who is acting strangely.This one isn't quite as hooked on detailing the minutia of policing methods as in some of the other books but rather works on characterisation.
Ed McBain's 87th precinct novels are enjoyable, so far, but in a weird and predictable way. Over the first two books, the formula is lean and mean: narrating the lives of police officers while they're investigating a crime. It work well enough, but these are glorified, borderline padded social dramas and not really mysteries. Loved the case of the mugger because it was complex and genuinely frightening, but it was solved in less than twenty pages like Cop Hater. The jury's still out on whether these are as great as advertised.
The Mugger is the 2nd book in the 87th Precinct series by American writer, Ed McBain.
The premise is simple; the cops of the 87th Precinct try to solve cases in their area.
The scenario for the 2nd book is a series of muggings in the precinct, with the latest involving the death of the female victim.
She is the latest victim of the mugger.The book is a police procedural in its truest form.
So far, different cops have been involved in working the case.
You have Kling trying to solve the murder, working mostly during his off-time, and also trying to develop a relationship with a witness he has questioned.
The second book in the 87th Precinct sequence had a tough act to follow but McBain did the wise thing and gave his world depth rather than sending the exact same character on another vendetta.
This time it was even more of an ensemble effort which gave me great hope for the rest of the series.As with the last book the ending was obvious from the beginning but the journey was the enjoyable part.
I found "The Mugger" by Ed McBain on a 99 cent sale on kindle and it sure was a great find! I figured out whodunit early in the book, but it was still a fast and fun ride which is why I gave it 5 stars!It is about a teenager found dead and mysterious mugger "clifford" is suspected. This is a quick read of a police mystery read and is mucho reccomended!!
The 87th precinct is filled with wacky detectives -- and they're brave too. The female detective was mighty, but her part was handled with some 50s male stereotypes. The other views of the 50s rang true and are interesting -- especially salaries and prices. A good series.
Book #2 in the 87th Precinct series, The Mugger, begins to fulfill McBain’s premise of creating an ensemble cast of detectives rather than focusing on a single character.
For fans of the series, it’s here that young patrolman Bert Kling becomes a regular part of the squad, earning his detective badge for solving a murder that occupies a good portion of the book.
The principal detectives in this entry, Willis and Havilland, are perhaps less charismatic, but we also meet Det. Meyer Meyer, a regular of the cast from here on out, who is a fun and interesting character.
9/10"Ποιός σκότωσε την Τζίνι Πέιτζ" είναι ο Ελληνικός τίτλος και είχε κυκλοφορήσει από εκδόσεις Bell.Δεύτερο βιβλίο του 87ου τμήματος που διαβάζω και ήταν κι αυτό άκρως ψυχαγωγικό. Μου αρέσει πολύ η γραφή του McBain και θα διαβάσω σίγουρα κι άλλα που έχω στην βιβλιοθήκη μου.

When King says that McBain "taught a whole generation of baby boomers how to write stories that were not only entertaining, but that truthfully reflected the times and the culture" you should take notice.There are many who say that, with the 87th Precinct Series, McBain brought the police procedure story into it's full potential.
Of course the police methods used in the early sixties would be rather frowned upon today, they do reflect the times in which the book was written This is my first McBain novel, so I am not sure how the entire series unfolds.
McBain found an interesting way to take the focus away from Steve Carrella who starred in the first entry in this series: he sent him on his honeymoon.
I'm thoroughly enjoying reading these books.
I've read some of them before, but so long ago that I don't recall anything about the plots.
The writing is fun, the characters are interesting and it's I love to watch the way they develop over time, giving the reader the feeling that these are old friends.
I must admit that it's also nice to read something which proves that cops can be portrayed without the need for four letter words in every sentence.
For the second book of the 87th Precinct series you get a case...wait for it, of a serial mugger. This book makes up for the issue I had with the last book, the crime and criminal make sense, not a huge Dwight Gooden curveball, an off speed pitch nonetheless. Great insight into what's going on in the lives of the cops behind the badge.
Easy enough to close the book, but McBain's 87th Precinct novels go down easy, like a glass of cold water on a hot day.PACE=2: Surprising slow-going compared to the 1st book in this series and this is a very short book.PLOT=1: The search for a mugger begins.
There is a saying that goes something like, "If you think a passage/joke/paragraph, etc., is particularly fine, strike it out." Both McBain and any editor should have known better to use this bad joke.CHARACTERS=2: After closing the book, I couldn't think of a single character's name nor of any action they took that had been memorable.PLACE/ATMOSPHERE=2: This story could take place in any large city.
Not that such attitudes aren't still apparent among certain writers today, but, on the whole, they do a better job of disguising it.The story here is as the title says, The Mugger.
Before the young woman was murdered, a young police patrolman named Bert Kling was asked by a friend to talk to his sister-in-law.
In fact, the solution seemed pretty clear to me fairly early in the book.With this series, Ed McBain set the pattern for many police procedurals to come and he's still inspiring writers of the genre today.
The second in the 87th Precinct series still carries a punch.
Good cop, bad cop seems to exist with everyone else or Roger Havilland.But we shouldn't get ahead of ourselves, let the author tell his story in such magestic prose and focused one-liners.But is the insights given into a crime scene, the different jobs piecing together any clues and the time walking the beat that makes this such an engaging series.
This is the second book in the 87th Precinct series.
A very fast read once I got started - I look forward to reading more of this series!McBain was the first mystery/crime writer to feature an entire precinct instead of one or two detectives and he also created a fictional yet realistic city to set the series in (he claimed that this was so he wouldn't have to worry about being accurate!).
One feature in the first book which I am happy to see again is the inclusion of things like fingerprint cards or photostats of typewritten police reports -- it helps make me feel like a part of this 1950s police force!

A short book, more of a novella in my view.
The detectives of the 87th are on the tail of a mugger that is targeting ladies handbags.
The attacks are becoming increasingly violent and when a young girl is murdered and thrown down a cliff the mugger is suspected.
Detectives Havilland and Willis are on the case with unexpected assistance by patrolman Kling who is recovering from the shoulder injury sustained in the first book, "Cop Hater".The writing is straightforward although with some jargon, which I had to look up, but good pace and an interesting police procedural story line.
This is the second book in the 87th Precinct series of police procedurals.
The idea of the series is that all the personnel of the precinct are the main characters of every book, so the focus shifts from person to spurn depending on the story.This particular story involves a serial mugger and a murder.
It sure looks like it.
But he's a slippery character and it will take some good detective work (and a bit of forensics) to find this guy.
Like the first book (Cop Hater), this book is OK (maybe a bit better than the first one).
Solid "police procedural", but nothing remarkable. Having said that, McBain's characterizations are condensed and pointed, he uses exposition to great storytelling effect and keeps the tale moving at a brisk pace.
Written in 1957, this police procedural holds up well. It's a fun, fast read and there are about 49 others in the series. Great hammock/beach reading fodder.

Hate, hate, hate.Two: a guy tells the withdrawn girl he’s interested in that he doesn’t mind if she’s carrying a torch for some other guy.
She tells him that she’s still grieving for her boyfriend who died in Korea.
No. He gets mad, yells at her, tells her that people die all the time and she has to get over it already.
He doesn’t apologize.
All previous loves have to be completely forgotten.
If you love somebody, I think the person who loves you should also love that person, no matter who.Love shouldn’t be forgotten.
And people who are grieving shouldn’t be yelled at.
The second novel of the 87th Precinct series is very enjoyable. Good introduction to more of the Precinct team. I really enjoyed the book. It's a bit predictable but only because I'm looking back from decades of reading copycats. I'm sure the twist was amazing at time.The characters are so real. McBain is very talented in writing people that jump off the page. Even though there are some aspects of the novel are dated. The majority of the novel doesn't read dated.Well worth the read for any fan of McBain's 87th Precinct series.
Well that didn’t take long to read.I read this and others in the series years ago. My old brain remembers snippets, but not enough to spoil the enjoyment of getting to know the cast of characters again. 👍🏻Three and a half stars for this one ..goodreads really should allow half points 😁
