Although I've heard of Zane Grey all my life (five-plus decades), I'd never read him -- a bit surprising, given my love of horses, western- and wilderness-based stories, and clean adventure and romance.
That she ended up falling in love with one arose logically from this experience.Yes, there were horses and some gun slinging, but these too were a natural part of the story and its characters.
He lovingly and realistically describes it without bogging down the story, and it influences the character and fate of everyone who lives within it.Oddly, he never places it solidly on the map; and not once did the word "Tonto" cross the pages even though the rim itself was a dominant part of the setting.
Told from the POV of a young woman, the story is about a middle-class idealist who is sent to teach home and social skills to the backwoods families living in the mountains.
Lucy Watson had much more to learn about being a decent human than her target families needed to know about indoor plumbing and social etiquette.This is a really good, wholesome tale, and once I slowed my 21st-century brain down enough to appreciate the descriptive prose that is the earmark of a turn-of-the-20th-century novel, the main characters really captivated me.
Love the stories of that show how people might have lived at different times and places. This is a great book to do that.
'Zane Grey can hook you on page one and keep you there until the very end which you often do not want to happen.
This is one of my all-time favorite novels.
Finally a Zane Grey that I loved reading. Predictable? Yeah, but still really enjoyed it!

it was a decent read, with some truly fun and funny parts, but it was also a bit heavy on internal dialog and thoughts.
Zane Grey is known for his descriptions of western scenery; he also knows how people tick. A great story ... the last chapter is a "tear jerker" but all works out well.
