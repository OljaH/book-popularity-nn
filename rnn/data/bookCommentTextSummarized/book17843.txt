Could you be my girlfriend?Drew waits outside of a local bar called La Salle for Fable to get off work.
A few words are exchanged before he can ask what he really wants..“I want you to pretend to be my girlfriend for a week.” ~DrewFable cannot understand why Drew Callahan "the golden boy quarterback" needs her, when he can have any girl he wants.
And she is afraid of what may have Drew so on edge in his own home.My Thoughts -SPOILER FREE
If you love NA books then I consider this a MUST READ!
*****FOUR STARS*****He might be more trouble than he's worth but I don't think so. This man came into my life for some reason. Just as I came into his. Maybe we're supposed to help each other cope. Or give each other hope. Drew Callahan and Fable Maguire come from two different worlds and yet they seem to have so much in common.

Drew Callahan and Fable Maguire come from two different worlds and yet they seem to have so much in common.
Drew is the popular college football player and Fable is a waitress at the local bar in town that all the college kids hang out as.
Fable's home life is less than perfect.
At first things are awkward since they hardly know each other but as they spend time together, feelings are clearly starting to develop between them.I have to say this story was very predictable to me.
I knew right away what was haunting Drew and that huge reveal at the end??
4+ SWEET AS M-A-R-S-H-M-A-L-L-O-W STARS. "We'll settle back into our usual roles. where you hate me and I hate you. It'll be a lie. I might've hated you before all this, but now... I think I'm falling in love with you."  Drew --Fable --Drew Callahan is going home for Thanksgiving and he needs a fake girlfriend for a week to bring to his parents' house. That way, he can show them that he is in fact capable of keeping a girl for a longer amount of time, and he hopes this way his father and stepmot
So, when Drew Callahan, the university's golden boy and star quarterback offers her 3000 dollars to be his fake girlfriend for a week, Fable decides that even though it makes her feel cheap and used, that amount of much needed money, makes Drew's offer one she can't refuse."There is no room for romance in my life.
It helps me forget that no one really cares." ~ Fable.What neither of them expects though, is that although their relationship is based on "appearances", slowly but surely they begin to rely on each other more and more.
4.5 MARSHMALLOW (but not the soft and squishy marshmallows….no, these are the fucked-up marshmallows!!!) STARS!!!!! I did not expect to enjoy this book so much!

4.5 MARSHMALLOW (but not the soft and squishy marshmallows….no, these are the fucked-up marshmallows!!!) STARS!!!!!
The blurb sounded predictable and cliché (guy asks girl to be his pretend girlfriend…boring, right?...WRONG!).
My Drew:My Fable:Drew is a gorgeous all-star in college.
Drew convinces Fable to be his pretend girlfriend for a week over the holidays.
When they get to Drew’s parent’s house, Fable quickly realizes that his family is not so perfect.
Drew and Fable grow closer together through the shit storm that is Drew’s family.
The story is definitely not cliché.I love Drew.
I love Fable.
I did not expect to find such emotion and even some angst in this story but was pleasantly surprised when I did.
The reader is continually drawn into what the other character is thinking due to the deep and emotional story lines taking place.
Thats right there are real true deep back stories in this book, but I can't tell you what they are due to spoilers.
I love that she is the one that is strong over the big hunky jock that is Drew Callahan.
Omg!!! Loved this one!! On to the next...
A highly privileged childhood with his Father and Step-Mother but it seems money doesn’t buy happiness and right from the getgo Drew’s bone-deep sadness and extreme vulnerability were there in full force.
She works in a bar and also as a waitress and has a bit of a reputation amongst the college jocks for being easy and so Drew decides she’s the one for the job.He’s wealthy enough to offer her a sizeable sum of money to make a big difference to her and her brother’s lives – he must really need to convince his family he’s dating.
Drew is a quiet, hot, rich, college quarterback who offers townie/barmaid Fable, (yes, that’s her name love it right!) three thousand dollars to spend Thanksgiving week with him and his dysfunctional parents, posing as his girlfriend.
I would say that the majority of readers will be able to figure his secrets out but that’s not the allure of the story…Fable tries to save Drew from his demons and they fall in love through this charade.Fable is a terrific character!
I thought he was a fucked up mess.
I still think he’s a fucked up mess.
I know I can heal him.”
Drew doesnt do relationships, he needs some to help him with his lie...And he goes to find...
Drew tries to forget the past, secrets that eat him...
He never lets anyone in his life to get close to him.But Fable is different and Drew knows it.
He tries to not have those story feelings for her in fears he will run away.Fable wants drew to open up to her...
They falling for each other very fast.Drew opens up with Fable and let's her in...
He pushes Fable away...
He wants to push her away but also save him...I cannot wait for the next book!
Meine Rezension gibt es hier :) : https://youtu.be/s32QUnO4apM
This man came into my life for some reason. Just as I came into his. Maybe we’re supposed to help each other cope. Or give each other hope.Drew Callahan is a college football star. He appears to have the perfect life. He’s a good looking guy, a good student, a great football player. He seems to have it all together, but it is all a facade.   From the outside, my family looks perfect. Well, as perfect as a family can be with one dead mother, and one dead sister. A fucked up stepmother and a cold
Fable is a local in the college town Drew lives in.
Fable has a bit of a reputation from working at the local bar, and 'hooking up' with some of Drew's team mates.
Drew decides she would make the perfect candidate for his one-week, temporary girlfriend.
When Drew approaches Fable, she has no idea why he would need her help.
Drew should have no problem bringing home a real girlfriend.
She is tough and I love how she helped Drew with everything.
I still think he’s a fucked up mess.
I want to belong to you, Drew.
Así evito dejarme llevar por la marea y consigo una opinión objetiva.Con “Una semana contigo” tenia las expectativas muy altas debido a esa marea buenas opiniones que tuvo cuando se publicó, y aunque el libro me ha gustado pese a los numerosos tópicos que contiene, me ha faltado algo más.Fable Maguire nunca ha tenido una vida fácil.
Monica Murphy tiene una narración cuidada y directa, lo que permite que disfrutes el doble, pero no consigue mantener ese gran secreto hasta el final, ya que ofrece demasiadas pistas.Con los personajes logra romper los estereotipos americanos, porque aunque Drew sigue el tópico de chico guapo estrella del fútbol, tiene su parte oscura y diferente.
Meet Drew, football player, hottie, has money so what more could he want?
Well right now he needs....
A girlfriend for 1 week.
Get her $3K, play nice for a week and be done!
Fable didn't know and honestly All she cared about what getting the money.
The Last thing either one of them expected was to fall for each other.
Love or lust, it didn't matter because Once Fable knew the truth about his secrets, Drew knew he would lose her.
Drew could barely deal with the secret himself?
"I want to belong to you, Drew.
I need the sequel like yesterday!
Drew pays Fable to be his fake girlfriend for the week of Thanksgiving, a week he must spend at home.
He needs Fable for protection but as a reader you don’t know why.
She’s seen Drew at the bar before with his college mates and knows his type, entitled and used to getting what he wants, girls being no exception.
It’s one of those reads you don’t want to put down!
I’m writing this itching to click over to purchase and load Second Chance Boyfriend so I can get my Drew and Fable HEA!
“I want to belong to you, Drew.
Full of secrets and heartache this is so much more than just a story of love, more like a journey of two lost hearts.From the start I knew that I would love Fable the relationship with her younger brother and the life she finds herself in shows a strength and courage, she is so likeable and genuine everything in me wanted her to have her long awaited HEA.The author leads you right into the darkness that surrounds drew the main male lead in the story and instantly the story grabbed me waiting for the HEA from chapter one.
I'll do a full text review later, but for now you get my gif crazed self.My Drew:My Fable:[image error]PRONTO.
Eventually Fable gets to this point: But Drew's has too much pain from his past...And Fable understands...thinking he, like everyone else, doesn't want her.But it's not Fable.
It's the past.
The pain.
To save themselves from the past.And there are some fabulous intimate momentsAnd then it all goes to HELLLLLLLLLL.
I can make it to the sequel.Please, please, please.
I implore you to read this book!
Her words flow and I could not put this book down.
I am dying for the sequel.
PRONTO.
4,5Das maiores surpresas deste ano, não estava mesmo nada à espera de gostar tanto!Adorei completamente esta estória e admito que não estava nada à espera de me envolver tanto com estas personagens.
A Fable não me irritou nem um bocadinho, adorei a sua personalidade, a sua vontade de vencer na vida e dar uma vida melhor ao seu irmão, Owen.
Esta personagem será protagonista do 4º livro e estou em pulgas para o ler.O Drew acabou por ser uma personagem muito mais complexa que a Fable, vivendo um trauma que não consegue superar psicologicamente.
*BOOK II SPOILER AT THE END ! :) * ONE WEEK GIRLFRIED   is a beautiful story that revolves around drew and fable ...two lost souls broken in their own way..afraid to trust,...love...loose and be loved.the story starts out predictably,with the young rich troubled hero hiring the poorly deprived ,overtime working heroine to play the role of the one week girlfriend with all deals and feeling drawn up to the golden rule thou shall not fall in love.  when its EXACTLY what they end up finding themselv
The way she’s looking at me with all that pent up longing in her gaze tells me I still have a chance too.“Too late to meet with you after.” Reaching out, she pushes at my chest, her slender hands resting on my front and I hiss in a breath as if she burned me.But shit.
She’s quivering, little shuddering breaths escape from her parted lips and I close my eyes, desperate to calm the pounding of my heart as I nuzzle the side of her face.
I can’t let her think this is over between us.She still keeps her face averted, as if she’s afraid to look me in the eyes.
Me ha gustado mucho. La verdad se me ocurren miles de palabras groseras para decirle a Adele y solo espero que en la segunda parte no salga tanto. Si no, podría cometer asesinato imaginario... muuuuuuy sangriento. ¡Me encantaron los protagonistas! Y aunque es un libro cortito y con final abierto es más un 3.5 que 3. Por cierto, todos los clichés a lo Pretty woman... bueno, me encantaron Hahaha
Ich liebe Monica Murphys Bücher. Kann man einfach mal an einem Abend verschlingen so ein Teil. Sie schreibt aber einfach so schön. Gefühlvoll und trotzdem sexy. Tolle Charaktere, beide Protagonisten sehr sympathisch. Klar wie immer ziemlich viel Drama, Young Adult halt... Aber alles in allem eine super tolle leichte Geschichte für zwischendurch :)
4 FLUFFY MARSHMALLOW SHAPED STARS!I couldn't help rounding this debut novel up to four stars, simply because of the steam factor and the over-the-top angst and drama.
He needs Fable more than he thinks.
Maybe Fable & Drew will fill each others' emptiness.
Maybe Drew will appreciate her.
***OVERALL: - I was impressed with the story for a debut novel!
- The steam factor = turned ON & UP.
- I figured out the "twist" earlier on in the story, but still, when everything was revealed, I was no less repulsed, angry, and shaking with rage.
Drew better WORK to get Fable back!
**ARC copy provided by author for honest review****Reviews can also be found on blog**http://realitybites-letsgetlost.blogs...As you have probably gathered from the summary for this book, Drew is hiding something.
Fable...let me just say I love the uniqueness of her name!..is not interested in entertaining Drew's offer.
She knows early on there is more going on than Drew is willing to disclose.
Since this whole relationship is a fake, Drew and Fable work out the details of how they met, how long they have been together, etc.
So she comes up with a plan to save Drew if he should need to be rescued for any reason.
É um romance muito fofo e cheio de histórias não contadas, nomeadamente da parte do Drew. Não estava, sinceramente, à espera de gostar tanto. Comprei-o porque estava em promoção e como já tinha lido algumas opiniões positivas, porque não? O único senão é que é pequenino! Lê-se num ápice e acabamos por querer mais.Also, protect Drew Callahan at all costs <3
She knows early on there is more going on than Drew is willing to disclose.
Being the only ones who can understand each other.Fable is the lead female character,she is strong and not a whining virgin.
I love that she is the one that is strong over the big hunky jock that is Drew Callahan.
Drew...is so fucking hot!!!!I am in love with him!!!!He is so surprised by Fable and all that she can give him its touching.
The sex scenes was so hot and yummy :) !!!!What can I say about the end????I NEED THE SECOND BOOK RIGHT NOW!!!!!!!!!!
4.75 starsMost people know this about me but I don't read the book blurbs or reviews before I read a book. I just look at how many stars my friends are giving the book.

They come up with a code word- Marshmallow when they need saving.I'm thankful book 2 comes out very soon (April 2nd) because we are left with: M-A-R-S-H-M-A-L-L-O-W!SERIES:
Book one has a cliffhanger.
Book two concludes their story.
Book three and four are spinoffs.["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>
The writing style is really good and easy to read, and the romance is as fluffy as marshmallows.
Fable is the breadwinner of her family and takes the opportunity since her mom can't do a better job and she wants to provide a good life for her little brother.
Drew knows that his family wouldn't like her because she has a bad reputation but there's more to that and Fable sensed Drew is hiding a deep, dark secret that makes him imperfect.The plot twist is predictable.
Though I made the right guess about Drew's secret, my heart still cracks a little for him [I loathe her step-mother with burning passion].
LOVED it!!!!! Drew and Fable are perfect together!!!
Well then.........Holy shit that was unexpected........4.5 stars.......I went in pretty blindsided and not knowing much about the book (I skipped reading the reviews this time).
As I started reading more amd more, I figured out Drew's demons almost right off the bat.
Poor girl.I liked her.
I mean I REALLY liked Fable.
Most of the times the female lead irks me to no ends but in this book Fable was a tough cookie that I could deal with.
She and Drew were good together.
Now, I just need the next book so I know what happens to these lost and sad souls.
Oh. My. Lord. How can I possibly explain to you how much I loved this book???? I NEED more Fable and Drew ASAP. marshmallow!!!!!!!!I can't recommend this book enough. Excellent and beautiful and sad and heartbreaking and loving. It's a million things.
