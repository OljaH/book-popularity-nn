Cute wee story. The only time Poirot did not completely solve the crime. Or, at least that’s what he said. I was quite surprised at who the murderer was. 🤔
One of my favourite short stories featuring our little Belgian and dapper Captain, in which the former recounts to the latter one of the cases where his "little grey cells" faulted. Remarkable.
A delicious box of chocolates. :)
This was a nice story that Poirot tells Hastings about a case where Poirot actually didn't solve the mystery correctly! It was a fun, quick read, and it did make me wonder why more of Agatha Christie's novels can't be this succinct! Or at least a little bit shorter. :)
It was a case that took place years back when he was a detective on the Belgium Police Force.
When the killer admits their guilt, Poirot is annoyed with the fact that he did not come to the right conclusion even with the evidence staring him right in the face.This was a great little quick read.
I have stated over and over how wonderful a writer Agatha Christie is and how her characters are so perfect.
Her storyline lay out the perfect murder but it is never easy to come to the truth as you think.
Makes for a great read.

Hercule Poirot is asked by his good friend Captain Hastings if he's ever failed a case.
This leads Poirot to recount the tale of his only failure: an old case involving the mysterious death of a controversial french politician and a box of chocolates.Out of all the Agatha Christie short stories I've read so far, this is my favorite.
It might be a very brief mystery, but it's conclusion definitely leaves a great impact (I actually cried out in astonishment when Poirot revealed why he considers the case a failure.) Without spoiling anything, I will say that although Christie uses a bit of misdirection here, the truth is still there the whole time and when Poirot comes to the end of his tale, you will be wondering why you didn't see it!Overall, The Chocolate Box is a brilliant mystery.
This is a story of a case in which Poirot actually failed to solve the case - or did he? And the clue was all in the chocolate box.As it usually is with Agatha Christie's mysteries, everything makes perfect sense in the end and you realize - much as Poirot did - that you had all the clues to solve the mystery yourself! It was a good short, and as always, Agatha Christie is flawless, but it was too quick to leave a huge impression.
I'd seen the tv adaptation several time and can picture David Suchet perfectly while reading. of course the tv show was added o and plumped out but the details were the same.
A great short story that kept me guessing until the end.

Hastings and Poirot are talking one evening.
Poirot tells the story of his greatest failure as a detective.It was when he was still a detective in Belgium.
A distraught woman hires him to find out who killed her lover.
Prior notices a box of chocolates with a different colored lid from the bottom: after talking with the servants, a box with reversed colors is retrieved from the garbage.
Poirot believes it is a particular person, but is summoned by the deceased's mother.
(view spoiler)[ The mother killed her son.
She knew him to be a bad man: he had killed his wife and seduced another girl.
(hide spoiler)]
This is a short story, not the tradition book one expects from Christie.In this story, Poirot tells Hastings about a case he failed to solve. The case involves a Chocolate Box, of course, and the inhabitants of the home of a wealthy owner who is murdered. Worth reading as long as you realize it is only 36 pages or so (on my Kindle).
Murder, mystery, and the little grey cells. If you like Sherlock Holmes stories then you will love Hercule Poirot stories! Fun fact, Poirot was the only fictional character to receive an obituary on the front page of The New York Times on August 6, 1975.
ClassicClassicThis was a beautifully well written good old fashioned murder mystery tale. I just love Hercule Poirot and how his little gray cells work. Truly delightful:)Mrs. Ford
I like how even when he fails, he still keeps up his wonderful arogance
Short but sweet ;)
Good short story
Good. StoryCompared with other stories this story ended tamely . it did not have the gripping suspense like other stories of the same author
This brief murder mystery is about the investigation of Hercule Poirot on the mysterious death of a French politician, in which the only clue was a box of chocolates.
Enjoyable story specially that it talks about Poirot when he was still a policeman.
Wow, that was one of my favorites short stories. Great storyline, very interesting.
