5- I more than a lot liked this book- stars!!! This book hooked me from the start and I couldn’t put it down. Loved every single page! I’m going to throw this out at the very beginning of my review- this one is going straight to the favorites shelf! In one night my fairytale ended... or it may have begun. It’s just one day. 24 hours. But for Mikayla, that one day alters her entire life. Kayla’s life was pretty great. She had fun and awesome parents, a sweet little sister, a best friend- Megan, a
As time goes on, Jake and his family and friends are exactly what Kayla needs to heal and try to get on with her life.
All Jake ever wanted was to be there for Kayla, to take care of her, love her.
Kayla knows how she feels about Jake.
It’s just getting to the point in her life when Kayla feels complete enough to be with Jake wholly that is difficult.
Because if I compare my feelings for Jake to anyone else, then I know.
I know I touched on this a little bit before, but Jake Andrews...

SPOILER FREE REVIEW -mature content reader discretion is advised.5 STARS out of 5Genre:New Adult Romance2013 FAVORITEThat moment when you find a book you love..and can barely contain your excitement because you want to share it with EVERY ONEIt can’t be just me… You have to read this book I cannot be alone in this love fest.
Mikayla quickly learns that Jake is, The Jake Andrews, an all star baseball pitcher and predicted to go pro.A very close friendship blooms between them; at times it is so intimate that I felt like I was intruding on all the moments they would share.
(SPOILERS ahead...) It took every ounce of control I had not to DNF this book. It's one of the most unrealistic stories I've ever come across with!Here are the reasons why I didn't like it:UNREALISTIC PLOT - This is a work of fiction, I know. But why make the whole thing unbelievable to the extreme? Mikayla found out one day that her boyfriend cheated on her with her best friend. That same day, she also met the gorgeous guy with a sexy Aussie accent named Jake and well, instantly felt attracted
That same day, she also met the gorgeous guy with a sexy Aussie accent named Jake and well, instantly felt attracted to him.
like how Jake is so damn sexy and how his accent always gets her and so forth and so on.
Insta-love big time!!!SIDE CHARACTERS - Why everyone that is close to Jake treats Mikayla like the way they treat an old-time friend confuses me.
They've just met her and then, just like that?
I cannot bring myself to recommend this book to others because it's completely over-the-top .
Much as I tried, I just couldn't like this book.
4.5 STARS More Than This is book one in the More Than series by Jay McLean. This book was recommended to me by two different friends but I hadn’t really read many reviews so it took me by completely by surprise. I WAS NOT prepared for all the feels, and let me tell you, there are plenty. And the hotness factor, oh my gosh, was off the charts.  Mikayla is eighteen years old, just two weeks away from graduation, and it’s prom night. She is going with her boyfriend of four years, James, and her bes
Mikayla is eighteen years old, just two weeks away from graduation, and it’s prom night.
Jake is also eighteen years old.
After the horrors of that night, Jake’s family takes her in and Jake is by her side every step of the way.
Jake knows he is in love with Kayla but he can’t tell her, not yet.
Kayla knows she is in love with Jake as well.
Jake, his family and his friends all giving Mikayla the love and strength she needs to get through the most difficult of times.
Luckily, the ending delivered some more of that awesomeness I was longing for!More Than This kicks off to a highly intense start: We are introduced to Mikayla, who is having a pretty crappy prom night, only to learn than things will shortly go from bad to worse.
Jake unleashes his possessive, dominant side that was both highly sexy and slightly bewildering.
However, he was a true sweetheart and an amazingly sexy hero!Although this story did sometimes yoyo my emotions, overall, it was a great read with beautiful messages of pain, healing, friendship, and love.
Very steamy!▪ Romance: Intense and healing.
▪	 Characters: Sexy, possessive, and sweet hero.
2.5 StarsMaybe I've just read too many things similar to this and thus the blush is off the rose...but this pretty much sums it up for me:Don't get me wrong, Jake was cute and I liked him and all...but Kayla and her cock teasing ways were really starting to make me want to slap a bitch.Two words: Blue.
Balls.
Not nice, Kayla.
Even I was getting sexually frustrated, and I don't even have balls.
Something else random that annoyed me?
This quote:"If I compare my feelings for Jake to my feelings for James, then I know I've never loved anyone before.
Jay McLean… I FUCKING LOVE YOU!! Seriously your words, this story, the characters, the emotions.. THE GODDAMN EMOTIONS!!… It just blew me away! You blew me away. I can’t believe that this is a debut novel!God I love Indie authors!So seriously dude  I know some people out there have been haters, due to a few grammatical errors etc, but seriously..  If you’re that into the story you don’t worry about those things. But I saw that you said you’re fixing the errors.Ok now onto this story… Shit peeps
I’m swear I’m not a pyscho,” he continues… Look, I just don’t think you should let bad people dictate what should be a good time.
Like we shared and experience and that somehow made us closer, but Lisa,” Kayla looks up at us now… “Jake, he makes things hurt a little less.
“Hey Jake?” “Yeah Kayla?” He’s almost asleep.
It feels so intimate, like we’re more than what we are.
NOTE – THERE IS NO CLIFFHANGER… IT’S JUST THE LAST PAGE CHANGES INTO SOMEONE ELSE’S POV AND THE SHIT THEY THINK???

Well, Jake was at the right place at the right time and suggests Mikayla spend prom night with him and his friends.
Mikayla agrees.The whole read was perfection and I really loved the beginning.
I thought Mikayla (Kayla) and Jake had an adorable meet-cute.
I loved Jake's friends and the McLean wrote some fantastic side characters.
Because of the shift Kayla and Jake become closer.
I thought Kayla and Jake were perfectly written characters.
I loved Kayla.
Jake = Book Boyfriend.
Am I using "LOVE" a lot?
MY EVERY FUCKING THINGMIKAYLA ~ this beautifully broken girl....her world collapsedI WILL NOT LET BAD PEOPLE DICTATE WHAT SHOULD BE A GOOD LIFEI pretty much was in tears for the better part of this book !
Her PROM night....uggggg...her family.....I just wanted to reach into this book and hug her...how much more can one girl take ???Mikayla has an instant connection with Jake.
I was perfectly content with him just holding her....and trust me....that's a LOT of what happened.
TOTALLY WORTH THE WAIT :)I THINK I'M IN LOVE WITH THIS BEAUTIFUL BROKEN GIRL
I MORE THAN A LOT LUV YA GIRL !!!
THIS BOOK WAS AMAZING !!!
Find all of my reviews at: http://52bookminimum.blogspot.com/I was going to call this one “Hey, I just met you . . . and this is crazy, but my family just croaked so I’m going to move in to your house and have a completely unhealthy relationship with you maybe,” but I decided to go with something a little classier instead . . .   “Nothing says awkward like coming in your pants while dry humping.” If you’re only interested in the Cliff’s Notes version, here it is . . . The long version is Mikayla
Along comes Jake, a boy from another school with a smexy accent and a hero complex who decides to whisk her away to his own prom for the evening.
When Jake returns Mikayla home from their magical evening she discovers her entire family has been murdered .
and Jake can become a psycho who doesn't like "his girl" talking to - well, pretty much anyone at all .
We spend the next gazillion 250 or so pages dealing with the budding romance of the girl who has never experienced an "O Face" and the boy who brings it to her - via an epic bout of dry humping .
FOUR MORE THAN STARS. I think I'm in love with this beautifully broken girl. Why, oh why, oh why, did I wait so long to start this series? It's been under my nose for so long, so many of my friends have read, devoured and adored this series and here I am only just starting this epic 'more than' marathon. I can only say that I'm an idiot, but at least right now I'm a happy idiot and blissfully enjoying the start of my Jay McLean type book binge. From prologue to epilogue this book had me wrapped
There wasn't much not to love about this author and her writing style, I for one feel hooked and I'm hoping to love the rest of the series just as much, (if not more).What did I love?Jay McLean books are definitely shaping up to be paperback worthy treasures.
I really could not be any happier than I am right now, as well as this book taking me out of a reading rut, I've also managed to discover a new author to love and a series that I can't wait to read the rest of (this is officially a happy book day).
I have joked I am the last person on GR to read this series and that is probably true, but if you like me have not read this series yet JUST DO IT!!When the story starts we meet Mikayla.
Kayla and Jake meet and from the that moment they have this connection.
I love how Kayla wanted to be more before things could progress, and I loved how Jake was patient and consistent.
I have read so many books this year and this series is definitely a favorite.
*****Warning this review contains spoilers******I completely and utterly Loved this book!!!What a beautiful story!!This is a sad and oh so sweet story"I feel sorry for all the girls in the world that never get to experience a Jake Andrews at least once in their lifetime."This is a story of the end and the beginning of the life which Mikayla knew..The night which was supposed to be her beautiful fairytale...
"I think I’m in love with this beautifully broken girl.""It’s this moment I know, I don’t think anymore.
** FULL REVIEW NOW POSTED ** "In one night my fairytale ended. Or it may have begun..." More Than This  was a very sweet and sometimes heartbreaking book about love, loss, healing and friendship. It was laced with some sadness following a horrific tragedy but the feeling of the book was more focused on healing, rebuilding and finding happiness again.I loved the hero and the core group of characters and will be looking forward to the next in the series.

It was laced with some sadness following a horrific tragedy but the feeling of the book was more focused on healing, rebuilding and finding happiness again.I loved the hero and the core group of characters and will be looking forward to the next in the series.
This one however reads a complete standalone with a happy ending :)So, about the book...Mikayla's life fell apart the night her boyfriend of four years cheated on her.
Jake was giving her time to grieve and Mikayla needed to to just heal and also felt like she had to stand on her own before she could fully allow herself to fall in love.
Everything she has always believed in is proved to have been a lie.The one thing that anchors her and prevents her from drifting away is Jake.
Nothing has ever distracted has ever meant more than this, until Mikayla comes into his life.
It's up to Jake to show her that he can help her, that pushing him away is the worst thing she could do.
I liked Mikayla too, although her logic was a bit exasperating at times, but it was understandable, seeing as she had gone through something traumatic.

This is the first new adult novel I’ve ever read (listened to on an audiobook).
I read probably one YA a year now that I’m no longer in junior high, which was one million years ago.
Then when there was all this explicit sex and swearing, I thought, my my, YA has changed.Duh. New adult.
Jake witnesses the drama and does his best to emotionally help Kayla.
Maybe because I listened to it instead of reading it, I kept getting confused by the many high school characters and the “romances” (hook-ups) and drama of teenage life.
I think this is probably a well-done novel for the genre.
THIS BOOK WAS TOTAL FANFUCKINGTASTIC!!!  IT WAS JUST........ This was a book I could not put down... it consumed me. This story.. this amazing story... is honestly unlike any other I've ever read. Most books follow the same formula as far as true love goes.. and this one did have a few predictable elements.. but what happens in the beginning to Kayla ( aka Mickey).. is like nothing I've ever read before.. well--- nothing put together like that before. Chick had some way serious things to overco
THIS BOOK WAS TOTAL FANFUCKINGTASTIC!!!
Most books follow the same formula as far as true love goes..
is like nothing I've ever read before..
this book made me feel like
And that sadness went on for a little while as it took time for Jake to heal Kayla's heart..
Jake was simply amazing...he's so strong and sweet and beautiful..
That night changed both of their lives, for the rest of their lives...Jake and Kayla do get their HEA..
I love books that are so much more than you anticipate....
This book was incredible.
***5 tender and loving "more than a lot" stars*** What a lovely and tender story!!! Yeah, i know it was heartbroken in the most part, but i like ever single moment inside that book!!!First of all, it was a book about kindness, strength and courage... About family and real friendship... And finally it was about love... The kind of love that never ends!!! The kind of love that from the first moment stand by you and become more that everything!!!Yeah, it was a messy situation but it was as α resul
Yeah, i know it was heartbroken in the most part, but i like ever single moment inside that book!!!First of all, it was a book about kindness, strength and courage...
The kind of love that from the first moment stand by you and become more that everything!!!Yeah, it was a messy situation but it was as α result of a disastrous beginning!!!Did i confuse you???
What she had to get through was heavy and unbarable...But i liked the fact that even though everybody that she loved and counted on them for almost all her life left her alone when she needed them the most, she finally found out unexpectantly kindness from people that never knew before...
*clears throat* I know you’ve heard this many times in the book, but I am so, so sorry for that night.
Or falling in love with….Mikayla: *blank stare, no answer*Me: Okaaaay then, I take that as “read the book to find out.” *mutters* Micky, what was you reaction when you first saw Jake, um, after that incident?Mikayla: I can’t believe accent boy just witnessed that whole thing.
I’m so glad I got a chance to speak with you!Mikayla: Okay then, thank you!Me: AAAAAAND CUT!
Like the first time I read it, this book grabbed me by the collar and dragged me in until I finished!
I had no idea what I was getting into when I picked this book out. It was on KU, so I thought... why not?I more than really really liked this book. More than really liked Kayla and I for sure really really more than liked Jake. More Than This was absolutely wonderful and heartbreaking. It is about high school/ college kids but the story is amazing. Now I'm on to Logan's story!
"Talking without speaking. Feeling without touching." I shouldn't like this book, but I really did. I've had all these issues with this genre lately, but I keep getting sucked into reading them. And sure, yeah...this story contained some of my pet peeves. It's pretty darn angsty. The setup is a bit off the charts, and so is the melodrama. But I was glued to these pages. I don't want to even say what happens within the first few chapters because I think it would spoil the story. I went into it w
There are his group of cohorts in the background...I'm seeing the guy in back as Logan...I love how Jake says...in such a self deprecating manner..."I'm kind of a big deal." What a cutie!!!There was a lot of funny in this book, which I didn't expect with all of the sad subject matter.
Oh, yeah...that Australian accent...freaking YUM!!!I also adore it when the author makes it apparent that she also is an avid reader, that she also has book boyfriends, and that she might actually obsess over them just like we do.
I adored this book. I loved every single second (even the frustrating ones). At its heart, this was a modern day fairytale about a “regular” girl. And, as all good fairytales do, it starts with a tragedy. Well, actually two tragedies. The first is the catalyst for Mikayla and Jake’s chance meeting. The second is what both keeps them together, and threatens to tear them apart. The thing that makes this story different, and sets it apart from the hundreds of other NA books I’ve read with similar t
The thing that makes this story different, and sets it apart from the hundreds of other NA books I’ve read with similar themes, is all in the execution.There was this amazing mix of humor and sweetness amidst the sadness, lust and swooning.
I loved how he took care of Kayla, and how basically from the moment they met, he was willing to do whatever it took for her to be ok.I appreciated how their relationship developed (even if I wanted to scream with frustration a few times).
The story is told in dual POV, so we get to see what both Mikayla and Jake are thinking.
*sigh* Mikayla's life changes forever the night of her prom.
More Than This is the story of Kayla and Jake.
And I don't want to tell you too much about how they met and how they fell in love because I think that will spoil so much of their story.
And what do you mean he's been in love with Mikayla???
(hide spoiler)] You were just setting up the next book to be his right?
You're not going to get crazy and make this a love triangle right???
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO MESS WITH JAKE AND KAYLA RIGHT????Good, because....["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>
Stars!More Than this is the first book I have read by Jay McLean, it is what I affectionately class as a ‘kitchen sinker’, in that it feels like the author has literally thrown as many tropes as she possibly can at it.
It will always only ever be just you.”I am late to the party with this series, but I kind of like that, because I now have 3 books I can read in succession and a new release due at some point in 2015.
This is the beautiful coming of age story of Kayla and Jake.
They meet on a night in which Kayla loses everything she loves and Jake was there to help keep her together.
The author did such a wonderful job depicting their pain, sorrow, joy, and intense chemistry.
Their commitment to each other was felt on every sentence, every page.
We were with Kayla as she went through the different stages of grief and we were with Jake as he was her rock.
I loved their chemistry.Every look, every touch was felt.
In Love.
This was a good story.....A very original storyline and it kept my attention and I had to find out what happened next. I got mad quite a bit during this book as well. I will say however the writing/grammar was a wee bit distracting for me so I cant give it a 5. Update 7/16/13 I have been told book was edited to remove legits! Authors do listen! Everyone cheer! Now go forth and read this book! Right NOW! Too many legits and too much slang. Sometimes it was funny and others it just got annoying. T

I will say however the writing/grammar was a wee bit distracting for me so I cant give it a 5.
Update 7/16/13 I have been told book was edited to remove legits!
Now go forth and read this book!
Too many legits and too much slang.
Sometimes it was funny and others it just got annoying.
The word "like" was in the book over 400 times but it didn't get on my nerves as much as the few times "legit" did."My dick legit twitches""I was legit 2 two seconds away from licking him.""I swear to God I legit swoon." Jake
5 Amazing Stars!In the most tragic night of her life Mikayla and realizing that her life will never be the same again, she finds the most unexpected silver lining in the middle of the darkness.On that night she finds Jake and trough the next months he will be her shoulder, her best friend and the only person she can completely rely on.
What I started reading expecting it to be a light NA book that I wouldn’t probably think twice about it, ended up becoming one of the most amazing readings I’ve read inside this genre.
“It's a small touch,our skin only lightly grazing,but it feels so intimate,like we're more than what we are.I know I want to be.I want to be more than this.”  More Than This is a sweet,tender,sexy,heartwarming story,that left me lightheaded and smiling!What can I say,cute romances are my guilty pleasure!Micky's whole world shattered in her prom night.She felt the sting of betrayal by two people she loved,and the only reason she didn't collapse from sorrow was a stranger who witnessed her drama
“It's a small touch,our skin only lightly grazing,but it feels so intimate,like we're more than what we are.I know I want to be.I want to be more than this.”
“I'm thinking that maybe I'm really far from more than a lot liking you, Mikayla Jones.”
5 ++++ STARS!!!!"So much more than a lot."Well, this one goes straight to my favorites shelve.Mikayla is living peaceful life with parents who adores her, little sister , her long term boyfriend James and best buddy Megan. But one moment changes it all. I pretty much devoured this book, couldn't stop reading it. I love Jake. He is so amazing."He was my Prince Charming. My White Knight. My Happy Ever After. My every fucking thing."<
