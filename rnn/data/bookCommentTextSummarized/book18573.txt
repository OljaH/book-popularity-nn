As I finished this book with tears running down my face I asked myself, "Why did you read this book?
He was not a saint, he cried when given a death sentence, but his thoughts were not always for him, he always wanted to make sure his wife had a life after he was gone.
So in many ways this was a profoundly beautiful read by a remarkable man.
His wife says it best, "What happened to Paul was tragic, but he was not a tragedy."
A gasping, desperate, powerful little book, bigger on the inside than outside. It's a little bit about dying, but more about being alive.
The author had an interesting career in his short life, mostly as a student.
he did his best and he was a good doctor, husband and father, and this was only his debut book.
You may disagree, you may feel that the three words I suggest - dawn came up, are no substitute for the 150 poetic, lyrical, descriptive ones the author wrote instead.
(view spoiler)["And then we would sit and watch as the first first hint of sunlight, a light tinge of day blue would leak out of the eastern horizon, slowly erasing the stars.
I was always told not to speak ill of the dead.
It is mildly interesting to learn about neurosurgery as a specialty and to read the author's thoughts as he faced diagnosis, illness and then death.
I always felt that the author was holding back; that it was too clinical, too calm, just not passionate enough.
The first time I felt that I was reading something worthwhile was in the 26 page epilogue by the author's wife.
I guess the best way to say it is this; this is a quick read.
I don't think you should read this book because the story of an incredibly gifted man who had his life taken away at such a young age might give you the motivation to live life more fully.
I think you should read this book because that talented, inspiring man has incredibly important things to say derived from his own experiences, and it's important to listen and learn from them.
Read this book with the knowledge that you might not always be able to understand everything someone goes through, but you can set aside the time to listen to their story and hopefully give them the dignity and respect they deserve as a human being, in life or death.
Do yourself a favour and don't listened to the ending of this book while doing your makeup...Theres no way to review a book where the author died too young from cancer leaving his wife and 8 months old baby behind without feeling like an asshole for not giving it 5 stars.That’s why more often than not, I don’t give a rating to the autobiographies I read.
I just don’t feel comfortable rating someone’s life.Cancer and the death of a close one is something most of us unfortunately can relate to and I think it’s why this book got so popular.I’m glad the author was able to write this book since it was his dream but in my opinion the best part of it was the epilogue from his wife.

Kalanithi with wife Lucy and Baby CadyI was going to try to write a longer review but my mind is not into it these days.All I can say this book will stay with me for a long time and everything good you've heard about how amazing it's well deserved.Sad, poignant, raw, beautiful...
He was still searching for answers to the question "what makes human life meaningful, even in the face of death and decay?"When he was in his fourth year medical school, he watched many classmates choose to specialize in less demanding areas, (radiology or dermatology for example).
Paul Kalanithi wrote this book - relentlessly- fueled with purpose during the last year of his life -- never got to finish his life's plan..( yet he still worked that last year)....
There is a beautiful - but so sad- Epilogue by Lucy - from Paul's wife at the end of the book.
I don't want to pull back the curtain too far on my life, but I've seen the havoc cancer causes out of nowhere in people's lives.
All this cancer and death hitting so close to home left me in this weird phase two years ago where I got to learn what a panic attack feels like.
It's like having a heart attack, but not really, but close.
I think cancer blasting through my family while I was in the process of trying to move across the country just really shook me up.
Never has a book turned me into a sad sobbing mess so quickly. Philosophical, beautiful, moving, difficult, heartbreaking. Highly, HIGHLY recommend.
Unforgettable is what Verghese says in his foreword.
I agree and am fighting for my own breath to write my thoughts about this stunning memoir that has left me gasping for air.
The writing.
The emotion.
The beauty in the darkness of dying.
I mourn the death of this writer, a surgeon of great potential.
A doctor of great compassion.
But the message he has left us is quite eloquently simple: make life as meaningful as you can in the time you have.
Be grateful.
The touching epilogue his wife Lucy wrote.My tears runneth over.
5⭐️ - have upped this.
Unlike Paul and Lucy we did not have an extended family to support us.
Unlike Paul and Lucy we adopted.
The book is very well written and Paul had a gift for including just the right amount of medical detail and jargon.
If you are getting the impression that he comes across as lacking real depth you not only broke the code you read between the lines.The book is very well written and at times absorbing, but it left me wondering, was that all there was to Paul and Lucy?
It is not an ugly death - for that the family is too well-trained in medicine to "fight" ultimately senseless fights, too well-acquainted with death to cause a fuss, too rich to die in a dump, too well-connected to suffer bad doctors.The last chapter written by the wife after his death is probably the best - still, I wouldn't recommend it, not much new, not that interesting [2].
As an undergraduate Kalanithi studied English literature and his love of reading and writing had been a constant through out his life.
He had always felt that when he was older he would like to write and had decided to focus on neurosurgery for now, where he could make a bigger difference by saving people's lives.
Kalanithi pens this memoir, dealing with the struggles of facing death and having to go from being able to save others lives to now be the one staring down mortality.
The writing was excellent but reading this memoir was so depressing.
When he finally decided to pursue a career in neurology, he wasn't just content to be a doctor—he wanted to understand and identify with his patients fully, to help them and their families adjust to whatever their new reality would be following a diagnosis, an accident, a surgery."I was pursuing medicine to bear witness to the twinned mysteries of death, its experiential and biological manifestations: at once deeply personal and utterly impersonal."At the age of 36, Paul was diagnosed with Stage IV lung cancer.
همین الان این کتاب رو تموم کردم که دارم این ریویو رو مینویسم.
ترجیح دادم نوشتنش بلافاصله باشه تا شاید بتونم حتی شده بخش کوچیکی از حسم نسبت به این کتاب رو انتقال بدم.خوندن این کتاب رو تموم کردم و قلبم فشرده شده و در عین حال از هیجان میکوبه.
فشردگی از غم و هیجان از آموختههای لذتبخش و سهیم شدن در جهانبینی عمیق یک انسانِ به واقع انسان.قصد داشتم کتاب رو جرعه جرعه بخونم تا لذت خوندنش برام تا مدتی ادامه پیدا کنه و بتونم بیشتر مست بشم و عمیقتر بهره ببرم اما خب افسوس که وقتی به چیزی بیش از اندازه لذتبخش

"To begin with -- or, maybe, to end with --I got to know Paul only after his death.
Paul was here for his personal alloted time.This book is divided into two sections: before cancer diagnosis and after cancer diagnosis.
But the perspective was all Paul's.The beginning of the book was both clinical and procedural.
She writes: "his transformation, from life to death, the ultimate transformation that awaits us all."When Breath Becomes Air should not be taken as a maudlin reading, but one of hope and one of living a life well, no matter what the promise of longevity reveals.
No part of my being accepts death; they all adjust the lens to view it as a part of life.Paul was a neurosurgeon by profession, and passion, at Stanford University School of Medicine.
The impact of this book is not in his sage-like, detached, professional treatment of his grave illness but in its earnestness; earnestness to detect vulnerabilities and find a path through them that eventually stands meaningful.
But she will continue to know his courage and feel his magic every time she will pick this book up.
As he was living out the end of his life, he wrote this brief powerful memoir.
And the final section is written by his wife after his death – she writes about his death, how he wrote the book and who he was to her.
It makes for a very sad book -- not because Kalanithi is melodramatic or self-pitying – quite the contrary -- but because as I read and savoured his prose and thoughts I couldn't help feeling the sense of a life cut far too short.
Imagine being sick and dying slowly, without knowing how long you have left.Long enough to keep going on as you did before: working, planning, and dreaming of a future, or long enough to live life like there is no tomorrow?Paul’s calling—neurosurgery—pulled him back to work even as he knew he was ill, because he couldn’t envision leaving it behind to focus on making the most of the perhaps little (or long) time he has left.
Even though the book is incredibly sad, it is ultimately life affirming and worth the emotional investment.At the age of thirty-six, Paul Kalanthi, a doctor nearing the completion of his neurosurgeon training, is diagnosed with stage IV lung cancer.
Paul, convinced that he would not go into medicine, decides to major in English literature but also completes a degree in human biology because of his fascination with the brain.
You decide you want to spend your time working as a neurosurgeon, but two months later you may feel differently...Death may be a one-time event, but living with terminal illness is a process." Paul never claims to have the answers, but he perseveres and continues to live.
The grace with which he navigates his journey – from a top-rated surgical resident to writer to his most important role of all, husband and father of a young daughter – his book is ample testimony to how one life well-lived can continue to create such a great impact.In the foreword by fellow doctor and writer Abraham Verghese, that doctor writes, “He (Paul) wasn’t writing about anything—he was writing about time and what it meant to him now, in the context of his illness.” And in the afterword by his wife Lucy, the meaning of that time becomes even clearer.
He was the harried neurosurgery resident making life and death decisions and marveling at the workings of the brain; in a trice he was the patient with terminal lung cancer wondering how to make the most of his remaining time with his family.Yet in both roles his question was always “What makes human life meaningful?” – a quest that kept him shuttling between science, literature and religion.
Here’s one I would recommend to anyone for the beauty of its prose – a fine blend of literature and medicine – and the simple yet wholehearted picture of a life cut short.Paul Kalanithi was 36 and just completing his neurosurgery residency in Stanford, California when he was diagnosed with advanced lung cancer that did not respond well to treatment.
This was such a beautiful, touching book! Not going to lie, the epilogue by Paul's wife nearly made me cry. SO GOOD. I also highly recommend the audiobook, although the narrator's voice was so soothing that sometimes I found myself not listening to him speak... my bad.

“Thank you for loving me.”My heart is full!
I was not expecting for this book to have the impact on me that it did.
What a beautiful account of a man who truly lived his life to the fullest, despite dying quite young.
He gave an incredible and resilient narrative on dealing and living with lung cancer and it unexpectedly shortening your life, but fighting through it despite all odds.
Creating a new life, a new dream in that present moment and not letting the prospect of death stop you from living a life full of passion and hope.
It also overflows with wisdom and Dr. Kalanithi’s moving quest for meaning; a quest he began at an early age and one that guided him throughout his life.A neurosurgeon and neuroscientist who won awards and whose work was sought after by many institutions as well as individuals, Dr. Kalanithi chose a path that was both intensely specialized and emotionally draining.
I feel as though I had experienced the entire range of human emotion while reading this novel, and I learned so much about both the frailty of human life and its heroic strength.This is a book that, even more than usual, will be experienced differently by each person.
If you liked Tuesday's With Morrie, you'll enjoy this memoir about a neurosurgeon who contracts cancer at 39.
This novel is about a man's honest search for meaning in life in his journey toward the grave.
The memoir was written in the last year of the Paul's life and was unfinished because of the progression of his cancer.
But the memoir gives you a terrific insight of the reality of being a doctor vs.
If you ever thought of being a doctor and/or you ever wanted to answer the BIG questions, this is a great memoir for you.
چقدر دلم می سوزه وقتی می بینم هدف زندگی هامون فقط شده جنگیدن واسه زنده موندن در حالی که اصلا از اول قرار بود زنده بودن حقمون باشه و رسیدن به هدفها و آرزوهامون دلیل اومدنمون به این دنیا خوندن این کتاب شاید تلنگری باشه برای من و امثال من که به دنیا اومدنشون تو کشوری مثل ایران رو بهونه ی نرسیدن به تمام آرزوهاشون کردن و منتظر هستن یک بار دیگه یک گوشه ی دیگه از دنیا دوباره از نو متولد بشن تا به هدف های از دست رفتشون رنگی از واقعیت بزننما آدم ها ممکنه از یک منظر موجودات تحسین برانگیزی باشیم اما قطعا اینم خودخواهی ماست اگر فکر کنیم که بقیه باید درست مثل ما باشن و شرایط ما رو تجربه کرده باشن تا سرانجامی مثل ما داشته باشنو در آخر به قول قهرمان داستان  همه ی زندگی این است که بدانی ورق ها به گونه ای جور می شوند که تو بازنده باشی که دست تو یا نظر تو نادیده گرفته می شود در حالی که هنوز برای پیروزی می جنگی و با اینکه می دانی هرگز نمیتوانی به کمال برسی، اما میتوانی نزدیک شدن به چیزی را که پیوسته برایش تلاش میکنی باور داشته باشی
He quotes a lot of literature, especially Joyce and Beckett, but I wish he had explored in more depth what he got from books.It feels churlish to critique the writing of such a multi-talented man who never got to finesse the manuscript in book form with an editor, but surely someone at Random House could have made some of these sentences more graceful: How little do doctors understand the hells through which we put patients.
