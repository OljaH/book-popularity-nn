The heroine(if you want to call her that) is insufferable and lies so much with every breath that you can't tell what's true or not and you just want to smack her and get her to tell the truth-doing that would've saved at least 1/3 of the book.Cora is given the crappy childhood trope with a mom who is basically the German version of Margaret White and the dad is constantly fixated on having sex with his wife.Overall, a real waste of time read.PS:If you don't want to have to slog through this, I'll spoil the beans on the crappy twist of the book:Cora kills Frankie Frankenberg while on a public beach with her husband and son.
Frankie turns out to be the person who killed her sister Magdalena (who had heart and organ defects) while having sex with her during a basement party while Cora was being raped by his two friends.
The Sinner is one of the darkest, most psychologically disturbing stories I ever have read and yet there never was a moment that I considered putting down this horrifying, captivating tale.
The book begins very blandly with a young woman who is quite boring, who is bored with life, her husband - although he is a good husband she says - her entire world has become unbearable and thus she has decided to commit suicide.
From that moment forward we, the reader, watch as her mind untangles and disintegrates before our very eyes and the most horrifying tales of abuse are laid out before you for inspection.
Her closeness with her father creates a complex relationship with him, whilst he is kind and caring towards his daughter, his failure to take firm action in the face of her mother Elsbeth's more extreme behaviour makes him a weak figure, difficult to maintain respect, love and affection for.
Bender's ill sister, Magdalena, should have died many times in her childhood, somehow managing to cling to life, she is the centre of her mother's world, swamping everything and everyone with her requirements, draining the families financial as well as emotional resources, isolating them.
I don't know what to say about this book.I'm giving it 3 Stars because that's what I usually give books I'm not sure about.
I spent the majority of this book not having one clue what was happening.
I don't know if maybe something was lost in translation, this book was translated from German.
I don't know.I was still completely hooked and considered it a fast read.
Im happy I read it and I now plan on watching the tv show.
Hopefully the show will be easier to follow.No recommendation for this one.A Book for all Seasons Book Club.
However, I can't give that one a check considering that the only reason it wasn't predictable was because it was so hard to tell what the hell was going on.The narration in this book was all over the place.
I don't know if my reaction to this is due to the author or to the author's translator, but the fact remains that this book had an intriguing premise, but the payoff wasn't enough to slog through 300 pages of twisted games (and not in the good way), confusing narration, and boring side plots.

I am usually fine with translated books (take all of Fredrik Backman's books for example), but maybe this one is better read in German??I do have to note that I only skimmed like one small part of this book.
I skimmed a little bit of Cora's thoughts about her nutty mom's Jesus ramblings, but that was about it and it was very near the end of the book (it was all things you have heard before).
3.5
Dark and disturbing read, but so well written.
As soon as I heard of this book and read the synopsis it just called to me.
Then I started reading all the mixed reviews.
I think some of the negative reviews actually helped me enjoy this reading experience.
Most people complained that it was incredibly confusing so I prepared myself for this.
I think knowing this ahead of time made me concentrate on what I was reading more.
And it is confusing because everything this woman says is a lie or is it?
I will say that this book had so many icky moments.
So, ah, be prepared for that.
A book of genre fiction in translation: Mystery ThrillerWatching the TV series I was completely absorbed by Jessica Biel‚Äôs performance and by all the craziness that happened to her character as it was being unravelled.
Because it isn‚Äôt the whodunit type of book, rather one where you find out why the main character acted the way she did, I thought I‚Äôd give it a try after some time had passed.
Because I found Cora‚Äôs character fascinating and the book certainly delivers, in that her personality is even more complex than in the adaptation, because even though I knew what had happened it still managed to grip me, and because I found Cora‚Äôs relationship with the detective - given the differences - refreshing.
this was like a slap in the frigging face.
This book is well writen and should be read before watching TV series... Still without a publisher in Serbia
Gone Girl meets Girl on a Train meets Girl with a Dragon Tattoo.
There are witnesses and Cora‚Äôs own confession but the police commissioner does his own investigation into Cora‚Äôs past, uncovering secrets even Cora has trouble remembering.I, like many others, was pulled in by the trailer for the USA mini-series starring Jessica Biel.
I figured the book had to be good to have been made into a TV series.
But it really dragged for me and I can‚Äôt count the times that I thought of putting the book down for good.
I‚Äôve recorded the TV series and will probably watch it even though I now know what‚Äôs going to happen.
What a fascinating story.
I saw the preview for the new USA show and wanted to give the book a try.
I've never read Petra Hammesfahr before, but will definitely be looking for more.
It's hard to imagine a book that begins with a murder in the first few chapters and spends the rest of the time delving into the reasons behind it could be so riveting, but I really couldn't put it down.
Cora is an incredibly complex character and it's so easy to become one of the many experts around her, trying to sort out the lies from the truth.
However, with The Sinner, I can‚Äôt help but feel that an awful lot was lost in translation as this novel felt very disjointed and lacked fluidity, making it a very slow read.
Maybe, some things just read better in German!However, this feeling of disjointedness could just as easily be a result of the plot itself ‚Äì Cora is so clearly disturbed and in her ramblings, she is revealing some truth and a lot of lies.
Police Commissioner Grovian [and the reader] have to try and separate the fact from the fiction; so, it may well have been this that caused the disjointedness as you‚Äôre not privy to the entire truth until the end of the novel.
I picked this one up because of the upcoming television show based on it, but now I hope the adaptation is better than the book!
(Spoilers ahead!...) I can't believe how long it took me to finish it, and when I finally read the last page I was like "really?
That's it?" It took me 3 times as long to finish this book than any other I've read in a long time.
for a change, but past that I don't think it needed nearly half of the book to show that she had a rough childhood and a traumatic experience to cause her to kill a man in cold blood.
Her plan is simple, go to the beach with her husband and two year old son, swim out deep, and drown.
There are several eye witnesses, and Cora readily admits to the murder, but all that isn't enough for Police Commissioner Rudolf Grovian.
He wants to know why, and he won't stop until he breaks down the wall in Cora's mind that hides the black time.THE SINNER is the story of Grovian's investigation into Cora's past.
Cora's world in all its variations stayed with me even when my schedule dictated I put the book down.
A young mother, Cora Bender, seemingly content with her husband and little son, suddenly stabs out at a man in a beach as he makes out with his wife, and kills him brutally.
As she grows up, she faces the constant contempt of her mother; her sister then begins to live life vicariously through her, even going so far as to attempt to persuade Cora into prostitution.
Perhaps it is this tragedy that has coloured her life, and the demons that were driven deep into her psyche suddenly emerged on that beach that sunny day and caused her to kill?
(view spoiler)[I don't know how I managed to read it while shaking my head but it was so horrible.
(hide spoiler)]Question about the end: (view spoiler)[Did Frankie's father insert heroin into Cora for 6 months against her will or did he just eff up her arms to make it LOOK like she was a heroin addict?
(hide spoiler)]The whole time I was reading this I thought I'd probably give it 3 stars, maybe less if the ending was bad but now that it's over I have to give it 4 and recommend it.
Giving up on this.
How they made such a fantastically complex TV show from the basis of such a erratic and confused novel is beyond me.
I'm going to blame a lot of my problems with this on the translation.
It's not awful, but most of the characters are.
I'm so pleased they made Cora and her husband more likeable and more conflicted characters than the novel originally has them.
The TV show also does a better job at unfolding the layers of this complex story in a more gripping way.
Not sure if the ending is the same, because I didn't get that far.
This is an impressive and compelling book. A traumatically abused woman from a very creepy dysfunctional family who has had severe head injuries gradually reveals her story and why she apparently randomly killed a man. Not exactly light summer reading, though.
Beyond boring.
Now that I have read it, courtesy of the Bitter Lemon Press, I can understand why.On a sunny Sunday afternoon in the park a woman, Cora Bender, stabs a man in front of her family and his friends.
Because Police Commissioner Rudolf Grovian isn‚Äôt satisfied and isn‚Äôt prepared to close the case until he understands why.The book was compelling up to this point, but from here it climbs to another level.Cora begins to talk.
But Grovian finds lies and deception.
Slowly the real and terrible truth about Cora‚Äôs past emerges.The Sinner is brilliantly constructed.
Cora keeps changing her story and my perception of her kept changing.
I suspect that this book will not be for everyone but it is worth the effort.The beginning of this story finds us meeting Cora bender a young woman in a claustrophobic marriage who is starting to exhibit strange behaviours particularly around her husband.They go to a local lido for a picnic and while suicidal thoughts haunt Cora a couple who are flaunting their love and playing a tape trigger a violent reaction from Cora.The remainder of the book focuses on why Cora committed the crime.
Initially I struggled with the structure of the book but as I continued i became hooked as the background to the cause of the crime is slowly exposed.
She liked life too, but hers had ceased to be a life.
We open with Cora Bender, who has decided to take her own life because her existence has ceased to be a life.
But when she goes to take her own life, she ends up instead taking that of a man at the lake she is about to drown herself in.After that I started to lose interest in the book as it flips between Cora as a child and Cora lying through her teeth to the detective often without clear breaks.
It is completely incomprehensible to the authorities and her family how she could do such a thing to a man she didn't know, although it makes perfect sense to Cora.
Throughout her early childhood, Cora despises Magdalena; however, she eventually comes to love her sister and to do whatever she can to make her life bearable.Obviously, there is huge damage to Cora's psyche from living such a psychological nightmare.
It's only after many, many interviews that Grovian feels that the truth has been revealed.The book has a very repetitive quality to it, in that Cora often tells the same story but with slightly different details.
Hum, what can I say about this book...psychological for sure. To read this novel through you really have to be "in the zone". I think, I restated it 3, maybe 4 times, before it caught. From other reviews, I felt this novel had an unusual draw. Once I settled into the rhythm it was a ride. Where was Cora was heading? What is she hoping to accomplish or avoid? The path of this journey is anything but predictable.
2.5 starsThank you to Penguin Books for my free giveaway copy.With all the hype surrounding the TV adaptation I was thrilled to have won a copy of The Sinner from Penguin Books.
Then it was voted in as one of @criminallygoodbookclub's reads so I was excited to have the nudge to pick it up.
I'm not sure if something got lost in translation, but it just didn't really work for me.
The only time I really enjoyed the story was when we got flashbacks to her childhood.
I was also not expecting so many religious undertones, though admittedly "The Sinner" should have been my first clue.
