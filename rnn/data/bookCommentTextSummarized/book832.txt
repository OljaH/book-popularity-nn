A classic. I like the historical mystery novels, so author is one of my mainstays. Free on Librivox.orgAndGutenberg.org
There are parts of it that feel like they have intense fictional elements about it, even though it was supposed to have been an eye-witness account of Rasputin's activities in Russia.
There are also non-fiction elements about the piece as well.
I did some research about the author, William Le Queux and discovered he had written 150 fictional books and a small number of books reported to be non-fictional, including The Minister of Evil: The Secret History of Rasputin's Betrayal of Russia.
I have watched films and documentaries about Rasputin over the years and this is the first piece of literature I've read on this notorious Russian.This is a fictional account of Rasputin's life based on facts - that is facts according to Le Queux.
With this being written within a couple of years after Rasputin's assassination it's hard to know how much is true and what has been exaggerated.I recall a documentary on the events building to the 1917 Russian revolution, focusing on the Romanovs, yet Rasputin only gets a brief mention, yet according to this account he was Czar in all but name.
I am in aweThis book has taught me about this era in Russian/Germanic history that I had never known. Rasputin was by far one of the most evil men in history yet portrayed himself as a pious Saint. How blasphemous he was.
Loved it.
