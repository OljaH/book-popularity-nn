The story is fun and I didn't actually guess one of the guilty parties.I believe this was one of her earlier books and it was not as polished as her work usually is.
I also had to suspend belief more often than usual.
In the first few chapters when the doctor and Bobbie find a dying man on a cliff - the doctor goes for help leaving the unqualified young man in charge.
Pretty sure the young man should have run for help leaving the suitably qualified doctor to tend the dying.
It was a good story and it was fun.
Frankie and Bobby are bumbling amateurs!
He and Frankie decide that they'll look into the matter because there are some loose and flapping ends that Bobby knows but had no chance to say at the inquest.Hijinks quite predictably ensue.It was 80 years ago that the book was conceived and written, but the kinds of dumbass errors the amateurs make just got up my nose.
The first, in 1980, starred Francesca Annis and James Warwick (later stars of the very good Partners in Crime series featuring Dame Agatha's amateur sleuths Tommy and Tuppence) and was supremely faithful to the book.
The characters of Bobby Jones and Frankie Derwent (Lady Frances) are delightful and some parts of this book remind me of "The Seven Dials Mystery" which is not a bad thing."Why Didn't They Ask Evans?" begins with Bobby Jones and the local doctor playing golf when they realize that a man has fallen off a nearby cliff and is near death.
His childhood friend Lady Frances (Frankie) starts to think that something about the dead man is dangerous and could lead Bobby to his own end.
Amusing, mostly light (if you ignore the perfectly nice people who get murdered along the way) mystery featuring for once no actual detective. Not even amateur sleuths like Christie's Tommy and Tuppence -- here we have a bored Bright Young Thing and her reluctant pal investigating what everyone else says was an accidental death. The title seems like a spoiler but (view spoiler)[there are no actual boomerangs in this book. (hide spoiler)]My cover, excitingly, is even cheesier than the one displayed here.["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>

رواية رائعة بحق،دائما ما تتفوق أجاثا كريستي بأن تبقيني ساهرة كي أنهي روايتها في جلسة واحدة دون عن باقي الروائيين
There's a great chemistry between them, wit and humor to be had in the tale, a breezy readable style, action and suspense, and of course I was drawn in by the mystery.But there are a number of problems I wouldn't expect from a Christie, although I guess when you write over 80 novels in a career, some are bound to be misfires.
Despite their stupidity, I did like Bobby and Frankie and that and those loose ends I wanted to see tied up kept me reading--but really, below average for a mystery and seriously sub-par for the writer of Murder on the Orient Express and And Then There Were None.
Cerita pembunuhannya sendiri kurang menarik,yang membuat menarik,sangat menarik malahan latar belakangnya dan kata kata terakhir korban "mengapa mereka tidak memanggil evans?
yang membuat penasaran dan memulai petualangan bobby dan frankie.
yang pada akhirnya membawa mereka kembali ke wisma pendeta.good!Aku sangat suka dengan karakter Lady Frances Derwent aka Frankie yang di gambarkan tante Agatha Christie yang menurut saya agak sempurna,lucu,pemberani,dari keluarga kaya.aku mau lah kalau ada lagi karakter kaya gini di bukunya yang lain.Kurang suka dengan kisah cinta dan perjodohan frankie dan bobby yang agak dipaksakan.mungkin berteman saja sudah bagus.tapi mendingan daripada tokoh protagonis tertarik dengan tokoh antagonis.ga banget.tapi secara keseluruhan ceritanya menarik,menegangkan,penuh petualangan.keren!
There is something extraordinarily comforting about Agatha Christie’s books. They’re like comfort food. Why didn’t they ask Evans is a decent mystery novel. There are plenty of twists and turns and megalomaniac villains to keep the reader hooked.
Excellent standalone. I listened to this one while working on the 6000 piece puzzle with my MIL and family.
The words “Why didn’t they ask Evans?”It is that question and subsequent odd occurrences that set Bobby and his great friend, Lady Frances, to the trail.
Such a story was The Secret Adversary, and such a story I am delighted to report was Why Didn’t They Ask Evans?“We’re deducing beautifully,” said Frankie.
“I hope we’re not deducing all wrong.” “Very likely.” Said Bobby.
His best friend could not have said that he was handsome, but his face was an eminently likable one, and his eyes had the honest brown friendliness of a dog’s.”Likewise this speech from Bobby when Frankie does herself up for an accident they’ve scheduled to occur.“You’re looking very pale, Frankie,” said Bobby anxiously.
Kiek jos knygų beskaityčiau - man negana.
Šiuo metu lentynoj guli dar 5 neskaitytos ir laukia savo eilės, o dabar apie "Kodėl jie nepaprašė Evan?".Nors man labiausiai patinka jos knygos kuriose veikia detektyvas Erkiulis Puaro, ir kitos dažniausiai nebūna tokios stiprios, (čia tik mano meilė Puaro kalta) ši - išimtinė.
Nors jis atrodo be gyvybės ženklų, dar spėja pasakyti paskutinius savo žodžius - "Kodėl jie nepaprašė Evans?".
Frenkei, be galo gyvybingai, linksmai ir kartu aštraus proto mergina iškart kyla įtarimas jog ne viskas čia išspręsta ir imasi nuosavo tyrimo.
Jaunuoliai kuo toliau, tuo daugiau įsitikina jog tai nebuvo nelaimė.Knyga, nors ir kalba apie žmogžudystę, parašyta labai linksmai.
لا أدري كيف تستطيع أن تضع القاتل في البقعة العمياء .. يحيط بنا ويصنع الأحداث لكننا لا نراه .. لا نراه!أما عن نسج خيوط الأحداث وخلق المفاجآت تلو المفاجآت، فذاك ما سيجعلني أحزن كثيرًا عندما أُطبِق دفتيّ آخر روايات أجاثا!كم أعشق الروايات التي لا تستخف بذكاء القارئ!
Another great Agatha Christie. Bobbie and Frankie are a likable pair. The plot throws a lot of red herrings and the ending was excellent. The villain unusually gets away although his femme de fatale does not. The bumbling and stammering Edgar is a great albeit minor character. I see also there is a tv adaptation on YouTube which I plan to watch. To sum up cliff walk, victim found dying on the rocks below, aristocracy, insane asylum or drug treatment centre you decide, a wonderfully evil villain and a happy ending.
4'5/5De los mejores libros de Agatha. Muy recomendado! 💕
2,5*. Reread. Saya agak-agak lupa ceritanya. Dapat separuh buku, rasanya kok males mau lanjut. Tapi sudah punya bukunya, sayang mau di dnf. Eh, ternyata pas baca pertama kali dulu, perasaannya masih sama. Dulu hampir di dnf juga :'(..Hampir DNF-in buku ini. Ide ceritanya oke dan karakternya menarik, terutama Frankie yg lucu. Setelah separuh buku, rasanya membosankan. Tapi pelaku sebenarnya dalam kasus Kabut benar benar diluar dugaan.
ببساطة لأنهم لا يعرفون من يكون / تكون إفنز :Dتنقلك اجاثا من خيط لآخر ومن مشتبه لآخر حتى إذا ما وصلت للنهاية إكتشفت ان كل افتراضاتك او معظمها خاطئة وهذا ما يسمى بالإبداع.
A real page turner! Full of adventure and fun and keeps you guessing until the very end!
يمكنني القول أنه الآن يعد من أفضل ١٠ كتب قرأتها لأجاثا كريستي. كما أنني معجبه جدا بأسولب المترجم في ترجمه رواياتها و أشكره جدا على ذلك. كما يمكنني القول بأنني صرت أعجب من طريقة تفكيري و أنا أقرأ كتبها حتى أصبحت لدي القدرة في معرفة من إقرف الفعل حتى و لو لم كن بكل التفاصيل الممكنة. كم هو ممتع أن تأقرأ كتاب و تبدأ خلايا مخك الرمادية ( كما يقول دوما بوارو ) بالتفكير بالمسحيل ، كما أنه مطلوب منك حل اللغز بدلا عنهم.
Previously published as "The Boomerang Clue", this stand-alone mystery from 1934 had somehow escaped my notice until recently. I found this a fun cosy mystery although slightly predictable. I suspect that is because so many authors have copied the gist of Christie's plots over the years! In any case, although I did figure out who the bad guys were fairly early, it was still fun to watch Bobby and Frankie figure it out.
I'd forgotten that Agatha Christie wrote a lot of stand-alone novels that had neither Miss Marple nor Hercule Poirot. This mystery was so British 1930s charming that I thoroughly enjoyed it; it's not brilliant but is darned good.
Compared to the previous Christie book I read (which was, I think, The Hollows), this was a disappointment.Why Didn't They Ask Evans is not a Poirot or Miss Marple book, but instead stars Bobby Jones (fourth son of the vicar) and Frankie (Frankie's the daughter of the earl) as they try to solve the mystery behind the death that Bobby comes across while playing golf.
Towards the end, a lot of the twists and turns depends on extremely convenient plot twists, possibly more so than normal Christie mysteries.
It's the only Christie title I can think of that is a joke with the reader, and that's fitting for the overall light, adventure tone of the novel.I had clear suspicions about the solution, which I wouldn't really call her most ingenious, although there are some convoluted twists along the way.
The amateur sleuths are charming and I was rooting for them, although the "young adventurer" types never really delight me quite as much as Miss Marple and Poirot (and Miss Oliver and Battle, for that matter).
That's my personal taste, but this is well-done, charming, and diverting in Christie's lighter mode.
Nessun investigatore classico è protagonista di questa vicenda.
Tutto è lasciato nelle mani di Bobby e di Frankie (sua amica di nobili origini con vari agganci e molta disponibilità economica), improvvisatesi entrambi novelli detective.Devo ammettere d'aver molto apprezzato il personaggio forte (e anche un po' ficcanaso) di Frankie ed il gioco tra delitti ed amore che si crea in questo romanzo.Ci sono alcuni punti della vicenda che risultano un po' forzati e un po' troppo provvidenziali (niente spoiler: mi fermo qui!).
Agatha Christie is one of my favorite authors of all time.
I love her and the way she weaves magic in every book of hers.
Her books are simply marvelous and so is this book ‘Why didn’t they ask Evans’.
She is now right on top with my favorite female fictional characters.
The plot like any Agatha Christie book is brilliant and grasping.
The words ‘Why didn’t they ask Evans’ uttered by a man just before dying which seem pretty useless end up being the most important key to the whole book.
The book is fast paced, interesting, gripping and humors at times.
Well, I can't give a detailed review on this, since it took me so long to read & I hate writing long reviews too.
Compared to the previous Christie book I read last year (And Then There Were None), this was a disappointment.
I just couldn't keep my attention but for a few minutes at a time, it’s not what one generally expects from Christie’s mysteries.
This book had such a good set up, but wasn't as good as it could have been, the mystery wasn't as hooking as the other ones I've read, while the ending felt a bit forced.
I'm not sure what a boomerang has to do with the story, unless it refers to a character throwing a boot up through a skylight, said boot falling back into the room amid broken glass on the floor.
Anyway, Christie's forte was never double-detective stories (it's just hard to out-wit Poirot or Marple), and here Bobby and Frankie come off as no more than Tommy and Tuppence with different names but perhaps a far more varied sex life!
And as far as Bobby's preferences in the bedroom, I say "live and let live." Dame Agatha Christie is ALWAYS in fashion.
Christie paints in broad strokes the Bright Young People of the 1930s gossip columns, with droll, insouciant Frankie standing in for the champagne-addled aristrocratic youth of the time period.
You probably will have it all figured out by about half way through, but her crazy characters of Bobby and Frankie and their amateur sleuthing make you not even care.
Favorite, favorite line: vicar's son Bobby is talking about how the murder might have been committed by a gang, and Frankie (drolly, Mitfordly) drawls "That's a low taste...
A single handed murder is much higher-class, Bobby." There are several gems like this in the book, and any problems I encountered with plot, etc.
awalnya menyenangkan, tapi lamalama membosankan. suka karakter Bobby, kayak yg pemikir tapi innocent gitu.
