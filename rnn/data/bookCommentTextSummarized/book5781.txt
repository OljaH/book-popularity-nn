Beverly Cleary turns 100 this year! <3 We read ELLEN TEBBITS to celebrate. Discussion on Monday 4/11/16 if you'd like to join us: https://www.goodreads.com/topic/show/...
Beverly Cleary is a national treasure for early middle grade chapter books.
I like Ellen and I can relate to her realness, but spoiled rotten Otis steals the show.
I'm glad this is no longer a thing.
Ellen is learning the complexities of having a friend.
There is a book about Otis.
Ramona stole the show later and I would have liked to hear more from Ellen at some point too.
It is certainly an easier time for girls than now days with horrible bullying in 1st grade and onward.
I'm glad I read this.
Ellen Tebbits is the antithesis of Ramona Quimby at the same age.
She and her nemesis, Otis Spofford (where did Cleary get these names?) attend a different school in the same town, but their lives couldn't be more different.
Like Ramona, I wasn't in the dancing-school echelon of our small town, but Ellen and Austine certainly are.
Without Ramona's wild imagination and questioning attitude toward the world around her, Ellen just wants to fit in.Her previous playmate having moved away, Ellen's at a loose end until she meets Austine (those names again!), the new girl in town.
I know that both my kids have experienced this type of inequity already, and at the very least, I like that this book shows them that they are not the only ones who are sometimes treated unfairly due to a misunderstanding or an adult's incomplete view of a situation.
Anyway, I think Ellen and Austine's friendship was realistic, and on the one hand I think it's nice for children to read about all kinds of relationship dynamics, so they get to understand that a whole range of experiences - including fighting with friends - is normal.
Still, I really liked that Ellen and Austine resolved everything between themselves, not just apologizing, but also fairly understanding the other person's point of view.
This was one of my favorite books when I was in the third grade.
What a delight to revisit this! The woolen underwear, the independence of children to walk to each other's houses, and of course, the polite respect for parents and teachers. Most of the experience is in the classroom or dance class. Beverly Cleary's 100th birthday can be celebrated by listening to this. Andrea Martin delivers just the right emphasis; a charming experience.

One of my favorite character creations of hers is Ellen Tebbits, an eight-year-old girl whose life is brightened by her friendship with newcomer Austine.
The book Ellen Tebbits forever shaped my life.Partly because of Ellen, during much of my childhood, I wanted a best friend.
I do know though that in hindsight I’ve found it ironic that I should wish for my best friend and I to dress up as twins, given how the situation transpired for Ellen and Austine.
I'm probably setting myself up to be the black-sheep on this one, but I always loved the scene where Ellen is in ballet class trying to do the warm ups and Otis is imitating her movements.
But, I'm pretty sure Otis is well known for his teasing.
Re-reading Ellen was a lovely trip down memory lane to a time where you can walk two houses over to a friends house, ride your bike into town, go out for an ice cream cone, or even like in Ellen's case clap erasers with your best friend.
I'll be picking up Otis Spofford and Ramona to read next.
Ellen's mother makes all her clothes for her and worries about her clean floor.
Otis has a full cowboy outfit (with spurs) and we're told that MOST of the children in the school have a cowboy hat, or even a neckerchief.
When is the last time you saw a class full of Ellens and Austines, Otises and Lindas?
Ramona is a name that passes the test of time.
They bake brownies, they worry about their teacher not liking them, and they get into a whopper of a fight when Ellen slaps her friend.
In something that is a mystery to me, Lu (age 5) is really not that interested in having chapter books read to her ...
with the exception of Beverly Cleary.
And I think we all know that it's not as if I don't have a pretty deep list of books I already own that should have a similar appeal to the Clearys, but she is a discerning audience.
The list of chapter books she has rejected reads like a who's who of children's literature across the ages.
And she was immediately hooked by Ellen, despite having no idea what long underwear is.
Like Ramona, Ellen is a spirited, out-going child.
Ellen and her fried are passengers in a car, and they are playing a car game to pass the time.Each [girl] watched the signs on her side of the road for letters of the alphabet.
The girl who had a Burma Shave sign on her side of the road at the right time was lucky because it contained in the right order both 'u' and 'v', two hard letters to find.They are the Burma Shave signs my sister and I read aloud every time we passed them: When friskywith whiskey,don't drive,cause it's risky.
I loved Beverly Cleary books growing up and read many of them but I do not recall having ever read Ellen Tebbits. The kids and I had so much fun reading this together. We laughed, we groaned at the antics of Otis Spofford, we sat on the edge of our seats wondering if Ellen and Austine would make up and be best friends again. Best of all my kids learned the chant "I see London, I see France..." and have been having a grand time with it.
I love Beverly Cleary and ballet, so it was a great book. Myrna, age 7
cute, authentic; typically excellent Cleary
Beverly Cleary is a god that brought her books to earth. One of the best books ever. Its not so bad reading after all.
Read this as a child but completely forgot it--looking forward to our Kindred Spirit chat about this one!
Cute Story! :)
I don't see them being too enthused about this.MY THOUGHTS: This is one of the books I remember favorably when I was younger and continued to enjoy reading into my adult years.
When I got a little older and was in middle school I had a best friend that was also from California that shared my name.
Slapping your best friend though because she untied your sash is a bit over the top.
And so I thought Ellen was a little more wrong than Austin.
But Austin was petty because of her jealousy that her best friend had a better dress.
I adored the Ramona books in my own childhood, yet somehow never stumbled upon Ellen Tebbits. Despite being published over 65 years ago, Beverly Cleary's writing so perfectly captures the essence of girlhood. It's little wonder that these novels continue to charm generations and generations of children! I thoroughly enjoyed reading Ellen's story with my daughter--and would like to thank Ms. Cleary for the numerous contributions her writing made to a young girl's blossoming vocabulary!
A wonderful tale of childhood innocence, of fitting in at school, of making friends and avoiding boys (who, at that age, are just yucky :) ). What makes this book special is Beverly Cleary's signature style of portraying children as children, with all their angst, their fun, and their awkward moments. Every child can probably relate to the situations portrayed in this book. Recommended.
This is excellent. Beverly Cleary was a master at capturing the experience of elementary school. Sure, some of the things that happen here are a little dated—woolen underwear, clapping the chalk dust out of erasers, the expectation that mothers all sew. Who cares? The ways Ellen and Austine navigate their friendship makes this a classic of middle grade fiction.
Revisting an old favorite by Beverly Cleary after a recent visit to Portland, Oregon reactivated my fandom. This is a quiet, old fashioned book that depicts a simpler time. Published in 1951, the children in this book are contemporary with my parents' childhood so I feel very fondly towards Ellen and Austine and the ups and downs of their friendship. Ellen is not as iconic a character as Ramona Quimby, but it is a testament to Cleary's talent that she can draw such distinct characters in so few pages.
I forgot how much I love Beverly Cleary! This has always been one of my favorites of her books.😊
Not even the temporary issue of jealousy over an untied sash on matching red dresses.MY THOUGHTS: This is one of the books I remember favorably when I was younger and continued to enjoy reading into my adult years.
Slapping your best friend though because she untied your sash is a bit over the top.
And so I thought Ellen was a little more wrong than Austin.
But Austin was petty because of her jealousy that her best friend had a better dress.
I enjoyed it i loved the point when stinky Odis asked for a dime but his mom was like NOPE!
It's a very sweet story, and of course Beverly Cleary is an excellent writer. Compared to the other Beverly Cleary books I've read, I feel like there's something missing, but perhaps that's just the fact that I am reading it for the first time as an adult and not as a child. Perhaps the thing that's missing is nostalgia?
This review also appears on my blog, Read-at-Home Mom.Ellen Tebbits is so utterly embarrassed by the fact that her mother makes her wear woolen underwear that when she changes her clothes before dance class she hides in the closet to avoid being teased.
Though girls are unlikely to wear woolen underwear to school, they can all relate to the way it feels to be embarrassed by a family rule others don't have to follow.
Above all, kids of every generation understand what it's like to be lonely, to be teased, to find a new friend, to hurt a friend's feelings, and to make amends and start anew.More than any other author, Beverly Cleary understands childhood.
But Ellen wasn't alone for long, she had met a NEW best friend, who she hanged out with all the time.
SO then, the next day when Ellen and her friend had to clean the chalk board erasers, Ellen smacked her friend right across the face.
The next day, they were back to being Best Friends, like before.I can connect this to myself because when I was in 4th grade, I got into an argument with my friend.
At first we were play fighting, but then my friend actually smacked me.
My most vivid memory of this book is the first story about the woolen underwear in ballet class.
Which of course makes the heartbreak of the fight and estrangement later in the book all the more wrenching.
Ms. Cleary is just so amazing in her ability to understand a 3rd grader and how they think and how they behave.
Otis Spofford is so very accurately annoying and you really feel for Ellen when she is teased.
I really, really, really wish Ms. Cleary had written more books about Ellen (and Austine).
This is my very favorite Beverly Cleary book.
