I loved the Riftwar books and I'm already loving this next chapter! This may end up on my favorites list! I love Mara! Mel 🖤🐾🐺
Highly recommended.The characters were excellent, really.
The setting was vaguely oriental, (though as Wastrel tells me, Wurts drew a lot from Korea) so a large part of this book is political intrigue and matters of honor.
But the political intrigue stuff is actually really excellently written.Moving on.
Or months.Mara is that strong female character you've always wished you'd find somewhere in fantasy.
She's beautifully real and it's very easy to empathize with her.The supporting characters really made the book for me.
Wurts and Feist didn't let anything slip by them; each of their supporting characters were wonderfully realized and fully fleshed-out.Ugh. Highly recommended.
I read this years ago and picked it up again because I was into something non-European setting. This is an alt Asain world that is tangental to the Riftworld Saga by Feist, and is a REALLY good read. The protagonist is a young girl who must save her family and lands by growing up very quick. Nothing naughty in here, but lots of great politics a-la Game of Thrones. Highly recommend for a fun and different fantasy!
It has all the elements that make a book great: strong characters, excellent world-building, masterful writing, and a page-turning story.
If any of you aren’t familiar with Feist’s Riftwar saga, the arc of the series involves one world (Midkemia) being invaded by another world (Kelewan) from across a magical rift.
What the Kelewan Empire trilogy does is take you deep into the Tsurani’s world, following the life of a young woman within it.
New flora and fauna, new architecture, new politial/religious systems – Feist and Wurts obviously spent a lot of time developing, and really made the world come to life!
Did you read the Riftwar Saga and love it?Want to read something just as good, if not better?Want to learn about life on the other side of the Rift?You need to check this out! It is a fantastic tale of honor, politics, and strategy. While some fantasy books have lots of physical battle, this story is mainly plotting, deception, and courtly games. Reading this is more like watching a puzzle being solved and wondering how things will finally come together in the end. It is simply just a great and well crafted story!
Daughter of the Empire (and 2 following books) by Raymond Feist & Janny WurtsThis marvelous epic fantasy trilogy is full of political intrigue and subversive machinations set in an alternate medieval Japan where magic is real and the aliens landed a long time ago. Feist & Wurts gave me one of my favorite characters of all time, Mara, who conquers an empire with the power of innovation, social acumen, and a trickster's luck. This trilogy is a frequent reread for me. I love it so much.
Daughter of the Empire was the result of a collaboration between Janny Wurts and Raymond Feist, and though I haven't read any Feist, I have to say it blends well, and Feist's influence tempered Wurt's writing and made it infinitely more palatable.I've avoided writing about Wurt's books since meeting her in one of my GR groups, as she is a truly wonderful, generous and respectful person.
It must be Feist's or the editor's influence, because for one of the first times reading her books, I found myself able to concentrate on the story and characterization without being distracted by the writing.
I re-read this for the 3d or 5th time, but it's been at least a decade, so it was very fresh to me.
Too fresh & interesting.
Dann Janny & Ray, but I hit the 1/3 point yesterday & then couldn't put it down.
I stayed up until midnight reading (I never go to bed after 10pm & always wake up by 6 at the latest.) so I've been dragging all morning.
A nail biter all the way, I finished the last 50 or so pages this morning in a rush.On to Servant of the Empire!
It's been a while since I've read a story with such complex political intrigue, and I enjoyed every word of it!  Plot Summary Set in a Japanese-style setting and culture, Mara of the Acoma is but a few minutes away from being initiated into the service of the goddess Lashima. She is, however, rudely jerked from her chosen path when news of her father's and brother's death reaches her household. In Mara's world, power is determined by the Game of the Council, the neverending power struggle masked
[image error]No need to be rude while pillaging.Mara must use all her wiles and courage to defeat the powerful Minwanabi house, whose members ordered the death of her family, and to rebuild her house to become one of the most powerful in the empire.
Much of this book revolves around Mara's development from an experienced young girl to a powerful political figure and leader.
Mara particularly shines in her flexibility with bending Kelewan's codes of conduct to gain advantage over her enemies.The characters were also superbly developed.
Set in the Tsurani culture, it’s very different to your average fantasy world.
As the cover blurb alludes to, this book focuses heavily on politics, which in the Tsurani world is just as deadly as open combat.
While at times I would have liked a little variety from the political intrigue, it was cleverly written and kept the tension high.The book is written in such a way that if you haven’t read the Riftwar books, everything can still make sense.
Growing up, Feist’s Riftwar books where one of my main introductions to fantasy, and I read and reread them an embarrassing amount of times.
I was disappointed that after writing that masterpiece Feist apparently took a course on "how to write a book" and all of his stories followed the template of "The hero must complete a quest in 3 parts and will face roadblocks A, B and C before overcoming them".
After finishing the Riftwar saga I was let down that the series never lived up the wide open unconventional ideas Feist showed with his debut.This was my first time reading anything by Janny Wurts and this book was recommended to me due to my love of "court intrigue"/manners books with little or no magic.
This book ought to have been right up my street; a non-medieval world, with limited magic, a slow pace driven by politics rather than endless battles, and a strong-minded female lead - what's not to like?
This really isn't much of a spoiler, actually, since it's obvious right from the start that she will ultimately triumph, but I expected her to have some setbacks along the way.
There were only three possible outcomes to Mara's nasty little plot against Buntokapi: global war, family war or the brutish, stupid husband who beats up his own wife suddenly turns all honourable and commits ritual suicide.
Sadly the rest of the book isn't like this.
There's not a lot of magic, instead it's all about intrigue and politics.
Mara is simply one of the best female fantasy characters I've ever encountered.
This entire book is one big chess game filled with politics and betrayal, and Mara does not use strength and violence to win this game but her wit.
More of this, please.The entire cast of characters is well developed.
There was one scene especially which was a punch in the gut, and only a few pages prior I thought I'd be throwing a party.I recommend this to anyone who loves fantasy with a lot of politics and intrigue.
Στα πλαίσια της φιλοδοξίας μου να διαβάσω όλα τα βιβλία του κύκλου του Riftwar έφτασα σε αυτήν εδώ την τριλογία και σε αυτό το πρώτο βιβλίο που μπορώ να πω ότι με κάνει πιο αποφασισμένο να πετύχω αυτό τον στόχο.
Μία κοινωνία που θα έλεγα ότι μοιάζει ιδιαίτερα με αυτή της φεουδαρχικής Ιαπωνίας αλλά έχει και στοιχεία από άλλες κουλτούρες της άπω ανατολής, κάτι που δημιουργεί μία αίσθηση εξωτισμού και μας δίνει και μία βάση για να μπορούμε περισσότερο να κατανοούμε τις σκέψεις των ηρώων.
Too many coincidental things happen - every time Mara has a problem things go the absolute perfect way for her (view spoiler)[ for example:- she needs men and "poof" all the grey soldiers become hers - including one of the best spy masters in the country- Bunto just happens to come home in a rage and says the exact right thing needed for Mara to have ammunition to end him ...
oh, and the Warlord and his father are both on his way and no one tells him - the timing and circumstances just don't hold up for me- the same goes for the neighbor who owed her a small amount of money.
There's a discussion going on right now at Goodreads about whether magic is necessary to a fantasy novel, and I have to say that this one certainly proves that it's not at all necessary.
The shifts and currents and political and psychological maneuvering that take place in the great Game of the Council that is fascinating, exhilarating, and always deadly - for someone.Magic appears in this book only in the end, in a ritual devised by the Great Ones or magicians who exist in Kelewan only to serve the empire.Now I can't wait to read the next one!
This was excellent, exactly the type of fantasy I dig.
Sure, battles are fine, but the polite smiles and sharp wits of politics that feature in this novel really make me invest.
Mara of the Acoma is thrust into the position of Lady of her House by the deaths of her father and brother.
She is unused to the Great Game of the Council, and has few allies outside her own house.
Through her knowledge, sharpness of mind and staggering bravery, this tiny slip of a woman shows true strength within the confines of a society that does not allow for women to rule.
Perhaps my expectations were a bit high after loving The Riftwar Saga as much as I did.For me it felt a lot like I was watching someone play a game that I didn't know the rules of.
I knew that Mara was plotting something and her seemingly unwise behaviour was motivated by some secret scheme she had planned, but since I didn't know all the rules within the culture of the Tsurani I couldn't possibly foresee how her plans might work out until they did.
I probably won't read the rest of this trilogy, but will still read other trilogies in the Riftwar Cycle.
4 stars
This society revolves almost entirely around politics, deriving much of its order from an endless political struggle known only as the Game of the Council.Daughter of the Empire accompanies Mara, the new and untested Ruling Lady of House Acoma, throughout the first two years of her rule as she strives to protect her ancestral family name and gain enough strength and standing to enter the Game of the Council.
And of course there’s nothing better than witnessing the political payoffs: it’s well worth the wait to see Mara’s plots finally coming to fruition after hundreds of pages of plotting and pain.Re-reading Daughter of the Empire after so many years has reaffirmed this trilogy as one of my favourites of all time.
I picked this up many years ago after reading Raymond Feist's RIftwar Saga.
Within the first thirty pages or so, I was hooked.
Mara, of the Acoma, is the main protag, and she is one of the most well-developed characters I've run across in fantasy.
Wurtz and Feist have dug deep into their character playbook and they came up with nothing but winners.
I say couple because it is such a compelling read, I can't imagine taking more than two nights to finish.
Highly recommended for any reader interested in great worldbuilding, cultures, deep characters, and some of the best plotting I have seen.
The story is of Lady Mara of House Acoma and her ascent to power after the betrayal and death of her father and brother, leaving her an unlikely heir to rulership over her family.
This leaves the characters to go about power struggles, back-stabbing and other generally interesting political maneuvers.
Essentially, a ruling class of "House Lords" rules over the empire in a constant struggle for more wealth and power.
The Council is a real governing body, but its members callously refer to it as a game, as if the decisions they made were not life and death.Interestingly, to read this book feels very much like playing a complicated game.
After reading a few chapters, I quickly felt very attached to the main character; Mara, Lady of the Acoma noble family of the Tsurani Empire.At a child’s age, Mara is torn from becoming what is like a monk or a priestess when she learns the news of the death of her father and her brother from the devious hands of a rival family whose had a blood feud with the Acoma for many years.
In an attempt to save her family name’s honor and the people who’ve worked for them for generations from utter destruction and shame; and for revenge of the death of her loved ones; Mara enters a game of political intrigue, subterfuge, and murder called the Game of the Council.

A saga decorre em tempos remotos e acresce ao desafio, o facto de se tratar de uma jovem, inexperiente, a quem nunca esteve destinado este papel, como tal absolutamente leiga nestas lides...
Os acontecimentos sucedem-se, surpreendem-nos, dão voltas e reviravoltas e assim vamos assimilando como era viver naquele mundo.
As tradições, o cumprimento dos desígnios dos Deuses e o orgulho e respeito pelos antepassados era a essência das suas vidas.
Impressiona como esses elementos conduzem e condicionam as suas vidas.
Fiquei com muita vontade de prosseguir nos próximos volumes e é exactamente o que farei de seguida.
This is great book, and just like when I originally read it, one of the things I appreciate the most about it is that an old skool epic fantasy doesn't have to take place in a setting that is a Medieval Western Europe analogue.
It is also nice that while the authors make her a generally sympathetic character she can also be as manipulative and ambitious as her detractors think she is.Great set up for the next book in the series.The Not So Good.Things happen too neatly for Mara.
Even though Mara has no problem ruining a suitor through acting like a seductress, i.e. playing upon her sexuality as a weapon, when her enemy uses sex as a way to get information, that's a negative characteristic.It goes something like this:Advisor: Lord So-and-so is plotting to kill you and ruin your family.
Mara Sue: I have a daring plot.
[Shares daring plot].Advisor: [Silently looks upon Mara with admiration][Plot is successful]Repeat x 5Ending: [Everyone in the book who Mara hasn't had killed looks upon Mara with admiration]SO MUCH BULLSHIT!
I read Daughter of the Empire so long ago I can't write a detailed review now.
What I can tell you is The Empire Trilogy left a lasting impression on me.
Almost 30 years later I can still say Mara of the Acoma is my all time favourite fantasy heroine.
She never touches a weapon of war as far as I can remember.
She is armed with her wits and intellect and wields them to devastating effect.It is best to read Magician (these days split into two volumes Magician: Apprentice Magician: Master) then Silverthorn and A Darkness At Sethanon before starting The Empire Trilogy.
“Every sunlit façade cast a dark shadow and in those shadows the enemy plotted.”More like three stars, but extra credit for the rousing climax.
Competent, if derivative epic fantasy set in an east Asia-analog medieval kingdom.
Finally, toward the end, the authors admit that even the cast would not be using that stilted phrase, but simply “the game” without the capitalization.“What do you think the game is, if not to remain while you dispose of your enemies?”Slow start.
Most crisis are dealt with in turn with the over-arching plot dormant for most of the story.
Large, six-legged mammals signal lazy fantasy writers.
I have read the series at least three of four times and book by book it just gets better and better.A young girl is catapulted into leading her family when her father and brother are betrayed on the battlefield.
