Everyone in the herd was so happy to have their popular prankster back that they decided to celebrate with a special day every year, On “Elmer’s Day”, every elephant would decorate themselves with unique and colourful patterns, and Elmer must decorate himself to look ...
yes, you’ve guessed it!So every year, on the day of the parade, “if you happen to see an elephant ordinary elephant colour, you will know it must be Elmer.” The author of Elmer, David McKee, originally comes from South Devon, in England.
Elmer has now featured in 34 books by David McKee, and the series has sold nearly 5 million copies in 40 languages around the world.
An absolute classic! My son loves it!
Thanks to Wiebke, I’ve discovered my first Elmer book.
This is a gift worthy book for new babies and for young children.
This is the first Elmer book, and there are many others.
This particular book is a great educational tool for children who are enjoying learning their colors.The positive message about celebrating differences is done in a way that’s not at all heavy handed and I think it’s effective.
It’s also a wonderful friendship story.
Children’s adults will be just as entertained as they are, and in my opinion that’s one thing that makes a great children’s picture book.
Stuck in a toy-shop in German-speaking Bern on Saturday, I picked up a copy of Elmar and tried to read it.
My German is very uncertain, so I don't guarantee that I understood everything.
Here's a tentative plot summary:Elmer Goes MainstreamElephants are notoriously unimaginative, and quietly proud of their drab, gray conformity.
But every now and then, you get an exception.
Elmer was just such an elephant.
A natural rebel and iconoclast, this was reflected even in his pigmentation, which was a bizarre patchwork of psychedelic colors.
He would often play jokes on the other elephants."Personally, I think he takes it too far," one of them grumbled.
since this book is called "Elmar" in german (like my baby brother) I had to "read" this cute book hah hah.
Elmer es de todos colores.Lo que me ha gustado de la novela es que a pesar de lo que pueda parecer en la sinopsis, Elmer no es repudiado o discriminado por los demás elefantes como pasa, por ejemplo, en El patito feo.
Él simplemente es distinto a los demás pero se llevan todos muy bien y se divierten con sus locuras.A pesar de esto a Elmer le gustaría ser aunque sea por un ratito como sus amigos.
Elmer es un personaje super divertido y querido por todos que nos enseña que ser diferentes no esta mal y que de hecho, tiene muchas cosas buenas.Muy recomendado para enseñarle de a poquito y por medio de historias y juegos valores a los mas chiquitos.
Coperta super glossy, format larg si generos, desene ok, colorit abundent, povestea nu prea m-a dat pe spate.The cover of the romanian edition was very glossy, the format of the book is very large, the drawings are ok, it has a lot of colors, but the story wasn`t something that I would remember over time. :)

I loved this book as a child and having reread it now, I still really enjoyed the story.
McKee's story is full of humour and joy.
Elmer is a very likeable character with a huge sense of fun that children would definitely be able to relate to.The book is filled with beautifully vibrant illustrations that help to bring the plot to life.
There is a pretty high picture to text ratio but there is still quite a substantial amount of text, usually a few sentences on each page.
I also like McKee's creative layout e.g the "booo!" 2 page spread.In terms of use in the classroom, it's great for thinking about colours and jungle animals.
Found this today while helping the girls do a bit of tidying. Good fun
همهی فیلها فیلیرنگ!! هستند ولی المر یک فیل بامزه و شوخ و رنگارنگ است و فیلهای دیگر او را با این مشخصه میشناسند. المر از این تفاوت راضی نیست و سعی میکند خود را شبیه فیلهای دیگر کند، اما ......تو مخلوق خاص و بیهمتای خدایی و هیچکس شبیه تو نیست! تو ویژگیهایی داری که بقیه ندارند. پس خودتو دوست داشته باش و از این خاص بودن لذت ببر 😊😎

From my own memories of the story from when I was little it has always held a strong yet familiar moral message.Elmer is an elephant with a patchwork body of a variety of colours.
To the joy of the group Elmer realises that it is his differences which make him who he is.David McKee's colourful depiction of differences through the story of Elmer can provide and important learning curve for children.
Elmer can also be used for art based activities, where children can draw and write about their differences on varying coloured card, so the class can create their own patchwork Elmer, possibly for the beginning of the school year when children are moving up from EYFS to KS1.
However Elmer did not want to be different to the other elephants as they laughed at him, so he tried to make himself ‘elephant colour’ like the others.
After hatching a plan and rolling around in berry juice to make himself ‘elephant colour’ Elmer decides that being part of the crowd is too boring and realises that being different isn’t so bad after all.
It would also be a useful resource to use with children in the reception and year 1 ages ranges as it offers a message of accepting others, understanding that everyone is different and being happy with who you are.
A wonderful read from my childhood, one I’d certainly suggest for other youngsters. Whilst it is not my all-time favourite childhood read I can still recall all the details of this one meaning it certainly left a lasting impression upon my young mind. And isn’t that what we want with children’s books, for them to leave a positive lasting impression?
عنوان ترجمه ی فارسی:المر
I shared this book with Nursery children who were deeply engrossed by Elmer and his great patch work.The primal focus of the story is on ‘Elmer ‘who is an elephant that does not resemble the other elephants in his herd.
As a result they all decided that each year they will have a special day where all of the other elephants will decorate themselves and Elmer will paint himself grey.This is a must read book!
It demonstrates that we all have unique qualities for instance (Elmer looks different - yet he always kept the other elephants entertained and happy and they were miserable without him!).
A colourful patchwork elephant!But it wasn't just the artwork that made me love this book.
Elmer, being patchwork, is totally different from the other elephants.
And also there is the fact that Elmer's differences are a bit childlike - the colourfulness and love of practical jokes and laughter are things that a young child can identify with, whereas the other elephants could be seen as being more like adults.
So there's a bit of a sense of the story encouraging children to be themselves in all their mischievousness too - that their fun and games bring laughter.
Elmer was yellow and orange and red and pink and….”Elmer is a heart-warming, uplifting story of a young elephant that is different from all the other elephants in the herd.
Unlike every other grey elephant in the herd, Elmer is a colourful, patchwork elephant.
The underlying message in this book offers great opportunities for speaking and listening activities and could also be transferred to an English lesson for a comparative study.
Overall a fantastic book with multiple uses to link with the curriculum in key stage one, while also offering an important life message; Its ok to be different.
Elmer is a patchwork elephant living among grey elephants and provides fun and laughter.
He decides to cover his colourful patchwork with elephant berries because he thinks that the grey elephants are all laughing at him.
So he reverts back to his old self and before you know it everyone is happy.The book beautifully teaches the difference between people and how being unique is not such a bad thing.
It’s also important to teach children that being the same isn’t always the happiest way, and David McKee skillfully illustrates this.Furthermore, the book has vibrant and exuberant colours which also add to the unique aspect of the book.
If my son was an elephant, he would be an elephant like Elmer: yellow, orange, red, pink, purple, blue, green, black, white.
So many times does he stress his multiple bright colors each time he pretends to be dog, or cat.
But, Elmer does not take joy in being so colorful, because after all, who wants to be different?
I was probably expecting a silly story, but it's not.
It's gentle and sensitive and my son was full of empathy for Elmer.
This is one of those heartfelt stories about individuality, such as for instance my favorite Chrysanthemum.
I must have judge this book by its cover, thinking that it might have been a jolly elephant with a colour patchwork just grazing the field and playing with his/her friends.
Elmer being another member of the herd, although is the same body size as the other elephants, was of a different colour to the rest.
Thinking that he might have not have been accepted by his fellow peers he covered his identity by making himself look grey.
The story at the end did portray that even though he was different and unique, the rest of the herd accepted him for who he is.
This story is about an elephant; Elmer is a different elephant, a special member of his pack.
Elmer starts his adventure because he does not like his friends to treat him differently because he is of another color, but with his trick he discovers that his friends, not only integrate him in the pack as one more, but they love him because his difference.
Elmer is a cute and delightful story explaining two important life lessons through an lovable elephant named Elmer.
Elmer is then exposed and the elephants create a parade in his honor.What originally drew me to this book was the bright colors spread on the cover and the adorable elephant that is also present on the cover.
The pages with the forest in the background are drew with faded, bright tropical colors which create a happy feeling for the reader.
Therefore, the book Elmer does an excellent job connecting with the readers lovable side!
Lovely story, showing children that it is our differences that make us special and that we should embrace them. Also, that it's our personality that makes us who we are not just what we look like.

This review is required for Dr. Sykes' READ3307 course at the University of Mary Hardin-Baylor.The recommended age level of Elmer is Pre-K to 2nd grade.
The plot of Elmer, by David McKee follows a very colorful elephant named Elmer.
The plot shows Elmer's insecurity with being different and how he tries to change.
The characterization is rather limited due to the length of the book, but it is fitting for the recommended age range.
The illustrations follow the text very well and support the plot.
The book can teach students that they should not try to change in order to fit in with others and that individuality should be celebrated.
Like I previously mentioned this book is great for teaching the children about the positives of being different and that everyone is different and should accept who they are, this topic relates to Religious Education, Humanities and PSHE.
This book can also be linked with Art; the children can create their own Elmer elephant which represents them and again this can show how each child is different and shows diversity.
This book can also be linked to preventing bullying in younger children by showing that you should accept difference not exclude it.
This can link to guided reading, by asking children questions like Why is it good to be different?
I remember reading this book and being drawn to the bright colours and the comical character of Elmer the elephant.
The story uses cheerful colours as Elmer is characterised as a friendly and funny multi-coloured patchwork elephant.
Elmer recognises that he appears different from the other elephants, so he covers himself in grey coloured berries to blend in with the rest of the elephants.
Or an activity could be made where the children are given a printout of an image of Elmer the elephant, children can then design their own patterns and colour the image.
However, deep down felt saddened that he was different to the other elephants as they all looked the same with their grey skins and he was so different with his coloured patchwork skin.
Elmer is beautifully illustrated and helps children to understand that being different is not a bad thing as well as laying emphasise on the importance of accepting that we are all different and unique.
This book would be great at Nursery and Key stage one, the book is an easy read with simple moral to the story that is easy to understand, familiar, true to the facts of life; that we are all unique, diverse, special, have different characteristics, cultures, appearances and personalities.
At the end of the story they celebrate by painting themselves in multi-colored paint, in recognition of Elmer's unique appearance and personality.I like this book because it has a good moral to it; the moral being sometimes being different is what makes people like you more.
I also like this story as it van be used to put a point across to children about being unique and how people have different personalities and not to outcast individuals in any circumstance.
In early years it would be read to the children and is effective for exploration of the themes and issues relating to the concept of diversity.
