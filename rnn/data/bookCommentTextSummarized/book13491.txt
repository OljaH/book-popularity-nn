A description which contains mention of a feisty innkeeper’s daughter who’s independent and strong and doesn’t want to get married and who stumbles across a disguise for the legendary Robin Hood type figure Jackaroo and decides to start dressing up in his clothes.
Snyder.I loved that Cynthia Voigt took inspiration from the middle ages, but didn’t romanticize the middle ages.
I loved that Gwyn saw how impotent she was to change everything, but still felt compelled to try.
The only part of this story that I didn’t really love was the ending.
Yes, it’s what I wanted and it was very satisfying.
More than anything else, this is a coming of age story about Gwyn the Innkeeper's daughter.
Gwyn is at the age when she must either decide who to marry or declare that she will be single for life.
In deciding this question, facing adventures that come her way (such as finding a complete Jackaroo costume), and wrestling with the injustices she sees around her, she discovers much about herself, her family, and her place in the world.
I read the Simon Pulse first edition and there were spelling mistakes all over the place.
Most of them were things spell check would not catch, like the was accidentally written as she.
I vaguely remembering picking this off the YA shelf in the library sometime around eighth grade, but somehow my brain categorized it as "sad" a la Westmark (read around the same time) and I never revisited this until now.I'm glad I did, because it turns out that Jackaroo is a coming-of-age story.
(view spoiler)[I'm convinced there's another story going on under the surface: one much less personal, where the lords catch Jackaroo only to find another one spring up at the Steward's, along with new rumors and dispensed coins (and babies).
I loved the way the story played out and the ways that Gwyn found to stay true to herself while still attempting to fit into her world.This is the first book I've read by Cynthia Voigt that wasn't in her Tillerman series, and I think it has now become my favorite by her - although I highly recommend the Tillerman books as well.
I really like that the heroine dressed as a male and was able to help people, like Robin Hood.
I love stories of girls dressing as boys and taking on other roles.The hero liked her sister, but her sister married someone else.
So I had a real problem that he liked her sister.
The heroine liked a guy but he didn't like her.
I remember a moment when she was looking at someone who was hanging, and the hero noticed it too.
No one else did, and she made a comment like she would only be with someone who had noticed that.
My expectations were a bit too high, I had heard this compared to Robin Hood or even Scarlet Pimpernel, so as I read I was a little disappointed in the story.
I think it had a lot of promise, but it was a little lacking for me.
Gwyn was a pretty good heroin, and she grows a lot throughout the story.
I think Burl (her good friend, and father’s servant) was under used and although it’s clear what his intentions are, Gwyn hardly notices him throughout the story.
It was a little boring for me, but okay overall.
***2018***I'm so glad I asked a local library to order these. It's been long enough that I only slightly remember the feeling of the book, so it had the lovely experience of being new yet as comfortable as an old friend.***2009***I'm not sure what I expected, but this book both met and exceeded what I was looking for.Sigh. I hate being vague. I'm looking forward to getting the next book in the series.
I came across this book in a thrift store and bought it because I enjoyed a few other books by the author. I ended up really loving it and read it several times as a young adult.
A Robin Hood tale, centered on a girl named Gwyn, who one day has the injustice of the system driven home for her... and decides to try to make a difference. Fast, compelling read, with well-developed characters that unfold over the course of the book, showing hidden depths. The world building is peppered throughout, woven in seamlessly, which means some areas aren't complete, but all the vital framework is explained. Looking forward to the new main character in book 2!
Evil would be done, that was the nature of the world; that was bearable if good could also be done.
The pacing of this book is really, really slow.
Or at least, it feels that way.
This is a great story about a headstrong girl who defies pretty much every standard of the land and does what she believes she should do and what she believes is right.
At times, Gwyn seems pretty dull.
I kind of guessed the obvious best-path for her, but how she ended up was not exactly that way.
The book is clean and the story good.
A fascinating idea for a fairy tale with a disappointingly Tolkien-esque ending.Gwyn is the spirited daughter of the village innkeeper who dreams of something outside the mold.
Though her heart is big and her fighting is decent, she isn't cut out for the outlaw life, and she discovers to her surprise that Jackaroo may not be just one person.I wanted to like this story, and I did for most of it.
I knew from the first moment of Burl's introduction that he would be a love interest, but we are not treated to any sort of chemistry between him and Gwyn at all throughout the entire story.
This book had a very medieval feel to it and the author describes life as seen through the eyes of the main character, Gwyn, very realistically.
The people are desperate and Gwyn thinks that their tales of Jackaroo are only that--tales made by desperate people who need some hope to cling on to.
She wants to help...I appreciate how the book makes one think about how hard life was back then.
Gwyn is a strong heroine who young readers can look up to.
It was like Robin Hood meets all the wuxia stories I heard about as I grew up, where girls disguised themselves as guys and explored, and made differences in the world where they could.
It was refreshing to read a story like this, in English.
^_^ But then I read the other Kingdom novels.
And all of a sudden, though it was still a refreshing scenario, the story, the writing, the adventure, no longer gave that big of an impact.
It's a light read, especially in comparison to the other Kingdom novels.
If I wanted my friend to read the Kingdom series, I wouldn't recommend this as the first book.
This book started out a little slow, but halfway through things started to get interesting, and by the end I discovered that I had absolutely fallen in love with the book! It was thoughtful, vivid, full of unique and interesting characters, realistic and yet hopeful, portraying the hardships of life without at all diminishing the fantastic moments of adventure. And the ending! It was a legitimate, beautiful happy ending, one that leaves you grinning from ear to ear at the end. I highly recommend this book.
The Tale of Gwyn- I wish I would've noticed this was Jackaroo under a new name BEFORE I ordered it from Amazon!I am not sure why they renamed it. That being said, Gwyn is my all-time favorite fictional character, and Jackaroo is one of the best books ever written. Gwyn is infinitely herself- wanting to help others, feeling stuck in her role as the daughter of a wealthy innkeeper. She is short-tempered, sometimes short sighted. A very real character.I love the way the society's rules are interwoven throughout the tale without being spoken of directly.
I don't know why I just recently discovered Cynthia Voigt. I've been deprived these many years. Her writing is a little bare, but I've discovered that she is saying a lot by saying a little. Her main character is so strong and sure of her capabilities. I hoped that the love story would resolve itself just the way that it did, which made me happy! I was greatly intrigued by her "kingdom." It is a very interesting place to discover and explore.
I've probably read and re-read this book a hundred times. I used to read it once a year as a child. And it's so wonderful to discover that it is still every bit as good as it ever was. I love fierce, soft-hearted Gwyn. Strong, steady Burl. Feisty Tad, who gets to grow up. And the stories and secrets and switcheroos. They are good characters in a thoughtful, well-composed world.
I first read this book in jr. high and loved it. I re-read it every year or two and still find it wonderful every time. The story of a young woman who decides to make a difference in her community by taking on the persona of a folk hero. That decision changes her future in more ways than she could imagine.
Imagine “Robin Hood” revisited with a twist. Throw in a soul-searching main character, a butterfly flapping its wings sort of turn of events, and watch what you think is going to be a slow book turn into one of your favorites. At least this is what happened to me…
O HOW I LOVED THESE BOOKS, I CANNOT EVEN SAY.So, so high up on the list of "things I hope do not seem crappy now that I'm an adult."
Yup. Right in the nostalgia.
i just bought and reread this book. i so love it!
The main character, Gwyn, is the daughter of a well-off innkeeper, struggling to come to terms with the injustice in the world around her, the fact that her family and neighbours are terrible people, and that as a woman who does not want to marry the future does not hold much in store for her, even though this world does better on the women's right front than actual medieval society did.
Surrounding this is the myth of Jackaroo, a Robin Hood like figure who works outside of the Lords' law to help the common man.The tone of the book is quite grim.
I remembered liking it then, so I thought I'd read it again to figure out exactly why I liked it so much then.And I still loved it!Though the paperback had, like, size 9 font, the pages still melted away quickly, and I found myself not wanting to stop reading.It's a classic adventure--brave heroine, medieval times, lords and ladies, servants, outlaws, town fairs, running from danger, hangings, thieves, inns...in short, everything I love in a fantasy adventure.
Well, except the hangings.I also loved how this heroine was independent.
It makes me want to read the ending over and over.
Going into my second read of this book, all I could remember was that my impression of it years ago was how very much I enjoyed the book.
A hundred pages in, I recalled how little I liked it at first.Approximately the first half of this book reads very much like a Jane Austen novel: the day-to-day life of a young woman of marriageable age, her impending decision on whether or not to marry, who to marry, etc.
However, even if--like me--that's not your cup of tea, this book is deserving of a chance; because the second half brings about a change to the direction you assume the novel is going.
Most of the time, I *like* what I find, but not to the extent where I wish I had found it when I was younger, reading it when I filled the age demographic it was written for.TL;DR:Writing: 4/5Plot: Early on, 3/5 but by the end 5/5Characters: 4/5Jackaroo is not so much a fantasy novel as it is an alternative history-historical-fiction (I think another reviewer has pointed this out, too).
Gwyn is given the opportunity to experience a new life and embody the history of the Jackaroo; the Kingdom's version of Robin Hood.The novel's themes are very feminist and socialist in nature, which I think is why it quickly became my favorite.
Set in a medieval world, times are tough.
Gwyn is lucky to be the Innkeeper's daughter as she has a roof over her head and food security, unlike most of their neighbors.
Many will lose their homes because of this.Gwyn is now of marriageable age.
Whom?A mapmaker and his son come to the Inn. They take the servant Burl and Gwyn with them and are trapped in a storm.
They reward the two with gold coins.Gwyn discovers clothes for a legendary Robin Hood character called Jackaroo.
It faces several of the problems of growing up through several characters.
How am I supposed to believe that a 16 yr old girl can pass herself off as a man who is at the very least in his mid-20s?
How am I supposed to believe that she is able to sneak off in the middle of the night and A: not get caught and, B: not be so exhausted she can barely function the next day?
She literally dehumanizes the people around her by calling them cattle at least three times in the book.
Frankly, half the book is just Gwynn being patronizing and full of self-pity for having to be around people she can't stand (but want to save).
I'm torn on how to rate this book. I really liked it as a teenager (this author was actually my favorite for awhile). And although I enjoyed it as an adult and love the way the author writes, it kind of dragged on, especially in the beginning. So 3.5 stars as an adult, 5 as a teen...we'll settle on 4.
Read on Megan's recommendation, as a YA book from her youth - and it was just what I wanted/expected! I would have loved this book so much as a teen, and I regard very fondly even reading it for the first time as an adult. It reminds me of The Forestwife, which I haven't read in years...
