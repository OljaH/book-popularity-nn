A woman who's a dab hand at healing is always welcome in Olden Tymes, so Claire is able to land on her feet and kind of get a job once she figures out what happened to her and comes to terms with it.Which is pretty much immediately.
I almost punched the book right in the face, but as I said, it's a friend's copy so I had to be nice.Then I managed to get through the "she forgives him for the beating, like, the next freakin' day" scene.
Nearly getting raped turns you on for Mr. Right!Jamie and Claire are off on their own in the woods for a spot of marital bliss when they're set upon by highwaymen.
I wonder if she felt called to that magical place, as if fate had plans for her and she was simply following her destiny.The tallest stone of the circle was cleft, with a vertical split dividing the two massive pieces..."Without warning, and for no apparent reason, Claire is whisked back to the year 1743.I could say that my field of vision contracted to a single dark spot, then disappeared altogether, leaving not darkness, but a bright void.
If only more people felt that way, if only more men were heroes because of the battles they didn't fight.Claire tending to Jamie's shoulder...
Ha ha, you're in another time!The Anti-Frank: Ooooh, I think I will rape you.Claire: Eeek!Clansmen: Scots to the rescue!
And I'm going to kill the Anti-Frank for beating the shit outta of me and raping my sister.Claire: Ooooh, he's cute.
Dougal: Ye have to marry the laddie to get away from the Anti-Frank.Claire: Okay.Dougal: And ye have to have sex wit' him.Claire: Mmmmm....
And then I'm going to tell her about how me Da beat me and how much I liked it.Jealous wench: The village witch is looking for you.Claire: Okay!Villagers: She's a witch!
It is a double sin I will likely have to one day repent for by reading piles of Dostoyevsky while I tear out my hair.
Right, once again into the breach to defend myself!This book is incredibly long.
I read it in three days.
And I must admit that usually I hate time travel romances (...
It's not just about the romance.
Which is in some cases I think a direct indictment of the Scottish Highlander bodice-rippers in which everyone is shining and perfect and with awfully clean white teeth.
Throw them together in love?
I love that statement.
I remember my friend in college ( 1992ish ) coming out of her room holding a book to her chest and saying " YOU HAVE TO READ THIS BOOK".
She said it was a time-travel, romance book set in post world war II Scotland and mid 18th century Scotland.
I've since read the whole series and love it even more today.
If you've ever read a book and literally gotten so sucked in that you can't possibly read fast enough, then you know what I'm talking about.....Oh, and Jamie Fraser is a God!
Read on, GR friends, this series is epic and you won't regret it!!!P.S.
WHATTTT HOW DID I NOT MARK THIS MAGNIFICENT CREATION OF A NOVEL AS READ BEFORE??? I read this book 2 years ago and it has captured my heart and is my favorite book of all time <3
This book is my love, you all know this. It deserves an infinite amount of stars, too bad Goodreads only allows 5!Check out my review on YouTube here:http://youtu.be/FNfLLKhP-E8
I wanted to write a better review for this book to coincide with the release of the new TV series, where Jamie actually does look pretty hot...Back when I read this as a wee lass (okay, like, three years ago), there weren't quite as many interesting interpretations of the novel going on.
Readers often end up completely divided over Jamie because, although he is sweet and lovable for the majority of the novel, there is one disturbing scene that saddens and enrages any sane 21st-Century reader, including me (though not sure about the sane).So I will spoil that one thing for you if you like (it's not a major spoiler)...
(Ok, first off, there are going to be minor spoilers/hints in this review…read at your own risk, although I’ll try not to reveal too much.)Outlander is a damn good book. Sure, the book has a blue fake leather cover, costs four bucks, and screams “spinning rack at the airport bookstore”. I approached the text with suspicion but found myself invested in the language and storyline within the first hundred pages. Here’s why:TEN GOOD THINGS ABOUT OUTLANDER1.

You know when you’re watching a movie and you can tell some plot points aren’t going to get resolved until the next one?
Outlander really could have been two books.3.
It’s a flat-out good book.

Note: The *good* never have extra-marital sex in this book, that's for the evil and sluggish.Surprise upon surprise, actually Jamie is a virgin on their wedding night, but with a few leads, quickly gets into his role: 'Matrimony turns into a sacrament what would otherwise be a sin', or so it goes.In the following, this sacrament is bestowed upon darling Claire with unnerving frequency, about every two pages, but it only gets really colourful if preceded by conjugal beating - Claire did something bad, Claire has to be punished, yes, she herself aknowledges this in the end, or attempts of strangers (or *evil* husband) to rape her.Yes, and of course, after Jamie has de facto been raped and tortured by *evil* husband.
Diana Gabaldon is an amazing writer who delves deep into her character's lives and the history surrounding them, painting an extraordinary picture that truly transports the reader to another time and place.Claire is an incredibly strong heroine, who can sometimes be a bit brash and sassy, but deep down she is a kind and caring person at heart.
The author's care in seamlessly weaving all of the elements together is evident all throughout the book.While there are many things to love about this story, there were a few events that bothered me just a bit.
The love story between these two beautifully written characters actually transcends time and logic.
Theirs is a long and beautiful historic journey together reaching limits and boundaries of both heartwarming depth and gut-wrenching tragedy.
Not to be cryptic, it's just that this indescribable story is meant to be told through the words of the brilliant author, Diana Gabaldon.
Fyi...this is an incredibly long series, with 7 books published, (most average 1,000 pages), with an 8th book due in 2014.
It's a commitment to say the least, but very worth the absolute loveliness that is Gabaldon's brilliant and stunning love story.
My words will never do this series justice.
Here, I'm going to rewrite the scene that ruined this book for me.Jamie, some Highlander from the 1740's: Claire, you didn't listen to what I said.
I love you, I really do, and I don't enjoy this, but people expect me to give you the punishment you deserve.Claire, an educated woman from the 1940's: Jamie, first of all, rape never is the victim's fault.
From now, until the bitter end, I swear to God that you will regret it.Jamie, some Highlander from the 1740's who knows better than to disrespect his wife: You're right, Claire.
We should all know better than this.Find more of my books on Instagram
At one point, Jamie punishes Claire for disobeying him by literally spanking her - which was treated as perfectly understandable, and was quickly dismissed.
I know that I cringed throughout the entire thing, and found it hard to believe that any relatively modern woman would have put up with it, especially as Claire is supposed to be extremely well educated, capable and professional.
I honestly find it hard to believe that there's five more books of this, and that people read them.That said, I have read worse romance books, but the fact that Gabaldon dragged the novel out across nearly 900 pages just makes me cranky.
4.5 GREAT AWESOME COOL FANTASTIC BRILLIANTSTARS! You can find the full review and more about this book on my blog!I am going to part this review in two sections(parts) because I don't want to give spoilers away but also want to share some of the scenes I really enjoyed with people who have also read the book so we can discuss together.So the first part of the review will be SPOILER FREE and everyone can read it,and the second part will be filled with spoilers so if you haven't read the book don

If you can understand good characters doing things in their historical context that would be seen as abuse now, then give it a try.You won't be disappointed.Gabaldon has finely crafted a novel that is radically different to the stereotype.
The other problem with it is that many people are going to be uncomfortable with some of the things that happen in the book.
Remembering the time difference and the culture that the male protagonist comes from is often hard when we judge his actions by today's standards.But to readers who can over look these things, I highly recommend it as a book that is both incredibly well written, enjoyable and addictive.
Here are a bunch of pics from the TV show being filmed right now :D
I read the first 300 or so pages of the book. The first 200 had me hooked...and then the sex scenes started. I've got nothing against a sex scene or two ... but the main characters were having sex all the freaking time. And when it escalated to include violence, including a scene that I can only describe as rape (she says no, he forces her to have sex anyway), I closed the book & decided not to read anymore. I enjoy historical fiction ... just not this type of it, I suppose.
I read this book because I got tipsy after a concert and went to the bookstore and bought a ton of "Highland-hunk" romance novels on whim and Twittered about it, so I had to read them all.
Ugh. So, I read 4 other books that were hideously bad, and then this one was highly recommended to me by many on Twitter/Facebook as the cream of the crop.
I was dubious.I have to say, this is a LOVELY book.
I do recommend this book wholeheartedly, it's akin to "Gone With the Wind", unapologetically epic, sweeping and dramatic.
The book looks smaller in the picture than it is so I don't know.
I love Jamie and Claire!
♥I will say that I DID skim over the torture/rape scenes with Jamie or other things that made me cringe in the show or book.
I had put off reading this book for a very long time.
I had read some reviews in the past that said the books have too much history or descriptions but remarkably enough, I didn't feel that way.
I just loved reading about it all.
I can't read a series book without doing it in order, so I put it back on the shelf and said "Another time."Fast-Forward to 2016...I sign up for the 2016 Reading challenge: 52 books in a year (1 a week).
I finish reading a book in late June and realize I don't have anything new to read...
Vanity would probably kick in and I'd likely not make it through.I am excited to read the series, but I need to catch up on my 2016 Reading Challenge before I take on another 1000 page book.

I thought of Frank as being her past life, and although she truly loved Frank, he wasn't her soulmate like Jamie was (can I write a review without using that 'S' word?
No book is for all tastes, but I think those who might be interested in a story with a fantastic hero like Jamie, and an outstanding heroine like Claire, and those who are crazy about Scottish subject matter, should read it.7.Has the bar been raised for Scottish Highlander romance?Most definitely.
I tend to read romance books for the hero moreso than the heroine, but I love a great heroine, and Claire is definitely that.
I like long books and as I mentioned above, I liked the author's attention to detail.
There were several scenes that just went on and on and on, going into far more detail than necessary, to the point of major plot distraction.
Or really, not the existance of it in the book, but how the author chose to utilize it over and over as plot devices.
Over and over, either against Claire (she was *almost* raped something like 5-6+ times...
But the author spent A LOT of time discussing it and focusing on it, throughout the entire novel.
Of the 630 pages, about 200 of them were not great, weird, too much, 1 to 2 stars.
If the 200 pages or so that I didn't care for were edited out or abbreviated, I may have given it 5 stars.To sum it up - the author seems to have an interest in historical fiction, gratuitous sex, rape/S&M fantasies, and homo-erotic torture.
The second was not too bad at first, but after about 100 straight pages of it it got to be a bit much.
The last two were a bit disturbing.If you have an interest historical fiction and a high tolerance for questionable sex, give it a shot!
The year is 1945. Claire Randall, a former combat nurse, is back from the war and reunited with her husband on a second honeymoon--when she walks through a standing stone in one of the ancient stone circles that dot the British Isles. Suddenly she is a Sassenach--an "outlander"--in a Scotland torn by war and raiding Highland clans in the year of Our Lord...1743. First off, I am not big on “Time-travel” books but this has been on my kindle forever and with the new TV series coming out in a month
Claire is on her second honeymoon in Inverness with her husband, Frank and literally “time-travels” back 200 years to the 1700s.One of the first people she meets there is Captain Randall.
I know we all have our book boyfriends and read some “swoon-worthy” lines from our heros, but Jamie Fraser tops them all.
I loved it after that.I feel I could wax lyrical about this book forever but I fear I best wrap it up soon and head back to the world of Jamie and Claire.
Um YES. This is what I like. It took a while to get into and read as I was having to do school work and holiday festivities at the same time, but it was definitely worth it!If you like historical fiction, time travel, and/or romance, PICK THIS UP. You also get the beautiful and perfect specimen of Jamie.
Too bad here isn't a rating stronger than "didn't like" because I hated this book.
In fact, I read the entire thing just so that someone couldn't talk me out of hating it by saying "Oh, it gets better at the end" or "you really needed to read the whole thing to appreciate it".
This book isn't about Scotland or time travel, it's about Jamie and Claire having sex in different locations and positions.
Throw in a little wife beating, rape and repeated torture and you've got yourself a toned-down Marquis de Sade.
It made me want to take a shower.

Claire Randall is a nurse living in Scotland with Frank, her husband, just after the end of World War II.
Claire has an interest in Botany and studies plants along with their healing factors.One day, Claire comes across a stone circle called Craigh na Dun.
While there, she discovers a plant and can’t stop thinking about it.
She comes back another day to collect the plant near the stones and hears one of the stones scream.
The pacing was perfect and never once did I want to stop reading, except for the few parts I found a tad difficult to read.Some consider this a romance novel, but I think of it more as historical fiction.
