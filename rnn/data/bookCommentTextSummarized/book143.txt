I must buy copies of the William books for my keeper shelves - delightfully refreshing.
I'm filing these under children's books, but I can't help wondering if they are really more for the grown ups. Great fun anyway. In this one the parents seem a bit more human, so I guess RC was fleshing them out as she went along. Love the humour.
William, man. So good.
Was given this book as a child, this character is hard to hate.......
