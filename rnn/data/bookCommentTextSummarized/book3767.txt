It's written in 3rd person, almost like a moral/religious text primer, with elaborate and long-sentenced chapter titles and black and white woodcut prints throughout.The story itself, concerning the life of an orphaned girl named Doll Bilby, is both pathetic and compelling at the same time.
It doesn't help that she's also a beauty.The narrative is written in such a way as to showcase the outrage against Doll's perceived witchcrafty-ness, while at the same time provoking in the reader the very opposite effect.
Adding to the sense of drama, is this book's realistic "period voice", which again adds work and reward to the reader.[I'd love to hear a comment if you can think of a story that takes this sort of risk and fails.:]About the illustrations in the book: The wood cuts by Robert Gibbings are a pleasing blend of influence from the novel's time and a sort of style contemporary to their creation in the 1920s.========================================================================Very minor spoilers ahead.========================================================================I really love that the reader's bond with the isolated includes the main character and the [non-human:] animals.Quite a zing in that final sentence don't you think?
Why is The Crucible the story of choice in HS? This is SO much better! I love how the author gives thoughts and feelings from various characters so it is not just a one-sided glimpse into this part of history.
I found this novel more psychological than historical. Was Doll actually a witch, or was she led to believe it by jealous and superstitious people? Did she take a d√¶mon lover, or were unscrupulous men abusing her? This book is rich in horror and tragedy and interpretation. I recommend it highly. It gets better with each read.
I found an original copy from 1928 in an Antiquarian book store. It's absolutely incredible how graphic it is for a book written in 1928. Esther was a well educated woman. I plan on seeking her other writings out.
I re-read this on one sitting- I could not put it down. Nothing short of a work of genius- a lively, vivid and strange use of an unreliable "omniscient" narrator. Why is this book not more widely read?
I'd like a copy of this but it is very difficult to find.
A dark, atmospheric, psychological tale with a vividly crafted sense of time and place.
The story is interesting. It is a little hard to get past the archaic language, I often had to re-read a paragraph to understand the gist, but that also added to the authenticity of the story.
This is a superb and curious novel, set in Salem, 1600s.
Written in the style of a 17th century tract, the book tells the story of Doll Bilby, an orphan whose parents were both burned as witches.
Is Doll a witch?
Does she become the witch her accusers believe her to be?
The genius of this thought-provoking book is to provide a narrative in which each episode sustains multiple interpretations: psychological; demonic; sexual.
Told via an unreliable omniscient (or is he?) 3rd person narrator, the book fully realizes a 17th c.
Dark, strange, and marvelous - this book is a gem.
I gave this book such a high rating because I could not put it down. I had a running commentary in the back of my head based in modern ideology, but it was an interesting look into a world-view completely different from my own.
paperback
Great read, historical as well as deeply though-provoking.
another book I got from QPBC in high school.
A compelling story. Forbes' skills get the reader to like the main character despite the narrator's prejudices.
