Dad: "So...how's the book?"Me: "Hmn. Well, I like the first two thirds or so, that's all survivalist nerd stuff. But after that, it kind of turns into caveman porn."(Later that week...)Dad: "So...I borrowed your book."Me: "...Oh."(Uncomfortable silence)Me: "So...what did you think of it?"Dad: "Well, you were right, the first two thirds is for survival nerds. After that, though..."(Uncomfortable silence)Me: "Caveman porn?"Dad: "Not just that. *Bad* caveman porn!"
Oh, yeah, and also during this whole time, Jondalar hardly talks about his dead brother and when he finds out it was Ayla's cave lion that killed Thonalan (and she chased the cave lion away), he is like, "Wow, you must be a spirit to have such control over animals".(Did you know that Broud's organ created Durk?
Ayla isn't totally sure, but she thinks it is a man's organ that makes a baby, not a fight between totems.)When the two FINALLY talk it over, Jondalar initially can't get past his "Ew, she had sex with a flathead!
I loved this book soooooo much!! Ayla is my hero! There were some things but didn't keep it from my favorites list! I love Whinney and Baby, my heart soared so much! And when Ayla and Jondalar met I was so happy! I loved going on their journey of learning about one another while he healed. It was just awesome and I'm glad I got to read it üòäHappy Reading Peeps! Mel üñ§üêæüê∫
Years pass, Ayla, prospers, all the tools, clothes, shelter and food she wants, are available, still not quite happy, the now woman, will have to leave her safe, comfortable home, to meet her own species, if the sad girl can ever get out, into the hostile world, and take a big chance, but her pet friends have grown, left to follow their new mates, seldom come back to visit...
After the end of that book Ayla is out on her own, battling the elements, wild animals and her own loneliness.
But parallel to following Ayla, we also follow two men - Jondalar and his brother Thonolan, unsure of how they will fit in to Ayla‚Äôs tale.
Jondalar sleeps with numerous women on his travels with his brother and then at least 5 times when he meets Ayla!
I was so disappointed in this sequel - though I‚Äôd love to see how Ayla‚Äôs story pans out - there‚Äôs no way I could battle through 4 more books like this.
Oooo he‚Äôs a man whose been with tons of women but never felt True Love!Oooo she‚Äôs a woman who‚Äôs been raped in a way sanctioned by her culture and never had an orgasm!
Ahhhhh he‚Äôs a man who yearns to love a woman who is his equal!Ahhh she‚Äôs a woman who is good at everything but good sex!Oooooh he teaches her what real sex feels like and gets her off on the first round!Oooooh they have simultaneous orgasms the first time they Make Love!Ahhhh he‚Äôs so big!
He hurts women with his hugeness and always has to hold back!Ahhhh she‚Äôs the only woman who can totally fit his huge manhood!Oooohh Aaahhhhh Oooooohh!
This book will forever be in my heart.I wish I could read it again for the first time.UNFORGETABLE
This one goes down as my all time, #1, best read.
I learned SO many things and gained more strength and independence than I though possible.
The story is this, Ayla is cast out from her family, leaving behind her only son, to survive in the ice age and the wilderness alone.
She has the knowledge of a medicine woman, and the skills of a sling to assist her survival.
And along with her, I learned how to do all of these things.
How to survive.
My heart goes out to the Jean M.
In one we have Ayla who finds a cave, tames a horse, learns horse-riding, tames a cave lion, invents a laptop, basically kills time while waiting for some 350 pages for LL Cool Jondalar to arrive and give it her good.In the other story we learn about Jondalar, who while on some unspecified self-discovery journey is sexing his way through the prehistorical world.
This is all to show us that Ayla is in for a treat when LL Cool Jondalar finally finds his way to her.
Having recently read,  REVIEWED  and loved The Clan of the Cave Bear, I fully expected another magical story set it the distant past, long before recorded history.
The Good Despite this book, Ayla is one of most memorable characters from any book I have read.
Had the story simply focused on her and her fight for survival, the book may have been a 4 star read.
As for swearing and other adult language, it was non-existed although Ayla may discover and invent the f-word in a later book Violence  -  2.5 There were several graphic scene of animal deaths that occurred as part of hunting excursions.
5 STARSWritten in the early 80's. I suddenly find myself addicted. LOL. This one had a much different feel than the first book. Read a bit more like a romance book... but no less appealing. Loved it. Looking forward to book 3!
Whereas Cave Bear seemed genuinely interested in being taken seriously, Valley of the Horses is more interested in titillating housewives whose macrame plant holders still boast spider plants and ferns galore.
Cave Bear was hilarious, and Valley of Horses was gross porn for women who don't want to seem like they're reading porn.The upshot is that my cat liked this book better than I did.
Either someone at the library rubbed catnip into the binding, or the aforementioned macrame housewives managed to smear so much yearning, musk, and housepet dander onto the pages that my cat went completely feral whenever this book was in the room.
We're also not much in the realm of large group interactions; our cross-cultural interactions are basically between the Clan-raised Ayla and Jondalar, who's prejudiced (like the rest of his people) against the "Flatheads." The exploration of that theme isn't less strong here; it's just put on a one-on-one basis.As always, Auel's research is solid (and as usual, sometimes too much on display).
Apart from the overly descriptive aspects, and the lack of sex-pregnancy connection awareness, though, Auel's characters are believably trying to figure out for themselves what love and commitment actually means, in the context of a culture that has no real concept of either and that glorifies sexual looseness.

I'm loving this series. The author does an amazing job with the world and the characters she created. Ayla is such a strong character, having been kicked out of her clan she is forced to survive on her own. She does an amazing job with every obstacle thrown her way, she faces it head on and comes out on top. When she meets Jondalar she learns a lot about herself, I loved the interactions between them and how they both teach each other new things. Overall this was a great read, really enjoying this series.
Whereas Clan of the Cave Bear kept me turning the pages, wondering where Ayla was going to toe the line next, its sequel is bland and predictable.
There are places when she educates us without interrupting the story (for example, when the travelers predict the severity of the winter by the migratory habits of the wooly mammoth, Ayla's difficulty starting her first fire) but many times these expositories just break up the flow and cause me to glaze over.
We start out with the First Rites scene: we get cultural information and establish Jondalar's studmuffinry, both real contributions to the story.
I was under the impression that this series of books was for the "young adult" audience, mostly because I knew lots of people who read The Clan of the Cave Bear for a class in high school.
I probably would have enjoyed the sex bits a lot more in high school but now at age 30 they just kind of creeped me out.
I would be creeped out knowing my high schooler was reading this (however I wouldn't stop him, I'm all for reading whatever you want).
I am still giving this book 4 stars though because I thoroughly enjoyed Ayla's relationships with Whinney and Baby.
If you skip every page that mentions Jondalar, this is the best book ever!Minus one star for Jondalar's existence.
The second book accomplished the same, in some ways, and I really enjoyed reading it for the most part, but something was missing, and some flaws weren't easy to overlook.The first book had very little dialogue, because the Clan (Neanderthals) didn't speak verbally.
Despite the ingrained misogyny in their species, I liked that there were clear, structured customs for Ayla (our main character) to navigate and challenge.In this book, we still have Ayla, out on her own, as well a new character, Jondalar.
I still enjoyed Auel's writing, despite it being a bit silly.
It is not so much that you have to suspend belief and accept that her protagonists, Ayla and Jondalar, discovered everything and rewrote the course of human history; you just have to realize that the narrative that Ms. Auel has constructed is comprised of a series of monumental events that allowed anatomically modern humans to be successful; much of which has been validated through advances in archaeology and anthropological research.
The amazing story of young Ayla's lonely journey to her valley, her survival, her domestication of 'Whinny,' and her eventual meeting of Jondalar is just wonderful and thought-provoking; and a story that resonates and has meaning for all humans today.
This is one of those books where I recognise that the writing is not stellar but there‚Äôs just something about the story that makes me love it. The first half of this book did drag a bit with things being over explained. I‚Äôm really never going to build a canoe and I don‚Äôt need a step by step guide on how to do that. Once the middle of the book came I breezed through it. Loving the interactions between the characters. Onto the next!!
Unfortunately this was not as good as it's predecessor, The Clan of the Cave Bear, there was a lot less showing and a lot more telling.
I still liked Ayla, even though she was perfect in almost every way (and I don't mean that in a good sense), her emotions where very real.
I am totally fascinated by this era, and I'm so glad I was introduced to it by Jean M.
The Story: Ayla shares a lonely valley with a herd of steppe ponies, harnesses their power, and discovers speech and love with Jondalar, a member of her own race.
I kind of cringe to admit I bought this book with my babysitting money and read it when I was 14 thinking it was about a young woman and a horse.
The salesclerk valiantly did try to discreetly inform my mom that it wasn't really YA reading, but failed to stress that it was because of the sex.
I have loved the epic saga of series from the first time I read it and still find myself occasionally lost in imagining Ayla and Jondalar's journey and life together, and the alternate paths it could have taken, especially since I now have a horse of my own and am learning Natural Horsemanship.

Watching Ayla discover the nature of the world around her was genuinely exciting.This book really made me think about the way things are.
Although Ayla's world is different from ours, she too has to deal with learning new things.
She's incredibly modest and curious, and I think that more people should question nature the way she does.People are too accepting in our world, and I am not excluding myself in that generalization.
When she is alone with Jondalar, she has no trouble questioning every little thing he does.And without question I think that it is normal for people to be curious and unsure when introduced to something new.
Her sudden grasp of Jondalar's language was stupid as well, like the author said, 'well, I'm getting bored with all these language barrier issues, so Ayla's just going to get it now.'And the sex?
Jondalar the Sex God seems to be the author's fantasy man, and why in the world would Ayla, who's only every had sex with one man before, and only every had one child, be able to take his huge p*nis more easily than all the older, more experienced women he'd had before then?
I thought one of the fascinating things about the book where the many instances Of speculation of how prehistoric people may have advanced in skills and practices.Then a man comes into her life who it turns out is one of the Others often alluded to by the Clan.
So with the man and woman coming together we have two very different cultures and experiences thrown together in a very isolated environment who need to work things out.There is a fair amount of fairly graphic sex that I would classify as more erotic than pornographic.
Jean Auel's research brings the stone age to life, wrapping around the story like a perfect mammoth skin blanket.
For a big book, it rocked along.This second outing to the distant B.C. grinds along like Ayla is dragging a big stone block behind her.
Did the critics of The Clan of the Cave Bear say something like, "Great book, but there weren't any explicit sex scenes.
It ain't kidney stones and the cure is for him to go at it hammer and tongs with the newly discovered catwalk model Ayla.I suppose you could argue that Jondalar has to be amazing because he got all the good family genes.
By the time one reaches the fifth book (which again, I do not recommend they try), one is ready to throw it out the window, for Ayla has figured out exactly how the world works, even though her fellow humans have not, and has invented five million new things, and is the model for about half of the pre-historic art that has ever been discovered.
There is also a heavy interest in sex throughout their travels and their homo sapien culture, which comes off as Auel's overwhelming desire to write smut.
What interests me -- which I also mentioned in my review of The Clan of the Cave Bear-- is how a human adapts and survives in an unknown and alien environment.
I always love to read how Ayla discovers the valley, begins to find food, makes herself a home, teaches herself to hunt large animals, makes friends with a horse, begins to train the horse to help her while hunting, and so on.
Every once in a while I like to read the end parts where Ayla and Jondalar meet and fall in love too -- because I am just as much of a romantic as most women.
