I have read many short stories by great Indian writers like Shivani, Dharamveer Bharti and of course, Premchand.
The story reveals around a number of characters, but majorly around two best friends, Amritrai and Daannath.
As luck would then have it, Prema's best friend, Poorna turned into a widow soon after.
Prema's brother, Kamala Prasad a money oriented man, was asked to convince Poorna to come home but he ends up falling in love with her (or was itÂ lust?) and that is how the story continues.
For any person who appreciates Indian classics, this book is a must-read.
Going through pages, I completely relate it with current on-going situation in India.
My second Prem Chand read after Godan.
I am in love with his simple and impactful writings.
It's amazing how he, with the utmost ease, explains each and every aspect of Indian society from all angles through various characters.
His characters make you traverse through each and every dimension of the plagues of our erstwhile Bharat (widow marriage in this case).
The thing that stands out to me in thia story is how the protagonist takes along the society one step ahead with his belief in doing what is just not what is just propogated for centuries.I would give it a 4.5/5.
The novel describes an era of Indian culture when widow remarriages were not so prevalent. The story is quite apt and does not exaggerate, in any way, the lives and situations of the characters at that time which proves the 'stick to the roots' nature of Munshi Premchand's work.
its good.......
