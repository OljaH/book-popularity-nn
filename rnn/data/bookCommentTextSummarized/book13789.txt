Power Vs. Force explains the connection between individual levels of consciousness and human behavior.
Hawkins uses Applied Kinesiology as a tool for doing consciousness research.
According to consciousness research, Dr. Hawkins states that anything below 200 level of consciousness is negative, false, weak, Force therefore not life sustaining and anything above 200 is positive, true, Power and life sustaining.
At the same time we have align ourselves with everything that is positive, true Power and life sustaining.But how can know what to avoid and what to align with?
This book is over-hyped by people who should know better.
They say "are you hungry?" and try to push your arm down, and if it holds firm, that means, "yes, time to eat." If your muscles react weakly and your arm falls to your side, that means "dude, I'm stuffed." What?!Does that sound plausible?
This is pseudo-science, a waste of time, and not even interesting from the perspective of "hmm some people believe this crap?"I was going to sell mine back to Amazon, but instead I thought, "this book is taking advantage of the weak-minded" and I tossed it in the trash.
This book was like a person covered in marshmallow fluff wanting to hug you.Total fail.
I don't know what my brain thought when I saw this and ordered it, but definitely not this.
I think some people would categorize this as hippy-dippy, but for me it seemed like a rather disturbing amalgamation from the bits I skimmed.
I started with the Preface and went, 'Hmm...'; then moved onto to the Introduction and was like, 'Well, there's that'; and finally, just started reading opening and closing paragraphs of each section, concluding that this was really not a me book.
Maybe wayback, like when I was 15.
This book focuses on the deciphering what is true and what is false through applied kinesiology.
Through applied kinesiology the author has formulated a ladder of consciousness 0 - 1000.
For example, the 4 minute mile for a long time was considered impossible, however once the goal was reached an attractor pattern was revealed to "human consciousness" and the 4 minute mile came into the realm of possible - others began to replicate and improve upon this feat.Linear vs non-linear causality.
If I used these techniques more often I'd probably be living a better life, but I am sometimes thwarted by my own cynicisms.If anything, this book provides some good food for thought.
This is an excellent book that speaks of the difference between power and force.
Power is quiet and requires no explanation.
Force is coercive and creates an automatic counterforce.This has great applicability for couples, parents and bosses.
Standing on the side of truth, justice and all that sustains life is power.
Force represents all that is negative and life destructive.Whenever you attempt to make someone do something that they don't want to do, you are applying force.
This always creates a counterforce.
Whenever you attempt to coerce someone else, you create a measure of resistance.
You cannot win with force.
Its message is powerful!
This is an amazing book that details, (from subtitle) "The Hidden Determinants of Human Behavior". It is engaging to peek into the psychology, both conscious and subconscious, of the underlying behavior patterns and choices made throughout life. Yes, you may find this book on the self help shelves (shudder!), but in this case, it will actually help many of us to overcome negative behaviors, converting them into positives. As I like to say, we can all use less "nega-thought" and more "posi-thought" in our lives, eh?
It starts a bit slow but then after a couple of chapters it really picks up and unveils absolutely fascinating research on different levels of human consciousness.
The book is filled with examples, and I could definitely relate to a lot of things being said about the influences of environments and people around us.
This is an evergreen piece of material that people will be as fascinated a 100 years from now as I was reading it in today's time.
Highly recommended for those who seek to expand their knowledge of human consciousness and really take your life to the next level.
Hawkin's cosmological argument is imprecise, incomplete and ultimately flawed, though reasonable enough at a glance--the conclusion to which is that we united mind-body selves are connected to a wholly interconnected universe.
For, even if we are connected to the universe, and to things of it, and connected in knowledge ways, Hawkins demands (with appeal to science, though no evidence) that your arm (in the right conditions) serves to ascertain knowledge, and that truth knowledge (now abandoning his non-Western concept for an intentionally simple, Western concept) can yield value measurments with the same method!
So, ignore the mathematical evaluations, ignore the dream of knowing everything with your simple arm, and ignore the noetic argument about your reation to the universe.
He sees in each patient “the shining essence of love and beauty” and the patient is healed by his/her own recognition of who he/she really is.
The British Empire represented Force (calibrated at 175) and power always wins against force.Hawkins has calibrated each sentence and chapter in the book to check for their truth.
The calibrated levels of truth of the chapters are given at the back of the book and range from 710 to 890.I would thus strongly advise everyone to read this book - it may raise your consciousness!
ENLIGHTENED: STRONGLY RECOMMEND FOR THOSE STRUGGLING WITH TRUTH David R. Hawkins, M.D., Ph.D. has established a powerful measure of consciousness .Substantial conceptualization of human behavior .Fresh view on how your body expounds and reacts to people and objects around us . A intellectual description of aggressive behavior . A challenging read . But worth the endeavor. Looking forward to reading more from this brilliant man and magnificent writer THINK: VALOR VS. RAGE
Here are some random thoughts because the book makes me too angry to even compose a thoughtful review: He explains the levels of energy in one chapter (never really explaining how he could possibly measure this stuff), then he discusses cultures based on this same scale.
The reason for this - as far as I can figure - is when you prioritize essence (or the whole) over existence (or specific people, places, things) what does it matter if you break a few eggs?
And though most people would at least argue that reason leads to the realization of essence over and above existence, he is trying to get us to ignore reason, which is worse.
Under his scientific kinesiological system (testing muscle reactions to good and bad stimuli), Hawkins rates human traits on a numeric scale.
Hawkins says currenly that only "twelve persons on the planet" calibrate at 700 or above.
In this hierarchical scale, power increases and force recedes.
Force is partial, selfish, negative energy and unhealthy.
Hawkins believes his system reveals the evolution of consciousness and this will lead to the salvation of humankind.Hawkins has a story to tell and he does a good job at weaving it all together.
No doubt there's much to be said about the power of positive thinking.
If this helps people, that's a good thing.
This could have been a decent book had Hawkins presented his ideas, many of which are valid, as philosophy.
Instead, he presents a so-called system based on kineseology that claims it can detect truth from falsehood.
He claims if you don't believe him it is of a lower mind, it's negative, it's false.
His followers seem to think he is enlightened and their so-called science claims that only someone who knows enlightenment can describe it.
That you can't fake this on an intellectual level.
His megalomania needs much more attention than that.
A true state of enlightenment needs no recognition.
Another read by my hubs that is inexplicably linked to my GR account. Some day I’ll figure out how to unlink them. Today is not that day. 😴
108 has transformed the way I see motivation and how to inspire my children.Power Vs. Force by p.108“On examination we will see that power arises from meaning.
Power is always associated with that which supports the significance of life itself and dignifies- ennobles.
Force must always be justified, whereas power requires no justification.
Force is associated with judgment and makes us feel badly about ourselves.“Force always creates counter-force; its effect is to polarize rather than unify.
Constantly faced with enemies, force requires constant defense.
Force incites the powers of darkness and the results are within that sphere.
So the two stars are I suppose because I see myself as a lover of the truth, but this book is a case of the spititual/religious trying to make or use people's ideas of science to prove or validate itself (pseudoscience).
And the darn thing about that is much of the writing is so uplifting and good - and as a fan of Bhudism and Christianity I think the basic idea is right - so why does it even need to try and do that.
Another strange thing is I can't find out anything about Dr. Hawkins on Wikipedia, even though I know he's a big name out there.

يبدأ بشرح اختبار انقباض العضلات للحصول على إجابة بنعم او لا على أسئلة ثم تأثر الإنسان و جسده بالمؤثرات الخارجية بأنواعها حتى دون وعي منهم ثم شرح مستويات الوعي على سلم من 0-1000 و يقسمها إلى درجات بحسب درجة الوعي و وصفها و الشعور المرتبط بها ثم يشرح بعدها ارتباط درجات الرعي بشتى جوانب الحياة .رغم أني لم استوعب كثيرا آلية الاختبار الذي أخذ يذكره الكاتب ( انقباض العضلات للمعرفة جواب سؤال معين و تأثر العضلات بالمؤثرات الخارجية ) إلا أن الكتاب في المجمل جيد رغم أني احتاج لرؤية مدى فاعلية هذا الاختبار في الواقع فعلا و كيف يتم قياس نتيجته و نحوها ..
Dr. Hawkins is a master of science and spirituality, which is too rare of a combination.
Hawkins' Map of Consciousness offers a context for understanding how people, cultures, religions, and texts aid or hinder the path.
Using muscle testing, Hawkins calibrates various myths, truths, and social systems with a clear intent: what brings us closer to the essence of the unfolding spirit of creation.
A masterpiece and landmark study, even for those who finding the science suspect, as Hawkins story and storytelling make the case for bringing heaven to earth one enlightenment at a time.
I found this book to be mentally invigorating and spiritually resonant.
My favorite books are the ones that change the mind of the reader, thereby changing the way they view the world.
This book took my stagnant lens and turned it around and around until I found myself viewing a world I had glazed over with mis-creations.
It was a faster read this way, my mind never strayed, and for those of us who require scientific rhetoric to explain spiritual experiences this novel rises to the occasion without reading like an outdated textbook.
This is a book the shaped the way I look at everything in life dramatically. It's about what power is, in the sense of, what really affects and changes life, human behavior, and experience of the universe. Here Dr. Hawkins introduces his intelligent Scale of Consciousness.
He began work in psychiatry in 1952 and is currently the director of The Institute for Advanced Theoretical Research.The proposition that Dr. Hawkins presents in this book is "…the human mind is like a computer terminal connected to a giant database.
I invite you to read about it and try it for yourself.Using this method, Dr. Hawkins has made a logarithmic scale ranking of different levels of consciousness, from shame (20) to courage (200) to enlightenment (700 – 1,000).According to Dr. Hawkins, effectiveness of activity from the higher states of consciousness is based on power, the influence of good or leadership.
This might be a 5 star book but my reviews are stingy today ;-) What I found of immense value here was 1) the evolutionary scale of human consciousness (which maps well onto the Abraham/Hicks emotional guidance scale) 2) the very clear discussion of how the context of one's state of consciousness strongly affects the creation of meaning/truth for that person 3) the very extensive discussion of very high states of consciousness by an author who has achieved enlightenment.You don't need to worry about the kinesiology to get the above very awesome stuff out of the book-- just start on page 90 or so, with the descriptions of states of consciousness.As far as kinesiology goes, I do a one person version of it myself, but my results while worthwhile do not allow me to place absolute faith in it.
A tough read at times, but many interesting and enlightening concepts.
It explores many spiritual concepts of "good" vs.
"religion" and discusses certain events in history (courtesy of hindsight, I might add)and how they "tested" to be good or bad.
There's a lot of discussion on "calibrating" ourselves, elements of our history, discerning between "truth" and "falsehood" and discussing the elements of enlightenment.
Overall, I would recommend this as a solid work for anyone interested in exploring spiritual growth, especially as it relates to your own internal psychology and how we interact on multiple planes with the rest of the world and humanity.
Hawkins provides the certainty that there is truth; immovable unspinnable and accessible to us all using scientific principles.
Well the amazing human nervous system it turns out is connected to the collective consciousness and this book provides methods developed over 30 years of testing that will allow anyone to tap into it!
In addition we learn that different human emotions test out at different level of vibration, and that individuals perceptions of events are entirely colored by their vibrational level.This book will rile a lot of people.
this book will resonate with you...
Dr. David R.
Hawkins encompasses particle physics, nonlinear dynamics, chaos theory, and his own discoveries about the nature and accessibility of truth.
"Power vs.
Force" is the foundation of Dr. Hawkins' large body of work.
I met the Doc at a lecture in 2004, at the Unity Church, in Novato, California.
He was giving a lecture on his book, Power vs.
Force, and it was so powerful-- I sold my home and took off around the world with a backpack to stand in Holy sites, which Hawkins said had a transference effect on our levels of consciousness.
This book shapes worldviews. The information presented in this book ranks among the most influential in my entire life. It is clear, reproducible, verifiable, and significant. I don't know what I can add to what others have already said about it. However, if you have stumbled upon or have been drawn to this book in some way before, but have not read it yet, please hesitate no longer. Read it if you will.
Certainly a worthwhile read with some mind blowing concepts. He provides a recontextualization of life using the muscle testing technique. His writing style was quite academic which left more to be desired and certainly many lay readers would find off-putting. Wish he described more of the technique itself or its variations that could be done without two people. Overall a 4.5.
Heavy read - but it WILL change the way you understand social psychology/sociology forever. We're talking quantum physics here, People. And when you finally see the difference between Power and Force - their constant tug-of-war over the masses, it leaves you no choice but to try to raise your "level" immediately to one capable of bringing more Power to the world.
EVERYONE should read this book. Facinating. The author has come up with a "scale" to test levels of consciousness. Anything below 200, is considered negitive energy and will prevent one from moving forward in life. Amazing. I will re-read this one over and over.
wow! so much to take in. amazing though! powerful book!! i might actually have to read this one again. and i rarely feel that a book is actually worth it to do that. highly recommend. :)peace, love, and light.
