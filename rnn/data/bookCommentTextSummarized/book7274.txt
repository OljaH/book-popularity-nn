Sure, it's launched careers from Shirley Jones to Hugh Jackman.
On the other hand, while the team would excel at creating complex, antiheroic protagonists later (Billy Bigelow in "Carousel," The King in "The King and I"), the two created here are somewhat undercooked.
Curly is portrayed as almost a perfect cowboy clich√©, except for the scene where he repeatedly insists that Jud should probably kill himself and is better off dead; Jud, on the other hand, is unevenly characterized as sometimes dangerous psychopath, sometimes bumbling buffoon.
Overall, though, "Oklahoma!" can feel like a first draft for a career that would later improve considerably.
On one side she finds herself liking the handsome and kind (though a little arogant at times) cowboy Curly, yet on the other she feels herself attracted to the dangerous farm hand Jud Fry. Confusion on who to love seems to be a theme in Oklahoma, as Ado Annie, friend of Laurie's and part time comic relief, finds herself between Will Parker and Ali Hackim.
I think it's an amazing play in every way, to the fun of the unintelligent Will Parker, to the depth of creepiness portrayed by Jud through his song "Lonley Room" and his confession to killing a girl and her family for not dating him.

I offer the classic review of a musical's script: it has such catchy tunes.
Performed with WHS in 2008
My favorite R&H, and has been for years. I don't care what anyone says. Laurie and Curly will always be in my heart, not to mention the Grandmother, Ado Annie, and Will Parker!
