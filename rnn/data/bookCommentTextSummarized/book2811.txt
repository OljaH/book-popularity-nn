one of the first queer books ever published, and still one of the most edgy in its writing style and its protagonists' disinterest in being a part of mainstream society's rituals.
the narrative is haphazard - a great reflection of the characters' lives.hooray, young and evil, you go!
I guess some things never change.and hey I just wanted to add that the other reviews for this novel (all 2 of them!) are clearly written by morons who are either just now learning to read or who prefer the comforting prose style of People magazine.
Charles co-wrote it (the exact nature of who-wrote-what has never been completely established) with Parker Tyler (who would later go on to write some of the best books on underground and gay cinema) when both were young and full of poetry, lust and drink and drugs, 30 years before the Beats would try and claim they were doing something new...I found the bravery and honesty of its queerness very beautiful indeed.
There's a great story in here about bohemian gayboys in early 1930s Manhattan, but it's been rendered nearly unreadable by an annoyingly experimentalist prose style: no punctuation and sentences that range from understandable to ambiguous to utterly mystifying. For all that, it gets two stars rather than one because there are some fascinating scenes (drag ball in Harlem, anyone?) and a few poetic turns of phrase that verge on sheer genius.
