Crichton is pretty much the king of speculative science fiction.
If you read a Crichton book and don't say to yourself, "Damn!
Science is scary!", then you missed the point.
This was not my favorite book of his, but it was very good.
These did not make it bad by any means, but super confusing and unbelievable (in a few cases it kind of led to some plot holes, too.)Despite any minor complaints I might have, I can easily recommend this book to someone who likes a good techno-thriller.
Also, if you do like Crichton's other works, you really can't go wrong here.
Good read! very intriguing with the addition of a little mystery,plot twists & turns into the storyline then maybe its a bit of uncertainty towards the ending because this story do have a continuation vibe..well written (paperback!)
Back in Silicon Valley , in California, everything seems the same, cutthroat as usual, business is business, the weak fall, and the vicious prevail until another stronger one arrives...Jack Forman is unemployed, he lost his job six months ago, finding corruption can have hazardous consequences , companies are not happy with whistle blowers .
Julia is coming from the valley but he doesn't trust her anymore.
Jack and a few friends must travel in the desert's night air and find the dust creatures unknown nest, destroy or be destroyed by them, that is the fact.
I loved this book. It was very creative and imaginative and very strange in a "good way". I think Michael Crichton is one of the best if not the best Science Fiction writers!  I highly recommend this book and give it 5 shining 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟 stars
Prey is about the development of an imaging technology for the military using nanotechnology to create molecular cameras that work together in swarm formations to take photos behind enemy lines.
Sphere as aliens in it though.• It is odd when Crichton is in the middle of narrating the character’s domestic strife and suddenly slips in and out of science infodump mode.• As an SF author he not a patch on the likes of Clarke and Asimov but he probably has a wider mainstream readership.• Prey was optioned for a movie adaptation years ago, so far nothing.
Artificial intelligence morphing into artificial life, threatening life as we know it. Nano-bots and their hive mentality, swarming and learning. Sounds like a winner, but it didn't even reach mediocre for me. The uber-thin characterizations capped it. I remember liking this author's Jurassic Park and The Andromeda Strain, but this one didn't do much for me.
DNF at page 175/369.Dear book, It's me, not you. I was really into you in the beginning, but you lost me when you got too technical. That's when I lost my interest in you. There was no coming back from that. While I found your premise fascinating and terrifying at the beginning, after you lost me, the premise wasn't interesting to me anymore. This is purely me, and is not your fault. You see, I have an addiction to the Kate Daniels series. I was spending time with you while waiting for the buddy
I was really into you in the beginning, but you lost me when you got too technical.
That's when I lost my interest in you.
While I found your premise fascinating and terrifying at the beginning, after you lost me, the premise wasn't interesting to me anymore.
I was spending time with you while waiting for the buddy reread I'm doing of Kate Daniels to be ready for the next book.
I'm sorry for the one star rating I'm giving you.
However, I always rate DNFs with one star, so I would've hurt the rest of the shelf's feelings if I didn't.

I remember I first learned that Jurassic Park was actually a book - that was sometime last year.
Throughout the adventure in Nevada, Jack learns the truth about the nanocameras, the truth about Ricky and Julia, and Jack even gets to meet some of his former employees.
The book is also written in Michael Crichton's informal style, and that makes Prey that much more exciting and fun to read.
It was always going to be asking too much to go 3 for 3 (5 star ratings for both Jurassic Park and Timeline). This was still a fairly entertaining book. I think the science was there, for some reason Crichton fails to add in the element of horror or fear. This results in a big 'So, what?' factor. Still a good book, but read Timeline or Jurassic Park firstTimelineJurassic Park
I used to love Crichton. I got on a kick in high school where I read Jurassic Park, Terminal Man, Andromeda Strain, and Congo, and I liked them all. The stories and characters were overused stereotypes, but I always felt like I learned something because Crichton did such thorough research.The last 2 I tried to read were Timeline and Prey. I couldn't even finish either one. The science was SOOO bad. I don't know if I've just gotten more sophisticated, or if he's jumped the shark, but I can't imagine trying to read another one of his books again.
FIRST you'll be doing this before you get there....BUT you'll need to remember this for the second thing.....I mean, I was HOOKED after that and honestly made this nanorobotic swarm too creepy, in a weird way gave me the chills once in awhile, it kept me up to almost 3 in the morning, and the end was.......WOW!
Probably the worst book I have ever read (and believe me, that's saying something!). Michael Crichton (who used to write so well!) offends every branch of the sciences in this book. Suspending disbelief is one thing, but to buy this book would require a frontal lobotomy. Unless you want to have your intelligence offended, don't bother.
HAHAHAHAHAHAHA....!Yeah, I'm exaggerating here, and having finished a Michael Crichton book from first page to last should not be the (only) benchmark to judge whether people are just shallow-minded or not.
I would love to have Crichton as my Science teacher.Hailed as a typical Michael Crichton classic, Prey is a book about a group of white-collar scientists and engineers embarking on an ambitious project only to have things turn awry and ultimately out of their control when they come to realize their so-called project seems to have a mind of its own and turns against the researchers.
Like all Chrichton books, I really enjoyed this blend of modern technology, science, and fiction. It's an entertaining way to learn something new while enjoying a decent story. Yeah, it can be a slower read at times while you work thru the descriptive science, but I never felt that it distracted from the experience. Not as good as Jurassic Park, but a tad better than Sphere and much better than Congo, Timeline, & Eaters of the Dead.
I chose this book for my science project and was pleasantly surprised by how good it was. I usually do not enjoy science books but I found this one very exciting and interesting. I would recommend it to all looking for a good science book to read.
Ok so did jack succeed or what?!??This was a very cloak and dagger type read. It was full of mysteries, and non-stop action! The lead character was a noble hero!! I don't think anyone could not root for him. But I am worried for the supporting characters... WHAT HAPPENED TO THEM!!! The story was a little far fetched. But idk maybe it's something that could happen, all this technology getting better and better, more and more complicated EVERYDAY!!!Kinda frightening when you think of it that way....
This is the only book I have intentionally left on a plane after reading it. It is so mind-numbingly stupid as to defy belief. Its pretty sad when completely nonsensical science gets combined with a dumb story. Get either of them about right and I'm happy, get both of them terribly wrong and I want my money back.
I had to read this book for my second-semester artificial intelligence class because it deals with nano-bots that use swarm-intelligence--something we were studying at the time.
Basically the idea is that large groups of individually "stupid" agents can potentially display seemingly intelligent behavior.
Think about insects: ants are a good example.
It's a big area of research in AI right now: the idea being that you can make really cheap, individual robots that exhibit some desired intelligent behavior when working together.
Of course, they're all using small robots with wheels, because there's no such thing as flying nano-bots (yet...
Although the book is ostensibly about nanotechnology gone wrong, and includes a decent amount of info on nanotech (including a reading list at the back of the book), it really progresses more like a horror novel... As always with Crichton's books, the writing is very straightforward but eminently readable.... but too much of Crichton's extremly ill-informed and annoying personal opinions come through in the book.
Hated this book! I am convinced that this was done by a ghost writer as it was not up to Crichton's normal detailed story telling. I was bored, I didn't believe the story, and the characters were flat for me. Gag.
(Review to come)
U uvodu autor opisuje kako će se nano tehnologija, molekularna biologija i umjetna inteligencija (kompjuterski programi koji sami uče) spojiti i tako će doći do stvaranja novog oblika života čije ponašanje i daljni razvoj ne možemo unaprijed predvidjeti.
Dobro, ovo sad zvuči kao sapunica, no uklopljeno je u radnju i dobiva se uvid u psihu glavnog lika.
Crichton je htio spojiti obiteljsku dramu sa glavnim zapletom, ali nažalost drugi dio romana mijenja tempo i rekao bih žanr pa postupno iz ozbiljnog znanstveno utemeljenog trilera prelazi u akcijski SF B kategorije s elementima trasha.
Svakako je mogao barem izostaviti pojašnjenje na kraju - kao da je bio problem povezati radnju.
A really good hard science fiction novel illustrating the potential danger of nanotechnology would be a welcome addition.
Here’s the plot: Somewhere in the Nevada desert, a hi-tech corporation has been experimenting with nanotechnology swarms.
Jack Foreman, an expert in designing computer programs that mimic the behavior of swarming animals, is called in to deal with the swarm.
Jack’s wife is a Vice-President at the firm, but she hasn’t clued Jack into the big picture.
I won’t give it away, but the swarm evolves so rapidly – and unbelievably – it’s difficult to sustain belief in the storyline.
A technology experiment - combining bio and nano tech brings out unexpected results (quite expectedly!) and a crisis of sorts.
Jack takes care of the kids and despite his best efforts finds it difficult to get a job, especially as his exit from the previous company had issues - though for no fault of his.Jack finds himself drawn to issues at Xymos - to rein in organisms which have gone out of control.
There is tragedy, quite a bit of it and the book has good pace throughout.The books also brings out the dangers of technology - if we are not careful with it.
Ehh, it was alright. The concept was interesting but the characters were quite bland for my taste. The little kid who kept saying "It's not fair" was quite annoying. The ending I liked and the author explained just about everything that was going on and how it all went down. Overall the subject of the book was interesting and raises some questions about nanotechnology but the book itself was about average.
Me encantó! Es muy ingenioso lo que propone y se ve que se basa en hechos científicos reales, hace tiempo que quería leer algo más del autor, sólo había leído Rescate en el tiempo que me encantó también.
Highly enjoyable !
Before this book, the only experience I had with Crichton was the film adaptation of Jurassic Park, a movie I had never seen until my girlfriend urged me to watch it.
Like Park (and several other Crichton titles), Prey is about science gone awry and causing terror in the lives of the scientists involved as well as their families, i.e. normal folks.
The star of the show is Jack Forman, an unemployed software programmer who was fired for discovering an internet scandal.
Re-read after thirteen years. Still, it was an entertaining read. A techno-thriller, but I enjoyed reading the SF part of it: a bit of Biotechnology, added with Nanotechnology & Self-evolving Artificial Distributed Intelligence. Good suspense and pace. The theme of the book is not yet dated. The book's message, to us humankind, is about the dangers of inventions when Biotech and Nanotech converges with Computer Programming and AI.Suggested reading, at least once. :)
