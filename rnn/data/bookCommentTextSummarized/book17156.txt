#16 "Enter if you dare...."Lizzy, her parents, her younger brother and his friend are all on their way to Zoo Gardens Theme Park, but when her father leaves the map at home and they take a wrong turn they end up staring at a sign that reads "Welcome to Horrorland where nightmares come to life!" The attractions seem fun and everyone's excited to try things out. Things turn scary very quickly however. Suddenly things aren't so fun anymore.
This is the story of Lizzy, who is going on a day trip with her parents and brother, Luke, and Luke's friend, Clay.They stumble upon Horrorland, an amusement park in the middle of nowhere, and their nightmare begins.This was a very quick read, very entertaining and I really enjoyed it. I had forgotten just how much I enjoyed these books, and I would like to read more.
But the family gets horribly lost and stumbles onto a remote amusement park called HORRORLAND.As soon as they get out of their car to buy tickets, their car explodes.Yes, you heard me correctly.
Dad is told there are no phones in the park, but "We'll take care of it." This is said by the ticket-taker, a person dressed up like a giant monster.
(hide spoiler)]Like I said, this is some weird &^%$....I am enjoying my trip down Memory Lane with Stine's Goosebump series immensely.
Recuerdo las pesadillas que me causaba la serie Escalofríos de niño, que me encantaba, y que veía a pesar de tenerlo prohibido, debido a las mismas pesadillas. Años después me entero de que estaba basada en una serie de libros, y tenía que leerlos sí o sí.Éste es el primero de ellos que leo. Es muy corto y ligero, además de entretenido; es espeluznante y verdaderamente extraño. Al ser infantil, es muy fácil de leer y se va en una sentada. Tiene un final muy bueno.Me gustó mucho.
This is, I think, the most popular in the Goosebumps series, right?
This also might be my favorite.The Morris family plan to go to Zoo Gardens but accidentally end up at Horrorland, where people dress up as "Horrors" and plan to kill you and not let you leave.
The rides are even a bit suspecious, like a coffin river dide, a deathly game show, and a unescapable maze.This was, like I said, my possible favorite out of all of them.
I love this one, and if you or your kids love horror stories, this is their thing.
If you haven't read Goosebumps, you're missing out.
Rating: 4/5This is where it all begun.
Lizzy, her brother Luke, their parents and Luke's friend Clay are terribly lost.
They can't seem to find their way to Zoo Gardens Theme Park, so when the see a sign for Horrorland they decide to give it a try.
Big mistake since the rides there are not just scary but deathly.One Day at Horrorland was very entertaining.
I don't remember it being so much fun.
I loved Horrorland, best theme park ever.
And Lizzy was not such a bad MC either, her brother though was really annoying.
Ahhh, the Goosebump days. I would borrow so many of these from the library they seriously considered extending my limit of books checked out at one time. R.L. Stine you were a reprieve from a harsh and dreary childhood in which my mind wandered far away from the troubles of the day. I stole books into my bed and read far into the night by the faintest of lights. I might have better eyesight were it not for you; however, I regret not one page or line.
It tells the family that Horrorland is just one mile away if they are in for some frightful fun.Of course the kids are stoked when they see the sign and they coax their dad to head to the theme park.
I wouldn’t know, my car has never blown up.) The monster tells him that there are no phones whatsoever in the theme park, not even a payphone, and if they would like they could enter Horrorland and visit for a few hours while they figure out the car situation.
Ofcourse, R.L. Stine has created a book that can give you nightmares.
A family of two parents and two siblings, after losing their way to zoogardens, travel to a nearby amusement park that is in the middle of nowhere.
It is called horrorland.
At first, they thought the land was pretty good and it was free.
They finally found their parents who eventually also thought the same.
They were in a game show, survived, and went home.amazing bookamazingi thought it was for lil kidsbut rl stine's books are for all to read right?
"Un día en Horrorlandia" es uno de los grandes clásicos de la serie. Me resultó super entretenido, ideal para estas fechas.
Estes livros fizeram parte da minha infância e adolescência assim como a série televisiva o que eu gostava bastante de ver! Ainda me relembro daquela música da intro!Gostei de entrar nesta aventura e relembrar momentos da vida que me fizeram entrar no mundo da leitura!Muita gente não conhece estes livros mas aconselho a pegarem num e lerem! Talvez sejam surpreendidos!
The other day I was checking my parents library and I found this little book I read while I was still going to school.
L. Stine books is like a juvenile prelude to the books of Stephen King and the truth is that It's a great and scary one.Spanish version:El otro día estaba revisando la librería de mis padres y encontré este pequeño libro que leí cuando aún iba a la escuela.
Stine es como la antesala juvenil para leer los libros de Stephen King y la verdad es que al releer la sinopsis tuve el vago recuerdo del miedo que sentí al leerla.
Ik zat dus helemaal fout met mijn 'Het horrorhuis was mijn favoriet'! Kwam deze cover tegen en opzekers dus dat dít mijn favoriet was en dat ik hier (te) vaak boekbesprekingen over schreef. Ooooh, wat baal ik dat ik die serie heb weggegeven, heb instant zin om te re-readen. Nja, misschien eens kijken of ik ergens de Engelstalige op de kop kan tikken voor een re-read, lijkt me ook wel heel leuk!
Κάπως κοινότυπο το όλο concept αλλά παρ' όλα ταύτα μια ιστορία που έχει τα φόντα να προκαλέσει... ανατριχίλες. Τα λούνα παρκ, άλλωστε, ήταν πάντα "αμφίβολοι" χώροι, που την ίδια στιγμή μπορούν να προσφέρουν ψυχαγωγία αλλά και να τρομοκρατήσουν τα πλήθη. Αξίζει να διαβαστεί γιατί θα παίξει με τους κρυφούς σας φόβους αλλά και με την επιθυμία σας να δοκιμάσετε τα όρια της αδρεναλίνης σας.
This is one AWESOME Goosebumps book!
It evokes all kinds of nostalgia vibes with the kids being on vacation and how they ended up on their own to have fun and ultimately survive all the Horrors at the theme park.
I was able to connect with the kids and share in their fears throughout the entire book and I loved that!
Bonus points for really surprising me in a book from 1994!
I loved this one and highly recommend any Goosebumps fans to read this one if you have not already.
It's some good, fun horror!
Re-read this for the Teenage Scream podcast (lovingly dissecting the best and worst of 90s teen horror).https://soundcloud.com/teenagescream
This is the first book of the Goosebumps series I read and first book by R.L Stine I read. I enjoyed it so much I went on to read the first 47 books in the Goosebumps series, and about 40 other books by R.L Stine.
Wow!!Such a wonderful children's horror book. It kind of creeped me out sometimes and I loved the story, the park and the attractions, but I do have to say that there were a few parts that didn't make sense for me.Weird, scary and haunting. A great book for children and adults.
Certainly not a book for youngsters to read before bed. Though I remember these books making my heart race as a kid and I can see how. Very well written and an easy read.Would like to know why it is showing up as # 16 on Goodreads when it is # 5 on Amazon???
Una vez allí, debido a un imprevisto, Lizzy, Luke y Clay se quedan solos y comienzan a probar las atracciones, pero pronto verán que no son tan inofensivas como creían.Ir descubriendo Horrorlandia es fascinante, hasta los nombres de las atracciones dan mala espina, y lo mejor es que no es fácil adivinar qué les sucederá a los personajes.
Si le dais una oportunidad, Horrorlandia no os decepcionará y puede que vosotros tampoco podáis escapar de sus instalaciones…La puntuación real sería un 4,5/5, pero no le doy el 5/5 por lo que mencioné anteriormente y porque pienso que el libro hubiera podido ser mejor con algunas páginas más.
Атракциони на ужасите(Цялото ревю е тук: https://knijenpetar.wordpress.com/201...)Измина почти година от прочита на поредната книжка от хитовата детска хорър поредица на Р.
Л. Стайн.
🙂 Все пак имам поглед към жанра и с удоволствие прибавям от време на време по някое ново впечатление.
Който не познава творчеството на Стайн, едва ли е наясно колко интересни и провокиращи въображението са неговите малки книжки.
Пък и всяка книга носи по нещо ново и обогатява.
Понякога е по-забавно, отколкото страшно, но това зависи какъв тип читател имаме насреща.
На чичко Петър му е забавно.
😄 Ето и историята…(Продължава в блога: https://knijenpetar.wordpress.com/201...)
Новата книга на Р. Л. Стайн от изд. „Хермес” идва тъкмо навреме за Деня на детето и е истинско удоволствие за детето в мен! „Един ден в Страхоландия” е едно от ранните заглавия на знаменитата поредица Goosebumps, превърнало се в истинска класика сред феновете. Забравете за захарни къщички насред гората! Всички знаем, че са обитавани от вещици. Какви страхотии обаче ви чакат в един чудат увеселителен парк, в който можете да влезете без билет?

2018: Vroeger heb ik deze serie verslonden. Vorig jaar gaf ik de reeks weg en heb er nog nooit zoveel spijt van gehad. Gelukkig kwam ik van Horrorland een voordelige Engelstalige epub tegen. Uiteraard meteen op mijn reader gezet.Ik heb weer geweldig genoten. De spanning wordt goed opgebouwd, de rides zijn fantastisch en gruwelijk en de climax is griezelig en grappig tegelijk. Heerlijk weer om dit te kunnen herlezen!
wacky goosebumps fun!
A family of four with two elders(dad mom) and two kids(Lizzy n Luke) and a Luke's friend clay want to go to amusement park but they get lost and end up visiting horror land (also amusement park) which is not their plan but after roaming here and they find this and which looks so attractive with all monster rides and monster dressed people.
clay gets terrified easily..Luke gets terrified for the moment and then he acts like nothing happened and rush to new ride..Even its a kiddy story its a good read.
In green and purple monster 'costumes.' Clay, Lizzy and Luke beg their parents to go to this Horrorland instead of the Zoo Gardens because it seems so much better.
For some reason, their parents are okay with the 3 kids going on the rides while they search for a phone een though the Horror at the ticket booth assured them there were no phones on site.After a couple of the rides, they start to feel like there mayu be something to the signs that are put up around the park.
It was funny in parts too.Update: I've seen the two episodes that were based off of this novella, and if I'd seen them before reading this book, I probably wouldn't have read this book.
Siempre me gustaron las historias de terror, y leí un montón de estos libros aunque no todos ni cronológicamente, claro.
Guardo un buen recuerdo de ellos y quiero homenajearlos como se merecen.El libro es entretenido.
Es de lectura muy ágil: lo leí en un día sin demasiado tiempo para poder leer; con eso digo todo.En mi corazón siempre habrá un hueco para R.L. Stine y su buena labor al hacerme descubrir la lectura cuando alzaba pocos palmos del suelo.
http://www.davidasantos.com/One of my favorite Goosebumps books.
I've been to many theme parks.
Disney World.
Six Flags.
I've been to Haunted Houses and even dated some monsters.
So, this book was right up my alley!
Anything that's haunted is fun.
This book starts to kick in with its horrorfest around chapter two.
Very fun and exciting book.
If only a park like that really did exist!
You have a family of four, one daughter and a son, with his friend who look for a theme park, get lost and come across Horrorland.
A much funner, scarier park in my opinion.
I am giving this one four stars because it was a little too creepy for me. My favorite ride was the house of mirrors because it was fun. The scariest ride was the deadly doom slide. I would not pick slide number 10 because it's the doom slide. If you choose it you will slide forever and if it stops you will slide to your doom. I would not go to Horror Land for a day! No Way!! I think I would recommend it to Haven, Haley, and Emoney. But not for Piper! And not for kids under 4.
Whilst trying to find Zoo Garden’s, Lizzy Morris and her family along with her brother’s friend Clay stumble across a sign for Horrorland. Hopelessly lost they decided to change their plans, as this other theme park can’t be too scary right?One of the memorable entries in the series, Stine has great fun with the various cliffhangers.Being set in a theme park gives him an endless amounts of possibilities for various horror tropes, this makes for a great entertaining read.
