He then decided to close that arc with this novel, although there are still two more books in the George Smiley series.
This was a truly memorable story and although I would love to write more, it would be impossible without spoilers.I thoroughly enjoyed everything about this novel and highly recommend this Trilogy to anyone who wants to refresh their acquaintance with George Smiley et al, or for those who are new to John Le Carré’s writing and not sure where to start.
What is so exhilarating and fulfilling about reading le Carré is the sense of genuine intelligence at play, both in the characters and in the author.
How to press them in exactly the right way, without scaring them off?In a sense this book is composed simply of a number of these intense, magesterially-written duologues stacked together, a stichomythic layer-cake: Smiley and Lacon, Smiley and Mikhel, Smiley and Esterhase, Smiley and Connie, Smiley and Grigoriev, Smiley and Alexandra…and always, at the end, the prospect of somehow reaching the the endgame conversation, between Smiley and Karla.
Visiting retired Circus personnel, from the senile research assistant who helped compile nearly all of the known data on Karla to the disgraced lamplighter Toby Esterhase, who can still muster more than a few surveillance teams if there's the chance for personal glory and a return to the game, Smiley pieces together the bits of story he needs in order to weave a trap of his own and conclusively win in the battle of wills that he and Karla have fought for nearly their whole lives.This is what le Carre excels at: the slow and methodical piecing together of events, some decades old, into a coherent conspiracy that has a very real effect on the present.
The conclusion of the trilogy that starts with Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy; but, while that book is about betrayal, this one is about manipulation. The heartbreaking message is that, when you want to manipulate someone, the most effective approach is not to try and exploit their weaknesses. Needless to say, that can work too. But the very best way is to exploit their kindness, their decency, and the things that make them a worthwhile human being. It's been done in many other books too, of course, though rarely as well as le Carré does it here.
My dad, sick of hearing me make fun of his spy novel proclivities, bet me $50 that I would love this book.
It was a safe bet, too.
I love the entire trilogy, in fact, but since I read this one first, out of order (tsk tsk dad) it has the special place on my favorites shelf.
And even though I now own THREE copies, this edition was my father's, which he then bequeathed to me after I raced through the entire Le Carre canon with incredible enthusiasm.
It's perhaps the most treasured book I own because it was his.
Smiley’s People is the last book in the “Karla Trilogy”; a series that describes the world of espionage during the Cold War. The story starts with a revelation by a ‘lost-agent’ recently resurfaced that at the very top of Circus (British secret service) there is a KGB agent, a mole spying for the Russians.
The third and the final book, pits Smiley and his arch-rival Karla against each other.
The story, unlike the first two books, kicks off from a very thrilling start and keeps the reader on edge.
Love, in Le Carré’s fiction proves to be, as Karla called it, “an illusion”.
The best of the best ... everything a spy novel could possibly be ... Smiley vs Karla ... a weakness, a mistake, a brilliantly orchestrated response ... and of course the bridge into West Berlin.Smiley's People is also a master class in writing ... when to expand, when to move quickly, setting a scene, using peripheral characters. I think I'll read it again. But for now, I will go into my class next week at Oxford - British Spies in Fact and Fiction - as prepared as I can be and ready to learn more.
Smiley comes out of retirement was his people come under attack in this aptly named conclusion to the Karla trilogy.This is fantastic stuff!
Taut tension, high stakes, personal vendettas...ah, it's all wonderful.
The characterizations and conversations are finessed with an admirable subtly.
The Cold War settings descriptions put you in the middle of these depressingly drab locations.
John le Carré is on fire in Smiley's People!It's far more cerebral cold war spy novel than say Fleming's stuff.
That's going to bore some readers.
It almost bored off this reader, but I held in there and, man, the payoff...

The last book of le Carre's Karla series might be the best.
In this chapter Smiley finally goes on offense against his nemisis, the Soviet spy master, Karla.
Little scenes, like kids bashing a car by a lake, suggest much more about the moral state of Modern Man. We are living on the edge of an abyss, le Carre seems to suggest, so much so that the one constant, Duty (nod to Conrad), can even betray us.
There are passages in Smiley's People that rival the best of Henry James, Joseph Conrad, and Graham Greene.
This is my absolute favorite le Carre novel--and in my view the best of the Karla Trilogy. All the cerebral incisiveness of Tinker, Taylor, married to a well-constructed, suspenseful, and active plot. A real crescendo of a novel.
The more literary directors, like Bergman I could probably talk about but it would be using the language of books to say what I like or how I think the film works.
The slow meticulous unfolding and the little details in both the shows mentioned and the Smiley novels might seem a little labored at points but their end payoff is greater than the 44 minute resolution of "CSI" or say a James Bond film.I wasn't sure where I was going with this review at the start, it was actually going to be a review for Crumley's The Last Good Kiss, but instead Smiley's People seemed a better move to come off of my ramblings about movies with.
From IDMb:Called out of retirement to settle the affairs of a friend, Smiley finds his old organization, the Circus, so overwhelmed by political considerations that it doesn't want to know what happened.
He begins to follow up the clues of his friends past days, discovering that the clues lead to a high person in the Russian Secret service, and a secret important enough to kill for.
Smiley continues to put together the pieces a step ahead or a step behind the Russian killers.A movie was made based on this book and it's available at YouTube, with Alec Guinness, Curd Jürgens, Eileen Atkins.Duration: 360 min.

Και -δεδομένου ότι δούλεψε κάποια χρόνια ως πράκτορας των βρετανικών μυστικών υπηρεσιών- έφτιαξε "αληθινούς" χαρακτήρες και οι περιγραφές που δίνει για την περίοδο του Ψυχρού Πολέμου (ποτέ δεν μου άρεσε αυτός ο όρος) είναι ρεαλιστικές.
Εδώ βλέπεις ανθρώπους που δεν ξέρουν για ποιον δουλεύουν πραγματικά και ανθρώπους που νιώθουν χαμένοι, παρά τη νίκη τους.
Δεν είχα ξαναδιαβάσει Carre και στο οπισθόφυλλο λέει ότι -παρά το γεγονός ότι αποτελεί το τελευταίο μέρος μιας τριλογίας- αποτελεί το πιο χαρακτηριστικό του βιβλίο που σε βάζει στον κόσμο του συγγραφέα.Έτσι είναι και σίγουρα θα διαβάσω μελλοντικά και άλλα βιβλία του.
By the time I reached the end of this book, I cared so deeply for the characters whom John LeCarre had created that I could not believe it was over. I immediately started reading it again. This is definitely a book not to be read out of sequence, because the deeper nuances of the characters will be lost without having read the earlier books. I thoroughly enjoyed this book, and highly recommend it.

In the spy genre, if James Bond is a boxing match, then George Smiley is a chess game.
Lots of planning ahead, knowing your opponent, and biding your time to make the right move.
Smiley and Karla match wits again, but George has a new advantage—Karla can no longer manipulate him via his wife.Fans of fist fights and gun battles may find this boring.
People like myself, who have spent many years researching and working within libraries and archives, will find ourselves mesmerized as Smiley reads files and interviews other ex-employees of the intelligence services in order to build the perfect mousetrap.
This is the ultimate book in a trilogy, and all the pieces come together, characters deepen, brief glimpses of characters and places make sense, and the hard work that you've done to get to this point because of le Carre's dense, dense writing finally pays off.This is great stuff.
The Smiley trilogy (Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy; The Honourable Schoolboy and this one) require so much work to get through and understand.
le Carre does almost all showing and no telling and because of this I spent about 2/3 of Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy just wondering what the heck was going on.
This is probably the most fulfilling of the Smiley stories. But it does follow the usual format.Something happens. Smiley is pulled out of retirement. He talks to his old contacts/colleagues. He reads a lot of files. There are lots of words as the story rolls slowly along. Then in the last 20 pages the denouement occurs where the final act is not known till the last page.
While other of his works exhibit the slight flaw (in the case of Tinker, Tailor it was more than slight) of an overly-complex plot, here le Carre keeps things just simple enough that the reader can keep up without too much difficulty.
The psychological torments of George Smiley are described in such bitter detail that my stomach churned, my mind fraught with the possibility that things could still go horribly wrong.It is truly an incredible book, and my only regret is that for the reader uninitiated with John le Carre's writing I would not recommend this as the starting point.
First, there's Smiley, his heavy-lidded contemplation of what makes people tick.
The lead-up to the big catch is perfectly done.
And then there's the tensely beautiful scene with Connie Sachs from whom Smiley gets the connection he needs to root out his old foe.There's something else in this era of Le Carre books - that kind of tatty dignified honour coming out of the war, contrasted with awful betrayal under a veneer of old boy.I read this book and Le Carre's others pretty much as they came out.
A stunning work, even better than the excellent Tinker, Tailor.
Smiley's intelligence is portraid in the cracks in between action.
The progress of his investigation is subtle; this isn't anything like a modern spy thriller.
No car chases, no galavanting around the world.Although this is a book that's ostensibly about the cold war, its themes still resonate.
How far is too far when it comes to pursuing enemies?
What really differentiates us?
I don't want to say too much, but I can't recommend this book highly enough.
My advice: read Tinker, Tailer and this, and skip The Honorable Schoolboy.
There is really nothing to add to all the reviews that have been written except to say that this is probably the best of the sequence...The last of the sequence of George Smiley tales in which Smiley acting alone achieves a sort of resolution by using Karla's methods against him. The way in which this tale unfolds is masterful. Le Carre has his total command of his characters and the interplay and unfolding of the plot is a joy to behold.
My favourite le Carre ever. I was completely engrossed as Smiley starts his investigation and with amazing doggedness, rigor and an ability to see the connections between between seemingly small anomolies brings him to his arch rival.Could not recommend more highly.
And it is going to have an effect – that effect is played out in Honourable School Boy. In this 3rd novel, we have a Circus taking a different tack – one that is controlled by politicians and bureaucrats; surprisingly (!) causing staff to wallow in procedure and policy and not actually any espionage.
I remember visits in the 70s to Britain and I remember all this relentless grey, even on the sunniest day.Most of the Deadly Sins come into play here, and are manipulated so that Smiley gets what he wants.
Was he manipulating Smiley to get what he wanted?
He's so in tune with human nature--the things that drive us and make us who we are--and it shines through in all his people, but most of all in Smiley, of course.If something stands out from this book, its the restraint that Le Carre shows.
To be honest, I couldn't decide which is better, though I enjoyed reading this much more than Tinker Tailor.To close, a favorite passage, from the last third of the book: Mendel, a loping, dourly observant man with a taste for keeping bees, said outright that George was pacing himself before his big fight.
On Karla has descended the curse of Smiley's compassion; on Smiley the curse of Karla's fanaticism.
I have destroyed him with the weapons I abhorred, and they are his.
We have crossed each other's frontiers, we are the no-men, of this no-man's land."A near perfect ending for one of the, if not THE, best trilogies ever.
Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy was a fantastic spy novel that owed lots to Greene; The Honourable Schoolboy was another fantastic spy novel that owed lots to Conrad; but with Smiley's people, you read it and realize John le Carré owes nobody nishto now.
So deliberate, slow, rich, disorienting, obscure--yet, somehow, through some strange magic, through the initial obscurantist density of detail and noise, the patient reader begins to pick up the thread, to see how the facts cohere: Le Carré seems to be able to recreate the slow, patient, methodical work of intelligence agents in the reader's experience of his books.
This, like Le Carré's other books, is no page turner that one can race through.
It's likely that many who pick up a Le Carré novel hoping for a quick, mindless distraction--a "spy novel"--become frustrated by the dense wall of information, detail, tradecraft.
I've read a couple hundred spy novels, and this is my all-time favorite.
Maybe it's because of the build up from the predecessors, "Tinker, Tailor" and, to a lesser extent, "The Honourable Schoolboy" but actually it's because le Carre is at the top of his game.
He masterfully introduces the bit players via other bit players one instrument at a time until the orchestra is roaring away.
Meanwhile, le Carre's command of detail unpaints every decrepit waterfront warehouse, loosens the planks on treacherous docks and leads us inexorably to a scene of death and redemption.
The espionage establishment as mundane, humorless British corporate bureaucracy. Endless, boring meetings, unreadable secret-stamped files locked in nameless reading rooms, and middle-management infighting.Chilling because it feels so real, so closely observed.Third in the trilogy with Tinker, Tailor and The Honourable Schoolboy. The latter is an interlude. You could skip from one to three, then come back to it. If you do, you'll appreciate it more.The BBC TV series captured it all wonderfully, and Sir Alec Guiness as George Smiley was never better.
