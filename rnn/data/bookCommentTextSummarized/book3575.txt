Fortunately there are some fairly fresh ideas in this one, including some good use of other Outlaw siblings in addition to Ethel and Robert.
Fantastic.
Was given this book as a child, this character is hard to hate.,
I think it was eatin’ those berries.’‘What berries?’ said the young man.‘Those berries Ginger gave her.’‘D – did Ginger give her some berries?’ stammered Hector aghast.‘Yes – all sorts of different coloured kinds of berries what he found about the garden.
And she ate them all.’The horror of the young man is indescribable.
.‘B-but,’ he stammered, ‘I – I heard in the village it was measles.’‘No,’ said William, ‘it’s worse than measles.
She died in the night.’‘What?’ screamed the young man.‘She’s dead,’ said William, somewhat flattered if a little surprised by the deep emotion shown by the visitor.
I am a fan of the William books and really enjoy the audio versions where the narrator captures the voices and tones of the characters.
Martin Jarvis is a superior narrator and I had a lot of fun listening to the CD.
What struck me most about the book was how much life has changed for children.
Also William for the most part has no malice about him, he has the best intentions and it just does not work out the way he intended, this in very different from the people today (children and adults).
So far this book is cute and funny. It is interesting to read a book from a different area in the world as characters come otu realyl differently based on cultural differences. I have been enjoying eilliams exploits so far..and loved it untill the end a very funny book remindin
