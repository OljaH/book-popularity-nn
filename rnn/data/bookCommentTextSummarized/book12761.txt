u already know this the queen of suspense the best of my time she started it all love this lady i salute u mrs mary higgins clark!
يارباهساعاود المراجعة فيما بعد مازلت في حالة ذهول
This is the second Mary Higgins Clark novel I read after a long hiatus of her novels, and I have to say my expectations for this novel were high.
And, because of this, whenever they came up in the novel it was like “Who cares?” I read this novel soon after reading Mary Higgins Clark’s While My Pretty One Sleeps; which is about fashion designers.
It has been awhile since I read Mary Higgins Clark novels, and I can’t remember if this is something she does in all her novels.
I gave this novel two starts becomes there were one or two characters that were semi-interesting.
Needed a quick easy read for the plane ride...we'll see if i regret my choice......Meh. It was an ok book I guess.
I really don't need to know, in detail, what each character is wearing in EVERY scene.
Oh and I really don't need to know EXACTLY what time every thing is starting.
Can't, after two billion books, can the author come up with a better section opener?The plot itself was interesting, and the whodunit became a little predictable.
I can't say I won't ever read a Mary Higgins Clark book again, but I certainly won't expect anything if I do.
Shall we dance?
Shall we dance?
Shall we dance?»[Balliamo?
Su una vivida nube di musica voliamo?
Balliamo?]L'assassino lo vediamo fin dalla prima pagina, ma chi è veramente?Tutti i personaggi, vittime e no, ruotano intorno al mondo degli annunci personali, quelli con i quali si ricercano amicizie, compagnia e non solo, se ci scappa.
Ambito molto rischioso, perché non si sa chi puoi trovarti davanti.
Tra le vittime un punto in comune: lo spettacolo, la musica, la danza, il ballo.
E quelle belle scarpette dal tacco a spillo...Romanzo che pian piano intriga, una pagina dopo l'altra.

I really love Clark's older books, which were suspenseful psychological thrillers.
I also like the fact that her murderers are always people with deep psychological disorders.
Her later books concentrated on normal people but that didn't work for me.In this book is a creepy serial killer, who meets women through personal ads kills them and puts dancing shoes on their feet before abandoning them where they could be found.
She meets a variety of people who quickly become suspects.
Clark's characterisation is always weak, but that doesn't matter so much in this book where the suspense is pretty high.
This is one of the creepier books that I have read.
After all that time It still was bugging me that I didn't know what was to happen.
So I picked it up, read it again.
It was a great plot and it had a satisfactoringly twisted murderer.
It had so much emotion packed into this murder mystery also.
I reccomend to just about anyone who still loves a night filled with jumping and looking outside your window for that burgular you just KNOW you heard.
Read it, love it, reccomend it.
If I could, I'd give this a zero.
I can't believe she sells.
This is the modern-day crap I speak of in my reviws .
ten fold.
Her plots broadcast, the're derived, boring, predictable, stupid, silly, staid .
Only read this because it was required for a Lit. class I was teaching at a college that, like a high school, required certian books.
I don't teach there any more.
One faculty member even refused to read the book.
Just had the students read it and report back to him, nodding his head in acknowledgement like he'd read it.
In Mary Higgins Clark's Loves Music, Loves to Dance, a serial killer trolls the personal ads in trendy magazines.
Erin Kelly was a promising jewelry designer and Darcy Scott was a decorator.
On a lark, Darcy persuaded a TV producer to do a scoop about research on people who did personal ads.
When Erin disappeared and later was found in killed with one missing shoe and wore one dancing shoe, it was up to Darcy to entire the killer out in the open with her own ad by communicating with him and making Darcy next on his list.
This one is a suspense thriller in the mold of most of what Mary Higgins Clark has written and was first published in 1991, making it one of the earlier of her suspense novels.The plot surrounds Darcy and Erin, a couple of 20-something ladies who decide to add more fun to their dating lives by answering personal ads from eligible men.
Numerous characters were thrown into the mix, with quite a few being various types of creeps for Darcy to date and for us readers to consider as potential serial killers.
3.5Verzählt werden die mörderischen Treffen zwischen mehreren jungen Frauen und einem vielversprechenden Unbekannten, die sich durch Zeitungsannoncen kennenlernen.
An sich war die Geschichte recht interessant und ebenfalls gut erzählt: Es war einfach dem Geschehen zu folgen.
Jedoch gibt es einige negative Aspekt; es waren recht viele Verdächtige, obwohl es ich den wahren Täter recht früh eingegrenzt hatte.
(view spoiler)[Zudem mochte ich das Ende nicht besonders: Wieso verpasst Higgins dem Mörder letztendlich eine sehr emotional verstörende Kindheit, und lässt ihn obendrein noch als geistig beschränkt erscheinen, obwohl er offensichtlich ein recht intelligenter Mann ist, der obendrein noch einen Medizinabschluss hat?(view spoiler)[ (hide spoiler)] (hide spoiler)]
Wow! what an awesome book. read the whole thing in a day and a half. This book is intense for beginning to ende. Just when you think you have it figured out, another character or angle comes into play. My heart was actually pounding in my chest at one point(ok, at a few points) Readers of this genre like to be kept on edge and Clark does not disappoint. Highly recommend to all suspense lovers. You will not be let down
الترجمة سيئة للغاية فعلى سبيل المثال بدلا من أستخدام لفظ قاتل متسلسل تستخدم لفظ قاتل بالجملةوهكذا إلى جانب الأخطاء فى وصف الشخصياتأما عن الحبكة فقد تميزت بالضعف بالإضافة إلى سهولة تخمين القاتللكن على الرغم من ذلك تمتلك الكاتبة أسلوب سلس يجبرك على متابعة القراءة
The thing about MHC is that her stuff is absolutely workable in a formulaic format; yes, you always suspect everyone because you know there is a deep love of red herrings in the writing.
But it works, and you don't really see the ending coming, and the characters are fun and semi-real and it's just a nice rainy day read about personal ad creepers that makes me wonder what MHC would do with newer creations like MySpace and eHarmony.
Darcy Scott e Erin Kellei decidem ajudar a amiga Nona, uma jornalista que está a elaborar um trabalho que consiste em analisar as experiências de quem publica ou responde a anúncios de jornais.Tudo parece correr bem, até que Erin aparece morta e Darcy não poem de parte que a morte dela esteja relacionada com os anúncios de jornal.Darcy parte assim em busca do assassino da amiga, respondendo a anúncios que já antes Erin tinha respondido, deparando-se assim com homens que de uma maneira ou de outra tentam esconder que conheceram Erin, levando a que Darcy fique com uma lista infindável de suspeitos.
روايتي الأولى للكاتبة، رواية بوليسية تدور أحداثها حول قاتل متسلسل يستهدف الفتيات في مدينة نيويورك، اسمه تشارلي أعجبتني جداً شخصيته ولو أني أخطأت في تخميني لشخصيته الحقيقية لكنه كان ذكي جداً وبسيط وأقرب شخص للتحقيق من غير أن يثير ريبة المحققين، إيرين ودارسي وآن، فيكس ودوغ وباركو ونونا وغيرهم من الشخصيات التي يزعجزك في أول الرواية تشعبها وعدم استيعاب علاقتهم بالقصة، لكن خلال تسلسل الأحداث وهو متعمد من الكاتبة لتصعيب عملية تخمين القاتل ومحاولتها إعطاء القارئ تفاصيل على قدر الحاجة حتى تتكسف الحقائق في النصف الثاني منها ، شكراً ماري على كمية السعادة التي انتابتني خلال تصفحي هذه الحبكة 7-9-2108
No es de los mejores libros de la autora. Las coincidencias existen pero tantas como aparecen en este libro me parece realmente excesivo.Otras de sus historias me han enganchado mucho más. Además, sospechaba quien era desde el principio así que no me he llevado ninguna sorpresa.
Not my favorite MHC novel but it's special because a dear friend gave me my copy haha
Su habitual esquema de abrir la novela con el crimen, luego identificar dentro la historia -- en un estilo bien engranado, no muy artificial -- a diferentes sospechosos, a cual más culpable, para que al final el culpable resulte ser aquel que genera la mayor sorpresa posible, hace que, justamente, la sorpresa se pierda.
Uno espera que no sea tan obviamente ¨sorpresivo¨, pero al final resulta que no, así no más había sido, se repite el esquema.Algo decepcionante.

Great read! This is the first book I read from this author. It was recommended by a fellow book club member I have to admit I really enjoyed his book. I will definitely read another book from this author.
Good murder mystery. I guessed the wrong man, but enjoyed.
A serial killer with a fetish for dancing slippers, and pretty young things, who love dancing. Moves fast. An enjoyable read.
Which would be a good thing if the fact every single one of those characters had to have at least one paragraph dedicated to them and/or their inner workings and/or their friends/family didn't make this story rather choppy.It felt all over the place and this jumping sideways from character to character made for a rather poor reading experience.
Especially in the last chapter, during the big finale, when the story kept jumping from the killer and victim to the rescue party and back.
The choppiness of narration diffused the suspense too much.The main protagonist, Darcy Scott, also left much to be desired, merely augmenting the problems of the story.
Loves Music, Loves to Dance  was a solid  3 to 3.5 star  novel by Mary Higgins Clark.The story follows Darcy Scott as she investigates the murder of her best friend Erin Kelley.
The pair had been helping a television producer friend with a story about personal ads and dating.
The 'suspects' as characters are not fully defined and distinct until nearly the end of the novel, and even then it's still murky (view spoiler)[ what was Doug's connection to Nan?
Was the Doctor the mystery man in the photo?
How was there no indication that the Doctor was a psychopath?
In this case, she sets up a couple of straw men for her serial killer, carefully dropping clanging hints suggesting one or the other in the final sentence of each cliff-hanger chapter.
The title's phrasing nicely suggests the personal ads which are also a part of the plot; though if she were writing this novel today, no doubt Higgins Clark would have had her characters write and answer them on the internet rather than through newspapers and the mail.A quick, enjoyable read that whiled away a couple of long commutes.
