There were moments where I just closed my eyes and sat there sobbing, letting the emotions sink in.I read Losing Hope as slowly as I could because I just didn't want it to ever end.
And I loved that there were new twists too - things that were going on with just him personally that took me by surprise in the most wonderful way.While so much of this book is just completely new, even the scenes that are the same as in Hopeless feel SO special when you read them because a) they are just awesome scenes to relive period, and b) the slightly different angle on them gives them just enough of a twist to make you fall in love with them all over again.Colleen Hoover's talent for writing vivid and effortlessly beautiful stories is astounding.
No one writes male P.O.V's like Colleen Hoover. No one. Losing Hope was utterly heartbreaking, compelling, and beautiful. And...I somehow managed to fall even harder for Holder than I already had in Hopeless.Stunning.Stunning.Stunning.

5+ Blew me away stars! Just when I thought it couldn’t get any better than Hopeless, Colleen Hoover proves me wrong! I loved that Losing Hope wasn’t just Hopeless from Holder’s pov... it was so much more. Dean Holder is just perfection. You get his story from before Hopeless, and during, and those letters. Those letters destroyed me in the very best way. This book was just amazing. Every book I read by this author gets better and better. I don’t know how she does it, I’m just glad that she does!
I loved that Losing Hope wasn’t just Hopeless from Holder’s pov...
Every book I read by this author gets better and better.
If you’ve read Hopeless, then you already know the bulk of the story.
Les and his childhood best friend, Hope were the only two girls he’s ever loved.
I don’t want her to feel nothing when I kiss her.
She’s got to stop doing and saying these things that make me want to fast forward whatever’s going on between us.I’m not falling in love with her piece by piece anymore.
I’m falling for the whole girl.
♥ 5 BRILLIANT, EMOTIONAL, HEARTBREAKING, BEAUTIFUL STARS. ♥Colleen Hoover has done it again!Colleen Hoover can do no wrong in my book. I've read and loved each and every single one of her books and they were all brilliant, and Losing Hope was no exception. Hopeless was one of my favorite books of 2012 and reading the story again from Holder's POV made me exactly remember why. ***Review contains spoilers for those who haven't read Hopeless yet***In  Hopeless  Sky told her side of the story, but
Hopeless was one of my favorite books of 2012 and reading the story again from Holder's POV made me exactly remember why.
The more time they spend together, the more Holder starts to fall in love with the girl Sky is now and the more he wishes that she wouldn't be Hope so that their present won't be affected by the events that happened in the past.
What follows is an emotional journey in which Holder has to decide whether Sky should know the truth about what happend all those years ago or if she's better off without those memories of the past.
**Warning: Spoilers for those who haven't read the first one**Absolutely breathtaking.A story about love.Loss.Pain.And forgiveness.
Just when I thought it couldn’t get better, Colleen Hoover comes and just knocks it out of the park!Dean HolderLinden Sky DavisHolder still hasn’t forgiven himself from walking away from Hope thirteen years ago.
And gets to know her.And falls in love with her.There are two sides to every story.And this is Holder’s.
You know I would do whatever I could to take away your pain, right?She nods, never pulling her gaze from mine, even for a second.“I need that from you so fucking bad right now, Sky. I need to know you love me like that.” 
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!! LOVE LOVE LOVE the cover!!!! HELLLLLLLLOOOOOOOOO HOLDER!!!!!!!! *SWOON* CAN'T. FUCKING. WAIT.!!!COVER REVEAL ON SUNDAY PEOPLE!!!!!! OMG, I'M BEYOND CRAZY EXCITED!!!!!!! HOLDER HOLDER HOLDER HOLDER HOLDER HOLDER!!!!!! AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!So....HOPELESS IN HOLDER'S POV??? Is this like not the greatest year EVER????I. CAN'T. WAIT.!!!!
”I love you, Holder. So much,” she says firmly. “And just so you know…so did Hope.” This story had me thinking from the first chapter what a fan-freaking-tastic read Hopeless would have be if it would have been written in alternating povs! Seriously, I really enjoyed Hopeless but with the knowledge of Dean Holder’s past, inner most thoughts, his sister Leslie and that ending, the completed story was…perfection. If you had read my review for Hopeless http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/... then
Seriously, I really enjoyed Hopeless but with the knowledge of Dean Holder’s past, inner most thoughts, his sister Leslie and that ending, the completed story was…perfection.
That being said, this is definitely worth the read and I have no regrets.Dean Holder’s pov added several intricate and relevant scenes to story and I can’t think of anything that she could have done more with this book.
Even though there are scenes that were the same in this book and the outcome is the same there are additions to even the ending that complete the overall picture.Dean’s losses, his frustrations, his grief, his struggle with wanting her to be Hope as well as the fear that she could be Hope…
Tonight I fell in love with Sky.”  Losing Hope was a book I told myself at the beginning of 2015 that I would read this year.
Because it had been almost 2 years since reading the first book, reading from Holder's point of view was a fresh perspective and didn't feel like a reread of a book I already read.
I also got to see Hope/Sky through new eyes and view Holder's struggles with his decisions.
In a way I am sad and glad I waited so long to read this book.

I must warn you, there will be A LOT of hand holding pictures, I just COULD.NOT.HELP.MYSELF!!!What can I say… I absolutely loved Hopeless  and is probably if not my favorite read of all time.Damn Colleen Hoover, YOU.CAN.WRITE Losing Hope is Hopeless from Holder’s POV. Remember the part where Sky and Holder didn’t talk to each other for one month, oh.my.gah…. it was killing me… I wanted to know what Holder was doing, what he was up to,
I must warn you, there will be A LOT of hand holding pictures, I just COULD.NOT.HELP.MYSELF!!!What can I say… I absolutely loved Hopeless  and is probably if not my favorite read of all time.Damn Colleen Hoover, YOU.CAN.WRITE
If you kind of liked Holder from Hopeless then you basically want to pin him to the bed and face rape him when you finish Losing Hope
I LOVED HOLDER from Hopeless, but by GOD having Holder’s POV is like drinking a glass of wine… no matter how much you consume… you just want more and get drunk on it
**If you haven't read book 1, please, stop reading right now. I don't wanna spoil this amazing story for you :) ** **ARC courtesy of Atria Books via NetGalley in exchange for an honest review**I'll be lying if I said this book wasn't the one I was most looking forward to reading this year. It was. And I'm so grateful I got to read this ARC before it was released because I'm sure the wait would have been absolute torture. My expectations were high, and well, this is Colleen Hoover we are talking
I've loved Hopeless since I read it back in January.
Those of you who have read Hopeless you pretty much know what the story is about and well, why read this book then if all the mistery has been revealed?
And being able to get to know what's in Holder's head in those moments, believe me, it's PRICELESS.It's painful to read all that guilt and pain from Holder's POV, but it's also so powerful how little by little he starts to heal, the incredible way he expresses his feelings by writing to his sister.
So READ it and LOVE it.
OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGThank you Colleen Hoover for writing this amazing novel in Holder’s POV. You are an amazing author and I loved every minute of it! Thank you thank you thank you!
DNF at 25%• First book: Hopeless ★★★☆☆I can't go any further through this book! *lost interest* It's the same as "Hopeless" but from Holder's POV this time.So, I see there's no point in completing a book I already know what happens in it.
♥♥♥ 5 beautiful, Hope-filled stars!!♥♥♥Well, it's official. CoHo has done it again with Losing Hope. Now, I know most you are probably sick of this alternate POV trend as I was. I mean, why not write a book with dual POV in the first place. Anyway, CoHo has written something very insightful about why she wrote Losing Hope on her blog, which you can find here.Now onto our review... In a nutshell, Losing Hope is more than just a retelling of Hopeless. Yes, we know what happened already so why shou
I mean, why not write a book with dual POV in the first place.
In a nutshell, Losing Hope is more than just a retelling of Hopeless.
We also get to know the enigma that is Dean Holder.It's been a long time since I've read Hopeless and I have actually forgotten how swoony Holder can be.
And although we pretty much knew what happened to Les, as it was already revealed in Hopeless, reading it again from Holder's POV was just gut-wrenching.Plus of course, we really get to see how Holder felt about Sky from the moment he saw her and his developing feelings towards her.
“I wonder if it's possible for people to fall in love with a person one characteristic at a time, or if you fall for the entire person at once.” Okay, I will not explain the story behind this book because it’s the exactly same one than the first one.
If you haven’t read it yet, I advise you to do it faster.I will only say that this was already an amazing story under Sky’s POV and it was even a greater one under Holder’s.
Usually, when I read books under the hero’s POV the girl annoys the hell out of me.
Just got this from NetGalley!! EEEEK!More Holder?! Holder's POV?
Yes, you are reading a story you already know, but in Losing Hope Colleen Hoover gives us additional pieces we didn't get before.
But when it comes to Colleen Hoover, will I ever?The reason I didn't rate this as high as Hopeless is actually more about my emotions and less about the writing.
We get extra story, extra characters, and things we didn't know before.
If you don't want that, then don't read it...but Colleen Hoover wrote this book for us, her readers.
For every fan that wanted more Holder, for every fan that wanted to experience the story from his point of view.
Have to add it I give up!
We on for tonight?” Daniel says, walking up to my locker.The last thing I feel like doing tonight is going out.
Fearing I’m about to get sucker punched from behind, I spin around.It’s not Grayson.Breckin is facing me and he doesn’t look very pleased about it.“Hey,” I say.“I need to talk to you,” he says.
But that doesn’t stop Breckin from moving in even closer to get right in my face.“I don’t really give a shit what kind of mood you’re in, because I’m in a pretty shitty mood myself, Holder.
Her baking and his cooking, their reading books and "chapter breaks", holding pinkies and looking at the sky when you're sad....there is just so many romantic things!
I liked that Holder knew right away how special Breckin was to Sky. There are a few new insights to things that happened that added to the story.
In fact, I’ll probably be thinking about the way her eyes scrolled down my body for the rest of the damn day."♥ "My attention is constantly homed in on her like I’m a compass and she’s my North."♥ “I can’t believe you think I’m hot,” I say, breaking the silence.
:P ;))We even get a blurb!!In Hopeless, Sky left no secret unearthed, no feeling unshared, and no memory forgotten, but Holder’s past remained a mystery.Still haunted by the little girl he let walk away, Holder has spent his entire life searching for her in an attempt to finally rid himself of the crushing guilt he has felt for years.
In Losing Hope, bestselling author Colleen Hoover reveals what was going on inside Holder’s head during all those hopeless moments—and whether he can gain the peace he desperately needs.Am I seeing this right????

Just simply,READ IT,FEEL IT,EXPERIENCE IT,LOVE IT,and never forget it.5 STARS *****
Whaaaaa??? Im so excited!!! Eeeeeeee
I love her stories, characters and have the utmost respect for this author’s work and seriously, if she doesn’t write a crappy book soon I’m going to run out of superlatives to describe her books in my reviews.Now, if I thought my expectations couldn’t be surpassed with Slammed, Point of Retreat, This Girl and Hopeless….well, I was completely wrong because in Losing Hope this author once again astounded me with her brilliance and Losing Hope did indeed exceed my expectations.
The complete opposite in fact.Because of the way Losing Hope is crafted, the story feels new, fresh and very different and for that reason I urge you to please read Hopeless before embarking on your experience of Losing Hope.
July. 2013.Yeah. July. That's cool.
But the thing needed to carry such stories is that you need a strong characters to carry the weight of the full narrative and you need to have variance in the story enough to where you're not blindly rehashing events without good reason.To give Hoover credit compared to McGuire's narrative, at least there was an attempt to develop Holder's character in this work, particularly with respect to the loss of his sister, the loss of his childhood best friend (Hope), and trying to fit himself back to sorts after his behavior lends to rumors that run every which way but loose.
I'm not going to rehash the whole story because chances are if you're reading this, then you've already read Hopeless and know Holder's and Sky's story.
I often get emotional in books but this book wrecked me in the best way.
I don't want to write anymore than this- because I want whoever reads this review to experience Holder's point of view for the first time.
There are not enough stars in the sky to rate this book.
There are not enough ways to express how much I loved it.
It's simply beautiful.**ARC provided by Atria Books via Netgalley in exchange for an honest review**
Seriously, I fell in love with him even more.~If I could pre-order a girl, I wouldn't even come close to the version standing in front of me right now.-Loc 949I always have trouble writing my reviews for Hoover's books, because I can't ever convey how emotionally impacting these books are for me.
Good thing I'm patient.-Loc 1905Dean Holder is one of the most complex characters I've read.
This book was beautiful, tragic, heartbreaking, and made me feel a wide range of emotions.
***5 Soul Crushing Stars***Losing Hope is Dean Holder's POV of the story Hopeless.
Learning about Holder and his family and friends added a wonderful dimension to this story.Grief over his sister's suicide crushes Holder's soul.To cope he writes her letters in a notebook he found in her bedroom.
Those letters give us more insight into the dynamics of their relationship and Sky's relationship with Holder.I was positive that Ms. Hoover would NOT make me cry in this book like she did in Hopeless.
When I read Lesslie's letter to her brother I started crying.
Each book is one character's POV of the same story.Novellas:
Well it wasn't the worst thing I read but it was not the best. I am not a fan of the "same book, different person perspective" ordeal. This just didn't feel necessary but okay
