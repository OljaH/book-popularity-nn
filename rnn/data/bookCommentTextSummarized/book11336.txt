"To have patience with stupidity is difficult for the quick-witted."Some are great, some less; as it almost always happens with short-stories, after all. Personally, I have a prediliction for Wasps' Nest, while The Third Floor Flat was probably the most unsatisfactory of them all -how could he think he would never be implied in that homicide? TSTL criminals are so not my type.Poirot, on the other hand, is as adorable and brainy as ever. It would be only silly of me to deny that he is the love of my life.
Another 4 star review for Agatha and Hercule (I feel I know them both well enough to be so informal ) although that said, it did only scrape into the 4 star category.
Now maybe that was a bit harsh as there were a couple of truly excellent short stories wonderfully demonstrating Poirot’s undoubted genius, Hastings’ undoubted loyalty (hah you thought I was going to be rude about poor old Hastings ) and of course with the first sight of Miss Lemon, her wonderful efficiency.
Let’s be honest who would not want a sight of Miss Lemon’s filing system.

Collection of 18 stories that feature Hercule Poirot, it has been chronicled by his faithful friend Hastings. These cases solved in the initial years, went on to establish Poirot's solid reputation as a formidable detective. One of the cases reveal how Poirot came to own the only shares he ever invested in-those of a mine in Burma. The collection also includes one of the two cases that he helped solve for the British government
Kao sto naslov kaze, kolekcija kratkih prica koja se bavi slucajevima dok M. Poari nije postao sve poznato ime (pa sem zadnje :P )Iskreno receno dok su slucajevi interesantni kratak format im ne daje da se bas mesta da se razmasu tako da sve bude gotovo pre nego sto se i zgreje stolica dok citas. Ali sitni detalji kako M. Poaro reaguje na sve je ono sto me uvek razgali i bude simpa da se cita dalje.Sem toga nemam sta puno reci, ko voli Poaroa nema sta da izgubi citajuci ovo.
Dari sejak SD, saya merasa tergelitik dengan pertanyaan, "Mana yang lebih hebat, Sherlock Holmes atau Hercule Poirot?
Doyle atau Christie?".Ok, kalo yang dibandingkan adalah segi kepopuleran dan pengaruh, maka Holmes sama sekali tak tertandingi.
Bahkan yang bikin tambah keki adalah pelaku pembunuhan dan motifnya sama percis!Cerita lainnya di novel ini yang berjudul Double Sin dengan jelas terlihat bahwa setting ceritanya mengingatkan kita pada novel Agatha yang lain yang berjudul Nemesis (meski pada 'Nemesis' tokoh utamanya adalah Miss Marple).
Dan cerita lain-lainnya yang jelas mirip dengan novel2 Agatha lainnya.
Ok, saya tidak menuduh Agatha meniru, cuma beberapa cerita dalam buku ini, bisa dikatakan Holmes banget!.
Plot cerita novel ini mirip banget dengan cerita Sherlock Holmes (Holmes kan muncul lebih dulu daripada Poirot).
خوبی مجموعه داستان اینه که هر وقت حوصله اش رو داشتی میتونی یه داستان رو بخونی ولی بدی ای هم که داره اینه که هرچه داستان ها کوتاه تر میشن کیفیت و هیجان اونها پایین میاد نسخه اصلی کتاب شامل 17 داستانه که متاسفانه دو داستان از اون ترجمه نشده اندWasps' Nest و Double Sin: که عبارت اند از
It was fun to read these short stories. Some of them were quite interesting and some were just fine and others were just very predictable. I have rated all the stories individually but as a whole this book deserves 3.5 stars in my opinion.
And this ends a long overdue Agatha Christie reading binge. Every one of these short stories presented such a delightful puzzle, I will always enjoy re reading and enjoying them. Poirot and Hastings, and of course AC, never disappoint :)
I mostly listened to this to see how I like David Suchet and Hugh Fraser as narrators and it turns out, I LOVE them.
And then there's poor Hastings Hugh Fraser.
Just like on the show, he seems to be there to highlight Poirot's gifts (which just made listening to this all the more delightful): he's a great narrator, and he tries to do voices and accents, but when you listen to a story read by Suchet right after one of his, you kind of feel sorry for him.
Kalau mau kenalan awal sama Poirot, buku kumcer ini bisa jadi pilihan yang tepat.
Walau di sini, dengan keberadaan Hasting (yang mengingatkan saya pada Watson) agak terasa kemiripan dengan Sherlock Holmes.
Beberapa kasus dalam buku ini juga mengingatkan saya pada beberapa kasus Sherlock, seperti misalnya yang Rancangan Kapal Selam sama Pemerasan dengan Surat Lady siapa itu, tapi tentu saja dengan ending mengejutkan khas Agatha Christie.
Poirot di sini--seperti kata Mbak Ajjah--seperti bentuk 'pemberontakan Agatha' terhadap dominasi Holmes pada paruh pertama abad kedua puluh.
Wakakakakak mantep Opa Poirot, meskipun Holmes tetaplah yang pertama bagi saya.
Agatha renditi conto che nei racconti (perlomeno in questi) facevi abbastanza pena.Ma questo non cambia nulla fra noi, ok?Con affetto,Emanuele
This collection of short stories are all-together amusing. But they lack the character development and the intricate unfolding of each case that I usually find in Christie's novels. But, still, if you're a fan of hers, it's a definite must-read.
Mostly hits, a couple of misses, many classic Christie stories with the little grey cells on full display.
Time spent with Hercule Poirot is always time well spent.
I have seen many of these done with David Suchet & it is interesting to contrast the short story with the way the tv portrays it.
Hastings is much more a comic foil on tv, and some of the stories become farcical in the hands of the television writers.
It is good to go back to the originals and readjust my reading taste buds.
Highly recommended for a day by the fire with tea, or a tisane.
A really nice collection of short stories. Some stories are almost identical to other short stories (The submarine Plans = The Incredible Theft and The Market Basing Mystery = Murder in the Mews) and at least one - The Plymouth Express - is a short version of the Poirot full-length novel The Mystery of the Blue Train. But every story is enjoyable, with Poirot at his best.
This was an okay selection of early short stories of Poirot. Only unfortunate thing is that they were all televised and I saw them all innumerable times. But, I do have to say, that in each case the stories did differ from the televised versions. Thank goodness.
zbirka kratkih priča s početka karijere najpoznatijeg Belgijanca. Nije vrhunsko djelo, ali otkriva neke zanimljive detalje iz života malog detektiva. Za ljubitelje AC obavezno štivo.
There are 17 stories in this collection, so I'll just mention the ones that stand out for some reason.The Affair at the Victory Ball - I've never cared for this confusing story of costumes and drugs smuggling.
The Veiled Lady - Another good TV episode, which may be better than the story.Problem at Sea - The TV version is one of my favorites, and this story is quite good, too.
This is an entertaining collection of eighteen well written short stories featuring Hercule Poirot.
If you haven't read any of Agatha Christie's Poirot stories, then this collection would be a good place to start.
I felt that Poirot came over as less arrogant and sure of himself than he is in some of the books and he even tells Hastings about one case where he felt he failed.The stories are narrated by Poirot's friend, Hastings and cover a variety of crimes including murder, kidnapping and theft.
I particularly enjoyed 'The Adventure of the Clapham Cook - in which Poirot is reluctant to take on the case at first because he doesn't search for missing domestic servants.
" Poirot had a good opinion of Japp's abilities, though deploring his lamentable lack of method, but I, for my part, considered that the detective's highest talent lay in the gentle art of seeking favours under the guise of conferring them !
"  ---- musings of Captain Hastings in 'the affair at the victory ball' Well that sums it up nicely, doesn't it ?
With the neat little revelation that it is Captain Hastings actually who detests Japp more than Poirot, apparently.And by the way, 'Poirot's early cases' was a reasonably satisfying read.

Un volum ce cuprinde povestiri scurte care îl au ca personaj principal pe atat de cunoscutul detectiv Hercule Poirot. Un Hercule Poirot tânăr, energic, în plină glorie care se străduie să demosntreze cu fiecare caz mai complicat cât de bine îi funcționează micuțele celule cenușii. Volumul Agathei Cristhie cu titlul " Primele cazuri ale lui Poirot" a apărut la editura Litera în seria " Hercule Poirot" în anul 2015 când s-au împlinit 125 de ani de la nașterea autoarei.
I am a huge fan of Agatha Christie. Each story is unique yet familiar, the main characters are developed, idiosyncratic, flawed but appealing. I particularly like these short stories as all my mundane chores can be broken up with a cuppa and a tale. I really enjoy the escapism but feel that I am also being educated as the vocabulary is sublime. Looking forward to my next dose of Poirot already.
Me ha gustado mucho este compendio de relatos sobre los primeros casos del detective más famoso de la historia de la literatura (después de Sherlock Holmes). Todos en general son buenos, aunque algunos destacan por el final inesperado y los giros argumentales que tanto le gustaban a su autora.Sobra decir que yo, con Agatha Christie, soy incapaz de ser imparcial.
Absolutely brilliant collection of Hercule Poirot stories. Recommend the audio version.This is my Poirot!:-
Poirot short stories. The ones used for the early ITV David Suchet series.Very, very reminiscent of Conan Doyle. For Holmes and Watson, read Poirot and Capt.Hastings.Good, solid plotting and manipulation of rather stock characters, but enjoyable fun and puzzles.
Surprising as Agatha Christie can be in her books. It's worth reading. This book is a collection of short stories. Hope to read more of Monsieur Hercule Poirot!
Read it due to my fondness for the movie of The Murder on the Orient Express.
