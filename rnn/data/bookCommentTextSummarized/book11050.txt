Harry Fletcher makes James Bond look like an aneomic schoolboy.......Actually a really good adventure yarn, but remember, this was written in the 70's when the leading men were chauvinistic and the women easy, so be warned.
The setting is St Mary's Island, in the Indian Ocean, and there's none of the game hunting or African history that provides the background of the author's other books.The story is action-focused and one of those ones in which everyone other than the hero and his companions seems to be a bad guy.
Harry Fletcher, the protagonist, is a chap who makes his living by taking tourists out to hunt various sea creatures, but of course soon events take a darker turn as he gets caught up with some very murky clients.The novel reminded me of Bernward Cornwell's seafaring thrillers and this one's even better.
Read By: Andrew Timothy Duration: 12:58Description: Harry Fletcher, a man with a chequered past, has reformed and is making an honest living as a charter skipper fishing for big game in the seductive waters of the Indian Ocean.
Suddenly, men from the world of violence Harry has put behind him overturn his good intentions, involving him in a hectic race to recover a fabulous treasure from an ancient wreck.
St. Mary's Island, Indian Ocean.
According to folk legend, in the year 1498, Vasco da Gama landed at St. Mary's Islands on his voyage from Portugal to India.Best line: Harry was never one to run for cover when the knickers were off.
He gets drawn into a treasure hunt, looking for buried gold, and in doing so, crosses paths with some of his old criminal cronies, who aren't entirely happy to see him again.That's pretty much the story, and as far as it goes, it's pretty good.
If you look at it as a story of its time, fine, but over time, as even Friends fans are finding out, attitudes change, and even if you don't mean for things to be offensive, sometimes it gets that way all by itself.
Enough said.When I first read Wilbur Smith's books, I thought the man could do no wrong.
Another excellent read my Wilbur Smith.
Not Smith's normal genre, which is usually historical fiction set in Africa or Egypt, this tale is instead a seafaring treasure hunt packed with plenty of danger, mystique, and an unusual touch of romantic interest.For someone that loves the ocean and all its vagaries, as I do, this book took me to places I've never explored, and introduced me to another fascinating tropical realm.As always with Wilbur Smith, this work does contain some graphically descriptive passages depicting human suffering, but those events only add to the story that he weaves.Highly recommended for Smith followers.
This is an older book by Smith that I picked up from the Open Doors Thrift Store in Mobile, Alabama, and am surely happy that I did. Tlhis is a sold mystery and a very enjoyable one. The characters are interesting and the plot has enough twists and turns for anybody. Enjoyed it.J. Robert Ewbank author "John Wesley, Natural Man, and the Isms" "Wesley's Wars" and "To Whom It May Concern"
This is a very entertaining adventure novel.
In the sixties and seventies treasure hunting stories were popular and one can hardly blame Mr. Smith from contributing to the genre.
As always this book is set in Africa (he always sets in novels in Africa) though this time the islands off of southeast Africa and not on the mainland.
It's all very professionally done, a real page turner.
This novel was written in the early seventies.
Woman ,even capable ones, are portrayed as being very willing to drop their panties when they are with Harry.
If you can accept that then enjoy what it a pretty good adventure novel.
Good read even if a little predictable with the end
Another great Wilbur Smith adventure novel. The only detraction for me was the over done heroism of Harry Fletcher, James Bond has got nothing on him!
Chatoyancy occurs when light reflects from minute, parallel ridges, fibers, or tubes within a transparent material.Great Mogul Diamond is believed to have been discovered around 1650 most probably around Kollur Mine in the Golconda region of southern India.
An Indian mogul cut rumored to have served as the eye of a Hindu statue, and currently is part of the Kremlin diamond fund, weighing approximately 190 carats (38 g).The rough diamond was gifted by Emir Jemla to Shah Jahan, The Emperor Of India as part of diplomacy between the two families.Jemla described it as “that celebrated diamond which has been generally deemed unparalleled in size and beauty.”A Venetian lapidary named Ortensio Borgio was assigned to cut the stone.
Um típico livro / filme americano de acção, com alguma emoção à mistura...passa-se junto à nossa antiga colónia de Moçambique, mas infelizmente é aspecto pouco explorado...
Before she showed up, it was all about Harry Fletcher, a good man with a Chequered Past, now running chartered fishing trips from St Mary's island (somewhere in the Indian ocean), which is Paradise on Earth.
Also, hold grave fears for the safety of anyone who is not Harry Fletcher.NB I read this book because of a chance encounter with a group of young men on a train, youths who seemed perhaps a bit rough, but one of them was holding a coverless, battered copy of a book called "The Eye of the Tiger".
A friend recommended this author to me - said she loved his series books and the families that he writes about.
(My friend also recommended one of the earlier books.) I enjoyed it.
I LOVE reading!) and was engaged through to the end - well then, I'll stick with 4 stars.Sure, Harry Fletcher is a bit over-the-top-perfect in a lot of ways.
And next time I'm at the library, I'll find another book by Mr. Smith to see if I like it as well.
Another page turner by the man who is one if not my favorite authors . He keeps you guessing right up to the last page.This book quickly grabbed me and led me down the path of several late nights reading when I should have been sleeping. He writes about contemporary Africa as well as the wild country of previous centuries. The plots he creates keeps me wondering what could possibly happen next but he doesn't disappoint . New readers of this author will swiftly join the food of his avid readers.
Very entertaining! Wilbur Smith never disappoints.
Wilbur Smith is a talented and established author.
There is good character development before the actual undersea discovery part of the book takes place.
There is a nice fight with the bad guys, but not a long drawn out shoot em' up, over the top militaristic scene like some novels.Harry and his shipmates stumble into the discovery of a wreck with hidden treasure, with the help of Sherry North.
The ending had a twist I did not see coming!Smith has a regional British style, which is reflected in the text and makes an interesting read.
Fantastic bookWilber Smith at his very best!!Crisp narrative,great characters,fabulous story line and superb surprise ending.What else could you expect. Ray Alderson
Typical Wilbur Smith engrossing bookHe switched from historical Africa to sea based story byut just as spellbinding. Am still a staunch Wilbur Smith fan can’t wait to read his next.
I've never read anything by this author and honestly can't even remember where I got this!!! Other than some of the sometimes subtle sexism in the main character more acceptable in the mid-70s than today, this was a really fun read!! I love his secondary characters and the plot twist in the conclusion was fantastic. Who can't love a handsome and roguish boat captain living on a beautiful island, even with his faults!! If I run across more, I will definitely pick them up!
hmm the book was ok ,it was a good and fast read and unlike other Wilbur smith books this was lacking in depth.The book does a fair job in explaining how to fish for marlins :) and a fight with a grouper .I would have like the final scene to be more dramatic and the main character being a SAS type there could have been more action .Sam
A fun though cheesy read. Classic thriller where the lead protagonist is an old dog with lots of tricks and all the girls. Despite all that I liked it. I'm sucker for deep sea diving and hidden treasure.
Old is Gold - a treasure hunt never bores and this one for all the scuba divers out there.
Don't waste time jf buy it. Always the same genius of strong story incredibly authentic people and mesmeŕising action with cliff hanging climax on the last magnificent page
Awesome action packed read! Great story, great characters - will leave you wanting more.
great entertaining from a master story teller.
A fantastic action filled read 👍
One of the first Wilbur Smith novels that I read back in the 80's. Great adventure tale!
Picked this up cheap whilst on holiday, struggled to finish it. River God is one of my all time favourite reads, so I expected more.
I listened to this on my personal stereo going round my paper round and loved it.
