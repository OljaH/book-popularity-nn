Illich questions the basic assumption that most liberal (or for that matter non-liberal) people in the US have: more educational = more gooder.
Attacking the idea that compulsory schooling is constructive, Illich offers one of the more radical analyses of the educational system I've ever heard of of, much less read.
You might not swallow Deschooling wholesale, but Illich shines the light on so many of the unspoken (I know I'm mixing metaphors here) axioms of the educational system---always a healthy endeavor---and challenges us to either defend or discard.
This book is a lens that will help you re-evaluate the school system, by urging you to undo what you've been "taught", and explore what you want to "learn".تلخيص سطرين المصوّر للكتاب (بالعربي) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj3z5...
As a person who has become highly critical of public schooling, I was already familiar with where he was going, but to abandon every type of institutional school system including free/democratic schools as well as universities seemed a bit much to me, until he went into detail about the repressiveness of such institutions and how we learn mostly everything we know outside of schooling.
He suggests an alternative type of schooling which uses social networking to pair up people with similar interests to form apprenticeship style mentoring.
It feels like he is talking about something similar to facebook as a way of bringing people with similar interests together to build learning atmospheres.
Interesting read.
This reminded me that both myself and a high school teacher friend feel like we need to justify any original teaching approaches we use (I always tried to slip in some critique of free market economics, for example) by also ensuring our students get good exam results.
At several points, Illich attempts to describe systems that would enable independent, self-directed, peer-to-peer learning and comes up with essentially a pre-digital internet:’The most radical alternative to school would be a network or service which gave each man the same opportunity to share his current concern with others motivated by the same concern.’‘What are needed are new networks, readily available to the public and designed to spread equal opportunity for learning and teaching… The money now tied up in TV installations throughout Latin America could have provided every fifth adult with a tape recorder.
Morticians formed a profession, a dominant and disabling one, when they acquired the muscle to have the police stop your burial if you are not embalmed and boxed by them." It was also in Puerto Rico that Illich came into contact with the first of the great secular bureaucracies whose pretensions he would make a career of puncturing, the school system.
In Puerto Rico, at the time Illich began studying the question in the late 1950s, children we' already required by law to have more schooling than the the state could afford to give them.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivan_Il...This book has stayed with me, mentally and emotionally, since my few years in assorted classrooms and while working in a university School of Education.
Were I able to influence America's Schooling Institution, Illich would be a guru.
He proves scholarly perspective on compulsory institutional schooling.
(Would like to have visited Illich's community, near Cuernavaca.
The worst was likely from tenured PhD's with degrees in Education.Conversely, one of those old professors provided me with a useful insight ...
I thought this was mind blowingly good.
Ivan is basically saying school is like a training ground for the perpetuation of a society to be the way it currently is.
And remain that way.
I barely remember anything I actually learnt from school which is not to say that I didn't learn much from the process itself but I dare say the years I spent in a well known fee paying grammar school could have been infinitely better spent.
A community environment aligned to a mentorship setting I believe is the way forward not a system which assigns u grades so u can compete at school and then compete afterwards in the office.
Düzen okullarını böyle açıklamakla birlikte İllıch'in deyimiyle "Okul, yaşadığınız topluma ihtiyacınız olduğuna sizi inandırmaya çalışan bir reklam ajansıdır." 🍁Çocukluk ve gençlik olgusunu kazıyıp yerine sınav ve stres olgusuyla dolu yararlı bir vatandaş olma kaygısı güden edimi yükleyen standart eğitim modellerine ülkemizde köy enstitüleri modeli ile darbe vurmuştuk fakat her yararlı şeyin çağımızda tahribata uğraması sonucunda o modelde yok edildi şuan çocuklar dört mevsim dört duvar arasında okul müdürlerinin ve öğretmenlerinin yontup şekil vermesini bekleyen modeller olmaktan öteye geçmeyen nesnelere dönüşmektedir ki özgür iradeli insanlar yetiştiren öğretmenleri de toplum yontup yok etmektedir.🍁Yeryüzü kaynaklarının tüketimi ve kirletilmesi insan imajının yozlaşmasının, bilincinde ki gerilemenin bir neticesidir.
I found many of Illich's arguments about institutionalized education compelling, especially those around decentralized "learning webs," but I wasn't convinced by his suggestion that true educational freedom requires the implementation of a system of tuition grants that would allow each citizen to direct their own education according to their intellectual and presumably material interests.
Illich cites monetarist champion Milton Friedman as inspiration for this model, and that's where we reach our fundamental disagreement; I don't think such a system would actually work if the ultimate goal is to ensure equitable, quality education for everyone (recall the criticism W.
etc.), learning based on free market principles cannot and will not lead to accessible and transformative education.
And the university system, while a significant improvement for me as a self-directed learner, was still plagued by many of the same institutional problems.Illich's main point is that people learn best when they can learn things in self-directed ways and learn them in the context of the world.
Institutional schooling, in its focus on curriculum (and these days, standardized testing) and its disconnection from the everyday world of things, can prevent people from learning.
115)."The public is indoctrinated to believe that skills are valuable and reliable only if they are the result of formal schooling.
Schools thus produce shortages of skilled persons" (p.
To have my life long feelings about school be so beautifully articulated in a book, was affirming, exhilarating,mind blowing, and life altering.My heart rate was accelerated through most of it.
My whole life, school has literally made me feel sick.
I came out of high school depressed, disconnected, and lost.
I have spent most of my adult life recovering from it.
My head is buzzing with Ivan Illich's vision.
School is robbing us of our humanity more and more everyday.
The expectations are higher and the one track for everyone, has just gotten worse.
"We must rediscover the distinction between hope and expectation." Ivan Illich Hear, Hear!!!!
"Institutional wisdom tells us that children need school.
Institutional wisdom tells us thatchildren learn in school.
But this institutional wisdom is itself the product of schoolsbecause sound common sense tells us that only children can be taught in school.
He proposes the visionary idea of "learning webs", which seems possible today with the existence of the internet, but was virtually unthinkable at the time this book was written (1971).A great book that should be read by everyone who sees problems in our current education system(s) and is actively looking for answers.
While there is a lot of outdated information here, particularly in the first few pages where Illich is setting up a context for his argument, the basic of tenants of his argument make incredible sense to me: school is not just a way to prepackage information that substitutes consumption for actual learning, but "an advertising agency which makes you believe that you need society as it is.
Not sure how much of Illich is behind all of that, but his understanding of how we learn and what place that has in our society makes one aware of the lack of unstructured time and how detrimental play is to learning.
Illich's central argument is that institutionalizing social problems results in a subterfuge whereby people stop thinking about the social problem and instead ask why the institution is failing.
If the problem is the scope of people's hope, imagination and work, then his solution is to take away the institutions, starting with schools.
Does anyone believe that in today's world, the abolition of shcools would not result in immediate increases in business activity which would take on many of the schools'previous functions?
Illich's ideas about computer-assisted, voluntary, anonymous study groups might have been a good idea if he, instead of talking about the elimination of schools, had begun a useful institution to rival it.
Bir kurumda (hastane) hayata gözlerini açıp, başka kurumlar aracılığıyla (okul, aile,işyeri vs) şekillendirilen bireye sunulan tüketim amaçlı, standart "herşey dahil paket bir yaşam"ın eleştirisi olmuş.
Bireyin kendi seçimlerinden uzak olan "bu paket yaşamın" kabul edilmesinde kurumsallaştırılmış, tekdüze ve otoriter anlayışa sahip "okul"ların rolü sorgulanmış.
Örneğin, mevcut sistemde, birey için doğumda giyeceği kıyafetlerin rengi dahil (pembe ya da mavi) herşey düşünülmüştür ve bu sistem varlığını/gerekliliğini "okul" adı verilen kurumlar aracılığıyla bireylere dikte etmektedir.
belirli bir müfredata sadık kalması nedeniyle tekçi bir anlayışa sahiptir; bu anlayış, standart  bir bireyin oluşmasına neden olmaktadır,3.
Illich's counter-proposal, in short, is open-learning based on peer-to-peer networking (remarkably predicting of a world where people are linked via computers years and years before personal pcs and the internet come about) and the disestablishment of degrees and certification as qualifications.
While I didn't find everything he said to be utopian, and even the author admits to flaws in his proposals, he does, however, point out that the status quo is hardly benevolent and working, and that alternatives shouldn't therefore be dismissed because of flaws, but on the weight of their benefits to pitfalls.
The core point changed my life: institutions often deny volition and agency to their clients, and this is perhaps the central fact to understand schools and children.
In a nutshell, Illich is pointing out that we don't treat children as truly human when we deny them the most basic choices about what they'll be doing and where and with whom.
I'm inclined to be dismissive of much of the politics in the book.
But the core point has so changed my thinking that I'm also inclined to doubt my negative judgement of other aspects of the book.
Illich takes on the last sacred cow: compulsory public education. Written in early 1970's, he was calling for the use of extended networks linking students to teachers. He was talking about the internet before there was one. I think he's largely correct that public education reinforces class differences and drains students of intrinsic motivation. It's painful to watch a child skip to school in kindergarten, but drag her feet by the time she gets to fourth grade.
Another must read classic by Illich.
Essentially correct about the ills of education except on one thing...I don't agree that we should eliminate state education, as corrupted as it is, we need to rebel inside and out.
anything by ivan illich will blow your mind
The division of teaching, instructing, curriculum vs learning, acquiring skills in a free environment bring to the fore the issue of institutionalization and reproduction and maintenance of society's myths as well as the cycle of production and consumption sustained and reinforced by modern education.The alternative of free webs of learning where people seek out teachers (elders) and partners ( peers) offers a dialectical approach to learning and approaches the issue of technology as a medium of facilitating learning.
Illich shows us that the institute of schooling as we know it shouldn't be taken at face value and argues for its abolishing.
I think this is obvious from the title.
Rather than changing the way we teach he says we should step away from schools altogether.
It has never occurred to me to question the basis of schooling.
At least it got me thinking.Things we take for granted were someone's design at some point in history.
The feeling of being an accomplice to this obsolete idea of compulsory entrapment of kids in a factory like institutions.
I don't like what state schools in Russia represent nowadays.
Yet, upon reading Illich, one is often shocked at the resonance of the problems in his time with those of todayIllich's basic premise is that school is a degrading institution which acts as a god of knowledge and which prepares a belief into the student of the efficiency and legitimacy of centralized bureaucratic institutions based on an approved certification by the state.
‘Eğitimciler eğitimi sertifikayla paketleyip sunmakta ısrarlı olduklarından, okullaşma suretiyle ne eğitimde ne de adalette bir gelişme kaydedilebilmektedir.’
Rather than being about skill acquisition or personal development, Illich identifies schools as the ideological wing of the consumption-production engine that is capitalism.
The criticism starts with Dewey's ideas about education, and moves through Johnson's Great Society, international development, drawing heavily on Illich's personal experiences in Mexico, the Vietnam War, and the industrial design of the transistor radio.
As a historical artifact, this work was published in 1971, when for a brief glorious moment it seemed like the Counterculture would triumph, and that all the corrupt and evil institutions of a rotten society would crumble to be replaced by a new dawn met people where they were.
“For most men, the right to learn is curtailed by the obligation to attend school.”Austrian-born Ivan Illich, author of Deschooling Society, lists life-long accomplishments and passions, not formal education, as his credentials.
Assistant pastor at an Irish-Puerto Rican parish in New York City, and later serving as vice-rector to the Catholic University of Puerto Rico, he co-founded of the Center for Intercultural Documentation in Cuervabaca, Mexico.In his philosophy and experience, public and compulsory education, and the widely accepted means of documenting acquired knowledge via certification and diploma, broadens the gap between the opportunities for the rich and the poor, and drains Western society coffers with ever-worsening scores and economic opportunities.
"A good educational system should have three purposes: it should provide all who want to learn with access to available resources at any time in their lives; empower all who want to share what they know to find those who want to learn it from them; and, finally, furnish all who want to present an issue to the public with the opportunity to make their challenge known.
Moreover, such new institutions should be channels to which the learner would have access without credentials or pedigree - public spaces in which peers and elders outside his immediate horizon would become available."
Illich argues that institutionalized education allows schools to monopolize learning, which is harmful because schools fail to distinguish between learning and teaching.
Illich explains that more often than not teachers merely enforce labyrinthine rituals, teaching students that valuable learning is the result of attendance and that only grades or certificates can measure it.
I think that most of Illich’s argument is still relevant today, but I wonder how the advent of the internet changes his alternatives to compulsory education, which all seem to involve connecting people who have similar interests or making information more accessible.
He places institutions on a left-wing/right-wing spectrum.
On the left end are what he deems "convivial" institutions.
On the right-wing, we have "manipulative" institutions, which, through their existence, either create a demand for a harmful product, as with the highways and automobiles, or otherwise force men into doing something, as with schools and the military.This is all as I understand it, anyway -- I must admit that a lot of Illich's points went over my head.
We lean on this institutional framework, but in doing so we give up many of our freedoms, including our freedom to think -- and do -- for ourselves.
