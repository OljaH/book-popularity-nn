The meat of the book lies in foundational techniques needed for a lot of tricks: jogged cars, false shuffles, deck-ordering, "Bottom-dealing" "steals" "second deals" and so on, as well as more sneaky/"underhand (excuse the pun) sleights (I still recall the thrill I got the day I worked out Malini's Side-Slip!) Sadly I have since lost my copy, which mitigates the thoroughness of this review, but the techniques contained therein are still with me.
"Expert Card Technique" is a lovely book, with something for every card-slinger, which can be dipped into for fun and diverison, or studied with great profit.
I have had this book for so long, and to this day have yet to finish it. However it still helps me out every once in a while. It's a good book...
Bought this book many years ago. Good book and easy to read. All in all, well worth buying.
Bought this book many years ago.The skills are clearly explained but I would have liked more pictures. Yet practice pays off as you work out what to do. It's packed with information and skills for you to master!If like me you only work on a few of the skills, it will still give you enough to create your own tricks!All in all, well worth buying.Enjoy.
nice
