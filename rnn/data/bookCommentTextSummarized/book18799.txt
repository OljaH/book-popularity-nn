It is an excellent book that shows love, romance, drama, revenge, and a lot of action!
In the book Twilight, Eclipse by Stephine Meyer, Bella is in love with Edward, but she is still thinking that she is in love with Jacob as well.
She could never have a normal life because she likes a were wolf and a vampire.
The biggest things in her life are graduation and picking between Edward and Jacob.
I felt like the book Twilight, Eclipse, by Shephine Meyer, had made me a more thoughtful person.
This book is full of love, romance revenge and a lot of drama!
قسمتهای میانی فیلم - سریالها همیشه سردتر و بی کیفیت تر از باقی قسمتها ساخته میشن ، این قسمت هم به همین صورت قربانی شد ، در صورتی که میتونست گرمتر باشه چون فاکتورهایی مثل کامل شدن مثلث عشقی بین "بلا ، جیکوب ، ادوارد" رو داره ، اما حیف که هدر رفته
I'll have to confess that I didn't "read" this movie companion cover to cover... I skimmed... read the captions and thoroughly enjoyed the pictures. I LOVE these movie companions to Twilight!
I loved the photos of the cast, location and sets. And also the many interviews, personal stories and behind the scenes.
These books are a glimpse behind the scene and for fans of these series I think they would greatly appreciate them because it shows how much work goes into these films.
Things you don’t even think of as being important might end up having a crazy impact on film.I feel like I learned a lot from reading these companion guides and it has made me love the films even more knowing how much work and effort the workers on these productions went through to bring these books to life.
Thank you and thank you Mark Cotta Vaz for creating a book that made me appreciate their hard work.
This third Twilight Saga movie companion is even better than the second one.
I think they get better the longer the movies and books go on.
As with the second one, I think this movie was better and it seemed like it was two or three different stories in one.
I prefer (usually) movies or stories like that.
I think they are more interesting (again usually).
I think Eclipse is probably my favorite book and movie out of the whole series.
I also like how much Carlisle (my favorite character) is in the book.
The lightest book in the series about the making of the Twilight movies. It did not really give many more details than were available on-line about the behind-the-scenes action.
AMAZING book. The way they depicted the plot was great! Its a good thriller-love story
I also loved seeing the detail put into creating the wolves, it’s incredible how much time and effort goes into something so small (In the grand scheme of things) such as their fur.
However it’s very clear that this effort paid off and any kind of slap dash job would have been very noticeable!One thing I found annoying was that all of the cast interviews (which weren’t interviews but small paragraphs without any prompts) they seemed to defend the choice of having different directors on each movie.
5/5 stars. A great read on the behind-the-scenes movie for Eclipse. The cast interviews were interesting to read about, especially Bryce Howard’s (new Victoria). I found it fascinating to see how much work went into certain scenes of the film (the bonfire scene, battle scene with the newborns and the mountaintop scene, the ravine chase scene). I have a new found respect for not only this film but for all movies in general. Overall, a nice edition to the movie companion series, is a favorite of mine, I would reread this book and recommend it.
Po menším zklamání, které přinesl průvodce Novým měsícem se Mark Cotta Vaz dostal zpět do formy a předvedl brilantní kus práce. Z mého pohledu filmu nic nechybělo a moc se mi líbilo, že slovo dostali i ti lidé, které ve filmu není vidět a přitom odvádí velmi poctivý kus práce - maskéři a lidi od kostýmu, kaskadéři/trenéři a lidé zodpovídající za technickou stránku věci (nejen počítačové triky či animace).
This book was definitely one of the best books I've ever read. I've read all of the first 3 twilight books and this one was definitely the best. I would always recommend this book to my friends and family, if someone asked me on a scale of one to ten how much do you like this book I would definitely say 10 out of 10.
