This is my favorite collection of Poe's poems and I was very surprised that the ISBN on the book registers with GoodReads but doesn't pull up the same book that I have.
Turns out that this book was published by Lowe & Behold (ridiculous name) which is an imprint of Borders.
Any one remember Border?
Anyway, this is a great collection, really well laid out and the two essays tacked on at the end, "The rationale of verse" and "The Poetic Principle" are both awesome (and completely over my head!) Uh-oh department: I think I have a raging battle going on in my head as to which Poe collection is actually my favorite.
I am remembering an over-sized illustrated collection that was formative for me in my youth!
There are some real classics here, not least of which are "Annabel Lee," "The Raven" and "The Bells." The collection I read - free on Kindle - also included a couple of essays on poetry by Poe.However, the collection as a whole struck me as repetitive in image, meter, and subject matter; while the essays themselves revealed the extent of what seems to be a rather considerable ego in their pedantic lecturing and self-glorifying examples from his own work.
They did, however, reveal something of the thought and process behind the writing of "The Raven," which was fascinating.I love Poe for his ability to see the beautiful in the ugly, the dark, and the melancholy.
Here we have a collection of poems from one of the masters, Edgar Allan Poe. There were some poems of his I had never read before, but am now a huge fan of, such as "Al Aaraaf."Along with the poems, there are two essays written by Mr. Poe, one on the Rationale of Verse, and another on the Poetic Principle. "Verse" was a bit tough to get through, but worth the read; while "The Poetic Principle" was a very good read and something I will be coming back to in the future.All in all, a sound collection.
Some poetry I do like!
