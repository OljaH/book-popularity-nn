I'm going to go out on a limb and say that Shneidman included it because Menninger had the cojones to address a topic that was simply not aired in 1938, at least in a book accessible to those who were not professional psychologists, and not so much because of anything that is actually written between the covers.I say that because what you get here is Freudianism unfiltered as the theoretical construct underlying the work, almost to the point of Holy Writ, some exceedingly strange leaps of logic, and a couple of bits here and there that I'm fairly sure are flat-out wrong.
This is really a tough and fantastic book. You have to be strong to read it. I've read its portuguese translation, 'cause I'm brazilian.
So so very technical. It was like reading a philosophy book. Although there were some interesting stories.
read for high school psychology class
Thanx
after reading this book, then I will comment it
Great book
