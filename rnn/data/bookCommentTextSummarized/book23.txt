the Dad in this unbearably unsupportive “no.
it hurts too much to see him blind—— so I am just going to stop talking to him or seeing him”.
Meanwhile, poor Keith is living to see how he is super failing at living up to his father’s insanely high expectations.
Poor Keith.
This book did two things very well: for one it presented the temptation of suicide ( something that, in a book published in 1919 just after the war must have been a prescient topic).
Secondly, it painted a picture of the ramifications of war and young men returning, like Keith, blind and very lost.
A tad disappointing. Saccharine triumph-over-blindness tale.
Enjoyable World War I morality tale.
More complex than Just David or Pollyanna, Dawn is the story of Keith Burton, his father Daniel, their employee Susan (who is one of the great unlikely heroines of literature) and the power of perseverance—no matter how faulty the attempts.My teenage son read this first and then I picked it up while he was in the middle of it.
My son appreciated how the story was unfolded through all the characters, sharing their hurts and worries, their joys and interpretations of situations.
Nothing in this book is easily gained and while the ending is satisfying it is so because of the work it takes the characters to get there.
Housekeeper and prolific poetess Susan Betts has her hands full with the Burton family when young Master Keith goes blind. Also, World War 1 breaks out. Not as saccharine-soaked as her Pollyanna books and thank God for that.
Kind of dark, but I am glad I 'read' it. I have been listening to these books at loyalbooks.com
This was a really cute book. I loved Pollyanna and this one did not disappoint.
