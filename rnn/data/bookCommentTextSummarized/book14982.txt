“It is our choices, Harry, that show what we truly are, far more than our abilities.” CHILLS.(REREAD)Okay DUH 5/5 stars. I actually liked this book more than I remembered! This used to be my least favorite of the Harry Potter books and, while that still might be true, I was more entertained than I expected! I always forget how different Book Ginny is from Movie Ginny (way better all around) and how she has such a bigger role in the books than the films.NOW ONTO HP AND THE PRISONER OF AZKABAN!
JK Rowling really knows how to write a great book, thats for sure! Although this wasn't my favorite book in the series, it definitely wasn't because it was bad. I loved the plot and conflict, even though it wasn't as intense as the others were. I was definitely shocked at the end...so epic and mind blowing!
I'm quite hyped to keep reading this series, The wizarding world is definitely an interesting one..Watch my review here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8Fk5...
I love this book, of course I do, but the fact remains that this book prominently featured two of my most hated Harry Potter characters.
Ginny Weasley and Dobby.
In my Harry Potter hate list, Ginny and Dobby probably rank somewhere below Umbridge and Peter Pettigrew.
All his eagerness and shit - and yeah, I know what happens in the end.
I still hate Dobby.
If he had been my elf, I'd have given him a sock already so he could his whimpering, sniveling ass out of my life.
“You know what, Harry?
If he doesn’t stop trying to save your life he’s going to kill you.”
Re-Read in December 2015 for Harry Christmas to YouThis time around I realized how much more entertaining this book is compared to the movie.
I love this series so much oh my Rowling.Re-Read in December 2014 for Harry Christmas to YouOH MY LORD VOLDEMORT.In this book we get more little hints to events to come in future books (Horcrux stuff, a mention of Voldemort having left a part of himself/his powers in Harry, etc.) WHICH WAS AWESOME.
I find that every time I read these books I notice more things, which was definitely true this time around.
I didn't experience them as a child and therefore my experience is clearly different than most others on here, but in some ways I think it's just as magical to read these for the first time as an adult as it was for everyone who devoured these as they were published in their childhood.
All I could think about was how desperately I wanted to escape all of my adult responsibilities for just a bit each day, and this was the perfect book to do so with.
Nothing can ever beat a Harry Potter book.
Apart from another Harry Potter book.
Unwillingly funny Moaning Myrtle!I think one of the reasons this may be the weakest part of the series is, that it resembles Part One so much: Someone tries to hurt Harry during Quidditch, there's a hidden chamber deep underneath Hogwarts and Harry has to face Voldemort in said chamber.Now, you have to understand that there is nothing I love more than Harry Potter, and this book is one of the most brilliant things ever written.
(A-) 83% | Very GoodNotes: A bit bland at times, with less wonder and discovery than before, but finishes well with a more satisfying conclusion.
Harry got a shock the first time he looked in the mirror over the kitchen mantlepiece and it shouted, 'Tuck your shirt in, scruffy!' The ghoul in the attic howled and dropped pipes whenever he felt things were getting too quiet, and small explosions from Fred and George's bedroom were considered perfectly normal.
What Harry found most unusual about life at Ron's, however, wasn't the talking mirror or the clanking ghoul: it was the fact that everybody there seemed to like himPoor sweet Harry and I would love to live with the Weasleys' for a bit =) Look at cute, fat little Scabbers ↓The kids are going to meet Hermione to get some shopping done.
This is Rowling's rare gift: making sure that we see through the eyes of Harry, Ron and Hermione.The summer holidays have passed, and the new school year is about to start at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.
Any excuse to read Harry Potter.Vote: 9Lettura serale per mia figlia (e seconda rilettura per me).
E' ancora una volta emozionante vagare per le sale di Hogwarts e osservare i fatti misteriosi che coinvolgono i protagonisti, proprio come se fossimo lì anche noi.
Fare in modo che vediamo con gli occhi di Harry, Ron ed Hermione.Trascorse le vacanze estive, alla scuola di magia e stregoneria di Hogwarts sta per iniziare il nuovo anno.
I sat down to "read a few pages" of this before bed two nights ago and had to force myself to stop at page 100...then picked it up and flew through the rest the next day.I really enjoyed this one (as did millions of others, obviously) and, with this installment, I am definitely seeing why this is such a beloved series.
And, yes, I know it's probably made you gasp in shock that - in addition to never having read the books before now - I have also never seen any of the movies...and I truly have no idea what happens throughout the remainder of the series.
Come for the saga. Stay for Gilderoy Lockhart.
THE ILLUSTRATED EDITION IS SO GOOOOOD. However, I will say the two page spread that was full of spiders was a wee bit freaky
We all know, after all, that she covered discrimination, wars, hate crime, the Kardashians, etc.Let's take this book for example.
A fame enamored charlatan, who knows nothing about anything, except memory spells.
So clearly a Kardashian.
Now some might ask: do Kardashians know memory spells.
Keeping Up with the Kardashians is already on Season 13, so some magic must be at work, otherwise you'd have to think the world has gone mad!!!!!Carrying on, Harry has an awful year, mostly because of the fact that he can talk snake language.
In memory of Alan Rickman who showed us what Severus Snape looks like on the Big Screen.I made myself a promise not to use any stills from any Harry Potter movies in my reviews for any book of the series, but I have to make an exception today January 14, 2016 thus the image above.Even people who somehow managed to avoid reading the books and seeing the movies can guess that this book is about Harry Potter's second year the School of Wizardry, Hogwarts.
I saw lots of people say he is not the main hero of the series; he is just a guy who always gets either lucky, or have a helpful friend handy in tight spots.
I love the Weasleys even more than I already did.I am so glad my mother never sent me a Howler.I thought Dobby was annoying in the movie (which I saw when it came out over a decade ago, not having read the book) but I thought he was awesome in the book.
In fact, we rewatched the movie last night, and not only was it as unsatisfying as I remember it, it's just a shit adaptation of this book.I thought it was delightful that (view spoiler)[the flying car went into the Forbidden Forest and went feral (hide spoiler)].Tom Riddle's diary was really, really awesome.
Reading HP to ring in the new year may be a new tradition of mine, since I've done just that two years in a row. I haven't read this book since the first time I read it in 5th grade, but I loved it! I never would have thought before that CoS was one of my favorites from the series but I stand corrected.
I would love to know!
:D2,000,000 Stars!This was me at the beginning of the book:This was me during the book:This was me at the end of the book:Why did I give this one 5 stars?
It's Harry Potter.
This book was just as good as Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, if not better!
This one definitely gave me the feels, you know what I mean?
The ending was an on-my-fucking-god-just-happened-moment.
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets was perfection.
Everything in this baby was so good and well-written, I just can't put into words how much I enjoyed reading this :) ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ Super excited for this one!
Before I say anything else, it's important you know that I LOVE HARRY POTTER.
LOVE.That being said, this is my least favorite of the early books (I'll let you know whether it's my least favorite overall after I reread HARRY POTTER AND THE ORDER OF THE PHOENIX).The reasons are LEGION:1.
Gilderoy Lockhart is a prat and I hate him.2.
The trouble Harry and Ron get Mr. Weasley into stresses me out.5.
This is Harry Potter we're talking about, so there's also plenty of awesomeness:1.
(hide spoiler)]SO.
Even if this is my least favorite, it's still Harry Potter, and Harry Potter = AWESOME.
When everyone first read and loved Harry Potter I ignored it.
Harry's existence with his Muggle uncle and auntie is as horrible as ever and he can't wait to get back to Hogwarts after speaking to a mini-elf masochist who essentially predicts his doom and travelling in an awesome magic-infused flying car.
Upon returning to Hogwarts it's similar to before, Quidditch lessons, Malfoy being a bit of a tosser, Hermainie loving studying, and the wizarding threesome getting into all sorts of nonsensical antics.
These books are what I go to for now when I want no-nonsense, uncomplex awesomeness.
Well, I felt that way before starting this, but I can definitely say that Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is another fabulous installment in the rightfully beloved Harry Potter series!And while I will admit to not loving it quite as much as its predecessor, I still enjoyed it a great deal.
(hide spoiler)]In a summary, I didn't find the story involving Lockhart quite as interesting as Harry's realization of his true abilities and the escapades of his first year at Hogwarts.But HP II undoubtedly still has plenty of hilarious moments and magical wonders - not to mention the lovely cast of characters - to more than compensate for this particular installment's slightly lacking plot.
Re-read #?: November 27-28, 2014Re-read #??: November 29-December 3, 2016While this is probably one of my least favorites of the series, it's still a fantastic book.
There are so many hints to later parts of the series in this book!
It's also really fun to see things of importance show up early in the story come into significance later on.Here are some thoughts on things I noticed or didn't remember about this book while I was reading it:-Like in one of the Harry Potter video games, Ron and Harry de-gnome the Burrow's garden at the beginning of the book.
dnf @50%so lame, boring, petty, plotless, uninteresting, lame, boring, and boring. harry potter is just not for me, I think I'm just gonna give up trying to read these books. ___tbh, the only reason i wanna finish this series, is so i can finally watch the movies 😂Also buddy read with that mr. thicc asshole who took forever to read the first book and had me waiting aka salmon aka Solomon who I'll tag soon.
I promised my besties that I wouldn’t roast this book :) so I’m gonna try my very best :)(s) (the fan art in this fandom is effing gorgeous you talented peeps) Recap - Harry is still a live and breathing special snowflake- All that happened was they drove a car- That’s it- For 150 pages- The only event that took place- Was driving an effing car in the sky- Okay, right we said no roasting- Ummmmm, Hermione is awesome, I like her- Ron is meh- Malfoy seems like the only complex character- The secon

This is the worst book in the Harry Potter series. The fact that I’m still giving it four stars sort of says something about my opinion for the rest of the series. It’s a wonderful world. The magic is alive and the storytelling is extraordinary, but here are three reasons why this could never be five stars in my estimation like the rest:1. Gilderoy Lockhart. The man is ridiculous to the point of revolting. I don’t need to say anything else. 2. The flying car bits were just stupid. More people wo

It’s a wonderful world.
The magic is alive and the storytelling is extraordinary, but here are three reasons why this could never be five stars in my estimation like the rest:1.
Gilderoy Lockhart.
The man is ridiculous to the point of revolting.
The first one is a genuine reason and the last two mere petty grievances.
There was also something a little off about this book.
❝It is our choices, Harry, that show what we truly are, far more than our abilities.❞ Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets starts off where Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone left off. Harry goes back to his old home for summer and spends time with his ugly family, The Dursleys. They are no different then they were before but in fact are even more rude. As Harry thinks about going back to Hogwarts, a new and ugly creature appears in Harry's bedroom as Harry returns upstairs. His name is D
But because Harry does not listen and is actually able to go back to Hogwarts thanks to his best friend Ron, a lot of things happen this second year and some aren't the best.
He isn't learning quick like Harry but I know the time will come and he will become a good wizard and be able to change things into the right objects, be able to drive a flying car correctly, and defend his friend like he defended him when he needed the saving.
I read this all in one 8 hour sitting... I need a life

There is only one "chamber of secrets" that is of any human concern, and it is no coincidence that the book of such a title was written by a woman.By sending her young, immature male character, Harry (whose name, along with Tom and Dick, just happens to be one of the "universal" male names) into the mysterious Chamber, Rowling is exploring her memories of early childhood sexuality.
And there's only one thing that a huge, terrible serpent can represent.Rowling's sexual past is the fertile ground in which this book was grown.
