People were depending on me. I had been beaten many times. But I had never just quit. Not once. Not ever. This book! OMG, my heart is still beating so fast as though it's going to jump out of my chest! What an adrenaline-pumping ride!Ok, take a deep breath...Alright, I will keep this short as I know that there's no way I can write this review without going into detail, in which will ultimately give the story all away. So, no spoilers here.Once again, Lee Child dazzles me with this top-notch sto
So, no spoilers here.Once again, Lee Child dazzles me with this top-notch story, filled with the thrill of the unforeseeable events and dangerous situations that Reacher had to face.
The book started off great, with a heart-pounding abduction scene, which had me hooked right off the bat.
As the story went on, there were so many thoughts and questions racing through my mind and every exciting turn of events made my head spin.
I can tell you that this book kept me on the edge of my seat for almost the entire story.And as always, Jack Reacher has yet to fail me.
This is the first Jack Reacher book I’ve read.
Maybe I should have started with the first one in the series, but I picked up this one used.
Reading some of the Goodreads comments about the varied quality of the Reacher series, I was probably better off starting with this one.The tricksy misdirection at the beginning of the book aside, this was a decent read.
Reacher, reminded me of Robert B.
Parker’s Spenser, big, tough, smart, can handle himself in any situation.
But he’s not a private investigator and he has fewer scruples than Spenser.
In creative ways.I should read something cheery and positive next.
I probably won’t.
I am totally loving this series.
(Although I think it must be best NOT to read them back to back because then the formula wears through.) This is a good one -- tense, claustrophobic, and non-stop action.
Two quibbles -- the romance between Reacher and Duffy seems...unmotivated.
Like the author says to himself, "And this is the place where I start the romance," and proceeded to have Reacher make out with the nearest available female character.
Also, the last 20 percent of the novel seems unduly long...and a bit confusing.
I love it when a plan comes together.
This bad-ass walks around with an anaconda in his pants (apparently, that's a type of revolver but it's still pretty impressive)He has an AOL device hidden in his shoe. He says nothing a lot. So does everyone else in this novel. I'm not cut out for crime fiction. It bugs me.
To me this was the best of the series after Killing Floor.
The book opens with Reacher wearing a Colt Anaconda, which is a huge stainless steel revolver chambered for the .44 Magnum cartridge.

Quinn was supposed to be dead and Reacher is going to make sure he stays that way.
After reading a couple, you pretty much know what you're going to get, and you keep reading more because what you want is what Child delivers.
That is, action, thrills, a little sex, despicable villains and a big-ass juggernaut of justice willing to crack skulls and shoot people until all the bad guys are dead.
I often wonder if Reacher really thinks thing through first.So if you're looking for a clever, delicately nuanced thriller with a plot as tangled a spider's web, Persuader ain't it.
I didn't like the character Duffy in the first place (she seemed rather dim witted) and it appeared to me that the romance between her and Reacher was placed only so Child could have a sex scene in the book.
This just seemed dumb, and served only to set up the next sequence of scenes (which I admittedly loved; I just think Child could have found a far better way to get to them).Overall, Persuader was an excellent edition to a series I love and a great development to a character I love.
An awesome Novel.My RATING: 4.4/5The Novel is in full throttle. The flashback story line is awesome and the twist in the flashback is great. The novel is fun and intriguing. Back to awesomeness !See u guys at next, Thank you.
I love the thinking process in the writing as Reacher tries to solve yet another mystery, but this time, he's a bit slower figuring out the clues.
What the hell is he thinking?
I really enjoy how Reacher's past is written and incorporated into some of these books.
The butchering of the women is enough to make you cringe, but not so bad that you regret this read.
Reacher has come across a nemesis 10 years after he supposedly killed him, but this bad dude didn't die.
Reacher, no longer an MP, pulled out his superman suit and said "Time for round two" and I was hooked.
My name is James, and it's been seven months since my last Jack Reacher. The seventh in the series,  Persuader  should follow the same, increasingly predictable formula. Except, something feels wrong; it doesn't feel like Reacher – from the unusual eagerness to get involved, and the carrying of two guns, to the shooting of a cop. These things are totally out of character for the man we've spent six novels getting to barely know. Then I realised, the biggest thing that feels wrong about this Reac
His detachment and taciturnity almost requires third-person – once we get in his head we'll get to know far too much about him, and that will just destroy the mystique.The book itself?
will pretty much know exactly what's going on here.While I kinda think I understand why Child went with the first-person here, in that it allows a much more tightly controlled narrative – we aren't aware of anything going on outside of Reacher's direct experience, and that leaves the other characters motives much less well defined and cranks up the suspense.
Ultimately I don't think it was necessary and it just feels too 'personal' to be in Reacher's head like that.
Number 7 in the Jack Reacher series.
Jack is quick enough to get the number plate of the car that the dead man just got into.
Jack explains his interest in the number plate and the FBI explain to Jack their interest in same plate.
A scenario is set in motion that gets Jack inside working for the criminals as a security guard.From this point on Jack is dancing with death for the next 400 pages.The tension is unrelenting and will, at times, leave you breathless.Whilst this number 7 in the series it can be read as a stand alone.
A 4 star read - but I just had to throw in another star for such a great series - and of course- a great character!!! I know I'm behind in this series- I started with book 1 and I am reading them all in order- looking forward to book number 8 !!
Just to make it more epic, dude lives on a peninsula guarded by a huge wall and a giant, steroid-addled disgusting fuck named Paulie, so physically intimidating that Reacher admits Paulie's outsizing him "put him squarely in the freak category."This is the perfect Reacher book: truly vile villains that deserve Reacher's own brand of justice, several criminal conspiracies going on to be revealed, Child's stylistic, utilitarian elegance, and a fantastic and liberal deployment of true tension, as well as mysteries: Where's the missing agent?
If you're into stuff like this, you can read the full review.Shit, This Thing Is Selling Millions: "Persuader" by Lee Child I’m taking two risks here by writing this review.
I have the distinct impression that I’ve written about this in several of my previous texts.
The second risk might be because you might incur a waste of my (and your) time by reading this diatribe.
After reading one more Reacher book, I just had to write (again) about this.
Imagine the following dialogue with the author of this text: “Shit, this thing is selling millions.
I'm going to add the same review for all of the Reacher series, so if you've read this one, you've read 'em all.
Jack seems to implicitly understand that he is a unique animal/human running around on this planet and that in spite of social conventions, cultural trappings, and whatever conventions and abstractions we allow into our mind in order to alleviate this core fact of our singularity (and aloneness)...the truth of it is not something Mr. Reacher denies.He embraces it.
Understands his philosophy implicitly, revels in his physical being,his conventions and values.
Nice title. Easy read, not very challenging either.Plot was great.Written like this review.
Reacher fights a man the size of Texas, and fires shotguns that could blow a drug tunnel to Mexico. What more can you ask for?
The Jack Reacher books by Lee Child are like crack.
The novels read like the fast paced action thrillers they are.
For the first half of this breathless novel we discover nothing about the man Reacher is seeking other than he had done something very bad during Reacher's time as an army MP.
I don't know how much about Reacher we learn in novels three through six but in this one we discover a little of his past and learn a little about what makes the man tick.
Another fun tough guy Reacher story.
Several scenes where he takes out bad guys, my favorite parts.STORY BRIEF:Reacher thought he killed bad guy Quinn ten years ago.
There’s a fun scene later where Reacher kills two men with one stone.
I did not like the way the author told the back story from ten years ago.
I would have preferred the author tell it completely at the beginning of the book and then do the current day story without interruption.
Also, I would have liked an epilogue to find out what happened to Beck and his family.THE SERIES:This is book 7 in the Jack Reacher series.
This is the book that put Lee Child on my must-always-read list.
Also, I had met Lee by then and he is so handsome and dreamy that it's hard not to see his beautiful, sensitive eyes whenever I think of Jack Reacher.Of note: Lee told me that his research for Killing Floor was watching My Cousin Vinny over and over again and I figured that was punishment enough (and it's set in Alabama, so that makes more sense that people would be so stupid; haha, I'm playin' you, big AL.
War Eagle!)
Pretty much what is to be expected from a Jack Reacher book, simple premise that escalates to a more complex and twisty story, cool stuff and ass kicking haha. This book had one of my favourite scenes so far........Reacher kind of out matched by a 7ft tall steroid freak, a great pages long fight with some superb depictions of the odd broken body part...or three😂
A plan with so many ways it could backfire…and it does in ways expected and not.Duke's got some cheek, dissin' on Reacher just 'cause he killed a cop.
Always there is someone in need of Reacher's kind of help.Richard Beck is terrified of being kidnapped again.
Meeting a big player from L.A. which brings him onto the DEA's radar.Duke is in charge of the Becks' security.
Paulie is the security on the gate and way bigger than Reacher and no sense of pain.
Only, he takes a lot of liberties and doesn't seem to actually work for Beck.
Harley is also security who doesn't work for Beck.
Great action; totally outlandish, but (in the moment definitely) believable plot; lots of testosterone-y fun.Two things I'd like to mention about this book.
And even if it was tired then, Child does it right, and I would've been totally on board with it then.
Great hook to begin the book.
Really great.Secondly, I couldn't help but be impressed with the way that Child laid out Reacher's motivation to hunt down this particular criminal in bits and pieces, scattered throughout the present day action.
Giving Reacher the proper motivation each time to go after the baddie has to be a struggle, especially since it has to be sufficient motivation to get him to perform superhuman tasks.
این گذشته طوری نبود که کل شخصیت و رفتار جک ریچر رو برای همیشه تغییر بده ولی روی جک ریچر تاثیر گذار بود و حداقل توی این داستان و ماجرا نقش مهمی داشت.باید بگم که فلش بک های زیادی در طول کتاب هست و داستانی در گذشته رو روایت میکنه که از اواسطش یجورایی میفهمیم قراره ته داستان چی بشه اما ذره ذره و یواش یواش اون رو به خورد ما میده و وقتی احساس میکنیم دیگه اون داستان یا بهتره بگم اون خاطره داره تموم میشه یکهویی ما رو به زمان حال برمیگردونه.
I listened to the end, so I must give it at least two stars.
Can't even count all of the folks he kills in the book.
The main evil guy he kills twice, pretty clever I suppose--once in the flashback but obviously not really and once in the present of the story.
And tries to save, sometimes succesful sometimes not, that helps propels the story.
Failure to save the damsel.
Why do I read to the end.
I'm propelled by a plot.
And also just interested in how folks write novels that make them rich and popular.
Another exciting Jack Reacher adventure.
Each time I pick one of these up on a Daily Deal I always think that it will be my last, but Lee Child has a great pen for action-adventure.
In this addition Jack finds himself knee deep in a covert mission where he is to extract an under cover operative that is caught up in a drug opperation, however, all things are not what they may seem.
I will be picking up the next Daily Deal in this series.
Jack is (in this volume) the ex-MP (as opposed to the books where we get stories during his time as active duty MP).
As a matter of fact Reacher had no doubts he was dead (view spoiler)[ as Jack shot him...in the head.
So , I won't say more except that this is a pretty good book.
As with the other Reacher books I could be a little picky about some logical flaws but aside from that we get what is usually called a "rollicking good adventure".
As always good reliable storytelling so...you know..enjoy.
As the world beyond the room goes silently into the embrace of Morpheus, hapless guys stuck with an unputdownable read, keep rubbing their eyes, and carry on.
It happens whenever a Jack Reacher novel gets picked up by me.
It happens especially if Reacher has some unfinished business, that must be settled NOW.
Because, right then the book becomes an unfinished business, and I become Jack Reacher.Unfortunately, the climax of this book came as a massive disappointment.
Awesome arc of characters and story developed over hundreds of pages.
Just don't read the last forty odd pages, and imagine the conclusion yourself.
Е, в тая книга каквото можеше да се огелпи, се огелпи. Ама батко Джак, както винаги, е на висота! :)
