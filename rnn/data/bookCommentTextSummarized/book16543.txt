One day at noontime, Schwab was walking through one of his steel mills when he came across a group of men smoking directly under a sign that said No Smoking.Do you suppose that Charles Schwab pointed at the sign and said, "Can't you read?"Absolutely not, not that master of human relations.Mr. Schwab chatted with the men in a friendly way and never said a word about the fact that they were smoking under a No Smoking sign.Finally he handed them some cigars and said with a twinkle in his eye, "I'd appreciate it, boys, if you'd smoke these outside."That is all he said.
This book is written by the Dale Carnegie association.
There are 17 chapters that show the traits and situations of an effective leader.
The book focuses of communication, motivating others, building teams, having a positive state of mind, how to handle mistakes and criticism, how to set goals that can be achieved by the person and his team.
This book also sheds light on how to show genuine interest in people; being them coworkers, employees, or just friends.
It’s an interesting book for anyone who is trying to improve him/herself and find a leader in their self.

Taught me that everyone can be a leader! We just have to change our mindset and mentality, identify out leadership strength, balance work and leisure, control our worries and energize our life, become a team player and strenghten cooperationamond associates, achieve our goals and increase our self-confidence! Good book indeed~
قراءة هذا الكتاب الفريد من نوعه مكنتني من حسن التعامل مع الناس حولي بشكل أفضل... وعلى المستوى المهني فالأمثلة التي ذكرت به قوية و قيمة .. تفكيرك يتغير و زاوية نظرك تتسع اتجاه عملك أو الأنشطة التي تزاولها خارج أوقات العمل. بعد قراءته.
This book did one thing for me: got me to clean my office and keep it that way. It is less helpful than it could be. It ended up just being a few nuggets of wisdom interspersed with numerous tales of successful people being successful. It was rather unhelpful and I didn't bother finishing it.
One of the best case study mention in the book is story about a business person who got bankrupt and he had to leave his house with all things in it.
Amazing case study 👌What I didn't like: It could have been better as it has repeat content like all typical Dale's book where same thing is being repeated over and over again by mentioning various individuals name with high profile designations and multinational companies.Overall very educating and good self-help book.
كتاب شيق ومفيد جدا .. حيث يعلمك كيف تنمى شخصيتك وليس بالضروره ان تكون صاحب عمل ولكن لكى تكون ناجح فى حياتك عموما أيضا يعلمك كيف تتعامل مع التركيبات الشخصية المختلفة والمعقده !أنوى على قراءته مره أخرى ان شاء الله

Working in a managerial level, dealing with people from all walks of life and staying in a highly pressurized job, reading Dale Carnegie makes my look at life in a wider perspective & acceptance of people for what they are...

Always love Dale Carnegie's books!
This is another book of wonder by Dale Carnegie. Great examples and stories made this book more interesting than it already was. The systematic representation of points in this book made it easier to understand. The language used was simple and easy. A great motivational read indeed.
loved this bookso useful for communication and connection
Really helping and teach me about leadership and leading people in business and how to work with other people while influencing them with your work and attitude.
كتاب ثري بالمعلومات الرآئعة ولكن طريقة السرد مملة جداً لم تعجبني  لكني اردت ان استفيد من كل معلومة استغرقت سنة لكي اتممه 👎🏻شكراً لـ ديل كارنيجي يبدو لي انني لست من هواه هذا النوع من الكتب رغم فائدة القيمة
However, it's an effective book, and contains a lot of good and practical advice that people in leadership positions ought to know (and you'll find as you go along that most of the people you've encountered in life in such positions really could use a healthy dose of this book).
There are MANY competing books in this genre, especially tie-ins to popular seminar programs, but you need not go to such a seminar to benefit from this book (true of any Carnegie book).
I won't go so far as to say it's required reading, but it's a good idea even if you have been through programs such as Willingham's Integrity Selling and some of the other "hot" combinations of written material and presentation.
Despite the wealth of technical advances in the 1990s workplace, managing, motivating, and communicating remains a challenge. The Leader in You adapts the simple, time-tested management theories of Dale Carnegie to this high-tech environment with refreshing results. Read in an engaging but direct tone, the tape's pace is varied with excerpts from recent management studies and anecdotes from contemporary business leaders. It's a sound introduction to leadership skills for anyone working in the public, private, or nonprofit sector.
كتاب رائع يشرح فيه الكاتب الأسس العملية للنجاح و المتمثلة بشكل أساسي بعدة نقاط من اهمها ( العلاقات الإنسانية و الاتصال مع الآخرين - التوازن - الحماس - التفاؤل ) عن طريق طرح الأفكار و إثباتها بالأمثلة الواقعية لأشخاص حصلت معهم
Recycled version of "How to win friends and influence people".It's not even written by Dale Carnegie. Very misleading.
هذا الكتاب أمدني بطاقة إيجابية عظيمة ألهمني بأفكار في القيادة تفيدني في عملي ايضاً أصبحت أرى تصرفات بسيطه لكن الاستمرار عليها يزيد الوضع سوءاً ، وكذلك زاد من ثقتي بنفسي كقائد حينما علمت أن بعض الامور التي اسير عليها هي من اهم سمات القائد . أنصح بقراءته .
Interesting bookI enjoyed reading this book and I recommendThis book to improve their thinking brainIt was well written and worth reading
Sebenarnya buku ini bagus bgt seperti buku-buku Dale Carnegie lainnya. Tapi karena isinya 'cuma' pengembangan dari buku-buku Dale sebelumnya (yang dah ku 'hafal', jd aku agak bosan bacanya.. :D
Driving my old car for a while so I rented this cassete, not bad so far
هناك فرق بين القائد و المدير فالاول ملهم و مبدع اما الاخر فهو جزء من الهيكل الادارى .اافضل ما فى الكتاب الامثله خصوصا اى بى ام,كنتاكى و والت ديزنى كتاب ايجابى و اسلوبه غير اكاديمى.
I really enjoyed this book. Although, it was meant for a more professional audience, I felt the tips were useful to anyone who wants to be a more likeable person. I highly recommend this book.
كتاب جميل يستحق القراءة قراءة ممتعة
كتاب عملي و مفيد أكثر عبارة استفدت منها هي " هناك طريقة واحدة في العالم لجعل أي شخص يفعل أي شيء هي أ تجعله يرغب في ذلك و تذكر أنه ليس هناك طريقة أخرى "رائع
Tons of information. Ideas on how to be a better person/leader.
