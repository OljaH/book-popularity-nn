Easy read, but very informative. Good profile of military leaders by Hart.
Great read on strategy. Liddell Hart in my opinion the greatest writer to ever pick up this subject.
The entire book is a portrait of pre-Napoleonic figures who are used by Hart to illustrate the principle of mobility. Written in 1927 and coming out of the Great War, a war with no mobility whatsoever, the book seems stuck in its time. However, the profile on James Wolf is both fascinating and enlightening. Need to read more on the Battle on Quebec.
Liddell Hart is one of the great strategic thinkers of the 20th century and he applies his knowledge and theories to analyze five creative military minds: Jenghiz Kahn (and Sabutai), Marechal de Saxe, Gustavus Adlophus, Wallenstein and General Wolfe.
Second, aside from Jenghiz Kahn and Sabutai, the subjects are less explored historically except in more specialized, technical, and dry, treatises.
Honestly, how many of you had heard of Marechal de Saxe before?I personally feel that the study of military strategy, and the exploration of the ways various strategists use available resources to best each other, has applications outside the purely military realm.
Wonderful read. Liddell Hart's feeling and regard for these men comes through in his writing and it is hard not to get swept up in his view of their lives and actions. After reading this book, I developed a strong interest in learning more about Subotai and Wallenstein's histories in particular. I read this book for school, but this is an easy read for anyone interested in military leadership and history.
It's more than just about the great captains. A great swath of history passes in review from cover to cover.
Short mini-biographies of history's Great Captains, from Genghis Khan to General Wolfe. Easy to read in bite-sized chunks over the course of a few evenings.
