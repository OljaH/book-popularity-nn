It got me through first year university. That makes it five stars.
I want to read the book
I cannot rate this book against my previous text books because I have not gone through the entire book, but I do like page 574, as I recall with some amount of nostalgia learning to solve partial differential equations in my Theromdynamics class before havaing taken Differential Equations, and thinking that it was so much better that way, and wishing that all application subjects could be taught before the pure subject classes, rather than as we do it the other way around.
this is very helpful for me
Calculus and analytic geometry by George B. Thomas (1968)

Who could forget Dr. Roy and an asymptote curving as it approaches zero for infinity? I could. I was busy staring at Colleen.
