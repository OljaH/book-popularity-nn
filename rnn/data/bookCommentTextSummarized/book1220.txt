Great as all of his books are but especially appropriate in these times. He talks about the deer over population because we killed off the cougars. Now we have the same problem because we killed off and/or moved the wolves. All things created by God in nature were created by him for a reason !!
Takes place in the Grand Canyon region during the 1920s. Since it was written in 1925, the style is kind of like Little Women. Different kind of western, as the protagonist is fighting for conservation rather than against the Indians.... Predictable romance. Not bad, but not memorable.
One of several Zane Grey westerns read several years ago.
