But, at the start of the story, he’s a miserable un-showered, un-shaven heap locked in a messy apartment overflowing with old pizza boxes while claiming to have the flu.Right.What he really has is a bad case of the Break Up.See Real Life Drew was once a player.
It’s like he’s right there telling you the story.
Tangled was essentially an enemies-to-lovers story about guy falling in love for the first time with a girl who goes toe-to-toe with him on everything.
As he tells his story, Drew learns the one thing he never wanted in life, is the only thing he can’t live without.

Yeah, the guy getting the blow job from the luscious redhead in the bathroom stall? That’s me. The real me. MBF: Me Before Flu.    So, like I said what you’re seeing right now isn’t the real me. I have the flu.Influenza.Have you ever noticed some of the worst sicknesses in history have a lyrical sound to them? Words like malaria, diarrhea, cholera. Do you think the
*pets* *evil grin*Isn't it strange that every man who's got the flu is dying--right in front of your eyes.
Just so you know, men don’t expect a woman to smell like Winter Pine or Niagara Falls or whatever the fuck those feminine products say.
I didn't want you meeting Kate until I was done smoothing things the hell over."Mackenzie takes my friend the Bad Word Jar out of her backpack and holds it up.

Pussy whipped, thy name is Drew.Yeah, I know.
So after seeing this book completely TAKE OVER my newsfeed in what could only be described as “ Goodreads Tangled-Gate of 2013”…   I finally had to cave and read this book. And for the next two days… you wanna know what I was doing?A WHOOOOOOOLE LOTTA THIS:       And might I just say…Snaughling?That’s some intense shit. ;) But seriously, you’re going to be doing that ugly-laughing thing where you know, you hug lower body and mascara’s running down your face and you’re rolling on the ground maki

FUN STORYLINE + HILARIOUS DIALOGUE + HOT HERO & KICKASS HEROINE = 5 STAR WORTHY WINNING COMBINATION.And reading this story from the point of view of a guy like Drew? Pure fun and entertainment, I assure you! ;)Let's meet the man of the hour shall we... "See that guy - black suit, devilishly handsome?

FUN STORYLINE + HILARIOUS DIALOGUE + HOT HERO & KICKASS HEROINE = 5 STAR WORTHY WINNING COMBINATION.And reading this story from the point of view of a guy like Drew?
He tells it like it is, straightforward and to the point.Being inside Drew's head and getting the entire story from his point of view, is one of things I loved most about this book.
(hide spoiler)] But in the end, after some swoon-worthy Notebook-like attempts on Drew's behalf to make things right, the story does have a HEA....
This book reads like what a GIRL thinks a guy is like.
We get the adorable niece (which can be replaced by doting younger sister in some books), who shows a dickhead's "loving" side.
I didn't think this book was funny.
I didn't think this book was entertaining.
I didn't think the male MC read like a man or how a man thinks.
The only reason this book gets an extra 1/2 a star is because the narrator did a nice job reading the story, but if I didn't spend good money on the ebook + the audiobook upgrade, I would have DNFed it (like I wanted to do!) ages ago.
5+++ Fantastic and Hilarious Stars!!! If you are like me and you adore the lovable assholes, the jerks, and the manwhores... then Drew Evans is just the guy for you!!! This book had me hooked from the very first page and I couldn’t get enough! Being inside Drew Evan’s head was amazing! One of the funniest and most enjoyable stories I have read in a really long time!  Meet Drew Evans. He is a successful business man, a handsome guy, he’s got great friends, a loving family, and as many women as he
then Drew Evans is just the guy for you!!!
He is a successful business man, a handsome guy, he’s got great friends, a loving family, and as many women as he could ever want.
Throughout this story, Drew gives us a ton of fun facts and info: 
I’m not the kind of guy who rides the same rollercoaster twice 
They get to know each other better and Drew decides he wants Kate.
Drew screws up a ton, but he is a guy, what do you expect?
The whole time I was reading, I felt like Drew was talking to me.
4.5 stars Wrong!  It's Drew Evans.Drew is crude, crass, vulgar. He's immature and spoilt. He wants only one thing from a woman. He's a chauvinist pig. He's a man whore. He is disgusting. He is hilarious! Have you ever seen those romantic comedy movies where there's an undeniable attraction between the leads but they're also competitors in the office? This is the rom-com novel equivalent.For once this novel lives up to all the hype, squeeing and fangirling!If you love romantic comedies, that are

<--reread 2017This one held up during a second reading, and I'd still recommend it to anyone who isn't looking for prince charming to actually be...charming.Also.In the story, Drew is a brunette, but since the beauty of books is that I can imagine whatever the fuck I want...
Tangled is one of those stories that I just chalked up to complete fantasy, and decided not to let my sensible side squish the fun.Mild Spoilers Ahead: Here's what I thought the author did right:First, when Drew realizes he's in love, he doesn't run off and deny it.

They fight, they share angry kisses and then they fight some more, until things happen and Drew gets the flu and he realizes that maybe his perfect life is not so perfect without Kate Brooks after all.
! There's no female author that can write a male POV better than Emma Chase, she's the I-know-what-men-think guru!
I still can't.When you're in the mood for a book to cheer you up, read Emma Chase.
When you're in the mood for a sweet yet hot love story, read Emma Chase.
Just read Emma Chase people!
Tangled, book with witty and sarcastic hero as narrator, is a MUST READ!
This insight into man's head and thinking is fascinating and a lot of fun.My Drew and Kate:SPOILER-FREE REVIEW:Drew Evans used to be always on the top of things, getting everything he wanted and enjoying life of a single good-looking bachelor.
Or was in not the flu that brought this strong man into this pathetic state?After short prologue, story is set four months earlier to the times when Drew is successful gentleman who is enjoying services of various willing ladies every time opportunity arises.
I don’t think there’s another like it in the English language that says so much while actually saying so little.How many wives have told their husbands, “I’m fine,” when they really mean, “I want to cut your balls off with a butcher knife”?How many men have told their girlfriends, “You look fine,” when they really mean, “You need to go back to the gym and work out – a lot.”Its just the universal way of saying we’re just peachy – when we’re really anything but.I really could keep adding quotes left, right and centre here, there are so many good ones…Well done, Drew!
★★★★★! Tangled, book 1. Debut by Emma Chase. A hilariously witty tale following a non-committal playboy man-whore in his descent into the oblivion after falling for a girl he can’t have.   “My stomach flips with regret and disappointment. What I wouldn’t give for a time machine.”   Books/BONUS chapters in the Tangled series should be read in (this) order:Book 1: TangledBook 1.1: Working Late/The Kiss – Best read after chapter 6 of book 1. PLUS Interview with Drew.Book 1.2: The Bitch Strikes Ba
Story is brilliantly told entirely from Drew’s POV and we get to follow him as he is thrown into what starts as an attempt at seducing a co-worker/sub-ordinate to a competition for an account and downhill from there…I could go on and on about how much I enjoyed reading and stayed up all night to finish it.
As a matter of fact don’t even bother reading any further just hurry up and get your copy.Thanks Ms. Chase for an entertaining , witty all-consuming read!If you are still reading this, not heeding my advice, I have included my thoughts on Drew and Kate below plus some quotes to give you an idea of the wonderfulness that is Drew, droll playboy man-whore extraordinaire!
5 Hilarious Stars! NEW BOOK BOYFRIEND ALERT : Drew frigging EvansWhy it took me so long to read this book is beyond me. If there's a guilty-pleasure New Adult book that is worth your attention, it's Tangled by Emma Chase. It's funny as hell and so addictive. Emma's writing was also so delicious you just can't get enough of it!The story centers around Drew Evans. It's told in his POV. Yes, guys. His and his POV alone. I don't normally encounter a romance book where the only one that speaks is the

If there's a guilty-pleasure New Adult book that is worth your attention, it's Tangled by Emma Chase.
Not. I learned a lot of things from Drew.
and so much more.What also entertained me most was Drew's set of analogies and comparisons that he added in almost everything that he narrated in this book, like:
Also, I didn't only admire Drew and Kate's characters but I also adored the secondary ones, especially Delores a.k.a. Deedee.
This was my first Emma Chase book and it certainly won't be the last.
With all of that being said Starting this book I originally felt as though I missed a female voice - yes I'm well aware that the male point of view was a selling point for the story and believe me I was sold too, so after a while I told myself to get over it and enjoy the Drew ride and i did!

I'll tell you darling this is bullshit!First of all, if you know me you'll know that i LOVE books with boy POV , meaning i read a lot of those, this one was THE WORST!!!And that is NOT a comedy!
NAAAH i have an excellent taste and this book is rubbish.Don't get me wrong, there are things that i liked, or i wouldn't give this two whole stars, for instance:The relationship between Drew Evans and his niece.
You know, there’s a fineline between love and hate, Drew.”“And didn’t Sally Jansen switch schools later that year because—”“Look, the point here, man, is that I liked the girl.
5+++++ HILARIOUS DEBUT STARS! Cheers for Emma Chase! This entire book, I was like laughing my ass off. Seriously, full on asthma attack here people! This book is detrimental to your health. It should come with a WARNING -if you've got respiratory issues, a weak heart, just had a baby, had recent surgery- it'll seriously rip you the hell open!  The stuff Drew would say.....

This entire book, I was like laughing my ass off.
She just discreetly turns him down.My entire review could be filled with Drew quotes.
I laughed throughout the entire book.
By the way, Drew's niece Mackenzie deserves a huge shout out!
She's Drew's little sweetheart.
At this rate, that thing is going to put Mackenzie through college.Then there's Drew's buddy Matthew and Kate's friend Dee Dee. Please please please give us their own book!-“Delores is a gorgeous name, for a gorgeous girl.
It'll be a struggle for sure......"I'm going to make you so happy Drew Evans." My arms tighten around her.
I will keep this short..RESISTANCE IS FUTILE...You need to read this book...You will love him and his mind...this was Earth shattering. Off the Richter Scale. This was so refreshing to read! I literally loved every sentence in this book! EVERY! The characters were amazing! Even though Kate got on my nerves later but I can let that slip away because Drew makes up for everything!You would say for him that he's an assh@le but to me he is not!He is EPIC!I swear to God I found the best fiction male

You sure about this?” Matthew smiles, and in his best Darth Vader voice tells me, “You don’t know the power of the Dark Side.”"I’ll never get tired of looking at her.
Try this: read chapters 1-5, skip to 12, then read the last 2 chapters. Do you think you missed anything? Well, there you have it.
You guys already posted great reviews!
So I'll keep it sweet and short.
It was  JUST WHAT I NEEDED  after Me Before You.Drew helped me to recover from my miserable self.
And well, he was feeling miserable too so I guess we both recovered together, how romantic!Drew is a womanizer who is happy with his life.
If you need a quick and funny read, then go for it and enjoy some advices from Drew and his lovely niece.
No guy talks to his friends about sex with his girlfriend.
He's sweet too.
Go buy and read this awesome book!
LOVE LOVE LOVED IT!!!!!!!!!!This was a much needed fun read and I must say Drew managed to talk about his penis on just about every damn page.
AMAZING RIGHT!LOL!Proving the male brain is constantly onHave you ever read a book and felt like the mc actually sat you down to fill you in on what’s happening in his or her life?
Because that is exactly how this book felt.
It was as if Drew sat me down and explained exactly how he lost his chance at love with Kate.In Tangled we read how Drew goes from thisTo thisWhen he should be doing this
Alright ladies, see that amazingly sexy guy over there? Yep, that's the one, the hot one getting a blow job in the bathroom of a super trendy clubMeet Drew Evans, God's gift to women!Drew is a smooth talking, sexy, successful, man slut. Did I also happen to mention that he's a grade-A asshole? No? Well that's ok, because he's an honest one. He just calls it like he sees it. For those ladies out there who are listening, let me give you some free advice: If a guy who you just met at a club calls y
For those ladies out there who are listening, let me give you some free advice: If a guy who you just met at a club calls you baby, sweetheart, angel, or any other generic endearment?
It’s because he can’t or doesn’t care to remember your actual name.
I’m looking for a good time—for one night—and I tell them so.
That is until one brown haired, brown eyed beauty turns you down at a club.Much to Drew's dismay, the gorgeous brunette that turns him down is actually Katherine Brooks, a new associate at his father's firm where Drew works.
Technically speaking, I didn’t meet Kate at work; I met her in a bar.
Oh, I see why romance novels are so rarely written from the point of view of the male love interest: because men are revolting, objectifying, self-centered, manipulative, potty-mouthed assholes.
The lawsuit-worthy sexual harassment she puts up with at work is probably realistic, if the opposite of romantic.
Nothing in this book was romantic to me.
Oh, but he loves his four-year-old niece* -- awwww.
*But not enough to refrain from having inappropriate and foul-mouthed sexual discussions in front of her.
“Women fall in love quicker than men.
Easier and more often.
But when guys fall?
We go down harder.
And when things go bad?
When it's not us who ends it?
We don't get to walk away.We crawl.” Okay, so I think I was the very last person of my friends to read this book...maybe the last in the world.
I thought that I wasn't in the mood for funny.
Boy was I wrong.I love an author who writes a story that I end up loving before I realize that I'm already halfway through the book.
Boy was I wrong.I love an author who writes a story that I end up loving before I realize that I'm already halfway through the book.
There's NOTHING so great in a romance book for me than watching a proud man fall to his knees over a woman.
Kate never tries to lure Drew in.
Which might not be such a bad thing in the end.
“It’s simple guy logic: If a woman is angry?
It means she cares.
She tries so hard not to fall for the playboy.
Drew and Kate are both heartbroken.
Too bad he's Kate's.
I swear!!Its like Drew is telling us a story and what's even more impressive is when we get thoughts in our heads, Drew answers the question!!!
It was funny, goofy, romantic and had some of the funniest analogy's I've ever read!!!Did I mention HOW MUCH I LOVED this??Drew is gorgeous, intelligent, rich and oh so sexy!Drew is a male Slut!
who you kidding Drew??"I don’t spar with Kate because I like her.
Five stars is NOT enough to give this book.
But, Kate is engaged to someone else, Billy.
And, Kate works at Drew's firm and he has a strict rule that he does not date his co-workers.
Drew has very colorful language, a hilarious way of expressing himself, most of which he says he learned in Catholic School.
The entire book was told from Drew's POV.
But, it was told in a different way than any other book I have read.
Thank you Emma Chase for making my day yesterday spent with Drew and Kate the most fun I've had in a long time.
Drew and Kate together are wonderful, sweet and HOT!!
But until then, check out this link for a scene from Kate's POV: (thanks to my lovely friend, D Kristin!)http://asainandwhitegirlbookblog.word...Want more Drew?
;) http://www.drewevans.net/Favorite quotes: (way too many to add them all!)♦ "I know, I know…I said I don’t ride the same coaster twice.
“Why do I have the feeling you’re not talking about the chocolate chip variety?”♦ "In times like this, I always ask myself, "What would William Wallace do?"♥ “So I said those things on purpose, so you would think you were nothing to me.
How I would describe this book:My emotions during this book varied between:By the the end I was left with a permanent grin on my face ♥Drew is simply...Kate..This book was refreshing in so many ways starting with the fact that it was COMPLETELY from a male POV. It was the perfect mix of humor and sexiness with sweet romance thrown in. Brilliant debut novel! 5++++ stars!!!!
***5 I CAN'T BREATHE, WIPING TEARS, STOMACH CRAMPING STARS***OMG! I am SO glad I decided to see what all the fuss was about with this book. I FREAKING LOVED IT! Being in Drew's head was absolutely FUN and HILARIOUS! IT IS A MUST READ!  “I’ve never seduced a woman before.Shocking, I know.Let me clarify. I’ve never had to seduce a woman before, not in the typical sense. Usually it just takes a look, a wink, a smile. A friendly greeting, maybe a drink or two. After that, the only verbal exchange in
He wants her bad and isn't unsettled by the fact that Kate is engaged because her body language is screaming that she is very much interested.
That’s not true either.++++++++++++++++++++“She looks like some mythical imp, some fabled pagan sex deity from a Roman legend.
I loved how he started to change and was falling for Kate.
The way he was trying to make her fall in love with him had me sighing and laughing all at once.
I even really liked Kate.
“If we’re going to work together, Drew, I think we should get a few things straight.
Find all of my reviews at: http://52bookminimum.blogspot.com/If you would have told me when I first started this that I would end up giving it 4 Stars, I would have assumed your mother had dropped you on your head multiple times when you were a small child. Mainly because the leading male and narrator Drew???? You learn right away that Drew’s heart has been broken by Katherine. Then he rewinds things to the beginning of the story where you learn that Katherine is a new associate at his company t
But Drew was so schmarmy that instead of Richard Gere he was giving off Jason Alexander vibes *shudder* So what happened?
(And probably the best idea possible to have her narrate NONE of the story so I didn’t end up wanting to punch her right in the babymaker for having a dipshit as an internal voice.)I ended up with Tangled when I went to the porny library site looking for Royally Screwed - which I wanted to read so I could imagine what it would be like to make all of the sexuals with a certain ginger .
