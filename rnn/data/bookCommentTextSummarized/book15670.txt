"Is this all we are? A necklace of chemicals? Where, in the double helix, does the soul lie?" Medical student or not, you will learn a lot from Tess Gerritsen's books with pure enjoyment. If you like your crime medicine strong, this will keep you gripped. Rizzoli & Isles is the perfect series! 😍4.5/5A series of horrific murders seem disturbingly familiar to Detective Jane Rizzoli. They remind her of those committed by a killer known as the Surgeon, who they recently put behind bars.While th
And "The Apprentice" is just as good!The only flaw was that the focus was completely on Warren Hoyt, AKA; the Surgeon (which I don't mind since I loved the first book and it still interests me), but I was disappointed that I didn't get to know the Dominator more nor read about his POV.It's gory, it's gripping, it's Gerritsen.
When she's called to a crime scene by another detective from a different squad, Rizzoli must face the horror all over again as she finds similarities to the Surgeon's work.Things are also compounded when an FBI agent inserts himself into the investigation.
Gabriel Dean isn't forthcoming with too many details as to why he's there and Jane must not only tackle her resurfacing demons but hold her own with her own team and the lead detective from the Newton squad.
Rizzoli is much more focused on the investigation and working with not only her team but the detective from the other squad and the mysterious Gabriel Dean.

You follow Hoyt & Apprentice relationship.Small notes - Rizzoli is only 115 pounds!
Detective Jane Rizzoli thought serial killer Warren Hoyt was safely locked away in prison and that she could move on.
She is also finding that even though Hoyt is safely locked away he has changed her.
In some ways he is still in her life.Now wealthy men are being killed and their wives have disappeared.
Why is the FBI involved and what else is there that they are not telling her.Every serial killer needs a nickname and in this case he has been dubbed The Dominator.
Later in the story Hoyt escapes from prison and The Surgeon and The Dominator team up.
A new serial killer has come to Boston and Detective Jane Rizzoli is called to the latest crime scene when there are similarities to a former case she worked on which resulted in the capture and arrest of Warren “The Surgeon” Hoyt.
Then Hoyt escapes and it seems he’s now joined forces with this new killer, The Dominator.This book was enjoyable enough, but disappointing as well.
Instead all the focus went to Warren Hoyt so much that I felt like I was reading The Surgeon again, and unfortunately, that book wasn’t a favorite of mine.
What I did like in this book was that Jane Rizzoli was front and center this time.
With the serial killer known as the Surgeon behind bars, Detective Jane Rizzoli can breathe easy and get on with her life. Or can she? When a murder victim is found with his wife clearly tortured and abducted, there is a chilling signature of the Surgeon's work and perhaps a hint that he is not entirely finished with Jane.A very creepy, thriller which manages to raise the tension to the max without a host of murders. An excellent follow up to The Surgeon and an introduction to forensic pathologist Maura Isles and FBI agent Gabriel Dean.
Well, this is only the second book that I have read in the series but they are so good!
This one wasn't as good as book one, I think the story was the reason why, but I did give book one 4.5 stars so its not that much of a step down.
If all crime novels were like this, I would definitely read more crime novels!I think Gerritsen is a terrific writer and storyteller.
The story was really good.
I don't know if Tess Gerritsen has more books outside of this series but if she does, I will definitely check them out too.
I read this one while traveling - it was a perfect plane read! Totally gripping and chilling. I wouldn't have thought I'd be a fan of medical thrillers, but I really enjoy Gerritsen's writing - it's addictive and fascinating, with lots of detailed medical references that make the story that much more authentic.
I'm a big fan of the Rizzoli & Isles tv show and with the fall hiatus, I decided to start reading the actual books.
Which is fine with me; her character doesn't appear much in this book, but she's interesting enough.The biggest change from the book is the plotline, which I was really pleasantly surprised about.
Same premise as the series pilot with Hoyt and stuff, but a totally different story.Definitely a solid book and I'm looking to reading more of them.
And to more Maura Isles.EDIT: as an addendum to this review, I'll mention that as the series goes on, the differences between it and the tv series are MAJORRRRR.
Awesome follow up to book 1, The Surgeon!
It's been a year since Jane put away the Surgeon.
Jane comes with a trunk full of damaged baggage, coming off as a little petty & whiny in book 1.
But in The Apprentice, we see a more focused Jane - stronger, tougher, less concerned with how male co-workers see her and more willing to work with the team.
A strong supporting cast adds even more intrigue to this book.
Chilling, horrifying, nonstop action kept me glued to the pages of The Apprentice.
Add to that the fact that some scenes are told from the point of view of Warren Hoyt aka The Surgeon .
This was a random selection for me, I needed a new audiobook for the car, and I needed a book whose title starts with an "A" for a reading challenge.
Check.I'm familiar with this series in the same way that I am familiar with the Kathy Reichs/Bones/Temperance Brennan series - I saw it on TV first.
At 90% complete, I started to worry that Gerritsen would make a horrible mistake and end the book in one rushed chapter.
And, in fact, it was the ending that made me bump it up from 3 stars to 4.
This is the second book by Tess Gerritsen that I've read. I must say this was as good or better than The Surgeon.I'm addicted to this series and I will be reading all of them.
The Apprentice is the first book I have read of Tess Gerritsen, and I was impressed with the way Tess Gerritsen portrays her characters especially Jane Rizzoli and Detective Korsak.
The ending of The Apprentice will surprise the readers, and in some cases, I think they will be pleased.Reading The Apprentice will help you understand some issues with Post Trauma Stress disorders for law enforcement.
Readers of The Apprentice will learn about the problems that the different law enforcement agency have with each other and way they rectify the issues.
Cerrah'daki heyecan aynı şekilde devam ediyor. Bütün programlarınızı iptal edip tamamen kitaba yoğunlaşacağınızdan eminim. .Kendinizi olayların içinde hatta çoğu zaman Rizollinin gergin ruh halinin içinde buluyorsunuz.
Evet kadroya İsles de katıldı. bakalım serinin devamında bizi ne maceralar bekliyor. bu arada gerritsenin bir katili tasvir etmesi, onun beyninin nasıl işlediğini anlatması falan harika😬
Bu yazarla tanışmayan çok şey kaybeder.
So, Jane Rizzoli gets the case and becomes the main protagonist of the story, which happens during all the series I guess, along with Maura Isles.All the events related to the investigation come to the surface around Rizzoli and, after reading this wonderful book, I have no doubt about my admiration for her, since I didn't like her so much when I read the first book.
Now, I'm definitely looking forward to read, in order, The Sinner (#3), which I technically got for birthday but haven't received yet.I still have to say that I didn't like the ending so much.
Kaip ir minėjau praėjusiame poste, detektyvai nėra mano mėgstamiausias žanras, nes dažnai čia vienas veiksmas veja kitą, žudomi ir žudomi žmonės, bet dažnu atveju veikėjai taip ir lieka nepažinti.
O man veikėjai ir jų istorijos yra svarbiausias akcentas knygose - iš jų pasiekimų ir klaidų, pokyčių ir stagnacijų aš mokausi ir semiuosi stiprybės, idėjų savo realiam pasauliui.
"Pameistrys" yra antroji mano skaitoma Tess Gerritsen knyga, tai yra detektyvo "Chirurgas" tęsinys.
Labai rekomenduoju šias knygas skaityti iš eilės, nes praleidus bent vieną dalį, daug siužeto prasmės yra prarandama.
Trumpai tariant, tai yra meistriškas detektyvas - dabar suprantu, kodėl visi taip myli šią autorę.
The serial killer known as the Surgeon is back to menace Boston Homicide Detective Jane Rizzoli, but Rizzoli is way too stubborn and angry to let him get away with that for long.The first book in this series really pissed me off.
But Rizzoli is coming into focus as a character and she's the only reason I gave this series another chance.I want to like Rizzoli.
Things aren't easy for her, and sometimes she makes them even harder just by being herself, but I feel like I know her and where she's coming from.
I like how easy Frost is with Jane, but he doesn't seem to be around much.Two stars.
It seems like Gerritsen is getting better at this?
Infact, as I write this I am half way through #8 in the series (never before have I read any single authors books back-to-back until now).The Apprentice is the moniker given to a new serial killer stalking wealthy couples in Boston, a killer who has a strikingly similar modus operandi to his predecessor, The Surgeon; in fact some of the details and clues that The Apprentice leaves behind were not even released to the public and, being the lead investigator on the case, Jane Rizzoli is having a horrid case of déjà-vu.
From my blogMy Review - 2 1/2 Not my cup of teaWhat a total let down, I cannot believe this was written by the same author, The Surgeon was almost perfection in my mind, so to get a total boring, what was the point follow up was beyond disappointing.
The disappointing part is when we get to see them together it is the last scene of book and in my opinion, one of the worst endings ever, seriously I read the book for that, sigh.
And the continued comparison of Rizzoli and The Surgeon as hunters, I didn't buy it.The Surgeon is such a great book, for those interested I highly recommend reading that one and skipping this in the series.
ein reread, der sich definitv gelohnt hat :)
5/5 MÜKEMMELDİ.Kitap o kadar akıcı ki,ne zaman elime aldım,ne Zaman bitirdim anlayamadım.Yine çok zekice kurgulanmış bir kitaptı.Tess yine hayal kırıklığına uğratmadı.Yazar tıp bilgisini sonuna kadar kullanmıştı bu arada kitapta.Ama yine de cerrah kadar ürkünç,rahatsız edici bir kitap değildi.Daha çok katilin psikolojik yönleri aktarılmıştı okuyucuya.Ve bu da benim çok hoşuma gitti.Karakterlere daha çok ısındım bu kitapla.Polisiye/gerilim seven herkese tavsiye ediyorum.
With the continuation of the Surgeons travesty’s and the introduction of the Dominator, this book has a lot going for it. We get the first sneak peak at Dr Maura Isles, and a continuation of the amazing Jane Rizzoli, badass kickass cop. Finished this book with the craving for more.
3.5 stars
We’re drawn to it, even though we know damn well it’ll burn us."First Sentence: Today I watched a man die.This is one of those series that you don't read one book directly after the other.
Or maybe it's just because we're dealing with the same killer, but for me there were to many things that were a copy of the previous book.I again struggled with the pacing and writing style not fully getting emerged into the story.
Today I just made myself sit down and finish it, otherwise it would not have happened.I'm in two minds about caring-on with the series.I like the characters and general story, but the execution just doesn't gel with me.
You’ve been warned.The only reason I checked this book out of the library is because I watched Rizzoli & Isles on TV and I enjoyed it.
This is the second book in the Rizzoli & Isles mystery series.
Rizzoli is a homicide detective who a year before heroically captured the serial killer dubbed The Surgeon.
However, there are certain aspects of the crime scene that lead her to believe that a new killer has taken The Surgeon’s signature and modified it for his own use.When the body of the wife is found, a mysterious FBI agent named Dean appears and she’s ordered to work with him.
I loved this one. ( Read Further.) Maybe she has some more like this. Listened on Audio and did not want to stop. Suspense and story line would have given it a 5, but the "romance" is what always dull the book for me. I do know many readers like that, but I am straight suspense girls and that is why I do not read books by certain authors-though- popular that often. If it was not for that, I would be adding it to my "top books" shelf for the year, but that ruined doing that.
OMG another from Ms. Gerritsen, and what a book it is.First off, it's second in a series which is hard-hitting, full of forensic and medical detail, and characters you are gonna love, hate, then love again.
It's the detail which fascinates and though there are other series with a great deal of forensic science, (including a few authors I don't read, just don't care for their style), Gerritsen only tells it like it is when one of the characters needs to know what it is.I read standard mysteries, cozy mysteries, and those with a whiff of the preternatural about them.
You didn't have time to back your mother a cake?' Um no, mom, not in the middle of an exhausting hunt for a serial killer who targets young couples.
Another great read by Tess Gerritson. Not for the faint hearted. Crime scenes are very descriptive and just the way I like it. If you like a gutsy crime serial killer read, well I advise you to get stuck into this book. If you haven't read book one The Surgeon, I highly advise you start with this book first.
