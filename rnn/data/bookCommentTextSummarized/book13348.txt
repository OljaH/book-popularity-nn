Lesson from this book: Kids are annoying and will get you killed.Ok I’m slightly exaggerating but have you noticed how frustrating children characters are during a crisis?
I’m sure they would be during the apocalypse or when being tracked by dinosaurs but I wanted to throw my phone at the wall a few times while reading this book.With that said, I now have a new completely reasonable phobia, being eaten alive by a dinosaur.Crichton did an amazing job at keeping me on my toes and stressed AF!
I was afraid it wouldn't live up to the movie since I remember being traumatized by it as a kid but it totally did!Worth the read!
This is one of my favorite books of all time!!! I was way excited back then, 20 years ago, about the movie (minus the controversial scene portraiting San José, Costa Rica with a beach in the middle of it). Trust me. I am from Costa Rica and I live precisely in San José and we don't have a dang beach around.I am sure that Spielberg wouldn't do that kind of mistake if he'd need to portrait Paris, France, but a dang capital city in a third world country? Who cares?Well, I care, I am from that prec
I am from Costa Rica and I live precisely in San José and we don't have a dang beach around.I am sure that Spielberg wouldn't do that kind of mistake if he'd need to portrait Paris, France, but a dang capital city in a third world country?
I love the movie and I am fan of Spielberg's work, just pointing out my feeling about that scene that even in the book happens in another different place).I love the book, since the author, Michael Crichton, lived a lot of time in my country, Costa Rica, and he fell in love so much with our culture and geography that he wanted to use it as background for one of his novels.The novel became his most famous book.
Rereading for obvious reasons. :D :D :D :D
“Life breaks free. Life expands to new territories. Painfully, perhaps even dangerously. But life finds a way.”    Jurassic Park has all the major problems of a theme park, a zoo...and genetically altered prehistoric animals. That's right - the dinosaurs are back from the dead and nothing - I repeat nothing - could go wrong...right? Ha.  As my favorite character, Ian Malcom would say,  All major changes are like death. You can't see to the other side until you are there.  Though, considering so
Though, considering some of the problems they had with the park, I strongly believe that several of issues could've been predicted...that is, if Mr. Hammond and his scientists would've taken the time to thoroughly consider implications and consequences  of bringing back extinct species.
Dr. Allen Grant, Ellie, Ian Malcom and a host of other professionals (along with Mr. Hammond's grandchildren) are invited to the island to give their expert opinion  on this un-extinction.Of course, this visit comes at an excellent time - there is a huge storm rolling in, the raptors are getting restless and there's some evidence that the smaller dinos have made it off the island.

to Jurassic Park's reviewI remember back when I was a kid, my dad rented a VHS (yes, the legendary VHS was real, young ones) cassette of an English movie.
The unique voice in this story belongs to Ian Malcolm who spends most of the time warning others about the park.So everyone went ahead with the tour and...Well, let's just say things didn't go as planned.
Throughout the story, you'll be likeOverall, Jurassic Park is one helluva a ride.
Sure it's packed with Michael Crichton's usual band of screenplay-adaptation-friendly archetypes, sure it derives much of its plot and thought from Arthur Conan Doyle, HG Wells and Mary Shelley, sure it's pulpy and quick to read, but those things aren't necessarily bad, and Crichton does enough to elevate or alter these elements to make Jurassic Park a fine piece of popular Sci-Fi in its own right.
later --  It just struck me that if I forget the quality of this book between readings, and I do, then my prophecy concerning Jurassic Park's staying power is probably flawed.

Yes, it is super science-y and yes, dinosaurs still aren’t free-ranging on an island off the shores of Costa Rica, but it doesn't change the fact that this book is phenomenal.
In fact, after reading Jurassic Park I questioned why some parts of the original were ever changed for the film at all.
Jurassic Park, the book, is inimitable, apart from a few clumsy attempts.
He knows that the action in this book will go only so far, just like last acts in an all out comedy movie WILL be lame, unless something rash and daring is undertook.
The ultimate slap in the face of conventional science fiction is the fact, that Jurassic Park takes place in our timeline.
The book is now half forgotten, but that will change when the next wave of genetic manipulation arrives.
Jurassic Park can have quite a few interpretations that pertain to civics, science, philosophy, and of course maths' sexy cousin, Chaos Theory!
Hey, did y'all know they made a movie out of this one?
I wasn't loving the book anyway, and kept finding random factual errors (passports not needed for international travel?
You get them out of the field and into the lab, where you have air scribes, microscopes, safe places to rest them, and far more tools than you can schlep on your back out to the field.2) "bits of bone flaked away as he dug." Then he's an incompetent idiot.
Plenty of fossils remain only partially exposed in museums trays because they are too friable to clean further.
Broken bones get collected, cleaned, and curated.
Museum collections are mostly of fossils that are partial.
I love, love, love the amount of research put into the science. As a bio nerd, I love that it built off possibilities and expanded into something intense and thrilling.But the characters were a little one-dimensional? Like they just existed to push the plot forward? And maybe it’s just because the movie handles tension SO well... this didn’t seem to? (You don’t have to stop and explain the science WHILE the Raptors are attacking, mkay?)——————- It’s possible I procrastinated reading this for my monthly bookclub and need to binge-read it before the wine-mom’s judge me
Science-at-the-brink-of-chaos fiction. Nonlinear dynamics had barely been invented, and yet here it was, gracing each chapter with a foreboding message of disintegration.Not literature, not amazing prose, but a true edge-of-your-seat thriller.
Crichton demonstrates his accomplished talent for story telling and though this is my first of his novels (and so I have no basis for comparison), this will not be my last.While Alan Grant is the thematic and contextual protagonist – the paleontologist dropped off on an island teaming with REAL LIVE DINOSAURS!!
– Crichton uses the rock star cool, black dressed, philosophical chaos theory mathematician Ian Malcolm as its spiritual guide for what this book says once the adrenaline has run out.
Clearly, Crichton had a message to impart and showed impressive virtuosity in how to deliver.
DNF. The movie is better.
He knows so much more about them than I do, in fact his favorite is the Giganotosaurus, a dinosaur I learned existed from him.(the hipster's T-Rex)Now, I'll be the first to admit my memory of of the movie is a tad hazy, but from what I do remember, the movie actually follows the book quite a bit, at least up until about 2/3 of the book where either my memory is bad or the books is completely different (oh and Grant loves kids in the book, which is ...
The Kindle (25th Anniversary) edition is currently uber cheap: $0.64 in the States, £0.49p in the UK and $2.99 in Canada. I read the hardcover copy, about two decades ago - and if I was able to rate it at that juncture, I would have given it 4★
i haven't read this book in a long, long time, but i STILL managed a fine readalike list for it over on riffle, in what be my very last riffle list ever. ):http://www.rifflebooks.com/list/25772...
Jurassic Park has grown beyond Crichton's novel, into a movie, into a theme park attraction, into a thousand types of paraphernalia...
In fact, it has become so popular that we forget the original work this concept came from.I saw the movie first.
The book is nothing like that.This novel is a serious work of science fiction.
As with Crichton's other novels, the research is so detailed and the setting so well wrought that we are sometimes conned into believing that we are reading truth and not fiction.
Have we grown sufficiently as a species to do it safely?
I watched the movie adaptation when I was a kid, so I can't really remember much of the plot other than dinosaurs gone wild, and I'm sure I remember an elevator scene.
I had two reasons why I finally picked this up, and one of them would be that it's a Crichton novel for pete's sake.
The other reason would be that I heard they're making a new movie adaptation, so I wanted to freshen up my knowledge of this one.The characters were really likeable, just like the ones from Crichton's other novels.
It was impossible to put down, and even when I already knew the story, I found myself wondering what was going to happen next and how the characters would solve their problems, and that’s an important factor in a book.I liked most of the cast.
Ugh. I hate children.There was another thing that bothered me too in the book, and it is that Jurassic Park delivers the message that science (and therefore scientists) are evil – that all are scientists are arrogant and believe themselves gods and that they do what they do only for money.That’s arguably right sometimes, but I hate when people generalise things.
I was a little hesitant to read this book because I have such an immense love and appreciation for the movies.
But I'm glad to say that I think I may have enjoyed the book MORE than the movies!
I think that's probably why the movie was so great, they had such a GREAT story to base themselves on!
And I think that even if I hadn't seen the movie and loved it so much, I still could have pictured the story in my head like a movie because the writing is just that phenomenal!
Many of the reviews stated that there are pretty noticeable differences between the novel and the movie.
In the movie, he comes across as this overgrown child full of wonder whereas in the book, he’s this arrogant, egotistical man seemingly without compassion.
Jurassic Park is a story that is so visual that nothing in the novel could compare to seeing a dinosaur come to life before your eyes on the big screen.
I would stay away from it if you intend to read the novel as it’s basically spoilers.I’ll close by saying if you've only ever seen the movie, you NEED to read this book.
It's freakin' Jurassic Park! What else is there to say? The guy who reads this does a good job. I give him and the book 5 stars. Story *****Audiobook *****

Ναι, γνωρίζω πως ανά πάσα στιγμή θα μπορούσαν να ρουφήξουν τους χυμούς μου κουνούπια με μέγεθος πελεκάνου, ώστε να ικανοποιήσουν τη δίψα τους ή να κολλήσω στο τεράστιο πέλμα ενός Βραχιόσαυρου.

Σίγουρα ένα μέρος το οποίο θα ήθελα να μεταφερθώ έστω και για λίγο, είναι ο κόσμος του Jurassic Park που έχτισε ο Michael Crichton.
Δεινόσαυροι φίλε, δεινόσαυροι.Όπως και να΄χει, έναν ήρεμο καφέ στο πάρκο, καθισμένος σταυροπόδι, θα προλάβαινα να τον πάρω.Καταπληκτικό βιβλίο που περνά ουσιώδη μηνύματα σχετικά με την αλαζονεία του ανθρώπινου είδους και την ανεξέλεγκτη παρέμβαση του στη φύση.
Οι ήρωές μας πληρώνουν το τίμημα της απληστίας τους, στην προσπάθειά τους να το παίξουν θεοί στη θέση του θεού.Να μη ξεχάσω να αναφέρω ότι ο συγγραφέας για άλλη μια φορά έχει κάνει απίστευτη έρευνα πριν γράψει το οτιδήποτε μέσα στο βιβλίο.
This book is the perfect blend of reality and imagination.
I applaud Michael Crichton- this concept is solid as well as reasonable.
This book includes all of the character's perspectives, which I find a little confusing at times, but does an awesome job of telling the story.
There is equality of all types, as there are two strong female characters, and the book takes place on an island near Costa Rica.
The only thing is that this book includes lots of gore, people and animals dying, and a single sexual reference necessary for the storyline.
Like many, I loved the film, and indeed its sequels.
I hadn’t however read the book that started it all...Going through the pages, I couldn’t help trying to find the scenes that I knew so well.
What fun to hear Malcolm’s Chaos theories and witness Grant’s survival!This is a compelling thriller with a brilliant theme but somehow, having been so immersed in the movies, it lessened the awe inspiring moments.
I do wonder how it would have felt to read this knowing nothing - much more powerful for sure.
At least in the film, they balanced that out!To recap, great adventure with thrilling moments.
Your life starts to flash before your eyes.Then, out of nowhere, some asshole decides to babble on about the chaos theory, which at first seems interesting but then after a few pages you're just rooting that some dinosaur, any dinosaur would kill the smart-ass Ian Malcolm.
I found his endless babble about chaos and unpredictability to be quite a party-pooper, just when you're getting some inch of excitement he's gonna want to talk again.
RAWWWWWWWWWWWWRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR!There, much better.
- I was really annoyed that they messed up Lex's character in the movie.
She was my favorite character in the book, and the movie guys screwed her up.
«Ξέρεις, πόσο απίθανο είναι να φύγεις εσύ ή οποιοσδήποτε από εμάς ζωντανός απ’ αυτό το νησί;»Κλασικός απολαυστικός Crihton, ο οποίος μας έχει συνηθίσει στο να συνδυάζει, τις επιστημονικές πληροφορίες, την άκρατη περιπέτεια και δράση και τα γεμάτα στοχασμό νοήματα, τα οποία συνήθως έχουν να κάνουν με την υπερβολή της επιστήμης και την αυτοκαταστροφική τάση του δυτικού πολιτισμού.«Η επιστήμη πάντα έλεγε ότι μπορεί να μην ξέρει τώρα τι κάνει αλλά τελικά θα το μάθει.
Σήμερα βλέπουμε ότι αυτό δεν είναι αλήθεια.
Είναι ένας ηλίθιος κομπασμός, εξίσου ανόητος και λανθασμένος με την πίστη ενός παιδιού που πηδάει από ένα κτίριο γιατί πιστεύει ότι μπορεί να πετάξει.»
Where as the Movie Hammond experienced some humility by the end, it seemed like Book Hammond had a restraining order out against that emotion.
He isn't caught up in the grand vision of Hammond and treats the park problems as things that will occur as a matter of course and that can be fixed.Wu, the brilliant scientist behind the miracle of resurrected dinosaurs, views things through a highly scientific lens.
This really gave the book a very nice bit of depth beyond "Amusement Park Tries to Kill its Guests." Where as the movie was very much about surviving dino related deaths, the book took time to explore different views on the park and serve as a cautionary tale about pushing the boundaries of science too quickly.
