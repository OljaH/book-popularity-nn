Being one of those individuals to whom math came so easily that they couldn't grasp how difficult others found it, the professor had no idea what to cover in such a course.
Next week, he was back."What should I teach them now?" he said.A Brief History of Time is like that -- Professor Hawking doesn't seem to notice when his treatment progresses from the obvious to the arcane, ending with his concept of "imaginary time" (very nearly incomprehensible in this overly brief presentation).Fun nonetheless.
Obviously he is entitled to think as he wishes about the ultimate questions, but his assertion that his hypothesis of a finite world without beginning or end would leave no place for God seems beside the point.
And so that is why I ultimately cannot recommend this book: if you know physics inside and out, you might find his opinions interesting.
"والواقع أننا قد أعدنا تحديد مهمة العلم لتصبح اكتشاف القوانين التي تمكننا من التنبؤ بالأحداث في الحدود التي يفرضها مبدأ عدم اليقين" بدأ ستيفن هوكينج, وهو عالم في الفيزياء النظرية, في كتابة هذا الكتاب في الفترة التي كان مازال يستطيع فيها أن يستخدم صوته وهو شبه مشلول على كرسيه المتحرك, ثم وبعد فترة, وقبل أن يكمل الكتاب, خضع لجراحة شقت فيها حنجرته, ليذهب صوته وهو الشيء الوحيد الذي كان يتواصل به مع العالم آنذاكظن في البداية أنه لن يستطيع إكمال الكتاب, ولكن أحد طلبته "بريان هويت" قام بمساعدته, ليس فق

Isn't it amazing that a person can read a book like A Brief History of Time by Stephen Hawking and come away feeling both smarter and dumber than before he started?
Pssh, whatever." But that's not his take at all, or at least that not the impression this book left me with.A Brief History of Time was written with accessibility in mind, knowing full well idiots like me wouldn't buy it, read it or recommend it if it were impossibly dense.
Things I learnt from Stephen Hawking11 October 2014 Ever since I took up physics in year 11 I have had a love affair with the subject, which is odd since I went on to study an arts/law degree (but that probably had something to do with the fact that I would not have had the staying power to pour all of my energy into helping human knowledge advance towards establishing a unified theory). I still wonder where I ended up getting this book, and it had been sitting on my shelf for quite a while (pro
In fact his final sentence in this book is that the reason we study physics and try to find a unified theory is because we, as a race, seek to understand the mind of God.2) Stephen Hawkings is actually a really good writer	This probably goes without saying, especially since the cover of my book says that it is a 'record breaking best seller'.
A Brief History of Time: From the Big Bang to Black HolesWhat is it that our eyes do that could possibly affect things?
Stephen HawkingA Brief History of Time: From the Big Bang to Black Holes is a popular-science book on cosmology (the study of the universe) by British physicist Stephen Hawking.
هاوکینگ در این کتاب با زبانی ساده به بازگویی داستان جهان پرداخته است.
توصيه مى كنم كسانى كه تازه مى خوان مطالعات كيهان شناسى رو شروع كنن، قبل از اين كتاب اون مستند رو ببينن.Into the Universe With Stephen Hawkingنکات منفیمشکل اصلی کتاب، اینه گاهی زبانش خیلی فیزیکی میشه.
میشه فهمید چرا.نکات مثبتاما جاهایی که دانش ناقص فیزیکم یاری میکرد یا خود کتاب ساده بود، خیلی خیلی عالی بود کتاب.
مثلاً میگفت این نظریه در فلان تاریخ مطرح شد، در اون زمان من با دختری آشنا شده بودم و میخواستم باهاش ازدواج کنم و شروع میکنه ماجرای خودش رو تعریف کردن.کتاب بعدی از این نویسنده، "کیهان در پوست گردو" هستش که قصد دارم به زودی بخرم.
مع انى دارس هندسه فراغية و هندسة وصفية و مساحة جيوديسيه و رياضه بحته و تطبيقية و فيزياء عامه و ثيرمو
“The universe doesn't allow perfection.” ― Stephen Hawking, A Brief History of TimeI know.
Somehow Stephen Hawking has written a book that gently fluffs the tail on Schrödinger's cat (or perhaps Schrödinger's cat is fluffing Dr. Hawking).
Look, no doubt the guy is a genius and has a fantastic story (ALS, computer voice, nurses, Black Holes, strippers, movies, etc).
Let someone else write a pop-GUT/Blackhole/Big Bang story.
Let another writer do the pop-up Children's book with the scratch-n-sniff singularity, the rotating black hole, the pull-out universe.
Let Bill Bryson write the summary science.
Apparently this book tops the world list of "bought but not read", which may explain why it's so universally acclaimed as a work of genius. If you know anything much about relativity or cosmology, it comes across as a potboiler, admittedly a well-written one with a great final sentence. I wasn't impressed.But... without it, we would never have had MC Hawking. If you haven't come across him, start with the lyrics to "E = MC Hawking". Then buy A Brief History of Rhyme.
He also states that this limits the powers of God himself.
If God is so powerful as to have created the universe and all the physical laws, why wouldn't he be powerful enough to change those laws any time he chooses?
The scientist can, at any time during the simulation, alter the underlying framework of the simulation, effectively changing the physical laws that simulated universe operates under.Now, whether you believe in God or not, the mere fact that Hawking has the audacity to think he can assign limits on a limitless being should cause you some concern.
Well, I'm proud to say that I bought and read it, that too in nearly one sitting - back in my geeky days, when I used to get a sexual high just from solving a hard maths puzzle.Unfortunately, I don't remember much of it (time for a re-read!) but I remember taking away the idea that time is a sphere.
Being Indian, I loved this - because we are strong champions of cyclical time.
Also, if time and space are both curved, it creates the possibility of jumping from one place and time to another; which is just delicious.(I bought a pirated edition of this book for 25 rupees from the roadside at Connaught Place in New Delhi.
"Time" was on my side.)
لكن هذا لا يمنع أن معظم العلماء تقبلوا ميكانيكا الكم، يقول هوكينج: "ليس لدينا بعد نظرية متماسكة كاملة توحِّد النسبية العامة وميكانيكا الكم، ولكننا نعرف بالفعل عددًا من الملامح التي ينبغي أن تكون فيها"ويفصِّل الكاتب الحديث عن ميكانيكا الكم، فيتناول الجسيمات الأولية وقوى الطبيعة الأربعة.ثم ينتقل للحديث عن الثقوب السوداء وهي جد شيقة، وفي هذا الجزء يستفيض هوكينج في الشرح والتحليل في كل ما يختص بالثقوب السوداء، وربما هذا لأنه كان مهتمًا بشكل كبير بها واكتشف بعض الأشياء حولها.في أحد الفصول بعنوان: أصل ومصير الكون، وهو فصل مميز للغاية، وإن رأيته منفصل عن الكتاب بإعادته جزء بسيط باختصار مما قاله قبل هذا مع توضيح وتناول بعض الأشياء الجانبية، وفي هذا الفصل مناقشة بشكل أكبر للخالق، وإن توصل في النهاية إلى عدم نفي أو إثبات أي شيء، فكما هو الأمر في الفلسفة الإمر قائم على احتمالات لا يمكننا معرفة أيهما أصح، وعلى هذا أيضًا سينتهي الكتاب.
The main idea to take away from this book is that time has a clear direction.
Hawking uses this idea to explain why travelling back in time is impossible.
It would be impossible - and that impossibility is what gives time its clear direction.Philosophically, I tend to feel that the book makes far too much of the Uncertainty Principle.
But that is another story.This isn't the easiest book to read in the world and is probably the most bought science book of all time while also being the one most likely gave up on after a chapter or two - but it is a fascinating read all the same.
Es cierto que Hawking cumple su promesa de no incluir ni una fórmula matemática (excepto la conocida fórmula sobre la teoría de la relativdad E=MC²) pero los conceptos en sí pueden ser difíciles de imaginar y comprender.
De toda la información que Hawking intenta explicar en este libro, ha habido cosas que notaba que se me escapaban.
Quizá con algo más de material gráfico habría resultado más sencillo.Aún así, el concepto general de los temas que trata es impresionante si te apasiona conocer la esencia del universo.
Realmente había momentos en los que dejaba de leer para procesar algunos conceptos y no podía menos de maravillarme.
If you're into stuff like this, you can read the full review.On Horse-Flies: "A Brief History of Time" by Stephen Hawking(Original Review, 1987)Will having read Hawking's book help me understand the way a horse-fly "grasps" the arrow of time?For starters, I'm great at killing horse-flies by hand. Should I get some black pyjamas and a balaclava and become a ninja? And there was me thinking that the horse-fly's all round vision and short nerve pathway had something to do with their reaction speed. Being a horse-fly-killing-ninja, what do I need Hawking’s book for? Move aside Hawking!
stephen hawking has always been my favorite person on this planet and his recent passing has finally inspired me - after years and years of putting it off - to pick up his most famous work. i‘m excited to learn more about space, the love of my life. rest in peace, stephen hawking. what an honor to have lived at the same place and time as you. 💫
Without a doubt a masterpiece!It's just incredible how Hawking explains to us the complex and mindboggling secrets and concepts of physics and our universe, with amazing wit , clarity, and simplicity.The questions that we all used to ask to ourselves and to our parents, about god, about time, life and it's meaning, the sky, stars, about who created our universe and about it's beginning, about our fate......we had that unique quality called curiosity when we were children, but then, as we grew up , we somehow lost that ability to ask and question, we no longer felt the same thirst for knowledge and a deeper understanding of things as we reached adulthood, those questions we abandoned as our busy lives got in our way..
Ένα πολύ ωραίο βιβλίο εκλαϊκευμένης επιστήμης που εξηγεί βασικές έννοιες της Φυσικής και πώς αυτές διαμορφώθηκαν ανα τους αιώνες - με κύρια κατεύθυνση στην μοντέρνα Φυσική που για πολλούς είναι ακατανόητη. Μου άρεσε πολύ ο τρόπος γραφής και το χιούμορ του Χώκινγκ αλλά θεωρώ πως κάποιος πρέπει να έχει κάποιες σχετικά γερές βάσεις Φυσικής για να το κατανοήσει. Θέλω πολύ να ξαναδιαβάσω τα κεφάλαια για την θεωρία των χορδών και τις μαύρες τρύπες γιατί νομίζω πως πολλά πράγματα τα έχασα. :(
لكنها ليست الحقيقة، فلست ذكيا ولا رائعا، وإنما قارئ متوسط الاستيعاب، أشعر بحكة في دماغي عندما تتعقد الأمور وتطقطق جمجمتي من الداخل إذ يحاول مخي الصغير أن يتمدد ليستوعب بعض المعلومات، ولكنه لا ينجح دائما.ليس هذا دأبي مع كل الكتب التي تناقش موضوعات علمية، فقد مضيت في كتاب الكون لكارل ساجان من الغلاف إلى الغلاف دون أي عسر.
هذا إلى جانب الجانب التأملي في تاريخ العلم وتطور الفكر لدى الإنسان والتحدي الكبير المتمثل في مواجهة التيار التقليدي الذي يتصدى لأغلب الأفكار الجديدة.كتاب يستحق القراءة، مع الكثير من الصبر لأصحاب الميول الأدبية الذين اعتادوا على النوم أو العبث في آذانهم في حصص الفيزياء.
In every chapter came a point where my brain couldn't hold another permutation of a theory, and as the book progressed, I ended up taking the same approach as I do when reading a Norse saga for the first time.
With sagas, I just read, even if my brain doesn't seem to retain all the information about who is related to who and what they named their horse.
Inevitably, at the end, I have a reasonable basic grasp of the saga, and then I have to read it over again to fit more information into that basic understanding.I don't know if the same will hold true here, but it's a nice hope.
I love the way Hawking explains concepts so abstract and difficult to understand as time or black holes.
It's a science book for the general public; you don't need to know math or physics to understand the amazing concepts about the Universe he tries to explain us.
I totally recommend A Brief History Of Time to everyone, not only the lovers of science.Spanish version:Éste es sin duda uno de mis libros favoritos de ciencia y mi favorito de Stephen Hawking.
Lo recomiendo a todo el mundo, no solo a los amantes de la ciencia.
A classic text where the amazing Stephen Hawking explains string theory and quantum mechanics "for dummies." Highly readable and even comical, it is a superb read. I need to go back and read this one again myself!
لا يمكن ان تحتوي نفس المجرة على المادة و مضاد المادة او ما يعني البروتونوات و النيترونات و مضاد البروتونات و مضادات النيترونات لان ذلك سيؤدي الى تولد اشعاع كبير و عالي من الطاقة في الحدود التي بين الماة و مضاد المادة حيث سيفني بعضها الاخر نتيجة لاصطدام جسيمات كثيرة مع مضادها...اذن المجرات اما تتألف من المادة او من مضاد المادة و لا يجوز كلاهماو الراجح انها كلها تتألف من مواد13- ينكمش النجم و يقل نصف قطره الى نصف قطر حرج معين فيصبح مجال الجاذبية عند سطحه قوي جدا بحيث بتنحني مخروطات الضوء الى الداخل و لا يستطيع الضوء الفرار من النجم و الوصول الى الراصد بالتليسكوب او غيره ..
I can see Astronomy is where everything learned since the Ancient Greeks, but especially from the discoveries of Galileo Galilei, Isaac Newton and Albert Einstein, has been like adding cars to a train engine, delivering more and more understanding about the size of the universe, its age, its chemistry and its elements, and how stars and galaxies came into being from a variety of small elemental particles responding to forces; all of which shockingly behave in a manner which can be mathematically described and reproduced.Sadly, I understood only half of the book despite reading it cover to cover and studying the included illustrations, and referring again and again to the included glossary and index in back.
هذا الكتاب الوحيد الذي قمت بقراءته للتباهي بقراءته لاني لم افهم منه كلمة واحدة
But don't ask me to explain it now.The book explains in lay terms what several decades ago was only understood by a handful of people.
He appears to have escaped the vast egos that led the likes of Isaac Newton to discredit their rivals, and gives credit to the work of others where due.
At a time when more information is available to more people than ever before, reading a book like this reminds you that understanding still requires effort, and that passive access to information is of only relative worth by itself.
One of most famous and well written books on Physics. Recommended to the Science enthusiasts.
Stephen Hawking has reaffirmed my understanding that the earth sits on the shell of a tortoise and that it is, indeed, turtles all the way down.Jolly good show though, chap!
