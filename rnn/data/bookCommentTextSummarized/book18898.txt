Smith does a great job of playing off the human nature of being in a bad spot and wondering how you got there only to have the sickening realization that you knew for a while that you heading into trouble, but you somehow talked yourself into staying the course it with the assumption that everything would work itself out.The characters themselves are a departure from what you get in most horror novels these days.
(hide spoiler)] So there’s this uncomfortable push-pull between the traditional concept of doing every single desperate thing you can think of to survive versus realizing that you’re fucked and just giving up.
Stephen King has a short story (that I believe may have been entitled "The Raft") in which four college students head out to an old rock quarry.
One of the students dives into the lake for a post-coital swim and is mysteriously and grotesquely devoured by the oil patch, his skin pretty much being stripped right from its bones.
I was reminded of Stephen King in general as I read this book.
The only real difference between this novel and the novels of Stephen King is that this book has a better ending.
Part of it is probably that it straddles the line between horror and thriller, stymying people who like to be able to slap a convenient label on things.
Sure, I wanted to slap them around from the moment they decided it was a good idea to go for a romp in the Mexican jungle all the way until the end but that's how horror stories of this type go sometimes.Eric's self-mutilation was one of the creepier parts of the book, made creepier at the end when it turned out he actually had vines inside him.
I’ve always had this conception that the horror genre, be it books or movies, are meant to be scary.
While reading Scott Smith’s The Ruins, it occurred to me that my concept of horror is wrong, or at least strikingly narrow.
That movie is not the one based on The Ruins, because there is no place for Billy Bob Thornton among young, attractive vacationers getting themselves into a situation.
Smith grounds things so well in reality that I readily accepted the gradual ratcheting of the horror elements.There are passages in The Ruins that are among the most brutal and graphic things I have ever read.
Once I got to the point in the book where it's clear the characters are stuck on the mountain, I thought, "I sure hope the next 400 pages aren't spent just detailing how these people die.
I found the book frustrating because the characters briefly seem to be going in this direction, mentioning how the Mayans have contained the plant and guessing at why they continue to hold people captive here.
If you are looking for some genuine thrills and chills this Halloween season, this may be the book for you.
I just don't get the storm of criticism aimed at Scott Smith's second novel, The Ruins.
The vine is merely a plot device to trap the college kids in the jungle and force them to confront (and attempt to survive) a series of terrible events.So it's not high brow literature or anything but it is a visceral, visual novel filled with moments of genuine terror.
The situation becomes a fascinating microstudy of human behavior -- "the group in peril" scenario we've seen before in classic stories like Golding's Lord of the Flies, Saramago's Blindness, or Stephen King's novella "The Mist".
Scott Smith's The Ruins is one of the best horror novels I've read in some time.
The most common complaints are that the characters were unlikable, that there were no lofty themes or messages in the story, and that the nature of the threat the characters face in the Mayan ruins where most of the book takes place was impossible to take seriously.I didn't find the characters at all unlikable.
I, for one, found it disturbing for a number of reasons.If you're able to read The Ruins and tell yourself, "This could never happen," then you'll probably hate it.
Enough said.
Requires a decent suspension of disbelief, but it's absolutely propulsive. No one plots better than Scott Smith when it comes to events spiraling out of control, and the writing is clean and full of drive. Very well-done.
If you plan to read it, stop here, because I'm about to take a stroll through it.Reading The Ruins as a writer, got through the first 75 pages and asked myself how this writer managed to get me to follow these people into the jungle when I didn't particularly like any of them.The Ruins is about four recent college grads on vacation in Cancun, who go off on an adventure to help an acquaintance find his brother.
The college grads are comprised of two American couples, Eric and Stacy and Jeff and Amy. Although they have distinct personalities, none of them stands out as a person I would follow on a day trip away from the beach.
It'd been a while since I read a book that horrified, sickened, and amazed me in equal measure; The Ruins did all those things with ease.
I was shocked at just how much I loved this novel.
The characters are mostly unlikable and infuriating, and I must admit I had trouble reading about them at first, but that's the point — being trapped in the jungle and fighting for one's life brings out the very worst in a person.This is a brutal, agonizing read.
I'm going to keep this one short and sweet: I really loved The Ruins.
In fact, it's probably in my top five horror novels — it's that damn good.
The power of syntax and lexicoAnd it's just a mindfuck, hail！the hardcover edition received, HELLYEAHlife is ephemeral, many books in ours just can't get the chance of being read twice, but absolutely not for this book \m/
The buzz is that this is an extremely graphic novel so I have put off reading it for several years. Now that I have read it, or listened to it actually, I'm not going to disagree with the buzz but I am going to say that this was easily one of the best horror novels I've ever read. I wouldn't change a thing about it.
The blood and guts sequences are treated with the clinical detachment of a surgeon: that’s to say, it’s pretty bloody but isn’t all that messy.
I kept imagining myself or a loved one in a situation like this.[He] had the urge to vomit, his tongue going thick, bile rising in his throat.While I didn’t particularly care much for any of the characters, I found The Ruins to be a fairly tense, visceral read.
But, to be clear, don’t expect too many character dimensions here.She didn’t like the rustling sounds.
All in all, it was actually pretty good.
It wasn’t quite what I expected, but this is perhaps a good thing.
All the characters were either assholes or idiots."And this is the truth.What would happen if a bunch of idiots/assholes vacationed in Cancun and stupidly went into the jungle looking for a stranger's lost brother without proper attire, supplies or even at the very BASIC LEVEL, a way to get back home?You can read all about one author's imaginative tale of just that very thing!The Ruins was recommended to me over and over again in my quest to read good horror.
(probably because this book was a chaser to Nick Cutter's the Troop)Also, one thing kept running through my mind the entire time which would have saved lives but I won't tell you because that would spoil all the fun!
loved it! I remember the movie but not well, so I went into the book almost fresh. Gruesome and well-written read. the characters were all kind of annoying, but I also think they were realistic. And as someone who went on a Mayan archaeological dig as part of her curriculum in college I had an extra connection to the plot, lol.
I thought I could feel the cool misty feel of the forest, smell the musky trees, hear the crowning cocks and chirping birds and see the sun going down and darkness slowly spreading in the sky turning the Mayan sacred hill into a graveyard full of immaculate white bones underneath the vines and beautiful purple flowers.
With one exception: A good GR friend rated this with “1” star and I think that the disappointment was due to the fact that she had read and enjoyed A Simple Plan and reasonably expected that this book was at par with that earlier work.
There’s Stacy the ditz, Amy the whiner, Jeff the leader and future doctor, Eric the clown, Pablo the goofy tourist tag along, Matthias the brooding German.
It was a very easy read and didn’t feel like 500 pages at all.
(view spoiler)[Jeff seems cold for his wanting to eat Amy, but really, if it’s a matter of survival, can you argue with him?
But yes, she’s a friend, and though it’s a life or death situation It just feels wrong.
Which if you read the book, well you know that’s not how it ended.
(hide spoiler)]So if you liked the movie read the book.
3.5 ⭐This book started out in an odd way and with what felt like, to me was a rocky tone. It just starts telling you random bits of things, spitting them at you and in random order. Maybe we were supposed to feel like (stereotypical) disorganized and ignorant college kids that had gotten drunk on the beach the night before ? Maybe. If so, that was effective. I kept telling myself, okay, it will settle eventually into an individual’s point of view; or become at least somewhat more coherent and sh
It just starts telling you random bits of things, spitting them at you and in random order.
Maybe we were supposed to feel like (stereotypical) disorganized and ignorant college kids that had gotten drunk on the beach the night before ?
It does settle down somewhat with the fact spitting, and just starts to tell the story more by trying to open the door for the reader and let them in, but it’s not too good at it.
It became smoother, but still I could see it being so much better if the characters were fleshed out more and made a bit more likable.
I thoroughly enjoyed it and even listened to the book on CD, which made the story even more intriguing.Four young Americans about to enter graduate school or begin new jobs back home are relaxing in Cancun, Mexico, soaking up too much sun and tequila.
At their hotel they befriend a group of Greek men and a German.
The only clue to his whereabouts is a crudely drawn map to the ruins.The Americans are up for a little adventure and decide to assist the German in his search.
The Americans have trouble communicating with the Greeks.
Having seen the movie a few years ago, I was expecting it to be a decent body horror tale of survival and I wasn’t disappointed on those two counts.
The movie was suspenseful and to the point and brutal and it was only 90 minutes long so there wasn’t a lot of time spent with the characters.
Yet they blunder on, even ignoring the locals armed with arrows.
This whole scenario brings out the very worst in them which is completely understandable but after a while I became very tired of their bickering and stupid decisions.
nature type but also the horrors of being a human and the choices we have to make in certain situations.
(hide spoiler)]It took a bit for me to get into this one, probably down to not having much chance to read it early on.
It was a fun read, in the disturbing kind of way, with some pretty horrific/graphic moments by the end.
Well worth a read, not one for the overly squeamish and give it a chance early on without too much judgement on the knobhead characters and you’re in for a fun ride.
Loved the tension in this one!**Re-read** CD S/L version: I think I picked up a lot more on the "environmental" elements in the beginning of the story this time around. :) This remains on the favorites shelf!
I have a feeling this book would have received a 5-Star rating from me rather than 4 had I not ran across a little ARC called The Troop several months ago.
Months later, the title popped back on my radar and I made myself check it out from the library within the hour so my brain couldn’t get a chance to fail me yet again.Having now read both, one scene contained in The Troop was clearly, let’s say, “inspired” by a very similar scene from The Ruins.
Had I read The Ruins first, The Troop may have received a demerit or two from me for borrowing something so memorable.
The Ruins isn’t your typical horror novel featuring a super scary bad guy.

I always suspected plants were evil and my recent reading has proved that.Plus this gives me something to look forward to on my trip to Mexico this year.
The idea of the story is interesting.
Being in another country is scary and this capitalizes that idea.
And what was his purpose in the book?
I would really like to know where it came from and how come nobody did anything about it (like, the Mayans).
****WARNING SPOILERS******* - It really bugged me that this plant was suddenly not only evil, but purposely intentionally malevolent.
Heightened ridiculousness came in the form of a vine that can suddenly form coherent conversations to taunt people.
- Why didn't the Greeks come sooner??
- Why is the vine evil?
I knew I'd never be able to stomach the actual movie and was happy when the trailer mentioned that it was based on a book.
I kept thinking of ways for them to fight, even if it ended up fruitless.
(Maybe if we knew more about him, we wouldn't like him, either, lol.) One of the characters even sketches a brief movie scenario of the situation, and unfortunately, while it's meant as a kind of joke, there's not much more depth to the characters than that.
If it's meant to be some double entendre -- the ruins of the characters, for example -- it still doesn't work.
OHMYLANTA, YES!!! 5 stars and everyone should read this! Full review to come
