Le Guin, 1929 – 2018: The Earthsea Quartet (Earthsea Cycle, #1-4) by Ursula K.
Le Guin"To light a candle, is to cast a shadow": Ursula K.
I first read “A Wizard of Earthsea” when I was 8, in between the Hobbit at 7 and The Lord of the Rings at 9 (precocious child…), followed by the rest of the trilogy, and then later books like “The Left Hand of Darkness”, “The Lathe of Heaven”, “The Dispossessed” and on and on.What a writer - in the six Earthsea books alone, she said more, and with more purpose and clarity, than any other fantasy author, except Tolkien, at least in my opinion.
If you're into stuff like this, read on.
'Tehanu' isn't the fourth book in a quartet, but the first book in a new trilogy.
Re-reading the first books as an adult, I was struck by the degree to which a writer with Le Guin's feminist credentials had written a series which observed all of the classic gender and power tropes.
Starting with 'Tehanu', she effectively rewrites the first three books, deconstructing them, reinserting the 'outsiders'.
But taken as a unit, the 'second' trilogy is a remarkable achievement, a rare example of fantasy questioning its own basis - all the more powerfully because Le Guin understands, and loves, what she is taking apart...
To pigeonhole Le Guin as 'fantasy' is in itself a mistake - this is literature at its darkest and best. The first two volumes in particular are astonishing: I'll always remember Le Guin's view on nominalism and the Atuan realm, they keep haunting me. A treasure of a book, just read it - like, NOW.
It is also nearly sexless, which gives the stories collected in this book a lovely archaic and Tolkienesque ring.Apart from its detached tone, what most sets The Earthsea Quartet apart from other fantasy series is its concept of magic, which involves knowing the true names of things -- the names things were given back when they were first created, many of which are now forgotten.
In the first three books of the series (A Wizard of Earthsea, The Tombs of Atuan and The Farthest Shore), she doesn't really go in for great villains, but leaves her evil forces largely unspecified.
I started this book back in October 2016 and occasionally broke off to read others, such as The Last Wish only returning to Ursula K.
I was particularly interested in reading this multi-book edition, because I wonder whether I ought to compile my own Deathsworn Arc series into one book.
So, having read the first four Earthsea books, what did I think of the whole volume?
There were parts of this huge book, which I loved reading and couldn't put down.
The trouble is, I don't think book 4 would have had the strong impact it had on me, if I didn't know the context in which Ged was returning to Gont.
"A Wizard of Earthsea" **"The Tombs of Atuan" ***"The Farthest Shore" ****"Tehanu" *****
This is basically some sort of Earthsea-apocalypse tale: the signs that the end of the world as they know it are coming abound, and the disappearance of magic from their world would cause this civilization to collapse.“Tehanu” reunites us with Arha - who now goes by Tenar, many years after her escape from Atuan.
It ends on an open and hopeful note that makes me want to check out more "Earthsea" books!The prose style has a soothing, comforting rhythm to it that brought me right back to the feeling of story time with my grandfather.
It fools the stomach and gives no strength to the hungry man.""Wizards, then, are not cooks," said Murre, who was sitting across the kitchen heart from Ged, carving a box-lid of fine wood; he was a woodworker by trade, though not a very zealous one."Nor are cooks wizards, alas," said Yarrow on her knees to see if the last batch of cakes baking on the hearth-bricks was getting brown.
What is a boat but a thing that doesn't leak water?""I've bailed some that do," said Murre."Well, mine leaked, too, unless I was constantly seeing to the spell." He bent down from his corner seat and took a cake from the bricks, and juggled it in his hands.
I love The Lord of the Rings for its wealth and genius as an epic narrative, however, as a piece of fantasy writing, the world and people created by Le Guin in her Earthsea books have a depth and sense of reality with which Tolkien, in my opinion, never managed to imbue his land of Middle Earth or its characters - and she can cover in fifty pages what JRR would need most of a book to say.
I think a fair few parts of it creeped me out and I stopped reading it way before the end.
Lastly I think it shows beautifully how the world tends to betterment through human effort, human openness and human honesty.All of which I think is pretty good going for a book that is meant to be for children and that manages to keep a strong narrative going all the way through.Sold?
These books are simply wonderful.
I concur wholeheartedly with Le Guin being held up alongside Tolkien.The Wizard of Earthsea: First of all the pace of this book is so refreshing.
The world created is so full, and the lore is beautiful; magic is in the understanding of the true names - magnificent.The Tombs of Atuan: a huge change from WoE.
Tenar is just such a wonderful character.
Dear Le Guin, oh my word.
I can't type enough < or 3s to express my adoration of these characters and this world that you have created for us.
I'm actually not finished, but i gave up about 300 pages in.I was so looking forward to this being a fabulous book, but the archaic wording sometimes annoyed me. Book One still showed a lot of promise, but half way Book Two i just got bored.I figured life is too short to read books that bore both pants ànd shirts off you.
It is like Le Guin using the saga as the vessel to explore the ways she blends fantasy genre with philosophy and social criticism, lastly, the story is mush more expanding beyond her.
It creates so many thoughtful questions, self-awareness not about human beings and gender roles but tackles on life and death debates that could be taken more profound explored much more than the limited plot and tone.
To be a little more cheerful, I'm certain it's the good thing to both love and criticize the book which might not make Le Guin unhappy about it.
I had read the first book earlier and liked it, but I read it again now. I think the first book may actually be my favourite of the quartet, although they are all good. It's not all pleasure though, all in all the series is pretty sad and even dark. But the writing is amazing and the characters are interesting. For a book series that's essentially about wizards, there's not much traditional 'wizard business' here, but the approach is refreshing and makes for compulsory reading for anyone interested in this genre!
I'll talk about each book:#1 'A Wizard of Earthsea'Ursula Le Guin immerses us into a world full of magic, dragons, and unknown dark powers, an Archipelago of islands.
It turns out that the Nameless Ones are not just superstition, because when Arha and Ged leave 'the Place', there is a massive earthquake, destroying the sacred buildings and tombs.We learn, with Tenar, how different the world is outside Atuan.
However now I have found out that there are several short stories about this world, and even a fifth book, called 'The Other Wind', which references a line from the story about the dragon-people Therru liked so much.
It was the first real fantasy book I'd ever read, with the exception of fairy tales.
Afterwards, I went through every fantasy and science fiction book I could lay my hands on in my local library.
Rereading the book as an adult was not frightening like that first time, and I knew everything that would happen, but there was still much to enjoy.
This book is a must-read for anyone who loves the fantasy genre, though there is much more available now, and adults may prefer more recently written books aimed at adults.
What I like about this one is the time span, e.e. the fact it's basically coming of age story, which is something of a rarity in fantasy genre.
Not one of the run-of-the-mills that spawn in huge quantities these days in fantasy genre.
From the first reading, I got to, let's say the "Book 3" of my own lifecycle so I guess I'll have to read it again these days to check if anything changed in perspective.
Probably better, come to think of it.
First reading through, I could only have guessed what it means to grow old (mature?) and take it on the face value.
This edition includes the first 4 books of the Earthsea cycle, as well as the map illustrations from each book.
The first time I read "A Wizard of Earthsea" I didn't like it.
Le Guin takes you on an adventure of the Archipelago in the first book, into the world of the Kargard Lands in the second book, to mend the world in the third and then gives you more insight about magic and Ged's healing in the fourth.
If you like magic, dragons and witty wizards whose power comes from words, then this is a book for you.
Hard to give a definitive rating because each book of Earthsea felt totally independent and very separate from the others, despite sharing characters. "A Wizard of Earthsea" is easily 5 stars and the quartet as a whole is a very satisfying, well-rounded read. Definitely one I'll come back to again.
It’s about learning what it means to have a self, and what it means to have life, and power.A Wizard of Earthsea is a fantasy classic that evokes the old tales of Merlin while also subverting them, bringing us a conflicted young lead with a shadow, a curious brown-skinned teenager who has great power.
The Farthest Shore was by far my favorite: we are introduced, at last, to our Arthur, and there are all the twistings of prophecy, death, exploration, pain, as a young man with a large destiny is taught by a quiet, learned wizard what it truly means to live, and to never use your power lightly.
The first book in the series is A Wizard of Earthsea and it was published in 1968.
The second book in the series is The Tombs of Atuan and it was published in 1972.
I loved Tenar as well and liked that I got her younger and older perspective.
I really felt like I got something important from that first book.
I liked that we got to revisit favorite characters and that Tenar and Ged were older.
If you only feel like reading one book, A Wizard of Earthsea has a lot to offer in it’s own right.
I love The Earthsea Cycle!A wizard of Earthsea - I think this is my favourite out of the trilogy (the first 3 books) I liked how Ged was a flawed hero and how he needed to learn the ways of magic, and humility, in the hard way.
Would have been better if the story developed more consistently throughout rather than just "sprung up"Tehanu - really liked this one, and probably my favourite if I had to choose between the 4.
I love how Tenar questions why males and females need to be treated so differently, and indeed the wizards with the 'male powers' can be rather evil in this book.
Instead, what Le Guin ultimately gives us is a mature, nuanced, and compelling sequence of novels that build on each other in a way that I don't recall seeing in any other fantasy series (that said, I haven't read a lot of fantasy in the past two decades).
In tone, setting, and character, it is very much a continuation of the trilogy, but the scope of the action and the far more nuanced intent show the extent to which Le Guin's own skill and concerns as an author developed in the eighteen years that passed between The Farthest Shore and Tehanu.
I see that there is another one, The Other Wind, published eleven years after "the last book of Earthsea" (Tehanu's subtitle).
I suspect Le Guin was attempting to convey some version of second-wave feminism with the idea that women are Freudian beings of the earth/caves/womb/darkness whose place is in the home and certainly not in school or civic life.
The power of (heterosexual, fertile) women is described as reproductive only, while men's power lies in the public/civic sphere.
Women are punished when they fail to recognize a man's civic power, men are praised to the stars if they deign to wash their own dish.
I found these books quite tiresome and would especially not give them to children or anyone else who might confuse Le Guin's reification for truth.
:) Since it is a quartet, one should mention that the whole Earthsea world and particular stories consisting this book was a very bright fantasy conception from the author, as the background created was unique and well-detailed (as regards the maps and the use of more that simply 1 or 2 isles in the stories).
But at least there are 2 more Earthsea books out there so the story is not ended yet (for me, hehe)!
As a representative of the fantasy literature genre, Earthsea is surely a book not to be neglected :) I hope you enjoy it as much as I did!
* A Wizard of EarthseaRead some time ago.
The characters are very well portrayed, the conflicts, internal and external just make sense.
And it can be read independently, it's mostly context free.* The Farthest ShoreNice wrapping up of the story but it just wasn't enough.
On the same level as the first book.* Tehanu (***spoilers***)***spoilers***This one just doesn't make sense, the depiction of Sparrowhawk on the other books contradict his personality in the beginning of this book.
Especially from The Farthest Shore.
His wisdom is lost.
Magically lost...And the ending is just too much Deus ex machina for my taste.
The first three books are pure magic, and I would certainly classify them among the best of the fantasy genre.
The first three books are easy reads, and the exciting plots kept me interested the entire time.
The greatest aspect of the books, in my opinion, is that--beyond being great stories--some deeper philosophical questions are examined throughout (including the nature of life and death, good and evil, and balance in the world).
The first three books are easily 5/5.
However, since this "quartet" includes the fourth book, I rate it:4.5/5

for BBC radio listeners
I was thoroughly enjoying it until about two-thirds of the way through, and right up until the end it had, again, the engaging characterization and immersive story which was the strong point of The Tombs of Atuan and notably lacking in A Wizard of Earthsea ((view spoiler)[It occurs to me that Ursula Le Guin may simply have a far better handle on the mindset and personality of Tenar than either of her other narrators (hide spoiler)]).
