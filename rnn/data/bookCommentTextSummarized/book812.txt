Sorry, but I could not give this more than 2 stars - and that may have been generous (it was 3 but as I wrote this review I lowered it to 2).
What an absolutely terrible role model for any young child who picks this up.As for the writing style, if you like to read this type, pick up a copy of the original and still the best - 'the King of Elfland's daughter'.Recommended anyone whose world is themselves and anyone else is to be used and discarded, you will find a kindred spirit in Eric.
Sweet story..my grandmother introduced me to this author years ago.
First grade Waldorf teacher read this to her class.
Cute little story. It was a little confusing to keep the characters straight and who was real and who was fantasy.
Another of my favorites growing up. Another odd ball fairy tale, but sweet and not too cheesy.
I liked the opening better than the closing, but all around very nice.
