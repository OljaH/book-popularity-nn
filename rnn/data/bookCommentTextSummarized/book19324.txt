There's less random hilarity in this volume, and more of a connected storyline, as Greg ruminates on his still strained friendship with Rowley, his uncle's upcoming wedding, his health class and school slumber party.
Greg's bored demeanor with everything having to do with his family, and his disappointment at being treated like a little kid at his uncle's wedding (he was hoping to be a full-fledged groomsman, rather than an assistant flower boy) was pretty silly, and the highlight of the book, for me, was the school sponsored sleepover.
The story begins with Greg explaining that since he and his best friend Rowley have had a big fight, their friendship has been "history.".
Susan Heffley, Greg's mother, announces that she will be going back to college for a few months in order to stimulate her mind.
As a result, the Heffley men must take care of themselves, and most stability falls apart.
Food is often ruined, and since Susan usually does the chores around the house, Greg is left with little clean clothes to wear.
This one brought in little surprises of Greg's mom leaving the house to the men and the resulting dilapidation of the daily routines, the short and thankful introduction of the domestic help and her witty circumventions around the works.I guess the reason we all find this so intriguing and compelling is that there's that kid inside each one of us.
Those troll incidents that we want to laugh out loud to but do not want to be associated to our adult images.This book brought many such incidents and packed them into one for me.
This was a very funny book. I loved all the parts of the book but I especially loved the part where Greg overheard his parents in thinking that he was going to be the GROOMSMEN because they were getting him a tux. He thinks he gets to join in on the party that's held for the to-be married man. But turned out he was the assistant flower boy. I was laughing so hard because he had to hold the flowers for Manny. i recommend this book to all who loves humor books.
This book like really great also I love page 133-163 trust me on this book. This book will make you laught hard and cry hard because this book was base on me because I all ways is worry for the first day of school. It also talks about how Greg lose's his BEST friend but in the end of this book Greg and Rolwey(best friend) gets back to get together.
This Series Like Snack For Me 💜
The Wimpy Kid series is crossing all the barriers of laughter, breaking all the records, leaving me 
I found this book funnier than the others because now Greg has started to have some real issue related to puberty and relations.
In this book Greg has to keep on dealing with his problems with Rodrick but not too much space is spent on that.
Rather this time the book starts with a lock-out which Greg presumed to be a girl-guys night out and how terribly wrong he turns out to be.
This time Greg also has to attend one of this uncles fifth wedding and the whole family is going to gather at grammy's house for this event.
I really enjoyed this book it had a lot of humor in the book.I also liked it because George's life is a lot like mine with school, brothers, home stuff etc.
This book was really good, even though it was a little weirdddddd, and for the people who read this, u probably know wat im talking about! :D Oh, and can u believe it? It was 215 pages long, but I read it in one day!
I don't approve how Greg treats his best-friend Rowley but after all what happened, at least they back as being friends in the end. I like how Greg's Gammie advised him not to hurry growing up and just enjoy his time as a teen now. Young readers of this series also must remember the lessons hidden behind the funny stories in this series because they are written especially for them.

I think its the best of all the other ones.If you like funny books , you should read this.Greg Heffl
I think this book is for people who like humer books and are in grades 2 to 6. My favorite part of the book was when Greg climed through the sewer to Rowely's house just so he could dodge Fregly(The wierd kid). The auther of this book is Jeff Kinney. I think this book was really funny becuase they do really wierd stuff like trying to ditch school.
Ακόμα μία ιστορία με το αγαπημένο μου σπασικλάκι, σε ένα βιβλίο για τις ιδιαιτερότητες της εφηβείας, την αξία της παιδικής ηλικίας, τον τέταρτο γάμο του θείου Γκάρι, τη φοιτήτρια - μαμά, την οικιακή βοηθό (που θα γίνουμε ρεζίλι αν βρει το σπίτι ασυμμάζευτο) και τη νύχτα στο σχολείο!!!
You're right, Greg, you should be in no hurry to grow up. Just keep amassing information for that biography of yours. Also, Greg is the star, but Rowley steals the spotlight every time he's around!
In this book Greg has lost his best friend Rowley because of an argument that they had.
Everything is pretty normal at school but Rowley and Greg are trying their best to try to avoid each other.
His uncle Gary was having his third wedding which was a complete dag to go to and the entire family had to stay at Gammie's house which he wasn't looking forward to.
Greg wants to go but his uncle Gary's wedding is on that day so he couldn't go, but Rowley ended up going.
I liked the part about Rowley and him becoming friends.
Diary of a Wimpy kid is about two kids named Greg and Rowley who are in there final year in middle school.
In their final year there friendship gets a little torn apart by Greg maturing and Rowley still acting like a five year old.
Diary of a Wimpy Kid is written in third person and Jeff Kinney’s point is to tell the life an unpopular kid in middle school who tries to be the coolest in school.
Not just anyone thought, I would only recommend it to young fifth graders who would like to know the life of a middle school student.
This is the worst book of this series in my opinion. The book is like the awkward middle part of the series (Much like Greg). It feels empty without Rowley, and it didn't really feel like it had a main plot. I just wasn't immersed into this book like the other ones in the series, but being a regular reader of the series, I had to read it.
2.5 not my cup of tea.
As per usual, hilarious stuff. I could live on this series... yes, more so than the HP series.
Greg and Rowley are on the outs. The trouble is, Greg doesn't have anyone to replace him with.  He's also dealing with growing up. It's not all fun and games. And there are also boy and girl parties coming up. Times are changing.  My favorite part was when the Heffley's got a maid. All I can say is, if being a maid means watching TV all day, eating snacks, and taking naps in my bed, then I guess I've finally found a career I can get excited about.This a is a fantastic series. So many giggles and

It's about a guy named Greg who has a friend named Rowley and they become enemies. And there at parties without Rowley by his side. So Rowley's parents get him a thing called "Big Brother". And it's a guy that acts like a brother to Rowley. At the end they end up becoming friends.I would reccommend this book. You will like it because it's kind of like our life.4/5
IT WAS AMAZEING
Okay, hands down this was the funniest D.O.A.W.K there is.

Diary of a Wimpy Kid the Ugly Truthby Jeff Kinneypublished 2010fiction Greg, the protagonist, writes in a diary most everyday. The setting is everywhere around Greg's house and the school that he goes to. There is no main problem in this book but some are Greg and his friend Rowley trying to become friends again after a long time of not talking to each other. Another problem that was in the book was when he tried to get into a commercial but failed to another kid that wasn't as good as him. The
An example of this is when Greg wants to get into the commercial and putts so much thought into it before he even knew if he can go to see if he could be in the commercial.
Another example was when he spent the night at his school and it ended up with a lot more rules than he thought.
One last example was when he was thinking of what his grandma will say to him and always avoiding her even though it could have not been too bad.
This book also made me realize that I shouldn't think that something will be bad but instead that it will be good.
