The legs on which this story stands are loose and wobbly.The heroine undergoes a facial surgical reconstruction after she survives a plane crash.
After the surgery, she looks exactly like another woman who died in the plane crash.
Let alone somebody else's face.I'm not sure if a plastic surgery can be done so well even in this century:(Note: The left one is  before, not after.)Anyhow, she‚Äôs got a new face and she gets used to it immediately.

4.5 Stars  The crash of a Dallas-bound jet wasn't just a tragedy to TV reporter Avery Daniels; it was an act of fate that handed her a golden opportunity to further her career. Mistaken for a glamorous, selfish woman named Carole Rutledge, the badly injured Avery would find that plastic surgery had given her Carole's face, the famous senatorial candidate Tate Rutledge for a husband, and a powerful Texas dynasty for in-laws. And as she lay helpless in the hospital, she would make a shattering dis
Mistaken for a glamorous, selfish woman named Carole Rutledge, the badly injured Avery would find that plastic surgery had given her Carole's face, the famous senatorial candidate Tate Rutledge for a husband, and a powerful Texas dynasty for in-laws.
Now, to save Tate's life, Avery must live another woman's life and risk her own
Sex scenes were smoking hot as usual.So why not 5 stars?
Again, I think it is because I love the books where the main male character is a bit of an ass and he is the one under suspicion too.
Tate was not under suspicion here.
Mirror Image is another one to add to my favorites list of Sandra Brown books. I think Avery and Tate are one of my favorite couples. This one takes us to beautiful Texas to the Rocking R Ranch.  As with all my other reviews for her books I‚Äôm not going to say too much about the plot because it is so much better to jump into her stories without too much floating around in your mind. The synopsis gives you all you really need to know.I wasn‚Äôt sure how SB was going to pull off this plot though. How

As with all my other reviews for her books I‚Äôm not going to say too much about the plot because it is so much better to jump into her stories without too much floating around in your mind.
The one thing that could have clearly identified Avery was no longer with her.
Tate and Avery drove me crazy, in all the most wonderful ways possible!
With the basis of how their relationship began there was no way things were going to end well right?
put it back the next day after I blew my currently reading books and re-read this instead.
One might believe that if you read a mystery book once, then there's no point in re-reading it once the plot is unveiled.
But the second time you pay attention to all the little clues that the author put for you to find but were unaware the first time.
I loved it equally this second time and I'm sure there will be many re-reads in the future.This one became one of my favorite.
I will certainly re-read again in the future.
I loved it....
I've accidentally sumbled upon this book on wattpad where she posted it as a treat for her fans.
The story had its flaws and the whole ending was a just a tiiiiny bit disappointing but I loved Avery and I rooted so damn hard for her so I really can't give this book less than 4 stars.
For some reason, besides Avery, I loved Fancy.
The chemistry between Avery and Tate was craaazy and I was so happy when he finally found out the truth.
Overall, I didn't expect to like this book as much as I did.
This book's blurb sounded so promising and the plot idea was great.
In fact, the story had strong potential, but alas, it was unable to deliver as much as I expected it would be.
I then came to understand why she chose to do such a thing.
There were some unrealistic things in the story, but fortunately, they didn‚Äôt bother me much.Anyway, this book was well written.
I was somewhat pleased by the fact that this book wasn‚Äôt perfect, yet it had me hooked and kept me reading late into the night.On the whole, this is another one of my unputdownable reads.
ME GUST√ì BASTANTE‚Ä¶No hab√≠a le√≠do nada de la autora y me sorprendi√≥ mucho, ten√≠a tiempo que no le√≠a u
4.5 ‚òÜ#RitaBrown.Este es otro culebr√≥n que he disfrutado mucho, en el que los l√≠os de familia y los secretos e intrigas llevan el peso de la historia junto a la relaci√≥n de los protas.Es cierto que acert√© quien era uno de los villanos, pero el otro s√≠ que me sorprendi√≥ porque no hab√≠a pensado en √©l para nada.De momento, leer a Sandra Brown est√° result√°ndome muy gratificante, a ver si los siguientes libros que tengo preparados tambi√©n me dejan este buen sabor de boca.
2¬∫ libro del #RetoRita2 #Ritabrown!Me ha encantado! Pedazo de culebr√≥n que recuerda a Dallas en todo su esplendor -si hasta tiene su propia Sue Ellen, tambi√©n de nombre compuesto- y al que la autora homenajea sin pudor. Me ha gustado mucho esa trama tan enrevesada, la qu√≠mica entre los protagonistas, esos personajes secundarios tan bien construidos y, aunque hay cosas que me ol√≠a, la resoluci√≥n final me ha sorprendido para bien. Pena que √©sta haya sido algo precipitada y que no haya llegado a creerme lo mucho que tarda el protagonista en darse cuenta del cambiazo. Lo recomiendo mucho.
Me suele pasar con el tema de la suplantaci√≥n de personas.La historia est√° bien montada, aunque desde el primer momento he sabido quien era el malo, quiz√°s demasiado claro estaba, lo otro, lo he supuesto, pero yo misma he pensado que no podr√≠a ser jajajajEl problema es que se resuelve todo en las √∫ltimas 30 hojas, demasiado r√°pido, y el tema entre ellos, muy previsible.Pero me ha gustado el estilo de esta mujer y, aunque no creo que sea realmente una novela rom√°ntica, leer√© algo m√°s de ella.
Me ha gustado el tema de las presiones electorales, esos t√≥picos familiares y la cr√≠tica-an√°lisis al m√°s puro estilo Dallas jajajaja
WOW! LOVED THIS ONE!
#RitaBrown A m√≠ este estr√©s al acabar un libro me hace perder a√±os de vida üòÇüòÇüòÇ. Me lo he pasado bomba leyendo! En el post del #RetoRita2 os contar√© mi opini√≥n!
#RitaBrown #RetoRita25/5Guau!!! me ha superencantado. Qu√© culebronazo, XD!!! Si parec√≠a Dallas en todo su esplendor...La intriga superbien llevada hasta el final. Los personajes principales y secundarios fant√°sticos.. Y ¬øqu√© me dec√≠s de Tate? XDXDXD!!!!!Leedlo todas ya!!!!
reread: br with Amanda:) Despite the plot was as unrealistic as it got and most of the characters kinda pissed me off, the book was unputdownable and I couldn't figure out who the mastermind behind the plot was until Mrs. Brown showed her cards in the end. Cool:/
The story line for this book could have been interesting but honestly, I couldn't stand any of the characters.Tate Rutledge is running for senator when his wife Carole is involved in a horrific plane crash - she and his 3-year-old daughter are one of few survivors of the fiery crash.
She was risking both her own professional career and Tate's eventual love because she convinced herself that only if she were faking being Carole could she find out who was behind it all (and yeah, it didn't help her at all...turns out people who aren't involved at all figure it out way before her).The real Carole was a real piece of work who doesn't even seem realistic.
What a stupid anti-climax of an ending.
I loved this one and so far, Tate and Avery are my fave MCs of SB's books.Okay, I had my doubts on how you one person could pull off being another person even with the striking resemblance and while for some of it you have to have an open mind, Ms. Brown did a great job!
If you love a great mystery with a few surprises, really complex and intriguing characters...loved Fancy, Irish and Van...and a superbly written story, you must read this book!
While recuperating in the hospital from surgery to restore her face but before she regains the ability to communicate, someone lets her in on the plan to assassinate Tate but she doesn't know the identity of that person.
Avery makes the decision to continue to impersonate Carole and figure out the identity of the killer.As with most mystery/suspense stories, you cannot say too much about them without spoiling the experience for other readers.
There were times when I questioned Avery's integrity as she allowed the ruse to continue for a protracted period of time, deepening the relationship with not only Tate but his daughter Mandy.The ending was a little anticlimatic but still interesting.
I guess the reader is supposed to get some voyeuristic delight out of being mistaken for another (prettier, more glamorous) woman, getting to screw her hot husband and playing Mommy to her daughter, while telling herself that this other woman (Carole Rutledge) was despicable and all these people were better off with herself (Avery)...But I found it very hard to like Avery or relate with her. In slightly different circumstances it could have been a guilty pleasure...and I wanted it to be so. (I wish Avery had been more honest) Sadly I did not enjoy it.
La verdad es que no recordaba que Dallas, Dinast√≠a o Falcon Crest tuvieran historias tan complejas como esta...
Secretos, enga√±os, gente que no es quien se supone que es, sangre, conspiraciones, infidelidades, mentiras....
y todo ello con un poquito de amor...No soy muy fan de este tipo de historias tan complicadas y la primera mitad del libro se me ha hecho eterna...
Me ha faltado saber m√°s de la historia de amor principal.Adem√°s al final se arregla todo muy r√°pido y me han faltado cosas....He cumplido con el #retoRita2 #ritaBrown del mes de julio; a por el siguiente, qie agosto est√° ya aqu√≠ al lado....
Avery is a reporter who is in a plane crash and mistakenly identified as Carole Rutledge, the wife of aspiring senatorial candidate, Tate Rutledge.
The real Carole Rutledge was also mistaken for Avery, and died in the plane crash.
Just as Avery is about to reveal the truth to Carole's husband Tate in the hospital after she is well enough to speak, she discovers that there is a plan in action to assassinate him.
The characters were totally loveable, except for the real Carole, what a piece of work!
I've read several other book by Sandra brown so when I saw this one was only $1.99 I purchased it without a second thought.
The plot sounded interesting enough but ended up being utterly ridiculous.
I thought this would be a suspenseful book but what I ended up with was soft core porn.
It also confirmed that i will never bother with another one of browns books as I seriously question her ability as a well respected author.
Brown focused less about these two screwing and put more thought into the plot the book would be descent.
The ending was half assed and also ridiculous.
The plot was so implausible that it was hard to become immersed in the story.
She, a stranger, inserted herself into a family's life in order to get a good scoop (which no paper would run for fear of a massive lawsuit) and to stay close to a man she decides she loves after a couples of weeks of one-sided interactions with him.
She then moves into his family's home and spends a lot of time alone with his three year old child.
Extremely creepy.Tons of plot holes.
Why did the plastic surgeon not notice how Avery's teeth differed from Carole's dental records?
How did he not notice that Avery's bone structure differed from Carole's photographs?
Far fetched and sometimes bordering on ludicrous, this novel still remains quite entertaining.
The greatest shortcoming of the book is (in my eyes) the hero's job.A politician !Of all the possible professions, this is one of the worst for a character that isn't the villain.
I get that this is some kind of cultural clash, and that politicians are not perceived in every countries as dishonest, manipulative, hypocritical and power-hungry turncoats, but still this one was hard to swallow.
So I don't really know if it was just me or the book, but as absorbing as the novel was, I couldn't rate it higher.
I tried, I really tried, but if you cant stand the heroine your reading suffers. Avery was an annoying heroine. Sandra has written better books like the Witness, Exclusive, The Alibi, Ricochet and Smoke Screen.
O carte plina de emo»õie!
Not my favourite Sandra Brown but still a 3.5 star read.
Entertaining and enjoyable mystery suspense with some feel good romance at the end.I questioned some of Avery‚Äôs actions, but I‚Äôm not sure what I would have done differently.You need to suspend disbelief that the husband would not sense differences in his wife: her walk, talk, mannerisms, body parts, and scars.
I‚Äôm fine with long audiobooks.STORY IDEA FOR OTHER AUTHORS - A STUPID SECONDARY CHARACTER THAT I‚ÄôD LIKE TO SEE AS A HEROINE:At first, I did not like Francine.
Avery Daniels is a has-been television reporter on her way to cover a story in Dallas when her plan crashes almost immediately after take-off.
Also on the plane are Carole Rutledge and her 3 yr old daughter Mandy.
Carole's husband, Tate, is running for the senate seat in Texas.Avery manages to evacuate the burning plane with Mandy in tow and is mistakenly identified as Carole Rutledge.
Unable to immediately communicate and tell everyone she's not who they think she is Avery is forced to take on the roll of Carole Rutledge in order to save her own life, the life of Tate Rutledge and help Mandy recover from the horrifying plane crash.
I was so engaged I stayed up til 4:30am to finish it.
I found it so far fateched but it was still super engaging.
It was a pretty long book and I waited and waited and waited some more for the MCs to vocalize their love for each other and get on the same page...
We never got to enjoy their love for each other or his sweet "untainted by hate" side.
Other than the ending which I was highly dissapointed in I sincerely enjoyed this "who dun it", "will they/won't they?" love story.
