Probably one of the books which made me realize I long to learn more about languages and how to teach them, English in particular, effectively! It motivated me to choose English teaching in my postgraduate studies.
This is the perfect read for an introduction into linguistics, it has everything and so much more. I'll need to re-read it some other time because I skimmed through some parts real quick and didn't read properly through them.This is an all-timer, good for everyone who wants to major in linguistics or even those who just want more insight on the discipline.
Everything you ever wanted to know about language, and much, much more!
Keep in mind that this is a text book, so it's going to be dry.
But for a text book, it wasn't so bad.
If this is an area of interest to you, why not try looking up Steven Pinker's book "The Language Instinct" which paralled "An Introduction to Language" almost perfectly, yet was much more enjoyable.
Another book to check out is "The Unfolding of Language" by Guy Deutscher.
By far the most interesting book I've read on this subject, yet not comprehensive like the other two.
I had to buy this book for a linguistics course that I had to take way back when I started studying English at the University.
The linguistics course was extremely dull and one of the many reasons I decided to switch to another branch of study.
Especially the chapters about Phonology and Phonemics and the ones about the structure of language are not an easy read.
Still, I thought they were extremely interesting.
Some chapters, especially the ones referring to computer electronics are way outdated now, but I guess that would be different with more recent editions.
واقعا کتاب سختی برای امتحان دادن بود. فعلا هشت فصلش رو خوندیم و گذاشتیم کنار تا بعد. متن روونی داره اما سخت کردنش واقعا واقعا واقعا سخته!
I read this book for the class The English Language, which was maybe the most generally interesting class I have ever taken. This book is absolutely fascinating and very easy to read, especially considering that at times it's dealing with complicated ideas. It covers everything from the basics of what makes up words and sounds to how children develop language to dialects and hispanic and black english. It really will change the way you think about words and speaking.
One of my favourite college textbooks. I lost my copy and had to buy another one, can't stand the fact that it does not exist in bookcase.
Međutim u nazivu knjige možda bi se trebao dodati atribut "engleskog" jer se doista općenite jezične postavke donose prije svega iz perspektive gramatičkih zakona u engleskom jeziku (ponegdje vrlo rijetko i drugih jezika).
Ipak je to možda moja kroatistička deformacija jer se engleski jezik smatra univerzalnim jezikom znanstvenog diskursa pa stoga ne čudi naslov.
U svakom slučaju sveobuhvatna knjiga, donosi neke osnovne alate za sve koje zanima jezik te se iz nekog razloga bave ili se žele baviti jezikom.
Činjenica je da jezik nije evolucijski nastao kao fizička potreba (u tom smislu on je popratna pojava razvoja ostalih organa) te se ne može točno locirati u mozgu (kao npr.

I usually find introductory texts to be either lacking in content or boring and this one was neither. This book was a pleasure to read.
This book is a must-read for anyone who is interested in languages in general and linguistics in special.
For a textbook, I'm glad to say this was not terribly dry. However, I feel that the book presents a limited view of current topics of interest. For example, various contemporary linguists qualify or refute Chomsky's innateness hypothesis, yet this text presents the innateness hypothesis and Universal Grammar as virtually uncontested. I understand that Chomsky's views are widely accepted by linguists, I just would prefer it if the text at least mentioned other viewpoints. Especially since there have been so many in the last decade.Admittedly, there is a new edition of this book. Hopefully the new edition addresses this issue.
If you're looking for a thorough book in introductory linguistics, you need look no further than this book. The 13th edition of 600-page "Introduction to Language" covers topics as recent as computational linguistics and forensic linguistics. However, if you're studying for an exam, and you're pressed for time, you may not appreciate the verbosely explained examples, which provide a language aficionado with plenty of content for showing off their linguistics knowledge through fun facts at social events (which I'll totally be doing). 😂
It is a decent overview of the subject and I did appreciate the comic strips included throughout, but the text was often unnecessarily repetitive and dry.
Those six pages can be summed up as chimps can communicate in a limited way on very specific subjects but lack the creative aspect and grammatical complexity of human language.Part of my issue with the text may be that I read it cover to cover in less than a month, whereas in a class you would read the book in smaller sections over a semester.
Linguistics is a great subject and if you are looking for an overview this isn't a bad place to start.
What a dreadful little thing linguistics are. There were some interesting bits but way too repetitive in my opinion...so... I had to push myself through it most of the time. I had to read this book for class, but now that I am done with it I can finally say goodbye to this. thank heavens. May the Linguistics God be with you and help you pass.
Personally, I didn't really enjoy reading this. However, it's *very* well structured, intelligible, and a little quirky; making the learning experience all the less boring. Overall, if you're interested in studying the foundations of linguistics in an academic or recreational setting, I'd definitely recommend picking this book up.
It's the English Major nerd it me, but linguistics is wonderfully fascinating!
Definitely an interesting read, but my brain hurts!! Everything one would want to know about language (and a lot I don't) is found in this well organized textbook.
A must-have linguistics manual for anyone working with teaching or research!
I will recommend this book to anyone interested in language topics but without or with limited linguistic background.
This book was on the recommendation list during my early year in university, partly because the language is easy to follow -since it is an introduction- and also the scope is comprehensive -not only covering grammar (morphology, syntax, semantics, pragmatics, phonetics, and phonology), but also psycolinguistics, sociolinguistics, computational linguistics, historical linguistics, and writing systems.
The book 600s pages also contain exercises to test your understanding (but no answer keys to cheat, sorry!) Overall the chapters are interesting, with one chapter I enjoy reading the most.
Those heady days when I believed I'd emerge with a double degree in linguistics and history!I still am fascinated by language.
This book is a great introduction to the fundamental concepts of linguistics.
Things like aphasia and child language acquisition are just endlessly fascinating, and this book explained them in a simple and readable manner.The only part I had trouble with was my most disliked aspect within the subject of linguistics: phonetics.
That was why the I took like a year to finish the book - I put it down at that section and procrastinated picking it up again.
Studied half of it in a linguistics course with another book that had the same information but this one was more fun similar to the (Dummies) book series that have a sense of humor & nicely put the information into your brain which makes it an option for autonomous learners
Didn't actually finish this book, but the class is over so...
good intro textbook
Really informational and helpful for my linguistics course this semester! Not a difficult read either.
One of the best books for a linguistic student.Usually educational books are dry and dull to read but this was very interesting, gripping and easy to read.The book is comprehensive and covers every part of linguistic studies.I'm really happy I came across this book and I would suggest it to any one interested in Languages.
This textbook was fascinating.
The chapters about how our brains process language information and why we speak a certain way were completely intriguing.
It was interesting to see the ways people's brains develop and how cultures might process grammar in a different way.
I also loved seeing the differences in how people pronounce words and how grammar is varied based on where you life.
I found most of the information in this textbook relevant and fascinating.
I enjoyed reading the chapters and I felt like it helped with my linguistic knowledge of language and how people speak and write.
Serves its purpose as an introduction to linguistics by covering a vast amount of necessary subjects, such as morphology & syntaxis.
Every new bit was accompanied by a relevant quote, which maybe wasn't necessary but made it fun, and the same goes for the comics which were added here and there.
A book that's very up-to-date (includes references to Harry Potter & Twitter and names Obama as president, for example) and therefore still very relevant.
Something that I liked a bit less however was that it mostly focuses on (American) English.
And another fair warning would probably be that according to my professors, the chapter on Sociolinguistics is "rubbish".
A pretty decent introduction to linguistics which deals with most general topics in the field. However, I don't like how they consider Chomsky's theories on language in an almost dogmatic way. It sounds as if they were simple truths, known to everybody, but they really are not. There's a widespread discussion on the topic, and opposing views (which this book doesn't cover at all) can be found within followers of Wittgenstein (on a philosophical level) and cultural linguists (like Daniel Everett and Guy Deutscher). Too simplistic a book, too preaching for just one view of many!
Last year I had to get this book for my Phonetics class. Luckily I hold on to it, because this book is also the textbook for Introduction to Linguistics, which I'm taking this trimester.
