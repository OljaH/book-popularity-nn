The fear all men have that there’s something inside us that shifts, and turns. A living thing, once dormant, stirring now, and filled with rage. Not quite as good as You Will Know Me, in my opinion, but still another great example of why Megan Abbott is one of my favourite authors.I can't recall any writer this adept at crafting complex, flawed female characters and the relationships between them. Abbott crawls deep inside the female brain - to all its dark places, thoughts and jealousies - and
Abbott crawls deep inside the female brain - to all its dark places, thoughts and jealousies - and captures it in such a way that I can feel the story getting under my skin.
Dr Severin is famous for her studies on female disorders, and particularly PMDD - PMS's nastier and more debilitating sister.After Diane reveals a dark secret to Kit, their friendship falls apart and the girls go their separate ways, both to successful careers.
This book is about the power of secrets, the past's habit of coming back to haunt you, and also the fine line between female friendship and rivalry (as most of Abbott's thrillers are).

3.5 Stars! Dark secrets embedded in a totally unique thriller... Most teenagers have secrets they share with friends. There is nothing unusual about that, but this secret is so dark that it threatens to change the course of two lives.  Thankfully none of my high school friends shared any secrets that gave me nightmares. Kit is haunted by the secret Diane shared with her (she did what?!!). She wants to rid herself of it, but the cat is out of the bag.I loved the "Then" and "Now" format as we lear
Thankfully none of my high school friends shared any secrets that gave me nightmares.
Kit is haunted by the secret Diane shared with her (she did what?!!).
She wants to rid herself of it, but the cat is out of the bag.I loved the "Then" and "Now" format as we learn about the two high school friends, Kit and Diane and the past they shared.
Some science with the laboratory setting and the research going on (even mice make an appearance), a bit of a YA feel with the high school rivalry, part thriller and maybe even a tad touch of horror.
Her descriptions give her entire writing this very sinister feel, and it’s glorious.
They are at once each other's biggest rivals and each other's biggest allies and Kit's feelings for Diane are so wonderfully complicated.Megan Abbott’s work never really sustains itself off plot twists or reveals for me; she’s more of a talent at creep factor and character work.
But I will say there’s this particularly nasty twist towards the end, and I didn’t think there would be another twist, and it’s kind of the most fucked up part of the entire book.
Kit meets Diana at school, both runners, both work harder than anyone else, both want to win the scholarship sponsored by the reknown Dr. Severin.
Diane has a big secret, one she tells Kit, who she considers her friend, but friends can so easily become rivals, when both want the same thing.Years pass, Kit works with Dr. Severin in her lab on a study of female menses, when she is unexpectedly united with Diana once again.
On the surface Diana and Kit are alike but underneath they are very different.
Kit always felt as if she were one step behind Diane, but that didn't stop her from wanting, from trying.One night, Diane told Kit a secret she had kept hidden from everyone.
We don't know why we're drawn, but it's unstoppable."Without warning, Kit faces the same feelings about Diane she had hidden away after high school.
How far will things have to go before Kit feels secure in her work, and her lifeor will that ever be a possibility?Megan Abbott has created some of the best "mean girl" characters in fiction over the last few years, in novels like 
4 Stars.Kit and Diane met while in High School and became fast friends.
Years later, Kit is a Research Scientist in a lab, working for her idol, Dr. Severin.
If Kit thought her relationship with Diane was complicated before, she was wrong.
In Give Me Your Hand, Megan Abbott creates an interesting story with characters whose lives are quite complicated and whose stories draw you in.
Thank you to NetGalley, Little Brown and Company and Megan Abbott for an ARC of this novel in exchange for an honest review.Published on NetGalley and Goodreads on 7.21.18.
Then one day, Diane shares a secret with Kit, a secret which changes their friendship forever.
Diane is hired to work in the same lab as Kit and they learn that they are up for the same position working under a brilliant scientist whom they both idolize.This both is told through "Now" and "Then" chapters filling in the gaps of their friendship.
At the same time the reader watches as those in the lab vie for the coveted position and things take a turn and yet again their lives are changed.Part of this book takes place in a lab, but I did not feel that any of the scientific language or experiments got in the way of the story.
On one hand, Megan Abbott is queen, but this definitely isn't my favorite book she's written.
I'm not sure if I just wasn't as invested in the characters this go around, as it took a little longer for me to become engrossed in the story, or if maybe I've read too many books in this vein, but either way I fully accept that I'll be in the minority here.
You can also bet your bottom dollar that I'll be waiting with bated breath for Abbott's next novel, just as I have all the times before.
Now, years later, Kit is a research scientist and Diane has reappeared in her life.
Yes, Lanister, oddly fitting since I compare the machinations of teenage girls in Megan Abbott's books to Game of Thrones characters.
Years later, Kit's on the verge of having the life of a scientist she always wanted when Diane pops up again, a sociopathic bad penny.This story is doomed to take a dark turn from the start and it does, of course.
While a lot of other crime books get more press, Megan Abbott's are the best thing in the genre today.
From here, the novel takes a dark, disturbing turn.
Told in alternating chapters titled Now and Then, this novel explores the cut-throat world of research scientists and how far one will go to advance their career.
Underlying themes are the corrosive nature of secrets told, friendship, and the thin line between brilliance and insanity.Kit and Diane, along with supporting characters, aren’t ones you will love but it makes for an intense, compelling read.
Megan Abbott is one of my go-to authors and this novel confirms her position as one of my favorite authors.
I'm at 42%. I'm saying this one got the best of me. DNF Booksource: Netgalley in exchange for review.

It also appears that I spend a goodly chunk of time using my review space saying “if you like Megan Abbott, then you’ll like this” on books that I actually liked more than most Abbott books – excluding, of course, The End of Everything because that thing was the bomb diggity.
While I was never once tempted to put Give Me Your Hand to the side and pick up a different selection, it wasn’t nearly as page turny (new word) for me as some of her other stories.

Years later Kit is working in a lab and hoping to score one of the few slots available in a prestigious project when Diane is hired by her boss.
When Abbott has Kit realizing how close she is to either achieving a critical next step in her career resulting in a vastly improved lifestyle or is about to come up short after all her hard work to get there you know exactly what’s driving her.At the heart of all it is this complex relationship between Kit and Diane, and that’s where the noir part comes into it.
It was worth every one of those late minutes!Kit Owens and Diane Fleming are not your normal teen girls.
(I'm not sure if Megan Abbott has written any stories about normal teen girls, come to think of it.) They are good students and they both jog.
She works in Dr. Severin's lab and is vying for an important spot on a team studying PMDD, a horrible offshoot of PMS that causes all kinds of problems for women.
This is my favorite Megan Abbott book so far, (though I still have a few to read yet), and it was partially because I'm a super fan of the THEN and NOW format and it worked beautifully here.
You either know Megan Abbott books or you don't.
This book is absolutely consistent with Abbott's oeuvre, but also presents us something new.
Abbott's characters always lean a bit on the precipice, always feel like they could spiral off into darkness, and if it's a bit more heavy handed here, it never feels unearned.I like thrillers and crime novels but often there will be a BIG SECRET and the book spends all this time hyping you for the BIG SECRET and then you get to the BIG SECRET and it is not that big and often destroys all the buildup.
Abbott knows better.
I’ve only read one other Megan Abbott book (“Dare Me”) and I remember how much I liked her writing.
The women can’t help it, are slaves to it.”As the post-docs tensely await Dr. Severin’s decision, word comes down that Severin has just selected one of the three team members – a rising star from another laboratory, Diane Fleming.
It goes to Kit, pairing her once again with her former friend and competitor Diane.The story is tense and riveting and reads like a thriller, but it is much more than that.
I liked this book but I didn't love it as much as her others.
Kit and Diane meet in high school.
Kit has never met anyone quite like Diane.
She tells Kit her terrible secret.
Kit now bears the burden of this secret and it nearly drives her crazy.
Kit works in a research lab under Dr. Severin studying premenstrual dysphoric disorder.
Dr. Severin has brought her on the team and Kit can't believe her eyes.
Megan Abbott's unique voice is present throughout but for whatever reason I just wasn't as invested in these characters like I have been with some of her other books.
This was a really interesting thriller/character study!
The start was kind of unusual and it took me a little while to figure out what sort of book I was getting into, but I ended up really enjoyed it.
The present-day segments were really engaging.
Kit and Diane are scientists in a lab researching bio-genetics, which was unique and well-researched, with a great cast of characters, and once the story got churning, it was impossible to put down.
I always look for books with a unique setting and premise and this had one for sure!
Trigger Warnings: (view spoiler)[ violence, murder  (hide spoiler)]Please excuse typos/name misspellings.
3.5 starsI liked it, just can't say I loved it.What I liked:-The relationship between the 2 main characters.
They fed off of each other in a way that I haven't read before and it was the driving force of the whole book.-The premise that this all started with the telling of a secret as a teen, and the life long effects it had on the both of them.What I didn't like:-The pace was a bit slow for my liking and seemed to flat line a lot.-The bouncing back at forth between timelines felt a bit jarring to me for some reason.
Give Me Your Hand was a solid 4 stars for me.
Kit and Diane are high school buddies, that is until Diane tells Kit a secret.
Kit is obviously haunted by this secret but she’s getting ready to graduate HS and plans on putting some serious distance between her and Diane.
That was “then” though-fast forward to the present, where Kit is working in a prestigious research lab and just found out that her new co-worker is someone she knows.
Yes, it’s Diane and things are about to get way more interesting.
You wonder how many more varieties of driven, murderous teen girls Megan Abbott can come up with.
What's next?Intense Teens Who Might Still Murder Somebody- Theater girls- Girls who just became vegetarians - A cappella singers- Yearbook editorsThe reason Megan Abbott is (slightly) less famous than, like, Gillian Flynn is, she doesn't have the flair for big twists.
For me, personally, we're getting closer and closer to the girls I personally dated during high school, so once we get to Murderous Teen Members of the Amnesty International Club we'll be inside my life and will we even be able to count the bodies?
Megan Abbot has a wonderful ability to convey the inner most desires of her characters in a way which feels like the reader is peaking beneath a curtain into the watery pools of their emotions.Give Me Your Hand is noir without the sepia splash and minus the mysterious fedora-wearing character.
In their place are test tubes, lab mice, and vibrant characters full of life who are bursting at the seams with secrets and ambition.
They also share a secret which plagues both from their formative years of teenage angst through to their professional place in the world of pharmaceuticals.A secret worth killing to keep.
Meet Kit Owens and Diane Fleming two intense girls brought together in Megan Abbott's Give Me Your Hand.
They both go their separate ways for years, each achieving lofty standards until fate and a brilliant research scientist bring them together once again to compete for a spot on her team investigating the effects of premenstrual rage that at times plagues women.
Secrets reveal the mind and the heart of the girls in this tale and as the time draws near for the selection of the team, both girls, now grown to women, twist and turn to achieve what they want.
But all that changes when Diane shares an explosive secret with Kit, one that changes the way she views Diane and basically ends their friendship.
Ten years later, Kit has tried to put Diane (and her secret) behind her.
Soon Diane and Kit find themselves over their head, with secrets and horror lurking around every corner.
It also shows the complicated feelings of our female characters: Kit has a lot of thoughts.
I enjoyed how the novel delved into the darkness of friendship--and some of the competition that can come with it.
Diane and Kit's relationship is dark and intense, as is the entire novel, really.
There’s no crying in...science!There might be murder, though.I feel like Megan Abbott is sort of the Tom Hanks of thrillers.
- I am here for that!*I also thought Diane was a much more interesting antagonist than in many of Abbott’s previous books, especially that of You Will Know Me. I loved Abbott’s turn away from a more “mean girl” type of villainess toward a more quiet and mysterious, conflicted, otherworldly antihero.
I know many people don’t feel this way, but if you love this book - I’m with you!!* I REALLY wanted to title this review “Dial STEM For Murder!” - but I thought, that’s so good that surely someone’s thought of it already.
I love a beautifully written thriller -- and this is exactly that. Not a who-done-it, but a why-done-it, with palpable dread on every page. And, as my own readers know, I love dread. And so I loved this exquisite novel.
Kit Owens and Diane Fleming were friends for a short time when they were in high school.
Diane shared a terrible secret with Kit and it ended the friendship.
Now 12 years later, Kit is a post doc and Diane reappears in her life.
They will be studying premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD), which is sort of PMS on hyperdrive and causes rage, among other symptoms.
I've read too many thrillers and I need some basic level of believability for a book to get out of the mediocre range.
If I read only a couple of books a year I would probably be a lot easier to please.
*https://mrsbbookreviews.wordpress.comMegan Abbott is the award winning author behind the novel Give Me Your Hand.
Give Me Your Hand centres on two strong female protagonists, Diane and Kit, who were best friends in high school.
Abbott’s novel has received plenty of praise from fellow authors and has been well received by reviewers across all social media platforms.
The primary protagonists offer a good example of highly ambitious women, who are trying to gain the upper hand in a professional male dominated world.
Full appreciation goes to the author, Megan Abbott, for putting the spotlight on women in this situation.
Because the bad things you do become part of you, literally. This is no metaphor. They become part of you on a cellular level, in the blood. You are friends with someone in high school to the point where you're so tight you confide in each other. Until one night, your friend tells you something so dark and fucked up that you realize you need to just keep your distance. The friendship no longer exists. Twelve years later, that friend shows up at your workplace and is your new co-worker. What hap
Twelve years later, that friend shows up at your workplace and is your new co-worker.
If someone told me something so messed up that I realized I shouldn't be friends with them anymore, then there is no way in hell I'd be comfortable with them in my workplace.
And how does it affect you?Add in the fact that your job is one where there are only so many coveted spots on a huge research team, things get iffy here.
Can you keep your old friends secret?
The two are close until a secret is shared that end the friendship.
