“...when you have been nourishing your soul on expectation, reality is apt to be disappointing.” ― Eric Ambler, The Dark FrontierEric Ambler's first novel is fun, playful, energetic and absolutely revolutionary.
In this novel he predicted the might and seductory qualities of nuclear weapons (in the early 1930s) and parodies the entire thriller genre at the same time.
'The Dark Frontier' also plays with the dual personality/reluctant hero theme as one of the principal narrators and the protagonist of the novel is a physicist who after suffering a brain injury ends up becoming an Über-spy.
The modern, literary spy novel owes everything to Eric Ambler's early risk taking.
Ambler's first novel was a parody of sorts and featured an odd but super-competent protagonist. It wasn't until he flipped the scenario upside down and portrayed a ordinary character trapped in extraordinary circumstances that he stumbled upon a formula that changed, and arguably pioneered, espionage fiction. This is not as smooth and satisfying of a read; fortunately, virtually all over his other novels fare better.
And, of course, he had to create the science behind his invention out of whole cloth, so it is quite anachronistic.And third, as an anachronism, a spy thriller from before World War II is a pleasant diversion from the complexities that have emerged since then, not the least of which is the nuclear specter he somewhat predicted.The fourth and final reason is the book itself: Ambler uses the tired plot device of amnesia in a delightful way -- perhaps it wasn't a cliche when he wrote this, but it still serves to reinforce the relative innocence of his time.This is a book that can be read in a single long evening, and I heartily recommend it.

But if it hadn't been for Eric Ambler the bar would have been set very low.The Dark Frontier is Eric Ambler's debut.
It was published in 1936.
The novel follows Dr. Henry Barstow as he heads to the fictional Eastern European country of Ixania.
He is the only man able to understand and determine whether or not an atomic physicist named Kassen has created a nuclear bomb.
The result was a series of highly entertaining and satisfying books that many believe set the stage for the likes of le Carre, Deighton, and, most recently, Alan Furst.Ironically perhaps, Dark Frontier (Ambler's first book) was not as much a departure from earlier works in the genre as much as it was a parody of those works.
While reading Dark Frontier after having read Ambler's later stories it struck me that by this parody perhaps he sought out to destroy the genre before recreating it.
The result is a book that is two-parts entertaining and two-parts wholly unbelievable.Dark Frontier is far from Ambler's best work.
My library branch had this one and I thought I'd see how I like Eric Ambler's writing.
I remember--very vaguely--reading A Coffin for Dimitrios back in high school, during a summer spent with Helen MacInnes, Dorothy L Sayers, and others.Dark Frontier was an enjoyable read that I raced through in an afternoon.
Dark Frontier was not great literature and must be considered what Graham Greene would have called an "entertainment." As such, it was quite good.
Without them we should never have been able to make the ideals racket pay." I also liked "Patriotism in high places is another name for personal ambition, intellectual dishonesty, and avarice."
Indeed, Mr. Ambler has had such high acclaim for his books that the likes of Greene and Le Carre have praised him as ''the greatest living writer of the novel of suspense'' and ''the well into which everybody had dipped.''As an L2 English teacher (a second language English teacher) it was awesome to see some British suspense writers of the likes of Ambler and Seymour as well as some classic literature writers such as Dickens, Pasternak, DH Lawrence and others on the level six list.
It's excellent reading for some high end students where they would get to read some great thriller stories as well as some modern classics which would be otherwise almost impossible for them.
Physicist Henry Barstow is on holiday when he meets the mysterious Simon Groom, a representative for an armaments manufacturer.
Only after suffering a blow to the head – which muddles his brain into believing he is Conway Carruthers, international spy – does the physicist agree to visit Ixania.
Barstow, however, quickly recognizes that Groom has a more sinister agenda, and Carruthers is the only man who can stop him.
Setting out to parody old-fashioned spy novels, Ambler established his trademark style in The Dark Frontier.
Since Ambler set out to “parody old-fashioned spy stories, the convoluted plot and caricature characters were his intent.
Of course many people like him very much, and I bought about half a dozen of his books for a half dollar each recently, so I'll have a chance to dig in more and see what I'm missing.In this one he does play a fine post-modern riff on readers' expectations for spy novels and mysteries, and has his main character assume the persona of a dashing James Bond type.
Ambler is in fact well known for his fully ordinary characters - no omni-competent all-heroic world-savers in his books.
The father of the modern spy thriller according to Le Carré, Eric Ambler was a wonderful writer. This was his first book and is wonderfully engaging. Written in 1936, it's plot anticipates the coming nuclear age, as a slightly batty professor takes on the arms industry in a fictional Eastern European country. A little clunky in parts, as you'd expect from a first novel, it is still an excellent read. Had only read a couple of his better known stories before but now look forward to reading more.
I love Ambler ... everyone does whether they know it or not. He is the intellectual grandparent of James Bond and Rick Blaine of Casablanca etc etc. This is his first book, and the author hasn't quite yet found his bold feet. The hero is literally split between a couple Joe everydays and a super hero. In future books all traces of the super hero will disappear leaving only average guys to fight government conspiracies. This really needs to be updated and made a movie!
The first novel from one of the first writers of detective fiction. What I thought was most interesting about this book is that it's centered around the making of an atomic bomb ... and was published in the 1930s ... when atomic bombs were still very much theory and not reality.

Ambler is credited by some as the father of the modern thriller, so I wanted to go way back and read this, his very first book.
The book was such a good read that I want to read the rest of his books.
As a bonus, the copy of the book that I found--the only in our Roanoke Valley (VA) library system--was a large-print version re-printed in 1977 in England.
I have long resisted reading large-print books, but this one worked just fine and convinced me that at my age (69) maybe it's time to use these versions when available!
Eric Ambler's career, famous for its reinvention of the spy genre, appropriately began with a spoof of the field.
In this one, a physicist in need of a good vacation reads a bad thriller and after hitting his head in the course of a car accident, believes himself to be superspy Conway Carruthers – just before he is swept up in a genuine intrigue surrounding a nuclear weapons program in a small Balkan country.The premise is hokey, and a bit after the midpoint the story seemed to me to read more like the stories it was playing off of than a parody of them, but on the whole Dark Frontier holds up surprisingly well, long after many of the writers he parodied (like E.
Phillips Oppenheim) have passed into obscurity.
Eric Ambler's first novel is about a fictitious and authoritarian Balkan country in which a scientist has secretly invented an atomic bomb. Written in 36, this novel forecast that developments. Arms merchants travel there to steal the invention and the government wants to use it for aggressive purposes. Trying to prevent that is an amnesiac British scientist which add a humorous touch. By no means Ambler's best but you see in it many of the elements that would mark his best.
I like Eric Ambler's pre-WW II espionage novels, so when I saw this at the local library book sale, I picked it up. It turns out to be his first novel, which he describes as a parody. In it, a mild-mannered professor has a car accident and is mysteriously, and temporarily, transformed into a dashing international adventurer intent on saving the world. The book reads like a standard action thriller, albeit a not very interesting one. Don't bother.
The first Ambler spy thriller? Written in the 1930's and anticipating nuclear destruction, set in a fictitious Eastern Europe country, the pace is slow and more character study. There's a delicious passage where he describes the protagonist making his way through the hills and forests, following power lines, to find the hidden laboratory. The Countess could be played by anyone resembling Dita Von Teese or Bebe Neuwirth. I'll be reading more.
I really liked it. I've got to say that it wasn't the first book by Eric Ambler I read and still, it was very entertaining.I love the psychological approach the author used in playing with different perceptions and roles in life.For me the ending was a bit too violent, so only 4 out of 5 from me.Still a very good read!
I always like to read an authors first novel. This one is interesting, as it has many elements Ambler carries into later books, but is so obviously a young man's attempt. Almost funny, but also prescient and a hint of what is to come when Ambler comes into his own. The dramatic finish is just a hoot!
Chi cerca un thriller d'azione dai ritmi concitati di quelli che balzano in testa alle classiche di vendita non legga questo libro. Quello che si trova qui � un'affascinante atmosfera anni '30, un po' mitteleuropea e un po' stile "orient express", una scrittura elegante e ricercata forse anche grazie alla traduzione di Manganelli.
I started and gave up because it is just silly. The beginning is so promising that the bump on the head trip to Zovgorad quickly descends into the goofy. No amount of nostalgia could persuade me to go on with it.
Thriller parody as a professor type imagining himself a secret agent tries to stop the development of atomic bomb technology in a small eastern european country.
See my review at: my link text
Readers must consider the publication standards of the 30's when this was written. You read the story many times since modern authors tend to borrow and spice it up again.
Written before the end of WW2 this book eerily predicted the development of nuclear warfare and the implications of such weaponry.
