At least there's usually some attempt to develop the characters beyond cliched stereotypes of "bad boy" and the "sluts" he uses and casts aside before the "virginal heroine" comes along.
The message couldn't be more clear: Rule is a bad boy for sleeping around with lots of different women, but the women in question are all tramps, sluts and whores.
If you're the heroine, then you're virginal and holier-than-thou; if you're a whore, then you're probably a cheerleader.
I'm not sure why it's a bad thing if a woman knows she looks good and doesn't go home to stick her finger down her throat*.
There is absolutely no doubt in my mind that Jay Crownover is incredibly talented with the unique gift of expressing herself through a great story.
Her words are incredibly well written, but the lack of punctuation was like giving me this amazing gift without a way to open it.
The perfect sexually charged progression of Rule and Shaw's relationship was worth it.
I see so much potential in Rule that if I had the money I would personally invest to have this story edited in the way it should have been.
I usually let grammar and editing slide as long as it doesn't distract from the story, but here?
"Opposites don’t just attract. They freaking catch fire and burn the entire city down.”  I want to give this book more than 5 stars!!! Loved it!Ladies and gentleman... let me introduce you to RULE ARCHER   My struggle came with the fact that Rule was complicated. He was brash, mouthy, careless, thoughtless, and often cranky and generally an insufferable pain in the ass. But when he chose to be, he was also charming and funny, artistically brilliant and more often then not, the most person in
Rules parents and older brother Rome love Shaw.
She loves everything about Rule and it drives her crazy that his parents don’t see all the wonderful in him.
And it will change everything....You see this story through the eyes of Rule and Shaw, with the dual povs.
Rule and Shaw have a lot of obstacles to overcome in their relationship.I knew I would love Rule Archer from the very start of this book!
Loved his interactions with Rule and Shaw, he was such a sweet guy.
Ayden, Nash, and Cora were all good friends and were there for Rule and Shaw when they need them.
That's   Rule Archer  He’s also  arrogant and explosive, he  treats women like crap  because too many of them let him get away with it for a long time after his brother's demise, but he was doing it all locked inside this bubble that none of those who loved him could get through.
He's cold and unreachable...But then all of a sudden, there were cracks and the robot version of himself he had as a front started to fade away...Because of one  girl...Their family buffer.The girl who's always there to fetch him the morning after screwing different women every night.The girl who has always thought that he's worthy and in need of love even when he did his absolute best to convince the rest of the world he isn't interested in being loved.The same girl who had loved him ever since she first laid eyes on him......
I feel like the external issues in both Rule and Shaw's lives brought a lot of dimension to the story.
And I also loved that even though the focus of the book was clearly on Rule and Shaw, the few pages that each other character graced were enough to connect me to them and have me interested in their lives as well.
The book ended in such a way that it totally wrapped up Rule and Shaw's story but left me curious and intrigued to read on in the series and find out about the other guys' stories.You know, it's funny but I guess sometimes you can get spoiled reading a lot of really great books and after those it's sometimes hard to find another one that you really love.

Rule is my weakness in New Adult.
I love a hero who can be a bit of an arsehole but underneath has an ample amount of redeeming qualities.
I loved their back story, their rich, complex, and tragic history because it gave them both so much room to grow.
Jay did a fantastic job on character arc and journey with Rule because this is a true coming of age story for both Rule and Shaw.
Add in sizzling chemistry, passion, suspense and a wonderful crew of secondary characters and you’ve got the very best New Adult has to offer.
I LOVED every minute!
4.5-4.75 StarsMeet Rule Archer. He is my latest book boyfriend crush.  I loved Rule like it was my mission in life. I loved him like it was inevitable…  So the first thing I noticed right away is the cover. It’s gorgeous and I could not say no to a guy who looked like that. I mean, have you seen him? He’s gorgeous! And those tattoos? Total fucking SWOON!! YUMMY. After I finished this book, I had to Google more tattooed hotties. I engulfed this book. I just couldn’t stop reading. Today was my day
No, Shaw, not one because they weren’t fucking you; ever since you walked out on Sunday all I’ve been thinking of is you.” 
Shaw Landon has loved Rule Archer since she first laid eyes on him.
This story between Rule and Shaw was one I couldn’t put down.
Two: The separation between Rule and Shaw towards the end seemed a little drawn out.
Aside from that, I really enjoyed this and I cannot wait for the next book that stars Ayden and Jet. But for now, I know I’ll be thinking about Rule, his tattoos and his piercings (**Blushes**) for a long time to come ;)
We get to be introduced by the sexy, tattoo artist named Rule here-- a guy who grew up with family issues because of the tragic history that happened to his twin brother Remy.
Then there is this girl named Shaw, a medical college student who always had a thing for Rule since she was 14.
Like, how Shaw is much better in bed than his previous one-night-stand girls, and how she's even sexier.
All throughout the book I was groaning inwardly or rolling my eyes because she's such a love sick woman who is willing to cross everything just to be with Rule and it's just not right.
Be warned: The English language will never be the same I got up to 30% and honestly, this is my absolute limit. This thing (which I refuse to call a book) has to be deleted off the face of cyberspace or any other space that it may inhabit.Author, you may have great ideas (that I doubt but will never know for sure, as even I'm not that masochistic to make myself finish this thing). What you obviously don't have, however, is an editor. This piece of shit 'literature' so desperately screams with t

Why the hell did i read even most of this? SO BAD AND SO STUPID AND SUCH A BAD MESSAGE. I am not even going to rate this, and I will deny reading it to my grave.
In fact, I’ve sworn you’d have to drag me kicking and screaming into this genre… There’s just way too much drama, too many misunderstandings, more angst than my head and heart can stand… The thing is, at 53 years old, I’ve lived through that pain myself, and having a 33 year old daughter, I lived through her living through it, too.
The drama, the angst, the bickering, the unaccepting parents… yep, I lived through that crap and don’t want to read about it in my romance escapism!But that said, there was something different about Rule.
★★★☆ 3.5 Stars!I guess this was another one of those  "I liked it but didn't love it"  type of books, mainly because there was so much:Maybe my expectations were a bit too high or maybe I just wasn't really in the mood for the constant angst/tension that was happening in this book, but I wasn't as invested in the story as I was hoping to be.Don't get me wrong; there were some definite 4 star-worth scenes. There was an interesting back story, fun side characters, alternating POV's, a feisty heroi
But now it seems as if I've read so many NA "good girl falls for tortured man-whore hero" stories that it takes a lot for me to be blown away by one...
"Me and this girl spent too much time trying to be too many different things for too many wrong reasons for too many other people, now it was just up to us to be ourselves for each other and love each other for all the right reasons."♥
I don't usually do "casting" but I couldn't resist this time.Rule Shaw I didn't know what to expect going into this one, but I'm so glad I took a chance on it.I loved Rule and Shaw. They were great characters. They were both battling some hard won demons, but managed to stay so appealing. Rule is a hot bad boy. In some ways he reminded me of Brian from Rock Me.

I didn't know what to expect going into this one, but I'm so glad I took a chance on it.I loved Rule and Shaw.
Where he could care less what anyone thinks, Shaw spends her life trying to please everyone else.
Shaw and Rule have been connected for years though her relationship with his twin brother Remy.
Three years after Remy's death, Shaw finally has the opportunity to have the one thing she has always wanted, just for her.
Rule.What follows was a beautiful story of two people finally growing up.
"I'm going to love you Shaw." Her eyes crinkled at the sides.
All right!!! That book was freakin' A.W.E.S.O.M.E.!!!! I'm so glad that i read it, but so sad that i didn't do it earlier!!!Oh, my Gosh!!! That book was mind blowing...I thought i was about to catch fire when Rule and Shaw were together in the same room, even though the things between them didn't seem so good in the beginning!!!But what i liked more than the sexiness and the steamy hot atmosphere was all the background story and not only that...Did i mention that i love Rule???? Or that i love
That book was mind blowing...I thought i was about to catch fire when Rule and Shaw were together in the same room, even though the things between them didn't seem so good in the beginning!!!But what i liked more than the sexiness and the steamy hot atmosphere was all the background story and not only that...Did i mention that i love Rule????
The only person that tried so hard to built a bridge between him and his family was a girl that he barely could tolerate....Shaw loved the Archer family like her own...
4.5 StarsRule was a story you pick up and don’t want to put down.
I’m always drawn to a story where unrequited love is finally returned, and Shaw has been in love with Rule since she was fourteen.
Adding to the excitement, is a stalker ex boyfriend who won’t take no for an answer.
I loved Rule like it was my mission in life.
I loved him like it was inevitable, like no matter how many times I was shown what an awful idea it was, what a bad match we were, what a callous asshole he could be I coul
I’m always drawn to a story where unrequited love is finally returned, and Shaw has been in love with Rule since she was fourteen.
Shaw has been fixture in the Archer family since she was fourteen and Remy took her under his wing, but it’s always been Rule she’s been in love with.
She picks Rule up every Sunday for brunch with the family to make sure he goes.
Rule has no idea that Shaw has loved him so long.
Knowing Shaw had feelings for Rule for ages made my heart break for her.
Shaw was his brother's best friend and Rule put her firmly on the off limits section.
After it's all said and done, I was pleasantly surprised to read Rule bring the initial pursuer :) Dear Rule, however, is also learning to be in a relationship and goes about coping with his feelings in a very bad way.
I wasn't a fan of Rule's methods for coping, which consisted largely of ignoring Shaw or trying to change into what he thinks she wants, but it felt like a part of his flaws.
I liked Shaw and her big heart.
This family had Rome, the eldest and keeper of them all in line; with Remy the "good, amiable, peace-keeper twin and Rule fulfilling the slot of difficult, stubborn, marching to his own drum and banging it loudly.
and no matter how many times Shaw explained to the family, Remy and her were Not lovers, just the very best of friends...
she only knows she has goals and the one she dreams of and thinks will never happen is Rule.This book was a eye opener for me...
so when Shaw and Rule finally connect the way everyone around them knows they should have years ago....
Their mom is practically batshit crazy now because she's (as Shaw says) rewriting an imaginary history wherein Rule is the villain.
She has been in love with Rule ever since she was 13.
One night, sparks fly and suddenly, Rule is looking at her in a different way.
Rule knows that a relationship with Shaw changes everything and she couldn't be just one of "those girls".
On the other hand, Shaw has been struggling because she couldn't tell Rule that she loved him...
Rule's mom admitted something in the end and that made a whole lot of a difference for my Rule.
“It all starts and ends with you for me.” I loved this book. I really loved it so much! It was just my favorite kind of romance. Emotional but as realistic and convincing as it can be, nothing cheesy or over the top! The characters were well-written and the dialogues were superb. I rarely like a heroine in a book because I always want them to act like I would, but usually, they don’t :)As a matter of fact, the heroine in this book, Shaw, didn’t act the way I would because I don’t know if I can
I rarely like a heroine in a book because I always want them to act like I would, but usually, they don’t :)As a matter of fact, the heroine in this book, Shaw, didn’t act the way I would because I don’t know if I can be that good in situations like she faced but the way she acted, thought and spoke made me adore her and I loved her dearly.
Shaw, on the other hand, has been in love with Rule since she was 13 and she watched him go from one girl to another, tortured herself and she cannot be in a stable relationship because she can never get over him.

I love a book like that!Before I go on, I need to mention...
But there is no denying, he rules in every sense of the word;'Slang; To be excellent or superior' and 'To dominate by powerful influence', where Shaw is concerned.
The book is super hot and the sexual chemistry between Shaw and Rule is scrumptious!
This was a great read!
Since this book came out for-ev-ah ago...
and because I'm a wee bit pressed for time at the moment, I am not going to do a full review of this book.What I will say is we've got the H, Rule (I mean, c'mon...
I mean, 'nuff said because we all know how that just wets my whistle...Loved this book...
loved the characters (even Shaw who I worried would grate on my nerves)...
looking forward to reading more in this series by Jay Crownover!
Really liked this one, kinda got me back onto my book Not a big fan of too many tattoos…. But Rule worked for me.Good solid read.
(Granted Rule doesn't smoke but he's tatted up the wazoo so this pic is closer to how I envisioned than the cover)Yes.Hmm...He's everything I love when reading a hero, he's a bad boy, doesn't mind scrapping when the time calls, tattooed, pierced!
Was it an epic love story?
But pretty close.What sold me was the more realistic approach Shaw and Rule had to there issues.
(Kinda like Shaw saw past Rule’s tattoos and piercings.)Meet Rule Archer...pierced, tattooed, explosive personality, man-whore, loyal, hard-worker, black sheep of his family and newest addition to my book boyfriend list.
He was one hell of a character and I just LOVED him!!!Meet Shaw Landon...beautiful, medical school bound, daugther of prominent parents and longtime Archer family friend.
I truly enjoyed Rule’s pov and how he handled being in his first relationship and all the feelings that accompanied it.This story had all of the ingredients that I enjoy in a book: angst, drama, a good story line, interesting secondary characters and of course LOVE.
What can be sweeter than a story about two people (soul mates) who finally find a way to make each other whole.Meet Tattooed, misunderstand Rule and beautiful, strong shaw.
*sigh* I don't think I've read a book with so many amazingly named characters (Rule, Shaw, Remy, Rome, Jet, Ayden) need I go on ...
- give it a bashAm I in love with a fictional character once again - sigh!Will I ever tire of Romance - NEVERRead the blurb for the book it says it all.4 bad boy tattoos stars.Ps author can we please have a story about Rome?
***4.5 Opposites Attract Stars***  "Rule, if this goes bad it's gonna be so, so bad.""True, but if it's good it's gonna be so very, very good."  Before I start my review, I just want to say that I don't typically (ok, ever) do casting for books. Mainly, because I suck at it. BUT when I saw a picture of this guy, I just thought...OMG this is my Rule!!! Alright, back to the matter at hand. Shaw comes from a rich, well to do and politically powerful family. They expect her to live her life a certai
However, Shaw's heart lies with Rule, Remy's moody, broody black sheep of the family twin brother.
Rule has never seen Shaw outside of his family gatherings, and when he runs into her at her job as a waitress in a scantily clad uniform, his interest is piqued.
Both Shaw and Rule make mistakes, but understanding where they're coming from helped ease what could have been a very frustrating progression in an already bumpy road.
Shaw convinced herself that she just truly wasn't Rule's type and will treasure whatever time she has with him, being happy having been with him at all.
4.5-5 PASSIONATE STARSMeet the tattooed, pierced, bad boy- Rule Meet the girl that tries to be whatever anyone wants them to be, the girl that wants to be loved unconditionally the way she loves every one else...
The one that has loved Rule since day 1, Shaw.Okay.
And ever since she saw Rule for the first time- she knew she was a goner.
So Shaw was forced to watch Rule sleep with one girl after another and it hurt her ever single time.Until one day when Rule finally sees Shaw for what she is.
I loved this book <3
I am sooooooo late to the Marked Men party it's ridiculous. This has been on my tbr list for so long I don't know why it took me so long to finally read it. I think it was the cover. Not really a fan of it. But the best part of being late to read a series? I now have 4 books just sitting there that I don't have to wait to be released. Winner!
Actual rating: 0.5/5 disappointing starPlot/SettingIn my opinion, the main characters, aka Rule and Shaw, had way too much more conversations in bed during sex than anywhere "normal." Typically that doesn't bother me in New Adult books, but this one definitely goes out of control on those scenes.
I needed to control my instant desire to put some commas in it all the time.CharactersI used to love bad boys; however, the kind like Rule is too peculiar to accept.
Although it has a high average score of 4.17/5 unbelievable stars, I wasn't able to capture the meaningful essence in Rule and Shaw's story.
