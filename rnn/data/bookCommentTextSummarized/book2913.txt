American Kid Shoots for Mars, Winds Up in OzOr, you could entitle this book "Magic's Lethal Labor Lost".
This is quite a good one in which we find three strands that, of course, all wind up meeting at the end.
The third strand is the one in which Speedy, nephew of an inventor back on Long Island, New York, boards a rocket supposed to take him to Mars with said uncle, but misfires, leaves uncle, and winds up turning around and boring through quite a bit of terra firma into a weird underground kingdom, where he meets a golden princess.
After having read 24 Oz books, I think I am qualified to say that there are, basically, two different kinds of Oz stories: (i) one or more established Oz characters go on a journey and have adventures, and (ii) a child from the U.S. is transported to Oz and has adventures and meets up with Oz characters.
This story is a combination of both.
And Speedy, a kid from the U.S., rockets into Oz. The combination of the two Oz story-types into one, however, does not make this an outstanding Oz story.
I still have the usual complaints about Thompson's Oz stories.
Ruth Plumly keeps the Oz delights coming with puns and a nicely woven plot. Plus, a horse chestnut transforms into a chestnut horse. What more can you ask?
Nowhere close to the charm, magic, and inventiveness of the originals. These books should not be considered Oz canon.
