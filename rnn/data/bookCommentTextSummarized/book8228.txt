And yet he is proven right as events unfold, and the tribe holds a grudging respect for him.The British meanwhile are upsetting the governance structure of the traditional African tribe by appointing local Paramount Chiefs who will be tow their line.
Where the opening of a new road between the fighting Umuaru and Okperi is considered progress to the British, the Igbo walking that road feel like “a grain of maize in an empty goatskin bag.” Ezeulu’s fate, not unlike the Okonkwos in the first two novels of this trilogy, is destined not only to fall under the weight of the British occupation but to see that fall exacerbated by the ignorance and prejudices of his own people.
Instead, Achebe has told the story of a completely different family, in no way related to the Okonkwos (can we say that?).
Brilliant work, as usual.The book explores the rigidity of religion and how it can destroy people.
While the British patted themselves on the back on how good a job they were doing for the locals, they were slowly and steadily destroying an entire civilisation, preventing it from progressing on its own in a way more suited to the local environment.But despite the exploration of all these overarching themes, the core of the book remains the story - as it should be.
Better than 'Things fall apart' in some aspects. Includes some beautifully crafted passages.
Bureaucracy, too plays it’s part:The fault of our Administration is that they invariably appoint the wrong people and set aside the advice of those of us who have been here for years (Winterbottom p.110)As Achebe has said, My politics is concerned with universal communication across racial and cultural boundaries as a means of fostering respect for all people….
Davvero?Simple sayings of great wisdom, old wives’ tales, and idiomatic expressions which are found in Things Fall Apart are repeated throughout Arrow of God;..
I had a fiendishly difficult time with this book, which I found odd because Things Fall Apart was like reading water, and even A Man of the People was engaging and straightforward.
But although I loved what Achebe did in Arrow of God, I had a really hard time actually reading the damn thing.
I'm pretty sure that the fault was with me - I don't know enough about the Igbo, I find proverbs irritating, my brain is lately in other places - because I could sense some of the power of the novel, but was ultimately unable to experience it.
It was like reading a book through a shop window.

More notes are available on my blog For Unofficial Use Only.Arrow of God Notes:-Humor that the English think they understand the people, but they still don't despite prolonged presence...parallels to our presence in Iraq and Afghanistan- Advantages of living near the infrastructure- In direct rule seeks lighter hand by default...goal is more to maintain a status quo of peace- Comments on missionary role by Capt W?- Influence of infrastructure on Igbo...shifting from a language group to an identity- with regards to religion, subtleties in the region...a priest chief is not necessarily a medicine man.
Στο τρίτο μέρος της αφρικανικής τριλογίας αλλάζουμε εντελώς σκηνικό και μεταφερόμαστε σε ένα άλλο χωριό της γης των Ίμπο, σε μία Νιγηρία όπου οι λευκοί έχουν τον πλήρη έλεγχο της κατάστασης αλλά ακόμα δεν έχουν επιβληθεί πολιτισμικά σε κάθε γωνιά της.
Αυτό όμως που μένει στο τέλος είναι η περιγραφή αυτού του τρόπου ζωής που χάθηκε, με υπέροχες περιγραφές των εθίμων, με πολύ ενημερωτική αναφορά στην νοοτροπία τους και φυσικά με ακόμα περισσότερες παροιμίες των Ίμπο.
Achebe describes it thus: “It is an enrichment of the old story of Africa in its initial struggle for its land and mind against the ruthless invaders from the West.” (p.11)The white men who have come to Nigeria have not changed much from the district commissioner, George Allen (from Things Fall Apart) whose book The Pacification of the Primitive Tribes of the Lower Niger is required reading for Arrow of God’s Captain Winterbottom.
This book is hard to like at times. Achebe is very unflattering to women.
The English are trying to implement their divide and conquer strategy to reinforce their power and control over the locals.
Meanwhile Ezeulu the local Chief Priest tries to resist but is also the victim of his own culture and the prejudices between people and villages.
As well as some beautiful prose, Igbo stories and beliefs and of course plenty of racism and sexism.
Achebe's three books in this series all have similar themes and collectively they plant the seeds of the chaos that will come when centre old cultures are forced to disown and devalue their traditional beliefs and are ruled by strangers.
This book was a real chore for me - I have previously read Things Fall Apart and thought it was wonderful and so when my sons African Literature class was reading this book I decided to read along with the last volume of Achebe's trilogy.It really is a lot of the same thing - the clash of traditional Nigerian culture with the British Colonial culture.
I understand why his first book in the trilogy won all the awards because by the time we get to this volume the book has a tired feeling to it.
Chinua Achebe makes us Africans proud.With limited African literature, and writers to boot, I always relish coming across a good book with African narrative.
I believe there are many stories that remain untold from our past since we had limited means to pass on these stories.Chinua Achebe's book has touched on the culture, customs, beliefs of native Nigerian people and how their stories were intertwined with the arrival of "white men" in early 20th century.
He offered two different perspectives as he was telling his story, that of the native people and of the white men.
Ezeulu is the Chief Priest of Ulu, god of six Ibo villages in Eastern Nigeria in the second decade of the 20th century.
The British presence there is represented by a District Officer, Captain Winterbottom with his crew, and a Christian Mission.After a war between two villages, which Ezeulu had been trying to prevent is stopped instead by Captain Winterbottom, the Priest comes to respect the power and influence of the British.
He even sends one of his sons to learn Christianity in an effort to discover the secret of such power.The Priest's power comes from recognition by the villagers that he is their god's representative.
This year I decided to re-read some of my favorites and what I consider classics. I re-read Things Fall Apart, and in doing so I discovered that this book was a part of a trilogy, of course I had to read the entire series.Arrow of God felt a bit underwhelming for me, it also felt very repetitive at times. It was as if I was reading a lesser version of Things Fall Apart. I had a hard time remembering the characters or differentiating them. Overall this book felt very flat for me.
Reading Arrow of God felt like trodding an interminable journey.
Achebe develops characters and unfolds the plot of a story really well but parts of this novel felt disjointed and drawn out.
Also, after taking what feels like a year to finish reading Arrow of God, the ending felt a bit rushed and anti-climatic.
Imagine trodding along the journey, slowly, patiently as the events and lives of the characters unfold only to suddenly reach a point where everything changes pace and then that's it ...that's the end.
Well, that's how I felt.
The final book in Achebe's African trilogy is the story of Ezeulu, the high priest of his clan, the members of whom live in five villages in Nigeria.
As the villages are in increasing turmoil, one of Ezeula's sons dies of fever, and Ezeulu collapses mentally "in his last days, to live in the haughtly splendor of a demented high priest [which:] spared him the knowledge of the final outcome"...the outcome being the wholesale conversion of the village to Christianity.I found the prior books in the trilogy - Things Fall Apart and No Longer at East - better than The Arrow of God, though Achebe says the latter was his favourite.
This seems to be the case too with Achebe, whose first novel, Things fall apart, is always talked about and praised.
Arrow of God is more mature and dense...here Achebe is at his best, displaying great knowledge of indigenous black characters, and also the white (imperial agents) characters too.
There is a startling objectivity and detachment that one would not expect from an African (black) writer.
Yet Achebe, like he did in Things fall apart, brilliantly goes to the heart of Igbo customs and proverbs throughout this work.
Just nope.
Just nope.
I think I've seen this book regarded as a great work of literature and the author as an amazing one.
To both, I STRONGLY disagree.I hated this book and used an audiobook to make progress and a print copy to track that progress.
Using the audiobook was probably the only way I could have ever gotten through this one.
It was boring as h-e-double-hockey-sticks.
Where was the plot?
Yeah, this book ain't got none of that.
And then everyone bashes and hates on him for it the rest of the book.
Idk this book made no sense.0 stars.
This novel gives an African perspective on the colonial imposition of Western culture upon African/Igbo culture and tradition. It is a story that gives voice to the European influence and voice to the African response to it. It is a narrative that shows how this was done and the effects and consequences of the encounter. The characters of the novel are very engaging and come alive from the pen of Achebe. If you liked Things Fall Apart, then you will like the Arrow of God.
It was alright. The story-telling could have been better, for I felt that we were introduced to a lot of characters that had zero impact on the telling of the story, so that takes away a lot of the luster. Plus, the conclusion and the way the story wrapped up was just "eh, I read all of this for it to end like this?". I've heard all this regard for Chinua Achebe, but this was a bad introduction to his work.

I liked this one less than Things Fall Apart and again, I dislike his writing style.
What a delightful book. I enjoyed it a lot. A story about Ezeulu a chief priest of Ulu that bound six villages in eastern Nigeria during colonial times. He took his priesthood seriously but the new religion (Christianity) became a challenge. Well written with beautiful poetic proverbs that captivated me. I can’t believe how much more I am now enjoying these books I read with less enthusiasm as a child. Sometimes it’s only in re-reading a book that one can appreciate the beauty of that book. I definitely recommend 👍🏾
أتشيبي عندما يكتب رواية فهو يكتب مأساة لكن مليئة بتفاصيل ممتعة وثرية جداً، عندما أهدتني مشاعل روايته "الأشياء تتداعى" تعلقت بها جداً، وأعجبتني فكرتها وأحداثها، لكن هنا كانت الترجمة أفضل، والأحداث أيضا، مع بعض الأخطاء في الأسماء للأسف والتي تتغير مع الصفحات، مما لفتني أن جوز الكولا والذي تكرر في الرواية هو القورو، وهذا اسمه المعروف في الحجاز لانتشار المهاجرين الأفارقة، معرفة ذلك أمر لطيفا حقيقة ...هذه المرة النهاية لم تفاجئني، كنت أتوقع حدوث مأساة، للمبالغة في إدانة الاستعمار، بعد إدانة الذات أيضا في نفس الوقت
The inner doubts of Ezeulu, his relationships with his family and friends and with the white man are fascinating to follow.
And victims, but that is adressed sort of, through the daughter who runs away from her husband back to Ezeulu's house, and through numerous mentions of the colonizers "taking natives to their bed" (in citation because clearly, what they mean is raped).The characters have such depth, mostly described through their actions and not inner monologue, and also everyone's relationships to eachother are crisply elocuted.
Just, a really really good read.
It was already my favorite of the trilogy and then on the final page came this...that no man however great was greater than his people.....
Your student of postcolonialism can have a field day with this.
Bizarrely, this was good companion viewing for reading Arrow of God. In both we have aging Patriarchs coming to terms with their own mortality, while trying to bring up their families traditionally in the face of a rapidly changing world.
Tony is head of one of the five families, while Ezuela is the Chief Priest of the Six Villages.
Does the same happen to Tony?
While Ezuela is a little less of an anti hero than Tony, you get the impression he's done some things that would be seen as pretty nasty in the name of Ulu over his lifetime.
I enjoyed Arrow Of God perhaps more than I would have done given this helpful timing.
This disintegration provides a crack in the wall that becomes a house for the lizard of foreign religion and culture.
There is a conflict between the old and new, between past and present, and between native and foreign; the novel revolves around this conflict.However, the novel does not just present the tragic fall of a man, who is an arrow of god (or God), it is also the tragic fall of an (or the) African god.
It is this fall that leads to the rise of the foreign God.In a way, the didacticism of the novel is not just intended for man, but also for the gods (and God).
