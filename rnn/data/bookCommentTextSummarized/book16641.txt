This book made me want to throw it against the wall in anger and disbelief.  It made me root for the death of a child (and then despise myself), love a hated character, cry angry tears, and bite my nails because of all the suspense.**Pictograhically, all of the above was happening to me.**I did not throw the book across the room. Instead, I put it aside and stared at the wall for a few minutes in grief and disbelief. If you read this, you know which part I am talking about *SOBBING* Then I pick

Look at you, all innocent, before this book rips into you...A Storm of Swords is, in my opinion, an undisputed high point of the series so far.

it's not like you could do a better job at trying to SAVE THE ENTIRE WORLD FROM UTTER DESTRUCTION.
you seriously underestimate the most obvious "secret" villain in the world in book 3.
i know you have some bloodthirstiness in you, so let that freak flag fly in book 4 and get down to some serious villain-killing already!
(A) 88% | ExtraordinaryNotes: This is where the story explodes; two outstanding scenes highlight a truly audacious, epic and consequential volume.
In the book there were certain scenes I liked better than I did in the shows.
But, in this book there were more parts with dialogue that I really enjoyed.
My favorite in this book were the scenes between Brienne and Jaime.
I liked his parts better in the show and nooo it's not because I can look at him in the show.
I just felt like there was so much more to Brienne and Jaime's time together in the book.
But I really loved the parts where we could read Tyrion's thoughts about Sansa.
And the parts with Brienne and Jaime.

First an update on the Direwolf situation I still do not have one...sadface.This series !!! What can I say I am loving it! I don't know if I was just sick of everything else or just needed the escape but I am soooooo enjoying. The great thing is that I am on the third book and its not like I can't say which book I like better, which was weaker they are one long story that come in three(so far for me) packages.Its not like Indiana Jones.

I am not even sure he is alive,the last time we saw him he was feeling a bit stabbed under a tree and I am not puting a "spoiler tag" on that, cause if I don't know then I am not spoiling anything.
so i'm just going to whitter on about some things i like/feel like whittering about.oh, dana, i am so sorry about that thing that happens to your beloved character.oblique spoiler:(view spoiler)[i never thought i'd miss a hand so much (hide spoiler)]and in searching for that image, i rediscovered this site that has way more content than it used to, and i got sucked in for about an hour:http://arrestedwesteros.com/which led me to this, which is a book-one spoiler, so careful, uninitiated friends:(view spoiler)[ (hide spoiler)]it is worth a visit to scroll through their archives; i had me some guffaws.okay, but there were a couple of things that i didn't like in this book:(view spoiler)[number one:shea's betrayal of tyrion.
I just finished George R.R. Martin’s A Storm of Swords, and I’m getting the same feeling I did watching Liriano in the 7th inning, or watching the third season finale of Lost: the thought that I might be in the midst of something special.
I have grave doubts that Martin can finish this series, or that he can finish it with the same strength with which he started (reviews of the next book, A Feast for the Crows are not encouraging), but when I finished the last page, I certainly sensed the possibility of greatness.
In Storm, as in the other books of this series, the story is told from the alternating viewpoints of various characters.
I have loved listening to the characters evolve with this series as their fantastical world changes around them.
When you read as much as I do, it is rare to be surprised, but Mr. Martin manages to keep me guessing.While the second book had multiple kings rising to power and fighting for their piece of the Iron Throne, this book took the story in an entirely different direction.
'A Storm of Swords' completely changes the landscape of this story yet again.Aside from the fall of kings, the way the characters are presented had me rethinking my previous judgments.
When I first read A Game of Thrones  I hated Jaime Lannister.
It’s quite surprising that George R.R Martin actually changed him around like this.
Never before, with any novel, have I had my feelings of pure hatred completely collapse in on them self and turn into pity and admiration.
She needs someone to guide her and help her realise her destiny; she needs someone well versed in the game to lead her steps, and insure her politics are not completely detrimental.
It’s very difficult to actually pick a favourite because with each novel my opinions seem to change as the characters do.
I think it’s clear what my opinion of this book is.
Through books one and two, (view spoiler)[I kept wondering why Robb is the only character of the Stark family who is largely ignored – except for Rickkon, but he’s too young at this point to participate.
(hide spoiler)] Truth be told, I ignored my own advice after reading book two: if you see a bright light, don’t trust it.
(hide spoiler)] I guess there is a new, supplemental lesson: never enter into a romantic relationship with Martin.
And this series is so large that the plots from each book are already melting together.
(hide spoiler)]Martin, I am catching onto your wily ways.
THAT ENDING. OH MY FREAKING GOD. AND SANSA. WITH THE LITTLEFINGER THING.AND DANAERYS. WITH...EVERYTHING.AND TYRION. WITH THE SHAE THING. AND HIS FATHER.AND JON. WITH THE WALL. AND THE WILDLINGS. AND THE OTHERS. AND YGRITTE.AND BRAN. WITH...just kidding, no one cares about Bran.AND CATELYN. WITH HER PROBLEMS, AS THEY ARE A-PLENTY.OH MY FREAKING GOD.
Three kings contend for the throne and King Joffrey's wedding day grows near.
Can he hold the throne with Robb Stark and Stannis Baratheon nipping at his heels?Yeah, that's a woefully inadequate summary but it's not laden with spoilers, either.Here we are, the third installment of Weddings, Beddings, and Beheadings, and my favorite one so far.
The Red Wedding was pretty surprising, as was the trial by combat for Tyrion's fate.
Arya is shockingly bad ass for a preteen.One character I'm surprised I've grown to like is Jaime Lannister.
What a bastard!I'm giving this five stars with an exclamation point next to it.
Catelyn Stark: Yes, this bitch is still getting to narrate chapters, and no, she will never be held accountable for the fact that 75% of all the shit that's happening in this book is all her fault.
Early in the book, she decides to release Jaime Lannister and get Brienne to take him across the country and exchange him for Arya and Sansa (how many ways can this go wrong?
The one person who gets reanimated, and it has to be Catelyn Fucking Stark?
But apparently Cersei gets her own chapters in the next book, so I've already started making popcorn for that crazy cunt sideshow.Bran Stark: You're a warg, we get it.
Dear George R. R. Martin, No, wait! I didn't mean it! YES I DIIIIID!! Sincerely,K.
Each of us has within himself the capacity for great good, and great evil," GRRM even says (perfectly) himself, via The Guardian.I am loving this reread, and I'm loving being able to piece together theories that I completely missed in prior readings.
If you have not read the first three books in this series, and do not want to get spoiled, please do not read this portion of my review!My favorite story-arc in A Storm of Swords is, hands down, no question, Jaime's.
Sam is one of the few characters I like on the show much more than reading about in the books.
PERFECTIONFull review to come!
Now everyone she's ever loved is dead, but she remains annoying and helpless despite it all.* Arya was an endearing highborn tomboy.
He's still that, except now he's dead.* Bran was a little boy with two eyes who liked to climb.
He remains so.I keep wondering whether these books are sexist or not, which usually boils down to the question of whether or not female characters have agency.
As I wrote in a previous review, I do think these books objectify women much more than they do men, which at the very least is distinctly gynophilic (a new word I just looked up!), and probably allows some hetero men and lesbians to indulge in fantasy that many women might find demeaning.
The magic-and-monsters aspect of this fantasy comes in a little heavier than it has in past books, too.
In and of itself it would mean nothing to someone who hadn't read the first two books, but being fully ensconced in the soap opera as I am, it had great meaning....I'm really trying my hardest not to revert to spoiler masks here...so let me just say - it was like having the rug pulled out from under me, but then feeling some satisfaction upon learning that the same thing happened to my asshole neighbor - and I'll leave it at that.
While he had seen some success in his fantasy and horror stories and books, and had some work screenwriting, it was not until he set out to create this epic fantasy that his stock began to rise – his muscle car hit the nitro and fishtailed into wild success with the HBO adaptation and millions of golden dragons to line the coffers of his keep.A Storm of Swords, first published in 2000, his third in the series, is the muscle car, the biggest and fastest horse, the book where Martin, established as a success and had his readers’ attention, put the hammer down to see what this thing can do.It’s a wild ride.
كم انت عبقري يا جورج مارتن. هذا الجزء الضخم وما زالت الملحمة مستمرة. الفوضى تعم البلاد الملوك يتساقطون او يتغيرون كما يتم تغيير الملابس.ما زال الشمال يزداد بؤسا بعد وكبار رجالاته يتفرقون في البلاد او يقتلون.الخطر قادم من وراء الجدار هل يستجيب الملوك لهذا الخطر ام يستمر صراعهم وتشتتهم.التنين بدأ يكبر والأطماع باسترداد العرش يكبر مع نمو التنانين.أتمنى ان يتم ترجمة الجزء الرابع بسرعة لنتمكن من المتابعة
THAT ENDING.... The middle. .. The beginning.... THAT ENDING. WHAT WHAT JUST HAPPENED.
Como me suele pasar con los libros que me gustan mucho; intencionalmente atraso la lectura todo lo que puedo porque NO ME LOS QUIERO TERMINAR.No sé si será mi favorito de la saga, pero 'Tormenta de espadas' hasta ahora ha sido el que más me ha hecho emocionar.
Pero tranquilos, que si creían que ya todos los misterios se habían revelado, PUES NO, que acá nos dejan mil más abiertos (y ese epílogo que es para morir de angustia).De forma objetiva, 'Tormenta de espadas' es el libro más equilibrado de los tres de la saga: el drama, la acción, el crecimiento de los personajes, la fantasía, la narrativa, es que tengo que meter todo en el mismo saco porque todo está en las perfectas dosis.
Second read on 19/03/2016 - 26/04/2016 I haven't been reading as much as I would like to these days. Aside from this series, which is more of a commitment than anything else, I rarely reach for other books. Perhaps it's because I'm reading nonfiction, but I rarely feel enthusiastic about reading. So far the reading year hasn't been amazing. And I don't think it has to do with the books, but my inability to enjoy them as I used to. Nevertheless, I've noticed that all the books I've re-read recen
There are so many loose ends and no guarantee that they'll ever be tied off.The hope that Martin will complete the series before his death is contagious, but as time passes, I'm beginning to realise how completely unrealistic it is.
The first time I read these I barely liked any of the characters, but now for whatever reason, I can appreciate most of them and it's sort of refreshing.I rarely make updates for these books like I used to and in my reviews I hardly discuss the plot.
I feel like a lot have things have changed since the first time I read this, but my love for it remains.
Okay, not really. There's still a shit-ton more pages after this.
I enjoyed this 3rd book in the Ice and Fire cycle where we see Martin's writing mature and his character development deepen. There are lots of memorable moments here and it is mostly the subject of S03 and part of S04 of the associated HBO TV show. I preferred it to its two predecessors but enjoyed the last two books even more.
Several aspects of this book make me want to give it only one star, several push me to rate it closer to the opposite end of the spectrum.
In the end, some characters such as Gregor Clegane and the Mad King Aerys must be left demonized without the reader ever getting a glance at a human side to them.Martin also creates several intriguing religions and passingly hints and a few philosophical quandaries.
Despite its flaws, the book makes me want to keep reading the series.
I hope to see the characters, religions, and budding quandaries developed in greater depth in the next book.
(P.S. I say that with love) This book takes some of the more, shall we say "unsavoury" characters in the series and lets you see into their motivations.
His father and sister want him dead, and he's stripped of all the power that made his character so delightfully cheeky and smarmy in the first two books.
I am hoping he is finally starting to grow a pair, it seems like he might be toward the end of the book.Daenerys was the only character who seemed to do well, despite the usual betrayals she emerges relatively unscathed.
However, Martin also pulls off some pretty stunning scenes that would stand proud even without introduction.Arya's storyline continues to steal the show, and I especially enjoyed reading about her fighting (view spoiler)[beside the Hound, even though she "prayed for him to die, hundreds and hundreds of times." (hide spoiler)] I will admit that I found Daenerys' plot a little dull in the first two novels, but I love how she outwits the slavers across the Narrow Sea in this entry.
Perhaps then I'll be able to say with more confidence that A Storm of Swords is the best entry in George R.R. Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire series.
As I concluded in my review of A Game of Thrones,… a lot of people build up an idea about this book in their minds, and when it fails to conform to that idea, they become disillusioned and kick it to the curb.Martin's grim approach to his fantasy actually makes finding meaning in "the struggles and the triumphs of the characters" possible.
If you really want to know, though … I wouldn't mind seeing Daenerys on the Iron Throne.After a disappointing story in A Clash of Kings, Daenerys returns in A Storm of Swords and kicks ass.
