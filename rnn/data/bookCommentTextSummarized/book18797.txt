I don't know if there is really such a thing as a "British sense of humour" but I've enjoyed a bunch of British chick lit/humour with similar MCs - Bridget Jones, Confessions of Georgia Nicholson - so maybe there's a pattern here with my tastes.If you're considering this book but think you're a shameless unromantic like me, DO NOT read any quotes from it.
But there's a great balance between the funny and the serious, so the latter never becomes too much.This book made me feel all the emotions without seeming to try too hard.
I know I should probably let my emotions settle before reviewing but I want to get all the feelings down...Firstly I want to say that the cover does not do this book justice.
I enjoyed the first person POV, and the odd change in character thrown in stirred the narrative nicely for me.
I can't remember when I last finished a story that had tied me up in so many emotional knots and still left me completely satisfied with having read it.
And when the author in addition is touted as the winner of multiple romance novel awards your primal male instinct is to run like your being chased by some primordial predator.So it was really against my instinct and better judgement that I began reading this book.
Having personally cared for a handful of terminal people over a period of years, I feel I can safely say that many of the thoughts on serious aquired disabities and the quality of life is fairly realistic, and though the romance part can't avoid a bit of Hollywood-sheen, it never really gets unbelievable, and helps the reader engage him/herself in the characters and thus in their horrible dilemma.Thoroughly engaging and thought provoking, this is the best book I've read so far this year (and I so did not see it coming).
Did anyone else notice that the ultimate message of this book is that a disabled life is not worth living, even despite a caring family, endless wealth, the best medical care, and (by the end of the book) a devoted, loving romantic partner?
For a while I was enjoying the story, but by the end I was deeply distressed about the moral and ethical implications of the book's ending.
The book juxtaposes an adventurous, athletic, and sexually active lifestyle with life in a wheelchair - and decides that life in a wheelchair is not worth living.
My video review & discussion on this incredible book! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbgM4... This was one of the best books I have ever read. So good that it makes me want to lower the ratings of all of the other books I have read just so that this (and maybe Clockwork Princess) is the only book with a 5-star rating. I can't properly describe right now how exactly this book moved me and made me analyze my own thoughts, as I am still currently crying, but just know that it did. Absolutely wonderful.
Despite being a bit predictable, I adored this book. I love the characters, and I sort of want to pick it back up and read it again. I could have easily flown through this book in a day (if I'd had time), but I'm glad I took my time with it. I really got to know the characters, and I really liked the ending, and how it contrasted the beginning of the story. SO BEAUTIFUL.
This book showed love and it's beautiful nature but also the harsh reality of life.Totally sobbed at the end...thinking about filming a review because I have a lot to say about this book.Very well done, heartbreakingly so
I have different reasons for disliking it.Like a lot of people, I cried at the end of this book, but unlike probably most, not out of sadness, but out of anger.
Is it really better to never settle than try to actually be happy with what you have?"The thing is, I get that this could be a good life.
Because: Don't settle.Now, I'm not claiming to even remotely be able to imagine what Will must feel like or how difficult his life is - but there are thousands of people out there, who live very difficult lives and still manage to be happy or at least try.
But the more they spend time together, the more Louisa discovers the wonders that life has to offer.I read Me Before You, expecting to discover the most poignant love story on earth.But I found something else instead.
With him by her side, she gains confidence, determination, learns not to let anyone dictate her actions and finally realizes what is best for her.She needs him in her life, even though she doesn’t know it, and he relishes in her presence.
Maybe you don’t like chick literature or maybe you never read adult books.I’m here to tell you that it doesn’t matter.
Louisa is a 26 year old woman who has no motivation to do anything with her life until a man comes in and ~*~changes her~*~Oh and then of course you have to add in a little dash of sexual assault to make your main character more interesting because, you know, you can't have a good book without THAT.
It's essentially 369 pages of Louisa, an able bodied person, who decides that SHE knows when a disabled person is ready to die.
Update 9/22/2018 - Lowering this once again to 3 stars.
4 stars is too generous based on the harm this book caused to individuals with disabilities.Update 2/20/17 - Lowering my rating from 4.99 stars to 4 because while I really enjoyed this romance, after hearing how harmful this book is to individuals with disabilities, I don't feel comfortable placing a higher rating on this book.
The story was great, I loved Will & Louisa's relationship, but with the problems in medical information and how Will's story was primarily used for Louisa's gain, my feelings have most definitely changed a bit on this book.4.99 stars because the ending made me bitter xo
“You only get one life. It's actually your duty to live it as fully as possible.”Going to start this review off by saying that if you don't want to have your heart torn from your chest and crushed into a tiny little pieces then don't pick up this book. I kept seeing people say "Now this is a book", and figured it was a lot of hype. NO, NO it wasn't just a lot of hype. If you follow me on goodreads than you know all this month I've only (well mainly only) been reading books suggested to me from
After these events happen you'll more than likely be thinking the same thing I thought, "wow I know exactly where this cliche story is going to go", and just like me you'll more than likely be wrong.Lou is struggling with what and who she wants to be.
You make me happy, even when you're awful.I would rather be with you- even the you that you seem to think is diminished- than with anyone else in the world.” The plot of this story does start out slow.
I don't know when the next time will be that I get to read a love story quite like this.THIS BOOK IS A MUST READ OF MUST READS.
Just finished my re-read and all I have to say is everyone should read this book... EVERYONE SHOULD READ THIS BOOK!!! Still cried like a baby, but I love it!  Before you start this book... be prepared to cry. You will cry happy tears and sad tears. You will smile, laugh, be devastated, ugly cry, and if your like me- you will love the journey this book took you on. This is a story of two people who meet each other by chance, and change each others lives forever. LOU WILL Will used to be active. H
You will smile, laugh, be devastated, ugly cry, and if your like me- you will love the journey this book took you on.
Lou is starting to really like Will, and is pretty happy with her job.
(hide spoiler)]Will and Lou even got tattoo’s together.
Lou is falling in love with Will.
But is it enough....Will’s response to this broke my heart...(view spoiler)[ “I can't do this because I can't...I can't be the man I want to be with you.
(view spoiler)[ I wanted Will to chose to live.
4.5... Me duelen los ojos de tanto llorar.
Pages stained with tears. Used tissues. And my bruised, bleeding heart lying on the floor. I don't know how long I'll survive with a huge hole in my chest.  “I thought, briefly, that I would never feel as intensely connected to the world, to another human being, as I did at that moment.”  I thought that I would never feel as intensely connected to a book as I did while reading Me Before You. I finished it a few hours ago but I'm still crying. It feels like I've shed an ocean of tears, fat, ugly
And then he met Lou. Lou with her crazy clothes and lack of dreams invaded his life, trying to make him find beauty in simple things and adapt to his new reality, but she didn't predict that she would change as well, that she would find her place in the world and someone to really see the potential and fire in her.
I loved Lou and Will with all my heart, as individuals and as two people who fell in love when they shouldn't.
To live my life fully.
‘Tell me something good.’This review contains *spoilers*.I decided to read this book right after watching the trailer and crying, partly because Mr. Bates from Downton Abbey was there (every single time he shows up- tears start streaming down my face) and partly because the story was so moving.But I honestly did not expect this book to impact me this emotionally.I thought Me Before You was going to be another book in the pile of books similar to John Green’s The Fault In Our Stars — but they cannot even compare in my eyes.While TFIOS made me feel like an emotionless robot, Me Before You made me think and contemplate and feel so many things all at once- I cried and laughed and felt anxious and hopeful.I just can’t get over how good this book is, it’s both sad and full of life.
I think too many people were telling me how much I was going to love it and how emotional it was and that kind of set me up for failure.
It was sad, but I wasn't moved to tears and while I really did like it, I didn't love it.
Honestly I think this is one of those cases where I'm going to like the movie better than the book.
I just had a lot of trouble connecting with the characters in the book but I already felt connected to the movie characters, if that makes sense.
But sometimes, life puts you on a place for a reason and you open your mind and start seeing things that you didn’t even see before.This book will teach you to PUSH YOURSELF Lou was a normal girl in a normal city with a normal life, a normal boyfriend and a normal job.
People like Will who would push Lou to LIVE even though that would mean she wouldn't be around that much.There is NOTHING about this book I can complain about.
If I were him I might wanted to do the same but if I had someone like Lou caring for me I dont think that I would consider it like an option anymore .Well, Lou is trying to stop him from doing anything crazy and I really admire that she is the only person that hasnt lost faith on him.She has only six freaking months to change his life but she never thought that he would change her life as well .I loved Will!
Rereading!I just finished my re-read of this book. Sometimes a second trip into a book doesn't end well for me. I see things that I did not pick up the first time and I end up not liking the book anymore.That didn't happen with this book.Because guess what I'm doing? I'm sobbing. Not crying. Big ugly snot running tears.It takes a lot for a book to do this to me. There is no reason to go into what this book is about. Most everyone knows or has heard by now. The movie is soon to come out and the s
Rereading!I just finished my re-read of this book.
The movie is soon to come out and the second book is out (I have it and now I'm terrified to read it) Can anything hold up to the magic that is this book?I guess we just have to put on our big girl tights and see.
That makes ten doesn't it?First read: June 2013I remember when I was a little girl the excitement of a really good book just took me away from whatever was going on in my life.
I am so glad that I went into this book blind, choosing to read it after seeing it persist on the charts and growing curious enough to give it a go.I was awed by the author's ability to weave a story filled with humor and love, while realistically addressing the not so nice, sometimes ugly, realities of living with a disability that are rarely discussed in "polite" society.
She addressed many emotionally-charged topics, including discrimination against disabled individuals, quality of life, right to self-determination, assisted suicide and psychosocial implications, among others, in a candid manner.
This book was pretty awesome, but the ending kinda killed me😶😕

Final rating: 5/5 stars  “Hey Clark', he said.'Tell me something good'.
I stared out of the window at the bright-blue Swiss sky and I told him a story of two people.
Two people who shouldn't have met, and who didn't like each other much when they did, but who found they were the only two people in the world who could possibly have understood each other."  ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ●Life is a wonderful thing, but then again, it can also be horrible and mercil

Until the day Lou appeared in his life as his care taker for six months.
A kind person who through time reached to him and showed him that not everything is dark - that there are still choices and that life is worth living.
I'm one of those people that as soon as I hear a book is being made into a movie, I decide I should read it.
Me Before You is the story of a young girl who finds herself the caretaker of a quadriplegic man who is both charming and brash depending on the mood.
What did I think?: This is one of the most emotional books I have read in a long time, if not ever.
I absolutely can't wait for the movie, and after hearing about the casting I'm even more exciting.
Who should read it?: Are you looking for a good book?
BUT.No more or less than I would have felt if I'd read the same scenario in a book summary or a 500 word article in the local paper.I could try to isolate reasons for the disconnect, like it's told in the third person, but that feels like a cop-out--I've encountered plenty of compelling characters in third person POV books--but ultimately, Will and Lou didn't join those ranks.The end.2.
The only part of the story that didn't shriek of the uselessness of hope in the face of reality, was Lou's personal growth throughout her endeavor, which annoyingly makes me want to read AFTER YOU to see if the changes stuck, and will almost certainly be another disappointment.
A second sequel, Still Me, was published in January 2018.تاریخ نخستین خوانش: روز یازدهم ماه جولای سال 2016 میلادیعنوان: من پیش از تو؛ نویسنده: جوجو مویس (مویز)؛ مترجم: مریم فتاحی؛ تهران، آموت، 1393؛ در 536 ص؛ شابک: 9786006605425؛ موضوع: داستانهای نویسندگان انگلیسی قرن 21 مآسوشیتدپرس درباره این رمان می‌نویسد: بعضی کتاب‌ها را نمی‌توان زمین گذاشت.
در این بین لوییزا با نیتن (پرستار مسائل پزشکی ویل) و استیون، پدر ویل، نیز ملاقات می‌کند.
بعد از این ماجرا قرار شده ویل شش ماه زندگی کند و بعد درباره مرگ آسان تصمیم بگیرند.
Una historia bella y conmovedora, creo que leí este libro en un momento bastante adecuado, aprendí muchas cosas que espero poner en practica pronto y disfrute la lectura de principio a fin.Me encantó el humor negro y sarcástico de Will y la relación que construye con Lou y aunque se me hizo bastante predecible el final de la historia, esto no hizo que me parecería menos conmovedor y emotivo.
I need a hug. In fact, can someone just hold me for a week? I think I am just gonna curl up in a ball and keep sobbing now.
Just RIP MY HEART OUT WHY DON'T YOU.I really loved this story and these characters a lot. A lot a lot. A really fantastic read.Can't write more right now because CANNOT PROCESS.
