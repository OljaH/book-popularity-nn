Super cute and fun! Loved the first half, but the second half felt a little all over the place. Overall, it was lighthearted and sweet and exactly what I thought it would be!
I think the only thing I would have liked to see MORE of - not that the book is not absolutely fabulous - is a more developed story of the web design aspect of this book.
Dimple & Rishi attend the same summer program/contest where the goal is to develop an app to present to professionals in the world of web design.
I think Dimple's idea for the app itself was revolutionary and a bit more development on their coding process and how the app eventually comes out would have only aided the story.Overall, this book was fantastic.
2.5/5 stars  People: this books is the worst lol don't read it Me: hahahah it can't be that badMe: *is wrong* Usually, this was where I'd put a quote that I liked from the book, but the writing in this book sucked. But I don't wanna mess up the aesthetic of my reviews. So, yeah, you're stuck with that.So what even is the point of me being on this website if I don't even listen to the thousands of negative reviews on my feed that are there to guide me towards great books? Every single time someo

And by “beautifully,” I mean “go hand-in-hand because life is hell and books are suffering and everything is bad and why not just villainize popular kids because it’s easy and boring while we also hate girls because it’s easy?”Anyway.Examples?
And people are suuuper upset about that.But how much of that Dimple hate is coming from the fact that she’s acting in a way we expect from male characters?Don’t get me wrong, I don’t like the “mean but it’s okay because they love you so much” trope.
I wanted to respond to everyone's comments but I didn't want to come off repetitive so I'll express my gratitude on here. Thank you to everyone for being so supportive ❤❤❤ I don't have enough words to describe my love for y'all. Bless your souls ❤❤❤In all seriousness, I never brought this bullshit onto my review to make the drama even bigger but I'm going to take advantage of this experience and help spread awareness.I admit, this experience was shitty. I never thought writing this review will l
I didn't pick this book up thinking it's going to be exactly like a Bollywood movie.
Leave a fucking comment and don't let me find you on Twitter *****************dis·re·spect·/disrəˈspek(t)/- showing a lack of respect or courtesy; impolite “When Dimple Met Rishi” more like “When Dimple Met my Fist” because I will forever be angry about the fact that this lil shit named Dimple wasted a perfect ice coffee.
My heart still hurts reading that scene like I swear i never knew how passionate i was about the ice coffee life until this book.
I liked the ice coffee better than her and it was in the book for literally 2 seconds.
But then this one kid named Dimple came in with her rude ass attitude and abuse behavior and just....someone learn how to transport people into books because I want to teach her some manners.
She's fucking abusive, rude and just full on annoying, literally go away, I hate her.
I noticed many times throughout the book, she'd be punching and hitting Rishi and he even complained to her to stop and it hurt.
If Rishi punched her and she said it hurt, y'all would be screaming out abuse 😤😤.
Dimple is all into coding and computers and Rishi is (in denial though) a huge comic book artist.
I know it's a huge cultural thing but honestly the few times I've read about it, it's always been a super dark negative.
(Ok...Dimple's mum was the opposite of chill.) But the parents really were lovely and wanted the best for their kids.
I loved how we got both Dimple and Rishi's perspective.
I honestly thoroughly enjoyed it and it was full of squishy happy feels and so nerdy and geeky and all the things I want to read about!
The parents of both teens have agreed their kids are compatible, but Dimple's have neglected to mention him...Rishi is more traditional (he learned Hindi before English) and focused on being a good son, so he goes to the summer program with the intent to meet his future wife.
The story is told through the alternating POVs of both characters so you can see a scene unfold through Rishi's eager infatuation and Dimple's caution.
Dimple makes it clear she is not about to get married anytime soon, but they end up as partners for the competition and fall in love as they start spending more time together.
You know what, I was about to force myself to finish this but no. Just no.DNFing it because I promised myself I would stop torturing myself.Dimple is pretty rude. Rishi had the biggest insta love feelings ever. App contest? what app contest? This is just Dimple hitting Rishi, them kissing and now there's a talent show?!It's not a horrible read, it's just pointless for me to finish it.
oh no… looks like i’m….. dnf-ing this….. how inconvenient… oops… here i go, closing the book… i guess this has to wait… until i finish my tbr list… in three eternities and a half… that’s just how long it will take.... sorry…
Ohhhh, do I got a rant for this book. When Dimple Met Rishi was supposed to be the book of my dreams. It was supposed to clear my acne and water my neglected plants. It was supposed to help get into a good university and build my self confidence. . .But the only thing it actually did was make me silently cry fake tears bc I wasn’t even invested in it enough to spend actual emotions on it:) :)Pros- Indian representation – I’m pretty familiar with the culture bc I’ve grown up around Indians my ent

Obviously, arranged marriages happen all the time, especially to young people of certain cultures, but I still found this story very original.That is why I read it, actually.
It’s not a story that I can imagine happening to a lot of different people, because it’s not entirely plausible, but the originality is part of what makes it so interesting.
Quite frankly, I don’t know how I would have reacted if I had been in Dimple’s situation—probably I would have freaked out as well—but somehow Rishi always makes it better.
Dimple and Rishi are a wonderful pair.
[4.5]Oh my goodness, what a whirlwind. It is one of those books, one of those stories that I'm unable to review properly. It is, without a doubt, one of the best feelings to see yourself, aspects of your personality and culture, within a character. To find hope, inspiration and resilience in them and applying it to your own life. I thoroughly enjoyed reading every single page of this wonderful book!
Oh the preciousness
Me encantó!Los protagonistas Dimple y Rishi son hindúes-americanos, con padres muy apegados a su cultura de origen.
Dimple para obtener más conocimiento de su área de diseño de aplicaciones y Rishi para conocer a la esposa con la que sus padres lo emparejaron.
Los padres de Dimple no le dijeron nada.Dimple quiere alejarse de todo lo que representa su cultura, no quiere casarse, maquillarse, ponerse ropa muy vistosa, ni siquiera dejarse crecer el pelo.
Rishi es apegado a su cultura y respeta y acepta lo que digan sus padres.
I wanted to love When Dimple Met Rishi.
When Dimple Met Rishi starts with a promising premise: two college-bound, Indian-American teens meet at a summer app design program.
Dimple who’s Not Like Any Other Girl because she rejects her parents gender expectations and refuses to wear makeup--which, BTW, is mentioned soooo many times it’s ridiculous.
Make-up hating, plain-clothes wearing, fuck marriage Dimple is “better” because SHE’S NOT LIKE ANY OTHER GIRL????
For a story that ostensibly values originality, while eschewing the insta-love trope, When Dimple Met Rishi is a fill-in-the-blank rom-com.
There’s the opposites attract couple featuring a lead that’s (again) Not-Like-Any-Other-Girl.
Like I wasn’t any of those things … and my high school experience was really shitty (maybe I'll write a book about it later) … but I know a lot of private school rich popular kids who were normal non-douche bags.
*MILD SPOILER*(view spoiler)[At one point Dimple and Rishi are to meet with with Dimple’s roommate and her “friends” (the rich assholes … I mean how dare they be rich … gods!) and they arrive early.
(hide spoiler)]I hated the fact that Dimple’s personality was all over the place and how stuck-up both her and Rishi were when it came to this one group of rich popular kids.
I still love this book with a sickness.
I absolutely loved this cover and after reading the synopsis, couldn't wait to get my greedy hands on it.I loved Dimple and Rishi.
She's sort of rebelling against the traditional ways of her family and he's all for it and I was captivated by reading them figure it all out.The plot for the story was delightful.
I loved having them thrown into a situation away from home and becoming somewhat dependent on each other.
I loved seeing the culture represented and can't wait to get a finished copy on my bookshelf.**Huge thanks to Simon Pulse for providing the arc free of charge**
UNPOPULAR OPINION TIME: I honestly think this book got published purely due to its diversity factor.Nothing else about it is appealing.
It reads like the countless fanfiction you forced yourself through because a show's writers refused to make your ship canon, so now you have to wade through story after story of typos and grammar mistakes for resolution.
I suppose you could pin it on her Indian-American social background—Her mother forces her to wear makeup and look pretty to attract a husband.
Don't stop and judge others for doing so.All this makes When Dimple Met Rishi seem extremely juvenile.
MEANING, IT DIDN'T EXIST.I'M GONNA GIVE Y'ALL EXAMPLES OF DAY TO DAY FRUSTRATIONS WE FACE:1> WHEN YOU LIVE ON THE TENTH FLOOR AND THE ELEVATOR IS OUT OF SERVICE AND NOW YOU GOTTA USE THE STAIRS.2> WHEN YOU ORDER A DOZEN BOOKS AFTER WORKING HARD TO EARN MONEY FOR IT, AND YOU END UP GETTING ONLY 2 OR 3 BECAUSE THE BOOKSTORE'S WEBSITE FORGOT TO MARK IT OUT OF STOCK (SPEAKING OUT OF EXPERIENCE)3> WHEN YOU ARE DONE WASHING THE DISHES AND SEE BIG AF POTS AT THE SIDE, STARING AT YOU.4>WHEN YOU SEE PEOPLE BEING RUDE AF TO OTHER GOOD PEOPLENOW COMBINE THE FRUSTRATIONS CAUSED BY THOSE.
When Dimple Met Rishi was a nice change of pace from the standard YA read.
When she goes to a summer program before she starts college and meets Rishi Patel, the unthinkable happens.
She starts to fall for a guy that her parents would approve of *gasp* In fact, Rishi is exactly the boy the Shah’s would choose for their daughter.
Rishi Patel is much more… traditional than Dimple.
He was very sweet, kind, and what I loved most about him, is he loved Dimple exactly the way she was and didn’t want to change her or have her be someone she wasn’t.
This was so fucking cute.I don't know how the modern American/Indian family functions, but I think this was a very sweet romance that (maybe) gave a peek into the inner working of some of those families.
And that, to me (<--white bread) was kinda cool.
There is not only so much room for other viewpoints and experiences in romance, but a really need for them, as well.
So, this was an amazing breath of fresh air.The blurb tells you the gist of the plot, but it doesn't adequately explain how adorkable Dimple is or how loveable Rishi turns out to be.<-- Pssst!
Very and very.I'm not saying it was perfect, but it was sweet and fun.Definitely Recommended!
Well, that settles it. Dimple and Rishi are my new OTP.
this should actually be renamed 'When Disappointment Met Prabhleen'thank god though that disappointment is not a big ass bitch like Dimple Shah.
also thank god I'm not a cheese fest guy like Mr. Rishi Patel.
:) :)so, like everyone else, I was fucking excited to read this book.
(ok except for this guy who is a citizen of Australia but let's ignore him for now)the thing is, I have read a lot of books.
it was fine and cute, so I was thinking that the whole book must be like that.
I'm really rude to my best friends because holy shit I have known them for more than 10 years.
This book was so so so so so so SO cute. And hilarious. And perfect for the beginning of summer. AHH I NEEDED THIS IN MY LIFE.
“It was his damn fool heart. Ever optimistic, always looking for a sliver of sunshine in a sky clotted with thunderclouds.” im actually angry people made this book out to be SO HORRIBLE like yall were out here saying dimple was abusive like literally what the fuckgjjdfgdI have 3 things to say1: im convinced yall have never met men in your life bc im telling u if a random man came up to me and said hey future wife i would fLIP my shit too2: rejecting traditional femininity yourself (ie. I don't
I don't wear makeup and think its dumb people want me to) is literally not the same as bashing girls who do wear makeup and going "im not like other girls" DIMPLE'S BEST FRIEND IS A BISEXUAL GIRL WHO LOVES DRESSING UP OWNS A DESIGNER WARDROBE AND WEARS MAKEUP FULL TIME AND DIMPLE SUPPORTS HER.
SHE SUPPORTS HER AND NEVER SAYS SHE'S DUMB FOR DOING THOSE THINGS.
So, let's just pros and cons everything about this book, from character to plot to actual writing:PRO: Dimple wears glasses and is ambivalent towards make up.
Dimple was like if Mia in The Princess Diaries movie didn't have her make-over and I was living for it.CON: The number of bloody times I had to read the words 'Insomnia Con'.
PRO:  Dimple and Rishi remaining authentic to who they were before they met each other when they began their relationship.CON:  The writing style.
What a wonderful, refreshing book.
The novel follows Dimple and Rishi, two young Indian-American high-school graduates that are attending a pre-university course before starting college.
One of the main themes of the novel is how the characters balance their own dreams with their family expectations and traditions.
I loved both characters, well, that's a lie, I loved Rishi a lot more, he's just so cute, and smart, and polite, DREAM boyfriend.
The story is told from the alternating points of view of the main characters and takes place in current times.
Very, very cute.I loved the dynamic between the two main characters.
They contrasted and complimented each other so well, and Rishi is a too good for this world cinnamon bun.
I loved the hate-to-love element and watching both characters question themselves.
There's also a good brother relationship here, which is refreshing since we get a lot of emphasis on sisters in YA.There are several romance cliches used throughout the book and the storyline is a little par for the course for the genre, so if you aren't a fan of contemporary romance I can see how you may not love this.
I don’t understand why y’all have such a deep and everlasting hate for this book but that being said, I have gone from Liking this book to Not Liking this book over the eleven days I have been reading it and am no longer interested in completing.
also points for Sandhya Menon being both the classiest and most savage Twitter user I know and for my girlfriend being in her book acknowledgments.
I’m so sorry @ girlfriend you didn’t deserve this I’m sorry✨I am for some inconceivable reason in a Romantic mood and this exceptionally polarizing book will hopefully be Adorable
