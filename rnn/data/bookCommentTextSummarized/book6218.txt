It all started with a complicated (from legal point of view) real estate problem.
Their discussion were fairly long and this was the first instance for me when Gardner failed to make any law sound exciting: too long.Second, there was a scene in the middle of the book when I could not help feeling the author did everything in his power and beyond to avoid reaching its conclusion.
As I mentioned the mystery was quite complicated, but this is something I came to expect from Gardner.
So the novel is good, but not up to the usual standards of the series.
While the caveat of Gardner’s dialog, sometimes much too formal — having characters speak on paper as they never would in real life abounds — exists as always, it’s overcome by some nifty plotting, and those romantic moments between Perry and Della.It all has to do with a woman named Jane who wants to sell an island and share the wealth with her sister Martha and Martha’s daughter, Marjorie.
Before we get there, we have one of the most romantic moments in the long-running series, as Della sits on the grass with Perry’s head in her lap, remaining awake beneath the stars while Perry sleeps.
It’s a minor distraction from a great story and entry in the series.
This book is one such with deceptive red herrings.The defendant literally runs into Perry Mason in a night gown carrying a revolver after midnight on a luxury yacht just after a shot is heard.
Drake is convinced Perry is crazy to take the case, the police believe they have an iron clad case, the client might fire him and it's friday the thirteenth.
For good measure, Perry and Drake are sued for 250000$ each for their backfired strategy.I liked the book as the challenge was no longer just a whodunnit but a full fledged drama.
And the parts with Della made Perry seem almost human.
It is a rare Gardner effort in that it is not full of confusing sets of red herrings and false leads.
The plot is well thought-out, and Gardner manages to provide the reader with a mini-course on contract law.
There is a third party who had been renting the island on a limited basis with the owner to keep the right of first refusal on the property.
That party somehow obtained data that indicated that there was oil on the property.
Gardner did a good job of turning us readers into contract specialists without driving us away from his story.
Perry recruits homicide Lt. Tragg to find a missing speculator in the apartment of his attractive partner.
A search uncovers the partner's fiance and mother in the apartment and leaves Mason with egg on his face.
An unusual victory for Tragg set the stage for a courtroom scene in which Mason is determined to defend a woman who even detective Paul Drake is certain is guilty.Perry Mason series - Jane Keller is in the process of selling an island to Parker Benton when Scott Shelby tries to enforce an expired oil lease and block the sale.
Jane's sister takes her to Perry Mason.
I find them very soothing, with their CSI-like focus on the puzzle rather than melodrama, and their choice of rather elaborate white-collar frauds and inheritance plots, which highlights the oddity of the contemporary crime novel's obsession with violence against women and children.I've heard (read) it being called borrowing emotional capital.
But on the positive side, while many of the Perry Mason books stick closely to the urban settings of the characters' offices, flats, cars and courtrooms, this one has an unusual trip on a pleasure boat and a visit to a country lake thrown in, both important to the plot.
Its all about the real estate deal and Jane Keller, a widow wishes to sell an island to a millionaire and it all gets complicated Perry Mason and his assistant Della Street are invited to a yacht where everyone involved in the deal are present.
She sues him for defamation.What follows is a couple of sleepless nights, a wild goose chase and a fishing expedition.The best part is the courtroom drama in the end.A ballistics expert by name Robert P.Noxie is brought in.The cross examination of various witnesses & the deposition are very entertaining.
The cross examination is one of the best I have read/seen.
A property dispute leads to murder. Perry Mason investigates and, believing he has found it impossible for his client to have committed the crime, calls in Lt. Tragg and promptly finds himself sued for defamation of character.A deftly handled mystery, which sees Mason questioning his own tactics and practices when he is caught on the receiving end.
Perry Mason never gets monotonous. This one doesnt have the usual court trial at the end, but its still entertaining.
One of the better Perry Mason stories because it has more courtroom action.
After reading a biography of Erle Stanley Gardner (and it must be the only one,) and learning that Gardner "wrote" by using Dictaphone tubes and having a team of up to seven secretaries to transcribe and edit, it soured me on his "writing." He created a life where he remained married but lived apart from his wife.
My edition was M.S. Mills publishers, copyright 1945, first edition, and as it was published during the last year of World War II, there is a notice on the opening pages that "this book is manufactured under wartime conformity with all government regulations controlling the use of paper and other materials." I've taken a photograph to add to this listing.
In this case, Perry sticks his neck out and almost gets his head chopped off.The best books in the Perry Mason series have all the things fans have come to expect and a little unexpected twist.
After all, we KNOW that Perry will find out whodunit, so we need a road block or two thrown in his path just to keep things interesting.WWII is not long over.
There's a lovely scene of Perry and Della picnicking in a rural spot, his head in her lap while he dreams out loud of buying a quiet place for them and settling down.
I've been reading Gardner's Perry Mason books off and on for many years.
That, and the ingenious plots, are why I read Perry Mason.On the whole, the ones written by 1945 are the best.
An issue could have been explained another way.- The murderer left an important clue out to be discovered.
That made no sense.- There is an important technical issue that no reader will guess.
That violates a basic tenet of mystery stories, that the careful observant reader has a good chance to dope it out.Still, like the best stories do, it puts Perry is a dangerous predicament for his own career.
This Perry Mason story begins with Mason and his secretary Della Street being invited to a yacht.
The purpose of the invitation is so that Mason can interact with the other people who have an interest in an island.
The case appears hopeless and Mason uses some of his typical unusual tactics in an attempt to even things out.
This is not one of the strongest Mason stories authored by Gardner.
Relying on incompetence by the police and/or Burger for Mason to succeed is a weaker plot device and should be avoided.THis review also appears on Amazon

Yo estaba firmemente convencida de que el título era una pista. Pero no. Es un libro realmente amenos de leer, es del estilo de cualquier otra policiaca pero desde el punto de vista de un abogado con una intuición increíblemente buena.Me lo he leído por leerme algo y realmente, no dejan de sorprenderme este tipo de lecturas. Genial.
A nice fast paced murder mystery. I took off one star because there was a point for the bad guys where things were a bit too coincidental and lucky. Would have probably been 3 stars off if it had happened to the good guys, lol. When the bad guys get into a stream of good luck I'm more willing to accept it for some reason.
This Perry Mason mystery from the 1940s starts off slowly and is quite verbose. It is filled with red-herrings and lose ends remain, unlike many of the other mysteries in this series, when the mystery at the heart of the story is solved.
This one kept my interest; a rollicking good read. A mystery aboard a yacht with many twists and turns. Includes some interesting business in court concerning ballistics. A lot of antagonism between Mason and Burger. It wouldn't be a proper Perry Mason courtroom drama without that! ;)
i learned how to murder someone
Sort of an interesting take on the usual plot devices, Mason was on the right track, convinced he wasn't and almost was made to look a fool.
My Rating System:* couldn't finish, ** wouldn't recommend, *** would recommend, **** would read again, ***** have read again.
An okay-okay case. Hardly any convincing was needed from the client here though. This is more clever cross examination leading to the truth kind of Mason cases.
Enjoyable, has some great moments, but the "reveal" was really stretching it a bit :)
I thought Perry would lose a case for once. Galing! Great twist. :)
The pleasure of reading a rather dated mystery is that there are no special forces with big guns or religious terrorists just heroes and crooks.
definitely one of the best perry mason novels. i would suggest one to read this book after he/she has read plenty of other perry mason novels first
Fast paced, well-written, clever – this is brain candy but there's no better way to spend your lunchbreak.
I'm getting impatient.So I skip-reading it. FORGIVE ME GOD.
A good book if you want to learn about the basics of ballistics.
