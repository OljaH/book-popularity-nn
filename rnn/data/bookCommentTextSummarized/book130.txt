James clearly knows that he's chosen the wrong girlfriend, and he's heartily sick and tired of being thrown over for upper-class snobs who have money. The one time he refuses to behave "according to his station," he finds himself in a fix. Loved the twists and turns in this one!
Cute short mystery.
Good twist at the close.Reading unapologetically to fulfill 2018 PopSugar Reading Challenge category "book with your favorite color in the title" after trying in vain to find anything that interests me (and which I haven't already read) with the color green in the title.
I've read a number of VERY LONG books already this year so I'm #notsorry that I'm adding a short story for a prompt.
At least it's all text, which is more than I can say of the solution of using children's picture books to fulfill prompts.
A short story on how a young man’s antics to keep up with his girlfriend’s rich friends gets him involved in the case of a missing emerald. A bit slow in the beginning, James, our protagonist, clearly describes his frustrations with his girlfriend, Grace, as she prefers the company of her classy friends than his. In an attempt to keep up with them, an unintentional exchange of trousers lands him with the missing emerald belonging Rajah’s. From here things pick up and it’s an entertaining read.
I liked how the reader should have been too afraid that the protagonist is in danger but at last he doesn't just get away with it he also manage to save the day.
I am not sure why this is labeled as a Parker Pyne story as he in not in it at all . Maybe it was in a collection of Pyne stories. It was a good shirt story. But not one of her best.?

I opened english detectives for me with this book. It is really entertaining and unpredictable.
James Bond!
