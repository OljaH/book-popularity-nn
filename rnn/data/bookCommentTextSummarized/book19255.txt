i think this might be my favorite book by brian selznick.
which is hard for me to say, because i've loved the other books i've read by him.
we follow two story lines that eventually collide and the way in which they connect made my heart explode with both happiness and sorrow.
even though there is no magic present in this story and it's realistic fiction, you can't help but still feel a presence of magic throughout it.
overall i was struck with wonder throughout the reading of this book.
(sorry i had to) i'm gonna stop now, because i'm pretty sure i'm overhyping this.
In Wonderstruck, Selznick continued the narrative approach of using both words and illustrations, this time separating each style in its own story and weaving them together at the end.Ben’s story starts in Gunflint Lake, Minnesota in June 1977.
Ben discovers a bookmark in his mother's book.Rose's story starts in Hoboken, New Jersey in October 1927.
Unhappy and lonely at home, she runs away to New York City to see her idol, actress Lillian Mayhew.
In New York, Rose travels to the theater where Lillian Mayhew is performing.
Rose takes Ben to Queens, and leads him into the Queens Museum of Art where she tells her story.
Reasons why you should read this book RIGHT NOW - beautifully woven adventure of a young boy- dual perspectives (one written in word and the other in pictures)- DEAF MAIN CHARACTERS- brilliant artwork im thoroughly impressed- a sad, soft, smol boy- a sad, soft smol girl- they need protecting and love- i wanna wrap everyone up in blankets and give them hot chocolate and marshmallows- so much family love my heart- ITS SO SHORT I FINISHED IN 20 MINUTES - dont be intimidated by the size- brb forcin

Just kidding, though I'm not sure if I have the words because there is so much that the reader experiences that isn't understood but felt.The story is told from two perspectives.
Rose's story is told through pictures and Ben's through words.
I thought the combination of words and pictures was perfect for the story of Rose and Ben. This story explains the love of art, of museums, of books and most of all people.
I loved both the characters but I think I gravitated toward Ben more, and that's because his story was told in words and I'm a reader, of course I love words.
“Maybe, thought Ben, we are all cabinets of wonders.” I’ve been wanting to read this beauty of a book for ages now, so when I saw it on the shelves of my library, I was beyond ecstatic.Wonderstruck jumps back and forth between the lives of Ben and Rose, who live fifty years apart from each other.
Ben longs of finding and meeting the father he never met, while Rose is more focused on following a certain famous silent actress that she has an important connection with.Ben's story is told solely through writing, while Rose's is told through Selznick's gorgeous illustrations.
Wow 👏🏼
After finding a few clues in his mother's bedroom, Ben goes off to New York in search of his father.Meanwhile, Rose, always feeling like she doesn't belong anywhere, is obsessed with a movie starlet.
Selznick's illustrations are absolute food for the eyes and I believe they speak for themselves:Along with a few other illustrated works I've recently read, Wonderstruck has given me an appreciation for art and helped me to see how it can truly make a story come alive.
Selznick is an accomplished artist as well as a gifted writer; but what he's created here is not simply a novel with illustrations, nor a conventional "graphic novel." He's invented a format that's genuinely new and ground-breaking, in which the illustrations carry a significant part of the storyline, and serve as much as a part of the narrative as the conventional text portions; it's truly "a novel in words and pictures." Near the outset, we meet our two co-protagonists: 12-year-old Ben of Gunflint Lake, MN (which is an actual place in real life) in 1977, and 12-year-old Rose in Hoboken, NJ in 1927.
I have only just come across this author/ illustrator, and this book was really impressive, the illustrations and story were equally good and I think this is something that rarely happens.
When the book started switching between the two, it made me feel as though the story told by the drawings was a silent movie, as I read on this became more relevant.
Etc. All of them touched me.For not the first time I am tempted to create a new-york or nyc shelf.I read this book in one day.
The title name is brilliantly incorporated more than one way into this story.I recommend this book to just about everybody, particularly anybody who fits/likes any of the following: museums, books, the Museum of Natural History in NYC, bookstores, is interested in the deaf and/or Deaf culture, likes historical fiction stories, remembers the 1964-1965 New York World’s Fair, liked From the Mixed-Up Files of Mrs. Basil E.
This book is great.
Yeah, this book is 75% illustrations, but still it's no small fit for a children's book to keep my attention like that.Brian Selznick intertwines two stories together in his Novel in Words and Pictures.
Ben's story is told entirely in words, and Rose's - in pictures.
Of course we know that these two stories of lonely children are bound to merge together, and they do.
Both narratives are paced in the best possible way, making you want to read more, to learn more, to uncover the mystery faster.I rarely enjoy such words/pictures combos, one medium almost dominates the other, but this time it is an organic union.
راستش با تمام تعریف و تمجیدهایی که شنیدم، فک کردم وختی تمومش کنم، پنج میدم. ولی داستانش- برای من- در حد دو بود. گرچه بار عاطفی ِ اثر خیلی درگیرکننده ساخته شده بود. اما بهلحاظ داستانی.. البته خب توقع منم زیاده، مخاطبش من نیستم که. :دی ولی بار عظیم داستان و روایتپردازی رو، تصاویرش بهدوش میکشیدن که جداً محشر بودن! من چنتاشونو هی برمیگشتم نیگا میکردم حین خوندن و پر از داستان و احساسات قشنگ میشدم. ولی یکی از ایرادات ِ وارده رو، اغراق میدونم. گفتم که بار عاطفیش قشنگ بود و شیرین. ولی گاهی دل آدمو میزد.

نظر منه البته.
I couldn't decide between four stars or five!I loved this story and think it's an extremely important middle grade novel.
We have a protagonist who was born deaf, and one who lost his hearing later in life.
What we had was wonderful, but it felt like so little was told in those 600 pages.
I really think that's just because it's difficult to tell a full story in illustrations alone and even though when the two points of view came together it all started making so much sense, it still felt like there was so much more to be told.
Rose’s Story - seen almost solely in pictures: A seeming prisoner in her own home, Rose too sets out for New York City to see the actress Lillian Mayhew for reasons of her own.
And in that discovery, they will find one another.I’ll just state right here and now that you could probably tell from the opening paragraph of this review that it’s extraordinarily difficult to talk about Wonderstruck without invoking Hugo Cabret in the same breath.
I mentioned at the beginning of this review that I think that Wonderstruck is better than Cabret and it’s for the same reason that I’d pair this with The Arrival: It draws an emotional response from the reader.
I'm not sure why it took me so long to pick this up since I enjoyed The Invention of Hugo Cabret so much. I think I still liked that one better, but I love how these two stories set 50 years apart develop together and weave together. Brian Selznick is truly an awesome author and storyteller.
In the days leading up to the New Orleans performance my husband’s youngest granddaughter (a 5th-grader) mentioned to me a book she was reading that quoted a Bowie song.
(It most certainly was.) Because of this coincidence, I checked out the book for myself.The book holds two compelling, though at first seemingly unrelated, stories of two different time periods: one told in illustrations, the other in words.
The illustrations are marvelous, with a real sense of place and time (the late 20s).
Perhaps because of the necessarily limited viewpoint of the narrator, I didn’t feel a real sense of time with the story set in the late 70s, Bowie song references notwithstanding.
Yazarın ilk olarak Hugo Cabret ve Buluşu kitabını okumuştum ve çok sevmiştim o yüzden Kutup Yıldızı'nı hemen okumak istememiştim.
Geçenlerde kitaplığa bakarken birden elim ona gitti ve ne ara başladım ne ara bitti anlamadan kitabın son sayfasına geldim ve Kutup Yıldızı'nı çok daha fazla sevdiğimi söyleyebilirim.Hugo Cabret ve Buluşu'nda olduğu gibi Kutup Yıldızı'nda da hikayeye ek olarak çizimler yer alıyor.
Hugo'da hikaye çizimler ile desteklenirken, aynı hikayeye ait çizimler yer alırken; Kutup Yıldızı'nda çizimler ve yazılar ile farklı iki hikaye anlatılıyor ve kitabın sonlarına doğru bu iki farklı hikaye çok güzel bir şekilde birleşiyor.İki çocuğun 50 yıl arayla aynı mekanlardan geçişini, hayallerinin peşinden gidişini okuyoruz.
It isn't really bad, but I didn't have much sense of the story moving forward, and with the exception of Ben, the characters didn't feel well-fleshed-out or natural to me, especially Ben's friend Jamie.[SPOILER ALERT] On a personal-squick level, it bothered me that Ben's mom, who is supposed to be so wonderful, didn't (the book implies) tell Ben's dad about him--and then she even met his parents, who'd just lost their only son, and didn't tell them "this little boy right here, this is your grandson"?
I'm such a huge fan of Brian Selznick because he's a master at constructing stories.
And not only that, but stories that intersect art and prose BEAUTIFULLY.
I love that this book focuses on two separate stories and timelines, but they find relevancy to the other in the end.
I found the focus on deaf characters especially heightened the importance of telling one of these stories without words.
The reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I didn't feel as close with this one as I've felt about his books in the past.
I highly recommend Selznick's books!
Que livro lindo!!! Estou arrasada!! Uma história tão delicada, tão bonita e apesar de triste, cheia de esperança!Adorei,adorei!
I am so, so happy I made time to finally read and enjoy it this week becuase it is truly something magical (although it's technically got no 'real' magic).
The imagery is all pencil drawn with some truly beautiful cropped shots of certain moments which are pivotal to the story.I have a real soft spot for any pencil-drawn imagery anyway, but this book felt so incredibly cinematic and beautiful to me whilst I read it that it just flowed into my mind even without the words there for guidance.This is the story of Ben. A young boy who is dealing with the loss of his mother.
In his exquisite pencil drawings, Brian Selznick creates Rose's world with a perfect combination of detail and shadowy suggestion.
The way Selznick sets the scene with clothing, cars, advertisements, museums and other landmarks made me want to be there with Rose in 1927 New York City.
Ben's enthusiasm for the wonders of nature opens up that world of discovery in exciting ways.
Through Ben we also see how a child aches for a lost parent, and the wishful thinking that follows such a loss.
For Ben, there's the difficulty with communication, and also the disorientation of being in new surroundings while living in a silent world.
Hislerimi yansıtmakta zorlanıyor, kelimeleri bir türlü toparlamıyorum bu da böyle kalsın.Ah!
İnsanın kalbine işleyen, ruhuna dokunan öyle güzel bir hikayesi vardı ki Kutup Yıldızının, böylesini bulmak çok ÇOK zor gerçekten.Bookstagram hesabımda dile getirmiştim; kitap 600 küsur sayfa olmasına rağmen sayfaların yarısını illüstrasyonlar kaplıyor.Ama bu çizimler atıyorum Vahşi Orman kitabında ki gibi değil çünkü; kitapta çizimler ayrı, yazılar ayrı hikayeyi anlatıyor Kutup Yıldızı'nda ve bu iki hikaye birleştiğinde...
:love:Bunu da eklemiştim: Alın okuyun, ileride çoluk çocuğunuza miras kalsın.Ne desem bilemiyorum.
Ben ki illüstrasyonlu kitapları ayrı seven insanım, sanırım bu kitap bu kategoride daima birincim ve en bi' sevdiğim olacak.
Yaşasın iyiki okumuşum dedirten güzel kitaplar.

Der er så mange detaljer, og det giver virkelig SÅ meget til historien.Jeg nød at følge begge historier, men det var nok Roses historie, der betagede mig mest.
Om det var fordi dén var i billeder og uden ord, eller om den var mere spændende, det skal jeg ikke kunne sige.
"If you are ever lost," his mom had said when he showed her the book, "just find the North Star and it will lead you home."" - citat side 21.Det er sådan en skøn historie, og jeg elsker, hvordan Brian Selznick får historien med ord og billeder til at passe sammen, og flyde sammen for at skabe en skøn helhed.
In this book the Author goes into how he came about writting/drawing this story and all the research he did before hand.
I found that very intresting and amazed what time and effort these people go to, to write a book.This is a story about what it is like to be Deaf, and also to have that sence of belonging.
There is a lot of thunder and lightening in this story, I love hail, hate thunder.
A lot of the story is set in The America Museum of Natural History in New York, which was so cool because we have been and it is an amazing place.
4.5/5Kitaba BAYILDIM! Kitabın formatı hayatımda gördüğüm en orijinal fikir olabilir. Yorumu için: http://kronikokur.blogspot.com.tr/201...
Que livro lindo! Uma história de amizade muito poderosa, onde o passado e o presente se cruzam de forma admirável.Com uma parte da história escrita (a de Ben), e outra parte desenhada (a de Rose), vamos descobrindo a história de duas crianças muito parecidas e com muito em comum, excepto o facto de viverem em épocas distintas. Contudo as suas vidas vão-se intercalar magistralmente, dando origem a um final, verdadeiramente inesperado.Não deixem de ler e reler!
I felt grateful for my background in ASL because I was able to easily understand a few of the parts in the book that may have been a bit more mysterious for those who were unfamiliar with sign language, but I think Selznick was clear enough that even someone new to ASL could appreciate and understand what he was writing about and depicting through the art.
Spoiler below for those who have read the book and want to know more about a certain museum exhibit:Here's a picture of the NYC Panorama at the Queens Museum of Art:http://www.queensmuseum.org/exhibitio...Also, I was thrilled to learn that they now have "Signed Sundays" with guided ASL tours of the Panorama!!!
I wonder if Selznick's book prompted this, or if it's just a coincidence?http://www.queensmuseum.org/signed-su...
