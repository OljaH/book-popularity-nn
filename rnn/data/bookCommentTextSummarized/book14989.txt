Note, Jan. 17, 2016: I just edited this review to correct one misspelling.The selections in this volume are arranged chronologically, so that they show the progression, and gradual maturing, of Lovecraft's work, from early stories like "The Transition of Juan Romero" to his powerful later work like the novella At the Mountains of Madness.
P. Lovecraft, which is part of the same Del Rey series.Stories like "Arthur Jermyn" (titled "White Ape" in some anthologies) and "The Lurking Fear" vividly demonstrate the hag-ridden fear of devolution that lies at the heart of Darwinism.
P. was still sulking around school and listening to whatever the 1900s version of The Cure was, most of them are garbage.The standout works are the wonderfully crafted Mountains of Madness, Herbert West: Re-animator, In the Walls of Eryx, and my personal favorite - The Temple, in which a U-Boat captain slowly goes insane after his vessel sinks down to the ruins of a lost city.These stories are all fantastic, haunting Gothic tales that rival the best Poe, but for every Re-animator there is an Evil Clergyman and a Beast in the Cave to bookend it.
Reading Lovecraft is like having a horrific tale told to you by an english gentleman in a waist coat over tea in a parlor with a roaring fire.
He has created richly detailed stories of all types of horror and mayhem and even dabbles in the realm of science fiction.
I'm told that this volume is far from his best, I'm all a flutter to get my hands on the next volume.
I also understand that he wrote many of these stories as a fifteen year old.
A lovely collection of mayhem!
These are the Lovecraft stories I've read so far, just for my own personal record-keeping...At the M
Dude...it's Lovecraft.
My personal favourites in this book were ;1) The Transition Of Juan Romero2) The Temple3) The Terrible Old Man4) Reanimator (lots of gross descriptions & lots of blood....too good !)5) Imprisoned With The Pharaohs (I love Houdini)6) The Horror At Red Hook (out of this world !) &7) In The Walls Of Eryx (he co -authored this with Kenneth Sterling)Lovecraft refers a lot to Edgar Allen Poe in most of his early works especially in 'The Shunned House' where it looks like he really was enamoured by the original creator of the macabre.
This volume is sort of a history, taking us along the chronological road of Lovecraft's development. We start with the very early “The Beast in the Cave” and into some curious efforts on our way up through “Dagon”, “The White Ship”, and one of my all-time favorites, “The Crawling Chaos”. Even then, it's just getting started. Even for a seasoned Lovecraft enthusiast, this makes for one weird and interesting trip! Some of it is fanciful strangeness that almost doesn't connect up to anything, other
For more famous tales, there's “Herbert West-Reanimator”, “At the Mountains of Madness”, “The Shunned House” and “The Lurking Fear”.
There are 29 stories here, providing a rich variety, strengthened by the wealth of short pieces sandwiched in with meatier ones like “Herbert West” and “At the Mountains of Madness”.
Some of these tales are like old friends by now, especially “The Crawling Chaos” and “The Festival” (seriously, read this one if nothing else!).
The word “nightmare” is overused when describing horror fiction, but Lovecraft really nails the dream state, right up to the ripe cherry at the very end, “The Evil Clergyman”.
What I like about thes collections of Lovecraft's work is that are themed in some way.
The purpose of this collection is to track Lovecraft's evolution as a writer.
As Neil Gaiman is quick to point out in his introduction, most of Lovecraft's early work (like 'The Beast in the Cave' for example) isn't very good, but it shows promise, and as this book proves, that promise was fulfilled as Lovecraft grew as a writer.
If you are new to Lovecraft's short fiction, you'll probably want to start elsewhere by picking up a "greatest hits" collection of his work.
I am too biased to write a proper review. I love Lovecraft and usually feel the need to read something of his at least once a year. This was my last unread volume on the shelf and it's a collection of some of his earlier more obscure stories. Honestly his plotlines are frequently redundant because they are usually different branches of his own mythology, but the world he has created is so detailed, so macabre and and strangely gothic. I always find myself getting completely lost in it regardless of any predictablility.
Has the great story Under the Pyramid starring Harry Houdini
This issue goes right to the heart of many of the stories of H.P. Lovecraft, assembled in this collection appropriately titled The Road to Madness.
For example, in At the Mountains of Madness, one of Lovecraft’s most famous works, an expedition to the Antarctic uncovers the remains of a city built long before humans walked the earth.
Because the stories in this collection focus mostly on the mental battles of the characters, and because only a few of the more well-known works are included, I wouldn’t necessarily recommend it as an introduction to Lovecraft.
Despite the super short length, when I start listing my favorite Lovecraft tales this is always one of the first to come to mind.
It's so short that if I say anything else about it I'll give it away!Herbert West--Reanimator: Take the movie Re-Animator, and make it more Night and less Return (of the Living Dead) and you've got a pretty good idea.
This definitely influenced one of my favorite movies of all time, The Thing.There are several other solid Lovecraft stories in this collection, but there are just as many that were blah.
P. Lovecraft: Bloodcurdling Tales of Horror and the Macabre by H.
P. Lovecraft, Introduction by Robert Bloch, and The Dream Cycle of H.
P. Lovecraft, Introduction by Neil Gaiman.
And I should note that I am apparently reading these volumes out of order, because this present book contains a lot of material from the author’s early work, before he became a master horror writer.
P. Lovecraft, Introduction by Neil Gaiman as my bedtime reading for a week or so.
The writing is terrific, dark, brooding, flowing—but sometimes you can fee strangled by it, wrapped in its stream.The stories themselves are great, the masterpiece in my opinion being "At the Mountains of Madness." But, through all of the blocks of text, with all the deep descriptions of terror and the Old Ones, there is no dialogue.
It is fun to go back and read the original—for audiences in the '30s, this was some seriously scary stuff.Three stars for lack of dialogue and a lot of purple.
There isn't much I can say about H.P. Lovecraft that hasn't already been said a bajillion times, but I can take a stab at it.The Road to Madness is a collection of Lovecraft's stories, but it feels like the collection's quality is hit-or-miss.
Some of the earlier works are there, and are fun to read, but when you look at some stories, they are clearly better than others.
However, this does give a good insight into some of the progress that Lovecraft made as an author, and the changes his style underwent.That being said, I don't think I'd read it again.
The stories are good ones--and ones you see less frequently that others--but there are certainly better collections out there.
The old man tells the young man to follow him, so he did and he followed him for a very long time in the dark.
Then the old man brings the young man up stairs into a room.He lights a candle and starts telling the young man scary stories.
Then the old man tells the young man to look outside the window.
Then the old man starts getting really scared.
The young man realizes this and asks why are you getting scared.
I liked that the book was based a really long time ago when New York was first getting built.
"In the Walls of Eryx" is a nice little science fiction story I don't remember reading, and there are other great multi-part stories, such as "Herbert West--Reanimator." Overall, I'd say this is a good collection of Lovecraft stories, though maybe not the best.
If you are looking for the best Lovecraft, and have never read him, I'd say check out The Best of H.P. Lovecraft: Bloodcurdling Tales of Horror and the Macabre from Ballantine/Del Rey. This volume has some early works of the author's that, while interesting in the overall picture of his work, are just not as polished as his later works.
You're almost obligated to read Lovecraft at some point if you're an avid reader.
As I am constantly reminded by my brother, Lovecraft was not a writer, he was an imaginer, and probably didn't have much of a handle on what he was writing himself.
That being said, his writing is atrocious, and after getting through "The Mountains of Madness" in this collection I want to stab the dead imaginer for schlogging me through countless hours of glorious mirages with nothing behind them but more flickerings in the distance.
I'll probably be reading him again before the year is over.
Great stuff, I read it mostly for Mountains of Madness, but it's full of other tales.
HPL is classic, gold standard stuff for mood, and it's amazing that really what we're reading is sci-fi and not fantasy, exactly.
MoM takes some diving in, as HPL is very dense with descriptions in an academic style rather than what other authors might do with popular fiction: virtually no dialogue, all descriptions, and you infer things broadly.
The cover of the edition is also great fun, and is possibly the best looking version of his tales that I've come across (imho).
This book contains some of Lovecraft's lesser-known and earlier work as well as a few famous pieces.
Some of the earlier stories are only okay, but true Lovecraft fans will enjoy seeing how he progressed.
Since this collection contains my all-time favorite Lovecraft story (or novella, actually), At the Mountains of Madness, I can't help but give it five stars.
It also contains a few classics, like "Herbert West - Reanimator," and some interesting stories, like "Imprisoned with the Pharaohs" (ghost-written for Harry Houdini).
My favorite of the less popular stories is "In the Walls of Eryx," which is old school science fiction story in an eldritch, Lovecraftian key.
P. Lovecraft was a fantastic example of the many different styles in which Lovecraft wrote his stories over the years.
As with all of Lovecraft's stories the reader is left thinking about the implications the writer suggests in the incredibly horrific images.I would definitely read this collection of stories again, but if a reader is new to Lovecraft this is not the book with which to begin.
Some of the stories are during his younger years and the difference can easily be seen in the writing as well as the complexity of the stories.
i'll say this: as a collected edition of stories laid out chronologically, i enjoyed witnessing lovecraft's genius unfold.
while there is always a demon or monster in his stories, the ones in his early writing career, like the first one in this addition written when he was 14 years old, were monsters in the vain of the addams family.
later, his writing transcends his own abilities and becomes its own beast.
this is when the monsters which his characters battle are sentient--like the kind we battle in real life.
honestly, before that, the writing is crap.
just like any 14 year-old's.
Before then, I had been a big fan of Stephen King and Clive Barker, but it never occurred to me that there may be a writer more influential in my horror writing.
Works out of this book, such as "At the Mountains of Madness", "The Horror at Red Hook", and "Herbert West, Reanimator", remain some of my favorites to this day.
H.P. Lovecraft taught me to reach beyond what I considered weird, and to plumb the depths of what could be out there to find true horror.
Although some of the work may seem a bit outdated, the tales of madness that Lovecraft created, to me, rival that of any horror writer.
A kind of “sequel” to the cornerstone DelRay collection Bloodcurdling Tales of Horror and the Macabre, The Road to Madness is an odd hodgepodge of some of Lovecraft’s best along his very worst.
Like the loose Dream Cycle stories, these include some fragments and juvenilia that apes Poe or Dunsany.
However, the collection includes a few absolute essentials: At the Mountains of Madness, Herbert West - Reanimator, Dagon, Cool Air, and The Lurking Fear are all worthy entries in the Lovecraft library.
Some of the others, like Lovecraft’s “most sci-fi” tale In the Walls of Eryx, are interesting side roads.
I like the Del Ray trade paperback collections of Lovecraft's work, most being organized by theme. This one seemed different in that it's more a vague retrospective from early juvenalia to later mature works, and not concentrating on the Cthulhu mythos or Dream Cycle for example. It's not easy to pick favorites here, as I'm being a completionist and chronologically working through all his fiction.
John Jude Palencar's art for this Del Rey series is disturbing in the most beautiful way. H.P. Lovecraft is mandatory reading for any horror fan! My favorite stories in this collection were, The Book, The White Ship (Maybe one of my all time favorites by Lovecraft), The Lurking Fear, The Horror at Red Hook (Another favorite). Beautiful bizarre stories to haunt your dreams!
wooow that is good book
This is an interesting collection of Lovecraft's work in that it is presented as a look at his chronological growth as a storyteller.
This seemingly simple approach is both a strength and a weakness in the compilation.On the one hand, for the true Lovecraft devotee, it's an interesting chance to follow some of the recurring threads in his stories, as well as a chance to identify some fragments - at least thoughts - which he seemed to revisit, as if seeking to improve upon a literary device that he had used previously but wasn't quite happy with.
Lovecraft's writing is very intelligent, his settings are vivid, his creations are unique; and as the title implies, all of the stories lead to madness.
Despite the few positive traits this book possesses I didn't like it.
There were a few of interest,for example In the Walls of Eryx, which I really liked, but others were just strange and eerie, not scary, but a little redundant.
Lovecraft has a habit of wanting to tell the reader something but it is just too terrifying or maddening, so once the object of fear has materialized the description falls short; At the Mountains of Madness is a good example.
