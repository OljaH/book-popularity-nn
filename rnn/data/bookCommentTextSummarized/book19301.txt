It wasn’t trying to be more than it seemed like it was meant to be…a feel good and entertaining book….not always sunny and bright…not always gloomy and dark…pleasantly imaginative and vividly told.These kinda books are underrated…I’m not saying they should be overrated either—but there is something very respectable about an author knowing how to tell their story with balance and not a hint of ego.
=))I never felt like the author was trying to impress me or convince me of anything…I didn’t feel like I was asked to take on any certain feelings or pressured into being moved along with how certain aspects of the story were presented.
Or, I wish the reviews had been more detailed as to why people didn’t like the book.
In the final 100 pages of the book I just wanted Gideon to kill everyone, Bess included.There was one scene in the final flashback where I said to myself, “If she does X, I swear I’m not going to finish this book.” It was such a stupid thing that was completely unnecessary.
Um, yeah, I totally wasn’t getting on board with that.Then there’s another creepy Satan/demon/eeew sex scene that leads to Bess running from Gideon.
That’s what finally sealed the deal for me with The Witch’s Daughter: though it’s not really a twist, I loved that Paula Brackston added that price to the character of Bess Hawksmith.
Bess’ mother made Bess promise to seek out Gideon and learn magic from him, because that would be the only way to ensure Bess’ safety.
I was beginning to regret taking a gamble on it from the New Books shelf at the library—but then Brackston began telling me about Bess’ first steps toward witchcraft in 1628, and I was hooked.The Elizabeth of present day is a very unsatisfying character, but Bess Hawskmith is brilliant.
Turns out it was a decent read if you can get past the slow as hell start, but I don’t know if it would’ve worked for me if I hadn’t listened to it as an unabridged audio.
But no one cares about all that.After a slightly confusing and slow start with a distant narrator, Elizabeth Anne Hawksmith finally introduces herself and informs us that her current age is three hundred and eighty-four years.
It was here that she finally comes alive as a character and events happen that shape the rest of long life.
The first few pages held promise, but then something happened, the character turned cold, and I didn't feel an intimacy at all in the writing.
The only character I remotely liked was the evil villain, as he was the most interesting one.
I found myself not caring what happened to Bess, nor her boring teenage apprentice, who seemed more like a shadow of a teenager.
I must have been spoiled by my years of reading Alice Hoffman's novels, meaty stories full of magic and life where this one was more of a bleached bone.
This story was just not for me.
It was decent enough that I finished reading it, but The Witch's Daughter was, above all else, formulaic and repetitive.
Even though it was a book of 4 stories in one, they were all basically exactly the same, following the same pattern of A then B leads to C.
"Plot twists" were predictable, especially after the first two internal stories finished.
I kept finding myself asking the main character the question of, "Really?
That's hard to believe, given the setup was exactly the same each time." Ultimately, The Witch's Daughter lacked imagination.
Characters were oversimplified.
Internal plot variations were anything but varied.
This is the second book in the Shadow Chronicles series, however I feel both books stand alone and actually show no link in the storylines.
I was a bit disappointed by this but enjoyed both books nonetheless.
One in the present day and in the form of entries into a Book of Shadows by Elizabeth Anne Hawksmith.
The other is her memories as she tells her story of her lives throughout time whilst being pursued by a dangerous Warlock.
I preferred the stories of her adventures through time to the book entries but enjoyed the story as a whole.
They have nothing to do with the story and they look like 5-inch heeled booties.
It was somewhere during her second story that I began to wonder how she kept getting tricked even though she'd lived, like, 200 years.
Present day Elizabeth seems to have her act a little more together, though she's still rather slow on the uptake when, really, she should have figured out what was going on way before I did.By the end, the glamour had fallen away to reveal a solid story that had turned wobbly, like an apple that looks good but the backside it all rotten and squishy.
Book flips between several time periods because, you know, true witches don't die. Which reminds me of someone is going to turn me into a witch or vampire he or she better get a move on because I'm getting old Anyway Bess makes a friend and an enemy Practices her magic and does her best to avenge a wrong done. That's about it
Ms. Brackston has a talent for creating characters who draw the reader in and I really enjoyed the beginning and the diary entry format.
However, she undermined her story by either wrapping up each plot point a bit conveniently while alluding to struggles that the reader doesn't experience firsthand.
I feel compelled to add *****spoiler alert********************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************that if another author feels the need to connect her/his story to an historical moment - especially Jack the Ripper - I may need to call upon the Dark Arts myself.
This book would have been much better if it had skipped that interlude and concentrated on the other relationships.
For starters I don't understand why people criticize authors for their writing style, it makes no sense.
All writers write differently, end of story.
Also criticizing a fiction book because of the fictional events in it??
Now onto the book review.It started out dry..
Really dry but it picked up quick enough and by chapter 5 of Bess's story I was hooked and didn't want to put it down.
It was very well written, easy to follow, easy to picture the places and characters and it was easy to understand.
Great writing and great story.
However, I had difficulty connecting with any other character.
I loved this book!
Bess is a great character, who turns into a witch in a moment of desperation and spends the rest of her long life making retribution for it by caring for people.
Gideon is a completely horrible person, and I loved how scary and relentless he was.The book is told in alternatively from the present day journal of Elizabeth and historical flashbacks throughout the centuries.
The story flowed easily and I always looked for excuses to read it.
I'm excited to read The Winter Witch now.Content: Sex, including two instances of rape, violence, and some language (no f-words).
My blog: Batch of Books
But still interested in exploring Paula Brackston's other witchy books.* * * * *2.5 stars, rounding up because I did like a good chunk of it before the rest of it wore me out.While I liked Paula Brackston's writing and her takes on the history of witches and modern hedge witches, I felt the book went on for too long, far past the point it should have stopped, and so things (particularly the plot and characters) got a bit boring and I lost interest.
But I'm still interested in picking up Brackston's other books, which seem to be all about witches, which is my new thing apparently.
What Bess soon learns is that Gideon is a warlock—one who practices dark magic.
Soon, a mob comes after Bess, proclaiming her to be a witch like her mother.
She has two choices—let the mob kill her or run away with Gideon and be drawn into the world of dark magic.
From the simple yet superstitious days of the 1600s to the war-torn English landscape during World War I and on to a quiet town in England in present day where natural healing is considered in vogue, you experience it all through Bess' eyes.
I would recommend this novel to anyone who enjoys fantasy at its best and loves reading the work of an artist in command of the English language.
There is a plague which destroys her family, she conceals her powers by becoming involved in the medical profession and, of course,a tragic love story.The writing was cumbersome and the narration was distant.
The plot suffers from predictability when her relentless pursuer surfaces in each of the histories always introduced by an unsettling feeling and the song Greensleeves.
The story really suffered from cliches with a Jack the Ripper story line and a WWII story line where she meets a the soldier, falls in love with him when he reveals himself to be some sort of medium and then tragically loses.
I enjoyed the beginning of the book, especially meeting the adult Bess and hearing her tell of her poor tragic childhood.
Once we left the days of the plague and ended up in Ripper time London, and then to war torn Passchendaele, I was ready for the story to end.
Repetitous, predictable, and just dumb at times.
Bess, you were supposedly a strong and powerful witch, how could you not figure out who Gideon was when even I, a mere mortal did every time?
I so wanted to love this book, but I didn't.
I had this on audible and the narrator was very easy to listen to.It started well but I felt it was somewhat drawn out. This could be due to my previous audio being witchy. I also watched something on the theme so perhaps badly timed. I will read/listen to more.
Anne learns about the dark magic from Gideon and he helps her to save Elizabeth/Bess – unfortunately at the same time, the witch hunts begin and there is a lot of anger and fear in the village.
The back story is presented to the reader via Tegan who happens to be a teenage girl in 2007 who has become enamored with Elizabeth when she moves into her village.
Love, loss, success, and ultimately determining she would like to share her power with Tegan and educate her on how to use it.I feel like I haven’t even started talking about what this book is about – so much happens over such a long period of time but I don’t want to tell you everything.
The first few chapters were slow and I wondered if the book would get better, which it did, only when the author started telling the story of teenage Bess and her family in England.
Forward to present time and her tenuous relationship with Tegan, a character who I think could've been developed a little bit more, and then to WWI where Bess, now Elise, works as a nurse in an army field hospital.
Daughters of the Witching Hill and The Heretic's Daughter are more realistic and definitely worth buying.
"If you will listen," I said, "I will tell you a tale of witches. A tale of magic and love and loss. A story of how simple ignorance breeds fear, and how deadly that fear can be. Will you listen?" I was pleasantly surprised by this book. I was hoping that I would like it but didn't really know what I was in for. This is historical fiction intertwined with supernatural wonder to birth a compelling story of a witch who is just trying to live her life but has been on the run for hundreds of years.

Those three sections are probably my favorites of the entire book because they take place at different time periods in history including the European witch hunts, 1880's London with Jack the Ripper, and the First World War. It was interesting to see how Bess handled those situations while trying not to use her power.
If you like to read stories about witches or if you like historical fiction, I would recommend this book to you.
Nearly four hundred years old, she finds a new place to settle turning out to be near to her first home when she meets a young teenaged girl named Tegan.
The book goes through a number of stories Elizabeth decides to tell Tegan, to trust her with the knowledge of these stories of these people, their hardships and magical adventures, and hope that when the time is right she would come to realize just how close to home these stories are, that they are not fairy tales.Only a few things, as a young Wiccan myself would I have altered.
The Witch's Daughter was a fairly enjoyable read that made up in the evenly paced writing what it lacked in character and plot development.
The writing flowed so beautifully that it was easy to lose myself in the story even when I felt that many of the characters lacked depth and the direction of the story was often confusing.
I was definitely disappointed in the way it ended, especially because I had enjoyed the writing so much up to that point.
Decent story but the ending did disappoint. I kinda knew where the story was going but overall it kept me interested.
It had this Little House in the Big Woods feel at first-with the protagonist of our story, Bess, moving into a cottage and gardening, getting her house all set up, etc.I love stuff like that.Then Bess meets Teagan, a modern day teenager and the stories of Bess' life over 300 years begin.
Serial Killers are exciting!But then, somewhere near the end of this tale, the author lost me.Something seemed off about the story and I couldn't put my finger on it.The conclusion of this story was just a big disappointment.
The story starts with Elizabeth, an immortal witch who has just moved to a beautiful pastoral town in England.
The story starts out in the present, but then goes back and forth a bit for Elizabeth to recollect the different places and time periods in which she lived.
This really pissed me off because it seemed that the author was assuming that good witches worship the goddess and bad witches worship satan.
After that, I lost alot of interest in the story, but I did finish it, because I don't like to leave books unfinished and after all, the writing itself WAS very good.
I didn't mind that so much, as I've been told this is a witch story where there really are dark powers, shades of grey, etc, etc.
Which is unfortunate, since I also had The Winter Witch to read, and was hoping for things from the Welsh setting (although a little put off that the characters were called Cai and Morgana, but no, they weren't that Cai and Morgana and nor did they seem to have any connection -- why would you do that?).
When a character is pretty much introduced via a rape scene, you can pretty much guarantee I'm not going to get on with him.Not a story that worked out for me, in any case.
Having said that, I had a problem with the Jack The Ripper insertion into the story.
Everything else was handled quite creatively and I don't think it was necessary to include it as part of the frame of a small portion of the story.
My biggest complaint was not the semi-satisfying end (yes, sometimes things end the way that they should instead of happily ever after)but in the character of Tegan.
I guess I just really missed her importance and Elizabeth's need to train her in the way's of the witch.
What makes he different than any other girl Elizabeth may have encountered over the years.
Good Premise, interesting writing style.
the ending.
Sigh.
Why do you do this to me books?
Does your author get tired 4/5ths of the way through writing you?
You should have more self esteem than to let youself be published with an ending that belittles the effort that went into imagining and creating you.
Needless to say, I was disappointed in the author's choice of exposition.
The final chapter, written from the perspective of the "Tegan" character, was out of place and just plain stupid.
It left a bad taste im my mouth that otherwise would've garnered this tome a "meh" instead of an "ugh".
ugh.
From the childhood book series The Worst Witch, to the teen movie The Craft and in the AMAZING American Horror Story series, The Coven.
A journey you make with a 384yr old witch, named Elizabeth Jane Hawksmith.
Each witch in their new settlement must write a book of shadows.
The friendless Tegan, somehow insinuates herself into Elizabeth’s life and her suspicions grow.
In the present-day Bess (Elizabeth) prepares to introduce Tegan to the magical events of the witch’s calendar.
I became very invested in Elizabeth’s journey through the era’s and look forward to reading the next novel in the book of shadows series.
I really enjoyed the story. The historical flashbacks were fascinating and I liked the characters a lot(except Gideon, but I think that's the point; he's the unlikable evil one.) I did not, however, like the way it ends. Hopefully the sequel can answer some of the questions I have.
