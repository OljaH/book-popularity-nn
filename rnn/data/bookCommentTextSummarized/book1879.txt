I love these books. This one is about a trip north to find out what happened to the order of Christmas trees Mr. Bobbsey had ordered. Of course much trouble ensues.Same outstanding characters, an exciting plot, a lovely setting, and a simplicity and innocence that characterizes the books from this era. “...the Bobbsey twins seldom had enough of anything when there was fun and excitement going, and you may be sure this was not the last of their adventures.” (location 1770)Ultimate Popsugar Reading Challenge prompt(s) –A book set in the wilderness
She always loved reading and always talked about how she remembered her first books were "The Bobbsey Twins" series.
Laura began writing the books in the early 20th century, 1920′s, perhaps.
They were cared for like any other member of the Bobbsey family.Common to the time, Sam and Dinah were uneducated.
The kids were kids.The books are short and written in an easy to read fashion, on a child's level of understanding.
I can see why my Mom enjoyed them as a child of the late 1940′s/early 1950′s and throughout her life.Would these be written and published in today's world?
I read every Bobbsey Twins adventures I could get my hands on from the age of 9 through 11. Summers were wonderful and I could borrow from the library and read these books. I could borrow 8 books every 2 weeks. Soon, I needed more than that and had to fight the librarian for more books. Now, I can do 8 books in a day. Sigh.
I loved this old book because I liked the way it was told. It had good descriptions and old language. This is a good mystery because I was still trying to figure out what was going to happen right up to the end.
Another sweet Bobbsey Twins book.
