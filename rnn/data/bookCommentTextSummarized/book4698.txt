Keeping a calm, unshakable poise on her unsettling visions, Kavan remains detached and allows the reader to witness first-hand the emotional self-reflections of the mentally ill as they suffer the oppression of their fellow man while trying to find their way in the world.These shadowy exhibits of mankind would be far more repelling if it weren’t for the succulent prose that pours from Kavan.
It doesn't have to be that way.I had this feeling about Anna Kavan when I read about the older lady who watches her pet of a younger patient.
I had the feeling like I wasn't alone when I am turning my door knobs inside and looking for windows into others.
The Mariel lights dim and the other voices must be what blind or deaf people mean they say that their other senses take the lead.
He will leave and did anyone ever really know.I have this feeling of Anna Kavan that she is in the waiting room before what would happen.
Yeah, I’m phoning in another review…I don’t know what to say about this novel.
I know what it’s like to swim to freedom only to find myself lost, and returning to the comfort of the shackles.
I understand the need to worry because of all the bad things that might happen if I don’t.
If I worry all the time, I can make the bad things stay away, right?
She lost me for awhile there and never managed to pull me back in.Still, I hope she is able to leave the iron bars and shackles behind, leave the cold & the darkness and the isolation.
I'm like a birrrd, I'll only fly awaaay...Anna Kavan's Asylum Piece,as reviewed by Petey, the great tit Interesting book, I'll give it that.
If you wanna see a good example of this propensity on display, look no further than that jag-bag of a GR reviewer, Arthur Graham!Tweet tweet!There's a story in this book called "The Birds", and as you may have already guessed, this one struck a special chord with me.
Still, there were moments reading this where I was like "whoa, lady -- us birds ain't got it THAT good!"Take flying, for instance.
What a marvelous book - or better, how amazing that Kavan was able to get all these experiences down on paper.
She manages, in what I suppose were her lucid moments, to chronicle her "descent into madness"; but that cliché is insufficient for this book.
The control and restraint, and perhaps the quietness of the telling is what makes the book powerfully chilling.
She realizes what is happening and the futility of resistance, and yet she maintains her composure, going quietly to the gallows without complaint.Quite an amazing book and my first exposure to Kavan.
Will be reading her more famous book, Ice, next.
Coldly because of the clinical observational detachment she's able to turn on herself, and compassionately because she's able to render insanity so believably and so sympathetically.
It's never too hard to recognize why her characters have been institutionalized, but it's also completely obvious that only a hairs breath separates them from the usual fears, anxieties, obsessions, and uncertainties of the supposedly sane.
Insanity is not typically the territory of visions and voices, but that over everyday life rendered subtlety unbearable, it seems.
And in most cases it seems that all these characters really need to pull them back from the brink is a shred of human contact or understanding which they are continuously denied.
Not all the stories were equally good/gripping, but some of them really got to me (especially chapter II of Asylum Piece, which was brilliant), and overall the pieces put together a product, a vision, of rare quality."A human being can only endure depression up to a certain point; when this point of saturation is reached it becomes necessary for him to discover some element of pleasure, no matter how humble or on how low a level, in his environment if he is to go on living at all.
Each day I find myself spending longer and longer at the window watching their flights, their quarrels, their mouse-quick flutterings, their miniature feuds and alliances.
While I am watching the birds I believe that I am comparatively immune from the assaults of life.
It's funny, somewhere in the middle of this collection I thought to myself, "sure I like her stories, but I'm not sure I'm going to join the cult of Kavan." How many stories of paranoia can I handle, but we all know "just because you're paranoid it doesn't mean they're not after you." It is a cult right?
Jane really nailed "crazy" in her novella "Two-Serious Ladies," but Kavan approaches crazy from a different angle.
I'm stoked to tackle "Ice" and some of her other works to see how she applies language to other themes/topics etc.
To wait — only to wait — without even the the final merciful deprivation of hope.Some authors start out messy and learn to edit.
Told in a series of floating and fragmented vignettes, it feels crisp, chill and is, in fact, highly effective in conveying a sense of isolation.
The remove is appropriate—if not altogether satisfying.In later years, she would learn to convey that sense of strangeness and otherworldly remove in a way that felt somehow complete: giving substance to the phantasmal, a name to namelessness; ultimately creating a narrative frame all her own.
'Asylum Piece', the debut collection of connected stories by Anna Kavan, was the first book by her that I've read.
Originally looking for a nice edition of 'Ice', I managed to find this first, and decided to pick it up anyway.A great decision, afterwards, as this modest volume contains a darkly dazzling collection of moody imaginative stories.
As can be expected from the tile, Kavan's stories are dominated by themes of anxiety, neurosis, uncertainty, and gloomy moods.
However, these grim psychological themes and dispositions are channeled into short stories that are touching and to the point.
How can I have not heard of a woman writing about mental health in 1940?So: confession.
My story is a complicated, continuing one with a lot of emotional labor and loss, and I mention it only to reinforce my relationship to the subject matter.Kavan's portrayals of mania aren't the TV movie, rocking-back-and-forth-in-a-padded-room type.
Her prose is bare and speculative, and she perfectly captures the helplessness of being subject to irrational (or, as I often refer to them, but no one has to agree—acutely rational) emotions that cloud judgment.
Kavan's brief, lucid stories have the quality of remembered nightmares.
The first work published under the name of Anna Kavan rather than Helen Ferguson, Asylum Piece - a patchwork of interlinked vignettes that could be considered a novel or a short story collection - is sometimes brilliant, but a little patchy.
The title story, made up of eight mini-stories, is somewhat hit and miss - while it's the longest and most complete piece, it's also the only one to deviate from the first-person narrative (seemingly always belonging to the same person) Kavan uses elsewhere, and it suffers for that.
It is a house of no definite architectural design, half old, half new.
The lines of the new part are straightforward and easily read like a sum in simple arithmetic; the old part is oblique, full of treacherous angles, with a roof that sags like the back of a worn-out horse and is blotched with scabrous patches of lichen.
When I first came to live here it was an entirely new house-- that is to say, it had certainly not been standing for more than ten or fifteen years.
The stories in this volume comprise two discrete types. The collection begins with a series of first-person pieces, many of which conjure up strong parallels to Kafka’s The Trial (Kafka was one of Kavan's key influences in her shift of name and writing style), and in general portray a narrator consumed with the interior life, specifically its decay under the apparent assault of depression, while being oppressed by some unidentified official body (as in Kafka’s work, the faceless nameless authority never explains itself).Full review here.

Moving & intriguing. Her words become the narrator in the back of your mind. A truly gifted writer. 15 years after reading this book, there are scenes still fresh in my memory, which can easily be pieced together. If your current reality is nothing great to wake up to, this book is a good distraction. If you're in a good mood currently, I don't suggest reading it, as there is a sombre tone which can penetrate into your current routine and leaving you feeling very melancholy.
The very short stories in Asylum Piece feel like sketches, interesting, but not fully developed into satisfying works.
Many of them are obviously stories stemming from Kavan’s personal experience with drug addiction and being committed to an asylum, but Kavan’s dark, paranoid view of the world remains aesthetically intriguing even when the meaning of the story is clear.
I wish that any of the stories were long enough to build something on that aesthetic, but the pieces here are so short and simplistic that they’ve barely begun before they’re over.
The stories in Asylum Piece are Kavan honing her craft in preparation of her masterpiece, and are not particularly great in their own right.
From reading about the author, I got the sense that her fiction has a family resemblance to the dark fiction I've been interested in.
So I decided to give her books a go: I got this book, and also her _Julia and the Bazooka_ from the public library.Its mostly literary fiction, with some tendency toward the surrealistic and science fiction.
In some stories, Anna Kavan writes like Kafka reincarnated.
Suddenly I saw that the suitcase standing on the floor near him was my own...The other group of stories take place in a mental institution.
Frankly, though true, I think this is all a bit misleading as to what you will get in her writing.Her prose is spare, there is no sloppiness or excess.
Her images are carefully described and haunting, the characters' emotions -- whether basic or subtle -- have a weight to them.Instead of being Kafkaesque (with all the frustration and claustrophobia that entails) I find her writing poignant and achingly beautiful.
If anyone, she makes me think of Chekhov.
This is the second book by Anna Kavan I've read (Ice was the first), and the second I've loved.
This book works as a whole or as separate stories, and is probably the most haunting evocation I've come across of the aura of dread around asylums in the early twentieth century.
The whole notion that a woman who did not conform to what was called rational behaviour could be placed in a lonely, forbidding oubliette, in the name of curing her, is wonderfully explored, and some powerful pieces delve into neurosis, paranoia and dissociation.
Great stuff; Kavan deserves to be better known.
Forces working against the protagonist materializing out of nothing...reminds me at times of Kafka. I liked this collection a little more than I liked Julia and the Bazooka - though I do love the short story at the end of that collection after which the book is named. Perhaps it's a structural thing...I felt more solidity (?) perhaps... in these pieces? There's more of that "bottom dropping out from under ..." sort of feel in JATB... which I liked in the final story. Anyway, I liked reading this collection, its stark and also (at times) child-like perceptions.
An incredible first half is let down by a much weaker second.
As the more descriptive reviews will tell you, this is a brief biographical chronicle of Kavan’s descent into mental illness and subsequent confinement in an institution, with a brief, poignant, and brutally depressing tour of some of the asylum’s other inmates, though some of them may be (parts of?) Kavan herself.
Kavan provides us with a very personal – first person, in fact - view of an internal world at the onset of mental illness.
"a blither world"
She is very much a stylistic link between Woolf and Bowen, but perhaps the sheer unclassifiable nature of Kavan���s work���and I���m judging this solely on Asylum Piece and Ice as I���ve not read more just yet���is the cause for the other two writers being better known.Kavan mixes autobiography, surrealism, dream, fantasy, reality, and speculative fiction all at once.
In other words, Kavan���s style is actually more in tune with the philosophical and self-analytical strains of modernism than even Woolf at her greatest.My main issue with this collection is that it wasn���t Ice, an attitude I couldn't help but have when beginning the stories.
В каждой из них упрочняется идея не просто медицинской помощи, но человеческой гуманности, по отношению к больным, Каван развивает простейшую мысль - такие же люди, как и все; такие же больные, которые не виноваты в своей болезни и хотят от нее избавиться.
Получается весьма слащаво из моих слов - "хотят тепла и любви" - но все обстоит иначе когда читаешь саму книгу: у Каван получилось изобразить не персонажей, а людей, это все меняет.Не понятным для меня осталась только история о девочке с пятном (в начале, когда героиня еще в школе).
First published in 1940, Asylum Piece is a novel composed of short stories or vignettes that chart the course of apparent persecution, paranoia, and mental breakdown, as suffered and witnessed by the female narrator.
Anna Kavan’s extraordinary prose style – simple, almost clipped, even slightly alien – gives the novel a peculiar and unsettling edge.
In one brief piece, the narrator feels threatened by her own house: “When I first came to live here it was an entirely new house – that is to say, it had certainly not been standing for more than ten or fifteen years.
Kavan struggled with a heroine addiction along with events of hopelessness leading her to psychiatric institutions.  Asylum Piece  provides a collection of intimate writings of her time in an asylum.

Asylum Piece,
Asylum Piece,
a front row seat of her kaleidoscope of thoughts as her mind aimlessly wonders from paranoia with heavy ominous tones.
Despite the disturbing nature of her writings they have a lovely ethereal feel which creates a conflict bordering on a brutal beauty.
Insightful collection of a woman allowing herself to be exposed in all her nakedness unveiling her mind to the world.

This book is pretty great. I especially like how the narrator at times finds connection, but these moments are also heartbreaking-- the girl with the birthmark who she can't save, the dog that is the only one who understands her, the lover/friend who kisses her though it's only a goodbye kiss, and the birds that are beautiful but others can't/don't see. Obviously, Kavan is also really great at capturing feelings of utter despair, like Machines in the Head.
