This is one of my ALL-TIME TOP FAVORITE historical romance books.I actually have the pink flowered paperback version - which was released in 1989 - and I think I first read it when I was 12 years old...in 1995.
Anyway, I am mentioning this now because I just snagged the kindle version of this bad boy (and it's sequel (The Wedding, which actually IS my ALL-TIME TOP favorite historical read) cause they were both on sale for $1.99.
But anyramble, if you are interested in trying some awesome, old-fashioned, classic Highlander romance, these are the tops and will always be some of my all-time favorites.
5 Lady Kincaid Stars The Bride is the first book I have read from Julie Garwood and I loved it. I loved the set up, the plot, and love Jamie and Alec! I love me some sexy Scottish highland romances and this one was great. From the start Alec shined. He was so sexy, cocky and 100% bad ass Scottish warrior! But what I loved most about Alec was he had a tender side. Don't get me wrong though Alec could be damn ruthless when he needed. Jamie had me laughing. She was the perfect blend of sassy, brave
The Bride is the first book I have read from Julie Garwood and I loved it.
I loved the set up, the plot, and love Jamie and Alec!
I love me some sexy Scottish highland romances and this one was great.
From the start Alec shined.
He was so sexy, cocky and 100% bad ass Scottish warrior!
But what I loved most about Alec was he had a tender side.
Jamie had me laughing.
I thought her and Alec made an adorable couple.
It was a sweet, feel good read that made me smile the whole time!
I was like, "Why are you being mean to this sweetheart?" Her heart is so big, that you just want to be friends with her, which is always a plus when it comes to characters in the books I read and enjoy.2.
As usual for a Julie Garwood hero, Alec thinks he is in charge, and that has his marriage all figured out, and Jamie will adjust to doing things his way.
It was so lovely to read this book, and enjoy the zany results when Jamie and Alec met.
This was such a fun, loveable read, and it's yet another Julie Garwood book that's going on my keeper shelf.
Huge 5+ StarsI loved this book.
Jamie has become one of my all time favorite heroines.
Julie Garwood has a way of writing heroines that are strong willed without becoming annoying (hard to do in my opinion.) Jamie's¬†one of the most endearing character I've read.
She's such a sweetheart.I really liked Alec's character.
I couldn't stop laughing during the part where he finally told Jamie he loved her.
*sigh* The secondary characters were three-dimensional and fun to read.
I will definitely read this book again; especially, if I want a good laugh or cheering up.
: A little wishful thinking can't be bad."Beak wished Laird Kincaid could get a clear look at Jamie now, for her violet eyes fairly sparkled with joy."I don't even know where to start with that sentence.STEP FIVE : YOU'VE GOT A DEAL!!
Did you get a good look at her, then?" he added in a rush.Alec nodded."You'll be taking her with you, won't you?"The Kincaid stared at the old man a long minute before answering."Aye, Beak.
I don't really care if that's believable, I make the choice to not read about this kind of stories anyway.
Highlander romances never really appealed to me, well, because I like my men in pants.
That's like real life for me - messy bun, seven-year-old high school volleyball shirt, Cheeto stains and all.Jamie's poor sap of a father forgets to pay his taxes, and the king makes him pay by marrying off his daughters.
. .attentions - she lets him in her pants because he's really bloody hot, alright?
While Jamie trys to find a home in the cold Scottish castle, and a husband in her gruff lover, she doesn't know there is someone trying to take her life.
(sigh) Jamie is the youngest daughter of a Baron who has been ordered by their King to marry a Highland Laird.
Because of her house managing skills, the Baron was hesitant to part with Jamie and was hoping the Laird would pick one of his other daughters.
Jamie is in danger and Alec must find out who wants his wee lass out of the picture.I love The Bride.
Jamie and Alec are one of my all time favourite couples.
I had been wanting to read this book for years, and I finally got to it, it was WONDERFUL!!! I love Highlander type books and this one has got to be one of the best EVER!!! EVER!!! Lol. I'm so excited right now.
Greedy, greedy (and therefore disappointed) reader here üôãüèªBrief Summary of the Storyline:  This is Jamie and Alec's story.
There is some suspense, a few funny moments, a few sexy times...and they get a HEA ending.POV: This alternated between focusing mainly on Jamie and Alec in 3rd person narrative.
I would say that it was more focused on Jamie though, and I would've liked to know more about what Alec was feeling.Overall Pace of Story:  Good.
A little hate-to-love dynamics going on at first.H rating: 3 stars.
A loser guy doesn't pay his taxes and as his punishment he has to give two of his daughters to some Scottish men to marry.Hmmm, and this punishes the man how?
The way I see it, this guy just had his expenses go way down by unloading a couple of girls.
Obviously she is chosen by the most powerful Scottish Laird, Alec.
Alec is kind of a dick.
Maybe even a general.Salute your general!But, don't worry because Jamie's beauty means that she is special.
I'd rate this 3.75 stars (or whatever a B minus rating would convert to).I wanted to love this book because it's a favorite for so many readers, but couldn't quite get there.
There were several parts that made me smile, like when the heroine wears black to her wedding, and when she dumps water on the soldiers who are making fun of English women.
She can heal the sick, willingly sacrifices herself for her (older) sisters, rescues orphaned children, tames wild boars, rides a horse standing up, makes every hardened Scottish soldier she meets fall in love with her, and looks like an angel when sleeping.

But THE BRIDE went on sale for Kindle and I bought it, and then it was voted as our December book of the month in my romance book club, so it seemed like I was destined to read it.I haven't read a lot of Scottish romances.
I kept thinking that this book was set in the 18th century, and half-expected them to be wielding guns instead of swords.In the book's defense, the romance is decent.
I MUST SAY SAY THAT I LOVED THIS BOOK‚Ä¶.. will get back to proper reviewing soon! AFTER MY ROAD TRIP TO IRELAND ....xxI
There are also many love making scenes that will have romance fans swooning over with joy and I was nearly swooning myself when I read these scenes!There are many sex scenes in this novel and they are a bit graphic in nature, so anyone who does not like sex scenes might want to skip over these scenes.Overall, ‚ÄúThe Bride‚Äù is definitely a novel worth checking out and fans of Highlander romance will definitely enjoy this awesome novel and I am definitely looking forward to reading more of Julie Garwood‚Äôs works!Review is also on: Rabbit Ears Book Blog
What a charming story was that!!! Really, guys!!! That book caught me by surprise...I'm used to read renegence historical romance and this medieval was my first, but i enjoyed it very much.I won't lie to you. In the beginning, i was a little bit lost, but then the storyline captivated me...No, no, no... I don't think that it was the story only... I really loved this couple and especially Jamie...She made me laughing all the time with her actions...And she manage to make the cruel, wild warrior
People were saying that he had killed his first wife and that he was a cruel savage...After some interesting facts Alec chose Jamie to become his wife...For the first stare between them something happened but both of them were too much stubborn to acknoledge it and to admit it!!!As the time was passing they were starting to care even more for each other and they started to change their opinions...Jamie even though in the beginning was a little bit afraid of the huge warrior that was her husband, she began to be fascinating by him and the feelings that born inside of her...Alec even though that his wife was a stubborn, opinioned little creature, she made him crazy from love, even though that he used to think that women were just a possession...Jamie was a strong, almost indepented woman of that time.
As√≠ podr√≠a tirarme hasta ma√±ana.Para colmo sus hermanas y padre son para echarles de comer a parte, las hermanas al comienzo del libro pens√© que se trataban de cr√≠as pero resulta que son m√°s mayores que Jamie.Mary es un personaje que cuando lees te dan ganas de sacarte los ojos, por que s√≥lo sabe berrear y escudarse en su hermana.
las hermanas gemelas de Jamie, son una mezcla de ni√±as del resplandor y la ni√±a del exorcista, lo poco que salen en el libro le han faltado echar espuma por la boca.
"Did you get a good look at her, then?" he added in a rush.Alec nodded."You'll be taking her with you, won't you?" The Kincaid stared at the old man a long minute before answering."Aye, Beak. I'll be taking her with me."  An absolute must read for any Garwood fans! Quite simply a treasure of a historical romance. If you can get ahold of the audio, this is one of the better narrators I've heard as well. If not, the story stands on it's own, a masterpiece set in the Scottish Highlands.This is the
"Did you get a good look at her, then?" he added in a rush.Alec nodded."You'll be taking her with you, won't you?" The Kincaid stared at the old man a long minute before answering."Aye, Beak.
At times, my heart just broke for her, as Alec takes a long time to see what his wife truly needs from him is a place to belong.
But this gentle, silly English woman with her strange English ideals and her stubbornness arrive at his home and completely uproots him.Alec's life is even more uprooted than Jamie's is...and she's the one who moved to a new country :D:D:D My favorite thing about this book is it's unpredictability.
Loved it. Listened to the audiobook. The narrator was excellent with her accents, but I found her to be just a tad bit too dramatic. It took a little while to get used to her.
Here‚Äôs a list of facts about Jamie:  She can read and write She speaks perfect Gaelic She is an expert physician (the kind who can heal otherwise-fatal wounds with a few crushed leaves and a tincture) - She can shoot a bow and arrow with incredible accuracy - She can throw a knife with incredible accuracy - She rides her spirited horse bareback, with incredible skill - Her riding skills are so incredible that she frequently stands up while riding her spirited horse bareback - She can instantly charm even the most stubborn Scottish soldier - She is constantly saving small children - She is constantly being saved by her laird husband - She is flawlessly beautiful (violet eyes, streaming raven hair, etc) - She single-handedly unites the Highland clans - I kind of want to punch Jamie by now, don‚Äôt you?She has a couple of token flaws: she has a poor sense of direction, and she‚Äôs an insufferable know-it-all (Garwood may not have intended that reaction, now that I think about it).
The banter and the dialogue are exuberant fun and I'm with this hot higlander Alec and his lovely bride Jamie from page one until the nice romantic ending.Sure it's predictable and of course kind of unrealistic - BUT always with great warmth, sweetness and it's all so funny wonderfully written.
"The Bride" is romantic, just enough steamy and utterly enjoyable - read and enjoy with a smile on your lips.I Like - much, a lovely goodread!~~~~~~~~~~...and Thanks to my sweet, witty GR-friend Kathleen who recommended me to read some novels by Ms Garwood.
Julie Garwood is my all time favorite historical romance author.
I have been binge re reading her books on audible.
Don't plan to write much by way of reviews since there is plenty already out there.
Get yourself in a "historical romance" frame of mind before reading.
Almost all of them have widower manwhores matched up with virgins.
Or a very young widow matched with a manwhore.
But almost all JG books are insta something and the men are faithful after meeting.
The men are alpha and struggle to express their feelings.
I love the way she writes banter.
I have to say I was disappointed by this book.
The story it self was just fine, it's the characters that bugged me to no end.
The way the characters were written was very confusing because at the beginning you are miss lead that the heroine is a strong and independent woman who is capable and smart, yet a few chapters later and a few conversations with her and all those descriptions are tossed out the window and instead we have a frightful little mouse who cant string a few sentences together with out sounding like an idiot.
All those character flaws prevented me from enjoying the book.
So all in all I'm very disappointed.
The book had great potential.

‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ What can I say about this story other than a classic Julie Garwood book still delivers? I‚Äôve lost count of the number of times I‚Äôve read this one; thought I‚Äôd try the audiobook this time. The narration, by Rosalyn Landor, brings this book to life. I‚Äôll be seeking out more of her audiobooks.
It was captivating, witty and absolutely perfect.I loved Jamie and Alec for themselves and as a couple.
Alec was an arrogant warrior with a tender heart, Jamie was quick, feisty and relentless.
Their clothing is called their plaid, Mary.
Plaid,‚Äù Beak repeated with a growl.
I think they‚Äôd take exception to hearing it called a woman‚Äôs gown.‚Äù ‚ÄúThen it‚Äôs little wonder to me why they have to fight all the time,‚Äù Jamie interjected.
‚ÄúThey have to defend their gowns.‚Äù ‚ÄúThey aren‚Äôt gowns.‚Äù This was an enchanting read with a lot of humour, sweetness and fun.I recommend the brownie and definitely recommend The Bride.
Where is the sixth star?I waited forever for this book but it was well worth the wait - it was utterly amazing.
I laughed so much.
But the humor didn't take away the divine romance between Alec and Jamie.The trouble with too good books is that there is no words to do it justice.
I loved everything about this book!
Alec was an amazing √ºber hot hero.
The side characters was great.
The mystery was great.
There was plenty of laughs!
Highland romances are quickly becoming a favorite and I am so excited to continue to explore the rest of Julie Garwood's books.
Super funny!!!
Loved it when I read it years ago and read it for a PIFM challenge and still loved it!
Even though I've been reading romantic erotica the last few years it is still nice to read a well-written and funny romance.
So enjoyable!*****March 16, 2017*****No matter how many times I re-read this book I still always enjoy the humor and the dialogue between Alec and Jamie.
From the first word to the last word this book has always kept my attention no matter how many times I read it.
Sometimes you need to read something different.
A book taking place in a far away way land, where the people are ruled by kings, lusty lords and lairds following his proclamations.
Futures are given within a blink of an eye and titles are fought and died for.
Julie Garwood does an amazing job capturing the sights and sounds of Scotland and allowing us readers to bring home a taste with us.
A five star read and recommended to all who'd wish life were of simpler times.
Where men were men and fought for honor, and yielded broadswords and Halbards with deadly precision.
2.5 Stars This was a disappointing read. Maybe my expectations were too high because I love me some arranged marriages. But Alec quickly and swiftly sent my expectations tumbling wayyyyy down. Now a little bit of brute in a man is sexy, but he was just an utter a**hole who had me shaking my head most of the book wondering... When he wasn't thinking or saying this.. He was thinking or saying this... Or sitting around with his friends saying... And when he wasn't getting on my nerves, Jamie was.
But Alec quickly and swiftly sent my expectations tumbling wayyyyy down.
When he wasn't thinking or saying this..
He was thinking or saying this...
She was pleading for Alec to have mercy, whereas I would've been like 'Off with his head!'.The sex rated between hot and ok.
When Alec finallllllllllly got his head out of his behind and realized he still had a heart, then things got very sweet.
His starting to be more affectionate towards Jamie and listening to her ideas more bumped my idea of him up some, but Alec wasn't fully redeemed in my eyes by the end.
** 4 ‚Äúwell now I like historical romance too‚Äù STARS **
