Zeus needed someone to blame, so of course he’d picked the handsomest, most talented, most popular god in the pantheon: me. This might be my favourite Riordan book. I was actually disappointed with his last one - The Sword of Summer - and I began to question in my review if it was finally time for Mr. R. to take a step back from these books about Greek, Roman and Egyptian gods. The conflicts were similar and the teen "voices" had begun to blend into one. Magnus Chase could just as easily have b
But he's actually an age-old immortal who has been cast out of Olympus by Zeus and turned into a regular human teenager.
Apollo doesn't even pretend he's a do-gooder; in fact, it's clear from the beginning that he's out for himself and views humans as "meat sacks".
You don't get to be an old god like Apollo without making a LOT of enemies.
I'm still not 100% sure I would want to read any more books that focus on teenage demigods (we've kind of been there and done that, in my opinion), but I will definitely see Apollo's story through to the end.
Suffice to say, Apollo, you are awesome. This book made me literally "LOL" multiple times and brought a smile to my face seeing old characters I love again. YAY!Ill be uploading my review to my youtube channel this week!
4.5 I LOVED THIS! A review will be up on my channel on Friday!
hidden oracleso fun and hilariousi heart apollo(a haiku book review in honor of the god of poetry)
I've always loved the way uncle Rick writes Apollo (and all the gods, tbh)!
And hopefully also Percy and Annabeth and Hazel and Frank YES PLEASEEEEEE.I'M FANGIRLING SO MUCH.First impressions, September 2015: OMFG OMFG OMFG.EDIT: I don't understand why people complain so much about Rick sticking to this universe and being "like Cassandra Clare".
SO WHAT IF THE AUTHORS LOVE THE UNIVERSE THEY CREATED?
They are the authors and they can write whatever they want.
If you don't want to read more of their amazing books, then you don't have to do it!
"Is anything sadder than the sound of a god hitting a pile of garbage bags?" Or to paraphrase, is there anything sadder than your favorite author becoming a sellout?It's blatantly obvious Riordan isn't even trying anymore. He knows he can put out a steaming heap of crap and Percy fangirls and Solangelo diehards would still be clawing over each other for a copy, sending This Hidden Disappointment to the top of the NYT bestseller's list.I don't understand Solangelo—Will and Nico. They never had c
He knows he can put out a steaming heap of crap and Percy fangirls and Solangelo diehards would still be clawing over each other for a copy, sending This Hidden Disappointment to the top of the NYT bestseller's list.I don't understand Solangelo—Will and Nico.
I expected their relationship to develop more in The Hidden Oracle, not a simple PSA about LGBTQIA rights from Riordan through Apollo.
I'm glad we're seeing more diversity in campers, with Chinese and Brazilian demigods, but the way they're presented feels like a big neon sign flashing, "Look how inclusive I'm being!"Solangelo isn't the problem.
I can live with them and the obvious fanservice in the form of (view spoiler)[Leo (hide spoiler)] and Percy's reappearance.
Today, he is Lester Papadopoulos, a mere, ungifted mortal.There’s only one thing for him to do now: join the demigods at Camp Half-Blood.What makes The Hidden Oracle incredibly interesting is Apollo himself.
But funnily enough, that’s what makes him so likeable.Plus, there is nothing more endearing than seeing a god care for his half-human offspring.
Apollo is very protective when it comes to his children and friends.No one can say that he only cares about himself.As usual with any Rick Riordan book, The Hidden Oracle is filled with adventure, action, danger, mythology, monstrous creatures, originality, friendship and fun moments!My qualm?
“Things can turn out differently, Apollo. That's the nice thing about being human. We only have one life, but we can choose what kind of story it's going to be.” Dammit, Rick Riordan. This book was actually really good. WHAT THE HELL. When I first heard about Trials of Apollo, I had very mixed feelings. On one hand I felt like, “Jeez Rick, please don’t turn into a huge sell-out.” On the other hand, I was like, “I GET TO BE REUNITED WITH ALL THE PJO/HOO CHARACTERS YET AGAIN!! YESSSS.”Honestly, t
I always loved Apollo in the PJO books, and it’s amazing to get to read a whole story in his perspective.
Not that I don’t mind a good journey story, but I was relieved this book didn’t follow the typical Riordan formula.This is where The Kane Chronicles and Magnus Chase, and even Heroes of Olympus fell a little flat for me––I liked them, but it was starting to feel like the same story over and over again: “the characters go on some long journey, they meet a bunch of quirky mythological beings along the way!” The Hidden Oracle, on the other hand, mostly just takes place at Camp Half-Blood.
1. 5 stars A Tired Spin on the Same Old Formula I’ll be perfectly blunt: you don’t look to Riordan for originality. We all know this to be true. Hell, the very first Percy Jackson books rode the Harry Potter-ripoff wave to C-List stardom and even then he just rewrote ancient myths in a modern format. Now he’s going back to his roots and just ripping off his previous stories under that hypnotic guise of nostalgia. We return to Camp Half-Blood Prince and meet some familiar characters like *Percy a
But Percy’s reappearance being very much like his girlfriend’s before him again shows that Riordan is running out of fresh material and reusing his own plots.Cringey Dad Jokes: Mythology Edition*SMH* Rick writes Apollo in his own voice: desperately unhip yet trying way too effing hard to be cool.
I feel like this whole book could have used a good editor to show Riordan that so much of it is just cringey or trite; but according to a source with the same publisher, they just don’t care about quality and expect the author to do it all.
This was tons of fun! The perspective of a god is great to read from, especially since Apollo made for a hilarious narrator. While I didn't enjoy it quite as much as his other books, it was still great!
10/08/2015I have two reactions right now:1. Apollo = 2. "And yes, this means we’ll get to know what’s going on with fan-favorite characters Leo and Nico. And, of course, Percabeth." That's it, I died. PERCABETH, GUYS!09/17/15HOLY. FREAKING. SHIT. Brb peeing my pants in excitement. Although I hope it's more like the original Percy Jackson and the Olympians series rather than Heroes of Olympus.
I need to start reading Percy Jackson so I can continue with Heroes of Olympus and The Trials of Apollo.
The others seemed confused. Then the glow became brighter: a holographic golden sickle with a few sheaves of wheat, rotating just above Meg McCaffrey.A boy in the crowd gasped. “She’s a communist!” The Hidden Oracle continues right after The Blood of Olympus. Apollo aka Lester Papadopoulos is banished from Olympus. He used to be a god, when he's mortal, he doesn't have his power and that makes him very upset. In this book, you will meet the same old characters such as Percy, Nico, Chiron and Wi
So The Hidden Oracle is for the fans who always want more of Rick Riordan's stories, the world of Percy Jackson and Greek gods.Apollo is a remarkable character from the first page.
Rick Riordan pulled me into the story easily as if there was magic in it when I touched the book and it told me that: 'Love me !
I love The Hidden Apollo more than The Blood of Olympus because I feel like this is a good start for the brand new stories to come.
I want to see Apollo's development in the next book and how hard he learns his lessons for both him and Meg. Can't wait !http://goo.gl/E0blSX
I remember when I started this book last year  without reading the previous ten books, one of my best friends here told me I have to read previous books. I was sad because I had read, I think, 5 chapters or so and I was quite enjoying it. And reading ten whole books seemed a huge mess to me. Now I understood that my friend was right.**Thank you, if you are reading this review. :)**>>The book started off in an excellent manner. Very much interesting. It was so hilarious how Apollo was, lit
I was sad because I had read, I think, 5 chapters or so and I was quite enjoying it.
And reading ten whole books seemed a huge mess to me.
Now I understood that my friend was right.**Thank you, if you are reading this review.
One thing I would mention that this book seemed boring to me at some points in the middle.
Maybe it was not boring?
I just felt it that way because I am reading his books almost in row?
I pretty much liked this book.
But I think previous ten books in the series are better than this.
This was the conversation my sister and I had about this book.ME: You know, I hate too long series.
After, don't know, ten books, don't you think one must accept it is time to stop?
It's not fair, too often they come up with idiocies that are just shadows of their first works-SIS: You liked TID better than TMI.ME: ...and I can't help but feel exploited by their selfish purpose of making money, money, money-SIS: You know, I heard Rick Riordan is going to publish a book about Apollo.ME: ...and- wait what?
BOOKTUBEATHON 2016 BOOK #4I really enjoyed this, though not as much as other books in this universe. IT HAS A LOT TO LIVE UP TO! Apollo's narration was hilarious and amazing and EVERYTHING and there was a really important narrative about relationships, specifically abusive ones, that I am really glad to see and interested to see play out. Honestly, Riordan's books will always be some of my favorites because of how great the world and characters are and how he manages to put important conversation pieces in his books!
SO YAY.WHAT TO EXPECT IN THIS BOOK:• The glorious god Apollo is now a mortal teenage boy with acne.• Percy Jackson (!!!!) and I'd say he has more than a cameo because he's at the beginning and helps out in the finale too (!!!!)• SO MUCH WITTY DIALOGUE IT'S GLORIOUS.• So you'll laugh.
Arguing ensues.• Evil ants• Plenty of people being lost / beaten up / stabbed / liked by lions• Epic and obscure Greek mythology tales that I didn't know so dangit I learned stuff• Peaches• Really really really bad haikus****NOTE**** If you haven't read the The Lost Hero (Heroes of Olympus) series DO NOT read Trials of Apollo yet.
I will read anything that this man writes
"Nothing is more tragic than loving someone to the depths of your soul and knowing they cannot and will not ever love you back." Time and time again, it has been proven that whenever I'm reading a Rick Riordan book, I read so fast that the words blurred. I mean, I can't stop flipping the goddamn pages like there's no tomorrow. Maybe, it's the humor or probably, something else.Anyway...The Hidden Oracle is... wait for it... an entertaining read. I don't say, right? Hahaha! If you loved PJO and H
Maybe, it's the humor or probably, something else.Anyway...The Hidden Oracle is...
Yet, The Hidden Oracle is also different in many ways.For the record, I like Apollo.
I know he is selfish, a self-absorbed god and an asshole but his voice in this book made me like him.
I liked how his character developed emotionally and intellectually.
I like their distinct voices and personalities and the genuine feelings they are propagating in my direction, either it's happiness or the opposite of it.We do have a great plot in this book.
Can't wait to read the next book!!
I'm glad that The Hidden Oracle came something as a breathe of fresh air because we don't have a demigod hero in this book.
I used to be a god.Apollo, the god of archery:is one of the funniest character that Uncle Rick II has created.
His self-entitlement knows no boundaries and of all the heroes that Uncle Rick II has made in the past,Apollo is the least heroic character.His chin was so weak I was tempted to create a GoFoundMe campaign to buy him a better jaw.-ApolloOf course, part of the reason why The Hidden Oracle is awesome is because Nico and Will (SolAngelo) is here.
(He's so cute and hot and gahhhhh)OH BY THE WAY GUYS I'M ABOUT TO SEE RICK RIORDAN IN AN HOUR THAT'S WHY I'M WRITING THIS RIGHT NOW.~quick edit #1: to the people who are saying rick is becoming a "cassandra clare" by writing more series, stop it.
if you don't want to read more wonderful books, then don't.
which means that cassandra clare and rick riordan can write whatever they want and YOU can't say anything.
but don't bash or hate on the authors with negative reviews.~OHMYGODS EVERYONE FREAK OUT RICK IS WRITING A NEW FIVE BOOK SERIESOHMYGODSOHMYGODSOHMYGODSOHMYGODS I HOPE THIS HAS SOME PERCABETH AND CALEO AND ALL OF EM.
It was published on May 3, 2016, and is the first book in The Trials of Apollo series, the second spin-off of the Percy Jackson & the Olympians series.
Joined by the demigod Meg McCaffrey, Apollo goes to Camp Half-Blood, where he discovers that he will have to regain control of the five oracles of Ancient Greece in order to receive pardon from Zeus.عنوانها: پیشگویی پنهان؛ آپولو: پیشگویی پنهان؛ نویسنده: ریک ریوردان؛ تاریخ نخستین خوانش: روز بیست و ششم ماه مارس سال 2016 میلادیعنوان: پیشگویی پنهان؛ نویسنده: ریک ریوردان؛ مترجم: فرزام حبیبی اصفهانی؛ تهران، آریابان، 1395، در 347 ص؛ شابک: 9789647196659؛ عنوان: آپولو: پیشگویی پنهان؛ نویسنده: ریک ریوردان؛ مترجم: آرزو مقدس؛ تهران، نشر پرتقال، 1396، در 400 ص؛ شابک: 9786008675556؛ آپولو، یکی از ایزدان اُلمپ، چون پدرش زئوس را، خشمگین کرد، از اُلمپ بیرونش کردند، و به آدمیزاد تبدیل شد.
Entre las mil y una sagas de Riordan, creo que Las pruebas de Apolo recupera la originalidad con un narrador distinto.
Es decir, Riordan siempre escribe con humor e ironía, pero Apolo destaca entre la sucesión de protagonistas semidioses ingeniosos y carismáticos.
El dios más vanidoso convertido en mortal a las órdenes de una sin techo de trece años e ssin duda un personaje que da tanto juego como promete.
Es un poco introductoria (la trama "grande" de la saga" no empieza a aparecer hasta la mitad del libro).
Pero se le perdona.
Los cameos de algunos de mis personajes más queridos de sagas anteriores lo compensan (casi) todo.
THIS COMES OUT IN MAY WITH SO MANY OTHER RELEASES BUT IM GOING TO BUY IT ANYWAY BECAUSE I'VE SOLD MY SOUL TO THE PERCY JACKSON SERIES.
:)he is completely a DRAMA QUEEN (he even approved himself as a dramatic god somewhere in his haikus.)Of course he was a whining wimpy Narcissistic (sometimes idiot) character at first (& that was fun!) he was an immortal punished to be a mortal; those are very different states...How do you punish a powerful immortal??By making him powerless & mortalbut he started to change soon.He stood up for his mission, because he believed that was something he must have done himself:he changed from this:I would rather have pick a nice group of heroes & sent them...to this:"I won't allow any others to put themselves at risk."My heart melted when he was singing; like I could actually hear him told his stories, his remorse.
Edit 08/10/15We have more details on THE HIDDEN ORACLE!
of) the old characters definitely makes me feel a little less nervous about this book so yes, PLEASE BE FABULOUS.
I AM READY TO ACCEPT YOU INTO MY ARMS.
Edit 12/09/15W.
I'm not sure how I feel about this.
And I also had a feeling that Rick Riordan said that he was done dabbling in this world (but clearly I was wrong...
MY FEELINGS ARE A MESS GARGH.
I am excited for this series all the same, of course, because Riordan is one of my most favourite authors of all time.
Love this book so much and I hope to pick up the sequel soon : )...RICK RIORDAN HAS DONE IT AGAIN.
I loved being back in camp half blood and I absolutely loved Apollo as the main character!!
He's just so hilarious and sassy :D I also loved seeing all the old characters again and it just made me want to cry because there was so much nostalgia :')Overall, I flew through this novel and I am so excited for the next book.
I will be uploading a full review on my blog soon so stay tuned for that!!
2.5 stars and they're all for Percy Jackson.Aaaagh I wanted to like this one.
I think if I hadn't read the Heroes of Olympus books before this I might have a slightly better opinion because I wouldn't know what Rick Riordan's capable of (buuut I'd recommend finishing that series first or you'll be spoiled).
trying too hard?I COULD NOT STAND Apollo.
I wish Meg had had more character development because I wasn't a fan of her in the end either.Ok I know I sound like a total grouch in this review, so I promise I did enjoy the Heroes of Olympus & Percy Jackson books!
The result was a little disappointing.The main reason I didn't like this as much as Riordan's other books was the main character: Apollo.
Luckily, in the second half of the book, Apollo grew through his trials and challenges, at least a little.There was lots of great stuff in The Hidden Oracle.
And Apollo as an openly bi (or pan?) sexual character in a children's and YA series is great.
And I don't like Leo Valdez.
Seems like he's going to be a main character in the sequel.I doubt that I can handle both Apollo and Leo in The Dark Prophecy (The Trials of Apollo, #2).
