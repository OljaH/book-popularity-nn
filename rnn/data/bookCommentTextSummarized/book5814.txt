Apart of me kinda wants to read the books in this series I haven't read...but then another part of me is like nahhhhBut when I have kids someday they better want to read this series because I have tons of the books from it! Some of them I haven't even read lol
The kids now get to met a celebrity and of course he has a mystery that needs to be solved. Why haven't these kids open their own detective agency yet, who needs school when mysteries just keep falling in your lap.
I hope someday I'll be a famous movie star like Tate (a.k.a Jonathan). The author always writes the best Boxcar Children books ever. I'm glad I got back into this series that I started when I was 6 and stopped after just a few...
great when ur little
Not that Great........I only read it for Mystery :(-MysteriousRainbowNinja48It was very quick and not that much to it.KittyKatLove1313
One of my favorite childhood series. I read over a hundred of them. The first 50 or so were in order; after that I read whatever book I could get my hands on :)
