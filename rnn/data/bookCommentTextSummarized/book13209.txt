Don't confuse this for another bullshit self-help guide. This book is actually based on Dr. Seligman's (and others') extensive scientific research. It includes tests that offer valuable insight and effective techniques to battle those crippling negative thoughts. It's a bit lengthy, but that's the only downside I could find. Strongly recommended to anyone struggling with feelings of helplessness, pessimism, and/or depression.
>> having a drink and driving hoping for the best."EVERYTHING WILL BE OKAY!" sometimes gives you the excuse to hurt the people you love, because you think that later you can work things out.being optimistic is not an option in our lives.
prove and show that its not correct.(deeper, more lasting remedy)by a- find evidence to counter the pessimistic beliefsb- find alternative explanations for your actionsc- explore the implications of your pessimistic beliefsd- examine the usefulness of these beliefs example:you didn't do well on an exam, you feel like a loser and a stupid brick and u want to quit.(a) the person next to you got a lower grade.
In a nutshell, if you see bad events as persistent (things will never change), pervasive (this disappointment means my whole life is a disaster) and personal (I always mess things up), you are a pessimist and probably not a very happy camper.
Optimists see the world from an inverse perspective: for them, good events are pervasive, persistent and personal (i.e. they take credit for their own good fortune and they believe everything will turn out okay in the end) and bad events are temporary, compartmentalized and somebody else's fault.
How?! 😐
تعلم التفاؤل عندما تقرأ هذا العنوان لأول وهلة قد تظن أنك بصدد قراءة كتاب تنمية بشرية يتحدث عن اهمية 
2) Notice the tendency to think of a negative outcome as more likely than a positive one.
3) Notice the tendency to take responsibility or blame yourself for things that could possibly be someone else's fault.
The book includes a word of caution about blaming others.
The idea isn't to shirk self-responsibility, it's just to notice and reframe the knee-jerk habit of always blaming oneself for life's problems.I'm not doing justice to this small, powerful book.
It includes a link to an on-line test to take before reading the book.
The book raised my awareness to unhealthy thinking habits and gave me better solutions.
In fact, the author decries positive thinking, making the point that chanting inflated mantras to oneself daily is ineffective in the long run.Instead, he says, we must learn to rationally dispute our pessimistic thoughts the way we would dispute a verbal attack on us by a rival.
I agreed with everything he had to say about children, and about the effect divorce has on them (basically he says, don't divorce!, and, don't fight in front of them!, and in this day and age, that's a brave thing to say.
Long ago I read some N.V. Peale and Dale Carnegie about thinking positively, making friends, influencing people, stopping worrying, starting living.
And when the stuff that sold books started to get promoted on PBS channels as if it were Holy Writ, well, I exited, growling.With that preface, Martin Seligman's Learned Optimism was not a bad read.
Rather, he suggests that when humans can reduce their sense of helplessness and pessimism by examining the negative events in their lives, explaining to themselves that bad results are not personal, pervasive, or persistent.
In his meticulously researched yet engaging style, Seligman’s Learned Optimism makes a near bullet proof case for optimistic thinking as an inexhaustible engine for personal improvement.
The optimist identifies external forces that have influenced the negative event, thus they don’t take it as personally.
Next, optimists accept that negative events are both unavoidable and a temporary pause from an otherwise positive progress towards their goals.
Optimists will see the positive as personalized, permanent, and pervasive, while the pessimist will take good news as de-personalized, temporary, and isolated.
I was really looking for something to help me with a problem I have struggled with all my adult life: learned helplessness.
I felt a real sense of relief when I read what Seligman had to say on the unhappiness caused by learned helplessness (which is in turn caused by pessimism): this is a nameable and fixable problem.
(If you frequently experience people reacting negatively to you and you don't know what you said wrong, you might be a pessimist.)All I can say is, this book really helped me.
I've definitely felt a push into a better life from reading this book.
I've been fascinated with happiness in the last five years, so it seems obvious that this book, now considered a classic in the field, would be a book I should read.
And now that I have, I must say that I agree with the crown that has been placed upon this book's head; it's a worthy read for anyone interested in happiness.
I am also interested in reading his book entitled Flourish.
خوش بینی آموخته شده یا learned optimism. کتاب پر از آزمایشهای روانشناسیه که احتمال میده موجودات اگه یه مدت درماندگی رو تجربه کنن، درماندگی رو یاد میگیرن! نویسنده که روانشناس معروفی هم هست، توی چند فصل کتاب، اثر خوشبینی رو بر سلامت، ورزش و حتی انتخابات ریاست جمهوری و سنای آمریکا بررسی کرده. گرچه برای خود من خیلی از این تستها و پیش بینی هایی که کرده جای سوال داشت و مبهم بود، اما در کل کتاب جالبی بود و از بعضی حرفهای حاشیه ایش لذت بردم.
это не очередной селф-хелп, а научное исследование выученной беспомощности и ее последствий - пессимизма и депрессии. с тестами, примерами и советами. если постараться, оптимизму можно (и нужно) научиться. но, конечно, это работа над собой, а не волшебная пилюля.
Seligman is best known for developing the concept of learned helplessness, which is covered in most psychology courses.The book includes a test so you can determine how optimistic you are in different situations.
I think it's an extremely well-designed test because it's often hard to tell what the "right" answer is.The author studies optimism in many groups: rats, dogs, college students, life-insurance sales reps, East German working men, and Olympic swimmers.
He leads us through his intellectual journey, beginning when as a young grad student, he was exposed to a study in which a group of dogs had been shocked in a room they couldn’t escape, with no control over the shocks.
Seligmann had essentially proven that the second group had been “taught” that they could do nothing about the shocks.The book proceeds to explain Dr. Seligmann’s continued experiments.
You might say, “I didn’t study hard enough,” versus, “The professor made that test too hard.” The former is an example of taking failure personally.
Having spent some time in corporate America, I believe this false optimism is creating record levels of denial in our country, which seem to be extending at an alarming rate – all in the name of being more optimistic.
Only towards the end of the book does he seem to write more about the perils of optimism with a brief section in the middle regarding depressives having a more accurate memory and owning up much more readily to both their failures and their successes rather than the optimists who tend to look upon the past through rose-colored glasses.In all fairness, he does write a little bit about the problem of a lack of personal responsibility today and how he has no interest in personally endorsing this kind of psychology.
I think I am good example of this – I am bad at being sad and this has helped me at often being moderately happy.The core idea is that in addition to our talent and our desire to get better at something, success also depends on how we explain why things happen, or our explanation style.
And when errors are costly, pessimism can be a lifesaver, making us think through the worst of outcomes.Optimism is not a silver bullet, but learning more about it has helped me understand better why I am the person I am.
People who think it's OK to give electric shocks to dogs have made me learn pessimism about human compassion.Seligman created a ground-breaking experiment which was first performed with dogs back in the sixties.
The first dog was given electrical shocks which stopped whenever it pressed a panel with its nose.
Here the dog is given an electrical shock that it can easily escape by jumping over a low barrier.
And the results were, that dog number one (who’d received shocks it could turn off itself) quickly jumped over the barrier.
So did dog number three that had gotten no shocks.
Books offers a scientific approach towards recognizing your depression triggers and how you can unlearn pessimistic behaviors to inculcate more positive action oriented thinking. Overall, liked the book for its practical guidance and the fact that it's based on quantitative research.
The first chapter is titled 'Two Ways of Looking at Life'.
The index does list 'catastrophizers', which gets interesting.
Apparently, catastrophizers are into Permanence and Pervasiveness.
Permanence is about time and Pervasiveness is about space.I'm now about one-third into the book, it is good.
"All men are created equal" and "From each according to his abilities, to each according to his needs" were the ideological underpinnings of behaviorism as well as of the American and Soviet political systems respectively."How's the irony, all that Cold War paranoia when they were so alike in nature.I'm really getting into this book.I'm now over half way.
This 2nd reading took me to a new level of optimism and hope about my ability to control my emotional reaction to adversities in life.
Reading it again in a few years should bring me to a real level flourishing I really want to be in.
Optimism can be learned; depression can be cured.In the tradition of humanistic psychology and cognitive therapy, Seligman provides us a tool for growing toward an optimistic explanatory style: ABCDE.
When we ascribe a pessimistic (pervasive, permanent, personal) explanatory belief, we experience emotional consequences.
We can quickly tap into our inner dialogue and begin to challenge these destructive thought patterns.
But far from any boosterism, this book is actually a scientific vulgarization of "positive psychology." Since psychology is mired in so much quackery, I feel I have to underscore that this branch of psychology is widely recognized, and Martin Seligman is the 13th most frequently cited psychologist in introductory psychology textbooks of the twentieth century.
And it explains the value of pessimism, arguing that this is the better mode of thought whenever planning for an uncertain future.In recognition that psychology is also a popular DIY hobby, the book does include a few exercises at the end that you can try yourself.
Having someone else verify what I might have known in the back of my mind was really helpful becuase it has made me realise that I need to change the way I think.
The only problem I had with it is that he only uses the last two chapters to tell you how to change your way of thinking if youre a pessimist.
I wish he'd devoted more room in his book to help those of us in dire need of a change of thinking.
این علم امروزه خیلی پیشرفت کرده و هرچند هنوز نتونسته راهگشای کاملی باشه برای مشکلات بشر ولی در حد خیلی خوبی تونسته وقایع رو باز کنه و انسان رو به اون حقیقتی که اون پشت داره اتفاق میوفته آگاه کنه.
اما مدرنیته این انسان رو گرفتار درماندگی و به تبع اون گرفتار افسردگی کرد.این کتاب به خوبی تاثیر خوش بینی رو در زمینه های مختلف اعم از مشاغل پر تنش، سیاست، ورزش ، فرهنگ .
همچنین سلامت جسمانی بررسی میکنه و نشون میده برای رسیدن به موفقیت و داشتن زندگی شاداب تر به عنصر جدیدی نیاز هستش که خوش بینی انعطاف پذیر نامیده میشه.
This book has some good ideas and interesting evidence of the helpfulness of optimism, but I felt like a lot of it was too simplified.
It points at rumination and says it contributes to Depression, but I read that and I think, "So I'm supposed to stop thinking about things?
I don't think so." Seligman didn't really say that--his solution would obviously be to change the thought patterns instead of the act of thinking.
But anyway, like most business and self-help books, the book could have been condensed to a few chapters or even a list of points.
Which is not to say they aren't good points.
Really cool book explaining all the different thought processes we have and the differences of lives between optimists and pessimists.
I enjoyed reading this one, the main conclusion I got from the book is that optimism is a skill like any other that can be learned over time if we put in the effort.
The second thing would be that the book presented a good solutions for so many people that waste their lives on thinking in negative patterns and skepticism worrying about things that never happen.
Overall a great read from the field of positive psychology, you'll definitely be more optimistic and happier in your life if you read this book.
My dad had me read Learned Optimism when I was a kid.
I don't know if it had any effect, or if I am naturally optimistic--or perhaps particularly American?
But I do believe that an individual will be happier when optimistic, and that this book provides tools to get one there.
It's a philosophy book, at heart, but has practical steps to take.
Kind of like tai chi; you have to both absorb and practice to figure out how to make it work.Usually I hate self-help books, but this one didn't leave the usual bitter taste.
One of those rare books that balances research and insight with effective, empowering tools. It's so much more than just a wrongly touted work for the 'self help' or 'positive psychology' aisles.I found this book at the right time in my life, and it's played a huge role in moving from awareness to alteration of lifelong patterns of thinking. A must read for everyone.
Not just humans, but other mammals including dogs do seem in some sense to interpret events; this was one point of Seligman’s experiments.
Distraction is also a useful way of dealing with negative thoughts, especially ones you are brooding on.
One tricky problem for Seligman is that though optimistic people have better life outcomes, psychological experiments do suggest that pessimists do perceive the world more accurately (a victory for my team!).
My main criticism is that Seligman does not give examples of where he succeeded on a large scale in teaching people to be more optimistic, though he talks about and the “self-help” chapters clearly endeavor to do just that.
This book was transformational for me.
Through this reading, I realized that (probably like most people) there are times when I'm highly optimistic and times and I'm just the opposite.
The book was more than just theory, though.
I can apply the principles to me, my family, and others.
I almost didn't read the 2nd to last chapter about optimism in the workplace because I'm not "employed" outside of my home.
But, as I read it, I was able to relate it to my "work" tasks, of maintaining a home, keeping up with a family, volunteering at school and in Church, etc.
