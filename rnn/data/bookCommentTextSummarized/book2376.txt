611. The Years, Virginia WoolfThe Years is a 1937 novel by Virginia Woolf, the last she published in her lifetime. It traces the history of the genteel Pargiter family from the 1880s to the "present day" of the mid-1930s.عنوانها: سالها؛ نویسنده: ویرجینیا وولف؛ انتشاراتیها: (نگاه، روزگار، و ...) ادبیات؛ تاریخ نخستین خوانش: بیست و ششم ماه دسامبر سال 2007 میلادیعنوان: سالها؛ نویسنده: ویرجینیا وولف؛ مترجم: فرهاد بدریزاده؛ تهران، نگاه، 1377؛ در 568 ص؛ شابک: 9646174604؛ چاپ سوم 1385؛ چاپ دیگر: تهران ر
رمان «سال‌ها»، داستان: پسرها، دخترها، پدر، مادر، عمو، زن‌عمو، پسرعموها، دخترعموها، مستخدم و یک خانواده است.
«ویرجینیا وولف» از دیدگاه خویش کوشیده تا بیهودگی زندگی انسان، خانواده و فامیل را بنگارد.
کودکی نیز همواره دریغای ولف بوده، برای همین است که در کتاب‌هایش، کودکان و کودکی، جایگاه ویژه دارند.
مرگ از نگاه «ولف» وقوع حادثه‌ ای است بی‌همتا.
درست همانند زندگی: «دیلیا از خود پرسید: مرگ این است؟ لحظه‌ هایی چنین می‌نمود که چیزی در شرف وقوع بود».
آدم‌های «ولف» مصنوعی نیستند.
معنی دارند و گوشت، پوست و خون، خندیدن به همه چیز، به زندگی، کار درست و صادقانه آن‌هاست.
May 2nd 2015The Years is Virginia Woolf's ninth novel, and since it is composed of a series of vignettes about the Pargiter family covering a fifty year period, it is tempting to review it as if it were an old photograph album, one of those with layers of tissue to protect the images.
The result is a series of beautifully written vignettes, but without a strong underlying theme to knit them together (that’s why my initial attempt to review this book failed - I couldn't find a common thread and was left with nothing but...an elaborate teapot).(view spoiler)[ (hide spoiler)]To the Lighthouse was the first of Woolf's novels I read and I remember feeling that there was more beauty than realism in the text.
Capable of capturing the elusiveness of an atmosphere, of words left unsaid, of a particular landscape in any season, of the details that dress a room or the people that come in and go out of it scarcely leaving any trace, Woolf manages to give human quality to the passage of time, the real protagonist of this story.It’s true that she uses the Pargiter, a bourgeois family in extinction at the beginning of the twentieth century, to flesh out something as ungraspable as the passage of time.
Woolf's concern is not the quotidian, and often not the particular, but the structural.
Woolf deliberately takes the emphasis off the particular here and this somehow pulls the characterizations into the foreground more strongly.
Here are the years which form the chapter heads: 1880, 1891, 1907, 1908, 1910, 1911, 1913, 1914, 1917, 1918 and Present Day. As with a bildungsroman, Woolf's interest is in the developmental arc over time.
Woolf's concern is with the interstitial moments, when the effect of time, certainly Proustian time though not flashbacks so much as flash-forwards has its collective impact.
When reading some other books these days that made me feel the loss of I don't know what I wondered if it was that security that I knew they had people who loved them (a soul mate?
When Eleanor wonders what made Rose do such a thing as to cut herself I had the feeling that she didn't know what else to do.
I know she will be happy some day but I want her to look out the window because I don't feel like me when it is assurance and the great hope.
I just want to feel that knowing that Sara had that people could.
The Years by Virginia Woolf is the story of the Pargiter family.
The story starts in 1880 and the family is headed by Colonel Abel Pargiter.
Reaction is more important than action.Woolf's method of putting the reader in the head of the characters to listen to their thinking and to see their observations is perfected.
The story extends to the extended Pargiter family and a few outsiders like Edward's friends at Oxford, one who marries his sister Milly.
Historical events like the death of Charles Parnell, King Edward,  and the end of World War I are used to mark a point in time rather than center around the event.
Other reviews tell me that this isn't as good as Mrs Dalloway or To The Lighthouse - having read all three books now, I will concede the Mrs Dalloway point, but I think I liked The Years better than To the Lighthouse.
The smooth hard surface of the china with its red flowers seemed to her for a second a marvelous mystery."That's why I love Virginia Woolf: she can look at a snowstorm in a city, and a single china cup, and study both of them with the same level of interest and detail, and make both subjects seem new and fascinating.
I mean, is she every really conventional?" and people were like, "Dood, this is nowhere near as good as To the Lighthouse or The Waves, so don't get your hopes up," and I was like, "Well I haven't read The Waves," and people were like, "What Dood?
Well, as far as we can convey it, I think this book just did.
Although I am not a professional Woolf reader, after reading the years I felt I discovered something new in my life: a new author, a new kind of writing above all kinds of hatred, a new kind of womanhood in fact.
What we expect from a Woolf novel should not be a mixture of events which supposedly must constitute a special year (chapter).
Or how Woolf manages that her characters remembers those memories from years ago that we have read about them in previous chapters and it was for me a reminiscence of reading Proust.
Reviewed in conjunction with Margery Sharp's Lise Lillywhite One of the things I do in Geneva is hang out at the local flea market trying to suppress my urge to preserve dead lives.
Every week you'll see people disrespectfully pawing over the beloved libraries of the deceased, libraries which with possibly indecent haste, have been taken away by market vendors who, I can imagine, don't pay a cent for them.
At the 'junk' end, ordinary books not worth anything, was a lovely collection of children's and adult's fiction from the pre and post WWII period.
The story is composed of fragments, moments taken from an entire life. There are things we remember better than other. Some things we forget completely until someone mentions it and than we seem to remember little fragments of the story. It is not always the most important things we remember; it can be just like a shadow that covers a piece of the wall without making difference. What Woolf does is, she constructs a complete novel of assembled fragments of the lives of the family Pargiter. So a complete story reveals itself.
Forgot to write little review when I read this a while back. Out of all the Woolf novels, I think this one might be the worst. It's not a bad novel, but this didn't read like Woolf. In her diary she said she didn't like this book either because she wrote this when she was sick. She says it's never a good thing when writers write when they are sick. It shows too.
This is my fourth reading because it is a novel that speaks to me ; my very essence I grew up in a four storey Victorian terraced house with faded William Morris wallpaper and service bells in the hallway.
The past was always present and maybe we all lived in the past even then How do you describe the passing of the years ?
Your years ?
what is reliable ?
Seasons are reliable as all Nature Is , Virginia Woolf shows us that the everyday is all we had -love her
4,4/5I’m in love 😳
Елеанор Парджитър е най-добрата жена героиня, която съм срещал в литературата.Не мога да кажа нищо повече, освен да посоча най-лесния за мен извод - романът е брилянтен.През цялото време се сещах за един пасаж от Бърнт Нортън на Т.С.
Улф също е била вдъхновена от него:Настоящето й миналото временавярно заедно минават в бъдещето време,а бъдещето се съдържа в миналото.Ако цялото време винаги съществува,цялото време е непоправимо.Което е могло да бъде, е абстракция —постоянна възможностсамо в света на разсъжденията.Което е могло да бъде и което есочат към един и същи край — все в настоящето.Стъпки отекват в паметтапрез прохода, по който не поехме,към врата, която не отворихмекъм градината с розите.
Presumably known to readers, it has no content page so I would create one from this publication in the meantime so that we can realize its scope as an overview:Chapter 1 1880 (p.
First, Mrs Woolf probably wrote as she wished, that is, as long as she had ideas on her characters who obviously came and went, talking in different episodes in which they are more or less related, or none; therefore, the reader would simply find it impossible to recall all characters while reading long chapters unless he/she is doing a formidable project for an advanced degree.
Second, the reader would take heart more when they decide to read its short chapters, especially the three ones as mentioned above.
But I'm at a point where reading Virginia Woolf feels like being in love and you’re like wow you have the most beautiful toe I’ve ever seen on a human being even though everyone else says it’s kinda gross and not as good as your other toes.
I don’t have anything else to add other than that this book is full of beauty, heart and melancholy, and people saying it’s not as good as her other stuff don’t know what they’re talking about and they’re probably just jealous aspiring writers anyway.
Le stelle, ovviamente, rappresentano il mio gradimento...Pur riconoscendo l’indiscusso talento della Woolf non sono riuscita a farmelo piacere...Ho apprezzato moltissimo le descrizioni degli interni ed esterni, ciononostante non mi ha preso per nulla ed inoltre ho dovuto farmi una lista dei personaggi, perché perdevo continuamente il filo del racconto . Terminato a fatica, scusa Virginia: non siamo in sintonia 😔
my favoriteبعد از سه سال دوباره خوندمش. جالب این جاست که تو این سه سال هر وقت به یاد این کتاب می افتادم حس خوبی پیدا می کردم، اما داستانش به یادم نمی یومد! از این کتاب فقط یه حس برام باقی مونده بود. حالا هم که برای دومین بار خوندمش باز هم برام همون حس خوب رو زنده کرد و باز هم نمی تونم تعریفش کنم!دلیلش اینه که:ویرجینیا وولف عزیز ِ من تو این کتاب چیزی رو تصویر کرده که بهش می گیم "زندگی"، حسش می کنیم و نمی تونیم تعریفش کنیم.
"The Pargiters", "Here and Now", finally entitled "The Years" - a grand book of exquisite beauty - maturity, I suppose, tight and dense, a clear vision, a finely cut gem in her crown of achievements.
At some point, she referred to it as "that misery" in her diary, but there is so much love in how it is written, and reading the process of her writing it, it was evident that in that "misery" there was delight in the challenge of writing it, wringing it out of her brain — wanting to make it right — writing it as if it were to be the last book she would ever write.
Eleanor Pargiter, a woman now in her seventies, is a major character; her sister Delia, whose party in a London town house is just ending, is a more minor one; but the point is less to show what has happened to these particular women whom we first met when the book began fifty years earlier, but simply to show that they are still alive, as witnesses to the changing world around them.When I started the opening section, set in 1880, I had trouble keeping track of the seven or eight children of Colonel Abel Pargiter, in whose London house the book opens.
Is this the smell of the past, or is this just what old books and suitcases and train cars smell like after many years?" Reading this book was like getting to be in an 1880s parlor and seeing, smelling, hearing, feeling, what it was like to be in that room, to fray a wick on a teakettle to get it to boil sooner, to experience small details about the way people coughed, or pinched the fabric of a dress.
People always say, "It's the little things that matter." In the end, our memories are filled with those little details, such as what a room smelled like and how that smell always comes back when I hear a certain song - yet how seldom they make it into a plot of a story.
The sunlight-dappled passages of 'The Years', deciduous and delirious with Woolf's painterly vision hold the key to understanding Woolf's view of the world as an atmosphere of beauty enveloped in a haze of  human melancholy, regret and isolation; although 'The Years' ostensibly follows the Pargiter family, the true star is the city of London.
Verdant and vibrant, from the tree-lined streets to  bilious  lamp-light which imbued London with a sickly luminescence, to the maze like streets which have entrapped the characters, few writers had described London with as much verve and originality as Virginia Woolf;"The moon which was now clear of the clouds lay in a bare space as if the light had consumed the heaviness of the clouds and left a perfectly clear pavement, a dancing ground for revelry.
I kept thinking, as I read this, that it was Virginia's material put down in Katherine Mansfield's style.
I particularly enjoy that sort of sweet, gently pattering prose, -- though from Virginia it feels curiously disembodied.
Her sensory perceptions are well articulated, but her focus is ultimately social.
Indeed, the story could be considered purely social as there isn't even a central narrative consciousness.
This was her last novel and, in a way, it does feel like a final gasp in it's wistful simplicity.
Beautiful, as always.Correction: Between the Acts was her last published novel, though still a rough draft at the time of her death.
I really want to like it, but I guess my tastes in literature do not include Virginia Woolf's "stream of conciousness" style of writing.
Also the dialogue is random and unfinished.
You follow the Pargiter family through a set of moments in time.
And every moment seems like a painting.
Thoughts, dialogue and events don't seem to matter.
Virginia Woolf just paints a picture.At first I found the style refreshing from what I'm used to, but it got annoying after 100 pages.
I appreciate the importance of the style for literature, but to me it was not very enjoyable to read.
I was able to get into this book quickly and it went along briskly, until the last chapter ("Present Day" which I'm guessing was 1939 when it was written).
There was a party, and I was getting the people mixed up (who's married to who?
Who were siblings?
Who were the children?) The "younger generation" (in their 30s) were getting bored by the talk of the older generation, as was I reading it!
I'm sure if I looked up critical explanations of the writing and British history during the 1880s I would get much more out of it.
I know repetition was a big part.
But you know what?
Virginia Woolf is one of the greatest writers that I have read, and this book has objectively great moments, and were it not for her anti-semitism, mainly found in her letters and diaries creeping for the first time (as far as I can tell) into her fiction, it would've been easier for me to ignore it and continue to admire the literary products of this obnoxious and comically appalling group of British/Upper-Crust American snobs, with their Oxford educations, and imperial arrogance, and anti-semitism.
“There must be another life, she thought, sinking back into her chair, exasperated. Not in dreams; but here and now, in this room, with living people. She felt as if she were standing on the edge of a precipice with her hair blown back; she was about to grasp something that just evaded her. There must be another life, here and now, she repeated. This is too short, too broken. We know nothing, even about ourselves.”
It was a struggle for me to get through the party at the end--I was as bored and restless as if I was a family member.
I felt as if I were North (a character I had no memory of), returned from farming in South Africa, trying to find a place in his family again.
The image of the siblings who know the family history is very prominent, and the middle generation really want those older aunts and uncles to tell their story.I couldn't help but compare this book with Jane Smiley's Hundred Years Trilogy.
And I wish Woolf had included a family tree to sort out the generations, as Jane Smiley did.
Frankly The Years isn't a very good novel, but it's an interesting one worth reading for several reasons.First and foremost--especially since I'm in the process of reading the entirety of Woolf's narrative output in chronological order--this novel is useful in explaining why the five novels from Jacob's Room to The Waves are so remarkable and just terrifically successful literary experiments.
Without a form framing experience into something meaningful, a novel like The Years can only feel like a very long and rather aimless series of moments lifted from lives without much rhyme or reason.
