One who receives him gains a great spiritual possession.” A better title might have been, “Swedenborg’s Religion and Its Tremendous Influence on Me.”That said, there are some interesting passages, and one comes away incredibly impressed with the intelligent eloquence with which Keller writes.
No matter from what angle He started, He came back to this fact, that He entrusted the reconstruction of the world, not to wealth or caste or power or learning, but to the better instincts of the race—to the nobler ideals and sentiments of the people—to love, which is the mover of the will and the dynamic force of action.”Ultimately, her faith regards loving action as a prime mover of the world.
So, being into disability theory I decided to read it sooner than later.First off this is much more of a philosophy book than an autobiography.
She also defends her various views of Bible interpretation and the nature of God. I don’t agree with her on 95% of her points regarding spirituality, but her arguments are interesting and deserve thought.
So, no, this isn’t an inspirational autobiography, but it does dig very deep into her strong prerogative of her spiritual sense and her unshaken relationship with Christianity and God. Well worth the read though you’ll be brushing up on loads of history to follow through some of the points.
Wonderful little book but not what I was expecting.
