A bad trip on the fun dip.From what I remember from the movie I saw during rainy-day recess in first grade, there's giant fruit, several oversized scary bugs and green glowy wormy things. It was so surreal and scary to me at the time that I've avoided the movie ever since.As I (finally) read the book, my scattered childhood memories fell into place. And my initial impression remains essentially the same: A really bad trip on the fun dip.  “I'd rather be fried alive and eaten by Mexicans.”  Hone

and grow.James soon learns that within that gigantic peach are some extremely large and peculiar new friends.
I read this so many times as a child and I was always so fiercely jealous of James. James is a dreamer. He has a boring life and one day he gets the opportunity to experience something weird and surreal. Everyday breaks away from mundanity and becomes something exciting and unusual. James makes friends with interesting insects and explores places he has never seen. A giant peach takes him there. His dreams become reality.This is certainly a story that could make any child (or adult too) fall in love with fantasy.

Book Review  James and the Giant Peach by Roald Dahl is a very creative story built for everyone of all ages to enjoy. I think of it as a cross between 3 things: (1) Dr. Seuss, (2) Jack and the Beanstalk and (3) Harry Potter. 4 of 5 stars to this lovely keepsake!I had to read this book, when it's my namesake, James. But the similarities end there. James' parents have passed away and he lives with his awful aunt and uncle. A mysterious man gives him a package which helps him grow this giant pea

4 of 5 stars to this lovely keepsake!I had to read this book, when it's my namesake, James.
And then the peach turns into a house, rolls away into fantasy-land and brings tons of new cartoon characters for James to have his own family.
So many fun things come from here, it's a must read for all kids.
such a treasure in words and pictures.
here's the scoop: I read A LOT.
Many thanks to their original creators.[polldaddy poll=9729544][polldaddy poll=9719251]


As always, Roald Dahl spins the most fantastic wonderful tales for children and James and the Giant Peach is up there with his greatest ones. It is also a wonderful animated film. Don't deprive your children of fantastic stories such as this one - there are one in a million!
That the power of relationships and creativity and imagination are all a person needs to take them anywhere they want to go i.e. it shows kids that no matter how bad things may seem, or how bad they get, there is always hope.So why was James and the Giant Peach banned?It was banned as being too scary for the targeted age group, mysticism, sexual inferences, profanity, racism, references to tobacco and alcohol, and claims that it promotes disobedience, drugs, and communism.A challenge was brought before the school council in Indian River County, Florida, because of the story’s mystical elements involving magic crocodile tongues which enchanted the peach tree.The Times of London reported that it was once banned in a Wisconsin town because a reference to a spider licking her lips could be “taken in two ways, including sexual.”That Times statement conjured up this image!!
This story both fascinated and scared me when I was a child. 👍🐯
ENGLISH (James and the Giant Peach) / ITALIANO«Until he was four years old, James Henry Trotter had a happy life.
However, this regrettable and sad incident marks the beginning of a suggestive and extremely hair-brained adventure on an oversized peach.My daughter and I continue our journey in Roald Dahl's world.
You can't really go wrong with him.Vote: 7«Fino all'età di quattro anni, James Henry Trotter ebbe una vita felice.
Viveva tranquillo con sua madre e suo padre in una bella casa sul mare.
James Henry Trotter is forced to live with his dreadful Aunt Sponge and Aunt Spiker after his beloved parents are killed in a tragic incident with a rhinoceros.
Given the title of the book, it's no secret that James encounters a giant peach, but this is no ordinary piece of fruit.
"And there's a - there's a - there's a - a - a - a sort of giant ladybug!" "Now just a minute, Captain!" the First Officer said.
Sail away on a giant peach in this delightful story of a boy finding friends in unusual ways and in astonishing places.
2017 is the year of reading Roald Dahl for me!
I'm trying to read all his books that I can get my hands on plus reread all the books I've previously read of his :)When I read this book a very long time ago I rated in 3 stars.
I think as an adult I enjoyed reading this book more than I did as a child.
James accidentally drops some magic crystals by an old peach tree.
This causes the peach at the top of the tree to grow huge!!
James enters the fruit and meets some new friends: a grasshopper, Ladybug, and a Centipede.
The peach rolls away from its tree and the adventure began!
James brings them home and while outside, the beans escape at the base of an old peach tree that has not shown any signs of life for many years.
Dahl at his best, proves how he became a household name amongst children's authors.As part of my 2017 reading goals, I thought I would pave the way and return to reading some of the classic books from my youth, in hopes of introducing them to my son in the coming years.
Dahl has a way of telling a great story that will appease the young reader while also instilling great values and ideals into their little minds, sure to please parents and other adults.
But, given that Dahl has passed on, and a fair number of people ask me for book recommendations for their kids.
Here's the thing, before this book, I read Charlie and the Chocolate Factory to my boy.
IN this book, about 60% most of the dialogue was just four different people exclaiming about the same thing.
And my son, who has read the book before with his mother, didn't notice.
(Because he *will* call me out on stuff like that.) Now could a child enjoy reading this book on their own?
But as a book you're thinking of reading to a kid?
♡
We had just finished Charlotte's Web and I was looking for chapter books I could enjoy as well.
Dahl's writing is fantastic, and I had great fun making up tunes to his songs throughout the book.
I remember many teachers I had that pushed their opinions, good and bad on students when reading literature.
And I highly recommend it for your first chapter books for your child.
I was excited because this was the first time my son had read a book and seen the movie afterward.
I told him it often happens that the movie is nothing like the book and then asked which he liked better.
Dahl’s first children’s book perfectly captures why he’s such a beloved author.From the spirt of adventure to the weird quirky comedy of James’s parents being killed by escaped rhinoceros, the book juggles everything that a child would wish to read.Mostly importantly are the insect characters that inhabit the peach, all play their part in the journey and help educate the reader on natural history.From the glow worms light to the spiders web used for hammocks.This book definitely peaked my interest in bugs!
A funny, dark and poetic book. I read this after seeing a documentary about Roald Dahls' life and hearing some of the book's passages narrated within the perspective of his time cramped up in a WWII bomber plane as a bombardier (he was very tall). The peach represents the polar opposite of being in a noisy and clattering war plane, manning a gun and always under the threat of death. The peach is a peaceful, sweet and quiet flying machine.
ابتدای داستان خیلی خیلی شبیه داستان سیندرلا هست منتها شخصیت اصلی داستان اینجا پسر و زیر دست عمه های بدجنسش زندگی میکند و ... پایان شیرینش و شخصیت هایی از حشرات غول آسای مهربان که در کنار جیمز یاریش میکردند و یک عدد هلوی خوشمزه ی واقعا بزرگ ، دلگرمی خوبی برای فرزندی که کتاب رو برایش میخوانیم هست و حتما داستان را دوست خواهد داشت ، البته کودک درون من هم این داستان رو خیلی دوست داشت به طوری که فیلمش رو هم دانلود کرده و دیدم و اون هم جالب و دوستداشتنی بود ...
James Henry Trotter is a sweetie, and I absolutely adore this kid and his garden-friendly insect friends.
The illustrations are so cute.After enduring abusive aunts for three years who despise James after they agreed to raise him from the age of four when his parents died, James meets a mysterious man in the garden who gives him a bag of magical rice-sized crystals.
James has hit bottom.The next day, there is a giant peach growing on the tree!
Crawling down the tunnel he discovers the huge peach pit - and the most adorable group of magically transformed bugs that anyone would be pleased to meet.
used to dream of being James. had my special favorites amongst all the talking insects, but really they were all my favorites. also used to look at animal encyclopedias and write lists of my favorite animals. then I'd imagine going on an Incredible Journey with them. animals are so much better than people!
I love how Roald Dahl can transport you; can make your imagination come alive.He makes you feel like a kid again!I've read a lot of his work as a child, but never this one. SO it was my first time. And I loved it.
“'My dear young fellow,' the Old-Green-Grasshopper said gently, 'there are a whole lot of things in this world of ours you haven't started wondering about yet.'”*4.5 starsQuite creepy, quite funny, quite whimsical and cute, James and The Giant Peach might not be as good as  Matilda or as magical as Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, but Roald Dahl, master storyteller, never disappoints.
James Henry Trotter is about to embark on the adventure of his lifetime, when a giant peach starts growing in his horrible aunts’ garden.
For some ridiculous reason, I never read any Roald Dahl when I was a kid. So now that my kids are at ages where they can enjoy his books, I’m super excited to be reading these with them. My oldest (6), loved this book. She’s declared it to be the best book ever. I also really enjoyed it, and would have read it myself even if I didn’t have kids. My four year old however was indifferent, she’s mostly excited to watch the movie. 😅
Just one small note here: Why are the bad people in Roald Dahl's stories always either enormously fat or very long and thin?!
Yes, this book basically is a giant road trip story.Again, the author demonstrates his huge ability to come up with the most fantastic events, funny rhymes and songs and he invented quite some marvellous creatures in this book.
The one star I deducted, by the way, was because I didn't like (view spoiler)[that the sharks were made out to be the bad guys (hide spoiler)] since this teaches children reading the book a lie that has been spread for a long time, causing a lot of damage!
خوب بود دنیای جالبی داشت اما از اونجایی که شباهتاش به چارلی و آسانسور شیشهای خیلی زیاد بود یه جاهایی تکراری بود روندش. به هر در مل لذتبخش بود.-----------------------------------بخشهای ماندگار کتاب:شاید ما غرق نمیشدیم! شاید هم آنقدر ترسیده بودیم که فکر میکردیم داریم غرق میشویم....در تمام این دنیای ما چیزهای زیادی هست که تو هنوز به آنها فکر نکردهای.

Muy tierno y entretenido.No es lo mejor de Roald, pero sí una excelente aventura.
There was no fear of Old-Green-Grasshopper or Centipede or Earthworm or any of the others, just the feeling that if I were James I'd want OUT of that peach pit and into the fresh air.
I'd be laughing one minute at Centipede's songs about Aunts Sponge and Spiker, and grossing out a few minutes later when Centipede tells Earthworm that the Cloud-Men will eat him: "They would cut you up like a salami and eat you in thin slices." There's just so much to delight the reader in this first of Roald Dahl's books for children.
Read as part of The Infinite Variety Reading Challenge, based on the BBC's Big Read Poll of 2003.The only way to describe this book is "fun".
Yeah, it's got whimsy and adventure and imagination and some very Dahlian deaths and the Horrible People with their Horrible Traits, but it's not got that kind of wonderful spirit that some his other books have.Whilst I'd never say that adults should not read children's books, I personally haven't been getting the same amount of enjoyment from these books as I usually do from books that are written for kids.
I think with a lot of these books it's the reputation of the author and his more successful books that holds them up.Blog | Instagram | Twitter | Pinterest | Shop | Etsy
I remember when this book was read to me by my fifth grade teacher during our daily story time hour.
However, despite my obvious distaste for the class and its inhabitants, I largely attribute that particular teacher for reading out to me some of my most favourite children's books; this particular Roald Dahl was one of them.
In all honesty before re-reading this after some 14 years, the only part of the entire book that I remembered distinctly was the bit with the old man and the word "peculiar" repeated several times (it was the word we had to remember for a test in the class, I believe).
