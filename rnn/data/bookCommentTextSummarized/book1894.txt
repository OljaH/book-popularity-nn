The question is: can I "know" the thing that I use to know with?
Can I "think" of the thing I use to think with?
I don't know of a non-human species of animal that suffer except those which live in close proximity to humans.Humans have travelled long distances in so called 'natural sciences' such as physics, biology, chemistry.
The book was written in the aftermath of the first world war which testified to the imbalance between natural sciences and human sciences where achievements in natural sciences were used to the detriment of masses of people.
What a great book. One has to read it to appreciate it. Advancement of a human from an ape to Egyptian gods to Greek philosophers and then Dark Ages and then back to scientific reason. Technologically advanced but socially still stuck a thousand years back. James is calling for humans to utilize scientific method in their socio/political living.
Dated philosophy, but well presented. He argues that we will never progress in our study of humanity until we discard our inherited assumptions. These include religion, private ownership, government, and nationalism. Idealistic.
Both Mind in the Making books are worth reading (this one included, of course)
