"The 5th Horseman" written by James Patterson with Maxine Paetro is the 5th in the Women's Murder Club series and is a hospital and courtroom thriller.I'm still enjoying the series, this book contains all the usual James Patterson twists and turns, with fast page turning chapters and well developed characters. His writing style is uncomplicated and very easy to read and follow. I would recommend this book to avid Patterson fans and readers of quick and easy thrillers.
And that is literally all the brain power you require to follow along with these fluffy and melodramatic stories.
If I was more easily offended I'd be inclined to believe James Patterson thinks his readers are a bunch of fucking idiots; that he could literally take a shit on a page and people would buy and it give it 5 stars.
It had a plot, most likely.....but, seriously, there's a lot going on in this book.
We start with an "angel of death" killer taking out otherwise healthy patients at a hospital, followed closely by a second story line where escorts are being murdered.
As Lieutenant Lindsey Boxer leads one investigation into a string of mysterious patient deaths, her friends, head ME Clair Washburn, Attorney Yuki Castellano, and top journalist for the San Francisco Chronicle, Cindy Tomas, do their best to hunt down a faceless, merciless killer.
The basis of this book regarding poor patient care, medical errors, and especially the medication errors, even with the so-called 'foolproof' medication dispensing machines that need a pass code to gain access, is in fact, VERY, VERY REAL!
If you are familiar, as I am, with the inner workings of the medical profession there are some small improbabilities between this book, which is fiction, and the real world of hospital patient care.
Not the best, but clearly toward the top of the list with the Women's Murder Club Series.This one kept me guessing till the very end.
The trial was the larger chunk of the novel than the actual murder mystery, even though they were intertwined.
I enjoyed the change of pace with the trial and hearing the opening and closing argument and cross-examinations.Unfortunately, I was a bit disappointed by the ending.
The credit is given to Boxer in the end, but they never indicate how she figured it out, or followed the killer to her new position at her new hospital.
Then the argument that it takes awhile after discharge for a nurse to know a patient has gone home is preposterous.
It is the nurse that discharges a patient, and as soon as that patient is gone the chart is removed, everything is removed.
You don't give report on a patient that is gone, and nurses will not give meds to a patient they have not had report on.Honestly, I like authors that do research, and good research, and this book has none of that.Watch out for the sex and language.
I'm not sure I will read any more Patterson books.
This is the first James Patterson novel for me. This was a gripping, hard to put down book. Interesting plot, great characters and crisp dialogue. I like the use of short and punchy chapters. There were 139 chapters of about 1 /2 to 2 pages each. Very effective way to keep the story moving. I had always heard good things about Patterson and after having read this story I can now see what all those accolades are all about. He now has a spot on my favorite authors list.
Once I start, I usually don't want to put one of his books down and The 5th Horseman is no exception.I read a lot over lunch at work and another caveat of reading his novels is that the chapters are usually short and it's always easy to find a place to stop (even if you REALLY don't want to!)Anyway, I guess this isn't a review for The 5th Horseman exactly, but more of a review of James Patterson novels in general.
Since so many others have outlined the general plot of this story (huge lawsuit against a hospital; suspicious deaths that may or may not have been committed by a doctor) I'll simply leave a brief comment.
Although the story isn't all that complicated, it was still a quick, enjoyable read--and the ending was one I didn't see coming.
This is the story of Lindsay Boxer, SFPD Lieutenant and her fellow Women's Murder Club friends.
I found the story to be heartfelt and emotional, full of action-adventure, and, as I said, a very quick, satisfying read.
James Patterson is one of my favorite authors, and I wait for his next book to come out in paperback.
This is the fifth book in the Woman's Murder Club series.
It is just as page turning as the other four and I am waiting to go shopping to pick up the 6th one.
Great murder mystery.
Most of the characters are professional women; One is a cop, one a lawyer, a newpaper writer and a medical examiner.
The same characters are throughout the series.
It feels like you are catching up with friends when you read the next one.
If you haven't read Patterson, you are definitely missing out!
I'm addicted to these for my in between, waiting for my books on hold, reading. I enjoyed this one!
He wasn't a nice guy by any means, but it felt like his crime was in there just so Lindsay could feel justified about her mistrust of him, rather than he just rubbed her the wrong way.
The conclusion of the hospital killer just felt rushed, and it really didn't do anything other than show how super awesome Lindsay is without telling us how she figured it out at all.
The guy fessed up and then we left that entirely and never thought of it again.I'm also not sure I buy the way Yuki fits into the group.
There were two different cases – one involving mysterious deaths in a hospital and another involving the gruesome death of beautiful call girls.
The book would have done better if the focus was on either one of the cases as it would have assured us a better quality mystery.
Also apparent was the missing motive behind the case which left me searching for answers even after I completed the book.The Women’s murder club is definitely an exciting series.
If you have read the books in the order they were published you would connect to the women and feel for them like I do.
Pretty terrible so far.
A friend told me these books get worse and worse as the series goes on.
I am probably not even 50 pages in, and have already though at least 10 times, this book is SO obviously written by a man (cause women don't act like that).
Like two friends, a detective and a coroner who are women, and they see each other at work - and hug.
I have worked with people I consider great friends, but I still don't HUG them when I get to work in the morning...But need something easy for the memorial day weekend - especially since I will be flying etc.
But so far...1 star...
ok so this book I did not like as much as the last few. I felt like since there were 2 cases going on neither were there detailed or hard to figure out. I also didn't like that Joe was not in it much. we need more Joe. and I didn't really like how much the point of view changed to different people....but I still did like the book just not as much compared to the others.

Nueva entrega del Club de las mujeres contra el crimen, con la teniente Boxer a la cabeza. Muy entretenida, como las anteriores entregas; con capítulos muy cortos y una narrativa muy sencilla, que hacen que se lea muy rápido. Como siempre, llena de sorpresas.
To me it seems like Maxine gets a call from James who tells her it's time for a Women's Murder Club book.
"Let's have them looking into murders happening in a hospital by a doctor," James says wistfully, like he's reinventing the wheel.
The women are so dead set on making it seem like the doctor on trial is the worst human being to ever live because Yuki's mom died under his care, that they ignore the biggest slap in the face in the book: they find a box of the buttons above a nurses locker.
Anyway, back to the story...Examination of the corpse by the appropriate expert - and, naturally enough, one of the members of THE CLUB - soon reveals the reason for the death and the interest of readers right around the world will be piqued as their interest in the book, and the case, launches itself into hyperspace.Fellow Club Member, and top shelf lawyer Yuki’s mom collapses on the streets of San Fran early on the book, and with a simple case of angina mixed up with a very minor stroke, she is kept in the supermassive San Francisco Municipal Hospital for a short stay for treatment, observation and full recovery.
Embarrassing that I don't remember reading it, but I enjoyed it very much the second time.I'm slowly making my way through this series.
As Lieutenant Lindsey Boxer leads one investigation into a string of mysterious patient deaths, her friends, head ME Clair Washburn, Attorney Yuki Castellano, and top journalist for the San Francisco Chronicle, Cindy Tomas, do their best to hunt down a faceless, merciless killer.
The basis of this book regarding poor patient care, medical errors, and especially the medication errors, even with the so-called 'foolproof' medication dispensing machines that need a pass code to gain access, is in fact, VERY, VERY REAL!
It finds our four female protagonists dealing with three concurrent cases; a hospital malpractice suit, a murder spree in the same hospital and a series of deaths of young escorts.And that is the problem with this book.
By packing more action than a Bruckheimer movie into 410 pages, Patterson (and co-author Maxine Paetro) sacrifice things like character development.
It would have been a far better book if we had only had the hospital malpractice/hospital murder plot and they left the escort murders for another book.The book is also a very quick read.
I liked this one along with all the others in this series, but I was a little disappointed in the very ending about finding out who the Night Walker really was. Seemed anti-climatic. I wanted to know how they found out and that part wasn't touched on, although I thought it was from the pharmacist's research.
A great bookI loved reading this book. It was such interesting and intense book. It's worth reading from start to finish. Patterson did a great job.
Στο νέο βιβλίο της Γυναικείας Λέσχης Φόνων, έχουμε να κάνουμε με δύο παράλληλες αστυνομικές ιστορίες: ένα ντουέτο δολοφόνων ναρκώνει και βιάζει νέες κοπέλες, τις οποίες στη συνέχεια ντύνουν με την τελευταία λέξη της μόδας και τις τοποθετούν σε ακριβά αυτοκίνητα ενώ στο Δημοτικό Νοσοκομείο του Σαν Φρανσίσκο αυξάνονται κατακόρυφα οι θάνατοι ασθενών με τρόπο που δείχνει ανθρώπινο λάθος, μόνο που κάποιος τους βάζει στα μάτια κουμπιά με το κηρυκείο του Ερμή «για καλό κατευόδιο».
Lindsay Boxer is on the case again. This time someone is killing ER patients at a big name hospital and leaving a calling card of two gold coins on the victims' eyes. There doesn't seem to be any pattern to the victims. There is a big malpractice trial in which the hospital gets sued. A doctor is under suspicion because many of the victims were his patients. The plaintiffs win their case but it doesn't stop the killings. Lindsay is running out of leads. You will be surprised who the real killer ends up being.
Probably the best one in the series so far. I feel like now that we "know" the characters I don't feel so awkward and stereotyped and I can just enjoy the mystery and the thrill of it. I am liking this series more and more and I want to continue reading it. I particularly enjoyed this case more than most of James Patterson's novels that I have read thus far. Good Read!
I loved this even more re-reading again than the 1st time I read it! Lindsay Boxer is awesome! 😎
Lt. Lindsay Boxer and the newest member of the Women's murder club, Yuki Castellano, bond in this gripping story.
Yuki, being the brilliant lawyer she is, loses her mother in a string of mysterious deaths occurring at a local hospital and the only clue is medallion like coins placed on their eyes.
A cocky young doctor is the likely serial killer and the DA is hell bent on convicting him but the case takes a huge twist that you won't see coming.
I like that James Patterson gives us a variety of murder mysteries.
I can't wait to see more of Yuki in these books.
As always a page-turner. Easy to read and likeable characters. On to the next one...

It upset me that it never really was brought up and none of the main characters knew what it meant.
This books ending killed me too, most of these wrap up nicely, this one, heck no.
That being said, this novel could have been so much better, maybe 3 or 4 stars, if they would have cut out the Car Girl story line.
Not only that, but it wasn't an overly compelling mystery that it was a good sidebar to the investigation into the deaths at the hospital.
We got nothing really out of the Car Girl story line.
If during this novel she would have literally been stuck behind a desk when good leads came in, it might have been understandable, but it made no sense with anything we have seen so far.
