Just a few days ago I happened to have a conversation with someone (quite a 'well-read' person too) who said quite casually, almost in an offhand manner, how he found books written by women 'uninteresting'.
I didn't have the heart to ask him why a second time.And there it sat between us, this knowledge of his disdain for women writers (for some hitherto unknown reason), like a breathing, venom-spitting, invisible monster quietly killing our conversation (thankfully!).No evasion.
So what if she has made her ugly and unfortunate Pecola yearn for a shred of love and dignity in vain till her last days?
- Before I get jumped on by total strangers for making assumptions about Morrison's detractors, these are actual comments about her books, from Amazon.com:"Toni Morrison is the most overrated author in America, it's only because of Oprah (the most overrated "personality" in America") that she is popular.""You know, I know blacks have had a hard time in this world...I'm not naive...but there's a right and wrong way to tell us about your problems.
well, i'm experiencing severe bookface fatigue and wasn't gonna report on this until i read this cool-as-shit bookster's review:http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36813she checked out the reviews on amazon for the bluest eye and listed some excerpts:"Toni Morrison is the most overrated author in America, it's only because of Oprah (the most overrated "personality" in America") that she is popular." "You know, I know blacks have had a hard time in this world...I'm not naive...but there's a right and wrong way to tell us about your problems.
I discovered her writing with Beloved for which have a copy signed by her at a reading in Brooklyn of Jazz decades ago.
When white men beat their men, they cleaned up the blood and went home to receive abuse from the victim."The cycle of violence feeds on itself leading to tragic consequences for each of the characters.In today's amerikkka of immigration quotas, race-baiting, and continued white police-on-black violence, The Bluest Eye still remains as relevant today as when Toni Morrison published it in 1993, the year she was justly awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature.
Discussing this book with others has been very interesting because we all have different perspectives and can share them, expanding our own understanding of the book, it's been a great experience.It's been four years since I first read The Bluest Eye and I was extremely touched and saddened by it the first time around.
And I think of all the little black girls I've known who hated being black, who hated their hair, their noses, their eye colour, who prayed for "good hair", lighter skin complexion etc.Morrison shows the vulnerability of children so well, and the consequences of parents not telling them what they need to know in enough detail, which results in them being forced to draw conclusions on their own.
When we finished this book, about half the class--- including me--- were infuriated at Morrison for humanizing certain characters that caused Pecola to suffer the most.
What Morrison wanted us to do was not pardon the terrible acts of her characters, or brush them off as "simply tragedy" but to understand where these characters came from psychologically, and what made them the the way they are.
I don't think any work of fiction has ever taught me this huge a lesson about human nature than this one.
Morrison is a brilliant writer and this will probably always be one of my favorite novels.
Her use of the Dick & Jane children's books, used for decades to teach children to read (SEEMOTHERMOTHERISVERYNICEMOTHERWILLYOUPLAYWITHJANEMOTHERLAUGHSLAUGHMOTHERLAUGHLA) created a chilling, ironic and staggering contrast between the lives of the whites and those of the blacks in this novel.
I could quote from it all day, but I won't do that, because the entire read was poignant and so crisply aware of the color line - the how and the why - that there is no one point that can overshadow another in the message that these words aimed to send.
For that, she deserves nothing but reverence and applause, so she will always have that from me.Anyone who's ever been in doubt of a color line in Black America should read this book.
I’ve read a lot of fucked things in literature, though it is extremely rare that I read something so messed up that it makes me hate the book.It takes a lot to put me off.
I’ve read stage pieces by Sarah Kane which involve genital mutilation and all sorts of brutal sex acts, but, again, it was necessary for the piece.
This book contains an explicit child rape scene and vivid animal cruelty.
Granted, you could make the same argument to defend The Bluest Eye as I did for the texts I mentioned above though, for me, it was just too awful to read.
The Bluest Eye provides a window into this world - a viewpoint so that a Reader can see it for all of its ugliness and marvel at those, like Morrison, that overcome this environment and become a thing of beauty.If you are white male upper-middle class American - a state senator from Alabama with power and a national audience, why would you want to call for the banning of this book, one you have certainly never read?
This work that Morrison has created: a story of darkness, of hopelessness and of a reality that a white male middle-class American could never come close to understanding is a thing of beauty; the lily that grows in the mound of shit.
365. The Bluest Eye, Toni MorrisonThe Bluest Eye is a novel written by Toni Morrison in 1970. Morrison, a single mother of two sons, wrote the novel while she taught at Howard University. The novel is set in 1941 and centers around the life of a young African-American girl named Pecola who grows up during the years following the Great Depression in Lorain, Ohio. Due to Pecola's harsh characteristics and dark skin, she is consistently regarded as "ugly". As a result, she develops an inferiority c
The novel is set in 1941 and centers around the life of a young African-American girl named Pecola who grows up during the years following the Great Depression in Lorain, Ohio.
اعضای خانواده، ستمی دوگانه ـ از سوی نژاد برتر و پدر خانواده ـ را بردوش خود همواره احساس می‌کنند؛ و این ستم را بیش از همه پیکر نحیف و بی‌گناه «پکولا»، دختر نوجوان بی‌دفاع، تحمل میکند.
پدر، یک‌بار خانه را آتش میزند و افراد خانواده را آواره و بیخانمان میکند؛ یک‌بار نیز، دنیایی از درد و رنج را بر سر دختر بیچاره خویش آوار میکند.

Or at least a point among many wicked-but-important points in The Bluest Eye by Toni Morrison.
Pecola herself would never be pretty, would never be understood.
That's it.Pecola herself, never experiences self-superiority, which I believe is the first time I have ever noticed such a phenomena.
Instead, she is motivated by achieving superiority by getting blue eyes.
All of The Bluest Eye is interesting to me.
Pecola's desire for having the bluest eyes in the world reminded me of some of my absurd goals and I am once again reminded to reassess my values.
I just read this today, and the rating system really doesn't apply to my feelings, which are still fresh, on this book : "I like it" "I really liked it", etc.
As the author herself states in the afterward, "...this is a terrible story about things one would rather not know anything about." But at the same time, the story is engrossing, I found the back stories interesting, and really fell in love with the three little girls.
This book evoked strong emotions in me, which, according to the author, was the point.
4.5/5I had my share of body hatred while growing up, but it would be foolish to believe that a blonde-haired, blue-eyed, skinny white girl has the same problems as those who diverge in any of the four descriptives.
It would have aged badly if cultural appropriation wasn't an imperialistic practice that takes the existence of others as the latest "fad" for a blonde-haired and blue-eyed persona, but it is.
Shit on something long enough and it's yours for the commercial taking, so long, of course, you look a certain way.If you dehumanize someone because they don't look like blonde-haired blue-eyed white-skinned skinny-assed me, you are utter, fucking, goddamn trash.
My friend and I just talked about this Twitter thread ("is he hot or is he just white with a visible jawline and/or blue eyes?") right before I read The Bluest Eye. Toni Morrison captures this dynamic of internalized racial self-loathing so well.
Through developing the main characters of this book, the Breedlove family, in a rich and detailed way, Morrison also investigates the repercussions of intergenerational trauma, rape and incest, and more.
Highly recommended to Morrison fans and to those who care about societal beauty ideals, race and the family, and the social transmission of trauma and abuse.
This story, laden with historical and literary context, is narrated by young Claudia and follows three black girls: Claudia, Frieda, and Pecola.
When Pecola sees the same mother who beats and yells at her oohing and aahing at the little girl, the blue eyes become her way of wanting to be acknowledged.
Maybe if she had blue eyes… Later, the bluest eye will play a role after Pecola goes through a horrific ordeal and we get to hear from her directly.Pauline Breedlove (Pecola’s mother) on the other hand, loves her job as a housekeeper because she gets to escape her life with the abusive husband, poverty, and invisibility.
I feel so bad for not liking this book, because I know I'm in the minority, and because I know it deals with some very very important topics!
Nothing in this book inspires hope; it's 100% full of brutality, loss, heartbreak and lots of other heavy and heart-breaking topics, and to be honest, I felt like it was way too overdone.
I love beautiful prose and stories with serious topics, but I didn't like this one one bit.
The two stars are given because of the glimpses of beautiful prose and the ever-important topics that this book deals with, but all in all I can't say that this was a great reading experience.
But I hope some kernel of truth will remain, and who knows, maybe some marigolds will bloom in my own garden.My final quote is I believe an illustration of the fact that we do not need to be perfect, we need only to make an effort and to keep learning about the world and the people around us, no matter how old we are in years: Love is never better than the lover.
I call her a writer and not a novelist or an author because that would be disrespectful to her talent.Unfortunately, there are those who have read this book and act as if Toni Morrison is blaming the entire Caucasian community for the plight of one young African-American girl, and nothing could be further from the truth.This is such a silly idea that it doesn’t even deserve to take up space in this review, but I’m mentioning it because there are people who say they hate this book simply because it is about a little girl who suffers deeply, and all because she happens to be African-American.
As the story progresses, we get backstories on major characters: Pecola's mother, father, and various people in their hometown of Lorain, Ohio.While I loved the prose--there's no denying Morrison's skill with words, especially as this is her first novel--I found myself having trouble fully engaging in the story.
During the afterword of the novel, written by Morrison herself, she says regarding the structure, "My solution--break the narrative into parts that had to be reassembled by the reader--semed to me a good idea, the execution of which does not satisfy me now.
And I would argue, as many people recommended to me, it's a good place to start with Morrison.
Each night, without fail, she prayed for blue eyes. Fervently, for a year she had prayed. Although somewhat discouraged, she was not without hope. To have something as wonderful as that happen would take a long, long time. I had an English teacher who used to tell us to read Russian authors if we wanted to actually appreciate literature, but from my experience, it is Women of Colour whose books have made me appreciate literature more. Perhaps it is because they write with so much heart. Perhaps
Or perhaps when someone else told me my hair was thick and long and black and looked beautiful.
I was perplexed, but like my mother, these girls found beauty in my hair as well.
Of course, now, almost twelve years after I started hating how I looked, I've realised that beauty isn't about how you look.
When Pecola thinks she's ugly because she doesn't have blue eyes, I can understand.
Morrison uses the excerpts of the tale, that talks about the happy, White family of Dick, Jane, and their parents, while contrasting it with the bleak story of Sammy, Pecola, Pauline and Cholly.
Pecola does not have a good childhood (her father is a drunk and her mother barely cares for her children) and sadly we witness Pecola's life devolve from bad to much worse.It pretty much goes without saying that Morrison's writing was beautiful, but it was also more accessible than I thought it would be.
I understand this was a conscious choice on Morrison's part, but it still left me wishing to hear Pecola's perspective at least once.Morrison explores society's obsession with beauty, but particularly a certain kind of beauty- standards and ideals that have been perpetuated throughout time.
The most insidious form of prejudice is the one that's internalised and self-directed. The Bluest Eye examines the ways in which latent cultural measures of beauty and self-worth can become reinforced and self-perpetuating. White people figure rarely in the narrative, and yet whiteness is pervasive as the very currency of self-worth: a means of defining value, and of establishing one's own superiority over others. The novel digs out the dirt to examine the roots of this behaviour, but provides no comfortable resolution for the reader.This was my first Toni Morrison novel (and hers too). A beautiful and devastating book.
Additionally, the overemphasis the author places on race and its inextricability from the conventional concept of beauty makes it sound like she's ranting.
Again, although I'm only on page 50 I feel like I'm being perpetually beaten in the head with a frying pan.
I did read the whole thing (much to my own dispair.
And I certainly understand more knowing it was her first novel, which kind of explains a lot.
I would definitely be willing to read her more recent books - I'm sure she will have improved a lot since then.
The Bluest Eye is a short melancholy piece around a black family living in Ohio after the Great Depression. It's tragic not only because the conditions there were so bad and the emotional wounds of the family are so deep, but also because everyone seems to think this miserable state of affairs is normal, and the wounded souls produced by prejudices carry on.The dialogue is sparse and maybe a little wooden, but the descriptions of this book are stark and magnificent. And this was Morrison's first novel?
This book is a welcoming into the dark complex of humanity, standing like a building of horrors, a Pentagon, made out to be nothing less than a museum of our own terrific and sublime nature.I’m reluctant to say that the pieces here don’t quite add up with quite the power that they feel they are building towards.
In the end Morrison didn’t want to leave my body on the floor of the ring, she wanted me to go out and look at my fellow humans with an ever more aware sense of the our universal victimhood, our universal resilience, our hidden rays of beauty and the overpowering, burdensome, destructive sadness of our existences.It is a joy to read books which become something more than mere words on paper and enter us in that funny way that the greatest literature does.
Please note: I listened to the audiobook narrated by the author, not Ruby Dee. This is a book about a child who wants to be beautiful, and that means to have blue eyes.
If you choose to read this book you should be aware that although the writing is exceptional, it is rarely cheerful:The first twigs are thin, green and supple.
Here the lovely flowering branches of forsythia in spring are used as a means of inflicting physical child abuse.
After listening to page after page depicting human depravity I sought to find one passage that imparted hope, compassion, the nice things that life affords human beings.
Morrison, in describing her behaviour to her family, ends by saying ‘and the world itself agreed with her’.I think this blackness-as-designated-by-white-supremacy is the same thing as the ‘funk’ that the ‘women from Mobile’ try to expunge from themselves.
White-supremacy (and the black self-hatred that is its offspring) is a hatred and fear of the black body and its sexuality.Just before the rape scene, Cholly’s ‘freedom’ is described.
This book makes people feel uncomfortable.
The Bluest Eye , bears hard facts about the condition of blacks in America that are difficult for anybody to acknowledge.
Morrison challenges the idea that "a white baby doll" is something everyone wants, whereas the idea of a "black baby doll" is unfathomable.
Morrison showcases the racism that comes with different levels of pigment, not just from whites, but from other blacks too.
The Bluest Eye  asks, "Who is to blame?" and answers, "Everyone."It's hard for people to read this type of book because it makes them feel uncomfortable.
Because I don't have the bluest eyes?"
So my literature professor completely shocked me by buying this book for me as a gift on the last day of finals and she told me to continue staying true to myself. I don't know, but does anyone else agree that she has a beautiful soul for this ? ❤❤❤P.S. it's by one of my most favorite authors and I just can't even ! 😭😭😭
