The best introduction to Ezra Pound's work.
As Eliot pithily states, Pound first mastered all the major poetic forms and meters, absorbed them till they became part of him, and then tried to write freely and create his own forms which were, a force de lire les anciens, modelled on the old masters but also new.
It seems like Pound did the same thing with poetry.
I also liked how Eliot included quotations from newspaper reviews at the time assessing Pound's work as it appeared in print.
For budding Pound scholars, like myself, this is one of the best places to start.
Eliot's essay on Pound is also an essay on the art of crafting poetry.
Insightful look at the poetry style of Ezra Pound written by another poet. I understood more of this than the actual poetry. Interesting read.
