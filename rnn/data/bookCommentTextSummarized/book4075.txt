how to read this book ?
Carlos P. Romulo, one of the most decorated Filipinos of all time, told the story of the Filipino-American defense against Japanese invasion and aggression. Because he worked as both MacArthur's aide-de-camp and chief public relations officer, he was privy to what was occurring around the Philippines. He simply yet illustratively told the struggles of the soldier as they tried to hold Bataan and Corregidor, and also related his narrow escape on an slipshod amphibious plane toward safety. It was an entertaining read, and insight to the character and fortitude of the Filipino was positively presented by the patriot.
I love this one.
