Minunată!!!"-Cred că o conversație călduroasă e infinit mai binevenită. Mereu spun că jocul de cărți are sens uneori, ca să apropie un cerc formal, dar între prieteni nu-și are niciodată rostul.""Pentru Emma au urmat zece zile de fericire aproape perfectă. Nu se gândise că putea fi din nou fericită atât de curând, dar după nenorocirile din ultimele câteva săptămâni, vesela și liniștita rutină de la Wickstead era lucrul cel mai liniștitor pentru ea."
This is a good lesson for all writers...finish your story!
Someday people will be salivating to know what happens next, and you won't be able to tell them.
I can just picture a young Jane reading over this story and thinking, "I don't know where to go with this story.
I'll just set it aside and go back to it later."  Two hundred years later we're begging to know what happens next?!
Does Emma find a Knightly or a Darcy?
Even though it is impossible to know the answers I keep reading this anyway just to hear the words of Jane.
Two stars seems pretty low, especially for an Austen, but this is an unfinished work after all, and as such it's actually quite good!The problem is that the unfinished part seems mostly to be the plot.
Austen had gotten quite a few words on paper before this was left unfinished.
Too many words without any discernible direction.
Maybe she hoped it would come along eventually and she good go back and wedge it in there.Regardless, this is still a pleasure to read for its Austen-esque style.
I enjoyed just letting the words flow over me as she create her scenes.
When you think of Jane Austen you think great novels like 'Pride and Prejudice', 'Sense and Sensibility', 'Northanger Abbey', 'Mansfield Park'....
But there are other works by Jane that aren't that popular and one of them is 'The Watsons', actually adding to the unpopularity is the fact that the tale is unfinished.
The Watsons tells the tale of Emma Watson, the youngest daughter of a clergyman who has actually been raised by her wealthy aunt.
When her aunt decides to re-marry she has to go back to her father's house and her siblings.
Of course because of its small size of the snippet there can be no real review but I think I can say that it was the beginning of something quite interesting.Ένα από τα ημιτελή μυθιστόρημα της Jane Austen το οποίο η συγγραφέας εγκατέλειψε πολύ νωρίς, γράφοντας τελικά μόνο πέντε κεφάλαια.
Φαίνεται ότι είναι η αρχή μιας ιστορίας που μοιάζει πολύ με τη ζωή της συγγραφέως εκείνη την εποχή.
Δεν γνωρίζουμε γιατί σταμάτησε το γράψιμο της αλλά είναι σίγουρο ότι ο αυτοβιογραφικός του χαρακτήρας σε μία συναισθηματικά δύσκολη περίοδο της ζωής της έκανε δύσκολη τη συνέχιση του.
Of the two brothers, Robert is married to a rather snobbish lady, and Sam is training to be a surgeon, and is in love with the daughter of the Watsons’ closest neighbour, the Edwards family.The youngest daughter of the Watsons, Emma, has been living with their aunt, due to Mrs Watson’s death.
As Emma says, “the luck of one member of a family is luck to all” – on a practical level the Watson ladies needed to marry, if they could.There are a number of works based on The Watsons.
I am sad that Jane Austen never got to complete the novel.
I would love to see how characters would grow in this novel.
That is the one thing about her characters they always seem to find their flaw and become a better person by the end of the book.
One example of charcter growth is Elizabeth in Pride and Prejudice was prejudice against Mr. Darcy and believed they thought themselves better and for this she almost lost him.
The book does end with a family memeber sharing where Jane was hoping to take the book.
This was a great start for a novel, but, unfortunately, it's only the start. Only 5 chapters were written and, while it has been sufficient to endear Emma and Elisabeth to me, I need more. An Austen heroine is always a lovable but flawed one and I'm dying to know her character better.Since Joan Aiken took on the project of writing a full book, I'm going to look into Emma Watson.
I am a big Jane Austen fan & have read all or thought I read all she had to offer her readers until I came across several unfinished earlier & later novels as well as writings from her teenage years.
When I talk about tone in this novel I mean that Jane's usual basic harmony of family even when surrounding others outside are quite disagreeable the immediate has a feeling of liking each other but in The Watsons it is dislike among siblings.
The worst thing you can read is - The Novel has never been completed.
I knew this from the moment I started reading it (I found in between unfinished Jane Austen works on the internet – Did some exploring when I remembered about one of my all time favorites authors) but I was not expecting to read this line.
If I remember correctly it was in Cambridge page of Jane Austen…something about classic authors which of course she is!
Unfortunately no one knows what might have happened after this… I guess reading something that’s not finished wasn’t the best idea ever.
The first five chapters of this book were written by Jane Austen around 1804 and the rest by "another" before its publication in 1977.
The plot was based on an earlier continuation written by Austen's niece who knew the story-line intended by her aunt as it had been talked about in the family.
As with Pride and Prejudice, the story follows the fortunes of a family in less than affluent circumstances.
I felt the story was completed in a style that complemented its early chapters and enjoyed the gentle tale of Emma's romance.
Quite nice for an unfinished novel, but because it's Austen, verbose to a fault. And by verbose I mean... I couldn't follow a thing. Contemplating writing the screenplay just to dissect it and save us all :)
A short, breezy completion of The Watsons by a fan. A million times better than that horrible book by Joan Aiken!! Certainly not as good as "Emma and Elizabeth" but maybe worth the short time for a quick dip into the world of The Watsons.
Miss Emma Watson, who was very recently returned to her family from the care of an aunt who had brought her up, was to make her first public appearance in the neighbourhood, and her eldest sister, whose delight in a ball was not lessened by a ten years' enjoyment, had some merit in cheerfully undertaking to drive her and all her finery in the old chair to D.
She finds the kindness of her eldest and most responsible sister, Elizabeth, more attractive.Living near the Watsons are the Osbornes, a great titled family.
Non riesco a dare stelline perché sostanzialmente non c'è storia.. Ho letto il libro consapevole del suo essere incompiuto, ma arrivare all'ultima parola è stata comunque una doccia fredda.Poi vabbé, io la mentalità dell'epoca proprio non riesco a concepirla.. Balli, cazzeggi vari ed eventuali, feste, rendite.. Ma seriamente? MA CHI LAVORA?!Però Emma mi è stata pure abbastanza simpatica, dai!
El único gran problema que le he visto a los Watson es que Jane Austen no ha podido terminarla.
Vemos un característico baile con todos los rumores, dudas y noticias que desata ...
Y cuando el baile termina, y volvemos a la casa de la familia, y parece que tenemos todo el argumento presentado y listo para desarrollarse ...
Y como único consuelo nos encontramos con un párrafo escrito por su sobrino explicándonos por donde piensan que habría ido la trama según comentarios de su tía.En definitiva, la sensación es de que hubiera sido una muy buena novela ...
Unfortunate.The rival suitor gets a fine ending, but you spend so much time with him that you really want him to be the main deal, not shoved aside at the last minute as a peripheral character.HOWEVER, this gets 4 stars from me because it is so exceptionally rare to find a decent Austen continuation or sequel.The Watsons is a fragment, and this author does a very passable job of matching the language.
and another decent Austen sequel was written in the 1910s...
From my perspective it makes their writing just a bit more believable when they aspire to Austen.
So far too much telling and not enough showing.
I know in the same period when Austen wrote this story--She stopped working on it in 1803--that novel told (rather than show) much more.
I am trusting that Austen would have done more showing.
Austen did some lovely showing in her completed novels, so I trust that she would have fixed parts of this novel fragment.Otherwise.....We do see a more elegant sister reminds me of Jane Fairfax.
The more relaxed sister reminds me of Jane Bennet.
So this novel continues to work out the same character issues.
Recognizably Austen's work.
Es una pena que Jane no terminara esta novela; lo poco que se nos presenta aquí me dejó salivando, no hay otra expresión, y conocer gracias a su sobrino cómo pensó ella que debía terminar la historia es en realidad un magro consuelo; pero es lo que hay y ha sido una delicia leer esta edición con unas ilustraciones tan bonitas.
I sort of regret getting acquainted with these few chapters, though it was rather pleasurable to hear good flow of language again, in the end I was left intrigued and with no possible means to know this story the way Austen imagined it. So my imagination will have to do..
I love reading a book, even an unfinished book by Jane Austen. Emma, I think, will rise above all circumstances.
obra de Jane Austen que quedó incompleta, pero que deja la trama de la posible novela.A pesar de lo poco que se puede deducir de este inicio de novela pintaba bastante bien.
Typical Austen! 💜Having read Austen's 6 novels and some of her Juvenilia I can say that her writings have something familiar about them but you never read the same story twice. The Watsons is no exception, I found its protagonist and her background quite interesting and probably it'd had been a good story!!There's something really sad about unfinished works especially when it happens to be by one of your favourite authors.
La scrittura appare lineare e decisa, come sempre la nostra Jane cancella la bellezza dell'uomo amato da tutte ma non dall'esimia protagonista, ribelle e intelligente.Purtroppo però il romanzo si blocca drasticamente e non potremmo mai sapere cosa succederà dopo...solo nella sua lettera a Cassandra c'è un pensiero che si rifà al Romanzo e che il nipote sottolinea nella sua Memoria (Memoir of Jane Austen) del 1871: “Mr. Watson già gravemente malato nei capitoli di apertura sarebbe morto presto e Emma costretta a dipendere per una casa dalla meschinità del fratello e della cognata.

****
You can tell that this was definitely an early work and you can see certain themes that were used in Austen's later novels. She refined these themes in her later works. It was a quick and easy read.

Mi é piaciuto tantissimo, peccato che non sia stato concluso, sarebbe stato un libro magnifico.
