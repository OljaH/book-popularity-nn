"I continue to believe that his great tetralogy – The Age of Revolution (1962), The Age of Industry (1975), The Age of Empire (1987) and The Age of Extremes (1994) – remains the best introduction to modern world history in the English language" writes a man whose political views could not be further from Hobsbawm's: Niall Ferguson.
(Heidegger).For anyone interested in understanding the modern world and their place in it, a sound grasp of modern history is indispensable.
The subject matter, the times in which I have lived much of my life, offers the chance to compare my own take on what I have known with the far more comprehensive understanding that Hobsbawm provides.Feminism, plate tectonics, quantum theory, fascism, video entertainment, the Cold War, free-market economics and so much more are served up fully, but are never bogged down with too much detail.
What was Dada and Bauhaus?What a shame this book could not be a text in schools below college level - yet it could not be because an adult reader can bring so much life-knowledge to the reading, about which a young person would be clueless.For the adult reader, the many pages will fly by.
Hobsbawm divides into three periods: the era of disasters, 1914-1945, the world to fire and sword; the golden age, the war boom that seem increasingly distant and miraculous; the debacle which led to the fall of communism but never the victory of capitalism.
The historian observes the political, economic, cultural, scientific or demographic in the world.
Of course, these perspectives are not glorious (the golden age was a parenthesis), because capitalism has not defeated communism, as believed willingly at the time, and as blind few who govern us still believe, capitalism also, at the end of the century is about to collapse, killing the planet and humanity.
He takes an objective stance on the state-planned economies of the Soviet Bloc, and whilst Soviet Russia was one of the countries that had escaped the stock market collapse of 1929 and the Great Depression that followed it due to its state-run five year plans that saw Russia become an industrial power house, it didn't stop the collapse of the Berlin Wall and the disintegration of Soviet Russia between 1989 and 1991, where this book ends.It is an aptly titled book.
I would like to read what Eric Hobsbawm would make of our current world situation, and seeing as this historian is still alive (according to wikipedia he is an impressive 94 years old), and has lived through this century that he writes about would be more than interesting.
Este último livro é, com certeza, o menor porém o mais ousado da série, visto que, em praticamento um enxuto volume de menos de 600 páginas, o autor tenta construir um esboço do foi o "breve século XX": um extraordinário turbilhão de eventos inusitados e chocantes, extremamente complexos, de duração ilogicamente efêmera que transformaram, sem dúvida, para sempre a história da humanidade, sendo o pós ano 1968, a meu ver, "the point of no return" no qual surge um mundo totalmente (e violentamente) amputado do pré-primeira guerra mundial - um mundo sem amarras sociais ou ideológicas, sem vencedores nem derrotados, um mundo, talvez, "pós-moderno".
Usually the only people tackling long general histories are conservatives.
So Hobsbawm offers something that was definitely missing.
Even though I knew most of the events of which he spoke, he offers sort of grandfatherly perspective to what the hell happened over the last 100 years, and makes the young solipsistic leftist like me feel better, not so cast adrift in history.
As long as it's not conservative revisionist crap, which I can now smell from a mile away, it sort of feels like everytime I learn something about history, it is a political act.
Di una chiarezza, bellezza, precisione e schiettezza senza precedenti. Questa "resa dei conti con il 900" mi ha fatto venire voglia di leggere il più possibile di questo autore. Spero di rimediare asap.
It probably helps that Hobsbawm was himself a Marxist historian who had supported the USSR during its most “extreme” period – that of the leadership of Josef Stalin – and remained largely unregenerate even at this late date.
Hobsbawm himself admitted that he is not really suited to a dispassionate analysis of contemporary history.
This book is worth reading for anyone preparing to teach a course concerned with any period of the twentieth century and a good “starter text” for new Graduate Students.
The Age of Extremes: A History of the World 1914-1991 takes as its subject matter what its author, Eric J.
Hobsbawm, calls "the short twentieth century," ranging from the start of World War One to the breakup of the Soviet Union.An avowed communist in his sympathies, Hobsbawm nonetheless writes a remarkably balanced history of his times, with interesting sidelights on the art and science of the century.
In general, I prefer Tony Judt's Postwar for some of the same period, though I like Hobsbawm's classification of the "short century" into "The Age of Catastrophe" (the two world wars and the period in between), and "The Golden Age" (the postwar period.
Contro: è lungo e peso; è un gigabignami del '900 e quindi molte questioni sono nominate in fretta e poco approfondite.Pro: è un volo di ampio respiro su tutta la storia del '900 ed è quindi uno strumento prezioso per comprendere in un unico ragionamento storico il secolo nella sua complessità; non fa sconti agli errori della politica e della società, offrendo un punto di vista molto critico soprattutto sugli avvenimenti del dopoguerra, dal boom degli anni '50-'60 alle contestazioni del '68 al liberismo degli anni '80 eccetera.
For if divorce, illegitimate, births and the rise of the single-parent (i.e. overwhelmingly the single-mother) household indicated a crisis in the relation between the sexes, the rise of a specific, and extraordinarily powerful youth culture indicated a profound change in the relation between the generations.He apparently uses the term 'order of magnitude' to mean 'approximate'; perhaps he fails to understand it is a term with a real scientific meaning.
You should already have a grasp of the history in order to read and understand this book.Having said all that, if you can stumble through the thicket that is Hobsbawm's syntax, there are a few insights you can pick up along the way.
I'm not giving this book a rating for a couple of reasons: I didn't read the whole lot, and it wasn't what I was hoping for.I was hoping for a book to give me a good overview of the bits of the 20th century I need to teach my yr11 course.
It said nothing about the suffragette movement, which was disappointing, although I guess it didn't fit into his theme of extremes and catastrophes; also didn't have that much about the American/Vietnam War. So I only read a couple of chapters.I quite liked his style - a bit rambly, and some interesting and challenging ways of looking at events and the long view of history.
A great appendix to Hobsbawm's history of the long nineteenth century (French Revolution to WWI), and a pretty decent place to start for 20th century history I would say. No complaints. And i'm a real complainer.
A Not-So-Short (Tendentious) History of the Short Twentieth Century Historiography has come a long way since the age of positivism, when it was conceived as the practice of collating historical "facts" and letting them "speak for themselves", of telling history "as it happened," to paraphrase empiricist Leopold von Ranke. The purview of the historian's profession has now expanded to encompass the pursuit and articulation of a deeper analysis and explication of the meaning of historical facts re
Hobsbawm declaims: "In many ways this period of capitalist-communist alliance against fascism - essentially the 1930s and 1940s - forms the hinge of twentieth-century history and its decisive moment", for "it is one of the ironies of this strange century that the most lasting results of the October [Russian] revolution, whose object was the global overthrow of capitalism, was to save its antagonist, both in war and in peace - that is to say, by providing it with the incentive, fear, to reform itself after the Second World War, and, by establishing the popularity of economic planning, furnishing it with some of the procedures for its reform" (7-8).This rapprochement between the capitalist world and the socialist camp did not survive the end of the successfully-prosecuted Second World War. Nevertheless, as the front between capitalism and communism congealed "from Stettin to Trieste" as the Cold War set in, the structural changes to Western democracies that came as a result of their wartime shift to the Left remained in place, even in America, where there was no return to classical liberalism.
Over the course of its roughly 400-500 pages, Hosbawm does his best make the non-communist (read: capitalist) nations look like complete monsters.
Rock music and its subgeneres are also left mostly unexplored.There is also a chapter dedicated to the scientific advances of the "short century" which is somewhat acceptably written.
Of course, this is a common missunderstanding, but one would expect that Hosbawm would counsult with mathematicians before writing about advanced mathematics.The books ends with a somewhat aceptable summary of the century and Hosbawm's own conclussion of what the future challenges are.
Après un long dix-neuvième siècle en trois volumes, un court XXème en un volume. J'ai bien apprécié le découpage par thématiques plutôt qu'une simple chronologie, mais ces différents chapitres sont de qualité inégale.
The first time I read this, I was a fussy new grad student, given to pick on anything. On second reading, this book simply amazes me. Bedtime reading for the kids.
Well, as I dont like them totalitarian ideas, this history book by a Communist was not very appetising. Some parts are rather disgusting.

Inoltre, applicato al secolo che ha sconvolto totalmente, come nessun altro periodo della storia umana, società e stili di vita (a livello globale) l'impresa rimarrà estremamente difficile anche agli storici di domani.Va detto che Hobsbawm è un intellettuale di stampo marxista, ma la sua interpretazione sul socialismo reale è quantomai critica e onesta, intellettualmente soprattutto: le cause del tracollo dei regimi comunisti sono scandagliate senza pietà così come i motivi dell'inadeguatezza di tale sistema di fronte al sistema misto sviluppato nell'Europa occidentale a partire dagli anni '50, il vero capolavoro del secolo breve.
But some of his passages on art, science and social issues (particularly those pertaining to homosexuality) were troubling and bordering on reactionary.
Especially passages such as this one about Alan Turing:Turing committed suicide in 1954, after having been convicted of homosexual behaviour, then officially a crime, and believed to be a medically or psychologically curable pathological condition.
He was not so much a victim of the criminalisation of (male) homosexuality in Britain before the 1960s as of his own failure to recognize it.
While the author comes to the conclusion that people generally have better lives when their governme
Due secoli in uno, la diluizione del quale verso il terzo millennio � il sorgere prepotente dell'importanza della scienza e ancor pi� della tecnica e il crollo delle ideologie e religioni come strumento di gestione o anche solo di comprensione, una dopo l'altra.
Se poi il povero Hobsbawm � criticato in quanto storico marxista cui si attribuisce la curiosa teoria (non � vero) che tracollo ed il fallimento del comunismo , non hanno incrinato il marxismo, qui troverete un'analisi impietosa della grande illusione e di tutti i suoi morti.
The book by its nature is more than just historical analysis, with personal observation and reflection informing its analysis.On its own terms it is an excellent book for gaining an understanding of cause and effect in the twentieth century.
Actually reading this book on its own terms Hobsbawm clearly identifies the problems, flaws and cruelties in "really existing socialism" and the other totalitarian regimes of the age of catastrophe in the first half of the century.
This book really got me thinking and reflecting and gives a good historical framework for understanding contemporary events.
The Age of Extremes, which covers most of 20th century American and European international politics, is a good read for any one interested in knowing at an intermediate level why things happened the way they did in Euro-US politics.
The 20th century is marked by 4 extremely important events: World Wars, the Cold War, and the fall of Berlin wall.
I approached this book to get a slightly better and academic view of the events mentioned.
Just two important things to take care of: One, it is an intermediate level book, so it is not meant for people who are newly exposed to 20th century history.
I read this with a ton of hope: I heard this guy was a british national treasure and one of the most famous living historians.
But the only thing I took from the book was his (I think accurate) theory that the 20th century was "short" and could be described as the period between the start of WWI and the end of the cold war.
The rest of it was pretty forgettable.
I think he's one of those historians that only makes sense if you've already spent a lifetime reading history and know the landscape pretty well.
It seems as if Hobsbawm was too confused or dishonest about the goals and accomplishments of communism to give it to us straight in chapter 2. It's possible that's because he was an old man. But it seems he'd had a lifetime to consider communism and hadn't quite strayed from the idea that world-wide revolution was still the answer. I'm not interested in muddled thinking, or diplomacy at gunpoint and his meandering analysis would have snapped my already broken bag of books even further.
عصر نهایت ها اریک هابسبام تاریخ جهان 1914 تا 1991 ترجمه حسن مرتضوی
عصر نهایت ها اریک هابسبام تاریخ جهان 1914 تا 1991 ترجمه‌ حسن مرتضوی
Fantastičan pregled povijesti "kratkog" 20. stoljeća, sa sociološkom analizom. Ova me knjiga, baš kao i njegove druge knjige, nije nimalo razočarala.
In Hobsbawm's opinion, the historian of the third millenium will identify two transformations as the most important of the 20th century:1)For most men, the middle ages ended in the 50's and 60's, that is, they once and for all stopped living off the land, and migrated to a city.
Or here's another:' At bottom liberal politics was vulnerable because its characteristic form of government, representative democracy, was rarely a convincing way of running states...'What strikes me is the range of subjects a historian should be conversant with, in order to adequately interpret world events.If you wish to make your flesh crawl with the horrors of the Communist regimes, or wish to see capitalism extolled to the skies, this is not the book for you.
çeviri dolayısıyla okumakta zorlansam da oldukça doyurucu bir kitaptı.
zaten yüzyılın ilk yarısı dünya savaşları, ikinci yarısı da soğuk savaş dönemi olduğundan yazarın iyi bir şeye değinme şansı pek yok.
yine de her bölüme konulmuş sanat kısmı arada siyasetten ve ekonomiden başka hareketler de olduğunu görmenize yarıyor.
planlı programlı yazılmış akademik bir kitap bence, başlık ve kapak ülkemizde çok moda olan popüler tarih kitaplarından olduğu izlenimi verirse şayet aldanmayın.
yüzyıla her yönüyle hakim olmak isterseniz, siyasetten ekonomiye ve sanata, avrupadan latin amerika ve afrikaya kadar oldukça kapsamlı bir tarih yazımı.
keşke başka bir yayınevinden -popüler tarih romanı gibi değil de- daha özenli olarak basılsaymış.
