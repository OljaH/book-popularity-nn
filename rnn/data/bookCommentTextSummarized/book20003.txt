There will not be enough therapy in the world to take on this kid's emotional problems.Describing sex is obviously Simons' favorite thing, but she does also enjoy describing Tatiana and Alexander, perfect specimens that they are.
While a husband treating a wife this way might have been deemed normal or acceptable at the time, that does not make Alexander any less of an abusive monster.One of the main fights Alexander and Tatiana have is about the fact that she insists on working at the hospital, even after he's earning enough money to support the family.
What a   beautiful   book and  wonderful  conclusion to one of the  greatest  love stories  ever  told!!!!
Their memories haunt them like scars - unforgettable souvenirs of a war neither of them wanted to fight as they struggle to build a new life in the States with their son.I really viewed books 1 & 2 as one story.
I read this book SO slowly, savoring every word, never wanting the story to end.Paullina Simmons is a truly gifted author.
❝He is thinking of sailboats in distant oceans, the desert from dimmest childhood, the ghost of fortune, the girl on the bench. When he saw her, he saw something new. He saw it because he wanted to see it, because he wanted to change his life. He stepped off the curb and out of the deadfall. To cross the street. To follow her. And she will give your life meaning, she will save you. Yes, yes—to cross.'We’ll meet again in Lvov, my love and I…' Tatiana hums, eating her ice cream, in our Leningrad
Yes, yes—to cross.'We’ll meet again in Lvov, my love and I…' Tatiana hums, eating her ice cream, in our Leningrad, in jasmine June, near Fontanka, the Neva, the Summer Garden, where we are forever young.❞
Alexander and Tatiana's story should've ended a LONG time ago.
It's taken over my whole life and yet it's only been 3-4 days!The Bronze Horseman became my favorite book of all time.
Reading this trilogy has touched my heart in ways I never expected it would and no matter how bad or ugly things got in the end, I am truly grateful that The Bronze Horseman found its way into my life.
This was just a dreary Tatiana and a dreary Alexander, struggling through one hell of a dreary marriage until they finally get a Happily Ever After in their 80s at the end of the novel.
22 year old Alexander stood between Tatiana and her entire household declaring that no one in her family would be hitting her anymore...
He did not have any of the charm, that solid feeling of a strong sense of duty towards honoring and caring for Tatiana anymore.
Just end with the sense of hope and contentment that Tatiana and Alexander leaves the reader with instead of 60 years of a bad, desperate, dysfunctional marriage.
Alexander feels like a failure, so Tatiana spends most of the story desperately trying to get him back.
He uses his physical strength to get his way, hides her from his friends, blames his actions on alcohol, and then tells Tatiana half truths and guilts her when she says her friends saw him disappear into a room with a naked woman.A few chapters later Alexander cheats on her with some other woman.
But Alexander finds a way to still yell at Tatiana over this and blame her?!
Alexander is all bitter, saying he thought and hoped that Tatiana would never find out.
0 Star I read this book a long time ago and I'm going to jump headfirst into this review.
I did not like many, many things in the first book, but I accepted them.
Those were damn well his choices .He emotionally abused Tatiana the entire time.
And he being 6 feet tall and so strong, couldn't push her away ,right ?He physically abuses his wife multiple times.
No man with INTEGRITY AND BACKBONE , no matter what the reason cheats on his wife.
Tatiana had to bear this egoistical, arrogant, disrespectful, abusive, piece of shit's behavior all because she loved him??
Su historia nos afecta tanto porque son Tatiana y Alexander, dos personajes con los que hemos sufrido más de lo indecible, y que hemos llegado a querer demasiado.
Claramente él no es un angelito, yo lo tengo calzado desde la primera novela, pero, como en todo matrimonio, las culpas siempre son compartidas.Paullina Simons demuestra una vez más una sensibilidad apabullante al momento de traspasarnos los sentimientos y emociones de ambos personajes.
Son pocas las veces (y esta ha sido una de ellas) en que tenido que esperar 2 o 3 días antes de poder comenzar con otra lectura.Esta última entrega es realmente conmovedora y, aunque la acción tarda un poco en arrancar, tiene muy merecidas mis 5 estrellas.
My Tatiana and Alexander whirlwind has officially (and reluctantly), come to an end.
At first- I was unsure where this book was headed; Alexander's character had changed dramatically due to the trials of war, and I was afraid the old "Shura" would never return.
Never before have I felt the kind of love and admiration as I have for these two characters, and in their ability to overcome the seemingly impossible.
"The Summer Garden", although filled with its share of angst, provided much needed healing and offered the perfect, most lovely ending to a passionate journey that I am not likely to ever forget...
Esta historia es eso que pasa tras el felices para siempre, es la relación de pareja de unos personajes con el alma torturada, que se aman con locura pero que hasta ahora nunca habían convivido ni vivido juntos-más allá de ese breve paraíso que fue Lazarevo-; de unos personajes complicados e imperfectos con un pasado incruento e imposible de borrar, con sus claroscuros, su dependencia uno del otro, su cabezoneria y sus malas decisiones -ay Shura, lo que me has hecho llorar no está escrito-.
Todo ello bellamente narrado de forma magistral y con un punto cruel -la vida, de nuevo- por esa increíble autora que es Paullina Simons.Mención aparte merece para mí en este libro el personaje de Anthony, que como primer hijo de sus padres sufre tanto o más que ellos, y cuya triste historia me ha llegado al corazón.
Tatiana and Alexander have forever imprinted themselves on my heart.While the first two books, The Bronze Horseman and Tatiana and Alexander is about their madly- all consuming- crazy - doomed love, The Summer Garden is about what happens after you get your supposedly happily ever after...it's about LIFE.
It's the most important one.Tatiana and Alexander have survived the worst of the 20th century - from Hitler’s invasion and siege of Leningrad and starvation and death to the war camps in Germany- and I've cried a river for them but it's The Summer Garden which was the most challenging to read.
There's not often a series comes a along that will change ones life forever, but The Bronze Horseman, Tatiana and Alexander and The Summer Garden have.
Trilogía emocionalmente ARROLLADORA. ❤Argumentalmente SUBLIME. ❤Después de 2372 páginas y 17 días de vivir y sentir cada momento, cada lugar, cada situación, cada sentimiento, cada personaje de esta maravillosa, extraordinaria, preciosa e inolvidable historia, yo me pregunto... ¿Cómo se sigue ahora?
Trilogía emocionalmente ARROLLADORA. ❤️Argumentalmente SUBLIME. ❤️Después de 2372 páginas y 17 días de vivir y sentir cada momento, cada lugar, cada situación, cada sentimiento, cada personaje de esta maravillosa, extraordinaria, preciosa e inolvidable historia, yo me pregunto... ¿Cómo se sigue ahora?
Many times, while turning the pages I was sorely tempted to put it down.
Eventhough, there were times I could literally hear my heart breaking, and the words were so blurred, I couldn't even decipher them, and sitting still, was an absoloute impossibility, my foot in constant agitated motion.
Where, once the honeymoon phase is over, and life brings with it all its profound difficulties, a staggering percentage of couples raise there white flags and simply walk away.
Two amazing people, loving eachother to distraction, refusing to allow the pressures of life destroy the very reason they've survived, simply REFUSE to raise their white flags.
While this book is my favorite from the series it is also the most difficult emotionally to read.
Tatiana and Alexander embark on a journey that is life..
I can only say if you haven't read it run out and buy it!
(if you can find it in the U.S.) Perfect closure to a wonderful series.
Alexander will break your heart but I found that I would allow it to break 100x just to find the love that he and Tatiana share.
My favorite quote shows Tatiana's capacity for love and forgiveness and Alexanders devotion and love for her.
Amazing!"Alexander, you broke my heart.
I have found in life that the big things, like death and pain, are far easier to survive then the little things that can eat you away before you even realize it.
The little tidbits of Tatiana's former life that Simons throws into The Summer Garden, only reinforces that fact, and I for one loved that part of the story telling, though I can imagine some people would have found it extraneous.Tatiana and Alexander's love was so deep, so intense, that it became their greatest strength as well as their greatest weakness and it became the strength of these novels as well.Although I know these books are not for everyone- their huge, sweeping and daunting at times- but so worth the time invested.
I absolutely loved The Bronze Horseman, the first book in the Tatiana and Alexander trilogy, and was looking forward to reading the conclusion to their epic love story.I was greatly (and grievously) disappointed.
Yes, Simons delivered by giving an incredibly emotional ride but (and this is a HUGE but), there was just one scene which totally and UTTERLY made the whole trilogy feel like an epic waste.**********SPOILERS:Dear Paullina Simons,You have balls.WHY, why?
His devotion to Tatiana, the fact that he would do anything for her, and his FIDELITY to her, after his years of numerous sexual debauchery, was one thing that made him utterly awesome.
This story, of two people in incredible times, THIS is what reading is all about.
This is the kind of book you dream about at night.
These are the kind of characters who infiltrate your thoughts all day.
This is the kind of story that stays with you for your lifetime.
I have lived someone else's lifetime within my own...and what an incredible lifetime it was.These are novels I will revisit again one day.
I wish I could read them for the first time again!
Αυτο ηταν λοιπον...
Τελειωσε αυτο το μαγευτικο ταξιδι.
Ισως το τελος το ηθελα λιγακι διαφορετικο αλλα δικαιολογω το μηνυμα που ηθελε να περασει και το οποιο ειναι εμφανες.
Για εμενα ειναι ο πιο ομορφος ερωτας που γεννηθηκε κ φουντωσε κατα τη διαρκεια του Β' Παγκοσμιου Πολεμου.
Ανθρωποι που δε φοβηθηκαν τα δεινα του πολεμου, που αγωνιστηκαν, θυσιαστηκαν, τραυματιστηκαν σωματικα κ ψυχικα και επεζησαν.
Περασαν απο πολλες δοκιμασιες, αντιμετωπισαν καθημερινα προβληματα αλλα παλεψαν ενωμενοι και τα ελυσαν.
Προδοθηκαν και συγχωρεθηκαν.
Ειμαι σιγουρη πως θα μου λειψουν πολυ οι ηρωες της τριλογιας.
Στο μυαλο μου ομως θα μεινουν για πολυ καιρο.
Lo mismo que la primera vez (solo que ésta es la sexta) soy incapaz de cerrar este libro. Después de sus emocionantes, desgarradoras y maravillosas 960 páginas, sigo sin poder cerrarlo.Esta historia de amor, guerra y vida es demasiado grande para el corazón de cualquiera. Insuperable, nada se le compara.Volvería a leerlo un millón de veces más.
//RELECTURA// “I don't want this life to end," said Alexander. "The good, the bad, the everything, the very old, to ever end.” 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍Yo tampoco, Alexander, ni vuestra vida ni vuestra inmortal historia ni este fantástico y maravilloso libro que cada vez que lo leo me emociona un poco más (aunque ponga que es la segunda vez que lo leo realmente son un par más...). ¿¿¿Dónde está la opción de poner diez estrellitas a un libro??? ¡Este trilogía necesita esa opción!Es increíbl
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍Yo tampoco, Alexander, ni vuestra vida ni vuestra inmortal historia ni este fantástico y maravilloso libro que cada vez que lo leo me emociona un poco más (aunque ponga que es la segunda vez que lo leo realmente son un par más...).
Eso es lo que me pasa con la historia de Tatiana y Alexander y con este libro, que yo adoro a más no poder, tan duro y tan precioso a la vez...
I was sooo happy when I started reading this book and finally got to the parts I've been waiting for..Shura and Tania back together!
Usually they ended up staying way longer than a month and for the most part that was a good thing.
Alexander also has to insert himself into Anthony's life and become his Dad which is a little hard because he's been so used to Tania.
It was a bit hard to keep track of who was who but I liked how things seem to come full circle especially the part where Shura and Tania were in town.
This conclusion to The Bronze Horseman series, which I have been reading for years, was perfect.
Once again, Paullina Simons delivers a beautiful love story that is a continuation to the first two books, and I loved seeing where things were going with Tatiana and Alexander.
It's brutal, but it's honest, and I think you can learn a lot from reading it.
Sure, there are some moments which you might question because they make you feel uncomfortable, but the thing is that those moments make sense in the bigger picture of Tatiana's and Alexander's story.
8:30 de la mañana, toda la noche leyendo, HE TERMINADO!!Necesito digerir este cúmulo de emociones que tengo. Me va a costar mucho desprenderme del recuerdo de Tania y Shura. No creo que lo consiga nunca. Haré la reseña cuando esté más preparada... pero decir que esta saga es la mejor que he leído en toda mi vida es quedarse corta ToT
Figuring out how to live your life when you’re all busted up inside and out—there is nothing harder.”  Read from June 17 to 24, 2012I just finished and it was AMAZING.
I loved how in the second book, Tatiana and Alexander, you got flashbacks and insight into Alexander and what forged him growing up and then with The Summer Garden you get the same for Tatiana.
The end of this book brought the story full circle for me and it felt like I got the prize at the bottom of the cereal box.
(hide spoiler)] This book answers the question everyone has at the end of every love story.
there were parts I absolutely adored and there were parts I really struggled with.It is long.
and in a book this long, trust me, 2% takes a while to read!
I tend to be quite an emotional sap when reading books as it.
Obviously, with a book this long, soooo much happens.
This book is a real 'life story'.
It follows two young lovers through, to the end of their lives.
And the book reflects that so emotively that I felt as if I had lived every second with them.
"I don't want this life to end," said Alexander.
ALL THE STARS. So its been weeks since I finished The Summer Garden and I havent been been able to write this review at all. But why? You ask. What in the world is going on with you? This is your favorite romance of all time. After all, this is Shura we are talking about... Shura with the sled and the copy of Pushkin and Shura with the creme-brulee eyes and delicious tanned skin with that faint scent of nicotine in the morning after endless bouts of hot Lazarevo sex. Didnt you love this book and
Like, for real people, who is going to compare to Alexander Barrington?
Well, I already read Outlander, Dragonfly in Amber and Voyager years ago and while I enjoyed them very much - Outlander is one of my favorite romance novels of all time after all - let's face it.
I mean, if you don't have potato shelf levels of hotness, I don't know what to tell you.So I'm going to turn this review, which let's face it, I'm doing an awful job of actually reviewing The Summer Garden, into a desperate plea for recommendations on what to do with my life reading-wise post TBH.
Qué bonitos estos tres libros, desde el primero hasta el último...
qué bien estructurados están absolutamente todos los personajes, son tan sólidos que se pueden permitir perfectamente los saltos en el tiempo y otras licencias....
es todo tan intenso y está todo tan bien descrito, que lo estás viviendo prácticamente en primera persona desde el principio y hasta el final.
Puede que le falle un poco la edición, pero son muchos datos, muchos tiempos verbales que revisar, minucias en comparación con la calidad general de la trilogía completa en sí.
Desde luego, altamente recomendable....
And yet...Every time I reread their story my love grows deeper and deeper.
I will be rereading/reliving it until the end of time.
10-Oct. 11, 2015*Fourth read: July 26-Aug 12, 2016*Fifth read: March 28-April 3, 2017 (audio)Fourth read notes: As usual, every time I reread a Paullina Simons novel, I find new meaning and new favorite quotes.
I'm sorry but there is absolutely no better way that Paullina Simons could have ended this book.
PERFECTION!!!Fifth read notes: my heart is so full right now.
Every time I reread these books different parts stick out for me and I pick up something new.
The spectacular, emotional conclusion to my all-time favorite love story! Exhaustingly intense. Piercingly agonizing. Achingly beautiful. Enduringly romantic. I FELT EVERY MOMENT. INFINITY STARS!!!!! “To cross the street. To follow her. And she will give your life meaning, she will save you. Yes, yes-to cross.” How does one get past this series? How can you even begin to compare other love stories to the one of Tatiana and Alexander? You just cannot, I think. The three books will forever sit on
The three books will forever sit on a shelf all their own, for what they imparted is an unforgettable story of love and survival… come what may.Book 3, The Summer Garden, is quite different from book 2, which is different from book 1.
The Bronze Horseman is about Tatiana and Alexander coming together, believing their love is real, unstoppable, forever… alive and burning despite war and starvation.
Book 2, Tatiana and Alexander, is about fiercely fighting fate and finding each other in a sea of impossible circumstances… it’s about being relentless and unforgiving in your pursuit of happiness.
“I don’t want this life to end,” said Alexander.
There were things I loved about this book and there were things I hated about this book, but in can all be wrapped up in one word that never fails to describe Tatiana & Alexander - Orbeli.
Each other's purpose for living.I loved seeing them trying to figure out the relationship & marriage they thought they would never have.
I hated seeing them trying to figure it out as well.
I treasure books that are written by someone whose words can pull me into the story and take me on a roller coaster of emotion that I don't ever want to end.
Amazing!!!! If I could give this book 10 stars I would! The Summer Garden is the final book in the epic Bronze Horseman Trilogy. This final installment was set to a different pace. In both the Bronze Horseman and Tatianna and Alexander, there was love, betrayal, tragedy and hope set against the backdrop of WWII. The action was intense as well as fast paced. In the Summer Garden, their story continues with life after the war and really delves into the characters and their day to day relationship
The Summer Garden is the final book in the epic Bronze Horseman Trilogy.
In both the Bronze Horseman and Tatianna and Alexander, there was love, betrayal, tragedy and hope set against the backdrop of WWII.
In the Summer Garden, their story continues with life after the war and really delves into the characters and their day to day relationship.
After reading all three books in the course of three weeks, I felt as though I really knew Tatianna and Alexander and felt all the love, joy, pain, and suffering these characters went through.
