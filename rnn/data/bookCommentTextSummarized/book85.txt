Another good short story by Christie.
Theo is running away with her lover Vincent when her husband Richard leaves her a message to tell her he’s in trouble for some kind of fraud.
She dumps the lover and goes back to help.
But it turns out he wants her to go to a man and ask him to return or shred some documents that may implicate him in the scandal.The man, is her lover, Vincent.What does she do?***Ah the double standards of cheating men… *grits teeth* I wanted Theo to be stronger.I’m also guessing the line: ‘Your tower is bigger than Richard’s’ is a modern addition.
Extremely boring!
Ruthless! Good story. One of my favourites!!
Wow. Thought-provoking.
Agatha Christie channels Ibsen in this precarious and heartbreaking tale of romance and mystery.
Reminded me of an Oscar Wilde play, without the humor. It was painfully obvious that this story was written during the downfall of Agatha's first marriage.
