A mental exploration of the subconscious mind with spurts of outlandish concepts and dreamlike surrealism.Reading Murakami's short stories felt like having a box of chocolates in front of you, but you'll never know what you're going to get.
This has a strange ending."The Little Green Monster" - 4 starsA great little story about a solitary wife seemingly trapped in her own house.
Acting like a fairy godfather, he promises that he can make any woman fall in love with our narrator just by dancing, but the dwarf needs to possess his body first.
Smitten with a woman he loves, our narrator agrees to the dwarf's condition.
A few are equally adept at writing novels and short stories.
So when Murakami’s prototypical ambivalent protagonist shows in a short story (which they often do, in this collection), the results are unspectacular.
What one might consider “breathing space” in a Murakami novel, a place where the reader can coast through the reading before returning to the more meaty, idea-heavy sections, becomes a void in his short work.
I started off as a short story writer, then pushed my way through novellas, then novels.
Murakami seems to have the opposite problem, soaring in his novels while stuttering in his short stories.Thankfully, there are exceptions.

Through the bizarre situations the characters face, the reader can relate on some level.The first few stories did annoy me, as many of them didn''t seem to end properly.
The characters flit through their lives, and Murakami flits through their stories.
The perfect book for reading on a crowded bus, i thought.The one thing that did bug me about this book was Alfred Birnbaum's translations.
Some sentences seemed like they weren't quite finished: the words were in English, but the sense was convoluted.
Whereas Murakami does take the bus, and quietly reads over your shoulder.

It took me to the Christopher Nolan's movie.
2) Give it an erotic angle As I can't sleep, I took a walk.
The waitress asked me if I wanted a drink or a lapdance.
As soon as I sat on the bed, she started performing.
I asked the stripper about the photo.
It's not that I didn't want to know.
After a long time, she said, "You know.
My 17 days and 17 nights insomnia had come to an end.
I really don't think I can write ever like Murakami.
I don't know if I will read one of his book again.
Just like in this story, the things I come up with are always impractical.Anyway, the message begins with 'Once upon a time', and ends with 'Don't you think that's a sad story?'*********************************************************To read the second half (and actual first half, where he meets her on the street) of the original story, On seeing the 100% perfect girl one beautiful April morning, get your hands on The Elephant Vanishes or another one of Murakami's short story collections which includes this piece.I've always liked reading, but for some reason or other, I didn't read too many novels through my teenage years.
The play (as required, I'm sure) was balls-out crazy, all in Japanese, with a ticker doing subtitles at the the top of the stage.
My memory sucks, but I think I recall a bunch of people with static-spewing TVs for heads, and some crazy shit with sideways sleeping people.

Tacking on the other ten titles felt like padding so that the publisher could charge for a novel-length outing.The other stories get between 1 and 2 stars each and are not worth noting whatsoever, as they were completely unremarkable.
Murakami joins Neil Gaiman on my list of authors who should stick to novel writing.
I highly recommend the two novels I listed in this review, but I cannot recommend this collection.Final Judgment: Like watching your crush take a shit.
قرأت اليوم أربعة قصص قصيرة للعزيز موراكامى، كانت حرق حظيرة هذه هى آخرهم.ينجح دومًا فى إنارة شعلة صغيرة فى عقلك قد لا يلتفت لها أحدًا.

See, with Murakami, it's all about symbolisms.Some of the stories in this book are perfect (Sleep and TV People had me screaming, for instance).

Like the secretive, quiet fall of rain, they steal into the gloom... They say that surrealist author Haruki Murakami captures the 'common ache' of the 'contemporary heart and mind'. I thought this was a pretty spot-on description of some of his best short stories. I began reading Murakami in 2007, and he was a writer whose work and style resonated so strongly for me at that time where I'm confronted with the ambiguities of daily existence. He will always hold a special place in my heart as one
Reading The Elephant Vanishes was a most welcome endeavor then, because if there was any author that understands how inexplicable and often unknowable one's self is, it's Murakami-sensei.Composed of seventeen enthralling tales with the titular story as its ending piece, this anthology is possibly one of the more interesting collections from Murakami.
Anecdotal stories like On seeing the 100% Perfect Girl one Beautiful April Morning, Lederhosen, The Little Green Monster, A Window and Barn Burning were simple in concept but layered with more meaning and symbolism, heightened by the Murakami treatment said author has become famous for.
To Murakami's fans, I must apologize, because although I liked this collection of stories, I didn't love it.
And from what I've heard, to read Murakami is to fall in love with him.
However, if his novels mirror the dazzling, freakish, and surprising plot of Sleep,or have the tension that builds when you must follow outlandish characters, like the ones in The Second Bakery Attack, I'll read a Murakami novel again and again.
Yet while I do admire the fragmentary poignancy of the narratives in this collection, as well as the bizarre trajectory of these stories, I found myself lost in some of the translation (Jay Rubin's translations were my favorites).
شرعت بالتقاط برتقالة خيالية ، ثم قشرتها بمهل ، ودفعت شرائح البرتقال إلي فمها ، بصقت بذورها دفعة واحدة في وقت واحد ، وأخيراً تخلصت من بقايا القشور في الإناء علي يمينها بينما كانت تأكل الفاكهة بأكملها ، أعادت هذه المناورة مرة بعد مرة لمدة عشرين دقيقةقلت : يبدو أنك موهوبة جداقالت : أوة .
ليس شيئاً أن تجعل نفسك تصدق أن هناك برتقالة ، ثم تنسي أنه لا توجد واحدة ، هذا كل ما في الأمر )/موراكامي أنت بارع بارع للغاية ..
ثم تنسي أنك تحيا من وراء قفلا خياليا من صنعك أنت ...
There were some good stories, but overall I don't think Murakami is someone I would go to for short stories. He is terrible at conclusions for them, and only 1 or 2 stories left me wanting more. He is very very hit or miss with me and I'm finding a lot of misses with him lately. He has a very distinct style that shines through every novel he writes, but weirdly, I only like it sometimes.
Αποφάσισα να διαβάσω το συγκεκριμένο διήγημα λίγες ώρες μετά την ταινία Burning που προβλήθηκε στις Νύχτες Πρεμιέρας η οποία ήταν βασισμένη ως ένα σημείο στο βιβλίο. Η ιστορία αν και απλή μου άρεσε πάρα πολύ! Το μόνο μειονέκτημα είναι ότι θα ήθελα να έχει ακόμα περισσότερες σελίδες, να μάθω ακόμα περισσότερα πράγματα για τους ήρωες και το φινάλε. Αλλά οκ, Μουρακάμι είναι αυτός, ο,τι θέλει κάνει.
Over the course of any given story, they will generally make a similie, listen to music (classical and classic rock, generally), eat spaghetti, and have awkward conversations with people which may or may not be typically Japanese.
This has some interest in itself, especially if you happen to be interested in the congruencies that have grown between cultures as a result of globalization (why do all his characters listen to Western music and read Western novels?).

The Elephant Vanishes (TEV) is a compilation of 17 short stories which largely features loneliness, isolation and the act of breaking off the chains of conformity to modern Japanese highly expectant culture.
But on a brighter side, she gained her independence and succeed in breaking off the chains of societal conformity which was expected as a woman and a housewife.2.
Barn BurningBarn Burning tells a story of an encounter of the narrator and a girl who was "peeling a mandarin orange".
The narrator then became an acquaintance with the girl's boyfriend who loved to burn barns.
At the end of the story, I caught myself asking: Does he really burn barns?3.

Weird. No point in trying to understand why of a story. Just read and go with it.
Независимо дали пише романи, съчинения или кратки новели, той отново проявява своята ексцентрична абстрактност, която толкова много харесвам.
1) Птицата с пружина и жените във вторник   - 4 звезди- предполагам, че идеята за романа " Хроника на птицата с пружина" е тръгнала именно от този разказ и впоследствие Мураками го е наградил в самостоятелно произведение.
И през цялото време съзнанието ми беше съвсем будно.
" 12) TV хора   - 5 звезди 13) Бавен кораб до Китай   - 5 звезди" Всеки има различна памет.
Харесвам Мураками, най- вече заради усещанията, които провокира в мен.
Murakami here delivers a highly accessible and quirky collection of stories.
A quirky urban story.4* The Second Bakery Attack.
A very short story in which a man walks by a 100% perfect girl and later contemplates his passivity after passing by.
Fairly strong tale, both tragic and comical.
A strong story about a man encountering a barn burner.
Strong story about individuals within families and a realisation that self-perception isn't always accurate.
Murakami makes the mundane interesting here in another strong story.
This collection ends superbly with the title story - yes, it's literal...And it's brilliant in the way it's normalised.
