The boys went off to fight with swords while girls had to learn dog barks and owl hoots. No wonder princesses were so impotent in fairy tales, she thought. If all they could do was smile, stand straight, and speak to squirrels, then what choice did they have but to wait for a boy to rescue them? If any book ever deserved to be Disney-fied, this would be it.This book is seriously sweet. It was just delightful. It is a middle grade "alternative" fairy tale which parodies and utilizes fairy tale t
As all girls know, looking good takes a fuck ton of work, and Sophie has to work at it.
They have to stay, they have to work at it if they are to stay alive.Fairy tales are darker than they look, and surviving this school will take all of Sophie and Agatha's cunning.
Or will both Agatha and Sophie realize that they're where they should be, all along?The Setting: “Well, in the School for Good, they teach boys and girls like me how to become heroes and princesses, how to rule kingdoms justly, how to find Happily Ever After,” Sophie said.
♫ ''Two towers like twin headsOne for the pure,One for the wicked.Try to escape you’ll always failThe only way out is Through a fairy tale...'' I would love to say that this was a cute story filled with beautiful and lovely themes like friendship, love and trust but it was actually the opposite.And it was violent. Quite violent.While I didn’t expect the story to be like that, I did enjoy it and found it very entertaining.Sophie is a princess-like girl who dreams of princes and forever beauty, w
Quite violent.While I didn’t expect the story to be like that, I did enjoy it and found it very entertaining.Sophie is a princess-like girl who dreams of princes and forever beauty, while Agatha is a more...gothic girl.
She never stopped trying to prove herself and that got my respect...before she actually did start to act—and be—like a witch.I liked the world-building and even almost loved it.
When a character talked (except for the main ones) I had to dig hard in my memory to find who that person actually is and what her/his connections with the girls or prince are.The prince, Tedros, by the way, started out being very entertaining.
Still, I gave this one a chance and Soman Chainani actually surprised me at first, after a few chapters I really thought The School for Good and Evil would fall into the former category rather than the latter, but by the end my overall impression is a book that’s rather shallow yet completely incoherent.First of all, I’m not a fan of black and white good versus evil - I tend to find those kinds of stories played straight, well, boring (and judging people based on their looks just plain dumb and not a lesson any kid should be learning) - no matter how many cheesy fairy tale riffs are used to liven up the story.
Let this be a lesson, teenage girls: even if you do good things, unless your self-worth improves, you will always be ugly and people will call you a witch.And actually, I'm not sure this book even says THAT, because is it really self-worth if you only thought you were beautiful because other people were telling you as much?However, now that Aggie is pretty and has self-esteem, suddenly she fits right in with the good girls.
Because as the girls disappear to go to Happily Ever After together, Aggie realizes if she goes with Sophie she'll never get to be with the BOY!
The pretty cover clothes a disturbingly dark story, but one of humor, friendship, and dare I say it, true love.Sophie and Agatha are two very different girls.
Agatha, on the other hand, is hideous and after getting kidnapped to the school, she only wants to go home with her best friend, Sophie.
She relapses to her old selfish ways multiple times in the narrative (usually over a prince and screwing Agatha over in the process), but towards the end, I was rooting for so hard even though (view spoiler)[she had turned evil.
Though I must confess I liked her less towards the end when (view spoiler)[she went all moony-eyed over Tedros.
“She had always found villains more exciting than heroes. They had ambition, passion. They made the stories happen. Villains didn't fear death. No, they wrapped themselves in death like suits of armor!”  Story ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐Did you ever wish you were part of a fairy tale like Snow White or Cinderella? Yes? Than that’s the perfect book for you. Every four years two children are kidnapped from Gavaldon and disappear. This year the mysterious man takes two girls, two friends: Sophie and Agatha. But when th
This year the mysterious man takes two girls, two friends: Sophie and Agatha.
But when they arrive a strange thing happens: the beautiful Sophie is send to the school of evil whereas Agatha is send to the school of good.
Go home/get to the right school/ save my friend/ get the princeBut the farther I got the more I learned to love the characters, especially Agatha.
But next to Agatha and Sophie the other characters felt really simple and plain.
For every part of the fairy tale there is a school - one for good and one for evil.
REVIEW TO COME TOMORROWSecond Read Review : THE REVIEW IS POSTED  "For he looked into your hearts and saw something very rare. Pure Good and Pure Evil." this book was recommended to me by my big sister, she said that this book was good and she thought I would like it and I should tried reading it but that time I hated reading novels for no apparent reason. I just hated so I just ignored her recommendation until February 2015. I don't remember the exact date but I do remember that on February 201
this book was recommended to me by my big sister, she said that this book was good and she thought I would like it and I should tried reading it but that time I hated reading novels for no apparent reason.
this book changed my whole life and I never want to be the person I was before I became a book lovernow, lets talk about the book!I decided to reread this book because I used to love it and I gave it 5 stars so I wanted to know whether I still loved it or not and at first I didn't really enjoy it like it bored me but I kept reading it and the story got interesting and this book also made me laugh so much and I also found myself muttering like " JUST KISS!
BUT PLOT TWIST: Agatha ends up in the School for Good, and Sophie, in the School for Evil.DUN DUN DUN.It’s actually a whole lot more boring than that.
It’s boring; it’s repetitive; it’s slow-moving; it’s filled with plot-holes; it’s supremely indecisive about its own themes, characters, and storylines.But.That premise tho.I am so fully torn on EVERYTHING ELSE about this book.
There’s this guy Tedros who is a total babe, and Sophie targets him, but I kinda like the him/Agatha schtick?
There’s a big friendship with Sophie and Agatha, which I normally love (yay female friendship!) but it’s just so problematic sometimes.
This might even be a 4.5/5 stars. I really really enjoyed this a lot - the anti fairy tale thing is so well done and just SO GOOOOOD. Love the characters love everything LOVE.
3.5Overall I enjoyed this book. The story was really fun and I liked the way the author played around with fairytale tropes. But what killed it for me was the pacing. It took forever to read because I would read 50 pages but it would feel like 200. And the plot switched between moving too fast and too slow. I will continue with the next book though since I am invested in the characters but I think I will listen to it on audio because reading this book felt like a workout and I don't have that kind of energy.
I picked it up thinking: "This will be quite the fluffy fairytale," but was blown away because it was nothing of the kind.Lets begin with the description: I love that it tells you exactly what The School for Good and Evil is about without giving even an inkling of just how this tale is going to be delivered.
She looks like your typical fairy tale witch but somehow ends up in the School for Good!
Often I feel like some authors treat them just as a way to make the good guy look better or "grow" into that strong character that the reader wants to love.
I'm not sure if this would lean towards YA or middle grade (it did get a bit more violent and complex than what I was expecting), but it's a fun story any age could enjoy!
Basically, there's a school that kidnaps kids and trains them to be villains or heroes in fairy tales.The story reminded me of Storybound, while Sophie and Agatha reminded me a lot of Glinda and Elphaba from Wicked!
But then Agatha (who felt a bit like Wednesday Addams at first) ends up at that school instead, while Sophie finds herself with the villains.
Read This Review & More Like It On My Blog!First of all, if the awesome book trailer for The School of Good and Evil is what created an interest in Chainani's fiction debut, all I can tell you is this: (Even watching that trailer now, after the fact, I am excited and impressed. And then I remember. And then woe.)The book sadly doesn't live up to the awesomeness that advertised it. I'm not even a fan of book trailers, but the promotion department for this book deserves a big raise. The editin
Read This Review & More Like It On My Blog!First of all, if the awesome book trailer for The School of Good and Evil is what created an interest in Chainani's fiction debut, all I can tell you is this:
Soman Chainani creates a vibrant world with two interesting and diverse leads, and I can say they paths and plots he takes them through isn't predictable, though it can be a tad pedantic at times.
The characters are another strong aspect of the novel, and I'm curious to see what will happen after the final events of book one.The School for Good and Evil isn't a bad book by any means.
So, again, I had a feeling about this book. Before even starting it I knew I'd like it, probably even love it. And it proved me right.   "Agatha, you dressed as a bride for Halloween.""Weddings are scary." It's impossible for me to dislike a character after such a statement. From the very first page I was sucked into the magical realm of the School for Good and Evil and it didn't let me go until the very last word. Sophie is a princess at heart. She loves pink, is beautiful, cares for her looks
She loves pink, is beautiful, cares for her looks and Good Deeds and wants nothing more but to be kidnapped and brought to the School.
But when both girls are kidnapped, everything turns out entirely different since Sophie is dropped into the School for Evil and Agatha into the one for Good.
In a way, many dark parts of the book addressed the real-world and showed that the same darkness is as present in our life as in a fairy-tale.
It was impossible for me to not-love this book and I highly recommend it not only to those who love fairy-tales, but to everyone in need of reading something beautiful and hopeful!
"Now I see why you two are friends," the prince says to the main characters Sophie and Agatha.But...
She believes she will find her prince at the School of Good and live "happily ever after." Agatha is the perfect villain for the School of Evil, Sophie thinks, because she is ugly, lonely, and isolated, and Sophie thinks if she's with Agatha her chance of being chosen will be more likely.
They start to come together at the end but I wasn't vested in their development because it took too long.The bag of mixed messages continues with the prince, Tedros, who loves one and then the other meanwhile badmouthing each when dating the other girl.
WOW. That turned into a real roller coaster ride at the end. I'm flabbergasted. Need to start the second book ASAP!
It must be a mistake Sophie is sure she is good, she must meet her Prince, fall in love and get her Happily Ever After.
I loved the friendship between the two girls and how much Agatha really cared for Sophie and just wanted to go back to the village so they could still be friends.The side characters of the evil school were also a lot of fun, as evil characters are.
But no such luck.There were some great classes and challenges that were a good time to read through and I loved the push pull of the friendship between Sophie and Agatha.
"Who needs princes in our fairy tale?"I'm going to kick my past self for never picking up this book when I've wanted to read it for so long. Look at all the fun I missed out on! This was SO good.
[4 Stars] Well that was a whirlwind of an adventure if I ever read one!
It was fun, hilarious at times, gruesome and shocking, and also just action packed and heart wrenching.
I'm still trying to figure out what exactly Chainani is trying to say in this.
I get that the main message is that good and evil are more shades of grey than anything else, and it also emphasizes the importance of friendship.
I did enjoy the setting, characters, and writing though and am looking forward to diving into the next one.
I think Chainani's master plan for the characters and their development will probably become clearer as I read on!
They tried to escape umpteen times.
The Good and Evil sides faced off another umpteen times (but someone would always back down).
I had trouble remembering which of the teachers taught at which school, since they all mingled so freely, and since the girls were perpetually running back and forth, interacting with people from both sides.
But the idea is so very creative, and I really loved Agatha and even Sophie, though at times she was too over-the-top.
I really liked the way it played with the concept of good and evil, of how our intentions can lead us astray.
I LOVE THIS BOOK. SO MUCH. FOREVER AFTER.
This is a magical adventure through and through; the book is set at this School of Good and Evil, a wonderfully imaginative school that trains future fairy tale characters.
Meaning when you graduate, you'll be in a fairy tale book; whether a princess, a villain, a gremlin, or even a tree, your faith will be determined by how well you do at this school.
If this isn't enough to charm you (be difficult, why don't you) check out the delightful illustrations we're treated to at every chapter beginning:Furthermore, the plot has an intriguing mystery element involving the school master and its history which had me entranced.
I was searching for a middle grade book with complicated characters and interesting themes; that is exactly what I found in The School for Good and Evil.
Agatha and Sophie look like a pair that no one would expect, but their bond continually survives all the obstacles thrown at them.
Is it about looking good, looking like you are loving?
Agatha was my favorite character because she viewed the world in the latter way.
Agatha also understood (or came to understand) that the world is not black and white, good and evil.
I also enjoyed the atmospheric writing style.
Overall I enjoyed it a lot.

This book was great, this book takes a unique spin on classic fairy tales and how their viewed.
This is shown well with the two main characters Sophie and Agatha, based on what a classic princess and villain should look like dictates that Sophie "the princess" and Agatha "the villain" but toys with expectations based on appearance.
Something that I really liked about this book is the strong friendship between the two main female characters, also the power of forgiving others even when they don't necessary deserve it.
The ending was fantastic and I cannot wait to continue the series to see where things go next.
Once upon a time, in a land far away…How many times have we seen our dear, precious stories from childhood start that way? How many times have we read about beautiful princesses, tricked by a witch, or a goblin, or other nasty creatures, and eventually saved by the prince and lived a "Happily Ever After"? How many times have we wished for our own fairy tale ending, to have our own prince swoop us up and run off towards the horizon?I, for one, during my early years, wished for that a lot. I sigh
And oh, when the princes appeared, and the knight in shining armour Prince Tedros came out with a "…halo of celestial gold, eye blue as a cloudless sky, skin the color of hot desert sand, he glistened with a noble sheen, as if his blood ran purer than the rest," I imagined this:(Not that he's really like that, mind you… but with all the mockery going on, I couldn't help it!)It became even more priceless in the eyes of Agatha and Sophie, two readers not from the magical, fairytale realm, who were kidnapped from the outside world and taken to this very place for reasons unknown.
****MASSIVE SPOILER ALERT*******okay don't say I didn't warn you***The School for Good and Evil has a great premise: Sophie desperately wants to get out of the tiny village where she lives.
When Sophie attempts to get kidnapped, Agatha tries to save her, and they both end up taken by the School Master.
But then Sophie ends up in the School for Evil, and Agatha ends up in the School for Good.
She is told there are never any mistakes.So, we're going to find in the end that Agatha is really good, and Sophie was only faking being good so she's actually Evil.

This was a super fast and fun read for me.
I really enjoyed a bit of a spin in the fairytale world that we know and the origins of some of the fairy tales by seeing the childhood life they could have led.
I got so invested in Agatha's growth while simultaneously wanting to drop kick Sophie.
So, kudos to the author there!
I cried at the gargoyle and gasped at The Beast!
I wanted to beat up a fictional character at The Ball...if you've read it you know what I mean for all this!
