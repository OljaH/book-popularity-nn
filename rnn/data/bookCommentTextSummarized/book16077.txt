*moment of silence******21/10/18**Re-reading this book ASAP.
I need to remind myself of the reasons I still love it so much.***It's been a while since I've found a book that I find impossible to put down!
The pace was nice and fast, there was always something interesting happening and the characters were cleverly created.
But when you go back, even when you love their writing, you still feel like you'll cringe at the boo-boos because you have their later work to compare to it.I like that Reilly wrote an afterword and explained the process of getting this published, and admitting that he revised it, and what was changed and what wasn't.
While it broke my heart to see the beautiful library and its priceless books destroyed, I’m glad it was just fiction, and in a way, it’s cool to blow up something like that with impunity in a fiction story (I guess).
Do I dareDisturb the universe?– T. S. Eliot  The year is 1996 and The New York Public Library has just become the venue for the seventh Presidian. It is a contest that is held once every thousand years, every time on a different world and the contestants are warriors chosen from each of the seventh worlds that exist. A battle where seven contestants enter the labyrinth and only one leaves. A contest to the death.  Earth is the only world who doesn’t have knowledge about this contest but with ev
Earth is the only world who doesn’t have knowledge about this contest but with every Presidian a human is chosen to enter and none has ever won.
Doctor Stephen Swain is the unlucky seventh contestant chosen and by accident his eight year old daughter is transported with him to the Library where he is forced to fight beings much more alien, stronger and ruthless than him, warriors who have no problem killing in order to be left the last one standing.
Contest is easily the fastest of all my books.
Wow!!! What an exciting book! A contest fought to the death by 7 contestants. 6 are from other worlds, one is an unwitting human. Unfortunately, his 5 year old daughter is with him. (Kid's gonna need some serious therapy) This book is packed with excitement and amazing bravery. Loved it! But, come on! The New York Library? No!! Too sad.
It's fast, frantic, full of aliens and a very neat context that, had it not been written before publication of The Hunger Games, could be looking at an accusation of plagarism.I really enjoyed this book.
Contest is ideal holiday reading and I can see it as a really good transition novel that will keep teenage boys reading on in to adulthood.I will definitely settle down for a thrill ride with Mr Reilly again and I think we all need some books in our lives that makes reading about pure adrenaline kicks that helps to make them cool.
3.5 starsThe premise of the story seemed familiar at the start -  A contest in which to survive you have got to win .Remember some famous book with similar theme?Yes, The Hunger Games. But the thing is that 'Contest' was published in 1996 way before Hunger Games.Also, in this Contest (which takes place every 1000 years), intelligent life forms from 7 different systems or planets (including earth) compete and the winner has to survive the other contestants and a monster known as KARANADON.Fan-Art
I know his daughter was present with him, still as a reader we did not get to see any signs of hidden panic which was weird.....Also, (view spoiler)[ It was really evident throughout the book that somehow Stephen will make it out.
I always find his action packed stories to be a perfect way of ‘changing the pace’ between reading longer and more serious items.
Kind of in the same way I treat Terry Pratchett books.
Although Reilly (or most writers for that matter) is no where near as good a writer as Pratchett!This was Reilly’s first book and is no where near as strong as his other novels but it is still a good read and I’d still recommend it to Reilly fans.
(Yes, a three star book to me is still a good book!).The thing I love most about Reilly’s books is how honest they are.
Part 1 in a four-book review of Matthew Reilly's novels Contest  -> Ice Station -> Temple -> Seven Ancient WondersI like the idea of a good adventure novel so I keep picking things up that I discard 100 pages in, unable to continue with a contrived plot, clichéd characters, bad narrative, or ridiculous events. And Matthew has written a few novels that serve up many, or even all, of these traits. This one, however, I liked. Ok so the plot is contrived - this one tells the story of a cont
-> Ice Station -> Temple -> Seven Ancient WondersI like the idea of a good adventure novel so I keep picking things up that I discard 100 pages in, unable to continue with a contrived plot, clichéd characters, bad narrative, or ridiculous events.
It was later picked up by MacMillan, after the success of Ice Station and Temple.
Matthew's narrative style is still undeveloped in this novel, and not fully formed.
So I thought I pick up his second one, Ice Station, and...
Siete jugadores de diferentes planetas tendrán que enfrentarse en este escenario, donde el doctor Stephen Swain será nuestro representante involuntario, que además está acompañado de su hija pequeña, Holly.
Pero, ¿qué podrá hacer un humano contra seres extraterrestres, auténticos cazadores?‘El laberinto’ (Contest, 1996), del australiano Matthew Reilly, es una muy buena de aventuras y ciencia ficción, muy visual, con frases cortas y que va al grano, algo de agradecer en un best seller que no pretende otra cosa que entretener y divertir.
El planteamiento no es muy original, un juego donde solo puede quedar uno (Battle Royal, Los Juegos del Hambre), pero Reilly sabe dotarle de frescura.
Wow amazing! This was my first Reilly book and I LOVED it! I read the entire book in just a couple hours I was so engrossed! Ever since I read Preston & Child's individual and collaborative books Ive been looking for an author that writes similar to their style & havent yet found one until Reilly. So Im excited I cant wait to read the rest of his works!
oh my god, this sounds bananas!! i must have it.
Great action novel! It deserves a movie :) I remember that I was so excited while reading it, that I couldn't force myself to leave the book and read it whole.
Супер книжка. Непрекъснато напрегнати действия, яко екшън, щипка хумор и много, много фантазия. Харесвам такива книги.
I noticed this book because of the picture of The New York Public Library on the cover, and thought "Hey, I work there....what's this about?"Well, let me just set the stage for you....Contest is about an intergalactic competition that takes place once every millenia in which the seven intelligent alien races (a list humans have only recently and reluctantly been added) are teleported into a labyrinth in which they must compete in a battle royale, fighting each other to the death until the final contestant remains and is declared the victor.
One night, whilst holding his daughter, Swain is teleported into the Library whereupon he discovers that he has been selected as the Earth “human” representative of the contest, in which he fights to the death or just dies anyway.
And, whilst you can guess, you’re not entirely sure if Swain and his daughter will make it out together and alive – because this really is an action book; Reilly doesn’t care about being all sentimental and making his characters indestructible, he kills whoever he feels like – and there were some deaths I didn’t expect.
I just loved Holly’s character so much, and as I said, I really think that she makes this novel.ViolenceThis is a very violent book.
Dr. Stephen Swain and his daughter Holly are teleported into the NY Public Library, which has been sealed by an massive electric field, along with a guide named Selexin. Selexin explains that Swain is the sole human in mortal combat with extraterrestrials, and the rules of the Presidian competition. (Holly's presence was only an accident because she was too close to Swain when he was snatched.) Brutal, violent, fast-paced action, with ineffective, secret U.S. governmental interference. Swain's creativity and cool demeanor under pressure is impressive. This was Australian author Reilly's first book, which was originally self-published.
The science-fiction theme is very striking, mixed with the subtle story of a father who loves his daughter and lost his wife in an accident.
He used simple words, unlike Dan Brown who also writes sci-fi-action theme and makes me read with the dictionary beside my bed.
He put the right story in the right part, so we don't wanna miss any actions.
I still have 200pages to go, and you won't let him die now."Gonna read some more of Reilly's Stuff!!
Ciencia Ficción pura, a pesar de que la editorial no haya querido tirar por esto.Un grupo de personajes encerrados en la biblioteca son obligados a llegar a un punto.
Por cierto, los competidores no son todos humanos, y esto no es spoiler.Tiene escenas muy buenas estilo Alien, de ellos corriendo por pasillos y escondiéndose en zonas.
Pero son unas pocas páginas tan solo, es una pena.
Pero con lo corto que es, no es tan rápido como debería haberlo sido para el pleno, y se pierde en diálogos de quien la tiene más grandes.
OHH MY GODI SWORE that I wont read any more Reilly books while commuting in public transport.I act like a MIME artist in a crowded train, while reading his never ending, relentless, freight-train of writing.... I mean how many times am I gonna chew my nails to mere stubs forgetting that I got my manicure done the previous evening???Contest, being his FIRST novel, is relatively naive on some accounts. But its speedy. He's gotten better with each of his book.... and I cant wait to get my hands on "Five Greatest Warriors"
One of my all-time favorite books. The setting of this book was just ideal and the author mixed in just enough "weird" but did it in such a way as to make everything totally believable. New York Public Library, aliens and a kill-or-be-killed contest...doesn't get any better than this.
the sickest, this book is a boss
Once you started this book you can't put it aside until you have finished it.
I really enjoyed reading this book as I visited the New York Public Library last December during a charity event I was attending.
The building is a wonderful site to set an adventure thriller story in and Matthew Reilly has taken advantage of that.
This story has it all - aliens, monsters, adventure, mystery and very unique characters.
This is an excellent debut novel and makes you want to read more from this talented author.
I do look forward to reading some other novels by Reilly and I would highly recommend this book to those who love adventure thrillers.4.5 rating
The NSA sub-plot seemd to have very little purpose, and I am sure the author was visualising his movie on screen as he wrote the prologue - pointless.I never became attached to any of the characters.
Presumably the author thought it sounded like a good round number, without bothering to consider the differing length of a year on other planets.
It bothers me when the author admits in his note to leaving out descriptions of several aliens in the self-published version of the book because he could not think of any.
I could go on forever about the bad characterizations,and how the most insignificant occurrences are focused on to draw out elaborate deductions.And that's one of the main problems: Everything is explained to you up front as though you were reading a menu, instead of letting the main character figure things out along the way and giving you some mystery and keeping you more interested in turning the pages.
Yeah, we got it...7 men enter 1 man leaves, but you're so called hero who was picked for his superior intelligence can't get it until the 3rd time it's said.
Seven players, each from a different world, compete for their lives in something called the Presidian.
Because of it reaches 0, you are pretty much up crap's hill without a paddle.The setting is, of all places, the New York Public Library!
If you live or work around NYC, you know this library has been the setting of various books and movies.
It's an awesome place to visit, not unlike the Library of Congress.This is a no holds barred, action packed, teeth grinding, non stop action novel that will keep you glued to the book.
He's put a new twist on the 'fight to the death between random contestants who can't escape from the maze unless they are the last man standing' plot.
- The 'coincidental' actions that lead to actions or thoughts or 'keys' that the characters need was just too pat in a few cases.I did like this book; however, there were some glaring plot points that yanked me out of the story and reminded me that I've read this plot before.
A man and his daughter are drawn into a battle to the death called the Presidium.
Human’s are the only representatives not aware of this ongoing “contest” and are the only species drawn into the event without consent.
Of course, no human has ever won.
Enter Dr. Steven Swain and his daughter (via teleportation of course) and the contest is on.
It is his first novel (originally self published), so a little less intense than the Jack West series.
The style of this book also seems to foreshadow some of the author’s favourite elements used in the Jack West series.

Un libro interesante. Es una aventura que destaca la inteligencia sobre la fuerza para sobrellevar diferentes situaciones. El hecho de que la trama se desarrolle en una biblioteca fue lo que me atrajo para elegirlo. Recomiendo este libro si te gustan las aventuras y los seres de otro planeta. Para los lectores de Buenos Aires: conseguí el ejemplar en las librerías de usados sobre Avenida Corrientes. Si lo leen me cuentan que les pareció :)
