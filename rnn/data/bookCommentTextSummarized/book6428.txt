I do… and I am happy to say that the Cambridge Professor, ATH Smith, has produced the very best effort for a new edition after an absence of 20 years.
Much of the original text survives but Professor Smith has given much needed emphasis to the new legal agenda of the early twenty-first century – gone are the old, archaic references – and in come new, thrusting European Union law provisions which will warm the heart of the most die-hard Eurosceptic.
Thank you, Professor Smith, for bridging the gap after some twenty years.
Like almost every LLB student in England or Wales, I originally started this as preliminary reading for accelerated LLB at Birkback that I'll be starting in the Fall.
Wow, there is good reason this book is on the prelim reading lists for nearly every LLB programme in the country.
It covers just about every aspect of preparing for the law from an overview of the English Legal system, to the foundations of legal research, to best exam practices, to landing the ideal job.
Extremely detailed with extensive further reading lists, I have a feeling this book is going to be getting quite the workout over the next couple of years!
The first few chapters were about Law itself and they were really badly structured and unhelpful for a fresher as legal vocab was thrown around with no definitions to follow up, and sometimes two related terms were mentioned and only one was explained..... Later chapters about the learning of the law were better, I guess because they relied on the reader's common sense rather than erudition.
read this whole book for my first term in college.. yes, I'm taking law here okay go ballistic hahaha this book provides all information for starters like me and it made me fall in love with law even more
