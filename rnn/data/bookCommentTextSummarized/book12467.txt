I am in awe.
This might be the best book I've read this year.
It might be one of the best books I've ever read.If you like epics, this is for you.
It's all here.This book was what makes fantasy great.
It is what makes historical fiction great.
The reader is constantly on the edge of his/her seat, and the payoff is in spades.I loved Tigana, my first experience with Kay, when I read it last year.
I will say there was only one thing I didn't like about this book: that the experience had to end.......
The ineptitude I find myself in, is because this is the forth book written by Kay I have read in the last couple of months and with each volume I become more and more enamored with his way of balancing Historical Fiction, some Fantasy elements, Romance, and Artistic expression in a hybrid which could not be put into a box, but feels like each of its parent's genres most favorite child.
He loved it with a heart that ached like an old man's fingers in rain, hurting for the Gorhaut of his own vision, a land worthy of the god who had chosen it, and of the honor of men.
Artisans, it seems, are very important for Kay. Tigana had musicians, Sarantine duology a mosaicist as the main protagonist, in Arbonne, fashioned after the medieval Provence and Occitania, troubadours are in the middle of things (along with joglars and trobairitz, that is female performers).
Beatrice wasn't Dante’s lover, not even his friend or merely an acquaintance and yet, against those odds she was the ultimate love of his life (as you know if you have read his poetry).
Insert rant about the many reasons why I really like a lot of Kay's early work here.
4.6 starsThis is as well written as any Kay's book. Reason it isn't getting full 5 stars is because I didn't like characters as much as I did in Sarantine mosaic or Tigana.
Well I hate to do this but listening to this audio book is just putting me to sleep. I’m really enjoying the book & this narrator is great (especially his singing voice) but it’s such a sweet voice that it lulls me right into a doze. I don’t want to keep reading if I’m only catching 50% of the story so I’ll definitely put this on my Physical TBR list & revisit it in the future! 💛
Guy Gavriel Kay molds characters from ideas and a splash of his imagination, shapes them with delicate letters and beautiful words, and then he breathes life into them with his pen.
And then he invites you to go through this journey, this rich experience he created, and when you do, you struggle with the various characters and feel for them, you taste the wind that blows through their homes and shapes their lives, you smell the firewoods that enliven their hearths, you hear the music they dance to and the poetry they extract from their hearts, and you realize that this is something rare and ingenious and beautiful.
4.5 stars
My fourth book by GGK and once again I liked the the world, story and the characters created by him.
Arbonne a land famous for its troubadours which is ruled by a woman and worship a goddess.
The world that he has portrayed in this book is beautiful, unforgettable and very resonant.
A man whose hatred inspired him to end a country because they worship a Goddess and respect women did not settled well with me.
My most favorite character in this book was Rosala.
Her courage when she faced the most feared man in country was truly awesome.
Gorhaut: Northern, harsh, god-worshipping, and ruled by a cruel and twisted king.
Blaise de Garsenc has a foot in both lands: A younger-son noble of Gorhaut, he has come to Arbonne to work as a mercenary coran.
As the two countries come closer to war with one another, he begins to recognize a disturbing parallel between them.
(This is partly why the few reviews I've managed to write lately are so short and unspirited: my heart just isn't in them right now.) I'd put the balance of this story more on "comforting" at this time; I'm glad this book called to me now.
Pure poetry. A tale of undiluted love on both an epic and a personal scale. A tale of pride, regret and music. Of courtly love and the hard game of nations. Of family, hatred, war and betrayal. Of ambition and endless longing. Of the timeless seasons of one’s own homeland. A tale of men and women.Kay works his magic with emphatic brilliance and exquisite execution, regaling us with a thought-provoking story of beauty and suspense.There were ripples to events, and they went a long way sometimes across the dark pools of time and the world.
It's a great story - intrigue, war, love, mystery, politics, tension, regret, impending doom, death, surprises, clear good guys, clear bad guys, and some you aren't sure about.
So you get "Galbert scowls and walks out of the room" instead of "Galbert scowled and walked out of the room." It's strange to read the present tense in a story to start with, and the abrupt transition between tenses makes you stumble, un-immersing you temporarily each time.One thing that bothered me that might not bother others is the songs.
Luckily there aren't more than a few songs in this book, but they're real stinkers, and we're supposed to get all wistful about them.
I do love most of Kay's work when I'm in the right mood, though, and A Song for Arbonne is additionally up my street because of the Court of Love, the troubadours, all the stuff that's part of the Arthurian legends as well once they hit France.I don't think, though, that I fell for this book quite as much as I have for some of the others.
Not quite the story Kay was aiming to tell, I think.Still, all of that sounds harsh, when I really do enjoy this book.
He also doesn’t have much hope that Arbonne – which values singers over soldiers, and troubadours over troops – will put up much of a fight if Gorhaut decides to try to eradicate Arbonne’s goddess worship.
But Blaise and I learned that when their lives and lifestyle are threatened, the passionate people of Arbonne respond.Much of the novel’s background information is delivered by several characters’ emotional interior monologues, a technique I like when it’s not overdone to the point that it really slows the action.
It was nearly over-the-top in A Song for Arbonne, but I liked Blaise so much that it worked for me when we were in his head.
Υπέροχο φαντασιακό μυθιστόρημα του Kay (νομίζω ότι διαδραματίζεται στο ίδιο σύμπαν με την Τιγκάνα, αλλά δεν είμαι σίγουρη). Έξτρα πόντοι για το βαθύτατα φιλογυνιστικό (ως αντίθετο του μισογυνιστικού) μήνυμά του.
This story centers around Gorhaut, a God-worshipping, male dominated nation that recently went through an upheaval in leadership, and Arbonne, it's neighbor.
Arbonne is a Goddess worshipping nation in which troubadours are greatly admired and women hold positions of power.
Blaise of Gorhaut is currently serving in Arbonne, although the reasons behind this are not revealed until well into the book.
I think that at the heart of this story is a study of the nature of women and men - what makes us strong, and what can make us fanatical and oppressive to each other.
Lyrical prose; developed characters; but not enough happening! Not enough wonder or plot; it's more like a Historical epic; I never liked any of his characters and he meanders too much on the prose for my tastes; a lot of people love him though; if you loved LOTR then you may very well like this one . . . while I can appreciate his style, he isn't for me; if his pacing was faster, there would have been promise.
Superb in all aspects. A literary gem!
A Song For Arbonne is a lyrical portrayal of one tumultuous year in Arbonne, as its peace-loving people — aristocracy, mercenaries, troubadours, priests and priestesses — deal with the threat of invasion from their war-hungry neighbors to the north.Much to my astonishment, some folks don’t enjoy the works of Guy Kay as much as I do.
A Song For Arbonne is set in an other-world analog of medieval Languedoc and Provence.
This is transferred into A Song For Arbonne without significant modification.The other important development in Languedoc/Provence was a divergent theology.
Buddy Read with the Kay Squad at FBR.
I had not read Kay before, but the cover intrigued me.Inconveniently (it was finals time) I couldn't put the book down.
Great main character, a really loathsome bad guy (almost too loathsome for my tastes), and an obvious love for the Middle Ages that I found extremely refreshing.
The female characters, however, were probably the best part of this book.
But best of all is his ability to develop truly strong women characters without resorting to "female breastplates" (those who read the hilarious i09.com article on this will know what I mean), which are all too common today.
Que livro!!Se Tigana tinha sido uma experiência muito boa com o autor, A Song for Arbonne cravou o nome de Guy Gavriel Kay naquela lista de "Autores que eu preciso ler absolutamente TUDO que eles publicaram na vida!" .O livro como um todo foi emocionante, os personagens são muito marcantes, apesar de talvez no inicio ser possível ficar meio perdido, quando você se familiariza com todos, a história flui de uma forma muito gostosa.
Até os vilões, que são totalmente odiáveis, no final você fica "Como ele conseguiu fazer isso tudo??".
This is a generous five stars, to be honest. It is based on the prose and the characters and the worldbuilding. The plot itself isn't much, and should bring the book to four stars, but I can't bring myself to do so, because the writing was so beautifully crafted. I love GGK's rhythm and word choice, and his ability to evoke a feeling with just a sentence. Stunning.
Guy Gavriel Kay has the kind of prose that makes me want to bury myself and cry because I'll never be able to write like him.
Guy Gavriel Kay writes something I wouldn't call fantasy but more alternative history.
He takes a place (here it's the lovely Provence) then does his research and sets a story in an alternative version of it.
And I wasn't happy with the resolution at the end, but maybe that was just me.Definitely a must read for all GGK fans.
If you haven't read any of his work yet, I suggest you start with The Lions of Al-Rassan.
An enchanting, highly recommended historical fantasy that pulled me into the world of Provence, land of 'courts of love' and of troubadours, and other kingdoms or dukedoms of medieval France, with Kay using each civilization as a basis for his fantasy concept of these places.
The story begins and ends with excerpts from the written 'vidans' or lives of two of Arbonne's most famous troubadours: "the first and perhaps most famous", Anselme of Cauvas and ending with that of Lisseut of Vezét, the latter a main character in the novel.
This was my first exposure to Kay's work, and I've to say that I've already fallen in love with his writing.
In A Song for Arbonne, he created a dazzling and extraordinary tale of mere mortals, whose life were entangled by malevolence, political intrigue and love.
From this overtly distinct mix, Kay managed to weave such a convoluted story that acquire a life of its own.
If you are among those who enjoy historical fiction, sprinkled with a little bit of magical element, I dare say that reading Kay's A Song for Arbonne is a definite must.
STOP THE PRESSES! THIS MIGHT BE MY NEW FAVORITE GUY GAVRIEL KAY NOVEL!I NEED SOME TIME ALONE.
I give that qualifier because there are more Kay books to read and with every story he manages to enthrall me all over again.
Bordered on the north by Gorhaut, Arbonne soon finds itself threatened by both political machinations in that country as well as by long-running schisms within its own borders.Kay weaves a masterful story, told with elegant and moving prose, that touches upon the hurts and betrayals inflicted upon the largest of political stages as well as the potentially more damaging ones borne on far more personal fronts.
However, seeing that GGK Sacrifices so many things in his book to focus on certain aspects, aspects which set him apart from other writers of the genre it is quite fair to point out that the sacrifice in this case was a bad trade.
In this case, there is not a single character I grew to like nor was there any emotion that the sacrifice of plot, action, humour and fast pace should have bought.
(Mind you, this is after claiming women are coinage, to be traded for political gains)Lastly, the villains in GGK's books are often shades of grey.
Just when he has me rolling my eyes and looking for something more meaty to read, he smacked me in the face with a mailed fist at the start of Chapter 3 and said “Pay attention buddy, there is a real story here!” And there was a good story and some mighty fine writing.Le Plot:Blaise, a mercenary of some skill, has traveled a number of countries and has found himself in Arbonne, a “Frenchified” country ruled by the Countess of Arbonne and generally by women.
Bertran has a a long running feud with his neighboring noble, Urte, which will infect much of the story.
