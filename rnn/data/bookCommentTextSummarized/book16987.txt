The man writes a book and you read it.
He knows how to write a mother-fucking story.
James Patterson's books come automatically equipped with small chapters.Enjoy reading before bed?
This shit has you on the edge of your seat.
You'll be speaking nothing but eloquence when you're done reading a James Patterson book.
These bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks.
That means someone's getting jacked the fuck up.If you like reading, getting smacked in the face with plot twists and actually relating to characters in a book, check out my dog James Patterson.
This book is a great intro to his writing.
I am embarrassed to say that this is the first James Patterson book I have read (excluding his book shot series).Although I was unfamiliar with his work- I think everyone who likes fiction has heard of Alex Cross.He was one of many standout characters in this novel.
Alex Cross, detective, doctor of psychology, hypnotiser, friends of the poor people when he helps out at a food shelter, respected by the black people for never leaving the 'hood following his glittering career, great family man and a bit of genius who cannot give up a case.
This is the first book I've read in the Alex Cross series and it won't certainly be the last.
James Patterson is a fabulous author as I'm sure many would agree and when it comes to writing a page turner he sure knows how to keep the reader turning the pages at a fast pace.
Along Came A Spider is a book with the lot, mystery, crime, suspense, oh and did I mention it's a cracking thriller.
I can't wait to get my hands on the next book in this series.
If you haven't read this book then do yourself a favor and please go and read it.
I'm very sure you won't be disappointed.
The boy's body is found and the kidnapper demands that Detective Alex Cross be the one to deliver the $10M ransom.
The money is taken, but the girl is not returned and Alex joins forces with Jezzie Flanagan, the supervisor of the Secret Service, to find the kidnapper.*** I had some real problems with this book.
There were hints of the mastermind fairly early in the story, the kidnapper was stereotypically evil and the very ending was unrealistic.
The story did move well for about the first half, and then I found myself getting bored.
I have been recommending this book for years.
But the first book of the Alex Cross series is still an amazing read.
What really made this book work for me was the antagonist, Gary Soneji.
The game of cat-and-mouse between Alex Cross and Gary Soneji is gripping and exciting.However, the book is not perfect…I did have to deduct a star, as I really didn’t enjoy the portrayal of Secret Service agent Jezzie Flanagan…I found her to be a grating character, and wished the time Patterson spent on her could have been used for any of the other more-interesting characters.
It was a few years back that I read Along Came The Spider. I found the plot is predictable just like those typical Hollywood thriller movies. I could not find the book much engrossing, and was rather disappointed by the climax which was a cliched twist, and ruins whatever was, if any, good in the plot before. It was only the psychopathic villain, Gary Soneji, that appealed to me. Whereas Alex Cross, the detective, was very boring. All in all, it was a below average read which I would not recommend.
ALONG CAME a SPIDER (Alex Cross, #1) is the classic thriller that launched the Alex Cross series, the #1 detective series of the past twenty-five years! Excellent book. full of action and a ending I never saw coming! This novel is a game of cat-and-mouse between Detective Alex Cross and psychopathic villain,Gary Soneji, and will have you flipping the pages to see what will happen next.
James Patterson started his best-selling Alex Cross series in 1993 with Along Came a Spider.
PBS included the Alex Cross mysteries on its list of 100 books and series for The Great American Read.
This prompted me to check out an audiobook of the first Alex Cross book and take a listen.
Alex Cross is a metro detective in Washington, D.C. He's raising his two kids with the help of his grandmother who he affectionately calls Nana Mama.
I'm a bit late on the scene....but I'm definitely going to read more of this series, and other books by Patterson.
Wow, where do I begin?
IF YOU ENJOYED THIS BOOK OR THE ALEX CROSS SERIES, PLEASE DON'T CONTINUE!!Some major points include:  * Alex Cross is an incredibly boring, cliché, slightly-racist, unrealistic character * The italicization of random words without regards to taste or context * Incredible off-putting love scenes  * Boring, repetitive text, and dull, awkward dialog  * So many 90's references and dialog, even Kevin Costner from Bodyguard finds it painful to read  * Plot holes you could drive a truck through I bought the entire Alex Cross series at a book sale for about 13 dollars.
James Patterson outsells Pulitzer-Prize winning authors, but his writing (I refuse to call this bullshit "prose") is barely one step above motherfucking picture books.
Why, motherfuckers, why?There is a difference between having an opinion and being fucking wrong.
Bad Guys:JezzieDevineChakelyGary SonejiGood Guys:Alex Crossand Alex's partner Sampson, who's actually only in about a fifth of the book.Moving on...While the three cray-cray secret service motherfuckers are hiding out, trying to pretend they didn't have shit to do with shit (two of these idiots quit right after the kids were kidnapped, and the last one quit a few months later, as if that ALONE wouldn't make them look guilty...
This book had a very interesting plot and a decent cover. That's about it. What a major disappointment this was. I guess it goes to show you just how good an actor Morgan Freeman is. Hell, he drove Ms. Daisy around for two hours and made it seem fun, and he made the movie version of this very watchable. Sadly, he was not around to act out the novel for me. By the way, the cover isn't really that cool, I was just being polite.
5 star.🇺🇸🦋
So interesting! I haven't seen the movie so this whole plot and the characters were new to me. I found it very entertaining with some great twists! Now that I am done the Women's Murder Club I am trying to decide between Patterson's other series to read now. Really thinking this is the one I will read first! My quick and simple overall: psychology and criminal justice is so it for me! My two majors in undergrad and graduate school!
I mean, if you want to read a story with unbelievably cringe-worthy romance lines, pointless and unnecessary racism and a script that only added to the unrealisticness of the characters, then by all means, throw your money away on this book.The beginning kept me going for a while because I thought it had a pretty decent storyline (probably the only good point about this book), but then came the middle, where almost nothing even remotely interesting or necessary happened.
If you ask me, Patterson should stick to writing crime and leave all elements of romance out of it; half the book was filled with it.
This was probably the most I was engaged into a mystery/thriller/suspense book since I read A Cold Day In Paradise by Steve Hamilton which got me into the genre.
I finished this book in about 2 days with maybe 4 hours of reading combined and it kept me interested the whole way.
The twist sadly didn't work on me because I saw the movie about 2 weeks before I picked up the book but it still kept me interested the whole way by making me juggle between characters.
Good book, recommend it to anyone who is a fan of the crime/mystery/thriller genre.
They're both everyday average normal guys.Oh yeah, and James Patterson is super cute because he's a white dude trying so hard to write a black detective, and it's not even offensive it's just like, you can tell he's trying so hard and doing his best but it's just kind of a bumbling effort, like bro just relax about it it's okay you don't have to remind your audience 800 times that Det Cross is a black dude we get it, it's totally fine.And I can't really hate on Patterson even IF this was a rage-inducing shit book because he promotes reading so hard for young people and has written several books for children and just seems like a really enthusiastic dude who is super into literacy.Anyhow if you want the mystery/crime/thriller novel equivalent to a bad Nic Cage movie, read this shit.
I have read a few Alex Cross books now and decided it was time I read the very first one to see how it all began. I am very glad I did because I found this to be an excellent book. It has a fast paced and exciting story which has the reader guessing from the first page and then it ends with quite a remarkable twist which I did not see coming. I sat up very late finishing it because I just could not put it down! Altogether a really good read.
I was kept in suspense for most of it. I was disappointed that Alex was hoodwinked so easily, considering how professional he is supposed to be! It’s my first James Patterson and it may not be my last. I prefer Jeffrey Deaver to be honest
Watched the film ages ago, before reading the book. Initially I was quite shocked at how much the film differed from the book. Then I wondered why they changed it for the film. The book had a much better storyline, deeper and more complex characters and it would have translated well into a film.As is often the case, the book was better than the film. 5 stars without a doubt.
Φοβερά καλογραμμένο αστυνομικό μυθιστόρημα με μεγάλη έμφαση στην ανθρώπινη ψυχολογία και συμπεριφορά. Δεν είναι καθόλου τυχαίο που ο Patterson φιγουράρει μόνιμα στην κορυφή των best sellers. Συμπαθώ πολύ και τον Άλεξ Κρος (κι ας είναι αρκετά κλισέ ώρες ώρες). Αυτή είναι η πρώτη του περιπέτεια.
Really 3.5 I figured out very early one of the antagonists so there's thatBut for a first exposure to Patterson I'm pleased. I will read the rest of the series
Ποιος απήγαγε τα παιδιά και γιατί; Πώς πέθανε το αγοράκι; Ποιος κρύβεται πίσω από αυτές τις υποθέσεις και πώς συνδέεται με την απαγωγή του διάσημου αεροπόρου Τσαρλς Λίντμπεργκ το 1932;Αυτή είναι η πρώτη υπόθεση του διάσημου ντετέκτιβ του James Patterson, Άλεξ Κρος που έχει φανατικούς αναγνώστες ενώ τα βιβλία του μέχρι στιγμής είναι 25 (το 26ο αναμένεται να κυκλοφορήσει μέσα στον χρόνο).
Το βιβλίο «…και ήρθε μια αράχνη» είναι η πρώτη περιπέτεια με τον Άλεξ Κρος, αφορά τη σύλληψη και την καταδίκη ενός απαγωγέα με διχασμένη προσωπικότητα ενώ ταυτόχρονα η αναπάντεχη εξαφάνιση της απαχθείσας κόρης του Υπουργού Οικονομικών δίνει μια άλλη διάσταση στην πλοκή.
He writes a similar genre, but he makes me smile, either at the intriguing characters, or the “wow that is so exciting” when being chased or trapped or wondering if the hero will survive.At times I felt impatient to get some answers.
I’ve read other police procedural mysteries that had me less impatient and enjoying the journey more.The narrator Charles Turner was fine, but I wish Morgan Freeman had narrated.
The character Alex Cross is a black man from the south.
Morgan played Alex in the movie, and I kept thinking about him.
Swearing language: strong.
👌 Along Came a Spider starts with the twofold capturing of the girl of a well known Hollywood on-screen character and the youthful child of the secretary of the Treasury.
Jezzie Flanagan is the female administrator of the Secret Service who finishes a standout amongst the most bizarre tension triangles in any thriller you have ever perused."What do you talk about to a murderer, and someone you loved, over a perfect dinner and cocktails?
Instead, we talked of the coming vacation days, a "plan" for the here and now in the islands.” ― Along Came a Spider
Audiobook. Narrated by Charles Turner.
Books such as as Along Came a Spider by James Patterson.Now, I know that popular fiction is popular for a reason.
Along Came a Spider was the first book to become available.This book was actually a really great read.
I do admit, I started to pick up on the plot twist pretty early on.James Patterson wrote an engaging crime novel that keeps the reader questioning.
James Patterson clearly demonstrates that he can write a good story, but when he is able to question the reader's complicity, then I realize that I have read a good book.
Not only was it a book which held my attention during the ten plus hours drive but I enjoyed Alex Cross the main character and figured I'd see if there were others in this series.
It seems I'm not the only one who wanted more of Alex Cross as James Patterson has delivered almost one book each year for the past 25 years.
Though I don't necessarily think I'm keen enough to read the entire series I could definitely see myself listening to, or reading more in future.This was a story with a number of twists and turns, plenty of action, more than it's share of psychopaths, some violence but nothing too graphic, kidnappers, murders, and even a hint of romance.
Still remains the best James Patterson book I've read to date- even tops the Maximum Ride series. It's exciting, and absolutely terrifying. I honestly had trouble sleeping for a week after reading this. Very powerful storytelling.
Not as good as I assumed from its claims to creativity and excitement, but it was entertaining for the most part and a half-decent detective novel with likeable characters and a good plot.
What a dissapoinmentHow can somebody can write a book so boring, after this book I will never choose any Patterson work again
