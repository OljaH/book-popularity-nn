City of Illusions by Ursula K.
Le Guin is a part of her Hainish cycle of books.
This work involves an alien traveler who has arrived in a forest region of what was once the eastern United States with amnesia.
His journey across the continent allows Le Guin to describe a dystopian landscape that could compliment the future as described by Walter M.
The book is highlighted by Le Guin’s remarkable imagination and her sparse but descriptive prose.
The subject matter lags some and her vision is sometimes difficult to follow but for a fan of Le Guin this is a good read.
He's taken in and taught by a small group of humans, who teach him their language and give him the name of Falk, but eventually he is encouraged to leave and go find out who he really is.And so a dangerous, cross-country journey begins.
Earth is sparsely populated by humans who live very simply, reportedly enforced by a conquering group (the Shing) from another planet.
I also had fun trying to parse out where exactly Falk was in his travels through what used to be the United States, based on clues like "Mzurra" and "Arksa" and "Inland River." (Kansas, for whatever reason, has proudly hung onto its name.)More to come.
It seems telling that LeGuin's standard character psychology of an emotionally stunted paranoid works best in a story about a complete amnesiac lost in a post-apocalyptic world of deadly dangers, but kudos to her for writing to suit her habits; it's a trick more writers should use.The dystopian aspect comes on rather suddenly and completely changes the tone of the story, almost as if each half were a separate short piece loosely connected, except that the first half does not have a conclusion without the second to cap it.
I was unexpectedly reminded of Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?, in which Dick explores ideas of empathy and relationships with animals in a more completely industrialised future and weaves these into a religion; there's something irresistibly fabular about a talking pig.
The pig's words are the single law of the 'Shing', deceivers who hold the Earth's drastically reduced population in thrall through their lies and technology and mind science.
It is a shopping mall designed by Gaudi perhaps: gaudy, sumptuous, unwholesome in its sterile decadence.Zove was right that Falk was an intelligent man before his mind was 'razed'.
The idea of a race that changes sexes (The Left Hand of Darkness) or the ansible (an instantaneous communication device over stellar distances) are creative, but the stories are fairly boring & rather superficial in most other respects.The truth will set Falk free, honesty will always win out, & men are supposed to be diverse & free to reach their full potential.
(hide spoiler)]On the plus side, their treatment of Orry is very well done, a far better & more subtle way of showing their true colors.
Interesanta.Multe descrieri de locuri, de personaje, de ginduri.Cartea este compusa din 3 povesti care se leaga pe o durata de citeva mii de ani.Are ceva actiune, te pune pe ginduri, te face sa cauti diverse scenarii.E ok.
A man wanders out of the forest with a severe case of amnesia.
When he has learned all he can from them, he must set out across the vast continent toward the city of Es Toch, hopefully to figure out where he came from, why he is there and what happened to his memory.
Three quarters of the book tells of this man’s journey to Es Toch, and as such is a sort of average questing tale with friends and foes along the way.
The ultimate answer he seeks is quite the interesting revelation, as is also what happens after he figures this out.
Se jugaba entero a esta creencia: que un hombre honesto no puede ser engañado, que la verdad, si el juego se jugaba hasta las últimas consecuencias conduciría a la verdad. Un hombre con los ojos amarillos con pupilas semejantes a un gato sale del Bosque sin memoria, una comunidad lo cuida, le enseña su lengua, y después de unos años Falk-como le han llamado- decide ir en busca de respuestas y quienes probablemente le dejaron asi: los Shing.Durante su jornada se muestra una Tierra post-apocalipt
Un hombre con los ojos amarillos con pupilas semejantes a un gato sale del Bosque sin memoria, una comunidad lo cuida, le enseña su lengua, y después de unos años Falk-como le han llamado- decide ir en busca de respuestas y quienes probablemente le dejaron asi: los Shing.Durante su jornada se muestra una Tierra post-apocaliptica de comunidades muy cerradas en Casas que no son más que clanes xenófobos, y tribus bárbaras supersticiosas dedicadas a la caza y hasta canibales.
Mientras animales parlantes dicen una sola cosa: 'Respeta la Vida'.Como hombre sin memoria, se ve constantemente en duda acerca de quien dice la verdad, quien conoce de verdad lo que pasó.
Właściwie to mocne 4,5. Ta książka zostawiła mnie z potężnym uczuciem pozytywnego niedosytu i bardzo chciałbym wiedzieć "co było dalej". Ba, bardzo mnie zafascynowało to, jaka kultura rozwinęła się na Werel po "Planecie wygnania". Naprawdę polubiłam głownego bohatera. I nie wiem czemu, ale Dom Zove bardzo kojarzy mi się z Rivendel.
Oldukça sürükleyici, her seferinde beklediğimi aldığım, alıştığım LeGuin tarzı bir hikaye daha. Werelli Ramarrenin Dünyalı Falka dönüşümü ve sonunda Falk-Ramarren olarak Werele dönüşü. Sıkılmadan okudum.
He stumbles into the clearing of the House of Zove, and we cannot appreciate his luck until we encounter with him much less savory remnants of humanity later in the story.
Zove dismisses him from the house, sending him west to the Es Toch, the fabled city of the Shing, the Enemy who now hold dominion over Earth.
Falk suspects that the Shing have mastered mind lying.This is a novel about power and what people, or aliens, are willing to do to acquire it and hang desperately onto it, whether they control a clearing in the forest or an entire planet.
Le Guin is a master at taking a workaday story of a protagonist suffering from acute amnesia (sound familiar?) and turning it into a focused think-piece on self awareness and discovery of who we really are.
So if we have all the memory of our old self removed, and we are told by a third person about the individual that we used to be (and that "person" sounds like someone we wouldn't necessarily like) - how do we know who we really are, anyway?
So I suggest reading this short book, enjoy where Le Guin takes you on the introspection, and then watch this old-school video and remember where your old self was when you watched it for the first time:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP8Pe8...
A decent book. Great imagination of imagery, surroundings and ideas; loved this part the most. Liked the first half more than the other. Bleak dystopian landscape. Various factions of Terrans displaying different expert abilities, was nice. Interesting ideas, like Mindspeech, Talking animals (a slightly disturbing idea), lying and mind-lies, etc. Overall story was okay/good. The journey of the Quest was interesting. Perhaps not amongst one of Le Guin's finest books.A one-time-read certainly recommended. :)
" στα χρόνια που ταξίδευαν ανάμεσα στα αστέρια,ποιος ήταν ο ονειρευόμενος και πιο το όνειρο?"Πολύ μου άρεσε το βιβλίο αυτό. Οι περιγραφές της Le Guin τόσο πλούσιες και περίτεχνες που με βάλανε εντελώς μέσα στο βιβλίο. Δηλαδή πραγματικά, έβλεπα τα κίτρινα γατίσια μάτια του Φαλκ να με ακολουθούν παντού και νόμιζα πως όλοι μου λέγανε ψέματα.Τι είναι ψευδαίσθηση τελικά αν όχι η παρερμήνευση της πραγματικότητας? Συνιστώ ανεπιφύλακτα.Υ.Γ: ΑΛΛΟ ΕΝΑ ΕΥΣΤΟΧΑ ΕΠΙΛΕΓΜΕΝΟ ΒΙΒΛΙΟ ΤΟΥ ΑΥΓΟΥΣΤΟΥ.

Le Guin’s HAINISH CYCLE continues with City of Illusions, which I liked better than its predecessors, Rocannon’s World and Planet of Exile.
City of Illusions takes place on Earth sometimes in the far future after an alien invasion has killed off most of the people and has completely changed the Earth’s ecology, infrastructure, and geopolitical arrangement.
To keep humans subjugated, the Shing also use their powers to cast illusions and to lie with their minds, which is why their capitol city is called the City of Illusions.Our story begins as a man with cat-like eyes wakes up in the wilderness and doesn’t know who or where he is.
Le Guin, City of Illusions"Truth, as ever, avoids the stranger."- Ursula K.
Le Guin, City of Illusions'City of Illusions' is the third book in LOA's  Ursula K.
Le Guin: Hainish Novels and Stories, Vol. 1.
It is infused with anthropology, philosophical speculations on the nature of truth, time, lies, patterns, knowledge, mortality, isolation, the alien and the self.
It is also heavily influenced by Taoism (Thurro-dowism; the Old Canon).The book started off probably a 3-star book.
But the last couple chapters were definitely 5-stars.
Perhaps, it is just my preference for the philosophical twistings and lint-picking that happens at the end: the explanation and unwinding of the story.
Uzak gelecekte geçen bir benlik arayışı macerası, sürükleyici bir yol hikayesi.
Yalın, durağan ama merak uyandırıcı.
Le Guin severleri tatmin edecektir.
Le Guin'in yazdığı üçüncü roman.
Hainish'e dahil ama kurgusal evren henüz Hainish ismiyle anılmıyor.
İlk üç kitapta Hainish vurgusu yok zaten.
Hainish ve/veya Ekumen sonradan kavramlaştırılıyor ama aynı şey aslında.Çok şart olmasa da okuma sırasına dikkat etmek iyi olur.
Yanılsamalar Kenti'nde özellikle Sürgün Gezegeni'ne yönelik anlamlı göndermeler mevcut.
Bu nedenle Rocannon'un Dünyası, Sürgün Gezegeni, Yanılsamalar Kenti sıralamasıyla okunması daha anlamlı olacaktır.
Ayrıca daha önceden Bağışlanmanın Dört Yolu okunduysa oradaki Werel Gezegeni'yle Sürgün Gezegeni ve Yanılsamalar Kenti'ndeki Werel gezegeni farklı gezegenler.
I am again amazed at Le Guin’s capability of creating a world, a strange culture so vividly. This book is about a journey of self-discovery, an adventure, a quest, it is about trust, history, perspectives, ways of life, and belief, it is about (view spoiler)[Earth being colonized by an alien race, about deception, manipulation, and control (hide spoiler)]. «Truth, as ever, avoids the stranger.»  «There’s always more than one way towards the truth.»
Неожиданно Вэнсовский роман, где потерявший память молодой герой путешествует по потерявшей память древней планете, которой правят то ли анонимные пастыри, то ли тайные тираны, и за каждым лицом прячется маска, и каждая фраза скрывает интригу.Очень неплохо, но совсем непохоже на ту Ле Гуин, которую мы все знаем и любим.
İyi ki okumuşum seneye bir daha okuyacağım 😇
City of Illusions was my favorite of the trilogy (Rocannon's World and Planet of Exile.) Like the others, it's about a journey of sorts, and starts off slow and gradually builds in intensity.
Indeed Tolkein wrote in much a similar style of emotional distance, and like countless other stories, the Hero's Journey is reenacted here (see Joseph Campbell for a fuller discussion).
Like the other Hainish cycle novels, this one can be read as a stand-alone for those not wishing to toil through Rocannon's World or Planet of Exile, which are certainly less polished.
Ursula Le Guin sure is interested in putting people from an advanced civilizations into primitive ones and seeing how they deal with a radically new set of customs.
City of Illusions changes things up a bit from the first two books in there is also something of a mystery element: our protagonist actually may or may not be from an advanced civilization.
Wraps up the third of three books in a "Three Hainish Novels" omnibus.
Not a trilogy really, though set in the same universe (with later books making tangential references to the earlier), and similar in tone and themes.
The book ''City of Illusions'' was a really nice surprise for me.Small in size,very easy to read and
Po dwóch pierwszych powieściach z cyklu Hain czytelnik myśli sobie, że wie, czego może się spodziewać. A jednak, chociaż osnute wokół podobnych wzorców fabularnych, „Miasto złudzeń” rozbija to nastawienie. http://pierogipruskie.blogspot.com/20...
Beautiful writing (as ever) but not quite as compelling as some of her other works.
(hide spoiler)] I enjoyed reading about his journey, but unfortunately when he reached his destination the story took a major downturn.(view spoiler)[ When Falk reaches his destination he is betrayed by the woman who led him there, beaten, and again kidnapped by the "Enemy" he has been warned about over and over.
I suppose Falk's naïveté in trusting the woman and again allowing himself to be captured is meant to follow from his limited life experience, as he still only remembers the previous six years.
(hide spoiler)]The book started out as an interesting and enjoyable story about self discovery and human nature.
I can't really explain what I mean by this without spoiling the plot, which I won't do here, but the idea that knowledge is power, but false knowledge can being destruction, chaos, and ultimately that lies bring about oppression and subjugation seems to be one of the main themes here.Also, the novel explores interesting concepts of self-identity, memory, and various forms of society, all while building a very rich world with a lot of interesting history.
It made me want to read more books in the series to explore all the nooks and crannies of this universe, that is rich with ideas.
That section--the slow journey through various dystopic human settlements--is this book's weakness: none of the settlements are especially convincing, and as satisfying as Le Guin's travelogues are (and they are; her descriptions of natural landscapes and the solitude of travel are precise and immersive) the plot here stagnates.
It's an introspective book--the most significant developments occur within the protagonist's mind, as he considers his situation, life experience, identity--but the results are profound, clever, and tie nicely into the series's shared universe.
It rewards active engagement and it's a satisfying testimony to Le Guin's strengths; a lesser author couldn't make that interior narrative so compelling, but Le Guin excels at the personal ramifications of speculative concepts.
Este universo del ciclo de Ekumen me ha recordado vagamente a la Tierra Media de Tolkien, aunque sea muy diferente en temática, pues Le Guin crea un mundo propio muy rico en detalles y con toques de fantasía.
Las costumbres de la gente, sus maneras de hablar, de relacionarse, de vivir en definitiva; están muy logradas y desarrolladas en sus obras.
Algo en su manera de narrar me evoca a esas novelas de fantasía con magia, hechiceros y héroes.
Se trata de una mezcla arriesgada entre elementos del futuro y del pasado con la que, en mi opinión, se crea una historia fascinante.Crítica completa en: https://alibreria.com/2017/03/28/crit...
