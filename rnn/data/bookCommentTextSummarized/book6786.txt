You can imagine there are quite a few brunette actresses wannabes around Hollywood, so the turnout rate was great.To make a long story short that girl's roommate got a job.
It would all be fine and dandy, but the job itself was so suspicious that the girls decided to use their brief acquaintance with Mason to hire him to dig out the details.
It is clear the hired woman was supposed to impersonate somebody (the fear that the said somebody was dead prompted Mason to begin his investigation).
No wonder the prosecution always try to bury the lawyer together with his client(s).
It is the "usual" fast-paced, intriguing Perry Mason-story with legal twists and turns. Our favourite defense attorney-cum-investigator has two defendants to save (one of them is the greatest liar he's ever met), a new legal enemy to cross swords with & a cunning murderer to find.More detailed review to come.
Found a 1946 first edition at a thrift store. Added to the charm of reading this clever mystery. Mason redefines thinking outside the box and since Garner was a lawyer he gets the technical stuff right, and is damn clever about it as well.
One of those cases where Gardner deliberately strings you on a red herring, to spring the real murderer (the most obvious) at the very end. The proofs were given in a very sudden way too. Almost as if Gardner couldn't think up a proper, methodical way to show it, leaving the job to intuition. A bit let down.
But...as Mason tells Assistant District Attorney Harry Gulling he's doing in the wrap-up scene...I'm getting the cart before the horse.When Perry and Della stop at one of the Adams Street corners and ask Miss Cora Fulton why she (and at least seven other brunettes) are playing a game of Statues on the street corners, they find that a Mr. Hines has advertised for just such a thing--looking for brunettes of a certain size, shape, and age to "audition" for a "colorful, adventurous job." Fifty dollars a day sounded pretty good to Cora and her friend Eva Martell, so they each answered the ad and were assigned positions along Adams.
***1/2.I’ve decided that I can’t read too many Perry Mason books too close together.
His plot twists become familiar and, pretty soon, you can stop reading and finish the book yourself.
But when someone punches a hole in Hines – with a bullet – the masquerade becomes a four play, with Mason front row center and a murderer in the wings.” This is a fairly well-crafted plot, although the edition I read seemed to have a transposition of some of the action to an improper part of the novel.
During his career, he managed to write 146 books, 85 of which featured Perry Mason.
But the Perry in the books is just a bit harder, which makes him just a bit sexier.This time around, Perry gets mixed up with a scheme that seems to have no purpose.
It quickly becomes apparent that the woman Eva was impersonating was up to no good, and that Mr. Hines was in on it.
It's up to Perry, with the help of Paul Drake, to find out what is going on before someone else ends up with a bullet in the head.It was an intriguing mystery that kept me guessing almost the entire time.
Hired to impersonate a married woman, a young actress is soon accused of murder. Perry Mason for the defence.A mystery built on some interesting law. Gardner keeps his readers enthralled.
The chaperone is an older woman named Adelle Winters, who knows them both well and has "been around".In summary, the man who posted the ad was Robert Hines, who was acting as agent for Helen Reedley.
The brunette, who is being "borrowed" must closely resemble Helen, enough to fool detectives who will be shadowing Helen.Here are the characters:Eva Martell, Cora Felton: nearly identical brunette roommates who want to be borrowed.Adelle Winters: older chaperone for Eva and Cora.Mae Bagley, a good egg.Orville Reedley, high powered intense businessman.Helen Reedley, wife of Orville, wants out.Robert Hines, acquaintance and helper of Helen.
A bigger problem I have with the book is that the whole plot hinges on Orville Reedley hiring detectives to shadow Helen.
#28 in the Perry Mason series.
By the end of 1946, Erle Stanley Gardner had written 28 Perry Mason mysteries (and a dozen other books - three series and a volume of short stories) over a span of 14 years.
A fun book as Mason works to clear a client who keeps changing her story.Perry Mason series - A Brunette on every corner!
Perry Mason and Della Street counted eight in succession, standing on corners a block apart, before pulling up to the curb to investigate.
Finished in a single stretch and kept me glued from start till end.The case is about a pretty Woman( Of course this point catched Mason's eye) applying for an odd job.
The advertisement is about a job specifically for Brunettes of a particular age and exact measurements.
Amateur model Eva MArtell gets chosen for the job but her aunt Adelle is not a bit interested and hence accompanies Eva. She also requests Mason to find out the secrets behind the offer.
The surprise is the exact sequence of events and the motive.TAKE THE BOOK AND IAM SURE IT WONT ALLOW YOU TO PUT IT ASIDE UNTIL DONE!
I found this to be faster paced than the last Perry Mason I read (I don't remember which).
I liked the story it kept me involved most of the time.
I feel as if Mason puts out a lot of "theories" about the murder that I usually don't believe a word of.
But this time the final conclusion was pretty well done.
There was tension till the very end of the story and that's the way I like my mysteries.
I was as intrigued by the situation as Perry Mason was when he found the brunettes on the street corners.
And the courtroom scene was pure fun to read!
Perry Mason as he is driving notices eight almost identical brunettes standing at consecutive corners on the south side of the street. His curiousity is aroused and he approaches one of the women. The woman explains her reasons and assumes the rest of the brunettes were also answering an employment ad. Of course, the brunette is accused of murder 24 hours later. So, Perry has to defend her and find out the scheme behind the identical brunettes. It's a neat twist to the plot and the story is always highlighted by the court room interrogations of Mason. A fun story.
Probably one of the better Perry Mason novels. It has an interesting gimmick--What's a borrowed brunette? The case goes to trial--that's always fun. The prosecution has a lawyer I hadn't seen before who is brighter than usual, though he's still no match for Mason. And Perry nearly has his license to practice law revoked. Only way it could have been better is if Tragg had been along confounding Mason.
Once you're hooked by Erle Stanley Gardner's Perry Mason stories, you stay hooked. I've read them all, some more than twice, and still every now and then I reach a point where nothing else will do.This one, though a fast and entertaining read as usual, doesn't have quite enough sparkle to rate four stars. Perry's curiosity is aroused by a series of identically dressed brunettes at a series of street corners and he can't help but stop and investigate.
Alkuasetelma on absurdi. Yleensä sellainen ei ole hyvä lähtökohta tarinalle, mutta tämä kirja on poikkeus. Eva Martell ja tämän koheltava kaitsija Adelle Winters sekaantuvat murhaan, ja Perry Masonilla on täysi työ estää asiakastaan päätymästä kalterien taakse. Kirjan kiehtovinta antia ovat oikeudenkäynnit, joiden kuvaajana Erle Stanley Gardner on aivan omaa luokkaansa.
A brunette, among many brunettes, is hired to impersonate another brunette. Who dun it? The end of writing during the war years. Again, not one word said about World War II. The biggest event of the decade and Gardner hasn't a thing to say about it. How about, "War is over?" Paul Drake takes a serious back seat in this one.
This is the first Perry Mason novel I've read. Loved the TV show, so I was astonished at how bad this was.A ludicrous plot. Characters so wooden that you could almost hear the mitre saw in the background. Dialogue so rote that even a soap opera actor would be embarrassed to utter the lines.
A perry Mason story in a book older than me! Amazing that it was printed in 1952 in New York and it was sent to me from a suburb of Stockholm Sweeden! A real "Pocket Book"(#856), a fun read, not too intense.
Not a "chase" novel like other Mason books, there's a lot of talking throughout. Fortunately the mystery itself is packed with dramatic turns, red herrings, and Perry Mason getting indicted as an accessory in two different crimes! Like any good Perry Mason book, that is, one like no other.
This is as engrossing and lovable as any other Perry Mason book. This one had less action and more talk. But the dialogue of these books is always catchy and witty. Thus, I really enjoyed the book. All Perry Mason books are must reads.
nee... ik word geen fan
My Rating System:* couldn't finish, ** wouldn't recommend, *** would recommend, **** would read again, ***** have read again.
All of the Perry Mason books are worth reading. They are great fun, and work well to learn how to structure a novel.
As good as any other perry mason books. loved it
perry mason one of the best suspense novel i ever seen,as usual this is not so much
Perry Mason proved to be the best of the 'olden days' crime fiction.I spent my train to work trips reading 1-2 books per week and found this book to be a gem of the vintage crime genre.
Typically well done Perry Mason. About a man having his estranged wife followed and her setting up a fake her so she can do what she wants without him knowing.
Great read. Conclusion is perfectly logical
a little too tricky for me, but PM is always worth the effort.
