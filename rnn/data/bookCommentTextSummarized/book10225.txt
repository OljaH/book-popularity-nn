I have now come to the end of my Miss Marple reading marathon this year, with this final volume, “Miss Marple’s Final Cases.” Although I often struggle with short stories, this is a fun collection, with a mix of both stories which feature Miss Marple and a couple of stand-alone stories thrown in.
As always, Miss Marple is her indomitable self – a great believer in justice and in her ability to draw parallels between those suspected of crimes and local ne’er do wells that she has come across in village life.
"Se cunosc cazuri când un om rănit mortal s-a ridicat singur și a mers o bună bucată de drum ca și cum nimic nu s-ar fi întâmplat, pentru ca după cinci, zece minute să leșine instantaneu. Meșterii de odinioară erau foarte inventivi când trebuiau să conceapă ascunzători. E ca și cum ai ascunde un secret într-un alt secret." "- Pur și simplu, dacă trăiești într-un sătuc, așa ca mine, ajungi să cunoști și să înveți despre natura umană. "
The story I most enjoyed in the collection was not a murder one to my own surprise but the “Perfect Maid”, which was such fun―I remembered the solution from a previous read but wouldn’t have guessed otherwise.
And one can’t help but love Doctor Haydock for knowing just the right medicine for Miss Marple, a case to solve when she needs it!Of the other two stories, “Greenshaw’s Folly” was enjoyable, pretty complicated really but seemed to me just a little bit far-fetched (with a plot detail was quite similar to another story).
When compared to the Conan Doyle created Sherlock Holmes short stories and novels (the only other classic literary sleuth I am familiar with) – the likeable Miss Marple is almost the antithesis of the wonderful but equally dislikeable Sherlock Holmes.
The stories non-Miss Marple stories included here were of a far more eerie and supernatural nature, not too dissimilar to the ghost stories of Susan Hill and were suitably ghostly and chilling in nature.Having read reviews of this collection of Miss Marple stories, it seems reasonable to view this book as a short, light and enjoyable introduction to the wider world of Agatha Christie and to her more well known, critically acclaimed and endlessly adapted works such as ‘Orient Express, Roger Ackroyd, And Then There Were One, Crooked House, ABC Murders et al.
2.5* but honestly, I couldn't make myself round it up to 3...It was a snoozefest.
I kinda felt like pages were missing from my book!??
I mean, short stories, okay, but damn.Let me show you what it felt like.Miss Christie: "There's a butler with a pink umbrella who has a tabby cat and smokes two cigarettes a day.
Who is the killer?"Me: …Me, 2 hours later: …Me, on my dying day: f*ck it, I give up.
That's what it was like.
Stories that were rushed and sloppy, details that were just pointless and the last two stories didn't even feature Miss Marple!?!?

Namanya saja kumpulan cerita, ada yg bagus dan biasa saja. Dua cerita terakhir berbau mistis.
The Miss Marple stories are OK, although I really prefer the full length novels. What spoils the book for me are the two final stories, sans Miss Marple. I don't at all care for this sort of supernatural horror stuff that doesn't make sense in the first place, let alone in this collection.

Miss Marple's final cases is a really interesting book. I finished reading it in a short period of time as I was flipping pages without getting bored. All the seven short stories are interesting but I was surprised because there was a horror story which is not Agatha Christie's style but it was worth reading. I would recommend this book to all people of different ages who like mystery.
أهمية هذا الكتاب تكمن في المقدمة التي تضمنته عن أغاثا وأعماله وشخصية الآنسة ماربليضم الكتاب 6 قصص قصيرة: أربع منها عن قضايا تقوم بحلها الآنسة ماربل، واثنان لا وجود لشخصية الآنسة ماربل فيهما، بل لا يمكن تصنيفهما تحت صنف الروايات أو القصص البوليسية، إذ هما أقرب للأدب الغرائبيوأرى أن أغاثا قد وفقت في هاتين القصتين، ولا أدري إن كان لها قصص أخرى قريبة من هذا النوع
Some wonderful short stories featuring Miss Marple, although the latter two don't feature her at all. The Dressmaker's Doll was really creepy! Great read.
Generalnie beznadzieja i daje 2,5/5 gwiazdek, bo szkoda gadać
كتابي الاول لاغاثا، كنت في الثانية عشر و لسبب ما ما زلت اذكر بعش قصصه و ما زلت اذكر الاختباء تحت البطانية مع المصباح الصغير لاقرأ في الوقت الذي يجب ان اكون فيه نائمة :)
So, they can be read separately.Miss Marple's Final Cases opens with "Sanctuary", an exciting five-star story Although Miss Marple makes a small appearance, she plays a big role in the mystery-solving.
Great ending and mystery."Tape-Measure Murder" is a good mystery and a recommended read.Two stories in the collection do not feature Miss Marple.
Took a while for me to wrap my mind around it but it is a great thought-provoking story nonetheless.Overall, Miss Marple's Final Cases are a fun and light dose of mysteries, from what is most likely the first woman sleuth.

Published posthumously , this is a collection of nine short stories two of which do not feature Miss Jane Marple. One of the stories The Case of the caretaker, first published in The Strand in 1942 was later expanded into full fledged novel- Endless night published in 1967. In the novel there is no Miss Marple. However when the novel was adapted into a movie, Miss Marple had a significant role. Since the short story format does not leave enough space for plot to be fully developed, the collection is at best an average read.
8 قصص لكلاً منها نكهته الخاصة ، الكتاب جاء مناسب جدا لإجازة العيد 👌🏻ربما أكثر قصة أثرت فيني هي قصة " دمية الخياطة " لأن موضوع حركة الدمى والإعتقاد بإن الدمى تتحرك وتتحدث أيضا هو أحد معتقدات طفولتي. البريئة ☺ بالعامية " خوفتني هالقصة " أنصحكم به كتاب لطيف جدا #أبجدية_فرح #إنستقرام

مجموعة قصصية تتكون من ثماني قصص قصيرة، ست منهن يقدمن الآنسة ماربل.قصص للقراءة الخفيفة؛ أحببت قضية وكيلة البيت (وهي قصة قصيرة لرواية ليل لا ينتهي) و جريمة في المرآة.
More like “This reviewer’s final decision to never read Agatha Christie again”.
At the end of her life, Agatha Christie agreed to publish the remaining Miss Marple short stories which hadn’t yet been put into book format.There’s a reason they hadn’t yet been put into book format.
These are indicative of Christie at her short story laziest, and Miss Marple – a character who is often “magically” intuitive in her understanding – here is just a plot device to reveal answers no one could ever have known.
The two final stories – 'The Dressmaker’s Doll' and 'In A Glass Darkly' - are equally forgettable tales of the supernatural.
Ideal bed time reading - the stories are written well enough to draw you in, but are short and formulaic enough to not keep you up all night guessing what happened next.
Some of the stories are more obvious than others.
Unlike in the The Thirteen Problems, there is no particular thread to collection - and no story line within the collection to reveal more about Miss Marple (or why the collection is titled Final Cases).
Agatha Christie at her best and it's nice to have some short stories that you can read quickly in between doing other things.
Pretty thin stuff. Enjoyable but not more.The GR blurb:'A collection of Miss Marple mysteries, plus some bonus short stories...First, the mystery man in the church with a bullet-wound...then, the riddle of a dead man's buried treasure...the curious conduct oif a caretaker after a fatal riding accident...the corpse and a tape-measure...the girl framed for theft...and the suspect accused of stabbing his wife with a dagger. Six gripping cases with one thing in common - the astonishing deductive powers of Miss Marple. Also includes two non-Marple mysteries, 'The Dressmaker's Doll' and 'In a Glass Darkly'.'
Keď spravím priemer môjho hodnotenia všetkých deviatich poviedok, vyjde 3,2*. Nakoľko mám ale momentálne čitateľskú krízu a v podstate všetky knihy po oár stranách zavriem, zatiaľ čo táto ma hneď chytila a ani mi nenapadlo prestať... Tie 4* si zaslúži.Inak obálka je odporná a ešte sa aj viaže na moju najmenej obľúbenú poviedku. Nebola tam slečna Marplová a akosi to nemalo žiadne rozuzlenie. Inak to bolo fajn. Síce žiadne wow poviedky (stále od Agathy preferujem romány), ale aj tak to bolo dobré.
This collection contains a couple of standalone mysteries, as well as several featuring Miss Marple. They are all excellent examples of how Agatha Christie, the Queen of Crime, constructs a taut and engaging plot and believable characters in a few carefully chosen phrases. I have always enjoyed the Miss Marple short stories, they work well in a way that some of the later novels do not, and this is an enjoyable and easy read. Perfect for a winter's evening or two.
I've never managed to conquer audiobooks but this was fun. I think that they're short stories helped, 3o minute increments seems to be what I can stand before my mind is completely afoot. It helps that Tape Measure and Perfect Maid are two of my favorite Marples. June Whitfield is a very good Miss Marple as well. Nice to place to dip your toe if audiobooks are a challenge.
3 stars.This was alright, but I definitely preferred the first collection of Miss Marple short stories. While some of the stories were enjoyable, others didn't even have Miss Marple in them, and unfortunately there were some which I weren't impressed by at all.This is my least favourite Christie read so far, though not really bad. Ah well^^ Still a huge fan of Miss Marple!
I am nearly finished with Miss Marple series. There is another short story collection but it consists of stories previously included in other books, so I'll wait a bit before reading it. Meanwhile, there's Poirot.
Pleasant.
funny and unexpected
