(That's what I read urban fantasy for anyway.) And the hunk here is something special - (1) he is drowning in money; (2) super hot; (3) has morals; (4) buys the heroine stuff; (5) feeds her; (6) he adores everything about the heroine from the get-go; (7), (8), (9) and (10) HE SPEAKS WITH AN IRISH ACCENT.
Plus, as I've noted above, the switch from mystery to romance was too early in the book.
At that point, I already knew how it would unfold, with "throbbing," "wetness," "I want you but I can't" and so on.Sorry ladies, but romance is not quite my thing.
4 StarsThis was solid.Fast paced.Sexy.Fun.And old.Seriously though, there are, what, only 40 thousand books in the series after this one? LolRegardless, I see why - I have not a damn thing to add to the multitude of reviews on this - and I look forward to the next one.
The thing is, I love murder mysteries and crime-solving books with a touch of romance but the futuristic aspect?
If the story is set in 2058 and he was born in 2023, then I’m… Right.The good news is, I didn’t need to worry.
There were a few mentions of badass vehicles and gadgets, strange laws (sin tax, seriously?) and funny global issues but that was pretty much it.The bad news is, I had a problem with some of the events.
I’ve always wanted to be a badass cop like Eve. Or a crime scene investigator.
I've finally read the first book in J.D. Robb's, aka Nora Roberts', vastly popular In Death series, and now I understand why there's 30 books and counting...'cause it's an awesome romantic suspense/futuristic mystery thriller and very addictive.
I wasn't convinced that a series could stay interesting and fresh enough with the same characters for 30+ books, but I don't think there could ever be enough of Roarke...he's that yummy!I'm not sure if I need to recommend this since it seems that just about everyone else has already read it, but if you like romantic suspense and/or mystery thrillers and haven't yet read Naked in Death, then I highly suggest it.
Read Nora Roberts years ago and thought it was the greatest load of shite I had ever read - an Irish themed book - I am Irish so a bit sensitive.
Read some forums on Amazon and GRs about Roarke and Eve and thought who are they - In Death - J.
Will I go back and read a Nora Roberts book after this/ Not sure, maybe, probably as I can see a definite improvement in her writing style....
Now I am totally depressed cos I realise that if I have to read the whole IN DEATH series it is going to cost me a feckin' fortune.
ROARKE!!! OMG I'm melting in here... Ladies, don't you ever forget this name!!! He's hot, he's smart, he's funny but the most important thing is he's so freaking HOT! I Loved him a lot. :D You have to meet with him ASAP! :DAnd Eve Dallas... Damn, what a strong lady. I loved her too... :)I will definitely continue to read their story...:)Whenever I read Roarke's words... This is exactly me. :D------------------My favorites quotes! And yesss,I have a lot of them... 😍😍😍 “I can't tell you how arouse
“I can't tell you how aroused it makes me when you quote codes, lieutenant.” "I don't like the idea of you shivering unless I cause it.
Stay warm."“I like your style, Lieutenant Dallas," he said when they'd fought their way to the car.
I'm not a good bet." - Eve Dallas"I like long odds." He lifted her hand, kissed it.
"Be sure to put that in your report.”“He took her hand, lifted it to his lips.
"We have more of a selection on the plane," he said, then settled back with his coffee."I bet." The steam rising from her cup smelled like heaven.
4 Stars - Also reviewed at: Lady Jayne's Reading DenOkay, here’s the quick and dirty... well, sort of.  Naked In Death  is the first book in the daunting (almost 40 books!!... and still growing) “In Death” series by Nora Roberts, writing as J.D. Robb. I kept putting off reading it, for that very reason. Though, after recent reviews by Goodreads friends who have joined the growing legion of “Roarke Groupies”, I was most curious to read this book to find out for myself what the fuss is over Roarke
Though, after recent reviews by Goodreads friends who have joined the growing legion of “Roarke Groupies”, I was most curious to read this book to find out for myself what the fuss is over Roarke.
^_~I seem to recall, prior to reading this book, people expressing that they didn’t really like Eve. Lt.
She was funny and provided the comic relief in the story, like for example, in the scenes below where Mavis and Eve are discussing Roarke: ‘"Is he good?
LOL Overall, I really enjoyed my first “In Death” book and will certainly be reading more - Hey, I want to upgrade to full "Roarke Groupie" status!
So there's this sometimes interesting/sometimes uncomfortable combination of modern/future ideals and innovations coupled with surprisingly old-fashioned tropes.Like how our heroine Eve Dallas is as hard core and strong a female character as I'd expect to find in any recently published SFF or UF novel, who lives in a world with legalized prostitution (gov't regulated and taxed, naturally), but who also falls prey to Red Flag b/c hot DAMN.No, seriously.
And part of the reason for that is b/c Roberts does such a good job of developing Eve and Roarke that you understand why he's a Red Flag, but know that he'd never actually cross that line (even though your brain and statistics tell you otherwise).
If Eve wasn't attracted to him, she would have slapped him with a restraining order for being a creep!Consequently, I found Roarke so difficult and so overpowering, I didn’t really get much of a sense of Eve as a character.
I appreciate that this is a series, so it takes a bit more time with character development, but I just couldn’t get a handle on her.
I understood that she was sort of into order and justice pretty much on principle, and that she was totally hot for Roarke, but I didn’t get much sense of her beyond that.
:)For being written in the 90s, this holds up pretty darn well.
I grew to like Eve, the police lieutenant, and Roarke, the roguish millionaire (billionaire?) who is more complicated and interesting than he first appears.I am definitely interested in continuing the series.
It's only a tiny bit "sci-fi," as it takes place in the near-future (maybe 50 years from now).
I would barely consider this sci-fi, actually.
But it was an enjoyable read.
Roarke is a sexy male lead and Eve grew on me.
The subject matter of this one is pretty dark (sexual murders), but it isn't too graphic.
Buddy read with the MacHalo group.
and the leading suspect in the investigation.I’m not usually a fan of the Mystery/Thriller genre, but my daughter has been raving about these books for years.
I wasn't just listening to a story, I was there as the story unfolded!The Audio - I’ll admit that I’m fairly new to audio books, but I know what I like and what I don’t.
But now that I'm doing a re-listen while waiting for book 2, and focusing more on Roarke and Eve, there's no way there is just "some romance and relationship building." It's off the charts!The Bottom Line - If you’re a fan of whodunits, you need to get this book.
It had everything, a kick-ass heroine with a bad past, a powerful, slightly shady and richer than Midas hero, a great mystery and a serial killer, all that set in a futuristic world which was surprisingly well thought and realistic for a book written 20 years ago when even cell phones were a rarity.
I also loved how the author managed to write a book who was basically full of investigative work and not make it boring.
The series already has 40 books and no end in sight, so it could afford to prolong the "falling in love" a little.
It's called a "roomba" and doesn't wear an apron..But, I still liked all of the futuristic stuff in the story - it was fun!
Eve was a pretty good character, but a little on the boring side.
We have a dowdy, boring female who is suddenly thought to be the most desirable female on Earth to a guy who would never look at someone like her twice.
I like a good stabby-murder book, and I like future stuff - like my friends who live in Australia, so it was a win.
Even better the second time around!
LOVED LOVED LOVED it.
❤❤❤I’ve been missing these two.
Going back to the beginning of a series that I LOVE.
❤❤************I loved Naked in Death which is book #1 in the In Death Series by J.D. Robb.
As I write this I can say I loved book #2 as well (I’ll be writing a short review soon).
And I am on to book #3 and loving it already.
A lot of love going on here but rightfully so.
I sure hope it continues through the 40 or so books within this series.
YES I said 4
Going back to the beginning of a series that I LOVE.
❤️❤️************I loved Naked in Death which is book #1 in the In Death Series by J.D. Robb.
In a lengthy series like this I think it is so important the surround he H & h with such characters.I instantly fell in love with Lieutenant Eve Dallas our heroine.
When he becomes a suspect in the murder case she is working on we find Eve in a bit of a predicament.
As I said I have moved on and I am still enjoying this series.
For all of you that enjoy RS get to this series soon.
Love a good mystery that keeps me guessing.
I like that he didn't let Eve's issues stand in the way of their relationship, but he wasn't out to change her or remake her into a more manageable woman for his life.
Rourke's larger than life personality and his developing relationship with Eve made an appreciated counterbalance to the mystery involving horrible misogyny and violence against women.
And since I love noir mixed with most genres, the future noir in this book went over great for me.I can't say I'm a big Nora Roberts fan, but I definitely like this series, and I want to read more of them.
Huh. I guess I *might* have been able to get behind the instalove and other corny quotes if the love interest's MO hadn't been following some kind of Abuser 101 Guide : indeed Roarke repeatedly uses both physical force and psychological harassment to manipulate the heroine into thinking that what they share is a love story.
I have no patience for Christian Grey's duplicates (or, rather : inspiration??
Well, that's just it : I have no patience for this shit.
It was a quick read, I'll give it that.
TW for graphic violence, child abuse, rape, pedophilia
So I'm going to break this down.What didn't work:-the plot: it was all over the place, half romance half murder mystery.
It never really settled-INSTALOVE-poorly written sex scenes -poorly written "romantic scenes"-murder mystery pushed into subplot in 2nd half of bookAND (don't kill me ladies)...I didn't like Roarke.Maybe I just was anticipating too much from him?
All he had going was he was rich, hot and into Eve. That was about it...........................................................................What I liked about the book:-Eve: a very complex, strong female character that is well written.
I read the synopis on the back of the book and was instantly put off by the futuristic setting.
But, I kept hearing how good these books were, so I picked up a used copy of the first one and could not put it down.
( It wasn't over done, just not her style when writing as Nora Roberts.) But, when you stripped it bare, it was a detective/crime drama set in the future with a little romance thrown in for good measure.
Eve would rather not remember.
Plus, Eve is finally able to start dealing with her own troubled past.If you haven't read these books, I highly recommend giving them a try.
★★★★★ 5 Suspense-Filled stars ★★★★★Its true in all my reading time,I've never really picked up a Nora Robert  so far.Its true in this case I did judge the book by its cover.Every time I passed a book store to pick up my reads I always tended to shy away from the Pure Romance section,and chose Mystery-Romance Or Erotica-Romance or another combination over Chic-lite or Angst.After all there was always next month.And when I heard J.D Robb was an Alias of Nora Robert.I was quite excited to give this author a try.
Will be trying my best not to read the series in a stretch and give my self a book migraine.
Suspense – 5 stars / Romance – 3 starsWhat could I say about this book to sound fancy?Nothing.
You said it all.Why did I wait so long to start this series?
-> How original?..I can’t believe this book was written more than 20 years ago!
-> Never heard it before?Blah blah blahI liked it.
Crime and suspense were written brilliantly.
I cracked the secret/suspense at approx..
60% *pat myself on the back* As to the romance part – I’m not sure.
I didn’t like Roarke.
I hope he’ll come around.Blah blah blahGotta go… I have another 18745 books in this series… Or was it more?
40 or so books later we all feel we own a little bit of Eve and Roarke and their amazing world and we are always waiting for more!I love Naked in Death.
It introduces us to our two most important characters, begins their delightful relationship and sets the scene in a fascinating futuristic world.
Some of the side characters also appear in this first book and we begin to discover the awful past which is Eve's driving force.
I know the story well but still reached for the tissues when Eve disclosed some of her history to Roarke.
I feel slightly embarrassed to admit I absolutely loved this. A great combination of romance and crime. I really liked the fact that Roarke was completely into Eve from the first time he met her. I really enjoyed the slight sci fi elements too. So pleased to see there are many in the series as they are perfect as a light read. I just hope they don't become too formulaic.Recommended.
The relationship and attraction in this book develops pretty quickly--faster than I expected or wanted--but I can't say I expected any different seeing as this isn't actually a Romance series.
Luckily, I know there's plenty of time in this series for the author to develop their relationship.
It's no hardship for me to watch their relationship develop over the course of the books since I know that they are together and the author didn't throw any retarded love triangles in there.
I am addicted to this series, I absolutely love it, and it gets better as it goes along (I'm on book 5 now).It's romance/mystery, so if you like a splash of sex with your serial killers, this is the series for you!!
I read this book back when it was first released and as I started the audio I quickly realized my memory is not at all good!
I wonder if it'll live up to my painfully vague memories of it?Later:I read this when was it first released in 1995 and decided to give it a reread on audio hoping it would hold up so many, many years later.
I’m talking about YOU.There’s no sense in rehashing the plot of this old book.
It’s not quite the five I remembered but I’m old and crabby now.
4 stars!So this a 40 plus book series with the same couple!
We have detective Eve Dallas, who is investigating the death of the senator daughter’s.
I really liked how the plot played out, the suspense, the romance as far as h goes I don’t have a favorite kind as long as she goes well with story I really don’t care much.
My man Rourke of course was the perfect match for Eve he definitely brought out her vulnerable side.
Their relationship wasn’t rushed.As for the suspense it definitely was a shocker and kinda of disturbing.
Overall a solid read let’s see what book two brings.
There are a lot of great reviews for this book so I'll be short.
Considering the year it was written, the futuristic aspects were good.
Murder mystery was okay.
What I didn't like was the romance part.
I am very easy to sell on couples and love stories.
Just gimme some steam and sappy thoughts, and put the couple together in an okay way and I'm rooting for them.
Here, I just couldn't root for the romance.
Still, I enjoyed the book and will read the rest of the series.
I think the world building could turn out great!
Naked in Death was first released in 1995, but it’s still fresh and innovative today, which tells you everything you need to know about it.
In Naked in Death, Eve investigates the murders of three prostitutes.
Her investigation takes straight to one of the richest men in the world – Roarke – but as hard as she tries, Eve just can’t see the honest, competent man as her killer.
Naked in Death has a strong romance, yes, but it’s so much more than that.
The case Eve investigates isn’t just something to fill the pages between romantic encounters.
Lieutenant Eve Dallas had been on the force for ten years and in that time had seen it all – or so she thought.
But when she was called into a Code Five – highly sensitive, no media output – the disgust had her stomach clenching.
But it went against everything Eve was to succumb to his charms; especially in the midst of a murder investigation.
I’m starting the series afresh and have absolutely loved the first book all over again.
Intense and gritty, it’s filled with the usual angst Eve goes through but this is the beginning of her journey.
Highly recommended.
Well, in my case, I read #1 and #2 a wee while back and enjoyed them, then I got distracted…next thing I know we’re past 30 and 40.
So, I put the In Death series on hold determined that I will get back into the series…soon…ish.WELL, THAT DAY HAS COME!!I have a shocking memory and back in those days, I didn’t write reviews so it was back to square one and re-reading from the beginning.
I enjoyed meeting the additional characters and hope some of them will pop up in future reads.I'm looking forward to going on with the series but it will take time…lots and lots and lots of time.
