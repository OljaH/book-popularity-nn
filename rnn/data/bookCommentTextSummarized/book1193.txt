Kant's Copernican Revolution was not merely making knowledge of empirical objects a synthesizing process of the subjective mind and objective phenomena, but that in this cooperative mental venture between judgments of understanding, objective forms, and sensible intuitions by means of the relevant categories we come to understand that the process of determining knowledge is one of taking the information provided by the individual object and, through the extension of logical operations, forming universal laws, axioms, etc that apply to the whole.
What Cassirer therefore seeks is how to discover universal laws and meaning for each cultural adjunct—science, myth, religion, language, art—using the analytic and categories of the critical philosophy while maintaining each in its own particular sphere.
filled with notation and depth, Cassirer gracefully follows procedure (comparative linguistics) with theorem and proof.
his citations are the peak of the early 20th century german academies, as well as earlier minds like Grimm (linguist and brother of the team), Kant, Seler, Meinhof.
Cassirer's theoretical leaps are not the stuff of meaning (like semiotics) but of gesture, integrations, hierarchies.
The stuff of advanced, future languages.
When he reaches polysynthetic languages like Quechua and Maya, he quickly describes their shift in structure, an advancement of verb isolation and dominance.
The science of the mind appears to be evolving with our linguistic skills.
It's perfect.
