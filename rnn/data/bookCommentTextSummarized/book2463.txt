I was recommended this book by someone who extolls it's virtue highly. Although I am not about to denigrate the integrity of this book, I have to admit I was somewhat disappointed at its content. This book is really small and meagre. The writings are extremely simple.I was told that this one is the basis of all numerology, so I was expecting a book with the details of the Upanishads - but - be surprised, for the book is like a summary of the numbers.Perhaps I should just pick this up again.
