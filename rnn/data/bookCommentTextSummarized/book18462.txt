Oh my GAWD! This book was such a spine tingling, page turner! It was hard to put this down and go about other things when I had to.... Seriously I believe this is one of Coben's best novels. He has been and will stay one of my favorite authors! If you haven't read anything by him you need to shut your head in a door (not too hard because you need to read his books) and then grab a handful of his novels. You won't be sorry!!!!!!!!!!
Any author can pull something ludicrous out of their ass to surprise their readers, but it takes a great author to weave a plot tight enough to keep its secrets hidden while still being believable.The story follows Maya in the aftermath of her husband's murder.
When I think of thriller authors I enjoy - like French or Lehane, or even King - I always feel so much more emotionally-engaged while reading their books.Is there another Coben book I should try?Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube
Terrible conclusion to this story, the author definitely went the easy way out, feeling the need to SCHOCK everyone.
I do normally put a warning about possible minor spoilers but as I didn't think I was saying more than the book blurb did I didn't bother on this review.
So I will put the warning in now.******Possibly some minor spoilers!!!!!!******I have read a few books by Harlan Coben and really enjoyed them.
As the book opens to main character Maya and her 2 year old daughter Lily attending Maya's husband funeral.
Maya reviews some of the footage from the cam and can't believe her eyes when she sees her two-year-old daughter playing with what looks like her deceased husband.
The story follows Maya, a battle-weary veteran whose home life is turned upside down when her husband is murdered.
The image looked like her dead husband — how could that be?One of Coben's story trademarks is that you never know who to trust, and here it's heightened even more because Maya doesn't trust anyone.
She doesn't even fully confide in her fellow combat veterans or in her therapist.One of the plot lines I liked in this book was how Coben featured the stress and trauma that veterans have suffered.
I liked following Maya on this mystery and appreciated most of the surprises.
For me, this was just okay. Not as strong as the other Coben novels I have read. There are a few twists and turns, but I was not as shocked as I expected to be. Also, it felt like a lot of filler - like he stretched a 150 page book out to 400 pages. It was a mediocre experience, but it won't keep me from reading more Coben in the future.
3.5* Attending a funeral is hard to do, especially if you are a widow with a two year old daughter to raise on your own.
Somehow Maya Stern is able to hold it all together, most likely from her training as a special ops pilot.
After the funeral, Eileen, a close friend, gives her a gift; a nanny cam.
Although Maya trusts her nanny completely, she decides to set it up where her daughter would be playing during the day.
Maya doesn’t view the nanny cam often, but one evening when she takes a look, her world suddenly turns upside down.
I have come to expect a few things from a Harlan Coben book over the years.
I love the twists and turns found in his stories and I really enjoy seeing Mr. Coben's sense of humor work its way into the books.
I love a story that can keep me guessing and I was completely shocked by the things that I learned by the end of the story.I would highly recommend this book to others.
I plan to continue to read Harlan Coben's work and can't wait to see what he comes up with next.I received an advance reader edition of this book from Penguin Publishing Group - Dutton via Edelweiss for the purpose of providing an honest review.Initial ThoughtsI loved this one!
Harlan Coben has fooled me numerous times during this particular story!Maya Stern, retired helicopter pilot, returns home after a tragic ending to her service in Iraq.
Things get even worse when her husband Joe is shot dead, with Maya witnessing his murder.
Events then take a really weird turn when she sees Joe on her nanny cam.
Is Joe really dead?
He must be - Maya saw it happen - attended his funeral.
Once again, Harlan Coben has included so many twists that I'll need to lay down to get over it!
And have I mentioned the ending yet?
SWEDISH REVIEW Harlan Coben är en författare som är fantastisk på att skriva en spännande thriller. Jag älskar särskilt hans Myron Bolitar-serie. I Sanningen har Coben återigen skrivit en intressant berättelse där ingenting är som det verkar. Jag gillade omedelbart Maya och det var intressant att läsa om hur hon försöker hantera situationen att vara en ensamstående mamma, ex-soldat och på det tillkommer ett mysterium, ett omöjligt mysterium då hon seer något som inte kan vara sant i babykameran
Harlan Coben är en författare som är fantastisk på att skriva en spännande thriller.
Och, vem kan hon lita på, det verkar som om många människor runt henne har hemligheter...Jag kunde inte sluta läsa Sanningen när jag väl hade börjat .
Boken kanske inte hade lika många överraskningar som i några av Cobens tidigare böcker, men det är fortfarande en alldeles fantastisk bok.
Något som Coben är bra på är att skapa huvudkaraktärer man bryr sig om och besynnerliga mysterier.
I recommend reading Harlan Coben's books if you like page-turning thrillers with lots of twist and turns.
This suspense novel keeps you guessing right to the very end and is sure to entertain the reader.Maya Stern is a retired helicopter pilot and returns home after a troubled ending to her time in Iraq.
What follows is Maya's search for answers.This novel is a page turner and is sure to keep the reader guessing as the suspense builds up to a climatic finale.
Yes this is another roaring success for Harlan Coben.I would like to thank Net Galley and Random House for supplying a copy of this novel in exchange for a honest review.
Okay,  NOW  I get the Harlan Coben thing! This was my first Coben read, and I loved it.Former Special Ops pilot, Maya (she's kind of a bad-ass and I loved her), witnesses the murder of her husband, shot right in front of her in a public park at night, leaving her a widow and a single mother to their two-year-old daughter, Lily.The murder was never solved. What exactly happened that night? and why? Then, Maya sees something on her nanny cam footage... her dead husband. WAIT. Whaaaat?Is he alive?

her dead husband.
Can she trust her own eyes?This is an amazing and totally engrossing page-turner with an ending you won't see coming, and one of the very best endings to a mystery suspense-thriller I've ever read....ever.
Maya is an amazing character, and her heroic, protective instincts as a mother, soldier, and citizen were gripping and admirable to experience.
Weird.....ending.....
I didn't drift off .....held my attention -easily.I don't think I've ever read a Harlan Coben book before now---maybe I have years ago?Or was it one of the others -Koontz?

I liked this trashy book...
Dumb ending...
BUT....THEY FOOLED me 'once'.
BUT....THEY FOOLED me 'once'.
So.....the novel got its job done.I suspect - "FOOL, YOU ONCE" ....
will 'fool' many readers --- but will you like it?
I read my first Harlan Coben novel about 4 years ago, a book titled “Caught.” I loved it!
***end spoiler***It always feels that Mr. Coben has a template and when it’s time for him to release a new book, he just plugs in characters names.So, you’re probably wondering, “If you feel this way, why read his books?” Well, as funny as it sounds, I think Harlan Coben is a very gifted and very talented novelist.
I not only like his writing style a lot but I love his characters.His books are fast-moving, easy reads.
Not good!Another read of one of my fave’s.
She captured Maya’s voice perfectly – the seriousness of her character was perfect.
Capable and strong that her character was.
Maya is struggling after the death of her husband, whose family is one of the ultra rich variety.
She is ex-military so she’s a capable woman, and when things start turning sinister, she has it covered, mostly.Shane was a character I felt was lacking depth, considering his importance to the epilogue.
HC serves a great purpose to my reading repertoire, he’s one of my go to authors and that is one thing I love.
It was very well managed and I was clueless!I must admit that occasionally in the first half of the book the thought did cross my mind that this was not as good as the Myron Bolitar books.
Maya did a lot of mental self evaluation and once or twice I am sure I muttered out loud something like "Oh do get on with it!" I am prone to do that with audio books when I get a bit bored.
The second half however really picked up and once Maya really got her act together it romped home to that amazing and quite shocking ending.A special mention also to the narrator who delivered an excellent performance.
My first Coben in quite a while, but definitely a page-turner and entertaining holiday read, which was exactly what I was looking for. I read this is going to be turned into a film with Julia Roberts, and I am curious to see how that will turn out.Find more reviews and bookish fun at http://www.princessandpen.com
It was a book I just couldn't put down, and one I continued to think about after I had finished reading.Former special ops pilot Maya, home from the war, sees an unthinkable image captured by her nanny cam while she is at work: her two-year-old daughter playing with Maya’s husband, Joe—who had been brutally murdered two weeks earlier.
To find the answer, Maya must finally come to terms with deep secrets and deceit in her own past before she can face the unbelievable truth about her husband—and herself.More in this vein please Mr Coben...I will be looking forward to your next release with interest.Thank you to NetGalley and Random House UK, Cornerstone Century for a digital ARC in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.
A fast paced suspense thriller with a nice little gotcha moment at the end, had me guessing all the way through, it’s got some obvious holes in the plot but I enjoyed the weird ending anyway. I love that the main character was a fierce female that did not hold back any punches. Fun audio to make the car trips go by quickly, 3.5 stars rounded up for fun factor and for not boring me once.
What if certain events turn your world upside down - you don't know whom to trust - your paranoia makes you suspect your friend and you start doubting your own sanity as well.The protagonist of the story - Maya Stern is an ex-military pilot who was forced out of the army because of an operational blunder and worse than that her sister and husband has been murdered - her husband's murder took place in front of her own eyes.
The perfect setting for a mystery novel and I simply loved the character of Maya - a lone individual seeking the truth against heavy odds.
But, if you want to dig a little deeper, this story provides an interesting character study and one that left me feeling a little conflicted.
What choices you make can and will come back to haunt you but are they entirely wrong?
Is there a way to even the score?
Maybe we all carry a little darkness in our souls or maybe we just want to see justice done the way we think is should be, and maybe heroism comes in many forms.
I don’t think you will be disappointed.This review is the copyrighted property of Night Owl Reviews.
I received this book from the publisher in exchange for an honest review.
I personally just try to enjoy the ride, as I know that the guilty party is always someone unexpected, true for this novel as well.I found a few of the scenarios a bit far fetched and unlikely, and a couple of times, during Maya's chasing for clues, I wondered what had happened with her little daughter or with her job, as nothing was mentioned about either (who was looking after Lily and didn't she have to be at work?)Unfortunately, Fool Me Once was a miss for me.
Is this the best book that Harlan Coben has written?
Upstanding, but weak brother-in-law.The storyline is typically convoluted, sometimes implausible, but wrapped up thoroughly in the end.
However, I wasn't too wrapped up in the story; I just went along for the ride.One thing that irritated me throughout the book was that every character who was having a conversation with Maya had to repeatedly get her attention by saying, "Maya?" Was that supposed to be due to her PTSD?
That she couldn't concentrate on anything?I've read all of Coben's books.
This might be the beginning of the end.
As Grisham went, so might Coben.
"When you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth."F
Ex-Army Captain Maya Stern (now Burkett) was traumatised but knew she had to stay strong for her two year old daughter Lily; she felt it keenly, especially as it was only four months since her sister Claire had also been murdered.
When Maya saw something which wasn’t in any way possible, she wondered if she’d lost the plot – if the stress and trauma of leaving the army, Claire’s murder and now Joe’s murder, was causing her to hallucinate.
So, she decided that she would find Joe’s murderer one way or the other…As Maya worked her way through the maze of deeply buried secrets she knew she was getting close.
I love suspense novels, especially when they're so intense that they keep me guessing until the very end.
Harlan Coben is the king of great suspense in my mind, and this book is definitely one of his best.
And if you haven't read one of his books, I highly recommend you start with this one!Maya is probably the most badass heroine I've ever read about.
This was a book I did not want to put down and kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time.If you enjoy suspense, I can't recommend this book and author enough!ARC provided by publisher via Edelweiss in exchange for an honest review.
Former Army Captain Maya Stern inexplicably sees her recently murdered husband, Joe Burkett, on her new nanny cam holding her two-year old daughter.
Her investigation sends her on a bizarre trek into secrets and lies going back decades, all the while as the police try to figure out who killed Joe and we try to determine if he's really dead.
I'm a huge Coben fan so this twisty, around the bend story was expected.
I enjoyed the story but it didn't have me dying to get through the book.
This was so very good, and quite a thrilling roller  coaster of a read.
It doesn't take long at all for Coben to throw a tidbit, a red herring if you will, at us.
I was positive I had the ending all figured out -- positive!
But I knew there would still be something I hadn't thought of, being it's  Coben and all.
All I got right was that I'd end up loving it.
PTSD plays a big part in the story, and Coben acknowledged the veterans he interviewed to nail down his descriptions and bring their suffering to light.A Goodreads First Reads win.
Master Storyteller Harlan Coben delivers his next edge of your seat thriller with Fool Me Once.
Full of twists and turns you will be fooled more than once!Former Special Ops Pilot Maya Stern returns from Iraq after a mission gone bad.
Just as she is adjusting to being back home her husband Joe, is murdered.Suffering from PTSD and trying to raise her 2 year old daughter Maya suddenly has reason to believe that Joe might not be dead.
She searches for answers amidst a bevy of lies and deceit.
