In the end, she decided that she didn't love him, and realized doing that was only going to hurt them more.
-Which pretty much said that she understood what love is, showing her growth from book 1.Ironically, Rose was the one who scolded her classmates for breaking the rules, while on book 1, she broke the rules herself.She was a very quick learner, and she understood that she couldn't take on the Strigoi easily, not like she has previously assumed.
In the end, she killed two.What I love about Vampire Academy books is that they are deep.

____________________________________________You can find the full review and more about this book on my blog!As I said,I quite liked the first one,not as much as everybody out there,but it was interesting and I started to like vampires as creatures.This is,however,was as enjoyable as the first.It was not better for me.There is some character development here,maybe more than in the first,and the story of this one was clearly more interesting,but...I still don't think Rose is an ideal main character.It's just that she is really annoying at times,and all the thinks about is sex and boys and this stuff.I like it when author show flaws at character,but with Rose is kind of getting overused.Comparing her to other heroines like Celaena from Throne of Glass or June from Legend or Tessa from The Infernal Devices,let's be honest,she is zero.I liked the new characters,or the old characters but with new habits like Mia.And the scene with water in the end was awesome.____________________________________________
“You can't force love, I realized. It's there or it isn't. If it's not there, you've got to be able to admit it. If it is there, you've got to do whatever it takes to protect the ones you love.”  God!!!I love this book!! It was amazing!! This isn't the first time I read this series, and I still love it!I love Dimitri! I love Adrian! I love Christian!  “Good God. Men everywhere.”   ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------1)I will start wit
He was so in love with Rose but I think Rose did a terrible mistake to start dating with Mason since she is in love with Dimitri!
And I also loved that Dimitri was jealous of Adrian, even though she was dating Mason!
Even though I love Dimitri and I think he is the best match for Rose!
Even Adrian understood that she loved Dimitri but Mason and Lissa didn't have a clue!He was acting crazy all the time and the reason was so obvious!
I loved that they build their relationship!6)After the death of Mia's mother, I finally liked her!
Finishing a book in general is exciting.
Now, finishing a *Vampire Academy* book is scary.Perhaps this does not apply to all Vampire Academy books—I have yet to be able to decide that—but what do the first two books in the series have in common?They both have wonderful beginnings.
It might not seem like it, seeing that I’m still reeling from the shocking death at the end of this book, but truly this is how it should always be.
It’s boring to have a huge event at the beginning or middle of the book and then nothing for the rest of it.Richelle Mead builds up anticipation and apprehension.
Rose is still in training with Dimitri and feelings run strong between the two but cannot be acted upon, with both of them being Lissa's (a Moroi princess and Rose's best friend) future guardians.
Some feel it is time for the Moroi to fight beside their guardians and learn offensive magic, whilst others believe its not their place to fight.
The thought process of Rose is easy to be sympathetic with and believable.
I continue to enjoy the vampire hierarchy in this book, combined with the differences of Strigoi, vdampir, and Moroi.
I am excited to continue with this series.
I shall of course have to accept my fate when they start to go downhill, but there's always a chance that by then my obsession will have ran so deep that I won't even care in my lust to find out what happens to Rose and Lissa and Dimitri.I loved loved loved the relationship between Rose and her mother in this novel.
Also, Dimitri was so much better in this book.
On that subject, I really do love how Richelle Mead manages to make a young adult novel incredibly steamy with lots of hot make-out sessions and dirty thoughts.
The first book in this series left me feeling a big Meh. It’s confusing, nonsensical premise was distracting, though I felt in some ways it managed to distract from what was essentially a weak plot and simple story.The same can not be said for Frostbite.
It’s also dealt with differently and in a more realistic way – which is in direct ascension with the growth of the main character, Rose.She did grow up a little in this book, though only slightly.
I, as I ashamedly admitted in my Vampire Academy review, love Rose, the sassy, badass, maybe anti-feminist protagonist.
I also, even more ashamedly, admitted to loving Dimitri, the Russian trainer love interest who is a decade her senior and - even worse - literally always wearing the dumbest coat in the world.
It had to be at least kind of fun.But wow, the love triangle (Dimitri & Rose & Tasha)/love square (Rose & Dimitri & Adrian & Mason) combination was really just the worst thing ever.Bottom line: Maybe those of you who ever made the misguided choice to listen to me should stop now????
4 Life Lessons Stars Spoilers This isn't really a review Per se but more of a run down of what happen in this book.Frostbite picked up right after book one. Rose and Dimitri were fighting their feelings for each other and tried to move on with other people. Which I didn't like at all. Rose kinda started dating Mason where they shared a few kisses. I really loved Mason. I didn't want him to get used as a stand in and that was pretty much what happens. Dimitri got friendly with Tasha who offered D
Every time Dimitri smiled or laughed with Tasha it felt like a knife to my heart and I wanted to end her.
Lissa was dealing with her spirit magic and the meds she took to keep her from getting depressed and hurting herself.
Rose and Christian went after them and Mason ended up getting killed.
Not that I don't understand that Rose was trying to give him a chance because he was a great guy and really liked her but I felt he got the short end of the stick.
I loved that Rose's mom was really there for her after she made her first kill and lost her friend.
4.5 stars Holy shit that was a roller coaster ride
5 Holy Cow ★'s“You can't force love, I realized.
If it is there, you've got to do whatever it takes to protect the ones you love.”"Yes, she was.
I love this story and it truly gets better every time I read it.
I love Christian!
I love Mason!
They are all so wonderful.(view spoiler)[A few times Rose tells things that were meant to be confidential when shes pissed!
Mason is your typical all around good guy who has it bad for Rose.
I love watching her character grow in every book.["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>
This series is BOMB AF.I swear, why didn't I start this series sooner?
MASON!
R.I.P. Mason.That was my bro.
I really wanted him to be with Mia at the end, but...not anymore I guess.All in all, this book was HELLA AWESEOME.Rose is still my favorite badass bitch.Lissa and Christian are hot.Adrian Ivashkov is DAMN SEXY & I kind of want him and Rose to go out.Quick note: I love Dimitri, don't get me wrong.
1.) Age 2.) Protecting Lissa and 3.) They could get together but never have children.
I highly doubt they will be together at the end.
If you don’t know who the girl is going to pick because both boys are so awesome and she sincerely loves them both, then you’re doing it right.
You’ve got the main girl, the soul mate, and the poor other guy who you know is going to either end up miserable and alone, dead, or hooking up with some secondary character you barely even remember the name of by the end.
I haven’t even read the rest of the series and I don’t have to – I KNOW Rose will end up with Dmitri.
If you’ve been following my reviews for a while you probably would have noticed that I rarely reread books.
I’m not the fastest reader so I’d usually rather read new books than reread ones that I’ve already experienced.
However, with the Vampire Academy novels I had no trouble rereading the first two books because they’re just so addicting that you can’t help but fly through them even if you don’t have much time.
I’m going to jump right into the third one which I haven’t read before so it should be interesting :D Thanks for reading.
I loved her in this book like hell.
I loved how she hooked up with Mason in the beginning, Oh man...I don't want to cry, fuck!, and Dimitri in the end.Mason, :'( why?
The Rose I knew at Vampire Academy (book 1) kept having troubles.
In this book, She started liking Mason.
But In the end, because of Dimitri (hate him like hell), she decided that she didn't love him, and realized doing that was only going to hurt them more.
This is a satisfying sequel and I would love to read the next book.
Overall, I loved this book.
“You can't force love, I realized. It's there or it isn't. If it's not there, you've got to be able to admit it. If it is there, you've got to do whatever it takes to protect the ones you love.”  Actual rating 3,5 stars!THAT ENDINGGGGGG!! I loved it so much, and I cried, like a lot.. So the last 70 pages were really good, but I didn’t really like the beginning of this book. The plot was so slow and I didn’t like the whole ski trip thing.I did like some of the new characters and Rose was amazing
The plot was so slow and I didn’t like the whole ski trip thing.I did like some of the new characters and Rose was amazing in this book as well.
I loved her in the scene in Spokane and I found her breaking down super realistic (cried a lot)I hated Lissa even more in this book, I hated how she was unable to help Rose, how she never tried anything, how she dropped Rose for Christian.
I didn’t like Dimitri in this book, he was really one dimensional and on the back ground.I loved Rose’s mother (bawled my eyes out with that scene after the Stragoi attack, when she comforts Rose).
Adrian pulls out all the stops with his Rose flirtations, seeing things brewing between the characters that the others can't, which adds a bit of mystery to who exactly this guy with the perfectly mussed hair is and what exactly he's going to bring to the party.
Stop stealing our heart already.
Tasha Ozera, Christian's bold aunt, is now also on the playing field as a Strigoi attack brings everyone together at a ski resort for the winter holiday, inviting a whole host of characters into the academy world.

A lot of people don't like this Vampire Academy book as much, but it's one of my favorites. There are breath-taking battle sequences at the end, and a devastating aftermath that leaves Rose forever changed. My respect for her grew leaps and bounds in this book, and the series really kicked into high gear both in story and in emotion.
Frostbite continues the story of the main character, Rose Hathaway including her bond with Princess Vasilisa "Lissa" Dragomir, her budding romance with her instructor Dimitri Belikov, and her education in becoming a Guardian.

I really enjoyed reading this book and can't wait for the next one.There was action but that wasn't my main reason for liking Frostbite.
Rose had been hating her mom but as I was reading, I was starting to see how similar they are to each other and I was so glad about the ending that they had.
I liked him in the second book better than the first which was surprising but I'm very glad about that.
Richelle Mead really does know how to write a good YA book that is so different yet better than others in this genre.There were also some sadder parts.
Rating: 3/5Finally, the first review I write for 2015 and it's going to be more of a rant...Frostbite is the second book in the Vampire Academy series.
But unfortunately the things that mildly bothered me in the first book were very annoying in this one.
She keeps complaining about Lisa not having time for her now that she has a boyfriend, but I am pretty sure she would do the exact same thing if their roles were reversed.
Also, Lissa was another person whose behavior was bothering me throughout the whole book.
But the possibility of me dropping this series will increase if Rose keeps being annoying.
In this book, I got to know more of Rose and her life in the Vampire Academy.
And of course, it was nice to finally meet the infamous Adrian Ivashkov.
I totally love his character.
He reminds me so much of Daemon Black.Well anyway, what totally made me admire this book is that it’s way better compared to the first one.
And of course, I love Dimitri more in this book.
I just love that funny mother-daughter moment so much.All in all, the book is great.
“Everyone has light around them, except for you. You have shadows.” OMG, I am really starting to love this series. Is it cringe-worthy at times? Sure is. Is it teen-angst filled drama? Yep, guilty. Is it so much damn fun? HELL YEAH! So this is the book where we get introduced to the infamous Adrian that I have heard so much of from VA fans. He certainly didn't disappoint. He did leave me with one problem though! I don't know if I'm team Adrian or Team Dimitri! TOO MANY HARD CHOICES! Frostbitew
Rose was still a brat and I found myself wanting to slap her from time to time but I still really love the character deep down.
Rose basically gives her life for that girl and Lissa seems to be fairly entitled about the whole thing.
Christian is still a great character and it would take a lot for me to hate this guy.
I know that Rose was devastated but it was hard not to be a little frustrated at her for how she treated him.
It felt a little more authentic to the character and why she made the decisions she did with Rose.
I really do think it was stupid of Rose to lead him on.Dimka is as fabulous as always.Rose is as fabulous as always.Lissa is as fabulous as always.Christian is as fa--never mind, you get the idea.Also random: I don't know who the cover models are, but that is one fugly Dimitri.
Proceed with caution if thou chooseth to do so_________________________________________Read #1:SO much better than the first book!I really liked this one.Rose became so much more mature and gained responsibility in this one.She acted way more adult-like and I think that is one of the reasons that Dimitri chose her.
If I could give this book ten stars, I would.
Frostbite, the second instalment in the Vampire Academy series, is rather obvious evidence that there is a real reason this series is so colossally popular.I honestly don’t know why it took me so damn long to read Vampire Academy...
She’s gotten better than she was in Vampire Academy—she’s grown and developed—but, rather than this making her a bit ‘too stupid to live’, it makes her unpredictable, and fun to follow.Politics Come Out To PlayFrostbite really ups the political game, and I get the impression it will continue in this direction even more as the series progresses.
While Vampire Academy (being a first book) worked as a standalone, Frostbite feels a lot more like a series instalment, but this is not a criticism.
I do love his charm and all that, but I definitely appreciate his character more when we learn more about him (and spirit, his family, Jill, Rose, Sydney, etc.) rather than him being that very typical flirty sarcastic rich type.
Like that Tumblr post (about Disney princess I think), you can tell you're getting older when you agree with the characters' parents.- I'm really curious about how Lissa knew Adrian was a spirit user from him touching her.
My brain likes the idea of some kind of spirit telepathy.- Lots of things are set up that have important roles later in the series like the Moroi fighting with magic, Rose absorbing the effects of spirit from Lissa, etc.
It also seems to me that it would be helpful to know where the heart is in a human body.
If Rose, who's just a couple of months away from having a job that makes it life-threateningly important to know the location of a human's heart, is ignorant of this information, is it really her fault?
I mean, if you get these young children in school, and you know that you will train them for their whole life on how to kill Strigoi, wouldn't you start teaching them where the heart is starting in kindergarten?So, really, it's the school that sucks in this book.
