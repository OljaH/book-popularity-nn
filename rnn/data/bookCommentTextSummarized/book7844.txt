The port quickly proved a safe haven to ships even impervious to Typhoons.Dirk Lochlin Struan is a Scotsman who has spent a good part of his adult life in the orient amassing a fleet of clipper ships and a great fortune.
Joan Chen plays May-May in the 1986 film version.May-May is breathtakingly lovely, descended from an honorable and rich family who made the decision to sell her to the Tai-Pan to have someone they trust close to the source of English power.

John Lee has great accents & intonations & really makes the book come alive.Clavell is most famous for Shōgun, the first of his Asian series, which was made into a mini series starring Richard Chamberlain.
He comes from the early Victorian culture & Clavell does an excellent job contrasting attitudes.
John Lee narrates Gai-Jin & Noble House, too.
David Case narrates Shōgun & King Rat, neither of which is tied closely to the Noble House, although all are part of Clavell's Asian Saga.
Wanted to get a nice concise history of Hong Kong, ended up with James Clavell's Tai Pan. I read Shogun when I was 14, and remember liking it enough to read through the 1000+ pages (and that sex scene with the anal beads?
Lots of cool historical details, but they feel a bit shoe-horned in, and the main character is, well, basically perfect.
At least in James Clavell's mind.
I dunno, still weird to have an unambiguously good character who is basically a wealthy drug dealer that started a war with China to protect his opium trade.
That is what Clavell did in his novels and it's important that one understand that.Clavell was also an ardent supporter of Free Trade, an avowed opponent of Communism and Fascism and an admirer of certain aspects of both Asian and Western culture.
Clavell brought this aspect to all of his novels as well.
They were fantastic stories about marvel-filled adventures, often of a knight errant portrayed as having heroic qualities, who goes on a quest) only in this case Dirk Straun's quest is the never ending struggle to ensure that his company continue to thrive.
One absolutely brilliant book, but I didn't expect this ending, something similar yes, but the way it ended - NO!!
It broke my heart a little bit and I cried, usually this would ruin the book for me, but this one was a masterpiece and I can't say even one bad thing about it.There were so many great characters especially Dirk and his Mei Mei, they were so well suited,yin and yang.
Some books and characters fade with time, but I'm not sure I will ever forget those two.
This is a book I will be rereading a lot in the future.
Nothing, except that what Clavell is doing rather than telling a historical story, is to make commentary on the times, not by addressing what a given period does that can be seen and addressed like many pieces of literature can and does do (note that I’m not criticizing Clavell’s desire to make commentary here), but by allowing the historical characters to think and do things which may not be historically accurate, yet can ultimately serve Clavell’s point on the subject, especially of East/West cultural and political issues, and one with an Anglo-centric slant.
I thought Shogun was his best book when I read it, but found I liked Tai-Pan even more.
If you plan on reading any other books by Clavell, you HAVE to read Tai-Pan. Without its history, you'll miss out on a lot.
He is a tough, smart man that isn't afraid to unlearn his old ways & adapt.
He has a wonderful enemy in Brock & intelligently fights his way through the convoluted founding of Taiwan as one of the preeminent heads of a trading house.
His decendents carry on through out most of the rest of Clavell's books.
trying to get what they want out of China (this is usually purely financial gain but, as we come to discover, not always.) Of course Clavell doesn’t hesitate to push the idea that Europeans of this time were fucking disgusting hygiene-wise compared to most Asian cultures, so you get to learn that for like the 200th time with him.So while there is obviously massive historical context here, Clavell relies on his huge cast of fictional characters to churn up the plot and propel the story for themselves.
Clavell obviously enjoyed writing these and wanted people to have fun reading them, so he takes the time to fill the book with The Good Shit; sex, violence, piracy, ruthless capitalism, war, constant intrigue and plotting, forbidden love, and cool 19th-century fashion like frock coats, cravats, and top hats.
Not the best idea I've ever had.Especially for one who has read Gai-jin (and probably for anyone who hasn't), Tai-pan is a terrible disappointment.First of all, there is the problem with the actual quality of the writing.
Not the crappiest crap I've ever seen, but really - if an author has to repeat the same "foreign-flavor" word 4 times on one page, he clearly doesn't have the most innovative of spirits.Throughout Tai-pan dialogue drones, characters overlap each other in their thoughts, choice of words, and actions - and nothing all that exciting really happens in the overarching plot.
Oh yes, this is the Clavell I remember from Shogun.
Then, a slew of wonderful side characters, the women being beautiful in different ways, but sly, clever and endearing, and the men, varying dramatically from evil to simple, kind to brutal.If you want the general storyline, read the summary.
The book has a story, but you read it for the characters, the double-crossing, the details.
Its about the journey.As any 700+ page book goes, the first 100 pages are a mess of trying to understand the story setup, and the various backgrounds of the characters.
Wow. I felt a shiver down my spine after the last page.
This book indeed is as grand and as entertaining as it gets.
I do not think I will be able to muster enough words to explain the sensations I felt while reading this awesome novel.
All the cunning and strategies involved in maintaining the largest trading company of the time, all the bitterness and rivalries experienced, all of it was astonishing to the senses.Now, off to the next Clavell book with the hopes to be as overwhelmed and mind-blown!!
Its jus an endless narrative with very little to no description of events or actions, let alone much (Zero) historical fiction context.
It’s really only the C19th dialogue that places it as a historical fiction & I found myself drifting virtually from the get-go as I jus couldn’t identify with the characters that were all so leaden.
Sorry but that’s it for me, I can't be doing 700+ pages so 1 star as I mostly give those I DNFI'll probably watch the film at 1 stage & see if that works.....
The Asian Saga: the story of Hong Kong's founding.
The weapons and drinks are constantly within reach as these two duel each other and the Chinese.The seemingly dozens of characters are well developed and fit together perfectly into an epic tale about one man’s indomitable positive attitude, even in the face of impossibly long odds.The descriptions of China, the Chinese people and their interactions with the invading westerners (English and Portuguese both) are very intriguing for those that are interested in learning about everything Chinese.
The ultra-realist personality of the Chinese is quiet opposite of modern western PC thinking - the Chinese are portrayed as being totally unafraid to openly curse the English and each other while trying to get any possible advantage in every situation (fair or not, because everything is fair!).A very fun read, highly recommended for Sino-philes.
Tai-Pan - A "fantastical" good novel, brilliant characters, enthralling story, awful ending. It kept my attention and was an easy read. I'd highly recommend this book to anyone looking for adventure, and a bit of history.
Velmi pěkně napsaný dobrodružný román z doby založení britské kolonie Hongkong. Doba i místo jsou velmi zajímavé, konečně, jsme v Číně v době opiových válek. Čili máme tu střet dvou naprosto odlišných kultur, které sebou navzájem opovrhují - na jedné straně britské obchodníky, žijící prakticky výlučně z pašování opia do Číny, na druhé straně císařskou Čínu, považující se za střed světa. Když k tomu přidáme i řadu zajímavých postav, dostaneme příběh minimálně za čtyři hvězdy.
Pretty much everything is here, giving this the flavour of a historical saga of old with a distinctly masculine edge (Clavell doesn't shy away from depicting violence or perversity).I'll admit that the first 100 pages or so are difficult to get into, as the author flits from one new character to the next, explaining their backgrounds before getting on with the storytelling.
At around 700 pages in length this isn't for the weak of heart, but it is extremely rewarding and one of those historical novels that delivers on two fronts: it not only succeeds as entertainment but education as well.
I can’t even think of a flaw.I loved the story of the hatred between the rivals Dirk and Brok and the way their children are included in it, the love between Dirk and Mei-Mei, the clash of different cultures and political views and of course the cruel fight for the title Tai-Pan. This is a book I will be rereading a lot in the future.
Reading it for a first time was an amazing experience and I’m really glad that I didn’t do it for a couple of days, because I don’t think that I could appreciate it enough.
I meant to start with Shogun and this book was available at the library so I started here first. It was a great story of how Hong Kong was under British rule. It was a great read and James Clavell is a talented author. I plan on reading more of these Asian Saga's.
I'll update a review later when I'm not sleep deprived but to summarize my thoughts. I expected more
There are several back stories involving their respective families, their love affairs, their sexual relationships with European and Asian prostitutes and concubines, and so on.
Also, there is one snippet about perhaps the never-ending theme of Asians being so fascinated with respect to the size of the European main character's manhood: the Japanese geisha were gawking at Blackthorne's penis size in Shogun, and the Chinese servants were gawking at Struan's penis size in Tai-Pan. Depending on one's taste, that may be a good or bad thing.
At least, Clavell is consistent in this respect.Overall, as with Shogun, I recommend this book for those people who are big fans of historical fiction.
Matthew McCormickMr. SchleiferEnglish 9H Period 32 October 2018Introductions of Tai-Pan The book Tai-Pan by James Clavell is about a man named Dirk Struan, an opium smuggler who sets out to turn Hong-Kong, a barren rock of a island, into a thriving hub of trade and British influence in China. However, this doesn’t come without conflict from the Chinese, who want to keep the British out of their affairs, and from other traders, who all want to be the best trader in Asia. Tai-Pan is a very enterta
Back during the time that this book is about, the Europeans believed that baths were bad for their health and thought that fresh air was what made people sick.
Today we have many things that makes life much easier and healthy than life back then, and we are fortunate to live in the present and not back then.This book made me believe that the opium trade was good for England but bad for China.
This ship was captained by Tyler Brock, who would soon become Struan’s greatest enemy.
He soon made enough money to buy more ships and start a company.
Soon after, he fought a war against the Chinese emperor and was able to claim the island of Hong Kong as a British colony.
After I made a deal with a chinese trader, I had to smuggle the money he gave me back to Hong Kong.
Brock’s company was looking to sink my ship and take the money.
The chinese have given me the nickname “The Green-Eyed Devil.” When people look at me, they see my years of experience as a China trader.
3.7 Stars: Historic, action-packed, strategic, and cross-culturally-insightful, Tai Pan is an intriguing, strongly character-driven adventure (escapist) novel depicting an assortment of 'free-trader' opium smugglers their families and fellow-travelers, and their competitive and cross-cultural conflicts as the Tai Pan (the pirate-trader-hegemon...) consciously manipulates a wide variety of well-developed supporting characters in pursuit of his burning-desire: to establish a British-controlled free-port-foot-hold on a small Chinese island just 1000 yards from the mainland: Hong Kong.
И ме е яд, че някога, когато прочетох за първи път „Цар Плъх“, не изгълтах веднага цялата азиатска сага на великия Клавел.
Иде реч за „Тай – пан“, една от перлите в короната на родения в Австралия и прекарал по-голямата част от живота си в Америка британец.
За разлика от „Цар Плъх“, тук Клавел ни отвежда в Китай, или по-скоро на самия вход на необятната китайска империя – Хонконг.
– Дърк Струан, тай-панът на „Ноубъл хаус“.„Тай пан“ бе китайската дума за „върховен господар“.
Във всяка компания, флот или нация има само един такъв човек и той е, който владее и упражнява истинската власт“.
Первая глава первого тома затянута и насыщена именами на столько, что дважды откладывала книгу "на потом". С третьего раза далась. Пока не дочитала до конца третьего тома, оторваться не могла.Давно книга не вызывала во мне слёзы. На столько проникновенно описана жизнь героев, что их смерть переживаешь, как смерть своих родных. И пираты предвстают не как сказочные персонажи из детства, а как настоящие люди. С нетерпением хочу прочесть продолжение "Благородный дом" и " Гайдзин".
The two have been feuding for decades, sworn to destroy each other, despite having similar interests and actually working together a lot of the time.Now, when a novel has a protagonist that starts out being the most powerful character in the book, having immense wealth and just about everything they could ever want, usually that character will fall from grace in order to even the odds and create actual drama for the reader to enjoy.
The book covers the global importance of tea trading and how opium manufactured in India, was bartered for tea to gain global power.
The life and times of Dirk Struan, the Tai-Pan of the largest and most powerful trading house - Noble House as he gambles and deceives almost all of those that he loves & respects, in his endeavour to secure his Noble House.
If you have visited HongKong, you will find this book even more interesting.
There are sections of this book that are a tad long and rambling - but overall, its still a phenomenal read.
Clavell's story of the British assumption of Hong Kong and those early struggles for dominance and fame. Truly incredible insight into the almost cavalier pirates who established the Asian outpost and colony.
