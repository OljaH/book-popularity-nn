When a child loves you for a long, long time, not just to play with, but REALLY loves you, then you become Real.""Does it hurt?" asked the Rabbit."Sometimes," said the Skin Horse, for he was always truthful.
"When you are Real you don't mind being hurt." "Does it happen all at once, like being wound up," he asked, "or bit by bit?" "It doesn't happen all at once," said the Skin Horse.
But these things don't matter at all, because once you are Real you can't be ugly, except to people who don't understand."
A terrific book, even as an adult, but it gave me quite a scare as a little kid. See, I actually managed to get scarlet fever in the first grade, and because of The Velveteen Rabbit, I was terrified that someone was going to come in and force me to burn all of my toys like the kid in the book had to when he was sick. Thankfully, though, medicine advanced beyond toy burning in between the publishing of this book and 1982, so my G.I. Joes were safe.
What a delightful book! 🐰
I'm sure I wrote a review about this book on this site at one time or another.......The review may be lost ---my memories of this book never are!I own it.......Its a children's favorite! *Thanks Duane --for re-visiting of memories from when you recently read it!
Shame on you "Toy Story", you knocked off "The Velveteen Rabbit' and didn't even say thank you. Of course this was published in 1922, seventy-three years before Toy Story, so most of today's children haven't read this, which is a shame because it's a sweet story, soft and gentle like the little rabbit.
The Velveteen Rabbit or How Toys Become Real by Margery Williams Bianco (1881-1944) was originally published in 1922 when she was 41 years old.
One night, the boy's nanny cannot find her ward's bed companion toy so she gets the little rabbit.
Being a stuff toy, the little rabbit has wear and tear: his color is fading, his hay-filled body is becoming out of shape, he is starting to lose his whiskers, etc.
However, the boy gets sick with scarlet fever and the doctor orders the boy's parents to burn all his toys.
First published in 1922, a REAL gem of a classic!
Some children's books should be read by adults. This is one of them. It examines the transforming power of love.
‘What is REAL?’ asked the Rabbit one day…‘Real isn’t how you are made,’ said the Skin Horse.It’s a thing that happens to you…’But these things don’t matter at all, because once you are Real you can’t be ugly
This book scarred me for goddamned life. I still can't get rid of a stuffed animal. Do you have any idea how many stuffed animals live in my basement because of this book?
I watched J.T. in the second grade, and I refuse to read the book because that experience so affected me that I don’t want to relive it.She also recommended the first Transformers movie.So you can see that I was wary about The Velveteen Rabbit but I was finally moved to read it by a chance reference in an essay I read in the October 29, 2012 issue The Nation, the following quote:“What is REAL?” asked the Rabbit one day….“You become.
But once you are Real you can’t become unreal again.
"It doesn't happen all at once. You become. It takes a long time. That's why it doesn't happen often to people who break easily, or have sharp edges, or who have to be carefully kept. Generally, by the time you are Real, most of your hair has been loved off, and your eyes drop out and you get loose in your joints and very shabby. But these things don't matter at all, because once you are Real, you can't be ugly, except to people who don't understand."
What a beautiful and touching story. I was truly blown away by it's originality and subtle message... there is nothing much else to say: it is a heartbreaking story. I cried and cried and just wanted the opportunity to love the Velveteen rabbit forever.
My favorite book of all time . . . .with timeless themes of love and loss. If you've never heard Meryl Streep pitch-perfect reading of this book, or seen David Jorgensen's beautiful drawings, you've never really experienced it properly.
Such a beautiful beautiful story.
During my second year of teaching, I started taking 30 minutes or so on Fridays to read a children's story to my juniors, and then we'd discuss it in the context of a shared letters project that was ongoing through the year.
It never failed that I would cry every time I read this story -- the whole concept of being real as it is explained in the book just moves me so much.
We had wonderful talks about appearance and personality and being who you are with this book -- it's applicable to every age.
With Meryl Streep’s tender narration, George Winston’s soft music and David Jorgensen’s beautiful illustrations, “The Velveteen Rabbit” is an instant classic that children will watch over and over again.
David Jorgensen makes all the characters look extremely realistic, which gives the story a sense of realism and the images that stood out the most to me were the images of the real rabbits, as they look realistic and beautiful.
“The Velveteen Rabbit” is a beautiful story about knowing the importance of true love and children will easily relate to this story as they will feel sympathy for the Velveteen Rabbit trying to find the true meaning of being real.
It's one of my hobbies to read the books which come up in movies or tv series. I don't know why it makes me happy! So, for this one, I have to thank Chandler Bing from FRIENDS! :D I totally loved this book! It reminded me of 'Toy Story' though, my all time favorite animated film!Awwww, the velveteen rabbit! My eyes were almost teary until the fairy came! :'(Beautiful book with some beautiful writings! ^_^
There was once a velveteen rabbit, and in the beginning he was really splendid. He was fat and bunchy, as a rabbit should be; his coat was spotted brown and white, he had real thread whiskers, and his ears were lined with pink sateen. On Christmas morning, when he sat wedged in the top of the Boy's stocking, with a sprig of holly between his paws, the effect was charming.  Originally published in 1922, The Velveteen Rabbit (or How Toys Become Real) is a classic children’s story by the English-A
The skin horse, who was wise and experienced, tells the rabbit about nursery magic and how the love from their young owners can transform toys into real.The scene where the skin horse explains the velveteen rabbit about ‘what is real’ is a fine example of the power that Margery Williams conjures up through simple words." Real isn't how you are made,  " said the Skin Horse.
The narrations, of unconditional love from the boy towards his favorite toy, the velveteen rabbit, the descriptions of rabbit’s adoration of the boy, and the sentiments that happen to the rabbit because of his longing to become real, are powerful enough to make the reader choke with emotions.

This is by far my favorite book from childhood.
My mother read it to me countless times.
I really can’t express what this tiny book means to me.
It brings me to tears every time I read it.
It also makes me pull out my own version of "a velveteen rabbit," which is a little gray bear that I have had since the day I was born.
It's funny but when I pull that bear out and hold him in my arms it brings a rush of comfort and a feeling that everything is right.
Didn't everyone read this as a child? I sure did and I made my mom read it over and over. I saw a post of this today and was like, "holy shit! I forgot all about this book"...So here is my small review on such a wonderful children's book! 5 stars
My children and grandchildren loved this book and I must admit I loved it too.A wonderful classic children's story. Recommended.
“Does it mean having things that buzz inside you and a stick-out handle?”“Real isn't how you are made,” said the Skin Horse.
When [someone] loves you for a long, long time, not just to play with, but REALLY loves you, then you become Real.”“Does it hurt?” asked the Rabbit.“Sometimes,” said the Skin Horse, for he was always truthful.
“When you are Real you don't mind being hurt.”“Does it happen all at once, like being wound up,” he asked, “or bit by bit?”“It doesn't happen all at once,” said the Skin Horse.
I don't think I've ever read this before and it was ever read to me as a child I don't remember it. This is another great book in my search for good reading and stories for my grandchildren.
One of the earliest books I can remember...special place on my "childhood shelf."
A simple but profound story of how one small toy velveteen rabbit becomes "real" (through so-called nursery magic and because the velveteen rabbit is perceived as being real by the young boy who sleeps with it every night and plays with it every day), but I do have to admit that I am actually more than a bit glad I did NOT encounter Margery Williams Bianco's classic as a very young child (for I did indeed and very much akin to the Boy have a stuffed rabbit toy that was in many ways exactly the same kind of constant companion as is featured in the Velveteen Rabbit and quite frankly, I am rather sure I would have majorly freaked out at the scene where the doctor orders all of the Boy's books and toys, including his velveteen rabbit, to be burned because of the scarlet fever infection risk, with the fact of the physician more than likely being right with regard to the need to sanitise and disinfect the Boy's bedroom, including getting rid of certain very much contaminated and germ-ridden toys and books quite notwithstanding).
خرگوش مخملی پرسید واقعی بودن یعنی چی ؟ اسب دانا جواب داد وقتی کسی خیلی دوستت داشته باشد واقعی میشوی .....از متن کتاب
Beautiful illustrations and a wonderful story about how toys become real when you love them enough, we knew that of course but we suspect some might not realise this so it has a very important message.There are some sad bits and it was hard to read aloud in places, but a happy ending!
IT'S MIDNIGHT AND I AM SOBBING DON'T TOUCH ME
