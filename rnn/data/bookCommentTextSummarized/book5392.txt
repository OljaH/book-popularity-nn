"One day many years ago a man walked along and stood in the sound of the ocean on a cold sunless shore and said, 'We need a voice to call across the water, to warn ships; I'll make one.I'll make a voice like all of time and all of the fog that ever was; I'll make a voice that is like an empty bed beside you all night long, and like an empty house when you open the door, and like trees in autumn with no leaves.
And here is the boy's answer, which for me, standing once more as a proof of Bradbury's glorious way of depicting the feeling: "It was because they felt the way it feels every summer when you take off your shoes for the first time and run in the grass.
How many movies have ripped off the "Sound of Thunder" time-travel idea? You'll never know until you read it.Incidentally, Bradbury's intro "Drunk and in charge of a Bicycle" contains all of my email passwords for the last 15 years. Now that's dedication to an author.
a sound of thunder is a collection of short stories by none other than ray bradbury. there's all kinds of stuff in here: rocket ships, space travel, dinosaurs, ancient sea creatures, & all manner of human emotions. ‚ù§ it's glorious. some of the stories were a little on the boring side though, and i found myself just trying to read more stories per day just to get through them quicker üôàthe fog hornquite possibly one of the saddest short stories i have ever read. ancient creature answering the
i feel like the concept was cool but the story wasn't fleshed out enough to be anything good.the rocketa man named fiorello bodoni really wants to fly to mars and he has enough saved for one ticket.

I want to assume that I‚Äôm speaking to someone who has never before read Bradbury and who is considering picking up this particular collection of short stories.
For instance, the best of humankind is captured in the longer story ‚ÄúFrost and Fire‚Äù; here a unique landscape challenges rapidly-aging human beings to adapt or die, thereby triggering a series of wars that are overcome by love.
Bradbury was an eternal optimist, and it shows in this collection.I‚Äôll end with just one more tidbit: Since this is my fifth book by this author, I‚Äôve noticed there are some repeats.
Ray Bradbury's A Sound of Thunder and Other Stories, formerly called 'The Golden Apples of the Sun', jumped out at me with its excellent cover art.
Simple, but elegant in my opinion.Having read The Illustrated Man and Fahrenheit 451 recently, I knew that another of Bradburys's short story compilations would be a superb choice.The title also drew me in, it made my imagination come up with copious images of what the sound of thunder could represent, and that made me smile knowing that books can do that us.
I borrowed this book from my nephew who believes that Ray Bradbury is a poet hiding in the world of fantasy and science fiction.
Having read Ray Bradbury's stories since the 1970's, I was familiar with most of the stories in this collection.
If you decide to pick up this collection, set aside more than the time it might take you to read the story.
These are just a few of the 32 stories in this collection that, if you let them breath in your mind, will broaden your view of humanity, science, and the universe.
I'd already read the entirety of Golden Apples of the Sun, so my selections really came from R is for Rocket.I'd have to say my favorite, or really the most memorable for me, was "Frost and Fire." The world creation and elements of Science Fiction seem to be more "hard science" than Bradbury's usual trend toward the "soft." True, it is all about survival, struggle, and defiance by the species against the environmental norm; however, it feels grittier than much of the Bradbury that I have read.
My favorites from this set include:"R is for Rocket" ****"The End of the Beginning" ****"Frost and Fire" *****"The Long Rain" *****

I either really loved the stories in this collection or I found them numbingly boring. "The Meadow" was by far my favorite though "The Exiles" was a pretty close second. As always Bradbury does an excellent job at critiquing Western society and the way so many individuals go through their life without questioning their existence. The stories that I did enjoy will likely stick with me forever and even if I didn't like them, they were still fraught with beautiful language and vivid imagery.
Bradbury's stories are heartbreaking, fascinating, and just plain interesting. They contain standard themes like love and homesickness, but he gives them new life by putting them into different realms and realities. He writes such a variety of stories that I'm sure most people could find at least one to love.
Awesome collection. Never mind your sci-fi prejudices. This collection has something for everybody.
Ray Bradbury: What a lovely, humane, emotional writer. I read a ton of these back in Junior High, but I liked them even better now.

The book contains a collection of his short stories including my personal favorite " A Sound Of Thunder." The story takes place in 2055 when a hunter named Eckels travels back in time with a hunting party to the late Cretaceous period.
the hunting party was on the search for a T-rex.
When the party comes across their target Eckels loses his cool and fires his gun and kills the T-rex without following the plan.
Eckels retrieves the bullets from the T-rex so that there would be no evidence in the future.
It is one of my favorite short stories.Plot: The short story starts out with a guy named Eckels reading a sign.
Eckels understood and went over to the time machine.
They traveled through time and Travis warned them of the dangers of messing with things from the past.
The two guides shoot down the T-Rex and then go back to the Time Machine.
He came back to the time machine and they went back to the present.
Lesperance is another guy in the short story.
He is very quiet and defends Eckels.Rating/Recommendation: I enjoyed this short story a lot.
It's kind of strange reading a collection of sci-fi short stories from generations ago.
I think the old masters don't get read by the newer generations because they are not able to picture the world as it was.
More the shame for them.This is a decent collection of short stories with one incredible standout, "Frost and Fire".
Imagine if you had to pack your entire life from birth to old age and death into 8 short days.
Would you live every day to the fullest or would you work to try to make the world a little better for the next generations?Another standout is "The Exiles".
I only read "A Sound of Thunder" but of course for such a short story, there wouldn't be a separate book.Eckels pays 10 thousand dollars to go on a trip to a period of time where he can shoot dinosaurs.
Along with two other hunters and two experts, he goes back in time, where he is warned to not touch anything that is outside the "Path" because it could have huge consequences in the future.
(view spoiler)[Despite being warned, he steps in a puddle of mud and accidentally kills a butterfly.
Bradbury is one of the greatest names in science fiction, and I loved reading his stories as a kid and a teenager.
What's interesting is reading science fiction written over 50 years ago, when we hadn't even landed on the moon yet -- how the world has changed from the time he wrote these stories that the ideas seem so antiquated, and yet resonate a bit.
I think my favourite Bradbury stories usually involve Venus (the ever amazing "All Summer in A Day" set on Venus is my favourite short story of all time).
The stories explored within A Sound of Thunder were all wonderful from the first words to the last.
While each of these tales were enjoyable, my favorites must be: 'The Fog Horn' for its mournful undertones; 'The Fruit at the Bottom of the Bowl' for its pervading tingle of paranoia and compulsive behaviors; 'The Meadow' for its belief in sustaining life; 'A Sound of Thunder' for its consequential footsteps; 'The Long Rain' for its torturous adventure of hope; and 'The Exiles' for its nightmarish characters.However, every story leaves its everlasting mark within its readers, so there is no shortage of delight to be found within these pages.
A definite exploration of this book should be in store for every Bradbury fan.
On the eve of a election, a party of rich men purchase a time travel safari to the past to hunt a T-Rex. While the safari guides have taken every precaution to minimize the impact of the hunting party on the past, one member violates the rules and leaves the designated path.
Upon their return to the present the group finds that the world has been drastically altered by the seemingly innocuous death of a pre-historic butterfly.
The imagiary of the mashed golden butterfly embedded in the mud of Eckelsly's shoe still haunts me to this day even though I've read this book a few times.
Excellent writing.
I like sci-fi-esque stuff, and that's what everything in this collection is about, so it's very entertaining.
My favorite story is about the people that live their whole life span in eight days, very enrapturing.
Since the good guys don't always make it in Bradbury's writing, I was anxious to see how it would turn out.
My only critique is that sometimes I would just skim over his paragraph long descriptions of the settings.
I know that is his style, very elaborate, lots of adjectives, but ok I get it that the field of grass was pretty and had a nice sunrise...keep it to one sentence, sometimes.
Sometimes I liked it.
Along with Ender's Game, this collection of short stories is what got me hooked on science fiction.
While these stories aren't strictly science fiction, enough stories dealt with it that it opened new worlds to me.
Whether it was "The Rocket Man," about a man who is never satisfied (when he is in space, he only wants to be with his family, and when he is back on earth, he only wants to be out in space), or the classic "A Sound of Thunder," about time traveling safari hunters (don't step on the butterfly!), the stories can be haunting, exhilarating, or sorrowful, reflecting the experiences we all go through.
The quality of the stories are peaks and valleys. Fortunately, most of the stories are above average or fairly good. The bad news is that there aren't many stand out stories to blow your mind. Well, there are a quite a few that do; the bad news is that you've probably already read them in "The Illustrated Man", "Dandelion Wine", or someplace.Any hardcore Bradbury fan should enjoy this if the reader doesn't mind re-reading or picking through old stories. It works great as an introduction to Bradbury's short stories and early American science fiction.
I picked this collection up to specifically read A Sound of Thunder - one of Bradbury's most prolific short stories.
Needless to say, it didn't disappoint.
Along the way I found some interesting gems like The Fog Horn - an interesting piece of cryptozoological fiction, - and The Murderer - a fun little story about obsession that featured truly outstanding writing.
Some stories, however, were a bit dated and felt more like a Duck Dodgers's vision of the future.
There were a lot of boys dreaming about rockets and girls missing their earthly homes - something I wish was challenged a bit.
Not Bradbury's finest collection. It's been forever since I started (and that might be a hint in and of itself), but I feel like the book started off strong. I remember enjoying several of the earlier stories. About halfway through, during the Rocket Men collection, the stories seemed rather repetitive, cut off, or just...dull.
great collection of sci-fi shorts. contains many classics and some that never got much attention. especially enjoy "the murderer". it's about today. everyone has phones attached to their heads and is talking to everyone all the time. if they're not talking, they're listening to music. one man thinks this is wrong and goes to jail.
An absolutely incredible writer of fantasy! Love Ray Bradbury! I often read his short stories to my students in advisory. Sound of Thunder...The Dragon...The Witch's Door...too many great stories to list!
"A Sound of Thunder" is the best, most memorable of Bradbury's short stories. I remember hearing an audio version in elementary school and it haunted me. I finally figured out which story it was after college when I picked up this volume.
Only read A Sound of Thunder and it was brilliant. So flipping good. I think my heart is still pounding. Going back to the past is risky business man. Step on a butterfly and all is doomed. Maybe this is why my great great great-grandchildren hasn't visited me yet...
