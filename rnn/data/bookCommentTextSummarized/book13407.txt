After reading many Caldecott Medal award winning books, I stumbled upon this rare gem called “Hey, Al” which won a Caldecott Medal and was written by Arthur Yorinks along with illustrations by Richard Egielski.
One day, however, a large bird comes to their apartment and tells them about a place where things are so much better than the life they are currently living in.
I also loved how realistic and colorful the illustrations are as they bring a sense of tranquility and beauty to the story.(view spoiler)[****SPOILER ALERT!!!****Parents should know that the scene where Al and Eddie start turning into birds might be scary for smaller children.
However, while I have indeed and quite massively enjoyed (and am still enjoying) Richard Eglielski's pictorial descriptions of Arthur Yorinks' narrative, I cannot say that I have all that much enjoyed the latter's text, his printed words, the general storyline of Hey, Al. For honestly, what is so very wrong with wishing to change one's life, what is so uncanny and problematic with being a bird?
Three stars for Hey Al (five stars for Richard Eglieski's brilliant and lush illustrations, but only one star for Arthur Yorinks' more than somewhat personally problematic accompanying text).
Al the janitor doesn't mind working hard all day, even though he hardly makes enough to pay for a tiny studio and keep food in his and his dog's mouths.
Since Al and Eddie's home is portrayed as gray and cramped, and they seem to have no friends or activities besides work and tv, why do they want to go back?
Personally, being a bird sounds fun and eating fruit on a lush tropical island sounds better than mopping floors all day.
I love all the illustrations.
The story is about Al the janitor and his talking dog Eddie, and an adventure they have, thanks to a bird.
The love Al feels for Eddie seems so genuine and touching.
I felt a bit melancholy reading this and feel a great need for a “dog fix” which for me means petting a dog.
I like that the main human character is a struggling janitor and how the story shows that the green grass on the other side isn’t always what’s most desired.Much thanks to Izzy, who really enjoyed this book, as reported by Chandra.
Still love this, despite others' negative impressions. Will reread as opportunity arises.
On the other hand, as someone who does not like settling and strives for "more", I'm not sure I like the message that Al and Eddie should be happy in conditions that make them miserable to begin with.
I like seeing that Al and Eddie are working to improve their living space by painting their tiny home.
We have but one life to live, why shouldn't we strive for more?Illustrations by Richard Egielski are nice, though somewhat stiff.
I like the blocking of the scene to show the smallness of their living space.
A bizarre story with a moral to be happy with what you have. The illustrations are amazing, as you would expect for a Caldecott Medal winner, and the story is a good one, if a bit odd. We've read this one a few times and we've enjoyed reading it together.This book was selected as one of the books for the April 2016- Quarterly Caldecott discussion at the Picture-Book Club in the Children's Books Group here at Goodreads.
This book seemed like a rather random story to be telling to kids, I thought it had a nice message, but was a little too weird to correctly get its point across. The illustrations were pretty nice, but I found one illustration especially disturbing, and that picture was of the dodo bird having hands underneath it's feathers, that was just a tad bit too odd. This book wrapped up its point rather quickly and had some weird elements, so I don't think I'd recommend it.*Taken from my book reviews blog: http://reviewsatmse.blogspot.com/2008...
Such a bizarre tale. I'm not sure I really liked it, though I appreciate the moral of the story -- it's more than just being content with what you have, it's about being proactive, appreciating what you have and finding a way to be joyous with it (love the yellow paint!). Besides, Eddie is just adorable. The illustrations are certainly memorable and I can see why they won the Caldecott though, again, I personally wasn't a huge fan.
This is a strange one. It's basically about being happy with what you have, but, I think there are quite a few kids who would draw a different conclusion. Basically, an unhappy guy and his dog get transported to bird island, which is some kind of paradise of waterfalls and fresh fruit, but, they panic when they realize they are turning into birds and head back to their one room apartment. My child would have chosen to turn into a bird. I think I would have too.. lol
**** Caldecott Medal (1987) **** A janitor and his dog escape the confines of their shabby and tiny room to visit a tropical world inhabited by magical birds, only to discover that paradise has a price.
Book Description- Al and his dog, Eddie, live in a small, one room apartment in the West Side.
Soon Al and Eddie are flying with the bird to a beautiful island in the sky and start their life in the lap of paradise.
The illustrations are very realistic and colorful that drew the students to the book in the first place.
This book is also a social statement that even though Al and Eddie lived in a small, cramped apartment in the city and often fought, but that was their home.
If you were a janitor named Al living in one room on the West Side, and if you lived with your faithful dog named Eddie who desperately wanted a little room to run around, and if a talking bird appeared in your window and offered you a one-way ticket to paradise, well, what would you do?Probably the same thing Al and Eddie did, unless you'd happened to finish this book first.
The literal interpretation, perhaps, is that it's better to be a janitor in a one room apartment than a bird in paradise.
Hey, AL By Arthur YorinksThe art working this book is very creative, and realistically drawn.
The birds in the book are highly detailed and exaggerated while the dog was not.
One day a large bird came in to AL bathroom and ask him if he wants to go the a new land.
The next day he took AL to a new land.
The Land of Birds and AL had a Vacation.
With their new wings Al tried to fly home back to the City.
He made it happily home just before his wings gave out and was human again.
Super cute!A cautionary tale about being grateful for the life you have, even if you have to work hard and you don't get everything you dream of.
I enjoyed this tale, but I also felt that it was a bit dated.
Especially with phrases such as "they never had it so good," sprinkled throughout the story, the prose became a bit choppy in places.
When Al and Eddie find a perfect paradise, they feel like giving up their hard work and small apartment are totally worth it.
He and his dog Eddie live in a tiny room on the West Side of New York City.Barely eeking out a living, he dreams of a better life.When a large multicolored parrot sticks his head in the window and tells him he is working too hard and to fly away with him to a place with no worries, Al and his steadfast dog, fly along.Living a life of leasure, Al and Eddie are fine for awhile, until one day they discover that they have stayed so long they are not becoming birds.Begging the bird to take him back, Al and Eddie fly rapidly.
This story is about a janitor named Al and his dog, Eddie.
Al and Eddie go but they realized that “the grass is greener on the other side.” Once they returned home they appreciated everything that they had.
This is an unusual story, although I think children would enjoy it.
This story allows you to be imaginative, which would be great for kids.
The illustrations had a soft tone to them which also made the book look old.
The bird that picks Al and Eddie up is huge and vibrant.
The illustrations are heavily detailed and creative.
I thought the illustrations and text coordinated very well.
Richard Egielski uses a cartoon-like detail to enhance the bright, full colors in the book.
The pictures bring out a life-like feel to the imaginary story.
This book is definitely an entertaining story.
The pictures are colorful and very detailed.
This book is a great reality check for us, giving a serious message in a kid's book.
The story follows the general theme of many children's stories where the reality of experiencing something more that has been yearned for makes the characters realize the greater value of what they already have had.
Gosh, this was a weird one. I don't think I would read it too super young kids, even though the writing is quite basic. A janitor and his dog get invited to a lush island. So they escape their dismal apartment. But they find out that there is a price to pay for paradise! This is definitely a story with a moral.I thought the ending was a little too pat, but it is a kids' book so I guess I wouldn't want anything tragic to happen.
Al, a janitor who lives with his very opinionated dog Eddie, isn't very happy with his life. Mostly due to Eddie's complaints I think. Anyway, fantasy happens, change happens, and we all learn the valuable lesson to appreciate what we have. Didn't like this one all that much for whatever reason. The birds were interesting, story itself kind of blah.
Read my review for ideas on how to make this book a highly teachable resource. http://satia.blogspot.com/2010/08/ill...
The beginning illustrations of the book appear to be realistic, which makes readers believe that Al and Eddie lead rather normal and relatable lives.
However, once Al and Eddie are approached by the human-sized bird, the illustrations take on an obvious surrealistic quality.
For instance, the illustrations prior to Al and Eddie venturing to the island in the sky are all neatly framed, with large margins of white surrounding the illustration.
Whereas, when Al and Eddie are on the island in the sky, the illustrations take up two pages and have very little white space surrounding them, thus conveying an altered version of reality.
Arthur Yorinks presents a vivid, dreamlike depiction of Al and his dog Eddy’s rise to and fall from paradise in Hey, Al. I rated this book a five, because it seems to be an easy read for children, and children can glance at these pictures for hours without feeling any boredom.
Hey, Al gives the readers a glimpse at the life of Al and Eddy, who are dissatisfied with their lives in a small apartment in New York and eventually are offered paradise by mythical birds.
Most of the pictures, except those on the island, make use of grayish colors to add to the lack of vitality in Eddy and Al’s apartment life.
This book is a great book for young children not only for the adventure the illustrations take them on, but for the story it offers.
When I say this book offers a journey to the children through the illustrations, I mean that the illustrations are so detailed that they seem real.
When Al and Eddie are in the real world, the illustrations are surrounded by a border in a box, taking up only one page at a time, and the illustrations are quite plain.
Then, when Al and Eddie enter the real world again, the illustrations return to being surrounded by the border and plain.
Theme(s):Social classes, "Be thankful for what you have in your life," friendship, and "grass is not always greener on the other side."Star rating:I'm rating this book a three out of five stars because the storyline and illustrations were cute, but I believe this story could have more potential.
Personal response:This book was really cute and I loved the relationship between the man and the dog.
Last, I made a text to text connection with the theme of the "grass isn't always greener on the other side." I learned this line from the media and other children books.
•	The author develops the characters throughout the book to become more thankful for each other and the simple life that they lead.
The best parts about this book were the illustrations and realistic in which they were presented: •	The style throughout this book was definitely realism.
The use of two-page spreads for paradise and the confined look of Al's apartment work well.
I did think the story was a little quirky, but it was nice reading a different typed of children’s book.
This is story about a janitor his pet dog who leave their small apartment after a bird offers them a life in paradise.
Toward the beginning of the story, the janitor and his dog are unhappy, feeling that there should be something more in their life.
In this section of the story, the pictures reach across two pages and have more colorful illustrations.
I am speculating that this was to give readers a chance to appreciate the pictures and the paradise that the janitor and dog longed for so much.
"Hey, Al" is a picture book by Arthur Yorinks and won the Caldecott Medal for the illustration done by Richard Egielski.
Both Al and Eddie deiced to go to the place, which was above the clouds.This paradise is so green and all the animals there seem to be birds of all kind.
There, Al and Eddie enjoy their stay until they start to realize that they are turning into birds themselves.
I enjoyed the pictures and the story because it had a message which children can understand.
Al is a janitor who is unhappy with his life, so when a large colorful bird offers him and his beloved dog a chance to run away to an island in the sky they are both more than happy to follow him.
After their stay on the island Al and his dog learn that they can be happy no matter what Al’s job is or how messy his house is as long as they have good friends and remember to always look on the bright side.
This book would be good to use in a classroom with younger elementary schoolers.
But, when they go to paradise, the illustrations are colorful and bright, and the pictures are double paged illustrations, so they are much bigger.
I really enjoyed this book because it had a good plot, and the illustrations were fun to look at and think about.
I think this is perfect for younger elementary schoolers because it can teach them a lesson and get them drawn in with good pictures, and I would definitely use this in my future classroom.
