Finally read this. It was really funny. I know. I'm way too old for these books but screw that. XDAlso, there will be more books! YAY. :DPre-review stuff:Possibly the LAST book in the series?NO.I have been reading these books for so long, even if I'm too old for them. They make me laugh so hard, and this can't be the last one.

"Possibly the last book of Diary of a Wimpy Kid series."....................This will possibly be the death of me.......This sure as hell can NOT be the last book, Mr Jeff Kinney sir!!!!!P.S. And the live-action films had BETTER carry on, they're sooo funny.#devonbostickforeveredit on Dec 3rd, 2013Ok thank heavens it ain't the last book.
He has many jobs to think of, but he is pretty shocked to see his bestfriend having a girlfriend!
That freak him out and he stops spending time with him or rather I say his bestfriend stops spending time with Greg.I thought somewhere in the middle of the book, great things will start happenning to Greg but he attracts the bad fortune on his own.
No, seriously, with you spending time with me, she must feel alone like Greg did at the start of the book.
I'm still laughing thinking of it.
Jeff Kinney is one of the most consistently funny writers/cartoonists working right now.
Kinney has placed Greg Heffley in the same temporal suspension that all great cartoon characters suffer through.
And this is good, because that means Greg never needs to learn from his mistakes.
And that means these books will always be funny.
One of the great and consistently funny things in these books, and especially here, is how adults are portrayed.
I don’t know if the intended adolescent reader will ever see these books as laugh-out-loud funny as adults do.
Greg misses all the things Rowley used to do for him...
Now Rowley walks to school with, Abigail, his girlfriend, so Greg is now lacking the poop-scouting and the bag-carrying.
Greg started having memories of him and Rowley, he was soon missing him immensly.
The following day when Greg was doing his daily reading of Slumber Party Pals, he found the ring.
Greg decided to let bygones be bygones and act like a true friend towards Rowley.
Greg asked if Rowley wanted to sit with him and they became pals again.
The book was okay... Though there are some funny parts, I was disappointed. I felt that the ending was rushed and very abrupt and that Jeff Kinney could have written more... Nevertheless, its definitely worth a try...
Normally I don't like DOAWK books because I find the situations the main character Greg puts himself into annoying.
However, I didn't mind this one.
I think it is the best book in the series because he isn't fighting with his brothers or getting into stupid trouble.
He is just going about his business and trying to figure out things as they arise.
I have to day I enjoy the magic eight ball he finds and uses because it reminds me of my childhood.
Anyway, I am happy I read this book because it gave me a new outlook on DOAWK series.
It's Diary of A Wimpy Kid, so of course it's amusing. Greg isn't getting used to no Rodney in his life and being friendless. The book is different because usually the two are together for tales - here we get him without the friend, trying different things, thinking about family get togethers (cute stuff), trying out a new club at the school, etc. It's better than the last one, although not as good at the first ones.
He hardly believes it when his best friend Rowley gets a girlfriend, Abigail.
He tries making friends with Fregley, but that boy is as weird as he is in the first Diary of a Wimpy Kid book, and Greg fights the impulse to dump him.
Listening to the Magic 8 Ball digs him into deeper trouble, and he's still irritated by Rowley and Abigail mooning around school like they have nothing better to do than stare into each other's eyes.
Jeff Kinney writes two things exceptionally well: humor (the Diary of a Wimpy Kid books are as funny as anything by Christopher Paul Curtis or Barbara Park), and cultural commentary.
**** JANUARY 5TH UPDATE *****Hard Luck was alright, it was a bit funny, but I found it to be a lot like The Ugly Truth, which is book 5.
You see how Greg and Rowley aren't friends (again), there's a family reunion under way, and there's a sub plot of an older character.
To top it off, it ends a similar way to book 5, with Greg and Rowley being friends, especially while Greg is friendless, and Rowley finds out that he is being "used" for something in the end.
But besides the similarities, I found the book to be a pleasant read.
Decent and page turner, but not the hilarious book I expected.
αξιαγάπητο σπασικλάκι σε μια περιπέτεια για χαμένες φιλίες, χαμένα διαμαντένια δακτυλίδια, χαμένους βαθμούς και χαμένα λούτρινα μαϊμουδάκια
The Wimpy Kid is back!The misadventures of Greg Heffley, a middle school student, continue to be a rip-roaring affair striking the funny bones of young and old alike everywhere.
Jeff Kinney is not one of the best children’s writers, but he’s the best inhabiting planet Earth, at least during the time of the release of his latest book.
The latest in the series has been waited with baited breath not only by children but also by adults as well.Continuing the hilarious saga of Greg Heffley, Jeff Kinney in his inimitable style puts him in an awkward situation when his long-time best friend Rowley Jefferson ditches him over certain issues.
Greg is upset that Rowley spends so much time with his girlfriend that he is not there to hang out with Greg.
Greg finds a Magic 8 Ball while snooping in his mother's closet, and for a while, uses it successfully to navigate his life, until it gets broken.
Thankfully, Rowley breaks up with his girlfriend and can get back to helping Greg.
At this point, Kinney could publish a list of kinds of soup and kids would line up to prepurchase it.Weaknesses: These could be decent books if more attention were given to plot arcs and character development.
Greg Heffley wants to spend time with best friend Rowley, but Rowley got himself a girlfriend and ignores Greg, so Greg has to find someone else to hang with. I would recommend this book to all gendered pre-teens and teenagers. One "aha!" I had while reading this book is when Greg went into his mom's closet and saw all of his things his mom took away from him in the earlier books. A thought I have about the next book if Greg and Rowley will become fiends (again.)
this made me lol my god it was funny when greg steped on dog poop
This series is great. I always find myself enjoying the story of Greg and his weird adventures. These books are not awesome but it is a pretty good quick read when you are in a reading slump
I really like this diary of a wimpy kid book because it is really funny. My favourite character is Greg!
Greg and his family were having diner,and Greg's mom said that her family was coming town and that she wanted the family to get along this time.last year their family were having a fight about who should get the diamond ring their meemaw (great grandma) had before she had died, no one in the family still has not found it yet.
next morning Greg wanted to get his magic 8 ball back so he went in his grandmas back yard to get and while he was getting it Greg saw something green and shinny.
Greg and rowley became friends again because Abigail was just using him just to get her ex boyfriend jealous.
I feel this book was okay. It has humor, drama, and so much more. I believe the ending could be better, though. I don't like the fact in the ending Rowley and Greg sort of friends all of the sudden. It seemed like Abigail's actions were magic and it zapped Greg and Rowley to be friends. I would recommend this book to all of my classmates that enjoy funny books. This book is part of a series and I will continue to read the series.

Last Book?Well.I guessed they ran out of color choices. Make the next book orange,pink,or a blend of something.JUST　ＤＯＮ＇Ｔ end the life of a Wimpy Kid :L
When Greg is in the picture, watch out for some hilarious fails!!!!!!**************************SPOILER ALERT******************************** My most favorite part of the book was when he was trying to get Fregly to be his comedian sidekick.
BTW if your life is like Gregs you're in trouble because you got a cray-cray family, a lot of fails, and your friend has just ditched you for a girl that he loves.***********************SPOILER ALERT OVER******************************This book could keep you entertained for over three years, two at the least.
There are plenty of books out there which I missed reading when I was in my childhood or in middle grade, and author Jeff Kinney is one of them.
I began reading this up in-order to unwind myself off and to give a whole-hearted light laughter before I plunge deep with my heavy readings and unusual routines which are expected out of me from this new year.
Tell me, should one have to be a child to read and enjoy a children's book?
P.S: I am surely going to get a brand new 'Magic 8 Ball'.
I woud give this book 5 out of 5 stars because it is a diary of a wimpy kid book and i love this ser
This series is kind of my guilty pleasure.
I enjoy this way more than I should.
It's just great to read one of them every once in a while.
I'm not sure what it is though that I like most about it.
I do love the drawing and I think it's hilarious.
I love how self-absorbed Greg Heffley is.
And I love, most of all, the way he sees life and his deep conviction that he's going to make it big someday never actually figuring out WHAT is going to make him rich and famous.
The book I read diary of a wimpy kid was a funny book.One of the good things about this book is that
I just can't get enough of the Wimpy Kid series! I am probably waaaaaay too old for these books but I cannot help it :) It is evident Kinney makes the Greg Heffley character increasingly selfish and lazy in order to sustain the humor, but that is fine with me. I must ask: is there *any* likeable member of that family? New readers should start with the earlier volumes, since it's getting harder to read the books out of chronological order (this is the 8th issue).
