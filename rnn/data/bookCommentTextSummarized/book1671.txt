Another delightful short story about one of my favorite detectives, Miss Marple!This time, she’s relating a story of one of her earliest successes - her lawyer drops in with a man suspected of killing his wife in a hotel in a neighboring town. It’s a classic locked room mystery, but Marple saves the Day with her clear thinking and knowledge of human nature. Delightful treat for a lazy Black Friday afternoon for those of us who’d rather read than shop!
I am not certain that this even deserves three stars, but I didn't really dislike it, so I will give it the benefit of the doubt since it did make a good point about what we generally perceive about our surroundings. For the record, I did not read the kindle version of this book of 26 pages. It was included in a collection of short stories by Agatha Christie.
I love Miss MarpleThis is a fun little short story. It ties everything up in a nice bow and very quickly! Nice to read if you only have a short amount of time.
Through trial and error, I have learned that the best way for me to read Agatha Christie is to avoid her full-length novels and concentrate instead on her short stories. I'm reading through her Miss Marple stories first. This one isn't as good as others because Miss Marple basically relating a case to someone else, and there are too many instances of "I hope I'm not digressing" and "You're going to think this silly." Miss Marple works much better when she's on the scent at the scene of the crime and we get to watch her in action.
Nice and ShortThis reads like a conversation, which makes it quite enjoyable. Typical Agatha, well thought out and oh so cleverly done.
2.5 Stars
whoa. This is a really really good short story. Go read it.
Short, but sweet :)
The simple complexity in how the murder was committed, astonished me. A suspenseful quick read.
Miss Marple is the best! Apparently I can borrow these individual short-stories from the NYPL for Kindle (yea!). Perfect for when you have 20 minutes to pass.
Miss Marple usually underplays her successes but in this one she does brag a bit.
Even though it was concise and very to-the-point and very short, it didn’t have a really fast pace and the thought-tracking and development of the mystery progressed bit-by-bit which I adored as even though Miss Marple is solving the mystery on the spot, it still had the gradual development which kept us guessing which is difficult to accomplish in a short story but this book just nailed it.
Admittedly, the murder solution is revealed only three pages after the murder is introduced but I thought that was fine as it allowed us to get straight down into the nitty-gritty of the murder and the mystery without any dawdling and without any pre-amble but we were still able to enjoy the climactic reveal at the end.
Miss Marple recounts a consultation by a solicitor and his client.
The client's wife was in a hotel room where the only way in our out was through her husband's room because the door to the corridor was locked.
Only the husband and a chambermaid came in or went out.
But the husband did not kill her.
(view spoiler)[ The "chambermaid".
It was actually a woman who was insane and wanted revenge on the wife because of a car accident many years before.
She became a guest at the hotel and dressed up as a chambermaid in order to have access to the room.

Fabulous, as usualI would recommend this short story to anyone who loves mysteries or the mystery of human nature. This is a very short and very enjoyable little tale. Agatha Christie is the master. She truly seemed to understand the complexities of human behavior.
A very short mystery story that makes an easy introduction to Miss Marple- a favorite character of mine.
Good storyIt was an interesting and entertaining story. I'm glad I read it. I love to read the stories and books of asthma christie very much and enjoy them very much.
A nice, quick short story. Fun to kind of think about and try to decide what happened before the ending.
Classic Miss Marple
The line that no one notices the chamber maid / waitress / waiter is really common in mysteries now - was Agatha the first to use it?
Christie is always a good readSurprisingly this is a short story I've overlooked. Great read for your commute. Miss. Marple's was true to form in this quick read.
A really great short mystery.
Was a cute little short story. I rather like Miss Marple as a character, and that characterization was really center stage.
