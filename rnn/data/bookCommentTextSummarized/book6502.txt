"What a person really is, is only apparent when the test comes—that is, the moment when you stand or fall on your own feet."This is a detective story and thus I rate it considering my enjoyment of the mistery and its resolution -absolutely stunning, so much that, hadn't the last chapter happened, I probably would have granted it five shining stars.
But then the epilogue came and oh God my eyes are bleeding."When you caught hold of me by the throat and said if I wasn't for you, no one should have me - well - I knew then that I was your woman!"Yes, Lynn.
Once upon a time, you loved it all.You secretly long for the war: the excitement, the medical emergencies, the thrills and the danger.
You shall see your share of excitement again - danger and passion, a thrilling life of adventure on the horizon.
If your way leads homeward, then choose this path to a long and quiet life, well-lived...
a life full of quiet, easy murder!If your way leads to places unknown, then choose this path to mystery and menace - enough to unhinge your mind!(view spoiler)[I had to add this one to my 'all fucked up' shelf because man, the happy ending...
Weak plot. Too many coincidences that help Poirot solve the crime. There is little that Poirot does with his little grey cells. The first half of the novel is all over the place and at times it becomes difficult to pay attention to the story. I would place this novel at bottom 10% of all Poirot's novels. Avoidable
Then came a change, as all things human change.--Tennyson, "Enoch Arden"Interesting way to construct a mystery -- all the characters are plausible as the murderer!
Point off for having one of the worst of generally-weak classic mystery romances.
(view spoiler)["When you caught hold of me by the throat and said if I wasn't for you, no man should have me--well--I knew I was your woman!" And no, that's not some masochistic kink: her fiance just tried to strangle her to death.
(hide spoiler)]Also, the presence of the detective is very haphazard and relies on the reader being familiar with the character from earlier volumes in the series.
‘If a middle-aged lady wearing sham Egyptian beads has made up her mind to see the famous Hercule Poirot, and has come up from the country to do so, nothing will deflect her.
What is interesting is that Christie starts off with a show blatant xenophobia by one of the club's members who is deemed to be a bore, but also deemed to be a character of integrity (as shown later in the story).
He politely coughs.Wtf?It's like a bad comedy sketch.What was most annoying, tho, was the ending: As I said, the story is based on a lot of dependencies, some between the characters.
This is a pretty good Christie mystery, but the character development at the end was such a betrayal.
You'll be a happier person, and still know the end of the mystery.QuotesThe thing that was different and that ought not to be different was herself.
It was not the physical dangers – the mines at sea, the bombs from the air, the crisp ping of a rifle bullet as you drove over a desert track.
No, it was the spiritual danger of learning how much easier life was if you ceased to think.
I was really enjoying this - in fact, I was thinking it was the best Poirot I had read - but then there was a three page epilogue which was COMPLETE AND UTTER BULLSHIT which undid every bit of characterisation and plot that had preceded it.Christie had her 'heroine' go back to the man who had tried to murder her, with the immortal lines "When you caught hold of me by the throat and said if I wasn't for you, no one should have me - well - I knew then that I was your woman!"WHAT.
That attempted murder and violence can be so easily shrugged off?It's just fucking unbelievable.

On my second tour with Agatha Christie -- in middle age as opposed to high school -- I find that I am preferring Miss Marple's psychology to Poirot's little grey cells. The mystery itself was interesting, but the female characters appalled me. I could not believe a woman would write such an ending!
There are true surprises galore as things proceed.But there’s one glaring problem that may have been a factor in the low GR rating: Lynn, one of the Cloades, is engaged to dull Rowley, but having been to the war, now she likes adventurers, bad boys, violent men, so picks obvious suspect David, who has anger management issues.
So if Christie was trying to make a cultural critique about how women sometimes choose men against their best interests, that critique finally goes poof.
I don't think I ever would have figured out who the mysterious girl with the orange scarf was, and I had completely the wrong idea of whodunnit, due to the apparent lack of motive for all but two characters.I think my error lay in assuming that Christie had planned a particular sort of happy ending for some of her characters; she does like to tie things up neatly by marrying off whoever didn't do the crime.
After Poirot's scathing remarks about the character flaws common to the entire Cloade clan, I think she intended the ending to be true to character rather than happy per se.Along with the myriad twists and turns, this is a fine example of Christie's ability to come up with more than one solution.
This is NOT one of my favorite Christie's, but it is one that she has not read, so we jointly decided on this one.Plot point reveal below (although not whodunit)We listened to around the first half of the book on the drive home on 1/1/17, and then she finished reading it upon our return.
And what the actual fuck, Agatha, letting Poirot give basic cover to this kind of serious and significant episode of attempted murder.
لا تدع هذه الرواية تفوتك..أول رواية أقرءها ل أجاثا كريستي..مثيرةرائعةمشوقةكلاسيكيةابداع قصصي من يد كاتبة محترفة..تستحق 5 نجوم وأكثر..
فإن هذه الرواية هي أفضل أعمال أغاثا كريستي على الإطلاق.أروع ما في الرواية ليس جانب الجريمة، إنَّما الجانب الإنساني، وطريقة الصّراع "من تحت الطاولة" الجاري بين أفراد العائلة.
غالباً ما تدور هذه النزاعات بملاسناتٍ ذكية غير مباشرة ممتعةٍ جداً، حيث يكون جميع المتحادثين يعرفون أن الطرف الآخر لا يطيق النظر إليهم، إلا أنهم جميعاً مُضطرَّون إلى الجلوس على طاولةٍ واحدةٍ احتراماً للتقاليد الاجتماعية والتزاماً بها، كما في محادثة ديفيد ولين في بداية الرواية.
من اللحظة الأولى وحتى السطر الأخير، تعيش في الرواية جواً لا يوصف من التشويق والإثارة في جميع الجوانب، إنسانية واجتماعية وفلسفية وقصصية.لكلّ تلك الأسباب، فإنني أشدد على قناعتي بأن رواية "ركوب التيار" هي أعظم أعمال أغاثا كريستي على الإطلاق، وهي لتستحقّ أن تصنف كواحدةٍ من أفضل الروايات في التاريخ!
You know, it was going great until Lynn realizes she's in love with the guy who tried to murder her while he's in the process of strangling her. That put the super-racist old lady in the shade.
Gordon Cloade marries a beautiful young widow, and several weeks later is dead. He is killed in the London Blitz and the now twice-widowed Mrs. Underhay finds herself in soul posession of the incredible Cloade family fortune. His death, however, is not the mystery. The mystery begins when Mr. Cloade's sister-in-law pays a visit to Hercule Poirot. She insists she has been warned by 'spirits unknown' that Mrs. Underhay's first husband is in fact still alive. Poirot finds himself more mystefied by this woman's purpose and accusation than he does by the situation at hand. Classic Poirot. Ate it up.
Nisam pogodila ubicu, a to je najvažnije :D Jeste da je glavni razlog silovanje dotadašnje karakterizacije likova u poslednjih desetak strana, al ne mari.
I had read this book before (who knows when) so I already knew one of the most important plot points in the story.
What I didn't remember was how brilliant the book was, specially the "after the war" setting with the many changes that it brought to England.
I think this is the first book where Dame Christie really showcases how badly Britain ended up after WWII.
Ration books, very high taxes, lack of jobs, you name it.
Although as usual most of the people portrayed in the book were gentry, you can tell they are not living up to the standards they once knew.
Not my favourite on tv - not my favourite book... Still loving Christie-mysteries and got the next one lined up 😊
I'm not so prim or PC that I can't read an Agatha Christie book without acknowledging it was a product of its time, however considering today's problem with domestic violence, and the new understanding of all the definitions of how Domestic Violence can be defined, "Taken at the Flood" has a very not-politically-correct ending.
A good man will walk away, if the choice is violence against the woman they love.
Agatha Christie, in her book "Taken at the Flood" reflects the misinterpretation of unacceptable domestic violence as OK; and hints that the man who the character once thought of as boring, is suddenly interesting.
At this point I felt my suspicions were confirmed – but try as I might I couldn’t quite see the full picture, despite Poirot’s infuriating hints.It would not be a spoiler to say there is great significance in the title (no connection with water, by the way) – and this is definitely one of those books for which close attention to, and extrapolation of, the first few pages pays off.In my eagerness to discover if I was right about the crime, I fell victim to the old maxim – more haste, less speed.
10/10 for the book.
I really liked this book, it was written in non-typical Agatha Christie style. It didn't start by someone showing up to Poirot, telling their story, and then he does all his investigating. You get to see the background of all the characters, and once again, she caught me off guard. I was kept guessing till the end and it wasn't the way I thought it would be.
And finally Lionel and Katherine Cloade.Readers quickly find out that Lynn is back from being part of the Women's Royal Naval Service and finds herself feeling adrift from her family and Rowley.Lynn's mother is still not quite recovered from what took place during the war and finds herself almost penniless.Rowley stayed behind to manage his farm while his best friend and co-owner of the farm went off to war and died.
Probably because she goes around acting as if her family is awful for daring to ask for help though I would say that Gordon Cloade was at fault for ensuring that his family came to him for every little thing because he liked it that way.I had tons of sympathy for the character of Rowley until one action wiped that all out.
Het boek krijgt vijf sterren voor dit citaat: "'Misschien is het wel zelfmoord,' veronderstelde Beatrice hoopvol.Hoofdinspecteur Spence nam maar niet de moeite haar uit te leggen dat een zelfmoordenaar gewoonlijk niet met een tang zijn eigen achterhoofd insloeg."Helaas krijgt het vier sterren aftrek voor de boodschap die het de lezer aan het einde meegeeft.
Wegens spoilers zal ik niet vermelden welk personage dit uitspreekt:"'Toen je me bij de keel greep, besefte ik pas wat een idioot ik ben geweest!
Toen wist ik pas goed dat ik nooit een ander zou kunnen toebehoren en dat ik - nou, dat ik jouw vrouw was!'"
How crafty you are Agatha Christie ?! This detective story is absolutely stunning , it makes me feel dizzy ,espicially the last part!
Two years later, Poirot receives a strange visit from one of the Cloade family of Warmsley Vale who has received a message from the spirit world that Robert Underhay is not really dead.
Christie then takes the story to Warmsley Vale, and introduces the Cloade family.
It seems that all of them were financially dependent on Gordon Cloade, and that this young wife, Rosaleen, has thrown a bit of a monkey wrench into the situation.
Recommended for fans of Poirot and for Agatha Christie readers in general - these books may be old, but they're still worth reading.
Her millionaire uncle, Gordon Cloade, died in London during the Blitz shortly after marrying a 25-year-old Irish widow, the erstwhile Rosaleen Underhay.
At her irascible brother’s direction, the new Mrs. Cloade begins to cut off the many Cloade relatives who were long encouraged to rely on generous Uncle Gordon — the perfect invitation to murder in an Agatha Christie novel.
He had attempted to blackmail Rosaleen’s resentful and controlling brother David Hunter, claiming that Rosaleen’s first husband isn’t dead at all, making Rosaleen’s second marriage — and her claim to the Cloade fortune — invalid.
Die junge Witwe wird nun von allen Seiten bedrängt, dunkle Geheimnisse werden gelüftet, Erpresser tauchen auf, Morde geschehen - bis am Ende Hercule Poirot die Fäden entwirrt und den wahren Täter enttarnt.Der Todeswirbel aus der Hercul-Poirot-Reihe von Agatha Christie stammt aus dem Jahr 1948.Hercule Poirot spielt in diesem Krimi nur eine untergeordnete Nebenrolle und tritt eigentlich kaum in Erscheinung.
Auch die Auflösung der verschiedenen Geheimnisse und der Morde haben mir ausgesprochen gut gefallen.
die letzten zwei Seiten haben mir persönlich überhaupt nicht gefallen, und ich konnte dies auch so nicht mit dem Meister-Detektiv in Einklang bringen.
They are the things Christie does well- an interesting field of suspects.
This is the set-up for a 5-star Christie book.However, the thing that knocks it from 5 to 4 for me is that the "twist" regarding Rosaleen toward the end is alluded to a few too many times to be surprising at all.
The protagonist seems victimized, and I found myself angry that Christie would end a book with such a unpleasant character getting their way.
I just think she could have ended the book with the wrap-up of the crime, and it would have been more satisfying.
I like almost everything "Hercule Poirot" but this one has to be one of my favorites.
I listened to the audio book read by Hugh Frasier, and it was well done.
Hugh Frasier is actually the actor who played Hastings in the PBS mystery Poirot series starring David Suchet.
And I have to say, he does a pretty decent Poirot as well.
Ms. Christie, once again, weaves an intricate tale, starting with little tidbits of background information regarding the mystery and the characters.
You start off in one direction, and then you are led through a maze of clues, distractions, and misdirections.
Another great Agatha Christie novel!
