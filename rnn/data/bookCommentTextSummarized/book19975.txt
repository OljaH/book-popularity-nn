Wow that was a great ending to this very fantastical series! I cannot wait to go into more detail in my series review which will be out probably next week. I'll be covering my opinions on all 5 books and then my overall opinion of the series. I am so happy I FINALLY read PJO! This was a "dam" good series (lol get it? "Dam")
wow wow wow still need to get all my thoughts together but wow wow wow full video review coming soon
(A-) 84% | Very GoodNotes: A battlefront ballad to salvation in sacrifice, where willing oneself to weakness wins affinity, accession, and affection.
Kronos has a lot of things up his sleeve and won't let Percy and the other demigods have a break.
We finally get to see how the prophecy plays out, Luke's past, and many other secrets that come to light.One of things I always appreciated about the series is that we see things from all angles.
Filled with action, tough choices, betrayals, and heart, you can't beat that.The book ends with a new prophecy for the The Lost Hero.
Towards the last part I seriously was getting kind of misty-eyed to see it all end but it was so good.
A MILLION STARS! Perfect ending to a perfect series!
Kronos‚Äôs army is gaining rapid strength and the Half-Bloods are having a hard enough time holding the crazy beast, Typhon.
Minor Spoilers Ahead  not like anyone cares I mean basically EVERYONE has read this Me being #percabeth trash is no news to anyone, but I‚Äôve stumbled upon a goldmine of fanart and I‚Äôm very happy here plz don‚Äôt take me away from my happiness.
My heart is so content.This was me every #Percabeth scene (I know, it‚Äôs getting ridiculous):Okay, enough from me, I‚Äôm just rambling now.
‚ÄúIt's hard to enjoy practical jokes when your whole life feels like one.‚Äù 4.5 stars!!
I'll bet you 1,000,000 dollars that this is gonna be the best Percy Jackson book!
It's half-term and we've not had many carers (Celyn is very disabled and gets respite care) so we've had a chance to finish the book off.As always Celyn has supplied the rating and left the review to me.The concluding (well - we could go to book 4.5 & 5.5) volume of the Percy Jackson series continues in the same vein as the previous volumes, though with an added sense of danger and sadness as named/known campers are killed and even PJ himself may be up for the chop.We've followed Percy from a lad of 11-ish to his 16th birthday, so girlfriends are up for debate too and both Rachel and Annabeth are in the frame.The Greek pantheon are a great choice for these sort of books as even in the oldest of writings there's very little about them that's godly except for their power.
THE MINI REVIEW IS POSTED  So actually I have finished reading this book a week ago but I just have the time to write the review today ( okay, I'm lying, I was just being lazy hahaha üòÇ ) I read this book while I was in reading slump and IT WAS THE WORST READING SLUMP I HAVE EVER BEEN IN.
I swear those days when I was in reading slump, I felt hollow, empty and I didn't know what to do and I was frustrated a bit for not being able to read like I usually did and thank God, this book was the book which got me out of my slump.
My favorite of the series for sure! This is a great conclusion to the story, and definitely a book worth the build up of the rest of the series. It is so much fun to see how far our characters have come, and how big their fight really is. Absolutely fantastic. (upping my previous rating of four stars to five stars because I just enjoyed so many parts of this book!)
Man, I loved this series so much! Totally rekindled my love for Greek mythology :) Now I cannot WAIT to start the Heroes of Olympus series!!
Hey so I designed an adventure game which you should go play because I've put a lot of work into it. It's nothing serious, just for fun, but you can see how YOU would do in the Battle for Manhattan! Check it out here.*deep sigh*‚ô•
I just had a number of problems with this particular entry to the series that I couldn't overlook and plan to discuss in depth.Don't get me wrong, The Last Olympian is definitely an entertaining spectacle from start to finish.
Riordan also doesn't disappoint in his inclusion of all sorts of mythological creatures, which are my favorite aspect of this series.This book was sort of unusual in that when it starts the adventure and preparation for Kronos' attack on Olympus is already ongoing, so there's no usual retun to Camp Half Blood at the start, or any of the small events that go along with the time Percy usually spends there.
I was stupid to think that this book would cure me of my slump and not, instead, make me want to reread the Heroes of Olympus series someone please stop me
OKAY I FINISHED READING PJO FOR THE FIRST TIME I FEEL SO ACCOMPLISHED I mean this is soo many people's favourite series and I'd never read it but now I have ! I feel like a true reader !Anyway, I got to see my mans Percy Jackson go from a scared 12 year old who wouldn't breathe in Ares direction for fear of pissing him off to a 16 year old boy who pretty much told all the gods to go fuck themselves because they're disrespectful trash and I'm living for it ‚ÄúShe looked at me, like she was drinking
Okay so this was definitely my favourite of the series I loved how everything came together and all the character development and getting to see so many gods in one book.
He's also super impulsive and doesn't think things through, but I liked how he developed as a character around that.
I just wish it hadn't been hindered by the whole love triangle things, it was annoying, especially since it was boring to make Annabeth hate Rachael when they could have been friends.I also really liked how everything isn't as it seems the entire prophecy, the spy, and the end.
And then, there‚Äôs underwater kissing.‚óè Mighty age old gods reduced to a variety of food (I counted there wasn‚Äôt a single like Demeter said that didn‚Äôt involve the words cereal, or wheat.)‚óè GODLY AMOUNTS OF AWESOME.‚óè Thalia Grace.‚óè Thought provoking quotes slipped in the narrative: ‚ÄúWith great power...
Wake me up later.‚Äù‚óè Nico Di Angelo, the precious snowflake I will protect forever.‚óè The promise that everything will be okay.GODS OF OLYMPUS, I NEEDED THAT.
Now that's a nice thought.----------I'm in the biggest reading slump of this century (or, you know, month, whatever) so I'm hoping a little Percabeth will put me right on track.
I was surprised that most of the book is set in New York City but it actually makes sense since Mount Olympus is above the Empire State Building.
This one has the most of the series.
Compared to the other Percy Jackson books this one was a bit less chipper because of all the problems but Percy takes it in stride for the most part.
It is in no way a downer book.
It's so good to finally know everything, and Percy is a lot smarter.
After finishing the book I thought of how great Percy is, hands down the best demigod.
He put in another prophecy in the end for another series.
And that is how you finish a series!
So they're a couple now. Oh. Okay.Yeah, of course I'm fine!!! Why wouldn't I be???!?!
Finished re-reading this‚Äì‚Äìand yup, it's still amazing.
It's been five years since I first read it, and that ending still makes me tear up.
<3 I will write a longer review at some point.I'll put my old review under a spoiler because it was very spoilery (and oh my gosh I was ...
:P(view spoiler)[5/7/09:*takes deep breaths* Oh ...
FREAKING.
Ahh I'm like freaking out.
Best of the series.
Best book ever!!!
Wow, I finished reading it during study.
:D*** just a few little spoilers cuz i can't resist****ooh.
^_^**okay done!!** (hide spoiler)]
WOW JUST WOW. Easily my favorite book in the series! It wrapped up this series perfectly and gave hints to what would happen in the Heroes of Olympus series! I'm definitely a little in love with Percy now and have a total girl crush on Annabeth and those last couple of pages killed me (in a good way). I'm so glad I finished this series and I can't wait to start the Heroes of Olympus next year!
SHIT WHAT A FINALE PROBABLY MY FAVOURITE INSTALLMENT IN THE SERIES
One day I was very busy, couldn't get enough time to read.
I started this book two days ago and this was soo much full of action!
So Percy and his camp-mates try to protect Olympus while the gods are busy in fighting with Typhon.=> This book was dark.
I will must start the next series in a day or two but not now.
I want to read some light stuff before starting the series.Overall, I loved this series.
Because for me every book was pretty much enjoyable in its own way at the time of reading.August 1, 2017
‚ÄúWith great power... comes great need to take a nap. Wake me up later.‚Äù I was satisfied by the ending of this series. It's one hell of a fight when Percy coping with his alliance has prepared for the fight destined to take place in The Last Olympian. The fight is incredibly turbulent and makes this book intruguing from the start. There are many things I've longed for since book one: drama, adrenaline-pumping scenes, and NICO ! Frankly, The Last Olympian is tremendously different from the others

Frankly, The Last Olympian is tremendously different from the others.
Every character has their traits, especially the main ones we've seen from the first book.
But one and only reason I took one star out from this review because I thought the ending was supposed to be the real end, but actually it was a loose end planned for the next series which is bound to happen on the same timeline.
After reading The Battle of the Labyrinth I thought it would be my favorite in the series. I can't say how wrong I was.This was it. This was the best one in the series. It was just... epic. Perfect way to end it. Reading last few pages I had a huge lump in my throat. After finishing it, I just sat there, wishing to flip it to page one, and start again. Hopefully I'll get a chance to read Heroes of Olympus soon.
Couldn't think of a better way to finish this series!I took me almost a month to finish this, not because it was bad but because I am revising for exams.The end of this book got me out my reading slump!So sad that this series is over:(
I need it, for that moment when I decide to look back on this series.But in case you have to go eat, or sleep or you just don't care for it, then you can click on this right here‚û°Go the Distance, and you'll be directed to a song which pretty much summarizes Percy's(and basically every hero's) journey.
‚ñ∂ Percy, son of Poseidon(god of the sea)‚ñ∂ Annabeth, daughter of Athena(goddess of wisdom)‚ñ∂ Grover erh..goat boy (protector)‚ñ∂ Luke, traitor who deserves to be burnt at the stake  Son of Hermes(god of travellers and thieves and messengers and...)OH SHUT UP‚ñ∂ Clarisse, daughter of Ares(god of war)‚ñ∂ And Thalia, unfortunate daughter of Zeus turned into a pine tree which now protects the camp.Meet Anklusomas/Riptide(operative word being R.I.P)‚ñ∂ 
It's not my favourite PJ book, but I loved it and I adored the ending, although it was sad.
The fact that Percy was so so focused on the war and the prophecies and saving people (huntin' things the family business....ahem.
Like I said, though...almost the entire book was a battle.
While I LOVE a good sword-fight, I wasn't prepared for the sheer amount of stabbing.
I have a love/hate relationship with series finales...I want them to be sad and powerful but I DON'T WANT THEM TO BE SAD.
(hide spoiler)] I liked Percy's decisions in the finale.
I LIKE GROVER.
3.5 starsI listened to this book on audio and I'm so grateful for that because I listened to it all in one sitting and didn't have to deal with being bored for half the book like I did for the previous 2 books in this series.
the actual resolution of this series was a little anti-climactic to me, but I had no idea what to expect so it wasn't necessarily a let-down.
This series totally ends where you are given a "oh yay it's all over.....
BUT IS IT??????" which is frustrating, but i'm so so glad to finally have this series tackled.
The final installment of the Percy Jackson series was everything that I wanted it to be!!
The Battle of the Labyrinth and The Last Olympian I think are both tied as my favorites in this series!
I reeaaallly want to see more Percabeth though lol but don't we all?
:p Now I just need to decide if I want to start The Red Pyramid or The Lost Hero next, any suggestions?
:D ***Sorry for posting this review again :P The only reason I did is because I just learned how to put gifs in my reviews and I am really excited about that if you have not noticed lol :D
