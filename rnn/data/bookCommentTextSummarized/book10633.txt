If The Secret left you rolling your eyes, try this book instead. Gawain invokes more spirituality and less judgment by focusing on tools to help readers uncover what they really want out of life. She doesn't assume that everyone wants to live the Richistani life, and she certainly doesn't accuse the reader of being too lazy, uninspired, or ignorant to be rich and famous. Yes, Oprah, I think your book recommendation SUCKS.
Shakti Gawain describes that every moment of life is infinitely creative and the universe is endlessly giving.
Creative visualization uses meditation techniques to help shape positive attitudes towards life and change your everyday experience into a more loving and happy one.
It’s fully applicable to the humanity in every age or era.
(And it’s not at all a new age-y cliché!) Essentially, the methods proposed in this book aim to teach (or remind) us of how to (re)gain touch with our higher selves and thus feel powerful and responsible to bring change to our lives...
A great intro to imagery and guided meditations however, I would not recommend this book to anyone who is not clear or certain about what thier spiritual beliefs are. The book takes the approach that 'if you think right, life can be in your hands' and that philosophy has proven itself fatalistic throughout history. There is one great small section on affirmations that can be integrated into changing our thoughts to plant seeds of new growth.
I came across this book years ago and was skeptical, didn't really apply the methods and didn't get any results. After several years and a lot of work on self, I now believe this approach doesn't work for many people due to blockages and ego attachments to suffering. Much of those same blocks are now behind me. I've tried this approach again, and I've had one amazing result which has completely blown my mind. I'm now a true believer.
I think this is a good book to read every few years, and even just keep as a reference book. I recently RE-read it over the holidays -- which was a wonderful time to because of the natural instinct to VISUALIZE the new year and this new decade! A very positive, simple, straightforward guide on setting intentions, goals and realizing what you truly want ~ or maybe DON'T want. I feel like 2010 is off to a great start for me and I also think it's because I read this book again! Great birthday gift too!
This is has been a very useful book.
I've known for a long time that we can rewrite our negative mental programming, but I'd never taken the initiative until recently to start monitoring my thoughts and what I found made me realize how much I needed to "change the tapes".
This book gives a lot of very simple and effective techniques (affirmations, meditations, etc...) I've taken notes and started doing some of the exercises and already feel a difference in my energy level and interactions with the world.
I know I will be working off of this book for quite a while.
This book "found" me in the sense that it jumped into my line of vision as I walking down the street in Bangalore.
It was amongst a spread of books being sold on the street by a roadside vendor.
It's nicely formatted for easy reading, and I have to say...if you put it into practice, you might really be surprised by what happens!What's really interesting to me about this book is how it's written by this new agey guru with an Indian name from the Bay Area and yet it has a pretty huge following in India!
I found this book in a used book store. Within 5 minutes I stumbled across it and it has been a staple since.What I learned from reading this book is how to use my imagination to create the life I am intended to live. No longer fearful and afraid of what the future holds or consumed with what has happened in the past.Looking forward to more fearless journeys.
This book changed my life and taught me how to shape it. It helped me to know myself, set goals, take control of my destiny and make something out of nothing. This is the book that taught me to make a Treasure Map or Dreamboard, long before that was the thing to do. It continues to influence me daily and I return to it again and again.
It explains in simple and luminous terms, how to do creative visualisation.Creative Visualisation is an astonishingly powerful technique of imagining which helps to draw our desires and wishes into reality.Shakti Gawain explains the principles in simple and inspiring terms, and then gives a number of wonderful creative visualisation 'journeys' - imagined stories that you can follow to activate, harness and create with various areas of your sub-conscious mind - and your life!It is a small, slim book, simple - and wonderful!
Creative Visualization: Use the Power of Your Imagination to Create What You Want in Your Life
The set includes the contents of the bestselling book and a 60 minute CD of associated meditations and visualizations.
As the name suggests, Creative Visualization uses meditation and visualization techniques to help change unhealthy negative thought processes into more positive loving messages.
Essentially, these methods are used to clear away blockages and uncover beliefs or ways of thinking that are limiting the individual.
Affirmations are then used to replace negative beliefs with more positive ones.
The theory and methods presented in Creative Visualization are timeless.
It is still one of the most important books for those looking at manifesting.
While it definitely has its fluffy New Age moments, this is, overall, a great book.
For example, this quote from page 10 sums up the book quite nicely in my opinion:"The process of change does not occur on superficial levels, through mere 'positive thinking.' It involves exploring, discovering, and changing our deepest, most basic attitudes toward life."Along with this special 30th Anniversary Edition comes with a fantastic 60-minute meditation CD that guides you through the exercises in the book.
It is a great tool for those who work better when being verbally guided in meditation sessions.
I picked up this book because of a mention in a blogpost on Raptitude (which showcases clear, pragmatic, thoughtful writing) and was horribly disappointed. Then I was disgusted. This book is a stain. It's new age bullshit that will make eastern contemplatives blush and western neuroscientists cry. I don't mind losing an hour of my time reading it. What I despise is the fact that this charlatan sold 6 million books, misrepresenting both Buddhism and Physics in the process.Shame on her.
A universe of infinite happiness and love. Mentally manifesting our physical reality. If you just believe....
At one point the author, talking about being unafraid of self-reflection, says something to the effect of "nothing inside us can harm us." It's a naive dismissal of mental illness, PTSD, and trauma that I found outright offensive.
Just as well, since the nonsense in this book gets plagiarized and turned up to 11 in "The Secret" years later.For anyone looking for genuine visualization exercises, I would highly recommend "Your Illustrated Guide to Becoming One with the Universe", which is both original and avoids the self-centered nonsense of this book.
Anyone who has some knowledge about the law of attraction, creative visualisation falls on the similar lines.
There are some really great insights into affirmations and writing things down.
Writing your goals down or affirmations on a daily basis has a profound long term effect.
Also, Shakti has provided very good meditation techniques.
Visualisation as a tool has always and I mean it when I say, always given me the desired results.
I would recommend it to everyone who is interested in stirring their lives in some purposeful direction and focusing thoughts by means of meditation into producing desired results.
It's like The Secret. Except maybe less offensive.
Is this the book it all started with?
Covering concept of mindfulness, positive psychology, presence, and the laws of attraction while giving meditation practices and specific understanding of the uses of affirmations.
If you have a chance to listen to the companion audiobook in Shakti's own voice, you will be even more moved.This book is about a great many things, and mainly they are all tied to love.What you read here can be applied to leadership, management, and coaching.
I do believe this book is a must read for all those on the journey of self-discovery and awareness.It's beautifully written and a joy to embrace.Blessings and good reading.M
This is what you want to read instead of "The Secret." She's not trying to sell you on the concept (as opposed to The Secret, which spends pages and pages telling you how easy "it" is and how good "it" is before ever telling you WHAT "it" is...) and she offers practical ideas for visualizations that will stick with you and aren't all new-agey-touchy-feely-cliche.
Almost as bad as 'The Secret'. I went through this book hoping to find a layman's explanation of how 'visualization' as a technique for improving your own performance in any field, but I came across a collection of false naive ideas about how to get anything you may desire, without having to strive for it. A perfect instance of bullshit!
ساعت 3 بامداد بود یکی از اون موقع هایی که که غرق کتاب شده بودم ناگهان ایده ای کاری به ذهنم رسید که تمامی مسیر زندگیم رو عوض کرد .هیچ وقت اون لحظه را فرامووش نمیکنم.
Great book with great tools and tips on creating your life through visualization. I will be adding many of these tips to my repertoire.
I have a few goals in my life I’m trying to achieve and my therapist recommended trying Creative Visualization. I like the ideas presented here. I can easily incorporate some of this into my daily meditation practice. The chapter on goal setting was excellent.I found this lacking a step-by-step practical process. I didn’t see a lot of proof that any of this works. Affirmation heavy. I will take a few things in here and leave the rest. Time will tell if any of it works, but it can’t hurt. I’ll keep you posted and keep it positive. 🙂
For me, this and the audio book, are the best grounding available in honing visualisation skills.
The book contains an explanation of the techniques and exercises to help learn them.
It did help having a copy of the exercises in audio form, so that I could follow them easily.Perhaps this book changed my life the most out of any other book.
After completing some of the exercises in this book, I emigrated to a new country and started a new life.
I have to admit, however, I did not take on board many of the spiritual lessons in the book, as I focussed mostly on the meditative/visualisation techniques presented therein.
Shakti Gawain was one of the pioneers in the field of visualization slash manifestation. Her book fits into my back pocket, so that I can take it anywhere with me. Do I? Naw. But, in the beginning, I needed to affirm all the things I was learning - some of them contained in her slim volume - over and over again. So portability was of high value.You may already know the things that Ms. Gawain covers in her book. But why not reacquaint yourself with the basics? It can't hurt. Because practice makes perfect. Right?!
This book is very practical, easy-to-understand, applicable and a real gem, so much so that I can read it over and over again.
As a Christian, I find it helpful in expanding my prayer life and praying with the eyes of faith that "see" and "believe" and "receive".
The concept is ancient, as ancient as man herself/ himself and it helps to put into action our practice of faith.
I wish I had read this book years ago!
But the most important thing is to apply what we know, to relax, visualize and affirm God's truths as He has taught them to me in the Bible as well as in the world around me.
After reading "The Secret" this was a very simple read in comparison with all the same principles.
I am loving this journey I've been on the last few years of self discovery and loving the unique person I am.
Taking responsibility and owning my life fully and completely has truly been the steps in the right direction for me.
I think everyone who has ever questioned their own life purpose or has felt lost and alone should read this.
I love books that teach you how to find the light from within.
Be the artist of your own life.
Will be re-reading this one.
Until reading this book it never really clicked in my brain the power of attitude and mental power we all have.
I have always been very focused on physical health which is important but after reading this book and trying out some of the meditations it is amazing and so cool to feel how much power we have in our visions and attitude.
It made me realize how really I can create anything I want out of life :) Yay I would reccommend this book.
Its a quick read and im guessing wont be a waste of your time.
I love it. and I know that I will read it again and again..
What a load of bullcorn.
