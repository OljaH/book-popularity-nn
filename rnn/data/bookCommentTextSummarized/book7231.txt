This was an incredibly eye opening book. I have always wondered at the Jewish resistance to Christianity.

or maybe this was common?___Six things are a certain cure for sickness:- Cabbage, beetroot, water distilled from dry moss, honey, the maw and the matrix of an animal, and the edge of the liver.// Notice that they recommend a combination of paleo and ascetic.
