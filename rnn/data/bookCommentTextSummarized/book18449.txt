I mean Jem was so sweet, adorable, loving, selfless and perfect!!!
I cried when he said that he wanted Tessa to grow to love Will.
Then I really seriously balled my eyes out when Jem said goodbye to Tessa and Will.

My poor heart has never felt this way after finishing a series; I had no idea it was possible to feel such tempered happiness as well as such overwhelming grief for everyone involved.
THIS is how a love triangle should be written, in a way that preserves the honor of everyone involved.
My puny human heart wasn't meant to process such epic love stories.:(P.S. If you're considering reading the Infernal Devices series, I wrote a real review for Clockwork Prince here, which is book #2.
It contains no spoilers, even if you haven't read the first book.
MY MIND IS BLOWN. I could've never possibly predicted that ending. Even when I thought I knew what might happen, I had no idea. I'm so overly impressed by this trilogy. Full review/discussion video to come soon! AHH. SO MANY THINGS TO TALK ABOUT. UPDATEvideo review/discussion here: https://youtu.be/IiGK1He_AAg
...To be continued when I can read in one sitting. ____________________________________From the synopsis: ...can Tessa choose between the two boys she loves — even if it means never seeing the other one again?
I'm also sorry for my numerous updates, I just can't help myself when it comes to The Infernal Devices!"Life is a book, and there are a thousand pages I have not yet read."08.07.18 After thoughts of things I liked/picked up- Seeing the back story of when Jem and Will first met- I loved seeing a lot more of Gabriel and understanding why he is like he is, not only that but how he and Cecy interact- Gideons protectiveness towards the people he cares for- Gabriel and Gideons letters are HILARIOUS.
To see her character grow from strength to strength and do what is right even though others thought she couldn't I just loved it- Will reading to Tessa in a time of need- Any mention of worms- I've said it earlier, and I'll say it again.

Clockwork Angel Review!Clockwork Prince Review!I have finished this book for about 3 hours ago and I still can't believe the series is over.This pure perfection,this amazing thrilling story,this everything.I have been so caught up with this series these past two weeks and I don't want this to end.I consider myself a fool for not reading this before,for listening to people who told me to not even bother to try this.I can't imagine how can people dislike this,with it's perfectly plot and characters and the awesome writing.At least show respect for this great,beyond good novel.____________________________________________
Many books have love triangles but most of them are nothing like the Will-Tessa-Jem love triangle.
I actually liked both guys in the love triangle (I ship Will and Tessa but I still love Jem).
Loving both guys is just a recipe for heartbreak.The relationships between all the characters was also another part of the book that I love.
When you read this book I highly recommend keeping a box of tissues close by just so you're prepared.Now I must say goodbye to one of my favorite series and the characters I have come to love.
I officially died and went to heaven when I finally got this book in my hands.And it was freaking amazing. Everything about this book was perfect, and it ended absolutely perfectly.And it was SO. SAD. OH DEAR JESUS. I couldn't handle the level of sadness.Even so, still perfection.

City of Lost Souls ★★★★  “I can tell you that the end of a life is the sum of the love that was lived in it…”  Friends, you were all right; not only was the ending of this trilogy not predictable, but it was also perfection. I actually think the epilogue in this book is now my favorite of all time. All time. Out of any book I’ve ever read. Like, that is som
I actually think the epilogue in this book is now my favorite of all time.
Seeing Will, Tessa, and Jem love each other, so unconditionally, is something that moves to me to tears just writing this paragraph.
Some of the quotes in this book are some of the most romantic and beautiful things I’ve ever read.
But, I loved this book so much if you couldn’t guess by the perfect rating.
One of the most beautiful things I’ve ever read is when Tessa heard Jem though his music.
Overall, I loved this book with my entire heart and soul.
He tells Maryse he had a life, and he would have risked it for the people he loved.It's either Will or Jem. There's no real explanation, because there could've been hundreds of other Shadowhunters who corresponded to that description, but here Cassandra Clare is clearly sending us a message so we're taking it.Now the question is, WHO THE FUCK OF THE TWO IS IT?Maryse mentions the fact that his eyes are covered, so she can't see them.
4.5 stars IT IS FINISHEDwell that was a rollercoaster of emotions. of course, a review and discussion will be on my channel :)
less shocking✔I’m going to start a Sophie stan club and none of you can stop me, I love my wife who can’t figure out her worth but is really really trying!!✔I’m actually still kind of sad Jessamine didn’t get More✔Who else would willingly die for Charlotte Branwell, the mom friend who is a total disaster at it because she’s like, ten years older than all of the people she’s caring for✔Henry is a good man and a disaster and I love him but how is he still alive✔everyone got fucking paired off in this book and I want to be mad about it but god damn all of it was cute, all these straight people are so cute tf ✔although I do wish to register my honest opinion that this series has a deeply bi vibe and as such, no character within is truly straightSo, all joking aside, here’s my general thought: all of the side characters in this series are really endearing and intriguing and I find them all so shockingly likable, which never happens.Sooooooooo let’s finally talk about the subtextual polyamory.
beautiful, stunning, heartbreaking and purely a life changing book. READ READ READ <3 ave atque vale The Infernal Devices. Will, Jem, and Tessa... it was an honor..:)
MY HEART HURTS. I'VE NEVER FELT THIS BROKEN OVER A BOOK BEFORE.Words truly cannot express the  greatness  of this art and perfection. The Infernal Devices certainly became one of my favorite series of  ALL TIME.  I can't believe it's actually over. And that epilogue. Cassandra Clare can seriously write one heck of an epilogue no matter how painful they could be!The Infernal Devices has been one wild ride right  from the very first page of Clockwork Angel.  I binge read all three books and I have
Cassandra Clare can seriously write one heck of an epilogue no matter how painful they could be!The Infernal Devices has been one wild ride right 
The Infernal Devices was, hands down, just all around better.
I had no major complaints whatsoever while reading The Infernal Devices.The greatest thing about this series was not the action, not the romance, but 
Though it is true when people say that the love triangle in this series is like no other, I fiercely believe that Jem and Will's bond overpowers that of the romance in The Infernal Devices.
basically lets just name everyone in the book one by one and then ill be satisfied!!!!!!I just wish to complain a little about Tessa's absolute lack of self competence.
Which frankly was a little irritating given that I'm very strongly attached to strong female characters.
But given how much i loved this book im willing to forgive it.I was a little again irritated with the fact that the last few chapters of this book dragged on a bit, but when the prologue finally arrived i was bent over literally suffering from tachycardia from how emotionally distraught the book made me.
“Have you ever thought of ways to prolong your life that are not a cure for the drug?”At that his eyelids flew open.
“What do you mean?”She thought of Will, on the floor of the attic, choking on holy water.
Don’t—you can’t think that way.”“Is the thought of becoming a Downworlder truly so horrible to you?”“Tessa …” He exhaled slowly.
Nor, I think, would I make a very good vampire.

It not some vintage like Clockwork Angel and Clockwork prince.

Spectacular end to a fantastic series! My full booktalk/discussion is up on youtube: http://youtu.be/p7oNhZX_7oo
Oh god. Oh god. This was the most achingly beautiful and exquisitely painful thing I have ever read. But it had the perfect ending. Review to come if I can figure out what is up with my heart. -- Oh how I love Jem… Tessa had better choose Jem!! Or I may not read another Cassandra Clare book again. (Okay, that is a lie. And I admit it. I will always read Ms. Clare's books, no matter what.) Has anyone noticed how Tessa and Will would be too similar to Clary and Jace? If Tessa's with Will, I might

If Tessa's with Will, I might have to assume Clare can't write about different romances.
Because it is clear that she can write about versatile romances.)Besides, I love Jem <33Read more of my reviews on Sparkles and Lightning!
BOOK REVIEW March 30 2013Just give me a second to collect myself.So I can't decide whether I'm happy with the way it ended (because I am) or sad (because I am that too)THANKS FOR THE FEELINGS, CLARE.SPOILERS INCLUDED (YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED).(view spoiler)[Holy fucking shit.Okay refraining from bad language.Guys.I can't even-I'm happy.
I'm sad.First, I'd like to say that although I am a HUGE fan of TMI and TID from the moment City of Ashes came out (because that's when I started), both of these series take two places of my top three favourite series.Okay, okay.Omg. No, I can't even begin to write about this book.I absolutely love Miss Clare.
(hide spoiler)]If the years were offered me again.And the choice of good and ill before me set.Would I accept the pleasure with the painor dare to wish that we had never met?Tessa has to to chose between the boys , but that isnt easy.Most people are lucky to have even one great love in their life.
(hide spoiler)]Let's talk about the epilogue now.That was the saddest part of the book.It was expected to be this way but the words that the author was using made me a sobbing mess.The infernal devices is over but these three people will stay with me forever.["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>
Well, I can honestly say that I did not see that epilogue coming. Insert jaw drop here. Also, I feel like I need to immediately reread this to catch all the details I missed in my hurried frenzy the first go around? And could I possibly cry any more tears over this book? This is my most favorite Cassie Clare novel to date, and I finally see why you all hold it so close to your heart.
Therefore, I found it a bit annoying at times when the book just went on and on about how Tessa loves BOTH Jem and Will, and she will always love BOTH of them because they're each perfect and beautiful and they each love HER so much and they're one-and-the-same because parabatai and on and on and on.
It got a bit tiring.And finally, the end got me very excited to read the rest of TMI with all the little teasers there.
Also, I hope Jem and Tessa make appearances in the last three TMI books!
It'll be more funnier than I intended it to be.)Dear Cassandra Clare,I am begging you to please release this earlier.
Now, you don't want your fans to be very, very sad, do you?PERSON WHO WROTE THIS LETTER: *sips tea quietly*A NOTE TO THE AUTHOR: IMPATIENT VERSIONDear Cassandra ClarePlease, please, PLEASE released this early.
If the world will end in 2012, I will die VERY unhappy since I didn't read this book.
How can you RESIST hot chocolate sauce?!PERSON WHO WROTE THIS LETTER: *runs around like a maniac* *screams in agony* *throws cup of tea on wall*CLOCKWORK PRINCESS, I love you.
AHHHHH. I FINISHED READING IT. FREAKING AMAZING GUYS. I also love the family tree on the inside of the dust jacket... So cool to see how the characters from the Mortal Instruments are literally direct descendants from the characters in this trilogy... LIKE WHOA.TESSA'S ON THE COVEEEEEEEER! :DOkay, so it's only July 11th, and here are my current emotions towards this book:and the cover...yeah, I went there... sexy Josh Hutcherson gifs were the only way to sum up my excitement.Oh man, the release date still feels so far away. DECEMBER, GO AWAY SO IT CAN BE 2013 ALREADY.
I just really like Wales… the whole time period, steampunk feel, and London & Wales setting of this book might be the cause of at least half of these stars.
Luckily the relationships (and friendships) were strong enough to carry the whole book.Ok one more complaint: the plot did a great job of building these complicated relationships and I realllly didn't think the (view spoiler)[whole cave sex scene RIGHT after Jem died was the strongest direction for the story or characters.
And I’m not sure how I felt about the epilogue, but I think I liked it?
But then Will loved Jem and awful lot, so I don't know why the three of them just didn't marry and call it a day.
I thought Jem pressured Tessa into marrying him and guilted her into loving him more.
I would read 9895290 billion books in it, and lucky me, Cassandra Clare is currently obliging.+ I like that there were many answers in this one.
Like the whole thing of Tessa and Will finding out Jem's "dead" so they have sex???
(hide spoiler)]TWO: I still love this series and all of Cassandra Clare's books.
I swear i have no soul but as i was reading that epilogue the pages started to blur and i felt something moist rolling down my cheeks and i realized i'm capable of crying.
It was all so overwhelming, at points the story would get so morbid and i would be like you need to chill you're hinting at things i'm not emotionally prepared for.
Seriously these characters can get very frustrating.
Joel was all over that YASS BOY TALK SHIT SOME MORE.
Fam you sound like you're talking to your pet chihuhua.
