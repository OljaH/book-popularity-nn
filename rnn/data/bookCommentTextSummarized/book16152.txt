3.75 StarsI enjoyed it, albeit not as much as the first one. Regardless, I am loving Eve and Roarke and am having fun with this series so far.
5 Kick-ass StarsI'm sooo hooked on this series. I can't believe I kept postponing reading it. I would say that my review will come soon but it probably won't because I'd have to stop reading to write it.
And, while you are at it, I have a list of items that I would like from these books:1.
But, I definitely heard the "yeeaaah!" in my head.Along with the mystery component, we have a pretty delicious romance going on between Eve and Roarke.
Roarke is a guy who is a bit mysterious, a lot rich, and has tons of hotness.
A giant diamond necklace makes you angry?
Fucking ingrate!Some people just don't know how to accept gifts!All in all, this series is a lot of fun and I'm looking forward to reading the next 40 books.
Eve has to figure out who the serial killer is. This one is offing high-profile, successful women. She tries to deny her lurve for Roarke. Major angst ensues. She admits she loves Roarke and eventually finds the killer. I really like Roarke. I dislike Eve. There is nothing likable about her. I don't get what Roarke sees in her. Yes, she is humanized by her interactions with her BFF Mavis and a couple others, but I still find her annoying.I don't think this series is for me.
5 stars – Romantic SuspenseOkay, I think I'm officially hooked on this series.
After reading and loving Naked in Death, I immediately jumped right into reading this, and it's another great book in an addictive series.I find the futuristic elements interesting, but I like that it's not too distracting to the story and characters.
I can see now why there are so many books in this series, because I don't think there could ever be too much of Roarke!
5 stars!
The writing is top notch and Robb spins an easy to read, dark mystery filled with lots of interesting suspects(including Roarke again.) But I’m just not a fan of the police procedurals and therefore large parts of this book dragged for me.
Particularly when Eve very dryly and very frequently interrogated the many suspects (these parts read like furniture assembly instructions) and in the end I couldn’t have cared less about whodunit.
As the clues take her closer to those she cares about like Roarke and her boss, Eve becomes relentless in her search for the killer, putting everything else secondary.
View review on  Under the Covers I WANT TO MARRY YOU, ROARKE!!!!!I'm going to use this review as an excuse to post more Gandy Candy.Opening line: “The dead were her business.”From that first line, I was sucked in.
Ironically enough, Eve Dallas lives and breathes death.
I want to marry Roarke!
And I want him bad.I loved that Eve let herself feel in this one.
Would it be creepy to say I wish I was Eve Dallas?I can’t wait to read the next one!
The murder of prominent DA Cicely Towers in the wet darkness of a cold night started Lieutenant Eve Dallas on a case involving high profile women and brutal murder.
Her immediate appointment as primary by her commander kept the pressure on – Eve’s assistance by fellow officer Feeney a boon.
Could Eve crack this high profile case before more women were murdered?
Eve’s fledgling relationship with Roarke is up and down as she copes with her feelings, while Peabody is introduced to the series as an Officer who stands out and does her job, causing Eve to notice her diligence.
This series is every bit as good second time around as it was the first and this particular book is one of the best ones. Eve and Rourke are at the beginning of their relationship and Eve is fighting it every inch of the way. Tissues are a required accompaniment to chapter nine. Peabody appears for the first time. Roarke does his very macho thing to protect his woman. All good in the land of 'In Death'. Love it:)
I'm cheating my husband with ROARKE. Yeah yeah, I'm in too much trouble. :D God dammit Roarke. Why are you so cute? :)
4.25 stars!I dare say I loved this one a bit more than book one just because we see Roarke and Eve more established as a couple. I also loved the way Roarke handle those relationship bumps with Eve. He gives her place, treats her as an equal and respects her profession and still maintains his alpha male status. The mystery part is always a plus and Eve is a fantastic detective always so through. I wasn’t really surprised by the killer but I enjoyed how it was played. Looking forward to the next Eve and Roarke adventure.♥️
4.5 stars  He could do that to her, and for her, she realized. He could open little pockets of peace.  The second book in the In-Death series didn't disappoint. If the first one blew me away with its originality and characters (Roarke, anyone?), this second was a solid sequel. The only reason I gave it one star less was because of the case itself, which I found less interesting, especially because of Roarke's low involvement in it. Or, more properly, at first his involvement mirrored a lot the r
So for Eve to admit that she needs him, that she wants to be with him was a huge step in their relationship.I'm not going into detail as far as the mystery is concerned, but will only say that I loved how there were so many possible suspects and that, in the end, I hadn't expected the murdered to be who it was after all.
"It makes me feel like an idiot.
This whole thing makes me feel like an idiot.
Bu sefer yıldızların hepsi Roarke için değil, polisiye bölümü de güzeldi.
Sevmeyi, sevilmeyi öğrenmeye çalıştıkça sempati kazandı gözümde, ama birazcık.Ve Roarke aşkım ♥️♥️♥️ Adam, sevgilisini, yorucu birkaç gün geçirdi diye akşam dinlenmesi için Meksika’da okyanus kıyısındaki evine götürdü, özel parfümlü göletinde dinlensin istedi.
😍😍Devamını okumak için coşup dalgalansam da bir süre ara vereceğim, çünkü 15 kitap kaldı geriye.
Şey, belki bir daha sefere.”“Bu delilik.
Tıpkı onu işinin başında, beyni hızla çalışırken ve her an harekete geçmeye hazır durumda görmekten hoşlandığı gibi.Hayır, daha önce kimse için böyle hissetmemişti; asla.
Kendimi mi rahatlatıyorum?”“Kendini suçlamak, olanları durdurmak için yapabileceğin bir şey olmadığını kabullenmekten daha kolaydır.
I love that he calls her darling.❤ The side characters Feeney, Mavis, Commander Whitney and Summerset continue to shine.
I’m looking forward his back story.❤ J.D. Robb continues to write a strong storyline and the mystery around the murders was gripping.I hope with each book that J.D. takes her time with developing Eve and Roarke separately and together.
There was a part in the book where she had to dress up which is not an Eve thing but she rocked it of course.
He continues to gently love Eve as he waits for the perfect or maybe less than perfect moment to let her know exactly how much she means to him.
4+++ stars.🌟🌟🌟🌟This is an amazing and addictive series.
Eve is rapidly becoming one of my all time favorite heroines.
She is strong and determined, with a fierce dedication to her job as a police Lieutenant .
She isn't afraid to put her life on the line in her job but she still struggles to find that same balance in her personal life with Roarke.
Roarke, however is much more confident in the emotional department and knows exactly what he wants from Eve. I am really starting to adore these characters and also J D Robb's mysteries.
Science Fiction for people who don't like Science Fiction!Glory in Death is the second book in J.D. Robb’s wildly popular, futuristic, In Death series, and just like the first book, it’s an exciting, gritty, thrilling read.
Since I’m not a fan of Science Fiction, I was worried about how well I’d like these books.
They truly do start to feel like real people, and that’s exactly how I love my audio ‘reads.’ Overall, Glory in Death is fast paced, exciting, passionate, and even romantic in a two-steps-forward, one-step-back sort of way, and I loved every minute of it!
🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟Another Great read!!!This one was even better than the first one. I have to say, Great, Great work J. D. Robb!!! I Loved it. The characters are great but the crime and the way it turns out at the end was really fascinating. Eve was great, as usual. Tough and smart. Roarke… well, Roarke was Roarke.They are moving too fast, but let’s see. “We're standing here, beat to shit, walking away from a crime scene where either or both  of us could have bought it, and you're asking me to marry you?" "P
🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟Another Great read!!!This one was even better than the first one.

Eve was great, as usual.
“We're standing here, beat to shit, walking away from a crime scene where either or both  of us could have bought it, and you're asking me to marry you?" "Perfect timing.” 
Other Characters- Whitney, Feeney, Nadine, and Peabody are good.
I am interested in summerset back-story though!!
Overall- Suspense/ Crime- 5 stars romance- 3 starsStory- Well-written / 5 stars Character development- 3 stars (need more background story).
Really good crime thriller enhanced by Roark and Eve’s relationship. I like the slightly futuristic setting. I still can’t quite warm to Eve, but I’ll definitely be reading the next few in the series. I enjoy Eve’s friend Mavis and also the snooty butler!
What makes me the most happy person on Earth is that I heard every book in this series is as good as this first 2 and as there are 30 more of them still to read I will be extremely entertained for quite a while.For what I have read and been told, every book in this series solves a different crime while Eve's and Roarke's relationship develops.
I love to read a series with the same couple because it makes it look more real and you get to know them so well it feels like you're reading about somebody you know.
As always it was a great book. I even enjoyed that Roarke broke down Eve's walls, well at least one of them. They make such a great pair and the ending was also a great surprise as always. Well written and great mystery.
It's like meeting with good friends.
This book we meet the indomitable Peabody.
Love her!
And, even though the library in Roarke's house has already made us in love with it, we find the amazing pool.
Wow!Reread March 2018- These books are always on my reread list.
In this book we have Eve trying to come to terms with the unbelievable rich and hot Roarke and his love for her.
She is also forced to confront her commander’s anger while trying to find a killer.
“Too much emotion.” The new Chief says, and this book is definitely chocked full of it.
Another fantastic installment in this series. I love Eve and Roarke and especially that ending. It was nice to change up my reading and read some romantic suspense. Highly recommend this series.HEA (view spoiler)[HFN. This is a series.

The dead were her business. She lived with them, worked with them, studied them. She dreamed of them. And because that didn’t seem to be enough, in some deep, secret chamber of her heart, she mourned for them.  Glory in Death takes place a few months after the previous book. Murder never stops and Lieutenant Eve Dallas finds herself once again in a high-profile case when a well-known woman is murdered. And when another successful and famous woman is murdered, Eve works quickly to find connectio
And this is where things get complicated because once again Roarke, the man Eve has been seeing for a few months now and who is demanding more than she’s willing to risk, name keeps turning up.
For Eve nothing is more important than getting justice for the victims and stopping the killer who seems to be targeting only strong and successful women.
I love the sexy Roarke and the main reason for that is how much he loves Eve. I also love how he continues to be helpful to her in her cases, his more criminal past makes him perfect for getting short-cuts to help her ;-)  
Let me get those pesky details out of the way and then commence the gushing, mnkay?So the opening scene is once again Eve being called to the scene of a grisly murder.
In book one, he is intrigued by Eve. She's delicate without seeming so, and while the world sees a tough bitch detective, Roarke sees the woman beneath.What woman wouldn't fall in love with him right then and there?
And he lets her live her life as the same Eve as before Roarke, only now she is a protected, loved, secure Eve. Better than before because she knows that he's there for her.
Suspense – 4.5 stars / Romance 2.5 starsStill can’t believe this book was written 22 years ago!The author and her heroine have brilliant mind. Brilliant!As to the romance - I still didn’t like Roarke. Their conflict, above all his behaviour, at the beginning was childish. And I found some of h’s actions regarding the H a bit weak. But I don’t give up hope to like him better.And if not, I’ll still enjoy the hell out of crime suspense!
Yes he is.Eve finds it difficult to turn to Roarke, to open up to him.
It's sort of effortless, not moving through the murky waters of emotion"There's that fang-toothed, dickless weasel."Summerset wishes I had access to hell," she muttered.Who needs a mother in law when you have Summerset?"You're not going to pressure me into taking what I don't want, or being what I can't be.I'm tired of having you toss my feelings back in my face.
"Or I want nothing."This broke and shocked my heart.She didn't care for churches much.
Vivid scenes.The case helps Eve figure out her feelings and beliefs.
THAT ending!!! No time to waste, next book NOW!
With a new a murder case falling into Eve's lap she is once again tossed into a media frenzy of who done it and once again the man she is starting to love is wrapped up into know all the victims.
Another story of murder, mystery, secrets and sexual hottness!!Even though I figured out the who done it.....Miss Robb still had me gripping each page to know what is about to happen!!Oh and this ending.....damn you JD Robb....way to toss a little surprise in the last few words!!
Re-read this one, this time in French edition, started on May 27. I got the book cheap on Amazon fr.It will take forever to finish this one methinks since not on the kindle and my French vocabulary still misérable eh:)Oh, no Roarke here, the French change his name to Connors, gosh! How that happened??? Boo!!This series is delicious!Yup, I want more of Eve and Roarke:)
I am seriously loving this series. More murder, mystery and more Roarke. *grins* But this should be taken in little doses. Need to read something in between :)
