This book is a good example of why parents should pre-read the books they read aloud. This poem starts out light-hearted enough, but I was not prepared for the sadness - and the creepiness - of the ending. I love picture books that illustrate poems, but this one is definitely for an older audience and not for preschoolers. My three-year-old didn't understand it, so it worked out, but if she had understood the ending, it would have been difficult to discuss it with her.
Read out loud by Naomi Atrubin at the holiday meeting of the UU Social Justice Discussion Group. An amazing poem.
A bit depressing for my taste. (A mother freezes to death making clothes from a magic harp for her son).
