He did not write easy-to-read, "tabloid" fiction; his stories required some effort on the part of the reader.The stories that one would expect in any Poe collection are here, like "The Purloined Letter," "The Cask of Amontillado," and "The Masque of the Red Death." Included is one of his many satires, looking exactly like a newspaper article describing a successful trans-Atlantic trip by balloon.
It’s good for scholars and researchers looking for lesser-known Poe works.
It’s good for those who enjoy 19th Century writing.
It’s also good for those who like a variety of really good writing.
Edgar Allen Poe was a very talented but haunted author.Everything that went wrong for him, he was able to take and mold into something inspiring for aspiring authors such as myself today. And even though his words weren't recognized until after his death,at least, he knows somehwere in heaven that his words will now live on forever. Continuing to make a difference.

Edgar Allan Poe, A sick twisted minded pleseant writter that I shall always admire.
Excellent collection of Poe's work. The annotations are a perfect guidance for the reader to understand the context and get the most out of the stories.
