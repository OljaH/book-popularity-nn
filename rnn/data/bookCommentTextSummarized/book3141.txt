The guy in the story gets a major lesson in humility when he goes job hunting and finally finds one stock boy at a grocery store.
He gets a lesson in gratitude and God's love.
But.....üòúI dont know if its because it was written more than 80 years ago where you said "swell" when somebody asked you how you were or what not but i found the forced cheerfulness a little grating.
The heroine and hero's family had numerous gay little laughs about their crap circumstances and made jokes about how much fun they were having being poor.
This really captured the feeling of the early 30's which is exactly what I wanted. It has a run on the bank, a fall from wealth into poverty, and new beginnings. The ending felt rushed and choppy but I loved the book.
This has got to be one of my all time favorite reads. The implications of having gotten to know these characters has had an impact on who I am even today. True value in difficult circumstances illustrated by great character development. I love this book!!!

It was a cheesy plot, but I did like, however, when Natalie shared her Faith with Chris.*BFCG may (Read the review to see) recommend this book by this author.
It does not mean I recommend all the books by this author.*I received this book for free from the Publisher (Barbour) for this review.
This was a cute little book about a wealthy young man who suddenly finds out what life is like for the other half. After his father's bank fails, his family must move out of their mansion and learn to be happy with much much less.He has a difficult time of it. He is helped when he becomes friends with one of his old classmates, Natalie. Through their friendship, he realizes what is important in life.
Probably my absolute favorite GLH book.
Pretty amazing!
A Job-type story where things are going badly, and the character wonders why God would allow such things to happen, and he has to learn to trust God. :) And of course, being GLH, there's a good dose of sweetness. I love how she does romance, and her portrayals of relationships with God.
