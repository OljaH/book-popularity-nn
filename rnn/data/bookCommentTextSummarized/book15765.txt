Oh Chuck Palahniuk, why do the kids love you?
Years and years and years have passed while I have worked in a bookstore and every single year is the same, some kind of cool hipster guy or girl will come in and ask for anything by Chuck Palahniuk, bestowing praises upon his writing.
The hipsters love him.
Brad Pitt was in a movie based on a Palahnuik book, which was about crazy wacky anarchy, which the young hipsters love.So, I finally sat myself down and cracked open this lovely bird of a book.I wanted to like it.
A poem (lullaby) that has the ability to kill people when read aloud?
Since Carl has a few anger problems, this leads to a lot of deaths of people who annoy him as he tries to get control.Streator seeks help from Helen Hoover Boyle a realtor who specializes in flipping haunted houses and who also knows the culling song.
He convinces her that they should take a road trip to destroy all the copies of the book, but her secretary Mona, a witch wannabe, and her animal rights activist and all around asshole of a boyfriend Oyster end up coming along for the ride.
Chuck has never been a very good writer. He comes up with interesting ideas, uses them as a vehicle for a shitty novel, then I read it, and am disappointed every time. I have since stopped reading his books but my girlfriend says they still suck.
Eudora Welty once said something to the effect that Southern gothic works because people in the South can still recognize grotesque.
Chuck Palahniuk may be the vanguard of the post-modern gothic literary group as he can definitely recognize what is grotesque in our culture.
“Sticks and stones can break my bones, but words can never hurt me” is an old saying that Palahniuk dissects and violates with an impish joy usually only seen in 8th grade biology.
Centered around the unfortunate discovery of an old African culling song that can kill when read (or thought) Palahniuk creates a loose allegory that examines how our saturation with noise and our hyper addiction to media has created a blunted, spiritually lethal society.
It's not long before Streator, Helen, her assistant Mona (known as Mulberry in the Wiccan circles in which she travels) and Mona's boyfriend Oyster embark on a roadtrip across the country to track down every copy of this culling poem to protect the sleeping infants of the world from inadvertent death.Like I said it's formulaic, but this just makes it easier to focus on the odd details that Palahniuk likes to toss into the mix.
Δεν θυμάμαι και πολλά από το βιβλίο. Θυμάμαι όμως ότι α) δεν είχα ενθουσιαστεί και β) έκανα πολύ καιρό να το τελειώσω άρα raiting 2,5
Avoiding the big picture by looking at things too closely.
Big Brother filling your head with marketing noise 24-7 so you he doesn't have to worry about what your thoughts cause he created them.
These are the tried-and-true themes that Palahniuk has worked before in other forms in other books and they all come together nicely with Chuck's dead pan, sarcastic sense of humor.
The premise of the book is a little hokey but Chuck's writing is so good you forget that magic doesn't exist and fall in love with the ridiculousness of the situation and you generally don't stop laughing long enough to think twice.
By the time I hit the halfway mark, I struggled to keep reading for an altogether different reason.
I don't have to be beaten over the head with it.**spoilers**  --  **trigger warnings** Then, on page 177 (Ch 29), after I skipped dozens of pages of the same-ol', same-ol' repetition, where no new character development is revealed nor is the plot projected forward, I came to the part where Streater remembers orally and vaginally raping his dead wife.
"It's not rape if they're dead."This is where I stopped reading.Not sure which was more disturbing, the fact that Streater calls it "the best he had" since before his child was born or that he didn't even bother to check on her after he got off with her unconscious, unresponsive form.
“After long enough, everyone in the world will be your enemy.” ― Chuck Palahniuk, LullabyChuck Palahniuk can sometimes be casually dismissed as an oversold shock author who appeals to a certain type of hipster reader who buys his books (and now comics) with a slavish devotion usually reserved for members of an asteroid cult.
He isn't a Nabokov, a McCarthy or a Roth, but he has developed a solid style and voice that is both recognizable and strong.'Lullaby' is framed around two protagonists (Carl and Helen) and their "adopted" children (Mona and Oyster).
It seems like you either ‘get’ his writing or you don’t.Personally, I’ve only read five of his novels so far, but (with the exception of Rant, perhaps) I thought they were all great.Here’s the thing:His books aren’t very long, which means he uses his words sparingly and to maximum effect.
And he always manages to make you feel, be it happy, sad, disgusted, whatever!As a writer, he ticks all the right boxes – isn’t the most important thing to evoke emotion from your readers?If you are easily shocked, stay far away from this man’s books.
Palahniuk makes another social statement(criticism) with Lullaby, but this time with more humor than he's mustered in any of his other books.
The story revolves around the main character who stumbles across a culling song (poem that is used to euthanize the suffering) and eventually reveals more magic spells that begin to be abused by people for their own benefit.
Pretty much everything that happens in this story is totally absurd, which is one of the things that's great about it.
But if you're willing to have a little fun and enjoy some really humorous moments then you'll appreciate Lullaby.

The only novel by the acclaimed author of Fight Club that I've read, this book is more or less an essay concerning the contaminating effects caused by the constant "noise" to which Americans have grown accustomed in their lives.
While I generally agree with the author's displeasure over constant sensory overload, the overt bombardment of social commentary in this book is so over-the-top and unending that it is akin to the "noise" which the author proclaims to so disdain.The author's caterwauling is intermittently suspended to give beatification to the libertine nature of the characters' sexuality.
This narrator is hunting miracles: the Flying Virgin, who appeared in New Mexico and wrote "STOP HAVING BABYS" in the sky with a can of Bug-Off brand insect fogger; the Roadkill Jesus Christ/I-84 Messiah, who restores dead animals to their pre-accident conditions; the Judas Cow, at the Stone River Meatpacking plant in Nebraska, who refused to lead a herd of cows into the slaughterhouse, and instead took a seat and spoke at length about giving up meat, taught its audience a Hindi song, and answered questions about the nature of life and death.The third chapter brings us to Carl Streator, a journalist trained to note details.
Carl diligently writes down the eight-line traditional African poem - a culling song, a lullaby, the book says - in his notes.
But that’s a very simple way of explaining this book, there’s a lot more to it.
I liked the way he talked about people that have problems with excess (ie.
Much like Choke and Beautiful You, this book features a character who has a scheme of making money that is dark and twisted.
It’s great stuff.
Chuck writes about a modern world where people are dysphoric and depressed and they want what they think is there’s.
Our world of ultra-consumerism has created a society of people going me me me with no end in sight and Chuck paints this picture exceptionally well.
'Warning, if you have read this book and suffer bleeding hemorrhoids caused by sudden outbursts of laughter you may be eligible to participate in a class action law suit'.A childrens poem that has been quietly causing the death of infants, children, and their parents, turns out to be an ancient African culling song.
go on a mission to find all the books containing the story and destroy them before they can do any more damage.
And since they have memorized the culling song themselves, their bigger battle has become, not killing everyone who annoys them along the way.I think Lullaby has become one of my favorite Palahniuk books.
Another awesome written insanity by the Master of the odd and insane! After reading 4 Palahniuk's nearly back to back, I've noticed small little connections. I believe he is subtlety connecting all his stories...and building one crazy world, one book at a time. Spellbound!5 stars!
When he learns the power of the spell, and the damage it can do, he sets out with some other very interesting characters, to remove this poem/spell from every library and bookstore in the country.In my opinion, the power of Palahniuk's style is in his use of repeated phrases.
This book was about the power of words and the power of humans to change the world (good and bad).
The writing was very raw, enough to make me cringe at times, but I still enjoyed the overall story.
But it continues to mystify, and then reveal those mystifications at odd moment throughout the novel, with the final twist being held off until the last few pages.If you're looking for a quick, easy summer read and something a little edgier than a romance, feel good story, or chick lit, this is a quick and dirty book I would recommend reading, particularly if you liked Fight Club or you're looking for something out of the ordinary.My tolerance for "ickiness" seems to be much higher than some of my book club members because the overwhelming response to this book was that there were some really despicable and graphically descriptive parts (despicable characters and a lot more description of dead/damaged bodies than some people cared for).
მართალია, თავიდან კუს ნაბიჯებით მივბობღავდი, მაგრამ ბოლოს ისეთი საინტერესო და ჩამთრევი აღმოჩნდა, სულ დამავიწყა დასაწერი რომ მაქვს 1000 სიტყვიანი ესე (არადა, ჩემი მომავალი გარკვეულწილად ამაზეა დამოკიდებული). ჰოდა, იმის თქმა მინდოდა, რომ მომხიბლე, ჩაკ, ძალიან მომხიბლე.
After reading Lullaby, I'm officially a member of the Cult.Chuck, you are to me what Oprah Winfrey is to Josh Nichols.
The premise of this book caught my attention: People are being killed using an ancient 'culling song', a tribal spell sang to the old or infirmed to put them to sleep...
What I got was a rollercoaster of a book that was one of the most inventive and original novels I'd read in a while.
The culling song is just one aspect in this twister of a tale.
I don't really want to give much away because I went into this book blind and found not knowing anything made it that more enjoyable.
It's been a few years since I read this book but I just happened to see it in my recommendations and wanted to nip this in the bud before GoodReads decided to do me anymore favors.
So over-the-top and ridiculous with such a thin plot; I have no idea what possessed me to finish it, but I did and I put it in a donation box and sent that sucker to Goodwill for some other poor fool with liars for friends to pick up.
Divertente e terribilmente reale. Diventa forse un po' troppo confuso alla fine, ma comunque un ottimo libro, indubbiamente superiore a Fight Club. Sublime il personaggio di Helen Hoover Boyle.
Bir Chuck Palahniuk kitabı için zayıf buldum.
Ahmet Ümit falan okuyun:)Bir adam var.
Ve defterde yazılı bir büyü.
Hani insanın diline dandik bir şarkı takılır da söylemeden duramaz ya.
İşte zavallı Carl da bu şekilde büssürü insan öldürmüş.
Ve maalesef bu kişilere küçücük bebeği ve eşi de dahil:) Tabi burada okuduğunuzda (tabi aynı şekilde bende yazarken) insanın içi parçalanıyor ama Chuck Palahniuk işte böyle.
Bu kadın bir emlakçı ve etrafında sürekli şüpheli ölümler var.
Ve beraber bu ölüm büyüsünün yazılı olduğu kitapları defterleri bulup tek tek yok etmeye başlıyorlar.
Biz yandık eller yanmasın misali.İşte böyle de bir kitaptır kendisi.
“Maybe this is a love story.
Maybe not.”I got to meet Chuck Palahniuk earlier this year at a book release signing in San Francisco for Adjustment Day. Very cool guy, low key and humble.
It was awesome to get to chat with him for a few minutes.Adjustment Day, however, was a bit of a disappointment.
Chucks work seems to be hit or miss for me so since I was a wee bummed about AD, I knew I had to get back on the Chuck wagon and read something else that may be a bit more to my liking.Lullaby was just the ticket.
قصة عن السلطة والفقد، مفعمة بعنصر المفاجأة وغنية بمعلومات عن المجتمع الهيبي الأمريكي لم أكن أدري عنها وغريبة بعض الشيء.
Attention Readers of Edgy Black Writings, of Chuck PalahniukIf you've read Lullaby and have felt bored you are not alone.OKay, so this is my fourth Palahniuk book and I enjoyed the first three so much (Survivor, Choke, & Invisible Monsters)and I was very excited to read this.
Don't get me wrong either I love Chuck, I mean I've read all these books in a row but this missed, sorry.
And it's like I got bored of his writing either because I read RANT after this and thought it was great, so I'll try reading a second time and maybe that will help.
Էս ինչ կարդացի ես??? Փսիխիկաս խախտվավ:Երկար-բարակ չգրեմ էլի: Զզվելի գիրք էր: Պալանիկ էլ դժվար թե կարդամ:Լավ բաներ կային մեջը, բայց զզվելին ավելի շատ էր:
And this book?It’s good.Imaginative, bold, and seething with scathing commentary on contemporary American society and its willingness to be governed by consumerist culture, and content in its indifference and ignorance, Lullaby is a richly padded and darkly nihilistic parable about morality and power, with a dash of hopelessness sprinkled in.It may sound like a downer but Chuck Palahnuik‘s charm lies in his use of language.
It’s really kind of cool.Since the film Fight Club was about all I knew about Chuck Palahnuik, I must admit that the themes and overt messages of Lullaby are familiar.
