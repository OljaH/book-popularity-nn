I know you are supposed to come off as this nice guy but before Maven turned out to be evil I seriously did not like you.
I mean I was totally rooting for you and Mare (*gasps that dance scene*) but I was mad at you for being the popular/likable guy when you were totally secretly making eyes at your brother's wife that you know he's falling for.
If Maven wasn’t in this book I would totally be in love with Cal, and vice versa.
it's like the word "Gold" was just replaced with "Silver" and all the socialist angst was replaced with high school bitchy angst.There was so little action in that first 60% that I literally had to force myself through pages and pages of Mare flirting with the Silver prince - Cal - and the prince's betrothed - Evangeline - hating Mare as soon as she set eyes on her.
I'm kinda conflicted over this book.
It was well written and entertaining, and if it didn't feel so similar to some other books I could have really enjoyed it.
But there were just so many elements that had me thinking, "Yep, I've definitely seen this before." There were also some aspects that felt very contrived, so I had to really work at suspending my disbelief to buy into it.Ultimately, I thought this book was an entertaining read, and I totally get why some people are LOVING it.
But for me personally it was just too generic, and I didn't feel like there was anything truly special to set it apart from the crowd.
this was a re-read for me. my original review can be found here: goodreads: https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...youtube: https://youtu.be/kKQ5jusa8fo After re-reading this, I stand by my original 4 star rating and my overall enjoyment of this book. I want to make it clear that I know this book does not have the most original concept and it also uses a lot of tropes, but I still had such a fun time reading it. I love the characters and the shock factor and the world. I can't wait to give Glass Sword a go and see where Victoria Aveyard takes this story.
This was fantastic! I thoroughly enjoyed this crazy adventure of a book. I will say though that it did take a bit of time for me to really get into this book. I also felt the world is still a bit underdeveloped for my liking, but I'm hoping that I gain a better understanding for everything in the sequel. Other than that such an exciting read, full of twists and turns that will leave you flailing all over the place! HECK I'M STILL FLAILING.
That plot twist though....That betrayal though....MIND = BLOWNRed Queen was fantastic, especially the ending! Wow!
Reviewed by: Rabid ReadsThis book didn't start out terribly. I mean, come on . . . royals with superpowers? And a heroine from amongst the downtrodden servant class? Okay, yes, that does sound kind of familiar, especially considering that said downtrodden heroine is a Red, but beyond that I didn't feel like there were many similarities. And as much as I love  Red Rising  and  Golden Son , I would jump all over it if I thought this book was a copycat. BUT. Sold as I was (at first), the heavy-hand
Okay, yes, that does sound kind of familiar, especially considering that said downtrodden heroine is a Red, but beyond that I didn't feel like there were many similarities.
. To think that Cal and my father, a broken Red man, can share the same thoughts makes me pause.
His evil stepmother the queen uses her mind power to make Cal unsheathe his father's sword and use it to behead him.
Cal likes action, not words."That makes two of us, but I don't want to admit I have anything in common with Maven's older brother.
Actual rating : 1.5 stars► So, this is the 2015 mind-blowing release?  I'm just so fucking bored. UNDERWHELMED is the word. Mare is a selfish brat who can't shut up one second to look at something else than herself. She keeps acting without thinking and gets numerous people harmed/killed.  She's a special snowflake through and through, because she's special you know and nothing can be done without her. She's in a constant need of saving and doesn't even acknowledge that fact. There is a love-tri
*evil grin smirk* (hide spoiler)]⑥ She's not sarcastic but just plain rude and oh so WHINY.⑦ She can't seem to find any redeeming quality in any other woman.
Women authors, I'm not thanking you.⑧ The similarities with Red Rising are just obnoxious.
Say the girl who didn't like Red Rising, though.
People are starving but WHO CARES?
There is a rebellion but WHO CARES?
The Queen can read minds but OMG she can't guess anything?
(view spoiler)[and this is what made the "plot-twist" not at all surprising.
4 1/2 stars. ‘‘You are not Silver. Your parents are Red, you are Red, and your blood is red,’’ the queen murmurs, prowling before the bars of my cage. ‘‘You are a miracle, Mare Barrow, an impossibility. Something even I can’t understand, and I have seen all of you.’’ I can’t wait for this book to become a movie. Don’t get me wrong, I enjoyed this enormously, but I simply know I’ll love it even more on the big screen. That way, we will actually see, in colour and with all its intensity, the Silve
I can’t wait for this book to become a movie.
Don’t get me wrong, I enjoyed this enormously, but I simply know I’ll love it even more on the big screen.
Plus, it would be interesting to see how the author imagined her world-building, for I had trouble visualising it while reading.There are cars and screens and cameras… so it can’t be an historical setting (despite the slight vibe of it), but I wouldn’t think it to be a science-fiction one either… or contemporary, for sure.
I'm sure it's great if you liked Red Rising. I did not like Red Rising.DNFed this around the 20% mark. I hated the main character. Stupid, selfish, destructive brat intent on destroying the lives of her loved ones with all the makings of a special snowflake. I cannot stand selfishness when it involves harming the lives of innocents. I can't tolerate this character. I can't finish this book. It's been a month since I tried to read on and it's just pointless.
OMG OMG AMAZING! I WILL BE REVIEWING SOON!
YAAAAAASSSS VICTORIA YAAAAAASSSSSS. It's like an X-Men dystopia stuck in a high fantasy world on crack.Look, guys, don't worry about the love triangle. Actually, calling it a love triangle is very spoilerish and I wish I could further calm your feels, but alas, you must read it for yourself. Immensely loved this with very minor reservations and I can't wait for book 2! Full review to come!
I enjoyed reading it, but it was so similar to many other YA books that it's not memorable.
That was an intense book and I really enjoyed it!
I am a sucker for superpowers and this book had such a cool variety of them!
It was a little predictable at times and I can see why people say that it's really similar plot-wise to a couple of other books, but I still liked it very much!
I feel like that would be such a cool addition to the book.
her death is very much needed thanks.Cal is also dumb and annoying and has no personality whatsoever.
I hope he finds Mare and Cal and then kills them and then rules ruthlessly, have a good day.
(hide spoiler)]------------that was not a fun experience.also to every single character in this book:…………………./´¯/)………………..,/¯../………………./…./…………./´¯/’…’/´¯¯`·¸………./’/…/…./……./¨¯\……..(‘(…´…´….
_.·´…………\…………..(…………..\………….\…THEY'RE ALL fucking Stupid and I can't wait for their deaths in the next book, especially Mare Barrow whose name reminds me of a hORSE.god, was I BORED and I predicted the major plot twist.

3.5, over hyped but entertaining enough.
So apparently this isn't as similar to Red Rising as I first thought when I read the blurb.
Original Review:(view spoiler)[This seems waaaaaay too familiar *cough* Red Rising *cough* for me to be willing to give it a try.

Not loved it, but it would have definitely gained a couple more stars and a bit more attention from my part.Unfortunately, I picked it up too late, once I've eventually had my chance to read around and already managed to juggle my way out of the various The Hunger Games, The Selection,Divergent, Red Rising and the rest of the merry dystopian brigade.So it left nothing to discover and this book didn't bring anything new to my reading experience.

What a plot twist.

Hmm Team Cal..

Julian was so right!!!

Why did he do that to us??I loved him..

And you betrayed us both, in a thousand different ways.
I am sorry.I see Mare's betrayal and Maven's (obviously)...
But I don't see Cal's betrayal.
Okay!Elara!!!So, what team am I?#teamCal
10% 1984 + 15% Hunger Games + 10% X-Men + 10% Games of Thrones + 15% Divergent..That'd leave us with only 40% of Original Red Queen..Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed it ,I may even held extra +rating till part 2 if it gets more of the Original Red Queen storyline..What really bugs me here was the many Deja vus from HG and Divergent since I didn't like the latter's plot much.But let's see step by step with The Red..The Plot and the Setting--------------------1-10% of 1984In an Orwellian atmosphere of Destopia, we're in Norta, a country that in a constant war with neighbour countries..The Elite push the low class citizens into Poverty..and fight in wars..And to kill any think of a rebellion ,they're watching Everyone, even -specifically- those closed to the king in the Palace.'Camera's are everywhere' and the communication means between the low class almost nonexist..although there's a good technology there.
Oftentimes I find that fight scenes are written in such a way that the author knows what's going on, but nobody else does.
World building is nothing without decent supporting characters.
I knew this book and I would have a hard time getting along when I realized it was written in exhausting, unfunny "snarky" first person, but look at the world Suzanne Collins managed to built through the eyes of one character.
If world building were food, this book would be starving.
And this book tries to do the biopunk thing with the silver blood and the inherited powers but it's all just drugs and magnets, isn't it?
A lot of people were mentioning that this was like a lot of different dystopian books and while I agree, I still think this is worth the read.I enjoyed the world, the magic system... even with the romantic bits.I definitely saw parts of the ending coming but it was still entertaining!Will be continuing the series!
Mare Barrow, a 17-year-old Red, knows these fights are meant as a reminder that any act of rebellion will lead to punishment or execution via the Silvers' many abilities--mind control, telekinesis and super strength among them.To save herself and her war orphan friend, Kilorn, from conscription, Mare is pickpocketing Silvers in the small city of Summerton.
She fails at her mission due to the ensuing riots, but an attempt to pickpocket a boy named Cal serendipitously lands her a job as a serving girl at the summertime castle of King Tiberias.Mare learns Cal is the crown prince, set to marry another Silver girl, but that surprise is superseded by Mare's discovery that she possesses lightning talents that no Red has exhibited before.
It’s getting a little hot in here, isn’t it? That’s because Red Queen has unearthed what I never thought could occur: A mini Darkling. That’s right. Yet another morally ambiguous character and I am sold.  I’m a book pusher and I’m going to push this one right into your hearts. Red Queen is the fantasy that I’ve been searching for. You’ve probably all heard the comparisons before and honestly, they speak the truth. Red Queen took the best elements from all our favourites (and our not so much) t
Red Queen took the best elements from all our favourites (and our not so much) tales and smushed them into one phenomenal book with an equally addictive storyline.
Red Queen begins as all high fantasy dystopias do, with a young unassuming girl slumming her way through her rather unfortunate situation only to discover that she’s special.
Red Queen digs a little deeper, exploring political themes, alliances and the ultimate consequence of repressing a race.
Now I don’t want to speak too soon, considering I did an incredibly silly thing by reading this in 2014, but Red Queen has got to be my favourite fantasy set for 2015 thus far.
I don't have too much to say without giving away plot details, but I think I liked Cal and Maven's interactions the most out of any relationship in the story.
It left me thinking, 'Why isn't the Queen squashing all these plans?' It was a huge flaw for me because this is a major part of the book (and length of the book.) The powers for the Silvers worked to a point, but only when it benefited to the plot of the story.
Time moves slowly when you're waiting for something good. The fact that Aveyard just bashed her own book,  in her own book  either means she's a real riot and cleverly self-deprecating OR she really had no self-awareness. Judging from the protagonist in her story, I'd lean on the latter. •••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••(semi) buddy read : Belle & Frankie
After some accident, the royal family decides to replace her identity of the Red girl with the role of the missing daughter of one of the Silver war heroes, and to marry her to their younger prince.
So, she falls into the maelstrom of intrigues, meets with two princes (yes, a love triangle), and joins the ranks of the Red revolutionaries, trying to save her country, people and herself.
Because of his childhood trauma, he decides to help the rebellion, though it`s not easy, because by that he betrays his own kind.When Mare comes to live in the palace, she is torn between these two guys.
3.5/5I went into this expecting it to be terrible and it really wasn't that bad!
Definitely not the best, but not at all terrible.
It's SUPER predictable, even if you don't catch onto foreshadowing most of the time, and the romantic elements were not great.
You'll also need to suspend your disbelief at many points in time, but when don't you need to do that in a YA fantasy book?
(Answer: not very often) However, I really enjoyed the world and the magic element (even if it probably needed a bit more development) of it as well as the writing!
That being said, I enjoyed this so much this time??
(I'm going to love any story involving awesome powers like this - The Darkest Minds trilogy, The Shatter Me trilogy, X-Men, etc...)I loved (and hated) all the betrayal and the fact that you never really know who you can trust..
that ending.
I just wasn't connecting and I found myself thinking, who cares if she is with Cal, Maven, or whomever.Unfortunately, this story just kind of dragged for me, and although it ended with a bang, I'm a little let down by the book as a whole.
I have to after that crazy ending!
