Am I the only person who prefers Grant's over Netter? I think so. Netter is dynamic and beautiful, but the number of anatomical structures he labels on one image is baffling. Whereas, Grant's provides a plethora of images, with various angles and tissue layers, in greater detail. Additionally, the entire cranial nerves chapter is superior to Netter's. Anyone should be willing to admit that.
The best atlas of human anatomy in the world

Grant's Atlas has some of the best conceptual illustrations of the body of any atlas I have read.
When studying anatomy, Grant's is very helpful if you need to look up a structure and clearly see its features and relationships to other features of the body.
But when you're trying to learn by visualization - which at least in my experience is probably the best way to learn all of this information - I don't find Grant's to be very helpful.
It's also not very expansive on the functional importance of structures and how their dysfunctions can cause serious problems.
As far as anatomy goes, lots of illustrations from different views, so it's good for that, and, I think, better (though not absolutely required) than general anatomy & physiology books, but I haven't seen Netter's atlas (though I love his drawings), so I'm not sure if it's 5-star worthy.

Atlas of human anatomy
This was another great trash-pick. WONDERFUL illustrations in this book - I have used it for reference for more than one art project.
was my first book in the medical school its simple and has quite informative pictures that we can depend on it We studied it with clinically oriented anatomy or/and Snell sometimes cunningham
i want to see it
very useful for the amateur people mechanic.
