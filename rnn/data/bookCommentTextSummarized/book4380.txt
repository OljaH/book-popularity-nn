It had been a while since I read an Agatha Christie novel.
I combed through the list of her work and thought to myself...
I'm not actually sure if I ever read this one.
It's a must read for Christie fans and truly any mystery buff!
what does one do when a body shows up in the library -- and you're not sure who it is?
it's less about Marple and more about the story.
Nothing is as it seems, but that's where Christie shows her strength.
here's the scoop: I read A LOT.
I write A LOT.
Many thanks to their original creators.
When this year's classic bingo board in the group catching up on classics featured a classic mystery square, I used this as an opportunity to once again catch up with the Queen of Crime and the village of St Mary Mead's resident detective.
Dolly Bantry and Miss Marple head to the Majestic in order to solve this mystery before the entire village suspects Arthur of wrongdoing.
With the enduring reputation as the Queen of Crime, Dame Christie's mysteries remain enjoyable to me as I often have to read an entire book to discover whodunit.
Miss Marple's character becomes more rounded as we see her interact with her friends.
Even though there were less action in this book, but I don't think that dooms it to being a bad book, it's just a change of pace, which is often refreshing.In the author's foreword Christie writes: "I laid down for myself certain conditions.
The body, on the other hand, must be a wildly improbably and highly sensational body."Christie kept to her conditions, and the results were excellent.
Very tongue-in-cheek :PThe best thing about Agatha Christie is that she writes with typical British wit and humour, and also wry observations appearing here and there.
There's a small note to the reader at the very beginning of this novel in which Agatha Christie basically writes, "the trope of the body in the library is very common throughout detective fiction so I wrote this novel to fuck shit up".
Good old Agatha.
I think it is, because our beloved Miss Jane Marple is in fact missing from quite a lot of this novel.
for your typical Christie novel.
I won't spoil it but there is a scene set in a quarry and it is quite out there for Agatha.
Overall, I enjoyed this, like I do with most of Christie's books.
Someone here on Goodreads has a shelf called "cozy mysteries" and I think this is a perfect description of Agatha Christie's Miss Marple series.You can't get much cozier than a tea-drinking elderly spinster in a tiny English village.
The Body in the Library is a clever little book.
Miss Marple is called in to investigate when her friend finds a dead body (in the library).
There's lots of room for humorous little bits.
And when young Peter approaches the detective saying he's collected some famous autographs including Dorothy Sayers and Agatha Christie, I couldn't help smiling.Plus, I really want this library.The library was a room very typical of its owners.
Then Dame Agatha does her magic, the sort that turns things inside out, and it's the library that's the red herring, the body that's the clue, and the mystery itself isn't about ANY of those things.Divine fun.In 1983, ITV's Miss Marple turned the book into a good, faithful adaptation starring Joan Hickson *headache face*.
In 2004, Agatha Christie's Marple did it over and made significant character changes to the evergreen plot.
The changes are fun, I'll say that.
What a lark, and pace you Hicksonians, I think Geraldine McEwan makes a damned good Marple.
However, Mrs Bantry is determined that the crime should be solved, aware that suspicion will fall on her husband ("no smoke without fire...") and wisely calls in Miss Marple.
It sees Miss Marple in fine form, making her usual comparisons between the various suspects and locals she has known - there is, she says shrewdly, so much "evil" in a village.
As always, Christie utilises the setting expertly, with the hotel housing a great array of suspects, including a rich invalid, professional dancers and tennis coaches.
Miss Marple manages to solve the crime and put all to rights with her shrewd judgement and common sense - great fun.
Το πρώτο βιβλίο της Αγκάθα Κρίστι που διαβάζω με αφορμή το Όριεντ Εξπρές που είδα στο σινεμά (και επίσης το προτείνω ανεπιφύλακτα!) Το διάλεξα αποκλειστικά για τον τίτλο (γιατί έχω βιβλιοθήκη και ίσως με βρουν κι εμένα κάποτε εκεί να έχω πεθάνει από αφυδάτωση και ασιτία - ΟΧΙ ποτέ, πάντα καφές δίπλα μου όταν διαβάζω και για το φαγητό δεν κάνω μ@λ@κίες!!)Τελοσπάντων, το πτώμα ανήκε σε μια νεαρή κοπέλα και είναι σαφές ότι οι ένοικοι δεν είχαν ιδέα, με διαλόγους όπως "Η Μάρθα λέει ότι υπάρχει ένα πτώμα στη βιβλιοθήκη", "Τι λέει η Μάρθα ότι υπάρχει στη βιβλιοθήκη;" "Ένα πτώμα", "Υπάρχει ένα πτώμα στη βιβλιοθήκη;", "Ναι, έτσι λέει η Μάρθα", "Είπε η Μάρθα ότι υπάρχει ένα πτώμα στη βιβλιοθήκη" που μας θυμίζουν Λάμψη (είναι αξιαγάπητα παππούδια οι ένοικοι, δικαιολογούνται) και όταν - με το καλό - έρχεται η συνειδητοποίηση της μοίρας τους, αναλαμβάνει δράση η αστυνομία και η Μις Μαρπλ.
The first time I read a Miss Marple mystery story,l I was in my early teens and did not appreciate just how smart the woman is.
There are also little descriptions as the story progresses that are amusing.Though I figured out who one of the murderers was and suspected the other, I had fun reading as the story unfolded and Miss Marple did her thing, quietly watching everyone involved, and figuring out who was responsible.

قبلا فکر میکردم رمان های پلیسی اونقدرها هم برام جذاب نیستن و نمیخوندمشون ولی با خوندن این کتاب نظرم به کلی عوض شد , از اون کتاب هایی بود که نمیگذاره کتاب روی زمین بمونه و دوست داری تا آخرش رو با دقت بخونی ببینی واقعا قاتل کی بوده و انگیزه اش چی بوده؟!
3.5“My nephew Raymond tells me [...] that I have a mind like a sink. He says that most Victorians have. All I can say is that the Victorians knew a good deal about human nature.”
4.5“Downstairs in the lounge, by the third pillar from the left, there sits an old lady with a sweet, placid, spinsterish face and a mind that has plumbed the depths of human iniquity and taken it all as in the day's work....where crime is concerned, she's the goods.” Another excellent story!
Having read it previously, I still remembered the key points, but on the other hand it allowed me to look at all the clues in a different way, and weirdly I ended up enjoying it more than the first time.
It’s a short book, but I assure you it will not affect the quality of it and you’ll enjoy this mystery which leaves you hanging until the end when all is explained.Colonel and Mrs. Bantry, wealthy and upright citizens of St. Mary Mead, wake up one day to find the dead body of a mysterious young blonde woman in their library.
Neither Colonel Bantry nor Mrs. Bantry has any idea who she is and how she ended up in their library.
While Colonel Bantry calls the police, Mrs. Bantry calls her friend Miss Marple to solve the mystery of this girl.
I’m always amazed at her writing but also her understanding of psychology and how good her books continue to be after all these years!The Body in the Library did not let me down.
I enjoyed Miss Marple more in this book then the 1st one of the series, Murder at the Vicarage.
She outwits everyone in the end and I’m glad the police are finally understanding that they need her on the team.Note to self: Do not disregard smart old ladies that notice all the details.Overall, I enjoyed this book and will be reading more Miss Marple books in the future!!
Funny how your husband doesn't share your enthusiasm.Yet another murder mystery solved by our lovable heroine, Miss Marple.
It had its funny one-liners, but the story was mostly focused on the intricacies of how the body of an unknown woman actually ends up in the Colonel's library.
That's why you've got to come up at once.""You want me to come up?""Yes, I'm sending the car down for you."Miss Marple said doubtfully, "Of course, dear, if you think I can be of any comfort to you.""Oh, I don't want comfort.
Or was that in the previous book?Score: 3/5 starsI enjoyed reading the 3rd installment in the Miss Marple series, and will definitely continue working my way through the rest of the books.
Agatha Christie is one of my favourite authors when I want to read something light, entertaining and always well written. This book did not let me down. Miss Marple was at her very best, guessing who the murderer was quite early in the piece but of course not letting the reader know who it might be. As usual I had no idea but just kept happily reading, letting her do all the detective work and enjoying how smart she is.
She comes from the village of 		St. Mary Mead, which is a mile and a half from Gossington, she’s a friend of the Bantrys - and where crime is concerned she’s the goods, Conway.”As Miss Marple and Mrs Bantry descend to the Majestic Hotel they meet Ruby’s cousin, Josie Turner, whom she was currently deputising for in her capacity as professional dancer with handsome tennis coach and male partner, Raymond Starr.
This was my first foray into the Miss Marple series of Agatha Christie mysteries, and I have to admit first and foremost that this story has one of the best setups I've ever read in a detective novel: one morning Colonel and Mrs Bantry, the owners of a big English country house, are woken by their staff and informed that a dead body is in their library.
Here's Mrs. Bantry explaining the situation to her friend, Miss Marple: "But you're very good at murders.
Attenti alle vecchiette che ne sanno più dei poliziotti. Penso che Miss Marple tra libri, serie TV (del 2004 e non quello schifo francese di Little Murders giusto per chiarire la cosa) e pure un anime (con Poirot) sia uno dei miei personaggi preferiti. Gli altri sono Poirot (con Suchet) e Tommy & Tuppence (solo libri per loro).Nel drama del 2004 è il primo episodio.
"...there sits an old lady with a sweet, placid, spinterish face and a mind that has plumbed the depths of human inquity and taken it all as in the day's work....where crime is concerned, she's the goods."When the body of a blonde young woman is found strangled in the library of Colonel Bantry, rumours start spreading rapidly.
Concerned for her husband (who assures her that he has never seen the victim before), Mrs. Bantry contacts Miss Jane Marple.
Though the police have already been informed, Mrs. Bantry trusts Miss Marple more to clear the name of the colonel.
Completely assured of her husband's innocence, Mrs. Bantry involves Miss Marple.
You can rely on Christie to deliver a convoluted murder with wit and an understated charm.
Η πρώτη μου επαφή με την Agatha Christie καταλήγει σε 3άρι (που δεν είναι κακή βαθμολογία, αλλά είχα μεγάλες προσδοκίες). Παρακαλώ τους φαν της να μου προτείνουν τα αγαπημένα τους, γιατί με το συγκεκριμένο δεν ενθουσιάστηκα, αλλά θα ήθελα σίγουρα να δώσω και δεύτερη ευκαιρία.
أولى قراءاتي لشخصية مس ماربل وللأسف كانت الرواية مملة جداكما أن طبعة دار الحياة أخطاؤها المطبعية كثيرة للغاية حتى اسم الرواية خاطئ"جثة في المكتبة " وليس المكتبعلى رغم من جودة الطباعةوهو ما قلل من التقييم بشدة
An excellent and very enjoyable read.
Despite reading the book many moons ago and seeing at least one version on TV I still didn't guess who did it.
(SPOILER alert sort of " although I did get the clue about the fingernails eventually")And so it's onto the next which I think is The Moving Finger which I believe is a quote from the Wine of the Mystic: The Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam: A Spiritual Interpretation.
I must admit I don't know why, but I'm sure I shall find out.Anyway 3 down and 11 to go, and if they are all as good as this (and I have a feeling they will be) then it's gonna be a fun year.
This was my first Agatha Christie novel.
It's kind of a random one to start with.
It's not Murder on the Orient Express or And Then There Were None or any of her other famous works.
I chose it purely because I liked the cover.
But you know what?
I think it was a perfect choice.Miss Marple is absolutely delightful.
No ego, just a keen insight into the human psyche.
She's also far more clever than me; I didn't spot the killer until it was too late.It's almost a quintessential British village life/social class drama with some blood and death thrown in for good measure.
#5 book in the Agatha Christie ChallengeMost defintely a thrilling tale from Agatha Christie and my first Miss Marple mystery. Just when I thought I had it all figured out, the rug was pulled out from under me and there was one person I had overlooked. I absolutely loved the dialogue between Miss Marple and the other characters, but I felt Jane Marple was regulated more to the background than I have witnessed Hercule Poirot experience in his books. Overall, I loved it and am glad that my library has another two AC mysteries for me to pick up!
مغامرة جديدة في عوالم شيقة وممتعة ومليئة بالإثارة والمفاجآت .. المغامرة والرواية الثانية لي مع العجوز الثرثارة مس " ماربل " .. رواية عبقرية تضاف الى روائع أجاثا بالإضافة إلى أنني توصلت الى القاتل وهو أنجاز يحسب لي :) .. وهو ماجعلها تستحق الـ 5 نجمات..
I read this book for the Terror in a Small Town square of my 2018 Halloween Bingo card.Another Miss Marple mystery, which Dame Agatha crafted carefully to deceive the reader.
This is why she is still the Queen.Miss Marple knows human nature—she’s an observant woman who has lived in a small village all of her life and has taken note of the goings on.
Inspector Slack is obviously on the forefront of the change in respect for the gentry and is viewed with some distaste by his boss, Colonel Melchett, as a result.I had to laugh when one of the young men in this story bragged about having autographs from Dorothy Sayers and Agatha Christie!
The dead body belonged to the former Ruby Keene, a young woman whom neither Colonel nor Mrs. Bantry have seen before in their lives.The police are called of course, but Mrs. Bantry is good friends with Christie's spinster amateur detective, Miss Marple, and she gets it into her head that if there's going to be a murder in her house, she "might as well enjoy it." So she calls in Miss Marple.
Something that always gets to me when I listen to Agatha Christie books (Stephanie Cole was a great narrator for the edition I listened to, FYI) is that it constantly reminds me of this weird tendency I have.
