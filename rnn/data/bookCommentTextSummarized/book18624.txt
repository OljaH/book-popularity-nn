I HATED THIS BOOK.
JACK IS A JERK!Look, all this book is… is Jack and Cassie going back and forth completely destroying each other.
I mean, he cheats on her with someone who he ends up getting pregnant.
Then he LEAVES Cassie to marry Miss Pregnant Lady.And then he comes BACK to Cassie, and not only does she take him back.Ooooh no.
So. If you find yourself wondering as to whether you should read this book or not…Just picture me in the back of your mind doing this: 
And then if you STILL decide to read this humdinger of a book:Well…
it would be 1 star (didn't like) but the way jack apologized in the fucking end, IN THE END, actually saved the book.
his logic is so stupid and so irritating and so "uuu i need to be punished for hurting her so i'll do everything to fuck things even more worse"...honestly i wanted to kick them both for being so annoying!this book started so boring then started to give a hint to become something but then jumped to soooo much drama, and then i was just rolling my eyes and wanting to end this because it was becoming so frustrating to read it!
Jerks are the way to my heart!Then I started reading and I was like...Jack Carter, you are on the top of my Jerk of My Dreams shelf, first in line and all the way to the left.
Trust me buddy, that's a good thing.Seriously.This book...Gave me the biggest, dumbest, grin on my face the whole timeAND...Made me want to punch my kindle at the time.
Jack wants Cassie something fierce and works to prove to her how much.
Things are going seemingly well for both when Jack lands professional baseball career and Cassie gets an internship, they're unstoppable.
Jack loved Cassie with all his heart.
5 JACKTASTIC STARS I absolutely adore the feeling you get when you've found an incredibly fan-f*cking-tastic book. A book that takes you from happy, to thrilled, to anxious, to sad, to gutted, to depressed, to on top of the freaking world. An amazing book to me, is a book that I will remember almost every moment once I've read it. It's a book that devours my heart, soul and mind. It sticks with me and when it ends I want to cry because I'm so attached to each of the characters, that the thought
I was BLOWN AWAY!!!!!!Jack f*cking Carter is a bad ass, man whore who never sleeps with the same girl twice until he meets Cassie.
Jack had me so completely and utterly in love with him, I couldn't see straight.
I seriously LOVE books that rock me to my core like that....I had an actual "moment" and I will NEVER forget it.
I think we both know life isn't like that." ~ Jack Carter 
Jenn Sterling left me feeling like I was on a book high at the end of this.
J. Sterlings perfect Jack f*cking Carter...YES PLEASE ;)
★★★ 2.5 messed up, emotional and infuriating stars! I mean, really…  This book... Well, this book… I can't say that I really hated it, but I also know that I didn't love it either. So, that leaves me somewhere in the middle… I guess. ***MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD***The main reason that this book infuriated me were the two main characters and their immature behavior. Particularly that of: Jack Carter.What. A. Jackass.Seriously.See, in the beginning of the story, Jack is a the typical famous playboy ath
***MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD***The main reason that this book infuriated me were the two main characters and their immature behavior.
On a drunken celebration night, he cheats on Cassie with a baseball groupie who has set her eyes on Jack and who's made herself easily available.
To make matters worse, this girl ends up pregnant so Jack leaves Cassie in order to marry his drunken one night stand who's really only after his money and fame.
Because every time I start a review, I kind of feel like Julia Roberts at the beginning of My Best Friend's Wedding.
She slowly takes a bite, pauses, then says..."I'm writing this up as inventive...and confident." Well, a few days ago I took a rather big bite out of Jack The Perfect Game and here's what I have to say...I was somewhere between three and four stars for most of the book.
The star erasers had to do with the start of Jack & Cassie's relationship.
But like any broken heart, it can be fixed...and Jack fixed it.
I usually love the ones centered around people in college etc.I absolutely loved the characters in the beginning, with Jack's protective, overbearing, loving, passionate and cocky attitude and Cassies "kittens" tough, beautiful and strong personality.The storyline was going so well..
I'll admit the way it happened seemed pretty believable to me, and I can understand how Sterling wanted to portray a real relationship -with all its flaws- and cheating, as sad as it is, is a common occurrence nowadays.
All the strength I had admired in her character, was completely spoiled for me.I don't know how to rate this book..
*** HERE THAR BE SPOILERS. YEE HAVE BEEN WARNED ***I have decided to petition the author to rename this book: The Perfect Lobotomy, due to all the brain cells that were destroyed during its reading.This book was an epic... That's right. Fail.Never. NEVER before have I encountered two characters I actively wished death upon. I not only wished death on these characters, I wished for it to be slow and painful, preferrably consisting of some kind of flesh eating disease that rotted off body parts b
Baseball super fangirl and whore (the author's words, not mine) Chrystle gets knocked up and Jack decides that doing the right thing includes dumping Cassie (the love of his life) and marrying Chrystle.
It's only then that Cassie does the first sensible thing in this entire book (don't worry, it doesn't last long), she leaves for her new job in New York and tells Jack that if he wants her back he has to prove himself.
And I couldn't have given a shit if I'd been paid to.You want to read a book about cheating where the author actually gets it right?
Cassie is warned to stay away from Jack b/c he is like the BIGGEST manwhore on campus.
She has a set of rules for a happy life#1-Don't lie.#2-Don't cheat.#3-Don't make promises you can't keep.#4-Don't say things you don't mean.Pretty simple and easy rules for anyone to follow right?Whelp, I would think so but someone by the name of Jack "Fucking" Carter ends up breaking one or more.
(Like Sally Fields in Steel Magnolias).Jack has abandonment issues from when he was a child (you're heart will just break reading about this) and so he never has had a relationship before.
Eventually my baseball career will come to an end, and I can live with that, but I can't live without you." ~Jack and CassieI fell hard, HARD for Jack Carter.
Whhhhyyyy?!??In The Perfect Game Cassie Andrews a photography student in her Junior year in college meets Jack Carter the school star athlete.
Melissa was an excellent best-friend she kept it 100% with Cassie and never ever said things to placate her or the circumstances surrounding Jack.
Don't do it again." ~Cassie This is a fave line because Jack is sure to use it to his advantage...
This is the story of Jack Fucking Carter and Cassie "Kitten" Andrews.
Cassie is new to the college, so when she catches the eye of the infamous bad boy manwhore superstar baseball pitcher Jack, her best friend Melissa warns her about him.
Jack can't believe that Cassie doesn’t want him.
(view spoiler)[ I do need to say on a personal note that what happened to Cassie - Ie Jack sleeping with someone else and getting them pregnant, is EXACTLY how my relationship of 8 yrs broke down, so I was feeling Cassie's pain through the amazing writing and also reliving mine!
GOD I WANTED TO THROW CHASE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ROOM (hide spoiler)]Which one of Cassie's rules did Jack break?
Jack isn't perfect.
Cassie isn't perfect.
They have issues.
Something happens in the book that is gut wrenching.
You are so mad at Jack for what he does.
Then because of his issues, he compounds the betrayal by making an even dumber decision.
I'm sure people are going to complain Cassie and Jack do finally get their happy ending.
I adored the ending of this book.
It was the perfect ending for an almost perfect book about imperfect people who are absolutely perfect for each other.
However, this book didn't just tell us that the cheating occurred we had to read about the event while it was in progress and it was a little sickening when Jack started thinking about how hot she was and that he wanted to f@#& her (sadly, I admit the situation was believable).
Instead it isn't until he finds out Crys made up the whole baby thing that he goes back to Cassie and like an idiot with no self-respect, when he contacts her she wants to be with him again.
This book almost killed me dead! Sterling - you are a rock star! This book was a roller coaster of a ride that made me smile, sigh, cry, yell and then do it all over again. Job well done my friend!

totally undecided on this book..there where things i liked and things i didn't! (view spoiler)[ one of those being when Jack cheated I usually like some kind of drama but this just didn't fit with my idea of Jack and I just felt like it was totally unforgivable and he didn't redeem himself enough! Usually when the guy cheats I feel like its forgivable but I just didn't feel like that here (hide spoiler)] There were some very cute moments and I loved Jack and Cass as a couple and once they where

Usually when the guy cheats I feel like its forgivable but I just didn't feel like that here  (hide spoiler)] There were some very cute moments and I loved Jack and Cass as a couple and once they where together it was great but it seemed like all of a sudden they got together and were in love in the space of one chapter, when before that Cass really didn't like Jack.
So even though I know her I want you , the readers to know that THIS IS A 100% HONEST REVIEW !!!When I finished reading this book I had tears in my eyes !......don’t judge me lol I’m not usually a sooky lala type of girl but I was sooooooo proud of Jenn for this amazing piece of work that I couldn’t help but get emotional !!So much heart & soul when into this story that it just bled out of the pages & straight into me .
How one girl could turn this bad boy around and make him worship her......sooooooooo sweet!!Then Jack gets drafted to the big leagues so they have to figure out a way to make their love survive in a long distance relationship.That's where it became MY KIND OF BOOK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!And why was it my kind of book you ask?Because everything went WRONG in the last 50%..........LOTS LOTS LOTS of angst.......my favorite!!!!I wanted to scream at Jack........His decisions were absolutely terrible....just when I thought it couldn't get worse...it did!!Cassie had rules to follow, that she herself made....Rule number one: Don't lieRule number two: Don't cheatRule number three: Don't make promises you can't keepRule number four: Don't say things you don't meanYea that's good and all but.....I will just say after reading this roller coaster of emotions....the ending was beautiful!
So if you want to read the book, just don't read this.Even the jerks need their ad, don't they?
What DID HE DO?Hum. Sorry.Let's sum-up, shall we?
- Obviously, he decides to marry that girl, because, I'm kind of quoting here : "I hate that girl but as she's pregnant I must marry her - that way my child will be so lucky to live with parents who loathe each others.
She asks him to find a way to make amends.
She asks him to forgive her (at this point, I didn't even try to understand these characters).So, JACK :Brrr.
Four almost Perfect Stars ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥Hmmmmm so, for me, if I'm 100% honest this book wasn't perfect. It wasn't until the latter part of the book, probably from around the 60% mark when I finally started to warm to the characters. Why..... Let me get my moans out of the way: I found the dialogue a little clichéd and too telling in places, it wasn't subtle enough, if that makes sense? Sometimes less is more and actions speak a thousand words.Also Cassie's character, to start with, was all over the pla
I LOVED the characters and LOVED the story, ♥Now, of course I can't wait to get started on the sequel!!On to the good things, or should I say Yummy things!!!!♥"The one and only....He never hooks up with the same girl twice....Jack fcuking Carter....he's the ultimate playboy."(I know Jack's a pitcher but he decided to hold a bat for this pic, lol)Yes Jack is charming, lovable, gorgeous, yummy, HOT, and a MAN-WHORE but the girls don't care; they all want a piece of Jack.....
3-3.5 ★'s “Don’t lie, don’t cheat, don’t say things you don’t mean, and don’t make promises you can’t keep.”Another book from my cheating list that I finally got to and sadly, I was a little disappointed.
Maybe I've read too many New Adult books because even though these characters are in college, they felt like high schoolers and they were sooo immature.
But he's a once and done kind of guy and Cassie wants no part of that...or does she?
*fingers crossed*♦ Love that the author gave a shout out to one of my all time favorite books, The Opportunist!
Later maybe.**UPDATE**I chose to read this book when I heard it was somehow similar to Beautiful Disaster since they both had bad tempered main characters and everything.
Everything about this book was just wrong.Let's start with Cassie, the main female character.
I admit I like reading about possessive/bad tempered boys, but Jack was more irritable than he was hot.
he should not have said those things to them:"Oh, so you're not a stripper, you're a whore?" ~ Jack said this to Cassie when he met her the first time.
Jack started pursuing Cassie like crazy after only met her once and it was like 5 minutes.
4 Fast Ball StarsCollege love can be intense and earth shattering and also the place where you meet "The One". The one that changes everything for the good and the bad. This is a story of that kind of love.Meet Jack fucking Carter he's a college baseball superstar- He doesn't date. He just sleeps with girls and all their friends. He was beautiful. And he was charming. And a man-whoring pig. Meet Cassie aka Kitten- She's sassy, she's tough and says plays hard to get with Jack. But she has trust i
4 Fast Ball StarsCollege love can be intense and earth shattering and also the place where you meet "The One".
This is a story of that kind of love.Meet Jack fucking Carter he's a college baseball superstar- He doesn't date.
I wanted to hate him but I had a heart to forgive him.Can Cassie move on with her life, start over, and learn to love again all a new city away from Jack?
Can Jack come back from the mistake he made, show Cassie that his love never left, and get her to forgive him?
So with that said, I can’t believe that I balked at reading this!I was hooked from page one.
I even read it while watching game 7 of the NLCS between the San Francisco Giants & the St. Louis Cardinals…which made for an interesting soundtrack to the book.
(view spoiler)[When Jack cheated, I worried that I would hate him.
Because one thing I can’t stand is cheaters.
But, I didn’t hate him.
(hide spoiler)]I ended up reading this in one sitting…it was that good.
I can’t wait to read more from this author.
My reviews can also be found on the blog Confessions of 2 Book Lovers.
FINALLY a book that for one reason or another I did not hate the heroine!
In fact I LOVED Cassie!I knew before reading this book is was going to be awesome.
And now on with my review...Jack and Cassie are both emotionally damaged by their parents.
Jack deals with it by being a man whore and never "dating" anyone.
Jack immediately feels something for Cassie that he feels compelled to explore.
After much persuasion on his part, Jack finally convinces Cassie to go on one date with him.
Jack and Cassie's relationship face challenges that I honestly did not believe they could overcome.
Cassie was easy to like and i fell in love with Jake Carter from moment one.
(view spoiler)[but the fact that he cheated on Cassie made me sick.
What Jack did ruined everything this book could be in my opinion.But this was still a good read and i don't regret meeting the sexy/hot Jack Carter.
Cassie is weak and a fucking doormat for forgiving him so quickly and easily.
And Jack is disgusting..I am still gonna read book 2 though, in hopes that Cassie dumps his sorry ass.
Jack fucking Carter deserves to SUFFER an eternity in hell for what he did.
No leeré el segundo libro en la vida.Jamás.En la primera mitad del libro, estaba fascinada con la relación de éstos dos.Y entonces, el imbécil hizo lo que hizo y bueno, empezó la parte del libro en que cada vez que pasaba una hoja, abría cada vez más los ojos al leer tanta estupidez junta.Jack, eres el idiota más grande que he leído.(view spoiler)[ No fue tanto el hecho de que le pusieras los cuernos a tu novia, (y sabías lo que iba a suceder, amigo, no engañas a nadie), sino el hecho de que...
I did not forgive him or even love him in the end like i normally do with the "bad apples".It was so beautiful at times, i wanted to fall inlove with the drama and horrible histories but i could not.
Jack was a player, a sex god, so full of himself, he tried so hard at times that the ice around my heart wanted to melt..
I wish i could of liked this more, i read reviews for this book praising it to jesus, i seriously wanted to love it, i tried so hard but in the end i was disappointed.
I love this book. HARD!! ;-)The author is an awesome person, and she's written an AWESOME story! College, sports, drama, angst....this one has it all. Plus, my favorite, an epilogue! Yay!! Can't recommend this one enough:)
***There may be some minor spoilers but not many. I really try to stay away from spoilers.***Oh boy. Where do I start with this book? I had a pretty good idea what happens in this book before I started it. What I didn't realize, however, is how emotionally involved I would get. Ms. Sterling made me fall in love with this couple, then ripped my heart out, and then put it back together. What an exhausting, crazy, emotional rollercoaster ride this story turned out to be.  You’re both so screwed up
Jack is your typical womanizing manwhore who thinks he can get any woman he wants, until he meets Cassie who won't give him the time of day.
And Jack Carter does not take any woman on a date.
In turn, Cassie opens up to Jack.
They both have trust issues especially Cassie.
Cassie's trust issues stem from her father who never follows through with anything he says.
So yeah, Cassie has big trust issues.
Most couples have issues of all kinds when they first start dating.
I'm glad Ms. Sterling is continuing Cassie and Jack's story.
