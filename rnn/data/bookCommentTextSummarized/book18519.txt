After a few days of trying his best to wear her down, he finally comes up with an idea: he'll help elevate her social status by pretending to date her -- thus making her more likely to catch the eye of her crush IF she'll tutor him.
and makes it his mission to show her that he's actually the guy she wants.
So don't worry!This book had the ability to make me swoon one minute, put my heart in my throat the next, then literally make me burst right out laughing out of the blue.
:DYou'll swoon hard over Garrett, wish Hannah was your BFF, and totally get caught up in their story.
5 stars!
What can I say about The Deal that hasn’t been said in hundreds of other reviews… Well, I can say I regret being so late to the party on this one.
I had a friend recommend this to me when she read it back in February and every few weeks I would get a message from her asking if I’d read it yet (thanks for pushing, Jen!) I can’t say why I waited to read this, I just got busy with other books.
One things for sure though, I’ll be reading book 2 in this series very soon!
No more waiting for

5–Made My Heart Pitter Patter–StarsHoly smokes! I LOVED this book hard! It's by far my favorite New Adult romance.I'm not sure what more I can say that hasn't already been said about this delightful and entertaining book; therefore, I'll simply end with a quote from the story that captured my feelings perfectly. "Tiny butterflies of happiness take flight in my stomach and dance around my heart."
5 stars!See this face? That's my face while reading this book. Yup. This book made me happy. Throughout the whole thing I was either giggling, laughing, sniffling, blushing, and then smiling and laughing some more. And I'm not even sorry because heck, with so much shit happening in the world right now, it's nice to find a book that you can unabashedly get yourself lost in. The Deal was another one of those unexpected reads. Unexpected because despite its simple plot, this book succeeded in takin
That's my face while reading this book.
Unexpected because despite its simple plot, this book succeeded in taking over my heart and my mind.
And thus begin their unlikely friendship.Despite the straightforward plot, this won me over just by the strength of Elle Kennedy's writing, flawed yet ,b>relatable and likable characters and by its sheer readability.
Hannah's back story was heartbreaking as was Garrett's.
Both Hannah and Garrett have already overcome their issues.
It helped to enrich it, giving readers an insight into the characters but their issue wasn't treated as another plot device.I just loved Garrett and Hannah.
This book was definitely one of those unexpected gems: the more I read, the more I fell in love with the delightful main characters, the witty banter, and the steamy and impassioned romance.
But as I read on, my dislike for Hannah thawed out and I ended up really loving her character.
Much like the way Hannah and Garrett surprised each other and everyone else when they fell in love, this book also surprised me in the best of ways.
And oh boy, am I glad I did, because this book...
this book...
hottie - check, check, check- very likeable heroine - check- great plot - check- enemies to friends to lovers - check- almost non drama relationship - check- sexy sexy sexy bedroom times- check- witty bickering and dialogue - check- 2 delicate subplot matters very well executed (view spoiler)[ Garrett's abusive father and Hannah's rape (hide spoiler)]- sweet love story - checkWhat else could you possible want?
Now I want Logan, Tucker and Dean.
So please hurry Elle Kennedy and give us those boys already ;)
I loved the plot of our hockey jock, Garrett Graham harassing the musician, Hannah Wells for tutoring help in their shared class so he doesn’t lose ice time.
Hannah has survived a rape in her past and is a witty, resilient and strong heroine.
I truly loved how she slowly begins to trust her friendship with Garrett and embracing what they find in one another.
I can’t think of one negative thing about this story except perhaps if it was possible for a story to never end I would have been perfectly happy day after day reading on and on about Garrett and Hannah.
Written in dual POV, which I really, really enjoyed, this NA is about two people, Hannah and Garrett who apparently are very different from each other, but as the story progresses they will find they are more compatible they have thought.
What no one knows is that Phil Graham is not as perfect everyone wants to believe.When Garrett gets an F at one of his courses he’s desperate to find a tutor.
Hannah doesn’t want to have anything to do with this annoying cocky player, at least at first.
While I only liked Hannah, I loved Garrett.
*****FIVE++++++++ STARS*****{BR with Mel, Dee, and Sharon}FREAKING LOVED THIS BOOK!!!! This book was freaking AMAZEBALLS, with a heaping side of AWESOMESAUCE!!!! I don't think there are enough words in the English Dictionary to really express just how OVER THE MOON IN LOVE I am with this story!! This was utterly UNPUTDOWNABLE! I usually take days to finish a book, but this one grabbed on to me so tight and wouldn't let go. It is the best of 2015 so far, for me. All I wanted to do was to find a w
I don't think there are enough words in the English Dictionary to really express just how OVER THE MOON IN LOVE I am with this story!!
Well, I'd like to specifically take the place of Hannah so that I can have Garrett all to myself!!!
Yea, I do believe I have read a few books like this, BUT, it didn't make me LOVE this story any less.
I absolutely loved when Hannah literally gets a PENIS SMORGASBORD towards the end of the book.
I know I'm pretty late in the game with this book, but if any of my friends have not read this yet, I urge you to read it!!
5 Amazing Stars. Hannah is a simple girl who just wants her crush to finally notice her. Garret is the hot-shot, playboy, hockey player that needs help with one particular class he’s failing. He knows Hannah’s is the only who can help him, so they make a deal: she helps him pass the class, he helps her winning her crush’s attention by pretending to be interested in each other.

Enjoyed this one.It was smart, sexy, hot.I adored Hannah, an ordinary girl who wasn't going to be bowled over by the He-man that was Garrett Graham. She was no pushover. She was no "puck bunny"! “Just out of curiosity,” she says, “after you wake up in the morning, do you admire yourself in the mirror for one hour or two?” “Two,” I reply cheerfully. “Do you high five yourself?” “Of course not.” I smirk. “I kiss each of my biceps and then point to the ceiling and thank the big man upstairs for cre
Enjoyed this one.It was smart, sexy, hot.I adored Hannah, an ordinary girl who wasn't going to be bowled over by the He-man that was Garrett Graham.
“I kiss each of my biceps and then point to the ceiling and thank the big man upstairs for creating such a perfect male specimen.” 
Garrett was an ass some of the time, a cocky bastard, but an adorable ass.
Or all of them?I tend to stay away from the NA genre.
I have an 18 year old son away in college.
But I have read a few good college books.His father ...
First read: May 2015Reaction: It was ok, nothing special.Second read: February 2016 Reaction: THIS IS SO PERFECT I'M GONNA DIEConclusion: Dear Garrett Graham,I am so, so sorry for not appreciating your perfection the first time I read The Deal.
I liked Hannah very much, even though some of her decisions made my blood boil in a not particularly pleasant way and she broke my heart, but the general awesomeness of this book didn't let me stay mad at her for long!
The way Hannah and Garrett bickered had me laughing my ass off, and their smexy scenes made me drool!
(don't answer that!) Can you blame me for wanting a Garrett Graham?I'm so going to die alone.
Title: The DealSeries: Off Campus #1Author: Elle KennedyRelease Date:  24 February, 2015Rating: 5 starsCliffhanger:.
No HEA:  (view spoiler)[ Yes (hide spoiler)]From time to time, I still have the pleasure to read what I call a perfect new adult novel; great blend of heart fluttering, blood pounding, charming, sexy and cute story with swoon worthy hero and likeable heroine.
The Deal is a real gem!
And yes, I want to keep being Hannah’s friend.
But…I also want to sleep with her."Garrett and Hannah’s story rocked my world.
Elle Kennedy’s done amazing job!
Her characters felt real.
This is important because this is a book that I recommend all the time to readers who like me hate cheating4.5 solid stars, rounded because this is a great New adult read, FREE OF CHEATING, barely any slutshaming and the hero is just adorable.
I wouldn't have talked to that bitch, but in the same recital Hannah is too agreable to this girl and too cold to her friends (hide spoiler)] but I still would prefer to root for Hannah 100000000 times over Ella, the heroine from the other Kennedy book I read.
*Just about 4 Stars* — Great read!  The Deal  is the perfect choice when you’re looking for something engaging, sexy, and light—with a lil' dose of depth to trigger your emotions.YES, those who claim this book contains cliches aren’t kidding. There are certainly plenty of cliched one-liners to go around, but for some reason, I was able to glide right past them.And…  okay …so maybe just about everyone in this book is totally hot, and the storyline was often predictable…Am I selling you on this bo
Only, there’s no way Justin would ever notice someone with her lowly social status...So when the very “popular”, very sexy, and very flirty lady’s man, Garret, offers to help Hannah gain the attention of her crush in exchange for some Ethics tutoring, “The Deal” is born…The sexy trail of events that take place after are nothing short of awesome, and the perspectives alternating between hero and heroine are implemented with distinguishability, as well as believability.
Enemies, to friends, to lovers.▪  Characters: Well fleshed out and lovable.▪  Plot: Hero makes a deal with heroine to help gain the attention of her crush.

First Read: 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟Second Read: 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟Third Read: 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟 THIRD TIME’S A CHARM 😂 can someone tell me where I can find a guy like garrett from?
Ahhhhh, I LOVE 💙 this series❗️Complete trash for Garrett 😍••••••••••••••••••( Original Review ) First read of 2017!
Hannah and Garrett has this chemistry about them that just makes me smile like an idiot.
If only I knew a guy like Garrett, it'd be heaven...
I always love a good romance novel with humor in it :D Not to mention, those sex scenes were oh so steamy!
"'I love you, Garrett.'"
Garrett is sexy and Hannah is one lucky girl to have a guy like him!
4.5 Stars!There are already a ton of reviews for this one so I'll keep it short and sweet...Yes to some great banter!Yes to some smokin' hot sex!Yes to low drama and angst!Yes to likable MCs that didn't make me roll my eyes! Garrett was *sigh*.....I just loved him! He was cocky and arrogant, yet thoughtful and sweet. This one may have been predictable and not too far outside of the box but it didn't have the added BS that makes me not enjoy the NA genre much anymore!So Elle Kennedy....
Being that my typical daily intake of caffeine includes 3 cups of black regular, a mid-morning Americano with 4 espresso shots, and an afternoon quad latte...I am hurting like a bitch.
I caught myself singing Back in Black this morning like I was the lead singer of AC/DC.
So keep that in mind when reading this train wreck review.
Hannah was a good lead.
And they really do have sorority groupie girls who throw themselves at them on the regular.
Seriously, I knew a girl who slept her way through half the basketball team and the majority of the soccer team.
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX24 hours after writing this review...
Believe the hype!! Purely wonderful - still smiling days later. LOVED IT!!!
"One day I was telling him to get lost, the next, I'm snuggling in bed with him.
Life is so frickin' weird sometimes." WOW!
WHY DIDN'T I PICK THIS BOOK UP EARLIER?
The Deal proves to be a huge surprise in the best sense possible.
It's such a great New Adult book complete with all the elements that can make you swoon like crazy!
I had so much fun reading this book.
I have been eye-ing this for about a year now and I have to say that I did regret why it took me so long to dive into it.I was imme
Apart from the balls to the walls humor that Elle Kennedy put into this book, the characters made it even more interesting.
The heroine Hannah Wells and the lover boy, Ice Hockey team captain of Briar University Garrett Graham are both fun and enjoyable to read.
I can't even!What I especially loved about this book was the relationship development between Hannah and Garrett.
Both of them didn't instantly feel that 'connection' and 'spark' but in the long run, SURPRISE!
I believe I have just found a new favorite book and it's because of the unbelievably humorous and delicious writing style of Elle Kennedy.
Garrett and Hannah ♥10 Reasons To Date A Hockey Player1.
All other athletes like to play with balls.And this is why I need a HOCKEY PLAYER ..
I don't know WHY but I've had this book for a while in my TBR why it took me till random 4 AM bored-ness to read?
These characters honestly ..
I know that when she says she loves me,she actually means me-Garrett-and notBriar's hockey star, or Mr. Popularity,or Phil Graham's son.
The first was another hockey book by her Body Check ..
she knows her sh*t about these hockey players.
5 Face Palming, HardCore Loving Stars * * * * * Spoiler FreeElle Kennedy has been a go to author for me whenever I wanted something with an easy to follow plot and a very sensual, spicy, sexy man.
Well, Ms. Kennedy has written one of the best New Adult "college" stories I have read.
They both work and support the career goals of their talented singer/songwriter daughter.
Hannah has no use for Garrett.
make it look like they are together and hook her up with a date with her goal guy.
The Goal (Off-Campus, #4)https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...~~~~~ Before Reading ~~~~~
11/22/16 editI've been rereading romance favorites and I forgot how much I loved this one!!! Makes me want to reread the whole series!******************************************February 2015: 4.5-5 Wellsy stars!   "The ice looked so shiny and smooth, until you got close enough to it, and suddenly all the uneven edges and crisscrossed skate marks became visible. That’s me, I guess. Covered with skate marks that nobody ever seems to notice.”   This is one of those books that really does live up to
There's a girl at college who has issues, which are said straight away at the beginning (something I actually liked knowing up front so it wasn't dragged out as a plot point) and a jock who needs tutoring help.
Garrett is the school star hockey player and just failed his midterm, so he needs Hannah's help.So many people have done wonderful reviews and there's no way I could live up to them, so I'm breaking this down into what I loved about the book, because there really isn't anything I didn't like about it.-The banter.
Sweet, Heart-Warming College Love StoryThis was a fairly light-hearted and humorous love story with a HEA.
Sometimes, predictable is alright and that was the case for this book.Garrett is a star hockey player at school.
He aggressively pursues Hannah, a more reserved music major, after seeing that she aced a test in a shared class.
Hannah isn't interested in tutoring the arrogant jock.
It took me a little while to actually like the characters, but once I did, they kept me constantly entertained.
If you're looking for a light-hearted, college-aged romance, this might be a good choice for you.Check out more of my reviews at www.bookaddicthaven.com
In fact, as she’s on stage singing, all he’s thinking is “I want to kiss her right now” and “im hard as a rock in the middle of this bar.” He later notices how drunk she is and says, I quote, “I love being the one who got her to this point." at the end of the night they both end up wasted and Garrett, just in his boxers, crawls into bed with Hannah, who's only in a T-shirt.
No suelo leer este género (New Adult), pero gracias a este libro, lo empezará a hacer.En la primera parte de la saga #KissMe, Prohibido enamorarse nos encontramos la historia de Hannah y Garrett, cada cual con su pasado oscuro y sus metas en la vida.
No es un sexo injustificado, sino que forma parte de la trama y de las relaciones entre personajes.No soy fan de las películas, series o libros que se centren en deportes, y pensaba que esta novela iba a hablar demasiado del hockey...
SO. That was surprisingly good. It was definitely NA, but the angst level was low, so it felt more like contemporary, just with coeds instead of professionals. PLUS hockey players. I bloodydamn love hockey players. Full RTC. Pre-review:YEAH. What now Cinda Williams Chima? V.E. Schwab? Are you happy? Are you proud of yourselves?!
Big time.I had so much fun reading this book I'm still smiling like an idiot and my cheeks hurt.Alright so The Deal tells Hannah Wells' story and how she's going to get her crush's attention.
I'm so happy I read this book.First we have Hannah, who's lusting over Justin and yeah, that was kinda silly but crushes ofter are.
Like, those kind of things are absolutely hard to get over but she's determined and she won't let what happened ruin her life.
I saw it several times in the book and I don't think that being "a man" can be used as an excuse to have sex or do things.
4.5 StarsThere are tons of kickass reviews for this book and well I'm in slacker mode, so I will keep it short. I enjoyed everything about this one. The characters were great, the sex was hot, it was an all around fantastic read. The story was nothing new, but I still loved it.
4.5 jocks are human after all STARS  “I never expected her. Sometimes people sneak up on you and suddenly you don't know you ever lived without them.”  Well I'll be damned, that one actually did live up to the hype. Honestly, if you haven't read The Deal yet, I really don't know what you're doing. It's simply a good book, with a great story and two very lovable main characters. The Deal is the first instalmet in Elle Kennedy's Off-Campus series. It's a sort of 'enemies' to 'friends' to 'lovers'
Oh I know...how about Hannah?Well, for starters he needs to find a way to persuade the reluctant straight A student and musician to even talk to him, let alone invest her precious free time on a jock.
I loved the writing, I adored the quirky story line and I fell head over heels for Mr. I'm-an-asshole-by-day-and-sweet-and-caring-human-being-by-night Graham!This is not my first Elle Kennedy book, but I don't remember her writing being so witty and engaging and simply on point before.The characters weren't straight up college clichés, there were layers and history and just really well developed personalities.
