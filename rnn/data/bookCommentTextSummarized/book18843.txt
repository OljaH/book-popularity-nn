This book was stupid, boring, and too short to short to warrant $9.SPOILER: girl is abused by her dad; dad goes to jail; dad gets out of jail; mom is more interested in dad than daughter; dad starts harassing daughter again; daughter hits him with a statue of the holy mother and breaks his head. the end.
Meredith, a 15-year-old girl, was promised nine years of protection from the government when her father was charged with molesting and raping her when she was 12 years old.
This book, though a difficult subject, realistically portrays the evil that too many children encounter in our society: molestation and rape by a family member.
Though this entire book could not be taught in the classroom, it is a good resource for teachers and students to read in order to have at least some sort of understanding of the horror that molestation and rape victims face and have to deal with.
But he's paroled in only three, when Meredith is 15, and, because Meredith's selfish, narcissistic mother wants her husband back, he sets about working his way back into Meredith's life and continuing where he left off.Let's just get one thing out of the way: this book requires an enormous suspension of disbelief, at least if you have even the most tangential contact with the real justice system.
Honestly though, How It Ends by Wiess is so much better than this one so I would recommend that one over this one.
The best thing about this book was Meredith.
I liked Andy at the start but then he kind of got annoying.
Something else I really liked was the dynamic between Meredith and her mother.
Her mother was awful, just a horrible person but there are people like her out there.
Those people are almost as awful as the abusers in my opinion.
Its just incredible and absolutely heartbreaking.I would recommend this and I would read more by Laura Wiess.
Wonderfully written story. A little pricey for being so short--I wish it was longer--but I loved the way things were described and the twist at the very end.
He did it on purpose, over and over again because he wanted to, because he get off on it-” There are just some books that despite not liking the characterization, you love the book because the story it is telling is important.This book is about a motherfucking pedophile who was supposed to be rotting in jail for nine years (not enough).
He was Merideth's father and because the universe is a bitch sometimes, her father was released after three years in prison.Let me be straight because I know you guessed in the blurbed what really happened.
It's fucking important because some people likes to pretend that this kind of thing doesn't happen in the world.
SUCH A PRETTY GIRL has only been out for three and a half years now, but I kind of get the impression that--similar to Julia Hoban's Willow--it hasn't reached the wider audience it deserves as a result of its somewhat disturbing subject matter.
And Andy, who is confined to his wheelchair and not so incidentally had his own brush with Mer's father, really does have his own set of messy issues to deal with as much as he loves and wants to protect Meredith.
In the years since her father was incarcerated, Meredith has acquired several coping mechanisms for dealing with what happened to her.
What's the point of obsessing over cholesterol or bike helmets or even cigarettes when the biggest threats to our children are being released back into society every day? Yes, maybe 'some' of them have reformed, but what about the ones who haven't? Doesn't anyone realize that one 'touch', one 'time' will destroy a child's life ten times faster than a pack-a-day habit? Such a Pretty Girl was disturbing and a very painful subject. The kind that makes one uncomfortable, as it should be. It is sick
Doesn't anyone realize that one 'touch', one 'time' will destroy a child's life ten times faster than a pack-a-day habit?
There are many novels out there that deal with this kind of subject, and Such a Pretty Girl is like any of them.
This book deals with usual issues, like rape, abandonment and incest.
Despite being ordinary it’s not an easy novel to read, as reader will feel Merith's nightmare toward her father’s abuse and mother’s abandonment.
First is the Merith's fascination on numbers (maybe the only thing that I like with the main character).
Like with Merith and Andy.
I'll start by saying that I was struck by the similarities between this novel and my spring 2007 book Chasing Tail Lights).
The book is loaded with creepy moments (the father touching Mer's back and asking - "when did you start wearing a bra" ) and awful insights (it's not the abuse that hurts, it is the memory of the good times).
Merdeith's mother - well, people who read Chasing Tail Lights would always ask how could the mother in that book know the abuse is going on and not do anything -- is just so sad, so pathetic, and thus in so ways more evil than even her father.
New Jersey teenager Meredith was supposed to have nine years of safety from her father, so she'd be eighteen and out of the house when he was released from prison.
She has her grandmother, the mayor of the town, who wants Meredith to move in with her to escape her father.
Even though Meredith is far from alone, she still feels that way when she can't even count on the people every kid is supposed to be able to count on: her parents.
Meredith wants to get her father back in prison.
Laura Wiess's characters are as well-written as the rest of the book, very realistic (in some cases, scarily so).
This story revolves around Meredith, a 15 year old whose father sexually abused her and has just been released early after serving only 3 years of his 9 year sentence.
Her mother turns the other way and is in major denial over the whole thing, and Meredith feels like she has to deal with it mainly on her own.
She feels safe with the number 4 and she soon realizes that the only way to get rid of her pedophile father is to play the role of the martyr.
This book is raw and painful, and although it hurt to read it, I couldn't put it down.
(I hate, hate, hate Meredith's mother.) There were some parts of the story that were unlikely (weird coincidences, etc.) but overall it was very real.
It hurt because there are ways in which I was Meredith once.
Reading Meredith's story also made me rethink my kids at work.
Statistically, so many of them have stories like Meredith's.
We're all stronger than we know.Recommended for fans of Speak: similar theme, narration, but harsher storyline and darker tone and not a high school setting.
The main character, Meredith, age 15, just can't seem to focus on anything except getting away from her sadistic parents and their bad sex to be with her crippled boyfriend, Andy, so they can have the good sex and drink the good booze.
Sex with daddy is bad while sex with Andy is perfectly acceptable.
Meredith has no close girlfriends her own age and the only responsible female adult in her life is her grandma because her Mom is just plain crazy.
The big, bad, boogie-man who wants to get in everyone's pants is Meredith's father who just got out of prison.
So a girl has been molested/raped by her father.
She testifies against him, and he's sent to jail for 9 years but gets out in 3.Her mom bases her entire self-worth upon the approval of her dad and is super duper psyched that Darling Diddler Daddy is coming home from prison.
Why doesn't she suggest that the daughter live at her house before her dad gets out of jail?b) the cop would suggest that the girl use herself as bait like this.
Truly heartbreaking, but still lined with hope.Meredith, while suffering from major PTSD, was so strong and willful and I admired her.
Her relationship with Andy, while unconventional, made me happy and I enjoyed the character development on both sides.
The ending also made me smile and I liked that.
The anger I felt at a few characters and situations throughout this book was also somewhat mollified by seeing those characters face the consequences they deserved.
Overall, taking into account the subject matter of the book, I enjoyed and appreciated it.
I'm glad I read it, even if it was hard to read at times.
Meredith’s father was put away in jail for sexually assaulting four children and his own daughter…Laura Wiess captured Meredith so well.
Meredith tried so hard to keep her father away; she turned to her mother (WHO WAS MEANT TO PRETECT HER FROM HIM), the story unfolds to show how broken the family was before the trial and Meredith’s testimony sentencing her father.
This is not something a 15 year old that is not something anybody should do!!!Okay rant over the fact that Meredith has a horrible family, she does however have a great boyfriend, even though a romantic bit in this book was not needed it was very well received.
But by choosing to make him 19, I felt like this negated a lot of the important issues that the author was trying to address between Meredith and her father.
Yes, I understand that Meredith and Andy had a lot in common and they were connected, but their age difference is still statutory rape, and no one seemed to have a problem with it.
It's really the main issue that I had with this story, because I think in a way it demeaned what Wiess was trying to address.
I know this book deserves more than 3 stars and i would definitely have given it more had i not read "How It Ends" before this one.
In fact the ending happened quite abruptly.
Meredith was abused by her father who is a pedophile.
This wrecks havoc in Meredith's life especially since her mother has never considered her father to be a child molester(she believes that it was a mistake and that they should forget about it and move on).
So Meredith decides to put her father in to jail for good and a plan is devised.What i liked about about Meredith was that she was not brave only on the outside but also inside.
I am gonna keep this sort and sweet.
I work with childhood sexual abuse everyday with the youth I take care of.
This book does a horrible job at telling the truth.
The two positives I can give the book is 1) the mom's personality is pretty spot on and 2) Meridiths OCD with numbers is pretty spot on as well.
I have to many bad things to complain about that I will keep them to myself and not ruin the book for others.
Just know that this doesn't give the full and accurate picture of incest/child sexual abuse.
A lot of things really irked me about this book.
Meredith’s mother.
As a mother, this is something I cannot stand for.
The ending of the book have the mother just what she had coming.
What kind of world is this book taking place in?
Not to mention the amount of time we spend reading about this girl running away.
Every chapter she is running away.
Why would you want someone to run away so much?
Nothing but an urge to help this child who’s mother clearly wouldn’t.
In turn, the characters make poor decisions and choices.
She was promised nine years of safety, but received only three: Meridith is fifteen, living with a mother who intentionally blinds herself to the truth, and her sexually abusive father is about to be released from jail. She must find a way to protect herself from her fatherand protect the other children that he may abuse in her stead. Meridith's harrowing story is compulsively readable, but it's too short and the secondary characters and plotlines don't receive enough attention. Careful flashbac
Careful flashbacks prevent the book from devolving into voyeurism, but Meridith's proactive solution to her father's abuse sets a questionable example to young adult readers.
Meredith counts wall tiles and vitamin pills, but she also willfully confronts her mother with her father's abuse: Wiess balances realistic trauma against her protagonist's fighting will, giving the dark story a sense of hope.
Such a Pretty Girl is only one character's fictional story and never intends to be instructional, but the protagonist's risk takingespecially since it has only positive consequencessets an uncomfortable example for the reader.Such a Pretty Girl is a dark book which is almost impossible to put down.
I’ve had Such a Pretty Girl on my to read list for years.
I picked it up on a whim the other day and devoured it.Such a Pretty Girl is a difficult book.
The subject matter is something that a lot of people wouldn’t want to read about.
Books that make me step outside of my normal life.
Meredith has been sexually abused by her father in the past.
Laura Wiess handles the tough subject with grace.I felt for Meredith so much.
It was horrifying and somehow breathtaking at the same time.Such a Pretty Girl was a spectacular read.
The only way to protect the community is to provoke the offender into re-offending, and Meredith offers herself up as the sacrificial lamb.
The theory of a "victim soul" is fascinating.Meredith's mother is representative of unfortunate women with internalised - and maybe externalised - misogyny, who only value themselves if they have a man.
It's sad, frustrating, and definitely frightening that Meredith's mum puts herself before her daughter.This is a true psychological thriller, which I read in one sitting in the dark, wee hours of the day.
I read this book about five years ago but it had quite an impact on me and has stayed with me all these years.
A short read that I was able to finish in one sitting.
A well written and moving novel.
The many difficult subjects it covers makes it an extremely emotional read.
In my opinion this powerful novel should not be missed.
Once you start reading it, you won't be able to put it down.
It's an emotional book and one that will stay with you long after you finish the last word.
trigger warning: molestation, rape, sexual assault, pedophilia, incestwow I read some pretty dark books...
Meredith thought she had 9 years of freedom from her abuse father...
In those 3 little years, she never got over the abuse suffered by the hands of her father.
She found Andy, a boy who was also abused by Meredith's father.
He needs Chirp to "forgive and forget" the sexual abuse he pushed on her..And then there's Andy.
But he too was abused by Charles and finds a form of solace in Meredith.
As a victim/survivor of sexual abuse, I expected her to be more closed off.
She believed the only way to save Meredith was to pray for her.
This is such an empowering book to have a voice. Describing how one girl can deal with her biggest fear on her own and save lives, even if it meant to risk her own. A breathtaking book that can see a new perspective of how fears can hurt you so much, but conquering it is a such a liberating feeling.
Her father went to jail three years ago for sexually abusing her and several other children in town.
Mom won’t acknowledge what happened (and would choose her husband over her daughter in any case), her best friend Andy and his mother are going away and won’t be there for her, and she doesn’t have any legal recourse unless her father does something specifically wrong – like abusing her again.
Children should never have to experience sexual abuse and should never have to combat it on their own.
It’s not, after all, just knowing *who* the sex-offenders are, but knowing what to *do* about sexual abuse.
Not many authors will touch this subject and even fewer who do it properly but Laura Wiess is one of those who was able to tell her story remarkably well.While Such a Pretty Girl is a very short read at only 212 pages it certainly packs an emotional punch.
She turned a blind eye to Meredith's horrors for years and she should be in jail just as much as her husband.However, Meredith does have a small cluster of people around her that do love, support, cherish and are willing to protect her but they all have their own lives as well so I could understand much of Meredith's frustrations in the book of feeling alone.I thought that the story line of Such a Pretty Girl was perfectly paced and I'm glad it wasn't overly long.
My favorite passage is as follows:"...I know how bad the odds are for girls like me.
We don't see what we should see because having anyone is still supposedly better than being alone.I know the grim probability of my own future.The odds are high that the best of me has already been ripped away and that if I don't keep hold of myself I will lose what's left.
Without the structure of my rules and rituals, I'm a free-for-all open to any guy who wants to hurt me.
