A satire of the novel form that ends up being a scathing critique of colonialism, Americanism, manifest destiny, and the creative process. A lot of wordplay and hilarity and theft of various texts and brilliant phrases here and there like "If it is not flamboyance, it becomes deformity: if it is not hard to becomes crime." It's short, but certainly a struggle to read, as it's supposed to be.
Funny story - I went on vacation and quickly finished the book I had brought with me.
Although collectively the narrative makes absolutely no sense, there are moments of sheer brilliance.
There is some "American" stuff in here too: cars and contemporary cultural references and brief contemplation of the concept of America.
As the title suggests, it is a tongue-in-cheek response to the question of the great American novel; as such it is occasionally sardonic, perhaps with too much condescension.
There is occasional mild racism as well.
It had its moments for sure, but I was proud of myself for even finishing it and eager to move on.
If there is progress then there is a novel.
Without progress there is nothing.
No rain for fifteen days.
It will never rain.
It will never rain.
It will never rain.
Heat and no wind all day long better say hot September.
The year has progressed.
A year is not as yesterday in his eyes.
Besides last year it rained in the early part of the month.
It rained on the white goldenrod.
Today being misplaced as against last year makes it seem better to have white-- Such is progress.
Yet if there is to be a novel one must begin somewhere.
This was the coolest/strangest/shortest book I've read in a while
When and where, you never know.And tomorrow night is Grim Reaper, for the back to back.
