According to Diana Gabaldon's website, the octothorpe on the front cover symbolizes the eight major characters whose stories are told in WiMOHB – Jamie, Claire, Roger, Bree (and Jem and Mandy), Ian, William, John.
The Battle of MonmouthUsually, most readers (including me) enjoy the Jamie and Claire parts the best.
Unbalanced scenes with some being entirely too drawn out and tedious, and others too quick, too short, too unprecedented and not firmly enough tethered to the main plot (if there even was a main plot).The last couple of books in the Outlander series have seemed more unfocused to me, and this one is no exception.
I can't quite leave it there because I like Diana Gabaldon, and think she brilliantly wove together the ultimate historic-fantasy-romantic-adventure story when she created this series.
Spoiler-free review:I first want to say that the Outlander series has been in my heart and soul since around 1999.
But, like Echo, so much of the story just seemed like "filler." Diana is bound and determined to have her readers experience the Revolution, so unless you enjoy military camp life and all the mind-numbing details of the Continental army moving from point A to point B, this very large portion of the book dragged on forever.
I felt inundated with medical and military details, and not nearly enough of the heart and soul of her books.
It took so long for Claire and Jamie to get back to each other I was going to scream.
There are some things happening with Bree, Roger and the kids in the real world time.
Ian has someone and Rollo likes them =) And I have to give some space for ole Clarence the mule.
I loved how Germain, Fergus and Claire took up for Clarence and got him back.
Clarence was happy too =) As you know with these books, there are a lot of things going on because the books are so big.
http://www.audible.com/pd/Romance/Wri...*Of course I loved it!
I mean, it's Diana "mad skillz" Gabaldon and it's an OUTLANDER book!
If you are on the 8th book in the series, it is already assumed that you are a rabid Outlander fan.
So if you are a fan of the first 7 books, you will love this one.
I think it has the most POV shifts and is the most segmented of the previous books.
It was a breathtaking book, to be honest.
I swear, I read these books as much from a doctor's perspective as from an average reader's, and I'm never disappointed.
Please do not expect any work from me until I have finished this book. I will be taking a break from all forms of human interaction from the time I get it until it is finished. We have got to get little Timmy out of the well...uh, I mean little Jemmy out of the tunnel.Update: *sigh* I finished it! This was a good one.
A huge number of plotlines that didn't seem to serve any narrative purpose, too much time spent with annoying characters, WAY too much surgical detail, and timelines that even for THIS series are totally confusing.
Clearly Diana Gabaldon loves her work and the research it entails (which is part of the reason I find her books so enjoyable), but her editor should have taken a firmer hand here.
In a recent blog post she mentioned being at work on Book 9, so maybe that accounts for some of the irresolution.
The interesting Big Questions the characters raise about time travel get lost in the shuffle.
Maybe I just didn't find Geillis as interesting in Jamaica, maybe there was something still not enterilly clicking between Jamie and Claire, and the tension between them caused by Brianna and Roger was exhausting, As it should be, Diana Gabaldon has never been know to pull punches.What ever it was, it was with a sort of dread I opened this book to wonder what will be the focus, since I surely couldn't take a single page more of Willie being a twat.Alas, it paid off.There's authors out there that are plot driven, this usually means they use the characters to tell the argumental arch they want to communicate, despite their own characterizations many times.
Ugh, I would have much rather read about Jane than Rachel/Claire.-One thing rubbish about the series were the main characters always finding themselves in danger and bother but none of it was tense or exciting as it was obvious the MCs would be safe no matter what situation they were put in… Claire, Jamie, John Ian, William, Rachel, Bree, John, Roger, Jem will never be killed off so putting them in life threatening situations seemed pointless… It just made me sigh in boredom since I already knew they were going to be a-okay.-Bree and Roger not locking their doors was beyond daft.
Here we go with the review, as I prepare to commit Outlander heresy - as much as I loved this series (well, Echo not so much), and as happy as I was to read more about Jamie and Claire, et al - the negatives far outweigh the pluses.
There are two main storylines in this book, 1) Jamie/Claire/Lord John/William and all their friends and family traipsing around New England with the Continental Army and 2) Roger and Bree and their efforts to find young Jemmie.The parts I loved?
Perhaps I've changed and grown since the time I read (and loved!) the first six books.

I loved how a lot of things wrapped up or came together in this book.
But he blew me away with what he did (OMG...and the meaning behind the title of the book!!) and how he took care of Claire...and I loved every minute!
And as much as I love Jamie and Claire and could read about just them, the story is deepened by the other main characters stories and it wouldn't be the same without them.
I want something good to happen to him and John and Hal but I think there's still quite a journey to go for them.
This time she has not left us with huge cliffhangers but instead has given us a delightful ending.
I have to admit there is an inordinate amount of sexual activity and a surplus of information about bodily functions but I guess it fits with the way of life at that time and does not detract from an excellent story.
I thought there was going to be another book after this one but there does not really need to be.
If Gabaldon finished it here she would be going out on a high.
“IN THE LIGHT OF eternity, time casts no shadow. Your old men shall dream dreams, your young men shall see visions. But what is it that the old women see? We see necessity, and we do the things that must be done. Young women don’t see—they are, and the spring of life runs through them. Ours is the guarding of the spring, ours the shielding of the light we have lit, the flame that we are. What have I seen? You are the vision of my youth, the constant dream of all my ages. Here I stand on the br
Your old men shall dream dreams, your young men shall see visions.
But what is it that the old women see?
Young women don’t see—they are, and the spring of life runs through them.
Here I stand on the brink of war again, a citizen of no place, no time, no country but my own … and that a land lapped by no sea but blood, bordered only by the outlines of a face long-loved.” 
But then again, every book has been a five star read for me.
One or two parts of the book did have me welling up.
There has to be another book.
THE BEST ENDING EVER! I loved this book so much, one of my favorite instalments of this series :)
On the whole, I found the part of the story focusing on Jamie and Claire and the characters in their time and place (Lord John, William, Ian, Fergus & Marsali, etc.) to be more compelling than the Brianna/Roger/Buck part.
He seems to have done a lot of digging around into Claire and Jamie's story without letting anyone know about it when he was alive.) Anyway, this adds to Bree's urgency to get back to the past, retrieve Roger, and rejoin her parents, although this would take several trips through stones on different continents.
(view spoiler)[While traveling with Roger in 1738, he meets his mother, Geillis (more coincidence) and his putative father, Dougal.
Love the cover, March 25th 2014
You know how a story just sticks to you for days, like peanut butter on the roof of your mouth or more dryer socks to your mind and you peel back the layers of characters and detail and you get sparks and snaps and you rabbit trail in your brain and off you go in thought and end up writing a review with the longest run-on sentence on the planet this side of the Bulwer-Lytton Fiction Contest?That's me after reading Diana Gabaldon's latest installment in the Outlander series.The writing is fantastic.
5 Glorious Stars, then 5 more and then another 5!! Without question, the best book in this amazing series and I don’t even know how that’s possible, since the entire series as a whole is SUPERB! Would I want to wait 4 years+ for the next installment?? ABSOLUTELY NOT...but this was worth every second that ticked on the clock until it was released!! Diana Gabaldon poured her heart along with some of her own blood into this book!!  **Spoiler free review** There is heartache in this book, but it wil
Diana Gabaldon poured her heart along with some of her own blood into this book!!
There is heartache in this book, but it will also bring about tremendous joy and happiness for readers who love this series.
Moments of great sadness...that will bring you to your knees, where you will mourn alongside the characters you've come to love.
I understand the need to take the time to write a book as detailed as this one, but please Diana Gabaldon, I beg of you don't torture us like this again!
I know she doesn't write the book in order that we read it.
IT'S HERE, IT'S ON MY KINDLE.........Fuuuuuuuuuckkk Meeeeeeee!
In this eighth instalment and penultimate book of the Outlander series, we are treated to the great rollicking, rip-snorting ride we've come to expect from Diana Gabaldon.
Gabaldon has cleverly written this as a stand alone novel, so no prior experience of the Outlander series is necessary.
The tragic death of (view spoiler)[Henri-Christian (hide spoiler)] left a huge lump in my throat; what a delightful character he was, I loved him.
My quibble is that having already suspended our belief by the magic of the stones, why didn't Gabaldon let (view spoiler)[Rollo (hide spoiler)] live?
Reading this novel, I alternately laughed, cried, held my breath and cheered the characters on.
Gabaldon does it again with the 8th book in the Outlander series.
She has managed to reduce a rational woman (at least I think I am) into a bumbling romantic**sigh**.
This book has it all - history, intrigue, adventure, romance and a flavour of erotica.
I saved this one for the holidays so I could cozy up and take my time to escape back to the late 1700's with Jamie and Claire Fraser and their latest escapades.
What I love about these novels is simple: It feels like I've come home.
5 Stars for a novel I could read and reread again.
I can not wait for this book to come out Diana Gabaldon is by far my favorite and her books are the best.
I loved the relationship with Mandy and Jem. Of course they are brother and sister, but they have a very interesting connection that you learn more about as the story unfolds.Roger ends up going back to look for Jem (not spoiling) but he ends up in a time BEFORE Jamie and Claire time by a few years.
To be totally honest this book made me fall in love with William, he's an amazing man (just like his Da) but seriously I wanted to punch him a few times and tell him that there were worst men in the world he could discovered had fathered him.
These books are just SO damn good!
This installment in the series has been one of my favourites yet, I really couldn’t have loved it more!
And now I’m finally up to date with the series and after that bang of an ending, I’m just dying for the ninth book!
I loved that we got to see more of Bree and Roger’s story, they really are two of my favourite characters.
This was a damn fine book and I’m so glad I finally decided to read it after putting it off for so long!
As she ended Big, Enormous Book 7 on a cliffhanger, I and apparently a large portion of the world’s population were eagerly awaiting the Further Revelations that we could quite confidently predict would involve Family Secrets, Amazing Escapes, Sex, Time Travel, Warfare and Grisly Descriptions of Messy Surgery.
Things don’t go particularly well for William in this book so he’s generally surly or aggressive throughout, which makes me want to smack him.The side orders of family secrets concern Geilie Duncan and Buck, in a plotline that appears to vanish up its own fundamental orifice just when it’s starting to get interesting, and Fergus, who very sensibly decides not to give a damn about his family secrets and just get on with life, which is what William should do, really.Amazing Escapes.
I liked this and there were parts that I LOVED but I rarely got to those moments where I couldn't put this book down.
After waiting 4 years and having read the first 7 books one after the other, I really couldn't wait to see where this story was going to go.
I spoke to one of my friends (the one person on the planet who agrees with me about this book) and said, "I've waited 4 years and I'm 500 pages in and I feel like not a whole lot is happening." Now, part of this is my fault.
I also think I no longer like the genre as I mentioned earlier.
family?) is slowly sinking towards a ratio that no longer interests me.Personal opinion, purely no fact based at all...(view spoiler)[This is my personal opinion, but I feel like this book was more of a things that needed to be said to get out of the way before the final book comes out next.
Maybe I no longer like the genre or series, or maybe there's just too much of Roger/Bree now to make them enjoyable.
I savored this book, reading it super slow because it deserves it.
I was so immersed in the book that I was feeling what the characters were feeling so if I stopped at a hilarious part I would be in an fun-loving mood but if I stopped at an angry part then I wasn't in such a happy mood and my hubby stayed away from me or, at one point, demanded I read on to get out of that mood.
Brush up and get prepared because in a little over a week you will be reading this book too and loving it just as much!
The next chapter in the Outlander series...
And with this chapter, I think it is time for me to hang up my "Outlander" hat and bid adieu to these characters.Jamie and Claire Fraser have been through a lot in the years that they have been together.
Falling in love soon after an arranged marriage, Jamie and Claire seem a perfect couple.
They love each other very much.
This series is a saga of a couple and a family and it is richly detailed with history of the time and the events of the day always play a role in the plot.
