At school, we meet two other new students, Wilhemina or Bill whose whole life revolves around horses, especially her own horse Thunder, and Mavis who is supposed to have joined last term (but this is the first we meet her—I am not reading the books Blyton didn’t write for this challenge), and whose sole concern is her excellent voice which makes her rather conceited but also somewhat adored by Gwendolen Mary.
I wonder how Blyton formed her picture of the typical American girl, but Zerelda in this one is very like Sadie from St Clares concerned with her complexion, hair, and nails, and not much else even though they are good natured people, mostly.
Darryl Rivers returns to Mallory Towers for her third year. At the beginning of the book we found her best friend Sally is unwell and will return to school in two weeks.Three new girls start Zerelda a precocious child from America who wants to be a movie star. Horse mad Wilhelmina who only answers to Bill and finally Mavis who wants to be an opera singer.A nice little story of days gone by.
This book is just wunnerful. And if you don't know what I mean, go and read it. Read it? Okay, now isn't it just wunnerful?
Another series I want to pass a long - a childhood favourite for sure. Enid Blyton was always my favourite author
Wuaaah enak juga klo baca kumplit tuh! Jadi tau cerita-nya Mavis and Bill. Tp kayanya Si Hadid Amerika, Zerelda ngga begitu kedengeran dibuku2 selanjutnya. Tunggu... Tunggu... Mungkin kudu reread? 😌
I love the tricks they play on the teachers. I wonder if the things they use are real or made-up. Another good book.
I loved Malory Towers growing up, and I've rated books 1 & 2 much more highly, but this one I actually found a little hard to stomach. I think the addition of the American Zerelda and the attitude to ambition, passion - and difference - made for a much more racist, judgemental book compared to the previous two, something that I'd have thought could not be possible! Here's hoping the next three aren't as bad in this respect!
Deze boeken zijn gewoon zo fijn. Een en al drama, een en al gedoe, en alleen maar praise voor de hoofdpersoon. Dat is echt nog wel het mooiste, haha.
A short, funny read with some meaningful moments. A wonderful childhood reread.
Upss, yang klas 3 di Malory mah Darrell n kawan-kawan yah.
Gw suka kebawa masuk cerita nih :p (eh Malory mah skolah khusus cwe ya.
Gw kan cwo >.<)bagaimana pun, cerita ini sangat menarik.Mavis, dengan suara emas dan keinginan kuatnya menjadi penyanyi opera.
Namun akhirnya dengan berbagai kejadian, Zerelda menganggap teman-teman sekolahnya itu NUARR BIASAA.
Cwe gila kuda; yang ada di pikirannya hanya kuda, berkuda, n naik kuda ^_^.
Haduh, satu lagi pecinta kuda di buku ini.Oh, yang lucu hanya peristiwa bersin Mam'zelle.
Mam'zelle, Potty, dan ibu asrama.
Aduh bandel nya kelas tiga ini ^_^...Karena kejadian ini, libur setengah hari di tengah semester bagi anak-anak kelas tiga dibatalkan dan mereka dihukum.
This is the Third book in the Malory Tower series and the the first book I picked up during my childhood.
In fact this was the only book in the series I had during my childhood.
I picked up the rest during my college days.
As usual Enid Blyton brings out interesting ethical conflicts to fore through the challenges each girl encounters and her view of how to lead life.
I kind of like most of what Enid Blyton's view towards life and can be practically applicable even in today's world.
I think the Mallory Towers books are my favorite Blyton boarding school books. (Quite a statement, considering the number of boarding school books she's written.) And this one always makes me laugh. It's definitely a stop on the Enid Blyton Parade of Vices (bragging is bad and you will get your comeuppance!) but still: I can't believe they saw Americans like that. It's too funny for words. It's wunnerful.(Well, if you look closely, it's completely offensive, but might I remind you: Enid Blyton.)
The third book in the Malory Towers series. I’m actually not entirely certain why I’m continuing to read this series except to say that I’ve read it. That’s probably not a very good reason to pursue another 4 books, but at least they’re quick reading.It’s more of the same, with the new girls mixing it up for the form, and an occasional “trick” on a teacher, and some sort of life lesson along the way. Nothing exciting to write home about, but readable.
Darrell's third year brings new friends and challenges; will Darrell be up to the task? There's being nice to the uppity Zerelda, and American with an inflated sense of worth. Mavis is annoying the whole year with her vanity, and Alicia and Sally are bickering. All the while there are Lacrosse matches to be played, and tricks to be played. Another entertaining Malory towers book!
Darrel, she is my favourite character. Hot-bloaded, like me ;) and loyal with her friends.
In which Darrell encounters new girls Zerelda, a precocious American who needs taking down a peg or two, and Wilhelmina, or 'Bill', who turns out to be a good egg in spite of her gender dysphoria.
Pengalaman membaca ulang Malory Towers series ketika dewasa sangat berbeda dibanding ketika masih SD dulu namun di sisi lain selalu ada perasaan hangat yang terselip di setiap volumenya.Berkunjung kembali ke Malory Towers dari sisi orang dewasa, saya kembali jatuh hati di tulisan Enid Blyton ini.
Dan pengalaman saya membaca Malory Towers ini adalah ketika kelas satu atau kelas dua SD dulu.
Sudah 20 tahun-an yang lalu tapi saya masih mengingat garis besar alur cerita pada volume ini.
Salah satu bukti bahwa series ini mampu memikat hati anak-anak, setidaknya saya waktu kecil.
Tiba-tiba saya ingat dulu ketika selesai membaca buku ini, saya galau mencari dimana "Sally" saya.
In the book, a new girl, Zerelda, comes to Malory Towers and she is 16 years old.
This girl Darrell finds her.
That causes lots of problems because when Darrell’s best friend comes she gets really jealous of the friendship Alicia and Darrell have so; Alicia and Sally start fighting over Darrell.
To make things “right” Darrell badmouths Alicia behind her back to Sally saying how she can’t wait till Alicia’s best friend comes so she can stop hanging out with her.
That’s unfortunate for Darrell though because Alicia finds out which causes more problems than it did before.
One of my favourite of the original Malory Towers books, with all the old characters from the first two and introducing Bill, Zerelda and Mavis.
To me, this is the last book where the girls feel truly 'child-like'- as mentioned in the book, from the fourth form and higher, the girls are treated more like adults and they're growing up, so it only makes sense, of course.
I still also love the later books, but part of me loves re-reading the first few.
I suppose it makes me go back to feeling like a child myself, which is half the fun of keeping going back to them!
Not really as good as the first two books but good enough!!I feel like a 23 year old stuck to Pokemon reading these series.
Anyways, it was golly jolly as usual!I thoroughly enjoyed the part where Darrell Rivers actually made the Lacrosse team and yet was modest enough not to check for her name on the list...
Snizzes!!!....Ambition was something that carried importance all along the book!Though I wasn't really sure if Zerelda was actually speaking like an American even by the standards of 1940's.
That was probably the only place I found fault with the book and it felt kinda racist, else..
I adore Malory Towers. Beyond belief.Absolutely heartbroken as to have not read this when I was younger, but I'm enjoying them as much as I would at any other age! Makes me pine for a childhood at a boarding school.Such a rewarding escape from my days which are otherwise filled with UCAS and coursework!Would recommend to anyone!
The addition of new characters keeps being grat. I actuallly didmt love this one too much because the school stories are replanced sometimes by personal stories within the characteres, which were not my favourite. But yeah, i came to realize this series is kind of addictive for British ambients lovers. <3 ;)

Such a wunnerful tale! I should have liked to read this series when I was at school myself, but find the lessons just as insightful today. This also goes to show that well-written books have no age boundary, really.
Delightful twist in the last chapter; had my 7-year old gripped and shouting at the main character (who we’ve had to rename in her own image!🤪🤪🤪)
4.5/5
I'm enjoying these so much :)
Suka banget dengan kisah di buku ini, lebih banyak masalah anehnya dan lebih unik juga twist di endingnya.
Great read
An easy, moderately quick read, not as interesting as the first two.
Not my favourite of these, but still a good nostalgic read.
