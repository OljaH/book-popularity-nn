MY REVIEW:Are you, like so many others, wondering what God's will is for your life?
John MacArthur doesn't waste your time beating around the bush but rather gets right to the point - the simple truth of what God's will is for your life.
The quality of this audio book is great and it's smooth sound makes it a delight to listen to.
Each track is a chapter making it user friendly to "read" by chapter and to go back and review a principle.
A well written, thought provoking book by a teacher of the Gospel.
This book is for everyone at any stage in their walk in Christ.
If you are unaware of the will of God for you or if you are not sure if you are doing his will, this will definitely give you a clear vision.
It is the will of God above all,for all you embark on in your life that you succeed which is the fifth principle he talked about....so money is the will of God for me,he is running my want.But a hard nugget he mentioned was the suffering, nobody wants to suffer then again it takes a spirit-filled person to want the Glory of his suffering!!
Highly recommend this book
This should be required reading for every new Christian.
God's word has a lot to say about His will which is largely to walk with Him and grow in personal holiness.
My big take away from this book can be summed up by Psalm 37:4, namely that if "we delight ourselves in the Lord" (are walking with God), in communion through reading, prayer, listening, fasting, worshiping, evangelism, sharing, giving, etc, and the desires of your heart are not sin according to scripture, then it is safe to say that God is controlling the desires of your heart!

This book begins and ends with the Gospel of Jesus Christ.
People have been living their whole lives in offense to God; let them be offended for a while.”Most of the book is spent helping the reader to understand salvation and the Holy Spirit.
“Do you know what the Spirit-filled life is?
It is living every moment as though you are standing in the presence of Christ.”The remaining chapters address sanctification, submission and suffering.
“God’s will is that you be saved, Spirit-filled, sanctified, submissive, and suffering.”This is a small but powerful read that can be understood by the unsaved and Christians alike.
This was probably the greatest little book that I have ever read. It was only 61 pages long, and MacArthur used plenty of Scripture for reference and showed how simple it is in following the Lord's will. This book is not for the unsaved, but after they do get saved, it would probably be the most important book (excluding the Word of God), that a new Christian should possess and read.
This little booklet is clear and to the point concerning God's will in your life. He lays a foundation of five principles concerning God's will for the individual from Scripture. He arrives at what may be a surprising conclusion in the sixth principle. It is well worth your time to read and think on.
One of the best books I've ever read!
John MacArthur writes like he preaches - simple, clear and devoid of fluff. I have been reading books, articles and listening to sermons on God's will since I was a teenager. None (of those I read/listened to date) deals with the subject like MacArthur. He addresses the subject in a clear and logical way that "takes the mystery out of knowing God's will."The strength of this book is the practical - yet biblically sound - answers it provides. Unlike other literature on the subject, it does not leave its reader confused in the end - pleasantly surprised, but not confused.
Doing God's will for your life is not confusing or convoluted. MacArthur shows how the Bible clearly lays out God's will. Where the Bible does not speak we have the responsibility and freedom to make many nonmoral nontheological decisions. We need wisdom for these decisions but we do not have to worry about whether or not we are in our out of God's will for our lives as we make many everyday choices.
Very short and simple book on living out the will of God in your life. If you are wondering but don’t have time to read a bigger book I definitely recommend this one. It does have some liberating truths. In general though, the will of God for ones life is a controversial topic and if you are looking for a debate you won’t find it here.
Very quick and easy read (only 75 pages). A great look at what it means to be in God's will. It is not some fantastical thing. God clearly lays out, in His Word, what it means to be in His will. Once you have these things in mind or in place, do what you want. Read the book to find out what that means. Great for someone exploring and seeking after God's will 'for their life'.
It gave me a lot to think about, but I like having a clear understanding of things. It gives a checklist that I've placed on the front of my daily notepad, just to make sure I'm starting off on the right mindset. A full review to appear on my blog in time.
A short and easy explanation of God’s will for one’s life. God’s Word makes it clear for one to be saved, Spirit-filled, sanctified, submissive, and suffering. If we are doing those five principles than God will give you the right desires of your heart.
When struggling with how to make difficult decisions in life, this little book provides a wonderful method of how to think it through biblically.
من اول ما مسكت الكتاب وشوفت ثقة الكاتب ف نفسه لما قال انه بعد الكتاب دة مش هدور تانى على كتب بتتكلم عن المشيئة وانا اتوغوشت 😂🙋 مش شايفة ان الكتاب يستاهل ال rate العالى دة 😕
Not quiet like his dads writing, he has a way of condensing information down to a few key thoughts and telling it like it is.
Totally changed my perspective on The Will Of God. I no longer have to be anxious about what God's plan for my life. Ever!
Concise, gets right to the pointsIf you are living in total submission to God, there is no need to go looking for His will for your life. You will already be doing it.
Short but SweetThis quick read was right on point! What we make complicated is actually quite simple and clear. Well it's time to get moving... Jesus, take the wheel!
Good little book on the will of God. One important point, begin by doing the revealed will of God as found in Scripture.
Le meilleur petit livre sur cette question à la mode.
Quick read. Short little book. Packed with great wisdom on Gods will for your life!
Wonderful advice. Moving and inspiring, with facts and verses to support the 6 components of God's Will.
Simple, scriptural, and significantPresents five key areas in which God will first of all make you the right kind of person, enabling you to be doing the right things. Essential information for every saint.
John MacArthur’s Found: God’s Will has for many years been my go-to book to offer Christians a brief answer to the question of how they might understand God’s will in their lives. When Christians ask about God’s will, they are generally looking for advice on how to make a decision so as not to displease their Lord.

John MacArthur’s Found: God’s Will has for many years been my go-to book to offer Christians a brief answer to the question of how they might understand God’s will in their lives.
MacArthur, in only a few pages (or just over an hour of an audio book), offers as clear an answer as anyone I’ve seen.Positives	In his book and philosophy of discerning God’s will, John MacArthur is first and foremost biblical.
Taking God’s call in Psalm 37:4 to heart, the author concludes in his work that a Christian delighted in God and submitted to his commands will be free to do what he or she desires.
From christianaudio.comGET READY FOR A SURPRISE!You may want to jump and shout when you read the sixth principle for knowing when you have found God's will.The sixth principle is "Do whatever you want" as long as the first five principles are operating in your life.Read about all six principles to better understand what the psalmist means when he urges, "Delight thyself also in the Lord; and He shall give thee the desires of thine heart" (Psalm 37:4).Dr. John MacArthur, Jr. is pastor of Grace Community Church in Sun Valley, California, and president of The Master's College and Seminary.
The main thing I took away from Listening to this book other than the 6 principles presented was the way that MacArthur does his Bible reading.
Bible reading is an important part of the Christian life and this is a good way to incorporate into yours.
John MacArthur’s book Found: God’s Will is a helpful work on this subject since it is biblically driven and definitely not man-centered.
Excellent book, I do recommend it and I found it as a helpful resource for a series I was teaching through with my church’s mid-week fellowship on the sovereignty of God and His plans for our lives.
In that respect, I most definitely would not hesitate to recommend the book to such a person.
Recommending the author, JOHN MACARTHUR could be somewhat counter-productive as to why you're giving the person the book in the first place.MACARTHUR is a giant in the Christian/inspiration genre.
The Scripture is the basis for all the points made in the book.The structure is quite easy to follow, and it's a short, quick read.
If you can live with the tough persona the book offers, this could be worth the investment in terms of time and money to people already running the marathon and is definitely worth it to those at the start line.
