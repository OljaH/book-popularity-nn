I hope she enjoyed them as much as I did!The Mystery at Bob-White Cave is the 11th book in the series.
Trixie is really determined to find the fish because the club wants to donate the $500 to help buy a station wagon to transport handicapped kids to school in Sleepyside.
As usual the kids find themselves in the middle of mysterious goings on -- stolen fish, arson and a strange ghost man in the woods.
And who is the strange man in the woods?While this isn't one of the best books in the series, it is an enjoyable story.

This is one of my favorite books of the series.
I actually had visited Missouri on a family vacation, so it was nice to be in the Ozarks where Trixie was.
In fact, aside from New York, Arizona, and England, I have visited all the states the Bob-Whites visit...and even with Arizona, I was in New Mexico which is close enough.In this title, the kids visit Uncle Andrew's hunting lodge in the Ozarks, make new friends, solve another mystery, and also help someone who didn't even know they needed help.
Definitely a good book in the series!
The BWotG (minus Di and Dan) head to the Belden's uncle's mountain cabin to have a vacation, but end up solving a mystery involving an old man and fishes (but they get paid to find the fish so it's not as weird as it sounds).Recommended 9/10+ for scary situations and mentions of ghosts.
A childhood favorite re-visited.Is the story as good as I remember?
– Most of a day’s read.Characters?
– Memorable, several characters.Setting?
– Real world, pre - computer pre - air conditioning, pre - cell phone.Written approximately?
– 1963.Does the story leave questions in the readers mind?
Also, the absence of computers, cell phones, and air conditioning in homes, especially the mansion.Short storyline: Trixie Belden, Honey, Jim, and her brothers attempt amateur cave research to find cave fish in the three stages of blindness.
Plenty of geological science blends with politics and psychology to make for a confounding story.Notes for the reader: A great mystery!
This one is another Kathryn Kenney favorite, as well as the next book in the series. This is one of the series' best clump of books aside from the first six, the ones starting with Marshland Mystery and ending with Emeralds. Four stars out of five.
I slowly amassed the whole series as first editions (it seemed so glamourous as a kid owning precious books that were older than me!) by saving all my pocket money to buy them from the local secondhand store.
They sat in a back corner of the store, thankfully ignored by everyone else, as I slowly acquired them through pocket money and then in a mass swoop for Christmas.
One of the ones I enjoyed as a child.
Still enjoyed it...
even with the obvious word use changes from then to today.
There is mild racism in these books - definitely not overt.
I think some of it might've just been because of the time in which the books were written.
No excuse for it, though.Sadly, I think kids today might get stuck on some of the words used in the book that have entirely different meanings today.
I wonder if today's youth would realize that in a book like this when they call someone or something queer, they are using it with the definition that means "odd."
Subtle shift in the voice in this one that bothered me a bit.
This is the book that sparked my desire to go spelunking. I will do it some day!
I read as many of these books as I could get my hands on as a pre-teen and teen girl.
They are all written by different authors under the pseudonym Kathryn Kenny (except for the first seven books) but they are all so well written that you can barely tell that they are written by many different people.
This mystery in particular might be one of my favourites as it includes the beliefs in supernatural and some very quickly unlikable "villains".
I am still trying to collect these books but it's nostalgic to sit and read these books again (and nice to have a read that's easily done in a day or two).
This is odd, of course, because they were MEANT for teen and pre-teen girls, but I was a young boy that read everything he could get his hands on and when I first stumbled on my first TRIXIE BELDON book I was instantly hooked!
Trixie is the star, or "lead" character, followed by Jim and Honey (who quickly became the love of my young life, I had a total crush on a fictional character that only existed in ink) and this brave trio was constantly getting into trouble, solving mysteries and murders; that sort of thing.
I lost all of my Trixie books years ago, lending them to friends and that sort of thing.
Trixie Belden and the Mystery at Bob-White cave is book number eleven in the Trixie Belden mystery series.
While they are there, Trixie hears about a reward of $500 to anyone who finds three ghost fish in three different stages: eyes, half eyes, and no eyes.
Trixie finds two out of the three ghost fish needed to win the reward, but they suddenly go missing.
It is up to Trixie and the Bob-Whites to find out before something even worse happens!!I love the Trixie Belden Mystery Series because it combines two of my favorite things - - horses and mystery.
The other kids are saying "hey, let's stop and have dinner" and Trixie jumps all over them "don't you WANT to get the reward so we can buy the station wagon for the handicapped children?" And then the scene after she almost drowns in the sinkhole.
Uncle Andrew is understandably reluctant to let them spelunk again and Trixie gets all hysterical "we have to win the reward!
We have to buy that station wagon!" she shrieks.
I think there needs to be a Trixie Belden book where she embraces meditation and yoga.
For Christmas one year, my parents grabbed me the entire Trixie Belden set and I couldn't put them down.
After I finished with them, they continued to purchase them as quickly as I could read them.
Even with a learning disability, I devoured the books.
I look back now and I find that Trixie Belden was much more age related to young girls, particularly to me, reading the books than Nancy Drew.
There was something in these books that I found to be a greater escape than I did ND, too.
I found that they weren't so "over the top" or dated.
While visiting their uncle in the Missouri Ozarks, Trixie comes across an article that offers a large cash reward to anyone who can find three ghost cave fish.
Thinking that the club could use the money to help buy a car for handicapped children Trixie is determined to enter the contest and win the money.
The Bob-whites soon find out that they aren't the only ones looking for this ghost fish and that someone will stoop to dangerous and illegal methods to win the reward, including theft and arson!
Join they Bob-whites as they explore caves and have a great time in The Mystery at Bob-White Cave!
The gang heads to Uncle Andrew's fishing lodge in the Ozarks. Trixie gets everyone to go spelunking in hopes of finding some cave fish and winning $500 for charity. But it looks like there's competition from an Englishman, plus Trixie doesn't quite trust their guide. Throw in a "ghost" cabin and you've got another mystery for Trixie to solve.Although I enjoy most of the Trixie Belden books, this is problem my least favorite - I think because the thought of being in a cave scares the bejeezus out of me!
I've been re-reading some of the books I loved as a kid because I'm keen to give mystery-writing for kids a bash. I was a huge Trixie Belden fan. Now, I find them a little cliché - Brian; the sensible eldest sibling for example. But I still like the impetuousness of Trixie. It's also a good example of kids wangling out from under the controlling noses of adults to have adventures. I must admit my adult self finds Trixie a bit overly-demanding and inquisitive but perhaps this is a pre-requisite for a teen investigator!
These guys traveled more than I ever thought of traveling at that age!!! :)**As of September 24th 2007, I am officially LOOKING TO GET MY BOOKS BACK!!!!~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~RE-READ~December 8, 2013 This is one that I must not have read very often as well. It is a good book with lots of drama, but there was a LOT that I didn't remember!!!
I read this as a kid and found an early hardcover edition, complete with illustrations at a book sale held by my local library last year. After putting it in the "childhood classic" section of my bookshelf, I decided to revisit it and really enjoyed doing so. There is a certain innocence and naivety that you just don't find in today's books. By 21st century standards, the wholesomeness is somewhat corny, but it is also rather refreshing.
One that constantly ranks near the bottom of the list for me. Trixie is such a pod brat in this one and the "podness" seems to have trickled over to Jim and Brian (Rock hounds? Really??) and Honey who reverts to her scaredy-cat persona. This is the book where Jim's eyes infamously become blue. I didn't care for the caves or all the Ozark superstitious folk, either.
Another good, not great, one. With a few exceptions, I really don't like the ones away from home. Some of them (Mystery in Arizona was the worst one) read more like a history lesson, like the book was just to tell/teach about Arizona, rather than a typical Trixie mystery. Still, none of these are bad.
Trixie and her friends are visiting Uncle Andrew again, this time in the Ozarks. The gang is hunting for some ghost fish, but they find danger and possibly real ghosts. Trixie isn't at her best here, but the plot is fun.Read my full review at Carstairs Considers.
Book 11. Another book without Dan *sigh* (but also minus Diana who I never liked anyway so that was ok). And the fish mentioned in it just fascinated me when I was little and read this. I wanted to know if they were real.
I am rereading this series from my childhood as I come across them either in used bookstores or on Amazon. Even today, I prefer these over Nancy Drew (although I enjoy her, too) and am glad that they're coming back out so a new generation can dream about joining a cool gang and having adventures!
I wish I hadn't learned about all the different ghost writers of this series; now I find myself nit-picking each story. When the Englishman is drowning, it seemed wrong to have Trixie aid in the rescue. Honey is the group's strongest swimmer.
Another good mystery, with some "travelogue" value as they visit the Ozarks. Not one of my top favorites of the series, but a good story.September 2013 ... another travel mystery ... enjoyed the descriptions of an area I've been to a couple of times ...
I loved this whole series my Mom passed them all down to me.
Join Trixie as she explores some caves
My schoolmate Peggy owned the whole series of these books, and loaned them to me one or two at a time to read in junior high school. I loved them!
