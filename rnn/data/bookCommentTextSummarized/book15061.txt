Another fun read and Phillip was the third hero, after Simon and Anthony, where daddy played a big role in how their life. Sadly it was bad influence here and innocent kids had to suffer. In all three books, this influence played a huge part in some of the vital decisions that our heroes took and it felt a little repetitive
It’s brilliantly written, fun, funny, serious and heart-warming all at the same time with a nice dollop of steam to go with it ;)The novel starts out with Eloise Bridgerton’s quest to find a husband because she’s feeling spinsterish at the ripe old age of 28.
Eloise Bridgerton is outgoing, smart and knows what she wants but she doesn't overshadow him and he still keeps his sexy "alphaness".For those of you who have read the other Bridgerton novels you’ll get back that family familiarity as the other members of the clan (the brothers primarily –and they are hilarious!) become central to the story at one point.
What a brave man!
What a sexy hunk of man-flesh.
*sigh*Eloise, with her common sense ways and affection for children which comes from being part of a large family, is probably the one person who can save Phillip and his two young children from a life of loneliness and misery - but is he too scarred by his past to accept what she has to offer?
You'll have to read it for yourself and find out.With her Bridgerton series, Julia Quinn has come up with a delicious recipe for magic which she prepares and serves up beautifully each and every time.
With To Sir Phillip With Love, I felt Eloise started to come into her own, she started to see that taking your time, not pushing your way through things and learning to listen then having to fill the air with nonsense.
His wife also did a number on him, which made him feel nervous and unsure of himself on how the truly treat Eloise, through these trail and errors both learned to compromise with each other and that only built a stronger and loving relationship that all couples face and deal with.
And this is said to be one of the not-so books in the series?
I loved it!
Phillip was a flawed, traumatized, silent and brooding hero, just like I like them.
The twins were a delight to read about, and the relationship to their father was so bittersweet to watch, it made my eyes misty.
All in all, I must say that the darker undertones in this read didn't bother me at all, because they were done in a perfect blend with the humorous scenes.
Nothing left to say here, other than that this read was perfect.
Sir Phillip Crane je udovac sa dvoje male djece koji se bavi botanikom.
Njih dvoje nastavljaju konverzaciju dok u jednom pismu sir Phillip ne predloži Eloise da se uda za njega, iako se nikad nisu sreli.
Komplikacije nastaju zato što je Eloise dovela svoju reputaciju u pitanje bežeći kod sir Phillipa, a zatim postaje sve više nesigurna u to da li njih dvoje odgovaraju jedno drugome.
“Toliko te silno volim.”Zagrli je i ona položi obraz na njegova prsa, a on nježno svoju bradu na njezinu glavu.
“To je svaki dan s tobom, Eloise.
Svaki dan s tobom.” On joj dodirne bradu i prinese usne njezinima.
Phillip öküzü, hödüğü, odunu yüzünden 1 veresim vardı ama seriyi ve aileyi çok seviyorum. Bir insan anca bu kadar kaba olur. Sanki 30 yıl mağarada ayılarla yaşamış gibiydi. Eloise iyi dayandı valla.Erkek kardeşler ve Eloise biraraya gelince diyaloglar çok güzeldi yine. Kardeşleri ve anneleri okurken çok eğleniyorum, özellikle Colin ve bitmek bilmez iştahına bayılıyorum.😃😃
Το λιγότερο ενδιαφέρον -για εμένα- βιβλίο, της σειράς εως τώρα.

I've given this an A+ for narration and an A- for content at AudioGals.This fifth instalment in Julia Quinn’s Bridgerton series is one of the books I have somehow not got around to reading, and which, for some reason I can’t remember, I had thought to be one of the weaker books in the series.
It’s an odd notion, to be thinking of marriage to a woman he has never met, but from the tone of her letters, Phillip judges Eloise to be an amenable, sensible kind of woman – and quite honestly, he is so desperate for someone to run his house and, more urgently, manage his children, that marriage to almost anyone would be preferable to things continuing as they are.You can read the rest of this review at 
I believe this has been the best book in the series so far.
Books 1 and 2 were amazing but this one just got me sobbing many times, LOL.Phillip and Eloise were such an amazing couple, just perfect for each other, exactly what they needed.
I mean, the other couples in the series were really good together but not as perfect as this 2.
If I imagine myself with kids I want 2 just like this.I have to say that book 3 and 4 were not as good as 1 and 2 for me, but the 5th was the best in the series.
Can't wait to read book 6.
This series is amazing.
The characters struggle with real problems, and ambivalent feelings.
Ambivalence makes this novel so real, because feelings and relationships are never black or white.
The tone of the story mirrors this: it's light and humorous, but also serious and heartbreaking.I loved Phillip's character.
He suffers from the memory of his painful childhood, and suffocates with guilt he feels for his tragic first marriage.
Although she is 28, she is not bitter, and doesn't settle for anything less than a love marriage.
My favorite scene is the entrée of the Bridgerton brothers into Phillip’s home.
I definitely expected better characterization for Eloise but she's mostly just generic Regency girl with a side of "doesn't she talk a lot?" Phillip, on the other hand, is a self-centered snot-weasel and never actually gets past that.
I should have stopped reading then because (view spoiler)[he never gets better or changes his plan or does anything at all to help his children.
Not a single stupid thing (hide spoiler)].And then he shows Eloise his idea of "seeing if we suit" by (view spoiler)[diverting her into the library and engaging non-sex sex to give her an orgasm.
Ainsssss los Bridgherton. ....que bueno que es este también y que final......me quedan los dos pequeños nada más, pero mi favorita sigue siendo la historia de Franchesca
Nuestra reseña en A la cama con... un libro Me lo he devorado
4.5 stars
There is no easy way to find the one.And for Eloise Bridgerton, the search was definitely not easy.
Sir Phillip’s last letter ended with a marriage proposal of sorts, where he was asking Eloise to spend a fortnight at his home, with a chaperon of course, to see if they would suit.
She already imagined Sir Phillip to be immediately on his knees as soon as he sees her and propose his undying love for her.
Sir Phillip just stood there, and it was awkward.But somewhere along the way, love just happened.
She didn’t instantly know, but she knew that love must be it.
4.5*Adorei, meu Deus, como eu amo romance de época, eu vou ser sincera eu só peguei este livro porque estou a espera do livro da Colleen, e como ele ainda não chegou eu olhei para a minha estante e disse vou continuar com a série dos Bridgerton e não me arrependi nada eu achei o livro tão bonito e tão bem conseguido, que terminei tão rápido que me deu vontade de mais.
Este livro conta a história da 5°irmã Bridgerton a Eloise, ela tem uma personalidade muito fofa é super tagarela, e decida, ela no início do livro acabou de fugir da festa da sua irmã Daphne para ir conhecer o Sir Phillip um botânico que ficou viúvo e que desde então que trocaram correspondência.
It wasn't as good as the previous ones simply because of the main male character, Sir Phillip!
I explain: Sir Phillip just wanted a woman to make his life easier, so that he wouldn't have to worry about 'stupid things' and could do whatever he wanted with his life and ultimately have all the fun!
A BIG NO TO YOU SIR PHILLIP!Yeah...
I'm kind of mad about the way this character thought and did things...
but the other characters, the events with the rest of the family, the writing and even the love story was still good, so 3 stars!
A year before Penelope and Colin got married, Eloise started a secret correspondence with a country landowner, Sir Phillip Crane, a widower whose late wife was Eloise's cousin.
Just when Eloise was wallowing in self-doubt after her best friend married her brother, she received THE letter from Phillip.
Phillip was content to have Eloise as a sex partner, a housekeeper and a nanny for his children.
The last few chapters were devoted to Phillip's change in his attitude to his children and Eloise.
Both Eloise and Phillip are more than what meets the eyes.
First reading 2011/08/11WONDERFUL!!!Second reading 2016/03/06It started off with a letter, and turned out to be a correspondence that lasted well over a year, but when Eloise Bridgerton is asked an marriage proposal through a missive she’s a leery to even think about it, but when an event of marriage between her best friend and fellow spinster takes place, Eloise feels this may be her last chance at marriage and love.
Eloise's best friend (whom she assumed would never marry) marries her brother (the plot of Romancing Mr. Bridgerton, the 4th book in the series.) When I first started reading it, I thought I would really like it.

I was not sure going into this without Penelope's funny alter-ego cunning reporter...and I put this in my maybe-later shelf. It was definitely enjoyable but I missed our reporter way too much. So Eloise and Sir Philip, God knows, I like my heroines little bit less cheeky but cannot help but love Eloise. Sir Philip is grumpy, old man. So, at the end, it felt like Eeyore and Tigger pair...I didn't enjoy until all Bridgerton brothers entered the story but after that it was too entertaining to put it down! Then all's well that ends well...happily ever after!
Qué gusto leer nadismos así, con enaguas y sin pichotismos.
The poor h didn't know how to handle it all.I appreciated the fact that the H was not a rake or a man about town, even from before he was married for the first time.
Of course this being HR, the h did get what she deserved, specifically a partner who truly appreciated and loved her for who she was, not just for what role she could fulfill in his life, but it was very late in coming.Overall, judging from other reviewers, I can see why this was the best of the Bridgerton series.
Eloise, being, well, Eloise decides to leave home in the middle of the night and arrive unannounced at Sir Philip's country estate.The tale that unfolded was filled with the humor one comes to expect when you think of Quinn and the lively, if not unruly Bridgertons.
Of course, she didn't think anything through, and I am quite sure her brothers have different ideas.I enjoyed the tale that unfolded from the pranks to the impossible Sir Philip.
Quinn did this couple justice, and I enjoyed the complications brought on by Eloise's rash decisions and the twins.Rosalyn Landor continues to grow on me as a narrator and has become the voice of the Bridgertons.
A great romance with two very different leading characters, both vividly written and complex (+ perfect for each other) (4 stars) [May 1824, Gloucestershire:] To Sir Phillip, With Love is Julia Quinn's fifth Bridgerton book and one of the only ones (besides for When He Was Wicked) in the series that I had not yet read.
I completely believed what they say when they talk about / realize their love for each other, why, and what parts of each of them compliments and is needed by the other, however I felt like a little chunk of the story was missing between the declaration of the problem / fight over it and the discussion in which they resolve it all.BOTTOM LINEDefinitely read; great book and another wonderful story about one of the Bridgerton family members!
4.5 "The Spinster & the Widower Fall in Love" Stars for the story and narration!What a delectable listen, and a fabulous addition to the Bridgertons' Series.
Rosalyn Landor as always does a great job of bringing the lively and varied cast of To Sir Phillip, With Love to life.
This has the added effect of allowing the listener to just sit back and enjoy as the story plays out on your earbuds.All in all, To Sir Phillip With Love is a great addition to the Bridgertons' series.
Κι αν θέλετε τη γνώμη μου, τα καταφέρνει περίφημα.Το "παιχνίδι", λοιπόν, όπως προείπα, ανάμεσα τους δύο αυτούς χαρακτήρες, που μοιάζουν τόσο ετερόκλητοι και που, όμως, στην πραγματικότητα, έχουν τόσα πολλά κοινά στοιχεία, αποδεικνύεται διασκεδαστικό, έξυπνο, πνευματώδες, από εκείνα που χαίρεσαι να γίνεσαι μάρτυράς τους και να τα παρακολουθείς, όχι επειδή δεν ξέρεις πως θα καταλήξουν, αλλά γιατί σ' ευχαριστεί απίστευτα η διαδρομή μέχρι ωσότου να φτάσεις σ' εκείνο το σημείο.
Phillip, el protagonista le ha faltado un poco para enamorarme completamente, la autora ha estado tan preocupada para mostrarnos en que no se da cuenta que se esta enamorando de Eloise que al final me ha resultado un poco cansino, ha habido veces que en una sola página ha llegado a repetir, por lo menos 3 veces que se casaba por el bien de sus hijos, me daban ganas de decirle, no lo repitas más pesado,que eres muy pesado.Eloise me ha gustado por su valentía por querer buscar algo más.
