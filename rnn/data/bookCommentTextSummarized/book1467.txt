Heavy readingProbably doing this an injustice but I just found it to be real heavy going. Had to force myself to read on.
In particular, Bennett's descriptions of street life in high-Victorian London are nothing short of fascinating.
Streets as a form of entertainment in themselves is a concept largely alien to contemporary society, but the mind-boggling array of performers and acts on display for the Victorian promenader make the human statues on the modern South Bank seem even more boring and pretentious than they already are, which is a feat in itself.
And this is just one aspect of London that Bennett documents for us.
There is a fair bit about railways, but he even manages to make that fascinating by recalling how passengers would regularly find themselves decapitated when looking out of the windows near the Woolwich tunnel.
I just picked this up for $1.39 on Amazon (for Kindle). It was written in the 1920s. Looks interesting, but we shall see. I ordinarily would only download a free sample until I was sure I wanted it, but I felt flush this morning. (Ha.) Thing is, if I really find it helpful, I'll probably track down a print copy if possible because when it comes to research materials, I need my ability to highlight, post-it and scribble in the margins. I'm analog girl when it comes to that kind of thing.
This book are the memoirs and reflections of Alfred Rosling Bennett. I read it for research to get a fill of the time period and found myself loving it for all the details I did not know about. It's limited to the author's personal experiences, but there are so many good finds. This book was brought to Amazon by Victorian London and Lee Jackson.http://www.victorianlondon.org/Highly recommended.
found this a bit heavy going ... some of the observations are interesting but the style is pompous
