Suzuki's talks on zazen are spare and direct, demystifying Buddhism as a religion or philosophy and continually bringing the focus back to the simple and perfect practice of sitting--cleaning out your mind through meditation.
Whether you meditate or not, Suzuki provides useful and illuminating truths for anyone interested in becoming more mindful.
So when you try hard to make your own way, you will help others, and you will be helped by others.
To be independent in this true sense, we have to forget everything which we have in our mind and discover something quite new and different moment after moment.
“In the zazen posture, your mind and body have the great power to accept things as they are, whether agreeable or disagreeable.” How do I put this into words? This does actually work. Simple Zen meditation on a nightly basis does help to put things into perspective. It helps clear the mind and get rid of those false delusions and expectations; it helps you move away from dangerous attachment and recognise the impermanence of everything. Not to mention its benefits in reducing stress and actual

As we get older we always look back to a time in the past and cling to it, we wish to go back to it, which is folly because at each stage in our life we are doing the same thing.
Learn the state of emptiness.Open your Zen mind and begin to walk down the path of Buddhism.
If and when you meet The Buddha, Kill him. Then come back And sit. Sit In Zazen. Be. Enlightenment is there,Before it arrives.
It's not that the book is difficult to read, but that the insights offered by Suzuki Roshi (undeniably a great zen master) are the insights of an old man who has been practicing zen for a long time and talking to serious zen students for a long time.
You have to already know the benefits of Zen and Buddhism before you read this book, or it will bore you and turn you off of Zen. A true beginner is the person off the street who is sincerely interested in Zen but doesn't know why he or she should start a serious practice.
p99 To cook is not just to prepare for someone or for yourself; it is to express your sincerity.
A series of commentaries on the practise of Zen. I imagine that someone familiar with some other form of Buddhism might find this book rather curious.The more you understand our thinking the more you feel it difficult to talk about it (p90) by which measure it seems that I apparently have an excellent understanding of it, but I can say that there are two themes that crop up in a lot of the talks.
For a few moments just sit and let everything in your mind and your life be as it is.Take a few minutes now and then to be a beginner in whatever you do.
There may be some difficulty, of course, but there is no fear." I'm pretty sure that Shunryu Suzuki would not mind if you incorporate the wisdom in his book to wherever you are in life, whatever religious beliefs you have (or not have).
Shunryu Suzuki sometimes calls it big mind, sometimes he calls it our true nature.
This book is balm. My second reading. It contains its own instructions for reading too. If some metaphor or anecdote seems too dense, just let it pass. There is no need to read the text as closely as I just have; that’s me. Suzuki-roshi explains it all. Toward the end it gets a little bit repetitious; that’s because these are in fact transcripts—elegantly edited—of talks given at Tassajarra Zen Mountain Monastery, Los Altos, California in 1969 or so. Really worthwhile if you seek big mind.
Who am I to argue with Brad?As the subtitle "Informal talks on Zen meditation and practice" implies, the essays in this book are transcripts of lectures Shunryu Suzuki gave to students, arranged by topics.
Suzuki gave those lectures to people who were already practicing Zen, so it assumes you are familiar with basic teachings and meditation techniques.
This is the best non-academic introduction to Zen Buddhism that I've come upon. What caught me especially was a moment in the introduction when an interview with Suzuki was interrupted by his wife. She was serving tea, overheard part of his discourse and remarked to the interviewer that, in essence, he was full of shit, having never attained satori--all given and taken in good humor.
An old Zen Master used to shout at his young students, “You’ve got to climb to the top of a thousand-foot wooden pole!“Well, we all know such poles aren’t made that high.
As you open the door to the conference room, you see your zipper‘s at half-mast...Or you‘re coming home from a nice, harmless office Christmas party.
For the REST of our lives.Not every Zen master is a sadist who wants to open a trap-door beneath our feet!No, there are kinder, gentler means to make us get back up and stand on our own two feet.C‘mon you little fighter,No need to get uptighter.C‘mon you little fighter -Just get back up again.
I read this book, learned a lot, and decided to do the exact opposite. what is the opposite of Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind exactly? I dunno. Crazy Expert Mind?
There is some wisdom here, and in Zen Buddhism generally, but the delight Suzuki takes in paradoxes and contradictions serves to obscure his meaning, rather than illuminating it, eg 'we prepare by being unprepared'.The book gets its title from his contention that wisdom consists in being open to the present moment, with the eagerness of the beginner, rather than closing oneself off like the self-styled expert.
A closely related concept is that of zazen, which, to the extent I understand it, involves being in the present moment, without judgment, analysis or anxiety, accepting what comes and not struggling against the present reality.
As a music performance major who is burned out and bitter going into her last year of her undergraduate career, this book was invaluable for its ability to have the notion of practicing zazen also be equal to practicing her instrument.I have taken a bit of a break from meditation and music for 3-4 months now, and these informal talks are exactly the kind of thing I need to get myself to head in the right direction. It's a book that I recommend re-visiting often, for it provides a perfect impetus to look at yourself honestly.

"When you become you, Zen becomes Zen. When you are you, you see things as they are, and you become one with your surroundings."
What I like about books about Buddhism, Taoism and so on, is that they make you feel really relaxed and accepting of yourself.
Although self-improvement books on how to get rich, find love, loose weight etc.
are great, it's nice to hear that life can be uneventful and boring, yet completely satisfying if you just stop and relax.
PS: On a personal note: People who have been the happiest in their lives, who lived the longest and didn't get ill as often, were not the ones that were rich, successful or popular, but the ones that had the strongest relationship with his/her partner and their family and friends.

"patience" Virya.........."energy or enthusiasm" Dhyana......"meditation" Prajna........"wisdom"** Not to be attached to something is to be aware of its absolute value.** When we sit in the cross-legged posture, we resume our fundamental activity of creation.Types of Creation———————-1.
You should find your own way.Limiting your activity——————————** Concentrate on the activity you do in each moment** When your mind is wandering elsewhere, you have no chance to express yourself** If you understand the secret of practice, wherever you go, you yourself are boss.** The problem is you, yourself.
You don't have to understand it to love it: I bought this book eighteen years ago.
When I bought it, I understood little of it but for the past 18 years it has been my favourite companion book helping me to calm down before I went to sleep.
I have never read "a new age book" and pride myself on being hard-headed, but nonetheless the soothing, calm prose was reassuring even if enigmatic.
18 years on, I now actually understand quite a bit of it and read it not only for the prose style but for the meaning.
This book was put together from a series of lectures by Shunyru Suzuki who was one of the first Zen Buddhist teachers to share Buddhism with Americans in the middle to late 20th century.
Because of him I found that I was very attracted to meditation practice and to his particular style of teaching.
He was a good spiritual friend.
In this book Shunryu expresses the heart of Zen in the simplest but most profound ways.
His style is casual but enigmatic.
If you want to get a feel for Soto Zen, this is the best book you'll find.
As an introductory book to Zen Buddhism, this is quite daunting or useless.
This book is really not where you should be starting as the first point for any sort of reading on Buddhism - Zen or not.
I'd recommend reading something else first, actually attending a zazen session somewhere and *then* reading this book to get the full impact.Suzuki's talks are very elliptical and it can sometimes be hard to decipher, but I think the spirit of the book is that you shouldn't even *try* to decipher it.
Rather, just try to *feel* what his words mean.
This book is a classic to be read from time to time.
At present I am not reading it but have convinced my 15 year old sn to read it hoping that it, together with long conversations and care, will immediately help him with his teenage angst.
Even more, I hope the ideas in the book can be planted now to bloom later.Those are just some thoughts about some present concerns.
The main reason for the posting is to pass on something I read that as not in a book.
It is this powerful Zen koan.
Count the stars in the sky.
And maybe to the Zen true-believer (Western or otherwise) it’s Zen-lite, I don’t know.
After you have practiced for a while, you will realize that it is not possible to make rapid, extraordinary progress.
In a fog, you do not know you are getting wet, but as you keep walking you get wet little by little.
The most important part of the book is not the classification “Zen” or even the specific practice of zazen (zen meditation); it’s the idea of being a perpetual beginner.

always stay a beginner
Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind by the late Shunryu Suzuki is the most interesting book on Zen Buddhism I've read so far.
It is a collection of talks Shunryu Suzuki made not long before he died.
Unlike some collection of this kind, it does have a good sense of build up, and I think that is because Suzuki intended this to be published.
So one doesn't get a lot of the repeated material than sometimes happens in books that have been written in this manner.One does get a good dose of contradictions with it, and Zen Buddhism seems to have a lot of those.
Suzuki talks about meditation.
While I have now read all the words on all the pages, I don't think I'm actually finished with this book. And I don't mean that the thoughts will stick with me, though that is true. What I mean is that I will skim parts of this book again, maybe even soon. Or I will reread sections of it, thinking about the ideas again. For as simply as the words are written, the ideas have oceanic depth, I'm going to be swimming here for quite a while.
The title "Beginner's Mind" could/might mislead a few, as it refers to the idea of maintaining an open, childlike mind, and never acting or feeling as though one has ACHIEVED enlightenment.
Actually, if it isn't paradoxical it can't be Truth ;) Simple mind-changing concept which at first were difficult to accept (and even more to practice!) but it helped me to understand and accept the unchanging universe and to appreciate what I still have--life.Am beginning to realize the profoundity..at least to the extent my newbie Zen mind can grasp!Would I recommend it?YES - Not just to folks curious about Zen but to anybody who is curious at all.
Necessário ser relido todos os anos para lembrarmos, apenas lembrarmos.
it was really surprising to me how much of this book applies to creativity and art. http://tumblr.austinkleon.com/post/45...
Good!
