but I know that he is deeply brilliant, and I would say something ridiculous that I would turn over and over in my head (mentally, to myself) for years.
I had forgotten that I owe my discovery of Steinbeck to my friend Erica, who read East of Eden in 8th grade, when I was still churning through Nancy Drew, Mary Higgins Clark and V.C. Andrews.
I wasn't ready to tackle East of Eden yet, but I picked up a copy of Of Mice & Men/Cannery Row ...
Rating: 6* of fiveThe Publisher Says: Ethan Allen Hawley, the protagonist of Steinbeck’s last novel, works as a clerk in a grocery store that his family once owned.
It is also his last novel.Some people at the time it was published felt it was a wrong turning for Steinbeck (The Grapes of Wrath, Tortilla Flat) to abandon both the west coast that had made him famous and brought his considerable social conscience to the world's attention for an east coast grifter's POV.
Here...no, no one qualifies as all good or all bad.The POV is of Ethan, a man who is the degenerate scion of a venerable family.
Although the committee believed Steinbeck's best work was behind him by 1962, committee member Anders Österling believed the release of his novel The Winter of Our Discontent in 1961 showed that "after some signs of slowing down in recent years, [Steinbeck has] regained his position as a social truth-teller [and is an] authentic realist fully equal to his predecessors Sinclair Lewis and Ernest Hemingway." – Wikipedia.I read several of his works in HS, many moons ago, and last year returned to his canon with his short, brilliant work The Moon Is Down.
Dick, much less ever read his work, but a fan of Steinbeck’s writing may be pleasantly surprised to visit PKD’s short list of non science fiction works.Also, and this likeness is more obscure – Peter Benchley’s Jaws is the literary descendant of Steinbeck’s east coast morality play.
The key to the latter seems to come back to cheating or stealing.Well-liked in spite of the acidic wit he dispenses around his wife Mary and adolescent children Ellen and Allen, Ethan's fortunes begin to change when his wife's friend, a gold digging floozy with a flair for fortune telling named Margie Young-Hunt, forecasts that Ethan is destined to become one of the most important men in town.
Ethan learns of big changes coming to New Baytown and by virtue of his family name, seems poised to benefit.
I cried for what I knew was his major loss and yet I ended still hoping he could find some way to live with what he had done without resorting to lying to himself, which would only deepen the corruption.This is the world he lives in, and I dare say it is the world we live in as well:The Town Manager sold equipment to the township, and the judges fixed traffic tickets as they had for so long that they did not remember it as illegal practice--at least the books said it was.
And, to quote Mark 8:36, "For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?"There is a reason John Steinbeck is considered one of the great American authors.

When I started reading this, the last novel written by John Steinbeck, I initially thought that I wasn’t going to like it.
The prose was as fine as I expected it to be, but it seemed such a small story, compared to powerful epics like The Grapes of Wrath and East of Eden.
Mostly in the form of a first person narrative, the novel is about Ethan Hawley, a likeable man in his late thirties, married to a woman he loves and the father of two teenagers.
Anyone reading this novel who expects another Grapes of Wrath or East of Eden is bound to be disappointed.

Steinbeck shows us something into ourselves, he states in the book that we all have our own light, we are not a bonfire.
Steinbeck, like Woolf in the Waves, shows us that we are all connected, and that we can find a path in this world through this novel.
This novel has been criticized by others for being lacking in the character development and depth of his other novels like East of Eden and Grapes of Wrath.
I don't think this would be my first recommendation for a Steinbeck novel, I think one needs to understand his changes from Grapes, Eden, etc.
Evanescence of Morality Maybe it's my age where I find myself amidst a thousand questions because I like to think that I am understanding a little of what goes around. And as it goes with books, the count of unanswered questions is on an exponential run. Anyway, the most prominent and adamant question I find myself wrestle with these days is 'Morality'. The realms of it, the undefined criss cross intersecting patterns of it, the lawlessness and sometimes the hypocritical pride of it, and lastly
Corruption and greed had laid its wrath on an aristocratic family from a small east coast town, as a result the last standing member has nothing but his name to remind him constantly of things his family had lost, of things he would probably have been a heir to if not for the lecherous times.Ethan Allen Hawley finds himself being a clerk of a grocery store with disillusionment looming over every single minute of his life until on one insomniac night he strolls towards the port where his grandfather's ship used to anchor, and something sets itself in motion because he realized that things can't remain the way they are forever.When a man is discontent about something that is too important to him, he changes one fine day into a different man, looks at things differently, says new words.
Set in a New England town where everyone knows everyone else's business and history, Ethan Hawley narrates his experience with the various moral temptations one season offers him.
Under pressure from associates and his own family, Ethan becomes increasingly dissatisfied with his diminished station in life and begins to consider a brief transformation, a temporary suspension of his identity as a humble, upright citizen.
As a result of their corruption, plenty of characters, including a member of Ethan's own family, experience shameful downfalls, while others are able to escape judgment and seamlessly carry on, their lives apparently enhanced by their questionable activities.
I learned a lesson about why I should finish books, even if the story does not grip me and I find the protagonist boring.
(Thanks, book club) Initially, I thought...
oh man...
middle aged man making bitter jokes out of his miserable life.
However, as I realized what was happening as I got farther and farther into the book, I found myself wishing there was a sequel because I want to know what happened to Ethan a year or two down the road.
As always, Steinbeck's prose is real, fresh, and able to be read on several levels.
After this first read, I have a feel for the book and it's major social themes.
East of Eden was 600 some-odd pages and I didn't want it to end.
The story is about Ethan Hawley, a man of noble ancestry reduced to a grocery clerk, and his struggle to answer the questions, “What are morals?
Like the theme, the characters never come across as anything more than words on a page.
For example:-“Her hands were like living things as they shuffled and cut” (83).
Maybe “as different as dogs are from a string of random shit”?Since I find it more unbearable to not finish an unbearable book than I do to unbearably keep reading the unbearable book, I had to find some way to enjoy the experience.
before the winter of our discontent i was a vonnegut head, and i suppose i always will be in one way or another, but this is the book that brought on the onslaught of working class struggles and burgeoning life where there was little to find.
the story is a basic one of moral decay in america, especially interesting considering the present day.
a critical analysis of this book will bring flaws to light, but that is not why he wrote it, nor why i read it.
Η ματαιοδοξία του μικροαστισμου στην Αμερική λίγο πριν τα 60s κ ο σαρκασμός για το πόσο εφικτό μπορεί να είναι το μεγάλο όνειρο
Bontà passivaChe bel libro, che piacere il pensiero che sarebbe stato lì, appena avessi avuto il tempo di dedicarmi a lui.
"C'è tanta bontà passiva, nel non voler grane, confusione, fatica.""Non te la prenderesti di quel che pensa la gente di te, sapessi quanto poco ci pensano"Steinbeck è molto bravo a raccontare della borghesia, del vile denaro, è monumentale quando descrive la natura.
Ethan mi ha tenuto compagnia quando si confrontava con il passato della sua famiglia, quando si relazionava con i figli, quando usciva di notte perché incapace di dormire, quando maturava la bizzarra idea di dare una piega pericolosa alla propria esistenza.(Il miglior Steinbeck.
It is difficult to convey the feeling Steinbeck creates with his words, so I give you a few lines instead:It sounds uncomfortable and silly sitting cross-legged in a niche like a blinking Buddha, but someway the stone fits me or I fit.
Sometimes it is great fun to be silly, like children playing statues and dying of laughter.
I don't think she knows about the place.
His place where he sits and thinks.
His family had held prominence in past generations, but not anymore.
I know where I stand related to the moral, philosophical issues raised; I am not a kid anymore.
Continuaria a ser um cidadão honesto e despreocupado, não fossem o descontentamento e ambição da mulher, a insatisfação permanente dos filhos , a convivência com o banqueiro da cidade e empregado deste .
É com estas palavras que Ethan brinda ao recente sucesso do filho, que irá aparecer sob os holofotes da televisão.
Pai e filho, são o Ricardo III desta história, na medida em que a ambição irá deformalá-los e abrir uma violenta brecha na sua integridade.
Neste seu último livro, Steinbeck faz uma crítica à América que se deixa corromper pelo dinheiro e pela fama.
DNF--sorry! Maybe I'll give it another try sometime. Anyone else who wants to, go ahead, and I hope you enjoy it more.Best wishes.
It was mainly because Steinbeck put so many layers upon layers of depth and feeling into each of his superbly crafted sentences that I could have made baklava with them.I found this story extremely timely considering today's economy and the fall of the financial industry (Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, etc.).
But this is not about the economy or people down-on-their-luck like you had in The Grapes of Wrath.
This story was much more ordinary, every day, common.
And the people populating this story were oh-so-ordinary, every day, common.
He makes fictional characters so real you swear you know this story already because you know these people.Temptation.
You can read full review here. “You know how advice is – you only want it if it agrees with what you wanted to do anyways.” This book is beautiful, and that is some great writing right there. Steinbeck is what I would like to call a true literary genius. I haven’t read his other books and this is the first one, but already I’m his admirer. I think this is a finely crafted book.As I read this book, I came across many little but profound messages, throughout the book, and they were easy to deciphe
This novel came out in 1960s and before that he already got some of his best literary work published like “The Grapes of Wrath” and “East of Eden”, I haven’t read them but now after reading this book I’m surely gonna read them.
But I’m gonna say that this story is wonderfully told and well structured, but for some unknown reason it is quite often overlooked and I think people should read it.
Though, maybe that’s the point—that the circumstances of Ethan’s existence are so stacked against him that taking matters into his own hands is Steinbeck’s version of ‘but he had no choice’.I’m not going to write a lot here because it’s my first time reviewing in a while and my fingers hurt but I did just want to say that I thought this was a really beautiful novel, and I found myself (not surprisingly) drawn to these characters in a way that’s fairly typical of John Steinbeck novels.
Tenho a sensação que todas as personagens deste livro, exceto a principal, são más pessoas.
Todos criticam o Ethan por tentar ser sempre honesto e ter bons valores, até mesmo a família dele.
Até quando é que Ethan vai aguentar ouvir de toda a gente que ele é um pobre falhado?
Será que a opinião dos outros vai mudar a atitude dele?
📖Pensei que ia ser uma leitura muito mais dramática e emocional.
Gostei da crítica à falta de moral, à corrupção, ganância e desonestidade, mas no geral não me tocou.
Ao longo das 300 páginas que compõe este livro parece que não acontece quase nada.

ვახ, პატარა წიგნია,ვიფიქრე მალეც დავასრულებ მეთქი. მაგრამ არა, საკმაოდ გამიგრძელდა კითხვა. თუმცა არა იმიტომ,რომ არ მეცალა ან მეზარებოდა.უბრალოდ არ მინდოდა მორჩენილიყო. სიამოვნებაა ეს ადამიანი

Of Mice of Men or East of Eden, anyone?However, The Winter of Our Discontent was not as fluid as Of Mice and Men nor did it possess the sheer strength in characterization or plot as East of Eden.
The plot itself did not present anything mind-blowing - the underlying theme of morality made me think though.
But it goes inward and minces up with a lot of other things already there and what comes out is discontent and uneasiness, guilt and a compulsion to get something -anything - before it is all gone."Overall, I give this book a 3.5.*cross-posted from my blog, the quiet voice.
Always in the nick of time I pick up a Steinbeck novel and it is a relief to read carefully and beautifully constructed sentences again.
This story delivered all the things I love and need from Steinbeck.
That's why I keep retreating into Steinbeck novels and living vicariously through the sordid, insidious lives of complex characters who grapple with their intense moral dilemmas alongside the country that shaped their paths to the very problem in front of them.
I finished this story and did that thing where I held the hardcover gently and lovingly, for just a long moment, and then re-read the ending 2 more times.
I just loved this story.
Just love all Steinbecks writing.He seems to have deeply studied human nature andportrays it in his incredible stories with remarkablecharacters in a very philosophical way.Good stuff!
