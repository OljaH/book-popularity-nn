Honestly, this book fueled 90% of my  dragon-obsession  over middle school. (How obsessed you ask? Tshirts, posters, movies, figurines - if you could slap a dragon on it, I bought it (really not kidding)). This series will always hold a special place in my heart.    Eragon, having survived the great battle, is saddled with a completely unexpected consequence - the Shade's Curse.  He and Saphira are sent to the hidden lands of the elves, Ellesmera, to learn the secrets of the Dragon Riders.  But
Eragon, having survived the great battle, is saddled with a completely unexpected consequence - the Shade's Curse.
Eragon remains completely unaware as he trains in Ellesmera - leaving Rowan to find a way to save the entire town and track down Katrina (the love of his life) who was stolen by the Ra'zac.As much as I try to be objective about these novels - I can't.
They're so entwined with my past that I simply can't rate them anything below 5 stars.Dragons were my middle school "thing" - I drew them, I wrote about them and I read about them constantly.
Read The Hero's Journey, go watch Star Wars, study some Lord of the Rings and some obscure mythology, steal some words from ancient languages and pretend they're magic words, and read Story by Robert McKee and The Writer's Handbook, and then write a book ganking one or two aspects from all the other high fantasy you've read and liked.
Which of course means that he should do the same things in the same order as every hero of myth and fantasy from Odysseus to Luke Skywalker.A book should not be so based on a story "type" that it feels like it is following a template; every "revelation" in this book is more of a confirmation of a suspicion than an actual surprise.
I hate Eragon, but I was intrigued to see if Paolini has improved, so I borrowed this book and attempted to read it.I hate Eragon.
Eldest started off with a flat summary, then it went straight into a continuation from the previous story, and around 600 pages of exposition full of step-by-step miniscule details that have no bearing towards the plot at all, before finally going to a faux-climax again.
All I know is that if this is what people call good writing, I, like many others, fear for humanity.NOTE: If you're an Eragon fangirl huffing and puffing about my review being mean, save your energy.
If questions like these have haunted you ever since you delved into the world of fantasy, look no further for your answers!Eldest continues the saga started in Eragon by sending our plucky hero into the land of the Elves in order to complete his training as a Rider.
There, we learn absolutely everything you (n)ever wanted to know about the Elves (think of it as though the Lord of the Rings treated the different races not as allegories, but as Star Trek races, with their own anthropologies).
Alas, all the training is worthless in changing Eragon.
Slow for the first half but really picked up and actually got very very good! All the twists and turns introduced have boggled my mind... time to move onto book three...
‚ÄúThe world is stretched thin, Eragon. Soon it will snap and madness will burst forth. What you feel is what we dragons feel and what the elves feel‚Äîthe inexorable march of grim fate as the end of our age approaches. Weep for those who will die in the chaos that shall consume Alaga√´sia. And hope that we may win a brighter future by the strength of your sword and shield and my fangs and talons.‚Äù  Well that was some ride! Amazing! First off thanks to my BR partners, Her Purpleness and Her Pinkynes
Eragon will always be a brother, Saphira the greatest friend, Arya my love, Murtagh will be the embodiment of all my betrayals and Galbatorix will be the ultimate foe!Given that I am super biased towards this series, I‚Äôll keep this review short and as impartial as possible.
Eragon and Saphira must travel to the land of the Elves, Ellesmera, for there is much they need to know and understand but not enough time.
Arya, who is still much of a mystery, her character is very nicely done, I love her strength and resolve.But the highlight has to be Eragon and Saphira!
And even if some may get upset, the old YA is much much much better than this new stuff, that seems to believe the only way to make a story good is through lovey-dovey stuff...Eldest doesn't have a lot of romance and it does not need it.
The story is excellent!
That is a lot to be accomplished in one book and it is also the reason why Eldest is my favorite entry in the series.I so wish a movie studios would decide to adapt this series, but with care this time.
Step 8: Turn phone off and or yank from wall and place a note on your door saying that your are ill and very contagious not to disturb unless world is coming to and end ...and even then you might want to consider waiting another day.
Step 10: find the most comfortable place where all of the essentials can be within arms reach and bring a blanket incase you get cold, matter of fact turn the air on and get the blanket cause you don't want to be to hot...this book is intense.
Review to be continued aout 24 hours after the release of 3rd book.
Wonderful BR with my Heartsister Pinky and my favorite gentleman Sir Grumpy! What an excellent ride with Saphy üíúüíúüíúüíúüíúüíú
4.5 stars!Truly, I have nothing bad to say about this book.
I enjoyed the training portions, the shocking revelations, the magic system, seeing young love through a male protagonist's POV, and the fact that injury and disability in heroes during wartime was something that was represented.
And DRAGONS.
The dragon/rider relationship is my favorite part of this series.Even though I enjoyed everything about this book, there's something holding me back from 5 stars.
I still can't say this is a favorite series, but after being unimpressed with book 1, I was delighted to enjoy this one so much and am eager to continue the series!
Eldest begins following several important events in Eragon.
The story is the continued adventures of Eragon and his dragon Saphira, centering on their journey to the realm of the Elves in order to further Eragon's training as a Dragon Rider.
Other plots in the story focus on Roran, Eragon's cousin, who leads the inhabitants of Carvahall to Surda to join the Varden, and Nasuada as she takes on her father's role as leader of the Varden.
Eldest ends at the Battle of the Burning Plains, where Eragon faces a new Dragon Rider, Murtagh, and a new dragon, Thorn.
-- the whiny brat is MAGICALLY transformed into a perfect and incredibly handsome specimen of Rider, whisking away not only his scars and physical infirmities, but also any sympathy the reader may have felt for him.The big twist ending of the book is hardly a surprise (honestly, I pegged Murtagh's true identity within a few pages of his character's introduction in Eragon -- was there anyone who DIDN'T see this coming?).
By the end of the final battle, I was rooting for a real twist: That someone would put Eragon out of his misery and elevate some other, more interesting character to the title role.After reading Eldest, I don't know if I'll bother with the third book in the series.
I was very pleasantly surprised - Eldest laughs in the face of the so-called sophomore-slump curse.While I liked Eragon enough to give it five stars despite the weird feeling that it was a mediation between Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter, it was kind of slim in several places, character- and plot-wise.
Finally, some real meat to the relationships between characters, the government of Alagaesia, and the drive toward battle.
Finally getting to see Ellesmera, the land of the elves, I sympathized with Eragon as he found his niche there and then felt torn when it came time for him to leave.I can't wait for book 3.
I find it hard to be surprised by most book endings, and this one had a twist that I was not looking for, so when it jumped out at me, I was almost knocked out of my chair with shock.
I was surprised, but happy to find that this was not a quaint little fight, and that this world was real, one where the bad guys don't play fair, and they go after the people Eragon most wants to protect in order to get to him.
It makes for a great sequel and leaves you straining on your tip-toes for the next book in the series.
There is only now.‚ÄùEldest was overall better than Eragon.
Especially because most of this book took place in Du Weldenvarden, the place where the Elves live and where Eragon receives his training.
Honestly, who cares about Eragon 2.0 minus dragon and superpowers?
Not me.Reading this roughly a decade (bloody hell, I'm old) after I first picked up these books, shows me how far I've come and how much I've learnt when it comes to my views on literature.
Everything in this book has a touch of melodrama, hence plot and characters lose their authenticity.Anyway, I'm looking forward to reading Brisingr.
Eldest, the second book in the inheritance trilogy by Christopher Paolini is disappointing largely because it's a long book in which very little happens.
The narrative through most of the book switches back and forth between Eragon and Roran.
The problem is that the only interesting plot developments in Eragon's story happen at the very beginning and the very end.
Particularly memorable is the character Elva to whom Eragon offers a blessing intended to make her shielded from misfortune.
While we expect Eragon to kill Galbatorix in the end, it's unclear to me how the storyline with Elva will wrap up.
How it shows promise, is an interesting take, blah blah?
All of the promise and interest in the first story disappeared into a foul-smelling vapor within the first 2 chapters.
The author has obviously forgotten the character parameters he set for his own characters, namely Eragon.
This story takes place at most 6-9 months after the end of the first book, in which Eragon was a very young teenager.
Not to mention the copious pages of made-up language was beyond tiresome.
You can create a language just like your hero, Tolkein!
We already know how it will end.
Eragon was a great book.
There was suspense, action, and a possible romance.But this book just completely screwed everything up with the boring dialogue and the action less pages.Yes, this is a very unpopular opinion, so no hate, ok??
Unfortunately, what exactly was this book about??1.Eragon was a hopeless, romantic ditz that kept running after Arya.
Was it just me or did this book feel like a waste of time and energy??!
Besides spending his time thinking about Arya's face, what more is there??!Hmmm, go figure!But would I reread this though??Yes, because there were good parts in this book that are worth talking over.

Paolini ditched almost all of Eragon's potential, spending his time in the land of elves who are smarter, more gorgeous, wiser, stronger, faster, longer-lived, better at magic, more hygenic, more tasteful, better at art, music, metalworking, and just generally better in every way than those poor, lowly humans.
. .every man jack and woman girl of them is an atheist vegetarian!
Yes, Paolini takes some clumsy but pervasive swipes against religion, demonstrating that he really doesn't know what the heck he's talking about.The fight scenes were all pretty bad too--most of them completely implausible.
They're bird assassins from before the dawn of man, and he's a peasant with a hammer!I _did_ really like Nar Gazvog.
And the dwarves were still pretty cool.
(Most of) the negative critics out there are true, but this doesn't make the story any less enjoyable.

When Islanzadi is confronted about keeping Gleadr's existence a secret, she states, "I am diminished." It sounds almost exactly like the scene from LOTR when Galadriel says, "I will diminish, and go into the West..."

‚ÄúEldest Book Review‚Äù The book Eldest by Christopher Paolini is a book about a dragon and his rider. The two, intertwined by the magic of thought, journey through the land to Ellemera to study the arts of magic as he prepares to face off against the belligerent tyrant Galbatorix. The book had many interesting twists and turns. Eragon, the rider, has always thought to be the last rider, excluding the king and his evil riders, know as the foresworn. But suddenly, Ormoris, an Elvin rider appears to
The book had many interesting twists and turns.
Eragon, the rider, has always thought to be the last rider, excluding the king and his evil riders, know as the foresworn.
Also, as the story proceeds, Eragon begins to fall in love with Arya, but she discovers his feelings for her in the most interesting of ways.
It took Eragon 300 pages to travel to Ellemera and learn magic, and 300 for his cousin, Roran, to escape the Ra‚Äôzaac and flee to Surda.
Anyone who enjoys fiction or scientific fiction, or stories from the past would enjoy this book greatly.
In the hands of a good author, this could be done decently, so that the characters pay homage to Star Wars and Lord of the Rings without being half-@ssed rip offs, but Paolini is far from a good author.Worse than the characters, which I could at least stand in Eragon (I‚Äôll admit, Brom was my favorite and it was shame when he died), the story is hideously, mind-numbingly boring.
If you want to read horrible characters, unending descriptions, bad romance, and a thin as plastic wrap plot stretched over 71 chapters that reads like Star Wars with characters and settings from Lord of the Rings, read Eldest.
I was half expecting Eldest to be an improvement for Paolini, but what I expect never seems to be what I get.
Eldest was lengthy; too lengthy.
It seems as if Paolini is still aiming his novels towards the pre-teen to teen audience, something that paid off for him after making Eragon.
This was no doubt the worst part of the book, for not a trace of excitement surfaces for over a bulging 150 pages.These two pitfalls together create a novel twice as difficult to read, and twice as easy to give one star.
Took me a while to notice that I haven't added this book yet. And overall it wasn't that bad. There were some major twists in it, especially towards the end. And I did love when Eragon was with the elves, though some chapters were too long and boring. Also, I didn't really like the chapters with Eragon's cousin. He's not my favourite character of the books and he kind of irritates me, especially when he blamed Eragon for everything. So, I didn't like his chapters. Plus, there weren't many battles in this one, but, all in all, it was enjoyable.
I really enjoyed Roran rising up to become his own man and learn all the lessons of being a dragon rider along with Eragon. The level of detail in this story is astounding and it takes a very special kind of writer to not only come up with a story like this but to be able to keep all the different plots moving along smoothly without leaving loose threads that savvy readers could unravel. Bravo!
I thought the first half is a bit boring but then second half is a lot better than first half.I agree with one review in this book "Will appeal to legions of readers who have been captivated by the Lord of the Rings trilogy." School Library Journal.Roran is one of my favourite characters.
I try not to read sequels as they come out. With the exception of every Harry Potter book (yes, I attended three of the midnight release parties) and  Breaking Dawn  (which I bought two weeks after it was released), I wait until an entire trilogy, quartet or series are released in paperback before starting the first one. Like the Faerie Wars or the Derkholm books. I mean, I‚Äôm a Tamora Pierce junkie, but I'm still waiting to start the Terrier series.(Note on paperback v. hardback ‚Äì it‚Äôs a prefere
I‚Äôve read Eragon, but not The Golden Compass.Yeah, I bought Eldest.It went against my nature to do so, despite the fact that I bought it in paperback.
But I figured that since the final book, Brisingr, was due within a few weeks (it was released today, September 20), I‚Äôd go ahead and read Eldest, even if it meant I bought Brisingr as a hardback.And then DAMMIT if I didn‚Äôt find out too late that Brisingr is NOT the last book in the series ‚Äì that there‚Äôs a fourth and final installment.
I‚Äôd read Eragon because I was keenly jealous of child-prodigy self-publisher Christopher Paolini.
