At the height of my Marguerite Henry phase, this was one of my favorites. I was fascinated by the way they trained trotters, and the different equipment they used. Read this about the same time as I discovered the Black Stallion book (Black Stallion's Flame? Bonfire?) where one of his colts becomes a trotter and Alec and Henry try to train him.
I loved this story!
It's the true tale of Gibson White, Ben White, and Rosalind the horse, along with a bonus story (story within a story, chapter by chapter as Gib reads it) of Hambletonian, the great horse who was Rosalind's ancestor.
It's been a long time since I read a Marguerite Henry book, but when I found this classic edition in mint condition at the used bookstore, I had to have it.
Now that's a bargain, especially when the story keeps me up at night before a work morning!Here's the link to the Hambletonian Society page, but it does have spoilers!http://www.hambletonian.org/archives_...
To start: this is the (true!) story of young Gibson White, desperate to prove himself in his dad’s business of horse training, who finds himself forced to give up his dreams for a year, just as he’s about to achieve them:The questions rained on.
How could I not love this book?Dr. Mills sends Gib a book to read, while he’s in the hospital resting up.
It’s the story of one of the most famous American trotters, a horse named Hambletonian, and the immigrant who trained him.
Being trained to race, ultimately, in the race named after that famous horse: the Hambletonian.
This is right after Dr. Mills tells Gibson he’s well enough to race his horse himself.
Gibson White wants to drive horses.
He wants to race.
And even though a rein breaks in his first real race, Gib proves himself.
That the only cure is a long serious rest up in the mountains.But without horses, will Gib ever have the strength to heal?Born to Trot by Marguerite Henry is actually two stories.
First the tale of Gibson White, owner of the world-champion trotting horse Rosalind.
Then within that story is the tale of the even more legendary horse, Hambletonian.
I liked the realistic aspects of both stories.
And, of course, Gib’s passion for horses.
A donation to the Friends of the Library bookstore, I nabbed it first. Classic Marguerite Henry -- lots of interesting horse lore and great horse illustrations, with a fairly weak story tying it all together. I would have liked to spend more of the book at the harness races, and less at a sanitarium with our young hero Gibson White, who is ailing with some mysterious illness that we never get to hear about (maybe TB?). A true story with an exciting ending.
The story of the horse isn't what caught my attention; I was intrigued by the boy, Gibson. His illness and the way it was treated (total bed rest for ages) is so very different from how we manage most sickness in this day and age.
Marguerite Henry does a great job of weaving facts about horses and horse racing into a tale kids enjoy. I owe everything I know about harness racing to this book.
loved it
Good story..more like two stories in one..
These were some of my favorite books when I was a kid...
One of my boyhood delights. I read it repeatedly. :)
Very good. at the beginning of him ready the book I was board with it but as I read on it got better. If you like horses then you should definitely recommend reading this book.
Growing up, I loved horse stories, and the best writer/illustrator pair was Marguerite Henry and Wesley Dennis.
The main story is about Gibson White, a teenage boy whose father trains and races trotters.
Gibson's doctor also gives him a book, about the man who bred the father of all trotters, a stallion named Hambletonian.
This edition has a few lovely color illustrations, as well as a color front and back illustration.As is usual for books of this era, the only female of note is Gibson's mother, who is pretty much relegated to making food for Gibson and his father.
Gibson's father, one of the best Standardbred trainers ever, gave the newborn filly to Gibson when Gibson was hospitalized for what I guess now would be called anorexia.
Another thing was that Gibson had very little to no contact with the horse he loved.
I guess all of us horseless horse-lovers can identify with that, which might be one reason why this book is so beloved.Wesley Dennis does an excellent job here and does his best work on people (in my opinion.) Usually his people all look alike.
I read this book because my 8 year old daughter insisted.
It is a child's book and it reads like one, but it tells an interesting story nonetheless, actually two interesting stories that link together.
The story within a story is about William Rysdyk and his horse Hambletonian.
All of these characters and horses are real and that makes the story something that I was willing to read with interest, despite exclamations like "Jeepers, creepers!" What I wasn't pleased to find out is that my daughter only skimmed the story within a story as that part didn't interest her.
Gib White is the son of Ben White, driver of trotting Standardbreds, and so not surprisingly Gib has grown up around harness racetracks, dreaming only of following in his father's footsteps.
In an attempt to revive Gib's interest in life, flagging badly now that he is separated from his beloved harness racing world, Ben White deeds a new foal to his son: Rosalind, out of Alma Lee by Lee Worthy, about as purple a bloodline of royalty as any horse might hope for.Rosalind lives up to her heritage, aided somewhat by Ben's training skill, and Gib does indeed pick up with the incentive of racing his own horse upon his release from the hospital.
I really love this book, mostly as a nostalgia piece.
It's aimed mostly at children (I'd guess 8-9+) as its audience, but I like the story enough that I reread it occasionally now that I'm an adult.
Great for horse lovers, solidly good child-young adult book.
Also the uplifting realization follows not the modern version of "oh, the young will triumph and get his way", but rather a quieter realization that's actually more realistic for the scenario.
The book inside of the book is quite well done, and I liked learning some of the history of "the trotting world" through the story of the Hambletonian.
This book is a story-within-a-story, and the framing story only allows us to meet Rosalind, the supposed main equine character, secondhand until very near to the end, and then it's...disappointing.
(hide spoiler)]The framing story's faults aside, the inner story, the story of Hambletonian, was very entertaining even if most of it probably wasn't true.
I enjoyed it thoroughly, and was actually impatient with the framing story at times because I wanted to read the main story itself, and not be interrupted.All in all, a good book, if not the best Henry ever wrote.
Born to Trot is the story of one great horse in the history of harness racing, and her truly special owner and trainer.
Father and son team Ben and Gibson White, trainer and owner of speedster Rosalind respectively, work tirelessly to give this horse her best chance at greatness.
They do it in the face of great adversity, namely Gibson's nameless disease that has him hospitalized for years (according to my research, it was TB).
In the vein of Arabian Nights, there is a story within a story - Gibson whiles away his time learning about the foundation of harness racing in the story of Rysdyk's Hambletonian.
This is the story of a famous and successful harness racer, Rosalind, and her owner, Gibson White.
I read this book so many times as a kid that the pages on my hardback copy started to go soft!
This story is based on truth, but is very fun.
Forced to spend a long time in the hospital, and longer in a nursing home type of recuperation, Gibson follows the budding racing career of his filly from afar.
The book has a very unique feel, the kind of genteel Southern flavor that racing used to have permeates this book, bringing you back in time to another day entirely.
Re-reading this young adult classic was a ploy to get my 9-year-old daughter to pick up another Marguerite Henry book and fall in love with horses.
She chose the next volume in the C.S. Lewis series for her book report.
Nevertheless, I enjoyed following Gibson White through his discovery that it is certainly possible to overwork one's self and one's horse -- a moral I could probably stand to abide by myself.
I also liked letting my mind be carried back to a simpler time, when horse racing was more popular than football, and when parents wrote letters to their children with news.
Refreshing approach to story telling that is done by letters written as well as the usual narrative. I especially liked the good relationship the main character had with his birth family. Lots of information on trotter training and racing. New vocabulary for me (sudsing, scudding, spume, ruck).When McSeely rejoined the group, the men sheared their words like women trimming off the extra crust from a pie.Wherever his father sat he suddenly belonged. On a hilltop, on a fence rail, in a stable, in a hospital -- he was like his old pork-pie hat, at home anywhere.
Kind of a coming of age story, Henry tells us of a boy named Gib, & the harness horses that are his life's passion. When he is old enough, & a beautiful & talented filly named Rosalind comes along, they make magic together, & Gib's dreams of winning the greatest harness race in the world, the Hambletonian, are within his sights. Can they win it together? You have to read to find out.
This is a story about the bond that a man has with his really good horse. They are great friends and endure some really tough times. At first, I was skeptical, but really ended up liking this book! I want to read it again, for sure, to catch anything I may have missed!
Marguerite Henry does in 1945 what Laura Hillenbrand does today with the book Seabiscuit. Telling the story of a real horse hero story with the endearing quality so prevalent during that era. Perfect for all young horse lovers and old.
I enjoyed the characters, and their world and hope I get the chance to read the story again and/or to read more within the series.My Rating System:* couldn't finish, ** wouldn't recommend, *** would recommend, **** would read again, ***** have read again.
I've always liked Henry's non-Misty books better (this and Mustang: Wild Spirit of the West are my favorites). Although all of her work was fictionalized, I think some of these less popular ones suffered less from over-sentimentalization of their equine characters.
It's about a boy who wants to ride in a race, and he does.
As a kid in the 1960s I looked forward to getting new horse books by Maruerite Henry for birthday or other special occasions. I was a horse fanatic.
this favorite childhood book was the one to encourage me to read my first Shakespeare play.
