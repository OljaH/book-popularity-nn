This book goes through Genesis chapter by chapter and presents the pertinent points of typology or spiritual experience contained therein.
For instance in chapter 13, Pink presents twelve points on the typology of Noah’s Ark in six short pages.
Even if you disagree with some of the details of his exposition, most people teaching through Genesis or interested in really studying this book, will seriously benefit from Pink’s study, if for nothing more than a foundation to build upon or a field to do their own gleanings from.
There is a lot of real good stuff in this book. Pay special attention to the last few chapters where Pink draws the similiarities between Joseph and Christ. A lot of preaching material in this book.
Unfortunately the person who borrowed this book never returned it.
Very good!This is a great book for learning the deeper meanings and significance of the book of Genesis. I highly recommend it!
