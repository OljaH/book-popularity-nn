Choprah should add some caveats, as he almost never does, since clearly below a certain basic standard of living, a lack of material things can be a source of misery.
Correlation is by definition bounded between zero and one, so what in the world does "infinite correlation" mean?"When your actions are motivated by love, your energy multiplies and accumulates--and the surplus energy you gather and enjoy can be channeled to create anything that you want, including unlimited wealth."No, it can't.
It's so obviously false that it's hard to understand how a thinking person could believe this.Choprah draws on some grand old Eastern and Western traditions, including Zen Buddhism, Toaism and Christianity for his ideas.
Why not just say that it's important to spend part of every day in stillness in order to connect with our inner selves and break free of the material world/rat race, rather than going on and on about our mystical connections to the universe?It seemed to be very much pandering to Westerners who want to feel "spiritual" while they also reject Western religion.
He says that if decisions are right, they'll make us feel good.
What about gut-wrenching, heart-breaking decisions having to do with things like end-of-life decisions?I initially gave this two stars because I don't disagree with the laws themselves.
The Seven Spiritual Laws of Success is a labelled as one hour of wisdom, a pocketbook guide to fulfilling your dreams.
It is written by world-renowned author, Deepak Chopra.
This little book may be small but it is filled with a lot of good common sense wisdom.
For those who have read other works by the author or who have begun their own spiritual journey, the concepts set out in this book are not ground-breaking.
Nonetheless, The Seven Spiritual Laws of Success is a handy little reference.
It's somewhat more complex and requires time to unravel and let the concepts sink in.
It's definitely readable, I have just had to read one chapter at a time and let the "laws" sink in one at a time before exploring the next.
It shifts the thinking about the universe and our place in it.
Rather than approach us as "stardust" or inconsequential, it challenges the individual to see that we are the center of OUR universe and we have to deliberately create what surrounds us and what is inside of us...it's a chicken/egg kind of thing that takes some philosophical thought to digest.
But I needed an audio book for the commute and wasn't sure what to go with so I opted for something short.
This was 90 minutes, read by the author and irresistibly "enlightening".
So much so that I stayed with it and heard it over and over several times.
The really great thing about this book is that it is short so you can read it quickly or take your time to really process the concepts.
Purpose (Dharma)Maybe what is so appealing about this "spiritual" genre is that it usually presents universal concepts in simple terms.

This ios my favorite gift book. It is simple straight forward advice of how to grow spiritually- advise we all can use daily
I often thought that the life lived in solitude is the best energy a fate can give, but I was very wrong.
Even our beloved Aristotle, Plato and Socrates conquered such a thought.Without reading into these men, I knew this before hand, and now, this read made me feel spectacular.It helped me to realize that I have a whole energy of a lifetime awaiting me!
Loving me tenderly and invisibly.More than the World, it taught me that uncertainty is awesome.
It's a beautiful read!
I gave my father to read, only to have him leave it on the table.
This book changed my life.
It found me at the perfect time and I've been reading it almost daily since then.
It shifted me from viewing uncertainty as something unsettling to a gift - the law of potentiality.
"Everything is as it should be" has become my mantra.
Even after loosing my home and most of my possessions to a flood, I had faith that it was a blessing in disguise.
Each of the laws has lifted me to a better place, and more peaceful perspective.
When I read the book, I could feel fear melt away, and it hasn't returned.
This is a book I have no intention of finishing.
When all of my belonging had arrived back to California, including this little abandoned table that I had turned into a meditation table, inside the drawer, which previously had not contained anything save some mala beads and a couple pamphlets on Diamond Way Buddhism, was this book: The Seven Spiritual Laws of Success.The dustcover was gone, and someone had scrawled on the inside to a friend that, "This book changed my life."I queried my friend in Washington who had helped me move and he denied putting the book in the drawer.
من این کتاب رو حدوداً ۹ سال پیش خوندم و چیزهای جالبی به من آموخت: مثلاً دربارهی دارما و کارما و اینکه بچه رو نباید مجبور کنیم درس بخونه و ممتاز باشه. در کل چون فرهنگ ایران و هندوستان شباهتهای زیادی داره، خوندنش برام لذتبخش بود.

Terrific book!
An amazing friend of mine bought the pocket book version for me and I've referred to it every day.
You can literally breeze through it in under one hour flat, and at the end of each "law", Deepak sums up everything he talked about, which makes skimming super easy and quick.
Every time I look back and remind myself on what to practice everyday, I gain a great sense of calmness and relaxation knowing that these laws are easy to follow and extremely beneficial in yours and other people's daily lives.
Deepak knows what's up!

Books such as "The Seven Spiritual Laws of Success: A Practical Guide to the Fulfillment of Your Dreams, by Deepak Chopra, are rarely reviewed by me because I am busy studying and practicing the information.
I am in the process of practicing a few steps mentioned: write your intentions and read them every morning and night.
I slip, but continuing to practice I am conscious when doing so and get back to my intentions.
I plan to continue to study this book and in fact bought five and shared with the intention of a study group.
A friend of my parents suggested I read this book while I was home for Christmas after she heard about my work situation.
She suggested that I pick up the book immediately because I was in the "right frame of mind." This book reminds us of the importance of meditation, of being a good person and karma but it certainly was not what I was looking to read in order to address my work situation and to get through each day.
Had I reminded myself of how important other things are as compared to work, this book may have had a more profound impact.
Probably a book I will pick up again in a few years when I have, or least hope to have, a different perspective.
What really helped me about this book was Deepak's "universal meditation" thing at the end where he asks everyone to focus on a specific spiritual law on a specific day. So for about a year, I did this. Sunday, being conscious of the Law of Pure Potentiality, for instance. This practice helped me to be more centered and aware of synchronicities. I also really appreciated life alot when I was in this practice. I don't know why I'm no longer doing this... Other than that, this book is pretty slim and fluffy, like pastry.
Chopra is a little overly flowy in his language, but he had some good points that made sense. It's difficult from a western point of view to really appreciate an eastern point of view, but i'm trying to adjust my mindset. Some of his laws seem above my head, but I've already applied one or two to my life and they've worked beautifully. He has some helpful, practical ways at the end of each chapter to make them work in your life. Thought-provoking stuff.
This is the one book I revisit time and time again. I downloaded it from itunes and listen to it on my commute. I would recommend the audio version. Deepak's voice is very soothing, there's not too much heavy content, and the audio makes it easy to jump back/forwards to concentrate on certain spiritual laws.
This is one of Chopra's best books. It inspired from me one of the best poems I've ever written. I am forever grateful...
this is super cool book. simple laws but in depth meaning.I love "Law of Dharma" :)
http://booksmakelife.blogspot.in/2011...Book Review: Seven Spiritual Laws of Success by Deepak Chopra: Eastern Sprituality+Western Style = Deepak ChopraA practical guide without any practicals!!!“A practical guide to the fulfillment of your dreams” – this is what the cover page says.
But as far as my learning goes, the people who know how to convert their dreams are not meant for such books (actually it is vice versa!).
He says most of the things in Life and Nature happen themselves without any or least efforts.
It's an inspiring guide to creating a fulfilling life. Compared to The Secret, the hype of the moment, it's much more practical and focused on your part in the whole, rather than just receiving cars and mansions and millions. It is simple, inspiring, and humble. One law that is the most difficult and yet most important is the Law of Detachment: you must INTEND to create your goals, but you must let them go and happen when the time is right. Anyway, for anyone interested in this stuff (I am), it's a must-read.
Read the book at a crucial time in my professional life.Finished the book in a day over three sittings.Planning to read it again several more times as this is not a book that we read and forget.To derive full benefit of all the seven laws described in the book we need to practice observing them on every day of the week in such a way that we start with the first law on sunday and finish with the seventh law on the saturday.
This book and those like it are, as you might already suspect, a dime a dozen. Here's an example of one of its spiritual axioms: "To be happy, consider if a particular action will hurt you. If so, do not do it". Good thing I got it for a dollar at a used book sale. No more of Deepak's drivel for this grasshopper.
Reading this book on the cusp of a brand new year has me inspired, hopeful, and eager for twenty-twelve. By introducing the essence of each spiritual law and simple steps for living the laws, Chopra presents a most compelling manifesto to creating a life full of happiness, joy, and abundance...everything I intend to enjoy in the new year.
I received one of Deepak's book as a gift from my manager back in 2007 and since then, I have been following his work as much as I possibly can. The seven spiritual laws of success is a great book, The lessons learnt are so dear. If you ever struggled in understanding Galatians 5:22, this is the additional book that will drive the lessons home
A profoundly life-changing book. Deepak Chopra simplifies these seven spiritual laws and gives guidelines on how to easily implement them into your daily life. Definitely worth multiple reads.
Material abundance, in all its expressions, happens to be one of those thing that makes the journey more enjoyable.
When we begin to experience our life as the miraculous expression of divinity-not occasionally, but all the time-then we will know the true meaning of success.
When these needs are matched with the creative expression of your talent, that is the spark that creates affluence.
Expressing your talents to fulfill needs creates unlimited wealth and abundance." -pg.96"The Law of Detachment says that in order to acquire anything in the physical universe, you have to relinquish your attachment to it.
