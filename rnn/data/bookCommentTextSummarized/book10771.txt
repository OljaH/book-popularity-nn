”Flip religion, it was so far out, you couldn’t blame anybody for believing anything…Guys stuck the ace of spades in their helmet bands, they picked relics off of an enemy they’d killed, a little transfer of power; they carried around five-pound Bibles from home, crosses, St. Christophers, mezuzahs, locks of hair, girlfriends’ underwear, snaps of their families, their wives, their dogs, their cows, their cars, pictures of John Kennedy, Lyndon Johnson, Martin Luther King, Huey Newton, the Pope, Che Guevara, the Beatles, Jimi Hendrix, wiggier than cargo cultists.
Sean Flynn and Dana StoneThe point I’m trying to make is that war correspondents were at as much risk as the combat soldiers they were there to write about.
UN CARTONE ANIMATO NOIR: "TOPOLIN, TOPOLIN, VIVA TOPOLIN"”Full Metal Jacket” di Stanley Kubrick: la scena finale , la cosiddetta marcia di Topolino.Questo libro contiene tutti i film sul Vietnam che ho visto e che sono stati mai realizzati.Eppure è stato scritto prima di qualsiasi film sul Vietnam.Il fatto è che chiunque abbia voluto fare un film sull’argomento ha letto ‘Dispacci’ con attenzione, è partito da queste pagine.A cominciare da Coppola, che per “Apocalypse Now” lo volle cosceneggiatore (la voce off di Willard-Sheen è un parto di Herr), proseguendo con Kubrick, che lo coinvolse nella sceneggiatura di “Full Metal Jacket” (in un film senza protagonisti, il personaggio del protagonista Matthew Modine è modellato proprio su Herr).Per la verità, contiene tutto il cinema di guerra mai prodotto: Continuo a pensare a tutti i ragazzi che sono stati rovinati da 17 anni di film di guerra prima di venire in Vietnam a farsi rovinare per sempre… Tutti avevamo visto troppi film, avevamo abitato troppo a lungo nell’Impero della Tivù… Le prime volte che mi spararono addosso o che vidi dei morti in combattimento, non mi successe niente in realtà, ogni reazione restò sepolta nella mia testa.
Having been in VietNam and having been in some of the Marine Units that Michael Herr writes about in "Dispatches" is the best depiction of war in general and VietNam in particular that I have ever read. It started me on the path to healing that I had kept hidden since I came back from Nam. Thank You Michael.
It could do everything but stop.” No one who had power understood that the technological machine was impotent to achieve anything other than coercion and its logical extreme, death: “They killed a lot of Communists, but that was all they did, because the number of Communist dead meant nothing, changed nothing.”The opposite of war is not peace but justice, the access to judgments of equity that mitigate coercion.
The unfairness of war affects everyone even those, especially those, exercising the power.
The effects of war are genetic; they are passed on as a dismal legacy of power and its unfairness.
Herr mingled freely with the soldiers, journeying with them, talking with them, observing them; he left Vietnam and returned to his home in New York in 1969, and spent the next 18 months working on Dispatches, his memoir from the war.
Herr eventually recovered and finished the book, which was published in 1977 - two years after the fall of Saigon, long after the United States army and personel withdrew from the country.The average age of American soldiers fighting in Vietnam was 22.
This is war reportage as heartbreaking poetry. One of the roughest pieces of writing I have ever encountered. Beautiful, angular and harsh stylistically. There is a wonderfully (and terrifyingly) immersive quality to this book.
I could say this is one of the best memoirs I've read.
I could also say it is one of the most brilliant books on war I've ever read.
It would probably be easier, however, for me to just acknowledge I haven't read many books that have the power, the poetry, the intensity, the vividness, the bathos and the pathos that Herr pushes through every single page of this amazing book.
This is a book that haunts you hard while you read it and resonates both the horror of war and the surreal qualities of war and the men who fight it.
Not only is this the most engrossing piece of journalism, the most touching memoir, and the most illuminating book on war I've ever read; it's also written as if Herr was on fire and being chased by literature-eating wolves. I read it twice in a row and would do it again.
Imagine my surprise when I found it was the basis for not only Full Metal Jacket but also, to some degree, Apocalypse Now. It's more or less what you'd expect: a war correspondent travels all around Vietnam for what seems to be several years (I'm not sure how long Herr was actually there), talking to the foot soldiers and the officers and anybody else who's willing.
But Herr has made me think of it in terms of broader trends in American culture (I'm sure these answers are obvious to some, but I really don't know much of anything about the Vietnam War, or American history, for that matter): mainly alienation of battle, and iconoclasm.Alienation of battle makes sense.
By contrast, Huế and Da Nang, seats of the vanished Nguyễn and Champa kingdoms, are like “remote closed societies, mute and intractable.” In Huế after the battle that demolished so much of the city, bouncing over debris in a jeep with a South Vietnamese major and his driver, Herr gets curious about the old Imperial Palace:I’d been talking to Sergeant Dang about the Palace and about the line of emperors.
If the idea of reading an entire memoir about the Vietnam War doesn't appeal to you, maybe just try "Breathing In." I guarantee you've never read anything like it.After you've read "Breathing In," take a little break and come back to the book later.
We owe a debt to these reporters: Much of what we now know was true about the Vietnam War is due to their persistence and bravery.
Herr discovers that the desire for transcendence that music may have seemed like an answer to, that desire that he felt as a writer and human being, was also capable of being answered by Vietnam, and that pushed far enough it was the same answer.
And I've immersed myself in bios of Pearl Buck, Anna Leonowns (the real-life Anna of The King and I), Anna May Wong, Pierre Boulle, Somerset Maugham, along with books about classic films set in Asian locales: Fu Manchu, Charlie Chan, Lost Horizon, Apocalypse Now -- many of which I've reviewed here.
He had many problems, had cut himself from nearly everyone, but I can't help seeing a correlation.Michael Herr's book gave me a glimpse of what Alan lived through, during his time in Vietnam.

He achieves this level of painfully sharp observation many times throughout the book by switching between his time spent with the grunts in the DMZ and elsewhere and his time spent with the Mission administration and their agents in Saigon.The impact of this book is stronger for the fact that it is all straight reporting, and in my view overtakes fiction on the war such as “The Things They Carried” because it is pure fact and because it is able to contrast the statements and positions of military officers and government agents against the perspectives of the foot soldiers.
the writing is glib, self-important and embarrassing in that desperate-to-be-cool kind of way, which gets in the way of what is ostensibly the *actual* subject - the vietnam war. instead, it seems that the vietnam war was merely a canvas for the real subject of the book, his own writing, which is unfortunately completely insufferable."Dexedrine breath like dead snakes kept too long in a jar." gtfo. worst.
Fucking amazing. Supposedly the most famous journalistic account of the war in Vietnam... I wouldn't disagree. Nonfiction, but to me on par with any of O'Brien's work from a storytelling perspective, which is saying a lot. Outpaced the highest of expectations.
. ."), while the evidence everywhere was of an irrationality raised to such a pitch that it had become something driven only by itself.Unable to remain objective or even conceive of objectivity, Herr and his colleagues yield to a kind of hallucinatory experience, depicting the war as a phantasmagoria, a really bad trip that also seduced them with what one of them insists is a compelling glamour.
To read this book is to experience Vietnam not as a historical record or analysis, or even a personal memoir, but as a kind of hypnotic nightmare from which many, including survivors, never wake.
Powerful book...esp the first half...not just the content, which is raw, but the language and punctuation even that captures brilliantly the maniacal be-bop riot of this heart of darkness ride into the horrid past.... Easy Rider (as, in fact, Sean Flynn quite literally was) comes to Saigon, Khe Sanh, Hue....
Herr is an Emersonsian transparent eyeball in this book, recording his impressions and imaginative reactions to the chaos and strange beauty surrounding him everywhere.Some very interesting characters: Sean Flynn, son of Errol, who does war photography because he wants to truly see the world.
It is, if you check out George Packer's magisterial "The Assassin's Gate" but Herr is right in the middle of the shit...freaked-out, doped-up, awed and disgusted and exhilerated by what he's seen.If you like your journalism (and for that matter, your politics, not that this is an ideological text in any way) just shy of Gonzo and heavy on the symbolic imagery- if you want to FEEL what it was like to be there- this book delivers the goods.Fun fact: the heilcopter scene in "Full Metal Jacket" was taken from this book, and the film is half-based on it.
What goes to Herr's credit is, that as a reporter, he is far from glorifying war reporters.
He openly admits that “press corps in Vietnam was as diffuse and faceless as any army regiment” and that “some people thought we were nothing more than glorified war profiteers.
And perhaps we were.” I can't assess if this is true, but I'm sure that from all books about Vietnam or war in general, the Dispatches are different, original and will always have special place in my library.
Έδωσε παρών σε μικρές και μεγάλες μάχες, είδε πτώματα στρατιωτών, πεζοναυτών και αμάχων, είδε σοβαρά τραυματισμένους, είδε απίστευτα τοπία κατεστραμμένα από τόννους εμπρηστικών βομβών, είδε διαλυμένες πόλεις και εγκαταλελειμμένα χωριά, γνώρισε ένα κάρο τρελαμένους τύπους, που είτε ήταν τρελαμένοι πριν καν πατήσουν στο Βιετνάμ είτε ήταν μια χαρά παιδιά που τρελάθηκαν από την παράνοια και το χάος του πολέμου...
Και αυτό το βιβλίο είναι όσο ωμό, ρεαλιστικό και παρανοϊκό θα περίμενε κανείς από ένα βιβλίο που περιγράφει την τρέλα και το χάος του πολέμου του Βιετνάμ.
Turns out he later wrote the screenplay for Full Metal Jacket and Apocalypse Now, which makes sense because Vietnam film is 100% rooted in the language and stories of this book.
I'm conflicted because it tells things as horribly as they were and yet within this book is the seed for the romanticism of the Vietnam war.
The first modern war.Two-hundred pages and it took a long time to read.
It's all true, so it hits hard, and if you skim you are missing real, harrowing stories.
What a fucked up thing, a clearly defined period of time where a life is worth less than usual.
The thing about war books is how timeless they are, from Homer to Homs.
So it's odd reading a "dated" book about Vietnam to find that it's Syria or Iraq or Afghanistan or wherever grunts shoot and get shot at.
The longest section, on Khe Sanh, is classic Vietnam lit.
Herr befriended the son of actor Errol Flynn -- Sean Flynn, who finally went missing on a bike ride into Cambodia in 70.
And I hear that Herr himself is now a Buddhist monk in the Himalayas or something.
A lifetime.As war books go, one of the better written ones.
Mary Karr's rec (from The Art of Memoir).
Blame Mary.
[2.5 stars] I don't doubt that Dispatches is a Great War Book. The fault is with me. I'm not a good non-fiction war book reader. All the battles and shooting and carnage that Herr reports on made me feel numb. Interestingly, two of my all-time favorite works of fiction are about war: The Things They Carried (Vietnam) and Redeployment (Iraq/Afghanistan). Both of these powerful books brought me much closer to understanding the experience of war than Dispatches did.
No matter what I choose as adjectives to describe Dispatches, it could not amount to anything other than diminishing the raw brilliance of Herr's writing to some tired clichè. Dispatches is unlike any book Ive read or anything I could have imagined. It is in a class of its own. It has been claimed as the finest personal account of war ever written. Im not arguing.
Terrible circumstances have been terrifically described.
if it wasnt bad enough to step into the heart of hell during day you got cat sized rats scampering over you at night. u can almost smell the camphor as you read.
There was so much of the book that was left untouched by Hollywood.But the stories were good, and Herr's experience was very unique.
It is told in a very technical way, and not in any kind of narrative thread so it can get a little jumbled or confusing at times, but then again, perhaps that was what the Vietnam war was all about.Here are three things that will be very helpful to you should you decide to read the book (they came in handy for me, and I wish I had looked at all this stuff before reading(:- First..
From nearly 10 years of hindsight, Herr writes from his experience as a correspondent for Esquire for a one year period from 1967 to 1968, a time of major escalation in the war, including the Tet Offensive and major sieges of Hue and Khe Sahn.
The quality of the writing is solid and renders a great balance between the visceral experiences of combat (the terror, mental erosion, and core of endurance) and reflections on the moral bankrupcy of this unfortunate war.
Although he can�t speak directly on being a participant in combat, he shared enough of the dangers and miseries of the soldiers to render a vision that lies somewhere between the subjective and objective perspectives.
