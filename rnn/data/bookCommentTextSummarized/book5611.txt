We all have good bits and bad bits, and this book does an incredible job of showing the reader the many sides of Florence Nightingale.
I didn't know much about her (apart from the "creator of nursing" thing), and I was absolutely blown away by how much of her life was dedicated towards not just nursing, but sanitation reforms ( In England and India), in creating better living and fighting conditions for the soldiers, reforming military - an eventually civilian - hospitals.The book does an incredible job of showing the pattern and evolution of her work, how she went from a rich girl reading medical books behind her parents' back to being a nurse in the Crimean War, and then eventually revolutionizing the entire concept of sanitation and health.She sacrificed her life, her health, and sometimes her friend's lives, for the cause.
I knew very little about Florence Nightingale before reading this book.
As I was reading, I would think, "I want to work harder!
I want to make a difference in the world!" And then as I continued reading and saw how frustrated she would get and how she wouldn't tolerate it when her cohorts went on vacation, I thought, "Nah." My friend Melani and I are reading this while reading Ayn Rand's "The Virtue of Selfishness." I thought at first that Nightingale and Rand would be polar opposites, but they're not.
I think they would have been great friends.
There must be dozens if not hundreds of books written about this woman who is credited with establishing modern nursing, yet it is this one (which I read a dozen years ago) that sticks with me.
The details of Nightingale's personal life gave me more appreciation for her achievements, which came about at the cost of her health.
Anyone studying public health should read this book, not just for its history, but for implications of bureaucratic bumbling to be forsworn.
Good luck finding it--librarians seem to have turned it over in favor of more recent publications--but you can get it through ABE books.
Never really had an idea about Flo until I read this book, which was recommended to me by an advisor. I am so impressed with the work this woman did, and who she became. Her story inspired me to work even harder than I already was (ahhh nursing school!). I am not going to lie, there are a lot of boring, ultimately inconsequential information; but in a way, it helps the reader realize the magnitude of work this woman did. Strongly recommended to all nurses.
Fascinating!
Throughout her life, Florence was torn between what was expected of woman born to a well-to-do nineteenth-century family and her strong ties to the Unitarian Church, which demanded community service to those less fortunate in society.
She urged proper training for nursing students and hospital sanitation, reflecting the germ theory of illness.I was not aware of Florence's work in India and the depth of personal struggle she experienced between her convictions and the demands of her family.
Her influence on modern healthcare practices cannot be underestimated.I recommend the book for anyone interested in learning more about the evolution of nursing and modern healthcare or to learn about the life of a remarkable, Victorian woman willing to stand up and be counted.
This biography details how that woman both created the idea of the modern nurse and soldier, and broke herself to pieces in doing so.Florence Nightingale was born to a high society couple who were as different as night and day.
Florence went in to reform it, but also managed to change the conception of and ideas about the modern soldier.
It's striking when you think of how much the modern person venerates those who serve; Florence did a large amount of the work needed to reform these soldiers in the public eye.
It's a sober book, portraying a flawed woman who heroically changed so much about society.
Like Joan of Arc, she had a sense God intended her to do something special in her life and she was bound and determined to complete that mission.Her family were horrified when she tried to work as a nurse and repeatedly opposed her.
Back at home, she continued to work hard to reform health care despite being blocked at every turn.
She helped to improve health standards in India, served as a consultant on hospital construction, established a nursing school and in middle age retired to a solitary life of writing about health care, public health and nursing.
The thing that made it tedious for me was that the rest of her life seemed to be a continuous cycle of seeing a problem, working herself to death trying to fix it, meeting serious opposition, getting depressed, then either succeeding or failing.
There is not doubt that Florence Nightingale was an amazing woman that accomplished so many things that improved the world.One other minor note: the author kept using phrases like "then came a crushing blow" and "what followed was one of the most trying experiences of her life" ...
Meticulously researched biography of the famed nurse and humanitarian.
Recent historians have leveled much criticism at Florence Nightingale, from her resistance to germ theory and unpleasant personality, which even Woodham-Smith's account doesn't entirely avoid.
What emerges is a portrait of a deeply troubled woman possessed of a single-minded nature.
Unquestionably, her achievements in the Crimea and afterwards, raising standards of nursing and medical treatment in general, drawing attention to sanitation concerns and reforming military medicine, succeeded because of this.
This also informed Nightingale's often vindictive personality, which viewed people as means to an end (read her treatment of Sidney Herbert) and eschewed true friendship.


I started flicking through this book about Florence Nightingale when I first found it in a charity bookshop earlier in the year but never really read it.
Now I needed some information from it for a story I started during NaNoWriMo so have read the majority of it.
Still dipping in and out for research purposes but it is a real fascinating insight.However I have discovered some very conflicting information between some of the things happening at the time of the Crimean War from Florence's point of view and the point of views of some of the Nun's that went out there too.Very interesting may need looking at more deeply?
Miss Nightingale was an extraordinary person who lived an extraordinary life. This book was very well researched - almost too much so, because by about halfway through all the minute details became kind of a slog to get through. If you're doing a paper on her, this would be a great reference and includes an index - so it's proably worth 4 stars there. As an entertaining biography, it could've used a little editing. Also I'm guessing that's the most appearances of the word 'sanitary' in any book I've ever read.
If you don't know anything at all about Florence Nightingale by the time you finish this book you will feel her an old friend and mentor. I have never read an book about anyone with so much detail. The book also gives you a wonderful list of all of the sources the author used. You can find the books that Florence herself wrote on the Gutenberg book site. I think they are a must read for anyone in the medical field. Without this book I would have never known what to look for.
Excellent review of Florence Nightingale's activities and accomplishments to bring improved health and medical treatment for British soldiers in the Crimean War and hospitals in India. Her amazing work establishing well-trained nurses is often overlooked. The review of her life was respectful and presently in an interesting way.
It is a good read for all nurses and anybody interested in history of medicine and nursing. I am extremely proud and inspired by the heroic acts of Florence nightingale. Despite all the medical advancements and studies she was able to save thousands of lives based on her own observation and instinct. Florence is everything I aspire to be as a nurse.
Thouroughly enjoying reading about Florence Nightingale at the moment. The amazing thing for me is finding out she was so muhc more than the "lady with the lamp", and was actually much more of a pioneering reformist in goverment polocies. Written with extreme accessibility, it has been a real page turner for me!
This was a totally different spin from the biography I read last year. This was a woman of vast complication in both her personal and professional career. All I could think about was "[post tramatic syndrome" as I read of her mental struggles to overcome the war.
I loved this book. You will be blown away by this amazing lady. All she had to go through to accomplish what she did. The opposition of her family, not to mention the conventions of the time. It's mind boggling.
This is an amazing story and puts paid to all the myths about the nice sweet lady with the lantern.
Florence Nightingale was a remarkable person. I liked this book, but it may not be for everyone. It is one of those dry, boring English books written 60 years ago, but I like that kind of stuff!
A woman with a passion to remove oppression and empower through health.
Cecil Woodham-Smith���s writing is impeccable. She doesn���t attempt to sugar coat the facts, but presents them as they are, all the while spinning an entertaining tale.
An excellent book. The author gives the reader an entirely new look at Florence Nightingale, who was far more complicated than authorized history would have us believe.
Absolutely fascinating and surprisingly compellingly written - for most of the book I couldn't put it down.
One of the first biographies I ever read. Well written. I was amazed by this tiny woman who affected to be an invalid but wrought so much change.
I learned far more about her than I thought I would. She was a sort of "Mother Teresa" of her day. She gave up great riches to serve the wounded and sick and to advance the field of nursing.
