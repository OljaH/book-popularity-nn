This series is the Harry Potter of cat books.
These stories are full of danger, friendship, forbidden love, betrayal, and self-discovery and it is all surprisingly believable for talking cats.
I had physical reactions - crying, laughing, tightening in my chest - to this series.
I would highly recommend it, as long as you can suspend your disbelief, put away your preconceived notions about "talking animal books," and just enjoy a good story.
It left me staring at my cats and feeling vaguely disappointed that they couldn't talk.This one is my personal favorite, mainly because of the friendship between Fireheart and Graystripe.
Second read: September 7-10, 2017Oh the drama unfolds and a cats treachery is finally revealed. Bum bum bum.... First read: August 7-8, 2009Another great Warrior's book. :-) I just love reading about the clan cats. I recommend these books to anyone who loves cats, animals or if you just like reading about adventure, these are the books for you. But make sure you start with this series or you will be out of order. :-)
Warriors rule!
This book was so awesome. It made me laugh, it made me cry... I just think that everyone should read the Warrior Cats series because it is brilliant... I hope that this series is getting just better and better. I really loved the story, the characters are just great. The writing style is really good. This book is so great.I recommend this to EVERYONE.
And Tuigerclaw is waiting for them at the tunnel.Silverstream and Graystripe have produced kits -- but Cinderpaw, Thunderclan's medicine cat apprentice, is unable to stop the bleeding and spasms, and can only save two.
Silverstream dies while she's still bleeding, and Graystripe weeps over the limp body as her spirit fades away.But Tigerclaw was there, and now he can tell Bluestar everything: how Graystripe has betrayed the clan by breeding with a cat from another clan.
In this book, Fireheart tries harder than ever to find out the truth about Redtail's death; and along the way, finds out that his best friend, Greystripe, is in love with Silverstream from RiverClan!But being in love can be very dangerous for the Clan cats...Even kits know that loving a cat from a different Clan is forrbidden.
It almost does; becuase near the end of the book, Greystripe breaks the news to Fireheart: Silverstream is going to have kits!
But lukcly, brave Greystripe breaks the ice by announcing that he will live with RiverClan; so the two Clan can avoid war, and Riverclan may keep the kits.Will Fireheart ever see Greystripe again?
I've known about these books for years and never read them because I thought they were just going to be dumb kid books, but this series is fantastic. My favorite one so far - Mostly because of Cloud Kit. I think he's just so adorable. Also - the guy that narrates the audio books is really good. Makes it very fun to listen to.
This story is so sad. One died!One betrayed!One left!But I can't wait to read the next book.
Granted this was probably put in for people who didn't start off at books #1...Still, through out the book there was constant reminders of certain events whenever Fireheart talked to "so and so" (not going to say who).
As the book unfolds things start to become obvious and I'm sure you can work them out before the events unfold but still it doesn't change how it all plays out.Near the end of the book I started to feel sad just because what was going on..I guess you can say I got a little more suckered into this series than I orignally thought I would :P
this book is about the old dark secrets in the 5 clans, Fireheart tries to get to the bottom of the mysterious deaths in the past, the truth he finds is unbelievable, and he finds other startling truths about the clans.
He also find about traitorous plans in his own clan, he desperately tries to revile it to his clan, but his lack of authority brings him down,but time is running out.
Every second the plan develops...
Well again i really loved this book and the series and i hope to read on to the #4 of the warrior series!
there are like 30 or something books in this series/universe so I was kinda intrigued to pick it up again after some years to see where it's got to but that's still some way to go haha. I always liked stories about talking animals, especially cats. warrior cats is short, adventurous and fun to read and I was pleasantly surprised by how attached I got to all dem kitties. 3.5/5 stars
This book was defiantly awesome it totally got my 5 star rating its just an awesome series Yay KITTIESlllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll;lllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll;

Para los fans, no se pierdan esta oportunidad, son muchos gatos y no te llenan de pelo (?)Nuestro protagonista es un gato llamado Corazón de Fuego (porque es pelirrojo) y gracias a un narrador en tercera persona, conoceremos cada detalle de la vida de este felino y de sus compañeros del Clan del Trueno.
Amo la manera en la que detallan el comportamiento de los gatos, como miran ellos las cosas y lo que hacen con ellas.
Hay muy buenas ocurrencias, como los gatos "curanderos" que saben todo acerca de las hierbas y sus posibles remedios naturales.
oh MAN this is where the drama really starts to ramp up. the half-clan kits. the death. the BETRAYAL. things are getting heated up for these cats.
After finishing the 3rd book in the first series, Forest of Secrets, I wish my local bookstore was still open this late so I could go buy the next book in the series!
I am officially hooked, book 3 is action packed start to finish, with plenty of shocking twists and, as the title suggests, plenty of secrets, most of which are revealed by the end of the book, where everything....and I do mean everything changes.
I have to say I am amazed at how good these books are.
Highly recommend book and series, I can't wait to see where the story will go from here!
Oh. My. Gosh. Such an incredible reread, and currently my favourite of the Original Series, with Into the Wild close behind. Just everything about this book, especially the emotion, was great. Silverstream and Greystripe's kits, Bluestar admitting about her kits in the past and what she had to give up for herself, Tigerclaw and the rogue cats, Fireheart becoming deputy - such a superb reread that I thoroughly enjoyed. :)
The Warriors books just keep getting better!
Everything I've been waiting to happen happened.
- Adventures :)This was an exciting book, filled with tension between clans, secrets revealed, and friendships tested.
Brackenpaw is Graystripe's apprentice NOT Fireheart's.
Go see Silverstream all you want, but at least pay some attention to your apprentice!!!- Cloudkit scared me sometimesThere was that one scene where he reminded me of Brokenpaw from Yellowfang's Secret.
If you like cats, adventure, battles, or romance, this is the book for you.
What to read after Forest of Secrets:Warriors #4: Rising Storm and Yellowfang's Secret
Wow, finished that one in little more than 24 hours. Could NOT put it down.Fireheart proves again and again his loyalty to ThunderClan and it`s leader Bluestar, but there are tragedies, broken hearts, deceipt and the enthusiasm of the younger generation in a hurry to be "grown up." Nothing new there, right. Loved every word, from beginning to end. On to the next in this series: "Rising Storm."Take it from me, you don`t have to be a child to enjoy these stories at all.

Trešà daļa ir vēl izcilākā par pirmajām divām daļām. Beidzot Pērkona klans uzzināja, ko sliktu izdarīja Tīģernags pirmajā, otrajā un trešajā daļā. Ātrāk gribu izlasīt 4 daļu lai uzzināt, vai klans atvedīs Kraukļaķepu no divkājajniem atpakaļ uz mežu. Ja kas, divkājajnie ir cilvēki, tā viņus sauc klanu kaķi. Un šoseju viņi sauc par pērkontaka, bet mašīnas par briesmoņiem. Tas ir smieklīgi.
Forest of Secrets leaves you on a cliff hanger leaving you in a state of shock.
I do believe this book had so many plotlines at some parts of the book, that it may leave a reader confused.
I also believe that the plotline in this book was not so dissimilar from the previous books in the series.
Forest Of Secrets is a likable book, but it is not one of those books that gives you the feeling that you can not put the book down because it captivates you so (Harry Potter Series).
I believe this series is definitely more for a juvenile reader; hence my discontinuation of reading the series.
I mean, the book was amazing, but there was just one niggly thing that I couldn't remember even though the names were really familiar, and that was (view spoiler)[that Mistyfoot and Stonefur are Bluestar's kits.
(hide spoiler)] I also couldn't remember if it was this book that (view spoiler)[Silverstream died in, and it was :( That was pretty sad.
(hide spoiler)] One thing that I didn't put in this book at all was (view spoiler)[Tigerclaw's betrayal!
I could never remember how that happened, so I got such a shock when he tried to murder Bluestar!
(hide spoiler)] I hope that (view spoiler)[Graystripe works over in RiverClan :( (hide spoiler)]
As the third book in the Warriors Series I found this story enjoyable. However, it was less solidified, less polished than the previous books. Still an engaging read. I regret not having read these books as a kid because I probably would have enjoyed them more because the characters are great and the idea and concept is intriguing. It's the overall composition of this particular book that detracts from its potential; it is a little jumbled, with various ideas and story lines interwoven sometimes unsuccessfully. Having said this, the ending had a fantastic spin. 3 stars.
great book. Fireheart finds out the truth about Tigerclaw, and Redtail's death. Silverstream gave birth to Graystripe's kits, but she dies after giving birth do to the loss of blood. Tigerclaw gets exiled from ThunderClan, but is still in the forest. Bluestar didn't believe Fireheart, but she was wrong. Brokentail/ Brokenstar is dead. Such an amazing book.
2/4/13 I just finished reading warriors book #2 by Erin Hunter. I loved this book because it was full of great adventure and romance. In a way it's partly like Romeo and Juliet because there are four clans and two cats in different clans love each other but it's against the rules for two clans to talk except for when its a full moon
What can I say? I'm hooked on the series. It seems like a silly concept but the story really sucks you in and it's easy reading....
I loved the drama and all the secrets involved. The detail and description was amazing.
This book had a twist that surely will leave the reader thinking about everything that may or may not happen!
AWESOME
Ya extrañaba meterme en la piel de un gato guerrero. Y al clan del trueno. Ahhhh pero que sentimientos encontrados me dejo u.u
That’s not to say that every moment has to be exciting and life-threatening, but I feel like compared to the other books there wasn’t as much drama until the very end with filler in between.
It’s almost like warriors feel all or nothing: either they feel nothing at all for their kin and show no remorse when something happens to their mates, or they react the opposite way and spiral out of control.
He even mentions that no one could ever feel as strongly as they do for each other, even though Graystripe literally had a mate who he loved more than his own life and then later has his kits.
