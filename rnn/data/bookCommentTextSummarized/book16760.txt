Preacher has so much graphic violence that the makers of the Saw movies can’t read it without projectile vomiting.Preacher has such profane language that Chris Rock would cover his ears if he heard it.Preacher has acts of sexual perversions so disgusting that Larry Flynt once said he would have never taken his case to the Supreme Court if he knew that this was the kind of stuff that would get published.But damn, is it a great story.Jesse Custer, a reluctant redneck minister in a tiny Texas town gets endowed with the Word of God after bonding to an entity that escaped Heaven.

  I need the rest of these books..Right now.
And I did.The story thrives on a combination of graphic violence, humour, and weirdness.
The main character, Jessie, the eponymous preacher has acquired a rather fine super-power, he has the voice of God, and when he uses it everyone has to obey him.
He has questions for God and is unsure what to do with his newfound power.
The whole thing is off-beat and addictive.The art is well done and supports the story.
My experience reading on is that it goes gradually downhill but even by book 6 it's still a fun read.I've recently watched season 1 of the TV series based on the graphic novels.
So great!
I mean, if it hadn't been for just watching the first season of the TV series, I probably never would have picked this up to read, but then I would have been missing out on more irreverent goodness!Believe it or not, this picks up right at the end of the first season's action, although, all the character building has already been done on the show, so I'm rearing to go and ready to see what comes next.
Thankfully, there's plenty to enjoy!The Saint of Murderers is great and the bits about the angels is too sweet and delicious not to chortle over, but the best parts have got to be the interactions between Jessie, Cass, and Tulip.
Irreverent barely describes it, and it's a breath of fresh air.New York was a great hoot, too.
If you've never read Garth Ennis before, this is a good place to start.
Because odds are, you're going to love this series, or hate it.
And, by no small twist of fate, odds are that you're also going to either love or hate Garth Ennis.
Why would you hate Ennis?
Well, because his work contains graphic ultraviolence, vulgarity, and blasphemy on pretty much every conceivable level.
Why would you love Ennis?
For pretty much the same reasons.
So my thought is you might as well just in and learn what side of the fence you're going to be on right off the bat.
In fact, I’ve had numerous friends say, “You have to read this book,” and, “Dude, you will love this book,” and since it was all from people I trusted, loving Preacher was my expectation.Nope.
First, this book is populated by the most idiotic array of stereotypes and caricatures (certainly these characters can’t be called archetypes) outside of a Circus Sideshow:Foul-mouthed, sexed-up, lost his faith Preacher?
✓Foul-mouthed, sexy, Preacher-loving-hating Moll?
I thought I was opening something on par with Alan Moore’s best, and with expectations like that there was no way Preacher Gone To Texas could succeed.
Like the introduction of a character named Arseface who tried to emulate Kurt Cobain by blowing his head off, but didn't quite do the job right and ended up surviving but with a mangled face, and you can't understand what he's saying, so there's this little translation box down in the corner.
Custer's also got some supernatural, can't-die cowboy dude after him (well, after Genesis) and it's kind of a road trip story also?
The story could have been a little better overall, but this is the first volume, so a lot of it was set up.
After reading Kemper's awesome review I knew I'd be getting to Preacher eventually -- now after having read the first volume I'm left wondering why the hell did I wait so long?!
It's bloody, gory grit and gasoline pulp Texas style, with demons and angels and a possessed preacher, an Irish vampire and a supernatural gunslinger known as the Saint of Killers -- who reminded me instantly of Roland Deschain crossed with Randall Flagg.Something has gone very wrong in heaven: a terrifyingly powerful entity (the offspring of an angel and a demon known as Genesis) has escaped to earth and binds itself to a mortal man -- Jesse Custer (redneck preacher of a small Texas parish).
There's a vicious serial killer on the loose too just to keep things from, you know, getting boring.
WTF?!Oh man, I was really expecting to be blown away here, but this was just a colossal disappointment.
😭 So much so, that I'm not sure if I even care to continue—it was a struggle to even make it through this one.Let's see here .
two dimension characters, cringe worthy dialog, terrible jokes that mostly fell flat, and a rather dull, juvenile storyline lacking that vital spark.
I didn't care much for the artwork either.
I just don't understand all the overwhelming love for this series.To borrow a line from my friend Ed - Final Judgment: Lower your expectations.
Quite a weird book, but intriguing nonetheless and it's worth checking out for the immaculate artwork alone.
WELL THAT WAS WEIRD
Now with the word of God embedded within him, Jesse forms an alliance with his ex-girlfriend Tulip and a drunken Irish vampire named Cassidy as they embark on a journey to find God - and not in the "I'm saved/born again" sense but the "I'm going to kick your ass for deserting mankind" sense.I'm going to try and give you my thoughts on the first volume but it would be hard for me to live up to the excellent review written by Kemper.- I honestly have no idea where this is headed, which is awesome.- The excessive violence and the profanity could be distracting IF the writing had been terrible (i.e.
My problem with some of these "comics for adults" books is that they seem like just that.
Its as though a child wanted to prove how adult he was so he filled his book full of sex and swearing and crude jokes so everyone would know he was really mature.
And so, as I have found with a lot of these adult comic books, it ends up feeling more juvenile than many of the ones that do not attempt to be labeled as adult.
I really wanted to like this book.
Jesse Custer is our faithless priest who gets possessed by Genesis, the powerful offspring of a forbidden relationship between Angel and Demon.
So the story takes place mainly on terra firma with interludes to heaven, where the powers that be don't really want Genesis around, too dangerous and too powerful.
The artwork was ok, the story was the clincher for me, ending in our three heroes setting out to find the one and only, God, who has forsaken mankind and is apparently wandering about somewhere after acquiring a suitable disguise.
So that's the endgame find the all-powerful, who probably doesn't want to be found, so let's get on it.
5 starsWow.I don't even know what to say...(view spoiler)[ (hide spoiler)]This is not the kind of tale that won't sound a bit nuts if I try to explain or describe it.

To be honest, I was so close to marking this as a DNF at the start of this volume.
I thought it was really hard to get into it and I wasn't enjoying it at all.
I'm glad I gave it a chance though because I feel like I'll really enjoy reading this comic series.
The second half of the volume was definitely much better than the first half.
I wasn't really enjoying the artwork much either at the start but it definitely grew on me.
I feel like this is a really original idea and I'm excited to see where it goes.
One of those "impossible" genre combos but it seems to work, at least for me on a second read.
But it's really Jesse's story of coming of age through absolute hell, and his arrival upon his well-deserved power and vengeance, that is the meat and potatoes of the book.
And it's filled with brilliant writing like the quote above.
Between Steve Dillon illustrating, one of my all time favorites Matt Hollingsworth coloring, and Glenn Fabry illustrating the covers, this is a fantastic looking book!
I really enjoyed looking at these images.
Like Brian Bolland-level.
Read this!
I heard the name of Garth Ennis for the first time with this comics, but I will not forget anytime soon.This is an incredible story, with at the center three unlikely heroes: Jesse Custer, a precher possesed by a spiritual force, able to compete with God, his old girlfriend, Tulip and Cassidy, an Irish vampire.
Ennis put many human question about God to a practical basis, using a disillusioned preacher for give a voice to them.
So while I admit that I didn't read nearly enough to judge Preacher as a series, I do think I have the right to discuss how the first books affected me, and why I have little intention of reading any more.The other introductory comment I'd like to make is that we were all primed for Preacher by reading reviews insisting that this series was not for the faint of heart, that there was pretty much something here to offend everyone—the blood and gore were horrifying, the language exaggeratedly profane, the plot obscenely sacrilegious, and on and on.
2ND READ-THROUGH: It’s been about 8 years since I first read Preacher, and since I’ve been watching (and loving) the new television series, I figured what better time to revisit the source material? While the show and the comic are vastly different, at least in terms of story (the characterizations seem fairly consistent), I found this first volume to be everything I remembered. Violent and funny and nihilistic and strange. Since originally reading this, I’ve regarded it as my “favorite comic series of all-time,” and after re-reading this, I still stand by that.
Preacher nije ostavio utisak, ali u njemu sam prepoznao stvari koje bi mi zagolicale maštu da sam ga čitao kada sam imao petnaest godina.Mislim, nije Preacher loš strip, u dijalozima ima zabavnih glazbenih referenci (za neke od njih se treba mentalno vratiti u devedesete), poneka fora uspije nasmijati, ali uz sve hvale koje strip dobiva očekivao sam nešto više.
Kako je jedan prijatelj rekao, čitajući sažetak ovog stripa mi se nesvjesno vraćamo u ranije godine kada su nas slične priče oduševljavale pa želimo ponovno doživjeti taj ushit.
I zato se neću pretvarati da je Preacher nešto genijalno i posebno, nego ga ocijeniti onako kako sam ga doživio u ovom trenutku.
My advice: give this one a pass and move on to something better, like "The Sandman", "Persepolis" or "The Unwritten".UPDATE: Upon reading many of the reviews I think I understand a little better the root of this series' popularity.
It's got an insultingly-streotypical portrayal of the American South/West/SouthWest that is rivaled only by the Family Guy episode "Boys Do Cry"!
It's got insulting portrayals of religion, religious people, and religious figures!
It's the sort of thing a High School student would write/draw, believing their ideas to be SO original, but which even small children would recognized as tired, cliched and lowest-common-denominator-approved.
Introduction:  After reading so many graphic novels that were geared towards older teens and adults (Neil Gaiman’s “Sandman” series and Bill Willingham’s “Fables” series), I never would have thought that I would come across a graphic novel that has coarse language practically littered out throughout the entire story while dealing with a subject matter that is so controversial to many readers. That graphic novel, my friends, is “Preacher: Gone to Texas” and man, was I in for a wild ride of my re
After reading so many graphic novels that were geared towards older teens and adults (Neil Gaiman’s “Sandman” series and Bill Willingham’s “Fables” series), I never would have thought that I would come across a graphic novel that has coarse language practically littered out throughout the entire story while dealing with a subject matter that is so controversial to many readers.
Since this is basically the first graphic novel I had read by Garth Ennis, I was amazed at the creativity being put into this story, especially for the fact that Garth Ennis took a subject matter so controversial (in this case, religion) and turned it into an interesting fantasy story that was extremely well written.
The book opens with Jesse, Tulip and Cassidy sitting around a cafe table nattering away, and it’s this setup that bothered me the most in the volume: they’re always sat round cafe tables reminding themselves (and the reader) who they are, what they’re doing, and why they’re doing it.
If you’ve read Ennis before, you’ll already know he writes gory comics - The Punisher, The Boys, Jennifer Blood, War Stories, hell, practically every Ennis book contains the same amount of gore as you see in Preacher, so I’m not sure why it’s worth pointing out about this comic.
The only thing I knew about this graphic novel is that there is a tv series made by it, which I didn’t see btw, and that there is a lot of gore, blood and good old dark as a no moon midwinter night black humor.
I mean, what else could I ask to read when I just need something to help me switch off from all the everyday Christmas and NY nonsense.
It reminded me of the True Detective series season one.
I’ll probably have to watch the series now too.
Reading the next volume doesn’t even come into question.
Damnit, now I'm into digital graphic novels which I can't afford!
I'm re-reading these - not because in any way do I think there's nothing else good worth reading these days, but simply: they're fun, I enjoyed them immensely the first time around, and dammit, I'm gonna read what passes Sims' "going out the door test" rather than "what are all the cool kids reading right now".Ennis does a helluva job setting up this series - getting a ton of core mythology established early on, dropping hints of things to come without fanfare, and etching some deeply flawed characters in deep, raw lines across the page.
Favourite character of the book: Jesse.
5.0 to 5.5 stars. Smart, original, very well written and a ton of fun to read. Garth Ennis is a master. Highly recommended!!
Really cool 1st Volume. Weird wacky and gory. I think my watching of the tv show may have ruined the occasional twists and major plot points a little.
Brutalno dobro :D
