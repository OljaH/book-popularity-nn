Anyways, we just talked all night about 1Q84, about Tengo and Aomame, the star-crossed, NO moon-crossed lovers.
We talked about the people they knew and loved.
We discussed Fuka-Eri and the strange cult, Sakigake, she escaped, and the stranger story she wrote that Tengo had been hired to ghostwrite: Air Chrysalis.
How they just appear strangely and build the elusive Air Chrysalis.
What does the Air Chrysalis represent?
And, utimately, what's inside it?But more than anything, as I looked up into the eyes of the man I adored, we spoke of love.
James Dean looks normal to me now.
What blows my mind is that Murakami felt he needed 900+ pages to drag this whole shebang out.
I read the book, didn't like it and expressed it all in a review.
3. Goodreads, please introduce the option to lock the comment section of specific reviews for the love of God. ETA (on 10 February 2014 12:30AM Central European Time (CET)1.
I am grateful that Goodreads honored my request and even though I am aware of the setting that blocks non-friends from commenting on my reviews that still seems to me to be an extreme option.
So, Love transcends dimensions...And something interesting:
So I've decided to read a book from my "long list" alongside the ARCs/new releases I'm currently reading.
I enjoyed the story and the characters, especially Aomame, who is a total badass and spends her spare time disposing of men who are violent towards women.It's really hard to explain what it's about.
Well, I guess that about sums it up.The story moves between the perspectives of Aomame who "offs" abusive men, and Tengo who is an aspiring novelist.
For a book that gets up to its neck in the bizarre and otherworldly, it was pleasing yet strange to see it all come back to a love story.
Putting the nothingness of the book aside, there are plenty of other, more frustrating issues to contend with.These are a few of the problems I personally had with 1Q84:Aomame comes across as a flat, two-dimensional character whose main purpose is to serve as (an older male) fantasy.
(view spoiler)[I will also admit that I grew very, very weary of every conversation she had with Tengo being punctuated by lines such as "she said to him, massaging his scrotum in her hand."  (hide spoiler)] As with Aomame's segments, the sex all truly appears to serve no purpose, and is crudely written at that, meaning it all comes across as both needlessly pornographic, and incredibly boring, two things good writing - and good sex - should never be.
"Reading a Murakami book is like diving into the ocean only to discover that you have always been a fish. Things suddenly start making sense"

I'd heard it was a difficult read, and certainly it is long, at well over 900 pages, but I find that I'm flying through it.
Murakami knows how to keep the pages turning with a brilliant mix of mystery, fantasy and intrigue.
The book reminds me of Orwell, of course, but also Gabriel Marquez and some early dark urban fantasy like The Land of Laughs by Jonathan Carroll or Little, Big by John Crowley.
(Which you should read, if you haven't.) Yet Murakami isn't really like anyone else, exactly.
Check out the book!
But I honestly do not feel as compelled to want to do so, since everything was repeated so often and so frequently.Occasionally, the book would break out of its redundancy and work the usual Murakami magic.
I'm not sure what the formula for that is, of course there's no exact way of doing this, but there has to be better ways of writing a convincing magical-realist story than lines like this:"Aomame wondered if Fuka-Eri's dohta had been able to survive for long without her maza.
If you aren't already enamored with Murakami's writing, I recommend not reading 1Q84 - unless what you want is a treasure hunt for some simple Japanese recipes.
And the test is a tough one.The first part of the book is nothing short of what you expect from Murakami.
But if they published it as one book, that's how people are going to read it.) Then there are numerous badly written sex scenes.
Because compared to the way Murakami handles multiple stories, Mitchell does seem to be trying too hard.
In any case, I did enjoy Cloud Atlas when I had read it and nothing is going to change that now.
Begone, ye overblown romance: to the M's with ye, and there ye shall stay.
No more will I be forced to read about the "ample breasts" of mysterious, mute women; never again will I be witness to "sexual encounters" that are just a "concept," not the actual bumping of uglies that occurs when a man puts his penis inside of a woman's vagina.Banished will be the sporty assassinatrix who winds down by having one-night stands with bald-headed men; the stocky writer who oscillates between mathematics and prose and the occasional dalliance with a married girlfriend; and the misshapen cranium of an ugly man who skitters from one plot-point to the next with grim purpose, unsuspecting of the authorial foot that hovers, god-like, above the story's flimsy re-bar.Along with these mundane presences, so too will be exiled the various supporting paper cut-outs, wearing the clothes and skins of nurses and bodyguards and editors, muttering incomprehensible directions that pose as mysterious truths in a world with two moons.
He began pumping slowly.These two sentences, on the second to last page of this 924 page novel, are a neat summary of Murakami’s methods in 1Q84.
Aomame, a small-breasted woman, is an assassin who targets men who mistreat women.
Tengo, the large man, and Aomame, the small-breasted woman, once held hands as children, and although they have not seen each other in the twenty years since, they are still soul mates.
Tengo, when he is not teaching math or writing, misses Aomame, the small-breasted woman with whom he once held hands.
Aomame, when she is not killing misogynists or lamenting the size of her breasts, misses Tengo, the large man with whom she once held hands.
This book is possibly the best book I have read of all times.
The book is like all of Haruki Murakami's past books where it is about self discovery of the main character.
The book is about Aomame, one of the main character in the book where in the beginning, she goes into this alternate 1984 called 1Q84.
He writes her story down and edits it becoming a national bestseller, called Air Chrysalis, which the plot of the story is the mystery at the center of the book as the two main characters meet, and falls in love.
"I don’t know if words like “originality” or “inevitability” fit here, and I suppose I might agree if someone insisted it’s not at that level, but finally, after you work your way through the thing, with all its faults, it leaves a real impression—it gets to you in some strange, inexplicable way that may be a little disturbing.""If You Can't Understand It Without An Explanation, You Can't Understand It With An Explanation.""It was probably Chekhov who said that the novelist is not someone who answers questions but someone who asks them."Haiku for the Land of Q:Here is an assortment of haiku inspired (or, if lacking inspiration, stimulated) by "1Q84".Please add your contributions and improvements in the comments.And don't forget to read the interview at the foot of the haiku.Yo La Tengo (HaiQ)Remember your hand,How it held mine so firmly.Now we are grown up.Sonic Youth (HaiQ)Under the two moons.Aomame, Tengo, Q.Fuka-Eri, too.
As they both realize that they are not in same world as before, they then begin to ponder the peculiarities of the new world and wonder if they, in fact, are the only ones that are aware that they are in 1Q84.SeanAs I began reading the first hundred pages or so, I was extremely curious about where this story was going.
I decided that since I had already finished 200 pages, I just had to continue.1Q84The story switched back and forth between these two protagonists and we eventually learn that each character lives very similar lives.
By book 2, the underlying mystery of the story is revealed and the reader eventually learns the motives among all of the characters in the story.
I can tell you from what bookstore I bought it.
I don't know exactly what I was wearing—but it was probably a sweater of some sort with a t-shirt underneath, worn but serviceable dress pants and well polished brown or black shoes.
I don't remember what my friend was wearing but it was probably jeans, a t-shirt and a denim jacket.
I could tell you a lot of my friend's back story, although he probably would not appreciate it, and in any case it is not relevant to the review, except indirectly.
this is an entirely undeveloped love story/religious cult story/crime story passing itself off as a deep book about time, reality, truth, good and evil.
you should read this book only if you find pleasure in murakami's voice.
it will leave you depleted and empty, or at least as empty or full as you were when you started reading it -- that is, if this lengthy rumination about the pretend meaning of things doesn't yank your soul from you.
i'm abandoning this book to save my soul.
You never know where you'll find yourself when you pick up one of Haruki Murakami's novels.
The way Murakami weaves history with a constantly evolving reality gives the feel of a speculative novel offering an alternative history.
When Aomame gets out of her taxi and makes an unexpected/out of the ordinary decision, does she really open an alternative 1984 or has Aomame simply opened herself up to experiencing a deeper reality?
The cab driver had both warned her that "Things are not what they seem" and "There is always only one reality." The interweaving stories of a math teacher, Tengo, and the 17-year old Fuka-Eri (whose novel Tengo rewrites) add surprises and bizarre twists to this nearly 1,000-page epic.
عنوان داستان از روی تصادف، یادآور رمان «1984» نوشته ی «جورج اورول» نیست؛ بلکه حرف انگلیسی «کیو»، در ژاپن، همانند عدد «9» خوانده می‌شود.
اجزای سازنده ی این رمان نیز تازه نیستند؛ اما آن‌ها مفصل و دقیق هستند.
تنها در نگاه دوم است که متوجه تغییرات کوچکی همانند اونیفورم متفاوت پلیس‌ها می‌گردد.
در این کتاب نه تنها ماهیت روح مانند «لیتل پیپل»، بلکه یک فرقه مذهبی با آیین‌های هولناک نیز آشکار می‌گردد.
«آئو مامه» و «تنگو»، نه تنها به این دلیل قهرمانان معمولی «موراکامی» هستند، بلکه باهوش، با استعداد، جذاب هستند.
این خصلت‌ها برای «موراکامی» شرط‌های مهم و لازم قهرمانانش هستند.
I got to know Aomame and Tengo in every way possible, and I will miss them like old friends.
1Q84 is the third longest book I've read, as far as page count is concerned.
It is also one of the only books over a thousand pages that I've read which was not written by Stephen King.
It's magical realism, so expect to find some weird shit going down that people are overall okay with.
If most of you in my friends list asked me if you should read this book, I'd likely say no.
It’s difficult to summarize this trilogy but as a reader and an admirer, it gave me an opportunity to recognize the depth of Murakami as a writer.
It’s a clever conformity with the world which Orwell predicted and Dostoyevsky imagined.
How one construes those images is a crucial but complicated task for readers and when a book turns out to be 1000+ pages long there should be no surprise if it attracts 1000+ interpretations too.
This book however gained 4 stars and all my discontent, my sarcastic laughs, my rolling of eyes moments and my little disappointments are condensed into one single star which I’m keeping as a bookmark for my next Murakami novel.
Long theory explained in the spoiler section in the middle...The odd thing about this book is that whether I like it or hate it hinges on a particular point of interpretation, one that I'm not really sure is meant to be dissected the way I'm doing.
Talk to me, Murakami readers.(Several months later: I do hope that the lameness of the later book was rooted in some kind of post-modern feminist angle, but it seems admittedly doubtful, and contradicts what I know about Murakami's meandering, often under-directed working methods, which are always present, even in the better work, in the inability to write an ending).Basically, the first half of 1Q84 seems like pretty good Murakami all around.
Reading this book is like being in a bad marriage but you can't decide if it's actually bad or not.
Somewhere along the way, I lost a bit of interest and started thinking about the other unread books in my list.
Some days were great, some days were bad.
There's a lot of sex (and an obsession with breasts) along the way too but what really got to me was the fantastical parts of the book.
The translation work is fantastic and often made me wonder how they did it so well, especially where references are made to particular words.
I think this book taught me something.
It's a book I listened to over a period of weeks, over 40 hours worth of the normal Murakami mix of sex, food and parallel dimensions.
I know I'll have to listen to it again - and I really do think that audio is the ideal vehicle for Murakami's longer, more complex pieces - probably within the next 12 months.
I know it'll call me back.--------------------------------------An epic, magnificent and surreal love story.
I know this book divides opinion but I believe it to be quite brilliant!
It is an ethereal, imaginative, and lyrical tale about long a lost love from childhood.
He slowly fried the chopped ginger over a low flame.”There is a great deal of symbolism that is repeated throughout this novel that adds depth and meaning to this story.“A trace of fatigue was discernible in his voice.
Books numbers one and two are nearly flawless and are a pinnacle achievement from the master story teller Murakami.
I love Murakami and hope that if you have never read his works before that you will give him a try."Ho Ho".
"1Q84 (again, early on… perhaps before page 400 or so) was like a delectable miniseries—you know, the ones that rival the silver screen in their artfulness—each teeny moment was overstuffed, nicely, of course, with drama.
Soon, Murakami turns into a bit of a chore though—we go around in circles and the most miniscule of details are overemphasized, revisited, reinterpreted, &, in the end, all of it meaning absolutely nothing.
For a Murakami, this is a tad too vanilla—even the climax is so much like the end of the Twilight saga (i.e. insipidly anticlimactic & uninteresting) that it made me, well sad.
It's so much easier when books leave me with a very clear idea of what I want to say about them.
His books are a little like reading dreams - weird as all get out, with dream logic that makes sense in context, but make me feel foggy and unsure about what happened by the light of day.Note: The rest of this review has been withdrawn due to the recent changes in Goodreads policy and enforcement.

جا داره به خودم تبریک بگم،سومین کتاب هزار صفحه ای انگلیسی زبانی که امسال خوندم هم تموم شد.
😋این کتاب بدون شک بهترین اثری بود که از موراکامی خوندم.
البته با توجه به ایرادهای فراوان ترجمه فارسیش ترغیب شدم که انگلیسی کافکا در ساحل رو هم بخونم.
طبق معمول کتاب موراکامی پر از موسیقی و ادبیات و غذا و خواب و رویا بود.
اگه از سبک سورئال خوشتون میاد ذره ای در خوندنش شک نکنید.
البته اگه انگلیسی متوسط رو به بالایی دارید حتما حتمااااا انگلیسیش رو بخونید.
The two alternating narrators (1 for each chapter up to the end of Book 2), Tengo and Aomame reminded me of the interspersing but parallel stories he used in Hard-Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World (2 stars).
Murakami repeats himself as if the readers have low reading comprehension that should be reminded in each chapter lest they would be lost because the novel is very long.
