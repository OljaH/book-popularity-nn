Somnath Temple is an important pilgrimage and tourist spot of Gujarat.
Even the small characters roles are well played.Okay now come to the book, story revolves around crisis which Gujarat passed through when Sultan Mahmud of Ghazni attacked and destroyed the sacred temple of Somnath.
Jay Somnath is the story and heroism of Bheemdev and the love of the temple dancer Chaula for him.
This book deals with the historical facts woven interestingly with a story.Despite of humiliation from the outsiders invaders as well as when construction of new temple decided, humiliation from inside pseudo secular invader, temple stood with pride.
Some book also contain photos of Somnath Temple.
Very good book,even though Munshiji never believed about attack. he has beautifully written this event.chracters Gang, Chaula are superb.war description is also very good.
Lovely book. The ending was sort of tragic for my senses. But the grasp of the author in history and his skill in weaving out a tale worth reading out of it is just amazing. He portrays the story of how Gujarat united to fight against an invader who was hellbent on destroying Somnath.
Thanks to kindle come know about the book "Somanatha The Shrine Eternal".
I read all the book from Shri K M Munshi about Gujarat history including Jay Somanatha twice also the big fan of Minshji.
I always been emotional about Somanath Temple.
My two visit to somanath temple and missed to visit museum.
This book really satisfy my zeal for the temple history.
Really great work to put against the common people and bow to Munshiji and Sardar for the great efforts toward it.I read the kindle version of the book and it doesn't have images.
Excellent book. Worth reading.
