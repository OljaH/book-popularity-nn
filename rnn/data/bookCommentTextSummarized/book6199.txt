Take a look at the picture of one such guy and you would think that people in the middle of the last century were weird - exactly what I thought.If you want to see a truly scary deadly fish look no further than a hammerhead shark: To be fair I have to mention that it is much easier to find a goldfish than a hammerhead in Southern California where the novel takes place.
The novel has everything a good mystery needs: lots (and I do mean - lots) of red herrings, very complicated plot, a villain whose identity is very hard to guess until practically the last page, and as an additional bonus Mason's brilliant performance in the courtroom.
Perhaps not my favorite Perry Mason, but good just the same. Perry's client is a girl trying to get money so her boyfriend can get treatment for TB and she's willing to do almost anything to help him--including keeping secrets from Mason. This is a crazy case involving rare goldfish with gill disease, a ruthless businessman with two wives (one former, one current), and lots of money. Perry's usual plan to get the suspect out of circulation nearly puts Della in jail as an accessory after the fact. Not totally "fair play" with the clues, but an excellent courtroom scene.
"You can't blame a client for lying, any more than you can blame a cat for catching canaries". By that line one can tell that Erle Stanley Gardner was the Scott Turow of his time, a practicing lawyer who was able to use his professional experience to create well written, compelling fiction. While Turow is arguably more of a literary read, a Perry Mason book can be relied upon to deliver a gripping mystery with some laughs and a deep appreciation of human foibles and triumph.
For love of Della. <3
But I also prefer unravelling over-complex cases of fraud to wading through yet another gruesome child murder (hello, 21st century crime genre) and I just enjoy the ride through 1930s-50s crime, with its guns, blondes, cars and in the case of Perry Mason, fascinating courtroom battles.In this particular story, it hardly helps that the main characters have the surnames of Dixon, Carson, Staunton and Madison.
At first it seems to be a case about goldfish and then it becomes a case about the aforementioned business deals.
But the story ends up being not really about goldfish, and it is a pretty good story.I love the social history in these books.
A cab ride cost 80 cents; a hotel room, $6, and a day's work for a private detective paid $12.I also some irritations with the plot.
Why is a girl of limited means like Sally carrying an alligator purse?But the bigger issues are what keeps be from four stars, even though this was in general fun to read.
THE CASE OF THE GOLDDIGGER’S PURSE.
Erle Stanley Gardner.
**.This was the first Perry Mason novel that I just could not get into.
The plot involved the stealing of intellectual property that was developed to cure goldfish of a fin disease.
In this case, the specific species of goldfish was the Veiltail Moor Telescope.
I’m not sure if that is a real species or not, but Gardner used it as his star.
He gets into the typical debate on when a technology belongs to an employee or not if the technology is developed while he is working for the employer.
If you can get into goldfish, you might get through this novel.
Is Harrington Faulkner being blackmailed, or is something more sinister going on?Perry Mason is forced to choose sides when, in the course of protecting a witness, Della Street's fingerprints end up on a murder weapon.Erle Stanley Gardner's iconic creation pulls the reader from one clue to the next as he uses all his skill to free his client.
Not my favorite Perry Mason. In the end the killer's motivation was explained too little for my liking and it felt a bit off. On the other hand, there's plenty of the stuff I read Perry Mason for - juggling with revolvers and goldfish and bullets and pulling a rabbit out of a hat for the client.
1945 title with no mention of World War II
As always great :)
A very confusing, elaborate murder mystery. Full of twists and alternate logical solitions.
An interesting case of a man, Harrington Faulkner, whose only hobby is collecting gold fishes.
Mason enters the story to save the gold digger from the press, but later finds out that she is hiding the murder weapon in her purse and his secretary, Della accidently touched it.
Now, Mason is out to save Della and Sally both.Gardner describes the people’s characteristics in detail which makes the whole story come to life.
Yet soon, Mason his fighting to save his own secretary from the accusation of hiding the accused and also solves the mystery involving three women who are out for money.
#26 in the Perry Mason series.
Perry is forced to accept and defend a client of whose innocence he is not certain.
If the client is not acquited, Della Street, Mason's secretary, will be jailed as an accessory after the fact.
As in the best of the Mason mysteries, Perry deduces something from the evidence other than what the police have assumed.
This time around he intrigues the judge and frustrates the DA, managing to provide his theatrical court presentation at a preliminary hearing.Perry Mason series - Mason is surprised to hear that someone wants to consult him about a sick goldfish, and the case also concerns a crooked partner, a secret formula, and a gold-digging ingenue accused of murder.
This book in Perry Mason series has just won a personal award from me. It is for 'Book that Contains the Biggest Amount of Douchebags'. Gosh! Almost everyone are very irritating. Tge victim is a leech, the suspect (defendant, if you wish) is a real Jezebel who tells lies as natural as we breath, and the others... They're the best examples on why human begins to lost trust to fellow human. I am having a hard time to understand Mason's decision not to drop his soon-to-be client as early as possible.
Good – better characterization than in other books in the series. ESG takes Mason's antics a bit more seriously here. Mason gets an honest out rather than his usual trickery. Even Tragg is likable. The romance with Della floats through rather nicely. This one doesn't play fair. There are quite a few red herrings. ESG is more concerned with the process of solving this one more than he is in the solution itself.
I actually read the first edition of this, Grosset & Dunlap, 1945. The book was in terrible physical condition with (cheap) paper crumbling at almost every touch. No mention of World War II again. Gardner seemed to sidestep it completely. A golddigger who isn't. A man obsessed with goldfish. Perry swinging Della around the dance floor and calling her darling. Paul Drake in the background.
A man hires Perry Mason to protect himself and his special goldfish against an avarice golddigger. But then the fish disappear and a body is found. How the fish are involved and why the murder was committed are all part of the mysteries in this story. A typical Perry Mason story with a twist in the courtroom.
Average Perry Mason novel.
A pretty good read. Not Gardener's best, but not bad.
My Rating System:* couldn't finish, ** wouldn't recommend, *** would recommend, **** would read again, ***** have read again.
Yet another Perry Mason
I liked the tension in this story more than many other Perry Mason books. But the typographical errors in the e-book challenge a reader too much. The publisher is grossly negligent.
Not a great deal of action in this but a lot of clever thinking. It made me realise how careful you ought to be about what you say. I enjoyed Mason's careful questioning to find the truth.
Another good entry in the Perry Mason series.
A great old book. I love the old stories. Everyone is smoking and the cars need to be warmed up before the murder can drive away. Classic language and solid storytelling.
Have read better cases of Perry Mason
