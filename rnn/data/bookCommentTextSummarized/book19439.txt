The first thing I should say is that I picked this book up about 4 hours ago and haven't been able to put it down since.
It isn't a short book, it runs just over 300 pages, but I simply couldn't stop reading.
Her writing picks you up and transports you into the story.
That was soon shattered by my frantic page turning a few chapters later.I agree with this quote from the back of the book "...The Book of Tomorrow is an utterly unique story about grief, loss, and how sometimes it takes tomorrow to get us through today." I highly recommend this book.
Oh, Cecelia Ahern, how I love you.
It was one-of-a-kind and spooky and I'm running out of adjectives here, so I'm just going to say that I really, really loved it.Cecelia Ahern's (still don't know how to pronounce her last name) books are really hard to explain.
There's always this touch of magic in her stories, that makes the ordinary fascinating and fantastic.
If you have an open mind and you like stories full of mystery and with a touch of magic, you should definitely read this amazing, amazing book.
I have read all of Cecelia Ahern's books after falling in love with her book P.S. I Love You. I'm sad to say that her 2 latest books, this and The Gift, have been major disappointments for me.
The main character finds a book with entries in her writing from the next day.
I was looking for a whimsical read when I picked up this book, and was sorely disappointed.
I'd much rather finish a book feeling sad that it's over rather than grateful I'm finished.I am starting to get discouraged by Ahern's latest efforts.
My jaw is literally on the floor with the content in this book especially being marketed to young adults (which is ages 15-21) 15 uses of the F word.
The main character thinks that by 16 she should have had sex and she is set on finding a guy to sleep with.
The main character says, "If the first man I sleep with ends up being the man I marry, I think I'll die." Wow, yeah.
I'm sorry I read this book.
This book should be rated R and kept out of the hands of young people.
Tamara is concerned about her mother, but is told by her aunt that she just needs to rest and in time she will get better.One day Tamara meets a young man named Marcus Sandhurst who runs a travelling library.
Being called away by her aunt, Tamara takes the book with and hopes to open it soon.Exploring her surroundings, Tamara meets and befriends a local nun by the name of Sister Ignatius.
As she starts to read what is in the book, Tamara soon figures out that the entries are dated a day ahead of time.
Gave it 80 pages to decide if I wanted to keep reading, but when I spotted the wrong use of the word 'OCD' AND transphobia on the same page, I knew I was done. Other complaints include the main character's entire fucking personality, and too many mentions of sex and clubbing. Fuck this book.
What she discovers within the pages takes her breath away and shakes her world to its coreMy Take: The mysteries of this story unraveled beautifully as the events unfolded.
The protagonist, Tamera, decides to use the diary as a tool for making better decisions.
This does not stop her from making mistakes but it does give her clues to the mysteries surrounding the castle, her aunt and uncle, her mother, her father, and herself.
There's a castle, strange inhabitants (gatehouse for this book), secrets kept but it is the way the story is unfolded and particularly the way the authors provide life for inanimate things and places that I really enjoyed.
Characters did some mysterious things here and there, but the protagonist, Tamara, basically just wandered around, whined, and thought about how she was much better than everyone else.
The diary makes predictions, and then the subsequent paragraph reads like, "and then Tamara did those things, and they turned out like the diary said!" (That's really not much of an exaggeration.)Another thing: Why were there two love interests?
It's not like they were really competing with one another, and having one love interest fade away halfway through the story was just distracting.More than anything else, I think what bothered me was how painfully obvious the "surprise" ending was.
Fans of Cecelia Ahern’s work will no doubt love her latest novel, The Book of Tomorrow, but typical YA readers may have a more difficult time getting into this beautifully written, but slow-paced story about a spoiled teen girl who learns some hard lessons about life, fate and how your actions affect the world around you.The story follows Tamara after the suicide of her father.
But none of these bits ever fit together; they felt disjointed and as such, it was hard as the reader to get a good grasp on what kind of book I was reading and where the story was going.
Ο τρόπος που τα περιγράφει η νεαρή έφηβη της ιστορίας μας ειναι αρκετά εντυπωσιακός και θα τολμούσα να πω βαθυστόχαστος.Μετα την τραγωδία που ξεσπά στην οικογένεια ολα βαίνουν ομαλά για τον αναγνώστη και πολλές φορές μεσα απο τα λογια της αγγίζει και προσεγγίζει τις συνέπειες του αναποδραστου με κάθε δυνατό τρόπο!
Ο πόνος ωριμάζει τον άνθρωπο- τιποτα δεν ειναι δεδομένο-αν υπάρχει το "πάντα" υπάρχει και το ποτέ" ειναι μερικά απο τα μηνύματα που εκλαμβάνουμε και καταλήγουμε φυσικά πως μεσα απο τα λάθη πληρώνουμε,μαθαίνουμε,γινόμαστε καλύτεροι, αλλα ο πόνος και ο χρόνος οι καλύτεροι δάσκαλοι μας φωνάζουν πως η ζωη συνεχίζεται!
I really enjoyed this book.
I wish it had existed when I was a teenager.
This is a coming of age story that had all the grit of reality with some exciting mystery thrown in.
It dealt with difficult themes that many teenagers have to face either in themselves or in their peers.
There was enough mystery of ruined castles and glimpses of strange shadows and family secrets to keep anyone hooked.
There are many aspects to the story that make you go ah-hah when the pieces start to fall together and I love moments like that.
The book is funny, it's sad, and overall it's charming.

Η πλοκή σαν ιδέα ήταν ενδιαφέρουσα και η γραφή της Cecelia Ahern είναι αρκετά καλή (όχι τέλεια, αλλά καλή), αλλά η ιστορία κυλούσε βασανιστικά αργά.
Tamara chances upon this mysterious book that shows entries for the following day in her own handwriting- and what's more, things start happening exactly the way they were written in the diary.
What happens next-whether Tamara would be able to save herself and her depressed mother from being forever stuck in a house where they are apparently not very welcome and how the diary helps/not helps her- forms the crux of the story.Characters, plot line, writing, this book satisfied me in every possible way.
Rating: 3/5 ||  Recenzia pe Secretele Cărților Înainte să mă apuc de această carte nu ştiam prea multe despre ea, coperta şi descrierea fiind singurele care mă atrăseseră într-un mod ciudat.M-am apucat de lecturat la scurt timp după ce am comandat-o pe elefant.ro la o promoţie şi am descoperit-o astfel pe Tamara, o tânără care pare să le aibă pe toate: haine de firmă, o casă luxoasă, o plajă privată. Însă viaţa ei ia o întorsătură neaşteptată când tatăl ei moare. Tamara şi mama ei merg să locuia
Fie că este vorba despre o zi normală, despre un băiat sau despre mama ei, Tamara este mereu curioasă să vadă ce are jurnalul de spus despre următoarea zi din viaţa ei.Cu toate acestea, jurnalul este doar o mică părticică care îşi joacă rolul în ceea ce Tamara are să afle despre ea, despre mama şi tatăl ei, despre Rosaleen şi Arthur, despre castelul Kilsaney aflat în apropiere.Mi se pare o carte interesantă însă nu este chiar ceea la ce mă aşteptam eu.
After thinking about this book for a bit I've decided on 3 stars, not 4.
This book could not decide what it wanted to be.
Okay, maybe not so dark but definitely gothic-a crumbling castle, mysterious people living in little cottages, to say more would be to step into spoiler territory but you get the point.
Where did he hide while people were investigating things?
(hide spoiler)]I realized something about myself while reading this book-I will happily suspend disbelief for something magical, fantastical, mythical, etc-that doesn't bother me at all.
Leider konnte mich dieses Buch überhaupt nicht begeistern. Die Charaktere waren eindimensional, die Erzählweise langatmig und langweilig, ständige Wiederholungen bremsten den Fortlauf der Geschichte zusätzlich.Ich habe es nach circa 100 Seiten abgebrochen.
What We Have Learned Today. This is the last chapter of the book & I find it quite amusing. I love it. I like the part when Tamara said "Maybe some day when I'm in trouble again I'll dig it up & see what it has to say. But in the meantime, I'll have to find my own way.
I did enjoy The Gift but it didn't make enough impression on me to put Cecelia Ahern at the top of my favourite authors list and so I did not rush out to find any of her other books.
I thought I would give it a try as it sounded like my kind of book and it wasn't until I got home and started to read that I noticed from the inside of the cover that it was by an author I had already read.
I wouldn't say that this book was a light read as there is alot going on in the storyline which meant that you couldn't leave the book half way through a chapter.
And it was good!I've tried to read Ahern's books before.
Still, I could tell that Ahern was a very good writer, and I kept giving her books a chance because I knew that one of them would work for me eventually.This one was it.It's the story of Tamara Goodwin, a very self centered sixteen-year-old.
Suddenly able to know the consequences of her actions, Tamara finds herself adapting and changing her future .
Considering the age of the narrator, I'd think this book should be shelved in YA, but most bookstores shelf it with Ahern's other fiction for adults.
4 1/2 starsWhat a strangely compelling story this was.I was not crazy about this novel when I first started reading it.
"The tree trunks were fascinating, aged and wrinkled like elephants’ legs.
I tripped often on a raised root, and was caught each time by a helpfully placed tree trunk.
This was not at all what I was looking for.I picked up the novel again today while I was having lunch… and that’s when the story took off.
I have to say that the book was somewhat unevenly written, but when the story got good, it became captivating reading.
I don't know whether I'll read another, but by god this book was good.
Maybe pick it up one day and read through the pages once again.I loved it.
I loved how the characters kept surprising me.
There was just enough clues to piece some parts together so you feel smarter than the heroine but not enough to work out what the hell was going to happen.I loved how Tamara grew.
Sometimes I just wanted to put the novel away because I didn't know if I could handle what was coming, but I couldn't stop reading.
God, it was so good.
It was an interesting book overall but I have some questions left unanswered and the twist that was introduced didn't really answer the most important question I had in my mind. Why book why. But I would still recommend as this is a book about a girl whose life changes after she is faced with a tragedy. I love these kind of books where characters grow to be more mature in the midst of adversities.
4.5 stars. I actually had read this book before, but couldn't remember what happened. Ridiculous memory of mine, as the book was fantastic, very different and pretty dark for Cecelia Ahern. Read it!
A beautiful fantasy escapade filled with a dash of mystery and love intertwined.
I really didn't want this book to end, I enjoyed every second spent reading it. here is my favorite quote from the book :" I've heard people say that when they dream about a loved one that has died, they feel that it's real, that the person is really there, sending them a message, giving them a hug. That somehow dreams are a blurred line between here and there, like a meeting room in a prison. You're both in the same room, yet on different sides and really, in different worlds. " 🌻
The first time was after reading about a quarter of the book.
However, just as I decided to give up, the plot had edged it's way to a point where it appeared to be moving forward at a decent pace, so I decided to keep reading.
However, although the plot did eventually get moving, some aspects were handled in such a naive way that I checked the publisher.
I thought again about abandoning it, but by this time the ending seemed pretty obvious (although in my opinion, far fetched) and it wouldn't take long to read to the end, so I decided to finish it.
Много мъдра Сесилия Ахърн в тази книга.Необичайно за толкова млад човек.Талантът си е талант. Едновременно магична и земна. С чувство за хумор и много самоирония.Всяка нейна книга разкрива различна страна от таланта й."Понякога , ако се окажеш изхвърлен , могат да последват големи неща. Можеш да израснеш."
Loved this one. The lead character was annoying at first, but you grow to understand her gradually. The mystery part was thrilling and interesting, kept me reading till the very last page. Plus, the cover is beautiful.
Prachtig boek. Moest er wel inkomen. Een recensie volgt.
