(His ex-wife and the social service worker can’t understand why a potential viral outbreak might cause a CDC doctor to have to reschedule an appointment or two.) The opening set-up with a plane load of dead passengers has been used twice before that I know of in Nelson DeMille’s The Lion’s Game and Fringe in its pilot episode.So the story seemed overly familiar in a lot of ways, and the writing isn’t especially great, but it’s got a lot of momentum and is loaded with enough gore and ultra-violence to make vampires nasty again.
It's a taught, intense, compelling thriller that gradually introduces compelling characters that it's easy to care about.Then, in its middle third, it starts to wobble a little bit.
There were still enough interesting bits to keep me reading, but just past the halfway mark, I started to lose interest.In the final third, it completely collapses under the weight of lazy, hacky writing that moves from one set piece to the next, sloppily throwing in brief and unsatisfying character moments as an afterthought.So I'm of two minds on this: one, everything I stated above.
It was alright. I kinda got lost. Zero stars for the dogs!! And the milky stuff - ewwwww. I hate milk and this made me want to gag! I still have to fight gagging when watching the first Alien for the millionth time 😂Happy Halloween 🎃Mel 🖤🐺🐾
This is a terrible book.
We had the Wise Old Guy, the Street-Smart Shitkicker, The Brain, and The Chick.
The whole book reads as though somebody figured out how to do Novel-By-Numbers and made a bestseller out of it.
(i.e., book packager)So why three stars?
The fresh take on vampirism -- which I didn't think I would care about because I DON'T LIKE VAMPIRE NOVELS -- was enough to keep me reading despite the wooden characterization and leaden prose.
And then somehow I started liking the damn thing.
Eventually I was just reading to enjoy every single character's death.
[This is sooo irrelevant,) but a good assessment of this reviewer's desperate mindset whilst reading the novel]) I REALLY had to do something about the overstimulated brain, to lull my senses significantly and inspire me to finally do something to chillax--so I got this from the library, deciding that del Toro seems to be one of the few to have something both legitimately novel and ancient to say about my favorite all time genre, that is to say, Horror.But the cliches pile up like bodies: this is what I mean by literotherapy.
So along comes a book co-authored by visionary Guillermo Del Toro, a favorite movie director of mine, that claims to turn the concept of the vampire story on to its head.
Abe hints at the end of the book that there's a lot about the vampires that the authors have been keeping him from saying.
The Strain might refer as much to the effort it takes to make it through these tedious scenes as it does the vampire virus.Other parts of the book are meant to inform the reader (city rats, the inner workings of the CDC, the lunar eclipse [HA HA!
This just isn't very good. After a promising and creepy opening, it devolves into repetitive ridiculousness. The writing is also just not good and sometimes laughable, providing such gems as this:"Eph too had been turned. Not from human to vampire, but from healer to slayer."I did somehow finish it. My wife did not. I'm sure del Toro will eventually make a movie out of this and it will be one of the rare occasions that the movie is better than the book.
Del Toro and friend - from Geek Nation The Strain is a fast, entertaining read, with a twist to the rationale for vampirism that is fun, if a bit derivative.
The New York setting brings together hints of 9/11 with the sort of I Am Legend scenario of one or a few real humans holding off the vampiric hordes.
They head to the appropriate underworld of the New York infrastructure and counterpoint a bit with the skyscraper home of a prime baddie.
ReallyCorey Stoll at Ephrain Goodweather- From IGNI enjoyed the vampire mechanism explanation, but I felt a strong compulsion not to look too closely.
I am not a "vampire" book reader in general meaning I do not buy every new vampire story that comes out.
For me, what makes a great vampire novel is when you can create a completely original (or mostly original) take on the very well known Vampire mythos.
Examples of well done, original vampire stories (IMHO) include: (1) Carrion Comfort by Dan Simmons (2)Agyar by Steven Brust and (3) the Lestat novels by Anne Rice (yes these have been much imitated since they first came out and are likely responsible for the myriad of vampire novels out today but at the time they were "ground breaking" and created a whole new Vampire Mythos).
If you have found yourself reading vampire fiction and thought, "You know what this needs?
Ah, that's better.This book reads like a disaster movie where it is following the story of a few different characters as this vampire "virus" starts spreading.
Usually.It also reads like a total guys book.
That was where you found me skimming.If I want to learn about airplanes, I'll google it like a sane person.So, our main hero is a guy who works for the CDC and is called in when the airplane of dead things arrives.
Joining us for a few minutes on the airwaves today are two men that have transformed the vampire world: let’s welcome Chuck Logan and Guillermo Del Toro.
Me: Well said, sir.GDT: And the story needed to be revamped…(chuckles to himself)…vampires are mean and nasty and smelly and don’t want to date.
You see, like rats, humans have become a plague on this planet.
Down the hall and on the left.(Guillermo Del Toro leaves the room.)Me: Okay, Chuck, do you mind if I call you Chuck?
Let him storyboard the hell out of it, I’d like to see that movie, but you need to be the one dictating the novels.

As I slowly started getting drawn into the story, I realized that it was ages since I'd last read a good horror tale.
He is helped by Abraham Setrakian, a former professor and Holocaust survivor, who is the only person who knows how to fight the evil force.The story reads like a CSI, and I was amazed at how CREDIBLE it sounded.

Lots of tell, little show, there is no sense of care or realism with the paper people.I watched an episode of the TV show, which worked because they made the characters come alive, but also because this story isn't done in TV show format much.
Since it’s not done to death, it works for watching – but in book form, the story has been sucked dry, so it needs other redeeming qualities to keep people returning for more.For the TV media it was new and inventive.
To stay fresh and intriguing, this book at least needed fleshed-out characters I cared about.
This series was very problematic, in my opinion. Please read the full review for the series here on my blog. Book one was the only book truly worth the attention.  Like I said, it started out quite original, like any catastrophy or epidemic story, and I have to say, it was very cinematic! No wonder, it's co-written by Guillermo del Toro.  The book reads pretty much like a show – in scenes.  Most things are indeed tell, and not show, which put you in the middle of the action. The tension is very

The book reads pretty much like a show – in scenes.
The tension is very strong, and it's built up so well with all the infuriating interludes that are not in the same timeline, that you're simply on the edge, like in a psychological thriller movie.It's also a very interesting take on vampires.
It might be that the thriller reader and watcher expects this from a book and it might work for them, but I felt like they were unnecessary scenes that brought nothing extra to the story.Read Post On My Blog | My Bookstagram | Bookish Twitter
I liked that this book had a realistic baseline, and felt like it could truly happen.
I mostly didn't have any trouble liking or caring about these characters, so the little inconsistencies didn't become issues for me.
It had a sort of "For Everyday Use" feel, but then some parts were written in such a way as to just feel like they were more.
For instance, this line: "Like smoke rising up a chimney, we must force him to the roof." This, in the middle of a vampire vs human battle...
I just feel like the first part of the line makes it awkward and takes me out of the story.
Besides, I believe Anne Rice started the trend with Interview with the Vampire, to her credit she told her story in a more thoughtful, literary and intelligent manner than Ms. Meyer (of no-link-to-author fame).Artwork for the graphic novel editionAnyway, back to badass vampires and the fun times to be had with them.
The book is fun but I am somewhat ambivalent about reading the rest of the trilogy, something is missing here, may be a staked heart.Vampire Homer_______________________Notes:• The Passage by Justin Cronin is a similar bio-vampire book, also a commercially successful series, and also being adapted for TV.
It’s the second one and this part of the book is so very creepy!There was something on that plane that is now wreaking havoc on the family members of the extremely unlucky passengers aboard the plane – and on society at large.This story is basically pandemic via vampiric strain and focuses a lot of time on the rush for experts to discover exactly what the hell is going on and how to stop it before everyone dies a horrid death or worse.
And it definitely was scary!Story:The vampires in this book were both disgusting and fearsome.
Books like this make me glad for the light of the sun, which is what a good vampire novel should do.
He's one tough old guy, and he's definitely my favorite character in this novel.
I think Abraham is a much more powerful, and iconic character.
I know this is a three-part book, so I guess I will have to keep reading to see where things go.
I think that work on the characters and the plot would have made it a stronger read over all.
Then, inside the cover of the paperback edition, are five –yes, five– pages of reviews going on, and on, and ON, about how fantastic The Strain is, how it’s a masterpiece that has redefined the vampire myth, how it’s “an unholy spawn of I Am Legend out of Salem’s Lot” –at this point, I started to gag a little bit.Can you say ‘misleading’?(view spoiler)[The only saving grace of this book is the characters Eph, Setrakian, Zach, and Fet (the Exterminator).
At first it’s a neat fact, by page 112 you just want to know what their bloody point is.
The two main talents that make King horror royalty are:One - Intense characterization - He can quickly introduce characters and within a page you feel you know them, you are rooting for them, and - when you turn the page - are devastated when they comes to a terrible end.
The authors of this book lack that ability, even after multiple visits to a character you are emotionally unattached.
King can make anything scary: cars, clowns, your pet dog, visiting the bathroom, anything.
But I'll never know because I am done with this series.bottom line: I don't always read horror, but when I do, I expect it to be good.
In fact, the book is so, so...so just bad that I came away with a new appreciation for Stephenie Meyer's poorly written Twilight saga.
One of my biggest gripes about Meyer's writing is that she always shied away from a fight, especially in what was supposed to be a climactic last book (see my review on this point here).
I skipped several pages in the final battle scene because I grew so weary of the predictable action and -- like Seinfeld's Elaine -- just "wanted it to end." 3 - Depends on plot points that are purely driven by the author's needs, not those of the characters.
This was good, really good I have the sequel waiting at home for me and can't wait to start.There are a lot of characters so it did take time for me get everyone straight.For whatever reason everytime Gus come around I was like "who the Hell is Gus" and had to sort of go back and get reaquainted with him.
It is not a stress I need in my life right now but I will be working on it hopefully by the time I finish the second book I will have a revised escape plan that ensures the safety of my son and our gigantic dog
Ταυτόχρονα με την ολοκλήρωση του τετάρτου και τελευταίου κύκλου της τηλεοπτικής σειράς The Strain, είπα να διαβάσω (επιτέλους) και τα αντίστοιχα τρία βιβλία των Guillermo Del Toro – Chuck Hogan (Το Ίχνος, η Πτώση, η Αιώνια Νύχτα), τα οποία ήδη από τις αρχές Δεκέμβρη περίμεναν υπομονετικά στη βιβλιοθήκη μου.
Πράγμα που σημαίνει ότι η τηλεοπτική απεικόνιση των στριγκόι, για παράδειγμα, ή της υπόφυσης που αναπτύσσεται κάτω από τη γλώσσα τους, είναι αυτή ακριβώς που είχε στο μυαλό του ο συγγραφέας.
(hide spoiler)]I was pretty sure this one would be a 5 star read for a good while...but the main character is written in such a frustrating way (for me any way) that I had to drop it.
You'll pretty much have to read the book and see what I mean as should I go into it it would be a major spoiler and reveal most of what you're finding out through the book.
(hide spoiler)]Okay anyway whether you read the spoiler or not, on the whole I really do like this book and am hooked on the story...really.
(view spoiler)[ I am currently ignoring the whole end-bit where suddenly 6 other master vampires exist who are masterminding something and there are some sort of vampire rules and blah blah blah general yuck  (hide spoiler)].It reads like  'Salem's Lot  in the sense of random-ish collection of evil-fighters aligning against ancient evil.
We get a ton of creepy fun time, just like in  'Salem's Lot , including  bad things that happen when you are outside as well as when you are inside !

A thrilling story of a race against time for the human populace as a virus strain like no other before has landed in the USA and the living become turned, the scary part is they head home and come after their loved ones first. There is a master of the dark set to dominate the underworld of the vampires that leads the story on to next novel. A action packed race against the spread of vampires, forces of good and evil, survival and death, would make a good movie.For interview and trailers click link http://more2read.com/?review=the-stra...
On my very long list of genres I'll read, on the very bottom are vampires.
What I did really like was that del Toro gave a reason behind the vampires.
He filled in the blanks on what made the vampires what they are.
Otherwise it's just a bunch of people and vampires trying to kill each other and that doesn't make for much of a story in my opinion.I can see where this would make a good movie.
If you love vampire stories, then I recommend you try this one.
Good but not much new here.
I've read this book 3 times.My Plot Synopsis: A plane arrives at JFK airport in New York City – after landing, before it reaches the terminal, it stops in the middle of the runway and completely shuts down.
As of the posting of this particular review (you can read my very first review from 2009 on the Amazon site), I have read this book three times and it just keeps getting better – even though I typically am a fan of vampires, I can still appreciate a good story, even if they are the villains of the piece.
