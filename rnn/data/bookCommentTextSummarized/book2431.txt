در ادامه کتاب اول به همان سبک و سیاق و همان دفاع از کمونیسم و سیاست اشتراکی کردن. در برخی از فصل ها بیش از اندازه و خارج از حوصله روایت بی جهت ادامه پیدا میکند.‏
After that, we hear almost nothing of Polotsev or his Polish associate until nearly the end of the book.The bulk of the novel after that is 95% boring, padded, and inane Grandpa Schukar stories.
The worst example is when the neighboring town's collective farm steals hay from Gremachy Log. Davidov talks to their party chairman, who ends up being a shifty guy.
The plot thread dies; the theft is never spoken of again; we never hear of the shifty neighboring party chairman.Then in the last 50 or so pages the Polotsev conspiracy thing is quickly wrapped up.
It might not just be a commissioned work of propaganda, but there is something clownish about Mikhail Sholokhovs account of collectivization, which makes it hard to interpret in light of the historical record.
Superb depiction. All should know what had actually happened during collectivisation days in Soviet Union.
I love this novel!
This is the world best navel and thanks to wrote to mikhail sholokov :)
The Cossack farmers in the south of Russia have communism thrust upon them. Good characters and I feel it is a good insight into the time.
