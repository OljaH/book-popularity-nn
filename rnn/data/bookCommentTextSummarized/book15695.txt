And the literary references become more subtle and complex.I won’t say much about the plot because first, it’s been expertly summarized in other reviews; second, if you’re familiar with the series you don’t need me to, and if you’re not, you should start with the first book, not the 11th; and third, I still have a bad headache from this lousy month-long cold, and summarizing sounds suspiciously like work.
It’s too painful – and to be fair, it feels too cruel – to acknowledge that the lost loved one was, say, sometimes irritable and occasionally unkind, or had a habit of grabbing the first and the best for themselves.My niece didn’t have time to be anything but an infant, of course.
I continue my relentless 3*ing of the series, though this volume was significantly better than the previous one (The Slippery Slope).Much of the action takes place on submarines.
although I do feel a book should offer some consistent vision that can actually be processed in the readers' heads.Anyhoo - the primary characters offered this time (Captain Widdershins and his daughter Fiona, plus Olaaf, Esme and Carmalita Spats) are enjoyable / funny.We see the good vs evil blurring continue, with good people turning bad, or at least less good and bad people turning good or at least less bad.
The Baudelaires discover that the crew of the Queequeg are searching for the mysterious sugar bowl.
ویولت و کلاوس و سانی در آب‌های رود استریکن سوار یک زیر دریایی به نام کوییکگ می‌شوند که در آنجا با فردی به نام کاپیتان ویدرشینز و دختر خوانده اش فیونا ملاقات می‌کنند.
کاپیتان به آنها می‌گوید که به دنبال شکردان می‌گردند و کلاوس و فیونا با کمک هم میفهمند که شکردان در غار گورگونی است که قارچ سمی خطرناکی به نام مدوسویید میسلیوم در آن زندگی می‌کند.
همن موقع کنت الاف آنها را پیدا می‌کند و آنها میبینند که فیونا همدست الاف شده؛ ولی به آنها اجازه فرار می‌دهد و آنها به طرف برینی بیچ حرکت می‌کنند.
UPDATE: 19/Jan/2017I am getting sick of updating my reviews for all these books but for the last time I liked this book more that I did when I first read it.
1/Jan/2017As my first book of 2017, I can't say I'm disappointed as I wasn't expecting much.
I am so ready for this series to end because it has been going on for too long.
I wasn't that interested in this book because I've lost a lot of my interest in this series.
Also last year I only read these books to catch up on my reading challenge.
I gasped so loud on the last page that I woke up the hubby! Oh man, what a turn of events. I'm so proud of the Baudelaire orphans! Standing up to Mr. Poe like that, figuring out all the complicated riddles... so proud!! :)
Listened to this one on audio read by the amazing Tim Curry in a few hours and it made it a whole lot better.
I feel like this was a bit of a filler book but I still enjoyed it.
That twist with the hook-handed man was pretty cool and Count Olaf was just as fucked up as he always is.
I thought they weren’t for me because I’ve tried so many and my attention span is shit but this one worked pretty damn well.
Tomorrow I plan on listening to book 12!-	Richard :)
Uno de los mejores de la saga, o al menos uno de los que más me ha enganchado. Es increíble como después de once libros este señor sigue sorprendiéndome y dejándome con ganas de más. (y ya solo faltan dos libros para terminar)
These books are definitely starting to get more and more interesting :) I loved that we got some new characters in this one!
Some of them got on my nerves a little bit--like Captain Widdershins--the way he talked just aggravated me after a little while :/ (Others who have read this probably know what I'm talking about XD lol) But other than that, I liked this one a lot!
:) The way this book ended made me really want to pick up book #12 soon!
Hoping my library will have it in stock :D Kind of sad I only have two books left in the series :P
"People aren't either wicked or noble," the hook-handed man said. "They're like chef's salads, with good things and bad things chopped and mixed together in a vinaigrette of confusion and conflict."
3.75* ooh, that ending! I feel as though (or am at least hoping) we're going to be getting some answers soon...
This is definitely where the story starts to get really interesting.
We're introduced to so many new characters and so many new mysteries and secrets are revealed!
I think it's one of my favourite settings in the series as well, something about the submarines just really tickled my fancy!
This is also one of the books in the series that I've read the fewest times so the details were extremely fuzzy and it was almost like reading it for the first time again.
I really love this series to pieces and I'm quite sad that I'm coming to the end of my reread of them!
Best.beginning"A man of my acquaintance once wrote a poem called 'The Road Less Traveled' describing a journey he took along a path most travelers never used....and he was probably a bit nervous as he went along, because if anything happened on the road less traveled, the other travelers...couldn't hear him as he cried for help. Sure enough, that poet is now dead."
Two more!
Com certeza a série melhorou muuuuito nos último livros. Esse foi com bastante ação e informações importantes e NÃO ACREDITO QUE AQUELE PERSONAGEM APARECEU <3 <3 <3Ansiosa para terminar logo :D
Me pone contenta que me sigan sorprendiendo.Este libro siento que es la clave de la saga, recién acá empieza todo lo que queríamos saber desde el libro 1. Me gustaron muuuchas cosas, Lemony Snicket es brillante pero en este se pasó, sobretodo con el tema del ciclo.Pasaron muchas muchas cosas que me dejaron como Queeeeeee.Y el final estuvo increíble 👏🏻 4.5
I feel like this book was mostly filler. Far too many "Aye!"s and way too much annoying villainous laughter. Great ending though.Only two books to go. Don't you hurt my Baudelaires, Mr Snicket!
I was also happy to meet Phil again, the optimist from "The Miserable Mill", (view spoiler)[ even though his presence was very short in this book.
(hide spoiler)] The climax in this book was also very exciting and reminded me how much I care about the three orphans, (view spoiler)[ especially the scene were Sunny was nearly muffled was absolutely nerve-racking.
(hide spoiler)] Another great aspect of "The Grim Grotto" was that even Count Olaf´s minions who always used to be side-character´s are getting their own backstories with the time.
Overall, as I said, this was a very successful installment in the series and I am very excited for the next one.
4.5/5 “Rest here,” Sunny said, curling up at the foot of the stove.“Will you really be comfortable on the kitchen floor?” Klaus asked.Sunny opened one exhausted eye and smiled at her siblings. “Near you,” she said.
"How can someone so wonderful do something so terrible?" That ending!!!! What?! I cannot wait to get my hands on the next book. Only two left and I think we're finally going to get some answers. The Grim Grotto is action packed. The Baudelaire's find themselves on a submarine then in a grotto with poisonous mushrooms only to be left wondering what to do next and who to trust.

What can I say about these books??
For me they're so much more than children's books.
Sure a child will probably enjoy them but I think you have to be older to fully appreciate the cleverness of these books and the genius that Lemony Snicket is.
I think he's one of my favorite authors because he's clever, he's intriguing and mainly because he's sarcastic.
One of my favorite parts of his books are the little poems he writes for Beatrice and of course his failed attempt to make us not read his books.
Amazing series for both young and older readers.
I really enjoyed this one. I think I am tied for this one and book 6 for my favourite! I just can't wait to be done this series.. my goal is to finish it before the clock strikes 12 on Thursday.
I am loving this series. I really want to find out more about Beatrice and the backstory of everything.
The Grotto was mostly Grim.
In the eleventh book in “A Series of Unfortunate Events”, we find the three young Baudelaire siblings in a grim bit of trouble, escaping from the nefarious Count Olaf by riding a toboggan down the Stricken Stream, hoping to find a sugar bowl before he does.The Baudelaire siblings don’t know what is so important about the sugar bowl, only that it may mean the end of their troubles.Unsure how to get out of the Stricken Stream without drowning, the three siblings contemplate their fate.
They must also find the sugar bowl before Count Olaf, otherwise, the trouble has only begun….From start to finish, I loved this book.
Mini Review: Not my favorite, because I do think this one dragged a bit at times, but I think it was better than a lot of the earlier ones. So close to finishing the series, excited to see how the last two play out!
4,75honestly the best one in the series so far
Snicket’s tone throughout is apologetic, sincere and matter-of-fact as he relates the unfortunate events in the children’s lives; his imaginative and even surreptitiously educational style will hold much appeal for younger readers, as will the persistent silliness of adults.
As always, the alliterative titles are delightful and Brett Helquist provides some wonderfully evocative illustrations.This instalment sees the Baudelaires donning undersea suits, doing their best to avoid a deadly fungus, being captured (again!) by Count Olaf, repairing a porthole, and finally washing up on the Briny Beach, the place where the whole unfortunate tale began.
3.5 stars! // I enjoy this series so much that I wish I'd read it as a child. That would have been so much fun. I still really enjoy them now as an adult - and one of the things I love the most about it is the authors writing and humor. So incredibly good. I am getting really close to the end of the series now, and even though I don't want it to end, I really feel like it's time to get some more answers - and I'm really looking forward to that!
We're so close to the end of the series, so it makes sense that all the pieces are falling together. The Grim Grotto leaves the reader on the edge of their seats wondering if the Baudelaires will find the sugar bowl or if Sunny will survive being poisoned by a deadly mushroom. Just two more books, which I do not remember, so it'll all be new and exciting to me.
Such a good addition to the series! This cover is my favrouite
