I feel full of the joys of spring! This was such a delightful little book. My morbid, inner kid couldn't have been more ecstatic! Should I call someone a twit or a nitwit? I guess, no. That would be very rude of me! My doppelgänger would approve otherwise. And since I'm not like my sinister doppelgänger, I would leave all the sheer nastiness to him along with Mr. and Mrs. Twit, who are also quite repulsive, if you ask me. I'd rather have pleasant thoughts rather than wicked ones. "If a person ha
And since I'm not like my sinister doppelgänger, I would leave all the sheer nastiness to him along with Mr. and Mrs. Twit, who are also quite repulsive, if you ask me.
"If a person has ugly thoughts, it begins to show on the face.
You can have a wonky nose and a crooked mouth and a double chin and stick-out teeth, but if you have good thoughts they will shine out of your face like sunbeams and you will always look lovely."
Just look at Mrs. Twit's glass eye, which in reality you might call lazy eye or amblyopia.
Unfortunately, I don't have any rose-tinted glasses for this one. So, as an adult, all I could think of is, "Dahl, what were you on??" Mr. Twit was a twit. He was born a twit. And, now at the age of sixty, he was a bigger twit than ever. The Twits are ugly people - through and through. They think nothing of animal neglect or outright abuse. They are horrible to each other and everyone around them. They own a troop of trained monkeys and take particular delight in forcing the poor animals into do
So, as an adult, all I could think of is, "Dahl, what were you on??"
He was born a twit.
And, now at the age of sixty, he was a bigger twit than ever.
The Twits are ugly people - through and through.
They think nothing of animal neglect or outright abuse.
They own a troop of trained monkeys and take particular delight in forcing the poor animals into doing difficult (and painful) tricks.
So, when he really wanted to convey just how disgusting the Twits were, he would throw in details like this:
“If a person has ugly thoughts, it begins to show on the face.
You can have a wonky nose and a crooked mouth and a double chin and stick-out teeth, but if you have good thoughts it will shine out of your face like sunbeams and you will always look lovely.” I do love this quote.
They are vile and small, silly little people that enjoy inflicting pain on others for no reason other than their own amusement.So in typical Roald Dahl fashion they get exactly what is coming to them.
ENGLISH (The Twits)/ ITALIANO«What a lot of hairy-faced men there are around nowadays»Ugly, dirty and bad.
It's not about the movie of Ettore Scola about the slums, with Nino Manfredi as memorable protagonist.
Mr Twits, moreover, has his own dreams: training monkeys to carry out acts upside down.
In short, the Twits are evil.But revenge comes as a judgment.Vote: 7.5«Quanti uomini con la faccia pelosa ci sono in giro al giorno d'oggi»Brutti, sporchi e cattivi.
Non si tratta del film di Ettore Scola sulle baraccopoli, con Nino Manfredi memorabile protagonista.
Si tratta invece dei disgustosi signori Sporcelli, che passano le loro giornate a farsi scherzi tremendi, di una crudeltà ingiustificata.
Twits are ugly people who do horrible things to each other and others.
On Monday I was going to write a review that just said that I'm a twit.
Which isn't really true, I'm generally a only a slightly negative person, bordering on neutral and I don't do things intentionally to try to cause other people harm.
I generally don't write reviews, I write opinion pieces and rants peppered with confessionals from my life.
Sometimes I write very critical things, and I guess they might be considered a review, but really they are just throwing venom and spite at a target that won't swing back.
I originally read this book in either elementary school or middle school and really enjoyed it.
Since I am reading all of Roald Dahl's books again, I thought "why not," and re-read this one.
Surprisingly, I don't remember this story at all.
This book is about the grossest couple: Mr. and Mrs. Twit.
They hate everything!
They catch innocent birds to put in their Bird Pies and make their monkeys stand on their heads all day.
Thankfully the birds and monkeys have had enough and they fight back!
This is a super cute and short story :)
If a person has ugly thoughts, it begins to show on the face.
And when that person has ugly thoughts every day, every week, every year, the face gets uglier and uglier until you can hardly bear to look at it.A person who has good thoughts cannot ever be ugly.
You can have a wonky nose and a crooked mouth and a double chin and stick-out teeth, but if you have good thoughts it will shine out of your face like sunbeams and you will always look lovely.This quote is one of the biggest reasons why I gave this book 5 stars.

When Mrs Twit isn't serving Mr Twit a bowl of worms or hiding her glass eye in his after-supper beer, and when Mr Twit isn't playing a fucked-up mind game on Mrs Twit - such as carving away an inch of his wife's cane, day by day, so that he can trick her into thinking she is slowly but surely shrinking - the two put their loathsome heads together to terrorize monkeys, butcher birds, and even try their hand at eating little boys.
The Twits is a sound reminder that the world is full of mostly awful people who will do mostly awful things to other people, like you for instance little boy and/or girl.
An allegory on post-Communist Götterdämmerung qua Joseph Stalin or an attack on hairy-faced men?or We can only speculate.
The Twits was one of those.The Twits, although it has its moments, is one of my least favourite Dahl books, perhaps the least favourite.It's easy to be too po-faced about humour in children's books, and perhaps my reaction is coloured by the knowledge that Dahl was not a particularly pleasant man and had some rather nasty opinions ...
The idea that someone who looks ugly to us is ugly inside too is sufficient reason on its own to cast this book aside.Moving on.The rest of the book comprises two unpleasant people being unpleasant to each other in not particularly humorous ways, followed by the addition of monkeys and a magical bird who then outwit them in a rather unconvincing manner.I really was not taken with the story, but it wasn't terrible.
My birds and I got into a big literary debate this morning.
The book was Dahl's The Twits.
Lester the Molestor maintains that I would be more delicious in a pie.
My vote is for a hearty bird pie.
You are what you eat.
Who would want to be me?
There is a big hungry gator waiting for us to decide.
It was Lester's fault!
He doesn't know enough Q words....I'm scared.I swear to myself (and on a stack of bibles) that I had already reviewed The Twits.
Maybe I dreamed writing it....
I didn't write this either.
One of my favourite books.A lil gruesome but so funny. A sheer delight to read.Such a memorable book. I will treasure.
If a person has ugly thoughts, it begins to show on the face. And when that person has ugly thoughts every day, every week, every year, the face gets uglier and uglier until you can hardly bear to look at it.A person who has good thoughts cannot ever be ugly. You can have a wonky nose and a crooked mouth and a double chin and stick-out teeth, but if you have good thoughts it will shine out of your face like sunbeams and you will always look lovely.-The Twits, Roald Dahl
This story pulls the reader to the edge, injecting silliness, fear, and all-around revenge into a larger plot that will have children giggling and washing their faces in short order.
Dahl is able to dazzle the reader with his array of spooky adult characters (another usual trait for Dahl books in that adults are most often evil or oppressive to the child in the story) and their antics to bestow revenge or pain on others.
Dahl weaves the story from the early exploration of the Twits to the ultimate battle between good and evil (in this case fauna versus Twit) and there is little hope that it will end peacefully.
پنجاه دقیقه ی شیرین رو صرف گوش کردن به کتاب صوتی عالی این کتاب کردم.
با تقلید صداهای عالی ای که نمی تونید لذت نبریدرولد دال این بار منزجر کننده ترین زوج تمام کتاب هاش رو بهمون معرفی می کنه.
برای مثال وقتی که یک موجود بسیار زشت رو توصیف میکنه، توضیح میده این فرد چون از درون زیبایی نداره زشت به نظر میادنکته دیگه اینکه رد پای علاقه زیادش به حیوانات و آفریقا رو در خیلی از آثارش می شه پیدا کرد که برای مردی که روزی در آفریقا از ماشین پیاده می شده تا به زرافه ها سلام کنه اصلاً عجیب نیست 96.10.8
When a man grows hair all over his face it is impossible to tell what he really looks like.
But they did it before it was cool.Mrs Twit is an old hag and they deserve each other.
I seriously know couples who are just a hair's breadth away from Mr and Mrs Twit.
Cutting satire in the children's section.
There's all the things that a 10 year old should know how to do including putting frogs in people's beds and other nasty tricks.
This book could also be renamed "A Children's Primer on Gaslighting".
It's where I first learnt about it in Grade 4.Read this again people.
Müthiş komik bir kitap. Çocuk edebiyatı böyle bir şey olmalı işte; çılgın, deli dolu ve fütursuz :)
I loved it and yet I think there’s more to this story than just meets the eyes (the bearded face descriptions, cruelty and its relation to ugliness, standing on head instead of feet and then shrinking looks like social or even political(?) criticism to me!).“A person who has good thoughts cannot ever be ugly.
You can have a wonky nose and a crooked mouth and a double chin and stick-out teeth, but if you have good thoughts they will shine out of your face like sunbeams and you will always look lovely.”

I first read this story in elementary school and I love it just as much now as I did back then. Dahl’s writing is just timeless, it stays with you no matter your age! Something about this particular story just really makes me laugh. I think it’s seeing the Twits tricks turned around and used on them and their hilarious reactions to it that just really get to me!
Archer and I love this book! It's funny and evil and typical Dahl, it's fun to read out loud (or to yourself if you're not reading to a child) and there's an unrealized circus act full of upside-down monkeys.
Ik heb het voorgelezen aan mijn zoon van 7 jaar. Tijdens het lezen werd hij een x huilend wakker, omdat hij de griezels zo gemeen vond dat ze beesten sloegen en hij houdt zo van beesten. Dat ze aan het einde teruggepakt werden maakte het dan wel weer goed! Heerlijk boek om voor te lezen of zelf te lezen!
Quite funny and entertaining, not as good as The BFG or Matilda though.I kind of loved Mr and Mrs Twit, despite them being horrible to everyone. I thought the nasty tricks they played on each other and names they called each other were actually kind of cute, they both were just so well suited each other (unlike most fictional couples). They might just be my OTP.
This book was a major laugh riot. Especially now with beards being a big thing.
ظاهرت زشت نخواهد بود مگر این که اعمال و افکارت زشت باشندو ظاهرت دوست داشتنی و زیبا نخواهد شد مگر این که قلب زیبایی داشته باشیشاید همه ی پیام نویسنده لابلای ماجراهای آقا و خانم توییت همین بودواقعن درآوردن همچین داستان مفرح و جالبی واسه ژانر کودک و نوجوان با دو تا شخصیت اصلی بدجنس و زشت و چندش آور کلی مهارت و نبوغ میخواد
Quick buddy read with my eldest daughter haha. Great book and I think I laughed more than my daughter did, I'm such a big kid :)
It's been years since I read this book, but it was just as I remembered it: delightfully wicked, uproariously funny, and a little sad.Mr and Mrs Twit are two very ugly people, whose ugliness reflects the ugliness of their hearts.
- which quickly became a family favourite and still gets quoted at opportune times - so the Twits seemed like harmless fun to me).A note on this edition: Dahl's books are usually published by Puffin, the children's imprint of Penguin, and they do a fine job.
A person who has good thoughts cannot ever be ugly. You can have a wonky nose and a crooked mouth and a double chin and stick-out teeth, but if you have good thoughts they will shine out of your face like sunbeams and you will always look lovely.  Όταν κάνω μια καλή σκέψη ή καλή πράξη, ομορφαίνωΥ.Γ Η πένα του Νταλ παραμένει σκοτεινή, ακόμη και όταν γράφει βιβλία για παιδιά. (Μάλλον θα φταίει το μελάνι 🙃)
A pesar de que tanto Matilda como Charlie me acompañaron en la niñez, ya de adulta he sido consciente de la ausencia del resto de títulos de Dahl en mi estantería. Claro está, eso había que remediarlo, así que he decidido empezar por 'Los Cretinos' (leído en un viaje de ida y vuelta en el metro). ¿Conclusión? Muy recomendable, independientemente de la edad. No se me ha borrado la sonrisa de la cara ni un segundo. Divertido, satírico y crítico como sólo Dahl sabe serlo.
