At the time, this was a considerable sum of money, and Mama desired to use it fulfill the American dream- buy a house, put her daughter through college, invest in her son's business plans.
Meanwhile, Walter Lee dreams of starting a chain of businesses and moving up in the world so that his children could have a brighter future than the life he and has parents have lived.
The tensions had be captivated to find out the denouement and must have been even more powerful on stage, with gifted actors as Esther Rolle as Mama and Sidney Poitier as Walter Lee. Yet, these words still are poignant when read in book form these 57 years later.
Ten stars, please. All the stars for Ms. Hansberry's haunting, revealing play. As fresh in 2018 as it was in 1958.
May just possibly be my all-time favorite American play*. The circuit is so taut, the story is so heartbreaking, life-altering and thought-provoking--I cannot wait to ever catch it live.At 29, Hansberry orchestrated something even Arthur Miller & Tennessee Williams wanted--a TRUE portrait of the American Family, how the roles are intertwined and dependent upon the others. The maestros don't come as close as she, I am inclined to think...*Well... a more modern work, "Angels in America" makes it sort of a tie.
First published in 1959, this play tells the story of a poor African-American family ruled by "mama" who has big plans to make a better life for her family, but must wait for "the check" and overcome a few obstacles along the way. (like her bitter and self-absorbed son Walter)Set in a small rundown roach-infested apartment on Chicago's south side, A RAISIN IN THE SUN brings to light issues of racism and segregation, but also family pride and forgiveness.Another surprisingly good play!
I mean that you had a home; that we kept you out of trouble till you was grown; that you don't have to ride to work on the back of nobody's streetcar — You my children — but how different we done become.ASAGAI: Then isn't there something wrong in a house — in a world — where all dreams, good or bad, must depend on the death of a man?MAMA: Child, when do you think is the time to love somebody the most?
What happens to a dream deferred?Does it dry uplike a raisin in the sun?Or fester like a sore--And then run?Does it stink like rotten meat?Or crust and sugar over--like a syrupy sweet?Maybe it just sagslike a heavy load.Or does it explode?I decided to assign this to my Honors American Lit class before I had even read it myself.
I'm so glad I did!
I really enjoyed the characters.
And while students get a kick out of lines like "Why you always wear them faggoty white shoes?" it also deals with some important ideas about material versus spiritual or transcendental goals, about self-identity, and what it is to be a man.
I was pleased and moved.
عن الظروف الاجتماعية للسود .. مشاكلهم و حياتهم في امريكا ..، مسرحية رائعة ادخلتنى الى عالمهم ..  و جعلتني اعايش آلامهم .. آمالهم .. طموحاتهم ..، كاتبة مرهفه و موهوبة فعلا انها تقدر توّصل كل دا ، و مترجمة موهوبة كمان و امينة على ما اتذكر :) ، لأنى قرأت الكتاب دا زمان من فترة طويلة الحقيقة
The decision to move became a desire to 'integrate' (rather than, as Mama says simply, 'to find the nicest house for the least amount of money for my family … Them houses they put up for colored in them areas way out always seem to cost twice as much.')The Younger family is part of the black majority, and the concerns dismissed as 'middle class' – buying a home and moving into 'white folks' neighborhoods' – are actually reflective of the essence of black people's striving and the will to defeat segregation, discrimination, and national oppression.
This will always be my favorite stage play
Since I wanted to teach English (and History) here**, I thought I better brush up on the local canon (no one seemed to notice or care that their institutionalised English canon was largely American, even though there are plenty of good Canadian works around - neglected, but hanging on all the same).If, like me, you aren't familiar with this play from the 50s, here's a quick run-down: set in Chicago in the small and dingy apartment of a black family, the play is about the dreams of these family members - Lena Younger ("Mama"), her son Walter and daughter Beneatha, Walter's wife Ruth and their young boy Travis - and their excitement and anticipation for a cheque of ten thousand dollars from the life insurance of Lena's husband.
[11th grade]Out of all of the books I had to read this year for school, this one was the least boring.
Hansberry's death from cancer at 34 just six years after the publication and first production of Raisin in the Sun was a real loss to both the literary and dramatic worlds.
Not everyone likes to read plays; I enjoy them.
Raisin is a snapshot of black urban life on the eve of the sixties, just before the civil rights movement.
And yet, we who know history can read the play as Monday morning quarterbacks and see the foreshadowing in changing hairstyles and generational disputes.
Three generations of Youngers share a two room flat in Chicago and struggle to maintain family, dignity, dreams, life and morality against often insurmountable odds.
I didn’t mean to complete this so quickly😬. I enjoyed this book the characters are believable and heartbreaking, well-realized human beings, and their struggles against prejudice and hardship are as meaningful now as they were back then. I would love to see the play live.
3/5 StarsWell, this play was pretty decent.
It was entertaining enough and all of that ...
and yet, I still don't like reading plays.
So while I appreciated how this took place in Chicago (so I could visualize everything that much better), and how I could relate to Beneatha and her struggle at becoming a doctor, when everyone was pushing her to become a nurse - because that's more of a "female" job - I lacked a connection with everything/anything else.So, overall, it was a good play.
But it's probably much better acted out, as opposed to being read.
A Raisin in the Sun was the first play written by a black woman to be produced on Broadway.

Hansberry was the first black playwright and the youngest ever American to win the award.
Weathervane Playhouse is putting on a production of this incredible show just down the street from my house, opening this weekend, and I'm running the sound board for a few shows.
It's really a testament to Ms Hansberry's incredible dialogue, because 95% of the time I was reading along with the script and unable to watch the actors onstage, but GOD.
What an incredible show.
Twice I found myself sitting there at the sound board with tears running down my face, because it just felt like these words were punching me in the stomach.
loved it. I really want to go see this play at the Harlem theatre.
so good!!!
This was a quick read and I loved every page! I'm interested in watching the original version of the play with Sidney Poitier, looks good!
A Raisin in the Sun details the story of a working-class family struggling to make ends meet.
The Youngers are then faced with a difficult decision that brings their colored heritage and the lives of their ancestors to the forefront.Although this book and Death of a Salesman have some similar themes, what makes A Raisin in the Sun much better is its dynamic dialogue and the conflicting desires of its characters.
I empathized a lot with Beneatha - the obstacles she overcame in such a racist, cruel community to express herself and find her dreams spoke to me.
I honestly think this was a very bad choice by Ms. E.
The characters were imbeciles, just because they get some money doesn't mean that they go and spend it all on a house right away.
This book was horrific, making me want to tear my eyes out of my head so that I would not have to continue to read this waste of ink, being a disgrace to all plays ever written.
A character can not get any dumber than this.
But, she just makes her heritage and herself look bad.
This book is an absolute disgrace.
I am extremely upset that I ever had to even read this book.
What has happened to make me change my opinion so greatly?...Perhaps the fact is that I am now older and thus, better able to appreciate/absorb/understand this play more so than I did whilst reading it over a decade ago.
OR, perhaps the difference in my opinion lays in the fact that this time, I *chose* to (re)read this title, instead of *having to read it* for a class.
It is not only a great STORY in general, but as you're reading, you can SEE how it would be a great PLAY, as well.
From BBC Radio 3 - Drama on 3:This ground-breaking play, set on Chicago's South Side in the 1950's, revolves around the divergent dreams and conflicts within three generations of an Afro-American working-class family.

Lorraine Hansberry's A Raisin in the Sun is very deservedly considered a timeless classic.
Unlike many other works from around the same era, Hansberry provokes and moves her audience without writing of complete devastation.
It is timeless because of Hansberry's presentation of the familial interaction of the characters.
The characters' interaction shows that no one can lift you up, tear you down, pleasantly surprise you, disappoint you, make you laugh, make you cry, truly love you, or truly hurt you quite as powerfully as your family can.
I love the wit that I never really noticed Hansberry wrote into these characters.
Amiri Baraka really pointed this out in a new version of the book, that Lena Younger as the family matriarch doesn't merely represent black conservatism.
Lena is a rebel in her own right and this recognition and complication of her as a character for me really brings to light how delicately and deliberately Hansberry wrote her characters.
All these years after reading it, I've never loved so deeply a play...and I also don't think there is a play that quite encapsulates the spirit of urbanized Black Americans like this one does.
Great play. Great film. Everyone should read it...you can't say you truly love literature if you haven't read this one.
4.25 Stars
An absolute favorite. Captivating with so much heart. Hansberry was a genius.
