Unsworth goes for authenticity of tone which unfortunately often creates a rather leaden feel, most damningly represented by the journal the doctor on the slave ship writes.
In fact, I was more attracted to the baddie, Erasmus, without question the best character in the novel.
On the good side, Unsworth clearly wrote this novel with lots of love (this actually becomes a problem because it causes him to get carried away with all his minor characters who might be vivid to him but were often vague to me because there were so many of them and all with similar names).
It was magnificent the first time I read it all those years ago when it shared the Booker prize with The English Patient, and it retains its magnificence now.
A re-read is always a new experience: this time round I knew exactly where we were going so my attention was better directed on how we were getting there.
Even more wondrous is the way that the whole action is entirely grounded in character, and not a single false note among those myriad lives.
The slave trade is a perfect model for that kind of total devotion to the profit motive without reckoning the human consequences.
Barry Unsworth was an English guy, son of a miner (something he has in common with DH Lawrence, and more importantly, with me).
He knocked out all kinds of interesting novels and this is a real pearl, all about slavery, so of course it's a historical horror story.
In the middle of the story there's a ship that finds itself randomly beached on the coast of pre-Miami Florida and the slaves and sailors then get busy and create for themselves a nearly utopian settlement.And the novel turns into a very extreme exercise in authorial ventriloquism.
Such an unsettling book.
One that demanded more from my senses, emotions, thoughts than I ever expected it would.
It was not that kind of book, not the kind you can read for entertainment or enlightment alone.
Rather it is a book that demands, that contorts, that expands and contracts your heart til it cracks.
A book where the author demands the reader pay the price of turning the page.
It's 640 pages without a literary trick.
I first came upon this book nearly a decade ago; it moved me as deeply as anything I'd ever read." How many books make that claim on the reader?
A fascinating and earnest piece of historical fiction. It doesn't possess the layered ironies of some of Unsworth's other work, and I did miss that, but overall, it's very well done.
This review was written in the late nineties (for my eyes only), and it was buried in amongst my things until recently when I uncovered the journal in which it was written.
This is one of my lost reviews."...the sky took on a look of readiness for the dark, that depthless clarity which is no colour and the womb of all colours."For me this is one of the most powerful descriptions of twilight I've ever read.
I wish there was something I could do to wipe away that shame and repay those who suffered.
In its accurate depiction of these times, it is an excellent work of historical fiction.
I go so far with him as to believe it true that the moral character of man is formed by what happens to him in the world and that our nature originates in external circumstances.
Unsworthy is depicting different worlds coexisting side by side.
For me it is very hard to listen to or read Pidgin English.
Was it that I dislike reading Pidgin English?
An excellent work of historical fiction, but not enjoyable to read or listen to.
I once had a dream where I saw myself in a mirror and looked myself directly in the eyes. It was one of the most disconcerting dreams I've ever had since most of my dreams aren't quite that direct.Reading this book gave me a similar feeling. Unsworth wrote not just about slaves on a slave ship. He wrote about humans looking me, another human, directly in the eyes. I felt the same thing that I felt in that dream.And that's amazing.This book broke my heart.
SACRED HUNGER. (1992). Barry Unsworth. *****. This was recommended to me by a friend at the local library. Until then, I hadn’t heard of either the book or the author. On the cover of this American edition, it had a tasteful sticker that said: “Winner of the 1992 Booker Prize for Fiction.” I was even further embaressed. I looked it up, and, sure enough it was a winner, but it shared the prize with “The English Patient.” That book took America by storm, and was followed by an excellent film adapt
The usual route is that a ship sets off for Africa, where slaves are purchased by trade for guns – this from their own leaders.
Then the ship sets off for The New World, where the slaves are sold (traded) for sugar – a lively item of trade in England.
If the author could have pared it down to 300 pages or so and set the action on a train, it would be a great book.
but when the ship met the deep sea well, the rhythm of her movement changed and the people in the cramped and fetid darkness of the hold, understanding that they had lost all hope of returning to their homes set up a great cry of desolation and despair that carried over the water to the other ships in the road and the slaves in the holds of the ships heard it and answered with wild shouts and screams, so that for people lying awake in village in villages along the shore and solitary fishermen up before dawn, there was a period when the night resounded with the echoes of lamentation."Sacred Hunger is a difficult read--passages like this one are piercing, painful to really digest and admit.
Sacred Hunger perhaps would have been five star material if presented as a short novel of 200 to 300 pages.The story is set in the mid 18th century and involves an English merchant family, the Kemps, who build a ship christened as the Liverpool Merchant.
The elder Kemp deploys the ship in the trans-Atlantic trade by sailing from Liverpool to pick up slaves in West Africa, selling them in America and returning home with sugar to complete the triangle.
His son Erasmus, assumes large debts from the loss of the ship and takes ten years to dig out of the economic hole.

8.0/10🤸🏻♀ (This is me, doing cartwheels, because I finally finished the thing! The chap was a bit long-winded on this one.) Review to follow. But it may take me as long to get to a review, as it did to read it.
8.0/10🤸🏻‍♀️ (This is me, doing cartwheels, because I finally finished the thing! The chap was a bit long-winded on this one.) Review to follow. But it may take me as long to get to a review, as it did to read it.
10/10 . Ένα βιβλίο για τα πάντα : την ελευθερία τη φρέναπατη , το άγνωστο τους άλλους τρόπους διακυβέρνησης τις αντανακλάσεις μας , τη ναυτική ζωή , τη ζωή στην εξοχή , την ενηλικίωση , την εκδίκηση , τα πάθη και τα λάθη .
On to my impressions & a brief synopsis:On page 325, two of the characters are having a discussion as follows:"One sees the sacredness of money...Money is sacred, as everyone knows,....So then must be the hunger for it and the means we use to obtain it." And indeed, this is probably the major theme running throughout this novel.
After a while they set sail for Africa, reach their destination, take on slaves and then everything starts to go wrong.One of the expedition members is a Matthew Paris, who is Kemp's nephew and is signed on as ship's physician.
Matthew Paris, a surgeon, has lost everything as a result of a prison term for sedition, and Erasmus Kemp, the son of a Liverpool merchant (the one who owns the slaver) are the men who tell most of the story.
What happens to Paris and the ship is a wondrous mystery.Erasmus’s losses, even his emotional ones, are pretty much all about profit.
Erasmus is a frightening example of how the activity of profit-making has been made into a “sacred hunger.” A more timely point, I cannot think of.
this is on the ground, gifted with detailed, convincing images, with credible thinking of this character and that character, with no very anachronistic morality, no awareness of the difference between slave and conscience, no conflicts against the usual way of business/life, love and fate, power and dreams, which we can only look at from our oh so enlightened century...at first i find the book annoying, as it is about the empowered imperialists, the men for whom other men are 'natural' slaves, rather than about these slaves- but in time, in the structure of the narrative, it becomes clear that the intent is not celebration but condemnation.
Except for Matthew Paris, a physician aboard the slave ship, most of the main characters are detestable…mostly because they viewed the horror of buying and selling Africans as a great way to achieve that “sacred hunger”…that hunger for profit and societal status that is engrained in some of our fellow men.
The timeline is the 18th century when slave trading was in full swing.
This novel is powerful, precisely because those brutal and horrific conditions aboard the slave ship, unconceivable to my mind, were justifiable ways to feed their insatiable hunger for profit without consideration of those costs to humanity.
This was one of the best books I have ever read.
Beautiful, rich, full of adventure and sadness.
Set in the mid 1700's it tracks the final business venture (a slave ship) of a well to do Liverpudlian merchant.
The melancholy tone of the book works extremely well with the cruel methodical life aboard a slave ship.
This is set against the merchants family back in Liverpool.
A doctors oath versus cruel the brutality of the slave trade.Senseless commerce juxtaposed against hearts desires with a crazy ships captain to boot.
Read it now!
I'm not sure why I didn't enjoy this more than I did. The writing was uniformly excellent and the story made great insights into human relationships and power. I think it may have been timing, and it may have just been me. But as much as I could appreciate the quality of the novel I had a hard time getting back to it after putting it down. In fact, I read about 200 pages today in a sprint because I wanted to finish it before I completely lost interest.
I can't do justice to this one without reading it again, a worthy Booker winner and a fine book.
I'm a believer that things come into our lives sometimes only when we're ready for them or we need them for some reason or another.
I am glad to have read this book this year because I think I appreciated it more than I would have earlier.
Admittedly, during the course of the 630 pages I got lost or felt bogged down by the amount of detail pertaining to things such as ship-building and later by the nautical jargon; also as many other reviewers noted, the Pidgin English was irritating until I began "listening" to it rather than trying to merely read it.
The big message of the story is pretty straightforward: the slave trade being written off as a means to an end, a pursuit of profit, and therefore unaffected by questions of moralilty and bearing no weight on the consciences of the men involved.
Lastly, the 2 stars were earned from the passages of natural description (which I'm a sucker for!) that were, at times, sublimely written.(...also, whether the story be set in the present day or the past, white writers are SHIT at writing black characters!!)
The voyage meets its demise, [and] the sailors and slaves set up a secret, utopian society in the wilderness of Flordia, only to await the vengeance of the single-minded, young Kemp.My reactionsThis is an epic story covering a time period from 1752 – 1765.
There are two distinct, but interrelated story lines – that of Erasmus Kemp (son of William Kemp) and that of Mathew Paris (Kemp’s nephew, who sails as the ship’s doctor).
Το πρώτο βιβλίο του που διάβασα ( Χάνοντας τον Νέλσον) με έκανε να ενδιαφερθώ για αυτόν και να θελήσω να ανακαλύψω το έργο του.
Με αυτό το βιβλίο όμως τον αγάπησα.
Βρισκόμαστε στην Αγγλία του 1750, στο Λίβερπουλ ένας έμπορος απαφασίζει να ασχοληθεί με το δουλεμπόριο, το οποίο είναι φοβερά επικερδές.
Το πλοίο πρόκειται να κάνει το γνωστό εμπορικό τρίγωνο της εποχής: από το Λίβερπουλ στη Γουινέα της Αφρικής να αγοράσει και να κλέψει μαύρους και από εκεί στην Τζαμάικα να πουλήσει τους μαύρους στο σκλαβοπάζαρο και να παραλάβει ζάχαρη και βαμβάκι για την Αγγλία.
magisterial historical fiction of triangle trade, liverpool with guns, fabric, and beads to gold coast for slaves to jamaica to sell slaves and get sugar, back to liverpool.
novel takes place 1750's-1760's.
englishmen are firm in their belief that making a profit was not only virtuous, but a sign that god and your govt was smiling on you.
Fantastična knjiga. Prikazuje jedno od najružnijih i najtužnijih razdoblja u povijesti čovječanstva a to je trgovina robovima. Sve zbog "svete gladi" za profitom. U ovoj knjizi čovjek nije čovjeku vuk nego puno gore.
This is a very good novel about the slave trade, but what takes it beyond simply a retelling of the brutality of capturing and buying slaves is the on-board rebellion that occurs during the Middle Passage and the makeshift society that the seamen and slaves fashion afterward.
Sacred Hunger is one of those books that stays on your mind long after you’ve finished it.
Since Unsworth won the Pulitzer for this book I expected a lot and I wasn’t disappointed.
It’s about an English merchant who attempts to make a lot of money by purchasing trapped African people and sell them in the English colonies.Most of the action is nightmarish.
Matthew is haunted by his recent experiences only to plunge himself without thinking about the consequences of aiding in persecuting Africans.
This isn’t light reading but it will leave you with a lot to ponder.Thank you to the publisher for providing an advance reader’s copy.
Sacred Hunger is an astounding novel. It is the best book I’ve read in a long time; it is also, by far, the most devastating (which is saying something, given some of the Bookers I’ve read recently – Schindler’s Ark and The Bone People coming to mind). I have been reluctant to write this review because I’ve found it difficult to review books that I love, and Sacred Hunger falls into that category. I wasn’t sure that I’d find another Booker that I love quite as much as The Remains of the Day and
Unsworth tells you this from the beginning; you learn in the Prologue of the elderly man, a beggar on the streets of New Orleans who lived as a slave until he was too old to work, and who had stories of days as a child in a settlement where white and black men lived together and free.
I think that there may not be a single flat character in the entire book, which is incredible, given the huge number of characters that he creates.
