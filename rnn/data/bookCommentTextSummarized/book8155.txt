What paltry learning is that which is congealed in dumb books!says Mamadou Kouyaté, the griot, or oral storyteller, who's reciting this story.
It's the 800-year-old story of Sundiata (pronounced Soonjata), the greatest king of Mali and the greatest conqueror since Alexander.Here's the story: this one king is ordered by prophecy to marry this ugly lady, the ugliest hunchback in the land, which he does but she refuses to fuck him until finally he says whoops my bad I'm actually supposed to sacrifice you, not fuck you, and she gets so scared she passes out and then he fucks her while she's passed out, so, like, good plan?
I find this book of the griot storytelling style fascinating.
It is set in 12th century Mali.
What you learn in this saga is how important the carriers of history are considered in these pre-literate societies.
The knowledge of the towns, the history of the families, feuds and births and deaths.
Living history.
I learned that baraka means gifted one in the Mandingo language.
It references Hannibal -I am disturbed by the treatment of women and their jealousy towards one another as they vie of the attention of the king.This of course goes on in any society where there is polygamy.
"Il est venu. Et le bonheur est venu.Soundjata est là.Et le bonheur est là."J'avais déja lu cette histoire épique à l'université, quel bonheur d'en retrouver toute la saveur !Cette épopée raconte la naissance de Soundjata devenu roi du Manding, & relatant la fondation de l'Empire du Mali par ce dernier au XIIIe s. Il est considéré comme étant le septième & dernier conquérant (après Alexandre le Grand) et reconnu par le peuple de l'Afriqueu de l'Ouest comme un vaillant guerrier pour avoir
Il est considéré comme étant le septième & dernier conquérant (après Alexandre le Grand) et reconnu par le peuple de l'Afriqueu de l'Ouest comme un vaillant guerrier pour avoir reunifié cette partie de l'Afrique mais aussi parce que durant son règne il a été un homme craint car ayant une force physique exceptionnelle, cette force etait utilisée afin de rendre justice aux malheureux et punir les plus vils.
Tous les coqs expirèrent sur le dos face au ciel : les génies avaient répondu favorablement."	Enfin, par dessus tout ce livre est un bel hommage à l'art du griot, cet homme de Sagesse indispensable dans les sociétés ancestrales et encore aujourd'hui qui détient comme le dit si bien DT Niane "la chaire d'Histoire dans les villages".
Although The Lion King has been said to be derived from such a book, it appeared that this book was mainly mystical and spiritual. The story was discussed in my literature class and we spoke about the uniqueness of African cultured stories. It's not my style of reading, but it really was interesting.
I didn't know much about Mali, and I knew nothing about griots before I read this. So it was really interesting to see how this oral form of storytelling translated into text. There is definitely some things that I feel don't come across as well in this way as they would if there was someone telling the story out loud. Overall, I would say this is valuable, but not particularly enjoyable.
To be honest I think it would take a couple read-throughs to understand all of this. Still, I loved the story. It was fun to read and like most things from other cultures, it was informative.
Sundiata: An Epic of Old Mali D.T. Niane wrote this oral tradition down into words in 1960 in order to portray the story of an African king by the name of Sundiata.
In his preface, Niane notes that one of his main purposes for writing the book was to keep the knowledge of the story clear and to define these traditions explicitly for the future generations of kings and of griots in the new Mali of Africa.
The Griots of Mali dedicated their lives to memorise valued stories and traditions and became their culture’s historians. These people are the keepers of knowledge, and all they have learned is passed theron, verbally in the form of tales and account histories that would otherwise be forgotten. In this fashion, the story of Sundiata is passed to us after being carefully recorded and translated for present study. This text is a historical documentation of a verbal tradition. It begins with the p
Not only does it mirror a few other stories that have arisen around the world, but it is told in a gripping way, emphasising the importance of historical tales and traditions.
Sundiata is an important oral tradition for the eyes of historians, as it shows vital ideas that emerged in this African culture and gives historians a look into a culture and civilization that is not often talked about.
Set in the golden age of Mali, this tale is an exploration of African culture; A doorway to a civilization that the world doesn’t often speak of.
Also like Gesar (and sort of Arthur) he is exiled, where he wanders and learns the skills needed to rule.As he returns, he gathers allies and fights off the evil wizard King of the Soso and gains his land.
Unlike Gesar and Arthur, this version doesn’t have a downfall - he is more like Gilgamesh, another King of legend, who learns how to rule well.While there are elements of magic, I was surprised how grounded Sundiata is to some of these other myths.
Honestly, I was never excited about this text; but as I began to read the story line captured me.
Though there are certain features of the text that are fantastical, the griot Kouyate sought to tell a true story.
Digging through the text a clear story of emerges: the making of a Western Sudanese empire and emperor through much difficulty, but guided by Divine Providence (Destiny, as it is labeled in the text.There are rich details of Western Sudanese culture: the presence of Islam, but the resilience of localized religious practices, hunting and trading, political organization, and the primacy of the spoken word and the preservation of history through the spoken word.This is nice little epic novel to teach the first half of African history with.
Read it for school, but I have to say that I wish to have a griot in my own home.
We forget or lose touch on our humanity.
We forget where we began and what significance our name, our selves, our history has.
We saw the film after having read the book and looking at these people you who culture should be important....
but the mother is so modern she has someone else to clean her home.
Modernity has taken the place of tradition, of values, of what has been passed by our ancestors.
Not just the world's past but more important: ours.
The most engaging primary text I've had to read. Much more interesting and complex than "The Epic of Gilgamesh" (civilization became more complex since then), and more subtly plotted than the random events of "The Odyssey." Of course only fair to compare with a contemporary text--the works of Shakespeare. "Sundiata" is plotted like a modern suspense novel, but is 100% legible (perhaps because it was translated to English fairly recently).Unfortunately there is a lot of sexism, but that's historical.
This African epic follows the rise of the Mande people and their leader Sunjata. The narrative itself is extremely repetitious, and the lack of any background in West African traditions complicates my understanding of the plot.
I think that this book really explores constant and recurring themes in life. We are often faced with trials and tribulations, journey and growth to access our full potential. I feel that this was a really good book and I recommend people read it.
Intense, captivating...a window into historical Africa unblemished by the eyes of non-Africans.
The main drawbacks, I found, were not due to the text itself, but the translation and edition, which made the experience of this book a bit hard to appreciate fully.Things I Liked1.
Many women also have supernatural abilities, and while there are moments where men exercise power over women, there is definitely a sense that women are not completely subservient, as we would expect of stereotypical Western tales.2.
Supplementary Materials: After reading the introduction to this edition, I felt like I had some sense of what literary values the Mande people held, but I still had little knowledge of medieval Africa in general.
The book itself has quite the narrative power towards the historical details, thanks for the historians themselves of better known as “griots.” Along with bringing the reader of what certain words mean to the Niani people and other regions of Mali, due to the fact the American audience isn’t introduced with many stories that hail from Africa.
This narrative is helpful because it gave the people of Mali a reference and an identity although the translation into a book takes the full picture and meaning out of the narrative.As the title implies, this narrative is an epic, or a story accounting the adventures of a hero.
Because of this intention, Nidane was forced to reiterate the story as accurately as possible so that information would not be scewed.Meanwhile a good portion of the book has the intended meaning and effect, reading the book would not provide the full experience that listening first hand allows.
Sundiata: An Epic of Old Mali is a book written by D.T. Niane and G.D. Pickett translated it.
On the contrary, Sundiata allows the reader to see the culture, beliefs, government systems, and values of the people of old Mali.
Sundiata is an epic that allows the reader to glimpse into the culture of Old Mali.
Although, Sundiata does show the culture, beliefs, and values of the people of Old Mali it also may be portrayed in a way it was not intended to be.
Keeping in mind that Sundiata is an Epic that was originated from oral tradition it is important to know that the original story was spoken and not written.
Like many stories of those times they cannot be taken word for word as truth due to the limits they had on explaining things in society, such as the Soso king having magic powers and how they explain many things being done in the world by jinn, (supernatural spirits in Islamic mythology).
The story of Sundiata not only tells the story of the great Mali king but it also goes into the lives and culture of the people of western Africa.
In D.T. Niane’s Novella, Sundiata: An Epic of Old Mali, we are presented with the heroic tale of a prince who grows to unite his people into a strong nation. Niane makes use of his background in History he received at the University of Bordeaux, tempered by a talent in writing fiction, to weave an interesting retelling of the oral tradition of Mali people. With a wealth of information, that at times threatens to overwhelm, Sundiata gives readers an insight into legend. Prophesized by travelling
In D.T. Niane’s Novella, Sundiata: An Epic of Old Mali, we are presented with the heroic tale of a prince who grows to unite his people into a strong nation.
With a wealth of information, that at times threatens to overwhelm, Sundiata gives readers an insight into legend.
With sections that break down the important figures in the story, Background information (concerning with Geography, Religion, and Politics of the area and time frame), and a brief guide to the pronunciation of the words used in the oral tradition.
The Splendor of Sundiata  The tale of Sundiata is an ancient story about a glorious African king with humble beginnings. Even though it is part fact and part fiction and based on events that occurred thousands of years ago, the story of Sundiata’s legacy is still popular today and has even been compared to the Iliad and the Odyssey. Full of rich, traditional folklore, witty lessons and proverbs, and an epic conquest to save the kingdom of Mali from the grasp of a tyrannical king, the epic of Su
Full of rich, traditional folklore, witty lessons and proverbs, and an epic conquest to save the kingdom of Mali from the grasp of a tyrannical king, the epic of Sundiata is sure to be an insightful read.
Sundiata was one of the sons of King Nare Maghan, who was the king of Mali thousands of years ago.
One day, a soothsayer ventured to King Nare Maghan’s court and proclaimed that Sundiata was destined to become a prodigious ruler of Mali and the seventh great conquer of the world.
When Sundiata finally became a man of age, he assembled an army to retake the kingdom of Mali, which was conquered by Soumaoro, the evil sorcerer king of Sosso.
Niane wanted to write this epic to tell people of this man who created the kingdom of Mali.
Niane wrote this epic in the perspective of a griot, a person who tells information of Ancient Mali.
This man, Sundiata, the griot is informing you of wanted to leave this legacy behind of what he has done for the kingdom of Mali.
The way that Niane has formed this epic is by writing about historical details and facts of a man who created Ancient Mail.
I feel that Niane fulfilled his purpose of writing Sundiata: An Epic of Mali.
This 197 page version stays engaging and manageable throughout, with footnotes that make sense of key details and references in the original text.The basic story is the tale of a falling out between wings of a family; after a bunch of preliminary matter, the core conflict is between Soso Bali Sumaworo on the one hand, and Sanjata and his mother and brothers on the other.
One of the other nice touches of Conde's version is his insistence - repeated throughout the performance - that all human beings are descendants of Adam, and are brothers, essentially the same, no matter our specific lineages.
Conrad, tr., Sunjata: A West African Epic of the Mande Peoples (narrated by Djanka Tassey Cond��) [2004] 206 pagesBetween the eleventh and sixteenth centuries, three major empires rose and fell in the West African savannah, approximately in what are now the countries of Senegal, Guinea and Mali: the Empires of Ghana, Mali, and Songhai.
The Mande Epic of Sunjata is the story of the thirteenth century founder of the second empire, the Empire of Mali, who is variously known as Sonjara, Sunjata, Sundiata, etc.
The first book, collected and translated by Gordon Innes, contains two versions from Gambia; the second, collected and translated by David C.
I can add yet another fine national epic to my library.Sundiata is an epic of Mali, told by a griot (a singer of the culture's lore ).
Sadly, his stepmom is evil and wants to destroy him, so he and his natural mother go into exile.The highlight of this story is when he faces the Sorcerer King; a despot who isn't happy until he conquers Mali as well as other kingdoms.
Sundiata is seen in Mali as a mighty king, who extended his country's borders and ruled an empire.
(Just because something is written doesn't make it any more valuable/true.) There issss a disclaimer in the book, saying that there is no definitive version of the Sundiata epic story, and to ask which is "right" is a "very Western question." It is history, which is always contradictory...Djeli Mamoudou Kouyaté explains that the people of Niani knew that Sundiata was prophesied to be a great ruler, yet they still fell for the petty gossip spread by Sassouma Bérété and mocked him during his handicapped childhood.
I was most interested in the first half of the book, when Sogolon (Sundiata's mother) is first introduced and the sections that talked about Sundiata's childhood.
When Sogolon and her son are exiled, though, I thought the story became kind of complicated and there were too many people being introduced all at once (most of them being rather inconsequential).
It's just not my type of book.*I forgot as I was reading Sundiata, that this story was the inspiration for the Disney movie The Lion King.
It was kind of interesting trying to find other similarities between them that might be less obvious.
This book was kind of hard to get through - it's written in a very old, epic style.
I give it two stars not because it's a bad story or because it was poorly written, but because I personally was kind of bored by it.
The original story was told by a griot (an African bard), and the book is a Malian professor's translation of the griot's words.
What paltry learning is that which is congealed in dumb books!""Before Balla had finished speaking, the king of Sibi, shouting his war-cry, started his fiery charger off at full gallop.
I can name a couple of dozen stories of similar structure that the folks at Disney were far more likely to know.
And while Disney deservedly doesn't have a great reputation for cultural sensitivity or accuracy, when they copy something, they tend to admit it, and in general, it tends to be a story people recognize.Most web sources are referencing one book - which I haven't read, and one academic paper, whoss online archive happens to be down.
But personally, I think the similarities are coincidence and not evidence of any deliberate action on Disney's part.
