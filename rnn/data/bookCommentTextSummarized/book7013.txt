'The rain, it streams on stone and hillock .
'The half-moon westers low, my love .
'When the eye of day is shut .
The Sage to the Young Man--V.
'When green buds hang in the elm like dust .
'The farms of home lie lost in even .
'Like mine, the veins of these that slumber .
'To stand up straight and tread the turning mill .
'Shake hands, we shall never be friends; give over .
'I wake from dreams and turning .
'Smooth between sea and land .
'Morning up the eastern stair .
One of my favorites:XVIHow clear, how lovely brightHow beautiful to sight Those beams of morning play;How heaven laughs out with gleeWhere, like a bird set free,Up from the eastern sea Soars the delightful day.To-day I shall be strong,No more shall yield to wrong, Shall squander life no more;Days lost, I know not how,I shall retrieve them now;Now I shall keep the vow I never kept before.Ensanguining the skiesHow heavily it dies Into the west away;Past touch and sight and soundNot further to be foundHow hopeless underground Falls the remorseful day.
I have loved, do love and shall love Housman. Way out of fashion, like my other young love Swinburne. I spent more time with them than with those thought better poets, early in life, and have no regrets. It's true the alt sexuality helped in both cases. Perhaps I can liken Housman to the lyrics of The Smiths. I think I can.
Always forthright and devoid of the esoteric and modernistic qualities of more revered poets, Housman's work, though imbued with a pronounced melancholy, is never strident or sanctimonious.
One revels in the allegorical poem XVIII from Additional Poems: "Oh they're taking him to prison for the colour of his hair." Perhaps my favorite in this collection full of favorites is XXXI from More Poems:"Because I liked you betterThan suits a man to say,It irked you, and I promisedTo throw the thought away.To put the world between usWe parted, stiff and dry;'Good-bye', said you, 'forget me.''I will, no fear' said I.If here, where clover whitensThe dead man's knoll, you pass,And no tall flower to meet youStarts in the trefoiled grass,Halt by the headstone namingThe heart no longer stirred,And say the lad that loved youWas one that kept his word."Haunting.
Forgive the format but I couldn't resist:I read this collection Whilst suffering the heatOf another year's vacationAnd found the writer neat. While maudlin and morose,Houseman's depiction of youthful loveAs naive, beautiful and verboseFit my memories of it like a glove.
To an Athlete Dying YoungThe time you won your town the raceWe chaired you through the market-place;Man and boy stood cheering by,And home we brought you shoulder-high.Today, the road all runners come,Shoulder-high we bring you home,And set you at your threshold down,Townsman of a stiller town.This is one of my favorite poems in this collection. I like it so much that I can't see how any lover of poetry could fail to respond to it.
Yes, I know. How dreadfully unfashionable! And yet... I've loved Housman's poetry since high school. I love his pastiches of both Sappho and the Greek Anthology, I love the clear-eyed and Stoic sense of fate and loss, I love the crisp precision. This is a volume I've had on my shelves since I was sixteen--- replaced over and over. And it'll always be a favourite.
favorite poemUntitled by A.E. HousmanI to my perilsOf cheat and charmer Came clad in armourBy stars benign.Hope lies to mortalsAnd most believe her,But man’s deceiverWas never mine.The thoughts of othersWere light and fleeting,Of lovers’ meeting Or luck or fame. Mine were of trouble,And mine were steady,So I was readyWhen trouble came.
Marvellous. Not all poems in here are as good as each other—this is to be expected in a near exhaustive collection—but when Housman writes well, he writes well indeed. There is a faint melancholy that fills his poetry, but which is rarely overstated. His nostalgic poems on loss in war are often the best.
It's really a picture of his life when read all the way through. If a poem doesn't make sense...then read the poem before it and the one afterwards to help. Great stories altogether.
He words my thoughts far better than I can think them.
This is a fine collection of Housman’s poems. Housman is both musical and sad. Like the great, modern, sad song-writers, Housman’s poems put the reader into a state of appreciative melancholy.

I can see why he is loved, and maybe when i re-read this book I will be in a melancholic state so I can identify with him. Two poems really caught my attention though, and for that I am grateful I read it. And, as he says: "They say my narrow verse is sad: no wonder, Its narrow measure spans Tears of eternity, and sorrow,Not mine, but Man's. This is for all ill-treated fellows Unborn and unbegot, For them to read when they're in trouble And I am not."
Wonderful lyrical poetry which has so many memorable lines. These are often very dark with an underlying theme of tragedy and death. Housman's sexuality underlies much of his verse but setting this aside, the poems are great literature. I might allow that I know the country quite well, having lived there for 10 years and this certainly adds to the joy of reading his collection. I have not entered a finish date because I never will finish the book.
This was my first encounter with Housman, and I must say it was a pleasure to come across his writing. He reminds me of Poe, sans the Victorian flare.Here is one of the many I adored:𝘍𝘳𝘰𝘮 𝘧𝘢𝘳, 𝘧𝘳𝘰𝘮 𝘦𝘷𝘦 𝘢𝘯𝘥 𝘮𝘰𝘳𝘯𝘪𝘯𝘨𝘈𝘯𝘥 𝘺𝘰𝘯 𝘵𝘸𝘦𝘭𝘷𝘦-𝘸𝘪𝘯𝘥𝘦𝘥 𝘴𝘬𝘺,𝘛𝘩𝘦 𝘴𝘵𝘶𝘧𝘧 𝘰𝘧 𝘭𝘪𝘧𝘦 𝘵𝘰 𝘬𝘯𝘪𝘵 𝘮𝘦𝘉𝘭𝘦𝘸 𝘩𝘪𝘵𝘩𝘦𝘳: 𝘩𝘦𝘳𝘦 𝘢𝘮 𝘐.𝘕𝘰𝘸 - 𝘧𝘰𝘳 𝘢 𝘣𝘳𝘦𝘢𝘵𝘩 𝘐 𝘵𝘢𝘳𝘳𝘺𝘕𝘰𝘳 𝘺𝘦𝘵 𝘥𝘪𝘴𝘱𝘦𝘳𝘴𝘦 𝘢𝘱𝘢𝘳𝘵 -𝘛𝘢𝘬𝘦 𝘮𝘺 𝘩𝘢𝘯𝘥 𝘲𝘶𝘪𝘤𝘬 𝘢𝘯𝘥 𝘵𝘦𝘭𝘭 𝘮𝘦,𝘞𝘩𝘢𝘵 𝘩𝘢𝘷𝘦 𝘺𝘰𝘶 𝘪𝘯 𝘺𝘰𝘶𝘳 𝘩𝘦𝘢𝘳𝘵.𝘚𝘱𝘦𝘢𝘬 𝘯𝘰𝘸, 𝘢𝘯𝘥 𝘐 𝘸𝘪𝘭𝘭 𝘢𝘯𝘴𝘸𝘦𝘳;𝘏𝘰𝘸 𝘴𝘩𝘢𝘭𝘭 𝘐 𝘩𝘦𝘭𝘱 𝘺𝘰𝘶, 𝘴𝘢𝘺;𝘌𝘳𝘦 𝘵𝘰 𝘸𝘪𝘯𝘥'𝘴 𝘵𝘸𝘦𝘭𝘷𝘦 𝘲𝘶𝘢𝘳𝘵𝘦𝘳𝘴𝘐 𝘵𝘢𝘬𝘦 𝘮𝘺 𝘦𝘯𝘥𝘭𝘦𝘴𝘴 𝘸𝘢𝘺.
Solid.
~ A.E. Housman, "The Chestnut Casts His Flambeaux" The sentiment of this famous stanza, though not at all original and at first reading appearing to be just another variant of carpe diem, stands out for its droll, exaggerated, yet nonetheless beautiful language and really underscores the value of poetry versus prose.
Housman is practically saying that all of us on our journey of life itself are condemned to death (and, in a sense, we are), and thus we should seize the day and go after our heart's desire whenever we can.
Poets who depend less on rhyme schemes, which can make deeply felt themes feel overly simple or insufficiently tricky or not-quite-grave-enough or ...
It knows exactly what it is and where it is tethered, in the hopeless English country side at the turn of the century.There is something both intricate and simple about Housman's most famous poem, "To An Athlete Dying Yung." Its singsongy quality doesn't diminish its message, a mix of fatalism and harsh reality.
Read this way, these are timeless verses, as applicable to today's hopeless towns as the countryside of turn of the century England.
When green buds hang in the elm like dust And sprinkle the lime like rain, Forth I wander, forth I must And drink of life again.
This latent rhyme is confirmed by the image of 'look at the leaves uncurled' which could be fig leaves uncurled from genitals or simply watching a cock become erect, and still more so by 'cuckoo flowers'.So here we have a Housman poem where the usual trope of youthful hope crushed by death is partially reversed: doom is not predicted in the last part of the poem, but its suggestion in the first three lines hangs like a pall over the rest of the poem.
E. Housman was one of the great English poets, and people who are into reading English language poetry will hardly need a review: they will want to have a copy of his works, and will only need to know that this is the edition to get, since it includes the canon of his work as authorized by his brother Laurence, in an attractively designed, easy to read volume.
(There are several editions published by Holt beginning in 1940, but to the best of my knowledge they are all basically the same collection.)For those who want to explore poetry and know little or nothing of Housman's work, my only advice is: get this book.
But reading a lot of Housman at a sitting is like consuming a sheet of marzipan.
So tooling through three or four dozen of them at a time, they do tend to blend together because of a unanimity of theme, vocabulary and style.
The vocabulary never changes too much, though in the later poems Housman becomes increasingly fond of multisyllabic words: his earlier excursions in ballad meter are almost all monosyllabic.
The earlier poems show a great deal of subtlety in the handling of rigid meter forms even with the use of so many short words.
There is a certain kind of sadness to many of the poems in this collection; a sadness that in all probability stems from the Housman's struggle with his own feelings and homosexuality throughout his life.
The last piece of text in this collection is actually not from Housman himself, but a letter from Housman's brother that delves into this kept secret.
Houseman's Collected Poems are no exception.
I sang the collection.
Contrary to my normal tastes, however, I liked a lot of the poems.
Here's a collection of simple storied verse containing most of the regular conceits about love and loss.
A lot of it also contained stuff about being a farmboy or yodeling on a country hilltop to God or some crap like that.
Then the end of the collection were translations that I also didn't get into.
Still, every so often, a form poem appeared that told the plain truth about lovers and time.
Often simple is better.
Perhaps the most surprising thing about Housman is that he wasn't a Shropshire lad at all and was quite possibly never in Shropshire at all, at least until he was buried there. The "blue remembered hills" were what he remembered seeing at a distance from his Worcestershire home. The yearning tone of many of these poems reflects the unfulfilled life he led as well as his sympathy for those whose lives were unfulfilled in ways different from his (I'm thinking particularly of Is My Team Ploughing?) A seriously good poet who deserves to be remembered.
every now and again Housman fits my mood perfectly- mainly when i'm feeling unbearably pessimistic and broken. Having read about his (apparently) unrequited love for his dear friend Jackson makes Housman's poetry even more depressing to read. If you're in a good mood, his writing will seem either petty or change your disposition rather drastically. If you're miserable, hide anything sharp before reading.
What stood out in Housman's writing was the interesting way he mixed humor and grief. It was a clever style that created some unique poems. However, it remains as 4, instead of 5, stars because there was nothing that stood out to me as one of the best. It simply had a clever feel that made it interesting to read.
I love how Housman's poetry is like plodding along a pastoral scene where everything is flowers and rhymes and every now and then he throws in something like;"hope lies to mortalsand most believe her" (VI)like wow Alfred. Specialising in the grenade/gem combo. There's something cheeky about his style that I enjoy, and I definitely liked it more on the second go through.
I fell in love with A.E. Housman's poetry when I was a freshman in high school. Easily my favorite poet, his written word often leaves me with goosebumps and tears welling up in my eyes. That, to me, is the sign of true talent. I cannot say enough about this man's work! Buy the book. You won't be sorry.
Houseman did not have a large output of material but it only serves to show the quality of his work, only picking up his pen when he was truly inspired payed off. One of my favourite British poets. Tender and timeless.
If he'd never written anything but 'Into my heart an air that kills' and 'The night is freezing fast', then he would be a great poet. He has such a constant voice, style, idiom and theme so perfectly matched always. This should be on the shelf of anyone who loves poetry.
