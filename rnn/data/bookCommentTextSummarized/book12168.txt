Yet, it never seems as obvious to him that if he wants to live in love, he must spend at least as much time as the auto mechanic or the gourmet in studying love.” “I hug everybody—just come close to me, you’re more than likely to get hugged, certainly touched.”~ Leo Buscaglia from LoveI smile as I type these words—just having Buscaglia’s book, Love, open in front of me is enough to make me happy.
By the end of reading it, you’ll wish you could give Leo Buscaglia—a former Professor of Love at USC—a big ol’ hug.Here are some of the Big Ideas:1.
Study Love - How else to master it?2.
ok, this book was published in the 70's - and it shows. But if you can overlook some of the obvious outdated slang and such, then there really is a lot of good stuff in there.My favorite 70's line: "Sometimes I get up in the morning, and I feel so freaky and good, I can't stand it." :)
This book was first published in the early 1970's and I read it a million years ago.
Something else that I was thinking about a couple of weeks ago made me revisit this book and I have to say that I enjoyed it immensly reading it some 30 years after my first encounter with it.
Basically, Dr. Buscaglia, who was an educator, taught a class on love at the University of the State of California.
The book is a collection of his and his students observations on love that they shared in their class.
"Ο άνθρωπος δεν πρέπει να εξαρτιέται από κανέναν κι από τίποτα για ενίσχυση κι εξασφάλιση εκτός από 
I felt that I was listening to a wise person who understands life very well, despite the differences we both have and the filters that makes us see the world so differently.
I also liked how the author backed his arguments with theories of philosophers and sociologists, it helped me connect with his teachings on love and life and understand some of the episodes I have been through in the past.This book is a good reminder of core values in humanity, a recharge to our love tank before giving others.

❤️ “Too often we underestimate the power of a touch, a smile, a kind word, a listening ear, an honest compliment, or the smallest act of caring, all of which have the potential to turn a life around.”~ Leo F.
Leo gets a little wordy and it bogs down in spots for me, but overall, a great exploration that addresses the question, "What is Love?"Favorite quotes:Because love is too many things to be definitive about it, "The difference between saying, "I love you" to a friend or to a lover is that...
the friend would know exactly what you mean."and"Love is always open arms...
If you close your arms about love you'll find you are left only holding yourself."and"For if one expects nothing and asks nothing, he can never be deceived or disappointed.
After dinner each night, he would ask, "So, what did you learn today, Felice?"and"Love is always changing and always learning...
This is probably the third time I've read this book.
I first received it in the eighth grade, and middle school being a particularly bleak time, I found it sort of inspiring.
Leo Buscaglia's book was written some time ago.
It includes anachronistic slang like the word "groovy" and the most recent text cited in it is copyright 1970, but the general message holds up well over time.
One of the central ideas of Buscaglia's framework is that can't give something you don't have, so you need to love yourself before you can really love others.
This is a simple,unindulgent text that inspires one to love oneself and others to the fullest extent possible.
Good enough book - a tad dated but it got me thinking about the subject of love.
Buscaglia made a good point that we are taught to drive a care, we prepare for our jobs, a teacher helps us learn to read but nobody ever teaches us about love.Quotes I liked:"It's only love when given without expectation." p.
66Love lives in the moment; it's neither lost in yesterday nor does it crave for tomorrow.
Love is Now!" p.
83"To love other you must love yourself." p.
I love this man.
I love the way he writes and the way he thinks.
A sentence that he wrote in the forward made me completely connect.
He said "Sometimes I get up in the morning, and I feel so freaky and good, I can't stand it." Who hasn't had a morning like that.
It's a short read, a good read, based on his original Love Class.
There's so much more to learn about love but this is his class.
The world is a better place because he was born.
His gift to this world.I devoured this book inside 4 hours.
Ως γνωστικό αντικείμενο, γίνεται κάτι που το μαθαίνεις και το εξασκείς.
Δίνει στην έννοια της αγάπης μια εξελικτική φύση και την καθιστά έννοια που είναι και νοητική/πνευματική και όχι μόνο συναισθηματική, αν και σε βαθύτερα στάδια και το ίδιο το συναίσθημα θα μπορούσε να πει κανείς ότι ανάγεται σε κάτι νοητικό.Πολλοί μπορεί να αποφύγουν ένα βιβλίο με τίτλο "αγάπη'' γιατί ίσως θεωρήσουν από πριν ότι θα είναι ένα από εκείνα τα "γλυκανάλατα" και "ανορθολογικά", όλο συναίσθημα, κείμενα, γεγονός που και ο ίδιος ο συγγραφέας τονίζει μέσα, πως έτυχε τέτοιων αντιδράσεων απέναντι στο εγχείρημα του αλλά και στην ίδια την έννοια της αγάπης.
Bu kitap, yani Türkçe çevirisiyle 'Sevgi', hem hediye olduğu için hem de önemli konusu sebebiyle benim icin çok değerliydi.
Kitapta üzerine düşünülmesi gereken sevgi kavramıyla ilgili önemli tespitler var.
Sevgi konusuna biraz kafa patlatmak isterseniz, seni seviyorum ne demektir düşünmek isterseniz, sevgi nasıl oluşur, nasıl biter ya da biter mi üzerine akıl yürütmek isterseniz bu kitabı sevebilirsiniz.Sevgi konusuyla ilgili olarak okuduğum ve çok sevdiğim bir diğer kitap Eric Fromm'un Sevme Sanatı kitabıdır.
Konuyu biraz daha teknik ele alan etkileyici bir kitaptır.
Biraz konu dışı da olsa paylaşmak istediğim bir nokta daha var.
Πόσο δροσιστικό για το μυαλό και την καρδιά μπορεί να 'ναι ένα βιβλίο! Σα να φυσά θαλασσινό αεράκι μέσα σου, θυμίζοντάς σου όσα ήδη γνωρίζεις κι όσα αξίζει ναγαπάς! Buscaglia, την αγάπη μου.
Πόσο δροσιστικό για το μυαλό και την καρδιά μπορεί να 'ναι ένα βιβλίο! Σα να φυσά θαλασσινό αεράκι μέσα σου, θυμίζοντάς σου όσα ήδη γνωρίζεις κι όσα αξίζει ν΄αγαπάς! Buscaglia, την αγάπη μου.
I first read this book some twenty-one or two year ago at university.
I recall reading passages again and again during the rough passages in my relationship with Dave B.
And I recall that I latched onto his analogy of being a second rate banana versus a first rate and best juicy plum.
This time through reading a clean copy after two more decades of life experience I was drawn to the parts that referred to societal change through universal love.
I bought and read six or seven of his books back then and now that he's dead I miss that big, boisterous hugger dearly!
Picked up the book and didn't put it down until I was finished... uplifting... thought provoking... "Each person lives love in his limited fashion and does not seem to relate the resultant confusion and lonliness to his or her lack of knowledge about love."You don't have to believe love can be reified. If you just take the book as an intelligent discussion about the ubiquitous feeling/social construction/sacred gift/however-you-want-to-see-it which unfortunately lacks much academic attention, and if you think you may derive some inspiration to love deeper or fuller, then may be a good read for you!
40 years after it was published, and 25 years after I first read it, this remains my favorite book about human relationships. I miss watching Leo's lectures on PBS. We can always use someone who preaches a message of love, acceptance, understanding and joy.A short book with a simple message, Love should be mandatory reading for all teachers, anyone applying for a marriage license, or anyone that's going to interact with other people.
Have you ever thought... What IS love? Migraine? Yeah... Read this book. This is probably the best book on human relationships that exists. It's not meant to be a self-help book, but it could easily be the best one of those as well.
It was nice in the beginning, but he kept repeating the same ideas over and over which made it boring by the end.
I first read this book when I was 15 year old. It will always be one of the books on a very short list, which saved me. God Bless Felice Leonardo Buscaglia!
I laughed, and cried, and felt very alive. Leo is an amazing person.
Love yourself first.-One cannot appreciate what he does not recognize-One cannot admit what he does not yield to-To be is to do-Total immersion in life offers the best classroom for learning to love-Responsible love shares.
The more he learns, the more his opportunities to change his behavioral responses-Life is not the goal.
It's the process.-Live the moment not for the moment-By marking time and being regimented, we are forgetting to be spontaneous-We're almost afraid to do anything because can't do it perfectly-Everything is constantly changing, pay attention, but don't get attached-Change takes place all around you.
As I was looking through the books, "Love" caught my eye.
I didn't realize at the time, but this novel introduced me to my first stream of philosophical thought.
It's as if the philosopher in me was hiding all this time, and Leo Buscaglia finally brought her out.In my first semester of freshman year, I was randomly placed in a philosophy class, and it was Love at first sight.
And now, I am an intended philosophy major.Not only did this novel give me a little tangible connection with my grandmother, but it also helped me discover a piece of myself I never knew about.
"Αυτό το βιβλίο είναι κι αποσκοπούσε να είναι ένα μοίρασμα.
Κι μ' αυτή την έννοια είναι ένα βιβλίο αγάπης", γράφει στο τέλος του βιβλίου ο συγγραφέας.
Για μένα, αποτέλεσε ένα όμορφο ταξίδι στον κόσμο της αγάπης κι αναμφισβήτητα ένα μοίρασμα γνώσεων του Λέο Μπουσκάλια.
Σε γενικές γραμμές μου άρεσε, αλλά νομίζω αρκετά αποσπάσματα, αν όχι όλο το βιβλίο σχεδόν, ήταν ίδια με όσα έχει γράψει σε ένα άλλο βιβλίο του, το "Να ζεις, να αγαπάς και να μαθαίνεις".
Συνεπώς, αν και διάβασα με ενδιαφέρον το βιβλίο "Η αγάπη", ίσως να προτιμούσα να ξαναδιαβάσω το βιβλίο που ανέφερα προηγουμένως κι όχι αυτό για το οποίο έγραψα τη συγκεκριμένη κριτική.
Still resonates today as it did a few decades ago; maybe more so when one takes into account the disconnected nature of today's society as a result of technology sometimes replacing or attempting to simulate true community. Focuses on the simple things, such as making connections with people (charity and compassion) and shifting attitudes that sometimes prevent us from making these connections (pride and fear).
Leo Buscaglia is a great writer and this book, although a bit dated, provides a really profound explanation into the subject. I have really enjoyed reading this book and I would not mind reading it again. The author also provides many little tips or quotes of wisdom that really touches you. I highly recommend this book.
spunky hippy fun! optimistic, chalk-full of 70s slang... a neat read
Great read.
This is a book I read when I was younger. What I remember is how it made me feel, it was a place that I think I may benefit from re-visiting 😀 💟
I loved the opening intro portion of the book. Leo's writing within the book itself felt repetative and wandering, however the intro section made the rest of the reading worth it! So many powerful points made there. I gave up somewhere in the last three chapters and quit reading, but appreciate Leo's view deeply overall.
Αποτέλεσμα αυτού του διαρκούς αγώνα αφιερωμένου στη συζήτηση, στη βίωση και στο μοίρασμα της αγάπης αποτελεί το βιβλίο του “Η αγάπη”, το οποίο πρωτο-κυκλοφόρησε το 1972.Μέσα απ’ αυτό το βιβλίο ο Μπουσκάλια δεν επιχειρεί να ορίσει και ν’ αποσαφηνίσει οριστικά την αγάπη, αλλά περισσότερο να μοιραστεί τα προσωπικά του συμπεράσματα περί αγάπης ή τα συμπεράσματα άλλων ανθρώπων που στο ταξίδι της ζωής τα μοιράστηκαν μαζί του.
Είναι μια ολόκληρη ιστορία που δε μοιάζει να ‘χει αρχή αλλά σίγουρα δεν έχει τέλος, όπως ακριβώς και η αγάπη.
Και θα ‘ρθουν και μέρες που θα νιώσουμε πως δεν έχουμε πια απόσταση να διανύσουμε, πως η αγάπη είναι εδώ, μέσα μας.
