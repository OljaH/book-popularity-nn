Much draws from Benjamin's earlier work, on the history of aesthetic philosophy or his studies on Baudelaire.
Though he would later conflict with the dogmatists of historical materialism as a story of inexorable, he draws from earlier discussions on the origins commodity fetishism.
He discusses the history and techniques in advertising and the display of consumer products.
From that logic, Benjamin also presents a dominant narrative of history itself as a 'dream' to wake up from.
From here, Benjamin presents a few thoughts on the psychology of history.
In his own history, Benjamin presents an exceptional empathy for the downtrodden and the oppressed.
Then, many many years later, way after that whole Nazi thing had blown over, a bunch of people were sitting around one day scratching their heads wondering what had ever happened to that crazy thing Benjamin had been working on back when the shit hit the fan, and Bataille said, "I have it!" And then the Germans spent about twenty years editing the hell out of it, as they are wont to do, and it wasn't translated into English until like the eighties or something, but now is readily available at every respectable bookseller in America....
The Arcades Project is sprawling, unclassifiable....oneiric.
Posing as an historical analysis of the Parisian arcades--the outdoor equivalent of (and precursors to) shopping malls--this book is also (among other things) a cultural history of the 19th century, an intellectual biography of Baudelaire, an essay on the philosophy of history, a meditation on industrialization, a portrait of the city of Paris, one of the best works of criticism on literary modernism, a reflection on the textual styles of the Kabbalah, and also an original contribution to both psychoanalysis and Marxism.
It is also, as Benjamin himself notes, an "awakening" from the dream of the 19th century.This book is almost impossible to read straight through, but carefully directed perusal bears great rewards.
Convolutes N and K are particularly good.
I suppose, were I to have stuck it out, and had Benjamin stay’d on a little longer and gotten this thing wrap’d up, he may have assisted me somewhat in articulating exactly why I f**kin’ hate shopping malls so much.
And I’m pretty sure that maybe something might have started to pop were I to get past this f**kin’ two hundred pages about Baudelaire, but I really just kind of doubt it.Meanwhile, The Arcades Project offers the aspiring novelist, and by novelist one must mean the innovative experimental sui generis type who finds formal clues in non-fictive genre, a whole new world of formal possibilities for that Next Great Novel.
"Kitleler, kendilerini oyalayacak bir şeyler ararlar, oysa sanat, izleyicisinden kendini toplayıp yoğunlaştırmasını ister."
I've been reading this book forever...
This is the kind of book you are always currently reading, because this is the kind of book that is almost impossible to read entirely, and once you've read it you need to start reading again.
Fragmented and brilliant, sometimes confusing but always worthwhile, this book will come back to you again and again.
It's supposedly a history of bourgeois Paris in the 1800s, but really it's a history of people, of culture and consumerism, of replication and lights, of wandering the city and modernity and why we are now what we are now because of how they were back then.
حافظه ابزار کشف گذشته نیست. خاطره همان قدر وسیله ی شناخت گذشته است که خاک ابزاری است برای شناخت شهرهای مدفون شده.والتر بنیامین.
Where to start with this behemoth?First, let it be said that Benjamin was one of the 20th Century's most original minds, and I've been a big fan for years.
My thesis advisor in college always tried to push this book off on me, but now that I've read it, I don't know how she could have expected me to use it academically.
These little fragments, a great many of them quotes, are almost like a mosaic that hasn't quite come together, the grand, final, unfinished project of Benjamin's life.
I doubt many people would want to pick up something like this, but I do.
Because it is almost entirely impossible to categorize the work which is more than one thousand pages long, in terms of literature, most people simply call it research for something else, the form of which isn't yet clear.
And so, since I love all manner of arcades myself, I wanted to dip into this book to get some sense of atmosphere.
Benjamin looks at Arcades as almost a dream world and that serves my purpose.
The fact that Benjamin escaped from the Nazis by struggling across the border between France and Spain carrying the manuscript [thousands of pages] in a sack, gives new meaning to dedication to one's work.
Of course... I haven't read the entire book yet. This book is full of quotes and little pieces of thoughts and complex ideas... Is like an enormous puzzle! That's why I love it... I love to "solve" things, to travel through words and concepts... I love when I know that I'm another piece of that puzzle.This is not an "easy" book (I'm not going to define "easy" for me... that's not so easy)... but it is really advisable to all the people who want to get lost for a while into one of the greatest minds of the 20th Century.
I feel like I just speed read the Necronomicon.
I don't know if I'll read a book sadder than this.
The Arcades Project does in a way work as Benjamin's unfinished masterwork.
It is told in fragments, and Benjamin generally just comments on other folks, (the book is mainly quotations).
In a sense there isn't much revolutionary critique in Arcades, but rather a sort of elegiac longing for times past that probably never were or a future that will definitely not be as Benjamin hopes.
In this way Benjamin is like the gnomish Prufrock or even vaguely like the millineal urban hipster who can't help but at once be fascinated and repelled by his city.WARNING: This is mostly told in fragments and quotations of other people.
The Arcades ProjectA ragbag book.
For years, Benjamin acquired quotations, anecdotes, and any sort of thing related to the covered shopping arcades to be found around Paris.
As the project continued the connection with the original interest became more tenuous – the most significant part of the book is a long essay on Baudelaire.
The entire collection is organized in Benjamin’s own filing system; it is a repository from which he drew the material for many of his published articles.
The contents of the (virtual) file drawer itself were published in 1999.
The Arcades Project is the material of that creativity.

Walter Benjamin's notes on the decrepit Parisian arcades are, as a few of the other reviewers have already noted, the sort of thing one doesn't "read" so much as refer back to.
To call this a "book" is, to an extent, misleading, since it's really the compendium of notes Benjamin scribbled while researching what was to be his life's project.
These notes are too valuable to simply relegate to some university's archive for the exclusive use of dedicated Benjamin scholars.
I found the section on flâneurie immeasurably helpful in a recent research project and expect to return to the book's other sections eventually...
I'm not certain how to coherently talk about the Arcades Project or if something like "coherently talking" is even appropriate given the nature of this beast.
Baudillare, The Flaneur, examinations into boredom, the role of architecture in turning people into ever greater consumers and commodities, the failures of capitalism and heavy industry, 19th century fashion...
ad infinitum.
The one thing I think I can say confidently about these 1000+ pages of fragments is that they are next to impossible to reduce to any one thing.
This is the final, unfinished expression of a singular intellect.

Arcades in Europe are the first shopping malls. And this is what Walter Benjamin projected his big writing project on. Saying that, this book is totally insane. It's the Rainbow Gravity of cultural theory. It's difficult in parts, but with Benjamin as the driver, you have no choice than to go for the ride.But also I strongly suggest one checks out Benjamin's other books or essays before going into the Arcades Project. After reading his other wonderful and brilliant essays/books - then you should proceed to this magnificent think tank of a book.
The Arcades Project is a remarkable catalogue—a listing of influences and thoughts. It is in some sense not unlike Joyce's or Woolf's attempts to catalogue the ideas and feelings of a single day, only with Benjamin it is an attempt to list and represent the experience of the bourgeois in the century of progress, in effect to undermine the lunacy of ideaology. It is an early post-modern attempt to center history not on the rulers of history but on the downtrodden, the forgotten. In pieces and fragments, the Project begins to archeologically ressurect shards of forgotten experience.
I love Benjamin. Really. I was first introduced in my advanced french literature class. I took it up again with an independent research grant to study Flanerie. His observations and beautifully written and amazingly accurately rendered. His writing is such that you feel you can taste and see and smell everything he does. And the breadth of his coverage is simply astounding. Again - I love Benjamin.
I have read this book both in the original and in translation several times. My copy is falling apart but I can not find a suitable replacement in the library or in used book stores, aquizition of a new one is cost prohibitive. I find myself lost in the endless explications and musings until I often am surprised when looking up to not find the glass and metal skeleton of an actual arcade. I try to read some of it every day.
This was Benjamin's great unfinished project. The reconstruction done here is worth looking through but i think of less value then Susan Buck-Morss's 'The Dialectics of Seeing', an amazing work based on the Arcades Project, as well as her extensive research on Benjamin's life and philosophy.
the traces of a mighty mind and passion struggles to rebuild the capital city of the 19th century and everything important linked to it, including it's soul and dreams. it is true that if the worldwideweb can be condensed in to a book then it would certainly be like The Arcades Project
one of the most important works of the last hundred years!
Good book to head back to if you ever need to stop writing. This should make you feel inadequate to do so for a good 24 hours because it makes you feel so dumb(in comparison to his megabrain)
It's like a dream --- there's no identifiable end or beginning and all one can do is meander through.
I recommend you read Benjamin along with Adorno's Minima Moralia and de Certeau's The Practice of Everyday Life (esp. the last chapter "Walking in the City")
Wild and unwieldy, yet beautifully intricate and broad in it's reach; utterly fascinating and easy to browse.
