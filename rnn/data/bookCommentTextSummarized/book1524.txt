Secret Adversary is the first Tommy & Tuppence novel. Ta-da!I'm not going to claim that it's great, but it was entertaining. And Christie managed to make me think I  KNEW  who the hell dunnit, only to jerk the rug out from underneath me...again. <--to be fair, that's kind of her thing, you know?You know what was cute, though? All the snappy dialogue between the not-quite-yet lovebirds. I mean, it's probably not snappy by today's standards, but back in the day, I'm betting this was quite t

The first book up, The Secret Adversary, is the initial entry in the Tommy & Tuppence cozy mystery series she's written.
Although I've read a bunch of her novels, I hadn't read anything in this particular series, so I was glad that one of them won the poll to choose our books that I had set up earlier this year.In this caper, Tommy and Tuppence, ~22 year old somewhat poor residents of London around 1920, are bored enough to form a partnership where they will agree to do anything legal to obtain a salary.
Both are best described as Bright Young Things of their time, both are broke, and both are looking for way to make some money.I absolutely love the start of this story, the setting and the dialogue between Tommy and Tuppence.
However, what is striking about The Secret Adversary is that it was published in 1922 - a whole 8 years before Vile Bodies!This is only Christie's 2nd(!) published novel, and yet we get such fun dialogue as this:"Rot!" said Tommy hastily.
While I love Tummy and Tuppence, the plot of the story doesn't quite work for me.
Tommy & Tuppence sittin' in a tree...!A group of young Adventurers overcome several thrilling events in a tale jam packed with action, a story that deals with secret documents written by secret people that must be stopped by secret people in a very secretive way. The two novices stumble upon this, and their wits (both sexes are seen as equal in their cunning or charm) help them solve the puzzle. Agatha Christie is the equivalent of a warm pot pie on some cold, dreary evening... (aka better than this terrestrial form of hell....)
Youth is a failing only too easily outgrown.” I am willing to bet anything that Tommy and Tuppence are the two cutest wannabe detectives in the panorama of spy fiction in its entirety.
Yes, spy fiction: I dove into this expecting a crime story, instead espionage was the key word here.
I ended up enjoying it nonetheless because, as I said, the main characters are the most adorable creatures to ever walk the earth, and because Agatha still managed to make up for the naivety of the whole thing with a finale that is, after all, not so predictable.I will obviously read the next novels in the Tommy and Tuppence series, and the collection of short stories too.
Re read with  The Christie Carnage -noobs, middlings & hoity tots  WARNING: My thoughts are going to be scattered all over this review,  Why?
So the book most voted upon (roughly based on chronology of its publishing) was the  Secret Adversary , published in the year 1922 (this was after Mysterious Affair at Styles).Disclaimer: Prior to this I had never followed any chronology while reading her works.
The Secret Adversary gets only 2.25 stars from me.Having said that do not go by my verdict, Goodreads is teeming with good reviews.
Young Adventurers Ltd immediately put a notice in the London Times advertising their willingness to embark on anything – which probably wasn’t too sensible.
Their contact sent them to search for an elusive young woman who had been connected to the sinking of the RMS Lusitania by a German torpedo during the war – but the danger they would face made young Tommy and Tuppence realise it wasn’t all a game.The Secret Adversary by Agatha Christie is the first in the Tommy & Tuppence series and I quite enjoyed it.
A short and entertaining read-- entertaining as much for its mystery as for the laughable sensationalism of its topic.
Also, as in all good Christie, everyone's got their fingers in the pot somehow-- she manages to keep each character's critical discoveries secret from us until the end-- but even though we're lagging far behind most of the characters, we don't feel stupid because we, as the readers, have our own theories that we don't necessarily want to be spoiled.A very very short one.
Read it in an afternoon for a good laugh.
Description: After WW1, childhood pals Tommy Beresford and "Tuppence" Prudence Cowley lack money and prospects and become adventurers for the British Government.
Hersheimmer, powerful Mr Whittington, and an evil mastermind's conspiracy all seek Jane Finn who was given papers vital to peace by an agent at the sinking of the Luisitania.
The Lusitania had been struck by two torpedoes in succession and was sinking rapidly, while the boats were being launched with all possible speed.
The women and children were being lined up awaiting their turn.
Some still clung desperately to husbands and fathers; others clutched their children closely to their breasts.
Not the usual Christie mystery.
This is a John Buchan style ripping yarn with light-weight espionage and a heavy emphasis on adventure.Initially I found the plot so light on logic and the situations so uncharacteristically contrived and co-incidence driven that it made me look back at the cover to confirm if I was reading a Christie or a Wodehouse.
The mystery component, though not entirely unpredictable, was handled quite adeptly as usual.
Only Christie would be able to put me wise on how every other dialogue from the hustling Hersheimmer cracked me up.
An extra-star just for those crafty dialogues.
A cool read.
I’m a huge fan of Agatha Christie’s books!
I really want to read all her books and I think I will read another 5 books written by her this month.
About this book: It was a mix of suspense, mystery and in the end, romance.
The romantic part was a surprise considering that I’m not used to read books written by this specific author that include romance.
But this one had two couples and the romance was present, especially in the end.
But, to be honest, of course I’m not used with romance in Agatha’s books because I’ve read mostly books about Hercule Poirot.
"The Secret Adversary" ,was first published in 1922 and was the the first mystery that featured Tommy and Tuppence .Reading it brought back nostalgia of childhood summer holidays and trips to the local library☺☺.Also,it is surprising how out reading tastes evolve as we grow older .My younger self did not like this book much as her other books but this time I loved it 🤔

I’ve heard so many wonderful things about Agatha Christie’s books, but for whatever reason have never read one.
When I saw that James was holding an Agatha Christie Readathon for April, I jumped on the chance to try at least a couple of her books.
Though perhaps how they formed their friendship wasn’t what Christie was trying to portray.As far as the mystery aspect of the story is concerned, I would say that I was partially right in solving it toward the end.
It's exactly like you'd imagine the Famous Five would treat the case - lots of excitable running about, not a lot of appropriate respect for the fact that they are in serious danger for most of the novel...Tommy and Tuppence, the two detectives are demobbed after the war and find themselves with no plans or work.
All in all, kinda fun, but maybe not exactly in the way that Christie had imagined.I'd spotted the baddie fairly early on though, which surprised me.
It's an early Christie, but the previous novel had foxed me.
After the 1929 publication of The Big Four (which is nominally a Poirot, the plot of which, however, deals less with garden variety murder than with a strange, Austin Powers-esque international crime conspiracy), her publisher must have convinced her to abandon her not wholly convincing thriller career in favor of writing whodunnits, because she doesn’t write another international spy thriller until the second Tommy and Tuppence novel was published in 1941.I am of mixed emotions about this because I find her early thrillers (with the exception of The Big Four, which was absolutely terrible) to be weirdly charming in their innocence about the incompetence of the political criminal/international criminal mastermind.
Although I've read a huge amount of Agatha Christie stories I've always avoided the four Tommy & Tuppence adventures as they never looked very appealing to me.
Yes, I did get fed up with the amount of times that they referred to someone as "old bean" & it was a bit light & fluffy for my tastes.
I really love The Saint stories by Leslie Charteris, which began publication at almost the same time as this one.
Both are fairly light & easy reads, but somehow the adventures of Simon Templar seem a far better series of yarns to this humble reader.
2.5 stars.
I can tell this is an early work.
It feels kind of all over the place, though the plot does move along pretty fast.
The characterizations are kind of stereotypical (Julius!!) and I found it interesting how no one, including Tommy and Tuppence, who are pretty low on $ at the start of the book, is sympathetic to the concerns of the workers who are agitating (probably for better rights and conditions.) But there you go, no main character comes from the working class.I did like how quick-witted Tuppence was, and how she didn't sit around while others "sleuthed".
Well I can now say I have finished my first Agatha Christie and I can say that it went better than I was expecting.
But you have to remember this was a reflection of the time it was written in we have all moved on.So what of the book- it was a fun spy chase story more than the whodunit I was expecting which along with the actual enjoyment of reading helped shatter a few of my misconceptions and dare I say it biases I have held over the years.
It was, I suppose, delicious in 1922 for a mere woman to be the instigator of an adventurous life for the borning couple on the other side of the law; that she doesn't have to Pay Dearly For It is truly eyebrow-raising.Sixty years later, along comes Francesca Annis to embody Tuppence, and speak the faithfully adapted words Dame Agatha wrote.
It creaks, in other words, to more savvy modern ears, very much the way Mary Roberts Rinehart's books do, or Georgette Heyer's mysteries do.All that said, however, I didn't hurl the book aside or stop the film.
It also reminded me of one other aspect of writing that's easy to forget: sometimes it's okay to write about characters we like rather than those who come with the requisite list of personal problems and distasteful characteristics that constitute the current notion of realism.I guess what I'm saying is, I should probably have hated The Secret Adversary, but I didn't.
***2018 Summer of Spies*** I had great fun reading this, the second of Dame Agatha’s books to be published. It is refreshing for its lack of a plot formula, like those developed during her career and well established by books like Hallowe'en Party. It is also unusual in its featuring of a couple in the starring roles, Tommy & Tuppence. Plus it incorporates a relatively recent event, the sinking of the Luisitania (1915), The Secret Adversary being published in 1922. I was really struck, howe
I had great fun reading this, the second of Dame Agatha’s books to be published.
Of course it’s very unrealistic for two young amateurs to fare so well against the Secret Adversary, but it’s more fun than realism would have been.
It was just what I was looking for in a summer read—a rather fluffy & fun adventure.I also liked the author’s dedication: “To all those who lead monotonous lives in the hope that they may experience at second hand the delights and dangers of adventure.” I think she could have dedicated a great many of her books this way.
Not the one which gets hold of you and shakes through and through but good enough.It's a story of a mysterious teenage girl who's entrusted with important treaty and goes missing right after she gets handed it over to her.
) form together Young Adventures, a tiny organization to earn money in curious ways, fall right into the track on a very first day.
There's a secret organization, a shadow omnipresent bad boy who rules everything, adventure, courage, and constant doubt.
Sometimes stretched a little, the story shoots forward once the person in demand, Jane Finn is discovered.
All in all, a 3.5 star story.
Not enjoying this Tommy/Tuppence dynamic duo. The story itself is kind of rompy and gimmicky, trying too hard to be funny and lighthearted. Give me Poirot or Miss Marple instead!
But-- That is one thing that I absolutely love about books like this!
That's not the only thing I liked about this book.
No, indeed!I have been meaning to read Agatha Christie for quite a long time now.
They remind me of Nick and Nora Charles from Dashiell Hammett's The Thin Man, who I have loved for a long time now.I listened to the audiobook and-- everyone who listens to audiobooks probably can relate to this-- the narrator can often make or break a book for me.
(view spoiler)[I don't recall exactly, but I think "damn" & maybe "ass" are the only ones, but I do remember "damn" being used quite a bit throughout the book.
Being the first Agatha Christie novel that I've read in eons I must say that I thoroughly enjoyed this tale.
All in all it wasn't that mysterious per say but enjoyable nonetheless.
Well while chatting at a cafe a gentleman close by overhears them and thus begins their adventures...First a doomed ship, then a strange meeting, meet an unusually rich American, a German guy, a captured girl, the mysterious 'Mr. Brown', and then there's that Jane Finn who is Jane Finn and where is she?
I enjoyed this book with its twists and turns. The start is a bit slow but builds up very well. (Will try for a more detailed review later)
I really enjoyed this one and even suspected the right person to be Mr Brown.
Daha önce çizgi romanını okuduğum için sonunu hatırladım aslında. Yine de bence çok güzel ilerledi. Bu ikili benim Agatha’dan en hazzetmediğim dedektiflerdi ama o kadar da kötü olmadıklarını fark ettim. Yazılışı bir hayli iyi, tempo sürekli yüksek. Devam ediyorum ikiliye.
Dreadful. The mystery itself is far from mysterious—I had it figured out very early on—but the tone in which it is written is what really sinks this book. The unions and “common people” distrust the government only because they are manipulated into it by criminals, the government itself is filled with kind and upstanding men, and the criminals are cowards who enjoy writing grand declarations of their dastardly ways. Pah!The only saving grace to the book is the pair of Tuppence and Tommy, although even their charms fade by the overly pat ending.
Not my favourite Christie, enjoyable though.
