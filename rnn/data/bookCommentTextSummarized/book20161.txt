You have got to be kidding me.What author names her main characters, the members of the incredibly dark and dangerous black dagger brotherhood of vampire warriors....*inhales* ...Wrath, Tohrment, Vishous, Rhage, Phury and Zsadist?
You may get lured in by this exciting sounding black dagger brotherhood of vampire warriors, erotically charged dark fantasy stuff and the fact that Dark Lover is a big fat Goodreads hype.
However, what you see is not what you get; which is a silly written fluffy romance novel with large quantities of your typical fluffy romance novel sex (think; celibate, big, bad and totally handsome vampire king falls head over heels in love with this super-gorgeous 25 year old chick and makes her orgasm a dozen of times for the FIRST TIME in her life.
How to Write a Paranormal Romance  Step One : Create a SueThis is a female lead that can either be a Mary Sue, a Jerk Sue or a Sympathetic Sue. Just an FYI, most writers go with a Mary, as the ideal of women remaining virgins until they find “The One” is allegedly still vastly appealing to the masses. I suggest creating a heroine that’s never even been attracted to a man before. It makes it seem more like it's fate when she meets the male lead and less like you’re trying to shove antiquated bel
It makes it seem more like it's fate when she meets the male lead and less like you’re trying to shove antiquated beliefs down your reader’s throats.
You’re going for caveman here, modern women don’t want a partner that can communicate feelings or sympathize with emotions.
I suggest blaring Foreigner’s I Wanna Know What Love Is on repeat while writing this scene as it will really help you capture the emotion your readers should be feeling at this point.
Your readers don’t want cliffhangers or dead male leads.
Romance and sex?
At times the romance was almost sappy and the sex was good but I actually had expected it to be hotter (it's quality people, not quantity!).
But despite all of the above: I understand the attraction of the books!
I liked this book.
I might even be on the verge of loving this book.
And I really liked Wrath.
And I liked the rest of the boys.
And I want to read his book (#3).
So I'm buying book #2 (about Rhage) while I'm at it.
And I heard book #4 is about Butch.
And I want to read that too.
I fricking love this series!I cannot express how much I love this series, this book was probably one of the reasons why I admire J.R.Ward so much.
Usually after reading a book, I take a break from the series, read something else then come back to it, but this series just had me hooked.
I'm embarrassed to say this because it takes a lot for me to swoon and get a reaction, but boy did I need to have a break from Lover at Last (which is book #11).I'd recommend this series to anybody, it has everything; Romance, action, vampires, and easy to like characters especially Zsadist.
Kill IIIIIIIIITTT!" (less presumably) my mother whacked it triumphantly with a shoe.It is at this point that hundreds of small, though equally malevolent spider spawn emerged from the crushed remains of their mother, all equally intent on destroying me one little piece at a time.[image error]Each one was chanting this in their tiny babyspider voices as they rushed toward me with evil in their heart and malice in their eyes...I count this as the most traumatic moment of my life.
"Wrath was six feet, six inches of pure terror dressed in leather. His hair was long and black, falling straight from a widow's peak. Wraparound sunglasses hid eyes that no one had ever seen revealed. Shoulders were twice the size of most males'. With a face that was both aristocratic and brutal, he looked like the king he was by birthright and the solider he'd become by destiny."  *sigh*Fantastic start to the Black Dagger Brotherhood series! We get the world building, the awesome characters,
She realises how extraordinary he is, and falls in love with the fierce vampire King :))))As a human, Beth is pretty weak physically, and has no sex urges, until she sees Wrath :D Oh man and what a way to discover them ahahahhahahahThose two can't get enough of each other, even though it isn't rational, but when it comes to mates and their connection...
He wants Beth like no other before, and even though he fights it all the way, he knows he wants to mark her and make her his leelan.He is King, but doesn't feel worthy of the title.
Black Dagger Brotherhood is masterpiece, and it will always be =)  My feeling right now  :Allright, this is the first book that start my love for BDB series, and when I know this book will be translated a year ago (at February 2010), I'm excited!!
Alright, still I'm waiting, and then when the cover for translated version is coming up :I'm speechless and said :IS IT A JOKEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE?????????????
(Cut that crappy hair!)I'll buy this book to know about the translated version, because my friends said this book lack of romance..
It's your fault.All you Goodreaders.I was sucked in by the high ratings for this series.
Are you, J.R.Ward, trying to sell me this idea of love-at-first-sight-but-first-I'm-going-to-shag-him-senseless-to-be-sure, again????
I wish I had more of it.But surely there has to be more than just sex and filth to a good romance?I need suspense.
I need the romance to develop.
Goddammit I need a heads-up before the clothes come off.I will not continue with this series.
I will, however, keep this little red book on the bottom shelf should the need for quick filth arise in future.But I doubt it.
J R Ward’s BlackDaggerBrotherhood Series is beyond….............

I loved it even more than the previous times...Wrath and Beth are just an amazing couple.....I hope that the new book coming out in 2012 will have more about them....so gotta go....and start on Book 2.....Going through a vampire, paranormal romance period, I had been reading books in this genre but had never read any of JR Ward’s books until I picked up the first 5 novels in the Black Dagger Brotherhood series which were being sold at a discounted price.I began reading DARK LOVER, the 1st book in the series and could not put it down.

While there are no leather pants, I thought he was perfect:) This is my first "adult" vampire read.
I love alpha warrior heroes and this book is filled with sexy, male testosterone.
It was an intense; erotic, emotional read with just enough laugh out loud moments to make this near perfect.
5 Wrath's Leelan StarsFirst read 2014Reread March 23, 2017  SpoilersOMG I Love this book, this series and this Author! The Black Dagger Brotherhood is one of my top ten favorites series of- all- times. There is just something about this series that made me fall in love from book one. No matter how many times I read these stories they never get old. Dark Lover does an amazing job of laying out this new and exciting paranormal world. The Black Dagger Brotherhood world is a kick ass world filled wi
Dark Lover is Wrath's book.
Beth Randall Thought she was a normal boring everyday human, til a sexy tall dark "man" shows up, rocks her world and tells her she is half vampire.
Beth was sweet, understanding, supportive, but she was also sassy, independent, and didn't let people walk on her.
Beth was a great mate for Wrath.“I'm going to talk to her." "And how's that going to go?
Dark Lover is a great start to an amazing series and it does an epic job of pulling you in and making you fall in love with the brothers.
That's what you'd see."-Wrath and Beth
God, so that's how the Black Dagger Brotherhood series starts out, huh?
It only makes sense to read the series in order but at the time, I only had the sixth and seventh book on hand.
Nevertheless, Dark Lover is as solid as ever.Wrath, my man.
I love how she is able to keep her man in place.But most of all, I think the highlight of this book is Butch.
I cannot wait to read his book, Lover Revealed.
Damn, I love this series.
He dug his hand into his thick, dark hair.
Not staring at all.
Not staring at all.
With a name like Wrath, I was expecting some sensual sinning to take place, but all I got was a blind, leather duster wearing vampire thug who introduces us to ridiculous supernatural turf wars, rap music, and the f bomb.
This book was tragic.
I realize that Wrath is a vampire, but I can’t suspend my belief enough to buy into anyone, supernatural or no, being able to smell what someone looks like.
Actually please don’t, but seriously, if vampires don’t need to drink human blood to survive, why should they have to hide?
Do you seriously think I'd give a Freaking PNR Novel a 5-star rating of my own free will?
*eyeroll*AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!IT HAPPENED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I JUST GAVE FIVE FREAKING STARS TO A FREAKING PNR NOVEL!!!!!!!!!!AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!Note to self: breathe Sarah, breathe.Okay.
I believe I can touch the sky (view spoiler)[sorry, that wasn't me speaking, that was the alcohol I've been consuming to accept this new PNR-loving persona of mine (hide spoiler)].It's official people!!!!!!
Does my loving liking this book mean I'm human after all?
Maybe tomorrow (view spoiler)[Oops, I think the alcohol is speaking again (hide spoiler)].Note to self: focus Sarah, focus.
No offense girl, but you really need to get a life." ④ INSTA-FUCKING-LOVE.
I never got to borrow any copies (but then again I was kind of burnt out on vampires anyway), but the name did stick in my mind.Some months later, I asked one of these friends about the title of the books she loved, and she said they were part of a series called the Black Dagger Brotherhood.
Reading this book was like watching a really bad crime thriller that wallows in its own grittiness and has stereotypical characters, like the grumpy detective, the shallow heroine who can't help but get herself in trouble, the devoted vampire bride whose husband just won't reciprocate her affections, and various other oddball vampires who just so happen to be purebred or highly-trained and thus, are more awesome than civilian vampires.Oh, the characters… Sigh… Oy vey, in fact.The aforementioned shallow heroine is named Beth.
BR with the one and only Ash.   "We’re going to build us a civilization, my brother. Or rather, rebuild one.”  Blurb:  In the shadows of the night in Caldwell, New York, there's a deadly turf war going on between vampires and their slayers. There exists a secret band of brothers like no other-six vampire warriors, defenders of their race. Yet none of them relishes killing more than Wrath, the leader of The Black Dagger Brotherhood.The only purebred vampire left on earth, Wrath has a score to set
But, when one of his most trusted fighters is killed-leaving his half-breed daughter unaware of his existence or her fate-Wrath must usher her into the world of the undead-a world of sensuality beyond her wildest dreams.Note #1: I think it’ll be a little hard for me to separate the feelings and thoughts about this book by itself and not to think about what will happens as the story goes so I’m sorry if I spoil something for any of you or have mixed feelings about something that’s quite clear in this book.
I was disappointed by this book.
From the description, it sounded more like dark fantasy, but in practice, it's more like a romance novel of the cheesiest variety, only replace the generic pirate/naughty lord/auto mechanic human hunk with a vampire hunk.
The dialogue was overwrought, and the behavior of the man/men in question was extremely stereotypical when it wasn't extremely implausible (even given that we are theoretically talking about men of a different and non-existent-in-reality species).
It read like the sort of fantasy dreamed up by a teen-aged girl who has never actually had a great deal of contact with actual boys, let alone actual MEN.
Book one of the Black Dagger Brotherhood series...The Black Dagger Brotherhood is a group of vampires here to protect the vampire race. Wrath is the leader of this group- their king, by blood. Wrath was 6 feet, 9 inches of pure terror dressed in leather. Wrath is their King, but refuses to lead. He is a loner. A warrior. He doesn’t get too close to anyone. He has his band of brothers, but thats about it. When Wrath’s brother Darius asks him to help his only daughter (who is half human) with her
When Wrath’s brother Darius asks him to help his only daughter (who is half human) with her transition, Wrath refuses.
But when something happens to Darius, Wrath feels its his duty to honor his only wish.
Beth feels something for Wrath she has never felt before...
I loved Wrath and Beth together.
(hide spoiler)]And Beth see’s the beauty in Wrath.
This book isn’t only about Wrath and Beth.
I have a feeling I am going to LOVE some of the others after reading this one.
After this quote from Rhage, I can already tell I’m going to love him!
This one is not going so well. I am getting sick of the these great fighters that remind me of want to be thugs with their slang and cars and rap music. But to redeem them she tosses in leather? Seriously if I hear bro, what's up and WTF one more time I'm through. Not to mention a blind hero who can smell how the heroine looks????? Anywho I give it 25 more pages. Oh did anyone else skip the parts of Mr. X I just can't stand them... No screw it I'm done.
“You don't know this yet. But you are Mine” First time I read this book, I fell in love with it irrevocably. J.R. Ward revealed the sexy and badass characters from the very first page. Wrath, my beloved king, was not looking for love but when he looks upon Beth, his world is changed. The chemistry between them is beyond exploding. It's a dynamite destroying and crushing my sanity into pieces. “Welcome to the wonderful world of jealousy, he thought. For the price of admission, you get a splittin
First time I read this book, I fell in love with it irrevocably.
J.R. Ward revealed the sexy and badass characters from the very first page.
Wrath, my beloved king, was not looking for love but when he looks upon Beth, his world is changed.
So the story goes around how Wrath tried to push Beth away in the beginning, but she's irresistable.
I loved the ending, it's very exciting to see how the next book will pick up after the most sexy character, Rage.This is my second read.
J.R. Ward narrated her story very well making me feel every character and emotion.
Wrath and Beth  Whatever he had, she wanted."I thought we'd try this again," he said.His voice was low, a deep rumble in his solid chest. He had the sliver of an accent, but she couldn't place it."Who are you?" she breathed in a whisper."I'm here for you."  So...this is by far my favourite PNR series and it will be my favourite PNR series for ever and ever no matter where the story goes, no matter who dies and who lives, no matter who appears and who disappears, no matter who is paired with whom
They are tough boys, they can handle it.Anyway, I have decided to do another reread of the series and write a few of my thoughts for each book.
Because what I can write about something that I love so much?Honestly if it was possible, I would have liked to quote the whole book in my review...
I think that is normal after you read a book so many times.
this book:First of all, if you don't like vampires, don't even bother.
Third of all, if you don't like vampire romance, then really, don't bother.But if you do love you some vamps and some PNR, this is absolutely one of the best.
Each book follows the same formula: one hot vampire gets a "mate." They have to fight the bad guy in-between.
When I first read this, I was a newb to the PNR genre too, so it was like the best thing ever.
He smiled. “Hey, they like you.”“And thank God for that,” she murmered, looking down at the daggers. Well, I finally got around to reading about the BDB. Am I suddenly a Vampire Fan? Not totally, but I am fairly intrigued by the story. “You don't know this yet. But you are Mine- Wrath” I think if dear Butch was not present, I may not have continued with the series but I love his story and his banter with V.I have to wait until Book 4 to get his story.Think I am going to like “Z” too …Next in li

Reto #23 PopSugar 2017: Un libro con el lomo rojo Hace tiempo que no leía este tipo de historias paranormales con machos súper poderosos y posesivos, que exudan testosterona por todos sus poros, del tipo de los carpatianos de Christine Feehan o de mis adorados cazadores oscuros de Sherrilyn Kenyon.¿Qué decir? La historia tiene algunos fallos y bastantes incongruencias en el actuar de sus personajes… pero definitivamente entretiene, engancha y en muchas partes te deja con una sonrisa bobalicona.

Todos los personajes secundarios me gustaron mucho y espero poder leer pronto las historias de Zsadist y del detective Butch O’Neal.
'Fucking Awesome' doesn't quite cover it. Captivating HotEpicAmazing Feels more like it. Meet my sexy Wrath... Wrath is the only true purebred vampire left on earth. He's the leader of the black dagger brotherhood - the 6 strongest vampire warriors who defend their race from slayers. When one of his most loyal warriors dies, he has to make the last quest his friend gave him - protect his half vampire daughter...His touch ignites a dawning hunger that threatens to consume them both.This is how i
He's so sexy and sweet!But Beth sometimes got on my nerves - she was being mean to Wrath and i really felt like shutting her up and slapping her in the face.
He better get the best book, love story, and girl who isn't so afraid of him she's about to shit herself in the pants (I'm talking about ya Beth!), otherwise i'll go mad.
THE ENDING was action packedRomanticA tiny bit shocking (view spoiler)[When the brothers scarred Wrath's back in Beth's name for the mating ceremony.
And I loved the Brothers, their inter-chemistry with each other and Butch was what can only be described as cute - for serious want of a better word.I just don't know why so many authors think that a romance must be all "Oh, my love, you are everything to me..." and "Their eyes met and suddenly there was no one else in the world but the two of them".
Now that's literary romance for you.Okay, so before this review is completely taken over with my obsession love for the Fever series, back to the BDB.
I have officially popped my Black Dagger Brotherhood Series cherry!
Still kicking this series around on your to read lists.
I was just like you the sheer number of books in this series had me holding off starting.
The first book was easy reading, fast paced, exciting and fun!
Well these characters of the Black Dagger Brotherhood could be whatever J.R. Ward says they are and believe me I’ll read it.
This hot bunch of vampires were...CRAZY HOT.
I have a new appreciation for big vampire warriors who wear leather.
I fell for all the characters that were presented in this first book.

Lover Enshrined (#6)Rehvenge: Lover Avenged (#7)John Matthew/Tehrror: is (view spoiler)[ the reincarnation of Darius.
Lover at Last (#11)Blaylock/"Blay": Lover at Last (#11)SERIES:
I really enjoy her as a heroine, especially because I’ve seen her grow throughout the 11 books.Wrath makes a promise to an old friend to protect Beth.
(It bothered me the first time around, but I loved it the second time around.) Wrath tries to leave Beth to protect her from himself, but he just can’t stay away.
After reading this for the second time, I see how well Ward sets up her characters for future books.
I loved this book even more the second time because I know the characters so well.
2.5 starsMan, I'm super upset that I raised my expectations for this because Sarah J Maas recommended it.
The world building wasn't anything great, the characters were meh, it was basically just porn which I guess I should have expected but dang.
I'm still in shock that all of the characters' names were literally Wrath, Torment, Sadist, Rage, etc.
I guess one thing that I liked about this was that any time the main guy would try and be all like "you need to do this" or "i demand you don't do that" she's like "lol swerve ur not the boss of me" which was refreshing.
