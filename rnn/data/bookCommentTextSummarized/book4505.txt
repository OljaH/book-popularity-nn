كانت الساعة قد دقت الثانية عشر لتوها حينما هبط الدرجات دون ضوضاء و هو يرتدي حذاء التنس واجتاز المكتبة وخرج من النافذة كانت الرياح لا تزال تهب في عصفات قوية تتخللها فترات سكون مختصرة اندفعت السحب عبر السماء بفعل الرياح حاجبة القمر و هكذا كان الظلام و القمر الساطع يتواليان باستمرار
2.5 starsThis is the first book I have read in the Superintendent Battle series and it does not have 'Smart Poirot' or 'An Intuitive Miss.Marple' but instead has 'The Blubbering Novice Mr. Luke Fitzwilliam'.The start of this book is really promising, an old lady traveling on a train meets a gentleman (Mr. Fitzwilliam) and tells a tall tale about a series of murder that takes place in her cozy little village.
Here goes the Gentleman to the cozy little village to carry out his own sleuth work.
Choose Your Own Adventure!You are aged but you are no fool.
You are stronger than the foolish victims around you.
They never listen.
It will be the death of them, you say.
It is a mine field, it is a pit, it is a coal mine and the people around you are canaries.
Canaries die!
Poor little canaries.If you feel that murder is just another way of saying I Love You, then choose this adventure.If you feel that murder should be recommended by two out of three physicians as the easiest cure for what ails you, then choose this adventure.
With such a interesting hook, it’s a shame that this mystery thriller just felt flat.Whilst travelin
On one hand, I really loved the village setting, the old ladies and I even enjoyed the actual plot a lot.
The book starts off very interestingly with a chance meeting in a train between Luke Fitzgerald, retired policeman, and Lavinia Pinkerton, a fluffy village elderly woman.
Another extremely annoying angle is Luke suspecting a man called Ellsworthy, who is quite obviously gay and non-religious.
It made me severely dislike Luke, which didn't help.The murderer was fantastic, though!
The plot was otherwise brilliant and only lacked in its actual execution, though I am getting a bit bored of women being rescued by men at the climax in murder mysteries.
كان من السهل أن يقتل القاتل في هذه الرواية، ولكن من الصعب معرفته..متألقة كعادتها أجاثا ❤.

Former police officer Luke Fitzwilliam noticed on entering the train how much he was enjoying returning to England, and sitting indoors and resting from a long and hard life abroad.
She looked at the passengers in the train car and realized that the old lady sitting in front of her was not going to be quiet for long.
He quickly explained that the cop in the town where she lived was a fine person, was not very well-suited to deal with murders.Faced with Luke's doubt and astonishment, she explained that people can be deceived the first time, but not in the second, third, and fourth.
And if I can relate it to the above analogy of the sexy South American, this book is the equivalent of hopping in bed with this Brazilian hottie and discovering that OOPS...he pooped the sheets!Sorry, but "Easy to Kill" by Agatha Christie was a surprise frothy lumpy turd.
None of the characters are interesting (except maybe the spinster, and shes killed off right away).
Sorry, Aggie.P.S. If you happen to know a hot Latino man who ISN'T going to be a dud who leaves milkduds, send him my way, STAT!
He ends up talking to an elderly woman named Lavinia Pinkerton who proceeds to tell Luke that she is going to Scotland Yard to report someone she thinks is a serial killer in her village.
And when he then reads later that Dr. Humbleby is dead as well he decides to dig deeper into Wychwood under Ashe.Due to a connection that Luke has, he is able to pretend to be a cousin of a woman named Bridget Conway that lives there and is to be married soon to Gordon Whitfield.
Clear as day." Then the intentionally dim-witted Luke Fitzwilliam, the detective, starts his investigation and 100 pages later, I'm thinking, "Rather, clear as mud, but purposely so." Christie uses Fitzwilliam to pull all kinds of red herrings into the story, yet at 200 pages, we smart readers have already solved it anyway and we're simply enjoying the bumbling Fitzwilliam, who hasn't a clue to the solution or to much of anything.
And all along, we realize we were oh so wrong, starting on page 6.
This is a very good 4 star Christie, not her best but still better than 99% of all other "cozy murder mysteries" by any author.

This is another brilliantly plotted story by the author, and we as readers are misled for quite a long time.
On my own part when I was a young man I actually knew someone like this, who seemed to rejoice in tragedies befalling others "He/she wronged me and is now being punished...that's the way it should be," this guy would say even then, making him look guilty or responsible for bad things happening to others.
Hence Christie I think is psychologically spot-on here; and the irony is that such people practically can not hurt a fly...
This is designated as a Superintendent Battle book, although he doesn't appear until 85%, and he doesn't solve the case at all. It's better to think of it as a stand along, with Luke Fitzwilliam as the main investigator.This is not the top of the Agatha Christie heap, but it is a solid mystery. I enjoyed the way that Luke kept referring to his dear old Aunt Mildred, who is clearly in the vein of Jane Marple. This one also provides an easy comparison to Towards Zero, another Battle book with some of the same themes.
It was a fun read considering the twist in the end. And it's like being with Miss Marple but not really - because of the old woman in the story. The twist was really good!!! It was a revelation within a revelation. It's true what they say, you can never know with Agatha Christie... ;)
Bettie's Books
Something to know before jumping straight into Christie's works: She's written like a million different books so don't expect great characterisation or an emotional read - just follow the story for the murder mystery.
I picked up a few points here and there and was on almost the right track, but Christie still completely wowed me with her "murderer reveal", I suppose I can call it.
The story picks up momentum in about the last third of the book, at which point I decided to give up on any other plans I had for today because I just simply had to carry on reading to find out what would happen.
I've not read a lot of Agatha Christie, only one Poirot a long time ago.
I'm not a big fan of crime fiction, but as a classic I'll give it a merit for that.In its favour, the story was very fast paced and quick to get into, it's a good train journey read.
It felt a bit like a screenplay (maybe that's my modern bias knowing that lots of her books are now TV episodes).
But the writing feels either a little immature, or as if it were quickly published without a lot of editing.I would give it 3 stars for interest and intrigue.
It wasn’t alright. Didn’t expect this from Agatha Christie. I expect a smart detector and more fun way of observation. The characters were just ok, didn’t worth to read it.
Except for Ellsworthy's rather tacked-on occult connections, they were indistinguishable.-Though Wayneflete is kind of a confidante to Luke (and ultimately the murderer), I found her to be a very dull character.-Lord Whitfield was so pompous that he became a caricature instead of an actual character.-Rose Humbleby could have been a very interesting character.
The fact that Luke couldn't figure it out makes me question his abilities to perform as a police officer.I give it two stars because I liked the setup and Agatha Christie is an excellent writer.
Dieses Buch stellt sich für mich als komplette Enttäuschung heraus.Obwohl die Handlung durchaus flott und vielversprechend beginnt, verdross mich alsbald der inoffizielle Ermittler, Luke Fitzwilliam.
Er macht sich regelrecht zur Witzfigur, wenn er mit jedermann über seine Mutmaßungen spricht und sich allerorts anvertraut.Also wirklich, dieser Krimi ist in keiner Weise durchdacht.
Der Hauptakteur agiert lächerlich und beginnt schnell zu nerven; seine Verlobte bald nicht minder.
Ständig wiederholen sich die Erklärungen für das Verhalten einzelner Verdächtiger.
Superintendant Battle tritt nur wenige Seiten auf und ist auch nicht imstande, das Desaster zu verhindern.Dieses Buch hat mich wortwörtlich ermüdet.
عششق 😍❤ كالعادة ابداع اجاثا ومخيلتها اني جدا ممتنه لها اللحظات الممتعه التي اهدتني اياها في هذه الرواية
A good little mystery, I picked up one red herring (view spoiler)[ that Ms Pinkerton had told Luke that it was a man who was the murderer when I didn't remember her saying so (hide spoiler)] but I thought it was so obvious a clue that I didn't know if it was deliberately put there to be discovered.
The gradual reveal of the murderer was pretty chilling - murder in her books is often practical and prosaic, it's usually done for money or for intense personal reasons.
If you can put all of that to one side though it's a pretty good murder mystery.
I enjoyed this book more than I was expecting to. I liked the characters and the story was pretty interesting with a good ending. The way the characters speak is a bit different to today because this book was written 1939 and there were a few annoying spelling mistakes. Overall I liked it and would recommend it but unfortunately it has not converted me to being an Agatha Christie fan.

One of Christie's creepiest and most horrifying mysteries, about a crime spree in a tiny, adorable English town. (12+)*Please note: this review is meant as a recommendation only. If you use it in any marketing material, online or anywhere on a published book without asking permission from me first, I will ask you to remove that use immediately. Thank you!*
Eu pensei "Ora aí está, Agatha Christie, apanhei-te! Descobri o assassino, finalmente consegui acompanhar o teu raciocínio! Afinal és infalível! Descobri tudo! Muahaha". Só que não. Faltavam 30 páginas para acabar o livro. Obviamente que a rainha dos policiais não seria tão básica. E aquela pitada de romance? Amor algo instantâneo, mas ao mesmo tempo tão querido. Enfim, felizmente, não foi desta que ela me desiludiu.
This was rubbish. Are we sure Agatha Christie wrote this? The whole book was the world's dumbest policeman (Luke Fitzwilliams) walking around thinking about who committed the murders and he was continually wrong. He also didn't seem to care one bit about evidence either. Horrible.
Had me guessing right up till the end!Never trust an unhappy woman!
Uhádla som vraha!
:-)Policajt vo výslužbe stretne vo vlaku starú dámu, ktorá mu povie historku o vraždiacom monštre v ich dedine.
Keď si prečíta zvesť o jej smrti, poľutuje ju ale nevenuje tomu väčšiu pozornosť.
Keď však objaví správu o smrti muža, ktorého smrť mu predpovedala, jeho policajný inštinkt ho vyšle do dedinky opradenej povesťami...
vypátra Luke Fitzwilliam vraha?
Bol to pekný príbeh, typický pre Agathu, len snáď tej okamžitej a rýchlej romantiky tam bolo trošku (pre mňa) priveľa.
Bez Hercula, ktorý by tomu dodal trochu nadhľadu, mi tam trochu záverečný citát hrdinov, ktorí sa poznali tri dni aj s cestou, škrípal.
Ale inak výborná oddychovka.
