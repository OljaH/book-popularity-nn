Carr’s greatness is rooted in:*the strength of his dialectical method*his recognition of the vital nature of theoretical pluralism *the groundwork he laid for critical approaches to International Relations*and the case he made for the special nature of international politics as compared to domestic politics.
When all of these specific contributions are taken together they add up to a foundation for a discipline of IR that is beyond the parochial departmental politics of “choosing sides.” The last seventy years of theoretical debate have validated Carr’s employment of a mediation of dialectical oppositions.
In addition to Carr’s contributions to theoretical pluralism and his focus on the needs of international politicians, Carr also set important groundwork for critical IR theory.
Yes, that's right, we've got an English historian writing a book during the phoney war phase of WWII, and he is mad at the west.
We sought, collectively, to divorce international relations from power politics (that's right Woodrow, we are talking about you), and instead base the international system on such chimeras as "world public opinion" and the community of interests.
Carr is a member of distinguished class of British historians, including AJP Taylor and Trevor Roeper that lived through the two great wars and provided invaluable insight into their origins.
I learned so much!!!
One passage I highlighted that touches on several of the points he made:"Just as within the state every government, though it needs power as a basis of its authority, also needs the moral basis of the consent of the governed, so an international order cannot be based on power alone, for the simple reason that mankind will in the long run always revolt against naked power.
Power goes far to create the morality convenient to itself, and coercion is a fruitful source of consent.
To create these conditions is the moral task of the ascendant Power or Powers."
(Although keep your eyes on  global politics: a new introduction.) Carr is one of the twentieth century's great thinkers who writes in clean clear prose, who presents insights of great depth, and who does not underestimate the reader's needs.
It is enough to read the first six chapters and the conclusion to get what you might need from this.
Thucydides "Melian Dialogues" (in his  The History of the Peloponnesian Wars), and the first three chapters of Hedley Bull's  The Anarchical Society, Kenneth Waltz'  Man, the state, and War are all you need to set yourself up for an introductory course on international relations.
The characteristic vice of the utopian is naivete; of the realist, sterility.tis true...
A bit redundant and privileged; Carr really likes his dichotomies. Too dated to be more than a historical curiosity, but it was interesting to see the threads of where modern political thought - especially realism in international relations - came from. The first half dragged on, but the second half was more interesting.
Essentially, Carr believed the following:A neoliberal worldview is too idealistic to provide political thinkers with a realistic framework for strategising.A neorealist worldview is too grounded in reality, devoiding political thinkers of any goals, aspirations and tangible progress to work towards.I’m almost certain that the aftermath of World War I – that came at the cost of 40 million lives, a Versailles Treaty and revolutions across Europe – had contributed, in some way, to the bittersweet air of pessimism enshrouded within Carr’s book.What I found particularly genius about was Carr’s pre-World War II prediction that the next superpower to emerge would be an English-speaking nation.
No book expounding a realist view of international politics has been more influential and controversial than E.H. Carr’s The Twenty Years’ Crisis, 1919-1939: A Study in International Relations.
The upshot is a book that makes excessive demands on its readers, a book that continues to yield novel and startling insights into the structure and workings of world politics, generally and, more important for our purposes here, into the sources and conduct of American foreign policy in the second decade of the 21st century.http://www.theamericanconservative.co...
A political science classic and an excellent introduction to the field of international relations. Carr describes the rift between idealism and realism and the use of power. I'm glad that I finally read it -- it's constantly referenced.
Our job, indeed our God-given mission, is to give them the opportunity to slake that thirst at the pure well of American-style free enterprise and representative government.The disasters that have ensued from pursuing the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan to free their peoples from tyranny and bring them Western-style government has, happily, shaken the faith of many Americans in the wisdom of crusades of this kind—an appropriate word; weren't the original crusades attempts to bring Western values to the non-believers of the Middle East?It gives one pause at first, using the word "utopian" with regard to the Bush administration, but as Carr sees it utopian—as opposed to fact-driven—is what that kind of policy amounts to, i.e. an ideal- or idea-driven agenda.Next I decided to put the previous, Clinton administration under the same template and see how it matched up or failed to match up.
Instead, following a long history of realist thought, Carr notes that the struggle for power marked relations between nations during this period, and unlike the situation within nation-states, where governments and laws held sway, relations between nations was one of relative anarchy marked by the use (or threat) of force.
For someone new to the field, I recommend Carr’s work as an introduction from the realist perspective; i.e., the ability of each state to exert power—primarily by the threat or use of force—is the most reliable guide to understanding the interactions between states.
I’m much more interested in the theory, so my focus in this review will be the first half, where Carr explores utopianism, realism, and their intellectual genealogies.After the end of the Great War, a popular idea in diplomatic circles was that only irrationality and aggression could possibly start another war, and only the construction of a set of international institutions, like the League of Nations, could prevent a similar breakout.
Carr associates utopianism with the more intellectual strains in international relations, imputing the label to those with “the inclination to ignore what was and what is in contemplation of what should be.” Utopians put their moral ideals before political observation and empiricism.
This is an amazing book.
Timely as if it had been published yesterday!Reading this book has corrected two misconceptions I held:1.
Despite the title this is not a work of history, outlining chronologically the events that led to WWII.
Quite the contrary, actually, as it is more a work of history of thought and was finished in 1939.2.
This is a passionately argued appeal to recognize the need that there always needs to be a balance between realism and utopia, between power and morality.Carr must have had prophetic powers; so clearly does he foresee future events and trends and so timely are many of his observations.
Reading this makes you think that nothing has changed in the past hundred years - amazing!
I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed reading this, primarily because Carr uses the period between the wars (though he didn't know the Second World War was beginning as his book went to the printers) as a sounding board for his theories on politics and history. At the core of his argument is that politics, rather than being a choice between two pole-star theories, is rather a combination of both Utopianism and Realism. While I mostly disagree with his sentiment, critique, and conclusions, the intellectual exercise was stimulating.
I very much enjoyed reading this book as it truly represents the thought process behind our modern schools of thought regarding international relations theory. Carr is not afraid to criticize his own school of thought, which can be confusing at times but is undoubtedly helpful to getting a wholistic perspective about what explains interactions between nation states.
An Extraordinary book, helps reader understanding the essentials of International Relations and Politics.The book has an obvious philosophical dimension, yet the Ideas within are really easy and simple.
He not only discusses the utopianism of the inter-war period but attempts to explain why the prior 200 years were more ordered and peaceful: not because of how nations should act but the power relations at work, particularly due to British power, and the relative lack of conflict due to expanding markets and territories.
In reality, Carr sees this as an ideology that expresses the power of the status quo states that eventually broke down as new powers arose and overseas markets and territories dried up.
When the issues involve power politics, the states will act in ways that reflect their interests and their power.But how then to stop the scourge that plagues international relations: war?
Still the greatest book on international relations I've ever read.
This may be the only work on international relations (IR) from the 1930s that's still in print, and there's a reason for that.
This book is worth reading and rereading, for it is very sharply written and rich in theoretical insights about the fault lines of debate between the realist tradition and the idealist (or what Carr refers to as the "utopian") camp.
Contrary to the simplistic billing of Carr as a realist, the book presents incisive critiques of both the idealist and realist traditions.
For students of international relations (IR), this really is a book you must read.
In this book, Carr is criticizing what he terms the utopianism of the interwar years, and its attempt to attain abstract ideals at the expense of what was actually attainable at the time.
Instead, he asserts the need to acknowledge that morality is not separate from politics but an inherent part of it; politics is not derived from ethics, but ethics form politics.
At the same time, however, he does acknowledge that maintaining a "consistent realism" will allow for no room for peaceful change or partnership.
Carr provides an overview of international relations theory at a time when it was not a defined discipline.
The book itself is a basic overview of the tenants of international relations theory using the twenty years between the two wars as a case study.
For those who are looking for an entertaining and fun read of IR Theory this is a great place to go.
It has several updated introductions for the more serious scholar but Carr's work itself is a great study for those interested in IR and has a real love of it.
Biar masih di rak "to read" buku ini saya kasih bintang lima, karena merupakan buku klasik dalam studi HI. Saya mendengarnya melalui secondary sources buku teks lain yang terbit setelah buku ini. Carr merupakan generasi awal penstudi HI, ia sendiri berlatarbelakang disiplin sejarah.Di buku ini, ia membandingkan perdebatan antara Realisme dan Idealisme dalam studi HI. Masalah normatif masih sarat dalam diskusi ini. Konklusinya pun mirip sebuah jalan tengah dari kedua mazhab yang berdebat. Namun tetap penting, karena darinya kita bisa mengenal muasal studi ini sampai ke saya.Yo-ayo baca lagi!
A good snapshot in time just prior to WWII of the ultimate causes of international conflict and the relative merits of utopianism and realism from the British perspective. The author seems to adhere to the realpolitik mode of thought, though he is still hopeful for a kinder, gentler future. Central tenets are that political power consists of military, economic, and information ("opinion") control and that determining the balance of power is the key to understanding international politics.
Carr really does a good job of logically laying out his argument for a combination of realism and liberalism. He says that utopianism of liberals is devoid of an understanding of reality while realism is an overly deterministic view of the world as unable to be affected by the pursuit of an ideal. If the world is to pursue peaceful resolution to problems, it must acknowledge that both realism and liberalism are required - power and morality exist in harmony and must be accounted for.
Well argued book that made you think. Understanding the interplay between power and morality is still still relevant today as it was during the interwar period. Though things have changed some, I think Carr's insights are still useful. That said, he did leave a lot of questions unanswered, or maybe he did answer them and I just missed it...
Having been taught that Carr was a hard-core "realist" in the past, I was surprised to find Marxist and constructivist undercurrents in the book. The book was clear, concise and engaging for a largely theoretical work
This book is a must-read for any student of political science. It's also an ideal read for anyone with an interest in the history of liberal internationalism and (the problems with) liberal IR theory.
i want to read this book
A brutal read and not what I was thinking at all. I was looking for the causes to WWII and it was more a theory book. Oh well I did it.
Melhor livro para introdução no estudo de Relações Internacionais. Poder de síntese do historiador Carr é inacreditável
