**4 STARS.**My DamienMy NikkiHOT.
DAMN.Sexy, fast-paced (with a few moments that dragged a little in between), entertaining story.
It wasn't exactly a surprising read up until around 85% into the story, after that the story picked up and the ending made me really want to read the next part of the story soon.
Overall, it was an enjoyable read (mostly because of, let's face it, DAMIEN STARK, off course!
LOL) and the perfect follow up to Release Me. No cliffhanger.FULL REVIEW TO COME closer to release date.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~More Damien Stark??
Got an ARC, yay!!!!!!

I never thought in a million years I would get irritated and tired reading a book about Damien StarkBut DAMN this book was on another level!!Let's start of with the so called plot of this book- Nikki is still posing to complete the painting that Blaine is drawing nude of her for Damien.
Damien could have saved him but he didn't.Nikki tells him she doesn't care, she will standby him no matter what, he left her cos he didn't want to bring her into this and hurt her.Anyway he Loves her too(no surprise there)So the trial begins- and the book ends...
Of course, neither of them really wants to be released, they‚Äôre so completely absorbed in one another, they have an almost telepathic connection and we‚Äôre about to embark on an emotionally exhausting journey with them.Nikki is still tortured by the demons of her past, the need for pain never really goes away and the attentions of the paparazzi will push her to the limits of her ability to cope.
He cares so much for Nikki and is THE most attentive lover with scene after scene of delicious and kinky sex - it‚Äôs so incredibly hot, I‚Äôm surprised my Kindle didn‚Äôt catch fire, and, of course, it‚Äôs deeply, deeply emotional.
First off, I am a huge Damien Stark fan...
when it comes to the cliche of sexy, dominate billionaires, he takes the cake for me!
Plus I really like Nikki.
I was so happy to get an ARC for this one, and it didn‚Äôt disappoint!Damien and Nikki  There is nobody as fuckalicious as my Mr. Stark.
Nikki overcame so much in ‚ÄòRelease Me‚Äô, but she still has a ways to go.
Damien has proven to her that he cares for her, and he will continue to be there for her.

I was so happy to get an ARC for this one, and it didn‚Äôt disappoint!Damien and Nikki
He sees her pain, and he wants to help her, to take it away.
The painting is completed, and Nikki and Damien‚Äôs arrangement is coming to an end.
Fortunately, most of it isn‚Äôt between Nikki and Damien, it is things coming from the outside.
Damien has been there for Nikki, been strong for her.
Damien Stark has a lot of secrets.
He is understanding and caring when it comes to Nikki.
Damien and Nikki were scorching hot together!
I really love Nikki and Damien and have enjoyed their story so far.
But the beauty of this book is the fact that besides their problems, Damien and Nikki found peace and solace in each others arms.
;)Sexy billionaires have never been my most favourite topic (shocking, right?) but Nikki and Damien grew on me in Release Me and I fell in love with them in this book.
Also, in previous book we learnt that Damien has his secrets.
Moreover, I really love how possesive and passionate Damien is in this book.
Story may have been a little bit slow paced at the beginning but it was still enjoyable read.
DNF Sorry I just couldn't finish this book, I got until 24% and then it got to much. I'm all for sex in a book, I love it, but when you start over doing it and there is no real story I get bored. I'm sexed out hahahahaha! *********************************************************whooohoooh new release date from July to April!!! Freaking awesome :)
The painting gets finished as is Damien's and Nikki's time together.
Nikki's having to learn how to deal with the paparazzi and more importantly with Damien's secrets.
There's a whole lotta sex going on and mostly sex dealing with controlling Nikki...tying her up, spanking her, etc.
Nikki's very aware that she may have possible refocused her "need" of the other thing to her "need" for Damien.
And the way you look at me, as if there is nothing you could see inside me that would make you want to turn away.‚Äù‚ô• "When you know you want to be with someone you love, you want to get there as fast as you can."‚ô• "You are my blood; without you, I'm nothing but a shell."
As the passionate relationship between the ex-pro tennis player/star-businessman/billionare Damien Stark and a prosperous tech savvy Nikki Fairchild continues in the heat of a sexual and emotional exploration, the 'celebrity' pressure of the Stark name takes tool on Nikki, as the press drags out the past and puts them both into the whirwind of turmoil.And after some pretty shitty things happening, rash decisions that would only stir more hurt inspite the love that grows between them...thank God, it does prevail and it gives them both hope and strength to fight off the threath to their future.
Yeah, in fact, Damien, I do.
*wink* and so does Nikki.Joy to the world...On to the final part.üëç
Claim Me is the sequel to Release Me which I recommend you read first. Nikki Fairchild and Damien Stark‚Äôs game has come to an end. She is a million dollars richer, the portrait is completed and the couple‚Äôs relationship is still hot and steamy. Parting ways isn‚Äôt even on the table for either one of them.  "No," he says. "I want to be clear. I don't want our arrangement to end. You're mine, and there are rules. And I want our game to continue." But can they have a relationship? This couple has A
Nikki Fairchild and Damien Stark‚Äôs game has come to an end.
It seemed that every scene that they were together in ended or began with claiming each other.
Nikki has been open to Damien both emotionally and physically from the beginning of this book.
I‚Äôm still thinking of some of the open story lines with characters like Ollie, David, Sophia and of course Damien‚Äôs father.When Damien finally decides to come clean to Nikki about what he has been hiding I was shocked.
The ending is a cliffhanger, our couple is left in a difficult situation but their relationship is...
If you thought Release Me was a whole bunch of hotness, you will not be disappointed in Claim Me. The continuing story of uber hot billionaire Damien and his beautiful, albeit emotionally scarred lover Nikki.
In Release Me, Damien contracts with Nikki to pose for an erotic painting for the bargain price of one million dollars.
Damien is still the arrogant, controlling, mesmerizing man from Release Me. His presence in a room almost magnetic.
He needs that feeling of control and the assurance that Nikki will never leave him.
I am not supposed to review this one until closer to release date...so pretend not to read my review for a few weeks!OH Damien, you broken man.
I absolutely loved Damien in this.
Damien and Nikki take things to a whole new level in the bedroom as their "deal" comes to an end.
Toward the end things really heated up.
So here is my rundown on the last 25% of the book.First off there were some big secrets revealed...And then things got a little emotional...And then Nikki pulled some spine out...Then things get heated and the gloves come off.
I loved the end.
Review to Come.....  Damien...... [image error] Nikki...... [image error]ARC Received by Random House Publishing via NetGalley
But one thing is still missing, Nikki needs for Damien to open up to her wholly as she has done for him.
"You belong here,"he says.
In the first book, we saw the tough upbringing that Nikki tried to deal with in a way that wasn't healthy.
I loved Damien and his willingness to try for Nikki.
He wasn't perfect but he was able to show how strong he was, even if what he was doing resulted in them getting hurt.Nikki really impressed me in this book, she seemed tougher and more confident than in the last book.
Even Twilight doesn‚Äôt feel so far removed from this novel, and yeah, you‚Äôre not really all that much better either.
She actually feels like a real person, possibly even the girl the next door, if she had been a pageant model from the age of six, with a brow-beating, ball-busting, drill sergeant for a mom, and a body built for sin.Frankly, she, along with the meteor shower sex scenes, kept me reading the pages in some heightened state of awareness that nearly had me calling upon the ghost of Marilyn Monroe for emotional support.
'Claim me' is the hotly awaited sequel to 'Release me, and continues the story of Damien Stark and Nikki Fairchild, who continue to explore their new and extremely steamy relationship.In this book Nikki, who is still trying to come to terms with her own demons, is also still trying to unravel the secrets that Damien holds close to his chest.

'Claim me' is the hotly awaited sequel to 'Release me, and continues the story of Damien Stark and Nikki Fairchild, who continue to explore their new and extremely steamy relationship.In this book Nikki, who is still trying to come to terms with her own demons, is also still trying to unravel the secrets that Damien holds close to his chest.
I loved that in this book we got to see a few cracks in his usually immaculate armour.Unfortunately it wasn't a five star read for me simply because the first part of the book felt like it was a scene setter for the third book in the series.
In the second book of Stark trilogy, the painting is finished, the one million is payed, but the relatioship between Damien and Nikki is far from finishing.
There is more sex, more kinky appetites, more bondage, more lovers games in public places, more romance.At the same time their relationship starts driving the attention of paparazzi.
All the secrets are tangled and the two lovers are strong one time and they make stupid decisions the next time.
There is also a public declaration of love, which I adored.Nikki proves to be stronger than I imagined she was in the first book.
Nikki wants Damien to open up and share his troubles and worries with her and at moments you see them deal with their demons, but then it would not continue.Nikki, I thought and hoped, would be a little more secure in the second book.
I do love Damien Stark AND I can never get enough of books where the billionaire/CEO falls in love with the normal girl that does not know how beautiful she is.
How can you not look forward to more Damien Stark???!!!Pace of the story: Okay.
I wish some of those secrets were discovered a little bit more in this book.
We learned a lot about Nikki in Release Me , Damien got her to open up and talk to him about her past .
I love how Nikki is there for Damien in this book , she listens to him, lets him open up to her at his will and she does not push him to tell her anything he is not ready to tell .
Damien does all he can and does not want to tell Nikki all and you can clearly see it is simply because he is trying his hardest to protect her .
I was happy to see that Damien did open up more to Nikki in this book .
Beautiful. And it just keep getting better! ‚ÄúYou have captured me utterly, and you hold my heart in your hands. Be gentle with it. It's more fragile than you might think.‚Äù The plot twists keep twisting and turning until you can't even wait to turn that next page.
Okay, So I'll probably have to be really cryptic in this reveiw seeing that I read an arc and the book won't be released for another 2 weeks or so. But, I can't imagine holding back on my review for that long, because one, I'll forget to post it or two, it won't be accurate as I have so much stored to say right now. Cryptic it is then. :)Meet Mr. Damien Stark...  "There in nothing about you that I could ever forget. You are burned into my memory. your hair glittering in candlelight. Your skin, d
Okay, So I'll probably have to be really cryptic in this reveiw seeing that I read an arc and the book won't be released for another 2 weeks or so.
And the way you look at me, as if there is nothing you could see inside me that would make you want to turn away." 
Let's just say that Damien has a way with words and....other things.
Damien and Nikki come together so much in this book...Ummm(pun intended), with that said let me carry on with they grow as a couple as well as individually.
This one has left us needing that book in a desperate sort of way.
5 (Shhhh) Secretive and Sexy Stars!!!J Kenner you are much nicer than I would have been had I wrote Claim Me. You could have had the BIGGEST CLIFFHANGER in the history of cliffhangers!!!!
(Now I know how Nikki feels.)When I read Release Me (which by the way I looooooooooved), I found that I was really excited about‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ well, EVERYTHING.
With Claim Me, I found myself drawn more to the relationship Nikki and Damien have ‚Äì it‚Äôs not about the sex (by NOOOOOOOO means does it detract from the story ‚Äì hahahahaha), it‚Äôs about the two broken people that they are, their NEED for one another, and the (*whispers*) secrets.
My casting for Damien:It‚Äôs no secret that I ‚Äú5-star‚Äù loved Release Me. Damien Stark is my all-time favorite billionaire bad boy with a trouble past.
No more game, no more rules, no more safewords, no more ‚Äúsir.‚ÄùWhile the game may be over, neither Damien nor Nikki want their relationship to end.
But Damien is still a very private person with a lot of secrets that he does not share with Nikki.
They are relentless and bombard Nikki with questions every chance they get.
Questions about her past.
Questions about Damien.
Some questions were answered, but Damien still has a lot of secrets.
Lastly, the erotic elements of that story weren‚Äôt all that inventive.Because of the incomplete ending, I was committed to giving the series at least one more book for redemption and it was a really good decision.
It starts where the last story ended, with Nikki continuing her arrangement with Damien, although by this time, the two of them are completely aware of the depth of their emotional connection.
Damien didn‚Äôt lack creativity here and it was...you‚Äôre just going to have to read it for yourself.
I liked the story, the developing Damien, the bright, intelligent and interesting Nikki and loved their intimate moments that challenged my imagination.
"He is power personified, energy harnessed. And my only fear is the knowledge that one can neither capture nor hold on to a lightning bolt, and I do not want to lose this man."  This singular quote, although used by J. Kenner to describe Damien Stark himself, coincidentally depicts the entirety of Claim Me. This book is 350 pages of pure electric spark.I loved this book so much that it is the only thing that finally persuaded me to complete my Goodreads profile and write my very first book rev
After finishing Release Me, I considered myself "Damienized" for sure, but after reading some of the hot things that go down between Nikki and he in the first few chapters -- cords, fondue, more drapekink -- not only do I have #StarkOnSpeedDial but he's also topping my Permanent Book Boyfriend list and I regret nothing.It's so rare to come across an erotic lit series that doesn't sacrifice well-written characters and a modern, believable plot for smoldering hot sex scenes, but with Claim Me, Kenner works her magic yet again and gives readers both.If y'all need me I'll be busy pouting until I can get my hands on Complete Me. Siiiigh.
DNFHere is what has happened so far.
Damien takes a phone call that makes him unhappy.
He STILL has a secret.
Nikki wants to know his secret, but feels bad about prying.
The perfect Nikki facade can't hide the fact that she still wants to know what he's hiding, so she apologizes to Damien.
She apologizes?
Because  absolutely nothing  has happened in the past 6 chapters to actually move the story forward.
3.5 starsI rarely make it through book 2 of a novel-length, cliff-hanging trilogy, so finishing this is an achievement.
I struggled a bit in the middle as it started to slow down a bit.
Too much sex and not enough story--and I NEVER say that.
But the sex scenes began to grow same-ish and dull.
Anyway, thankfully the story picked up towards the end.
Also, what is the big deal regarding the blow up at the end?
I'm being purposely vague, much like this story is.Excuse me for my crudeness, I'm just feeling a bit silly cuz it's Friday.
