ONE STAR ⭐ for me because I finished it! This book is trying so hard to be controversial. Instead, it's an epic fail. I'm not in the HATE it or LOVE it camp. I'm in the incredibly bored and what is the point camp?.In case you've been busy reading a good book (lucky you!) and missed some of the pre-hype, BABY TEETH is the story of a creepy seven-year old mute girl, Hanna, who hates her mommy and wants to kill her.

I'm in the incredibly bored and what is the point camp?.In case you've been busy reading a good book (lucky you!) and missed some of the pre-hype, BABY TEETH is the story of a creepy seven-year old mute girl, Hanna, who hates her mommy and wants to kill her.
Hanna: silently plotting and planning her next mean thing to do to mommy.
It's just dumb.There is something missing with this book, there is nothing there to hold your interest.
I feel like Hanna should have been written with more of a horror bent, at least it would have spiced up the plot a bit.
My reviews can also be seen at: https://deesradreadsandreviews.wordpr...OH MY ….I have no words.HA! Yeah right!!Hanna LOVES her Daddy. Her Mommy?Not so much….This first thing I’m going to say about “Baby Teeth” is that it won’t be for everybody. And that’s OKAY! I’m not going to judge anyone for liking it OR not liking it. It’s a fiction book!It does clearly say in the description: “From blazing new talent Zoje Stage, Baby Teeth is a story about a perfect-looking family, and a darling little gir
Her Mommy?Not so much….This first thing I’m going to say about “Baby Teeth” is that it won’t be for everybody.
A book about a child wanting to kill their mother is not going to be light suspense…it’s likely going to be an uncomfortable read.
Hanna knows how much Mommy wants her to talk.
I’m very curious to see what Zoje Stage is going to come up with next.Thank you to St. Martin’s Press for the opportunity to read this book in exchange for my honest review.
NOTE: I DO NOT KNOW HOW THIS BOOK ENDS - perhaps a girlfriend will tell me later - save me the reading time - so that I can move on to a book that is a better fit for me.....Lots of SAMPLES to get a TASTE of what you’re in for if you choose to read this novel:Mom says:  “She never liked me.
Hanna says: .....Thinking to herself  “It remained disappointing that Daddy hadn’t let mommy wither and die when he had a chance”.
there is not much I can’t hear - but I’m sorry - I just didn’t want to read any more.
Whether you hate it or you love it, you won't be able to stop talking about it.
Here’s the catch: Hanna only behaves this way toward Suzette; nary a complaint toward her father, Alex.
The more alarming Hanna’s behavior becomes, the more sophisticated Hanna becomes at the art of manipulating her father, or as she likes to call him, her daddy.
Hanna wants her daddy all to herself.
This book will surely be controversial and will likely be the subject of many heated debates among book clubs everywhere.
what will happen?this is the story of a seven-year-old girl named hanna who loves her daddy SO MUCH that she doesn’t want anyone else taking up any of his time or attention.
it’s compared to We Need to Talk About Kevin, which i haven’t read, and The Dinner, which i have read and did not like, but i’m not sure these books are all playing to the same crowd.
because while, yes, they all have “kids doing reprehensible things” at their center, it’s carried out in different angles of approach.
One of my favoritest thing in the world to read about! When my book bestie and fellow weirdo found the synopsis for this book, we knew we had found one that our little shriveled hearts would adore. So I'm deeply thankful for her begging on my part to get my grubby hands on a copy of this one.Hannah loves her Daddy. He spoils her even if she doesn't say a word. She gets kicked out of all the preschools and the doctor's can't find anything wrong with her. She is still her Daddy's girl though and t
So I'm deeply thankful for her begging on my part to get my grubby hands on a copy of this one.Hannah loves her Daddy.
Except that dream child is starting to really freak her out.This book takes you down a dark hole into a disfunctional family that might make you appreciate Aunt Bernice farting at the dinner table.
You can't win.
Booksource: I received a copy of this book from the Publisher.
Pure win!
(I loved it all on my own)PS This book is on Netgalley as of 1/20/18 if you guys want to run and try and grab it.
Suzette is the target or her daughter, Hanna’s, "bad" behaviors.
Hanna begins to speak to her Mother and really wants her father all to herself.
I thought of the movie, "The Good Son" while reading this book.
Hanna is creepy, and this book is a fast read but most of the actions felt "gratuitous" and there for shock value to move the story along.
There are a lot of negative behaviors, actions and thoughts in this book that it almost became too much.
Some may also be turned off by the way Suzette speaks to her child.
(Well, that's not 100% true: I think the book's title and cover art are phenomenal.) It was just so melodramatic and implausible that I found myself doing the deepest of eye rolls on more than one occasion, and turning the page became a harder and harder task the further I got along in this novel.The premise of this novel is very simple: A seven-year-old terrorizes her mother but puts on an innocent face for Daddy, driving a wedge between the couple and driving the mom to desperation.
4 controversial stars🌟🌟🌟🌟*** I am updating my rating to a solid 4 Stars for the following reasons....• I read this book in February and it has stayed with me over the last six months and as much as I read that absolutely says something!• I allowed other peoples opinions to sway my own when it came to this book, and that was not fair to the book or to the author!*** I still stand by every word in my review, this was a very compelling and engaging read for ME!I believe I’m going to bust out my complement sandwich for this review...
The problem is that Hanna is a complete psycho, doesn’t talk, and behaves so badly, she’s continuously kicked out of school and Suzette has no choice but to home school her.
As I mentioned, Alex, Hanna’s dad, never sees the disturbing behaviors.
The person who deals with Hanna on a daily basis is Suzette and this is what made me so uncomfortable throughout the book.
Alex refers to Hanna as his ‘squirrely girl’ or ‘lilla gumman’ and it seems like no matter how much he loves Suzette, he just doesn’t believe that his daughter is a psychopath and consistently makes excuses for her.
Is aberrant behavior the result of nature or nuture ?
Hanna is seven years old and silent which make her thoughts and consuming love for her father all the more chilling.
Manipulative and malicious, Hanna has one goal and it isn’t pretty.
On occasion I felt empathy for Hanna until she acted out in ways that were unimaginable.
Child from hell aside, this book is also about the perfect facade of a dysfunctional family and the sinister telling of mangled psyches.
Pathological behavior has to come from somewhere, doesn’t it?
I’m not going to tell you about that.
For some reason I thought this book was going to be about an evil baby that ate people. I mean Baby Teeth right? . . . This was NOT that fun book. What the hell was this book!? There is a plus side! 😄Happy Reading! Mel 🖤🐶🐺🐾MY BLOG
"There’s nothing scarier than loving a child and not understanding what they’re trying to tell you—” There's not enough room in the house for both Hanna and her Mommy! Seven-year-old Hanna would be so much happier if Mommy would just disappear so that she and her Daddy could live happily ever after. Through Hanna and Suzette's (Mommy) eyes, we see their daily battles to maintain control in an unpredictable, ever-changing world and what it's like to maneuver through life when no one will hear yo
Through Hanna and Suzette's (Mommy) eyes, we see their daily battles to maintain control in an unpredictable, ever-changing world and what it's like to maneuver through life when no one will hear you.
She told herself she would never be like her own inattentive mother, but she's completely blindsided when she's dealt a different version of the same hand.• Hanna's parents can tick all the boxes on a “Signs that Your Kid Might Be a Sociopath” list.
Nothing in the story indicates Alex and Suzette think that it would be an appropriate thing for Hanna to see.
Mothers are daughters....Hanna is 7 years old and Daddy’s little girl.
Her world revolves around her love for dear daddy.Now her mother...well, that’s another matter.
If only mommy wasn’t around...if only she didn’t have to share daddy with her.
Suzette loves her husband more than anything in this world.
They have a daughter, Hanna, who she desperately wants to love too.
Hanna is only seven.
Sweet little Hanna, or emotionally exhausted Suzette?
As the hurtful acts between mother and daughter escalate, reading this book became more difficult.
So hard to imagine a seven year old child plotting and carrying out the despicable acts that she committed.
This novel is described as a thriller.
It’s told from the point of view of an exasperated stay-at-home mom, Suzette, and her seven-year=old daughter, Hannah.
Suzette has no choice but to do her best to home school her.
She has battled debilitating health issues of her own since high school and having this out-of-control child is not helping her physical or mental health.This is not a fun read.
I’ve read stories of kids who are physically and emotionally abused by a parent, and still the kid professes love for his or her parent.
FLOAT BECAUSE IT'S THIS BABY'S BERFDAY!!!!!Find all of my reviews at: http://52bookminimum.blogspot.com/This book doesn’t come out until Summer of 2018, which really sucks - - - FOR ALL OF YOU!!!! Did you fall for that????? In all seriousness, when I made a placeholder This Is America, I Want It Now “review” it was more like me channeling my inner Oprah and putting this out into the universe à la The Secret in hopes of winning the Goodreads Giveaway. When I received an e-mail from St. Martin’s P
I’d love to say more, but I’m pretty sure my next communication from St. Martin’s Press would go a little summin like .
Then all you fellow weirdos have to go get a copy, read it and come back so we can talk about Hanna and Mommy under spoilsie code because I have sooooooo many things I want to barf out all over here about my thoughts and feelz.
Teeth or no.Not going to lie I did not care for this at all.
For those of you who do not know, Baby Teeth is the story of Hanna, a little girl who is determined to kill her mother.
Of course any story of this nature is going to be an uncomfortable read and I was very aware of that hurdle from the onset.
The story is told through two perspectives; that of Hanna, the little girl and her mother Suzette.
Sorry folks but for me this was a shallow basin.As always my thanks to St. Martin’s Press, NetGalley and Zoje Stage for an opportunity to read and review this book.
While Suzette tries to come to terms with this, Alex is oblivious and sees only the princess-like girl that Hanna presents on a nightly basis.
Fans who enjoy a diluted psychological thriller may enjoy this one, as its presentation has rounded edges and light spine tingles.When this novel was recommended to me by a friend, I wanted to give it my full attention, not only because of its subject matter, but also because it would fit perfectly into a reading challenge requirement.
As the story progresses, Hanna’s character turns darker, especially with the revelation of an alter-ego, though things always bounce back when Alex is in the room, which only perpetuates the tug-of-war between the parental units.
When I wasn’t reading this book, I was thinking about it.BABY TEETH by ZOJE STAGE is a disturbing, uncomfortable, and downright creepy tale about a 7-year-old girl named Hanna that wants her Daddy all to herself but her Mommy (Suzette) stands in her way of her happily ever after.
What I didn't like…..The only thing that I questioned here though was if a seven-year-old was actually capable of doing some of the acts that she did in this book.I was totally immersed in this tale and found it quite the entertaining and enjoyable read but I do understand that this book will not be for everyone so with that I recommend with caution.
Like, dayuum!!Dennis asked me how I was feeling this story.
I was pissed, grossed out, felt creeped out and had me looking at my own child like, huh🤔.
Sweet little Hanna is 7 years old and is silent.
She loves her daddy, Alex, so much.
This is told in alternating POV between Hanna and Suzette.
Suzette has to homeschool Hanna because she is mute and has been kicked out of multiple schools.
Once Suzette starts mentioning to Alex about their daughter’s behavior he doesn’t believe it.
I was like, yassss, Suzette get it!
Creepy child?
This is one of the creepiest books I've ever read.Hannah is seven years-old and the daughter of Alex and Suzette.
She loves her dad but dislikes her mom.Hannah would love to have her dad for herself and starts taking the steps to see this happen.
That's the premise of the book and all I can say without getting into spoilers.
Suzette suffers from Crohn's disease and I found the author described the illness and its symptoms very well, although I don't suffer from it I was able to easily capture the character's constant pain and anguish.Overall, I found the story to be disturbing and had difficulties liking or relating to any of the characters but I still recommend it to readers of psychological thrillers and suspense.
3.5 Stars. Oh dear.....talk about a BAD seed. BABY TEETH is quite a horrific story and debut offering....definitely NOT for everyone. I thought I knew where the story was headed...twice....from little hints here and there, but NOPE, the author takes the reader to yet another place....the mind of a disturbed and violent child.Seven years old (going on seventeen) Hanna is very astute and conniving, but shows only angelic sweetness to daddy....she REALLY loves her daddy. As a matter-of-fact, she wa
I thought I knew where the story was headed...twice....from little hints here and there, but NOPE, the author takes the reader to yet another place....the mind of a disturbed and violent child.Seven years old (going on seventeen) Hanna is very astute and conniving, but shows only angelic sweetness to daddy....she REALLY loves her daddy.
Hanna is seven years old and has yet to speak.
She does manage to communicate, though, through malice toward her mother, Suzette.
How can Suzette deal with her daughter's psychopathic tendencies when no one believes her?I got this from Netgalley and the promise of a creepy homicidal kid lured me in.
I was a little disappointed.Like I said in the teaser, Hanna is seven years old, mute, and wishes violence death upon her mother.
It sounds interesting but I was ultimately bored by most of it.Alex, the dad, is unbelievably oblivious and I thought Suzette was kind of a doormat.
*Happy Dance*Let's meet sweet little mute Hanna, the apple of her Dad's eye, her mother's worst nemesis.
Until one day when Hanna does speak to her and this is when things start to get pretty freaking creepy.
When Suzette starts explaining to him what Hanna is like during the day he usually just brushes it off as her over reacting.
I think this is going to be a very popular book in 2018!Thank you to Katie Bassel & Jordan Hanley @ St. Martin's Press and NetGalley for giving me the opportunity to get my greedy little hands on this ARC early!
I’m reading this book as a mom and I cringe at what Hanna does.
Hanna resents her mom for wanting to send her away to school and leaving her home alone with strangers (babysitters).
Suzette tries to be a good mom with patience and rewards for good behaviors, but it’s just impossible not to lose it with Hanna.
Suzette questions her parenting while Hanna makes plans and calculates her next move.A well written thriller, this book can be a mind blowing read.
Only Suzette and her daughter Hanna are aware of it.
His daughter Hanna acts like an angel when she is with him.
Suzette is scared and well, she should be.“Baby Teeth” is a suspense novel by Zoje Stage.
For me, there were things about this novel that just didn’t quite add up and on the whole it just wasn’t for me.
That said, it was an extremely quick, easy read and I got through it in a day.Thank you to NetGalley, Zoje Stage and St. Martin’s Press for an ARC of this novel in exchange for an honest review.
Published on NetGalley and Goodreads on 2.3.18.
Reading Baby Teeth by Zoje Stage was a whole different experience in the coulee for me.
I really don’t know what coulee I ended up in with this very different book from any that I have ever read before.Baby Teeth is a dark domestic suspense that I recommend with caution.
Or maybe even turning those pages as fast as you can and wish you would have closed the book when you had a chance.
Overall I enjoyed Baby Teeth but it did leave me with not too much to say.
3.5, well I'm never having a child now stars!!Full review featured on my blog Recipe & a Read!We begin our story with Suzette.
Suzette is a stay at home mother to her daughter Hanna, a doting and loving wife to her husband Alex and to say the very least: girl is strugglin'.
However, as the story progresses Hanna has finally started to speak but she wont speak to anyone but Suzette and what she has to say is deeply disturbing.
While many of the exchanges between Hanna and her mother are creepy and sinister and added suspense to this read, it became redundant and honestly kind of boring.
Suzette is homeschooling her seven-year-old daughter Hanna.
Her daughter is highly intelligent but has severe behavioral issues and rarely speaks.
Her behavior is uneven with most of the volatility directed towards her mother.
When her father is around she is well behaved and loving.Hanna adores her father and doesn't want to share his attention.
Alex never witnesses any extreme behavior and wonders who is really at fault.
Suzette is in a constant battle to convince her husband that something is terribly wrong with Hanna.
As a reader, I love books with an edge and Baby Teeth hit my sweet spot.
let me see what all this Baby Teeth business is all about.
Let's just say Hanna wants to murder her mother...
can I start off with the school issue with Hanna in the book.
come on every school just kicked Hanna out after 1-2 behavior incidents?
This to me was very unrealistic and was a tad annoyed with this.Additionally, I'm not sure if this was the author's intention but Hanna's obsession with her father was borderline sexual?
Thank you so much to Netgalley and St. Martin's Press for the opportunity to read this book in exchange for my honest review.Published to GR: 6/10/18Publication date: 7/17/18
