I loved writing this and I hope you love reading it too.
It's a lot about real life, and I'm influenced by fables too.
Remember when you used to sit on your parents' knees for story time.
You just enjoyed them.
So, thats what I did for Arthur - I wrote his story straight from the heart and gave him a poignant, fun and adventurous journey.
Happy reading!
If you enjoy this book, you'll probably like my second book Rise and Shine, Benedict Stone (known as Wishes Under the Willow Tree in the UK), too x
I love small books--happy books--easy-to-read, relaxing books. "The Curious Charms of Arthur Pepper" was all of these things. Actually, it was like going on a vacation with good friends and coming home well-rested and contented.This is the book that you choose, when you get stuck in the same genre or nothing strikes you as interesting. It's for everyone at any time. It's a little treasure that was a joy to experience!It may be Phaedra Patrick's first novel, but I'm hoping it won't be her last.
Author Phaedra Patrick gave us her gift with this charming- inspirational- book - literally and figuratively!
A charming story ..........about a charming man named Arthur.....about a ‘charm bracelet’ ( I HAD NO IDEA - I had not read the reviews), that Arthur finds which belonged to his deceased wife Miriam......about the journey Author takes — new discoveries about Miriam, his adult son and daughter, new people he meets, and himself.
( so I’m taking a break from it for a few hours) ....ITS A STORY ALL ABOUT THIS AMAZING KID *ZACK*!
How could a charm bracelet stir up so many emotions and curiosity?After Arthur's wife passed away and he was cleaning out her things, his discovery of a hidden charm bracelet had him curious about what each charm meant. He also wanted to know why he never saw Miriam wearing it and why she had it hidden in the toe of a boot.This charm bracelet pulled him out of his hermit slump and onto adventures he never dreamed of as he traced where each charm came from and what their meaning was to Miriam.

He also wanted to know ​why he never saw Miriam wearing it and why she had it hidden ​in the toe of a boot.This charm bracelet pulled him out of his hermit slump and onto adventures he never dreamed of as he traced where each charm came from and what their meaning was to Miriam.
I wanted to know the answers about the charms too and loved sharing Arthur's days.THE CURIOUS CHARMS OF ARTHUR PEPPER is an adorable, enchanting, uplifting read.
Give yourself a marvelous treat, and don't miss reading THE CURIOUS CHARMS OF ARTHUR PEPPER.
This novel was a stinker… and there was nothing “charming” about it.When I first started reading it I was worried that it would be a clone of “A Man Called Ove”.
Arthur was no Ove… and I don’t mean that as a compliment.
He was an insecure little man who felt threatened at the thought that his wife might actually have had a life before she met him.
I was so disappointed because I was really looking forward to reading this and expected to thoroughly enjoy it.As The Man in Black would say...Read with SBC book club August 2016.
The discovery of the bracelet sets Arthur, not only on a quest to find the meanings behind each charm and a part of Miriam’s life that he was unaware, but also on his own voyage of self-discovery.This is a very well written novel and the characters are wonderful.
While Arthur himself is just adoring, his search for answers to the charms and his quest for purpose in own his life is helped by many other delightful characters in the book, his estranged children, Lucy and Dan, his neighbours, Bernadette, Nathan and Terry.
I think it would be impossible to put this book down and not be in a happy mood and a little in love with Arthur Pepper.
It is about a semi-elderly person who comes to a crossroads in their life and must decide how to live their remaining time.
On the first anniversary of Miriam's, his beloved wife of 40 years, death, Arthur decides to pack up her belongings.
He has been living a very regimented life in the past year.
As he packs, he discovers a charm bracelet in one of Miriam's boots.
Fall in love with Arthur Pepper.
:) I bought The Curious Charms of Arthur Pepper for my dad for Christmas because I had heard that it was a lot like A Man called Ove (which he was actually in the middle of reading again when he died.) I haven't been able to bring myself to truly pick up a book and read since I lost my dad but I thought maybe listening to the audiobook of the last book I ever bought him might be worth a try.I'm so glad this book found me at this time in my life.
Beautiful story, and now that I've read it I know that it's time to pick up a book and start reading again.
This is a charming feel good sort of novel about a sixty-nine year old English widower who after a year of isolation from the world and being closed up inside his home has decided to go through his deceased wife's clothes in preparation for donating them to charity.
He also learns to appreciate the years of marriage to his wife with a greater depth of understanding.
The story ends on a happy note with him looking forward to what life still has to offer.Upon reflection after completion of the book it occurs to me that one interpretation of the story is that the ghost of his wife felt sorry for him after noticing what a sad life he was leading.
Miriam and Arthur were married for forty happy, peaceful, uneventful years.
It's not until Arthur steels himself to the task of sorting her things that he discovers a charm bracelet he'd never seen before.
The Curious Charms of Arthur Pepper has a lot going for it.
Arthur's adventures help him to reconcile three versions of his wife; the wife he thought he knew, the (post-finding-the-bracelet-wife) he then questioned if he ever knew at all, and finally, the "true" Miriam.
3/5 starsThanks to MIRA via NetGalley for providing me with a free copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.
I love this story of Arthur Pepper! He’s so wonderfully endearing that you can’t help fall in love with him as he travels around the country trying to solve the mystery behind the charm bracelet. Beautifully written, funny and moving, this is one of those books that you will always remember.
I ***** LOVE ***** this charming and adventurous, witty and wise, life/love affirming book!!!"He was experiencing emotions he didn't know existed.
A tale to savor, ripe with imagination and adventure; bursts of humor and touches of sorrow; endearing love and folly too; and shift shaping shadows of truth - called memories.
But he did know that she had loved him .
Simply one step in front of the other......FIVE ***** Brilliantly Wise Wonderful and Charming, Life is a Journey ***** STARSTwo books that come to mind as comparably enjoyable, are: The Unlikely Pilgrimage of Harold FryGeorge's Grand Tour
After the shock wears off, Arthur steps out of his grief-stricken comfort zone of staid routine to discover what Miriam was hiding in her past.
Along the way he also works on reacquainting himself with his somewhat estranged children and realizes that discovering that living a non-adventurous and simple life doesn’t mean it hasn’t been well lived.
I absolutely adored this, well, charming, funny, and heartwarming story of grief and friendship, and I confess I fell a wee bit in love with Arthur Pepper.
Highly recommended for fans of UNLIKELY PILGRIMAGE OF HAROLD FRY, THE STORIED LIFE OF A.
(view spoiler)[After finding out where all the charms came from, Arthur also finds out that his son knew about the bracelet and that it had come to hold sentimental significance in his life, so much so that the son and his daughters had bought a charm for the bracelet and had sent it to Miriam just weeks before she'd died.
The stories Arthur uncovered made him realize his wife had been full of life and adventure prior to marrying him and he doesn't like knowing that.
Arthur Pepper is struggling with his wife's death, learning how to live alone when he discovers a charm bracelet in an old boot.
He realizes it was a part of his wife's life that he never knew about.
He sets out to discover where the charms came from and more about his wife's past.
I enjoyed this journey, but struggled to really love it.
Maybe it's because I've read too many of these types of books.
I didn't learn enough about the character's motivations, and this leaves me to fall right down the middle on this book.
Just received notification that I won this in a giveaway from The Reading Room! :)
The story is simple enough, about an old guy who finds a charm bracelet one year after his wife's passing, and begins to wonder about the significance of it, being as it was hidden.
It scares me to think of what my life would be like if I really became like Arthur.
In Arthur's case, I think he wondered if someone who was 'wild' was truly happy with someone who was 'boring' as him.
Yes, it was a silly little book, but I sure am, glad I read it!
Arthur doesn't recall ever seeing this before.The first charm, an elegant gold elephant with a green emerald in his tummy has tiny numbers etched on his side.
Arthur calls the number which leads him to a lovely family in India the first "stop" on his journey of the charms.
He's off to discover who his wife was before he me her, but he gets so much more in return.It's a lovely, encouraging book that will restore your hope and get you out of your house.Recommend it highly.
Widower Arthur Pepper is grieving and has resorted to the same daily routine, rarely leaving his Yorkshire home.
He finds a beautiful charm bracelet when he's sorting through his deceased wife's possessions.
A phone number engraved on one charm starts him on a journey where he learns about the important people and places in his wife's life before they were married.
Along the way Arthur reawakens to life and all the possibilities it holds.The people that Arthur meets seem to open their hearts and their homes to him much more quickly than people in real life.
Dieser Anruf in Indien wo seine Frau anscheinend mal gelebt hat, verändert Arthurs Leben… er macht sich auf eine abenteuerliche Reise, die ihn mit Tigern, egozentrischen Schriftstellern, Jugendherbergen, obdachlosen Klarinettisten und vielem mehr konfrontiert, von dessen Existenz er nicht einmal ahnte – und zuletzt mit sich selbst!„Bei jedem Menschen, dem ich begegne, bei jeder Geschichte, die mir zu Ohren kommt, habe ich das Gefühl, als würde ich mich verändern und wachsen.
فقط ۳۰-۴۰ صفحه اول رو خوندم و حس میکنم نویسنده فکر کرده مخاطبانش تعدادی کودک دبستانی هستند :|
I wanted to end the year with something light and unchallenging, and this was the perfect choice. A story that tells us we can never really know another person, sometimes the ones we love least of all.
This book reminds me so much of "A Man Called Ove".
My heart is all warm and toasty after finishing this book.
Maybe it is the travel bug in me, or me always wanting to live every piece of life like its golden why I LOVE this novel.
Patrick really did an amazing job of taking you on an unforgettable journey.
You are reminded it is never too late to start anything or travel- that message really resonated with me.
I am looking forward to reading more from Patrick!Must read
I smiled when I realized that "The Curious Charms of Arthur Pepper" were LITERALLY the gold charms on a bracelet that he finds, tucked in a winter boot, as he prepares to finally clear away the clothing of his wife Miriam who died a year before.
He sets off to solve the mystery, and much like the stars of Sophie Kinsella's famous chick lit series, becomes the hero in "over-the-top" hijinks on the zany adventures which answer questions and release him from his former inhibited comfort zone in family and friend relationships.
I thought this was a cute story, but nothing really special. It was a bit too coincidental for my tastes, but still cute. I would recommend it for someone looking for a quick and easy, feel good read. Maybe 3.5★.
I love the premise, I adore Arthur Pepper and his adventures.
The love he had for his wife and for his children is beautifully drawn and shown as the story goes on.
I love mad adventures and quite happily novels that have say a rainfall of fish, once the characters act towards this as I would expect them to.
I could not dispel my disbelief in Arthur being a real character.
Also, small points such as using the wrong name for Facebook is jarring and untrue to the character.
I also have another problem about the actions of a secondary character but that is a bit of a spoiler.
Received this ARC from First Reads for an honest review~~As Arthur Pepper tackles sorting through his deceased wife's belongings he comes across a hidden charm bracelet.
As he meets the people who correspond with the charms on the bracelet he sees another side of his wife ~ her life before him.
This book is the story of slow healing, better understanding those you love, and not only accepting the things you cannot change, but also changing with life's journey.
I started out not liking Arthur and ended up loving him.
Arthur Pepper was married to Miriam for 40 years and they had a strict routine they kept to every day.
After her death Arthur keeps to the routine his wife had set out.
On the anniversary of her death Arthur decides it's time to sort out her belongings.
On one of the charms he finds a telephone number which he decides to call to see if the person on the other end knew Miriam and if they gave knew about the bracelet.
He told Arthur he only gave her 1 charm but does not know the story behind the rest.
Arthur's journey of overcoming grief and going on an adventure which might bring him closure, is both interesting and sad, and definitely an exciting story.
Arthur's wife has died and he starts to understand that he actually didn't know a whole lot about her.
That she had done quite a lot really.
And there the journey begins.The story is really nice.
And a bit of a reminding to a bunch of other books on quirky old men that go through something (from A Man Called Ove to The Unlikely Pilgrimage of Harold Fry).
I can't say that I was really surprised or overwhelmed or anything, the book is fine, but not more (not even close to A Man Called Ove for sure).
Nice, easy, forgettable.
