https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3216708-concise-inorganic-chemistry
A prescribed book for my Inorganic Chemistry course. As the title says, it is concise and has EVERYTHING, mind you, almost everything in it. I used it for the other subjects as well. I especially loved the chapter on the Group 13 elements ( Chapter 12) and also the types of isomerism (pg. 232)
It's just too good to speak about it in mere words. The concepts are explained in a true-to-life, realistic, yet a comprehensible way. If the Fundamentals of Physics is the holy book of Physics, then Concise Inorganic Chemistry  is the juggernaut for Chemistry. Never, once, I have set my eyes on such a witty book, and understood it!
Exceptionally the best
it's good
Very very good
gud
I currently want to read this.
Awesome book. Deals Inorganic Chemistry to its fullest.
A basic book for undergraduates.
A very basic book especially focussing graduate students category. Good book if you just started inorganic chemistry reading.
