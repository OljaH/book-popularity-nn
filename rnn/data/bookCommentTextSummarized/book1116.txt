More of an exclamation than a review: Peirce is one of the most captivating thinkers I've ever read, and this set of essays, his most accessible and stirring I know.
I love that Peirce puts, well, "chance, love, and logic," or chaos, ethics, and reason into the same world system (and I use "system" in the late nineteenth sense that Peirce would have used it: a vague but understandable worldview that predates all the problems of over-precise systems and ugly utilitarianism that has clouded pragmatism since early twentieth-century positivism).
Even better, unlike many minds I can't hope to understand, some small part of Peirce rubs off every time I read him.
Peirce founds the uniquely American philosophical school Pragmatism, in which Theory and Practice are united, and which later has a usually unacknowledged or unrecognized impact on non-Americans such as Heidegger and Wittgenstein.
