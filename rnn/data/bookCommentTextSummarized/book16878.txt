There Is Always Hope
The Lost Boy, written by bestselling author David Pelzer, is about David’s own struggle in foster care.
In this book, David has a conflict internally and externally.
The internal conflict is how he feels sad and worthless after all those early years of abuse.
The external conflict is between David and his mother.
When David was about seven to nine, he excessively abused by his mother.
This is because it was very sad, but written very well.
The first book in this series, A Child Called ‘It’, David is about seven years old when his mother starts to beat him very much.
عندي هذا الكتاب منذ مدة طويلة ولم أعره اهتماماً قلت ربما يكون رواية فيها معاناة ولا أحب الروايات المأساوية أو ربما يكون كتبه أحد التربويين عن طفل متشرد ولا يختلف الأمر كثيراً في نظريولكن ما إن تناولته لم استطع تركه!
عجيبعادة لا أحب الكتب المترجمة لضعف النقل وضياع اللغة الجميلة من النص إلا ما ندر وهذا منها، حيث جاءت الترجمة جيدة ولم أجدها تخل بالمعنى ولا بالعاطفةالكتاب رائع فإنك لا تشعر إلا وأنت تشارك الكاتب في قصته وتتنقل معه بين المواقف المختلفة وتحاول جاهداً النجاة وكأنك مكانه

I had to read this one after The Child Called It. It was also compelling and opened my eyes to the foster care system.
The Lost Boy is a sequel to "A Child Called It" which basically depicts the life of David (the author) at ages 12-18 years old.The first book tells you about this little (literally) kid who was strong and determined enough to stay alive amidst all the abuse his mother had put him through.
Like being a foster kid was their fault and choice.Physical abuse seemed more easier to conquer and hurdle than the battle that boiled inside this little man.
A truly amazing story of Dave Pelzer, the little boy who was viciously abused by his mother.
Again, I can’t come close to understanding the viciousness of this woman and how she could treat her own son this way.
It is truly amazing that Dave survived and became successful as he did.
Dave is so right about Foster Care and the System.
I met a woman at work who became a Foster Parent and I truly looked at her in a different light.
It takes an extraordinary person to commit themselves to something like that.
I really admired her.
Truly inspirational.
Any child if not given the proper attention and guidance, even the most angelic and the nicest child in the world, can do things that may hurt others, destroy some property or worst destroy his own future- unintentionally.
It opens the mind of the reader to the realities of: the emotional battle of a foster child, the difficulties of foster parents, the hard work and dedication of social workers, the role of a teacher in every child's life, and most especially the "no one can define your future except yourself" also "your past can make you stronger only if you use it wisely."Great book :)
One of the most heartbreaking things about this time period for the author (ages 12-18) is that all he still wanted, despite everything his mother had done to him, was her love and to know why she treated him the way she did.
Ultimately, he manages to forgive both her for her abuse and his father for his neglect and I find it all so amazing.
This author is truly inspirational.
By telling his story, he teaches resilience and forgiveness and shows how the human spirit can succeed in the face of the worst kind of adversity.
I'll say it again - he is truly inspirational.
"The lost boy" is a sequel to, "A Child Called It," and it continues where the first memoir left off.
This, the second book, takes the reader through the author's years in foster care after being taken away from his...well, crazy mother.
It is great to hear positive opinions on the foster care system since most of what is reported is horrible.
Dave's strength, perseverance, and unshakeable spirit are extremely inspiring, and it is heartbreaking to learn of his experiences.
This book is extremely wonderful, I recommend it to most anyone, and I can not wait to read the first book and those after.
كتابي السابع لعام 2018.يستعرض الكاتب في هذا الجزء ما بعد اخراجه من منزل والدته وانتقاله للعيش في منازل الرعاية وحتى بلوغه الثامنة عشر من العمر.من قال أن مجرد الابتعاد عن البيئة المقيتة يجعل من الفرد انساناً آخر؟ كل الاهانات التي تلقاها والثقة بالنفس التي فقدها ستعود سلباً عليه في حياته الثانية💔حتى الآن لا أستطيع التصديق أن هناك والد أو والدة من الممكن أن يتعاملا بهذا الشكل الفظيع مع أولادهما...
The second book in this trilogy starts to deliver as much shock as the first about the appalling treatment David suffered but then his fight for survival and love shine through as he is finally removed and placed in different foster homes.
It was amazing near the end going on to see just what David achieved and the real strength of character he has, I was in complete awe.
The epilogue notes I found really added to the story as we got the recollections of the main characters in Davids life at the time and and their thoughts and feelings of what happened in his past as they lived it and now his present.A compulsive read.
good book even though it was sad

Reading Response #16I fell in love with this book.
Some kids, teens or adults are afraid to talk about their abusive childhood past.
Pelzer's father never bothered to help his own son, I cried when I read this book.
The author wrote this autobiography as an example of how some kids are treated in this world, they should be fearless and speak now before its too late.
Some kids don't tell anyone about their abusive lives because they are scared that their parents or guardians would abuse them more.
I pity on the kids who are abused everyday.
I like in some situations how David, the main character, handled himself.
This book starts out as David getting yelled at and abused by his mother.
He gets found by the police and his dad.
His dad also says that David says that for attention.
His dad gets to take him back home, and everything starts all over again.
He gets into trouble after being at his first foster home.
David gets taken to a facility, since there is nobody to take him in right now.
His dad said that he messed up the family by exploiting their secret about the abuse.
It is a truly amazing and inspiring book, it is one that will move you to tears and make you feel for him.
This book truly makes you appreciate what your own life is like and makes you appreciate the people that you have around you.
It is very well written and really draws the reader into the book and makes them feel many different emotions, it is truly a emotional rollercoaster but it is a great book for readers who enjoy true life novels.
کتاب خیلی خوبی بود. برای من که درک درستی از شرایط سخت کودکانی که مورد آزار قرار گرفته و میگیرند نداشتم، بسیار مفید بود. همه باید این کتاب را بخوانیم؛ چرا که همه نیاز داریم درک بهتر و دقیقتری در این زمینه داشته باشیم و اطلاعاتمان را بهبود ببخشیم. شاید یکی از مهمترین جملههای کتاب در صفحهی 234 نوشته شده باشد: «همهی اجتماع باید برای نجات یک کودک وارد عمل شود.» من فکر کنم خواندن این کتاب بخشی از همین عملیات نجات است، چون قطعاً آگاهی ما را افزایش خواهد داد، میتوانیم روزهای سیاهی را که «پسر گمشده» از س
شاید یکی از مهم‌ترین جمله‌های کتاب در صفحه‌ی 234 نوشته شده باشد: «همه‌ی اجتماع باید برای نجات یک کودک وارد عمل شود.» من فکر کنم خواندن این کتاب بخشی از همین عملیات نجات است، چون قطعاً آگاهی ما را افزایش خواهد داد، می‌توانیم روزهای سیاهی را که «پسر گمشده» از سر گذرانده، همراه او تجربه کنیم.
جلد دوم به دوران تحت سرپرستی دولتی بودن او اختصاص دارد و در جلد سوم پلتزر از فراز و نشیب جوانی‌اش نوشته است.خواندن این کتاب را به‌شدت پیشنهاد می‌کنم، به همان دلیلی که قبلاً به آن اشاره کردم، همه‌ی ما در قبال سرنوشت کودکان دور و برمان به‌نحوی مسئولیم.
I feel that David tries to tell everyone who is reading the story that you should never give up on something even if it is the littlest things, because you are not the only one going through whatever your struggle may be.
Throughout the whole story, the author tried to stay on the same topic about his life and how he was abused and to tell everyone how to get through things in a better way and stay strong.
When I read this story, and all the events that happened to him, I could feel the emotion through the book.
The book is set in his grade school to high school years, when he transit from being abused at home to living in the foster care system.Wanting to escape his mother’s beatings yet yearning for her love and acceptance, Dave made a difficult decision of leaving his mother.
The Lost Boy conveys that story emotionally through actual events, attempting to help lost souls, much like Dave Pelzer, to discover and be driven to achieve their passion, and to find their standing in society.The most memorable event in the book was when Dave made the decision to leave his mother, despite her threat from her previous visit.
The second book in the Dave Pelzer trilogy is The Lost Boy, chronicling Dave’s life in foster homes from the age of twelve to eighteen.
I don’t feel like another book is necessary but have decided to read it for the sake of completeness.At the start of the book, Dave insists this one is written using the language and perspective he had at that age.
He has a stint or two in a juvenile detention hall and is passed around a bit until he settles down and decides where he wants to go in life.More than anything I found this book to be a testament to the hard work of social workers and foster parents.
I read the book "The Lost Boy", which is a sequel to the book, "A Child Called It" it was about a man named Dave Pelzer's, and life as a foster child.
I had read his first book "A Child Called It" last year and I always thought that he lived a good loved life after winning against his mom, and the I read this book read "The Lost Boy" and I couldn't help but feel sorry for David and how he still was pretty much neglected still even after winning against his mother, but he still had no one.
Lives in a physical and verbal abuse home with an alcoholic mother that has so much hate towards her son David.
Although he gets rescued from this horrible alcoholic mother and is sent to foster care, his pain and suffering and living in fear everyday and night is just the beginning for David.
I cant say I cant relate to this but I sure know how David felt living with his alcoholic mother and family that did nothing but hurt him mentally and physically.
The Lost BoyThe book, The Lost Boy, by Dave Pelzer, tells a story of a boy named David and his personal experiences through the search for the love of a family.
An important theme in this story tells us about the importance of staying strong and never giving up.David received the strength to run away from home knowing it was his last chance of survival.
What stood out the most to me in this story was the fact that this young boy acquired the strength to never give up through every encounter he was challenged with and was heading towards a successful future.
This is a continuation of the series from the book A Child Called It. This takes place after Mr. Pelzer is removed from his home and into foster care at the age of 12.
I couldn't even get through the first chapter without practically crying on the outside and screaming on the inside, "Why did this happen to him?" Throughout the book I wanted to know why his mother was such a monster and why did she single out Dave?
The book goes from Dave being placed in foster care up until the time he phased out and entered the Air Force.
I just wanted to stay at a place that I could call home.” (Pelzer 252).The Lost Boy is a really difficult book to read because Dave has to overcome so many challenges and a stunning amount of hardship at such a young age.
I don’t know what you do to become….fostered children, but I’m sure you did something hideous, didn’t you?” (Pelzer 271) By the end of the book, however, the generosity and kindness of a few individuals becomes evident and some faith in society is restored.
There's no doubt David wants to please " The Mother" and his father but is also looking to find himself.
Now his pathway on self discovery begins when he's taken from his mothers custody.
It takes David years to truly discover his feelings about his mother and father.
David spent the first nine years of his life being abused in "The Home" and once taken from his mothers custody he was moved to a series of foster homes until he was 18.
David finally finds his way, though the road is not without a series of bumps.
The theme of The Lost Boy is to fight your way through life’s struggles because struggles make you stronger.
In The Lost Boy, most of the chapters would start out as a date or where the chapter was taking place.
The book walks you through the boy’s life, starting at age 9 until he was 18.
It clearly shows the boy’s journey through the foster families.This book was enjoyable and easy to read.
I liked the book because it gave me a glimpse of another person’s life, but I disliked the abuse suffered by the boy.
Pelzer's style does tend to the melodrama (lots of exclamation points and declarations that a moment was a turning point in his future) but I respect what he has overcome and I found the book to be an engaging and moving story.One perspective I especially appreciated was Mr. Pelzer's abiding respect for the social workers, foster parents and other caring adults in his life.
It was nice to see a memoir about foster care where the writer acknowledges that adults did help him, and in the end, he gives one set of parents the ultimate tribute of calling them mom and dad.I suppose you do need to read the first book, gory and clunky though it was, to appreciate this one.
To me this book was sad because i couldnt believe that a mother would treat her own flesh and blood
