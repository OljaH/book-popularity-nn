This book is not for me. I am the wrong audience. I do not generally enjoy reading satire and this book is no exception. I found it sarcastic and angry and ugly. I realize many would find it funny and dark, but I am not one.
Some great set-pieces: 1 between the workingclass Communist who had escaped from a Spanish prison camp + lost his leg in doing so, revealing to the County babe who digs communists that his atrocity stories were only de rigueur, and that the nuns had not in fact rubbed salt in his wound but been very kind to him.
She turns on him, whereupon he denounces all upperclass Communists who sneer at actual workers - whereupon she has another boyfriend beat him to a pulp and nearly kill him, all the time sneering at him for being an ungrateful little prole, not a real Communist like her.
Interesting to read this as I'd just read The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas by Stein, which mentioned Wyndham Lewis amongst others. The characters in Revenge for love seem at times easily led. There is no main lead with each part seeming to take the central part. Felt sympathy for Margot, Vince and Percy, but wanted to shake them for their inability to see what is going on around them.
"Affecting a breezy manner"
I read somewhere that Lewis considered this his best novel. I think his readers usually agree. I've only read a little of his fiction but I can't imagine that it gets much better.
I did manage to get all the way though this, but it was not easy to follow and I'm afraid not my sort of book at all.
Um, I found it less infuriating than Tarr?
