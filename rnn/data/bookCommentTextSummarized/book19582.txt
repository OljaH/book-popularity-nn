This book is so strange and awful, it's hard to explain exactly why I dislike it.
Thank God this book didn't live up to its hype like Twilight did.
It was such a bloody bore.
Lore can't use the word "and" in the proper way.
Which seems like it's not a big of a deal, but it is!
2. The characters are all bland and pathetic.
The characters are so emotionless.
It's like, "OH I FORGOT TO MENTION WHAT MY POWERS ARE!" "OH, WAIT!
His writing is dull and boring in every possible way.
It reminds me of Fitzgerald's writing.
I feel like the concept of the novel was born before the characters and logic wasn't worked out around it.I Am Number Four is about John Smith, a teenage boy who is actually an alien from another planet.
The servant species of aliens are powerless, but their life goals are to train the powerful mutants.
Of course, the servant species works just as hard but they get no 'magic.' Evolution does /not/ work that way and it is never explained why only one humanoid race developed powers.4.
The children are protected by a 'charm' that means they can only be killed in order.
(^_____^) *hyperventilating*COMPLETE AND EDITED REVIEWWhat the hell!For the love of Alex Pettyfer, I will watch the movie and will read this book!***Note: The post above are my insane thoughts before reading the book, pardon my fan girling obscenities.
*attacks another fan girl* (Sorry I just have a manic episode, I forgot to take Lithium Carbonate this morning *evil laugh*.)_______________________(Again fan girling craziness...*you can skimmed through*)Now before I'm going to review the book I'd like to tell you a story about how I met Alex Pettyfer (yum yum).
In fact, your neighbor may be a Lorien (the "good guy" planet of concern here) and the haberdasher (way to blend in!) may be a Mogadarian (the "bad guy" aliens who are hunting Lorien-types to the death).
This means (gasp) hold on to your seats action from the get-go as John Smith and his protector (called "Cepans" here) move to a small Ohio town to blend in.Blending in defined: fall in love with a gorgeous (surprise!) girl named Sarah.
It means they like action.
It means they like plot.
“It's the little mistakes that lead to big mistakes.”  I Am Number Four was unexpectedly fun. John Smith or Number four is my favorite character. I really loved his wits and the pace of this book, it's insanely fast that I didn't dare to breath when something happened. Pittacus slowly built up tensions through the book, and he abruptly released them at the right time, it worked so well for me I gave 5 stars without hesitation. “That’s the worst way to miss somebody. When they’re right beside yo
I Am Number Four was unexpectedly fun.
John Smith or Number four is my favorite character.
Pittacus slowly built up tensions through the book, and he abruptly released them at the right time, it worked so well for me I gave 5 stars without hesitation.
When they’re right beside you and you miss them anyway.” 
John runs away all his life, nowhere is safe for him to stay.
That's what the point this book was so interesting for me and I couldn't put it down for hours until I finished it.Moreover, Reading I Am Number Four was like reading a Japanese manga, it was imaginative and easy to enjoy.
This book was (no pun intended) OUT.OF.THIS.WORLD!Okay, it’s official… I’m an alien fan and all this business about invasions, them possibly living among us, alternate life forms out there, other planets… sure why the heck not?!?
And to know that I may be putting her life in danger by being with her – well, it terrifies me.I loved his snarky moments when, in his own way, he was trying to be honest with Sarah about what he really was, and you can tell how much he wanted to trust her.She smiles, “What happened, anyway?
o_OOverall this was a solid two stars read for me, seeing as the story did entertain me at times (especially towards the end) and I made it through the book, but it was definitely nothing memorable for me.
I think this might be one of those rare cases where the movie is actually better than the book.
I removed my review (and all the comments).I was tired sick of people writing me lengthy comments about how I read too much realistic fiction (really?), how I can't appreciate something fun and not overly brainy (do tell!) and, in general, all the ways I'm so obtuse for failing to appreciate this crap book.Sorry trolls people, but my opinions are my own and I still think this book was lame, badly written, unoriginal and an overall neurons-killer.
So there would have to have been Legacies already present among the Loric for them to become prevalent.Okay, change gears here.Planets and stars.Lorien is one tenth the size of Earth, and its star is twice the size of our Sun. It’s fourth away from this star.
That’s how we get things like the gaseous race that shows up in one of Anne McCaffrey’s ‘The Ship Who’ books.It’s possible to explain parallel evolution to reader satisfaction.
According to Pittacus Lore, you see, not only would humans not have developed fire or language on their own, they wouldn’t have come up with things like the Four Noble Truths or the theory of Relativity if the speshul aliens hadn’t been involved.
Perhaps I expected too much after all this is YA but Lorien, it’s inhabitants and culture were too simple or too similar to that of Earth and humans.
There was something about the elders disappearing during the ultimate battle on Lorien so there’s a small possibility he still lives, however the book is in first person from John’s POV.
Henri encourages us to have hope even when the task ahead appears impossible but 6 kids with powers versus a whole race –I’m not optimistic.
I think they’d have a better time with it than I did.The movie, released next week, looks spiffy and exciting.
These chapters were both somewhat harder to get through only because I'm an impatient reader and want to get to the good stuff and also easier since I was already invested in these characters lives and wanted to see how things would play out.One thing is for certain though, each page is lined with an intense urgency that made it more compelling to keep reading to the very end.I loved John and Henri, they have the greatest bond and I connected with them right away.

Can't wait!!!Edit:Movie was pretty good.
It followed the book pretty closely, shockingly.Husband liked the movie, even without reading the book.
Let's start off with  the writing:You know there's something wrong with a book when you have to play some kind of weird word scramble with a sentence every few pages.
Like maybe: I took her hands in mine and gave her a long, lingering kiss good night.I think the problem is that the author is so focused on creating a cinematic visual (I'll get to the Hollywood cliches further in) for us that he forgets the main idea: tell the damn story.
I've heard a lot of hype surrounding it and so I was a little hesitant going in but from page one I was completely drawn in and didn't want to put it down!
From the Legacies to the Loric to the Chest and everything in between, it's just all so interesting and absolutely captivating!
I wanted to dive into this world and completely immerse myself in it!
I also really loved the characters, they really are all amazing!
It had fantastic characters, phenomenal world building AND was crazy action packed with all kinds of twists and turns that left me itching to start the next book!
*3.75 LORIEN STARS* "When you have lost hope, you have lost everything. And when you think all is lost, when all is dire and bleak, there is always hope." This was my first time reading this book and it was a pretty okay read. I wasn't blown away but it wasn't bad either. I watched the movie adaption about 4 years ago when it first came out but I didn't remember a lot of it so the story was still quite "new" to me.One thing that immediately annoyed me was John's name. I mean, John Smith? Serious
I watched the movie adaption about 4 years ago when it first came out but I didn't remember a lot of it so the story was still quite "new" to me.One thing that immediately annoyed me was John's name.
(Or that the next book will be from a different perspective alltogether, maybe Six or something?)Another thing was the insta-love between him and Sarah.
I mean, come on, I get that the story needed to progress really fast, but I would've liked to see some development in their relationship before they fell head over heels in love.The action in the end made up for a lot though!
Boredom aside, I found the characters and dialogue quite wooden, and the entire plot was rife with cliches.
I suppose she was also valued for her supposed "goodness", which was demonstrated to the reader only in the most banal, cliche ways (ie.
I wasn't at all surprised to learn about the conditions that the book was written under, as that's exactly what it reads like - some kind of mass-produced, commercial product coming out of a YA-book-trend factory.
It's like they just grabbed a bunch of cliches and popular YA trends - a love triangle, magic powers, etc.
The initial premise is that Number Four (aka John Smith) is an alien from Lorien who, along with nine other children, was sent to earth as a small child to escape the destruction of his planet by the Mogadorians.
4) For two people who have spent the last several years hiding and trying to survive long enough to return to Lorien, John and his cepan, Henri, seem intent on getting their asses handed to them.
They both know that the three other Loriens have been killed, they know the Mogadorians are closing in, and they know John is number four.
You know the characterization sucks when the best character in the book is the dog....
LOVED IT.The characters were great, the plot was great, the events were great, the setting was great, EVERYTHING WAS GREAT!The whole concept of the book was amazing!But I got this weird vibe coming from deep within me after I finished reading the book.
And it really annoyed me and angered me.Here I am, just finished reading this amazing book, and i have this weird vibe just radiating from me.It took me a few days to figure out what it was, so I will explain to you what the weird vibe was.I felt like the book should have been longer.
It just felt like everything was happened too fast even though it had an average speed.
Este libro es  ABURRIDO , muy aburrido, absurdamente aburrido. El que tengas a Superman, digo John, digo Cuatro (view spoiler)[Aclaración, este Cuatro , no este Cuatro ...Me pregunto si no servira otro número (?) (hide spoiler)] no ayuda a que la historia sea interesante, la personalidad es aburrida, practicamente no tiene sentimientos...a menos que maten a uno de los legados, que son el resto de los alienigenes, porque es el único momento en que reacciona...aunque no porque el libro lo diga, a
De verdad cada cosa que se plantea al inicio del libro es destruida pasando la mitad y por razones estúpidas, o sencillamente sin razón.El estilo de escritura es muy escueto, hace mucho enfasis en Superman y Luoise (digo Cuatro/John y Sarah) en que ella es la forma de lograr que el revele sus poderes...y todos lo vean como algo normal, pero no hay desarrollo en la historia de los extraterrestres, en ninguno de ellos (mmmm ¿será por eso que el 60% del libro es romance?¿Porque faltaba creatividad para...no se...contar algo interesante, aunque fuera jodido relleno?)En fin, una perdida de tiempo.["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>
This book is an entertaining and easy read. It reminds you of Superman plus X-men which means this book contains a really cool story with really cool characters. The story begins so intensely, it grabbed my focus immediately. Its movie adaptation is good enough, though not as good as the book. I wonder when the movie sequels will come.
$1.99 on 23 June 2016Wow, crazy mixed reviews for this one. I mean, cray cray mixed. For $1.99, I just might be crazy enough to find out for myself... I mean, aliens, right? Aliens are awesome.
I cannot believe I waited so long to start this series! I am going to go get the others at the library throughout the next few weeks. This is a very fascinating plot and the characters are so likeable!
Years ago I was watching The X-Files movie and during the climax scene Mulder and Scully need to get out of some remote, creepy warehouse before the building is destroyed (probably by aliens; it was always aliens that messed up Mulder's plans, and the show.
In fact, until the climax read like a choreographed fight, I probably would have given this four stars.I liked number four (never really came to think of him as John) and was vested in his story, and while I think Sarah could have been better defined, more than just gorgeous and empty, for an action book, the characterization wasn't bad.
Plus, since the main character is a boy instead of a girl, so we got a Pretty Blond Girl instead of a Prince Charming, Bullies instead of a Queen Bee, but the Geek is still the Geek here(4) The soundtracks of the movie are damn annoying.
(8) Number Six looks pretty cool, so would anyone tell me why she isn't the main character!?(9) The whole thing is just so damn juvenile, I can't live with it!(10)The movie comes to an end!
Nine people(along with their guardians)are on a run.They come from a far away planet called Lorian which is ten times smaller than Earth.All of them look just like us.Go to high school like us.But they are not us.They have special powers.Their planet,Lorien,had been attacked and destroyed.The nine of them(Garde) and their guardians(Cepan) are the only ones who have survived.They arrived on Earth and have parted ways.They are in hiding in different parts of the world.Before the had left the planet,the elders of that planet had put a charm and linked them all together so that if one of them dies the others will know it.And they can be killed only according to their number.
I'm not sure what "I Am Number Four" is doing here on a website dedicated to reviewing books, because whatever this thing is (a travesty?
It's a disgrace to real books, which isn't quite the same thing.That's how awful this piece of writing is.
It's so awful I can't bring myself to call it a book, even though it's masquerading as one for tax purposes.
I don't know you, but I know you're better than this.
Here's another reason to stay away from this contemptible excuse for a novel: you probably have better ways to spend your money than funding the career of a hack.
He has run ins with the school bully, falls in love with the prettiest girl in school, and generally behaves like a typical teenaged girl (yes, I said girl, and if you read this book, you'll see why) until the Moggadorians find him and the battle for survival ensues.The Good?
The book was interesting enough, well paced enough, and written well enough that I was willing to forgive the use of present tense, and first person.The climax of this book is very good and rather exciting, putting that of the movie absolutely to shame.
Pittacus Lore-whoever he is-did everything right.The pacing was perfect, I cared for the characters, the style was perfectly readable and the scenery was wonderfully visual.
Number Six: I liked her appearance, but would have loved some more information on what she has been doing for the past 10 years, where she has been hiding, how her guardian was killed etc etc.
All wonderfully written-or maybe it was just me over imagining things?Oh, and John and Sarah were incredibly cute together :)Now, onto a few problems I had with the book: -Characters.
I know I said that this book has had the best character ive read about all year-but they still need work.
This was a teenaged fantasy-other world - alien - magical powers book I listened to along w my 14 year old. We started listening to it on a 5 Hour drive home this past weekend. Upon having unloaded the car, he called out to me MOM!!! CMON - LETS LISTEN TO THE REST! So, yeah. I put in 11 or 12 awful hours over the past two days with this teeny bopper thing. But my kid and I got to complain about the characters, ask each other plot questions, etc for all that time. PRICELESS! 💙💚
