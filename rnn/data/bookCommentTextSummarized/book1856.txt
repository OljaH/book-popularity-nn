In light of the fact that Russell's and Frege's logic was crafted primarily to further a logicist philosophy of mathematics, one wonders if previous scholars have underestimated the significance of Wittgenstein's possible reflection on the logicist project as a unitary motivation for his early doctrines.
Second, it is somewhat surprising that there is a discussion of the nature of temporality here.
This could be attributable to the overall "Kantian" flavor of the proceedings, but I couldn't help but notice that the nature of the subjective experience of time was a topic in the air, most notably in Heidegger's Being and Time (1927).
