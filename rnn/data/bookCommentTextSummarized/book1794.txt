At the beginning i need to apologize for my English, for i am a fresh graduate from a foreign language school in Nanjing, China.
However, after reading it, i find it extremely perplexing to understand why so many chinese like it: it is completely EUROCENTRIC.Firstly, the writer takes pity on we Asians in a hypocritical way.
His attitude is like when a wealthy man pitying a begger.By the way, he is really ignorant about our history, which I can understand putting him in the historical background, but i still recommend foreign readers not to take this chapter seriously.
Not a perfect book, but incredible considering it was written in 1932. Also, it made me look at maps and google cities and countries for "the rest of the story" (i.e. what's happened since 1932), and I enjoyed that.
Lots of fun to read this 1930s take on the world, although it definitely must be taken with a grain of salt and not expected to be an academic work.
Kind of like reading the encyclopedia and coming across some amazing gems of explanation, so basic that you wonder why they are not taught in schools.(Note there is a dust cover picture of the book on Amazon.)Full title and author of the book is VAN LOON'S GEOGRAPHY,THE STORY OF THE WORLD WE LIVE IN by Hendrik Willem Van Loon
The most entertaining Geography textbook you'll ever read.
Really cool book. The hand drawn maps really make it unique and there's just a whimsical element to the whole thing that I love.
The most fun you will have reading about Geography. Even so, it got pretty dry the last few chapters.
