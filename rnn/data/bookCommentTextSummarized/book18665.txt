I finished Elena Ferrante's second volume a few hours ago and I'm overwhelmed by her power.
She writes with her fingers stuck inside a electric plug.
She drills and drills all the way through the tiniest sensation, till she reaches raw matter.
The story of the New Name is even more entrancing than My brilliant friend, the first volume of the trilogy, which I devoured.
Lila and Lena, the two protagonists of volume one, are now two women.
What a wonderful, deep, contradictory, at times morbid, violent yet luminous, yet brilliant world does Ferrante's voice evoke!
It broke my heart so badly that I had to stop reading it for a few days to recover.This is the second book of Elena Ferrante's Neapolitan series, and it follows Elena and Lila from their teenage years and into their early 20s.
(emphasis mine) My point is that even though this is the story of two female friends, I have found these novels to be very thoughtful in their social commentary, especially with the different paths that Elena and Lila took.
Only a handful of writers can undress and get to the heart of women as lucidly and thrillingly as Ferrante.
She achieves this by elucidating the emotional/motivational source of many of these facts.
For example, the domestic violence in this novel is all the more powerfully disturbing for the lack of emphasis she gives it, as if it’s no more extraordinary than a trip to the shops.
In fact the ease with which she feeds hugely complex and pivotal experience into her narrative makes most other contemporary novelists seem a bit written up and theatrical.
Even a few years ago, I think reading this might have sent me into a depressive, melodramatic spiral like when I saw Melancholia, which had to have been the literal worst thing I could have chosen to see while writing my thesis in a foreign country at a school full of people smarter than me.
Why would she want to take that away that illusion from herself?This class angle had a lot to do with the ugly place I was telling you about before, which is the deep-seeded insecurity that runs throughout this entire book.
Ho l'impressione che manchi perfino più che nel primo episodio di questa saga, e quasi se ne sente la mancanza: forse perché a volte Ferrante si prodiga a spiegarci il tipo di dialetto che sta usando un suo personaggio invece di farcelo leggere, invece di farcelo sentire.Elena e Lila da bambine e da adolescenti protagoniste della serie TV.Credo sia il suo bisogno di comunicare a tutti indistintamente, di essere capita e non rischiare di essere fraintesa: in queste pagine c’è un’urgenza di racconto che sembra ansia.
Elena's sexual initiation and the battering of Lila by Stefano serve as examples of the former whereas both characters struggles to escape the Neopolitan slums permeate both of their stories.
284) There is a gorgeous passage on page 289 of soul-searching on the beach where we feel her pain, her alienation from herself that was literally painful to read: "Lila is right, the beauty of things is a trick, the sky is the throne of fear." Powerful words.
And yet those words are where Elena will find vindication and meaning as she is finally able to put them on paper and write her first book.
And her life continuously appears in mine, in the words that I’ve uttered, in which there’s often an echo of hers, in my less which is such because of her more, in my more which is the yielding to the force of her less."This second book in Elena Ferrante’s Neapolitan series continues the story of two childhood friends, now young adults, Lila and Elena.
I just want to talk about Lila and Elena a little bit more.
I don’t know that I can say much more about this book or this series – it’s one that I could contemplate for an indefinite amount of time!
I adore these characters and would read 100 books about them.-----4.5 stars Update: Bumping this one up to a 5 stars because after a few months of thinking about it, it's definitely my favorite in the series.
I keep finding myself thinking of certain scenes and elements of this installment, and I love it.-----I'm not sure if I can write a coherent review of this book right now.
Oh, and this book has one of the best pages of literature I've ever read, so there's that.
I can't wait to read books 3 & 4!
That's the paradox Ferrante incites in readers: between wanting to gallop through the stunning tale, to just gobble it up like cake, and slowing down to take in the beauty of its structure and language.It's the early 1960s in Naples and Lina Carracci (née Cerullo) is newly and miserably married and living in virtual purdah with her husband, Stefano, whom she has quickly learned to hate because he is a tool of the Solaras, who are Cammora.
Lenù stays with the blue collar Antonio, though, because she doesn't feel worthy of Nino, having come from a background much like Antonio's.
She lets us know the moment when the girls, young women actually, had to acknowledge the truth that no matter what they would do, no matter how much money Lila has now or how educated Elena is, they still would have no chance with thoroughbred, that true class and natural grace is not to buy or imitate.I think I’m enjoying the story because it has an air of something tangible, it’s like hearing about people you know in real life, people you're supporting in their struggling.

See "Advanced options" below.Bad girlIf you are a bad girl, you will be able to speak your mind and express your sexuality freely, but you will be beaten, raped and called a whore and a witch.

You may for example be a bad girl who gets married and tries to stay faithful to her husband, or a good girl who writes a daring and truthful novel about her life.
Spending too much time playing WOMAN™ can be very depressing.
Lina and Lenù, the names barely distinguishable when heard, have discovered that in early 1960’s Italy, it is still a man’s world.
Ah, nobody could make a world so complete, so filled with recognizable motivations, were it not at least close to a kind of universal truth.Besides that, there is the style of the work: it is so accessible, so female, so filled with things men would never say, never contemplate saying.
It is the kind that teaches us something about how the world works and how other have dealt with circumstances we might encounter.But it may be the language that is the most remarkable thing of all.
"Your name is no longer Cerullo. You are Signora Carracci and you must do as I say."  By changing her name, Lila/Lina had changed her whole life. For the worse. From the frying pan into the fire.  "What have I done, she thought, dazed by wine, and what is this gold circle, this glittering zero I’ve stuck my finger in."  She had changed her name, and exchanged it for a web of lies, a different level of violence. The first inclination she had came from those shoes. Marcello Solara was shod in tho
She has to struggle not only with her circumstances, but also her insecurities and her lack of faith in her own abilities.Later Elena is able to reflect on her friendship with Lila, and on the differences between them: "How easy it is to tell the story of myself without Lila: time quiets down and the important facts slide along the thread of the years like suitcases on a conveyor belt at an airport; you pick them up, put them on the page, and it’s done.
Phenomenal Favola--Due Amici This is the second of a tetralogy called the "Neopolitan Novels," by Italian novelist Elena Ferrante (pseudonym), who says she considers the four volumes to constitute one novel. The books were so popular in Italy that the periodical publications regularly engaged in a game of speculation on the author's true identity.The books center on the lives and friendship of two girls from Naples, Italy, Elena Greco (called sometimes "Lenù") and Raffaella ("Lila") Cerullo. Bo
This is the second of a tetralogy called the "Neopolitan Novels," by Italian novelist Elena Ferrante (pseudonym), who says she considers the four volumes to constitute one novel.
Both are intelligent and precocious young students in the first book called My Brilliant Friend, which takes them up to 16 years old.
In some ways, Ms. Ferrante's writing reminds me of that by the Norwegian Karl Ove Knaussgard in his six-volume My Struggle, so conversational and existential without being overly gloomy.
Unlike the Karl Ove novels, it is necessary to read these in order.
Sometimes the translation does not help, either:I got mad, I said, “You are both mistaken: it's I who do what Lina wants, not the opposite.”This just sounds so strange, so formal, especially for someone who's supposed to be angry.
‘That was what we said, we girls, when someone didn't care much about us: that he wasn't a man.’ When Lila explains away her bruises by saying that she fell, Ferrante's understanding of the scene is exquisite:She had used, in telling that lie, a sarcastic tone and they had all sarcastically believed her, especially the women, who knew what had to be said when the men who loved them and whom they loved beat them severely.
In the opening scene, set some fifty years after Lila’s wedding, Elena betrays her friend’s trust, saying “I couldn’t stand feeling Lila on me and in me, even now that I was esteemed myself, even now that I had a life outside of Naples.” She dumps the journals Lila had given her for safekeeping into the Arno River, but then she turns back and tells Lila’s story to us, her readers, so that we’ll remember Lila, and the old neighborhood, forever.
Elena discovers The Blue Fairy, a short novel Lila had written as a child, and realizes Lila’s words and voice are the secret heart of my book.
With both books, there are several blank pages following the end: a trick so you won't slow down as I might've, not wanting to get to the end yet; or a reminder that there's more to come?
(That hadn't even crossed my mind.) http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainm...'Ferrante’s publisher even expressed concern to Slate that “many people didn’t understand the game we we’re playing, that of, let’s say, dressing an extremely refined story with a touch of vulgarity.” Certainly, readers aren’t required to enjoy the cloying sensibility of the images just because they’re intentionally bad, and because Ferrante herself chose them.'
Rating a 4.5Elena Greco and Lila Cerullo are friends, and through these books, you get the details of their lives and their friendship.
The story packs in so much - love, betrayal, friendship, marriage, adultery, internal conflict, abuse, suicide, and so much more.Book two in this amazing series picks up right where book one ends, with the marriage of Lila to Stefano.
I'll not discuss anymore of what happens and spoil this story for anyone.I highly suggest these books to anyone to read.
I see myself reading these books again and again.I went to my library yesterday and picked up book three in the series.
I would not want to forget what Ferrante herself so eloquently stated in one of her letters: the mystery of literature is in some ways its difference from the person who wrote it, the unfathomable effacement of self that leads to its creation."Meghan O'Rourke in The GuardianTo create a space for the savage within, for the contradictory and the wild, and make it real.I could not express what these Neapolitan novels do any better than Meghan O'Rourke does in her fiercely intelligent and perceptive review of Elena Ferrante's novels for the Guardian.
You will simply never experience women characters in this way anywhere else.
You get to read and feel the female psyche with more vibrancy and complexity and beauty than you can ever hope to find in a literary work.
While I was reading it, I thought it felt a little like it was a translation and yet, over time, as I got used to it, I just loved the writing:  “They began to hold hands without hiding it, with an offensive shamelessness, as if they had decided that with us it wasn’t worth pretending.
Stayed up until 4am to finish. So worth it. Will review when I can collect my thoughts (and get some sleep).
As palavras parecem pipocas a querer saltar da minha boca para fora, mas para não saírem atabalhoadas tal é a excitação, vamos resumir a coisa ao mínimo possível: desde as leituras do Zafon que não ficava assim alucinada e envolvida com uma história e umas personagens que se colaram a mim dia e noite!Venham os próximos!

Οι χαρακτήρες είχαν βρει πλέον τον βηματισμό τους κι εγώ ήξερα που πατούσαν… έρωτες, προδοσίες, ανησυχίες, κόντρες κι έξτρα κόντρες, αντιζηλίες και μια ναπολιτάνικη νότα φτώχειας και ασυδοσίας που σ’αυτό το βιβλίο μου φάνηκε πολύ περισσότερο από το πρώτο…Με κούρασε ολίγον το σκηνικό στην Ίσκια, το νησάκι των διακοπών, θεώρησα πως οι σελίδες παρατράβηξαν σαν ένα από αυτά τα ατελείωτα παιδικά καλοκαίρια που μας βαρούσε ο ήλιος κατακέφαλα, οι μάνες μας μας έβαζαν με το ζόρι να κοιμηθούμε τα μεσημέρια, ώσπου στο τέλος μπάνιο, παιχνίδια και ξεκούραση δεν μας έλεγαν τίποτα…Ακόμα δεν μπορώ να καταλάβω, τι είναι αυτό που με τραβάει σ’αυτή την τετραλογία… δεν είναι αμάν το λογοτεχνικό κείμενο, δεν είναι αμάν η ιστορία (δεν υπάρχει τούτο το σασπένς – αμάν τι θα γίνει στην επόμενη σελίδα – ο δολοφόνος ήταν ο μπάτλερ…), δεν είναι αμάν οι φιλοσοφικοί στοχασμοί… είναι μάλλον η αίσθηση πως διαβάζεις ή ζεις από κοντά την ιστορία μιας φίλης, μιας γνωστής ή ακόμα και τη δική σου ιστορία και βυθίζεσαι αποχαυνωμένος σ’αυτήν… (τι είπα πάλι ο ποιητής…)Εντάξει, τώρα εδώ που φτάσαμε, θα διαβάσω το τρίτο και το τέταρτο, δόξα να ‘χει ο Γιαραμπί…Βαθμολογία: 8/10http://skorofido.blogspot.gr/2016/12/...
Ευτυχώς το "νέο όνομα", έχει κάποια νέα στοιχεία (προς το τέλος βέβαια) που έσωσαν λίγο την κατάσταση και απέφυγα το χαρακίρι.Θυμάμαι ότι πριν από μερικά χρόνια, όταν είχε πάρει για πρώτη φορά το μάτι μου τα βιβλία της τετραλογίας της Νάπολης σε κάποιο βιβλιοπωλείο (αν δεν κάνω λάθος τότε είχαν εκδοθεί τα δύο πρώτα στην Ελλάδα και ανεμένετο το τρίτο), σκέφτηκα με τη μία: "με τέτοια εξώφυλλα άσε καλύτερα, τι να είναι, τίποτα άρλεκιν θα είναι" (so much for not judging a book from its cover).
Where the first book was about childhood and adolescence, with the microcosmic world of girlhood friendships (and conflicts) and aspirations, this book focuses on the two women, Lila and Elena, in their upper teen years.
And would all that I was learning at school dissolve, would the neighborhood prevail again, the cadences, the manners, everything be confounded in black mire?"Elena struggles to fit in; her romances don't work out and Lila even as a married woman seems to have more allure.
I also cannot take for granted that the people in this book are from a poor neighbourhood and the struggles of life typically force individuals to assume certain responsibilities sooner than they ought to.Though the story is still narrated by Lenu/Elena, Lila still holds quite a portion of the story, so that their stories are so mingled, even when they are no longer as close as they were before.
Ferrante's story telling captures the flow of life, in its tragedies and triumphs, its passions, betrayal, defeats, resilience, drawing in the reader so that by the time this ended I couldn't wait to go on with the next book in the series.
Frustration is the underlying motivation for each character, manifesting in different ways for the individuals, but in repetitive and self-reinforcing patterns that in turn create a chain of similar outcomes within the community: violence, broken marriages, and suffocating, unhappy lives.At the centre of the novel, though viewed from a somewhat removed position is Lila’s frustration, her failure of self-actualisation arising from her early marriage and truncated education.
Elena’s own path to education seems impossibly difficult, threatened not only by envious attempts at sabotage but by the passive friction of expectation and ignorance even of the possibilities that life can offer.
How masterful Ferrante's writing is, managing to unfold the complexities of life in a poor neighbourhood of Naples in the early 60's, but most importantly, the human complexities, especially of the two female protagonists, Lila and Elena (Lenu).
Beauty can be both a blessing and a curse.Elena (Lenu) is still our narrator.
While no two people read and understand a book the same way, this novel is even more likely to be experienced differently by each and every reader - which makes it even more special.I personally am so enthralled by this book, it's almost overwhelming.
Βλέπω παντού αστεράκια, πολλά αστεράκια 4 αστεράκια από δω 5 αστεράκια από κεί, κάποιοι θα βαζαν και 15 αν μπορούσαν το νιώθω και θέλω να πετάξω το 1 το αστεράκι αλλά φοβούμαι τις απανταχού φανατικές αναγνώστριες.
Όχι πλάκα κάνω 3 αστεράκια αλλά μέχρι εκεί και αυτό περισσότερο γιατί αναγνωρίζω την ποιότητα της συγγραφέως αλλά δυστυχώς ούτε και στο δεύτερο βιβλίο βρήκα κάποιο στοιχείο που να μου κρατήσει τόσο πολύ αμείωτο το ενδιαφέρον.
Θα μου πεις για να σε συγκινήσει ένα βιβλίο δε σημαίνει απαραίτητα ότι πρέπει να αγαπήσεις τους κεντρικούς ήρωες αλλα αυτές οι δύο μανταμίτσες ούτε καν το νεύρο κρόσσι δε μου κάνουν να χω τουλάχιστον κάτι να τις κράξω.
