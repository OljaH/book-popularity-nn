Read my theories at the end, those who have read this series, and tell me if I'm wrong.I fully expected to enjoy this book, or at least find plenty of entertainment value, given that it was written by Julie Kagawa.I was wrong.Last week I read the fantastically craptastic Firelight which was essentially Twilight with dragons.
Fuck, I liked the much-reviled and oftentimes stupid Meghan in the Iron Fey series, I overlooked the tragic love triangle, because those books were fun.
Instead, I got a main character who's a dragon but really just wanted to fit in with the humans.
Could this really be the same author who wrote The Iron King?Never have I heard of dragons being boring.
Why do authors think we, teenagers, love those so much?
I think, with her being a dragon, the author wanted to make her seem original and spectacular but, really, she’s just plain unimpressive.
Julie Kagawa knows how to write a story.
Basically, it is well-written, has a crappy romance, uninteresting characters (except for Dante—Ember’s brother,) a plot that is predictable and lacks of surprises and dragons that will leave you…emotionless.Not recommended, except if you’re a die-hard fan of Julie Kagawa and love everything she writes.

On our segment of "REALLY?!?!"
1. Dialogue so cheesy you could grate it...
2. Heroine too trusting of the wrong people in very bad situations...
3. Frustrating amounts of NO ACTION...
4. Love triangle introduced in the last 20% of the book...
5.One guy has rape-y vibes and one guy wants to shoot her in her head...
6. Cliff hanger ending with no resolution as a marketing ploy to get you to buy the next book...
Thank you this has been your segment of "REALLY?"
Plus, throw in a bunch of regular YA paranormal cliches like a love triangle and this book, despite the original-sounding premise, was nothing special.
Kagawa's other books aren't exactly dazzling with originality, but they are compulsively readable and addictive.
I've had less time lately and maybe the constant putting it down and picking it up made it difficult for me to become fully invested in the story, but I'm not going to waste any more of my precious reading time on a book that isn't doing it for me.
Ember and Dante are supposed to learn how to assimilate with humans during their summer in California, while training to become actual members of Talon and start to work for the organization.
All she does is rambles about how bad is Talon, because they make her listen to the rules and train her to become a real dragon, while she wants to go for a walk with her friends.
You get it, Ember?The girl also does this strange thing when she talks about herself as a dragon and herself as a human, like they are two different persons.
Hear goes another review! So I will start by letting you know I read this whole beast of a book in 5, 30 min reading sprints. Yes it was that good! I loved the fact it was a fantasy based in modern time all about kick ass dragons that roam around as humans. Almost like the fantastical version of Hannah Montana! I can not wait for the second book! I currently have a headache from reading so much but just believe that this book is amazing! you all must read it! Ben ox

u_uPrior to reading this book, I was like:Because it's Julie!
I mean, granted, Julie's series' were never really that original either, but at least things actually happened in those books, and the characters were wonderful.
Most of the time it didn't even feel like this was her book, because I know for a fact that she can do so much better.But the big question is, do I still have hope for this series?Well...Fuck, I have no clue.
When you read the first book in a series and barely give a crap about the characters, how would you continue on with the sequels?*sigh* I don't know, you guys.
And I have a feeling that there will be a lot of surprises in the next books in the series, so I'm really looking forward to that.The characters - gah, I loved them all!
MONTHS.I'm going to go insane.---------------------------------------------------------------------------EDIT May 6th 2014: To all those people who have their hands on the arc......I WILL COME TO YOUR HOUSE AT NIGHT AND STEAL IT FROM YOU.(No I won't, I'm just bluffing, but in my mind I am definitely planning something.)---------------------------------------------------------------------------EDIT April 15th 2014: THE COVER IS FINALLY OUT.Dragon scales.
And I absolutely love the dragon in the "O".I WANT THIS BOOK NOW, DAMMIT.
Because I HATED Talon with every fiber of my being and can't even think of ONE redeeming quality, aside from perhaps the fact that my roommate and I had a joyous time bonding over our simultaneous hate-reads of this audiobook.
Sometimes reading a bad book can be fun, I'll admit it.
A fun YA romance about dragons pretending to be humans -- sounds at least entertaining, right?
I think reading this book took years off my life, and all I wanted was a fun dragon romp.
It should have focused more on world building and a more epic plot… this IS dragons we are talking about here after all.Ember is a little dragon who just got her biggest wish granted; to spend all summer doing things she wants to do with minimal adult supervision.
I mean I get why the love triangle is there, to reflect Ember's inner struggle between her human side and her dragon side, but I would appreciate it if it would focus less on that and more on other devices because If I had to point to one thing that dragged throughout the story it would have to be the romance.Talon was so focused on the romance that it kind of lost its edge.
A ruse. That's all it was. Pretend to like this girl. Pretend to have feelings, to pursue some kind of relationship. Earn her friendship and trust, knowing I might have to destroy it, and her, in the end. Ruthless. Julie Kagawa is ruthless. Mad. Intoxicating...Brilliant. I just....I don't get why people aren't loving this one. Is it the content? Is it because it's about dragons and you just can't get past it? Is it the non-existent love triangle? The not-so-insta-love? Is it because it isn't ov
She had, very inexplicably, become the most important thing in my life.And that terrified me.This is Julie Kagawa-Her romance is unrivaled and she embraces forbidden love like she would coddle a child.
I don't know when or how, but he got under my skin...and every time he doubted himself or how he would ever be able to kill this girl he was holding and hoping wasn't the sleeper, my heart broke a little more...and my evil side cackled without remorse.At certain (okay, many) points near the end of the story I was gasping out loud, shooting my hand up to stifle my weird sounds, chanting 'oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no...'.
What I THOUGHT Talon would have:• Epic dragon battles and wars• FIREBREATHING!• Dragon lore• Dragon politics• Awesome dragon heroine• Epic romanceWhat Talon ACTUALLY had:• Beaches, parties, the mall, boys, surfing• Very little action, with a super slow pace• Practically NO world building• Girl kicks guy where 'the sun don't shine'• Insta-love...
All I wanted was an epic dragon book and instead I got a pretty typical teenage girl book, with a small dragon element on the side.
Like,"I'm pretending to be a regular teenage girl, but I could shift into a dragon if I wanted to.
Guys, just go read that instead.
That's what I'm coining this phenomena.When, at around 60 pages I'm already smacked in the face with:- beautiful main characters- beautiful love interests- a third party making unwanted sexual advances to female MC just so male LI can step in and rescue her- a beautiful bad-boy to possibly serve as a future love-triangle- said beautiful bad-boy already demonstrating interest in female MC- plus female MC seems to be ignorant of the fact that beautiful bad-boy shows interest in her- the impending over-used snoozefest that is Paranormal/Fantasy-Tropes-Somehow-Forced-Into-High-Schoolthen you can kiss me goodbye because I'm done with you.Look, I know this book is Young Adult.
I was expecting a Young-Adult novel, focusing ON this wicked new dragonlore.
3.5 stars (0.5 stars for sentimental value) "We were taught their entire blood-filled history, from the dragonslayers, to the fanatical Templar Knights, all the way up to the militaristic order they were now... St. George was ruthless and cunning and unmerciful, the enemy of all of our kind." Look at that passage. Just look at it. Does it not reek of potential? Does it not guarantee High Fantasy epicness in the form of dragon vs human smackdowns? Does it not promise you incredible things??Now ta
Does it not promise you incredible things??Now take a look at this:
"I remembered the heat of [the strange dragon]'s gaze, the instant awakening of something fierce and primal inside me when our eyes met."
It would've been fine as a 2010 Paranormal Romance, but you signed up for man-eating dragons, dammit, and you want them to fry a man's eyeballs off!Then it happens.
Near the end of the book when you've lost nearly all the fucks you can give: an epic dragon fight.
The book ends with the promise of more fights and dragon action.
The premise of a book about a teenage dragon assimilating to life amongst the human race, whilst in her human form, was intriguing, but whilst reading, this felt like more of a straight-forward romance for the most part.
I would have liked to form more of an emotional investment with the characters, but I felt it difficult when I was only given this side to them.I will continue with the series as I am interested to see where the novel goes but I am hesitant that it will only have more of the same superfluous love scenes and little actual plot development.
Rating: 3.5 / 5 starsI received this book for free from the publisher through Netgalley in exchange for an honest review.An exciting start to what should be a promising series.
It is an intriguing concept, with dragons hidden amidst a modern setting, and I really loved progressively learning more about Talon and St George.It took me a little while to get really invested in the story.
The tension and pacing quickly escalates into some crazy action and leaves room for plenty of excitement and drama to come.

No tittle, no synopsis, no release date, written by Julie Kagawa...Update!!!!! IT HAS A TITTLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! IT'S ABOUT DRAGONS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!(this gif kills me! lol)OMG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I CAN'T WAIT!!!!!!!!!!!!UPDATE!!!!!It has a cover! And it looks so pretty! And a synopsis! It's going to be so cool!
➸  Book 2  : Rogue ✬✬✬ (2.5)Actual rating : 3.5 starsDeciding to read Talon was an instant-jerk reaction for me. After reading a bunch of mixed reviews, I reached the decision to never, ever read it. Guess I was fucking wrong. Because what happened next is kind of a blur : reading Chelsea's review - downloading it - eating it - loving it.I ended to disagree with almost all the warnings I read before. Go figure. Maybe I'm a weirdo. *shrug*About what have I been warned?  Be careful, the main chara
Here's the thing : I loved Ember from the beginning - she was a fierce and strong-minded character, and I really enjoyed following her during her let's try to live as humans journey.
Yes, I know, I'm stunned too - because usually, I seem to develop a strong hate toward the other guy, where here, well, I was pleasantly surprised to find myself laughing at his jokes and rooting for him - to a certain extent, of course, these boundaries being Garret's happiness.
No. Come on, dragons.Postman - Yes but you know *whisper* it seems not as good as usual.
2 stars.
I read this book a while back, and tried re-reading it this past month before I realized I had already read it.
Talon read like a cookie-cutter YA novel.
I am extremely disappointed in it, especially since this is Julie Kagawa.
I don't think I have it in me to read the sequel for such a lackluster start to this series.
OMG.She could be writing a book about how a llama and a panda fell in love and I'd still read it.MUSTHAVENOW.And why is everybody freaking out over the love triangle issues?
Guys, this the legendary Julie Kagawa.
Damn, this sounds really cool. And I really liked Julie Kagawa's Blood of Eden series.However, I see a lot of people are saying it's disappointing so I'm a bit hesitant. But I will probably still read it at some point, because ........ DRAGONSSSSS
WrensReads Review:I'm not going to spend too much time writing a review on this book.I did like it, don't get me wrong, but it was just so predictable to the point that I was skimming some of the pages.
I am going to read the next book because it does have potiental.
I mean, this book felt like a set-up book in all honesty, so maybe the next books are going to blow my mind and I am going to fall in love with the writing as it matures?
I think you have to have the good cop / bad cop thing going on to create this particular story though.
I loved the characters of Garret and Riley!
Riley is a Rogue dragon that left Talon because he knew they were full of crap.
I loved Ember's character because she wanted nothing more than to be free to do what she wanted and to be a dragon when she wanted.
I think/hope this is a good thing because not everyone is what they seem and it just goes to show you should never just trust in the operation/group that you are in.
Was not disappointed.Summary: Ember and Dante are dragons disguised as humans.
They are learning to act human by making friends with humans and doing fun human things, while doing secret dragon training on the side.
He does this by making friends with humans and doing fun human things.I liked these characters.
The first part is mostly boy/girl drama, which is fun but less dragon-y.
Without the dragon action, this is a pretty average, 3-star read.It's not exactly a work of genius but it is a fun story with likable characters and plenty of drama.
"[...] as is the case with YA books, a love triangle."GOD DAMMIT KAGAWA
But there is something missing here.The story is not all there, and the romance is too superficial.
More development and connexions between the characters are needed, more deepness.
The characters and fantasy are feeble.
The dragon part is too weak.
To me, it needed to be more prevalent and powerful in the story.
More fantasy.
The dragon characters are puny and too human.
Ember is too high-school to be believable as a dragon who grew up in a different community.
I might give the second book a chance, but I am not very hopeful.
P.S.:I am a bit surprised this is a Julie Kagawa's book.
I really enjoyed this book. It was entertaining and the characters were likeable. It was predictable but still enjoyable. I will continue on in the series for sure. Fun and easy read that was amusing and lighthearted.
Talon tells the story of Ember Hill, a female shape-shifting dragon (dragonelle) who is tasked with blending in with the humans for the summer in California.
Whilst there, she faces many difficulties, including falling for a human (a big no no), and becoming close to a Rogue, a dragon who has left the Talon organisation (an even bigger no no).
Talon is a secret society, a secret dragon society, who has to blend in with humans in order to avoid detection from the Order of St George, whose sole aim is to eradicate the world of the dragon problem.
A secret faction of dragon slayers called the Order of St. George is determined not to let that happen, and their members continue to hunt dragons like they have for time immemorial.The book begins as two young dragon siblings, Ember and Dante Hill travel to California in their human forms to begin training for their future positions to serve their home base of Talon.
Meanwhile, St. George has received the rumors of new dragon recruits in the area, and the young soldier Garret Xavier Sebastian and his partner are tasked to hunt these Talon agents down and kill them.Encouraged to mingle and blend in with other teenagers, Ember and Dante spend most of this book as humans.
