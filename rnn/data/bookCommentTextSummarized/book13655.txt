I'm no fan of the Rumpelstiltskin tale, and probably never will, but since it's Zelinsky I couldn't resist picking the book up. The art in this edition has a certain likeness to Renaissance paintings, which I'm sure is intentional.
Zelinsky‚Äôs writing and illustrations contribute greatly to the story‚Äôs tension as the miller‚Äôs daughter tries to save herself from being put to death by the king and then from allowing the little man to take her child.
Zelinsky makes the story extremely intense and dramatic as he puts death and child kidnapping as the main themes of the story and he brilliant makes his writing dramatic during the scenes of the miller‚Äôs daughter being threatened with death and during the threat that the little man poses to her when he tries to take her baby.
First, a very important thing!
*throws the king by the window* Ok, now it's time for the review.
I never heard about Rumpel-whatever before watching the first season of the TV show Once Upon A Time.
This picture book was an interesting adaptation, I particularly enjoyed the art that looked like old paints (Renaissance?), giving a good atmosphere, and it was perfect for things like gold.
The story was well paced and satisfying regarding the outcome and the heroine, but wow the king was an evil and greedy creature, I think I preferred Rumple.
This is a beyond gorgeous retelling of the classic Rumpelstiltskin. I really enjoyed Zelinsky‚Äôs Rapunzel so I was looking looking forward to this book, and I was not disappointed. I was practically getting lost in the detailed illustrations and the storyline that flowed beautifully with the pictures. An excellent read that I would highly recommend to anyone!
I have this book in my bookshelf because it is one of my favorite illustrated book with Paul O. Zelinksy medieval style to a fairy tale classic. I highly recommend this book if you are a fan of beautiful fairy tale artwork.
Rumpelstiltskin is one of those fairy tales that I loved reading as a child.
This was one of my favorite books not only because of the story but the lovely traditional artwork done in oil painting by the author.
This version is a combination of different versions.The story begins with a miller who meets the king on the road and tells the king his daughter can turn ordinary wheat into gold.
The story is simplistic and not everything is explained but that is customary to most fairy tales in picture books, so I can shrug off some of the plot holes I encountered.There is more then one moral in this story.
Every evening a little man saves her by magically spinning the gold and getting jewelry in return, and by morning the king is satisfied and let her live.
If she can find out his name by the next time he visits, she can keep her child.I think there's an interesting theme in this story.
He actually gave the woman a second chance to keep her baby, though he could have just taken it - he was a magical person that were able to sneak in and out of the castle unseen, not to mention spinning straw into gold.
The illustrations are amazing and remind my of Renaissance paintings.
I would use Zelinsky's version to teach the story since it is clear and well told.
I would also use his illustrations to showcase artistic skills and for art criticism lessons.
In this version, a father claims his daughter can spin straw into gold.
He leaves her with the king who will kill her is she cannot spin an entire room of straw into gold over night.
Rumpelstiltskin offers to help the first night for a necklace and the next for a ring.
The text is true to the Grimm version but kind of boring, so the paintings were crucial to give the story sparkle.
Logan, who is almost 7, has asked me many questions since about the nature of Rumplestiltskin: Was he evil?
I explained that he was more like fairies or leprechauns; not exactly evil, but out for his own gain and mischief and not too concerned about humans.
Interesting that L had no questions about the king, who was only interested in the miller's daughter for her ability to create gold and willing to threaten her with death and then 3 days later, to want to marry her.
Love the illustrations!
I read this story as a child, and I really loved it.

Rumpelstiltskin Retold & Illustrated by Paul ZelinskyGrade level: K-2Genre: Folk TaleTheme: Success This version of Rumpelstiltskin is derived from the original version written by the Grimm Brothers from Germany.
In this story, a poor miller meets a king and volunteers his daughter to work for a king.
Her job is to spin straw into gold.
Twice, the king told her she must produce the gold by night or she would die.
The only problem is she doesn‚Äôt know how to spin straw into gold.
I would use this book to assess comprehension and how well students can recall the events of the story.
Perhaps because of the realistic, painterly illustrations, the students experienced some confusion about the extent to which the story really did take place in the world they knew, just in a different time and place.
One boy seemed determined to take "spin straw into gold" as a figure of speech until the little man actually appeared, perhaps because he knew the phrase from the story but not the story itself.
The little details like the fire at the end of the path travelled by the maid to find Rumpelstiltskin's camp make all the difference, and Zelinski's illustrations give kids more than enough to search for.
