and intrigue!i fell in love with this world for both the action sequences and the interludes of catworld mythology and history, which are very detailed and add a density to a story that, in my description anyway, seems like it is slight: cat looks for missing friend.
and this is better than titanic by many leagues.and it is not slight at all (despite what modern paper would have you believe) - it has interspecial relationships (not those kind of relationships, grosso) and stories within stories, and it is a cat coming-of-age story as well as an adventure story with battles.
I have a rule with books.
If I can’t get into it I put it down.
I will then try a few weeks later.
If I fail again I will try in a few months.
I broke my rule with this.
I tried this book no less than six times over the last year.
I should love it, but I can’t seem to get past those first few chapters.
I don’t want to carry on reading.
The plot provides no inciting incident to make me want to follow it to the end.
I’m trying to find a way to say how much I loved this book and look manly at the same thing… but fuck it!
It got it all:Cute cats [X]More cute cats [X]Cat fights [X]Evil cats [X]Crazy cats [X]Some kick ass cat fight scenes [X] [X] [X]Cool comic relieve cats [X]Romantic interest that actually interesting cats [X] (Roofshadow kick ass!)Warrior cats [X]Lazy bitch cat [X] (Hushpad you suck you lazy bitch!!!!)Cats in the water, cats in the air, cats on ice, cats on boats, cats on trees, cats in the ocean, cats on fire, evil cats even cats in the air [X] [X] [X] [X] [X] [X] [X]Over all is a lovely book about a cute cat trying to find out who he really is… even if he doesn’t know that’s his real quest…
His not really his friend boss (played by Paul Calderon) looks at him with abject disgust and proclaims: "You crackhead motherfucker." It's not that good of a film but I always liked the way that Calderon says that line at the precise moment when Imperioli couldn't lie anymore about being anything else.
Tailchaser's Song is better than the other pathetic attempts on my part to recreate Watership Down.
You know when they go home and they have to leave the amazing friends they made behind?
This one might really be just like Watership Down...
Tailchaser's Song is a generic fantasy questing novel with larger-than-life gods and a feline wrapping--but, unfortunately, Williams knows nothing about cats.
I do not recommend it.In plot, pacing, and writing style, Tailchaser's Song is unexceptional but not that bad.
Williams knows how to write a novel, if not a very good one, and the book follows many common fantasy tropes.
Tailchaser is an unassuming small "town" youth who leaves on an ill-advised quest which leads him to a big city, to an enemy city, and up against a scheming powerful antagonist so that good may triumph against evil.
Williams paces his book well, and Tailchaser's journey feels realistically long while maintaining interesting variety.
Another long ago read that I can't quite remember. I did own it but lent it out and never saw it again. I have mental images of a cat with red claws, evil cats with chilling graveyard breath, and a climactic showdown involved a Jabba-the-Hut-sized evil cat god. I think I cried, too, but I can't remember why or for what...need to read this again.
A Cat's Life12 February 2017 I remember seeing this book at my friend's house years ago and borrowing it for a bit of a read.
Mind you my friend is a bit of a booknerd like me, though these days our tastes in books have taken a bit (or a lot) of a divergence.
The thing is that while he went on to study social work I went on to study an arts degree.
The other thing is that I had an English teacher that would rile against what he considered to be airport trash, and books like those by Stephen King
Mind you, whenever I am in an airport I do like to have a wander through the bookshop just to see what is actually sitting on the shelf and to see if there are actually any books that my teacher would actually approve, and while it has been years since I was in his class, and am not even sure if he is still teaching English, I still wonder whether Life of Pi would actually appear on his list of banned books, considering the last time I wondered through an airport bookshop that was the only book that I thought would be acceptable to him (though I suspect that Fifty Shades of Grey would).
Anyway, on to this book, even though it has been quite a while since I have read it, but the fact that I have read it (albeit a long time ago) I feel that I should probably say a few things about it.
If you are one of those people waiting for me to get back to you with any of that stuff, I can confidently promise you that I will take less than twenty-six years to do so.I remember Tailchaser's Song as an instant success that launched Tad's writing career.
But I'm thinking about writing a novel about cats, so it seemed like a good time to read one, just as a learning experience.
I'm very impressed by such stuff -- it's exactly the kind of writing I'm bad at, and Tad pulled it off very smoothly in this, his very first book, when he was much younger than I am now.
I've been wanting to read Tailchaser's Song for a long time, while not being quite sure whether I'd really like it.
Fortunately, he didn't do too much of that here: you're left to play catch-up a bit, at times, which I honestly prefer.The cats are sweet, but they're also not just sweet.
They felt like cats.
I loved Pouncequick, and Roofshadow -- I was less pleased with Hushpad, being such a non-entity and with the ending, because geez, what a cliché, and how far away did I see that coming?Still, a quick and fun read, and one that'll stay in my collection.
Αυτο το βιβλίο ειναι τόσο μα τόσο ωραιο! Το προτείνω σε μικρούς και μεγάλους, αγόρια κ κορίτσια, σε φιλόζωους, σε αυτούς που τους αρέσουν οι περιπέτειες και τα μεγάλα ταξίδια αναζήτησης, οι παλίοι μύθοι και οι παραμυθάδες που αρέσκονται να λένε ιστορίες τις σκοτεινές νύχτες! Έγινε ένα απο τα αγαπημένα μου!
"Tailchaser's Song" has an interesting story, and the author did a good job of giving the animals different cultures.
But I felt nothing for the characters.
You meet Hushpad once, and she becomes Tailchaser's best friend somehow.
The only characters with personality were the squirrels (who have a cool way of talking), Eatbugs (for whom I lost my respect after a cliché plot twist), and the evil cats (I made myself think they were awesome because I needed to think that about someone to keep my sanity..).
Pouncequick kind of had character but not much.
My friend is gonna kill me. I don't think I'm cut out for talking animal books. I seriously tried.😞
I read this book years ago and loved it to bits, so when I saw it in a bookshop recently I just had to buy it.
Now it is always very different reading a book years on, especially when you have such high expectations, but overall this didn't disappoint.
This book is essentially about cats, or the folk, as they like to call themselves and one kitten in particular, Fritti Tailchaser, who goes on a desperate quest to discover what has happened to his beloved Hushpad, who has disappeared along with many others of the folk.
Entretenida historia donde nos mente en la artificiosa vida del gato salvaje.
Esta vez sin la excesiva paja que este autor a mostrados en sus sagas fantásticas.
Para una corta historia de libro único.Cazarrabo es un valiente gato en un reino de gatos.
En ese mundo no varía nada del nuestro real, pues hay más especies, hay humanos… pero vemos todo según lo vería los gatos.
Tras varias desapariciones de gatos, y el remate es que no sepa donde esta su amada.
Cazarrabo tendrá la misión de viajar hasta donde vive la reina de los gatos para avisar y pedir ayudar de lo que sucede.
I believe some people are being overcritical of certain aspects of the book and are actually overlooking the fact that its supposed to be from a cat's point of view, not a human's.
Not one of us can say that we know what cats think or know, so there's no point in getting upset with a book because it is speculating on such things.
You will lose sight of the true meaning and lessons of the actual story.It is probably time for me to read this book again, but, being the cat lover that I am, I'm fairly certain I will find it just as wonderful now as I did when I was a teenager.
Aun así, considero que es un buen libro y, gracias a un manejo adecuado de las descripciones, es fácil adentrarse en el mundo de Cazarrabo.Hay también algunos personajes destacables, entre ellos la inteligente fela (“hembra” en el idioma de los gatos) Sombra y Saltarín, un jovencísimo gatito amigo de Cazarrabo capaz de derretir al lector o lectura con su personalidad infantil.
Recomiendo el libro a cualquiera que le guste la fantasía épica, sea amante de los gatos y, por otro lado, esté dispuesto/a a leer una historia con ricas descripciones y muchísimos nombres de personajes, clanes y lugares.
Nada más leer una parte de la sinopsis: “Cuando algunos miembros de la comunidad felina desaparecen misteriosamente, Fritti Cazarrabo intenta convencer al resto del clan de que se tomen medidas.
Pero cuando desaparece su mejor amiga, Pata Suave, Fritti no puede esperar más y decide actuar por su propia cuenta.” hay una clara referencia que es La colina de Watership de Richard Adams cambiando conejos por gatos.Creo que a todo aquel que le haya gustado el de Adams le gustará este.
Tal vez no tanto ya que no es tan estricto en el comportamiento de los animales y se nota una clara influencia de Disney en el antropomorfismo que poseen los gatos.
3,5/5Ha sido más interesante de lo que me esperaba La verdad es que no pensaba que sería demasiado fantasioso, pero el tema de la esclavitud y demás me ha parecido interesante. Eso sí, el libro está muy estirado y necesitaría una buena tijera.
Últimamente he desarrollado una afición malsana por las historias contadas a través de ojos felinos.
Y ésta no me ha dejado indiferente.‘La canción de Cazarrabo’ nos acerca a un mundo de fantasía, en el que los gatos cuentan con su propio lenguaje, su propia mitología, sus propios dioses y diosas, y sus propios razonamientos sobre el porqué de la existencia.Cada palabra dedicada a comprender este misticismo ha conseguido sobrecoger todo mi ka.
Por lo que cuatro estrellas brillan hoy impávidas en el firmamento.
La tercera es Meerclar, tan blanca en la noche como gotitas de azúcar.
entonces otra estrella se habría unido al resto en su lento brillar.Aun así, juro por Harar que en mis siete vidas había dado con una historia igual.
Growing up surrounded by cats of every size, color, and temperament, it was definitely interesting to read Williams' take on the ways these creatures live.
I really wanted to give this 5 stars but there were some scenes that lagged, some short narratives that i really felt need not be included in the chapter, there were loads of symbolism (which i didn't even dare discern), and the ending felt hurried.Despite of that, readers will still adore Tailchaser, the effervescent Pouncequick, and the gruff Fencewalker.
This book was quite a fun book to read!
I remember reading it several years ago, but I honestly could not remember the story very well.
What I did retain from the first time I read it was some of the vernacular.
What starts out as a happy little cat story, definitely takes a dark turn a little less than half way through.
Because if it isn't there, I never really lost it to begin with." - Dorothy) For a first book, Tad Williams does an excellent job!It probably helps to have a love of cats to truly enjoy this book.
I loved this book!
It does seem obvious to me that Tad Williams does not actually know very much about cats.
That being said, viewing this book as fantasy (ie.
not real life), I loved the story.
Tad Williams created an epic story of a young cat and his companions, and the great adventure which they embark on, complete with cat gods, great evil, and cute fluffy kittens.
I would recommend this book to both fantasy readers, and cat lovers alike!
>Originally read in late 2011.>Reread January, 2014I love this book so much I named my cat, then a kitten, Fritti (Tailchaser's heart name, used among loved ones).I wish the ending could have been a bit more clear.
I believe Hearteater's goal was to (view spoiler)[tunnel to every cat home and lead a secret attack on each in turn (hide spoiler)].
It's kind of hinted at throughout the book, but no one states that was his plan outright.
I'm not usually a person who needs things spelled out for me, but I do think the facts should be solidly presented at some point in a story; we really only got hints, instead.
Considering the human obsession with cats, this is an obvious book to write; but at the same time it takes courage to write it becuase it is so easy to fail.
I think that as a 40-50 page story it would have been wonderful, but as a 300+ pages novel it starts to drag after 100 pages or so.
I found myself reading it just to finish it, which is a sentiment I don't like.The main characters are very engaging and the overall cat mindset and culture is is very well handled.
The story itself is a bit weak, particularly the villain.
There are a few bits of magic, lots of poetry and songs, and an epic battle scene.Just...with cats.Characters:The vast majority of the story is told from Tailchaser's third-person point of view, with occasional passages being offered from another character's perspective.
No spoilers in this section, but I will say that one of the most climatic moments of the novel ends up being glossed over as after-the-fact exposition rather than shown directly.Notes:Personally, I came away from this book with the feeling that it should have begun when Tailchaser reached the Court of Harar.
Really enjoyed this one and... It's my 90th book this year! I have met my 2017 reading goal!When I saw this one at work I could immediately tell it was like the Warriors books (which I read almost all of) and I got so excited. It was really wonderful <3
Tad Williams ha conseguido que me gusten los gatos. Quiero un Saltarín en mi vida!
Oh Fritti! He reminds me of my Marlowe. I really enjoyed this book. It needs to be a movie - it has everything!

Desde luego, se nota que Tad Williams ha tenido gatos, porque describe con sumo detalle todas las actitudes de estos animales y las utiliza para crear un mundo sumamente consistente teniendo en cuenta el punto de vista felino.Este elemento es muy original, aunque eso no evita que el autor siga al pie de la letra el viaje del héroe de Joseph Campbell.
