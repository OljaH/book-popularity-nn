You quit Crime Squad for good, sulking from the trauma and devastation in your life caused chasing down that twisted Snowman.
Then this woman Kaja from Oslo Crime Squad shows up at you doorstep, pays your gambling debt and convinces you to come back to Oslo and chase down yet another Norwegian serial killer.
Who knows and who cares.
Nothing is ever straight forward in you life is it Harry?
But I know you will be back.
There is always another nut job serial killer out there and who else can find them?
Nesbø's Harry Hole books should come with at least two warnings on them; Never start to read one if you need a full night of sleep (you will be up until way too late because the story is just too addictive), and never start to read one if you don't have at least one more Harry Hole, ideally in chronological order lined up waiting for you next, since you'll probably be going on Harry Hole binge.This one would work great outside the series too, but it is much more enjoyable if you read the HH books in order.Nordic noir is an understatement.
Number 8 in the Harry Hole series and maybe the best out of all of them so far!
Harry is by now a confirmed alcoholic and spends a lot of his time in drunken binges but when a new serial killer comes on the scene he manages to stay sober long enough to solve the case.
Despite his failings Harry is still such a likeable character and always smart enough to win out over criminals and bent police officers.
I very much enjoy this series and am glad I still have two more to go at least!
Οι τρεις αγαπημένοι μου Χαρούληδες (όχι απαραίτητα με αυτή τη σειρά) είναι οι εξής:1ον) Χάρι Πότερ για τις αναμνήσεις των εφηβικών – φοιτητικών χρόνων και την αγωνία για κάθε καινούριο βιβλίο 2ον) Χάρι Χόλε για τα αξημέρωτα βράδια που αγωνιούσα ποιος είναι ο δολοφόνος και αν θα επιβιώσει ο αγαπημένος μου επιθεωρητής ή αν θα τα σκατώσει εξαιτίας του ποτού3ον) Γιάννης Χαρούλης γιατί… εντάξει, έχετε πάει σε live του; Πάμε λοιπόν στο νο 2, όπου σε αυτή την περιπέτεια τα πράγματα… δεν έχουν πολύ σχέση με τους άλλους δυο Χαρούληδες, από θέμα διασκέδασης, ζωντάνιας και αισιοδοξίας μιλάω πάντα.
Eventually he gets pulled deeper and deeper into the orbit of the psychotic murderer (note: the killer narrates certain sections, which are italicized, a very creepy, effective touch).This is a long novel, and as with The Snowman, there’s a lot of setup, but that only makes you invested in the characters and situations so you’ll be turning those pages late into the night and saying, “One more chapter… okay, one more" until you're done.There’s also a rich theme about fathers and sons that’s very poignant.

The case had taken a very heavy toll on him personally and his reaction to it all was to quit the Oslo police force and run away to Hong Kong where he lost himself in the city's notorious opium dens.
Harry now agrees to return, but insists that he's going back only to see his father and that he has no intention of returning to the police force.Famous last words.
Harry's investigation and the turf battle with Mikael Bellman are both compelling plots that run through the book, and this winds up being one of the best entries in the series thus far.
Unless you have come to respect Harry’s tenacity in police work and love him for his courage and loyalty to the deserving few, these sections will not warm your heart to him.The urgency for the implausible step of the Oslo office to track him down in person comes from a new serial killer case in Norway.
His old boss Gunnar Hagen needs him badly to solve the case fast before media criticism of his division and public outcry over the extreme brutality of the deaths helps the new man at the federal security agency, Bellman, wangle designated responsibility for all murders out of the Ministry of Justice.
Επιτέλους το κατάφερα!!! Λατρεύω Χάρι Χολε.. Πρέπει να διαβάσω σύντομα και άλλα απο τη σειρα! Ελπιζω να καταφέρω να γραψω κριτική σύντομα!
Μπράβο!(όσοι διαβάζατε τα updates μου μετά λύπης εχω να σας ενημερώσω ότι Οχι, τελικά έφτασα πολύ κοντά αλλά δεν βρήκα τον δολοφονο😟)Απ'την άλλη φυσικά υπάρχει η προσωπική ζωή του Χάρι ο οποίος σ'αυτό το βιβλίο έχει να αντιμετωπίσει (Εκτός απ'τα γνωστά ερωτικά του δραματα) τον επικείμενο θανάτο του πατέρα του.
Έχουμε την ευκαιρία λοιπόν να παρακολουθήσουμε κάποιες σκηνές αρκετά συγκινητικές του Χάρι με τον Ούλε(σκηνές που γενικά ο Νεσμπο δε μας έχει δώσει σε αλλα βιβλία) στις οποίες διαγράφεται η εξέλιξη αυτης της σχέσης πατέρα-γιου.
Αν απλώς ψάχνετε ένα αστυνομικό, αξίζει παρα πολύ, αλλά δε θα εκτιμήσετε την "προσωπική" πλευρά του βιβλίου και θα 'ναι κρίμα!
Man, I was late to the party with Jo Nesbo. The Harry Hole series is riveting.
They are the crime forensics TV shows and gore-schlock movies of the publishing world, and I've read theories that the bleak and desolate landscapes and climates of the region are a natural setting and reason for such books.
Hole is just annoying and a coward - he doesn't even get inebriated as suavely as Chandler and Hammett characters.Then, the entire novel just feels like a TV show.
I finished the book as quickly as I could, just like any good homicide detective - so the perpetrator can't strike again - and felt the relief of finally resolving and closing the book of a wrongful crime.
All the same, I cannot remember the last time I read 311 pages of a book only to decide I couldn't be bothered to read the rest.
For one thing, this is not even half as good a book as The Snowman nor was its killer remotely as frightening and cool to read about.
The more I read, the more I kept alternating between bored out of my mind and irritated beyond belief.I thought that maybe I could put up with this for the sake of spending more time with Harry Hole.
However, I hated that --much like the last book-- there were several female characters who were into Harry because...
After catching the serial killer known as the Snowman Harry Hole quit the Crime Squad and lit out for Hong Kong where he could indulge in drinking, gambling and heroin in an attempt to forget about Rakel.
But now there has been a series of inexplicably linked deaths and Crime Squad want Harry back in Oslo and his ex-colleague Kaja Solness is sent to track him down.I think this might be my favourite Jo Nesbo to date (just ahead of The Snowman).
4,5*! Só não dei as cinco porque achei que o final foi um pouco confuso. Penso que ganhava mais se tivesse terminado o livro umas páginas antes, pois já não ficaria com a sensação de que andou a arrastar a história no final.Ainda assim, um livro muito empolgante, como sempre, daquele que é, atualmente, o meu escritor nórdico favorito! :) Sou completamente fã de Jo Nesbo!
I am, no doubt about it, a Nesbo fan.The Son is still my favorite of his books but I LOVE Harry Hole!And because I love Harry so much, it is difficult for me to see how his life takes a dark turn after a dark turn (was there a book in the series where Harry did not loose someone he loved??)In this installment the mystery is wonderful and I enjoyed it even though I did figure ahead of time some of the twists and turns.I’m dying to dive into the next book in the series!Thank you Lena and Sofia.
Για όλη την σειρά με τον Χάρι Χόλε : http://anotherlookforyou.blogspot.com...
Παρα τον περιορισμενο χρονο μου και την μεγαλη εκταση του βιβλιου δεν γινοταν να εχω μισαωρο κενο και να μην το πιασω στο χερια μου.!! Ηταν υπεροχο !! Αν ειμαι αντικειμενικη αυτη τη στιγμη, αφου δεν εχει περασει πανω απο ωρα που το τελειωσα, θα το ονομαςω το αγαπημενο μου απο nesbo μεχρι στιγμης!!
Και αυτό είναι για μένα το ενδιαφέρον στον Χόλε, ότι περιμένεις να δεις πόσο πιο πολύ θα τσαλακωθεί στο κάθε βιβλίο και πόσο πιο χαμηλά θα πέσει (μαζοχιστικό ακούγεται αυτό, θεωρώντας δεδομένο ότι τον δολοφόνο θα τον ανακαλύψει και ότι την γκόμενα του βιβλίου θα την καβαλήσει (ούτε ο Σπαλιάρας να ήταν…).Από εκεί και πέρα, οκ, υπάρχουν κάποια αρνητικά σημεία στο βιβλίο, όπως ότι οι δεύτεροι χαρακτήρες δεν αναπτύσσονται ιδιαίτερα, ότι καταλαβαίνεις πάλι πως υπάρχει μια συγκεκριμένη νόρμα στις ιστορίες του Nesbo, ότι στο τέλος ο Χόλε μοιάζει επικίνδυνα στον Ράμπο, ότι πάντα κινδυνεύουν όλοι όσοι είναι δίπλα του (μα πόσο γκαντέμης πια…), αλλά στην τελική: who cares???
Harry Hole – our hero – has now become an opium addict in Hong Kong, and rather than leave him there to rot, the Norwegian police sends a young female officer to bring him back and get him to lead a high-profile investigation.
It’s the kind of thing which happens in movies starring a Mel Gibson or a Sylvester Stallone, but in a supposedly ‘real world’ crime thriller requires the sensitive reader to swallow a huge amount of disbelief.The ending – again set away from Oslo – is also quite ludicrous (although I won’t spoil that for anyone).
A new officer in the Crime Squad, Maja Solness, is sent to Hong Kong to bring him back because his expertise is needed in a truly puzzling case.
Harry is not keen but, on being told his father is ill, agrees to return to Sweden.He enters a turf war between Crime Squad and Kripos which is not the best way to catch a killer.
Harry, Maja and Bjorn are investigating on the sly because the case has been given to Kripos and discover a missing person who may also be a victim of this killer.

It is just a crying shame that this novel is not going to be available in the U.S. right away, because really, American readers of Jo Nesbø are missing out on one of the very best books in the entire series.
In fact, in this episode of the Harry Hole series, the story picks up shortly after the events of The Snowman, which (without giving too much away) took their physical and emotional toll on Harry, sending him as far away from Norway and the police department as possible to Hong Kong.
Yes, in spite of my own statement in my reviews to the previous sequels (about a necessity of reading the series from the very beginning).
Actually you even NEED to read it ASAP.Probably my favourite instalment.
Brutal, be prepared, but absolutely unputdownable.I listened to an audio book in German.
And Uve Teschner, one of my favourite German narrators, was as always great.I was an awful BR buddy, but I blame Uve and Jo for it in the first place.
My initial plan JUST to try a sample in German ended with me purchasing an audio book and ME keeping listening to it and ME messing all our carefully scheduled BR's plans.
I would love to blame it on the fact that I started it while riding home from Pgh or that it took me over 10 days to finish (a VERY long time for me to finish a 500 page book) However, I think it's because there were way too many characters, too many plot twists, and Harry just lost a little something for me.
Harry Hole is a wonderfully developed character.
I like how Nesbo writes but I sure get angry with him because of the great big heavy burden he keeps pushing onto Harry grrrr. For God's sake give him a bloody break, why don't you. As you can see the above is a testament to how much I get into these stories and how reading one always makes me want to read more, always with that little hope that it will be easier for Harry this time round.A slightly skewed BR with my Harry Girls - Lena and Alona.
I love  Harry  as a character and especially enjoyed learning more about his relationship with his father and family.
he can live without anybody that's the point!I get that Nesbo likes to always have a girl for Harry - kind of like a bond girl but truly this is the only reason why I'm giving this book 4 stars and not 5.
It did nothing for the story or his character - it only bored me every time I had to read about it.
I love Harry Hole and I recommend this book to those who like crime stories and thrillers.
things I did not enjoy:- made up torture devices are ok, but presenting them as a real historical artefact stinks- Norwegian police routinely travel to civil-war plagued African countries to investigate on a whim, without any official liason, contact, legal backup, guns, preparation or even a fucking medical check.Nesbo is trying too hard and puts too many locations (rwanda, hong kong, germany, kongo...) the best part of the book the book takes place on a snowy plains in small tourist huts.
In Leopard he compensates by geographic location and cruelty- the climax was astonishingly pathetic.
Having enjoyed Wallander on TV, particularly Krister Henriksson's portrayal, I want to read all of Henning Mankel's series.
Hence when my book group chose Jo Nesbo's The Leopard I was just a bit excited!
Little did I know that The Leopard is the sixth book in the series and having not read any of the others, I feel I'm doing this back to front.
They break rules to get results.I will be reading all of Nesbo's Harry Hole books and I am anticipating that they are all as exciting and good as The Leopard.
A must read for all those who like a good crime novel.
After The Snowman, Harry Hole has earned the reputation as the serial killer slayer. That's why a colleague goes looking for Harry in Bangkok to enlist him in a new investigation. But Harry has to battle the new Kripos chief to find his new nemesis.
