The second book in the series and I enjoyed it every bit as much as I did the first.
It's the two main characters who absolutely make these books.
There is Amelia Peabody who believes herself to be the most intelligent person in any room - and sometimes she is, just not always.
Don't try to tell her that though!
People keep turning up dead, there are clues aplenty, most of them red herrings and at the end there is a gathering of characters where the whole affair is explained.
I needed that because I did not have a clue what was happening.
Walter and Evelyn were absent, and there were no new characters who balanced the intensity of Amelia and Emerson (which is needed, I think) or that I really cared about.
There were enough possible culprits that I really had no idea who it was until the end, but I didn't feel like I had enough information to figure it out, so the mystery was a bit lacking.
All that said, I still found Amelia and Emerson entertaining, even if they are a bit over the top.
For the uninitiated over the course of the series Mrs. Amelia Peabody Emerson, her cranky but brilliant Egyptologist husband Emerson, their semi-psycho brilliant son Ramses, adopted daughter Nefret and a host of other's who wander in and out of the narrative wander around Victorian era Egypt discovering tombs and solving murders and eventually getting mixed up in the things like World Wars, espionage and political upheaval in the Middle East.
Which is why I'm kind of baffled by how bizarre The Curse of the Pharaohs is.Several years have passed and Amelia and Emerson are petitioned by Lady Baskerville who's "archaeologist" husband (read: rich guy who liked Egypt stuff) has just died as a result of what everyone thinks is a curse on the tomb "he" (read: actual archaeologists who work for him) had just found.
Such a fun read! I loved every page of it. Who doesn't love a feisty heroine and a good murder mystery that will keep you on the edge of your seat guessing until the very end?

It’s official—I adore Amelia Peabody-Emerson!
Modern feminist sensibilities injected into a Victorian heroine.
She loves her husband and her son, but she needs some mental stimulation and some physical labour to keep her occupied.I loved that Radcliffe and Amelia have nicknamed their precocious son Ramses after the demanding and flamboyant Pharaoh.
He takes after both of his parents, needless to say, in his intelligence and his firm opinions!
What could possibly be better than returning to Egypt to explore a newly discovered tomb with her beloved husband?
Amelia brandishes her parasol with abandon and barges her way to a solution with panache!
Warning: this review will involve spoilers for those who haven't read the previous book!Five years have supposedly passed since the events of the series opener, Crocodile on the Sandbank.
By the close of the first book, she and Radcliffe Emerson were married (so strictly speaking, she's now Amelia Emerson, but he still calls her "Peabody" as a nickname), and expecting their first child.
And not all the mysteries he and Amelia will need to unravel are those of the ancient past!Unlike the one in the first book, the mystery here definitely involves murder.
This detective, Egyptologist, and mother of one narrates with wit and humor, puncturing Victorian decorum with her steel-tipped parasol, amazing the reader with her (sometimes stupid) bravery and her unique way of both adoring and defying her Egyptologist husband.""Elizabeth Peters is Agatha Christie in an ancient Egyptian wig and headdress.
Same train travel, same cast of startlingly unlikable characters (the kind where you want each of them to be the villain), same tea tables and crumpets (yes, tea, even in during an Egyptian heatwave), same twists and side alleys."Above all, I love the way Peters writes.
She develops an interest in archaeology, and marries an Egyptologist who is supposed, I think, to be stirringly alpha male but who is in fact emotionally and physically abusive.
All this would have been irritating enough, but Peters caps it all off with godawful Orientalising tropes and an Irish character so overwhelmingly stereotypical (a redheaded freckled Irishman called O'Donnell who frequently says "top o' the morning" and "begorrah" and is compared to a leprechaun) that I'm surprised I didn't develop a facial tic while reading.
On this listen of this old favourite I was truly appreciative of Peters' skill as an author.
The book is told as if it were Amelia Peabody's journal, but still Peters manages very cleverly to give us several views of all the wild twists and turns in the story.
We aren't limited to Amelia's viewpoint because although she is a keen observer she isn't very self aware, and though she is very intelligent she often draws the wrong conclusions.
In this book Emerson is invited to take over a supposedly cursed archeological dig, and Amelia sets about discovering who is behind the sabotage & murders.
Reviewed for THC ReviewsThe Curse of the Pharaohs was another fun installment in the Amelia Peabody mystery/adventure series.
Amelia and Emerson are just a really fun and entertaining couple to read about.Individually, Emerson and Amelia each has a very strong personality that has certain elements which can be a little off-putting, but at the same time rather endearing.
Overall, I really like both Emerson and Amelia and think that they are a very well-matched couple.As with Crocodile on the Sandbank, the first book of the series, The Curse of the Pharaohs seemed to take a little time to build momentum.
3 starsEnjoyable listening for a car trip. I prefer how the narrator portrayed Amelia in book 1 as an indomitable and smart female. I also prefer Emerson in book 1. I do have books 3 and 4 in audio - they were on sale. I will listen to them.

I don’t think it was the narration as much as the storyline.
It just didn’t grab me like the first one did.
Ms. Rosenblat does a nice job on the various accents and Ramses as a baby, toddler, etc., and gruff Emerson’s bluster.
I’ll continue with this series, as I love Amelia.
Fun in the sun with Amelia and Emerson as death comes on swift wings to Victorian archaeologists. When I was young I thought archaeology would be like this. It's not. Archaeology is sitting in a muddy field, in the rain, drawing stones. The book is good fun, the plot trots along nicely with big nods to Sherlock Holmes, Madame Blavatsky, and the opening of King Tut's tomb. Thankfully the author refrained from saying 'wonderful things', but I'm sure she's just saving it for a future episode. Pretty sure I'll read the next one.
I enjoyed the story in this second book much more than the first. I loved Amelia performing a flying tackle to save her husband from getting hurt. I laughed so many times at how she describes and talks about people. I will definitely keep listening to this series.

As usual, Amelia lives beyond her times and has adventures that other Victorian ladies would shudder from. She wields a gun and a parasol like a true explorer and is not afraid to meet a suspected murderer in the middle of the night. She is now happily married to the equally eccentric Emerson, but the verbal duels never seize between those two. This quote describes their relationship with extreme accuracy: ‘In fact,’ he said, ‘we should call it a draw. You tried to shoot me, I tried to poison you. As I said before, Peabody, we are well matched.’
CURSE IT PEABODY, HOW DARE YOU MAKE FUN OF ME.(favorite marrieds remain favorite marrieds)
On the one hand, it's Amelia and Emerson, and they are brilliant characters, but on the other hand, there was just something about this book that left me a little...
Crocodile was fun and the mystery was engaging and it was a great start to what should be an amazing series.But I felt a little let down by the second book, honestly.
The story was great, and reminiscent of some classic mysteries (OK, mainly just one, which I'll touch on in a bit), but I just wanted a little bit of the sparkle that Amelia had in the first book back, and it seemed that was missing for me.
Archeologist Radcliffe Emerson is enticed to return to the exotic country of 1892 Egypt when Lady Baskerville offers him a job of finishing a tomb excavation in the Valley of the Kings begun by her recently deceased husband, Lord Henry Baskerville.
Amelia Emerson, nee Peabody, is enormously eager for a second adventure in Egypt after her son Ramses’ third birthday and the somewhat dull English domestic bliss of recent years.
As in the previous novel Crocodile on the Sandbank, the first in this amusing cozy series, Amelia jumps at the chance to exchange the safety of English life for the chance of an Egyptian expedition.Horrors!
Naturally Emerson demurs - he can't leave Amelia or their beloved three-year-old holy terror Ramses - or can he?
Emerson and Amelia are both bored with Victorian gentry life and miss the thrill of their work in the Middle East.
Amelia is determined to solve the mystery and prove herself to Emerson.
There's less complicated facts thrown out at the reader because most of us are familiar with King Tut. Emerson and Amelia don't find him all that important or interesting in the grand scheme of things but their work is important in understanding and preserving Egyptian history so they persist.
4.5 stars
Every few months I crave a good mystery- not a bold and modern thriller, something clever but relatively gore-less and blushless- so I don't understand how I've wandered through libraries all these years without meeting Elizabeth Peters and Amelia Peabody.Elizabeth Peters is Agatha Christie in an ancient Egyptian wig and headdress.
Supposedly, she said that if you want to read about Egyptian scenery and customs, read a travel book.
There are nineteen Amelia Peabody books in all and I will sleuth them out.
I originally rated this book 3.5 stars but after reading the 3rd in the series, I decided I should rated this one higher!
I enjoy these books so much - I pretty much bookmarked half the book - that I should reflect that in my rating.The Curse of the Pharaohs is set 5 years after Amelia & Emerson's marriage.
You would think that Amelia, with her controlling tendencies, would have issues with Emerson's quirks, but farther from the truth!
Some funny quotes:Emerson saw no reason why anything, up to and including death, should excuse a man for poor scholarship.Let me congratulate you, Professor.
Fast paced, fun loving, Egyptian mystery!Amelia Peabody is at it again!
The Emerson's just want a quiet digging season, but with a curse, missing persons and possibly a murder, it is anything but.
Add in a damsel in distress, and a woman who thinks she is Egyptian royalty reincarnate, and it makes for one digging season for the books..
These delightful mysteries will leave you wanting more and hooked from the first page to the last!
I love these mysteries but of course reading about anything Egyptian is fascinating!
Amelia and Emerson have been married for a several years now and are the parents of a young son.
However, they are both going a little stir crazy after having given up their expeditions in favor of being hands on parents.
They place their son in the capable hands of their relatives and go on another adventure.Emerson is a riot.
The chemistry between him and Amelia is charming, despite Emerson's gruff manner.
The cast of characters were also unique and the in depth descriptions of Egypt, which the author obviously has experienced first hand, puts the reader right there along with the characters in the story.
New parents Amelia Peabody and Radcliffe Emerson are jonesing to get back to Egypt after being away four years raising Ramses.
Neither Amelia nor Emerson believe in the supernatural so the various happenings and the mysterious murders, don't scare them off as intended.
This is another tale of murder and mayhem in the Valley of the Kings where the Father of Curses (Emerson) once again takes control of a crazy situation and shows the natives how it's done.I love the interplay between Amelia and Emerson.
The great love they have for each other is well hidden in the sarcasm and cleverly done fighting.
3,5*
Excellent both in mystery and archaeology.
Amelia cracks me up bc of how she expresses her thoughts ; and how she deals with people.
I definitely want to read this whole series.
Some of the characters she was forced to be in contact with and how she reacted to them was really amusing.
If she wants something to be done, & there is a will in her mind; it will be done.
I also love the wording the author uses and how it is Amelia narrates and talks straight to the reader.
She is on my hero list.
I <3 Amelia.
I fell in love with Amelia Peabody within the first two sentences and did not alter my opinion throughout the entire book.
Granted, the mystery did not come together as satisfactorily as my beloved Agatha Christie's, and indeed there were one or two moments when Ms Peters did not play quite fairly with the reader, but it was nevertheless an immensely enjoyable read.
So much so that I immediately purchased book 1, which happens to be just 99p on Amazon Kindle at the moment.
Of course, I will inevitably have to purchase the rest of the series at around £8 each, but for now I'm congratulating myself on having made a great saving.
Ultimately, a young widow of a fellow explorer offers them a chance they cannot resist, and Amelia and Emerson find themselves back in Egypt.I enjoyed the first book in the series, but if the successive books in this set of mysteries goes on in this way, I have no interest in continuing.
It's more or less a cottage mystery, set in Egypt.
The first book was enjoyable and Emerson did not grate on me as much, since it was the introduction of a character and so one could give him some room for levity.
