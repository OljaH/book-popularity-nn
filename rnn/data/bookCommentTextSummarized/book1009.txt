This is A Bailey's 10th book but is recommended as the second to be read probably because like book 9 is quite short.Unlike book 9 a lot of the book is essentially wasted space.
Who really cares how the Solar Angel may develop or our solar system or the planets in it?
There are a few gems of informastion but for the most part much of the material is purely for interest rather than something that may help someone develop themselves further.
My first AAB book that I read back in the early 1980s. Outstanding in every respect.
How devoted I was to these teachings in my youth! And how they then de-personalised and de-humanised me ...But Meditations on the Tarot saved my soul http://corjesusacratissimum.org/2009/...
