“A Christian who does not pray is like a man who neither thinks nor wills—a mere animal in the spiritual life.” ~Preface, page 11Published during the height of World War II and written by a monk of the Cistercian Abbey of Mount St. Joseph, Roscrea, this book is as relevant and accessible as anything I’ve read on the spiritual life.
Although Difficulties in Mental Prayer was—technically speaking—written for those living the religious life in the Roman Catholic sense of the word, the author, Father Eugene Boylan’s deep love of our Lord is such that anyone who desires to grow closer to Him can through a reflective reading and careful application of the recommendations in this book.
This is the most beautiful and helpful book about prayer as a love relationship. Highly recommended for all, even though written for priests and vowed religious. The only thing that I had trouble with was a very high Mariology expressed in one of the later chapters (said this United Methodist pastor).
Great advice
Included in the "Spiritual Reading" section of Fr. John McCloskey's 100-book Catholic Lifetime Reading Plan. Recommended by friend of Nathan.
