But in thinking about it later, I realized that the heroine had a great deal of Fanny Price in her--emotionally abused, sensitive to beauty and to grace.
And beauty.Here's one passage about dance:But it was class that made Harriet into a dancer.
Class, that unfailing daily torture to which dancers come on every morning of their lives.
Class for the prima ballerina assoluta as for the youngest member of the corps.It was in class that Harriet saw what it cost Lubotsky, the aging character dancer, to get his muscles to warm up--yet saw too the marvelous authority he still carried.
Here's a checklist for you:1. do you like ballet?2. do you enjoy romantic semi-tragedies?3. would you travel to the Amazon to escape from over-bearing and protecting family members?4. would you defy everything you've been brought up to believe for something you think is right?If you say yes to at least to of these, then this book is definetly one you will read again and again!
At eighteen years of age, Harriet Jane Morton lived in the attic of her father's depressive house.
He planned to marry the quiet, intelligent Harriet and place her in a house at the edge of town.
With all her heartache Harriet still managed to find love through the art of ballet.
Harriet and Rom were destined to be soulmates.The only reason I gave this adult fairy tale four stars was because of (view spoiler)[several instances with a lack of communication between the MCs. I understood why the author did this but I needed the whimsical smoothness found earlier on, even amidst all the family drama.
I love the way that even in the first short line of the book, Eva Ibbotson manages to suggest both unseen lecturing voices and Harriet's reluctance acquiesence - There was no lovelier view in England, Harriet knew this.
Although it's clear Rom & Harriet are lovers, Ibbotson doesn't need to show them in bed in detail - their physical and emotional delight in each other is evident in every line.He pulled her down so that she lay against his shoulder.
Later.” By the time trouble comes, in the forms of Edward Finch-Dutton and Rom's manipulative sister-in-law, I've completely bought into the perfection of their love.
Her books have been recently marketed as YA but like the last one, this is really a clean historical romance with a really great heroine (nice, loving, smart, hard worker) who is NOT a beauty but still shines because of her personality.
Add to that the great setting (a ballet company touring Brazil in the 1910s), an interesting hero and an amazing cast of secondary characters and you get another gem by Ibbotson.The ballet company was an integral part of the story so a lot of the action revolves around rehearsals, the dances, etc.
I love Eva Ibbotson's writing.
After that chapter or so I lost all the respect I had carefully built up for Harriet.
She lost the one and only thing that made me respect her: her innocence.
The girl who did those things wasn't Harriet anymore.
I almost gave this book three stars because Ms. Ibbotson IS an excellent writer and the unsullied scenes are brilliantly written and truly funny, but, as Harriet clearly delighted to say, she was a ruined woman and her ruination absolutely ruined the book.
I cannot condone what she did, even though her story (other than a few parts) was delightful.
You guys, this was so enjoyable! A girl in 1912 escapes from her extremely oppressive home and runs away to Brazil with a ballet troupe. I can't imagine you're not already sold just from that description, but may I also mention the dashing hero, the amusing tricks played on the hideous unwanted fiance, the charmingly insane prima ballerina, and the astonishing series of ridiculous coincidences that drive the plot along.You're welcome.
The plot was rather predictable, the love story (and the two characters it concerned) cloying to my inner cynic, and the other characters weren't particularly memorable but still interesting to read about.
Also, I would just like to say, there was not enough communication going on in the story.
What a crazy idea, I know.
If only Romeo had had such common sense, indeed...One more thing, I would have liked more about dancing since that is basically the reason I read this book.
The descriptions of dance that were there were beautifully evocative and had my brain involuntarily humming Tchaikovsky.
By far the worst Ibbotson book I've read to date.
I'm starting to notice a theme in her books- young, not traditionally attractive girl who is involved in some kind of performing art company catches the attention on an older, tall, dark, and handsome, brooding rich man.
I couldn't connect to any of the characters very much, and while I initially kind of pitied Harriet, she was so silly and pathetic to the point that it started to be annoying.All that would usually be tolerable, but what really made me dislike the book was all the unnecessary sex in the book as well.
Anyway, my biggest issue with this book was the message I got from it. It practically said, "Life is sad and dull unless you're rebellious. Oh, and always remember, happiness comes from boys.That's just my feelings, of course. I felt like her life began to revolve around the guy, and she was a bit obsessive. So, yeah, I never really finished this book, just skimmed through - I'm pretty sure it will stay on the never-finished shelf forever.
This is such a heart-warming book, I really really enjoyed it. It's definitely kind of tropy but also makes fun of those tropes at the same time. Eva Ibbotson is such a wonderful writer! This book has a lot of whimsy and is just so FUN and yet moving at the same time. Definitely recommend it if you love books about ballet and/or tragic/cute romance ;)
When a talent scout offers her the chance to join a touring ballet company on its way to Brazil, Harriet can't sit back and watch life pass her by once more.
Escaping from her father, her insect-obsessed intended, and England in general, she sails to the Amazon and into another life.In Manaus, Harriet finds friendship, hard work, inspiration, and Rom--the mysterious and wealthy expat who owns the Teatro Amazonas where the company performs.
A sweet, fun, charming read.
The love story is wonderful, and I like that while it's certainly a main part of the book, Harriet's dancing - and for that matter, Rom's business affairs - are important as well.My only issue with the book (and not a large one, clearly, given the 5 rating) is that at the end, as with so many other books, the heroine needs the hero to rescue her.
Rather than have him literally carry her frail little body out of the attic her overly strict father locked her in, wouldn't it have been far more fun if she had climbed out the window one night, so that he did, in fact, find her with the dance group in St. Petersburg?Ah, well.
I couldn't agree with the morals in the books. I know that a lot of people think that's a stupid reason to hate a book, but it's true. I gave it away (I hate to throw out books) because I couldn't stand it. Certainly clever, and very intriguing, a strong heroine...but I just didn't agree. At all. It was well written though, with some very loveable characters. I just...couldn't get passed the moral thing. I found it in the YA section at my local bookstore...umm I don't think that it's really appropriate for my age group. It's more Adult.
There were all Ibbotson's characteristic elements, which I like in her novels:--> a nice, pure, good heroine (good like in fairy-tales), but Ruth from The Morning Gift had more life, was better created;--> the Hero, a bit brooding, moody and with a big heart, but I loved more Marek from A Song for Summer;--> a charming world which doesn't exist any more, (mostly) Russian ballerinas just before the IWW somewhere in Brazil, but I was much more interested in Vienna world from The Morning Gift (here my review);--> this sorrow and longing for a changing world, this struggle with consequences of decisions of other people, but I was much more moved reading A Song for Summer and The Morning Gift;--> her love for nature;--> her love for classic music;--> this mix of almost magic love story (like in fairy-tales) with brutal real world.All these and other 'but's' decided about my rating.

A Company of Swans  is official my second favorite Eva Ibbotson book, and it is a close second indeed. Harriet leads a dismal life in Cambridge with her professor father and miserly aunt. Her only solace is ballet class. Inexplicably the director of a ballet company finds himself offering her a position in his company for a tour to the Amazon. Harriet is lacking in training, but she has something special, and he knows it. Of course, she's not allowed to go, but after a visit with young Henry, t

The time period (1912) is one of my favorites.
I loved this book.
I loved Harriet.
I loved Rom. I loved that I decided to take this book to Mexico.
(Not exactly the Amazon, but tropical nonetheless.
Well, I would have liked it so much better if Ibbotson could write one book that portrayed love with anything approaching a true understanding of it. In all her "adult" novels anyone in love inevitably has premarital relations, this being the only way that people truly in love can express themselves, of course. It frustrates me to no end, given that I like her characters and wish they could act in a dignified manner. It is the one thing that always keeps me from really being able to recommend these books to others.
How anyone can give this one star is just...beyond me. Lyrical writing, a wonderful heroine (a drip? Seriously? A DRIP? No. So brave. You put yourself in her situation and see how brave YOU are.) A terrific, sexy hero. Sure, there's a Big Misunderstanding. Not my favorite part, but I don't care. An old-fashioned, sweeping romance, a terrific sense of place, a book I've read again and again. Love it.
No, Harriet is to be married to the ever respectable and fairly dull Edward Finch-Dutton as soon as the time is right.
Her actions are plotted and ignored throughout the book and suddenly she is with Rom (how did she get there?), swooning in his arms (why did he catch her?), and somehow provided for a convenient and quick escape for Harriet (how did she know...?
Three times....four...Why did he feel the need to confess to Harriet about his former life after he figures out she knows his nephew?
You know what makes a better book with a less traumatic ending for everyone involved?
If you look past the age gap, this is quite a sweet story.
Look, this wasn't the best book I've ever read.
It's fairly bland a lot of the time, and I wasn't a huge fan of the love interest.
But it also doesn't deserve the number of one star reviews it has, most of which seem to be because Stephenie Meyer mentioned at some point that she likes this book and a whole lot of her LDS fans read it and didn't agree with the premarital sex.
So Ibbotson obviously has the potential to be quite a good writer, at least in the YA romantic historical sub-genre, along the lines of Robyn McKinley, Anne Rinaldi, or Elizabeth Marie Pope.
I was convinced Harriet was making a good match, before I got a detailed account of Rom's sexual conquests (which was also included).
Ibbotson also makes a big faux-pas with the sexual tension by having the hero and heroine sleep together as soon as they get substantial time alone together.
This section is insufficiently motivated, poorly developed, and feels like a complete rabbit trail from the main plot.
Have you ever read the perfect book at the perfect time?
And there's no way they could have known that Dubrov, a Russian ballet master, would scout Harriet's class for potential corps ballerinas for his company, which will soon be leaving for a tour in the Amazon.
But Harriet and Rom also shined.
(did I just say that?) I'm utterly thrilled that there are a handful more similar books by this author yet to be read.
The year is 1912 and though Harriet is the daughter of a widowed professor in England and is intelligent and sweet, her ballet lessons are about the most "exotic" or exciting thing she has ever been allowed to do in her young life.
Ibbotson creates vivid characters and settings; I really felt like I was in Manaus, and I thought she captured quite well the personalities and actions of the ballet company.
I am not quite sure if Ibbotson and I just have a different worldview or if she was just not that good at plotting and resorted to some rather weak moments for her characters in order to move things along.
The romance was as cute as I had come to expect, but it was also a much more passionate romance than I would have expected.This book takes us on a journey, along with Harriet, as she leaves her sheltered life in London to join a touring ballet company as they travel the Amazon.
He also reminded me a little of Guy from Magic Flutes, in that he can be rather sweet but also has a habit of being a bit of a douche at times too, and unfairly shouting at Harriet.
But, even without all that, it remains that, I really liked Harriet.
I liked that she was Good.
Just because she is so aware and in love with people and the world around her.The 'unfortunate' circumstances in her life were portrayed in such a way that you could laugh and shake your head and the absolute ridiculousness that can come from those who think too much of themselves and their own rules, rather than feel heartsick and depressed.And the romance was great.
But the romance, the part where love makes you better and more, was great.
We were told - quite forcibly - that she was GOOD, and intelligent, and disciplined, and all that jazz, but what we saw ...
she was a drip.The romantic lead, as so often happened in romances written in that particular day and age (1980s), fell in love with her instantly, and then just as promptly decided that she needed protecting and sheltering.
So, despite falling in love with her goodness and intelligence, he felt it entirely necessary to treat her as a helpless little child.
I could have really loved this book were not the two main characters so utterly boring.
I was astonished by this book because I don't think I've ever actually read anything like it, where the heroine really does wait around passively until a man saves her.
Luckily the man saves her from some implausibly wacky scenarios (kidnap, moral dissolution, falling into piranha-infested waters after balancing delicately on a leaf) so the book is pretty fun.
The scene-setting in the Amazon and the portrayal of the ballet company are the best parts of the book.
There is also an elaborate sub-plot involving jumping out of a cake.But, angelic Harriet is packed with so much wish-fulfillment it embarrassed me to read it.
I really like this author's books for slightly younger readers so I was excited to read this young adult romance.
It's an exciting and tender story with some very admirable characters and some very laughable ones.
My only criticism is that the book glorifies premarital intimacy.
The main character, in every other respect a very moral, sweet, good role model of a girl, wakes up in her lovers arms rejoicing that she was now "ruined".
It's a great read in every other respect, but I'm not sure I can wholeheartedly recommend it.
Ok, I don't know if I can justly review this because I didn't finish it. But here's my bit: The story was great. I loved it. Tons of Ballet and fun and love and mysterious attractive people. Wonderful! Everyone loves the main character because she is so good and nice and innocent and kind. And then.... BANG! She leaves all her goodness behind and revels in being immoral. I mean, it's not gratuitous or anything, it's simply that Ibbotson completely changes the character and then the character loves the fact that she's being immoral.
