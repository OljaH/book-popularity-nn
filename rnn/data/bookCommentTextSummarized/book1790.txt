It's obvious that H.G. Wells was influenced by Charles Darwin, but he doesn't have any idea about technology, internet, robots...! After all I enjoyed reading this book in one day.
The Time MachineH.G. WellsThe Time Machine by H.G. Wells tells of the Time Travelers story.
The Time Traveler loses his machine and spends a little over a week looking for it, he finds his machine and goes on a trip into the far, far, future.
There are two kinds of humans, the Eloi who live on the surface and are the image of what will happen to mankind once everything has been perfected.
The Time Traveler encounters Weena, one of the Eloi, she follows him around for a while before the Morlocks kill her.
