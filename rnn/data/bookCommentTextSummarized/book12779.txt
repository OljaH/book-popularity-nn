I'm going to talk about all five books because I have just read them head-to-head so to speak.First thing to say is I'm a fan of Eddings, and I don't subscribe to the view that there is anything at all wrong with writing stuff that is entertaining.
You know good will triumph in the end, and that's what you want if you opt to read so-caked soft fantasy.I am also enamoured of Eddings as a writer.
He's good, and immerses you in his world without suffocating you.What I don't like is Polgara, who gets right up my nose -too much uber mother and superiority.
By the time I got to the end of this series, I realised David Eddings wasn't for me anymore.
I visit his bone sometimes." P210 Sorceress of Darshiva Omnibus edition This is clearly false as Belgarath is her mate.
He still runs and hunts - he is also alive so she can't 'visit his bones.'"This one is your mate," the she-wolf said.
P319 Omnibus EditionMoving on from Vella, let’s revisit Zandramas.
Thou wilt find me fair, King of Riva, as all men have, and I will consume thy days with the passion of the gods, and we will share in the meeting of Light and Dark." P444 Omnibus Edition Of course, you almost never see slut shaming without the required consequences.
It's great to re-visit the characters from The Belgariad and see them in action again; unfortunately, that's the best thing that can be said about the series.
However, Eddings fails to move forward with his writing and, instead, gives us what is essentially the same plot from The Belgariad over again.
If you've read The Belgariad and loved it, you should certainly read The Mallorean, as well.
Eddings continues to re-hash the plot from The Belgariad throughout most of the rest of his writing career.
The problem is that he never does it better than he did in The Belgariad, so there's no reason to read anything else.
Reading the sequel series, The Malloreon, was unique experience.
The books were much longer, with more interesting story, and it was interesting and funny read.
: ____________________________________________Overall, this whole universe,  Belgariad, is worth reading once you get past the first five, also very very short, books.
In any case, this series is worth reading.

The final book in the pentology, or so we thought31 August 2012 Well, I have now come to the end of another pointless series of books that does very little to add to the collection of human literature that is pounding our vision these days. A lot of people do seem to have liked these books and I must admit that when I was a teenager I was one of them, but these days I hope that books like these will end up being confined to the dust bin of history and forgotten like the many other books that hav
I like writing fiction, but once again, there is the discipline not only to work on the story until it is completed, but to also structure it in a way that the characters are realistic and the story is consistent.
In a way that I why I like these commentaries because, even though I do not get paid to write them, I am able to write down my thoughts and ideas in a way that allows me to consider new and different things based upon the book on which I am commenting, and I do not need to structure it in the same what that I would a novel.
"It has come at last," Garion's inner companion said unemotionally through the Child of Light's* lips.
Choose, Cyradis, lest all be destroyed.""It has come," another equally unemotional voice spoke through the lips of the Child of Dark*.
Choose, Cyradis, lest all be destroyed."The Seeress of Kell is the fifth and final book in The Malloreon by David Eddings.
Garion must stay resolute to prevent the world from sliding into darkness even if it means he must kill his own son.It is a great ending to the series.
As much as I love the characters and the world that the story is set in I can't help but feel a little short changed with this series.
I understand this was deliberate but I cant help feel that Eddings got a little lazy with ideas but wanted the characters to mature, grow and settle down living happily ever after.All that being said I would still recommend this to people that loved the first series.
But if you only liked the Belgariad I would maybe steer clear of this later series as I feel you may just get annoyed.
I REALLY loved the Belgariad series, and I so looked forward to this follow up series.
I had hoped it would be similar but with new story lines, and adventures.Instead it was a bad rehash of the same story, but with the extra addition of some pretty ludicrous twists, that caused enough discontinuity with the original series, as to make it hardly worth reading.You always hear about series that were continued in the blind search to squeeze more money out of fans of the original, and usually I think saying that is unfair.
This is my review of both the Belgariad and the Malloreon.
I read both through because I'm a sucker for a series about a long quest.
He goes to needless lengths to make sure all his female characters - even the "strong" ones - are shown to be weak and "feminine" at least once or twice.
And don't get me started on his description of non-white ethnicities.
The white male characters are also fairly one-dimensional however, so with that balance, it was a fun though rather mindless swashbuckling romp through a strange little universe with an awful lot of gods and rules.

What a fantastic ending to a great series.
The plot of the entire series comes to a head with shocking clarity.
The way that all of the different parts of the story are wrapped up was rewarding.
At the same time, the forward progression of the tale and the intricate world building never ceases.
Each individual has captured a piece of my heart throughout the series yet they still managed to shine in unexpected ways throughout this novel.
The ending of this novel was a bittersweet moment.
It was a brilliant journey but I’m sad to see it end.
DONNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNE. This series is RIDICULOUSLY misogynist, so don't let your kids read it until they've read The Order of Oddfish first, or maybe The Hunger Games - something where it's a chick kicking solid ass from start to finish. I'm basically exhausted from being so infuriated, so I might need to reread Anathem or Melusine again, as a palate cleanser.
El mejor de la saga y con diferencia. Qué pena me ha dado terminarla. Como ya dije estos personajes se van a quedar siempre en mi corazón. No será la mejor saga, no brilla el trasfondo psicológico de los personajes, y en algunos casos la trama es muy previsible. Aún así esta saga tiene un algo especial se la recomiendo a todo el mundo.
At the same time, it has a "historical" value, as did the author's previous series as a bridge to later works of the genre that he has clearly influenced.
For these reasons I come to the end with very good impressions.Στο πέμπτο και τελευταίο βιβλίο της σειράς δεν συναντάμε ιδιαίτερες εκπλήξεις σε σχέση με αυτά που περιμένουμε σε αυτό το είδος.
Το βιβλίο ξεκινάει με τον ίδιο τρόπο που τελείωσε το προηγούμενο με τους ήρωες μας να περιπλανώνται στην εμπόλεμη ζώνη ψάχνοντας να βρουν τον τόπο της τελικής αναμέτρησης.
Στο τρίτο μέρος φτάνουμε επιτέλους στην τελική αναμέτρηση η οποία είναι όπως πρέπει να είναι σε ένα έργο επικής φαντασίας.
I have fond memories of the BELGARIAD and the MALLOREON and think they are part of the golden age of fantasy, where heroes are good, villains are pure evil and there is a happy ending for those on the side of right.The MALLOREON series was good.
I got to see the characters I love on another quest and get to know them better, and that’s why I re-visted this series.
Although THE MALLOREON is not my favorite series out of David Eddings' collection, it was still an enjoyable read/listen.
And so it ends, another re-read of this splendid series of books.
I will revisit them in another three or four years and once more journey with Garion and his friends on their various adventures.Everyone is familiar with the concept of comfort foods.
Eddings ends this story, which began with Pawn of Prophecy and spans many years, with such grace that it is a joy to read and re-read.These books, the story within and the characters are like old friends.
Though I won’t pick them up again for several years, they are always but a memory away.
I consumed the two five-book series in a few months, getting in trouble in school for reading when I should have been paying attention (I either didn't care or had already done the homework for whatever it was they were teaching while they were teaching how to do it).When complete, I read the whole series again in half the time.
A fun conclusion to a series that I've read over and over again.
All well and good.
The problem is this: at no point, anywhere in the entire series, has the Dark shown any proof that it was the right choice.
At no point does Cyradis act like she has any inclination to choose the dark.
At no point are we convinced that she will choose the dark.
The entire "choice" seems so fabricated and pointless.
(hide spoiler)]Other than that, however, this is an enjoyable book, and it does a good job wrapping everything up.
I'd recommend the series entire.
Reading this series has opened me up to a whole new thinking of fantasy, I liked it before hand but not now I just love reading it!
A lot happens in this book and none of it is boring.
You will be gripped when reading this book and will both want to continue reading and not read it at the same time.
I found myself struggling between needing to know what would happen and not wanting to finish it too quickly.
When I did finish, I felt very empty, I hadn't realised how much I loved both the Malleorean or Balgariad until that moment!
This is the fifth and final in the Malloreon series and finds all the separate threads being brought together in an intense and epic finale that is worthy of the series as a whole.
Every character faces their own challenges with Garion is deceived into wasting precious time following red herrings set by Naradas and Cyradis having to face the choice between Light and Dark without the aid of her trusted Toth, risking everything in the process.
A tried and tested series that adds nothing but good things to the world.
A very satisfying if somewhat predictable ending to this mammoth double epic. I particularly liked the fact that we aren't left wondering what happened to all the characters but are treated to a couple of chapters tying up loose ends and giving us an overview of how their lives continue on, after the final cataclysmic episode.
This series became a proper slog towards the end, with plotholes you could drive a bus through and a repetitive nature with the first series that was hand-waved away airily by the authors through some tenuous discussions between their characters. Glad I'm done, to be honest. Nostalgia is the only thing not reducing this to a two star read.
Beş kitaplık serinin sonuncusu. Kitabın sonunu tahmin etmektense bolca iyi işlenmiş karakterlerin ne yapacağını sonrasında neler olacağını merak ediyorsunuz. Gayet güzel bir son.
There is one part of this book that has made me cry each time I read it. Not going to spoil the surprise.
It was settled 2000 years ago by some Mimbrate Arends who got blown off course & their fierce warlike nature means no one has really tried to take control of the island by force.
Zandramas' henchman Naradas tries his best to keep them there & from learning the true location of Korim where the final, final, we really mean it this time, contest between the two prophecies will happen, for good.
In Belgarath, it's him that knows Old Angarak and he has to teach Beldin enough to spot copies of some book or other.
But in Seeress it's Beldin that knows Old Angarak best and Belgarath who struggles with it.
It was often very philosophical and at times a bit too wordy but at the end you cant help but grin as these characters you have come to love over the previous ten books get their happily ever after.
All in all a fantastic series and even after three readings I love them still.
A final word of warning to first time readers though, be wary of the prequels to this series (Belgarath the Sorcerer and Polgara the sorceress) as they do little to add to this story.
La verdad que al leerlos no supe si había algo antes o después de estos dos libros, me imaginé que sí pero la verdad que la historia es bastante clara si uno no sabe que es parte de una saga y lee las historias por separado.
La continuación de la saga es otra pentalogía, Las crónicas de Mallorea, que incluye: Los guardianes del oeste, El rey de los murgos, El señor de los demonios, La hechicera de Darshiva y La vidente de Kell.
La saga cuenta las aventuras de Garion, Polgara, Belgarath y sus compañeros."Son libros difíciles de conseguir completos (o sea todos los tomos) pero fáciles de conseguir por separado.
Three books would have been perfect rather than five, because ultimately the series is virtually the same as the Belgariad, but with the added bonus of trying to rescue Garion's son and the drawback that half the characters that you loved in the first series barely feature.What I liked most about this last book is that the meeting between the Children of Light and Dark wraps up fairly quickly, leaving ample time to find out what happens to everyone afterwards.
Little boys get dirty just sleeping, women disapprove of drinking, love bathing and get emotional at romance etc, etc.
After journeying through Mallorea, Garion and his companions end up posing as knights, kidnapping Zaketh and finding a long lost relative.
Finally, they end up at the Place Which Is No More and Garion, Zandramas and Cyradris have to make their choices, decisions that will change the universe forever.As usual, a great, fast paced story, with a good sense of humour and excellent characters.
I've been living with these characters for a long time so it was nice to see them all happy and settled!
