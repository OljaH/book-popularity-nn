Alas, any possibility of moral upheaval and emotional effect were softened and made sweet and cute and very easily palatable, which I thought was a real missed opportunity.It's overall a feel-good book, probably unlikely to cause deep discussions between children and their parents, probably unlikely to change any kid's perception of the world, probably a lovely read on the cold rainy day when kids have to stay inside (however, I'm probably thinking of those long-away days of my own childhood when there were no video games and TV programs were quite limited, and library books were the perfect go-to entertainment).

Lucian and Arianna are supposed to be in their mid teens, but I thought they were nine based on how they conversed.P.O.V switches every couple of pages, sometimes three times in one spread, to characters I had forgotten existed and who held no real ground in the story at all.
I don't understand why Hoffman created a parallel world and didn't just use Renascence Italy for Lucian's escape.
There is a scene in which Lucian goes to the real modern day Italy and alludes to the differences between Bellazza and Venice, which I couldn't see.

This year I'm doing a Reading Challenge; so I have 26 books with specific subjects that I need to read.Book 24: A book set somewhere you really want to visitIt's been long since a dream for me to visit Venice.
I especially appreciated the part where Lucien visit the real Venice and points out the differences between this world and the parallel of Talia's Bellezza.This is one of those "guilty pleasure" reads.
I'm re-reading all of the books in the Stravaganza series by Mary Hoffman in accordance to the release of the newest sequel, "City of Sercrets".
This is, as I recall, the best book in the series as of yet.
I cry every time I read this, which is pitiful because it is written for 12-year-olds, but also not pitiful because you love the characters so much it doesn't even matter!
Charming and quick, this book transports you to a past that is almost absolutely better than reality, and entertains your imagination with lush description and with a plot as complex as the city of Bellezza itself.
I think it's related to my love for both history and traveling, so you really can't blame me for the major excitement I had prior to reading this book.
One day, his father gave him a rather peculiar book, with the instructions to write anything on it.
I wouldn't mind as long as there is good pacing, but man, this was the most disjointed novel I've ever read.
It can have a tragic plot, and maybe even a ridiculous one, but if the writing is splendid, I would ALWAYS give it a chance and read it through.
Summary (view spoiler)[Lucien Mulholland isn’t what you’d call a normal boy.

(view spoiler)[Lucien Mulholland isn’t what you’d call a normal boy.
For after being given a red and purple marbled notebook by his father as a gift, Lucien falls asleep only to dream of the floating city of Bellezza, where his adventures begin.Arianna may be the daughter of all Torrone, but her dreams lie in the beautiful city of Belleza.
In fact, despite the multiple viewpoints that the book is written from, Lucien is the reader’s window to the world.Now if the adventure or beauty isn’t enough to peak your interest, there is a tangled web of love and betrayal that weaves its way throughout the story.
In modern-day London, Lucien Mulholland undergoes chemotherapy treatments due to the cancer plaguing his body, but when he falls asleep clutching a mysterious book his father has given him, he is transported, or "stravagated," to an enchanting 16th-century Venice-like city called Bellezza, in the country Talia.Lucien can return only if he can get hold of the book again while thinking of Belleza.
Bellezza is also where he, renamed as "Luciano," meets lovely 15-year-old Arianna and Rodolfo, who created the book that acts as Lucien's stravagation talisman.
recently re-read this series for the hundredth (or so) time, and once again the story did not fail to draw me in. Original, fascinating, exciting - love it.
The Talia that our main character Lucien Stravagates too is so alive – I felt like I knew its canals, its islands, buildings and peoples.
STRAVAGANZA: CITY OF MASKS is full to the brim of the stuff that good stories are made out of – mystery, intrigue, royals, a hero, dimension hopping, alternate worlds, characters you can fall in love with and ones you want to be best friends with, amazing detail in the world-building and writing that just pulls you in and wrenches every emotion it can out of you.
For all that this is essentially fantasy for kids and teenagers, Hoffman has created a fantastic blend of court intrigue (the Duchessa who helms the water-bound state of Bellezza is a delightfully devious character) and surprisingly affecting family drama (as Lucien lives stricken by cancer in his world, but full of bright, shining promise in the other).
The plot threaded throughout the novel is a little predictable, but the strength of the characters and ideas - not to mention Hoffman's reverent, lovely descriptions of an otherworldly Venice (already the most unbearably beautiful city in our world) - is simply a treat and makes for a great, entertaining read.
This book was a disappointment. The story is childish and unrealistic – in the bad way. The main idea is not very original, the characters don’t read like actual, complex people, the plot is quite predictable. I finished the book, but it was boring, even annoying towards the end.
Like all the others, this is one is beautiful, but I think this one affected me more emotionally than some of the others. I nearly cried several times and I love it just as much now as I did when I first read it about two years and a half years ago.
My eight year old self loved this book and series.
This is every bit my favourite type of story and it was a delight to read.Lucien lives in modern day England but his life is marked by his illness.
Arianna lives in Talia, a parallel universe for want of a better description, which has a feel of 16th century Italy but has its own vivid natural beauty and is populated by a cast of eccentric characters.Lucien unwittingly comes across a talisman which transports him from his world to Arianna’s.
The talisman gives him time without his sickness in Bellezza which is akin to Venice - a great water city surrounded by islands.
So why did it only receive two stars?Because it was boring and extremely predictable to me (and rather too soppy in the end).
Which is what I give two stars for.The problem is that it adhered to basically all the unwritten rules of how YA fantasy fiction works while not having a storyline or characters quite "new"/intriguing enough to cover that up.
This might also explain why I never made it to the other books of Stravaganza, and don't intend to, too.Still, I wouldn't discourage anyone to give it a try - perhaps especially readers who haven't read that much YA fantasy yet or who just can switch off that inner voice making educated spoiler-guesses so readily.
Και πραγματικά η ιστορία της αυτής, δεν είναι απλά υπέροχη και μαγευτική, ιδιαίτερη και ξεχωριστή αλλά, τόσο εξαιρετικά καλογραμμένη και δοσμένη με τόση ρεαλιστικότητα που, ακόμα και ο παράλληλος, φανταστικός κόσμος που η ίδια δημιούργησε, να φαντάζει ακόμα πιο όμορφος, αγαπητός και άξιος να εξερευνηθεί, από την Ιταλία και την Βενετία της, που άσκησαν επιρροή και έμπνευση για την δημιουργία του, χάρη στην αγάπη της Hoffman απέναντί τους.Ο Λυσιέν, βαρύτατα άρρωστος από καρκίνο, χάρη σε ένα μαγικό τέλεσμα που φτάνει τυχαία στα χέρια του, βρίσκεται από τη μια στιγμή στην άλλη, από την ασφάλεια του δωματίου του στην Αγγλία, στην Μπελλέτσα, πόλη της Ταλίας, γερός και υγιής χωρίς ωστόσο να γνωρίζει τι συνέβηκε και πως οδηγήθηκε εκεί.
Kun kasiluokkalainen poika tuli kyselemään tätä kirjastosta ja kertoi lukeneensa sarjan jo kolmesti, uteliaisuus heräsi. En ollut aiemin kiinnittänyt huomiota koko sarjaan, mutta tämähän oli ihan tosi kiva löytö. Tylsä kansi, mutta sisältä löytyy tavallista tusinafantasiaa enemmän. Tragediat ovat suuria mutta kärsimys, toiminta ja juonenkäänteet ovat mielestäni niissä rajoissa, että sarjan lukemisen voi hyvin aloittaa jo vaikka neljäs-viidesluokkalainen fantasian ystävä. Tuuppasin tämän myös jälkikasvun yöpöydälle arvioitavaksi.Ja vaikka kirjapino yöpöydällä on jo pelottavan korkea, niin taidanpa lainata myös sarjanseuraavan osan :)
We first meet her when she's decided to run away from her brothers in order to spend the night after an important festival in the city, then present herself as a candidate to be mandolier (read: gondolier) the next morning.
She has two problems here: only boys can become a mandolier, and only people born on Bellezza can stay in the city the night after the festival.
They meet the following morning, when Lucien accidentally stravgates to Bellezza.Things happen in this book, not necessarily because they make any sense to, but because the later plot will need them to.
Masked delights:Take some teenage fiction and add mystery, masks and a spot of time travel and you get Mary Hoffman’s ‘City of Masks’.
And this novel is no exception.Following Lucien through his adventure is gripping and at the same time quite emotional.
As the reader follows Lucien and learn more about him, the connection Hoffman establishes between him and reader is emotional; you want a happy ending, but at what cost?Mary Hoffman has written a novel with pace and excitement.
This book was an excellent and gripping read with great characters and a new and original story.
There she meets Lucien, a boy from modern times who has travelled to Bellezza using an artifact from a member of the Straveganza time travelers.
The storyline is original and exciting to read and the new fantasy setting similar to Venice is excellently written allowing readers to picture it in their minds.
The pacing is also good throwing in a fairly big surprise that keeps readers interested in reading more books in the series.
A very good read 4 stars
Cerita dari sudut pandang yang banyak dan melompat-lompat dari satu cerita ke cerita lain.
Dan kau baru akan mengetahui sudut pandang siapa sekarang setelah kau membaca beberapa kalimat.Dalam satu cerita biasanya kau akan mendapati satu sudut pandang.
Tapi tidak di buku ini.
Terkadang buku ini memberikan jeda beberapa baris sebagai pengalihan sudut pandang cerita tapi terkadang juga tidak.
Dan semakin ke belakang, sudut pandang siapa yang sedang kau baca semakin tidak jelas.
Dan jangan mengharap kisah romantis dan kekerasan dalam cerita ini.Buku ini akan membawa kita menelusuri kota bayangan, Bellezza yang mirip dengan kota Venesia.
Het thema van tijdreizen en parallelle werelden wordt deze keer uitgewerkt in een glamoureuze Renaissance-setting, wat het boek een elegante charme en een zekere originaliteit verleent.
Vooral in het begin wordt deze betoverende wereld gedetailleerd neergezet, later gaan de gebeurtenissen de hoofdrol spelen.
Dit zijn er zeer veel: het boek wemelt van de intriges.
Vooral de vele scenewisselingen maken het wel eens lastig de verhaallijn te volgen en alle personages uit elkaar.
Maar doordat de karakters enorm goed zijn neergezet nemen zij je in feite mee in dit boek.
Daardoor blijft het wel goed te volgen.
This hit on some MAJOR pet peeves for me, so even though I saw potential in some respects, I gave up.
I love this series!
Los problemas que supone la stravagación son bastantes, de tal modo que no nos encontramos ante un desafío fácil.
Del mismo modo, el final de la novela es totalmente realista, acorde a los riesgos que corría el protagonista.
Me hubiera gustado que se profundizara más en los personajes.
Del mismo modo, hubiera preferido que la autora desarrollara más la trama amorosa.
A lo largo de la novela hay varios personajes que se emparejan y forman una relación pero apenas se le presta atención a ese proceso de enamoramiento.
Quizá si se le hubieran agregado más páginas enfocadas hacia el romance, todo hubiera sido mejor.
1. To show that one particular character spoke with an accent, all of the words he spoke were in this awful old, stilted, misspelled English.
It RUINED the flow of the story for me.
I recall one of my best English profs in university saying that good writing has no need to misspell words to convey how a person speaks.
Writing misspelled words tells the reader how they should interpret the text while also making it more difficult to read.
2. To keep the story flow and suspense, there were a LOT of perspective changes.
I found it initially difficult to get into because the language is very simple, and jarring after reading more adult novels, but I quickly became accustomed to it.The plot can be predictable at times, but more in a good way, than bad.
Each scene is interesting and adds to the story, and there are different levels of clues that can be found for younger and older readers.I like that Bellezza is based on Venice and a certain family is based on a real life historical counterpart.
The author even goes to the trouble of pinpointing the moment in history that diverged from our own to develop her fictional one.I’ll be keeping this book.
They know of travellers between the worlds called Stravagantes, and they would like to control these people and learn their secrets.The Duchessa wants to protect the Stravagantes, for both political and personal reasons.
There is also no explanation for why the chemical properties of silver and gold are reversed in Talia, or why a goddess-cult persists there a thousand years into the Christian Era. Hoffman explains in her notes that there is no Protestant Reformation in her parallel world, because Mary I, Elizabeth I, and Edward VII were all the children of Henry VIII and Catherine of Aragon (!!!).
OMG it took me a lifetime to read this book 🎉🎉🎉RTC
