The prologue was cray! But I had fun with Fiddler in chapter 1 üòÇ Kalem's laugh rumbled from where he sat at the tiller. "Fiddler and water don't mix, lad. Look at him, he's greener than that damned monkey of yours"A sympathetic snuffling sound breathed against Fiddler's cheek. He pried open one bloodshot eye to find a tiny, wizened face staring at him. "Go away, Moby," Fiddler croaked Then they got chased by a crazy shapeshifting creature that looked like a big centipede!  Fiddler scrambled to t
"Fiddler and water don't mix, lad.
Look at him, he's greener than that damned monkey of yours"A sympathetic snuffling sound breathed against Fiddler's cheek.
He pried open one bloodshot eye to find a tiny, wizened face staring at him.
Fiddler scrambled to the stern, crouching down beside Kalem.
Fiddler shrugged.
üòÇThe one thing I really didn't like about this book is that Rake wasn't in it.
But my all time fav was Fiddler!
There always is in these books.
I love Ralph Lister as the narrator because he can rock a book!!
I did zone out on some things but it's okay, that's what re reads are for!
One of the main reasons behind this is that Deadhouse Gates is considered one of the strongest installment within the series by the fans after Memories of Ice and The Bonehunters.
Now that I‚Äôve read Deadhouse Gates, I finally understand why people insist newcomers on continuing to the second book first.
‚ÄúOh, you didn‚Äôt ask for spoilers?‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôll force it down your throat boy.‚Äù Let me say this, I absolutely don‚Äôt fucking care about your understanding and knowledge on any series if you‚Äôre going to spoil me.
"We are all lone souls. It pays to know humility, lest the delusion of control, of mastery, overwhelms. And, indeed, we seem a species prone to that delusion, again and ever again."  If you have read The Gardens of the Moon you are aware that it was a complex and somewhat perplexing read, that it had a colossal set of characters and that the unraveling the yarn of story threads was a tremendous reward. Deadhouse Gates follows those footsteps and delivers another monumental tale, a tale that wi
Deadhouse Gates follows those footsteps and delivers another monumental tale, a tale that will captivate you right from the beginning and take you on an epic journey you will never forget.The story picks up right after the events of GotM but we are no longer on the continent of Genabackis, our journey in the Malazan world continues in the Seven Cities of the Malazan Empire.The Empire is on the brink of rebellion, hanging in the balance of a long prophesied war, an uprising known as Whirlwind, led by the prophetess Sha'ik from the Holy Desert of Raraku, that will free the Seven Cities of the Malazan usurpers.
I didn't use to be a fan of military plotlines but my absolute favourite arc in this book was that of the Chain of Dogs.
This was told from the POV of Duiker, an ex-soldier now Imperial Historian, who followed Coltaine, war leader of the Wickan clans and newly appointed commander of the Seventh tasked to save the lives of the Malazans from the Seven Cities rebellion.
The named soldier ‚Äì dead, melted wax ‚Äì demands a response among the living..
Strongly recommend this series to everyone!!!*** 5 ***A catch-up buddy read with the Grim-Dark Fantasy Fans @ BB&B!I always write my reviews immediately after I finish reading a book, because I am not a literary reviewer, I am just a book addict who tries to save my overall‚Äã impression of the story right away, while it is fresh in my mind.
I have always thought of the Fantasy Genre as a canvas which gives you the freedom to reflect the best and worst of humanity in a way in which we can separate ourselves from the villains and try to emulate the heroes.
Chapter 24: Before you knock to the Deadhouse Gates, make sure you are ready for what awaits you there.* Chapter 23: Again and again, we cling to the foolish belief that simple solutions exist.Chapter 22: It is not the Empire‚Äôs soldiers the Empress cannot afford to lose, it is its memory.Chapter 21: The roar from Aren's walls had stilled.
The Wickans!Chapter 18: Knock, knock.Who‚Äôs there?Adore.Adore who?Adore to the deadhouse is between us.
All I can give you is a chapter breakdown of my own knocking at the Deadhouse Gates.The Malazan Book of the Fallen:1.
Ugh, I know that Erikson likes to butcher his characters, but what I felt in this book‚Ä¶.Oh my, great characters died :S Erikson‚Äôs skill in creating most of characters and the history to the landscapes his characters must travel, helped a lot to love this book.
Just noticing, sir.'It just the beginning for (view spoiler)[Icarium, Mappo, Heboric and Felisin (hide spoiler)], so I don‚Äôt really mind to wait for my next read in Malazan, I hope the next book will satisfy my need to know more about them and give a great playdate as one of the strongest sides of GotM was the depth of characters and I longed for that in DG.I had some ups and downs with the kids‚Äô issue in DG.
A question like "who's the main character" loses meaning in The Malazan Book of the Fallen series.Because of this, when reading Deadhouse Gates, one might conclude that the story is basically independent of the first book in the series, Gardens of the Moon.
And the task of protecting and evacuating thirty thousand Malazan refugees falls into the hands of the Wickan warlord Coltaine, handpicked by Empress Laseen herself.Deadhouse Gates was in most aspects every bit as good as the first book in the series.
We meet several of the Bridgeburners again, a few intriguing Ascendants are running around manipulating things, and I finally got myself a new favourite character in this series: the ruler of the Malazan Empire herself.I had a few minor issues with this one that didn't impact my opinion of the book as a whole much, but should at least be mentioned.
Buddy read with lovely, Sade.The book opens with ^this^ scene and you know you are in for an interesting ride.
Towards the end of the book, you remember that "living in interesting times" is actually a Chinese curse!After Erikson's causing no deep emotion, a bit on the flat side, not bad but not close to great at all characterisations in the first book, the heroes here were a punch to the stomach.
How can you fall in love with a character who only spoke a handful of times throughout the whole book., whose POV we've never got!
The world's harbingers of death are many and varied. If I have noticed anything about Steven Erikson's writing after reading the first two books in The Malazan Book of the Fallen series, it's that he doesn't do anything halfway. In  Deadhouse Gates  we are transported to a new continent, Seven Cities, and an almost entire new cast of characters. There are a few familiar faces from GotM, but not many. Now why would he do that, after such a great first book with characters we are now familiar wit
Now why would he do that, after such a great first book with characters we are now familiar with and the lovely continent of Genabackis?
As in GotM, there are a lot characters in Deadhouse Gates, and each one is done extremely well.
From my interaction with other fellow Malazan enthusiasts I have been told the characters from GotM and Deadhouse Gates begin to intermingle in the coming books.
Yes, the end of this book broke my heart, but I have faith Mr. Erikson will avenge those who have fallen.
As a veteran of the military myself, there was something in this story of the ‚ÄúChain of Dogs‚Äù that truly tugged at the heartstrings of my very soul, and I cannot begin to tell you how many times while reading about the desperate attempts of the Seventh Army to survive its horrifying trek across Seven Cities that I had to set the book aside for a few moments and simply let the tears roll down my cheeks.
In fact I think this book was an improvement with a darker tone, more distinct, memorable storylines and old and new characters mixed seamlessly together.
Before even starting this series I had heard from friends that Erikson frequently changed the setting and characters from book to book.
From the start of this book Felisin‚Äôs story set a bench mark for being grim and brutal in a way not seen in GoTM.
Some of the best secondary characters I‚Äôve seen so far in this series also appeared in her storyline.
Deadhouse Gates was an enjoyable read that unfortunately did not quite live up to the quality of its predecessor Gardens of the Moon.
The action takes place on a new continent as the focus switches to the Seven Cities rebellion, which was hinted at in the first book.
Another slight downside was that the new characters did not quite live up to the ones who did not feature from the first book.
Dukier and the Chain of Dogs story arc was interesting and tragic, but it was a bit slow paced for my liking, especially in the first half of the book.
World was overall complex and strange (at that point I was unacquainted with China Mieville so my standard for labeling something strange was LOT lower back than) but I seen potential so I kept on.
It didn't take lot of time for that potential to be used as second book blowen me away.
After this book I officially joined Malazan cult and after third book I decided that most other fantasy writers should be sacrificed as blood offering to Steven EriksonStory here is more straightforward (as much that can be said for Erikson) and slower paced.
I was too invested in the characters, especially the Assassin and the Historian.
The thief was fun and the author's penchant and focus on old dead civilizations and archeology serves him extremely well here.
We even got to travel by sea and pirate with the best of them.This novel may as well serve as the definition of Epic.
And I loved every instance where the Coins of the realm became the downfall of (often extremely literally) of nobles and the other financial ministers; I was laughing with delight, even.The deaths of the children were hard, but distance made a lot of it bearable.
My sense, however, is that Erikson prefers to hide information from the reader, and sometimes it feels to me like he's hiding it simply for the sake of hiding it.So why four stars?
If I had understood what it meant that Icarium is a Jhag, I might have gotten more the first time around from the stunning reveal in the Azath house at the end of this book.I no longer think Erikson hides information for the sake of hiding it, or at least not solely for that reason.

This is such an epic story, I figured a typical review couldn't do it justice, so I asked for some help from the characters who always know best.Felisin: "I was told there would be journeys to exotic locations, that I would meet many interesting people, and that I would be admired and even held in awe.
Yes, am I right about that, or do I really have to come over there and demonstrate?"Fiddler: "I don't know, I've got a Ph.D in Astro-Hyperdrive-Mechanics, and my agent sent me this role.
Still- its been a blast!"Kalam: "I want some nano-ceramic body armor next time."Icarium: "I went on a long walk with my most excellent friend Mappo.
Malazan is nothing like other fantasy books, the world is so broad, I now get why they are but few old characters in it, if all of them were in this , it would have been more complex than the first book thereby making it hard to understand, thus the dividing of the books by characters. The seven cities that The Malazan empire conquered was discussed here indepthly, how the people are regarded by Malazans and how they regard the Malazns. 'Children are dying.'Lull nodded. 'That's a succinct summar
The book is written in third person multiple POV.Characters and PlotIcarium is a jaghut, a non human race, he has greenish skin, grey hair and is seven feet tall, jaghut are extremely powerful and very hard to kill, despite this Icarium is neither arrogant nor mean, he is very kind and his friendship with Mappo his friend and companion is so adorable.Mappo Runt is a trell, a nomadic creature, looks more giantish than human, trells are very powerful and are great warriors, just like his friend he is also kind, his loyalty to Icarium is like nothing I‚Äôve ever seen before, its amazing.The two of them are looking for answers to Icarium‚Äôs mysterious past.
the prior novel Gardens of the Moon felt at times as if it were written by a drunk 17-year-old; Deadhouse Gates was written by an experienced and empathetic adult who has grown emotionally and whose skills on the page now equal the exciting imagination he's clearly had all along.Erikson's background as an archaeologist is readily apparent in the book.
loved all of that.- I like how Erikson plays with tone.
Tied with a few other books in this series as the best ever it held its own on a re-read.
You realize the first time through how many Easter eggs Erikson leaves.
The second time around you realize you missed more than you caught.
Erikson doesn't spare his readers the horrors of the world.
Much like his characters you are made to bare witness.
He starts with the land.
What is the spirit of the land?
What lies under the land in past civilizations?
Are their spirits chained to the land?
Perhaps the best book I‚Äôve ever read.
‚ÄúThe lesson of history is that no one learns.‚Äù  It‚Äôs quite a risk, after  Gardens of the Moon,  which was a divisive beginning of the series, to follow that up with a story with a completely new cast of characters on a completely different continent, introducing new setting, while disregarding almost everything known from the previous book. It‚Äôs like starting series twice.Luckily, this second start is with a bang!Let‚Äôs just jump right into it.  Story.   Deadhouse Gates  picks up immediately af
The main difference between them, as their name is suggesting, is that Soletaken shapeshifter can change itself into one creature (view spoiler)[(e.g. When Anomander Rake turns into a dragon) (hide spoiler)], while D‚Äôivers can change themselves into multiple creatures.And the reason why they are in such a hurry is because of the promise that while this convergence is happening, at the end of this Path of Hands, one of them will ascend and become a god of both species and have a control over all of them.This is a story that until the end works as a side story of the book.
(view spoiler)[this will probably not be the case with Bauden at least (view spoiler)[since he is possibly dead (hide spoiler)] but at least there is still some hope for Felisin and Heboric (hide spoiler)]Kalem‚Äôs entire story I liked and his was probably one of the more happy arcs even though it too is riddled with death.
I‚Äôm glad he met a few new people/things during his journey and I‚Äôm hoping we see more of him later in the series too.Sorry/Apsalar was one of my favorite characters in the first book.
Next, the new cast of characters.
He writes his characters extremely well.
His characters is where his writing really shines, right with his extremely vivid battle scenes.The plot was a bit better in this one, too.
The only thing that I can think of that would take away from this book is that it's a whole new plot with quite a few new characters.
I had to read the last 2 or 3 chapters and the Epilogue like 4 times to really wrap my head around what happened, because A LOT happens.
This series is shoving A Song of Ice and Fire off my top fantasy series of all time very quickly.
Your feelings range from joy, when reunions occur.
It can be jarring to the reader to be dumped into a new continent after Gardens of the Moon, however I found this time around that as I expected this to occur that I quickly became immerse with the new set of characters.
It helped that we had Fiddler, Kalam, Apsalar and Crokus continuing on from the first book.Once again Erikson pulls the threads of the various storylines together in a stunning conclusion.
One of the things I struggled with on my first reading was that a lot of the characters I got to know in the first book just don‚Äôt make a showing.
His rescue of the tens of thousands of Malazan refugees and their march across the continent will forever be immortalised as ‚ÄúThe Chain of Dogs.‚Äù The other difference from my initial reading this time is that I had a greater appreciation of the journeys undertaken by the four main story arcs.
Oh this book... It broke my heart too many times! ‚ÄúChildren are dying.‚Äù Lull nodded. That‚Äôs a succinct summary of humankind, I‚Äôd say. Who needs tomes and volumes of history? Children are dying. The injustices of the world hide in those three words. Quote me, Duiker, and your work‚Äôs done.‚Äù Deadhouse Gates is the second tale in the ‚ÄúMalazan Book of the Fallen‚Äù series, and it takes place after the events of the first book ‚Äì Gardens of the Moon. Gardens of the Moon was relatively a tough read for me
Gardens of the Moon was relatively a tough read for me, since it had tons of characters and mainly ‚Äì many unexplained events; Erikson just tosses you in a whole new world and expects you to deal with it ‚Äì figuring things bit by bit and placing them together like a puzzle.
I would say that Deadhouse Gates is the most horrible (in a good way?) and heartbreaking book I‚Äôve ever read in my life.
My favorite subplot is that of The Chain of Dogs, led by the talented commander ‚Äì Coltaine of the Crow clan and told by the Malazan historian ‚Äì Duiker.
That did not happen!Boring synopsis begins (feel free to skip) Deadhouse Gates mostly focuses on Seven City‚Äôs rebellion over The Malazan Empire.
Series like this are great for epic fantasy aficionados with good memories for characters, plots, races, terms and other details (fantasy RPG players too I suppose).
By the time I started Deadhouse Gates I have already forgotten who the (returning) characters are, and most of the world building details (memory like a sieve, sorry); I do remember the awesome ‚Äúwarrens‚Äù magic system, though.
Icarium and Mappo (sorry, don't know who to credit)Apsalar and friends are also great, I like them from the previous book, and their adventures are full of awesome magic.
The characters are better fleshed out.
Whiskeyjack, Anomander Rake, and others in GotM, were more appealing characters but they were more like characters of a play than people of real life.
This book has some people and some scenes with them that get through to you.
A lot of people say this was a longer book than it should have been, but I feel the book would have lost its charm otherwise.
The only let down was that we see a lot less of Ascsndants than I had expected, but there are eight more books left, so fingers crossed.
