This was short and funny.
An entertaining story.
Miss Marple comes to the aid of a young couple who can't find their inheritance due to their Uncle Mathew's distrust of banks and his sense of humor. I loved the solution, but since both the young people had the sense of last year's bird's nest (they were going to inherit, so they didn't have to apply themselves to anything, you see) I wish Miss Marple had kept everything for herself!
Kind of a stretch, "All my eye and Betty Martin". How could he know they would remember his tapping his eye? But ok. I can suspend disbelief for a little bit.
The main problem I had for this story was the plaintive disrespect that the two main characters had for dear old Miss Marple. Again Miss Marple came through, and solved everything for them

I think some of these archaic references just go over my head. I would probably have appreciated these stories if I had read them 50 years ago.
Ah, puns.
A good mysteryThe story about what happened to the Uncle's money is a good mystery. Miss Marple runs true to form with her dithering. Worth more money.

Pretty decent story - my first Miss Marple so I had no past or introduction to her and this story probably isn't what I should start with but it's what I had.If you like Christie then you'll probably want to read this.If you're not a fan then this won't make you a fan.
Strange JestAs usual, Agatha Christie holds the reader's attention all the way through, whether it is a short story or a book. I love all her stories, but Miss Marple is my favorite of all her detectives.
I have always loved Agatha Christie's work. I might just be getting into her books having watched so many of the TV adaptations of her books on TV but I'm not too sure about this short story. I didn't know whether to like it or loath alas the 2 stars.
Another fun Miss Marple mystery about a lost inheritance. This series is great and never disappoints.
One of the stories in teh final case book. Not one of the best
Great short story!
Another great short story seemingly effortlessly told with strong characters and sense of place, humor, and complexity of plot..a delight
An interesting and funny short story. Miss Marple appears to be almost just as eccentric as Poirot. And just as entertaining!
Somewhat entertaining but the payoff was kind of meh.
I'm probably going to anger some people, but I really don't like Joan Hickson's narration. Also, the solution, while it might have been original at the time, reminded me of too many other stories.
