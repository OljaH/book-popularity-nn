We are in 1927, Whitehead is challenging Hume (1776) and Kant (1804) revisiting fundamental concepts around their reasoning frameworks. This is certainly an enormous intellectual effort. How he managed to do this? Being quite clever but also living and UNDERSTANDING the scientific revolution brought by the Relativity Theory (1916). This essay is the effect of his fresh reasoning and he dared to update the very foundations of western philosophy.
Well, this went over my head. Encourages me to explore his writings further though.
Alfred North whitehead is one of my intellectual heros. This book was interesting, but I was hoping for more of Alfred the mathematician to come out. Instead, he wrote like a true philosopher: eloquent, but opaque. Many of his ideas could have benefited from clarification and more examples. Nevertheless, I think his ideas about symbolism and the nature of experience were very illuminating. I definitely found myself sympathizing with his analysis.
i need to read this book for my research
Interesting and significantWhile not Whitehead's best work, his distinction between two modes of perception is groundbreaking and highly significant for anyone interested in aesthetics, art, and culture.
"Universality of truth arises from the universality of relativity, whereby every particular actual thing lays upon the universe the obligation of conforming to it" (p.39).
Highly recommended, in these trying times of blatant propaganda spewage.
