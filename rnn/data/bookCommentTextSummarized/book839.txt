Incredibly useful both for teachers and students of Vergil.
What could be more useful than a book that parses every single word of Aeneid Book 1?
This book helps to tackle that sort of problem and in some cases offers a detailed explanation of different possible ways of translation of the same construction.The book contains the complete verses of Aeneid 1 with literal interlinear translation, a prose translation, and then the full breakdown of every detail of every word on the bottom 2/3 of each page.
Excellent commentary; really good on how Virgil parallels/deviates from Homer, as well as peculiarities of his poetic language.
Vergil took to an entirely new level the Latin language and all of the poetic and rhetorical resources that were available to him.
After Homer, he is the single greatest classical author and only students who are willing to learn the essentials of Latin grammar will be able to appreciate his linguistic magic.This book is a good place to start with Vergil.
I have occasionally lent it to students who are beginning to read him for the first time, and they have all reported to me their happiness with the book.
Not being a fan of long narrative poetry, it took me two years to read this book, but I'm glad I plodded through.
There is plenty of drama: tragic love, murder, intrigue, visits to the creepy underworld, and grand battle scenes, all intertwined with the soap opera that was Greco-Roman mythology.
Everything that occurs is ordained by Fate and often manipulated one way or another by the constantly bickering gods and goddesses, with their grudges and weird love affairs.
A great story, and beautifully composed, but Virgil could have been less long-winded in parts.
