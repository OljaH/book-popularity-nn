A fresh, lively, wonderful read (given the subject matter). I recommend highly. Published in 1894, it predates many profound discoveries and creations of the 20th century, so be advised.One caution: the hard-copy reprint I found had a number of pages missing, and the version I bought from Kindle was terrible with regard to display of formulae. Still, between the two I got by, and am glad I did.
But the worse deficiency is that on the occasions when FC describes some snippet of mathematics, it is inevitably cryptic and with high probability egregiously wrong.
Here just one example:"Such was the problem of the isochronous curve (to find the curve along which a body falls with uniform velocity".It is disappointing but, perhaps, not too surprising that FC's publisher hadn't assigned a mathematically versed editor.
The best part of the book might be his discussion of the earliest historic accomplishments, for instance, the development of different counting systems.
