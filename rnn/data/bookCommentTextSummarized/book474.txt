when you get no answers, hear no voices, than you get answers to something else which can lead you to the right answer. Loved it. but, I am still thinking what the voice of the NewYork city was/is ?

The best stories of O.
Henry comprised 65 short stories, a bit too many to soldier through I found.
Many of the stories are peopled with a returning cast of smalltime swindlers, Caribbean island dwellers, and out of luck poor working class New Yorkers.
This brings cohesion to the collection.Considering the stories were written over a 100 years ago, they are still quite fresh and cheeky, although the twists and jokes that are his signature style can feel a bit like daddy-jokes.
A handful of stories were touching, some were wise.
Henry will stay with me for a while.

The narrator seeks the voice of New York City. "Chicago says unhesitatingly, 'I will.'" I love that.
Good O. Henry short story.
