Dahl sees himself as the BFG giving Sophie, children, a new way to think, different from human adults, who don't even believe in giants.
Look at the original illustrations for the first edition of the book on Bidnessetc In the BFG, one of the giants, the Fleshlumpeater is supposed a black character, certainly another of them likes eating Turkish people.
Two wrongs don’t make a right    WHAT A BOOK IT WAS! What an ending it was! I can't control my emotions. I haven't felt anything like this before. I haven't read a children book like this. I am soo happy by reading this. I am soo in love with the characters. Or writing. Or everything which this book offered me. It took me little long to finish this because of my exams.

OVERVIEWSophie, an orphan, is taken away by a giant named BFG (Big Friendly Giant) as she sees him in the witching hour (a time when everyone is sleeping and giants show up).
BFG is a good giant.
THINGS I LIKED=> BFG.
But I loved how BFG speaks.
=> I liked that giants called human beings: 'Human Beans' hehehe...
I was laughing out loud while reading this chapter.=> BFG called helicopters 'Bellypoppers' hehehe...=> I liked how they captured the giants.
I didn't like the history of giants.
Especially children must read this book.
Don't gobblefunk around with words.  This entire book  was a gobblefunk of words. Snapperwhippers and babblement and crockadowndillies. My inner grumpy adult came out about 1/2 way through the book -  just say what you mean!  Meanings is not important, said the BFG. I cannot be right all the time. Quite often I is left instead of right. Yes, yes you were, Mr. BFG - you went left the entire book.Sophie, a little "human bean," gets up one night and spies from her window, a long spindly shape cre
This entire book  was a gobblefunk of words.
Yes, yes you were, Mr. BFG - you went left the entire book.Sophie, a little "human bean," gets up one night and spies from her window, a long spindly shape creeping around in the dark.
He whisks her away to giant country where she learns that every night, giants steal humans for their dinner and would eat her in a heartbeat.Luckily, Sophie is stolen by the Big Friendly Giant (BFG) who truly is good, and kind, despite his propensity for murdering the English language.
I think that Dahl's idea for the story is a creative one, but little things, such as the puns on the names of countries when the BFG describes the taste of "human beans" in those countries, or what I think were stereotypical remarks at the end of the novel.
However, the story ended as they typically do, especially in "children's" literature, with the "bad" guys getting captured and the "good" guys living happily ever after without the moral ambiguity that Dahl touched upon in that one particular conversation between Sophie and the BFG.
Kidnapped, of a sort, Sophie learns that this giant is even larger than he appeared in the shadows, but nowhere near as frightful.
Sophie also learns that the BFG possesses the ability to instil and inject dreams into the bedtime thoughts of any person, children in particular.
Armed with this information, Sophie has an idea after learning from her new friend of the recent kidnapping number of children across Britain by these foul giants.
With much gibberish found in many of Dahl's pieces, this one is chock-full of offbeat words and giant patois, which will have the younger reader (or listener) giggling as the story continues.
REVIEW TO COMEThis is going to be a mini review.'Sometimes, on a very clear night,' the BFG said, 'and if I is swiggling my ears in the right direction'-and here he swivelled his great ears upwards so they were facing the ceiling - 'if I is swiggling them like this and the night is very clear, I is sometimes hearing faraway music coming from the stars in the sky.'I finally read this book after leaving it standing on my bookshelf for months because I still hadn't find the right time to read it until few days ago.
Hahahahahahahahahahahaahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahah
The BFG is a good giant, he intrigued me with his own language from the first.
Sophie is a girl kidnapped from her bed and her adventure just begins when she and the BFG have to stop the ruthless giants before they devour all of human beans.Dahl could create the book that hooked me from the beginning and the ending of this book was so delightful, I felt very happy after I finished it.
I like his writing style, it captivates me to no end.เป็นหนังสือที่น่ารักเบาสมองเล่มหนึ่ง การดำเนินเรื่องและภาษาที่ใช้มีเอกลักษณ์และจุดเด่นเหล่านี้ทำให้หนังสือสามารถคงความคลาสสิคเอาไว้ได้ถึงแม้เวลาจะผ่านไปหลายปี เจ้ายักษ์ BFG ออกมาสร้างสีสันตลอดทั้งเรื่องจนทำให้อ่านไปอมยิ้มไป ส่วนโซฟีก็พรีเซนต์ตัวละครที่อยู่ในช่วงวัยเด็กออกมาได้อย่างเหมาะสม สไตล์การเล่าเรื่องมีความคมที่เป็นเสน่ห์ของนิยาย ไม่แปลกใจเลยที่ The BFG สามารถเข้าถึงได้ทุกช่วงวัยแบบนี้ อ่านแล้วปลื้มมาก ที่นิยายเด็กธรรมดาๆ สามารถสร้างออกมาให้ดูมีมนต์ขลังมากๆขนาดนี้(view spoiler)[ในคืนหนึ่ง โซฟีถูกยักษ์จับตัวไปจากห้องนอนของเธอ และนั่นทำให้เธอได้รู้จักกับยักษ์ใจดีที่ไม่กินคนอย่าง BFG เขาเป็นยักษ์ที่ตัวเล็กเมื่อเทียบกับเพื่อนยักษ์ตัวอื่นๆ และนอกจากนี้แล้วภาษาที่เขาใช้คุยกับโซฟีก็ยังดูแปลกประหลาดอีกด้วย BFG เป็นยักษ์ที่ทำหน้าที่สร้างฝันดีให้แก่เหล่าเด็กๆ แต่ก็มักจะโดนเพื่อนยักษ์ด้วยกันกลั่นแกล้งอยู่เสมอเมื่อเพื่อนยักษ์ของ BFG วางแผนที่จะจับเด็กๆในโรงเรียนกิน โซฟีและ BFG จึงหาทางช่วย พวกเขาได้เดินทางไปหาราชินีแห่งอังกฤษและ BFG ได้สร้างความฝันให้แก่นาง เพื่อที่นางจะเชื่อพวกเขา ราชินีตื่นมาเจอกับโซฟีและเชื่อเรื่องเล่าเกี่ยวกับยักษ์ทั้งหมดที่เด็กน้อยเล่าให้ฟัง ราชินีจึงส่งกองกำลังรบออกไปโดยมี BFG นำทางเพื่อไปจับเหล่ายักษ์กินคนมาขังไว้ในหลุมจนได้ (hide spoiler)]["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>
For the most part I enjoyed this little fantasy story, but the nonsensical language was a little too bizarre at times to the point where it seemed to overwhelm the story. Otherwise though I really liked the imaginative prose and quirky characters, not to mention the resounding message to readers that imagination and friendship are both limitless. I haven't seen this book's film adaptation yet but if the story is anything to go by, I'm sure it's an entertaining film.
A fantastic story about a misunderstood giant and a brave little girl. My kids and I loved this story but never saw the movie because we were scared to be disappointed. Dahl's stories are always full of wonderful humour and inventiveness and this was definitely one of his most imaginative. A wonderful and beautiful masterpiece.
One day Sophie decided it was time for the other nine giants to be stopped from eating women and children so the BFG and Sophie decided to pay the queen of England a visit and in order to do that they had to mix a nightmare for her to see what was going on in her contry.
No child is going to want to pick up a bok about giants eating children while they are asleep in their beds.Child: Mommy is there giants outside?Mother: Of course not *Shuts out the light and closes the door*Child: *Eyes wide with fright*Neighbors Dog: Woof!
Miravibondo! Fantelastico!
I love Roald Dahl. What wonderful children's literature he wrote. Even though its for children adults love it too. Like Enid Blyton and Beatrix Potter. Lovely easy reading. I strongly recommend all three authors.🐯👍
Reread because the trailer for the upcoming movie got me all excited! Classic, love this story so much.

Entertaining little story.
I used to really enjoy Dahl's books and it has been a long time since I have read one.This one was less story and more silly wordplay and fantasy.
Towards the end it gets into a storyline, but at least the first half is mainly just a conversation between the BFG and Sophie.
It is fun, but gets a bit repetitive.
All that aside - it was silly, it was fun, it was a romp through the imagination.
I definitely enjoyed this little fantastical getaway, even if it isn't my favorite Dahl book.
The BFG speaks in his weird, uneducated pigdin that I frankly find kind of insulting.
I'm sure children around the English speaking world are all thrilled by what Dahl has created-- but honestly, even for a word-monger like me, this is pretty ridiculous.
Also, the fact that he is uneducated and constantly judged for his speech pathology by everyone else is just douchey.2) Sophie is the most annoying Dahl protagonist ever.
3) Racial insensitivity (though this is also kind of a redeeming factor).
Dahl's bit about human beans and how they taste is hilarious, but also kind of meh.
My daughter adored this book and I still have the book today. One of our favourites.
One of my goals for 2017 is to read every book by Roald Dahl that I can get my hands on. I really enjoyed re-reading this book, since I haven't read it since middle school.In the middle of the night many people are eaten by the Bloodbottler, the Fleshlumpeater, the Bonecruncher, or any of the other giants-rather than the BFG. However, Sophie is lucky! She is captured by the BFG. He is no ordinary bone-crunching giant. He is nice and caring. When Sophie finds out that other giants eat people, she makes it her goal to stop them.
I've read some of these 4-star reviews - they grudgingly admit that their kid's attention began to wander somewhere in the middle....yeah, yeah, yeah, admit it!
I know caves.
Two thirds of this book, literally a full two thirds, consists of a single unending dialogue in this cave between Sophie and the Giant.
Sophie asks a question, and the Giant answers in his INSUFFERABLE DIALECT!!!!, providing some cutesy, backwards explanation about how things work in Giant Country.
Here's a good message: don't read shit to your children.
For the sake of the children.Because they know.
I grinned from ear to ear, I laughed out loud, and I even nodded in grave seriousness. These are the reactions  The BFG had evoked from me. ‘Human beans is the only animals that is killing their own kind. Even poisnowse snakes is never killing each other. Nor is the most fearsome creatures like tigers and rhinostossterisses. None of them is ever killing their own kind. Has you ever thought about that?’- The BFG (If you're amused or puzzled at the poor usage of grammar and spellings, I don't quit
‘Human beans is the only animals that is killing their own kind.
None of them is ever killing their own kind.
What's more,  The BFG is also ironic at times and it put me to ponder about the ways of humans.
The Big Friendly Giant is the only one of his kind to disapprove of eating human beings.
Before long, they realized they had to do something about the man-eating giants.This was full of adventures.
I've also come to appreciate Dahl’s wry humour and his new never-been-seen-on-dictionaries vocabularies have marked his writing style as unique.It was the movie trailer that pushed me to read the written work and I have no regrets.
There isn't a children's book that Dahl has written that doesn't kickstart the imagination.
Now, I admit, I'm only 19, so I don't pretend to know a lot about child-raising, but I stand by what I said--it's important for kids to imagine and believe in the impossible.
I'm not much of a grown-up myself, but the needs of my imagination are why you'll find me checking books out from my library's childrens' section.
This is one of Roald Dahl's books that I hadn't read as a child.
Every year I plan to write a blog post to celebrate Roald Dahl Day and every year time runs away with me and I somehow end up missing it. But this year we're celebrating 100 years since his birth so I guess that makes it a perfect time to talk about how much Roald Dahl's books meant to me as a child. I used to reread all of his books over and over again but The BFG was always my favourite, I just loved everything about it from the friendship that forms between Sophie and the BFG, to the adventu
Roald Dahl's stories always have a darker side to them and the giants terrified me but you get to see justice served in the end which was incredibly satisfying.I still have my original copy of this book from 1985 and it's one of my most treasured and reread books.
I think I've probably seen this adaptation of the story even more times than I've read the book and I have to say it's pretty perfect.
I wasn't the only one either and pretty much the entire audience was laughing hysterically.Unfortunately even though there were things I loved about the movie it didn't manage to live up to expectations and we all agreed that the animated version that is nearly 30 years old was better.
Just as delightful as I remember! :)
Moonlight hits your eyes so you get up to close the curtains.
He takes her to his home and although he is a very nice guy he can’t let her go because he is afraid that she will tell everybody that giants exist and people will hunt them.
However he protects her from the other 9 man eating giants.When Sophie tells the Bfg that they must stop the other giants from eating people he sais that this can’t be done.
The answer is simple, not only there are 9 of them, their all are twice the size of him.What Sophie and the Bfg will do?
My favourite childhood story.
Another book scratched out of my top reading list..
I already read quite a few of the author`s books and this was my last one of his.
I actually listened to the audio read by David Walliams.
He did an excellent job, especially with the invented words that the BFG uses and the different characters of the story.
It was wonderful done.
He actually made the story even more hilarious by his narration.Overall, it's Roald Dahl's story, I mean he's an icon, right?
He always has the most funniest, weirdest and wonderful magical stories.
Syyskuun 13.
päivä tulee kuluneeksi sata vuotta brittiläisen kirjailijan Roald Dahlin syntymästä.
19 lastenkirjaa, 9 novellikokoelmaa ja lukuisia käsikirjoituksia ja sovituksia elokuviin ja tv-sarjoihin.
Dahlin kirjoittamia on jopa muutama Bond-elokuva.
Tästä ihanasta Iso Kiltti Jätti teoksesta on myös tehty elokuva.Roald Dahlin lastenkirja Iso Kiltti Jätti on suurenmoinen ystävyystarina kahden yksinäisen kohtaamisesta ja ystävyyden syntymisestä.
Toinen on iso fantasiaolento ja toinen pieni tyttö.
Toinen on vanha ja toinen vasta 8-vuotias.
Ystävyys ei katso peiliin, se ei katso ikää eikä ulkonäköä.
Ystävyys katsoo sydämeen.
Pieni Sohvi sai päättäväisyydellään Ison Kiltin Jätin toimimaan oikein ja lopettamaan muiden jättiläisten ikävät rikokset.
Roald Dahl on kirjoittanut unohtumattoman lastenkirjan.
"Human beans is thinking they is very clever, but they is not.
They is nearly all of them notmuchers and squeakpips," says the BFG in Roald Dahl's most philosophical work, and, well, that's about accurate I guess, and I'm not sure how I feel about exposing an eight-year-old to this kind of truth.
"Human beans is the only animals that is killing their own kind," he also says, which is not actually true but the point is more or less valid.
But "Meanings is not important" anyway, says the Giant.
First of all, I read this book in my native language and I think much of the BFG's way of speaking was lost in the translation process.
While reading, I was constantly wondering what the original words might have been.Second, my son had to read The BFG for school.
I think the story failed to fully capture his attention.
So, he found himself in the situation in which tomorrow is the Reading Club at school and he didn't read it.
well, pretty much everything that was not in this book.I hope my son's next Reading Club book is girlier (so I can enjoy it if I have to read it).
