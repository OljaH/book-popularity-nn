Now this is more like it. The Black is back, with his small, proud head, his finely molded muzzle, his arrogant carriage! And Alec, impetuous and wrong-headed, sure of himself and his stallion. Also Henry, wise, grizzled and always right. Plus adventure! Fires! Horse fights! Horse races! Police action! Every bit as good as I remembered, but I'd forgotten the painfully awful Italian dialect Farley put in the mouth of Tony who is always referred to as "the huckster". Itsa beeg, beeg shame, thatsa what I mean, anna itsa gonna cost ol' Meester Farley onea hees stars.
The masterful way that Farley can give just the right amount of information to engage your brain while letting your imagination automatically fill in the rest is simply beyond measure.Young readers will love his action-packed story of the Black's return and will find their hearts racing as he and his son battle the blaze so often depicted on the cover of the book.
If you loved the series as a child, you'll be picking it up again and enjoy every minute as if it was the first time.
The setting of this book first takes place in Alec’s barn when he gets this later from Abu Ishak’s daughter sends Alec a letter telling him that he will be getting the Black back because he died when the wild stallion threw him off.
Then, the rest of the book took place in a quarantine barn because the horses needed to be monitored to see if they had come down with the deadly illness.
Alec finally fixed the conflict in the book because he found a gate in the pasture that led to the valley.
I've been transported back into my childhood - longing with Alec to see Black again, hoping that he'll won't want to fight, being terrified that Black and Satan caught the Swamp fever and being on the edge of my seat when Alec rides Black to save the horses from the fire. ♥ Wonderful!
When I was a kid and The Black Stallion movie came out in 1979 or so, I was secretly hoping that the whole series would be filmed -- or at least up to this book.This book also gives a spotlight to the Black's long-suffering friend, the grey gelding Napoleon.
I think he's mentioned in The Black Stallion's Filly but that's about it with him in the series.
I always wondered what kind of magic Napoleon possessed to calm the Black down, since he wasn't female.
Now that I'm an adult, I now wonder if there was some sort of "special" relationship between the Black and ol' Nappy.
"You got to have respect for what any horse might do."Ah, The Black and Satan, my favorite literary horse, and a literary horse that annoys but captivates me.
The thing I love about The Black is that his bond with Alec is so strong.
It's what every little girl wants with a horse (or maybe because I grew up reading The Black Stallion that's what *I* wanted with a horse).
But Satan is just wild.We've got them basically pitted against each other here.
The Black never got to race in the Triple Crown, so who's to say who's the better horse?
My daughter says this was one of the most exciting Black Stallion books we’ve read so far in the series!
One of my favorite books.
I doted on all the Black Stallion and Red Stallion books as a teenager. I had the whole collection until I gave them to my granddaughter, who is an excellent rider.
Great book
Great!Walter Farley has done it again in another classic book of the Black and Satan! If you love his stories about The Black Stallion, I would recommend reading this book.
A good read for kids.
One of my favorites as a kid
I only read the first then this one but it was still awsome!
What a relief! The Black proves himself faster than his son. And Alec is mature enough not to gloat to Henry about it.This was, as always, thrilling and riveting! But this time, the ultimate race doesn't take place on the track, but in race against a fire!
Do not be discouraged by the title of the book. Satan is the name of the Black's colt. Over all it is pretty good.
Really good book. Loved it
In the fourth instalment of the series, Alec is facing a crisis - he loves racing Satan, but has begun to feel as if the horse is no longer his.
But word gets out and soon everyone is speculating as to which is the fastest horse - the Black or his son.
Eventually, it's only Alec who finds out who is the fastest.A good enough story, but showing its age in places.
I like the fact that Alec begins to question his role with Satan, the wanting to be an everyday part of his life.
The Black Stallion and Satan is the culmination of everything we'd been waiting for in the series up to that point.
Though Alec was granted the first son of the Black, Satan, we knew that his love for The Black could not be overshadowed.
Well, now you have this fantastic and tension-filled story of two strong stallions, both with a tie to Alec Ramsey, meeting.
And you have the question - which one is faster, the sire or his son?Farley delivers to his fans with this much anticipated meeting of The Black Stallion and Satan.
There's a lot of lead-in to what ends up being an extremely rushed climax.
That was pretty disconcerting.Also, I wish Farley would have realized that he's crap at having his horse characters meet up in a race, because he loves them all, and stopped doing it.
And I think we all figured that the Black was going to (view spoiler)[end up being faster than Satan (hide spoiler)], so we didn't really need a book about it, but the premise was actually okay, if we would have got a real race out of it.
I started re-reading The Black Stallion series by Walter Farley in April and read five more from that series in May: Son of the Black Stallion, The Black Stallion and Satan, The Island Stallion, The Island Stallion's Fury, and The Blood Bay Colt. Only The Black Stallion and Satan was as enjoyable as when I was a kid, though I remember never really caring for the Island Stallion "spin-offs" or the two books on harness racing. Where's Alec and The Black? Bring 'em back!
This was the second Black Stallion book I ever read and I was confused when it started with a different horse, having missed the introduction of Satan in the previous novel. Once I got over my confusion, I found it very enjoyable and though it was well written and well thought out. Loved the exciting race at the end.
I'm weeding this because when I opened it the pages fell out, but seriously this has got to be the most awesome title ever. Also it was a trifecta of win when I also found a trippy book about white horses and witchcraft that takes place in Columbus.
Now that Alec inherits the Black back, this series got good again. I was glued to this book to see what would happen! And it touched my hear to the point of tears to see what Tony and his Nappy (Napoleon) did for Satan and the Black.
I enjoyed the characters, and their world and hope I get the chance to read the story again and/or to read more within the series.My Rating System:* couldn't finish, ** wouldn't recommend, *** would recommend, **** would read again, ***** have read again.
Who is faster, the Black Stallion or Satan, his son? No one really knows. The race of the century is on!And off, as the horses to race are strike with Equine Infectious Anemia and must be quarantined. Will the two great stallions face each other, or will they never make it to the track?
I raced through this series as a child. Of course, "The Black Stallion" was my favorite, and I read it a few times, but I waited eagerly for any of the books to return to my branch of the library so I could snap them up.
Satan is the Black Stallion's son who is POSSIBLY FASTER THAN THE BLACK STALLION. You really don't want it to be true though and in the end there's a barn fire and they both escape and the Black Stallion runs faster than Satan. What a relief.
I included this book because it was one of those books that I read as a child that opened the door to "Reading For Pleasure" for me. I recently found an old copy at a 2nd hand book store so I hope to reread it soon.
