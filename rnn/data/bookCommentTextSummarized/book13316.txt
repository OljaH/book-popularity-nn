English (Four Past Midnight) / ItalianoFour short novels (not so short, actually) of one of the best contemporary writers out there.
and you will not sleep anymore.Vote: 8,5Quattro lunghi racconti di uno dei migliori romanzieri contemporanei in circolazione.
I Langolieri (il mio preferito dei quattro), trasporta il lettore, assieme ai protagonisti, in una dimensione parallela.
L‚Äôignoto e la paura per ci√≤ che non conosciamo sono il tema principale, e l‚Äôatmosfera che si respira ricorda molto quella de ‚ÄúAi Confini della Realt√†‚Äù, la fortunata TV serie cult.
Uno dei migliori racconti che io abbia letto.
e non dormirete pi√π.Voto: 8,5
No spoilers, but so many wonderful twists happen, couldn't help but fall in love all over again.And then there's The Library Police, which is a wonderful twist on early childhood nightmares, a diatribe on fear, Red Licorice, and a cool twist on vampirism.
It was definitely probably the most effective and convoluted of all the novellas in this book, I think, and also the most scarily fantastic, diving into some of the most weird and eerie escapades, even outdoing Secret Window, Secret Garden on several levels, but maybe not as much for the MC.
But the dog in the photograph has got to be even better in this novella.
The overall theme of this collection, whether Stephen King realizes it or not, is that lazy little sin we call sloth.
And if you wanna make a fortune not by working but by profiting off other people's misfortune, the Sun dog might make you a Scooby snack.I do have a personal favorite here, along with a personal story for each of these short novels, but I must ask your pardon, because both shall remain a mystery.
Suffice it to say that Secret Window, Secret Garden will always be an important story to me and one of King's twistier tales.
This is a great book. The Library Policeman scared the shit out of me. Thinking about that nasty man with the lisp sends a shiver down my spine!
200 pages each) and as all of  King's works, the super-natural has a very important role in them.1) The first one is called "The Langoliers" and is about a group of people who wake up in an deserted plane.
(I'd give it 2/5)3) The third story is called "The Library Policeman".
As the years go by, I find it harder to find books which you can't stop reading.
(I give this one 5/5)4) The last but not least, is a story called "The Sun Dog".
It's about a camera that takes pictures of some unknown place.(5/5 is my opinion)At the end, my average grade is 4/5 for this book
Rather than take the time to construct a path for the characters to obtain knowledge in a reasonable way, King relies almost completely on intuition and gut feelings, psychic connections between people, the influence of supernatural objects or beings, and tremendous leaps in logic.- DEUS EX MACHINA.
The dialogue isn't bad, for a King novel, but the character relationships, the plotline, and the actual premise of the story are heavily contrived.
That,and a perfectly logical fear of toothy existence-devouring beasties!Secret Window, Secret Garden: Having already seen and enjoyed the film adaptation, I wasn't sure what to expect from the original novel.
Think I may have preferred the film ending though, that was (unusually for Hollywood) somewhat darker.The Library Policeman: I have a feeling this will be my favourite story in this collection!
And remember kids, renew or return your books in good time, or the Library Policeman just might pay you a visit!The Sun Dog: Cameras are sort of strange.
And I never was much of a 'dog person', anyway ...Overall, a great collection.
My personal favourite was The Library Policeman.
As they tried to figure out what was going on, the fact that the world they had entered was "expired" and dead, useless, like a husk, I have to say that I do not like that theory about time-travel, lol, it's always been a dream to travel back in time and experience the people and places and things of the past, I would be sorely disappointed to go back to that!
This story was more than just another spook tale, it was about the things people keep locked away in their memories, and the power those memories can hold."The Sun Dog" I vaguely remember used to be my favorite in the collection, and I still think it's a great, entertaining story.
We have the small band of survivors fighting for life against an apocalyptic setting a'la The Stand and The Mist (The Langoliers), a psychic child (again, The Langoliers), the tortured writer (Secret Window, Secret Garden), repressed childhood memories/using the innocence of childhood to fight a shape-shifting monster (The Library Policeman) and a boring-as-shit Castle Rock tale about a murderous dog (The Sun Dog).
My ratings for each story are as follows: The Langoliers: 3 Secret Window, Secret Garden: 4The Library Policeman: 3The Sun Dog: 1 That puts the average at 2.75, which rounds up to 3.
One of Kings top "long short stories"/novellas and a solid 5-star read!Secret Window, Secret Garden I do realize it's probably me, because a lot of people seem to like this one very much, but nothing in it works for me.
Again, just enough is explained and expanded on to make this story work all the way.
As any CR story full with great references and characters.
I'd give this one a strong 4-star.So, in my view, three stories that make up one of the best collections of (kind of) short stories that I know and one that's easily skipped in my view.
This contains two absolutely creepy stories - "The Langoliers", about a planeload of people trapped in dead time and "The Library Policeman" about a childhood boogeyman come alive. It also contains "Secret Window, Secret Garden" - the prototype for the novel The Dark Half. An excellent collection.
The Langoliers - *****Secret Window, Secret Garden - ****The Library Policeman - ***The Sun Dog - ****I always get a bookgasm when King introduces a story with a short intro on how the story came to be. Too much info? Overall - 4 stars
I've detailed my thoughts on each individual story below, but suffice to say this really is a second string collection.The Langoliers First things first, Stephen King really can‚Äôt write an English accent.
It‚Äôs the kind of thing that encourages repeat readings as the story, and Mort‚Äôs actions within it, make a lot more sense once you know that twist.
Finally there‚Äôs the ending (what is it with stories in this collection and crap endings?) ‚Äì a twist epilogue which is needless and rubbish on so many levels.So ‚ÄòThe Sun Dog‚Äô is far from perfect, but when it‚Äôs at its best this is vintage King.
These are great novellas by the master storyteller Stephen King!!Actually I read these Storys in my 
Per la verit√†, non si tratta di un romanzo vero e proprio, ma √® solo una raccolta di quattro racconti brevi in cui lo stesso scrittore rende omaggio, diciamo cos√¨, alla sua professione ed al suo stesso estro creativo.
Dei quattro racconti che compongono il libro, questo √® il migliore in assoluto anche se, in alcuni punti, la trama ricalca un po' troppo La met√† oscura, un altro libro di Stephen King uscito l'anno prima.3.
Come per i due precedenti racconti anche questa volta ho notato una certa mania autocelebrativa di Stephen King: i fatti di questo racconto, in cui si parla di un mostruoso cane con la rabbia, si svolgono a Castle Rock...

I know some may not like his stuff and say that his work goes to you, not you to it, and somehow that makes his writing terrible?
Yet another of King's works that was made into a movie, with Depp no less, and even the movie I thought was tame and very predictable.
A local guy making a speech at the rotary club wants to really 'wow' the crowd so he goes to the library for some help, there he meets the 'librarian'....
Because I didn't really like it, it had no intrigue.
update Fev. 2017One Past Midnight: The Langoliers - 4*This was a gripping roller-coaster of emotions and actions!I couldn't put the book down, I really need to find out what would happen to the characters.
I'm not sure if it was the end, or something else.Three Past Midnight: The Library Policeman - 5*Can a Stephen King story have a happy ending?
And fear is something Stephen King likes to play with.
The existence of The Library Policemen is a very interesting premise.And besides I'm only mentioning childhood fears, the characters of the book are grownups.
3.5 or 3.75, I can't decide. I liked The Langoliers very much and I liked the Sun Dog. Before each story is an introduction. I stopped reading it after it spoiled Secret Garden, Secret Window. The Library Policeman was good too. I think the weakest story is this collection was Secret Garden.. but they may have been cause it was spoiled. I haven't seen any of the movie adaptations of any of these. I wouldn't say any of these are King's #1 best but they were not his worse either. I may revisit them again someday.
Five big, fat ones for this collection of four of King's best novellas. I loved it when he first released it, and it was even better these many years later. I had nearly forgotten the last two, so they were almost new reads for me. The Langoliers has always been one of my favorites.
This was such a fun read! Each of the novellas was very interesting in its own way, but in particular I loved The Langoliers.

Pod pretpostavkom da je aparat pokvaren i sa ≈æeljom da isti zadr≈æi, umesto da ga jednostavno zameni u lokalnoj prodavnici, Kevin odlazi jedinom ƒçoveku koji bi mogao da mu pomogne - Pop Meril.

I u prethodnim priƒçama smo nailazili na poruku kako ipak najveƒáe zlo dolazi od ljudi i njihovih postupaka, a ovde je to odliƒçno prikazano kroz Pop Merilove postupke.
Svakako, odliƒçna priƒça i kao celina, "ƒåetiri iza ponoƒái" je fantastiƒçna zbirka.

At the same time, it's the reason I picked up this collection to begin with.While most of us probably don't need much encouragement to have anxiety while flying, King gives us a tale that takes place on a flight from LA to Boston.
The first assumption is, they were drugged and the rest of the passengers were offloaded somehow...but then other things start to pop up...The characters are introduced and we find that there is a pilot, a teenage musician, a druggie, a psychotic businessman, an author (I couldn't believe it either), and more.
Quickly, they start figuring things out and without giving anything away, the way King reveals each of these details is just amazing.
The first two stories were on the boring side, mostly because I had seen the movies. The third story, The Library Policeman, was actually pretty good up until one moment that involves trigger warnings (view spoiler)[A young boy is raped and what it feels like is described... I was going to say too much but any description was too much. (hide spoiler)]. The fourth story, The Sun Dog, was the only one that I actually enjoyed out of the four.
This was the book that turned me off Stephen King forever. Normally he is a great writer, if not a very original one, but the stories here are nothing more than rewritten Twilight Zone episodes and rather badly rewritten at that. Stephen King has said in an interview that he is the fast food of literature, well he certainly is the junk food of literature and Four Past Midnight is just a regurgitation of lame story plots.
like a fourth-grader who had done something wrong this time, who had gotten up to didos and so couldn't go out and play with the other children at recess.Ted Brautigan (Hearts In Atlantis) ‚ÄúIf there are Library Police, I‚Äôm afraid they‚Äôd be after me.‚Äù***THE LANGOLIERS:The Shop (The Stand, Firestarter, The Tommyknockers) Smiley Face Stickers/Buttons (The Sand, DT7 ‚Äì The Dark Tower) - When Brian looks on the fuel port of the other airplane in Bangor he notices a round smiley face sticker, similar to the one Randall Flagg wears in The Dark Tower 7.
What always amazes me is how King can take simplest of ideas, and make a wonder out of them.
I mean how many times have you stopped and actually contemplated this thing we call "time" and all the hows, and ifs and buts that can be associated with it.
If you have, you'll know how scary it can be, just not being able to make sense of "time" and what games it can play with you.üìòSo, if you find this subject interesting, this collection of four novellas is for you, all dealing with the idea of time.
