Dear Raine, London streets are ALWAYS crowded.
In fact, I don't think there is a strip mall in the whole of the British Isles.5) The hero drives a Range Rover.
Instead, it makes him stupid (the price of petrol in the UK is more than double the price of gas in the US) and for a security guy, not able to traverse very many London streets (they weren't exactly originally built for cars, much less Range Rovers.) Not to mention the problem of where to park it while out and about!
No, instead Brynne is freaked out because of some DEEP and MYSTERIOUS cause she can't think about.
The style is very engaging, the characters bounce vividly to life right from the get go and it’s set in London in the run up to the 2012 Olympics – what’s not to love?I think, as you’re reading the novel, it pays to remember the prologue – it’s very short and easy to forget when you’re caught up in the story but it’s VERY IMPORTANT!!Brynne is our heroine – an American grad student studying in London supplementing her income with some tasteful nude modelling (the cover art is the picture at the centre of the novel).
★★★★★! Naked, book 1 of 4. The Ethan Blackstone, larger-than-life, handsome, rich playboy and security expert extraordinaire sets out to protect his American girl in a suspenseful and deadly high-stakes political game!   “That picture changed everything. I was not the same after I saw it and I couldn’t go back to the man I’d been before seeing it either. Not after we met that night on the street. My whole world altered because of a photograph. A photograph of my beautiful American girl.”   The
The Ethan Blackstone, larger-than-life, handsome, rich playboy and security expert extraordinaire sets out to protect his American girl in a suspenseful and deadly high-stakes political game!
The Blackstone Affair series follows world-renowned security expert and owner of Blackstone International Ltd., Ethan Blackstone in his whirlwind romance with American born University of London student Brynne Bennett.
Little facts are given initially, but will instead slowly unfold throughout series as Ethan sets out not only to guard Brynne but to win her heart and own her.
Ethan, like Brynne, has a dark past that will unfold over the span of the series.
I’ve included the prologue at the end of the review to see if it’ll sell you on it too cuz everything about it made me want to know more!The story starts out when Ethan Blackstone, ex-Special Forces and now head of a high end British security firm, is given the task of protecting Brynne, an American student studying in London.
The story is told mostly from her POV and while her past held her back from being fully comfortable with Ethan, it was in a completely understandable way and I just absolutely loved that he had no problem with it.
Ethan wanted me.
What. Was. That? I get that this is a novella but serious? Put some effort into it. This was me about 15% inBut I figured it was only 100-some pages so I might as well see what was going to happen. Well. It was basically all the naughty words you could think of mixed in with NO plot. Serious. I tried to find it.And then the end. Serious? I just don’t care enough to find out what might happen in the sequel.
What The Hell Was That?!?!?!I don't know what it is about this book, but I just couldn't get into it. I felt like everything developed way too fast. I had no emotional connection with the characters. The author literally tells you what to feel instead of actually making you feel that way. You know when you start reading a book and you actually feel like you're falling in love along with the characters!?!? …. Ummm yeah, I didn’t get any of those feelings at all with this book except extreme boredom.
I reiterate, you can't help that books are going to have similar underlying themes, but how the story plays out, the way characters are portrayed and the skill of the author's writing, is what differentiates them and sets them apart.
The story is told from Brynne’s first person point-of-view, although the prologue is from Ethan’s.Ethan is charming, amusing, gritty and mouth-wateringly sexy, sensual, and oh so HOT!
Brynne is a woman who doesn not takes kindly to deception and Ethan might have just well met his Waterloo!
The heroine Brynne Bennett was sure to be an interesting character-- an American who moved to London to study as a grad student and work at the same time as a part-time photographic model.
This actually reminds me of the book that I liked, On Dublin Street.Our hero, the alluring Ethan James Blacktone was one of those typical rich, Alpha males that you couldn't resist.
Yes, the sexual tension that both characters developed right at the start was thick and palpable, yet I felt like it simmered so quickly that I didn't really find myself be affected.The romantic scenes were sure to be steamy, but they weren't as emotionally charged as I've expected.
4.5 SIZZLING ETHAN STARS "Open your eyes" he told me. I lifted them to see Ethan's face a mere inch away, his blue eyes burning hot with lust.""I'm not your girl, Ethan.""You were during that kiss Brynne." Eyes flickering, he read me, and then he inhaled. I was a damp mess between my legs and I wondered if he could smell me. "You smell so good....and f*cking sexy." This book...OMG! Wow...It was surprisingly fantastic. It was sexy, hot and just plain steamy but there was a plot. It wasn't just se
I lifted them to see Ethan's face a mere inch away, his blue eyes burning hot with lust.""I'm not your girl, Ethan.""You were during that kiss Brynne." Eyes flickering, he read me, and then he inhaled.
There really are no words to describe just how deliciously possessive this man is...he absolutely made my hot book boy list.Brynne is an American student who is living in London studying Art. She seems to have some issue that she's trying to evade back home in the States.
She is a wonderful, sweet character that I fell in love with.The chemistry between Brynne and Ethan is off the charts hot.
So aside from one ex for each of them that show up briefly (accidental meetings at coffee shop and party), there is absolutely no OW or OM drama.Brynne pushes him away briefly a couple of times in the series, but Ethan does not stand for it.Condoms are not used more than they are.
They discuss STDs and she is on birth control.This is a big reveal from book 2 so I will tag again - only read if you cannot handle past abuse or lost pregnancy and need to be prepared (view spoiler)[Brynne was a self described slut in high school.
“I want to be with you so badly right now.
I want to take you home with me, and put you in my bed and have hours and hours with your body wrapped up in mine to do with as I wish.
I want to have you there in the morning so when we wake up I can make you come, saying my name.
I want to drive you to work and pick you up when it’s time to leave.
I want to go to the shops with you and buy food we can cook for d
Meet Ethan Blackstone...Do I have your attention yet?
How about now?Despite Naked being a short read, it was one that was thoroughly enjoyable.
Ah, Ethan, you did make this a pleasurable read.
This man knew all the dirty right things to say to leave me boneless and breathless.
The scenes between Ethan and Brynne were "shove your head in the freezer and plant your ass in an ice bucket" hot, their chemistry electric.The ending leaves you wanting more and desperate to move onto the next installment.
In saying that, I'm keeping this review short and sweet...
As you read Naked you start to get the feeling that Brynne is running/hiding from someone or something that happened in her past.
She knows off the bat that the security business does him good; from his Ferragamo shoes and crisp suit to the Range Rover waiting at the sidewalk.
How did you get this number?The next day Brynne is shocked to get a phone call from Ethan.
Yes our alpha male Ethan has stalker tendencies.
Ethan is a true alpha male and if you like that as much as I do than this is a book for you.
So I desperately wanted to like this book after all the amazing reviews and even a 4.11 on Good Reads.
It was compared to 50 shades and Bared to you but I am beginning to think I am not reading the same book that all the reviewers read...AT ALL!
Just really lacking in suspense and storyline and meat of the characters I can't possibly imagine what she will write about in the next several books.I will finish this out because I paid for it but I am 71% in and really disappointed and don't think my opinion will change over the next 29%.
*****4.5 I Heart Ethan Blackstone STARS*****I've had this series on my TBR for quite some time.All I can say is I feel like kicking myself for waiting so long to read this book!!Any story that has David Gandy as the muse for the leading male character, is a book I'm more than likely going to LOVE!!!!I pretty much had to wipe the drool from my mouth the entire time I read this book, as I had very vivid pictures of Gandy in my mind!!

This story swept me away and kept my attention the entire time.I'm completely head over heels for Mr Ethan Blackstone!!"Naked" ends on a cliffy, but luckily since I waited so long to read this series, I don't have to wait to dive into the next book!!!!
I was going to wait until book two was out due to the heartbreaking cliffhanger, but after doing a little research reading other reviews and entering in the authors webpage I was really intrigued.And of course, after finding out that David Gandy was the inspiration for Ethan I couldnt help myself and picked the book right away.

I was going to wait until book two was out due to the heartbreaking cliffhanger, but after doing a little research reading other reviews and entering in the author´s webpage I was really intrigued.And of course, after finding out that David Gandy was the inspiration for Ethan I couldn´t help myself and picked the book right away.
They meet and click right away, but a little too fast for my taste, I would have liked a bit more of dating before they got down to business.By the end of the book a lot of questions pop up like Ethan´s and Brynne´s troubled past, I hope they´ll be addressed in the next book.
Ethan Blackstone was asked as a favor to watch over Brynne by her Dad. Ethan wasn't going to do it but then he saw her picture and he just couldn't resist.
Granted he's too dominant and too forward but I love all his reactions to all things Brynne.
It was so refreshing!Both Brynne and Ethan have had tragic events happen in their pasts and as with any new relationship, they will slowly get to those.
The next book, All In, is from Ethan's POV and I can only imagine what's going on in his head!
I don't know what it was about this book, but I just couldn't get into it. You know when you read a book and you feel like your falling in love/lust along with them? Yeah, I got nothing with 'Naked'. Except bored.
*^*4 Hot/Juicy ETHAN*^*stars"I want the real thing.
MINE.The story starts out with Brynne, part-time model/art student meeting Ethan Blackstone after he buys her nude portrait.
She's broken and doesn't think Ethan will want her after he finds out the truth.
SECRETS, LOVE, PASSION, HEARTACHE, TRUST...stay tuned as this continues on in book 2 "ALL IN"
"You're too damn beautiful for your own good, Ethan Blackstone"My BRYNNE:
"I love when you do that," "Do what?""When you kiss my hand."
This was my face at the end of this book......destroyed!!!
I love Bradley Cooper aka ETHAN BLACKSTONE, so i threw in an extra picture to ogle :)
I keep skipping over the "rich man, poor little innocent girl" books because they all started running together after awhile.
Admit it...it's eye catching.And the book is all in good erotic, American girl fantasy.
We American ladies love a sexy British accent...refined and elegant and chivalrous...(it really just makes us want to drop our panties).
One thing leads to another, and our truly smitten Ethan does his damndest to convince Brynne that she's all he ever wanted.
My favorite line in the book...Ethan keeps staring at Brynne, and she sort of snaps at him, asking why he keeps looking at her.
devoured past participle, past tense of de·vour (Verb)Verb:  1. Eat (food or prey) hungrily or quickly. 2.(of fire, disease, or other forces) Consume (someone or something) destructively.That is  EXACTLY what I did with this Novella.I was hooked from the prologue! which by the way is VERY IMPORTANT, so don't forget it. This was just the right amount of well EVERYTHING high steam factor ! <--Sex scenes off the charts!! Chemistry.. Check  “Brynne, I'm looking because I can't keep my eyes off yo

I want your sweet cunt wrapped around my cock while you scream my name because I made you come.
I want to keep you with me all fucking night long so I can take you over and over again and you don't remember anything else but me.” 
Check It was just an Intense awesome read and I cannot wait for the next after the way the book ended.
Oh bloody hell! Cliffie! Ugh...thank goodness the next book is already out. I have no idea why I waited so long to read this. Ethan is A-Fucking-Mazing! On to book 2....
Quick review:Cover: Love it Rating:  NC-17Steaminess:  Smoking Thumbs Up:  4.5Overall: A book that’s hard to put downCharacters: Well donePlot: One heart, one compelling man and danger.
A sexy mix.
Page Turner: Yes Series Cont.?
Of course Recommend:  YesBook Boyfriend: EthanSUMMARY (50 words or less)Loved this book.
Two complaints, it was short and straddled a line of insta love.
Yet, I found it compelling and well worth the price paid.
The author knew how to make a full story in a short period.
Need next book asap!For a full review and yummy pic, see my blog post at:http://mybookboyfriend.blogspot.com/2...
I gave this a quick re-read as I was going to start the next in the series.... bit of a waste of time. Very short book - did not really do it for me. Not sure now if I will read the next one.
Brynne Bennett an American Grad student studying in London, does some stylish nude modelling to supplement her income.
These tasteful works of art is purchased by the stylish ex British Special Forces and now security head honcho of his own security firm, Ethan Blackstone.
Ethan has to know her and makes his mind up that they definitely need to get together.Ethan - how I loved Ethan!
As I was told by my friend Karla, supposedly Raine Miller has used David Gandy to model him on.
Raine Miller does a great job in creating the sexual chemistry between Ethan and Brynne that just sizzles.
Loved it!
Yes! Yes! Yes! I absolutely L.O.V.E.D. Naked (The Blackstone Affair Part 1). Hot, rich, dominant alpha male Ethan meets beautiful and secretive Brynne. Their sex scenes are steamy with just enough dominance to make my pupils dialate! The story is well written, great suspense at the end and you will definitely connect with the characters. I am anxiously awaiting for Part 2 after reading the sneak peek in the back of the book. If you liked Fifty Shades, the Crossfire series, On Dublin Street, If I Were You, etc. you will LOVE Naked. Buy it now!
During the transaction, Ethan see’s Brynne talking with Ben and immediately recognizes her as the woman in the portrait he just purchased.
Instinct tells Brynne that she should not leave with a stranger, desire leads her to accept his ride and so their story begins.Ms. Miller does a fabulous job drawing the reader into the physical setting and tone of the story as well establishes an attractive couple with instant chemistry.
He told me what he wanted from me with no apology for how blunt the words were.”Brynne is terrified of investing in a serious relationship and is still not comfortable sharing her past with Ethan.
It had the content, but the pacing!
Oh sweet baby Jesus the pacing.
It was like a book of highlights cutting out everything in between; very poor execution.
It didn't flow naturally like a conversation should.
I felt like I was reading it instead of experiencing it.
One thing I will say though...there was some definite pantie dropping hotness between these rushed pages.
A few scenes left me completely breathless; it even had a few 5-star moments!
But...I'll most definitely be reaching for the sequel.
Well, this one totally left me hanging and I still want to know what happens.
So I thought David Gandy was just my Gabriel Emerson, but it turns out he is also my Ethan Blackstone! :) Devoured this book in one day! It was excellent & super steamy! Starting right now on All In! :)
Just about 4 Stars of hot, hot, hot Ethan Blackstone!! You.Are.Mine.  ♥ ♥ ♥Let me tell you about this delicious man; he is exceptional book boyfriend material!!  "He’s way too beautiful to have to resort to his hand for an orgasm.”    “……..the guy oozed hotness......”“Ethan was tight with muscles and washboard abs that melted into the most erotic V-cut I’d ever seen on a man.”   Oh yes!!! Ladies he is ripped!! Nevermind the story, it’s all about Mr Ethan Blackstone, his yummy mouth, his charisma
I would have liked the story to have been further developed and longer, especially around their meeting, it was all a bit too quick and very slightly over dramatic as a result, for my liking; I wanted more because I loved the characters so much.There were eye rolling moments for me when the typical moves of the 21st century romantic/erotic novel were pulled out, but on the other hand there were delicious, swoony, sexilicious moments that were just fabulous........Ethan and Brynne are smoking hot when they are together.
Ethan was so affectionate and I loved the way he wanted to touch me all the time.”
