They are, Rilke wrote later, 'perhaps most mysterious even to me, in the manner in which they arrived and imposed themselves on me - the most puzzling dictation I have ever received and taken down.' This kind of dictation is often the source of the worst as well as the best writings'.Hailed as one of his best pieces of writing, I have to say this not only took me by surprise, it completely blew me away, to fully experience the expressions of his immense talent.Beautiful to read, cleansing soul and spirit...Silent friend of those far away, senseHow your breath expands space.Amidst the beams of the gloomy belfry,Let yourself toll.
Çevirideki hüneri ve emeği saygıyla ayırarak söylemeli, pek çokları gibi şiirde çeviriye inanmıyorum; lakin Orpheus'a Soneler'de gözün yüzeyde dahi olsa avlayabildiği, zihnin bir anlığına bile olsa Türkçe duyup kavrayabildiği her şey, büyük -söylenmiş- bir şiire işaret ediyor, bunu hissettiriyor. Hava yerine şiir solumuş Rilke'nin yalnızca yansımasının çağ delici gücü bu. Mucizevi.
Das erste Buch, das ich habe auf Deutsch gelesen. Ich liebte Rilke von anfang an. Fantastisches buch.
Even as the farmer laborsthere where the seed turns into summer,it is not his work. It is Earth who gives.Despite the parched ground it is but a shade of spring outside. The world appears geared to disrupt such edenic days with the distant rumble of foreign thunder and a blurred blunder on the button. There were flashes here which I truly admired but not others. My hazed judgement might conceal a concern or two -- perhaps it doesn't. This series didn't engender thought so I'm moving on.

A classic, certainly. But I always feel like I'm missing out on most of the music when I read poetry in translation.
Rilke's Sonnets to Orpheus were written, remarkably, in a few weeks in a kind creative overflow after finishing The Duino Elegies, a group of ten poems that took Rilke ten years to write.
Of course, all the structure and form is lost in translation, but they still read remarkably well in English, largely because of the Rilke's imaginary.
It is curious to me that in February of 1922, when Rilke was in in his little castle in Switzerland, finishing the Duino Elegies and writing the Sonnets to Orpheus, T.

This book was bought for me on one of the most romantic and fulfilling evenings of my short life. Fresh from the Met's "Orfeo ed Euridice" wandering into a bookshop in the East Village, and returning home to a mind-gasm of reading aloud with someone I care dearly for. This collection is perfect for anyone who has loved or lost. "She slept the world..." This collection will continue to delight and haunt me for as long as I live.
But you now, you whom I knew like a flower whose nameI don’t know, I will once more remember and show youto them, you who were taken away,beautiful playmate of the invincible cryDancer first, who suddenly, with body full of lingering,paused, as though her youngness were being cast in bronze;mourning and listening— Then, from the high achieversmusic fell into her altered heart.Sickness was near.
Already overcome by the shadows,her blood pulsed more darkly, yet, as if fleetinglysuspect, it thrust forth into its natural spring.Again and again, interrupted by darkness and downfall,it gleamed of the earth.
Until after terrible throbbingit entered the hopelessly open portal.~First Part, Sonnet 25
It never felt like a cemetery, but a huge park full of tall trees and bizarre and beautiful sculptures and lazy cats.
One day I came back there with a friend and accidentally we crashed into a funeral.
I still wash my hands compulsively as to remove the scent of a candle and the hint of death.
I think the death of Rilke’s young acquaintance was a trigger to express on paper so much of his thoughts, feelings, emotions and life events… It feels really genuine the possibility of presence, absence and presence after the absence.
While I found some of these sonnets thought-provoking, they were mostly too obscure & difficult to understand for me. I appreciated the translator's notes and made extensive use of them but Rilke's philosophy about death was enigmatic. And the allusions to Orpheus and Eurydice were veiled to say the least!

Rilke çok sevdiğim şairlerden biridir. Yapıkredi Yayınlarının basımını görünce bu kitabı almak istedim. İyi ki almışım, şairin şiirlerine bayıldım. Ve Yapıkredi yayınlarının bu denli güzel çalışması, açıklama ve, şairin notları kısmı çok güzeldi. Kitaplığımın Kazım Taşkent Klasik Yapıtlar Dizisi ile dolması dileğiyle.... 😍
My review is incredibly influenced by the fact that just before this, I read Averno. Louise Glück’s poetry has a special place in my heart, so my judgement suffers terribly from this. Rilke’s poetry is great, but it didn’t make me feel as Averno did.
This book was savored, digested a few pages at a time during July and August of this summer's adventure on a bicycle bicycle across the eastern half of the country and the Transamerica Bicycle Trail. In the midst of this long journey, I found Rilke's poetry to be full of possibilities and challenges, making the book an ideal companion.
I haven't stopped reading this book since I received it as a gift in the spring of 2006. Rilke is arguably the greatest poet of the 20th century. He confirms Holderlin's great words that poetry points to being itself.
A more literal, sparer translation than the Stephen Mitchell, good for students of German and, if less beautiful, truer to the succinctness of the original. Especially recommended is Sonnet #2, though there is plenty of heart-crushing material to be found here.
Oh, this is strange, passionate, poetry that is concerned with music, death,love, life, ecstacy--but trying to get at those things thru language. You have to read this before you die.
Coming back to this volume has been interesting. It has a magical force to it--the speaker and the presumed audience seem to shift in delicate ways, although the presumed structure is Rilke writing to Orpheus, and there is a sense that Rilke is channeling some deep and wise force in the universe, with surprising and delightful incantations resulting: "Dance the orange. Who can forget it,/ drowning it itself, how it struggles against its own sweetness." "The water is strange and the water is yours,/ from here and from far below... Your task is to love what you don't understand."

Meni täysin yli hilseen! Juuri tällaiset runot saavat minut tuntemaan itseni tyhmäksi. Rilke on kuulemma hyvä ja arvostettu. Jokaisen sonetin luin - ainoatakaan en ymmärtänyt. Minulle ne olivat vain sanoja peräkkäin. Yritin myös pitkää saksaa lukeneena ja Sveitsissä asuneena lukea, myös saksaksi. Sanat ymmärsin, merkitystä en! Joo, ei mun runoja!

O be enraptured with flame,wherein a thing eludes you that is boastful with changes;that projecting spirit, which masters the earthly,loves in the swing of the figure nothing so much as the point of inflection.What shuts itself into remaining already is starkness;does it think itself safe in the shelter of the inconspicuous gray?Beware, from afar a hardest comes warning the hard.Woe--, an absent hammer lifts!Who pours himself forth as a spring, him Cognizance knows;and she leads him enchanted through the realm of serene creation,that often ends with beginning and with ending begins.Every happy space they wander wondering throughis child or grandchild of parting.
« El canto como tú lo enseñas no es anhelo,no es petición de algo aún no conseguido;el canto es existencia. Es fácil para el dios.¿Pero cuándo existimos nosotros? ¿Cuándo viraél hacia nuestro ser los astros y la tierra?El que tú ames, muchacho, no es idéntico, aunquela voz te esté forzando a abrir la boca. Aprendea olvidar que has cantado. [...] »
This became a secondary concern after a few pages as I found myself enjoying the beauty of the language and the thought, and not worrying about the meaning.Although the notes at the back of the book include passages from Ovid's Metamorphoses describing the myth of Orpheus, in fact only two or three of the Sonnets make reference to that myth, and it is possible to enjoy much of the book without knowing the myth in detail.Many of the poems seem religious in tone, ranging from songs of praise to hushed prayers to questions about existence.Formally, like standard sonnets, these poems are fourteen lines long; however, line-lengths vary from one sonnet to the next.
Možná je to tím, že se v jeho verších ztrácím a kolikrát váhám nad tím, co tím chtěl asi básník říct.A o co tedy v knize jde?
Takto nablízku původním silám jsou tím pádem obdařeni schopností vnímat tóny běžným smrtelníkům neslyšitelné.Sonety Orfeovi jistě nejsou čtením na dobrou noc.
Aby z nich člověk něco měl, musí se nad nimi zamyslet a někdy i složitě hloubat, co tím bylo myšleno a nebo naopak, zda to vůbec nějaký význam má.
"na jeden zátah" a přiznejme si, je to na nich docela znát - tím ale samozřejmě nechci říct, že by byly špatné).
I like that mund (mouth) is similar to the Spanish mundo/mundial (world).
I also in general like how grammar structures from the source-language translate into novel juxtapositions of words in the target-language.
It's hard for me to say if it's Rilke or the language or both, but something seems off (maybe tonally)--more so than, say, Spanish to English or Korean to English--in a number of the poems.
I'll say right now in a vague way that the unevenness of each poem, rather than being an impediment, seems to add a special momentum to the sonnets as a whole.
I've been trawling the Rilke sonnets for months and it started with this bi-lingual edition.
Meanwhile I have collected numerous other English translations.
This edition, with the C.F. MacIntyre translation, has ended up at the bottom of the pile.
For a start it's not a very attractively produced book.
My command of German is reasonably good so I am able, to a certain extent, to assess the quality of the translation.
Although MacIntyre valiantly tries to respect the sonnets' rhyming scheme the overall effort strikes me as outright pedestrian.
But the most grating are the translator's notes.
One wonders why MacIntyre took pains to translate all this drivel.
I started off thinking that this collection of sonnets paled in comparison to the Duino Elegies, but reading the last nine poems this morning really drove the entire point home.
I even came in late to work because I got so into it and had to finish reading the whole thing this morning.
I read the same two translations in this companion to the Elegies: Snow and Young, with reference to the notes of Leishman.
Snow is definitely the better reading experience, but Young has his moments with certain phrases and is generally clearer.
