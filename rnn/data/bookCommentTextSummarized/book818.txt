Every operant concept employed by Kant is well and clearly defined--partly a consequence of his intellectual rigor, partly of the fact that he virtually had to invent a philosophical German as he went along.
Because of this and because of the importance of the Germans in the intellectual history of the West, Kant basically set the agenda for subsequent work.
He is one of the narrow points through which the currents of philosophy pass.One cannot read Kant's major works cold.
Single pages still took up to an hour, but now I had Smith to help me through it chapter by chapter, page by page, paragraph by paragraph, sentence by sentence, word by word.
Abandoned about 150 pages in.
I used it as an accompaniment to my first reading of the CPR, and I would personally recommend against using it for that purpose.
While some parts were definitely helpful (such as the section providing historical/philosophical context), there is a lot of cross-referencing and extensive problematisation, which, legitimate or not, tends to leave one hanging on the details.
Moreover, it is difficult to assess the plausibility of Smith's interpretations without having a tentative understanding of the whole.I am well aware that the text is a commentary, not a reader's guide, so this is of course not a criticism of the book as such.
