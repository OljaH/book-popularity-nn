This was one of my favorites of the series and so was the original of this book. I do have to mention that the picture related to this book is not right and belongs to the Talking Fox Mystery. Also, not a paperback.
It's also a glimpse at a time in which social services or the attitudes towards them were a bit different, which is why the Bobbseys don't seem to have too much trouble deciding to keep the foundling left on their stoop one rainy evening.
There is still charm within the older Bobbsey books, and - as my parents did with me - those glimpse of older attitudes and older times can be turned into great teaching moments for younger kids about U.S. history.
I read every Bobbsey Twins adventures I could get my hands on from the age of 9 through 11. Summers were wonderful and I could borrow from the library and read these books. I could borrow 8 books every 2 weeks. Soon, I needed more than that and had to fight the librarian for more books. Now, I can do 8 books in a day. Sigh.
