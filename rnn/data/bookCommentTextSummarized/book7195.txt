By taking the surface "trash" (his term for organic plant material) and burying it too deeply below the active decomposition layer just under the surface it creates an impermeable barrier to the normal capillarity of soil, creating both parched and flooded conditions that eventually kill the soil's organic community.
However, per Faulkner, disking is fine, since it helps work the organic material just far enough in to feed and make use of the soil fauna that create hummus and help release soil minerals and make them available to plant roots.I recommend this slim, persuasive, now rather-outdated volume to anyone interested in the history behind some of the current debates on sustainable agricultural practices.
Given that it was written years ago based on his work in the 1930s, it was interesting. But, after a third of it, it was soooo boring.
Not interested in agriculture, but what I took from this book is always question everything. Just because someone has been doing it one way for ages doesn't mean it's the right way or the best way by any means.
75 years later farmers are still using the plow I don,t understand after all these years, and all the research that proves plowing is destroying our soil it continues. Very sad.
