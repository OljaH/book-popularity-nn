That every day life, if seen from a certain perspective, can provide the conflict for a compelling novel.
Absolute garbage. Easily the worst book I’ve read in 2008, and certainly a contender for Worst Book I’ve Ever Read. This crap won the prestigious Whitbread Book of the Year honors, and while I have absolutely no idea what that entails, I firmly support both the eradication of this farcical award and the crucifixion of anyone on the selection committee that nominated this stinking smegma. I’d seen this book prominently featured at many shops (mayhap Oprah was currently endorsing it as worthy fare
This is about the third time I’ve gone camping and brought some utter crap along, only to wish I had anything else, hell, I’d have started reading the damn bible if it meant forsaking “The Curious Incident..”	Much less, during this ill-fated camping trip, the Midwest was being absolutely hammered with inclement weather of all sorts.
Thus begins the part of the review that I’m assuming will prompt the parents of autistic people worldwide to recommend I go fuck myself, to which I’ll just let them know right now that if I could, I wouldn’t be dicking around on goodreads.
He prefers prime numbers and will number his chapters in sequential primes - hence, by the end of the book, you're reading chapter 123,314,124 or whatever (I ain't no math guy ;)Now then, he also writes about other things in his life and through his perspective you get some tear-jerking moments of true, unobstructed humanity: the way his parents broke up because of his state, how he has all these dreams about being someone great and going to a top college, even though you know that his situation will never really allow it.
pooƃ ʎɹǝʌ ʇou puɐ ʎʞɔıɯɯıƃ ʎɹǝʌ sı ʞooq sıɥʇif you want to read an excellent book about autism in a young person, read marcelo in the real world. this book is like hilary swank - you can tell it is trying really hard to win all the awards but it has no heart inside. and yet everyone eats it up. C0ME ON!!no one likes gimmicks.come to my blog!
This is the most disassociating book I've ever read. Try to read it all in one sitting -- it will totally fuck with your head and make you forget how to be normal.
She had never been in the place before, but after standing in the doorway for three or four seconds, she walked immediately to the correct aisle and bin and picked out the desired CD without any hesitation.I have a theory, probably rubbish, that autistic people perceive the world as it actually is or, more precisely, within strictly limited categories that might be called ‘natural’, somewhat in the vein of Kantian transcendentals - space, time, numbers, etc.
In my experience autistic people tend to become upset when non-autistic people attempt to reverse the priority by making things subservient to words.
Ultimately, perhaps, autistic people are the conscience of the world.
Here's what I liked about this book:1.
I found Christopher, with all his many quirks, to be sweet and rather endearing.2.
I thought it was a creative idea to write a book from the point of view of a boy with Asperger syndrome.
I enjoyed Christopher's musings about life and the way in which he sees it.4.
I love making lists.Here's what I didn't like about this book:1.
As much as I love making lists (see above), the list thing got the slightest bit annoying after awhile.Overall, a poignant story about a young, brave autistic boy trying to make sense of and find his place in this very complicated world.
I'm not sure what I was expecting but it wasn't this book. I couldn't decide to give 3 or 4 stars so I'm going with 3 because I liked it and 3 is my mid point 😊I loved the lay-out of the book and the little pictures. I must admit the maths went right over my head!!! I love that Christopher went on a hunt for the evil killer. I wanted that killer to be forked too!!!Overall, it's a good quick read. I finished before bed last night. Happy Reading! Mel ❤️
Christopher's feelings about metaphors are highly pertinent to a very different book, China Mieville's wonderful "Embassytown" (http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/...), which is about how minds shape language and how language shapes minds, and focuses on the relationship between similes, truth and lies.Many novels are about uncovering what is true, but Christopher's quest takes the idea to a deeper level, and even though we know this narrator is almost pathologically truthful, his condition means his observations sometimes miss the real truth of a situation.There is plenty of humour, and it usually arises from Christopher's naive misunderstandings of situations and the conflict between his lack of embarrassment and desire to be unnoticed by unfamiliar people.Logic and TruthChristopher loves maths because it is safe, straightforward and has a definite answer, unlike life.
2nd Read | October 2018Ok wow it's been 5 years since I read this and I wanted to reread desperately! I also heard it was actually problematic with the autism rep and at the time of reading I...had no idea of anything about autism...orrrrr that I was actually autistic myself. The things YOU FIND OUT LATER. \_(ツ)_/ So hello, dear reread, time to be critical.I still love it! I don't think the autism rep is perfect, but I don't think it's terrible either?! I know it's all pitched as asperger's synd
But I love that it didn't end up with Christopher getting "better" or stopping doing anything autistic.
I take my hat off to the author, because it’s not easy to write a book like this, PLUS make the reader empathize with everyone, PLUS write an unforgettable story, PLUS kill a dog, PLUS solve a mysteries, PLUS leave it with such an unfinished ending that I am sitting here writing a review and gnashing my teeth from the combination of sheer awesomeness and feelings of unsatisfactory sadness.
The concept is interesting: narrating the novel through the POV of an autistic boy.
is not a mystery in any way, shape or form and because of this, the autistic POV begins to wear thin by the second half of the novel remaining sometimes fascinating yet sometimes tedious.
From that point, the second half of the novel hugely focuses on Christopher attempting to travel to London by himself.
I won't tell who the murderer is or why Christopher takes off to London, as these are the only two real surprises of the novel.

Fate is kind, but there is nothing more disturbing than learning that you possess so many of those qualities that categorize people as "special needs." I mean, shit.
Yep. Getting lost in London Underground?
Yep. Getting ridiculously sidetracked during storytelling?
And it wasn't so bothersome at first, but as I read on, I grew to empathize with this kid so much so, that I felt like a fucking crazy person.
Christopher likes maths.
I remember when I used to like maths.
Christopher has a pet rat.
I remember when I used to have a pet rat.
Pet rats are fun!3.
A heartwarming story told from the vantage point of an autistic boy.
I'm a professional woman who adores literature and loves to read.
I bought this book because I was told that it was GREAT by a couple of friends.
This from someone who can devour a book in twelve hours (including "masterpieces" such as Memoirs of a Geisha, Jane Eyre and Pride and Prejudice....loved them all).
I didn't find it "lyrical" I didn't find the writing in ANY way "superior" to some of the "genre" authors I read (Nora Roberts anyone?).
I'll stick with my "silly" genre novels ANY day of the week.
The book is from the viewpoint of an teen boy with Asperger's syndrome named Christopher - his mom has recently died and he discovers a dead dog in one of his neighbor’s yards.
Except that no one wants to tell him anything about the dog except the kindly, lonely old Mrs. Alexander, who finally breaks it to the boy that his mom was cheating on his dad.
The crux of the story isn’t about the dog, it’s what the dad keeps from Christopher “until he gets old enough to understand”.
19. The curious Incident of the dog in the Night-Time, Mark HaddonThe novel is narrated in the first-person perspective by Christopher John Francis Boone, a 15-year-old boy who describes himself as "a mathematician with some behavioural difficulties" living in Swindon, Wiltshire. Although Christopher's condition is not stated, the book's blurb refers to Asperger syndrome, high-functioning autism, or savant syndrome. In July 2009, Haddon wrote on his blog that "Curious Incident is not a book abou
In July 2009, Haddon wrote on his blog that "Curious Incident is not a book about Asperger's....if anything it's a novel about difference, about being an outsider, about seeing the world in a surprising and revealing way.
داستان از زبان کریستوفر بون که پسری مبتلا به اوتیسم است، روایت و بیان می‌شود، و از همین روست که لحن ویژه و بیمانندی دارد.
This is the story of Christopher Boone, a very likable 15 year old who suffers from Asperger Syndrome, a type of higher functioning Autism. Christopher sets out to solve a mystery; who killed Wellington, his neighbors dog, something he wants very much to do because he is accused of committing the crime. Christopher’s detective work helps him solve some other mysteries along the way, one that is much more important than who killed Wellington.
I kept asking myself this question : does this book really do justice to autistic children ?
No way!A long time ago, I read a memoir written by a girl who has autism, and I really loved it.
It was not a light read, and it left me emotionally drained, as if her life-story was about my own child.
In comparison with that book, The Curious Incident was rather a light read that didn't get me emotionally involved.
Well this review assured me that it's okay to write a negative review for this book, although I didn't hate the book, it only left me feeling cold.
I really enjoyed this short novel.I've said this numerous times in my other reviews that I like character driven novels.
It's not the best book on autism, but it's a short preview of it.
I honestly don't like reading huge novels during the school year.
Stress from the university is not something I could control, so reading shorter novels help me unwind at times.
Aside from being short, it was also really entertaining.Like I said, it's not a novel that everyone's going to love, but I'd recommend taking the risk and find out for yourself.

What a beautiful story! The main character, Christopher, is delightful. A big ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ star read from me! I highly recommend this book to everyone! ☺

That almost half of the book is about the London trip when Christopher goes to see his estranged mother, and maybe that's a little too long; it makes the story into a kind of movie thriller of sorts, when the heart of the book for me is about mysteries, a dog murdered and just what that means for Christopher and his family, relationships, love, the grief and despair of dealing with a kid with special needs, that heartbreak, all stuff I have been through.
This was a truly amazing story told from the point of view of Christopher, an autist boy.
Right from the beginning, you are being thrown into this mystery story - which is not really a mystery story but a story about Christopher's life and struggles.
This book comes with surprises and I loved that.
I think I should've seen them coming but I didn't.
Christopher kind of reminded me of Don from "The Rosie Project" by Graeme Simsion.
So if you've read and liked that book, there's a chance you will like "The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Nighttime" as well :)
To understand how he thinks compared to those of us not autistic is mind opening and thought provoking.
This wonderful mystery is told by Christopher who sets out to solve the murder of Wellington, the neighbor's dog.
Christopher has a difficult time socializing as he can't pick up on nuances or cues like other people.
He says what he thinks without having the skill set to understand how others will react which gets him into difficult situations.
From a personal perspective, my 23 year old son with Asperger's often says to me, "Mom my brain doesn't think like yours".
He would have to come out of his comfort zone in order to carry out his investigations, and even tries to find loop holes in his father’s strict orders to stop his sleuthing.Christopher’s investigation would eventually reveal some astonishing secrets about his family and to borrow the clichéd expression -  his whole world would turn upside down  and Christopher would do the unexpected.Another thing which I liked about the book – •	the references to a couple of mathematical problems especially The Monty Hall Problem•	the problem around the properties of right angled triangle 	- these reminded of me of my school days when I did love certain branches of Maths like algebra and geometryI also liked that The Hound of Baskervilles is Christopher’s favourite book (it is my favourite novel in the Sherlockian world too) but  A WORD OF CAUTION!!!
Another member on Goodreads told me to read this book - I meant to, but didn't until she got annoyed with me for taking so long and sent me a copy.
It is a remarkable book - the only thing I can think that is similar to it is perhaps that short story, Flowers for Algernon.
This book has so many resonances for me that when I get old and dotty I may even think that I wrote it.
It is a beautifully written story that is moving without playing any cheap games with you as a reader.Look, it is a delight.
My older son is autistic spectrum, so this was a must-read. But even if you don't know any autistic people, it's a great novel. The central character is engaging and totally credible. Funny how it's suddenly become cool to be autistic... Lisbeth Salander from  Män som hatar kvinnor is the latest and most extreme example. What does that say about our society? Have we been too respectful of people whose main ability is to manipulate the emotions of others, and are we now thinking better of it?
This one of the editorial acquisitions I'm most proud of... I've bought rights for this novel while it was still in manuscript, before first publication and much before all the awards it received later... Also, I had the pleasure of meeting Mark Haddon twice... His a great author and very nice person and has good memory :) Unfortunately, he didn't sell well in Serbia... I changed him a publisher but with no better results...Due to bad sales he won't be translated into Serbian, most probably :(
He was educated at Uppingham School and Merton College, Oxford, where he studied English.In 2003, Haddon won the Whitbread Book of the Year Award and in 2004, the Commonwealth Writers' Prize Overall Best First Book for his novel The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time, a book which is written from the perspective of a boy with Aspergers syndrome.
