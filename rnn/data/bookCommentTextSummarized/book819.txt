The great fellow poet/art critic Max Jacob encouraged Reverdy to write this book, but at the same time, one gather by this text that their relationship had sharp turns to the left and right, when it wanted to go straight ahead.
Maybe because it is due that Dylan just won the Nobel Prize for literature, but I couldn't help thinking about his work, while reading this book.
Dylan is known for 'borrowing' text for his songs/writings, and one wonder if he knew Reverdy's work.
This, almost reads like a Dylan book written in the future.
Like Dylan, Reverdy is very cinematic with his writing.
The poetic novel Le voleur du Talan was published in 1917 and subsequently remained out of print until 1967.
It is typical of Pierre Reverdy's poetry - intense sentences that encapsulate the emotion of the poet as he lives his life.
There is no story but a mood of unsettledness, melancholy, observation and regret.
Reverdy is a hard poet to translate in that his words are so basic yet summon up a world that is quite personal: private and remote.
Ian Seed has done a remarkable job in translating this work into English which (even in France) is very much neglected and little known.
A novella length prose poem which clears a more tender path between Surrealism and its past than the usual scorched earth of Dada.All roads lead to Guillaume Apollinaire.
I was hoping for more from this one.
