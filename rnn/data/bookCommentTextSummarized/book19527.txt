ثلاثة عشر هو رقم ليس سيئا أبدا لى و ان كان غير محبب للكثيرينو لكنى أحببته هنا لأنه عدد القصص في هذه 
Τα υπόλοιπα ακόμη αναρωτιέμαι τι ακριβώς σκοπό εξυπηρετούν και όταν καταφέρω να βρω απαντήσεις καμία δεν ανταποκρίνεται στο είδος αυτού του βιβλίου.
Τα υπόλοιπα διηγήματα που πέρασαν αδιάφορα θα μπορούσαν να ειναι απλώς κάποιες ενδιαφέρουσες ιστορίες που απέχουν παρασάγγας από ιστορίες ψυχολογικής έντασης ή ακόμη περισσότερο τρόμου.
Οταν έχεις διαβάσει το "σκοτάδι βαθύ δίχως άστρα" που και πάλι δεν ήταν συνταρακτικό αλλά οπωσδηποτε κάποιες ιστορίες δεν τις ξεχνάς ποτε, τότε το " ιστορίες του λυκόφωτος" παρά τον βαρύγδουπο και πολλα υποσχόμενο τίτλο, ειναι πολύ ...συνηθισμένο και απλό σε σημείο να μην κάνει εντύπωση.
Παράξενο το σκεπτικό του συγγραφέα και αρκετά γοητευτικό και πολύπλευρο με ειδικό ταλέντο σε ολες τις ΙΨΔ, δεν κατάφερε να με συναρπάσει στο μεγαλύτερο μέρος του βιβλίου.
His Kingship picked a good tale to start the collection with.Gingerbread Girl:  After leaving her husband, Emily takes up running on the beach.
Serial killers have been done to death but King makes a good tale out of it.Harvey's Dream:  A woman in a boring marriage is surprised when her husband wants to share a dream of his with her.This one felt like a well-written Twilight Zone episode to me.
But was the man really deaf?This confessional tale was pretty good.
King likes his shorts Twilight Zone-ish, doesn't he?Ayana:  This was a tale about miracles.
This was kinda hit and miss for me.
I'm not a true fan of short stories so maybe that's what it is.
I mean dang..it's Stephen King.The ones I did like:The Gingerbread Girl- A woman runner tangles with a very bad man.
Harvey's Dream-short but chilling..thinking that dreams do come true.
Rest Stop-I know this one has been done before but I liked it.
Then in the final chapter when King explains his reasons behind the story it made me like this one even more.
Sucky ones:The other seven stories.
The one about poop..I couldn't even finish.
I just couldn't take it.
In that regard, Stephen King is my favorite band.One of my earliest memories tied to this collection (other than watching “The Cat from Hell” in “Tales from the Darkside: The Movie”, but we’ll get to that) is from 2004.
Braunbeck’s story about recovering and rebuilding the face of God, “Rami Temporalis”, is a great little ditty, too.While King is not without his faults (I’m looking at you “Dreamcatcher” and “From a Buick Eight”), I feel this collection is among his best work.
“The Cat from Hell” was first released in Cavalier, during King’s years submitting to men’s magazines, and then filmed as part of the nostalgia-inducing, probably-not-as-good-as-I-remember “Tales from the Darkside: The Movie”.
Totally.
For the last novel with any ounce of originality still left in it by Stephen King was surely the serial-then-(underrated)novel "The Green Mile." And now?
This is a total miss for me, for I pretty much KNOW, am certain that the writer actually manages to flourish in the short story department.
(There are more, if not an equal number of, movies based on Stephen King short stories than on his novels.)So for a vastly better collection of short stories, in the new and sad age of King-imitating-King, just do yourself a favor & choose "Everything's Eventual" instead.
This is probably one of Stephen King's most hard-hitting collections of all time. Just After Sunset is very dark, darker than most of King's material, mainly because it deals with reality just a bit more than usual and brings out deeper characters.
A guy trying to lose weight spends hours on a stationary bike and literally goes into another world.Graduation Afternoon A short short, about a townie girl dating one of the wealthy summer tourists, and a King twist at the end.The Things They Left Behind Every American writer in the 21st century has to write a 9/11 story at some point, and this is King's.N. King always has to give a nod to Lovecraft, and this is this collection's "unspeakable horror from between worlds" story.The New York Times at Special Bargain Rates is a brief, eerie tale about a woman who receives a phone call from her husband, who died two days ago.Mute A man unburdens himself about his marital woes to a deaf-mute hitchhiker, with disastrous results.The Cat From Hell A hit man accepts a contract on...
كل ذلك على الرغم من أن هذا النوع من القصص أمقته بحق ولكن السرد كان حقا رائعا، وعلى الرغم أيضا من أن الترجمة لم تكن بالمستوى المطلوب.ولكن ستيفن سردك حقا يستحق الثناء، لا أستطيع الإنتظار حتى أبدأ في القصة القادمةالدرس المستفاد من الرواية:المِحن في الحياة تأتي لتعلمنا كيف نكون أقوى وأقوم، تماما كما في الرواية، عندما فقدت إميلي إبنتها شرعت في أن تركض، لا لشئ سوى أنها يجب أن تركض، شئ ما في داخلها أخبرها ان بذلك حل لمشكلاتها، لم تعلم أنه بالفعل سيكون كذلك ولكن ليس لموت إبنتها، إنما لما هو قادم والذي لم يكن أبدا في الحسبان.يحضرني في هذا الدرس الآية الكريمة، قال الله تعالى: " إِذْ تُصْعِدُونَ وَلاَ تَلْوُونَ عَلَى أحَدٍ وَالرَّسُولُ يَدْعُوكُمْ فِي أُخْرَاكُمْ فَأَثَابَكُمْ غُمَّاً بِغَمٍّ لِّكَيْلاَ تَحْزَنُواْ عَلَى مَا فَاتَكُمْ وَلاَ مَا أَصَابَكُمْ وَاللَّهُ خَبِيرٌ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ "فإن الله قد يثيب الإنسان بغمِ فينسيه الغم السابق، وانما هي لرحمة الله بنا، وهو ما رأيت أننا في معظم الوقت نمر به، حتى نقول ان الأمور السيئة تأتي معا، والحقيقة انها رحمة بنا كي تهون بعضها بعضا.
I also feel like you should go into short stories blind, therefore I really don't want to say too much in terms of plot.First up - Willa.
I don't want to spoil the "twist" in the story, so I feel like I can't say much, but this short story was just "blah" to me.
I feel like it's one that I'll forget pretty quickly - it just didn't leave a lasting impression on me.The Gingerbread Girl - this was a highlight within this collection.
I went to bed that night feeling generally unsettled and couldn't stop thinking about it - that's what I want from my horror stories!
I found that for some of the stories there was a been-there-done-that feel.
In another, my favorite in the collection, a nuclear bomb in NYC tale, I felt as if King had been peeking in at dreams I have had myself.
His 9/11 story had a very welcome gentle touch.
P. Lovecraft, particularly given the name King assigns to his demon, Cthun, calling to mind Lovecraft’s “The Call of Cthulu,” but in the afterward, where he tells of his inspirations for each story, Lovecraft is not mentioned.
I enjoyed that several tales were set in NYC.
King has reached a sort of steady state.
And this book once again proves that he's one of the top dogs of the short fiction format.This might actually be one of my favorite Stephen King short story collections (and yes I've pretty much read all of them)!
This is his collection with the strongest, most cohesive themes connecting each story.
"The Cat from Hell" reads like something that would have been right at home in his first collection, Night Shift, and the most popular work from the collection: the fabulous novella "N.", is a creepy tale of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder told in the intriguing epistolary format that ultimately takes a Lovecraftian turn.
Really enjoyed the dark tales of this collection, featuring some really graphic scenes that will stay with me and exploration of mental illness/grief in a fantastical way.
Moody tale featuring an out of luck salesman, a priest in a confession box and a deaf hitchhiker this was fantastic.A Tight Place – This was a literal SHIT STORM!!!These are my favorites from the collection the others weren’t so memorable or impactful but overall this was a solid one can’t wait to try out his other collections.
From Evil Cats to A literal shit storm 😂 I had so much fun with this collection...
Some of the stories in this book are excellent whereas some are not that good and some are just a waste of time.
Stephen King explores the deep and dark corners of one's mind in these 13 unusual stories.
My favourite one is story #8: 'N.' It's really creepy and I totally freaked out.
This is also a nice short story with strong narrative.
I hate to say this, but reading 'Harvey's Dream' and 'Graduation Afternoon' is a waste of time.
If you wanna save your time, you can totally omit these two stories.
By far my least favourite short story collection by King, so far.
Largely forgettable.
I finished this about a week ago and gave myself time to absorb the material.
A week later, the only story I remember anything about was N.
N. was a terrific short story (I've also read the graphic novel by the same name) and it was well written.
The other stories fell flat, and didn't do much to entertain.
In fact, I felt like King wasn't in his usual language groove; the writing just didn't flow like it normally does for him.
Most of the short stories were profound and even heartbreaking, but one of them was ewww. Like what was he thinking ewww. Eww . Eww. Eww.King often says he writes about his nightmares and writes to tackle and overcome what frightens him. No wonder, you can see why. After all, emptying out all the ugliness can be quite cathartic.Monolith stones one was my favorite in this collection.
There are lots of authors I read, but few that I am as eager to consume as any new work by King (Elizabeth George is a close second).
The story doesn't say or really imply that it's related to any of the crashes of 9/11, but it's hard not to read that into any story about a plane crash after that fateful day.As always, the strength of King's stories is their grounding in reality with strong characters reacting in authentic ways to bizarre and supernatural circumstances.
These stories are about death--as is a lot of King's work--and how we react to it.Will we be like "The Gingerbread Girl" who flees from life in the wake of the death of her child?
بعيد الغروب تمنيت أن أجد في هذه المجموعة بعض قصص الرعب أو قصص ما وراء الطبيعة الجيدة، شيء يعيد لي وهج قراءات المراهقة، عندما كانت تنحبس أنفاسي رعباً أو إثارة، ولكن للأسف بالكاد استطعت قراءة القصتين الأوليين، بالأصح أجبرت نفسي على قراءتهما، ومع الترجمة الرديئة، صار هذا الكتاب مضيعة للوقت لا أكثر.
This is a collection of 13 short stories To be honest not the best of Stephen King I heard a lot of good things about him and starting with this one, not the best choice but I still want to read from him specially after reading Gingerbread Girl story ( it's so good)
Outstanding story, if slightly predictable.2)The Things They Left Behind: This one is not scary in the least.
I recommend this story for everyone, even if they don't like Stephen King.3)The Gingerbread Girl: I loved the way he portrayed a strong, fit, smart, capable woman fighting back every step of the way.4)Stationary Bike: I listened to this on audio a while back when that was the only way it was available.
EXCEPT: Do NOT read the very last story in the book.
That story is the only thing written by Stephen King that I've ever started and not finished.
Just After Sunset is Stephen King's latest collection of short stories, containing a hodge podge of different tales that with one exception had been previously published in various magazines or anthologies.
I've liked Stephen King's similar works in the past, despite the fact that some of his so-called short stories have clocked in at novella or even full novel length.
Unfortunately I didn't care for hardly any of them.What we have here seems to be more like a collection of literary doodles or proof of concepts that just kind of fell out of King's brain.
Here is why : A good life must be like a good short story.
I found the overall atmosphere of the tale to be good along with the characters but the premise felt not fully explored.
I finished this the fastest even though it was the longest story in the collection.Rest Stop  : Towards the end of the book, in the notes part the author writes of how he could personally associate with this story & his alter ego of Richard Bachman.
The things they left behind  : I have never read a post 9/11 story set in New York before.
يقول الكاتب ان افكار هذه المجموعة القصصية جائته من مشاهد حدثت في حياته،خبر قرأه في جريدة او حادثة سمع بها.معظم قصص المجموعة جيدة،ليست مرعبة بالدرجة الاولي ،لكنها بالتأكيد غريبة جدا وغامضة لدرجة تشعر معها بالجنون.تجربة فريدة ورائعة لأول مجموعة قصصية اقرأها لستيفن كينج رغم شعوري ان بعض هذه القصص كانت تستحق ان تكون روابة طويلة.
3.5This collection of short stories wasn't bad, but for someone who is a master at writing shorts, I don't think this one stacked up well with prior collections by King. Still good...just not great.
Nothing really new - I got thinking of Wood's Palindrome (but I haven't read that for ages, so don't hold me to it - and King's own Rose Madder of course.
OK, the story is a short one and it works.
Probably my least favorite of this collection, still quite readable.The things they left behind - This is creepy, effective and very sad.
- This was a good and creepy one, but I did expect that happening!The cat from hell - Got almost all the way through this before I realized what I was reading.
I love how a lot of what I've read by King so far focuses on very personal horrors.Rest Stop: Kind of bottom of the pack.
I didn't hate it, but neither was I left with any strong feelings toward it.Stationary Bike: Sir King, you are weird as fuck.
This is a positive.The Things They Left Behind: Again, another one that evokes a kind of melancholy spooky sadness.Graduation Afternoon: Forgettable.
It's a shrug.A Very Tight Place: Gross, yet satisfying in all its poo-splattered glory.In all of its gross, weird, sad, scariness Just After Sunset is a strong collection of short stories.
The patient completely identifies with this analogy (or should that be metaphor?) and the crew becomes so real for him that he even paints them.
The title comes from an exercise bike he sets up in the basement – on which he goes for bicycle rides that seem more and more realistic....Another fave was 'N.' A psychiatrist gets drawn into a story told by one of his seemingly OCD patients (N.) who subsequently kills himself.
He decides to investigate N.'s story for his own piece of mind, but then loses it (the piece of mind) by ending up in a similar situation.
Really suspenseful and lots of fun to readHarvey's Dream-1 star-Total waste of time IMORest Stop-1 star-Another story that wasn't worth the time.
It wasn't even interestingStationary Bike-5 stars-Really good and scary.The Things They Left Behind-4 stars-had some unanswered questions and was a little slow paced, but overall a good storyGraduation Afternoon-3 stars-Interesting even though it was pointless and dullN.-4 stars-Really weird and mysterious, but it didn't live up to my expectations.
I hated how we knew exactly what was going to happen and this isn't my type of storyA Very Tight Place-4 stars-slow in the beginning, but you just have to find out what happens and it is worth it
This scrumptious lil' candy box of nasty short story surprises is vintage King, each darkly delicious tale accompanied by a ghost ("Willa"), serial killer ("The Gingerbread Girl") or demonic being ("The Cat from Hell"), and all with a chewy moral center.
I can always count on King to provide me with reliable shivers and disgusted giggles, and as a reader and writer, I always enjoy his folksy explanations at the end of the book about how each story came to be.
Decadent, dirty fun for King fans.
The narrator was very good at getting the right tone that was perfect for the mood of the story.
This is a story that I feel like I’ve read million times before, many of them probably penned by King himself.
This is a bit terrifying!The Things They Left Behind read by Ben ShenkmanThis story takes place post 9/11 and has damn fine narration.
I was hoping things would get much nastier but I’m mean like that.Sunset Notes read by Stephen KingKing pops in at the end of the audio to add his thoughts about his writing process for each story.
