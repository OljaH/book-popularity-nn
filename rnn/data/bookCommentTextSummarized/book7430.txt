The setting is the Massachusetts town of Barnard’s Crossing.When the story opens it is the day before Yom Kippur and Rabbi Small is dealing with several crises.
There are problems with the synagogue's sound system, concerns with floral arrangements, and a member of the congregation questions how much a Torah weighs.
But then Rabbi Small is presented with another problem that is not easily resolved.
His wife is not Jewish but she wants him buried in the synagogue's cemetery and have Rabbi Small conduct the service.
The police have ruled the death an accident so Rabbi Small agrees to conduct the service and internment in the cemetery.
A mathematician is found dead in his car on Yom Kippur and what initially looks like a suicide turns out to be murder. Certain members of his congregation may be implicated and Rabbi David Small is determined to find out who the murderer is. The insight into Jewish philosophy and religious practices was very interesting, but there just wasn’t much “mystery” to it and I’m not sure the characters (including Rabbi Small and his wife) are engaging enough to continue with the series. 2.5 stars, rounded up because I did enjoy it overall.
Meaning even the bad guys were just human nature flaws not the cynical, self centered evil you get in current fiction novels.
None of that flash and bang with constant escalation you get in current fiction.
Meaning the first half reads like a sequential day to day plot, but then the mystery pops up and you have a "Duh!" moment and realize each scene contained a clue about the killer or one of the red herring suspects.
Current books I almost always solve.
This one I didn't figure it out till the Rabbi did!
I'm liking this cozy mystery series so far.
A drunk was found dead of carbon monoxide poisoning in his garage and the police have ruled it an accident.
The insurance investigator, however, would rather prove it was suicide so they wouldn't have to pay.
After discussing it with Rabbi David Small, all three conclude that they must determine whether or not it was murder.Despite the slow pace of this series, I find myself enjoying it.
I've learned a bit about the Jewish faith from it, and it's been interesting.
I'll definitely continue with the series.
I reread them every few years to remind myself how Rabbi Small gets into trouble with his congregation and how he get himself out again.In this case the dispute is over whether a Jewish non-member of his congregation should be buried in the small Jewish cemetery.
If a suicide, he should be buried outside the cemetery.
Small has already ruled that he may be buried there.In order to put his mind at rest, Rabbi Small looks more deeply into the man's death.
The more he looks, the less he likes what he finds.
This only took a few days to read and it was interesting to learn about Jewish philosophy and how they view the world. I felt a better title would be "Rabbi Knows Best" since the Rabbi turns out to be a super sleuth. This book was recommended by my brother David, and so this comment is directed to him: where the heck did you find this? I liked the book, but I was just kinda perplexed how you came to read a 1960's Jewish Murder-Mystery. Kinda obscure...
"Saturday the Rabbi Went Hungry" is book 2 of the Rabbi Small Mysteries.
In this story, Rabbi Small is asked to perform a funeral over a Jewish man who died under suspicious circumstances..
This might cause problems burying him in the Jewish cemetery since traditionally, suicides were buried at the edge of the synagogue separated from the others.
After an investigation, Rabbi Small decides that it was NOT a suicide, but a big donor to the synagogue objects and the conflict begins.
Like any good author or cinematographer, Kemelman presents his characters and the locale as a pastiche of several individuals and locations, but as he lived in this town for close to 50 years, Marblehead is undoubtedly the fount of most of his inspiration; the source of his observations of human life in a small Yankee town suddenly settled by a considerable Jewish population.
If you know or want to know a New England town with its various characters, pressures, and patterns, if you want to read an enjoyable story with a Jewish background, then be sure to read this book.
I was fascinated by some of the insights into the practice of the Jewish faith, and liked the sort of socially inept Rabbi Small.
In fact, it had the same sort of tone and charm that Jan Karon's Mitford series, with a side of murder.
He was a darkhorse suspect in the murder, but I feel quite certain it was just the author's way to write about an ongoing relevant social issue....
I'm not sure that I'll continue with the series, based on this one.
This is the 2nd Rabbi Small mystery and it is just as much fun as the 1st. I guess you could consider it a cozy mystery? Nothing really awful seems to happen in them, well, except for the dead person, but they don’t seem especially gruesome. Also, I love the lessons about Judaism. And I love Rabbi Small and his wife, Miriam.
The second book int eh Rabbi Small mystery series.
Don't get me wrong, this book doesn't disappoint and delivers on the twist at the end when the reader is finally told "who-dun-it".
My only issue with this book is that it was a slow start.
The first half of the book rather drags on is full of congregational politics.
Once the book picks up, you can't put it down.
I will defiantly continue in my reading of the entire series...I just hope the rest don't use the entire first half of the book as "filler".
Now on to the third one in the series..."Sunday The Rabbi Stayed Home".
Was it suicide?? and should the Rabbi have buried him in the Jewish cemetery?? are the key questions in this mystery. I like Rabbi Small and his reluctant but intellectual style. Thank goodness he has such a practical wife. This series is turning out to be very good, the formula stays the same but the theology is new and keeps it interesting.
A pleasant read. These first two books are very short, set close together in time, and have the same characters, so that they read together like one average-sized novel.
This was interesting and short. I learned quite a bit about Judaism. Interesting mystery, not entirely predictable. Nice read.
The young rabbi is a superbly revealed character who excels this time in detection by Talmudic logic, a form of hairsplitting argument and deduction called pilpul.
He continues to excel in portraying suburban synagogue politics and the struggle to deal with prejudices and orthodox religious views.This is a rich and intoxicating series which has been critically acclaimed through the ages and has been published in dozens of languages.
Rabbi David Small is an outstanding character and so is the close, affectionate portrayal of his little community.This is a must read series for sure.
After the introduction to the Rabbi and the Chief of Police in the first book in the series, I was pleased to see the relationship carry through in this story.
Similar to the first book, the crime that is being investigated is somewhat hard to fathom due to the omission of information that would allow the reader to better understand how the resolution is reached by the Rabbi.
I gained additional knowledge about the Jewish faith as I did in the first book which makes the read even better.
The foreword for this edition was written later, and the author revealed that he was inspired by his experiences in moving to a town similar to Barnard's Crossing (I googled a bit, and it appears that he moved to Marblehead with his wife).
In this town, a few Jews had decided to establish a synagogue, and there were some disagreements among the members, as there are in the book series.
The author is not himself a rabbi (contrary to what I thought), but he is good at conveying various aspects of his religion.
I didn’t enjoy this second Rabbi Small book as much as the first; the mystery itself was kind of boring, and there was a sort of complicated subplot about the temple cemetery which also wasn’t very interesting.
Rabbi Small also still spends a lot of time pontificating about Jewish law, sometimes to his poor wife, which seems odd - wouldn’t she know?
It made more sense when he did it in the first book with the Catholic police chief.
Anyway, there was still enough in the book to make me keep reading, but I hope the next one is better.
The problem with these books is the same problem that many books from the same era face. There is racism, class discrimination, sexism and comments about alcoholism that are not progressive. The way a widow is described by a police officer is cringe worthy. There are few female characters and we rarely see two women talking together. The mystery, however, is interesting and it wasn't obvious who the murderer was. But once the murderer was revealed, it made a lot of sense and you could see the threads that the author had woven in to give readers clues.
I think this is my favorite Rabbi mystery - a bit slow at the beginning, it has the usual discussions of jewish custom and law that I like, and a controversy between Rabbi Small and the board as usual, which I don't care for as much - but near the end, when the Rabbi tells the chief of police who the murderer is - in an understated way - I realized how brilliantly the book was constructed and how a multitude of clues were contained in several minor episodes all coming together perfectly. A very satisfying read.
I had seen this series on book store shelves for a long time so I thought I would try it out. As you can imagine a lot of the story is taken up with the descriptions of Jewish life and Jewish law. The murder mystery is interwoven through this and the main character, Rabbi Small, really doesn't do any detective work. Rather, he comes up with insights. Good and easy read but it had some gaps in the story telling and timeline and dialog.
While this book was entertaining and added to my knowledge about Judaism, I felt the conversations between Rabbi Small and his wife were awkward and created only for Talmudic explanation. I hope in future books in this series the reader gets s sense of the why these two got married even though I know it is expected that Jewish men marry.
This is the second time I've read this book. At one time, I read all of the books in this Rabbi series. I love books that educate me, and these Rabbi books do just that. Along with the gentle murder (off camera) I learn so much about the Orthodox Jewish religion. Kemelman is definitely a scholar and a good writer.
This has become almost a period piece, with life in the 1970s. The mystery is discovered and solved mostly by chance. As usual the most interesting part is the Rabbi's relationship to his congregation.
Didn't love it. I think I remember that my father liked this series but that was many years ago. Maybe it's dated. It was slow. I guess also it has a lot of mention of jewish ritual and tradition in a whodunit context, which is kind of interesting.
Loved it! A fabulous mystery, well written and thought out. Love, love, love the Jewish insights and references. My family is not Jewish, but perhaps our ancestors might have been at one point, since several of the words are common in our household. A very fun read.
Some interesting insights into conservative mid 20th century Jewish communities and practices but it can come across as didactic at times and the crime genre aspect seems shoe horned in, with very little investigation and a very rushed ending.
A Weekend With the RabbiMy Rating System:* couldn't finish, ** wouldn't recommend, *** would recommend, **** would read again, ***** have read again.
Another great book in the series. Kemelman has a way of not giving away the ending, it totally sneaks up on you. It's also great to learn more about the Jewish faith during Yom Kippur.
Much appreciation for this book series as a look into the past & unique characters.
