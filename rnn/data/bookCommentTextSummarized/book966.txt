I enjoyed this book very much. A good romantic western.
Very good story. It keeps your interest throughout the book. An animal lover's book. Actually listen to it as an audible book.
If you like Westerns, you'll like Max Brand. Alcatraz is a wild horse and Brand alternates the narrative between the people struggling to hold onto a ranch and the horse as he breaks from a cruel master and learns to survive on the plains. I plan to read more of his many novels, and I'm not a big fan of Westerns. I do like his perspective.
This book had ups and downs.
This book however deals with the trust of men and their animals really.
His escape comes at a terrible price though as he becomes known as a murderous beast and Marianne the new ranch owner wants him killed, but Alcatraz is a smart, tough an seems to be a magical horse, able to mystify his hunters that are unable to catch him.
Marianne calls in the only man that can catch him Red Jim Perris, and at this point (nearly halfway through the book) is when the story picks up, nothing is straightforward in this book, the scenes with action are written quite well though.
It's been a long time since I've read a horse story that was so good. He understands horses & portrays them as individuals shaped by breed and the environment in which they were raised. His descriptions makes one feel like they are seeing & experiencing the horses first hand. Plus, he developed his human characters in a manner that you cheer for the heros & despise the villians. Definitely recommend this book to any horse lover!
Wonderful...he captures the spirit of horse and man both....the ideal spirit that these days is so rarely in evidence.
this is about a horse - not the prison. but I read it an enjoyed it
