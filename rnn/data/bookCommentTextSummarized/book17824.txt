Time to meet Will, the Beautiful Player.These books just seem to get better and better, I thought I no one would ever beat the man that tore panties and hoarded them for his own perverted collection.
But that is all about to change when he reunites with Hanna, little sister to his college friend.We’ve had a book and a novella to get to know Will a bit, and I can’t even begin to express how much I wanted him to have his own book after Beautiful Stranger and getting some more of his personality in Beautiful Bombshell.
*****FIVE STARS*****{BR with my Lovely Alice} I had heard from a few friends that this one was their favorite in the series. I didn't think it could be possible after meeting Max Stella in "Beautiful Stranger", because I have a major weakness for British men!! Holy Crap, I LOVED THIS BOOK HARD!!!!!!! I can't stop thinking about it. I fell absolutely head over heels in love with Mr Will Sumner. Get a load of that name!! Even the name is god damn SEXY AS HELL!!!!!I now understand why my lovely bud
Even the name is god damn SEXY AS HELL!!!!!I now understand why my lovely buddy reader, Alice, was reading this for the second time.
So Jensen tells her she should reach out to Will and have him help her to get out there and socialize.So we know that these two are going to have sparks flying between them and I could definitely feel them the moment they meet up in Central Park for a run.
There were moments I wanted to do the same to Will but holy hell he would say the most amazing things to Hanna, that just had me swooning!!
4 ZIGGY STARS.Hello readers, welcome to 'Beautiful player' a story of falling in love, friends to more and I can't stop thinking about getting you into bed.
'Beautiful player' follows the story of Hanna and Will and finding themselves amongst the possibility of love.What did I love?This book delivered on the dialogue front, it was fresh, amusing and sexy.
This characters honest conversations and shocking thoughts made this ordinary love story into a hilarious portrayal of a gorgeously addictive character, Hanna was utterly lovely I really connected with her quirky, original ways and I'm glad the authors created such a loveable heroine for the delectable Will.
5 Player Stars.  Hanna decided that she needed to be a little “sexier” and more confident in bed, so she asks for the help of Will, the biggest player and sexy guy she knows. They know each other since childhood and it seems to be the perfect plan.

Where can I even meet someone like you?It's been a while since I've read Beautiful Stranger but the feels are still here so when Beautiful Player called my attention the other day, I didn't resist it because I know I'm in for fun, sexy times.
Will and Hanna's chemistry was on-point and it didn't help the fact that both characters are one helluva fun to read about.
I loved that their sexy times transitioned to something more in the later chapters because for me, it was so believable and realistic.I think this is the best book I've read in this series so far.
*3.75 ~ 4 Stars* ”Seeing her face was – strangely – like being home again, but also like meeting a beautiful girl for the first time.” It’s finally happened Will Sumner, the player has fell head over heels in love! All of his friends are having a lot of fun with it. Will’s childhood friend, Jensen asks him to coax his sister Hanna out of the labs of Columbia University and start living life. It’s been years since Will has seen Hanna and this time he sees her as the beautiful woman she has grown
Will’s childhood friend, Jensen asks him to coax his sister Hanna out of the labs of Columbia University and start living life.
It’s been years since Will has seen Hanna and this time he sees her as the beautiful woman she has grown into.
My issue with the book is Hanna’s claim to have had five sexual partners but is still completely inexperienced in the bedroom.
One or zero partners would have been more believable to support her complete ignorance.Still all the sex scenes were very hot.
This was a steamy brother’s best friend romance that had all the authors’ trademark humor which I just love.
She is in school getting her doctorate when her older brother decides to have an ‘intervention.” He wants Hanna to get out of the lab, meet people, live a little.
Will Sumner knows hot to show a girl a good time, and Hanna still remembers the stories and watching Will when she was growing up.
Having to fight their attraction for each other, when everything is telling them to just let go.Like I said before, I love this type of book and really enjoyed this one in particular.
It is a sweet story, yes, but also incredibly hot.
They ambush her; force to see her dilemma and make her promise to reach out to Will, her brother Jenson’s long time friend and Max’s business partner.Hanna has a history with Will; she met him when she was 12 to his 19 and learned through observation all things Will.
they both think like scientists and who else could she really learn from.They embark on a journey of Hanna doing porn research and asking Will to do things with her… he becomes her guide, her teacher in how to date, have casual sex and interact with others.
Beautiful Player(Beautiful Bastard, #3)https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...
"Sexting." Clever, Will.
With Will's booty call scheduling, playboy ways and Hanna's socially awkward yet completely open and honest personality, these two kept me entertained the entire story.I'm going to be honest and say that the first book in this series, Beautiful Bastard was not for me.
The sensitive, panty melting bit of male hotness that is Will falling hard for the awkward and boobalicious Hanna rocked my world just a bit.
You were a nineteen-year old hot friend of my brother who joked about sex in our house.
4.5 Stars!I LOVE all of my beautiful boys!!! Even that bastard Bennett! And while my beautiful stranger Max remains my favorite beautiful boy (I think it's because he's British) “Ben,” Max said, leaning back in his chair with a giant grin. “It’s finally happened.”I groaned, resting my head on my hand.“You got your period?” Bennett asked. “Congratulations.”“No, you twat,” Max said, laughing. “I’m talking about Will. He’s gone arse over tits for a girl.” ...my beautiful player Will comes in a very
4.5 Stars!I LOVE all of my beautiful boys!!!
And while my beautiful stranger Max remains my favorite beautiful boy (I think it's because he's British)
“Congratulations.”“No, you twat,” Max said, laughing.
I pretty much laughed through the whole book.I have really loved all of the characters.
Ziggy aka Hanna is the little sister of Jensen....who went to college with Will.
At the insistence of Jensen, Ziggy calls Will up....looking to expand her social horizons.
This was another great addition to the Beautiful Bastard series.
I am going to be so sad when I have to say goodbye to my Beautiful boys!!!
Will is a family friend who is a player.He doesn't like relationships and he has so many girls!On the other hand Hannah is shy and with the lab she doesn't have time for men..She needs help and Will will be there for her!!
The relationship between them starts as a friendship.They are so comfortable when they are together and Hannah feels free to ask questions about sex and what she must do with men!
I finally got around to listening to this audiobook.
As far as audiobooks go, the narration was great and the story moved along at a nice pace.Like earlier books in this series, 'Beautiful Player' proved to be feisty and highly entertaining.
I also liked that these two had history together, even if they hadn't been romantically involved.
Knowing that they had known each other for years made their relationship seem less like "insta-love" and increased the credibility.Although the two experienced some growing pains, it didn't seem overly dramatic or far-fetched.
I believed their love story and the chemistry between the two.This story was fun and sexy!
☆4 Stars☆I didn't think I could love anyone as much as Max Stella, but I do!
But I had a few issues with Hanna.Besides marriage of inconvenience, I love the best friends sister storyline.
There were times when I wanted to ring Hanna's neck!
That to me was becoming a bit annoying, because me personally I would have a hard time pushing Will away.
I didn't mind the whole inexperienced vibe with Hanna, but I don't think it suited her much.
And if you don't mind the friends with benefits storyline then you'd love this book!:)
This series never holds back on the sexy times, and Will quickly establishes that he is an experienced and capable lover of women… He's a tattooed, boob loving, dirty talking, deep thinking, highly educated, slightly perverted, and a sexual fantasy incarnate.Will SumnerKnown player, venture capitalist, business partner of Max Stella (my Book Boyfriend)… and the childhood crush of little Ziggy…Hanna "Ziggy" BergstromStudent, science-geek, and completely lacking a brain-to-mouth filter.
Maybe I’ll come both times?”It had been forever since I’d felt like I wanted to take over someone’s sexual history, completely overwrite it with my hands and dick and mouth.“I don’t think I’ve ever wanted someone so much I would beg for it.
A little picked on by Max and Bennett...and he seemed fun loving, crazy and definitely girl crazy.
He will do anything that Hanna wants and he LOVES it.
And as always, I loved getting both their POVs. And one of the best things about this series is that all the other characters are still around.
I loved how Bennett and Max gave Will a hard time but how they were all there for him as well.
I was surprised at how Kitty handled things...I expected her to be a total witch!Gotta love that ending...Will is just so sweet!
3.5 STARSEnjoyable.The story itself is good, although I felt it was very heavily weighted in sexual encounters & not as much emotional investment as I would have liked.
I'm glad Will found it hot (I guess a lot of men might), but it just didn't really work for me.It's an audio-book, so the voice acting does play a big role.
I enjoyed both of the voice actors very much.
Independently, either one of them could have pulled off the story, but I was happy to have both a male and a female for the back and forth pov's.
** 5++ “Don’t break me, okay?” STARS **   It wasn't just a physical attraction between us. Of course I'd been attracted to women before. But there was something more with Hanna, some chemistry in our blood, something between us that snapped and crackled, that made me always want just a little more than I should take.She offered her friendship, I wanted her body. She offered her body, I wanted to hijack her thoughts. She offered her thoughts, I wanted HER HEART.~ WILL  This book was a surprise.

This book was a surprise.
I certainly wasn't prepared for this much awesomeness.
Will and his Plum may be one of my fav book couples from now on...
Loved it! This was my favorite book of the series so far, so good!
The sex scenes, I'd be like: Now, Beautiful Bastard is highly focused on the sex, I mean, they are doing it like five percent in the book, and I'm sorry - but I loved it.
Beautiful Player definitely has a slower approach.
But when they get there - dayum.I always love reformed player stories, and this one didn't disappoint.
Now this turns into a great relationship: they start off friends and then slowly start having feelings, and then hand-jobs.
Yep. Hottest hand-job scene evah.
I don't know why I haven't read Max's story yet, but that Brit is definitely on my radar now.
I realized I've never written a review for my most favorite Christina Lauren book. I'm a little ashamed of myself. Because anyone who knows me knows of my all consuming OBSESSION WITH WILL FREAKING SUMNER:   “That isn’t just sex,” I told her, sucking along her collarbone. “This feeling that it’s so good it almost hurts? It’s been like this every single time I’ve been inside you, Plum. That’s what it feels like when you do this with someone you’re fucking insane for.” “I think you’d melt like sug
That’s what it feels like when you do this with someone you’re fucking insane for.” “I think you’d melt like sugar on my tongue.
What do you think?” She laughed a little, holding on to my shoulders.
I think you’re going to melt all over my fucking hand and I’ll lick it off after.
Are you loud, little Plum?
Let me do this and be gentle and careful with every part of you."“Do you think about it?” she asked.
Was lucky enough to read this early and I....loved it so much. Will is swoony swoon swoon.
5 "Smitten" Stars!  Hanna Bergstrom aka Ziggy/Plum is a 24 yr. old woman in grad school for biomedical engineering. She has moved to New York, and is living in her parents Manhattan apartment. She has sort of been an awkward geek most of her life. She doesn't have many friends, and spends most of her time in the lab. Hanna is the youngest of 5 kids. Her older brother Jensen has always been overprotective and tried to micromanage her life. Hanna's dad and brother come to visit, and her brother is
He thinks she is a smart, fun, beautiful girl, and she needs an intervention to break her away from her research centered life.
For years Hanna fantasized over her brothers bad boy best friend.
They run almost every morning, and Will kind of coaches Hanna on what guys want in a woman.
And the best thing is I think you have no clue that you look at women this way."-"Hanna.
He wasn't beautiful in the same way Bennett was, and he wasn't tender like Max. He was visceral and imperfect, dark and knowing.-Being with Hanna wasn't just about intense physical pleasure; it also made me feel calm, and thrilled, and known.-"What do you want me to do to you tonight?" "Anything." I lifted an eyebrow.
5 "Feels Like Home" Stars The last "Beautiful" man in this fabulous series. "You're a mysterious man, Player Will."Will is the last holdout amongst his friends, Max and Bennett, to need love. Oh he has sex, sex without strings and he is happy for it to stay that way. He is organized and a scheduler. What more can he need. He's 31 yrs old and is happy with his life. One day his old college roommate asks a favor, to meet his little sister and help her "get out" in the city. She is a scientist and

"You're a mysterious man, Player Will."Will is the last holdout amongst his friends, Max and Bennett, to need love.
She'll be the one who'll change your mind about everything."This story is about discovering new feelings, unmasking old feelings and going home.
She would need to remember: Secret agent.
This story starts as a friends with benefits relationship, Will teaching Hanna the ropes so to say.
Somewhere along the way, feelings start to develop.
It's Fabulicious!!BR with one of my Pinkies-the other needs to read this series ASAP!!
*slow clap* It behooves me to think this book was written by two women and is catered mainly towards the female demographic.
Oh, and Will obviously has the sex appeal and stamina of a God and has to frequently go on triathlons so he "doesn't want to fuck all the time." *cue my historical laughter at this point* Obviously he falls head over heels in love with our virginal Hanna...because novelty?
Women in that book felt like real women I would have loved to get to know and maybe hang out with sometimes.
➳Even after reading it for the second time, I never get tired of the dirty talking Will that Ihave learned to love and admired... ➳Follow Me On:Blog ♕ Instagram ♕ Facebook ♕ Twitter

They haven't seen each other in a few years and Hanna is now finished with college and decides to give Will a call.

He's a huge player and doesn't do relationships.....will Hanna change his ways??

There are no rules, besides the fact that no other guy touches you.""You're my forever"
5 HOT STARS!! “In the end one loves one’s desire and not what is desired.” I LOVE THIS SERIES! I have read and loved every book! This one is no exception. Beautiful Player is about Hanna and Will. We meet Will briefly in Beautiful Bombshell when the guys are in Vegas for Bennett’s bachelor party. He is successful, smart and handsome “player”- lives by his own rules and doesn’t want to commit to a serious relationship. Then...one early morning he receives a phone call from his best friend’s nerdy
I have read and loved every book!
He is successful, smart and handsome “player”- lives by his own rules and doesn’t want to commit to a serious relationship.
But he is in for a big surprise- the nerdy sister has grown to be a smart and beautiful woman and she has a proposition for him.Hanna (“Ziggy”) has been focused only on her career for too long and needs someone to “teach” her how to improve her dating life.
For the first time in his life he wants more.
I love Max and Bennett so much!!
“No, you twat,” Max said, laughing.
If you liked Bennett and Max, you are going to love Will. Best book of the series so far IMO.
⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐  5 STARS ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐If you haven't read any of the  Beautiful series  yet, then you're in for a treat! I don't know what kept me from reading this one, but whatever the reason, it was wrong!I'm going to make quick recap (ahaha as if!) of what's going on in this one as I think it's safe to say almost everyone has read it by now. Each Beautiful book is centered around a couple falling in love, we met, Ryan Bennet and Chloe Mills in  BASTARD , Max Stella and Sara Dillon in  STRANGER , and we finall
, and we finally get to see our PLAYER, Will Sumner falling for a woman.These books keep getting better and better!
Yes, charming, right?Soon they are meeting over a morning run, and Will is surprised to discover an all grown up "Ziggy".He's pretty much rendered speechless by her no filter's mouth, she basically says whatever is on her mind.Ziggy has a much more specific idea of what she needs to break her boring routine.
I thought it made sense with both Hanna and Will personalities, and it wasn't over stretched.All in all you have great contemporary romance book right here!
What did I just read? 400 pages of goodness, that is. Ohmylord, just when I thought Max was the perfect embodiment of the word perfection, Will comes and rips that title off of him without batting an eye! Yes, that means Will is my new favourite person from this series.I'll try to come up with a more informative rant later!
