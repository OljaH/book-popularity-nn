***2018 Summer of Spies***
Whether you’re reading the rather fanciful spy fiction of Ian Fleming or the gritty tales of John Le Carré, there seems to be liquor involved and in rather high quantities.
Make Len Deighton’s protagonist, Bernard Samson, another of the spies who is a fan of copious amounts of liquor.
I was right on track when I laid in a good supply of gin when starting my Summer of Spies.Other than the liquor, Deighton’s work leans more toward the grittier realism of Le Carré.
I’d never read either one of those authors before this summer and I’m impressed.
His most famous books are the series about "Harry Palmer" (Michael Caine's character's name in three spy movies, but not in the six novels, starting with "The Ipcress File" and ending with "Spy Story"), the two stand alone spy novels ("Yesterday's Spy," and "Catch a Falling Spy") from 1974 and 1975, and the nine-volume series centered on Bernie Sampson that begin with "Berlin Game."The Bernie Sampson series is sufficiently complex that the last book, "Charity," comes equipped with a staff diagram of British counterespionage headquarters over the books.
The screen versions may be partly to blame; I came to reading espionage and thrillers quite late and perhaps the dour, slow, subdued 70s movies and 80s TV left a lasting impression that these weren’t going to be my kind of books.This first novel in the Game, Set and Match trilogy - and, indeed, in the further trilogies Hook, Line & Sinker and Faith, Hope and Charity (I think the titling structure may have put me off a well) - features Bernard Samson, a middle aged MI6 agent.
One of my all-time favourite Deighton books, and of course, his masterpiece series.
This series equals the Smiley books (Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy and etc) by Le Carré.I got the Game, Set & Match videos on CD-ROM (!) shortly after it's single broadcast (which took an incredible hassle to get), which Deighton then banned forever.I read the books as they were published, and extraordinarily as the Wall came down.
(The supporting roles are terrific as well)The music by Richard Harvey is masterful, as well.I once did a virtual tour of many of the book's places in East Berlin, but vastly changed in year 2000.
It is however available as a presumably pirated DVD set on the Internet.Trivia 2 : have you noticed in the series how Deighton seems to make mistakes in the text, often with drinks.
Most of the characters, despite Deighton having given good descriptions, are very badly cast.
His books with very little adaptation could be scripts.Not badly cast, appalling cast!
Like many of Deighton's works, his deep knowledge of Berlin gives the reader a you-are-there experience.
(I think it was "Don't Get Fooled Again".) Paul McCartney read the interview, and decided to write one of his own, "Helter Skelter." I imagine Deighton reading the rave reviews of le Carre's Karla trilogy of the mid-1970s, watching Alec Guinness bring George Smiley to life on the Beeb, and deciding he could create his own intricate trilogy.
"Berlin Game" is as good as le Carre's Smiley books, which are as good as anyone has ever written the modern espionage novel
Sprinkled in like seasoning in Len Deighton's masterful spy thrillers are delightful sentences like, "it wasn't his fault that he bore a superficial resemblance to my father-in-law, but I found it a definite barrier." The Berlin Game is a taut and sophisticated thriller that brings the reader inside the desk job lives of British Intelligence as well as behind the Berlin Wall circa 1980.
As in seemingly all human endeavors, intelligence services are rife with office politics and jockeying for position.
In this case though it can have international implications and be a matter of life and death for agents in the field.
Deighton explores this compellingly.
A wonderful Cold War spy story.
With a wow finish.This book is the first in the Bernard Samson series.
There are 9 books in the series.
Three trilogies.
I have read 5 out of 9 of them.A lot of the book is dialog and I have a prejudice against books that are heavy on dialog.
(Or maybe I should revisit my prejudice.) It helps that there is lots of humor and Bernard is aiming barbs at his bosses and at himself.
And the story and background is told quite effortlessly through the dialog and Bernard's thoughts.
It is not surprising that Bernard Samson dominated the rest of Deighton's output in the same way that Harry Palmer did in the sixties.From a plotting point of view, there are a lot of points of similarity between the two novels.
Like Palmer, Samson doesn't quite fit in; twenty years after The Ipcress File, the secret service is still full of Oxbridge types who look down on someone who never went to university at all; both narrators have a serious chip on their shoulder about this, and the attitude is something of a constant theme in Deighton's writing about the secret service as part of the British establishment.The main difference between the two narrators is in the situations of the narrators in the two novels.
BERLIN GAME is an exceptionally fine espionage novel. It was written a number of years ago and was the debut of Len Deighton's popular character, Bernie Samson. This is the first time that I have read Deighton and I loved it. I already have the next in the Samson series on my night stand and cannot wait to get started.
I still haven't made up my mind as to what makes a viable spy novel.
Spy novels make better why/how done its than who done its.
I can't imagine a spy novel without alcohol consumption.
3. I don't think the plot needs to be truly plausible, but it can't be romantic in a schoolboy sort of way.
Truly heroic characters don't work in spy fiction, it's always the flawed sort that make it happen.
4. The author can't rely on characters who can effortlessly solve time-consuming problems.
The first volume in the first trilogy starring British agent Bernard Samson, a former field agent now working a desk in London, who is asked to go back into the field after a valuable contact in East Berlin, known as Brahms Four, demands to defect to the West.
Like the Palmer books, Berlin Game goes for realism instead of Bond/Bourne thrills, so adjust yr expectations accordingly.
For me, I enjoyed it a lot, and I have the next two books in the queue somewhere.
I had read all of Len Deighton's powerful "Harry Palmer" quartet, so I decided to give his Bernard Samson novels a chance, starting with Berlin Game.
The upshot was that I found it interesting, though just a tad short of his earlier work.One interesting thing about Deighton's spy heroes: One is never privy to what goes on inside their minds.
As the reader, you see their puzzlement as to problems that emerge; but the end always comes as a big surprise.
The result is a set of books that are like floating crap games: There is an outcome, but you are in the dark until everything comes clear in the end.
The story of Bernard Samson, a field agent for MI6, surrounded by incompetent, glory-grubbing superiors who have held desk jobs all their lives and can’t speak German fluently.
Set-up: there’s a leak in Berlin Station, and London’s main informant wants out, so it’s up to Bernie to get him.
A time-filler of a book, nicely done, but the two-dimensional characters that surround the ever-weary Samson could stand to have been filled out.
Surely he’s not the only agent in MI6 worth a damn?
Still, I do admire Deighton’s style of narration, which lets the characters and situations introduce themselves rather than slogging through tedious and extraneous background.
The Berlin Game is definetly one of his finer efforts.
Samson is a pleasingly nuanced hero in a genre where these can be in short supply.
In the first of a trilogy of trilogies he sent back over the wall into a still divided Berlin to persuade a spy to remain in place.So far so normal, what makes the book so enjoyable are the twists and turns poor Samson is subjected to along with the dash of derring do at the end which is all the more impressive for actually being realistic.
Why would an intelligence agency be any different is a question Len Deighton subtly puts across in his novel.
He also has to deal with superiors who while being incompetent on their jobs are highly competent in politicking at the work place.
Deighton distinguishes himself in the human emotions at play among the characters : Samson and his wife, Samson and his superiors are all excellent caricatures of what it means to live a life where your work takes over your psyche.
All the British characters in this story are members of Britain's Establishment - mostly upper middle class men with University backgrounds who all think they know what's best for Britain - and the World.
Len Deighton's "hero" in this book - Bernard Samson - is similar to his previous secret agent, Harry Palmer, although not as lower class.
The actions switches between England and a divided Germany with Berlin as the focal point, when a British double agent in the higher echelons of the East German government's economics department decides he's had enough and wants to go over The Wall.

Deighton has written some of the greatest thrillers ever to be penned. Berlin Game, the beginning of the Samson series, is generally regarded as the peak of his game. I'm not convinced the book has aged as well as his other works. It's still a good read but I think Iprcess File, Billion Dollar Brain and the other books in the Samson series stand the test of time better. You need this one to read the others but it's not his best.
Twisty and ofbservant, although I felt wrung out keeping track of some of the details toward the end.
3.5*
Wow, that was a great read. If you're into old time spy stuff, this for you. This is my first book from this prolific author. The story hinges around Bernard Samson, a British intelligence officer who is in the middle of extricating a spy from the East.
It's been a while since I spent time thinking about a book when I wasn't reading it, but this book managed to draw me in.
Cleverly plotted, interesting characters, and beautifully evocative world-building; this could almost be a spy thriller from the height of the Cold War, but with enough modernity to ground in the 1980s rather than the '60s.
The protagonist and many of the characters are still male, but the wives, girlfriends and so on are so much more interesting than most more modern books manage, and very definitely aren't just there to provide sex and/or angst.
Not a bad book, and so I gave it 3 stars rather than something lower, but it's definitely not something that interests me. Coming from the 80s, taking place during the Cold War, and following characters in their middle years, there's not much that's relatable to me. Everyone's always cheating, drinking, smoking, and generally participating in the classism that drives British society. It certainly is a counter to what I imagine as "spy fiction" though, and I expect I'll be reading more of the shooting and secret gadgets in the later novels in my course.
I was surprised at how little this book stirred me. It is competently written, but anyone familiar with the genre will spot the twist, such as it is, very early on. And since it is the first part of a trilogy featuring the main character, we know perfectly well that no harm will come to him. I guess at the time it was published, when Berlin was still a divided city, there was some mileage in Deighton's portrayal of the Cold War atmosphere. But now it is as much a period piece as Pride and Prejudice.
I SO wanted to like this book. The plot had the potential to be very intense, suspenseful, and thrilling. It was none of these. The pacing was slow, and the only "twist" in the story was painfully obvious several chapters before it actually happened. Despite that, I held out hope that Deighton would go full throttle with the action after the big reveal. Nope. It all felt dragged out right up to the end, which was one of the most anticlimactic ends I've ever encountered. Overall, rather boring novel.
A Cold War espionage favorite. On re-reading this after almost 15 years, still read fresh enough. Bernie Samson is close enough to LeCarré's Smiley, albeit with more of a field man approach, to be up there among the best characters in cold-war lit. Berlin comes to life like it rarely has in other genre novels. And the twists and truns are well built, with a lot left to be unravelled in the future instalments. The end is a cold-war classic finale, well executed by one of the genre's masters at his best.
Berlin Game is a 1983 spy novel by Len Deighton.
It is the first novel in the first of three trilogies about Bernard Samson, a middle-aged and somewhat jaded intelligence officer working for the British Secret Intelligence Service (MI6).
At one point I thought I was reading a Le Carre book because the writing is very intelligent and Deighton seems to have insights into the working of MI6.
However, he's somewhat easier to read than Le Carre who can be somewhat oblique.
Now, I can't wait to read the second book in the trilogy and will then move into the Harry Palmer books.
