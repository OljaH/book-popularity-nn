It was really beautiful
Sleeping Beauty is a kind of historical book, because the time of this book dose not show very clearly.
For example, the witch gave a curse to make Sleeping Beauty sleep all the time.
The King ordered to destroy all textile cars to avoid Sleeping Beauty to sleep.
There are many versions of Sleeping Beauty.
This book is the oldest version.
There are some different between the oldest version to the later version.
Sleeping Beauty has a prophecy not a curse for herself.
Thus, Sleeping Beauty's babies help her to wake up.
But the oldest version is more closer to the truth.
X'mas is a good opportunity to buy it, before it gets banned.http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/...
The illustrations are bright and colorful and the story follows the tale of Aurora (Briar Rose) and how she is cursed by the evil fairy because she was not invited to her party.
The three good fairies take her into the woods for her protection until her 16th birthday, but unfortunately they bring her back a day early.
The story is slightly different from the original Sleeping Beauty because only Aurora falls asleep when she pricks her finger and the prince has to fight a dragon to get to her.
The story is made into more about the hero than it is about the story of the curse.
The couple throws a feast in celebration and appreciation for the gift of their new daughter - Briar Rose - but make the mistake of leaving one of the kingdom's thirteen fairies off the guest list.
This thirteenth fairy comes to the feast and curses Briar Rose that come her fifteenth year she will be wounded by a spindle and die.
the reading level for this book would be middle level elementary students.
this book is more of a fun book for students to read but they could make a poster of the literary elements.
this is a universal tale for children and disney is making sure to recreate it each couple of years so it is not forgotten.
very useful for learners english.
I love sleeping beauty! 5/5
This is a great book to summarize the fantasy genre. It would be most suitable for K through fourth grade. It just really encompasses what fantasy and fairytales is all about. It's about a prince that saves the princess from doom. It's lighthearted at the end where he saves the day and everything goes back to normal.
A well written book. Enjoyed reading it.
Though this is an entertaining book for kids, I think it's about time we step away from the classic "guy saves girl" books.

Loved this book when I was little.
Jacob (1785–1863) and Wilhelm Grimm (1786–1859), were German academics, linguists, cultural researchers, lexicographers and authors who together collected and published folklore.Plot summery reviewedThe curse of the kind and beautiful princess brier- rose by the sullen thirteenth fairy and the sleep that lasted a century but passed as quick as a second, as if there was not a moments pause.seven fairies are invited to be godmothers of a king and queen's long-wished-for child, At the christening the infant princess Brier- Rose is bestowed several gifts from the fairy's.
However one evil Angel set a curse that would make the princess prick her finger on a spindle of a spinning wheel and die.
Another Angel set a magic on the princess that she would sleep, instead of dying, for a hundred years until a prince comes and awakes her from her sleep.
At the age of 16, the princess gets her finger pricked by the sprindle, and falls asleep.
After 100 years, a prince hears about a beautiful princess sleeping in the castle.
When the prince goes into the castle and finds the princess asleep, she wakes up and they fall in love.
That night, he wanted me to read the LGB version of Sleeping Beauty to him.
I was happy to comply.The text of this LGB, although abridged by necessity, follows the story of the movie pretty faithfully.
I don't actually mind straying too much, but since we had just seen the movie, I was happy that the book dovetailed with the movie so well.Sleeping Beauty is my favorite Disney film for its sheer artistry.
The book did a good job capturing the artistic feel of the movie; it would have taken another Mary Blair to have reproduced it entirely.
