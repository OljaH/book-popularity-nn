i haven't reread this since i've become an adult, and i've got the distinct feeling that doing so would just ruin it.
so i likely never will.but i'll always remember it as my firm favourite for all of high school.
we almost got suspended together once.
because my teachers couldn't tell the difference between fiction and nonfiction, even if i could.so read it if you happen to be fifteen.
otherwise i imagine it's a little too much.
or read it if you're not fifteen and still in love with vampires and horror, because poppy is seriously gifted with the horror imagery.
“I still recall the taste of your tears.Echoing your voice just like the ringing in my ears.My favorite dreams of you still wash ashore.Scraping through my head 'till I don't want to sleep anymore.”Like so many young people before me, I always thought that sixteen was going to be my year.
I don’t remember feeling the irony at that time, but in hindsight it’s undeniable, that this larger than life creature would put a book about a troubled young man named ‘Nothing’ into the hands of a sixteen year old girl who felt like nothing.
A crazy, almost plotless explosion of violence, wanderlust, and sexual energy, written when the author was nineteen and possibly a little nuts.
She now mostly disowns it, which only makes it more fun to read as far as I'm concerned.
Kind of like reading somebody's diary, or seeing their dreams.
If you don't like it I guess I can't argue with you, but if you happen to read this before her later stuff don't let it turn you off of her completely, as her other work is very different.
And I can't really say anything else because spoilers, but those of you who have read this book know exactly what I'm talking about.And that relationship between a vampire and a young goth kid kinda sums up this book.
And the darkness and the light meant so much more than just "good" and "bad" and those blurry lines that realization created was the meat and potatoes of this story.And these themes that this book embraces really spoke to me as I was reading.
It was a book that epitomized his childhood, and he is a man who has struggled with that inner darkness and his inner demons his entire life.
I totally crapped out on this buddy read. Sorry guys! This one is just not working for me. I might try it again in the future. The writing and pacing is weird and it's, okay, I find it pretty boring, to be honest. I didn't even make it to the controversial part(s). 13%. Sigh. Buddy read with Jess of the Blood Soaked Rainbows and hopefully Kristin of the Luminescent Death on May 9, 2016. I have been wanting to read this forever!
I have the feeling I simply discovered Brite too late...Had I been 13 when I read this (and a bisexual, alcoholic orphan), I might have connected with it in ways that my 22-year-old self just wasn't able......But I hope not.
All driving must take place under the influence of alcohol (and all alcohol must either be chartreuse or absinthe), especially when the character behind the wheel is underage; all sex must be homosexual or non-consensual (and preferably both); every scene must contain reference to either David Bowie, or an obvious goth band (Bauhaus, Sisters of Mercy...).I finished reading this book because it meant so much to a very dear friend of mine...but suffice it to say, it's been (and will continue to be) my last foray into Poppy Z.
Brite's oeuvre.
I met Christian and saw into the darkness of his soul, peering through his eyes to witness the melancholy of eternal existence with only your memories to keep you company.
Zillah, with eyes green as limes, as green as the last drop of Chartreuse in the bottle.
The vision of those eyes will haunt me forever, and as long as they do, this is a novel I will keep coming back to, for comfort, and a reminder that we are all just a bunch of lost souls wandering around this lonely planet.
This was the third time I read this book, and the third time I developed an overwelming desire to move to New Orleans (pre-Katrina obviously) in order to spend the rest of my days drinking absinthe and stumbling around the French Quarter in search of all the wonderfully sensual alluring vampires of both Anne Rice and Poppy Z.
So all I'll say now is that if you only ever read one horror novel in your lifetime, make it this one.
It is then that we realize that these three different road trips will all come crashing together, and we’re fascinated to see just how Brite manages it.What made Brite’s vampires so groundbreaking is the blend of the gothic scene, vampiric lore, and honest to god real people with real depth and emotion.
There was nothing wrong with being gay any more than there was anything wrong with being a vampire; it all comes down to each person and how they react and treat others.Unfortunately, many stood on Brite’s shoulder’s after Lost Souls, and the literary world was so glutted with vampire-meets-goth-rock novels, that those new to the novel often find it cliché.
I'm sorry my lovely vampire ninja, I tried, I really did.
I loved Ghost, felt for Steve, but the the rest, the rest were either boring, crazy, or flat.
Overall, I kept getting bored and skeeved out.
I'm a pansy :/ But incest, just no.
I honestly didn't think I would make it after (view spoiler)[Wallace described thrusting up into his daughter (hide spoiler)] or even after the Albino.
But it is more than that, I didn't feel that there was any point to the gross and gory parts other than for shock factor, which I find annoying.
No lo recomiendo PARA NADA
Stephen King endorsed the entire Dell Abyss Horror line.
Here is his blurb: "Thank you for introducing me to the remarkable line of novels currently being issued under Dell's Abyss imprint.
I have given a great many blurbs over the last twelve years or so, but this one marks two firsts: first unsolicited blurb (I called you) and the first time I have blurbed a whole line of books.
I hope to be looking into the Abyss for a long time to come." I read this book twice I loved it so much.
It was the first book I'd read by Poppy Z.
Δεν το έχω πιάσει στα χέρια μου σχεδόν δύο δεκαετίες, αλλά πριν ενδεχομένως το ξανακοιτάξω και κατακρημνιστεί στα μάτια μου, θα το βαθμολογήσω ως αυτό που ήταν, την εποχή που ήταν: μια εισαγωγή στο southern gothic, ωμή και ακαλαφάτιστη, που ειδικά στην αρχή, όταν δεν ήξερες τι να περιμένεις, σ' έκανε να νιώθεις ΠΟΛΥ άβολα.Περαιτέρω, ήταν ίσως η πρώτη μου επαφή με την εικόνα ή την ιδέα της εικόνας της Νέας Ορλεάνης, με το μυστήριο, τον μυστικισμό, το βουντού και τη σήψη του βάλτου, πριν ακόμα διαβάσω το Call of Chtulhu.Από εκείνο το σημείο και πέρα, οι δικές μου πλοκές, είτε στα roleplaying games, είτε αργότερα συγγραφικά, συχνά θα επέστρεφαν στη Βασίλισσα του Μισισιπή.Σε κάθε περίπτωση, είναι ένα βιβλίο με έντονες σεξουαλικές απεικονίσεις όλων των ειδών (με μια έμφαση στις ομοφυλοφιλικές μάλλον), που παραμένουν καλύτερες από οτιδήποτε παρόμοιο έχει γράψει η Charlaine Harris (στης οποίας τα βιβλία βασίστηκε το True Blood).
Un momento que me limpie de tanta salpicadura: whisky, cerveza, gasolina, sangre, esperma, vómito...Lo mejorcito de cada casa, señores: chupasangres y humanos metiéndose de cabeza en las situaciones más escabrosas posibles.
Escritura ornamentada, mucho gótico y una pizca de introspección.
Anne Rice puso la semillita y ahora los vampiros (y personajes perifericos) son guapos a rabiar, rockeros y muy gays (o bi por exigencias del guión).
Pero la languidez y los problemas de conciencia desaparecieron con el paso del tiempo.Y maldita sea, tengo que ponerle 4 estrellas a El alma del vampiro porque, aunque apenas haya historia, me ha impactado y revuelto las tripas cuando tocaba.
Es una novela de terror ¿no?
dnf @ page 69i have no idea why i couldn't get into this one. in theory, it's exactly the sort of book i should have loved. and yet, i can barely get myself to read more than one page. it's probably time i packed it in.
If you're going through puberty and feeling weird, this is a great book to read. With enough vampires, gay sex, incest and goth clubbing to satisfy any young misunderstood oddball (and truthfully, I have never been in a single goth club that played "Bela Lugosi's Dead" even once, let alone every night), this is a fun piece of wish-fulfillment. Dark, twisted, unbelieavable and not particularly sophisticated, I'd recommend this to anyone wearing Crow makeup in a rural town in the midwest.
But it wasn't "Bela Lugosi's Dead," it was "She's in Parties." And there were a lot of other quality goth bands on the CD and no more Bauhaus.My point is Brite mentions Bauhaus a lot in this book.
NOOOO PETER YOU ARE A GOD YOU DO NOT NEED METH WHY /rant.)Anyway, there are also road trips in this book.
I love road trips, too.
Let's move on to other parts of the city.I might have enjoyed this book more if I'd read it when I was younger.
Being that its been nearly 12 years since I originally read it, I wasn't surprised to realize that only vague images and memories of lush prose had stuck with me and that I had forgotten all about the basic plot line.
I don't, however, remember being struck by the fact during my first reading the only female character in the story was a victimized, bewitched, weak-willed 20-something with horrible taste in men.
Ann's character and all of her mooning bugged me.Funny, with the exception of Ghost, there isn't a character here who is redeemable and truly likable (in my eyes) yet I enjoyed every page of the book .
Superb, imaginative read. A new take on vampires. Very graphic like most of Poppy Z Brite's writing.
A gothic tale of black leather pants, angst, booze, DIY shows, dive bars, incest, bloodsucking and pedophilia, Brite's debut novel is a charming display of decadence in grungy excess.
Nearly every page is wrought with sensual descriptions of booze, blood, food, flesh, boy love and the music of Bauhaus, as Brite's cast prowls for spiritual and physical satiation in the American South.
What I liked best is that Lost Souls serves as a time capsule of the early nineties, a quaint time when music still felt like it had the power to be subversive, and when nipple piercings, tattoos, ankhs and boys with black lipstick still seemed edgy.
Fifteen-year-old Nothing runs away from his adoptive home and falls in with three vampires, one of whom is his unwitting father. In a haze of drugs, sex, and blood drinking, Nothing is drawn closer to New Orleans and the climactic events that will reveal his past and determine his future. Lost Souls is indulgent and gratuitous to the extreme, which will either delight or disgust the reader. Personally, I loved itand though I preferred the concept to the actual plot, I found Lost Souls visceral,
Personally, I loved itand though I preferred the concept to the actual plot, I found Lost Souls visceral, darkly intriguing, and difficult to put down.
It's a bit over the top and perhaps not a piece of "great" literature, but I heartily recommend it.To be quite honest, Lost Souls feels like a combination of the self-indulgent, gratuitous content of fan fiction and the skill and editing of a published book.
De hecho, puede que ni siquiera hayan nombrar a su autora; debido a sus temas recurrentes es bastante desconocida y queda relegada a cierto grupo de personas interesadas.Lo he dicho, y lo repito: este libro no es apto para personas sensibles, no muchos la pueden disfrutar (y hablamos sólo de disfrutar, ya no de entender).
No podemos esperar encontrar vampiros sentimentalistas, como los creados por Anne Rice.
No, los vampiros creados por Poppy Z.
Caminan del día y disfrutan del rock y del alcohol, de la buena vida.Entre los personajes principales protagonizan una serie de encuentros y desencuentros que en su mayoría van marcados por la sangre.
La mayoría de las circunstancias son oscuras y trágicas…No es un libro que cualquier paladar disfrute, por supuesto.
Lost Souls & I go way back to 2004 when i was only 14.
As you can see, the above should tell you that Lost Souls influenced my teenage upringings; took this favourite book beyond fiction and portrayed myself at times like these characters.After i finished reading the book, i went into a mini-depression as i was undoubtedly torned that the story had forever finished and i was to return the book to the Central Library.Years later, i went to a Mormon thrift store, just admiring the antiques, when all of a sudden i saw it!
Lost Souls!
The characters are good but at times they feel flat, especially the vampires, I like them but some times i thought they were cartoonized, it's just the fact that they have lived hundred of years and they always have a night of party sex and rock n' roll.
But the older you get the less you let some issues slide in a book.A thing I LOVED about the book is that when we're at a party or with the goth kids (i think all the kids are goth here, where were they when i was one!?
There's a boy named Nothing that has sex with any and all of his friends and does drugs.
Also, an abuser character that beats up his woman, a psychic boring character named Ghost, and 3 vampires that aren't very interesting.
If this book is supposed to be interesting because it's dark and shocking, I say that isn't enough, there still has to be an entertaining plot.
I like dark fantasy and horror, but only if there is a plot.
I'm not interested in reading about people's screwed up lives, even if their are vampires involved.
I think I would have been obsessed with this book if I read it when I was 12 or 13.
crazy ride. sometimes a little too crazy. But how great to finally read about non sweet vampires!Ending was weak
I remember little about the first read other than not being that impressed and not knowing what to think about all that "gay stuff" that I read.All this time later, I like to think I'm more mature and understanding with the "gay stuff"...and no, I don't call it that anymore.
Tying in the music of Bowie, Bauhaus, and the Cure, and the poetry of Dylan Thomas, it helped set the mood and the tone for the story.As others have mentioned, there's little plot, at times feeling like an Eighties vampiric version of Kerouac's On The Road.
Anyway, I read that Lost Souls "popularized the Splatterpunk subgenre, graphically violent, disturbing horror, infused with hip hop culture and gore." When I further investigated, I found that the book was about vampires, so I requested it immediately.Maybe it was because it took place in New Orleans, or maybe it was the lush, poetic writing, but Lost Souls brought me back to the world of Anne Rice's vampires.
First is the story of Christian, a 350+ year old vampire who tends bar in New Orleans and three vampires, Zillah, Molochai, and Twig, considered young and reckless by Christian, who live like nomads, hang out at bars filled with music, and who kill recklessly.
I was totally seduced by Brite's nihilistic characters.
But now I'm 36, I have a child and a life and some much more grown up sensibilities (though I don't feel like a grown up really), and it reads totally differently.
The nihilism feels lie immature stupidity, all the party-party-drink-fuck-blood-fuck-party-drugs stuff just seems empty and wasteful.
I don't really find any of the characters likeable any more (except Ghost - I still love Ghost).
It just all feels...
But I loved it when I was 21.
So maybe it's just a sign of how far I have come.
And maybe that's a good thing.
