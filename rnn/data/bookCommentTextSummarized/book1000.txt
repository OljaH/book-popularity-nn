He does have a sort of love affair with war that leaves a sour note with me, but even so he does speak of its horrors when not glorifying it.
Lines:Pity us who fight always at the boundariesOf infinity and the future----------It's hard to imagine How stupid and stolid success can make people At the institute of blind young men they asked Haven't you a blind young man with wingsOh mouths [humans] are looking for a new languageOne the grammarians can't labelFor the old languages are so close to deathIt's really from habit and cowardice That we still use them for poetry

Un libro precioso que hay qué leer varias veces en la vida. Es precioso y algo que no había visto antes, al menos no de la manera en que aparece en este libro.
.90 or 324 a man in the air a calf looking through his mother's stomachI looked a long while along the roadsThe wind makes the willows weepOpen open open open openLook but lookThe old man is washing his feet in the basinUna volta ho inteso dire Ché vuoiI began to weep remembering your childhoodAnd you you show me a dreadful violet hueThat little painting of a car reminds me of the dayA day made of pieces of mauve yellow blue green and redWhen I went to the country with a charming chimney who had her dog on a leashThere's nothing any more you no longer have your little baubleThe chimney smokes Russian cigarettes far away from meThe dog barks at the lilacsThe nightlight has burnt outOn the dress petals have fallenTwo gold rings near some sandalsIn the sunlight have ignitedBut your hair is the trolleyAcross Europe clad in little multicoloured fires- pg.
Appolinaire was one of the great figures of 'modern' poetry. Also had a great eye on his fellow visual artists as well. And that is the beauty of this guy's work - it's visual as well as literal. What you get here is World War 1 told in a manner that is fresh as a new flower but dealing with a deadly world. Essential poetry collection from a master!
Certains m’ont laissée complètement indifférente, a priori les plus perchés/décousus ; d’autres m’ont intéressée mais sans plus – les dits calligrammes, justement, qui sont intéressants sur le principe, mais pas forcément émouvants poétiquement parlant ; d’autres, enfin, m’ont prise à la gorge...
Cette dernière catégorie abordant principalement le thème de la guerre...
Appollinaire en parle avec un mélange assez détonant de recul, d’ironie, de froideur, de violence, aussi.
En y mêlant l’amour, en comparant parfois amour et guerre, avec une petite touche esthétique de-ci de-là, c’en est parfois décoiffant.On l’aura compris, cette troisième catégorie ne m’a pas laissée indifférente.
BlueMoon Le 02 Juillet 2017 à 14:03Un peu difficile à comprendre, beau parfois, très centré sur la guerre. Certains poèmes sont aussi illisibles. Dommage que je ne l'aie pas étudié. A little hard to understand, beautiful sometimes, really focused on war. Some poems are even unreadable. Too bad I didn't study it, I'm sure I would have understood more!
I don't know, it is jus that some of these poems I loved, some I thought were ok and some I really didn't get.
The very reason I chose to read this book was the stylised poems.
I read these poems in two books simultaneously, one in French and one in Danish.
Not every poems appeared in the Danish translation and therefore, it is very possible that I literally didn't understand the poems, because I'm not that good with French.
But the calligrams, the figure-poems, those I was able to get at least some meaning out of due to the visual apsect.
Apollinaire, inventor of a form, the Calligram, a poem that is shaped like what it describes, kicks the shit out of Wilfred Owen any day. You can taste the mud of the trenches in his poems and feel the casual, reminiscent, playful, heart broken peace from which his poetry is born defiant of impending death,
It's raining...
In the time of war and distress Apollinaire remains us why poetry is essential for the human spirit.
Un recueil de poèmes très ludique et original.
Some of the short lyrics are cool, but I especially like the shaped/visual poems.
Apollinaire was the greatest poet ever to live. Get this and "Alcools," as translated by William Meredith.
Someday I will finish this book. I really will. Maybe I'll try and freshen up my French first, though. Apollinaire is probably worth that effort.
la poésie encore et toujours
J'adore Guillaume Apollinaire, Il est mon poète préféré. J'aimerais retourner et re-lis
Concrete poems in French.
I normally don't "do" poetry, but this is one exception. Even if you don't understand French, Apollinaire's calligrams are still fun to look at.
