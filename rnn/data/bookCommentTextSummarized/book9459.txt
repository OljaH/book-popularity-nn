Many people owned or worked with horses and didn't know much about them.
Horses know this and develop bad habits as they don't want to work hard, if they don't have to.Bill Dailey was a horse whisperer of sorts.
He went around solving people's problems with their horses and tried to teach them how to avoid future problems.This book is part of the Black Stallion series and does tie to the Black.
It is a novel and has a problem other than breaking horses' bad habits for Bill to solve.This is an easy book to read.
First, a note: I will never try to use my Nook to write a book review again.
That's incredibly annoying.That said, The Horse Tamer is part of Walter Farley's Black Stallion series, and it's both charming and memorable.
Bracketed by short passages featuring Alec, Henry, and the Black, it's actually a historical novel; Henry's story of his older brother, who tamed horses in the days when horses were the standard mode of transportation.
I strongly recommend this book.
But it's a really fine story, and any fan of Walter Farley, the Black, or horses would be wise to pick it up.
"It only takes a little nerves and a lot of kindness to win the respect and confidence of most horses."I've definitely said it before, but it's weird reading a Black Stallion book without The Black.
BUT I did enjoy this one more than some of the Flame stories (especially the one with the aliens.
What the heck was that about?!) It's almost entirely flashbacks about Henry's brother and how he comes to be horse-tamer.
It's interesting to see these methods since I'm sure a lot of them were common at the height of horsemanship.
Reminds me a little of The Horse Whisperer
He tames the wildest horses brought before him.
Horses no one else can touch.
Horses that bite and kick and have been locked in their stalls for years.
And he does all this in a matter of minutes.But he doesn‚Äôt use tricks.
Doesn‚Äôt sell potions.
Or turn his lessons into a show.And when Finn Casperson threatens Bill's morality, it may be the greatest challenge either has ever faced.My final Black Stallion book (sigh‚Äîhow sad!).
I skipped over this one growing up because it wasn‚Äôt about the Black, or Alec, or horse racing.
And Bill‚Äôs many face-offs made The Horse Tamer a quick, exciting, and engaging read.

The Black Stallion's Sulky Colt The Island Stallion Races The Black Stallion's Courage The Black Stallion Mystery The Horse-Tamer (all by Walter Farley) I stepped away from my re-read of this series as I just knew the two books listed first were coming up.
These two (Sulky Colt and Island Stallion Races) were even worse than I remembered.
I wonder if The Island Stallion Races is what turned me off of sci-fi.
The Horse-Tamer isn't really part of the series but is about the Black's trainer Henry Dailey as a boy.
This one was something different, only barely attached to the Black Stallion chronology, and I think that's why I liked it. I was ready for something a little different, and this fit the bill quite nicely.It has a slightly Marguerite Henry-ish tone, partly because it's not about a 'super-horse', although it's not as charming as her tales. A pretty good little story that breaks up the same-old, same-old routine of the main series.
This book really had nothing to do with The Black Stallion, but was a story about Henry Dailey's older brother. Bill Dailey was a carriage maker and his father sent Henry to stay with him for the summer to learn the craft. What Henry ended up learning was the art of horse taming, as Bill came into his true calling.
I enjoyed the characters, and their world and hope I get the chance to read the story again and/or to read more within the series.My Rating System:* couldn't finish, ** wouldn't recommend, *** would recommend, **** would read again, ***** have read again.
This was a strange interlude in the Black Stallion series. The Black has nothing to do with it -- it's just a really long ramble from Henry. I think this is the only Black Stallion book with illustrations in the paperback version. These "horse-taming" methods seem awful brutal by today's standards.
Not the best for horsey people but drops in some nice period history. I can't imagine a kid even liking this book.
I remember being very reluctant to read this book. It wasn't really part of the Black Stallion series; in fact I think was a biography of sorts. Anyhow, not my favorite.
The first book was the story of a boy and a horse, but the series grows with books on similar themes of overcoming adversity and animal/human bonding. Loved them as a kid.
What's not to like about Walter Farley and my favourite horse series (even now)
I stormed through this series. I made a beeline for the "F" section for a month's worth of library visits, until I had read the whole series.
This book was very entrapping. Good read!
Reread
Great little short story set in Henry's past. It richly illustrates an issue of a bygone age.
Definately a book to read. It just goes to show that there are ways to train horse's that doesn't involve pain, suffering and abuse. Plus you can rid a horse of bad habits.
one of my favs.
Farley's autobiographical stories about his older brother, a horse trainer.
