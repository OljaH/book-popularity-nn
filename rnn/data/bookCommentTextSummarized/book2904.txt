It isn't brilliantly written but I think it is written brilliantly.
It doesn't hold back on extending a young reader's vocabulary; it's ridiculously privileged in regard to the family life of the characters; it's chock full of repetition, deviation and repetition; and I loved every minute of it.
It foreshadows Eddie Braben, The Goons and Monty Python.
It includes Milligan's best goon joke twenty years before Spike used it.
There are all sorts of other modern classics that owe more than a little to Richmal Crompton.
Among other things I can see why it was a great favourite of the young John Lennon.
I always loved William, even when I had an irritating small brother of my own, but I think I appreciate him more as the years pass. He's never really bad.
More deftly comic tales of the irrepressible William. Crompton's prose and insight into the mindset of the young boy never dates although the occasional detail has.
Funny but serious and very entertaining
