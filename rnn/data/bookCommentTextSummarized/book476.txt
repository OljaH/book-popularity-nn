Hey, tales from the country of my ancestors! (Slovakia, that is.) Once more, this collection of uniquely European fairy tales and and folklore will be an enjoyable way to pass the time for fans of the genre or for persons who like world literature. Same tales of note here include "The Three Golden Hairs," "Prince Babyaya," "Grandfather's Eyes," and "The Golden Duck." Overall, it's an interesting, speedy read.
After reading some deeply disturbing and modern Euro fiction (the Lisbeth Salander series), these much older Euro folk tales were ALMOST as gruesome.....sometimes. And sometimes the tales were just enchanting and fun. I am less angry at those Czech cabin stairs in the Sumava mountains that kicked me in the a$$.....Their literature has soothed me.
Very charming, surprisingly gory in some places. The last story is a real treat.
