Fortunately, this reader has been getting lots of practice at that activity while tagging similar unattributed artefacts in Joyce’s Finnegans Wake so scraping through the clay of Donleavy's book was easier and more rewarding than it might otherwise have been.
Or perhaps not; the narrative is set in the late 1940s, a time when Dublin was home to an entire pubfull of literary men, more than one of whom had drinking talents to rival the Ginger Man, men such as Flann O'Brien, Brendan Behan, Patrick Kavanagh and Anthony Cronin.
Perhaps Donleavy is simply offering homage, not only to Joyce and the others he alludes to, but to the very practice of appropriation.* Finnegans Wake, page 10
I'd hazard a guess that this is one of Shane McGowan's favourite books.
Perhaps this sort of thing was daring and bawdy back in the uptight 1950s.
Sure, Dangerfield wins all his fights, outwits all his pursuers and beds all the women, but only because of Donleavy's benevolence.
Suspension of disbelief is one thing, but we're away with the fairies as far as plausibility goes here.
And the book simply reeks of misogyny.
There are only so many times women (who, it seems, are only good for one thing) can be hit, verbally abused or get covered in excrement before your eyes start to roll uncontrollably in your head.
Why is it, I ask myself, that so many authors write a magnificent first novel and then the following ones never seem to live up to the initial expectations?But now, reading this book, I’m viewing it completely differently; if anything it’s more the style as opposed to the plot which really cannot be called too exciting and which regrettably doesn’t enthrall me to turn the page, and read and read, without putting it down until the end.
"The lyrical quality of money is strange."- J.P. Donleavy, The Ginger Man (It is like J.P. Donleavy lifted Harold Skimpole out of Hard Times and made a whole whore of a novel of him as a young law student in Dublin.
This is a shitfaced novel.
The prose is distilled three times: once with food, once with f#cKing, and once with irreverant flippancy (maybe once too for finances, but that would ruin my trinity of distilation image).
It doesn't seem like a long novel, but requires slow, devoted reading.
For all those 1 and 2 star reviewers on here who "hated" the book for its "misogyny" and the "unpleasantness" of Sebastian, I quote the following: "He sat there elbows on his thighs hands hanging from his wrists.Dreaming out this sunset.
Out of them comes love.Miss Frost stepped from the door shyly.
Her head a little bent and red spreading under the flesh of her temples.
For women are lonely people, lonelier with women and with men, enclosed by sunless children and the little vanishing things that go away during the years of waiting.
Or that novels should not have unpleasantness in them.
Sure, I don't personally agree with many of Dangerfield's actions (his often offensive behavior seems to be the sole reason as to why some people slam The Ginger Man).
This literary feat was accomplished all through the lens of a character who may not be the most stand-up guy, but one who I surprisingly found myself rooting for in the end.After reading many of the other reviews, a lot of readers compare The Ginger Man to The Tropic of Cancer.
I didn't dislike Tropic of Cancer because of the offensive material, but rather because I thought it was base just for the sake of being base.
Picaresque: of or relating to an episodic style of fiction dealing with the adventures of a rough and dishonest but appealing hero.I started reading The Ginger Man without reviewing those principles and nearly quit in disgust.
Sebastian Dangerfield is truly a bastard, totally consumed with drinking, smoking, eating, and seducing women, all while doing absolutely no work (or study) and paying as few bills as possible.
I want to shake each and every one of them!One of my female friends recommended Donleavy’s writing to me and I chose this book because it was on the Modern Library’s list of 100 top novels.
In “The Ginger Man”, JP Donleavy seems determined to prove that you can get by with at least two: sex and alcohol, if you add the occasional brawl, fist fight, punch or slap with your rivals, your peers, your mates or your wife, partner or mistress.Manning Clark’s reference to comfort begs the question: for what are we receiving comfort?
Sweet substances of girl, alone and damp and loving me and moving over me, over me and over, covered safe with her heart and each other's thighs, my head gone away, tickling teasing, curling hairs and hood of smells and flesh and salt taste like swimming.""Be my guest.
طرح اندامت را در آن ژاکت خاکستری میبینم.وای که این تکه نان گرم چه بویی دارد.خدایا،گمانم ما دونفر تصا
However there are some books, Dostoyevsky’s ‘Notes From Underground’ say, where clearly we are not supposed to like the central character and yet the passion of the prose is such that we can’t help but admire the work anyway.These thoughts were high in my mind as I read ‘The Ginger Man’.
Do we congratulate ourselves on (hopefully) never having run into such a person?To be fair it is brilliantly written and there are some laugh out loud moments within these pages.
But whereas a book like ‘Notes From Underground’ is a character study where the reader is supposed to dislike the character, I think ‘The Ginger Man’ wants the reader to be on Dangerfield’s side.
I became aware of this book after recently reading a Hunter S.
Thompson biography, wherein it describes how Hunter discovered the book in New York, and did his best to imitate Dangerfield's lifestyle.
Apparently the Ginger Man was turned down by something like 40 publishers before finding it's way to the mainly pornographic publishers Olympia Press in Paris.
Despite turning out mostly smut, Olympia owner Maurice Girodias also published some early works by the likes of Samuel Beckett, William Burroughs, Henry Miller and Jean Genet amongst other rising literary talents of the time.
The style of the book is modern for the time of it's writing.
JPD launched a storied literary career with a masterpiece in The Ginger Man. Sebastian, which means "venerable," is a man perpetually on the brink of utter madness brought largely upon himself.
Drink at every pub from College Green to Kerry over the course of a year and then "I'll arrive on Dingle Peninsula walk out on the end of Slea Head, beat, wet and penniless.
A truly dreadful book.
I quit reading on page 29 of 347, and here’s why:From the blurb from the back cover: “…wildly funny, picaresque classic novel of the misdaventures of Sebastian Dangerfield, a young American ne’re-do-well….”And this, from the fateful page 29: “He drove his fist into Marion’s face [his wife].
She fell backward against the cupboard… In tattered underwear he stood at the nursery door.
He kicked his foot through and tore off the lock to open it.
Anyone who thinks that’s wildly funny is not someone I’d want as a friend.
I’m not even sure I want him/her free to walk the streets.
A great big stream of consciousness slice of life book about the boozing, lazy, nasty, cruel, selfish Sebastian Dangerfield, an American in Dublin who is supposed to be studying law at Trinity but instead drinks all day, chases women and exchanges abuse with his wife.To be sure, Sebastian is an unpleasant character, but that doesn’t bother me.
And, as with The Horse's Mouth, the same nothings seemed to happen again and again: Sebastian avoids creditors.
Sebastian beds women.
Sebastian gets drunk and waxes outrageous and lyrical.
کتاب خیلی خوبی بود مخصوصا شیوه روایت ترکیبی سوم شخص و مونولوگ خیلی برام جذاب بود. بنظرم ترجمه اش اصلا قابل قبول نیست حداقل در چند موردی که من دیدم. البته تمام کتاب رو به مرور به زبان اصلی خواهم خواند.

Most women despise The Ginger Man. Actually, what they despise is the Sebastian Dangerfield character for he is a drunken, misogynistic, lecherous scoundrel, the very kind of man they are terrified that their daughters might someday meet.
The more open minded among them, however, appreciate the quality of Donleavy's rendering, the richness and inventiveness of the language and the out and out hilarity of the story.I love women to the point of reverence and on every real world level find The Ginger Man despicable.
But the Ginger Man is not the real world.
It's a fabulously written book with a fabulously flawed character.
شخصیت اول رمان سباستین دنجرفیلد، نجیب زاده ای آمریکایی می باشد که در دوبلین دانشجوی حقوق است.
مردی 27 ساله که از نظر یاغی گری ها و بی قیدی ها طعنه به شخصیت «هولدن فیلد» در ناطور دشت می زند و از نظر بی شعوری و سادگی شاید به شخصیت «ایگنیشیس رایلی» رمان اتحادیه ابلهان.
this is # 99 on my list of 100.
i received the greatest joy when i read the last page and didn t have to spend any more time with ,sabastian.
is this a great novel cause donleavy describes in great detail one of the worst characters in literature ?
he is cruel to women and yet they keep coming back to him.
he doesn t work, barely studies his law books, has no redeeming qualities.
there are so many bad books on this list of 100 that i might stop reading the list.
مدت هاست کتاب ها رو نصفه ول می کنم، ولی این کتاب پونصد صفحه ای رو یه ضرب خوندم.راجع به داستان حرف خاصی نمیشه زد. شاید ساده ترین راه بیانش بیان شباهت ش به ترکیبی از عقاید یک دلقک، ناتوردشت و خیلی خیلی ریز، ریگ روان باشه. نثر فوقالعاده روان، داستانسرایی همزمان از اول شخص و سوم شخص، شباهت بی حد و وصف شخصیت مرد زنجبیلی به هنری چیناسکی دنیای بوکوفسکی، الفاظ شدید سانسور شده و دنیای نفرت انگیز کتاب، همه و همه باعث شده کتاب شما رو لحظه ای از خودش دور نکنه.//

I wonder if neuroscientists will ever be able to analyse tears that contain the byproducts of great happiness and great sadness at the same time. And what is such an intense feeling called? Even to think of this book brings a tear to my eye, and reading it I cry buckets. This horrible, loveable, picaresque hero and antihero, this moonchild of Irish imagination. Wow
Sebastian Dangerfield is the same sort of character as Ignatius Reilly in A Confederacy of Dunces, another book which is hailed as being "brilliant" that I could not stand.
I expect characters in books to have some sort of quality that I would hope to find in a real person.
I do not feel Sebastian reached that point, which makes me feel that the 347 pages' worth of time I put into it were entirely wasted.On a fun note, however, the copy of this book I purchased (luckily for only a buck at Half Price Books) has names, addresses and phone numbers of people in the front and back covers.
Much like the dialogue in that film, Donleavy's witty, loosely constructed vignettes might be a bit disorienting at first bit they grow on you and you find yourself chuckling more and more especially in the more bizarre stream of consciousness moments (kangaroo costumes, public transportation "wardrobe malfunctions").
Sebastian represents the best and worst of human nature and as such is not always traditionally likable as he is both the hero and villain of the book.
Likely a grower for many readers, but I recommend it highly.
“She went down the steps.
Paused, turned, smiled.
Key. Green door.
Few seconds.
A light goes on.
Shadow moves across the window.
What sweet stuff, sweeter than all the roses.
Come down God and settle in my heart on this triangular Friday.”While reading Ginger Man I was literally mesmerised by its magically artistic language – it has never occurred to me that the words could be so kinematic.
And it was the book that made me fall in love with postmodernism for good.“Someday you’ll show up when I’m back where I belong in this world.
My gamekeepers will drive you out and away for good.
Out. Away.
Kniha je o ubožákovi Dangerfieldovi, kterej přijede z Emeriky do Irska kotit irský katoličky a když odmítnou kotit, tak jim pořádně nandá facany, ať už je střízlivej nebo opilej.
V Zrzounovi to po delší době mělo švih a grády, styl je ujetej a svižnej a celkově není divu, že to vyšlo v Olympii, páč je to jedna a ta samá verbeš jako Miller nebo Durell, jen do toho někdo přimotal sodomistické verze postav od Jamese Joyce.
Hodnotím devíti bludišťáky, protože tomu ke konci začal docházet dech, nicméně některé manželské výměny a dialogy si budu pamatovat do konce života, nebo alespoň tak měsíc.
"The Ginger Man" is a novel for no one, except perhaps sociopathic poser intellectuals who find bawdy antipathy entertaining.I'll start with Donleavy's prose style, the only redeeming thing about the novel.
He's supposed to be a loathsome, drunken rogue.
Appparently it's supposed to be funny.
In one crucial scene, referenced throughout the remainder of the novel, Dangerfield accidentally rides a train with his penis hanging out of his pants.
Maybe "The Ginger Man" had a place in 1955.
Maybe it inspired later works of dark comedy and contributed to a stylistic evolution in Irish and American literature.

The book is described as a “comic masterpiece” and it’s odd because when I think back to a couple events in the novel, like the toilet paper robbery and the landlord Skully knocking at his window, they seem funny.
The rich guy kept handing him money and clothes and offering to give him haircuts where the novel leaves off with Sebastian shacking up with one of his mistresses having gone through no character development whatsoever.
At least his wife finally had the sense to leave him.Do I think the novel deserves to be on a list of the top 100 books of the 20th century?

J.P. Donleavy is a gd genius.
It's amazing that people are giving this book bad reviews, simply because they didn't like the central character or his woman-hating, baby-bashing behavior.
As I read more and more reviews, especially from younger people, they seem to be positive only if 1) they like the main character and approve of his morals/behavior and 2) if the story made them feel good.
If you judge this book for its prose; story telling; humanness; authenticity; real-life grit...it's an absolute masterpiece.
Yes, it makes you uncomfortable and, at times, cringe, but it's real.
It's pathos.
