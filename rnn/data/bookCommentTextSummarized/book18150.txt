It's like a train wreck—I don't want to look, but can't stop myself.Only five short days have passed since Ava left Jesse, and her entire world has ended.
The narrative would have readers believe that Jesse doesn’t “need” alcohol, ignoring the fact that it was made clear, on more than one occasion, that he can’t stop once he starts.
2: ‘I’m not a raving alcoholic, Ava. I admit I get carried away once I do have a drink and I find it hard to stop, but I can take it or leave it.
This book is now live on Amazon everyone!! Full review, finally posted!!Amazon.com Amazon UK  I want the woman with me who keeps my heart beating.   Wow! Just, Wow! Before you read my review, please just open Massive Attack’s Angel in a new window and play it in the background as you read.  This song features frequently during the book and is Jesse’s song for Ava.  Play it LOUD!This has to be one of the most anticipated releases of 2013. After the last desperate and devastating few chapters of T
After the last desperate and devastating few chapters of This Man, we’ve all been waiting with bated breath for more Jesse & Ava. The second book of a trilogy is traditionally the weakest, it’s neither a beginning or an end and can often be just filler but that is NOT the case here.
This book just blew me away, I DEVOURED it and I am now bereft that it is over and can’t wait for the third book to be able to finally conclude this intense and overwhelming romance.We left Jesse & Ava in the depths of despair at the end of This Man. Both of them are broken by what has happened and their relationship is seemingly in ruins.
This is what I call INSANE LOVE.'I love you because you give me purpose.' - JesseWords to describe this book -DraggedFucked-upOver the top&Too much sex.Kept felt like yelling 'CHILL YOUR TITS AVA'Fuck, she can give a deaf person a headache!!Want to know what happened in this book?

Crazy fucking twisted controlling angry freak who is a total arse.
★★★★★! Beneath This Man, book 2 of 3. The continuation of the in control yet so out-of-control, Jesse Ward’s intense whirlwind romance with Ava O’Shea!   “I look up into his green eyes and wisely note that he’s not in a fucking about mood. I want to bring to his attention that I’m not happy about his evasion of my enquiry, but I know it will get me entirely nowhere right now. Besides, I’m absolutely delighted to see my domineering man back. It’s been too long.”   This Man Series is the intense
The continuation of the in control yet so out-of-control, Jesse Ward’s intense whirlwind romance with Ava O’Shea!
This Man Series is the intense, epic saga about Jesse Ward, Mr. Sexy, Bossy, Compulsive and Secretive Extraordinaire, in his relentless pursuit and seduction of interior designer, Ava O’Shea.
He truly is all pure, sexy, unadulterated bossy alpha!Six words to describe Jesse: Intense, bossy, compulsive, enigmatic, possessive and elusive.I’d also like to extend my sincere thanks for introducing us to all that is sex with Jesse (or fucks depending on the mood):
Ava O’Shea is everything that Jesse needed and everything we needed to keep the story going.
INFURIATING.Here's a breakdown of all the things that happened in this book (Contains spoilers so read at your own risk ):*Jesse is miserable and so is Ava. Jesse asks her to stay in her life (after 5 LOOOOONNNNGGGG DAYS of being apart), she agreed.And in no particular order:*Sappy emotional shit (i.e. ILYs and I need you) from Jesse and Ava.*Ava having a lot of questions for Jesse.
As if we didn't know already*Sappy emotional talk again from both our MCs.*Ava asking Jesse questions about him.
I now know why the author chose the name Beneath this man, and it's because this 'story' is about a man walking all over a girl's life, self-esteem and dignity and ripping every ounce of rational thought out of her head (and I don't mean it in the good way).
He literally takes her life away from her by dickmatizing her--he makes her a slave to the cock, girls, and you know it.But it gets even better in Beneath this man.
And if he were reading this, he would simply say 'Watch your fucking mouth!'Now, probably every girl on this planet loves the alpha-male and/or the bad boy.
Im not sure about this book yet, Im giving it 4 stars I may change to 5...Ava got on my nerves quite a bit, but mainly the rating would bc of the steamy scenes...Jesse is quite controlling and a tad immature in this book, but all his creativity regarding the sex in their relationship kind of balances my liking him.They are at it like 90% of the story, and the other 10% is filled with drama at the Manor, at the PH, at the club. We finally find out how old Jesse really is :)The sex is awesome, but

I could not like Jesse in this book......his actions were pretty scary.....he lies to Ava about a lot of important things...those are not little white lies......he manipulates her......he stalks her.....he checks up on her....
Reading these two books is like exploring the mind of a certified nut job, how can any woman think this shit is romantic or better yet sexy?Jesse, oh Jesse, here's a tip, just cause you deny you're an alcoholic doesn't make it true.
What girl wouldn't swoon over that move, here's what I have to say to that:What's more annoying than Jesse is Ava, she just lets him continuously push her around.
Not only him but his friends too, after being wrangled into checking on Jesse she stays to take care of him.
Uh, let his fucking friends do that shit, you don't owe him anything.
-> Jesse giving Ava "The Countdown".♦ Jesse telling Ava to "watch her fucking mouth" whenever she sweares.♦ Jesse refusing to tell Ava his real age (view spoiler)[until a certain morning where Ava gets creative and manages to make him confess his age  (hide spoiler)].♦ Women from Jesse's past trying to tear them apart in order to get him back.♦ Ava being on Central Jesse Cloud Nine.End of.Despite the fact that this book mentally exhausted me like no other book ever has, I did find myself spellbound by Ava and Jesse's unique and dramatic love life and I was unable to stop reading their over-the-top crazy story.
Really need this book to come out.....Update:just read the entire book again......still have over a month for the next one!
Did I say I rrrealllllllyyyy need the next book?So close, yet so far away!!
Does it cause alarm bells to go off if I tell you I am planning my day around this book release??Update: Sigh.....it was almost painful to watch Jesse and Ava's relationship evolve.
Jesse wants all of the control as much as Ava wants her independence.
Jesse is so passionate and dominate.
I love how they needed each other almost like a drug addiction.
5 Central Jesse Cloud Nine, Crazy Mad Stars!!!Where to begin... Beneath this Man left off right where This Man ended. 5 days since Ava has seen Jesse. They are both broken. They are both a mess. They both realize that the need each other. Jesse Ward- you are crazy beautiful, crazy mad, crazy possessive, crazy in love, crazy sexy... key word... CRAZY!  Lord of the Sex Manor.Mr. Challenging. Domineering. Alpha male.Sexy as hell. Sweet. ‘Easy going’ lolJesse was much more likable in this book than
Jesse Ward- you are crazy beautiful, crazy mad, crazy possessive, crazy in love, crazy sexy...
Jesse was a little crazy, as I’m sure we’ve established.
We learned a lot more about Jesse and his past in this book, though he still has a little mystery left.
For fucks sake woman, I’m thirty fucking seven!” (hide spoiler)]Some of Jesse’s favorite lines...
Jesse and Ava both love each other.
She drove me a little more crazy at time during the story than Jesse did!
YEP!I have to say this part of the book made me love Ava!
*****FIVE+++++ STARS*****
♥4 (no-ish) BEYOND CRAZY Stars♥ ‘It’s pure bliss, baby. Total gratification.

Also had me glued upon it, with my eyes bulging and sometimes tears running down my face or head thrown back in laughter, this book (and THIS MAN) delivered...After two books I can now say for sure.
In Jesse's case they are obvious but what took me by surprise in this book, is that apparently Ava has some too.
Jesse relents and Ava possesses.
Liar and painfully truthful, dominant and submissive, insane, neurotic, crazy, possessive, vulnerable, fragile, protective, exasperating and adoring, he is one of the most complex book characters I have come across.
Do you understand me?’‘I don’t deserve you, Ava. Not after the life I’ve lived.
"Ava, why the fuck am I handcuffed to the bed?”   More desperation in the second book...More yelling...More wild emotions...More drinking...More sex...More kinky sex...More shocking truths...More controlling and resisting....More lies...More forgiveness...More passion...  "I want you here when I go to sleep." He licks my bottom lip. "And I want you here when I wake up. Starting and ending my day with you is all I need.”  God...I ADORE Jesse Ward!Three… Two… One… Zero, Baby!!!

Okay, Okay Jesse you have the power and a 4 star rating.
Ugh!--------------------------------------------------------------------I’ll admit it, I’m not a fan of Ava O’Shea and Jesse Ward.
I read This Man and pretty much hated their continuous loop of a craziness.
While at the same time, I’m still reading and gossiping about them.
I’m not on “Central Jesse Cloud Nine” but this story definitely confirms the fact that there is someone out there for everyone.
Wishing Jesse and Ava good luck in book 3.
The characters don’t grow in any way, and they still argue and shout at each other all the damn time it really does give you a headache just reading it., and they still have loads and loads of boring bland sex.There is still no real chemistry between Jesse and Ava, and Jesse still continues his over the top controlling ways whilst Ava lets him.
At the end of the book 1, having been in a rage most of the time reading it, I actually thought there might be a spark of hope for Jesse.
Reread on March 19th- 22nd!I am so glad I have been rereading this series, I’ll have all of the details of the series for when I read Book four!This is book two and I found it so much better than the first! The angst in this one made me go through so many emotions! I was so absolutely hooked on the dynamics between Eva and Jesse! I can’t wait for the newest book!! I’m onto book two now!!!
reread August 2014 My Thoughts: ♦ Finally, the truth comes out about his age. love how Ava got it out of him...hate who came to his rescue!♦ Finding out what's going on with Mikael and his wife♦ The times Jesse left & always ended up at the same place with the same person! ♦ Black Lace & diamonds ♦ All hell breaks loose at 85%......shocking, crazy & unbelievable!!♦ What's up with Ruth Quinn? Coral? And who is Sally dating? ♦ 3-2-1-Zero♦ Ava being cuffed...never heard that type of you

This book was intense, but Jesse kept me going and going....We get closer and closer to Jesse and Ava. Those two are so perfect!! Of course still steamy!!!!Heaps of sex here *giggles*  I really love this series, if you haven't meet Jesse yet, please do!!!!Best part, the whole setting takes place in London!!! Home home, hence it is double close. Jesse Ward
((Lots of swearing is involved in this review; all spoilers clearly marked))I don't know why I do these things to myself...I knew what brand of bug-fuck-crazy I was going to get with Jesse Ward, and just sat here quietly and bought book two...
and yet I'm so stupidly captivated by this series I will probably still read book three......Seriously fucked up situation I have going on here.I INSIST ON INCLUDING THE FOLLOWING JESSE WARD RANT IN ALL OF MY REVIEWS FOR THIS SERIES.
Ava was still a little dramatic at the beginning of the book but I don't care.
Roll on Spring.And Now....This is still how I feel to a certain degree, although I warmed to Ava so much more during my re-read, she is on such an amazing roller-coaster ride with Jessie.
And gorgeous Jessie...if you have read the book you will know what an AMAZING HERO he is.
♥ ♥ ♥ So, 'Beneath this Man' ~ *Can Ava find her way and strip back the layers of Jessie Ward?
*Can she get beneath this beautiful, gorgeous man?
I've finally got beneath this man.' (hide spoiler)]
I didn't like this one at all.
I kept going because I was curious, but their back and forth, OMG!, both of them cray cray.
She was a pushover and he was overly obsessive, maniacal, his behaviour even bordering on mental abuse I dare say so.
Not to mention that Jesse is a constant fucking liar.I may write more when I find some time...I guess I will check the 3rd book since I already have on audio, better be some grovelling there and I hope for his behaviour to improve since I saw the glimpses of redemption at the end of this one.
And she better grow some spine.
I can give you four words why this book is only getting four stars.....Watch your fucking mouthIt's  that  much of an issue and source of contention with me. I loathe a double standard and this one really gets me all riled up. The first 75% of the book is a lot of bickering back and forth and it really wore on my nerves. Just when I was getting fed up, I got totally gobsmacked. I'm talking a whole range of emotions:I WAS SHOCKED I WAS ANGRYI HAD TO DO A DOUBLE TAKEI LITERALLY GOT SICKI WAS SPEEC

The first 75% of the book is a lot of bickering back and forth and it really wore on my nerves.
Just when I was getting fed up, I got totally gobsmacked.
It's clear these two are toxic to each other and they've managed to infect me with their poison.
Jesse has been able to enrage me to the point of book homicide and yet he's still managed to secure a place in my heart.
Agh I need to find out more of what happens. I hate all this business of waiting for books to come out I'm way too impatient.thank God the day finally came when I got this & all I can say is wow. I can't wait for the 3rd now.
4 Crazy-ish Stars This second installment starts five days after Ava found out about Jesse's lifestyle and job. She was obviously not happy about it. But Jesse has an even worse reaction to her exit and drowns himself in sorrow and alcohol. He just wants her back. But after that happens (No. This isn’t a spoiler. It’s pretty obvious, otherwise wouldn’t be THREE books.), things aren’t automatically easy and perfect. Jesse's past keeps coming in their way and Ava is starting to get a little (litt
4 Crazy-ish Stars	This second installment starts five days after Ava found out about Jesse's lifestyle and job.
Jesse's past keeps coming in their way and Ava is starting to get a little (little being an understatement) neurotic about it.
In this second book we have them trying to figure out each other and living with their differences, hoping for a future when their past keeps haunting them, and a lot of people try to separate them.
(Who wouldn’t be?).And with Jesse's past, his craziness and possessiveness, I still love him.
So, I can’t wait for the final book and finally see how this crazy love story will end.
☆☆4 Jesse Ward is the MAN Stars☆☆Coming straight off of book one (with my low rating), I'm surprised that I even started book 2.
My friends told me not to give up on Jesse and I'm so glad I didn't!
So many secrets were uncovered and I felt like so many layers of Jesse was revealed.
I'm glad to say he's definitely grown on me.
I loved the back and forth bantering between Jesse and Ava. Their dynamic is funny, intense, combustible, heated and sensual.
Jesse is being changed, but so is Ava in her own little way.

The writing was flawless and brilliant once again and if at all possible I love both Jesse and Ava even more now!Jenny:  Oh we definitely had blast off Gitte and only the best lace will do for our revisit to the one and only "how old are you?" Mr Ward!
Five days of “what happened?” and Ava is re-united, on dragging feet, with the shadow of the dark and broken man she cannot knowingly live or breathe without.“My fear was completely justified; I’m lost in him again” – AvaYou know a story is going to be amazing when from page one you are hooked.
● 5 Missing-ish Birth-Control-Packets Rating ● ‘Where you’re concerned, I’ll try my best, Ava. I already told you, I’ve waited too long for you. You’re my little piece of heaven. Nothing will rob you from me. Nothing.’ He presses his lips to mine to seal his declaration. ‘As long as I have you, I have purpose and reason. That is why I won’t be drinking and that is why I will do everything in my power to keep you safe. Understand?’  But that is pretty much the romantic rambling of Jesse as he is
‘Where you’re concerned, I’ll try my best, Ava. I already told you, I’ve waited too long for you.
But that is pretty much the romantic rambling of Jesse as he is trampling Ava. Nope, I am not putting Jesse down but there is a lot to say about the man and his Jackyll/Hyde behavior toward Ava. I seriously want to see this 'laid back' person everyone keeps babbling about.
Basically the whole book focuses on Jesse and Eva rebuilding their relationship that got a bit scratched and bruised in the last book.
5 stars  ‘It’s pure bliss, baby. Total gratification. Absolute, complete earth shifting, universe shaking love.’  Beneath This Man picks up days after Ava left Jesse’s to his imperfect ways. She’s drowning in pain with the loss of Jesse, but she finds it hard to stay away especially when he needs her. Guilt consumes her and even though staying and watching over him would probably end up killing her she has to make sure he is ok. She has so many questions that she want’s answered, and promises he
She’s drowning in pain with the loss of Jesse, but she finds it hard to stay away especially when he needs her.
God love him for all the ways he shows Ava how much she means to him, she is his life as he is hers, without each other they are nothing but an empty shellAva understands why Jesse is the way he is, she may not know everything just yet, it's enough to know that whatever he does is because he loves her completely, mind body and soul.
There is no doubt about it, Jesse and Ava are truly, madly, crazy, deeply in love with each other.
Lather.Rinse.Repeat!When the ‘countdown’ didn't work there was tons of different types of f*cking:sense f*ckreminder f*cktruth f*ck (my favorite, it involved hand cuffs and a vibrator… go Ava!)retribution f*ckapology f*ckalfresco f*ck‘making friends’ f*ck(view spoiler)[proposal f*ck …..
People of their past (Matt, Mikael & Coral) kept popping up and added a bit more conflict in the already crazy relationship.
Okay, so don’t get me wrong… I didn’t totally hate the book.
So that is why I am not going crazy over Jesse like everybody else.
It's time for Jesse and I to make friends again.
Jesse, baby, here I come ;)Update 01.21.13So my good friend, Rachael, kept me abreast of what was happening in this story.
I literally just read book one, This Man, like a week ago.
It was like book one all over again.
More questions, more showing Ava with no backbone, more possessive, manipulative and secretive Jesse.
Well from what I was told, I was right.
I'm going to put this on hold for right now, until I feel the need to make friends with Jesse.
It's just too much right now.
This was a BR with Jo and Sammy(This was a re-read for me)5 Stars!If you haven't read the first book in this trilogy This Man or this book Beneath This Man I suggest you stop now and don't read any further as this book may contain some spoilers or reference things that happened in the first book in the series This Man.No matter how many times I have re-read the first 2 books in this series, I can't get enough and I never get tired of reading about Jesse and Ava (I believe I've read This Man and Beneath This Man 3 or 4 times now- I've honestly lost count).This book picks up 5 days after This Man ended.
I really enjoyed how the author makes you feel apart of the story, I really felt like I got to know Ava and Jesse more throughout the story and I loved the consistent 'this man isms!
I felt exhausted at the end of the book, I can't seem to get enough of Ava and Jesse and I need a HEA.Love or hate this book I challenge anyway not to be affected by one emotion or another and I have to confess that this couple rank in the top of my favourite fictional characters.
If you managed to get through book one and wanted to continue, then you already know this couple is messed up.
I'm sorry but no man can be that good, in every way that every single woman falls in love with him.
Just once I want to find a book where the woman has every man fawning over the woman and the Hero has to deal with it.
He's so completely in love with Ava, he just doesn't see any other woman as a threat.
That is the one thing the author expressed without a doubt and truly saved this book for me.

Ava and Jesse are both miserable without each other, but it seems Jesse is worse than she is.
Plus, she needs to know more about the man she has fallen in love with.
It was a long crazy ride, but we finally get to know Jesse a bit more in this book.
I still feel like there is more to know about this man.
Jesse does some really stupid stuff in this book.
I love seeing him when he is vulnerable and when he opens up to Ava. It's weird how perfect he can be at times.
He would always get his way and it seemed like Ava's wants weren't always considered.
I am eager to get on with this man confessed and 2.
Jesse and Ava have a very full on relationship as a continuation from this man and you can expect them to be passionate, Intense and protective of each other.
Jesse is his usually dominating unreasonable self and Ava is irritating at times but I totally understood her in this one and devoured this LOVE LOVE LOVE these pair!!
Go on give them a chance because they completely wowed me Jodi your my new favourite author onto this man confessed...
The story line was just about screwing and the same repetitive lines were used..'This man is crazy' 'This man knows no bounds'I started doing everything in between reading not interested much...My rating was slipping down fast to a bleak 3 stars!About 3/4 of the way the book started to pick again.
We found out Jesse's age and Ava figured out about her 'walking birth control pills'The ending and Jesse ofcourse was the only reason this book got 4 stars from me!Look, we all KNOW Jesse is never going to change, he will always be a crazyy possessive man and thats why  WE ALL LOVE HIM!
I think I am in love with Jesse Ward ☺ Do I want him in real life HELL NO.

I love you two beautiful people, but sometimes I wonder how you make it through the day with each other without commiting murder or needing some stout sedatives.
"You completely consume me, Ava. I can't function without you.
I just need to say that, there are some answers in this book, but not all of them.
What's really going on with Kate and Sam?
Where is Dan going to fit into that??
And then what is going to go down with Mikeal?
I have seen spring, but no date yet and believe me I needed it like yesterday.
The emotion of the written words leapt off the pages straight into my heart: “I needed you and you left me” – JesseFive days of “what happened?” and Ava is re-united, on dragging feet, with the shadow of the dark and broken man she cannot knowingly live or breathe without.“My fear was completely justified; I’m lost in him again” – AvaYou know a story is going to be amazing when from page one you are hooked.

OH MY GOODNESS yes finally done, and let's just say I've got whiplash from this crazy crazy pair LOL but guess what I won't have it any other way. Jesse and Ava at it again. More drama. More secrets. More angst. More tears. More sex. But it felt too dragged on for me and I nearly skipped till the end. My reason for giving this 4 ✨✨✨✨was maybe nearly 60% all Jesse and Ava ever did was hmmm @&$?The snippet in Jesse's POV I've thoroughly enjoy watching him all frazzled.
I really liked this book it was very good but it seemed like it was longer then it needed to be.....but my big question is what keeps happening to Ava's birth control? I am wondering if she's gonna be pregnant in book 2....I can't wait to read it
