3.0 stars. Classic science fiction novel by Jack Williamson that explores the same themes and basic set up as his ground-breaking novella "With Folded Hands." While this is a good story, I thought that With Folded Hands was more tightly focused, created a better sense of dread and was the superior story. That said, this is still a good story and worth the read.
"Darker Than You Think," Williamson's great sci-fi/fantasy/horror hybrid, was released later in 1948, and 1949 saw the publication of "And Searching Mind" in hardcover form, and retitled "The Humanoids." "With Folded Hands" had been a perfect(ly downbeat) short story that introduced us to the Humanoids, sleek black robots invented by a technician named Sledge on planet Wing IV.
(Actually, this novel takes place a good 6,000 years from our present day, the reader infers.) On an unnamed planet, a physicist named Forester, head of a secret government project that is constructing a prototype "rhodomagnetic" bomb, comes to realize that the newly arrived Humanoids on his world are a bane, not a boon, to mankind.
Interesting in that there's a lot of science, based on an attempt to explore ideas raised by quantum mechanics as opposed to Newtonian physics.
"There I think we've found it--the mechanics of teleportation!
No transfer of actual substance, but rather an exchange of identities, brought on by controlled probability.
That gets us around the old electromagnetic problems of inertia and instantaneous acceleration...." Much is made of something called "rhodomagnetics," too.Otherwise, the concept is covered more effectively in the short story, With Folded Hands, imo.However (view spoiler)[the ending of this confuses me.
Is it really bleak, in that Forester is now brain-washed?

A classic full of great and wondrous ideas (hence the two stars instead of one), but some of the very worst writing I've slogged through in years. Williamson never met an adverb he couldn't sophomorically abuse. Ugh. He also rushed the ending to disastrous effect, which is too bad -- the book would've been somewhat less awful had he spent more effort on developing the turnabout. This juvenile crap makes *Asimov's* prose seem beautiful by comparison.[Edit: I couldn't in good conscience let the two-star rating stand. Really, the writing was that awful.]
The central conundrum this novel explores is the dichotomy between safety and liberty.
The are going from planet to planet imposing safety and happiness on all humans they find, whether they like it or not.
Some humans have stumbled upon discovering parapsychological powers which they are using to resist the robotic occupation and these seem to be the unconscious manipulation of yet another spectrum of energy; the psychophysical.
Could these three types of energies be related in some way to form some grand unifying theory of everything including consciousness itself?So, this is an action packed novel that is also packed with ideas and revolving around the central question of liberty verses safety.
The first 50 pages is a novelette "With Folded Hands" about mechanized "robots" called Humanoids slowly taking over mankind due to a benevolent "Prime Directive" which is to "Serve and Protect and allow no harm to come to humans".
In this case, "The Humanoids", travel to a remote planet system to bring their "Prime Directive" to a new group of humans that are involved in a "cold war" with their neighboring planets.
They are opposed by a group of dissenters who have developed powers which the author calls "Psychophysical" (clairvoyance, telekinesis, teleportation, etc) who join with a scientist who is an expert in a fictional science called "Rhodomagnetics".
The humanoids are out there in a great science fiction story that was written in the late forites, but is still amazing to read today.
I discovered the book through a Webcomic, of all things, but the description of the novel captured my imagination: In a distant future, the Humanoids, a race of robots with a prime directive to protect humans at all costs, effectively invades different planets and takes over.
The story accounts several attempts by humans to stop the Humanoids, only to show them fail each time.
There is a happy ending, of sorts, but it’s more a case of mutual existence between the Humanoids and the humans, and I almost felt betrayed by that conclusion.
Much of the science is up to date for the time, but it also contains fictional (or proposed) science which seems to be internally consistent.
But, if you accept the ending, you will discover that science and technology are ultimately good for mankind.
I had some problems with how this ended in view of the protagonist's point of view which to push and I am not sure I accept the novels conclusion.
IMO, one should read such older novels in the context of the times it was written.
Interesting novel.
Williamson drags along the journey of The Humanoids conquering of the world during the short story "With Folded Hands", and one remaining chance for humanity to save itself in the actual novel.
The short story was great, and I wasn't eager to start the novel after the story, because it felt so complete on its own.
In both the short story, and the novel, the action is mostly gripping, and sci-fi concepts thought provoking.
The math concepts got ridiculous too.
There is lots of action throughout the novel and tons of magical concepts invented to give humanity a chance.
In a remote future, the Humanoids have come to an unnamed, Earth-like world. The Humanoids wish only to serve, to keep you from harm, and to deprive you of anything that makes you unhappy or agitated. How far they are willing to go to achieve this end, however, is the terrifying reality faced by those whom they invade.Full review here: https://bibliomaneblog.wordpress.com/...
I have the 1982 GB edition.
I liked the fighting spirit of Forrester, this kept me along for this sizable SF story, for he became angry at injustice & betrayal, he sought the truth, worked hard toward the craft of science, seeking the philosopher’s stone, and when great revelations came to him, he staggered in doubt & awe (Jane teleports 200 l.y.s away) but exercised his genius, his human faculties, to fathom parapsychology.This reminded me of “Lathe of Heaven” for its mind-bending filler, how World-changing a person’s mind can be: and “Children of the Mind” as well, like Forrester’s mind takes on such resonance at an atomic level that he traverses expanses of the universe as one who creates it; and of course, the Robot series from Asimov, there is a Prime Directive to safeguard people; and the theme of surveillance, human liberty, the worth of liberty, human violence; and artificial intelligence.
So like 3 1/2 stars for “Humanoids”, themes of such weight conveniently packaged into an entertaining fight to save the world from robot invasion.
In terms of its power as an allegory for what humanity may be facing, in the present and in the future, it's just a step behind maybe "1984" and "Brave New World." The only reason I would rate it as four instead of five stars is that in the last act there's a bit too much quantum mysticism (Williamson lays it on incredibly thick with the exposition and "rhodomagnetics") and there's also a lot of Deus ex Machina when the characters rather than the attempt to solve an unsolvable problem should be the center of the narrative.
Should we give them the power to make our decisions for us, to prevent us from possible harm, and to restrict our personal freedoms "for our own good." With powerful computers in our pockets, ubiquitous connection to the web, and demanding apps that seize our attention, the theme is remarkably current.The humanoids are perfect machines developed only to serve humanity, whether they want their service or not.
This acceptance apparently signals to the robots that the enlightened humans can make their own decisions and take risks.I suggest reading the book for it's place in sci-fi history and for the continuing cautionary message.
Its themes are familiar: androids created to serve humanity instead seek to enslave us in order to protect us, and one intrepid scientist is the last hope to stop them.
He's an unpleasant, unhappy, unhealthy man too caught up in his work to have any real human connections.
Maybe the author intended him to be so unlikable as a part of the story's ironic arc -- the androids offer him true health and happiness if he gives himself up to their control -- but he's not exactly someone I wanted to spend a lot of time with.
The Humanoids' compelling premise is what if there were androids created to keep all humans healthy, content, and safe all the time?
The book was a quick read, but very thought-provoking.
It would be a great book to use in a high school classroom.As a couple other reviewers mentioned the ending -- I have to say that I found it disappointing.
I'm planning to see how the second volume in the series is reviewed and then I'll decide if I want to read that.
It could affect how I feel about the ending, if I read the next book and it answers my questions.
Classic SciFi A short story & novella with author's comments on both. Somewhat of a comment of the Right's view of the Left in the humanoid's solicitous goodwill. I'm not sure if Williamson's humanoids pre or post date Asimov's positronic brain stories, but the "To Serve & Obey & Guard Men From Harm" prime directive parallels Asimov's 3 rules.
5 stars for the introductory novella "With Folded Hands"3 stars for The Humanoids. The main premise holds up and is still intriguing and horrifying but the humanoids themselves don't show up until 60 pages in to a 300 page book, and there's way too much peripheral story that I did not care about.Than novella though. Goddamn that was good.
What a disgusting set of endings! What a loser philsophically this Author is!! MAin hero in second story the humanoids is literally cucked by the bad guy! Sickening!!! Disheartening and depression what utter crap!! Mega disappointed!!
Awful, just couldn’t finish reading it.

El libro se lee muy fácilmente, Capaz de agradar tanto a los fans del género (siempre que sean capaces de apreciar una propuesta de menos de 200 páginas) como a los profanos (que no se asustarán con una desmedida cantidad de letras xD). Es realmente interesante y permite reflexionar y detenernos sobre aspectos de nuestra sociedad en los que no habríamos reparado. Sin embargo, su reducida longitud, la obviedad de su mensaje y su excesiva simpleza le impiden dejar poso y marcarse en nuestra memoria tanto como “debiera”.http://meitnerio.blogspot.co.uk/2016/...
The edition I read includes both The Humanoids novel and the short story “With Folded Hands” (1947) its prequel.
For example a basic home workshop is filled with dangerous things, so humans shouldn’t have home workshops.“With Folded Hands” paints a pretty bleak view of a humanoid controlled universe; but The Humanoids is a little more ambiguous.
(view spoiler)[Although it is hopeful on the surface, I found it even more disturbing than the world of “With Folded Hands”.
(hide spoiler)].Later in his career Williamson published three more humanoid stories: “Jamboree” (1969), The Humanoid Universe (1980) and Humanoid Touch (1980).

I found this to be a relatively fast paced story but, there were some issues that made for difficult reading at times:- Williamson has created a fictional science and goes through great lengths to follow through the scientific development of the theories.
Problem is, this isn't a textbook I'm studying so I didn't always want to make that effort.- The science is dated - use of slide rules, teleprinters, binary systems etc - despite the fact that this is set in the far future.This is a "robot" story in which the Prime Directive goes horribly wrong.
The counter-arguments by the other side are quite persuasive at times, which makes for good tension.
However there was sequelt which makes me wonder where Williamson went with the story.

Itâ€™s psychics versus robots! WeÂre not in Asimovian territory...And it gets weirder from there. Iâ€™m not sure if itâ€™s just the nature of Golden Age SF, but this book is a real mess. I remember reading it a long time ago in my teens. The pacing is weird, as Jack Williamson goes through the key moments (like the humanoid takeover of Starmont society), as well as having characters totally disappear (the entire psychic team mostly fades away after an elaborate introduction, eg, Graystone the Gr

The ending is also a bit of a mess.
Thereâ€™s some unintentional (I think) ambiguity, that gets nowhere.I should have known better than to start re-reading Golden Age SF at my age...
I have a few more in store to read: Heinlein, Phil Dick, Le Guin, Vance, Wolfe, Silverberg, etc."
Although the style is a bit dated it is still a good read.
What I like about Science Fiction is the ideas they explore.
The Humanoids are neither good or bad - they are machines that are doing their job but rather too well.
It also explores ideas around living in a 'nanny-state' if taken to the extreme.
The state effectively does everyhting for you (or rather the Humanoids do) and life becomes pointless.
Because most people aren't happy in this state the Humanoids end up druging people to make the people happy.
Like I said the story is really interesting but rather disturbing.
Jack Williamson was one of the most important science fiction writers in the 20th century, so after reading a few of his short stories I purchased this book.
The story describes how humanoids take over planets with the Prime Directive to protect humans, but they don't allow anything that might harm humans such as driving, shaving, etc.
Read the book to see how it ends!Mr. Williamson introduced a number of words to science fiction that have been used by later authors.
If you are a science fiction reader, Jack Williamson is one author that you should add to your reading list.
