自分にとっての拠り所といえる本。大切なものは何か、感性とは何か、残るものは何か…あわただしく回る生活の中から、ゆっくりと、心地好く、本質に引き戻してくれる貴重な本。
主题其实是简单不过的"童年"与"成长"，英语俗称"coming of age"。但作者是以注重主题，而非情节铺排。整书是犹如汇集顺序的散篇回忆录，会让人觉得有点无节凑与明确进展。但故事的"诚”度却也满溢着的，让人感动。可能人生正确确实实是如此。
(Note: I received a free copy of this book through Goodreads First Reads.)A memoir of the author's childhood in Japan, mostly during the 1890s; written while he was still a young man.
The book is apparently a revered classic in Japan.
It's also thick with details about Japanese life and culture, which have to be explained to Western readers through copious sidebar notes.
Those details represent a definite barrier to enjoying the narrative; I wouldn't recommend the book to most general readers.
Only readers with a particular interest in Japan are likely to find the book worthwhile.
A wonderful recollection of childhood memories from a kid that will become Natzume Soseki's student. The life of a child in Japan before the first world war, so beautifully written that even the cruelest moment seem to be happy.Una meravigliosa raccolta di ricordi d'infanzia di quello che diventerá poi uno studente di Natzume Soseki. La vita di un bambino in Giappone prima della Prima guerra Mondiale, scritto cosí bene che anche i momenti piú crudeli sembrano ammantati di magia.THANKS TO EDELWEISS AND STONE BRIDGE PRESS FOR THE PREVIEW!
I'm a huge fan of Hiroki Sato, the translator of this text. If we were to take all the wonderful introductions he's written for all the books he's written, we'd have a truly wonderful text on Japanese letters.
This reminds me of my ex husband, a man raised in an elite family with all the expectations placed upon him.
This makes you reminisce about your childhood, no matter which it was bitter or sweet, even this book was written a long time ago (1910-1913). Souseki strongly appreciated this.
