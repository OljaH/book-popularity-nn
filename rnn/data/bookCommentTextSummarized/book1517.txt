Years later, at the suggestion of his neighbour, George Bernard Shaw, he put together an account of his experiences, calling it, with good reason, The Worst Journey in the World.Actually, the titular journey is not the famous ‘dash’ to the pole, but rather an earlier sub-expedition Cherry took part in: a hellish five-week slog through the permanent darkness of an Antarctic winter.
Maybe that was his tragedy (his later life was rather sad and haunted) and the tragedy of the whole expedition.Our tragedy is – irony won’t get you to the Pole.
Written by one of Scott's men on his last fatal expedition to the South Pole, Worst Journey was written by one of the youngest men on his team and one of the most stouthearted.
Cherry-Garrard went on the Winter Journey trip during the expedition to collect bird eggs.
Cherry-Garrard was one of the team members who eventually found his leader and the others dead.
Favorite quotes from the book, "It is really not desirable for men who do not believe that knowledge is of value for its own sake to take up this kind of life."Also, "Yes!
http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00djvtlDescription: As Apsley Cherry-Garrard states in his introduction to the harrowing story of the Scott expedition to the South Pole, "Polar Exploration is at once the cleanest and most isolated way of having a bad time which has been devised." Cherry-Garrard's The Worst Journey in the World is a gripping account of an expedition gone disastrously wrong.

On their inland trek towards the South Pole each pony has a specific carer, and Scott teaches his men to build a sheltering wall at night for each pony.
So how jarring – how bewildering, almost incomprehensible – is it then for a modern reader to read the very next sentence :Oates wished to take certain of the ponies as far south as possible and then to kill them and leave the meat there as a depot of dog food for the Polar Journey.
I think the whole tale of these dogs and ponies on this terrible journey leaves a modern reader fairly shaken.
It’s hard to believe that they were amongst the first men to see Emperor penguins and that they were prepared to risk their lives, and very nearly lost them, in the interests of furthering scientific knowledge of the penguins’ place in evolution.Scott’s journey to the South Pole, in the hope of being first there and claiming it for his king and country, was simply bait to acquire funding for scientific exploration.
If they couldn’t, chances were the journey to rescue them would also be impossible.C-G doesn’t dwell too much on the finding of Scott’s last camp.

Having read this now, and feeling like I've come through the journey with them, I find it hard to condemn any of the actions within and am instead struck with a feeling of awe at what was accomplished and endured, and what a debt we owe to all of the people who have gone out and discovered all of the wonderful things we know about the world.
This is, quite simply, my desert island book.
No other book encapsulates the message of hope in amoungst utter futility quite as perfectly as this.
Describing the adventures of the Scott expedition, for all its joy and folly, based on the jaded observations of a man who went filled with hope and expectation and looks back at an older, more cynical age.
While the famous Scott expedition to the pole is covered in detail, this is not the eponymous worst journey.
That journey, taken by Cherry-Gerrard and two other who were later to die on the pole attempt, was months of crawling in utter darkness, all in the name of science.
(Try as I might, I never could quite understand some of the details regarding sledging routes, various snow/ice surfaces, and so on.)As it was, I felt somewhat an ingrate for not having gotten more out of what was clearly a labor of love and duty, not to mention perhaps a kind of cathartic process for Cherry.
One does tend to over praise overly long books, such is the sense of relief upon completing them, but upon finishing this 600-page behemoth, really all I could think was, "I wish Reader's Digest had had a whack at it."
Larger than life story of Appsley Cherry-Gerard and his journals while traveling to Antarctica with Captain Scott and his I'll fared attempt to reach the South Pole.
He explains through memories, journals, and pictures what it was like to be trapped in the ice and make his way to land, managing supplies, with other members of the crew.
He describes what it feels like to live for months in the dark, the tremendous labors, landscapes and difficulties between men in perilous circumstances and hardships.
A huge story and a huge book, so be ready!
This is a first rate adventure story told by a man who is sensitive, thoughtful, courageous, and kindhearted. The part of the book from which the title is taken is maybe the most harrowing saga I've ever encountered, involving minus 70+ degree temperatures, howling winds, deadly crevasses, starvation, hopelessness, and endless darkness, all to collect Emperor Penguin eggs in the middle of an Antarctic winter.  I am not so big on non-fiction generally, but this is a book I could read again and again, and would recommend to anyone with any sense of adventure.
Bernard Shaw was a neighbour & so helped in encouragement & I suspect as an editor.The title is a little misleading: for us, the Worst journey is the one that would kill Scott & his party, but this isn’t the one Cherry is referring; rather Cherry was one of the men to trek across the northern coast of Ross Island to collect Emperor Penguin eggs in the depths of winter.
The world lost an aspiring scientist when Wilson died with Scott and more probably should be recognised for his writings and thoughts made during this expedition.
Read this book and you'll never bitch about stuff like not having enough towels in your hotel room or an over-cooked steak you were served at a restaurant in Paris. Yet another story that makes the modern man relize that there are no more worlds to discover. Polar exploration was just about the last of the travels into the unknown. I don't count space exploration because for that you need an entire country's economy behind you. Now any knob can circle the world with only a credit card. Sic transit gloria mundi.
From minor to major:- It has an insane amount of introductory text- It is self-consciously written as an epitaph to all the dead expedition members- It's overly detailed and full of information that is almost completely irrelevant and uninteresting to the modern readerThis book has two introductions and a foreward, totalling almost 100 pages.
That is "The Worst Journey in the World", written entirely from Apsley's own experiences, and it was fantastic reading.
Apsley Cherry-Garrard's 'The Worst Journey in the World' is quite simply a 20th century classic.
Published in 1922, the author recounts, in almost six hundred pages, Scott's polar expedition of 1910-1913.I find reviewing this book extremely difficult.
In the field of polar exploration or travel writing, this book is utterly astounding.It is now a century past since the exploits of this 'worst journey' were accomplished.
The critics of these heroic achievements of exploration still persist in written publications and reviews show their ignorance, whose only experience of a pole is something they lean against while waiting for a bus.
Pemmican, apparently, tastes quite delicious when stirred into hot water and eaten as a "hoosh." Also, the Antarctic is cold & horrible & I really want to go there because falling in a crevasse would look amazing on a tombstone.

Fortunately for the literary world, Apsley Cherry-Garrard became the latter… though more fettered than feckless.Perhaps not a natural writer, C-G cribs from various other expedition members’ anecdotes, personal notes and posthumous diaries.
– particularly the valiant ponies but also the half-wild wolf-dogs, the mischievous and adorable Adelie penguins and the innocent, overly trusting seals.
One by one, each animal’s unique character bursts into song in Mr Cherry-Garrard’s efficient prose.A humbling read for those who require humbling and a comparative pick-me-up for those who have been humbled too much.
Cherry-Garrard's testimony (not being widely read in the literature of polar exploration I don't know to what extent its account and conclusions have been revised or contradicted in the years since) describes a life of barely comprehensible arduousness and snails'-pace progress in weather conditions which were often alarmingly unpredictable and which in the end probably defeated the Polar Party.
What makes Scott's well-known final testimony excruciatingly poignant is that he knew they were only eleven miles from One Ton Depot but because of continuous heavy blizzards none of the party were able to set out.
It is a must, if you are interested in polar exploration or simply Antarctica.I personally recommend you to get to know the members of the crew before reading this because it simply adds to the fun since you will understand the "insiders" better.
The writing style is simple but still emotional and interesting, so that the lenght of the book is no problem at all!All in all I totally recommend this book to all the travel and adventure loving readers and I´m 100% sure you wont regret this read.
Facing temperatures as low as -78��F and fierce blizzards and gales the small team man-hauls to the rookeries, at one point having their tent blow away at night!
All in search of the Emperor Penguin's egg.Cherry-Garrard would become an emotionally crippled man for the rest of his life, riddled with guilt that he did not save the returning polar expedition (he at one point was probably no more than 10 miles distant from the doomed returning polar team)..Not lacking in personal courage, Cherry had no way of knowing where they were and followed his orders to return to base camp dutifully.
(Free on the Gutenberg Project, complete with illustrations.)But I also bought this hardback copy. A wonderfully thick book, beautiful to hold and read. So much more 'satisfying' than reading on a Kindle A fabulous book, written in a comfortably 'personal' manner without any heroics ,just a factual account of real life. Utterly readable, amusing, sad, terrifying and brought me to tears in places. Quiet, understated English pluck at its best, and very different in style to Scott's somewhat dry and concise journal. This will be a book to read and read again.
Una gran aventura real sobre la conquista del polo sur. Lo único que no me ha gustado es el excesivo nivel de minuciosidad. Solo ha faltado que contará cada vez que van al baño cada día. En general, está muy bien.
486: “It is to be noticed that every return party, including the Polar Party, was supposed by their companions to be going to have a very much easier time than, as a matter of fact, they had.” So even to the other explorers, it was worse than imagined.”And these are descriptions of how imagination was worse than reality, as seems to typically be the case: Cherry-Garrard says several times throughout the book that friends and family member back home were imagining that things were insufferable, when in fact, it wasn’t that bad.Page 181: “Some of us slept in a hurricane of wind and a hell of drifting snow and darkness, with no roof above our heads, with no tent to help us home, with no conceivable chance that we should ever see our friends again, with no food that we could eat, and only the snow which drifted into our sleeping-bags which we could drink day after day and night after night.
For their own reasons, the three maps the editors have included show only a few of the places Cherry mentions, not including Cape Adare, Evans Coves, any of the supply depots except One Ton, or THIS THING CALLED THE BARRIER that is basically the protagonist of the book, but nowadays it’s called the Ross Ice Shelf, which good luck figuring that out from the maps because “Map reflects present-day place names.” Seriously?
Things I have learned:- your teeth can shatter in your mouth when it's -60F- you can get frostbite on the same parts of your body over and over again- it's possible to "thaw" a sleeping bag in negative temperatures- penguins have little fear- the Poles are dangerous places (well, ok, I knew that one already)- scientists are b**-s*** crazySo yes, this was a fascinating book.
I still want to go to the continent (in summer, of course), but have zero desire to try to obtain the South Pole.
Whatsoever.Nor do I want to hike out to see the nesting places of Emperor Penguins, although I'm sure it's memorable.
One of the finest books I have ever read in terms of defining the spirit of the adventurer going genuinely into the unknown.Everyone knows the tragedy of the Scott Polar expedition, with its supposed 'race' with Amundsen to get to the South Pole, but here is one of the key members of that expedition some 10 years on, reflecting on it all, from start to finish.To say heroic, is just simply an understatement.
But as Cherry-Garrard himself noted, it wasn't about being the strongest and fittest in terms of pulling sledges or putting up with the cold, it was in the mind.The beauty in the Chapter "The First Winter" is awe inspiring and one can feel exactly why this expedition took place when it is completed.
Originally published in 1921, this book is an account of Scott’s Second Antarctic Expedition written by one of the participants.
Recommended to those who enjoy detailed first hand accounts of explorations.What I liked:•	Immerses the reader into what it was like to be an Antarctic explorer during the early 1900s•	Provides an in-depth analysis of what happened to Scott and his team, leading to their demise about 11 miles from the depot which likely would have saved them•	The description of the “worst journey in the world” which turned out to be the miraculous survival of three men who traveled over dangerous terrain at night in search of Emperor Penguin eggsWhat I didn’t care for:•	Too much detail for my taste, to a degree that it detracted from the story •	 Numerous formatting issues in the Kindle edition, such as headings included in the text, references to photos or drawings that were not included, quotations from literature not clearly delineated, etc.
The point now is to look after it.Amundsen saw it as a race to the pole, Scott and his party wanted to get there, but they placed equal importance to scientific and geological research, and also to study the wonderful penguins that live there-penguins who are equally mad!
Bowers and Wilson come to mind.A brilliant told tale by a brave and largely forgotten manPS love it that they had cocaine and opium with them, we certainly live in different times
Sono stata sulla Barriera con Scott, Bowers, Wilson, Oates, Cherry e tutti gli altri per 3 anni, con loro ho vissuto la spedizione per raccogliere le uova dei pinguini Imperatore, con loro ho fatto i viaggi in slitta, ho patito il freddo, mi sono congelata il naso ed i piedi, ho mangiato penmican, ho dormito in sacchi a pelo umidi e freddi, ho trepidato per il mancato ritorno della squadra del Polo, ed ho pianto quando hanno ritrovato i corpi di Scott e dei compagni.
Indimenticabile.(sono stata almeno tre volte al National History Museum a chiedere delle sopravvissute uova di pinguino Imperatore invano, fino a quando ta-dàààà tre anni fa gli avevano riservato un posto d'onore in una galleria, oggi credo che siano nella Birds gallery, qui la storia http://www.nhm.ac.uk/galleries/galler...
