The Captive (The Secret Circle #2), L.J. Smith
To δεύτερο βιβλίο καλύτερο από το πρώτο που ήταν εισαγωγικό.Έχει γρήγορη πλοκή σαν να βλέπεις ταινία ωραίοι χαρακτήρες (κακοί και καλοί). Σίγουρα προτείνω την τριλογία της L.J.Smith γιατί είναι ένα ευχάριστο νεανικό ανάγνωσμα με ωραία δόση μυστηρίου και μαγείας.

Halloween (Samhain) is upon New Salem and an evil spirit is unleashed.
Twelve characters were a lot for me to handle and i'm really impressed with the author because not only she manages to involve them all in the action but she also made each of them unique.I'm glad Cassie got more stronger in this book both in spirit and in magic, seeing the main character being weak all the time in the first book was not so fun.
What's also exciting is the fact that Cassie develops a darker side which made her a more interesting character.
Then ending too was so intense, i can't wait to read the third book!
When I review a book, I usually look at two things, first is if the story is good and second is if the characters are likeable.1.
The story I liked the story very much, the suspense was exciting and as they're coming to reach a conclusion I feel that I wanna find it out with them.
Sometimes I can't put the book down because I wanna know what's next.
The characters I tried really really hard to like Cassie, sure she's got some good qualities but I thought she was really dumb.
I also didn't like the fact that she's a jealous, insecure traitor, always comparing herself to Diana.
Το δεύτερο μέρος είναι και αυτό απλοϊκότατα γραμμένο, γρήγορο, μπαίνει κατευθείαν στο ψητό κ.λ.π. όπως κ το πρώτο. Το όλο βιβλίο σώζει όμως το αρκετά καλό τέλος του, που άξαφνα ξεσηκώνει τον αναγνώστη κ τον κάνει να θέλει να διαβάσει κ το επόμενο, εκεί που θεωρούσε ότι θα τα παρατήσει!!! Δεν ξέρω για τους άλλους βασικά πάντως εμένα αυτό μου συνέβη! :D
Read this whole series back when i was 13-14 and i was BLOWN away by it.... so much so i DESPERATELY wanted to be a witch... hmmm... maybe i just wanted Adam.... :)
Страхотна !!!!
◆ It's a quick and easy read full of tropes including girl-hate.
◆ The writing is easily digestible and the pacing is fast and concise which makes it hard to DNF.
◆ I consider this series to be the best of the worst.
◆ There are some unique twists to old tropes, like Cassie's decision making.
◆ All of the characters are unbelievable.
◆ We don't learn about anyone's motivations except the protagonist's.
◆ There is not even a response to people dying in town.◆ On two occasions the protagonists, including our main "good girl" protagonist, casually consider killing someone!
Ich bin selbst überrascht, aber das war....gut. 3.5 Sterne. Lassen wir mal Luft nach oben für die nächsten Bände ☝🏻😌
2nd time read! I must read the next book now! that Cliffhanger....😱 I am in love with this series again.

Now that Cassie is officially in 'The Club' and now known as one of the 'in' group at school she finds life so much better, she feels welcome and wanted, not like a disease everyone is trying to avoid.
In this book we get to see way more of him, he's a good guy yet also comes across as kind of mysterious.Nick is mysterious but temperamental.
And by 'stuff' I mean the good uses for crystals and herbs etc .I really liked this book, just as much as the first one so I'm pretty excited to read the next book to see what happens!This was written in 1992.As I was reading this book it definitely gave off this vibe of the 90's.
L.J. Smith certainly knows how to build the suspense. And that cliffhanger... ahhh Grabbing the next book in the series right this second!
This is book 2 in The Secret Circle series.
The tension is building as Cassie is black mailed into helping Faye wrestle power away from Diana.
Cassie’s grandmother also reveals important information that none of the Circle knew about previously in hopes it will help them battle the dark force that was released.Faye is one scary witch and you have to wonder how sane is she?
Poor Cassie finds herself stuck between a rock and a hard place and must decide if she will let Faye hurt Diana by revealing the connection between Cassie and Adam or hurt Diana herself by supporting Faye in her bid for power.
I love magic. The drama in this book is overwhelming and the dialog is very poor. Cliffhanger... so, I have to read the next one.
THIS is a guilty pleasure, if ever there was one!Rereading this series now, last time (2011-2012-ish) I didn’t make it through all the books, according to my bookmark I only made it about 4.5 chapters into THE POWER before I gave up.
TSC really is a 90s/soap opera/ teenage/ drama/witchy mashup thingy...which doesn’t mean that it’s particularly GOOD, but rather pretty bad...
Like a good old 90s pop song (you’ll sing and dance your ass off if it comes on but you’d NEVER listen to it at home).
Let’s hope I’ll make it through the last book this time around.
Even thinking about it now makes me laugh.The funny thing is, had this happened in any other book, any other series, I would've undoubtedly bitched about it to the end of the world and back.The apathy of the characters really shines through when another student dies and one of the girls says “What about the Halloween dance?” …“Guys, another person at our school just died and that's sad and all, but I don't want to miss the dance.
I love it more BECAUSE of it's flaws.The main character of this book, Cassie, did a 180 attitude wise.
Teil 1 der Reihe habe ich vor circa einem Jahr gelesen und konnte mich noch schwach daran erinnern, was passiert ist und dass ich es ganz okay fand. Es war leicht wieder in die Story zu kommen und ist schnell zu lesen. Was mich aber irritiert ist, dass dieses Buch mitten drin endet, als möchtegern Cliffhanger, was auch schon bei Band 1 der Fall war. Jetzt folgt nur noch ein Band und ich bin mir ziemlich sicher, da die Bücher eher kurz sind, dass man alle 3 zu 1 Buch hätte machen können.
The Secret Circle series by L.J. Smith was always my favorite series of hers so when I decided to read it again I was worried that it would be awful and ruin my fond memories. While I did find it to be less good than I remembered I still quite enjoyed the characters and story even if the writing style was not exactly to my liking.

Вторая книга этой трилогии самая адекватная в плане издания серии в России. В отличие от первой и третьей, у этой книги адекватный переводчик. Нет ощущения, что персонажи на зоне, нет обращений типа "Фейющка", "Шонушка" и фраз "Лорелина бабка" (так вообще нельзя говорить).И обложка эта лучшая из трех (ну-ну, из трех зол выбираем...)По содержанию у меня любимая 3-я книга, но русский вариант читабельный только этот.Спасибо переводчику.
Omg what the fuck?
Dupa parerea mea, atuul lui L.J.Smith este descrierea personajelor pe care le face aproape perfecte, in orice caz superbe e un cuvant banal.Din nou, coperta nu m-a atras prea mult;insa stiam de talentul autoarei si totusi am cumparat-o.Actiunea continua de unde a ramas, cu vorbele necrutatoarei Faye spunand ca protagonista este captiva ei, si va intrebati acum: cum adica captiva?
In mintea protagonistei este un talmes-balmes: este geloasa pe Diana, deoarece ea il avea pe Adam, insa ii era recunoscatoare pe deplin: o ajutase, o salvase de Faye, ii oferise tot ce avea si ea.Cassie ii aduce totusi craniul, si Faye face vraja...insa ceva rau si intunecat este eliberat.
Actually, a demon/devil/spirit dude killing for revenge is a lot more likely of a scenario.Completely easy to read by now, but it's still a good book.
This one is completely wretched in that Cassie get's blackmailed pretty much into a realm of psychological torture by Faye (who, lets face it, is a lot scarier in the book than she is in the TV show).
Every time I read through the 'reveal' scene, I get chills.
Probably because the first time I read this series I pretty heavily identified with Cassie and it all just felt so real.
Title:  The Captive Series:  The Secret Circle #2 Author:  LJ Smith Overall rating:  3.9 starsI liked this one a lot more than I liked the last one, the last one, I don't know...It wasn't as thrilling as I wanted it to be.
The main reason I think I liked this one a lot more was that it got more into the witch craft, we get to find out a lot more about witchcraft and the history of Salem.
I think for me, the fact that I already knew a lot of it aided my enjoyment.
As an adult, I see soo many issues with the story, (most notably, the nepotism and very cheeeeesy romance) but still, it holds a very special place in my heart and is the reason I read fantasy so I can’t rate it.
When I was 13 (1993) it was a 5 star read, but ad an adult....well, it’s pretty bad, but like I said, I still think the idea is really cool and intriguing but it could be sooo much better.
I might even do some fanfic and make it better myself :-p This goes for the entire series (all of L.J. Smith’s origins work, actually).

Not much to say here as everything I've written about L.J. Smith applies to this one as well. Okay, I do like the character Nick a bit. I'll give her credit in her descriptions of New England. They are very vivid and full of life. Smith does do a good job when it comes to describing the natural world, she's just muddled down with standard cliches when it comes to people.
The story is getting a lot better and more interesting and I couldn`t put it down.

J'abandonne cette saga, Mon Dieu que c'est nul ...
