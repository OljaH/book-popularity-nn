This means that Aryanization and Germanization of capital may involve expropriation, but not socialization, as properties taken from Jewish owners and enemies of the Reich were distributed to monopolists (or to the Party)--not the public or the state.Despite the self-organization of capitalism in the Third Reich (a process that was proceeding pre-WWI, NB), there is also the command economy which handles: “1) direct economic activities of the state, 2) of the party, 3) the control of prices, 4) of investment and profits, 5) of foreign trade, and 6) of labor” (293).
the first edition was written in 1942 (only later editions expand to '44), and this book is totally amazing for how much franz neumann was able to learn (contemporaneously!) about the nitty-gritty of party politics, state bureaucracy, and economic practices in nazi germany. highlights include the role of magic in european monarchies (takes up about a paragraph in this 500 page book, but totally interesting), the nazi attitudes toward international law, and speculation on the ultimate economic aims of the national socialists. it's dense, but worth it, as it's really stood the test of time.
This book offers an extremely well-informed analysis of the organization of Nazi Germany; it could have appeared in the late 1960s after decades of extensive archive searches, interviews, perhaps some first-hand experience, and bullying at least a dozen starved Ph.D. students.
The real explanation, Neumann argues, lies not in published books and articles but in the economics of German industry.
Neuman demonstrates how seemingly illogical German policies since 1933 can always be explained by the interests of major industrial manufacturing cartels.
