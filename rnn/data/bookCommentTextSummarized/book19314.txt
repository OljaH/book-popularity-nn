Before ReadingThe cover seems pretty tempting...with Greg standing astonished by the window...apparently with Manny ;)In Diary of a Wimpy Kid, Greg was 11, in Grade 6In Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Rodrick Rules, Greg was 12, in Grade 7In Diary of a Wimpy Kid: The Last Straw, Greg was still 12 and in Grade 7 (since the book began in January)In Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Dog Days, Greg is having his summer vacation after he finishes Grade 7In Diary of a Wimpy Kid: The Ugly Truth, Greg was 13, and in Grade 8Basically, Diary of a Wimpy Kid: The Ugly Truth was only half of a normal school year, since the book ended in November.Probably, I suspect, Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Cabin Fever is going to be the next half, due to what is drawn on the cover :)After ReadingThis one was different, for sure.
Like Greg, who is trapped in his own house due to a Blizzard.This one was indeed different.
Not the one we are used to where the school forms a major part of the of the troll universe for our Mr. Greg.Damaging the school property might be fun for us all.Well, fun until the school decides to involve the Police!.
Unprepared and tormented, Greg is hounded by the fear of being locked up for vandalism.The blizzard and thus the cabin fever being a nice addition.The narration is of the rarest quality which is a trade mark of Jeff.You are bound to love this Cabin Fever.
Cabin Fever (Diary of a Wimpy Kid, #6), c2011, Jeff Kinney Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Cabin Fever is a 2011 bestselling and award winning children's book and the sixth book in the Diary of a Wimpy Kid series, written by American author Jeff Kinney.
In 2012 Kinney won a "Best Author" Children's Choice Award from the Children's Book Council for Cabin Fever.
به مدرسه خسارت می‌زنند و «گرگ»، مظنون اصلی است؛ اما او بی‌گناه است؛ یا دست‌کم تا حدودی بی‌گناه است.
چیزی نمانده که پلیس او را دستگیر کند، اما برف و کولاک شدیدی رخ می‌دهد و خانواده‌ ی هفلی در خانه‌ شان زندانی می‌شوند.
1-10 I will say this book get's a 9 it is off the hook! I love the part when Greg was a Criminal but at the same time he was not. Also he had to stay in his grandma's house from All that snow! Also greg want a book singed by Kenny Centazzo but it was a fail. Manny(pest) was also messing with the heat in the house soo that he could get the heat all to hem self.
One of the best parts of this book is when Greg and Rowley are bullied by a kid who's in kindergarten. The part where Greg found out that his younger brother Manny is the culprit behind their lack of electricity is really hilarious. Can't believe that kids younger than Greg can pull this kind of act against adults. hahaha!
Mum: So what do you want to say about this?LRN: 500 stars!!!1!Mum: So, you've read all of these, right?LRN: There's more.
You can't run because when somebody was playing freeze tag, someone pushed that person, and the teachers thought you shouldn't run.Mum: Huh. I've never been a huge fan of these books, but that sounds like an okay message - that kids should be active, and some skinned knees are part of the deal.
LRN: I never want to be a teacher that's too protective of the kids.Mum: Good goal.
Do you want to be a teacher?LRN: Nah. Mum: What then?LRN: I would become a lawyer.
Mum: Another good goal.
I feel like I'd read this before the whole time I was reading it. I think Kinney is running out of ideas.Really? How long will this stupid franchise continue? Does Jeff Kinney not have enough money from his already existing six books (one which is just a blank journal!) and his movie franchise? Jeez, these cash cows are killing me.
Reading Diary of Wimpy Kid- Cabin Fever would not have been as funny as it really is, to me, if Archit, wouldn't be calling me three time- four times, five times a day and asking me to read this series, that he is now a big fan of Wimpy Kid.He is not someone who gets behind you and until you read or watch the stuffs he suggested, would not let you live peacefully.
I understood why he wanted me to read this series.This one would be my favorite of all other parts.
My son is 9, and he got this book recently. We read it together, and I have to say this book was so funny and entertaining. I've been trying to get my son to read more, and these are the only books he will reread over and over again. Recommend this to all parents who want their kids to read more!
Ένα βιβλίο με πολύ χιόνι, έναν κατεργάρη αδερφό, έναν μαρτυριάρη κατάσκοπο του Άγιου Βασίλη και μια απόδειξη πως τα πράγματα δεν είναι όπως φαίνονται!
I breezed through the sixth Wimpy Kid book in a few hours.
I don't know if I've paid careful attention to the others or if this one was just somewhat choppy in the writing, but it seemed more like a bunch of little antecdotes and jokes rather than a continuous story in some parts.
I did think it was pretty odd that Greg, who is pretty cynical and in EIGTH GRADE now, if my calculations are right, still believes in santa claus.
Certainly by fifth or sixth grade everyone knows.
And come on--even in the first book, I can't see Greg as believing in Santa.

The problem with Cabin Fever (and really all of the books after the second one) is that while each of the sequels follow the formula of the first book -- Greg repeatedly gets into trouble, but in the end, does something that reveals he has a good heart -- they lack the cohesiveness of story that the first book had; now all we get is a disconnected series of pratfalls.
And because they do follow a formula, we know to expect the redemptive act at the end of each book, and often (especially in Cabin Fever for me) these moments of redemption feel tacked on out of nowhere.
When pushed, he said that it simply wasn't as funny as the others, and he felt that Kinney was trying too hard.Despite his youth, I do have to say that I agree with him.
He has had a pulse on what kids go through and the twisted ways in which they think since book one...until Cabin Fever.It felt contrived.
He totally understands the self-involved teenager!" Instead, it felt like he was trying to reinvent the magic from the previous books and came up short.I wanted to like it.
Particularly popular with my reluctant readers, they resonnate with them because they are a reflection of themselves.
Greg Heffley is an average boy that goes to middle school. Greg has an older brother named Rodrick, and a younger brother named Manny. His older brother Rodrick is mean. His younger brother is annoying and ruins Greg's games.At school Greg has a bigger problem. Greg and his friend Rowley were hanging posters at the school. The paintings had paint on them. It started to rain, the rain washed the paint away and made it stain the wall! Will Greg and Rowley get busted or will Greg and Rowley live with a lie inside them.
How nice it was ! I couldn't stop laughing until the last page , and oh .. this little devil (Manny) was unbelievable 😂Some friends told me that I am (a big child) because of reading this series , but I never care .. it will be always one of my favorites 😍
Now THIS one is as funny as the early ones. I kept laughing out loud on several occasions. Unlike The Third wheel it jumps around to different events and things happening, which is when I think these books succeed so well. Manny is becoming a little holy terror, isn't he?
a wonderful book to read especially when you pretend to be studying for an exam that even you do NOT want to fail but management books are boring so you end up taking a 5 minute break that suddenly becomes a 7 day breakhonestly just read the book
Only Greg to have a brother like Manny. That kid is something else.On the 6th book, the fun remains.
this book is a very funny book for comic readers although it dosent have just picures it does have words
The one where Greg is a criminal and yet he's not a criminal! Funny incidents with the police - I liked it!
I was pretty pumped to continue going through the Wimpy kid books after I recently watched the movies again and I wasn't disappointed. What fun!
THIS BOOK IS MAINLY ABOUT A BOY NAMED GREG WHO WRITES ABOUT HIS LIFE AND SCHOOL IN A DIARY BUT HE CALLS IT A JOURNAL.
IN THIS BOOK HE WRITES HOW CHRISTMAS IS AROUND THE CORNER AND THAT IT IS A STRUGGLE TO BE GOOD FOR AT LEAST A MOTHS BUT IF HE WANTS PRESENTS FROM "SANTA" HE NEEDS TO BEHAVE.
(MOM SAID THE DOLL IS CALLED "SANTA'S SCOUT" AND THAT HIS JOB IS TO WATCH HOW KIDS BEHAVE AND THEN REPORT BACK TO SANTA AT THE NORTH POLE.)I THINK THE AUTHOR JEFF KINNEY WRITES IN A FUNNY WAY ON SHOWIN THE PERSPECTIVE WAY ON HOW GREG THINKS ABOUT SCHOOL AND LIFE.
I am 8 years old and I thought this book was one of the bests it made me laugh. And I will never find a book that made me laugh this much.
After reading Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Cabin Fever,I noticed that it was snowing a lot in the story.
I infer that because in a blizzard it snows a lot.
Plus I can predict that the blizzard will die down making it okay for the Heffley to go out side I began to think of the time that a snow storm that hit the country on 2011.
So by remembering well, the storm that hit the east coast also gave power outage.
Both of the stories have the same situation of a storm and a power outage.
So funny, I like it
Glad to see the Wimpy Kid series is back on track after last installment's fiasco. I hope this recovery continues and brings back the laugh-out-loud humor lacking since the first two or three books.
This is the first book in the series that I am reviewing and I love the cartoon like pictures, the expressions on the character’s faces and the way poor Greg feels sorry for himself, thinks life has dealt him bad hand and never owns up to his own failings.
Teaching his friend the ropes in Church and getting stuck going door to door after a snowstorm to make some money to buy video games, Greg is a typical kid that needs to remember that things do not come easily and you might have to work for what you want.
In Cabin Fever, Greg is up to his usual antics, but the story is set up in such a way that readers have a rare opportunity to delve more deeply into Kinney's nuanced protagonist.
Unsurprisingly, everything happily works out in the end, but what makes Cabin Fever so memorable is how the story line offers readers a chance to see that Greg, for all of his silly, trouble-inducing antics and motivations, is really a good kid at heart.
The way Jeff Kinney describes Greg Heffley is spot on for how it is with most kids, from the do-gooders to the trouble-makers.
Kinney really describes reaction in a really good way I have one reason it is when Greg comes home and forgets to wear his mask (he is a suspect he made green blobs on school property) so when the police come he let's out a shriek, and runs inside and locks the door but Rodrick opens the door Greg hides.
My thoughts to this book are I wouldn't want to be Greg it must be hard to not forget about the crime that he did on his school and it must be freezing cold when the power went out plus there was a blizzard I give this book 4 stars because it wasn't that funny but overall it is pretty good.
