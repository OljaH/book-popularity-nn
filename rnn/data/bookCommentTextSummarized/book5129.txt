I like this collection of the very earliest Peanuts. Charlie Brown has a sassy vibe that he loses later and we see the evolution of Schroeder.
Adorable, simply adorable. I read a few per sitting and they enever ceased to cheer me up.
Snoopy is a mere pup here. I read the later books before this one it's really quite odd to see Schulz's much more naive style of sketching.I love the illustration on the back cover. Snoopy's been 'harnessed' to a pull-along truck in which Charlie Brown, Patty, Violet, and Schroeder are sitting. Snoopy's expression shows that he knows he's been conned. Whatever happened to Patty, in her distinctive diamond-checked dress?
The characters were instantly recognizable, despite looking different! A great blast from the past. as I child I did nor recognize the talent and insight Schulz had, so it was great to meet hum again as an adult.
I am really glad that Titan Comics is releasing these facsimile editions of the Peanuts books. These bring back a lot of memories and I will definitely be collecting all 10!
A sweet little collection of the Peanuts cartoons :)
