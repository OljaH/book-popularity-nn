Swashbuckler disguised as Sci-Fi. The problem I had was that Crichton tried too hard to explain his premises, and ended up making a jumble that even he couldn't untangle.
The bad guys are so one-dimensional, they are hard to hate.
It seemed like Crichton was writing this just because it had been too long since he wrote a book that would "make a great movie!" (Thought the movie kind of sucked too.) And sure enough, it got optioned.
In the world of pseudoscience, the subject of time travel is always entertaining , fascinating and downright shall we say, fun...Imagine going back to any year, in the distant, obscure past, (reachable now )...taking a peek, looking around the corner , at the mysteries, seeing actual situations and judging for yourself .
The camouflages and technologies enable them to blend in, these aliens try to survive the strange land, of the medieval era..
and enjoying it, peasants oppressed , sieges, secret passages in castles, endless conflicts, cut- throat bandits hiding in the deep forest ready to slaughter, any who foolishly go there, the superstitious people fight back when possible...
The book follows in Crichton's long history of combining technical details and action in his books, addressing quantum and multiverse theory.تاریخ نخستین خوانش: روز دوازدهم ماه ژانویه سال 2010 میلادیعنوان: خط زمان؛ نویسنده: مایکل کرایتون؛ مترجم: محمدحسین ترکی؛ تهران، نیلا، 1383؛ در 560 ص؛ شابک: 9649600186؛ موضوع: داستانهای خیال انگیز علمی از نویسندگان امریکایی قرن 20 مهر کس در برابر نظریه ی کوانتوم بهت زده نشود، آن را نفهمیده است.

This was the first Crichton novel I read, which is probably to his advantage.
(see photos) Big fan, doodz.Anyway, this is a time-travel story, which automatically bumps it up a point in the storyline rating for me.
It's very detail-oriented, and you learn quickly that some of the characters have an agenda deeper than just wanting to go back and visit the medieval times.
The characters are rock solid and believable, and the story is a great rendition of a many-times-told favorite.
It's a very attractive read, and well worth your time.
Ο Crichton είχε μελετήσει πάρα πολύ καλά την κβαντική μηχανική και τον 14ο αιώνα, τον οποίο πιστεύω, μετέφερε καταπληκτικά στο βιβλίο.
Ειδικά οι πρώτες 200 σελίδες δεν προσφέρουν τίποτα σημαντικό, παρά αναλύουν ξανά και ξανά την κβαντική μηχανική, που παρά όλες τις αναλύσεις, δεν κατάλαβα απολύτως τίποτα (κατόρθωμα αυτό).
Συνεχώς γκρίνιαζα «άσε μας ρε Crichton το καταλάβαμε, μελέτησες κβαντική μηχανική, τι μας βασανίζεις;» (ναι το ξέρω ότι ο άνθρωπος δεν είναι εν ζωή, αλλά έπρεπε να του τα ψάλω έτσι όπως σκυλοβαριόμουν).Ευτυχώς όμως που δεν το παράτησα διότι μόλις πέρασα την σελίδα 234, ήταν λες και μπήκα σε άλλη ιστορία, επιτέλους το βιβλίο απέκτησε ζωή… Ειδικά το τέλος νομίζω ότι είναι καταπληκτικό.3,5/5 αστεράκια
I loved this book... and then some arse made a really crap film and the book lost some of its shine... I couldn't rid my mind of the film set and actors.I still quite like the book.
I like his take on the mechanics of time traveling in this book, it is more logical and believable than most stories in this popular subgenre.
This mechanics involves quantum science and the multiverse, traveling to parallel worlds set in earlier time periods than ours, through wormhole connections in quantum foam.
Besides the very interesting quantum science expositions early on in the book, once the main characters are in the medieval era there are not many scenes of people standing around talking.
I doubt this is what Crichton set out to do, he seems more interested in writing about the rollicking adventure modern characters in medieval time.
Marek, Stern, Hughes and Erickson are whisked to Black Rock, where Doniger's second-in-command explains that while time travel is not possible, ITC has utilized quantum physics to pioneer a type of space travel, sending observers through a wormhole to another part of the multiverse, where 1357 France is happening right now.Doniger explains that while ITC has been sending ex-soldiers into the multiverse and retrieving them for two years, rules prohibit them from stepping into the world of the past.
On the social front, you should avoid provoking "the butcher of Crecy" or Sir Oliver may lop your head off with a swoosh of his broadsword or cage and immerse you in "Milady's Bath," a brackish dungeon pit into which live rats are tossed now and then for prisoners to eat.This is the plight of the heroes of Timeline, Michael Crichton's thriller.
Like the entrepreneur in Crichton's Jurassic Park, Doniger plans a theme park featuring artifacts from a lost world revived via cutting-edge science.
At first, the interplay between eras is clever, but Timeline swiftly becomes a swashbuckling old-fashioned adventure, with just a dash of science and time paradox in the mix.
Not surprisingly, what I feel is his best novel to date, Disclosure, lacks the heart-pounding action and delves more into conflicts between characters, which I found much more compelling.
Unfortunately, it lacks the depth of character of Disclosure but still packs a good punch.
International Technology Corporation, ITC, headed by the brilliant but abrasive Robert Doniger, has invented a new method of time travel based on quantum technology.
Why is it that, in Crichton’s world, only greedy, unethical companies headed by greedy, unethical white men like Doniger come up with the best stuff?
This book was my introduction to Crichton and I fell in love!I fell in love because this is an author who does extensive research on the subjects he writes about. So he not only entertains, he teaches you something in the process. In Timeline, Crichton combines science(quantum technology) and history(medieval) in a heart-stopping adventure. A group of historians are given the opportunity to literally enter life in fourteenth-century feudal France. But this is not your typical time travel story.
This book. This is THE book for me.
A time travelling, sword swinging, science laden, probability speaking, historically interesting, magnificent tale!Even though Crichton is a popular author, I think he's underrated.
At least that's what I think in the two books I've read (the other being Jurassic Park).
I must read more of his work.
Anybody got any suggestions?The format of this book is perfect.
The way each chapter ended with a cliff hanger reminded me of George R.R. Martin.
It creates something that you just don't want to put down.
Absolute class!
Any fans of suspense, time travel or just thrillers in general need to read this.
Since there are over 1400 reviews, no need for me to list the details of the story. They're at other posts. Here's my feeling of the reading experience:STRENGTHS OF THIS NOVEL: movement, pacing, good concept, events are well stringed alongWEAKNESSES OF THIS NOVEL: characters lack depth, believability issues sometimes, not enough details to feel one is actually in the medieval ages, characters seem to get out of problems too easily (i.e. lots of other people die around them but the main people do not). OVERALL GRADE: B
(There are occasional trivial transcription errors, which can accumulate to become serious, so people make only a limited number of "trips".) Further, because some exceedingly similar parallel universes haven't progressed quite as far along the timeline as ours has, you can in effect travel into the past -- as into an area of the French Dordogne which Mad Scientist has been setting up to become -- you've guessed it!
First, if the past you travel to is in a different universe, how come someone stranded in that universe's medieval France is (as in the early stages of Timeline) able to leave a message that archaeologists can unearth in our universe's modern France?
Krajtona pamtim kao nekoga ko piše odlične akcione scene i čiji su zapleti intrigantni, na štetu likova koji su nešto slabije razrađeni.Takav utisak održao se i do danas.
veka sporiji, ali čim naši junaci tamo stignu, vreme počinje neumoljivo da teče, a oni moraju da smisle kako da se što pre vrate u svoj svet.
Vidi se da je pisac pažljivo istražio literaturu na temu Srednjeg veka (na kraju romana imamo i bibliografiju), tako da je svet koji opisuje upečatljiv i bogat detaljima.Opet, nedovoljno je pažnje posvećeno likovima, imamo standardnu crno-belu karakterizaciju, ali ovo je zabavan roman koji se čita u dahu, tako da ću mu dati četiri zvezdice i pored nekih mana.
2.0 stars. My least favorite Michael Crichton novel. I just never became interested in any of the characters or the story line.
The one who made me to love books.At my age when I read it, I was like  WHAT THE HELL, WHAT's THE MEANING OF THAT WORD .
And my goal for my life is to read more than 100 books or even more!I HATE NOVELS *coughs* not anymore.
This novel takes a group of historians, and test their courage, faith, hope, and the will to live among a time they don't belong and shouldn't exist.Timeline takes you to a thrilling, one-of-a-kind adventure who will take your breath in a deadly fight between their life and their timeline.
3.5 STARS"In an Arizona desert, a man wanders in a daze, speaking words that make no sense.
Within twenty-four hours he is dead, his body swiftly cremated by his only known associates.
Halfway around the world archaeologists make a shocking discovery at a medieval site.
Now this group is about to get a chance not to study the past but to enter it.
And with history opened to the present, the dead awakened to the living, these men and women will soon find themselves fighting for their very survival–six hundred years in the past.
Time travel gets me almost everytime!This novel was exciting and unique, I could hardly put it down. Cool quantum technology that I barely understood aside, I felt like I was transported to the 100 Years War along with the team that sets out to find the Professor. And that's what makes a good novel into a great novel for me, and Timeline delivered.One of Crichton's best.And I got a crush on Marek so that helps in keeping it on my favorite book list. I think I'll read in again soon.
Total piece of crap book that I got from a book swap. That said, while I did a lot of skimming, this was a perfectly fine book to read while on mass transit... as long as I kept the cover down so that no one would know that I was reading crap. And now you know that I sometimes read crap.
Because of his "hard" sci-fi orientation, Crichton insisted on trying to extrapolate an explanation for time-travel from existing science, his vehicle being quantum theory.
Since this is too complex and counter-intuitive for most people to understand (and some of us suspect it of being a bunch of hooey anyway!), the "explanation" doesn't serve much purpose, and does wind up being a "jumble." Time-travel is inherently the stuff of soft science fiction; the father of the subgenre, H.
(Crichton's villains use the f-word a few times; but rather than encouraging it, this comes across as a reflection of the kinds of bad qualities the readers don't want to emulate!)
It’s brain candy, fun to read but not very intellectually satisfying. Also, a character explaining away the grandfather paradox by just saying “nuh-uh” is ludicrously poor writing.
😍Con un finale che mi ha fatto scendere la lacrimuccia da quanto è dolce dopo tanta crudeltà.
L'autore ci fa immergere nell'epoca medievale e più precisamente in Francia durante la guerra dei cent'anni che vede fronteggiare francesi e inglesi..
Quanta crudeltà ci può essere nella mente degli uomini!
Avvincente perché ci mostra il modo di parlare per noi davvero singolare, i costumi e il modo di vivere..
È una cosa che nei libri apprezzo davvero molto!
Non ho dato 5 stelle solo perché l'inizio mi è sembrato lento e pesante e quando parlano di tecnologia non ci capisco mai granché..
It feels like the movie and the book almost tell different stories, or at the very least maybe they tell the same story in very different ways.
There's a lot in the book that either takes a backseat or isn't in the movie at all, and vice-versa.
I think the biggest difference is that the movie simplifies a lot of the book's exposition, and gives us more of the Claire/Marek story, which I do appreciate because that bit of the ending felt a smidge rushed in the novel.At the end of the day, either way you take this in, Crichton is still a genius and this is extremely entertaining.PS: This movie basically kickstarted my love of Gerard Butler, so I'll always love it.
After a brainy first act that presents a layman's comprehension of quantum physics, the narrative shifts admirably into a more traditional adventure story about a group of college students trapped in France during the Hundred Years War, who have to use their modern educations of the 17th century to survive and get back home.
In Crichton's articulate words the fusion of modern physics and medieval warfare go together like chocolate and peanut-butter, or genetic engineering and dinosaurs.I am obligated to point out glaring plot holes so I will say that the form of time travel presented in Timeline is compelling, but inconsistent.
A mysterious archeological site in France founded by the mysterious company leads a professor to seek answers from those who provide his research funding...
I would have given it a solid 4 stars if it wasn't for the laughable, cliché, predictable, standard Hollywood-like ending to any action flick.
This book that had so much possibility for the modern characters to struggle with the different culture and morality of the 14th century and during most of it is actually did a decent job, until that awful ending where the most morally questionable decisions were made (be just as bad as the "bad guys" because they had it coming).
Granted, it's only the second Crichton novel I've ever read, so perhaps I should know better?The premise of Timeline was strangely dichotomous pro/anti-science.
This dichotomy of pro/anti-science rubs me the wrong way, as I love science of all kinds.Further rubbing me the wrong way is a scene early in the novel, where the wholesome blonde archaeologist is viewing a ruin that is full of tourists.
The one saving grace of this novel is that Crichton has done his research.
I realize good research is one of his hallmarks, but I think it's worth mentioning to any French Medieval enthusiast (if you can stomach only being an amateur).
Timeline by Michael Crichton is a time-hop action drama, traversing the present and the fourteenth century medieval past.History gets opened up to the present as a professor is marooned in the fourteenth century medieval world.
An organization develops the technology to time-hop and starts investing in research around historical sites.
The science part of the time-hop is explained brilliantly, giving you the crux of the things without intimidating you into oblivion.The beginning is a bit slow and the end is way too predictable.
Crichton had me sitting at the edge of my seat in the second half of the book.
Another great read by the late Michael Crichton.
I always feel a little smarter after having read one of his novels because of his writing approach and how he offers nuggets of factual information.
These factual nuggets are what makes his novels so popular.
I don't read thrillers because I'm interested in how the characters are feeling.
I recommend this book to anyone who's a fan of historical fiction or science fiction.
It's not hardcore science fiction but it's definitely a great approach for anyone who's new to the genre.
I look forward to reading the rest of his novels.
