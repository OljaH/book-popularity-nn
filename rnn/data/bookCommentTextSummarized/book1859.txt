Ullmann's fierce hypersensitivity to these vignettes is striking – you feel almost that she is on the point of tears over the simplest description of a room or a garden.
The Country Road is a quiet and interesting collection, very welcome in its first English translation – a strange, soft-focus meditation on those moments when the simplest detail of everyday life can suddenly take on huge emotional importance, and ‘imprint itself on our lives like a fine, archaic script’.
Some of the most heartbreaking, mournful and beautiful writing I have ever encountered. For my full review, please see: https://roughghosts.com/2016/11/17/so...
It isn't plenty what she told through her stories, but since her words are exceedingly soft and gentle, you love to have her speaking to you. She understood the beauty of life and she was overwhelmed by it. Her observations were movingly deep and her words are beautifully picturesque. There is poetry in her prose and she had heavy sorrows hung upon her heart, seemingly. Her stories travel from one world to another.

I was ill at ease, because just a short way into my walk, this road had already dragged me into its misery and squalor.
It was an uncanny country road.
And the way that people use them … Some heap these stones upon what is dearest to them on this earth.
Ah yes, I know people who look as if they had swallowed stones.
97)And in even the happiest stories (like “The Hot Air Balloon”) there’s a profound sense of melancholia.The Country Road is not to everyone’s taste but if you like Chekhov, you may like Ullmann.
Pretty much hated this one. Each story felt like a slog, nothing really clicked for me in terms of the writing, and I never got into the rhythm of the collection as an overall book. Just didn't work for me.(tr. Kurt Beals)
I think this is one of those books I'll have to reread to get the author's meaning. Beautiful language, no doubt equal parts author and translator.
Skylight Books, The Coyotes
This book is a series of short stories that all take place in same sort of setting, some unnamed early 20th century countryside. Some of the stories are incredibly beautiful and insightful (the first and the last ones specifically), while others are more "slice of life" - which is not necessarily a bad thing. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who likes short stories with a poetic flair.
As lonely and lost, and as found in lostness, and as lit up by aloneness, as Walser, and now and then at least as funny, at least as bleakly.
