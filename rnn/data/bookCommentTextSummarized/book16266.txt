Yen Mah's memoir is easy to identify with: not just for those who have suffered domestic abuse, but for those who love reading and writing, for those who have ever felt out of place, and for those who have grown up split between two cultures.
Chinese Cinderella is dedicated to you with the fervent wish that you will persist in trying to do your best in the face of hopelessness; to have faith in the end your spirit will prevail; to transcend your abuse and transform it into a source of courage, creativity and compassion.And that's exactly what Adeline Yen Mah has done.
Some people write them on their journals or diaries, some record it through tapes and CDs, some tell their past lives from their grandsons and few write and compile their stories into a book.Adeline Yen Mah's short biography, exploring her childhood experiences, meant to be read and inspired other readers.
She wrote this book for teens and young kids to express her desire and sadness in the past while living with her stepmother, living without desire, loosing hopes and dreams and losing her rights as a child of his father.She was born rich and born bad luck because of her mother's death, nobody desires to enter her life even her siblings except her aunt.
She and her other 7 sisters and brothers worked in a factory before they even became teenagers, fought daily for food (if there were any, and even if there were, it usually consisted of bread crusts), hardly went to school (never attended university) and never had enough clothes and blankets to make it through winter.
What I'm saying is if many Chinese people around Yen Mah's age knew English wel,l there would certainly be hundreds of books like this.
They would all be able to have the attention and sympathy which they longed for, just like Yen Mah.
What is really shocking about this book is to read about the abuse of a child (the author) at the hands of her truly wicked stepmother and sadistic father (well, the stepmother is sadistic, too, so they're a perfect pair), and then to get to the middle of the book and actually see photos of these horrible people.
Adeline Yen Mah's story, however, is about a child's attempts to navigate an abusive household situated in China during and after World War II.
This is an easy read for an adult, but it's a great book to use in school both for the story, the linguistic, and the historical aspects.
I'm not sure if enjoy is the right word to describe this book, but I am glad I read it.Because the author,Yen-Junling, is blamed for killing her mother during childbirth, her father and siblings neglect and ignore her unless is it to treat her as a servant.
While Yen-Junling thinks of herself as worthless and strives for her father's attention and love, she gets positive attention and love from her Ye-Ye (grandfather) and her Aunt Baba and her school friends.This book was on the one hand heart-breaking to read but also inspiring in the fact that the author was able to overcome her neglectful childhood.

I understand that the story is from the naive viewpoint of a child, but it's hard to keep reading the novel through such a lens while characters are passively depicted as soul-sucking monsters whose life revolves around tormenting the most beatific child to ever grace this wretched earth.
This at its core is a memoir from one rigid, uninteresting viewpoint, and I learnt nothing, except that I would've loved to have seen the perspectives of the other characters to understand what kind of point the author was making.
I devoured this story all the way home and was finish with it by the time we pulled into the driveway with only the thought of how how hard Yen Mah's life must've been as a child.Adeline Yen Mah's story was heartbreaking in the worst type of way.
Upset that his wife died in childbirth, Yen Mah's father punishes her and places her into the custody of her Aunt to be looked after as a small child.
As her memoir progresses, the readers see Yen Mah face trial after trial only to pull through showing the resilience of the human spirit.

$6.50 USISBN 00-440-22865-4 Adeline Yen Mah’s novel, Chinese Cinderella, tells a story about her as a young girl, Adeline struggles for the attention and affection from her father and family.
It is kind of like Cinderella so if you don’t mind a good story read this book.
Also it talks about the jealousy of the other siblings and it makes you feel like one of the family.
You’ll get excitement, sadness, and angry feelings towards parts of the family while reading Chinese Cinderella.
Enchanting, heartbreaking, devastating tale of a little Chinese girl, Adeline.It is a story through the Chinese history through a child's eye.It is a story of the traditions that would change people's life and fate!It is the story of Adeline Yen Mah ..AdelineAn autobiography of the little Adeline growing up in her family whom are unwilling to raise her and unwelcoming her presence.
Adeline was capable, with simple words, to describe her world through her eyes and how each and every action felt and sensed.
Not to mention her ability to transmit all these emotions into the readers mindset leaving him/her with shattered heart and watery eyes.I can say no more but, I am blessed, AlhamdliAllah!Can't wait to read the rest of her publications.So proud I got to know you, Adeline.
Chinese Cinderella was a great book.
I really liked this book because it wasn't like an ordinary Cinderella story.
Their is not a prince in this story their is no magic, but it's about someone who is unwanted.
Their were some parts in the story that I didn't like but their were only the parts were she got hit for doing nothing.
Adeline was a girl who her father, brothers, and sister blamed her for her mothers death.
Adeline was treated unfair by her family.
Her father remarried a year after her mothers death.
Adeline's step mother was unfair with her and her brothers and sisters.
Chinese Cinderella shows how Adeline struggles to gain acceptance from her family and how she overcame the disparity and proves what she is worth.My favorite quote from this book is “Please believe that one single positive dream is more important than a thousand negative realities.” I like this quote because i think its very deep and is very inspirational.
Adeline had been constantly told negative things but she still managed to look at the positive side of things and overcome her shyness and prove to her family that she could do anything.
Chinese Cinderella is an amazing novel that is a true story about a girl who was looked down upon and isolated from the rest of her family.
No child should have to be exposed to this kind of unfairness.My favourite character in this novel was Adelines aunt.
Aunt Baba was a courageous woman who stood up for Adeline in times of hardship and unfairness.My favourite quote in this novel was "“Please believe that one single positive dream is more important than a thousand negative realities.” This quote was very inspiring to me and it should be to others as well.
I also read Falling Leaves by the same author. It seems to be a retelling of the same story. The author recounts the cruelty she suffered as an outcast daughter who is blamed for her mother's death. She is treated like a second class citizen by her siblings, her father and her new step mother. I found the details about life during WWII interesting. While not quite as brutal as some other memoirs that come to mind, such as Bastard out of Carolina, it conveys what it feels like to be an unloved child.
Different StrugglesHow do you make it through a horrendous day? Some people wait it out, others try to make it better. Personally, I just go to bed and all of yesterday's problems will be gone when I wake up. But for some people that does not happen because they are stuck in glue. Yesterdays troubles are tomorrows troubles as well.  The story of Yen Mah is told through the book, Chinese CInderella the True Story of an Unwanted Daughter. This memoir is all about the struggles Yen Mah had to go th
I would recommend this book to anyone who likes historical fiction and/or memoirs.Yen Mah’s struggles began when her mother had Yen Mah, after her four other siblings, she died giving birth to her.
This was a lifelong struggle for Yen Mah, especially since her other siblings would say, “She died because of you.
When her father remarried and had two other children, Yen Mah and her other siblings were treated as even lesser people than before and were not able to have the privileges the favored children had.
I also come from a big family with many siblings who quarrel A LOT.
Only in her aunt and grandfather did Adeline find love and peace.
Adeline's aunt and grandfather continued to love and nurture her where they could, but as they were dependent on Adeline's father for the necessities of life, they had little power and could do nothing to better her situation.And somehow through it all, Adeline persevered to find a slice of her own happiness.There are no warnings, except that this is an extrememly emotional book.
It does not happen without sweat, tears, and pain, but it is possible.I loved Adeline's voice.
I loved it to pieces, even though it was a painful (emotional) read at times.
I'm not going to rate this because I just reached exactly half way through and I have no desire to finish it.
It's sad that she is so negative in response to the circumstances of her myriad misfortunes.
My Mother-in-law's Mom died when she was born and she was given away to a neighbor and taken to work on a fruit truck every day while still in diapers.
She worked for her own clothing for high school.
I worked in a store from the time I was six or seven.
Lots of immigrants have to grow themselves.
This was my book report back in high school. I treated this book not just a topic in a report but an inspirational novel that burst the tears out of me. Adeline Yen Mah's Cinderella story is about a child's attempts to navigate an abusive household situated in China during and after World War II.
Many children and adults who have had a difficult or abusive childhood can realte to this story; it will provide comfort and reassurance that they can still live the way the Chinese Cinderella did as this book outlines Adeline�s struggle to find a place where she feels she belongs, being neglected by her own family, she finds some suport in relationships with her grandfather Ye Ye, and her Aunt Baba, but even they taken from her as well.
For the most part despised by her sister, brothers, father, and stepmother, she lived a lonely life, only loved by her aunt, grandparents, and playmates at school, playmates unaware of her unfortunate home life.*Chinese Cinderella* follows the early years of Adeline's life, during which she is transported from school to school, loved ones are snatched away from her, and the Communists invade China.I was anticipating a happy ending, hopeful for Adeline to find her Prince Charming, or an escape from her family.
This book is basically about Adeline, as a young girl, who is disliked by her whole family because they assume her birth was the cause of her mother's death.
Adeline lives with her father, Aunt Baba, her grandparents, her older sister and her 3 brothers.
As Adeline grows up, she is neglected from the family, but is only accepted by her Aunt Baba and her grandparents.
You can really feel for the author while reading this book and you can clearly understand what she is going through and how hard her life is.
"Chinese Cinderella" happens to be a true story about the author's own childhood experience.
Her family, mostly her stepmother, has given her an unbearable childhood in which she could never forget.
When i was reading this book, it made me cried because of all the unhappy things that happened to the author.
It must be really hurtful for a child that is without her parents' love and care.Another thing i really like this book was that i can learn my Chinese from it.
After reading the book, i have the urge to "relearn" my Chinese.

Very storg book. Chinese Cinderella is a heart-wrenching and sorrowful tale of a young girl growing up in a classic Cinderella setting. Treated harshly by her step-mother and ignored by her father, Adeline's life seems doomed to perpetual sadness. Every time something arrives to lighten up her life, it is taken away from her. She has to deal with loneliness and despair, but throughout the story she never gives up hope, that someday, somehow, things will get better.Quote: "Please believe that one single positive dream is more important than a thousand negative realities."
A friend wanted me to read this book as she thinks it is so great.
It is an interesting picture of Chinese culture about 1947, but a sad story of a young girl who is mistreated by her father and stepmother.
This poor young girl was not only shutout of her home—sent to boarding schools, but her whole family were so hateful.
There was some interesting parts about the takeover of the communists.
She ended up going to Hong Kong and I think she went to school in England, it that isn’t clear as her book ends before that.
Fairytales have the word fairy in them for a reason. They’re fake. There’s no magical castle to live in. No spontaneous singing and dancing with animals. No prince to come out of the blue and save you from all your problems. This is why Adeline learns to save herself. And while she may not be living in fairytale, she shared the same tragic past as one particular blonde-haired blue-eyed glass-slipper-wearing princess. Adeline Yen Mah or Yen Jun-ling was seen as bad luck to her family. Her mother
Adeline Yen Mah or Yen Jun-ling was seen as bad luck to her family.
Her mother died after giving birth to her and it wasn’t long before her father remarried a younger and richer half French Woman whom Adeline would grow up to call Niang (chinese word for mother).
In Chinese Cinderella, Adeline recalls her childhood full of neglect, abuse, and hardship through which her success as an adult would develop.
Whereas in western culture, people surround themselves more around the idea of being unique and doing things for yourself rather than your family.
Adeline Yen Mah, a very inspiring and respected women, had suffered a lot during her childhood.
Her mother had died giving birth to her, so her family identifies her as" bad luck".
This inspiring and strong story truly deserves 5 stars.
The unique and devastating scenes in this book makes it really hard to put down, making us think what will happen next.
This book will always be in my head, as it conveys a strong and meaningful message to always believe in your self.
I would recommend this book to everyone as it has a strong and helpful impact.
I found this book pretty easy to read and the story was reasonably engaging, but in an age where biographies abound, this one didn't feel particularly special.
Sure, the things that happened to her were sad, but in the end not outrageously tragic.
She overcame great odds to become the person she is today ...
but the story didn't stand out.
It's also written a little too simply for my taste - I guess because it's a teen book.
But for young teens reading it would be a nice easy read and keep life in perspective a little perhaps.
"Chinese Cinderella" portrays in detail the life of a very unwanted daughter (it says that right on the cover) and is so, powerful, unlike Cinderella, and you would love it because very few could relate to it, taking you on an adventure which you would want to know more and more about. never daring to stop for the sake of it's powerful portrayal skills.
i thought that this book was an amazing but heartbreaking with some moments of excitement inbetween. i would recommend this book to you if you enjoy unfortunate yet brilliant books, or fascinating yet tragic books. So basically everyone!
