I think this is one of my favorite books, simply because there is so much family to get to know.
I love when Grace opens the doors and lets us see a group of siblings coming together, especially on behalf of a parent who needs so much for them to manage things for a little while.
But all comes right in the end, and all that diligence and hard work, and of course unwavering faith (ok it wavers.
Truly lovely book with hints of a double romance.
Oh, I wish she had written more about the Challengers to let us know what happens next!
My favorite parts were the details of life in the early 1930s. :)
The Challengersw As a teenager I read many of Grace Livingston Hills books. They were filled with colorful characters who. had problems and the story of salvation. It m are me change my thoughts about religion.As a senior citizen I am enjoying them again. They are timeless treasures. Dorothy Keefe
I like these clean Christian romances by Grace Livingston Hill; however, I will say that her good characters are almost too perfect and her bad ones horribly evil, which can make them amusing although that's not the intent.
One of my favs.
Hill, Grace Livingston
One of the best books I have ever read! The family just drew me in and touched my heart.
