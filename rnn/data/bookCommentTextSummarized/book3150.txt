Awful all around.
This is my first Zane Grey book. It is more of a 3.5 star. It is a bit of a different western as it is set in a gold rush town. The hero Lee (Kalispel) Emerson spends his time defying the crooked men who run the town and romancing a local dance hall girl and a tenderfoot eastern gal. I will certainly red more of Grey's books.
I loved this book. Iâ€™m familiar with the background of thunder mountain and the creation of Roosevelt lake, which made this book easy to envision.
very good story as usual
Enjoyable Grey story about mining and the conflicts between men and each other, and with nature.
A good classic western with amazing characters and a satisfying end. Great summer reading.
I read this book after visiting Thunder Mountain, Idaho, site of a slow landslide that dammed the creek and flooded the town, as in the book. Grey visited the site also.
One of Zane Grey's best bang-bang shoot em' up's.
Interesting book of the old West.
