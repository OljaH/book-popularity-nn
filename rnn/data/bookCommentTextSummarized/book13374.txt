Actual rating: 3.5 starsI would have liked to give this a higher rating, this probably being my favorite book in the series, but unfortunately I think I read this at the wrong time.
I thought maybe reading the graphic novel for one of my favorite books would put me in the right mind to read the newest travesty that Anne has published, but unfortunately it kind of had the opposite effect and it took me most of a month to get through this.
I feel like maybe the artist was on a time crunch and just didn't have time to finish everything because it's all so totally uneven.
It is a very nice companion to the book, dialogues are exactly the same as novel.
But I was disappointed with artwork in many pages.
Don't get me wrong, there are AMAZING pages in this graphic novel, anatomies are beautifully drawn and atmosphere is perfectly conveyed but there are pages that happen to be very far from my taste and different from my imagination, specially regarding how characters are supposed to look.
There are pages that are supposed to depict the almost unreal and unbelievable beauty of these immortal characters and instead the faces look hideous.
Other than this disappointment, I found this a very nice graphic novel.
A "must" for any Anne Rice collector. Even if it does sit on the shelf after one or two readings.
Excellent!! It keeps all Ann Rice's original dialogues and mix it with a magnificent art work. It was a real pleasure to revisit Vampire Chronicles in this way. I suggest reading the original book first and then recreates yourself in this wonderful work of art which I know was published decades ago but still keeps it strenght and beauty. Love it! Lestat always will be a favourite for any vampire world lover. As me. ;)
I've read most of Anne Rice's vampire series. They are rich in detail, thought provoking, mixing historical facts with fiction leaving the reader confused as to the difference. The characters have left a long lasting impression and fascination for me. I have an eclectic taste for these types of book and they may not translate to everyone.
My favorite book by Anne Rice. I love Marious.
I am a big fan of Anne Rice's Vampire Chronicles and have been for many a year now and I love comics so when I stumbled across the graphic novel of one of my favourite stories, "The Vampire Lestat", I bought it before I had even thought on it!I really enjoyed this because it is a story I adore told in a concise way.
I did feel that the scenes jumped around abit though and there seemed to me that there was a lot of gaps to fill for anyone that had not read the actual novel of this.I was disappointed with alot of the drawings throughout though where people almost looked mutated (and I don't mean the vampires themselves).
When I learnt there was a graphic version of Vampire Lestat, I knew it wasn't a good idea to read it.
It's almost never a good idea to read a graphic novel of a book you like.
A book stripped of everything, but dialogs, accompanied by someone else's imagination, rarely can be as good as a whole one.But I couldn't resist anyway.I didn't like the style of the pictures.
Even some important details were omitted and some things clearly stated in the book were altered and not to the better.Overall, this graphic novel is marginal at best, and it is especially sad, because it's based on a good book.
Good thing the seller also has a copy of "Queen of the Damned" (but that's another review) so got my hands on that as well.Only managed to get Issue #1 of this graphic novel but it does give you a glimpse of the adaptation done by Perozich--loved that the book was reproduced in another medium.
Again, kudos since it's refreshing to have another interpretation.Although for "The Vampire Chronicles" newbie, it's better to read Anne Rice's novels first, even before watching the film adaptations.
Rule of thumb: the book is ALWAYS better than the movie adaptation.Book Details: Title The Vampire Lestat: The Graphic Novel Author Faye Perozich (adapted from Anne Rice)Reviewed By Purplycookie
I love the tale, it was a turn page I don't want to put down kind of book. I will scream "leave a lone" when I was in a really good part, is a most read for those who like vampire reading. Also, for me was a shame they couldn't stand up to the writing of Anne Rice when they did the movies. I'm not saying they where bad but if they would do a re do I am all for it... it's a challenge.:)
Adaptación a la historieta del clásico de Anne Rice.
The artwork for the graphic representation of Anne Rice's The Vampire Lestat vacillates from beautiful and haunting to confused and muddled.
Lestat is a rich character and the world Rice creates is lavish and enticing.
The ideas of traveling the world, exploring what makes Lestat who he is, the discovery of powers and loneliness, and of pointlessness, as well as the interactions with characters from the last book, are great.
It seems a vampire story should have some grand reason, rather than basically having superhero and super villain powered people meet, talk, and part ways throughout the whole thing.
It is a very long time since I read Anne Rice's original literary work of this title, and I found this graphic media format to be a welcome rendition with its dedication to a faithful of the dialogue and context. The additional visual images were of great assistance to a reader like myself, facilitating a better picture of the novel. But I was disappointed by the artwork as a whole and found it lacking compared to other rich graphic novels the I have read.
A well written book. Enjoyed reading it.

I enjoyed this but I prefer to use my imagination more than have someone draw it out for me, but I gave it a go and it was enjoyable but I am more the books without pictures type.
This was a lot of fun to read. However, warning...this is VERY abridged to the point where some events are not accurate.
A well written book. Enjoyed reading it.

After reading The Vampire Diaries by Anne Rice I really enjoyed getting to know Lestat better. I have to say I became obsessed with her books.
