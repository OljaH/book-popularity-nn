Actually read it from the beginning to the end the old-fashioned way: page by page, top to bottom, left to right.Perry Mason had a hit-and-run accident on his hands.
I have to repeat this: I did not understand what was going on until the last 3 or 5 pages: I am talking about confusion in good sense as in "I have no idea where to even begin untangling this mystery".
By this point (book 34) I thought I was about to get the series fatigue, but this one quickly dispersed such a silly idea.
As always it is great fun reading a Perry Mason mystery with the many twists and turns in the plot, and red herrings. Much of this mystery centers around developing the central plot device of a hit and run accident where Perry Mason is representing the victims that provides the backdrop to the murder in which Perry Mason is a suspect. Therefore, unlike in most of the mysteries in the series, courtroom drama, for which the stories are noted, plays a de minimus role in the tale and its resolution.
This is one of those books with lots of theatricals by Perry Mason and he is right behind the eight ball, to the extent of being an accessory to murder.Perry Mason is forced to defend a defendant he did not want anything to do with.
He doesn't trust her and has a lot stacked against her.
So, when he finds out he has no option but to defend her if he doesn't want to be implicated in the murder, the trio of Della, Drake and Perry play a pretty cautious game themselves.
What can I say? I love those old Perry Mason books, despite (or because of?) the shameless cliches, the utterly interchangable plots, the stilted dialogue, and the fact that I don't really care who done it. Every time Perry takes Della out for another "thick, juicy steak," I know that at least something is still right with the world.
Erle Stanley Gardner.
***.This is another case for Perry Mason.
This one initially involves a young woman who shows up at his office asking for help in maximizing her alimony payments from her ex-husband.
As a first request, this is easy for Perry to turn down, since he normally doesn’t get involved with divorces or alimony issues.
But…it turns out that this sweet young thing has had more than one husband, and she is trying to maximize her returns from all of them.
Then, bodies begin to fall, and Perry is involved whether he wants to be or not.
#34 in the Perry Mason series.
To avoid having to provide answers to embarrassing questions from the police, Perry cites attorney-client privilege.
Satisfyingly complex and entertaining - a good read.Perry Mason series - At the behest of Mason, who is representing a young man hit by a car, Paul Drake places an ad in the paper asking for witnesses to the hit and run.
To Mason's astonishment, two different drivers are identified, one by a mysterious letter enclosing a key.
When Mason tracks down the witness identified by the key, the young woman tries to hire him for a completely different case involving her ex-husband.
'There aren't any feminine angles--they're curves.'Fast curves!"Definitely has retro appeal, with its terminology like "frame-up" and "slick flimflams" and I think, at some point, someone must have referred to women in this book as "broads" (though it probably wasn't Perry Mason, since he's such a stand-up guy).
Also, for future reference: I love the saying "What the deuce?"A quick read, great for mystery lovers and Perry Mason fans (I must admit, I've never read any Perry Mason books before this one, nor even seen the TV show).
Not the best mystery I've ever read, but definitely not the worst.
I love the fact that Perry is still his reckless self--illegally breaking into apartments, stealing clues before the police can discover them....
But this mystery wasn't as intriguing as most of the mysteries.My edition also contained two Perry Mason novelettes: THE CASE OF THE CRIMSON KISS (1948) and HE CASE OF THE CRYING SWALLOW (1947).
THE CRYING SWALLOW was pretty dull--a break-in and some jewels are stolen (just a day after the lay of the house cancelled her insurance policy).
CRYING had the weakest characters I'd ever read in a Perry Mason mystery--there was absolutely no one of interest in the cast fo characters.
Sure, it's dated and pulp-alicious, but it's also extremely clever and the underlying mystery is a lot more intricate than its mere 220 pages would suggest.
Watching Mason obliterate his oppenents during the court sequences was profoundly satisfying and, again, surprisingly well done for a book that's, like, number 23,456 in a series.
Some people might not enjoy the 1940's atmosphere--where hardened detectives still say things like "Oh my gosh!" and "Well, I'll be hanged," and women always seem to answer the door wearing a towel--but I couldn't help but get a kick out of it.
Perry Mason represents a family who got involved in a hit-and-run accident.
Multiple parties surface who claim to be the hit-and-run driver!
Clearly something is afoot.
Then Mason gets a clue from a shady woman (the title character) with multiple ex-husbands, a suspicious typewriter, and a hot gun.
Mason has no interest in representing her, yet when he himself gets accused of being an accessory to the murder of which she is accused, he has no choice!
Hijinks ensue, and the reader is quite baffled until the end of the novel (where the resolution does not occur in a courtroom).
An appeal for witnesses to a hit and run soon lands Perry Mason in the middle of a murder enquiry and he must rely on his sharp wits to eliminate himself as an accessory.Gardner's writing is witty and, with minor adjustments, Perry Mason could easily be striding confidently into a 21st century courtroom.
Three Novellas (or short novels, I'm not sure) from the forties. Back then Perry Mason was very slick and frequently pushed the limits of the rules to save his innocent clients. These old ones are always a wonderful read.
My Rating System:* couldn't finish, ** wouldn't recommend, *** would recommend, **** would read again, ***** have read again.
Gardner's books are alway fun to read. Fast moving who-dunnits that keep you guessing. This one didn't let me down.
I love Perry Mason and Della Street! That is all I have to say. This book was classic genius Perry Mason!
But I don't like this one very much.This book opens with Mason and Drake investigatng a hit-and-run car accident.
Mason gets them to write out and sign a statement, while he takes the keys, dashes out to her apartment, unlocks the desk, finds the promised notepad -- and a gun -- and jots down the license number written there.
He traces the license number and confronts the wealthy owner, a Mr. Argyle, who says his car (a big black sedan) was stolen the day of the accident.
Great read, as always. Gardner is a master storyteller
I re-read this Perry Mason too, and think it could inch up to a 4 star or 3.5.The female interest is very persuasive and fits her title of the cautious coquette, divorcee Lucille Barton.
This Perry Mason has great back and forth plot twists and an underlying tension that others lack.
Ultimately Perry is led by his own curious nature and impetuous decisions to get into a real sketchy situation where a gun thought to be used in a murder has a clear fingerprint of his on it.
Mr Mason is thought by all of the news and police to be involved in a murder and they do their best to get him on it.
I loved, loved, loved this Perry Mason mystery!
Paul Drake has placed an ad in several newspapers.
He receives a letter with a key in it; the anonymous writer assures him that he will find the license plate number for the car in the accident in the desk in the apartment mentioned.
So, of course, he takes it to Perry Mason.
Barton knows nothing about any accident, but, she could use a lawyer in a dispute with her ex-husband.
If you're familiar with Perry Mason...at all...you know that sooner or later every case turns to murder!
Perry Mason is GREAT in this one.
Per usual some questionable dame comes into Perry's office.
She warns the boss and he takes the case anyway.
One thing that makes this novel unique is that Perry doesn't get paid.
He writes it off to experience and "live and learn." They've also got Paul Drake's agency on the same floor, and he's always been one floor down from Perry's offices.
He's always taking Della out to dinner and making sure they have a solid meal while working the case.
Another unique aspect of this book is that Lt. Tragg and Mason are in cahoots and chase down the criminal in a high speed car to get a deathbed confession out of him.
Typical fast moving story of suspense, murder, deceit with the thrilling trio of Mason, Della Street and Paul Drake finally solving this difficult and confusing case from the midst of not so decent characters and culminating with a face off in court with the DA Hamilton Burger.Mason wins hands down (as he does with all his cases). The story gets a bit convoluted towards the end with so many characters thrown in, however the web gets finally unwrapped in the court and the guilty are apprehended.
Would give this a 4.5 stars for Perry Mason being in the hottest water I've ever seen him in. It would be a perfect 5 if there wasn't so many crooked characters who had a hand in the explanation at the end, but the pace of the rising stakes make this one of the best Perry Mason cases I've read, so I will leave this rated as 5 stars.
Love these books! One of my favorite TV shows as a kid. This is a complex case with many stories intertwined. It kept me guessing until the end. Always enjoy a brief trip back in time, when you had to use payphones; and stationary and a typewriter could provide clues. Lucky to find one of the original printings. Have not yet read the other 2 stories.
I'm a sucker for Perry Mason. In my mind a see the Perry Mason and Della Street of the TV series I watched as a child with my grandmother. There is something comforting in the quaint expressions and the sketchy legalities that result in the innocent person going free. How could I turn down a Perry Mason book, albeit coverless, in the "free, please take" box? Incomprehensible!
I'm old enough to remember watching Perry Mason as first run TV shows. Loved them then and loved reading this one. It's just plain fun. Dated? Yes! Sexist? Yes! Biased? Yes! But also just a fun mystery to try and solve!
A typical fast, fun Perry Mason read. It's 1949, and the cars still have running boards. As the action begins, Mason is trying to get a settlement for a collegian injured in an auto accident.
A very enjoyable quick read.
Even favorite series have their weak links. The complicated plot leads to a complicated resolution. Perry at his most (legally) underhanded. Beware of people admitting to liability.
Diverting 1949 Perry Mason novel, written early enough in the series to be much more fun than obnoxious.
