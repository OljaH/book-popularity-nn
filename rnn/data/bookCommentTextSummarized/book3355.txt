Ska helt klart läsa böckerna om Miss Marple mycket snart. Underbart roliga och svåra som en nöt att knäcka.
The Unbreakable Alibi (Ett vattentätt alibi)I enjoyed all of them in the little snack size they came in and I will return to Agatha Christie's short stories, which make the perfect nightcap for someone like me who sometimes has trouble putting her mind to rest in the evening.
In her novels there are often hints that can help you with figuring out who committed the crime for yourself, which didn't happen in these shorts (which I guess makes sense).
The other thing was that the crimes appeared to have to be more far-fetched than usual to make the story interesting, while it's usually some interaction between the characters that make the showdowns so interesting.
Umm, it was kinda interesting, I didn't know who did it but I did know who didn't do it, I'd have loved miss Marple to explain how she came to that conclusion because Sir. Henry wasn't that persuasive, anyway, a detective story is always welcome :)
Den här var lite gullig och kul!
Everyone in St. Mary Meade believes a young woman has committed suicide after learning that she was pregnant. Miss Marple knows it was murder. Knowing that no one in the village will believe her, she enlists the aid of a respected gentleman who appreciates the elderly lady's intelligence. I enjoyed this story because Miss Marple didn't downplay her talents... and also because it was fun to follow the gentleman around as he tried to uncover the facts that would prove her right.
>> Random Fact: Sandford, the one originally suspected in Death By Drowning, is the same name as the brother of Mrs. Eccles who got killed in the short story Sanctuary. Just an interesting note. <<2.5 stars. Did not guess the murderer, but not three stars because honestly there just aren't enough characters in short stories for you to ever be that confused.
I was shocked a little by the killer. Wonderful short story and a super quick read
Inte en av Christies mest fantastiska böcker.
Good story.
ganska ointressant och för simpel om jag ska vara ärligggg
Real rating: 3,5 stars Sv: Vilket knepigt fall.
Jag önskar vi hade fått en utförligare förklaring till hur Miss Marple kunde lista ut allt det där.
Annars gillar jag idén med en kvinnligt ogift detektiv.
Jag har gått från att inte vara särskild intresserad av Agatha Christie till att få mersmak på Miss Marple.
Det får minsann bli en hel roman om henne snart, tycker jag.
I wish we had a more extensive explanation to how Miss Marple could have figured all that out.
I have gone from not being that interested of Agatha Christie to wanting more of Miss Marple.
This story has been published separately as an ebook although it originally appeared as the thirteenth chapter in the book The Thirteen Problems (Originally The Tuesday Club Murders) which I read about a year and a half ago.
Read too much bad stuff lately. Read all of Agatha in university. Going to go back and re-read her. Love all her work. Except for that short story about the dolls. Never touching that one again with a ten foot pole.

A rather common solution and in this case I would possibly have enjoyed it more if had been a little longer. Agatha Christie may have been at her best when she was writing novels. Nevertheless, an excellent read for a long, dark November evening.
Just picked this up as an e-book as an inbetween-books read, and I was pleasantly reminded of why Agathy Christie is one of my favorite mystery writers of all time.
Celos, un arma que asesina no solo de quien se cela, ni sobre quien se ceka, asesina principalmente a la persona que cela
A sad little short story Martin & I listened to on our way home from Park Rapids.
