By hook or by crook I need to finish this book from the front cover to the back cover.
I love Criminal Law (this is me convincing myself!) I love my professor ( I'm convincing myself again).
For example-- the book cited a case about frustrated robbery.
Another is in attempted murder-- the knowledge of the perpetrator of whether he wounded his victim ( like when after the perpetrator fired a gunshot, he fled for fear that he was not able to hit the victim and that the latter will retaliate, then the crime is only attempted )is not anymore controlling in our laws.

This is probably one of the most exhaustive books that you will read in law school. It is very verbose though in a positive note it explains the article fully. Read it together with codal and Crim Law Reviewer.
why i cant open this?i have to read this..huhu..help
The Revised Penal Code contains the general penal laws of the Philippines. First enacted in 1930, it remains in effect today, despite several amendments thereto. It does not comprise a comprehensive compendium of all Philippine penal laws. The Revised Penal Code itself was enacted as Act No. 3815, and some Philippine criminal laws have been enacted outside of the Revised Penal Code as separate Republic Acts.
