I tried to imagine - as I stood at LifeLine Bookfair in Canberra with a bag already bulging with books that required serious thinking, book by book - how that could work as the mix of Lawrence and early Australia could only, I thought, meet at the point of raw newness, exile or escape from an older civilization, youth and everything rampant that goes with that if the youth is lucky enough to have the freedom necessary for its full expression (which early 'unsettled' according to the history books Australia was said to be) and it turned exactly as I vaguely imagined.
I am glad I read it for the bits of Australian-ess that came through undamaged by Lawrence's touch.
Okay this is a book D.H. Lawrence "fixed up" for ML Skinner. I think I like DH Lawrence's stuff better. But I'm not done yet, so we shall see. Okay didn't like this book. Too much repetition and boring as all get out. The basic story was good, but could have been told in 1/2 the number of pages. The main character is a "freak" on so many levels.
A well written novel, engrossing and well-developed, but hard on the anti-patriarchal sense of mind. And not entirely earth-shattering or life-changing. But certainly controversial.
