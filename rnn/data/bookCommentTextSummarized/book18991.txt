Now if you are a fan of zombies this is a fun read with enough shocks and humour to stand alongside many of its peers however it does not have the same feel.
So for me even though it claims to come from the same time line (and even goes as far as to explain events and drops names like leaves in winter) it still cannot capture the same sense of fun as the first book.
So if you are a completist then by all means read the book its not bad- but do not expect it to come close the to the first.
این اولین کتابی بود که تو سبک زامبی خوندم  این کتاب تلفیقی از یه کتاب کلاسیک و وحشت بود و برام تا حد
Dawn of the Dreadfuls (Pride and Prejudice and Zombies 0.5), Steve Hockensmith, Jane Austenعنوان: غرور و تعصب و زامبی ها : ظهور وحشت انگیزها؛ نویسنده: استیو هاکن اسمیت؛ جین آستین؛ مترجم: بهنام حاجی زاده؛ تهران، نشر بهداد، 1395؛ در 500 ص، مصور؛ شابک: 9786009584727؛ موضوع: داستان الیزابت بنت - شخصیت داستانی - زامبی - قرن 21 م
Pride and Prejudice is my favourite book of all time, and I absolutely love to read all the retellings about Lizzie and Darcy (sadly, there's no Darcy in this one though *sniff*). While I admit this felt fairly ridiculous at times, I read it fast (considering I was supposed to do Uni work), and I found myself really enjoying this.So, if you think you wanna read how Lizzie Bennet (and her sisters) became badass zombie fighters, maybe pick this one up.
The fact that Quirk Books is the publisher of Pride and Prejudice and Zombies: Dawn of the Dreadfuls gives a major clue as to what lies ahead.
As more and more unmentionables begin to appear around the countryside and must be dealt with, the news of the Bennett girls’ fighting prowess spreads, and their reputations as proper Englishwomen diminish.When the invitation to the spring ball, scheduled to be Elizabeth’s entrance into society, is withdrawn, can the girls now ever hope to find proper husbands?
See, unlike the other "and zombies" books, this one does not simply insert zombies in the spaces where the source material lacked...uh...zombies.
This book simply borrows the characters from Pride and Prejudice and threw them in a zombie-infested world.
It is basically just a Zombie novel set in Victorian England.
Had the Author called the Characters in this novel anything other than the "Bennet Sisters", I imagine it would've been recieved better by those who cast aside the entire genre because they feel it is beneath them or something (I don't get those people.
Puede no tener una historia construida de manera brillante, puede que no estemos ante una obra maestra de la literatura universal, pero estamos ante un libro que te hace reír de principio a fin, con unos personajes exquisitos y encantadores, con situaciones absurdamente jocosas, y con un trabajo gráfico perfecto. Fue como un cerebro ante un zombi... Imposible no devorarlo de un bocado.
Literatura popcorn de la cual nada se debe pretender y esta perfecto.
When Quirk released Pride and Prejudice and Zombies: Dawn of the Dreadfuls, the prequel to PPZ, Austen was probably so angry over the irreverent use of her work that she may just rise from the dead herself.
I was a little uncertain when Quirk announced the prequel, primarily because there was no Austen novel to build the plot from.
I found that if I could let all my inhibitions go and just enjoy the book for what it is, it's incredibly fun, original, bizarre and fabulous.Set four years prior to the events of Pride and Prejudice and Zombies, the Bennett family is attending a funeral, when the corpse suddenly starts moving.
Author Steve Hockensmith does not take the storyline directly from Pride and Prejudice, he does however use Austen's characters and adds a few of his own, then mixes that with zombies.
The zombies a.k.a. The Dreadfuls, long since thought to have all been slayed, have now returned to Longbourne.
Pride & Prejudice is my favorite Austen, so while reading this one, I knew that Elizabeth and Jane were not going to pick any suitors, but I still enjoyed seeing some new characters vie for their affections.All in all, a fun book, I recommend it if you enjoy zombies and Austen spin offs.
Me encantó!!!! Me llevé una gran sorpresa con este libro, me encantó la narración, los diálogos, los personajes (la manera en que les dio vida el autor y no les cambió la esencia original sino que a partir de la misma las potenció) me reí mucho, me ilusioné, y no pude parar de leer hasta terminarlo. Lo recomiendo!!
In contrast to the movies, the first two zombies to appear in Dawn of the Dreadful are known to our heroes, the Bennets, and so everyone is thrown immediately into emotional chaos.
The zombie wail.' Eerie!Hockensmith is equally careful with the love scenes.
Through these entanglements, familiar motifs in Austen's novel of a woman's place in society, along with the notion of what true love is, are explored and make Dawn of the Dreadfuls timeless and universal.
Although Dawn of the Dreadfuls is mostly told from an omniscient viewpoint focused on the Bennets, some chapters take us into the head of Lord Lumpley.
Now, in this lively prequel, PPZ: Dawn of the Dreadfuls, learn how the hoardes of unmentionables became said menace, and lively Lizzie found herself becoming one the British Isles foremost warrior-maidens.There are going to be some of you reading this review who are going to be surprised that I decided to read this.
The resulting mash-up of their experiences -- learning how to wield battleaxes and practice the Pouncing Panther and remain demure, proper English ladies at the same time -- makes for exactly the type of story Quirk Books is trying to present: fun parodies of literature's Greats that hit the mark without being condescending, insipid, or utterly ridiculous.The best compliment I can give Hockensmith is that there were times, in the midst of the ridiculous Regency zombieness, that it felt like Jane Austen could have written it.
But as we read of how he holds her in esteem we also learn of a secret he holds concerning his own abilities.Close behind the Master enters into Hertfordshire a Dr. Keckilpenny who seeks to use science to turn these savage undead creatures back into the English gentlemen and ladies on which the British Empire is founded.
I would say that if you plan to see the movie that you might want to read the books which are the source of that.
Mr. Bennet spares no time in beginning the training in the deadly arts for his five daughters.
He sends word to the military and to his former Masters informing them of the zombies as well as asking for assistance.
Soon a Master Hawksworth comes to Meryton to aid in the Bennet girls' training.
The Bennets prepare for war against the walking dead and for the ball; because in regency England, there will always be a ball.Dawn of the Dreadfuls is set to take place about five years before we meet the Bennets in Pride and Prejudice.
I didn't know how I was going to feel reading a prequel of P&P without the angst of Darcy and Lizzy but I found that with a good enough premise, an already existing solid novel and the character development that even Ms. Austen would appreciate, I could get over not seeing Darcy.This book begins with Lizzy about to "come out" to the ton and the Bennett's are all assembled for a funeral for one of their neighbors.
I actually enjoyed this book more than PPZ; Hockensmith has created some great tongue-in-cheek characters and the book was very well done!This book follows the Bennet family as they discover the first dreadful rising (out of a coffin at a funeral), through training the Bennet girls receive, to the inevitable massive zombie attack.Hockensmith did a great job in keeping the tone of the story similar to PPZ.
I thought the story actually flowed much better than PPZ; probably because Hockensmith got to control the storyline this time and could match it to the characters better.
The plot takes some interesting twists and turns towards the end of the story which I really enjoyed.My only complaint would be at times the characters are a little bit over the top.
After a zombie arises during its funeral, all the Bennett children learn, that their father fought zombies during the previous zombie infestation.
Now, the Bennett children must learn quickly and take up arms against the enemy.
As a rabid Jane Austen fan, I enjoy reading most anything having to do with her books, especially my favorite--PRIDE AND PREJUDICE.
DAWN OF THE DREADFULS is no exception, mainly because I, also, enjoy cheesy horror books and movies, that don't take themselves too seriously.
While I really enjoyed this book, some Jane Austen fans might not appreciate the gore and, as stated above, cheesiness.
This is a gem of hilarity. Listened to it on tape at work and burst out laughing far more often than seemed proper. Mrs. Bennet's frivolity and all the humor at her expense was my guilty favorite thing, beside the random "dreadfuls" that kept popping up in the middle of everyone's polite conversations. Really fantastic, and the narrator I listened to (Katherine Kellgren) gave a highly amusing performance. Loved this!
Very amusing zombie story! On to the next one!
I hadn't heard of Pride and Prejudice and Zombies until I picked up its prequel: Dawn of the Dreadfuls.Don't dismiss it by its juvenile and badly designed cover, or judge me for saying that it was the first book I read off my #BigBadWolf haul, because I have zero shame or regrets.It's kind of unexpectedly superb?
Add to that, it was really well constructed, as good as an original in itself.As one of its Goodreads reviewers said, "I know these "mash-up" books are stupid.
This book simply borrows the characters from Pride and Prejudice and threw them in a zombie-infested world.
Who’da thought combining Jane Austen’s genteel Regency-era novel and bone-crunching zombie mayhem would create the literary mash-up genre and spawn a plethora of knock-offs using Austen novels and other classic authors in an attempt to cash in on the craze.
The unmentionables have returned after being vanquished for several years and Mr. Bennet a former ninja zombie slayer must train his daughters in the deadly arts to defend themselves and exterminate the scourge of sorry stricken who are among them again.
We do get more back story on why Mr. Bennet takes action and converts his daughters from genteel young ladies into ninja warriors.
Dawn of the Dreadfuls by Steve Hockensmith was the prequel to the bestselling Pride and Prejudice and Zombies.
It takes place prior to the parody, and follows the Bennet Sisters as they begin their warrior training to become master zombie hunters.
We also see people not understanding what the apocalypse is, or if it is really coming, therefore making the girls' training sessions into moments of social pariah.
I found it to be quite dull, and the action scenes where zombies were actually being killed were all stuffed into the last 35 pages.
I would have been okay just reading the first, rather than reading this prequel.
I wasn’t a huge fan of this book. At first it reminded me of a YA anime novel. It’s not that it has zombies in it just did not tickle my fancy.
Never did I think I'd enjoy a zombie version of a beloved Jane Austen novel, but...such is life. :)

Originally posted on Small Review3.5 starsWhat kind of reader are you?Look, I think this is pretty obvious, but if you're the type of fan who believes the original Pride and Prejudice is a sacred text that should never be tampered with, then this really isn't the book for you.
If you don't like zombie books where the zombies are of the hoarding, mindless brain-eater variety, then you probably won't like Dawn of the Dreadfuls.If, however, those sorts of zombie stories appeal to you and you don't mind inserting a little zombie slaying into Austen's classic, then you should definitely seek out a copy of this book!Funny and fun timesThis is kind of a strange mash up, but I thought it worked pretty well.
Continuing on the trend of -nothing-is-sacred-copyright-expired re-mangling of the classics; this book is the prequel to Pride and Prejudice and zombies, introducing you to the tale of how zombies first came to Longborn.
Because the follow on book came out first, and far more importantly because everyone knows what happens in Pride and Prejudice, it's easy enough to work out who is going to survive, and which couples are not going to make it.It's meant to be a comedy horror and a bit of a send up, so it works ok on that respect.
This review originally appeared at RevolutionSF.com: “And if you preserve genteel English womanhood while  serving up genteel English women as so much steak  tartare, I would say that you have most definitely lost."Dawn of the Dreadfuls is technically a prequel to Pride and Prejudice and Zombies, giving us the story of how the Bennett family came to be the people we met therein.
But the rewards of the story itself are worth the effort.If you liked Pride and Prejudice and Zombies, by all means give this one a look.
"Journey Back to Regency England - Land of the Undead". Now, I know A LOT of people despise when someone comes along and re-writes a classic tale with a bit of a twist to it, but me? I absolutely love it! And re-writing it with zombies just makes this book that little bit more awesome! So, you have the same characters, they all have the same personalities, the same traits, Mrs Bennet strictly focused on finding rich husbands for her daughters, Mr Bennet ignoring the majority of what comes out of
And re-writing it with zombies just makes this book that little bit more awesome!
So, you have the same characters, they all have the same personalities, the same traits, Mrs Bennet strictly focused on finding rich husbands for her daughters, Mr Bennet ignoring the majority of what comes out of his wife's mouth, Lydia and Kitty giggling constantly, Mary in a world of her own, the beautiful Jane seeing the goodness within everybody, even if there is no goodness to be seen in the first place, and then my favourite of the Bennet sisters, Elizabeth Bennet, who has the skill of a warrior, the wildest battle cry and is usually found kicking zombie ass ;)The Bennet sisters are introduced to Master Hawksworth, a master of the deadly arts, and who is to teach and train the girls the techniques and tricks to overcoming the
