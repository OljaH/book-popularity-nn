If you haven't experienced this version I cannot recommend it highly enough.Rather than a gory, blood and guts type of horror, this is a slow burning, queasy unease that explodes in the final chapters.
I don't think I could have fully appreciated what King intended to accomplish with this novel if I'd read it before having children of my own.
I had spent so much time prior to reading this book in preparing myself for the big "things" that I was completely taken aback by how connected I became to the Creed family.
It’s probably wrong to believe there can be any limit to the horror which the human mind can experience. On the contrary, it seems that some exponential effect begins to obtain as deeper and deeper darkness falls—as little as one may like to admit it, human experience tends, in a good many ways, to support the idea that when the nightmare grows black enough, horror spawns horror, one coincidental evil begets other, often more deliberate evils, until finally blackness seems to cover everything.
And the most terrifying question of all may be just how much horror the human mind can stand and still maintain a wakeful, staring, unrelenting sanity.
Make sure blanket is firmly tucked in at the feet - who knows what creatures might reach up to grab or nibble on them.
Glints of light cast upon objects are spun by a restless mind into monsters.It has been years since I've read a Stephen King book.
He is tremendously skilled at crafting characters, at making them human, at making them relatable in their poignancy, with moments like a father explaining the inevitability of death to his young child.
Deeper in the woods there lies an ancient Indian burial ground, that Louis discovers has some sinister properties when their family cat dies...It's no secret that Pet Sematary is my favourite King book, but this is the case for a number of different reasons.
My heart was racing, my palms felt sweaty, I just kept thinking, "There's no way this book is going to go THAT dark" (clearly I didn't really know King yet!!).
King's depiction of the grief and loss that both Louis and Rachel go through is so accurate it hurts.
All the good stuff, you know, before shit hits the fan.
Kickin' it old school =) Pet Sematary - The RamonesOkay, let me just go ahead and say there will be **SPOILERS** for those that haven't read the book or seen the movie.
Mr. King tells about moving to said place, teaching at the school, they had a cat named Smucky, their son was running to the road chasing the kite string like in the movie, but uh, didn't get killed!
Anyway, Jud is the one that has Louis bury Church (the cat) when he gets hit on that damn road all of those crazy trucks would fly down.
That ending though...This ended up being very different than what I expected. The less you know about it, the better!
"Sometimes dead is better".................KING calls Pet Sematary his scariest book, and I can understand why.
PS is not particularly gory, but definitely sad, sick, dark, and disgusting with more than one horribly "shocking" event that will blow your mind.Take heed if you're new to reading horror as this one will make your skin crawl and keep you from taking a walk in the woods anytime soon......especially if your cat is nearby."IT" is still my favorite scary KING thriller (especially the movie) but Pet Sematary (did I say it was "shocking") is a close second, and......."sometimes dead is better."
Once upon a time when I was a child, I remember talking with my family about horror movies.
Somebody asked what was the scariest movie you've watched, and my mom without thinking said 'Pet Sematary'.
I remember laughing and saying 'How on earth could a movie named Pet Sematary be scary?' Fast forward to now, I changed my mind.
This book is scariest and creepiest book I've ever read, and I'm sure it'll stay number 1 for a long time.
Most of us don't want to think about death, 'cause we think we're invincible...
Re-reading it now only confirms this opinion.When I first read Pet Sematary (I couldn't have been older than 13) I knew right away that it was more than a typical scary story.
King never shies away from character, but he really digs deep with Louis Creed.
But maybe we need to see it to understand.We often scream at characters in horror movies for doing stupid things (WHY WOULD YOU LEAVE THE HOUSE YOU IDIOT!?) and arguably Louis Creed does some stupid things in this book.
I loved this book!I’m so glad I finally read Pet Sematary!
(hide spoiler)]That’s some damn fine writing since it affected me so bad!But I pressed on and I’m glad I did.
It was so atmospheric, and I was on the edge of my seat.You just know at that point in the book that things are going to drastically change when (view spoiler)[they bury Church.
(hide spoiler)]I felt sorry for Louis and the decisions he kept having to endure.
She was a weak character, and I hated how she took her parents side and did not stick with Louis, her husband.And one last thing.
This may be King's darkest book. If you're goth, read this and you'll be 5% goth'er.
I read The Shining,  my first Stephen King book back in summer of 2016 and was absolutely blown away by it. Since then I've been reading King's books religiously to find the next masterpiece that could push the limits of a sane mind. Well, It took me two years and eleven more King's books to find it, and on the way, I met many great contenders like Pennywise, Barlow and George Stark. But it was Pet Sematary and the horrors that paid a visit to the small family in Ludlow that finally won me over
I practically snoozed through Frankenstein, and Lovecraft's Herbert West: The re-animator was fun, not scary) (hide spoiler)] For me, Pet semetery worked because King makes the characters feel like your own family, fill you with care and love for them, and then asks you the question: What will you do If you were standing where Louis is standing?
(view spoiler)[ The scare factor is not just limited to a couple of reanimated corpses or the Wendigo, but the mystery of the Pet Sematary and inexplicable feelings and intrusions the characters felt, and how they lost battles with themselves (hide spoiler)]Another reason for my perfect rating is the ending.
Well, I doubt that I'll ever have any other way of saying this, but after reading this book, my mind, is well and truly fucked.
It physiologically grips you, and Stephen King manages to get inside your head, rummage around a bit, and stay there, long after you've finished the book.
Pet Sematary is my fourth King novel, and having just read The Shining, I wanted more of King's works in my grasp.
After awhile, people started avoiding the water cooler, but by that time I had enough anecdotal evidence to choose King’s Pet Semetary.
Yet Pet Sematary is King’s choice for his scariest novel.
(Of course, King reads incredibly fast, so 400 pages feels like half that).
He is able to riff on ideas of life, death, and the afterlife in the guise of a horror story.
It seems like a lot of people first read Stephen King in their late-teens.
Maybe a King novel was the first big “adult” book they ever read.
Pet Sematary might be King’s best novel.
Two things about this book:1. It is one of two Stephen King books I finished on one sitting (the other being The Dead Zone)2. When I was a kid, I had to make sure the cover of this book was not facing out or I could not sleep. I didn't even like to look at it when I was awake!
A truly spooky story!!!  NEVER PLAY WITH THE BEYOND I was familiarized with the story since I have watched several times the 1998's film adaptation, but I hadn't properly read the original novel and since it's already announced a new film adaptation for April next year (2019), I thought that it was about time to read the book.Certainly it's one of the scariest books by Stephen King, in my humble opinion, not only due the main topic but mainly due the characters involved and their interactions.F

These characters should have taken a lesson from the old story “The Monkey’s Paw,” seriously.This is the book that really convinced me that hardcore horror novels are not for me.
I can't remember if I was already the mother of a toddler when I read this.
Those final scenes from the book have seeped into my psyche.
Like the last hundred or so pages of Outlander, these are images that are permanently part of my brain, that I really wish I'd never put there.
The two stars are in recognition of King's talents as an author, not because I'd recommend this book to anyone except true horror fans.
The painful, hard thing about Stephen King's writing is that so often, he takes something real, something that people can experience in the real world, and builds the supernatural stuff onto that.
It's gruesome, because anyone with an ounce of imagination can put themself in that situation, imagine the horrible choice: do I try this and possibly get my son back or possibly create a monster, or do I pass this chance by and never find out whether it could have worked?Stephen King is definitely not "just" a horror writer.
His horror becomes much more "real" because he is also writing about real things.This book hurt the most of the ones of his that he's read, and so it took me longer to get through it.
Stephen King : king of horror stories 💀👑'
Όπως είχε κάποτε επιστρέψει κι ο νεκρός σκύλος του γείτονά του, Jud Crandall.
Αλλά, ακόμη και τότε, τίποτε δεν είναι σαν πρώτα.
Ακόμη κι αν μπόρεσες κάποτε να διαβείς τη γέφυρα που ενώνει την Άβυσσο με τον Κόσμο.
Ακόμη κι αν ο δρόμος που ακολούθησες ήταν μέσα από τους φθίνοντες κύκλους που σχημάτιζαν οι τάφοι του Νεκρωταφίου Ζώων.
Α! κι αν είναι σκόπιμο να τραγουδήσουμε για να ξορκίσουμε το κακό που ελλοχεύει στις σελίδες του Νεκρωταφίου Ζώων, καθαγιάζοντας ει δυνατόν τα χώματα της παλαιάς ινδιάνικης γης, ας δανειστούμε τα λόγια της επωδού του ομώνυμου τραγουδιού των Ramones: 
It, Pet Sematary, 'Salem's Lot, and The Shining did not enter what she called The Great Book Closet (which was a walk-in number filled completely with stacks of hardcover horror novels, which I would inherit upon turning 21; she didn't die, she just kinda handed them over) until 1997.
After I finished the novel, I had mom rent the movie because I didn't think anything could be worse than the book, and I wanted to prove to myself that Zelda really wasn't that scary.
I suppose this is because I really liked Norma, and cry every time I read about her death in the book.
He left so much room for an individual interpretation, which is why this is one of my favorite endings to a book ever.I talk about how much I love King's writing style in every single of my reviews of one of his books, so I won't go into it again.
You just need to know that this book contains the exact type of writing I adore so much and makes me such a huge fan of his works.There aren't as many characters involved in the story as there are in many of his other books, but they all were well developed and independent, and they all left an imprint on me.I didn't know all too much about the plot beforehand, but I think this was perfect for the story to have the effect on me that it had in the end.
Note: I read this book in RMFAO's November Buddy-Read with some of my awesome friends Magdalena, Titas, Andrew, Kim, Stefani Saloma, Marigold, Konstantina Pap.  Pet Sematary is undoubtedly one of Stephen King’s finest works. I tend to be speechless when it comes to writing a review for his books, so forgive me if I write less than necessary, because, nothing that can be said will ever be really enough to praise this book. The story takes you very slowly through the life happenings of Louis Creed
You start to feel sad… very, very sad and right then something else happens that make you feel something more than normal sadness, a feeling of darkness that comes with death.Then comes a point where you just can’t take anymore and you stop reading it.
you push yourself to read and get done with this book ASAP and then, again, something happens in the end that leaves you sleepless for nights.No, it’s not a scary story, but it’s a really, really dark story that plays tricks with your mind and makes your skin crawl in the most literal sense - It is a Stephen King’s story.The characterization is Stephen-King-perfect.
Spectacularly intensely horrifically done. The forward by Stephen King was wonderful. I waited a long time to read this one and it was well worth the wait. That last 10-15% of the book was WOW! Excellently woven story. I love King's older novels so much! So great to read before the new re-make comes out!
It came to me that reading such a well-written horror book was legitimately one of the most primal, adult things I could do.
The Creeds lived on the edge of horror, and I feared for them.
The trials of the Creeds, ignited by the Jud character, and set in motion by Louis, were cruel, but not larger than life.
The other child, Ellie, was very thoroughly written into the book.
You know, I'm amazed at how much of the scenes in the book have not yet been exploited by other writers and by Hollywood.
What happened after the book ended is left open to interpretation...
Believe it or not, after 700+ books read (and I know there's at least 100 I've forgotten to review over the years), I've never read a Stephen King novel.
Then I read the book, and it probably met about 50% of those expectations in a good way.
It was written nearly 40 years ago, so perhaps that wasn't quite the right time frame, but ultimately it fell a little short in this area.As characters, the family was great.
Sometimes it was light and fluffy, but those scenes were needed to draw a distinct comparison when things got volatile.The main character often talks to someone in his head or talks out loud.
WHAT DID YOU DO TO ME, KING?Louis Creeds moves into a  beautiful  old house in Maine with his wife, daughter, son, and cat.
It's all different with Pet Sematary though, because even though I was reading it at 9am, I still got scared.
I know it's crazy, but King made me think of those things.So we have this cemetery for pets in Maine.
But that was in the epilogue, and all I got was the wife saying "darling" because he had this theory that Gage went crazy because he waited too long to do the resurrection thing.
What you buy is what you own, and sooner or later what you own will come back to you…What is there not to like about Stephen King’s books?
But writing a book that contains humor, horror, despair, tragedy and above all excellent writing; a book that scares you and gives you nightmares (makes you go check under the beds because you hear a suspicious sound and you are alone, or check if the doorknob is turning every few seconds while there is shampoo in your eyes during shower) and at the same time squeezes your heart and makes you cry; now that requires talent.
That is ART!!!
I sam je toliko bio užasnut onim što je napisao...e pa Stevo kako i ne bi bio užasnut!!Knjiga koju još uvek držim pred sobom dok pišem ovaj prikaz je verovatno jedna od najgroznijih, najgnusnijih, najuznemiravajućih, najmučnijih knjiga koje sam u životu pročitala.
A kada taj najužasniji trenutak nastupi, svako reaguje drugačije: neko u sebi nađe snagu da tera dalje uprkos svemu; drugi možda dignu ruku na sebe jer ne mogu da se izbore sa gubitkom; dok trećima jednostavno nešto pukne pred očima, nešto se u njima slomi i više nikada ne budu kao ranije.
I read this 2 decades ago and I can still picture the scene where he is talking about the ancient magic in the woods that the Native Americans lived with. This was a creepy book and it was a great read. Love it.
Što bi bilo kad bi ljudi mogli poništiti smrt?
Svi smo barem jednom poželjeli da drage nam osobe koje više nisu s nama vratimo u zemaljski život ne razmišljajući o posljedicama.
A što ako posljedice imaju visoku cijenu?Inače nisam fan horora ali barem jednom godišnje dopustim sebi da se malo isprepadam.
Jesam li se isprepadala?
Bome jesam.
Ali više od samih gnjusnih scena me se dojmila jezovita atmosfera.
onako za svaki slučaj ;)Odlučih knjizi dati veliku 4 samo iz razloga što su neke stvari ostale nedorečene, a ja ne volim kad me ostave u neznanju.
