The Gitagovinda, this poem by Jayadeva, is about Krishna and Radha's relationship.However, in the Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna the titular Guru says that devoting ourselves to God is a dangerous mode of worship in the Kali-Yuga (the Dark Age we currently live in) because the human mind has become so degenerate and lustful, and he recommends against this attitude.
All of the sections with Radha are very interesting, and the most beneficial for a spiritual aspirant who wants to find out what the "Lover" attitude of devotion is like.
The translators have managed to retain the meaning and the rhyme scheme of the original texts quite well, which is a great achievement, as translating poetry from one language into another is notoriously difficult.The Gita Govinda itself is a profound gem of Vaishnava Hindu devotional literature, which can be read on many different levels.
On the one hand, the collection can be seen as a celebration of romantic love (in this instance, between Krishna and Radha); on the other hand, it can (and should) also be read as a richly metaphorical depiction of the human quest for the Divine and the unbreakable bond of love that exists between God and the individual soul.Whether the reader approaches this text from a literary or devotional perspective (or both), I hope that the reader will find it richly rewarding.
The book was a requirement for my Hinduism class and surprisingly, I kept it because it made such an impression on me. I often need to get forced to read poetry and when I do, I end up liking it. Reading this in a public place at the library while taking notes though isn't ideal. I found myself constantly blushing and looking up from my place to see if anyone else happened to see into my head. It blatant eroticism in poetry style about lovers despite being a god because in love even gods can still get scorned by lovers.
Awesome blend of Eroticism and Divine Love, the best part of it is the Inner meaning of it, if you know the secret how to read and interpret it. Just a hint: Krishna is Prana the vital air we breathe, Radha is the whole universe and is alos our own physical body, the incessant intercourse of Physical Body & Vital Air keeps us alive, thats is Vaisnava phillosophy known as "Rasa" the incessant Divine Romance between Radha & Krishna.
This translation of Jayadeva's esteemed lyrical poem the Gitagovinda is truly a work of transcendent beauty. The story of the love and separation of Krishna and Radha is told in breathtakingly lovely lines such as this passage (my favorite):Wind from a lakeside gardenCoaxing buds on new asoka branchesInto clusters of scarlet flowersIs only fanning the flames to burn me.This mountain Of new mango blossomsHumming with roving bumblebeesIs no comfort to me now, friend.
Two lovers and their yearning for each other is etched permanently in poetry of sheer perfection.
There is no escape from this endless wheel of 'samsara' life and death because in Hinduism unlike Christianity there is no forgiveness, because there is no sin therefore sadly there is no hope."The religion itself has no sense of guilt, redemption or atonement, making it hard for the devotee in my opinion to experience true liberation that comes from being set free from 'sin' (bad consciousness).
But again bhakti has a flaw, like the Apostle John explains in the Bible, "If anyone says, 'I love God,' yet hates his brother, he is a liar.
Krishna -- the dark lord -- in Hindu religion is an incarnation (avatar) of the Creator, Vishnu, who was born as a mortal to save the world from an age of darkness and is also worshiped as a separate god -- an idea a certain later religion seems to think is its own original invention.
But unlike the celibate Jesus of Christian tradition, Krishna loves humanity -- especially in the form of beautiful cowherdesses.
The G��tagovinda, a late-twelfth-century poem -- contemporary with the troubadours, trouv��res, and minnes�_nger in the West -- is a lyrical retelling of the love story of Krishna and R��dh�� the cowherdess.
"Love Song of the Dark Lord" is an excellent translation of Jayadeva's Sanskrit masterpiece, which treats the erotic love of Krishna, conceived as a manifestation or avatar of the great god Vishnu, with the cowherd Radha.
It was this set of songs, I believe, that elevated an obscurish episode from the Puranas into a beloved icon encompassing the fusion of earthly and divine love.
Accustomed as many in the English-speaking world are to thinking of divine love purely in terms of agape, it is startling to contemplate images of ecstasy and passion for an exhalted deity, as we find in Jayadeva's verse.
This is beautiful poetry, encapsulating some stunning imagination and sensitivity.Very well translated and commented in Telugu, the Geetha Govinda of Jayadeva is beautifully written poetry describing the divine romance of Radha and Krishna.
The Ashtapadi's which are songs intended for dance performances, which incidentally Jayadeva's wife Padmavathi performed while he sang are sublimely beautiful.
I cannot recommend Bala Murali Krishna's renderings of the Ashtapadi's highly, for they are meant to be listened to, not read.
She is mentioned in Brahma Vaivarta Purana and the Brindavana described therein is called Goloka Brindavana, a celestial abode reserved for Sri Krishna's parama Bhakta's.
An excellent presentation of eroticism with spirituality in a time when such writing was a taboo for the society. Presenting the elusive Krishna as the vagrant human soul, flitting between the material desires as represented by the gopikas ,repenting his mistakes and desirous to return to his master (Radha), the book evokes the sense of divinity to the utmost giving a sense of satisfaction and fulfilment to the readers preventing them from thinking lowly of their god. Steeped in metaphysical content, the book is the bible for Krishna devotees!
Gitagovinda is an important text in medieval Indian literature cus it was used/ recited by Krishna cults in east Indian temples. Miller's introduction is so comprehensive, it sheds light on all aspects of the text.
LAST RLY GOOD THING YOU WATCHED/READ.
A beautiful translation with a helpful introduction and tons of notes that are easily ignored. Gorgeous verse. I'm off to see if I can find performance recordings.
