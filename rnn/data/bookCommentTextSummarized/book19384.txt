3.5 stars10 Reasons to Love Kate Daniels:1.
She knows all the rules of diplomacy when dealing with shapeshifters, vampires, and other supernaturals.4.
She knows how to break all those rules and commands respect in spite of it.5.
But she won't hesitate to call them out if she thinks they're crossing the line.8.
She kicks serious ass, with or without magic.I have a hit-or-miss track record with most urban fantasy books that I've tried, but I think Kate and I are going to get along just fine.
Can't wait to read the next book!
When I'm harassing people for feedback, they've all liked MAGIC BITES enough to read the next book, which is good b/c unlike most series, this one just keeps getting better.
I can't be completely objective, b/c looking back after reading the series five(+) times .
hindsight is, after all, 20/20.The basic premise is brand new: the world began with magic and technology existing in a harmonious balance.
He would do it and move on, untroubled by ending my existence.It scared the shit out of me, so I laughed in his face.
I wish I was Kate Daniels.My other reviews for this series:
Magic Shifts (Kate Daniels, #8)
Did you ever look around and say, "Where the hell are all these assholes coming from?"Well, if Curran turned your oven on then the answer is possibly: You!Yes, that's right.
You have no idea how happy I was when she didn't!I did like her better than Anita though as she had moments of maturity when she decided that tough talk and threats of violence weren't really conducive to what she needed and thus backed down and recognized that she can't defeat evil with her badassery alone (Anita will never discover this because even if she died, she'd just seduce God and steal his powers and then we'd ALL be in a lot of trouble!)Also, when the chips were down, she got drunk, sat on her porch and DARED the world to come and get her.
“These were unsafe times. But then in safer times, I'd be a woman without a job. The safe-tech world had little use for a magic-touting mercenary like me.”  Welcome to a world where magic and technology fight to gain the upper hand.

Welcome to a world where magic and technology fight to gain the upper hand.
Meet Curran, also known as sex-on-a-stick.While romance isn't the main focus of Magic Bites, you can sense that things will get intimate between Kate and Curran because holy.hawt.chemistry.Batman!
They barely tolerate each other because they're so much alike, and they constantly bicker and that's why when they finally get together I expect explosions and fireworks!If you're in the mood for a darker urban fantasy book full of blood and gore, then don't hesitate to grab the Kate Daniels series!Instagram | Twitter | Facebook | BookNest
She read it to find out who this mysterious "Beast Lord" was, and why everyone thought that Kate and Curran were the best urban fantasy couple.
Kate Daniels is one of the best urban fantasy heroines I've had the pleasure to meet.
In fact, she lightly and skillfully builds a storyline that is credible and interesting around the tendrils of magic power wielded in different ways by many of the characters in this novel.
But if you tend to enjoy the lighter urban fantasy stories, you'd want to be prepared when you read this one.
I mean...wow!So, I originally read this (at the prompting of my BFF) back in 2010, and was so underwhelmed it took me 4 years to pick up the second book.
Now that I know what the world is like, see where all of this is going with Kate and Curran, know what's up with all of the cryptic references to her father and her blood, and recognize characters that will become important staples in this universe in later books - it wasn't chore to get through it.However.I still say this is one of the worst intro books ever.
But there's still a teeny-tiny part of my brain that realizes this book was boring enough that it took me 7 years to bring myself to do a re-read.I wish I could just be like, 
Curran, where have you been all my life?Because he simply stole my heart from the very beginning. And I’m usually not even into shapeshifters!Must be due to his sense of humour, handsomeness and, of course, alpha personality and status. His Majesty Curran,  The chosen Lord of Free Beasts,  Requests your presence at the meeting of his Pack  At 22:00 of this night. Damn you, lucky Kate. I wish I could pay him a visit myself. “Oh, it's you," Curran's voice said quietly. "I thought it was an elephan
“Oh, it's you," Curran's voice said quietly.
She was completely unpredictable, a little reckless sometimes I admit, but definitely entertaining and intelligent too.The world-building is one of the things I liked best about this first book in a series, along with every element composing it, such as the characters, the different types of supernatural creatures, the magic which was fitting the plot well, the mystery which held me captive until the very last page, the pacing that was at a perfect speed and the little bit of romance that the author aloud us to witness.

Unfortunately, I will have to put "Magic Bites" into the pile of urban fantasy I doubt I will ever get back to, along with Richelle Mead's "Storm Born" and Patricia Briggs' "Moon Called."The weakest part of the book is definitely the writing.
A perfect example is the opening scene of "Magic Bites" where Kate throws a knife into a vampire's throat and then this vampire starts talking to her in a voice of some other character.
No luck here unfortunately.Patricia Briggs calls "Magic Bites" "an edgy, dark fantasy, touched with just the right amount of humor" in her blurb on the book cover.

Sale Alert: This is one of my all time favorite UF series and books 1 and 4 are currently on sale 9/30/17 at amazon $2.99Kate Daniels Buddy Read/Reread starts April 27 with the gang at Ilona Andrews Addicts (IAA)Let the fun and games begin, Yes it is still only a 3.5 star read but I really enjoyed it all over again.
I enjoyed the beginning a little more because I understand the magic or this world and I could focus on other details this time around.The 7th book Magic Breaks will be out the end of July and it completes an entire plot arc so if you are looking for a fun PRN/UF series I highly suggest this one, cheesy Narnia-esk cover not-with-standing .
It wasn't until recently that I had even heard of Ilona Andrews, and that was through reviews I'd seen here on Goodreads from reviewers like Jessica (Rabid Reads), Lola, and Sharon is an Emotional Book Junkie (so thank you ladies!)  “I gave him my best cryptic smile.
Ilona Andrews gave the reader the chance to use their intelligence and I greatly appreciated it.Curran.
There wasn't exactly a romance between Kate and Curran, but there is a tangible sexual tension that made me giggle and smile whenever they had scenes together in the book.
I don't know why I kept reading past chapter 2, but I did.
It could have been the astounding number of high reviews from my friends, but nah, it usually doesn't influence me.
Vacations!' effect, or maybe I'm not a quitter - *bursts of laughing* Nah, it must be the book.

Well, I know this world and Kate so well now that I expected a magical wonderland when I read it again.
But, we are never actually given a reason why the world changed from what we know now to a magic-infested one.
It's never the way you remembered it.Do I still love Kate Daniels and everything else written by Ilona Andrews?
It is still an amazing series and Kate is still my favorite girl.
And, I still want everyone to read this series.
Just, maybe give it a couple of books, and then the magic will happen.
Okay, okay... I admit the book was good and I was terribly wrong for not reading it sooner! All my fears were misplaced!!Possible Spoilers coming up “He finished the bandage and was examining it critically."You know those things are unreliable." His voice held just a touch of reproach.“Eleven out of twelve work fine. I’d say that’s better chances than getting an orgasm with a blind date and women still try.”  Kate is brilliant!

A little cocky at the beginning of the book but she gets over it after the first two hundred disasters.
I love Curran.
I can write all the reasons but in the end it comes down to gorgeous, arrogant, no emotional baggage, no scarred hero just male awesomeness.I liked the supportive characters all except Crest.
I look forward to the next ones and knowing what exactly Kate is!*happy dance*(love the gif)************02/03/2014 UPDATE************(view spoiler)[I don't get why Curran was inclined to believe Kate only if Crest was the bad guy.
She wasn't the one who said that Crest was the one.

But her investigation becomes increasingly dangerous to herself and those who are helping her.Magic Bites is basically a detective story set in an urban fantasy world, complete with vampires and werewolves, but they're vampires and werewolves (or, more accurately, shapechangers, since many of them are not wolves but rats, leopards, lions, etc.) like I've never seen or read about before.
I'm giving it four stars because the world-building with the fantasy part of the story is done so well.
Vampires, for example, are near-mindless automatons controlled by humans who are trained to do so:.
I don’t know that I have ever said I wished that an UF novel was longer, but in this case I do because with the added length it may have been easier to show me (rather than tell me) the differences between Kate’s world and my own world.
I never felt like this story was awkward or forced, in any way.
I can’t say how much I appreciate having a convoluted story that feels like a natural web of moments weaving themselves into a conclusion of a mystery, it is a very lovely talent to possess.
He gave me a puzzled look.
the solution to that creates yet another.the false-denoument was a nice touch, but a little too early—a quick glance at my reading progress made it easy to dismiss the neatly 'solved' mystery immediately.but man.you spend all your time reading amateur stuff and struggling with your own amateur stuff—and then you read a thing, and you see who published it, and how many reviews it has, and what the ratings average is, and how many books came after it...and you just know.you can tell right away.
The always amazing and wonderful Tinja has convinced me to try the audiobook versions of the Kate Daniels series. If I try to sneakily listen to audiobooks while I'm at the office like this guy, do you think anyone will catch on?!? Come to think of it, the headphones might just be a bit of a tip-off...
I decided to read this series alternating with the rest of Mercy Thompson, in part to make Mercy last longer, but also because I'm scared of what the scary folks at IAA might do if I don't get caught up with Kate Daniels soon.
I had just found out that you can add people as friends (yep, took me a few years...Buddy reading literally blew my mind!) and I was minding my own business, reading fantasy books as usual.When suddenly, a new message started popping out:And that's how I found out about a series called Kate Daniels.
*flies away to another galaxy*THE END ...I really really really wanted to LOVE this book, to go crazy about the romance between Kate and Curran, to swoon over the Beast Lord like everybody else, to be completely emerged in this post-apocalyptic world, where magic is real and monsters lurk at every corner.
Magic could not be measured and explained in scientific terms, for magic grew through destroying the very natural principles that made science as people knew it possible.  Originally, I wasn't going to write a review for this. Before going into this book, I didn't expect much. I never knew and heard of this series and the author until I saw one review, and then another, and another, and kept seeing more reviews and friends adding this book/series to their shelf so I was just interested. I also
She doesn't do this by herself, of course she's gonna get some help from others like her new friend, Curran, also known as the Lord of the Beasts, a sexy but arrogant shape-shifter bastard who Kate grows accustomed to.
She wasn't relatable, but she was a character I felt bad for because she has no one with her or by her side (yes I know that changes throughout the series; Curran, Derek, Julie, etc,.).I was told you might just fall in love with Curran's character right when you meet him, but that didn't happen with me.
And I think we've only touched the surface when it comes to the magic she can wield.I kept thinking that when Kate met the Beast Lord a.k.a. Curran, he would have a long mane of golden hair — you know, because he's a lion shapechanger — well, if it had turned out that way, that would've undoubtedly been the end for me.
Still, I enjoy a little romance in my reading, so I'm interested to see if anything arises between Kate and Curran one of the men in her life in the next installment.

I got indoctrinated almost two years ago with the Hidden Legacy series (BURN FOR ME was the book that got me back into urban fantasy).
™, I finally found my way to reading the much-hyped and very intimidating Kate Daniels series.
And as fun as Kate Daniels is, she doesn't have the emotional depth and aching humanity that made Nevada such a treat (and made her gradual transformation over the course of the three books that much more addictive and investing, as a result).
By the time this book was published, Jim Butcher's Dresden Files series was already well-known with quite a lot of writers trying to copy it with the various degree of success.
For this reason I will compare these two.Here we have a female protagonist Kate Daniels who happened to be a mercenary who makes her living cleaning up magical problems.
For me this set up was much more believable than Dresden's where people live side-by-side with magic and just choose to ignore it exists.
These attributes remain in place throughout the novel, so it’s fair to say my disappointment comes down to a specific issue: the development of the love story (or lack thereof).Frankly, for the first half of the book, I wasn’t sure who the love interest was supposed to be, which is just fine with me because the protagonist had a few viable options and I was actually looking forward to seeing how (and if) the sparks would begin to generate.
Nope… It really happened that fast.It’s probably because I’ve tried so many urban fantasies that I’ve come to expect strong relationship development within them, even if it’s not the main focus of the story.
I'd been putting this book off for a while because a lot of people compared Kate to Anita Blake and I didn't think I could handle dealing with another emotionally crippled main character, even if she was a bad ass.
While I agree that there are a lot of similarities between the two (ass kickery, gross amounts of natural magical talent, smart aleckness) I was pleasantly surprised that Kate didn't come with Anita's pitfalls.
I liked it and will continue the series while praying that Kate's vagina doesn't turn into some magical disneyland that all the men in the series line up to get in to (Anita!).
That’s my shiny hook!"Magic Bites" has a lot romantic and sexy tension and hints, but no quick I’m-in-love-and-ready-to-get-my-HEA and that’s what I adore in books, no quick and simple love, no end up Married With Kids‘cause too much love can kill (my fangirling and etc.) Reading this book, I got a tasty candy, containing a full start-to-finish thrilling adventure with a mysterious murder, long term love-to-be relationship, mysterious magical background of the main character, interesting and gripping world building with secret and dangerous organizations and some hints for future plotlines with passion, intrigues and fast pace.
Your friendly neighbourhood Spiderman.Awesome!To sum up, "Magic Bites" is a quick-paced, fun, magical ride with Kate Daniels as your main entertainer.
Well like I said before, this will only be a little rambling because trust me, I have tons of friends who's reviews are a lot more awesome than the one I could come up with right now.
I'm pretty sure that has to do with my reading slump but, maybe, it also had to do with the way the story was told.
Like:➞How did magic come to be?➞Are we talking Atlanta, Georgia?➞And if we are, what the heck happened to the world?➞Is it called feylanterns because there are Fey somewhere?Another thing is, this is slow.
I didn't think I could ever say something like this, but this book brought me to the point of craving an info-dump: important notions regarding the world Kate and the other characters move in are taken for granted, leaving the readers at their guess, other things are only hinted, the most disparate pieces of information are provided here and here forming a larger picture with too little order in it to seem uniform and consistent.
Any other adjective would be superfluous, but I have never been a girl of few words and have no intention to become one anytime soon, so: you know when a ya fantasy/sci-fi book promise you a kick-ass heroine, right?
In fact, I do rather like how the SF features of the world don't play nicely with the magical, and vice-versa.
Like I said, a decent introduction.
I probably wouldn't have cared enough to continue with the series based on this, alone, but because there's a TON of rave reviews surround this whole series and because I know that UF in general has this problem of slow-starting, I really don't have any problems being patient.It's not like the setup is bad, and I have the benefit of having read a few of the Inkeeper books, so I'm already a fan of the authors.
