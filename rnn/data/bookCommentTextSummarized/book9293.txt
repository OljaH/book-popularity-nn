I think this is the first book I've ever hated.
The message about religious pluralism is refreshing, sure, but the book just plain reads wrong, and I will probably never get over Lewis's treatment of Susan.
I guess if you don't believe in God, you deserve to lose your entire family in a train crash.
Awesome.I suppose there is some hope in that Susan did not die - maybe her family's gruesome deaths will help her find God, and then a train will kill her too, and she'll join Peter, Edmund, and Lucy in Aslan's country!
It seems to me that this is reductio ad absurdum, taking the notion of Christian forgiveness to its logical and extremely nasty conclusion, and I still have no idea what C.S. Lewis thought he was doing.
It dissolves our identities, they have been created by difference, and that is what makes Christianity unrealisable, we cannot think ourselves away, it is too much to lose, it is all we have.____________________________[Update, Aug 2017]If I understand him correctly, Donald Trump is saying the same thing in his already-famous 'many sides' speech.
No one is worth more than anyone else, Trump apparently wants to tell us.
It is racist, sexist, fundamentalist rhetoric disguised as children's literature.Those 'darkies' (yes, that's how they're referred to in the book, along with stinking of 'onions and garlic') are invading Narnia again, at the guidance of a monkey (groan for obvious racist parallels once more) parading around a false Aslan.
Oh, except for Susan, of course, who is apparently slutting around the real world because she can think of nothing but 'nylons and stockings' and as Peter says gravely, "She is no longer a friend of Narnia."And that is the dangerous fundamentalist thought throughout this book.
Lewis understands the way the world works better than any other writer I have ever read.
It's likely due to his appreciation for story and powerful imagination fed by scripture.
This book was eye opening for me to feel truth about how deception and our societies work in rebellion to God, through a fictional story.
It was painful to recognize the major battle and struggle that is so slippery and subtle in our own lives.
It would feel better to feel the stark good vs evil contrast in the Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe, but it wouldn't be as cutting or true as this "Last Battle".
WORST. ENDING. EVER.I mean, seriously? The happiest ending possible is for everyone to die and go to heaven? At first I thought that since Susan had stopped believing in Narnia and Aslan, she didn't get to go to "heaven", but then I realised she wasn't actually on the train so she's still alive. How absolutely horrible, losing her siblings and her parents. But you know, better that than being dead. Sorry, C.S. Lewis, I'm not converted.
If I had the energy to describe how bad this is, I still wouldn't be able to describe how bad this is.
The first part of this book was so difficult for me to get through. I hated how Narnia had become so tainted. Everything was so utterly depressing, but thankfuly, things did not stay that way. The last half is so wonderful. I hardly knew what to do with myself after reading it for the first time.Of any of the worlds I've read about, Narnia is the one I would most like to visit or better yet, live in forever. I think that speaks to C.S. Lewis' ability to understand the longing of the human soul to be united with God.
Despite having a darker message and more serious tone than the other stories, I enjoyed this just as much as the previous books.It has been centuries since the last sighting of the mystical Aslan and his name has turned from legend to myth.
With some falsely using his name and status, and others denouncing him altogether, it is left to the returning children from our world to save Narnia once again.Despite a similar running theme, this seemed aimed at a more adult audience.
However, as an adult reader myself, I enjoyed these new aspects.
آغاز داستان آفرینش نارنیا در روز نخست با آواز اصلان شیر و سخنگو شدن حیوانات با جادوی اصلان است و پایان آن در کتاب آخرین نبرد آمده است تا سرگذشت نارنیا و ماجرای کودکانی را بگوید که نقش اصلی در تاریخچهٔ دنیای نارنیا را بازی می‌کنند.
در هر کتاب از این مجموعه (به جز اسب و آدمش) کودکانی از دنیای ما به صورت جادویی به نارنیا میروند جایی که از آن‌ها خواسته می‌شود، تا به اصلان شیر یاری برسانند.
زندگی آنها در این جهان است، و تمام ماجراهایشان در نارنیای خیال انگیز میگذرد، حالا، سرانجام فصل نخست داستان بزرگ را، که هیچ کس بر روی زمین، آن را نخوانده است.
I cannot believe I have now read all 7, and whilst I realise they are meant for children younger than me ("lol") I really enjoyed them and as with all great series', I wish there were more to read.I know some people have accused C.S. Lewis of being racist (duh !), and of the books having too many religious overtones (or undertones) but in my view they are good stories that have a message that all humans should agree with, that of understanding, respect, tolerance and above all love for one's fellow man.
Once I started thinking about racism and degrading other religions I couldn't take this anymore. There was no way to unsee those things and just read it as a fun children's book. What a waste of time. Sorry not sorry.Oh, and the story itself was boring and aggravating.
Except someone is left behind.I am of course, talking about Susan.Susan is left behind and alive in our world, not being able to return to Narnia because she no longer believes and is more interested in "lipstick, nylons and invitations."Now I understand the message Lewis was trying to give, that you shouldn't cast aside your spirituality or faith for more frivolous superficial things, that you should always remain faithful despite where life takes you.
Lewis did state that Susan might find her way back to Narnia later in life, "in her own way." And you know I hope she does, but when she gets there I'm not sure her family deserves her.
Moreover, given the strong female characters in the Chronicles (especially Jill in this story) I find cries of sexism less than convincing.But then there's that last page...**SPOILERS BELOW***This is the next to last paragraph in the book and series:There was a real railway accident," said Aslan softly.
And then I thought of Susan--no longer "a friend of Narnia" dealing with the sudden violent deaths of her friends and family and I felt the same kind of rage at Lewis.
That story has some disturbing imagery, and I know some that love Narnia have called it disgusting and "blasphemous." (Definitely not a story for children--adults only here.) All I can say is having come to the end of this series I found it cathartic.
In The Magician's Nephew, the first book of the series in its chronological order, we see the creation of Narnia and in The Last Battle we see the end of it, at least the end of Narnia as we saw created (if that makes any sense).
We meet the last King of Narnia, King Tirian, who as a true Narnian fights with valour, although it is a losing battle.
It is kind of sad to read the end of Narnia as it was so true and alive to us readers through seven books.
With the read of The Last Battle, I have completed the Chronicles of Narnia.
This is my favorite of the Narnia books.
I love how it begins, and especially how it ends.
I really enjoyed all of Lewis' subtle hints about what he believes, and was surprised by how many things I agreed with.
I love that the Taarkan is told that all who do good in the name of Tash are really doing it to Aslan, and those who do evil in the name of Aslan are really accepted by Tash.
The only thing I didn't like was the loss of Susan- and her unwillingness to believe in Narnia anymore.
I finally saw how it all ended. After almost 20 years it feels amazing. I thought CS Lewis' interpretation of the end times was beautiful. The story was definitely more focused and serious in tone than many of the other books but I have to tell you that I loved it. Overall, I would probably give it a 4.75 stars! :)
I know my sister didn't, especially because of the fact that Susan isn't brought into the new Narnia with the other Pevensie children.
I don't think the reason that Susan was lost was because she "found lipstick", I think it was meant to illustrate in a way that was easier for a child to understand—these are children's books, remember—that Susan had, at some point, made a decision to turn away from what she knew to be true and good in favour of shallow, temporal things that would never fill her.
She basically chose to turn away from the blessings that Aslan and Narnia would give her.
It seemed to have no point whatsoever, except that Lewis decided he was done writing Narnia stories, and instead of leaving it open for fans to imagine what adventures might've come after, he figured he could cram some more Christian allegory in there and thoroughly traumatize his young audience by killing off every single character they'd come to love.
Basically some jerkass old ape (I see what you did there, Mr. Lewis) dresses up this gullible ass in a lion skin and starts ordering the Narnians around as the mouthpiece of Aslan, so instead of punishing Shift for his wickedness, Aslan DESTROYS THE WORLD.
Whew....those last couple pages though 😯😅 It feels like such a long time since I first got into this series....Initially, I was thinking this was only going to be a 4 star read, but once I started getting near the end I enjoyed it a lot more.
I'm also a little more emotional right now for certain reasons xD lol  (hide spoiler)]I'm really gonna miss reading about the Narnia world for the first time though :/ Definitely going to be rereading the series in the future though!!
Τη σειρά την είχα ξεκινήσει πριν μερικά χρόνια αλλά δεν την τελείωσα ποτέ....ούτε και θυμάμαι το λόγο που δεν συνέχισα τότε με το 7ο.
Αλλά έφτασε ο καιρός και το πήρα απόφαση και το διάβασα!Και πολύ χαίρομαι που το έκανα τώρα και όχι νωρίτερα γιατί πιστεύω ειλικρινά πως δεν θα μπορούσα να το εκτιμήσω τότε!Άλλο ένα ταξίδι έφτασε στο τέλος του....και ήταν φυσικά ένα πολύ ωραίο ταξίδι!
Πολύ ξαφνικό τέλος και ίσως και λίγο θλιμμένο....Με μια θλίψη και μια μελαγχολία λοιπόν αφήνω τη Νάρνια αλλά και με χαρά ταυτόχρονα για όλες τις αναμνήσεις!
(στα αγγλικά κατα πάσα πιθανότητα γιατί η μετάφραση νομίζω πως ήταν λίγο τραγική)
The best part was seeing all the characters (bar Susan) together again at the end.-The plot was pretty interesting but it did get a bit nonsensical in the last half (with that weird demon/devil thing).
Jill was no better.-What a WTF ending - Narnia ceased to exist, and all the characters died and ended up in a Narnia-esque heaven.
I wasn't impressed that Lucy and co died and lost out the chance to grow old on Earth and have a normal life.
Why did everyone think she deserved to live with the pain of her WHOLE family dying?
Will she even end up in Narnia-heaven when she dies?
Tirian could have ignored the call, he could have hidden at his hunting lodge and carved out a semblance of pleasure and prosperity - but he ran to the battle, he ran to his people, he ran to Aslan.
And he was the only person in Narnia that JUMPED through the Stable Door.May I also run to the battle - may I someday jump through that door - mocking defeat and death and dragging the enemy in with me because I KNOW: "We all rest between the paws of the Lion." “The term is over: the holidays have begun.
I dislike the conclusion of this series but still, it deserves a 5* rating for me since I base it to the wisdom I got and not because of the emotions that left in me after reading the last word at the end.
Just like the dwarves in this book, they lose faith after they’ve been deceived once.
Hours later after I finished reading, another point that struck my heart.
Their fears and lack of understanding are the reasons why they’ve been easily deceived and do what was being told even if it is inappropriate.
So, whew, we made it through all of them. Our adventures in Narnia are over. After the fourth book, it started to be hard-going there. While the little one was still enjoying them, for me, the increased sloppiness of story structure and the more obvious Aslan/Jesus analog were growing tiresome. But we did it, making it all the way through to the ultra-preachy (view spoiler)[the world ends but everyone goes to Heaven (hide spoiler)] ending!
Antes de leer este libro me hice spoiler (me odio jajaja) y no se si fue por eso, que al leerlo se veía venir ese final... (view spoiler)[Entiendo porque fue un final de impacto, el saber que todos estaban muertos (en nuestro mundo) porque hubo un accidente de ferrocarril, pero al leer todo lo que decían los Pevensie, te das cuenta que era algo que ya se veía venir (hide spoiler)]La trama me pareció entretenida, pero pensaba que siendo el ultimo libro, sucedería la más grande batalla de Narnia,

I feel like Lewis might have just been extremely done with society and he let it all out in the book.
Even looking outside of the Christian perspective that Lewis refers to in his books, society isn't what it used to be, just like how Narnia isn't what it used to be.(view spoiler)[I find it completely depressing that everyone dies in the end.
And there are definitely a few Narnia novels I would read again."And for us this is the end of all the stories, and we can most truly say that they all lived happily ever after." (p.
This is one of the best books in the Chronicles of Narnia series!
The climax & the ending is VERY exciting!
This really give me a glimpse of how heaven will be like, as I can't stop smiling and laughing in the end.
You have to read the book to find out what it is...!
It really shows how wondrous Aslan is and how he always has the right & just punishment for all.
Even though this is a fiction, specifically fantasy story, it really tells you a lot about the truths and reality of our own world & heaven.
Favorite Quote: "You see," said Aslan.
I recently reread this series.
I was very worried that my added perspective as a religious studies major and adult would mar my childhood love of the books, but honestly, this is the only one in the series that I found unpalatable.
Maybe it's because I find the rapture/end-times story to be more annoying that the sacrificed God story adapted in The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, I don't know.
I suppose Lewis thought he had to end off his great Christian fairy tale with the end times narrative, but he could at least have written it better.
2.5 stars round up to 3Well, it appears that my journey into Narnia has run its course. All of the "cast" return to help Aslan and their Narnian friends with one last battle. Well, except for dear Susan who earned the strange fate of growing up and becoming rather shallow. The ending of the story and the reaction it has received from thousands of reviewers, reminds me of the finale of LOST. I just didn't see it coming.
