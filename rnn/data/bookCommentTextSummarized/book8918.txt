I read this when I was an insanely romantic teenager and since then the cruel world has beaten all that nonsense out of my brain with bars of iron and wires of barb, and left me bleeding and barfing in a vile ditch, so I should probably not have plucked my old Corgi paperback of Something Wicked out from my most cobwebbed shelf and thought to wander nostalgically recapturing the wonder and enrapturement I once perceived herein.
But anyway, when I did reread this book, I could not shake off the growing realisation that none of it made the least bit of sense.
I didn't know who the boy was who loved this book so much.
The world has changed and no longer has the stomach for Ray Bradbury's 1950s goldenhued renderings of his own 1920s childhood.
In brief sentences, he encapsulates the complexity of a life:"And the first boy, with hair as blond-white as milk thistle, shut up one eye, tilted his head, and looked at the salesman with a single eye as open, bright and clear as a drop of summer rain.""Jim stood like a runner who has come a long way, fever in his mouth, hands open to receive any gift.""What was there about the illustrated carnival owner's silences that spoke thousands of violent, corrupt, and crippling words?"Bradbury's ability to uniquely characterize extends to the carnival, arriving at the dead time of 3 a.m., setting up in the dark:"For somehow instead, they both knew, the wires high-flung on the poles were catching swift clouds, ripping them free from the wind in streamers which, stitched and sewn by some great monster shadow, made canvas and more canvas as the tent took shape.
Bradbury, no less an American, but a resident of the October Country, revealed the long shadow of Twain‚Äôs history, echoing away like a train whistle far gone.
The author draws us in with his illustration of Green Town; here a simile, like the sound of leaves racing down a late summer‚Äôs sidewalk, there a metaphor, a witch‚Äôs brew dark and murky, filled with spider webs and green frog smiles, and the color of a ghosts sigh.In Mr. Dark, Bradbury has given us one of literature‚Äôs great villains, but drawn by the Grandmaster with empathy born of long familiarity.One of the great stories from a great storyteller and a book that everyone should read.
The carnival has come to town. I have to admit I love the movie more than the book because, well, I enjoy watching the creepiness! I think I need to dig the movie out now and watch it üòäJim and Will are two young boys that are drawn into the carnival and they try to help stop the evil. Creepy good fun!! Mel ‚ù§Ô∏è
The downside is that there are so many books to choose from, and so little time to get them read.
I‚Äôve seen movie versions, but never got around to reading the book.
However, this book may have shaken by enthusiasm for October and the beginning of autumn‚Ä¶‚ÄúFor some, autumn comes early, stays late through life, where October follows September and November touches October and then instead of December and Christ‚Äôs birth, there is no Bethlehem Star, no rejoicing, but September comes again and old October and so on down the years, with no winter, spring, or reviving summer.
By the pricking of my thumbs, something wicked this way comes. MacBeth Act 4, Scene 1This book is straight-forward good vs. evil ‚Äì and is quite terrifying at points! It goes beyond fantasy and mysticism and straight to the terrifying possibilities from the darkest reaches.

This would be a great story to read if you are looking for a campfire tale, a Halloween scare, or a late night, nightmare causing fright fest.
Some may find the scariness lost within the poetry of Bradbury‚Äôs writing, but for those who are comfortable with it, I guarantee you will be holding your breath at points throughout.On a side note ‚Äì I remember as a kid being terrified of this movie, but I don‚Äôt think I ever actually watched it!
It was the idea that it existed and that it was dark and mysterious that had me quickly changing the channel if it was on.
‚ÄúBut someone inside me does.‚Äù‚ÄúWho?‚ÄùThe boy I once was, thought Halloway, who runs like the leaves down the sidewalk autumn nights.***When Ray Bradbury was a boy of 12, he paid a visit to a carnival in his home town.
Bradbury, seated in the front row, watched as the man‚Äôs hair stood on end; he held a sword full of electricity, tapped Bradbury on both shoulders and said, ‚ÄúLive, forever!‚ÄùThe day following this event, Bradbury returned to the carnival where he again saw Mr. Electrico, who was certain that Bradbury was his old friend reincarnated.
Those days stay with you for the rest of your life even if the friend has gone his separate ways.Reading about Jim Nightshade and William Halloway makes me feel nostalgic and brings back a lot of happy childhood memories even though I did not have to battle creepy supernatural gentlemen from a dark carnival.
The book is also highly atmospheric, I love the portentous feeling of the impending arrival of the mysterious carnival; I can almost hear the creepy calliope music described in the book.The characters are beautifully drawn, Will Halloway is intelligent and earnest without being a mere cipher for the readers, his friend Jim Nightshade is impulsive, impatient and loyal.
Leveling any complaints against Bradbury seems like a literary crime, but I'm afraid I didn't enjoy Something Wicked as much I feel like I should have.
Quite a few times, I had to reread a sentence once or twice and really focus on the words, because my brain just didn't naturally follow what was being read.
Good conquers evil, I get it, but Bradbury didn't use this concept very subtly.This review sounds more negative than I feel about the book, but these issues did drag it down.
I still really enjoyed the plot and the characters from the carnival.
Once, when I was 19, I stood outside a stage door for an hour, awaiting the arrival of Ray Bradbury.Bradbury was 70 at the time, and he was scheduled to give a lecture at my school.I was determined that we were going to talk.If this sounds stalker-ish to you, let me comfort you.
Maybe grab a cup of coffee afterwards?It all seemed perfectly reasonable to me.I had wanted to ask him why he felt he gets lumped as a writer of sci fi and horror when he is so clearly the Father of Fantasy.And, where, WHERE does he come up with all of these words?I wanted to tell him that I had forgiven him for weak dialogue and character development, because, well, you know.
I should have loved the shit out of this book.
It's Bradbury, it's vintage horror, it's Stephen King recommended, it's a coming-of-age tale about young boys and a creepy carnival, and it's been on my reading list for years.
This book and I should have hit it off like gangbusters.
Finally, with the day off work, I took it in hand this afternoon with a desire to just dive in and -- for better or worse -- finish the damn thing.
To me, no one writes children (especially boys) like King.
I can only conclude the book didn't fail me; I failed it.
Ray Bradbury is one of my absolute favorite authors, and SOMETHING WICKED is a book I've read 3 times over the past 17 years. To me, no other author delivers so much energy and emotion with just a word or two than Bradbury. He was definitely one of our national treasures and this is his most magical book. Highly recommended.
I know what Charles Halloway feels at three o‚Äôclock in the morning.
Now, in my autumn, I can finally relate to the boys, the thirteen year olds.For this is a nostalgic book.
Where once I was drawn to the quiet library haunted by Mr. Holloway, this time I ran through the night, pulse-racing, thirteen year old legs pumping, young lungs relishing the crisp October air, reveling in the strength and bright freedom of youth.
It‚Äôs for the boy Charles Halloway once was ‚Äúwho runs like the leaves down the sidewalk autumn nights‚Äù (19).
As an adult reading the text, I was understandably awed by the rich metaphor and playful language.Re-reading it now makes me melancholy.Gone are the years that would support friendly neighbors in small towns where everyone knows everyone else, when the death of a barber actually makes a stir.The fact is, this is an extremely bucolic coming of age tale centered on the choice to be good or bad with a lot of supernatural help.Add a spattering of Stephen King's IT, a dab of Mary Poppins, stir firmly into a smooth wordplay of rife with the pastoral, and you've got Something Wicked This Way Comes.
One thing I‚Äôve noticed about a lot of young adult books and coming-of-age movies is a certain generational disconnect between the protagonist and his forebears.
But in Something Wicked This Way Comes, that gap is bridged to a really interesting end.Something Wicked is the story of two kids scrambling to be a day, a month, a year older, and an aging parent reflecting on the nostalgia of his youth and perhaps wishing to shave a few years off his own accumulated tree rings.
The imagery of the phantom twin as metaphor for an echo is pretty brilliant here, and Bradbury repeats this feat throughout the book.
Gee whiz, I could read an entire book of just Charles Halloway monologues.
Have we ever let you down before?"This book could be read in the month of October, particularly the end of October, for an added bonus of it being Halloween and all.
If you haven't read that book yet, I mean seriously.
Like, man I loved reading about Guy and all that book burning stuff, and here I am loving this dark carnival story with two boys and a dad and a bunch of dark, scary people.
I had an incredibly hard time reading this book, especially considering it's a 300-page linear story about an evil circus coming to a small town.
The dialogue is sparse and stilted, and the descriptions are never-ending, and hard to follow.Reading the opening chapter, the language excited me.
Let the story through!"An example:It was indeed a time between, one second their thoughts all brambled airedale, the next all silken slumbering cat.
It was a time to go to bed, yet still they lingered reluctant as boys to give over and wander in wide circles to pillow and night thoughts.
‚ÄúBeware the autumn people.‚ÄùA travelling carnival arrives in a small midwestern town one day in October, resulting in a nightmarish experience for two 13 year old boys.Do you like coming of age tales?
There's a little excerpt where Mr. Halloway talks about the "autumn people" and it simply took my breath away - it was basically Bradbury's way of beautifully describing those who are evil (see below):"Beware the autumn people‚Ä¶ For some, autumn comes early, stays late through life‚Ä¶For these beings, fall is the ever normal season, the only weather, there be no choice beyond.
But it really worked for me as I was carried away in an autumnal breeze off to the carnival *sighs* This has been one of my top books of the year.
One of my favorite "semi-horror" reads.
Like a lot of Bradbury's work the smell of late summer and early fall permeates this volume.
While I don't think this one has reached that point with the general reading public I think it might deserve to.
I guess we'll see.The traveling carnivals that traveled from town to town and showed up at county fairs of my own youth that set the background for this tale with their mysterious denizens, noisy rides, lights that filled the night while leaving pockets of darkness are almost gone.
A lot will depend on your own past...and your own capacity for wonder.
The Dark carnival is coming to town.Two boys and a father are the towns only hope. If only out of fear you stay home and not go down to the fair ground tonight for the dark man awaits. Two buddies, boys, they live next to each other and can see each others bedroom window when needed. Friends born two minutes apart, one 1min before midnight October 30th, and the other 1min after midnight, October 31st, Halloween.I loved the father son relationship in this story between Will and his father Charle
But this was like old movies, the silent theatre haunted with black-and-white ghosts, silvery mouths opening to let moonlight smoke out, gestures made in silence so hushed you could hear the wind fizz the hair on your cheeks.""In the meadow, the tents, the carnival waited.
:' )The novel is actually a 1962 tale of Halloween horror about a traveling carnival which sets up tents and rides in early October next to a little town where 13-year-old William Halloway and James Nightshade live next door to each other.
For one thing, the circus arrives in the dead of night and as they watch, the tents seem to set themselves up almost without human agency!
Things are very weird about this circus, but after meeting the peculiar people in the carnival in the following days, the kids soon know it is evil.
By the pricking of my thumbs, something wicked this way comes! And how wicked it was! Carnival is coming to town but friends Will Halloway and Jim Nightshade aren't fooled - this is no ordinary carnival and they won't let the strange autumn people coming with it take over their town! So they, along with Will's glorious librarian father, discover the autumn people's secret and do everything they can to stop them.I started reading Bradbury because of his most famous story about the burning of boo
So they, along with Will's glorious librarian father, discover the autumn people's secret and do everything they can to stop them.I started reading Bradbury because of his most famous story about the burning of books and then continued last year with his other Halloween book.
Something Wicked This Way Comes, just like last year's Spooktober book, has a marvellous autumn-y atmosphere that makes you hear the leaves rustle, smell the crisp foggy air and see all the splendid colours this most beautiful season has to offer.
Not a review, really - just some thoughts.By the pricking of my thumbs,Something wicked this way comes.Other than being a rather creepy story, this novel is also a lament for the passage of time and the ending of things.
Something Wicked This Way Comes is pretty melancholic and poignant, in its own fashion, and Bradbury‚Äôs lyrical writing style underlines that fact.
Whether you can identify with the America of Bradbury‚Äôs youth or not (this should be considered a moot point, since we can‚Äôt identify with Dickens‚Äôs England or with Middle Earth either, and that‚Äôs never a problem), this novel succeeds on many levels; death and fear are, after all, universal and timeless.How do you hear it, how are you warned?
The prose is ponderous, self-indulgent and nonsensical, at every opportunity taking turns of phrase so purple and baffling, that I can only understand them as symptomatic of a woefully adolescent conception of what "poetic" or "serious" prose would look like.
I can't remember the last time I stopped reading a book because it sucked: usually I vet my reading choices pretty accurately and if that doesn't work I'll find something interesting about it and plow through anyway.
I, however, can't help but see it is as a perfect specimen of the nonsense gibberish that passes for "profound" writing in this novel (and in this case it's a fairly essentializing and sexist bit of nonsense as well).
Hmm, I‚Äôm torn between giving this book 4 or 5 stars.
It is creepy, it is ‚Äúdarkly poetic (Stephen King‚Äôs words)‚Äù, it captures you (or is that the Dust Witch), it is beautifully written with wonderfully descriptive passages, it is above all, Ray Bradbury.
Beautifully written by the master of prose, this book is just a joy to soak up, to experience, to read.

By means of his bookish ways and his thoughtful personality, he discovers and exploits the fatal flaw that Dark and his sinister folk hold close to their dark hearts.Unfortunately, I didn't find listening to this story as good an experience as I would have hoped for.
As a person who sometimes feels her age deeply, I can appreciate Bradbury's gentle warning that humans can put too much stock in how old and how young they are and lose out on enjoying and experiencing every day, the Now. I needed that reminder.
Read for Popsugar's 2018 Reading Challenge: A book about or set on HalloweenI loved the beginning; two tweens (Will and Jim) are complete opposites, but they are similar in that their birthdays are 2 minutes apart around midnight on Halloween.
The interactions between the boys were so cute and genuine, and I loved the nervous rambling that somehow managed to take up multiple images at a time.However, as the book went on, the overly poetic writing sort of lost me.
Definitely a spooky autumn read, although not my favorite one so far.
I mean, it‚Äôs Bradbury! Of course it‚Äôs good.
It is a follow up to Dandelion Wine and contains many of the same characters and is based on Bradbury‚Äôs own childhood.
However the real hero of the story is Will‚Äôs father Charles Halloway, who is in his 50s.
The themes are age old (the struggle between good and evil) and coming of age, but also the importance of being young at heart.
It‚Äôs a good read, suitably atmospheric and chilling.So what am I doing reading it at my age, rather than in my teens?
However it was rather gratifying that there was a character of my age at the centre of things; there‚Äôs hope yet!!
