Half way through Trevayne I thought I had incontrovertible proof that Robert Ludlum was the greatest writer in english ever.
Trevayne concerns itself with a Senate subcommittee set up to investigate defense spending misappropriations.
Yes you read that correctly.
I'll write a book about a government committee looking into corporation ledgers." I thought it was a Ludlum book so there would be action and world travel.
Over the first half of the book is about the work of a Senate subcommittee investigating malfeasance.
But I kept reading.
Then sadly comes the second half of the book.
It's like he got bored half way through.
The book envisages a situation where a few senior men try to substitute American democracy with an Aristocracy where few high intellectuals will rule the country.
They put in motion a scheme by which they can appropriate large sums of money out of the state exchequer through defense contracts and accumulate enough funds so that eventually it will be their intellects backed by large sums of money that will rule the US and the world in the future.Trevayne is a middle aged rich American of impeccable credentials who is chosen to head a Senate sub-committe to inquire into the Pentagons giving away of contracts.
I have had a hard time to finish the book as it was taking on and on and on of the same ideas. The book is definitively not a thriller nor suspense. It is more just a political agitation, with more or less agreeable idealistic principles. This will not stop me to read other Ludlum books, but one learning for myself on future book from Ludlum, when you feel it is boring just drop it.....
Bonner saves Trevayne's life and then Trevayne saves him from De Spandate...Ludlum's tribute to the mastery of Mario Puzo and his famed book, The Godfather, 
But after a meeting with Major Bonner, Andy contemplates if he was right to withhold information report submitted by the sub-committee for Defense Allocation Commission.Back at Potomac Towers, Sam tells him that Webster has been killed by De Spadante's men and the POTUS has intercepted and impounded the report as a precaution.
Trevayne decides to confess to the POTUS that he was mistaken and tries to convince him that Geneesse Industries must be uprooted.
This book had potential:Government corruption, conspiracy to overthrow the government, plans to install a puppet administration run by greedy corporate executives, the triumph of the little man over Big Government, even a brush with the criminal underworld.
Sadly, it was a letdown due to overly in-depth descriptions of how the checks and balances set forth in the Constitution are supposed to work.
I can see how the abuse of power by the government inspired this tale, but it lacked enough offsetting action to compensate for the pages of dry details.
Trevayne voelt daar aanvankelijk niet veel voor, maar laat zich uiteindelijk toch overhalen het rapport te schrijven.
Tot zover is het allemaal duidelijk en helder, maar vanaf het moment dat Trevayne aan de slag gaat wordt het boek alleen maar verwarrend.
Misschien dat het boek voor de Amerikaanse lezer een eye-opener is en herkenning geeft, maar voor de markt daarbuiten is het boek ronduit nietszeggend.
Er zijn een paar momenten dat het boek wél aardig is en dat zijn die momenten waarop de zo goed als ontbrekende spanning toch even om de hoek komt kijken.
Waardoor dit boek tot een van zijn slechtere, zo niet zijn slechtste, boeken behoort.
There's a reason the great writer of the Bourne books and other gov't thrillers started out his career under a pseudonym.
One of his first attempts here you can see he's still figuring out his approach to bringing thrills and suspense into the bureaucratic side of gov't.
This book, unfortunately, is all bureaucracy with a level of thrills and suspense tantamount to the real time bog of hearing, 2nd hand, all the office politics of a month's long caseload at the IRS.
Life's too short when you can just read "The Bourne Identity"...
or a NY Times or Washington Post article today.
CC 1Excellent book. The whole plot was excellent.. like the way they intertwined Alex with the political players. The way they investigated Genesis Industries. Then the way they played Alex and Ian with his trying to become president. 5 stars Carl Clause
Characters’ profundity: **Characters’ reliability: ***Story’s profundity: **Story’s reliability: ***Yessss, I finished it. Finally. It became so boring so quickly. I did want to finish it but it was some waste of time. And the end was fairly uncomprehensible.
Political Thriller. Not really my type of story. Good read though.
Not one of Ludlum's best, but not bad.
Compelling
Ludlum ha anche pubblicato romanzi sotto gli pseudonimi di Jonathan Ryder e Michael Shepherd.
L'indagine, ovviamente, dissotterrerà rapidamente verità pericolose.La domanda che ci si rivolge durante la lettura del libro è "chi sono i veri poteri che tracciano le trame degli Stati Uniti d'America?" Il protagonista di questo libro dovrà affrontare corruzione, mafia, politica, interessi economici e ideologici, per scoprirlo.
Scritto sotto l'influenza dello scandalo Watergate, un romanzo avvincente e come sempre nella tradizione di Ludlum molto plausibile.Ennesimo capolavoro del maestro dell'intrigo...
I vacillated a number of times before I actually purchased this novel.
First, I don't know whether a political novel could actually hold my interest; second, I wondered whether it would even be relevant.
This novel suggests that it takes someone with little to lose, and someone with the capability to compromise as well as make difficult decisions.
Trevayne became successful with his subcommittee because he was able to make these difficult decisions, and became a successful president because he was able to compromise.
With these guidelines, I think our country probably needs a Rodrigo Duterte or a Miriam Defensor-Santiago.
Complicated plot about a secret government with the US government.Story takes place in the late sixties or early seventies but it applicable today.
Trevayne has been nominated by the President to chair a Defense Subcommittee looking into Pentagon waste in purchasing and contracting.
He comes across a behemoth company called Genessee Industries that, apparently, is running the Pentagon.
The United States of Genessee Industries.
Can Trevayne control Genessee?
What can Trevayne do?
Even today (2016) during an election year, one has to wonder if Big Business runs the candidates, and, if so, how much.
Although this book was written years ago, the themes are very current.

And here it is, my final Ludlum book to finish.
I thought this book was very well thought out, and indicated significant ability as a writer to establish multiple characters, develop them, and maintain dialogues that made sense.
His knowledge of the inner workings of government, military, and even company structures display in this book.
As far as 'spy stuff' there isn't a whole lot in this novel.
That isn't to say that it won't hold on to you whenever you close the book, or as I did, close the Kindle app.
I love many of Ludlum's books - there is just so much going on, and there's action from page 1 to the last page, usually between 500 and 700+.
This is one of them, and it was first published under another name - so I should not have expected The Ludlum I like.
The ingredients for a great thriller are there, but it was just a bit too political thriller for me.First published in 1973, and it's still a great time to read it, especially around the elections.
For some reason it took me a long time to finish this book - usually I can't put a Ludlum down.
Ludlum can't seem to decide here who is telling the story, the overeducated snob or the common man.
The tone often changes with the paragraph.
Trevayne begins as a likable fellow on a mission then rapidly deteriorates into a holier than thou firebreather out for blood.
The story itself interests but the character's stiff attitude just stifled the story for me.
Every character seems to be ready to bite heads off rather than compromise on any point.
Butting heads throughout the book.
And if it offends, kill it.
Still, I did like the overall plot, quite a frightening thought there and too close for comfort in some ways.
Im amazed so many people didn't seem to like this one more.
This book was a nice bled oftwo other authors that have been successful in Hollywood, John Grisham and Tom Clancy.
The novel, although written for a different time in the country, as openly admitted by the author, still has themes that apply today.
Names could be changed, technology updated, and the story would fit right in today.
If one would trudge through the slow beginning, it is fast paced enough that I'm shocked this one hasn't been picked up by Hollywood as well!
As a Ludlum fan many moons ago, I have a few books on my shelf that I had not gotten around to reading.
I am not much for political action topics.
As I read on, I was drawn to the character of Andrew Trevayne: self-made millionaire with a conscience and a loving husband and father.
By the end of the book I was caught up in the political intrique.
Politics and business do make strange bedfellows.
I can't say that the book's conclusion made me feel more patriotic.
I will read more Ludlum but this wasn't one of my favorites.
Took me 5 days to get through the first half of the book and 2 to finish. Took an awful long time to set things up, but once the story got rolling it was hard to put down.Might be interesting for those interested in the power and influence a corporation with ties to the military might be able to gain over the government. A lot of the story takes place in Connecticut with mentions of Southeast Asia and Thailand, which was interesting for myself, as a Connecticut native and long time Thai resident.
My first Ludlum, yes? Yes. And it turned out to be one he wrote under a pseudonym, due to all its political content and (as I soon learned) its unusual absence of Nazis. The best way I can describe it is as if one of the entrepreneurs from "Shark Tank" were suddenly immersed in a vast political conspiracy, only to blow it wide open while dodging bullets and drinking whisky. In the post-Watergate 1970's. A bit long and windy but it certainly beats reading Ayn Rand.
First ever Ludlum read for me. Political thrillers used to be my favourite genre until I stumbled on Romance. Trevayne is the president (or Prime Minister for me) we all wish we had. It's fiction I know but so was the West Wing and we still hoped. Enjoyed the trials and tribulations and the suspense in Trevayne until the very end which in fact is not an end at all but a cliffhanger which apparently does not get resolved in subsequent books. Therein the three stars.
This is another great novel by Ludlum. The complex and intricate web Ludlum weaves is a reflection of genius. This novel is exciting as an idea - that there is a conspiratorial organization that controls the government - and in its execution.Details, phrases, and situations certainly date this novel However, it was interesting to reflect on this "historical" time-period that was actually quite recent and played a big-part in our current socio-economic status.
There was a lot less political density and a lot more about character development in this book than some of his others, I thought. This was a good thing, since though I always enjoy Ludlum's books, I tend to get a bit lost in the governmental discussion. I really liked Trevayne, and kept thinking if years from now they make a movie of this book, I'd love to play his wife - she was such a strong character. Or the daughter, if she was in it more...
This novel was originally written shortly after the Watergate scandal, and the edition I read was a re-printing made after the 1988 elections. It is quite heavily based in the political sphere and, for that reason, is almost timeless. I saw a lot of parallels to what we have even today, in this current election season. It's a well-written cautionary tale by one of the masters, solid from beginning to end.
Excellent suspenseful novel in Ludlum's usual involving style. Andrew Trevayne is asked to become the chair of a subcommittee of the federal government to look for corruption or abuse of power. He develops a committee that finds out that a lot of the government has ties to one agency, Genessee Industries. As he runs the investigation, he is attacked figuratively and literally from many angles. He has to decide if releasing their findings is for the good or the bad of the country.
Trevayne by Robert Ludlum is a marathon political race through the why's, how's, and wherefore's of US government subcommittees. It paints a picture of "the last good, honest, smart man" trying to root out corruption in the awarding of government contracts. At times I was quite bored by the incessant wading through details. I felt like I was on the sub-committee having to go through all that material.
Normally the trademarks of Ludlum's thrillers are as follows:- grand conspiracy- extremely evil and powerful person or organization behind the conspiracy- protagonists travel all over the world in the cause of the story- 20+ murdersTrevayne from this standpoint:- conspiracy - check- evil organization - check- travels are restricted only to the US- only 6 murdersSo, this is a slightly below average Ludlum.
