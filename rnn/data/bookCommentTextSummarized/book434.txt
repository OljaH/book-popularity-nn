Mencken was the most provocative and influential journalist and cultural critic in twentieth-century America.
There were a total of six volumes of these essays, all collected in two volumes by The Library of America.
In this volume you will find his essays on “The Late Mr. Wells,” “The American Magazine,” “The Blushful Mystery (his review on sex in America),” “Roosevelt, An Autopsy,” “The Sahara of the Bozart (a scathing review of the lack of culture in the American South),” and many, many others.
A native of Baltimore, Mencken approached his topics with his gloves off, and didn’t care who he skewered in his essays.
This Library of America Series of H.L. Mencken is fascinating. Loved, admired, hated, and respected, Mencken was an original. His literary work and public persona made people think and still do.
Some of the subjects are bound to be obscure to modern readers (although there is a helpful collection of End Notes appended), but I was struck by the timelessness of some of the ideas and phenomena described (e.g. an anti-vaccination advocate, a war being "sold" to the American people based on an exaggerated threat).
His essay "On Being an American" is especially caustic; an Anti-American screed that is 3/4 Social Darwinist horseshit (many of us come from inferior racial stock [i.e. not Anglo-Saxon] and were unable to hack it in the homeland so we moved here!) and 1/4 uncomfortable truth.
This is at least the 2nd time I have reread this collection of essays Mencken is one of my Favorite writers both for his wit and his scathing word play.
The funniest American writer.
H.L. Mencken will not abide any sort of bosh, claptrap, piffle, hocus pocus or pishposh.
