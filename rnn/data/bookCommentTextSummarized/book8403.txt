"Stupidity is lethal." One of the many musing from first person narrator Nicholas Urfe, a dashingly handsome twenty-five year old Oxford educated Englishman on the Greek island of Phraxos during a conversation with Conchis, a much older wealthy recluse, a man imaginative enough to remind him of Pablo Picasso and mysterious enough to remind me of Aleister Crowley.This 660 pager begins with Nicholas Urfe recounting his background as an only child of middle class parents, stickler brigadier father, an officious military man down to his toes, a man forever trotting out words like discipline and tradition and responsibility to undergird his position on any topic, obedient housebound mother, public school education (what in the US is called private school), short stint in the army during peacetime and then reading English at Oxford.
The problem is, I can't seem to stop picking it up again.We are thrown, whether we like it or not into the addled frantic mind of Nicholas Urfe, a man in the middle of a suspenseful psychological experiment.
All the while questioning everything I knew about love, about obligations, about intelligence, trust, truth, fiction, theater, and of course freedom.I don't know if I fully understand the book, just as Urfe doesn't fully understand the experiment.
And that love, and freedom, means that you are willing to accept the kidney punch, if that's what it takes to understand.
Με ολοφάνερη την αγάπη του συγγραφέα για την Ελλάδα της απόλυτης γεωφυσικής και πολιτιστικής θεϊκής κληρονομιάς της, μας μεταφέρει σε ένα ελληνικό νησί όπου συντελείται το μυστήριο-φαντασία-πραγματικότητα,απόκρυφη ανθρώπινη φυση-ελευθερία και αυτοπραγμάτωση- διαλογισμός.
Γνωρίζει σχεδον τυχαία το Μάγο,έναν κοσμοπολίτη,πλούσιο, παράξενο και ιδιόρρυθμο επιχειρηματία, που έχει μια υπέροχη βίλα στο πιο απομονωμένο σημείο του νησιού.
Ένα θέατρο του παραλόγου με σκηνικό τη βίλα πάνω στη θάλασσα και αρχίζουν να συνυφαίνονται το ψέμα και η αμφισβήτηση με την πραγματικότητα και τον έρωτα.
Το κυρίαρχο στοιχείο σε αυτή την υπέροχη γραφή ειναι η ταύτιση του αναγνώστη με τον πρωταγωνιστή του παιχνιδιού που έχει στηθεί και την συναίσθηση όλων των ψυχολογικών του μεταβολών.
this book fucked me up.
its also an intense love story of sorts, the main character is a completely fleshed out, real, flawed person who you relate to and fear for and empathize with.
the premise is that this british guy gets a teaching job on a small island in greece soon after WWII ends and becomes intwined in the lives/mind games of this man and his crew...just when you (meaning the protagonist) think you know whats really going on with these people, it all changes and youre left more baffled and curious and invested than ever.
This is a book that can be easily dismissed when we are guarded, cynical, fearful or imperious.
I started this book at a remote location with very small font that hurt my trifocal vision....and yet....amidst mosquitoes, overheating and copious amounts of food I returned over and over until my vision gave out and I fouind a larger print Anita Brookner to round out my week.
I started by resisting this book and I was guarded, cynical, fearful and imperious towards it just as the protagonist was as he went through a most profound personal transformation from self-absorption to self-awareness.
He is driven mad by sexual desire by two twin sisters while Alison haunts him from back home.
So here goes...What the hell happened there then?I have got no idea what happened.Can anyone explain what happened?Did John Fowles even know what was going on?Is everyone else confused?Good.This book is on the 1001 Books to Read Before you Die list.
I am proposing they move it to the 1001 Books to Confuse the Living Baby Cheesus out of you Before You Die and Even After You are Dead You Might Still be Wondering Exactly What The Hell That Was All About list.Principally the story of commitmentophobic Oxford graduate, Nicholas Urfe, who runs away from his girlfriend and gets a summer job teaching on a picturesque Greek Island.
If you, dear reader, consider that The Magus was partially written nearly 60 years ago (begun in the early 50s, published in '65, revised in '76), its risky political and sexual behavior and twisted plot now seems the apex of modernity of post-war culture.
But as he reflects on his motivation in writing, he realizes that The Magus must "remain a novel of adolescence, written by a retarded adolescent" and that freedom, one of the central themes of the novel, must be grasped by the writer to create whatever worlds he or she damn well pleases.
I want to admit that, although one could never call this book even remotely nice to women (or homosexuals or black men), it is-not excusable-but explainable by the era it was written in.
When women were shits because men said they were.
One cannot have omniscience with someone playing god.One can say that, perhaps, at the time it was written it was a good book.
I enjoyed the contrast, but ultimately I think it took it's course too far and, as I said before, fell off the cliff without a rope.Blog | Instagram | Twitter | Pinterest | Shop | Etsy
I had no idea what this book was about.
I decided about a third of the way through the book that it was one of the worst things I had ever read.
But, due to some strange self-flagellatory compulsion, I told myself there was no way I was going to let it beat me, so I slogged through, teeth clenched, until the end.
About the film, Woody Allen is to have said, "If I could live my life over again, I would do everything the same except for seeing 'The Magus'".
As for the book, I couldn't have said it better myself, Woody.
Ας ειπωθεί μονάχα ότι όλος αυτός ο αλλιώτικος κόσμος που αποκαλύπτεται στο Μπουράνι της Φράξου [σημ.: το ‘περιφραγμένο’ νησί του Μάγου δεν είναι άλλο από τις Σπέτσες, όπου ο Fowles δίδαξε το 1951 και το 1952 σε ένα ιδιωτικό οικοτροφείο], μπρος στα μάτια του άλλοτε κατάπληκτου κι άλλοτε οργισμένου καθηγητή της Αγγλικής, Νικόλα Ερφ, δεν είναι απλά μια ψυχρά υπολογισμένη άσκηση φαντασίας ή ένα ενδιαφέρον εγκεφαλικό παιχνίδι με ενορχηστρωτή τον ίδιο τον Fowles ή έστω τον ‘Μάγο’, τον αλλόκοτο ιδιοκτήτη μιας βίλας στις άκριες του νησιού, αλλά μια περιπλάνηση του αναγνώστη σ’ ένα αξεδιάλυτο όνειρο ή, ορθότερα, σε μια πραγματικότητα παραδοξοτήτων, όπου τα παρελθόντα των ηρώων συγκρούονται, η αφήγηση ολοένα αναδεικνύει νέες διεξόδους από τον λαβύρινθο, κι (όπου) η αίσθηση του ταξιδέματος σ’ ένα εναλλακτικό λογοτεχνικό σύμπαν χωρίς την ανάγκη ενός a priori καθορισμένου προορισμού, κάνει την ανάγνωση μια συναρπαστική, σχεδόν βιωματική εμπειρία.
Un texto brillantemente escrito, como me tiene acostumbrado el autor, capaz tanto de conducirte con ligereza y suavidad a hermosas e idílicas playas, como de voltearte hasta la desorientación o estrellarte contra las rocas de la sinrazón, y ello sin abandonar la elegancia, sin perder esa capacidad de perturbación que te sostiene fascinado a lomos de esta ola de casi setecientas páginas.
En el prólogo a la segunda edición inglesa revisada en 1977, Fowles habla de un libro que le influyó a la hora de escribir el suyo, El gran Meaulnes, de Alain Fournier (realmente cita dos más, Bevis, de Richard Jefferies, y Grandes Esperanzas, de Dickens) y del que quería copiar esa capacidad de proporcionar una experiencia que va más allá de lo literario.
Kitap sanki benim kitabımmış gibi sayfasına girip okuyucular ne demiş, beğenmiş mi beğenmemiş mi diye kontrol edeyim demiştim ki, yorum yapmamış olduğumu gördüm.
Bu kadar çok beğendiğim, beni bu kadar derinden etkileyen bir kitaba nasıl yorum yapmam diye kendime kızdım.
Herhalde okuduğum dönemde kitabın hemen ardından bir şey demek istemedim, çünkü ciddi etkilenmişliğimle sağlıklı yazamazdım.
Bana bir şey anlatan insanların ancak yüzüne bakardım, aklım romanda karakterlerde olurdu çünkü.
Okuma zevki dediğimiz şey, çok üst düzeyde romanda.
(Kitabı okuyanlar neden bu istek içinde olduğumu anlarlar.) Daha başka bir şey demek istemiyorum ancak övgü çıkıyor zira benden:)Herkese tavsiye ederim!10/10

They include a pair of beautiful young female twins (yes, two!, count 'em) of which one (and it's clear it might have been both) does all sorts of nice things to his private parts.
Isn't that cool?Apparently, he's only the latest in a succession of such experiments/interventions all conducted, you guessed it, on narcissistic young men who are much more immature than they think they are!
The book seems an unpleasant young man's jerk off fantasy (which makes his control of the book's crescendo over such a long span all the more impressive, I suppose).There's also a whole epistemological theme to the book.
الساحر أول رواية كتبها الأديب الإنجليزي جون فاولز يتتبع فيها حياة شاب يسافر إلى جزيرة يونانية للعمل 
S. Eliot's Little Gidding point beguilingly towards the direction that Conchis' tutoring will lead Nicholas - and this early part, with its spectral hauntings, shadowy tales told in charcoal tongues, and erotic temptations from a nubile maiden, one of the troupe that enacts the masques that Conchis enjoys performing, was very good and left me eager to have the mystery solved, the seeingly supernatural elements either explained or expanded upon.Unfortunately, the book then takes a complete left-turn, an increasingly silly shift into the psychoanalysis of the confused Nicholas, a vast and complex pantomime that goes from one climax to another, all pointing towards a ridiculous amount of time, money, and effort expended upon the most pedestrian after-school special of a goal.
Maestro Fowles2015 yılında ingilizce olarak okuduğum Büyücü, benim en çok etkilendiğim kitaplar içinde yer almaktadır.
Net bir şekilde görülmektedir ki, Fowles bu belirsizlik ve gayesizliği o kadar net metafiziksel olaylar içinde kurgulamıştır ki, Büyücü için Oxford'da 1978 yılında bir öğrencisiyle kitap ile olan tartışmada (aynı zamanda orjinal halinde kendi yazdığı önsözde ) ;"...
Gerçekten kitaptaki her karakteri özellikle Nicholas ve Conchis'i çok özluyorum.Ve en yakın zamanda bu mükemmel çalışmayı tekrardan okumak için doğru zamanı bekliyorum.10/10-------For English Scroll Down----------------------The Magnicifico Fowles Among many critics, this brilliant book is called one of the best mystery stories ever written, or one of the most tricky and smart stories ever written.
Ο Μάγος του Φάουλς είναι ένα από εκείνα τα βιβλία που που όλοι ξέρουμε, αλλά πολλοί δεν έχουμε διαβάσει.
Εκεί που μπαίνουν τα τεράστια βιβλία.Ο Μάγος δεν είναι βιβλίο που κατατάσσεται εύκολα: ένας νεαρός βρετανός πηγαίνει στο επινοημένο νησί Φραξός (βρίσκεται στην Ανατολική Πελοπόννησο, κοντά στις Σπέτσες), για να διδάξει έναν χρόνο σε ένα σχολείο της υψηλής κοινωνίας.
Αλλά και πάλι αυτό δεν περιγράφει ικανοποιητικά το θρίλερ που βιώνει ο αναγνώστης, μαζί με τον πρωταγωνιστή, καθώς όσο προσπαθεί να βρει απαντήσεις για αυτό που ζει, μπλέκεται ολοένα και πιο βαθιά στον ιστό που εξυφαίνεται από τις αινιγματικές φιγούρες που έχουν πάρει μέρος σε αυτό το παραμύθι.
So now that you've clicked, let the game begin.
I felt like I've already spent far too much time being frustrated by the many curves, mysteries, deceptions in this book.
These are books that indeed can be considered literary (except for Ayn Rand), and have some form of magic buried within them that attracts the 20 y/o literary set.
Death.Again, I love Fowles' prose, but part of this book felt like wading through azure pudding in a chemical fog.
There were pages and pages where I just felt tired, exhausted, with burning eyes wondering why I kept turning the pages.
Oh god, I totally totally hated this boring, rambling, long-as-shit book.
Το συγκεκριμένο βιβλίο είναι αρκετά ιδιαίτερο, περίπλοκο ως την εξέλιξη και την πλοκή και σίγουρα δεν μοιάζει με κανένα άλλο. Ένα βιβλίο στο οποίο είναι διάχυτη η αγάπη του συγγραφέα για την Ελλάδα.Ένα βιβλίο που η πραγματικότητα με τη φαντασία εναλλάσσονται.Ένα βιβλίο με ιδεολογικές και υπαρξιακές προεκτάσεις.Ένα βιβλίο, που δεν υπάρχει περίπτωση να ξεχάσεις.

Mystical Sirens on Lush Greek Isle Toy with Reality, Fidelity
is set on a lush Greek island, limned by the legends of Apollo, Artemis, Orpheus and Eurydice.
The story involves our protagonist Nicholas Urfe, the estate of a mysterious island recluse and pretty young English ladies.
While the year of the story is 1953 in the aftermath of WWII, in many ways it seems as if it could be timeless insofar as the island setting.
Truly in its own league, particularly considering it was published over 50 years ago.
Superficially, it’s too accessible for the self-proclaimed post-modern elite.Twopenny-Halfpenny Don JuanThe novel follows the exploits of a 25 year old Oxford-educated English teacher and budding poet/writer, Nicholas Urfe, who takes a two year assignment at a boarding school modelled on Eton on the fictional Greek island of Phraxos.
They’re playing a game with Nicholas that has two aspects - “one didactic, the other aesthetic.” It’s even hinted that the two girls are “nothing but a personification of your [Nicolas’] own selfishness.”The Existence of MysteriesAs with any novel, there’s a difference between reality and unreality:
John Fowles seems to have deliberately left a lot of things (including the ending) ambiguous.It's also tough to discuss the story without giving away spoilers.I think a lot of the book is about young men's inability to love.Nicholas Urfe is a handsome, confused, and directionless young Brit in 1953 post-war England.
When Nicholas returns to London he does some detective work to try to make sense of the events on Phraxos.The novel's ending is particularly ambiguous.
However, the text I followed in 3M Cloud, Fowles' 1976 revised version, was substantially different than the audio.
yıllardır beklettiğim bir romandı. her gece 150 sayfa kadar okudum, bir gece sağdan bir gece soldan tokatlandım. fowles ana karakteriyle birlikte okuru da duvardan duvara çarpıyor. psikoloji, insan davranışı, aşk, kimlik... bunun yanında ingiltere tarihi, 2. dünya savaşında yunanistan'da yaşananlar... yok yok romanda.mutlaka ve dikkatle okunması gereken bir başyapıt.
Beş ay önce kitabı okuduğumda 3 yıldız vermiş ve sevip sevmediğim konusunda emin olamamıştım.
Tahmin ettiğim gibi, zaman içinde 3 yıldızı hak etmediğine emin oldum ve favorilerimden biri haline geldi.
Okurun zihnini aylarca meşgul edebilen kitaplar iyi ki var!_________________________________________ Büyücü hakkında ne düşünmeliyim bilmiyorum.
İlginç bir okuma deneyimi oldu benim için.
Kısa bir sürede okuduysam da bunu hikayeye bayıldığım için değil, ufak çaplı bir sinir harbine girdiğimden başardım.
Sonunda da büyük bir aldatılmış hissiyle kitabın kapağını kapatıyorsunuz.
Bu kitabı sevip sevmediğimi bile bilmiyorum şu an.
Kalan kitaplarına karşı en ufak bir ön yargım yok.
–Karşıma tekrar bir Büyücü ayarında kitap çıkmazsa memnun olurum tabii-
Con sinceridad, no sé qué decir. Después de haber leído La mujer del teniente frances supe que volvería a leer otra novela de este escritor. Lo que ignoraba era que este no era el libro que tendría que haber leído. Si tuviera que definir en una palabra cómo me siento ahora, solo podría decir que CANSADA. Cansada de tanta mentira. Cansada del juego de Conchis. Cansada de los actores. Cansada de todo.
Conspiracy Theorist FantasyOh, brother.I had high hopes for this book.
It lost its power - after a while I just stopped caring whether whatever Maurice, the master puppeteer, said was true, or what the real intentions of the other characters were, or what.
(view spoiler)[In the big "reveal", Nicholas is kidnapped, drugged, gagged and taken to a dramatic procession in which a bunch of people dressed in masks a la Eyes Wide Shut tell him he has been a subject of a [totally unethical] psychological experiment.
Many many many more pages to follow, with an ending as limp as can be - somewhat didactic, it seemed to me - in which Nicholas has to learn how to treat women properly.
Its like if you took that Most Dangerous Game story and RUINED IT FOREVER.
Maurice Conchis, the enigmatic puppetmaster of the tale, is the alter ego of Fowles; leading the bewildered protagonist, Nicholas Urfe, in the same epochal, mind-fucking game that Fowles the author does with the reader.
The mind-meld one has with Urfe, and just as surely, the disconnect one has with him, is a process one has throughout the book, mirroring one's own self examination and self-loathing.
