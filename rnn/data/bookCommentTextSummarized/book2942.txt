Rather than providing a fawning or worshipful review of Roosevelt’s life, this book sets an early tone that ranges between skeptical and critical.Far from embracing Roosevelt’s large reputation, Pringle knocks TR off his pedestal, reminding the reader that every silver lining belongs to a cloud.
Rather than falling into the easy trap of incessantly praising Roosevelt, Pringle forces the reader to consider whether TR’s greatest strengths were also his most glaring weaknesses.And where some biographers may add texture to their narrative by leaning on Roosevelt’s interesting but almost frivolous adventures, Pringle focuses only on the most essential moments of his subject’s life.
An interesting biography of TR first written in the 1930s, which gives the book a unique perspective. The author uses a roughly chronological framework to tell the story of TR's life, but he isn't afraid to jump forward or backward in time when a certain event sheds light on another period.I learned quite a bit about TR from this book--he was a complex character with a fascinating life--but I'm left wanting to read another more modern, perhaps broader take on the man.
Very good comprehensive biography. Does not follow chronological order.
Not very good. I did not enjoy this book as much as I was expecting to. It's just not a vary interesting read.Watch Ken Burns!
We read this in American Studies in high school. I remember really liking it, but wonder what I would think if I read it today. I didn't realize it was written such a long time ago...
