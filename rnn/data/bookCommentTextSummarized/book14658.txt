Here Nathan Zuckerman has just published a very controversial novel (mirroring Roth's publication of the aforementioned Portnoy) and is dealing with the sudden benefits and drawbacks of fame: superficial affair with a starlet, psychotic stalkers, being told he is still living like a country bumpkin, his family's repression of their feelings of betrayal on how he portrayed them in the book...There is a lot packed into these quick-paced 220 pages.
I am not sure I will finish this trilogy but rather hit the other masterpieces in the Roth oeuvre: Sabbath's Theatre, Plot Against America, Goodbye Columbus and Operation Shylock.Note that when he refers to Carnovsky, he is referring to Portnoy's Complaint.
So good. I will have to think more about this one. I loved parts and really liked other parts, but I also know later Roth is nearly perfect, so how do I give this one five stars? Ah, oh well, I'll cross that Carnovsky bridge tomorrow.
In the end, facing criticism for what some people perceive as his “anti-Jewish” sentiments, Zuckerman breaks free from any sense of strict responsibility to his family and community and cultural tradition, choosing to be responsible to his art and the truth as he sees it, thus the title.I liked this book quite a bit, but it isn’t in the same league as his best books, Portnoy’s Complaint, American Pastoral, The Plot Against America, nor even The Ghost Writer that I just read.
Forse quello che tu dovresti cominciare a spremerti dall’anima è il figlio obbediente”.Il secondo libro con Zuckerman protagonista vede Nathan al culmine della fama.
Il prezzo però non è mai trattabile.A Zuckerman costa la rabbia del padre sul letto di morte (e come non ricordare lo schiaffo a Zeno Cosini...), la tacita sofferenza della madre, il ripudio esplicito del fratello minore (bravo ragazzo che sopporta le pene del disamore per amore del sacro vincolo coniugale).Il ritorno nei luoghi dove Nathan aveva trascorso la sua infanzia felice è un altro incontro con la distruzione: il quartiere è radicalmente trasformato, intorno a quella che era stata la sua casa crescono le erbacce.

It will certainly cool any wannabe’s ardour.Nathan Zuckerman, Roth’s alter ego, has just vaulted into the millionaire ranks with the success of his fourth novel Carnovsky, a proxy for Roth’s own Portnoy’s Complaint.
Nathan tries to comply but he is stuck in who he really is, and with the guilt that perhaps he did let his people down with his breakout novel.The novel suddenly dives into the family as Zuckerman Sr., Nathan’s father, a veteran sufferer of strokes, suffers a fatal coronary.
This is a good book for those who are familiar with Roth’s work, and in particular for those who have read Portnoy’s Complaint and other Zuckerman novels.
Ispirandomi a Martina ho scelto questo libro, il secondo della serie sullo scrittore Zuckerman, per approcciare lo stile e le tematiche di Philip Roth.La trama è infatti debole.
Il libro è costituito da una sequenza di belle scene che ruotano attorno a Zuckerman.Lo stile è senza dubbio scorrevole ed ironico, ma l'ironia avrebbe potuto essere migliore.
Probabilmente saranno sviluppate nei libri più importanti di Philip Roth.Questo suo libro mi ha in parte deluso, però mi ha dato un assaggio del suo stile e delle sue tematiche.
The second outing for Roth's alter ego Zuckerman sees him achieving remarkable success.His novel Carnovsky is a sensation - turning him into a celebrity.
For Carnovsky, you can substitute Roth's second novel Portnoy's Complaint with its onanistic obsession.Zuckerman Unbound is perhaps a kind of apologia for Portnoy's Complaint (although that's a book I love), but it is also very funny.Roth creates a great nemesis for Zuckerman in the shape of quiz contestant Alvin Pepler, who seems to be stalking Zucker, and may have malevolent intentions.
There are echoes of Pupkin in Scorsese's King of Comedy in Pepler.And even 35 years after its publication (and 50 years after its set), Zuckerman Unbound feels very contemporary in its depiction of celebrity.
Nathan Zuckerman è uno scrittore che, dopo aver conosciuto la fama che il suo libro "Carnovksy" gli ha regalato deve affrontare tutto ciò che la fama e il successo comporta e porta con sé.
Un successo che porta la firma di uno scrittore stanco di essere fermato dai fan, dalle persone, stanco di essere quello che è.
Forse non è il romanzo migliore di Roth, ma in esso vi sono molti dei temi che confluiranno nelle opere successive: dalle donne al sesso ai rapporti con la famiglia sino alla scrittura.
Una scrittura che mi ha permesso di amare e conoscere questo grande scrittore.
Un po’ sconslusionato.Nathan Zuckerman a cui accadono cose. In un certo senso manca la gestione delle parti, manca l’arrangiamento.A tratti sembra di leggere dei siparietti tragicomici. E questo penalizza la visione d’insieme. Per il resto si legge facile e qualche momento godibile c’è, che la classe felpata di Roth non scompare d’un tratto in cantina.Ma un po’ pochino per farmi sobbalzare.Riservato ai fedeli. [65/100]

سبک فیلیپ راث - حالا بعد از خواندن سومین رمان از او با اطمینان بیشتری می‌گویم - این است که پیرنگ اصلی ساده‌ای را برمی‌گزیند، و به فراخور موقعیت، غرق گذشته‌ای که آن موقعیت را به وجود آورده می‌شود.
در کتاب‌های راث هم راوی تبدیل می‌شود به افکار شخصیت داستان و بعد می‌شود یک دانای کل و به تعبیر من جایگاه یک «فرا-راوی» را برای خود می‌سازد.این تاثیر پذیری از ادبیات و مسخش به سینما کار نابی است، کاری که فقط از الکس راس پری جوان برآمده و فیلمش - و فیلم‌هایش - را شاهکار تمام عیار کرده است.درباره‌ی گانه‌ی اول این مجموعه (این کتاب گانه‌ی دوم است) در گودریدز نوشته بودم.
Even slightly better than The Ghost Writer.. amazing characters, beautiful prose.. 4*
i must not be the only one who feels cheated when they read a roth novel, always expecting more because of his super-sized reputation only to find two-dimensional characters, caricatures really, with even more simplistic portrayals of women to accompany his petty whining and shallow revelations.
do reviewers not dare criticize how lame it is to pat yourself on the back for a character's attempt at a one-liner?
or note that every character delivers speeches in the same voice, without the slightest hesitation?
is there a part of the city i'm unaware of where people give monologues as if they were the only one on stage?
I don't think this coincidence has any cosmic significance, but it sure was convenient.I think Roth has fallen out of favor a bit among my peers -- even in his NYT obituary he was linked so emphatically to Updike and Bellow, and it's true that the sex-crazed male novelists of the middle of the last century now seem perverse only in their ridiculousness.
He wrote some ridiculous sex stuff, sure, but always with a level of self-awareness and humor.
New York City helps in this; so does Jewish culture; so does Roth's gift for telling tales tersely, compressing little narratives within narratives, summing up character's with a trait, a quirk, a certain predictable reaction to everything, funny or sad.Nathan Zuckerman is, in some ways, the least persuasive of the characters in the book because he is so earnest, the constant straight man, the only figure who has everything figured out about how you distance yourself from your material (and thereby your life.) There's a kind of yearning in him not to be the author of the send-up satire Carnovsky, but rather the author of filial loyalty or romantic love or marital constancy, if not fidelity.
Ovvero.Come Nel Mio Tempo Libero Trasformai La Fama E La Fortuna In Un DisastroZuckerman Scatenato, 
Does the artist have no responsibility towards his loved ones, his family?
His father dies (with the word "bastard" on his lips), and once his brother is pushed a bit, you see how much he despises what zuckerman has made of himself (and his family), with his writing.
The fame factor is also a pretty funny part, the way other people act with him, and how they seem to own him, most of the time thinking he is the character in his book.
Very funny, and sad at the same time.
Zuckerman's book sounds much like Roth's own novel "Portnoy's Complaint" which brought him notoriety, wealth, and fame.
There is first Philip Roth, his relationship to his novel, "Portnoy's Complaint" and his relationship to the character he created, Zuckerman.
These factors reach back, of course, to Roth and to "Portnoy's Complaint." Zuckerman in the novel must fight off both adoring fans and threatening critics.The first part of the book develops Zuckerman's relationship with a fan, Alvin Pepler, who appears out of the blue.
Pubblicato nel 1981, è la continuazione delle vicende (iniziate nel romanzo "Lo scrittore fantasma") che coinvolgono lo scrittore Nathan Zuckerman che adesso, inaspettatamente, arriva al grande successo godendone e subendone conseguenze e contraccolpi (proprio come successe allo stesso Roth dopo la pubblicazione di "Lamento di Portnoy").
Il protagonista deve tenere a bada, durante tutto il romanzo, Alvin Pepler, un personaggio dispotico, folle, molesto, ansiogeno e maniacale che si trasforma da iniziale fan, per quanto invadente, a stalker pretenzioso e furioso.
It's hard to see these separately, all of them being part of the larger story, long chapters in a Zuckerman epic. But Roth seems considerably less angry for these novels which is refreshing after so much rage
The Bech stories start with the author already a legendary writer, roughly a counter culture one hit wonder from the hippy years.
And in “Zucherman Unbound” we have an early story of a writer, feeling on the same path as Bech, when the sudden fame due to an early novel has just hit.
In both stories, there’s a sense our authors are going with the flow and observing what is happening around them, and in both cases trying to avoid the attention fame brings.
At the end of the book, you get a “you can never go back home” moment, and it feels like the next Zuckerman story can take him on a different route.
I think it's time for me to accept that Philip Roth is my comfort food; that I might not always like him-- indeed, I often hate his stupid, self-obsessed, vaguely-misogynist, emotionally-stunted guts-- but that I love him, and I need his books about books.
Nathan Zuckerman (the "Unbound" one) is the "character" who Roth "created" in his excellent novel "The Ghost Writer." He's a Jewish-American novelist who writes a book called "Carnovsky" (that's a great title, btw) about a Jewish-American with rather peculiar sexual habits.
I've read descriptions of his work which call him the most significant American novelist since Faulkner.
"Zuckerman Unbound" makes explicit reference to Thomas Wolfe's novel "Look Homeward Angel".
I haven't read that novel but from Roth's references, I take it that it has a similar theme to Wolfe's other novel "You Can't Go Home Again".
Thomas Wolfe explored a similar theme of writerly alienation in his novels and I must say that he did in a far better way than Roth did in "Zuckerman Unbound." I am truly puzzled by the commentary that I have seen by professional critics of this novel.
Unfortunately for him, he did it by writing a book that is sexually graphic (not quite a a novelized version of Pasolini's "Salo", which would be an interesting world to live in if that was a bestseller, despite a certain book about grey silk ties attempting to convince us this is shocking behavior) and now everyone is convinced that his book is autobiographical or that he's capable of doing all the things described in his novel, suggesting that one of the things missing from the people in the late sixties was the concept of "imagination." Considering that people weren't convinced that the most famous band of their time didn't literally ride around in a yellow submarine, it may be a bit of a stretch.The early sections of the novel are that uncomfortable level of hilarity that you expect from this kind of thing, with Zuckerman attempting to get used to his new digs in NYC, dealing with a split with his most recent lover, getting recognized by random people as a sexual deviant they want to high-five and sign their copy, and wondering if he should hire a bodyguard from all the nuts he keeps running into.
“In the beginning, when he heard someone call after him out on the street, he would wave hello to show what a good sport he was. It was the easiest thing to do, so he did it. Then the easiest thing was to pretend not to hear and keep going. Then the easiest thing was to pretend that he was hearing things, to realize that it was happening in a world that didn’t exist. They had mistaken impersonation for confession and were calling out to a character who lived in a book. Zuckerman tried taking it
With any success comes a little bit of luck, and Zuckerman is surely not egomaniacal to deny the presence of luck I mean he’s a writer, not a chef, and six weeks into his new life he’s starting to object to the idea of having lady luck on his side and would like to return to a life of anonymity.
Zuckerman strongly states that Carnovsky was a work of pure fiction but mother isn’t so sure as she has been shamed by affected people and believes her own son is hiding behind his characters.
Il libro di chi si «nutre solo di parole», con l'illusione che le parole finiscano dentro al loro suono.
Zuckerman, qui, è oramai uno scrittore famoso – dopo l'uscita del suo libro scandalo Carnovsky – e va incontro alla fama, ai disturbatori seriali che pensano di avere in tasca la verità (interpretativa) di ciò che ha scritto il loro autore di riferimento.
Nathan è sballottato a destra e a manca, soprattutto dall'idea che i suoi lettori si sono fatti di lui, sovrapponendolo allo scatenato protagonista del suo libro-scandalo.
Nathan si perde, le sue certezze sembrano venire meno, così come il suo passato sembra oramai defunto e tradito.
I don’t particularly like Nathan Z.
So, in Nathan Z., Roth has created a “real” “character” – messy, me-centric, confused, trying to find his self and hold it down long enough to get a good look before it changes right in front of him – just as Roth attempts to define storytelling and the author-character relationship – the celebrity identity vs.
It is the fact that Roth actually attempts to answer this question through fiction that I read and admire him.I believe he went to my college, which is amusing because it is nowhere that you would think Philip Roth would have studied.
I'm starting to become obsessed and don't want to finish the summer without reading a majority of Roth's pre-nineties work --- I love esp.
The Roth doppelganger (there are many in his work) Alvin Pepler is one of his best, something out of Gogol, a hapless former quiz show also-ran who pursues Zuckerman to help him write a Broadway musical about his experience.
This novel is a navel-gazer, but Zuckerman/Roth is always hardest on himself.
The idea that Roth is a self-loathing anti-Semite or a misogynist is preposterous and makes me want to take up smoking again, and darts.
At first, this book may feel a little to self-congratulatory - Nathan Zuckerman is a thinly veiled Roth in the midst of success over a rather sexual and controversial book, alienating his lovers, friends and family, and Zuckerman even from himself.
A romp with a movie starlett feels like a doldrum in this book, but Roth really pulls things together in the last chapter, especially, in a book that is ultimately about artistic identity--when is an author himself and when is he his own character?
And when does the artist serve his family and when must he estrange them for the good of his art?
Typically well written, but charmless.Oh, I just remembered a soupçon of charm.
It's 1969 and Zuckerman has just come out with a racy literary bestseller, giving him new fame and celebrity.
A young secretary sends him a photo of herself in black underwear on her Livingston, New Jersey lawn, reading an Updike novel.
After Zuckerman has examined her body with a magnifying glass for several hours, he forwards the photo to John Updike "along with a note asking if Updike would be good enough to reroute photographs of Zuckerman readers mistakenly sent to him."Most of the characters, including the awful Alvin Pepler (Zuckerman's stalker), Zuckerman's relatives, and a sexy Irish actress Zuckerman has a one night stand with (who is having an affair with Fidel Castro), I wanted to run far away from.
