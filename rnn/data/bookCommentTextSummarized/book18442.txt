____________________________________________  “Love is illogical, love had consequences--I did this to myself, and I should be able to take it.”  ____________________________________________ ☆☆☆☆☆5 WHOLY STARS!☆☆☆☆☆  Marie Lu never disappoints .I had really high expectations for this sequel and they were all met.This may not be my best review,because I am still under the obsession of "Outlander",so I might miss some parts or mess something.I am ready for the finale "Champion"! Prodigy  is an act
,I always wanted to know more about the city,and outside it.We are introduced here with the underground world,also the Colonies.I always wandered how the Colonies were like,and I never imagined they would be that developed.They were better than the Republic.Also the scene with the plane was awesome,one of my favorite scenes of this book.____________________________________________
____________________________________________I highly recommend this book if you like dystopians.It is one of my favorite dystopian series and I can't wait to read the finale!
Reading this book is like being strapped into fucking Oblivion and forced to complete six rounds of it while someone holds a gun to your head and says, "If you pee your pants, I will shoot you."A quick low-down is that June and Day, our heroes, head to Las Vegas where they're welcomed into the fold of the Patriots, who are anti-Republic revolutionaries.
This plan involves June and Day being pushed around like chess pieces, and along the way they discover secrets about the plan, the Republic and themselves that forces them to question everything they believe is true.There's also lots of making out, sploding, fighter jets, soul-destroying death, kicking and punching, sexy military uniforms, adorable children, jewellery, betrayal, selflessness, selfishness, lover's quarreling and a big, fat love square.The love square was fucking awesome.
A year ago, when I read Legend, I complained about the world building.
Mind you, I did think it was a fast-paced, exciting read, but it felt incomplete as a dystopian novel because I couldn't fully visualize how the society fit into the world as a whole.
I felt like Marie Lu was purposefully keeping secrets from me just to string me along to book two.
The "old" Day that warmed my heart in Legend was back.June, on the other hand, I liked very much.
*sniff* In my Legend review, I complained about the illusion of Day and June's invincibility.
^My thoughts on having to wait a whole year for the next book. I've been so pleasantly surprised by my long-awaited January sequels, first Through the Ever Night, then Everbound... and now Prodigy has come in and turned a series I was on the fence about into one where I anxiously obsess over what will happen in the next installment. Marie Lu really focuses on developing her characters here, whilst still exploring the politics of her dystopian society and introducing one really evil twist to thi
Marie Lu really focuses on developing her characters here, whilst still exploring the politics of her dystopian society and introducing one really evil twist to this story.The highlight of this book, for me, was Anden.
She knows why and how her dystopian society came into being and doesn't throw around empty words like "rebellion" and "war" hoping that will be enough to satisfy her readers.I was one of the minority that didn't feel much either way for June and Day in Legend, I liked them enough because they didn't annoy me or anything like that but I thought there was a lack of character development.
Wow, what a fun sequel! If assassination plots and stealing fighter jets weren't enough, I'd read it for the *whispers* bathtub scene alone.
Este segundo libro de la serie es incluso mejor que el primero porque conocemos más de los personajes, sus dudas de a quién le deben su lealtad.
El personaje de Anden es el punto focal de la historia y las incógnitas de que pasará con La República.
Y el final, oh el final, me mata la incertidumbre.✨✨✨Honestly, whoever that hasn't read this series should run to do it, it's fantastic.This second book in the series is even better than the first because we know more about the characters, their doubts about who owe their loyalty.
The character of Anden is the focal point of the story and the unknowns that will happen with The Republic.And the end,Oh the end, the uncertainty kills me.
I thought I could tell where this story was heading but then it went and totally surprised me.  "...all it takes is one generation to brainwash a population and convince them that reality doesn't exist." For real, there is seriously zero second book syndrome here. The world is creative and the story is super character-driven, which makes it even more emotional. Marie Lu's writing is just SO strong. I liked The Young Elites, but this is more like Warcross!! It's so well executed that it deserves

So glad I finally read this (and can't believe I'm totally back into dystopian YA now).
I'm hoping something can change in the last book =( June and Day are sneaking their way into Vegas.
Day gets some new armor so to speak.
They make plans to assassinate the new Elector, Anden.
not everything is as it seems and maybe, just maybe, Anden can be trusted.
June goes undercover so to speak and finds out some information, the kind she wasn't expecting to find out.
I still loved the book.
I loved the action.
I loved most everything but that one revelation and I will never tell.
Of course, most of you have read the books anyway.
“I suddenly feel so stupid for telling her that I love her, as if I’d be able to make her love me in return like some common girl from the streets.
“You think I like June because she arrested me?
I wanted to throw my mobile phone out of the window because of her, and then again i was still interested in reading her POVs. She hasn't changed at all and still says anything that first comes to mind without actually thinking about consequences.
But, i like the way she thinks:
Don’t I look like I’m lusting?
❝He is beauty inside and out.He is the silver lining in a world of darkness.He is my light.❞ I completely loved Legend.
4 stars, but I still enjoyed it.
I loved Marie's The Young Elites and The Rose Society and I needed more of her writing since I had to wait for the 3rd book to publish, still am.
And after reading Legend, I was glad I didn't have to wait to read the rest of the trilogy.
I did wait even though I owned the books, but I think we all have been in that situation where you want to f
Even with that, he agrees to help The Patriots if they help him back and as he and June help each other out, they're able to speak their voices for the people and Day is able to see his little brother Eden again, just what he was hoping.As for the other characters, Tess was a complete bitch and I hated her for changing so damn much.
When you imagine the fall of the US as a democracy, what kind of state do you think will emerge?
My point: Prodigy was an interesting read for me because it depicts the US falling into ruin, then splitting into two halves, each spiraling down to become one of the options above.
I couldn't give Prodigy a full five stars because of LOVE TRIANGLES.
What I can't stand is when authors turn perfectly kind and lovable people into complete dicks for the sake of resolving a love triangle conflict.

الحكم كله في يد الشركات الرأسمالية الكبري أيضا تم التطرق له في الرواية بشكل ممتاز -واتمني ان يظهر مرة اخري في الجزء القادمميزة عالم الرواية أنه غير شاطح في الخيال العلمي فلا يفسد الاجواء الديستوبيا كما فعلت سلسلة ألعاب المجاعات فجعلت التفاعل مع اجواء الرواية وفكرة الانظمة الفاسدة والخديعة في السياسات بشكل اوضح~~~~~~~~~~~~~~The Characters الشخصيات-----------------It's not insta-love anymore here..I just loved how it gets more logical and mature this time from both Day and June..The struggle between them due to their different background, and their past life...
this book was amazing. the ending was bittersweet, i cried. Marie Lu knows how to make you feel for a character. the ending. Day. Oh my gosh just so surprising. Day/ Daniel was such an inspiration! just wow. and June was such a strong character, she was even a strong willed character in her weakest moments. Just go get this book! its worth every penny!
In this sequel, we observe a lot of character growth in which both Day and June are fighting against deeply rooted indoctrinated beliefs, not knowing who they should trust in this messed up world anymore.
At least I'm sure we'll get to see more of it in the third book, so it wasn't too big a disappointment.A sequel worthy of its name, Prodigy not only continues the story of our beloved Day an June, it strengthens and molds it, proving itself to be an essential part of this series.
I AM AN EMOTIONAL WRECK RIGHT NOW I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT TO SAY basically, this book did NOT disappoint but it did destroy meI'll admit it did take me longer to get into than Legend but when I got hooked I literally couldn't put this book downJune and Day will be the death of me that is all I have to say about themI loved the turn the story has taken in this book, the plot has thickened massively and I love it!!
The plot twists will blow you away and completely take control of your emotions...not going to say anymore because I nEED TO READ CHAMPION RIGHT AWAY WISH ME LUCK
2. The dialogue felt unnaturally stiff and the lack of communication between June and Day made me inwardly cringe more times than I can count.
Their understanding does get better towards the end, but they had way too many awkward moments during the book for me to devotedly cheer them on.
4. I never thought I'd say this about a Legend novel, but there's more angst in this book than action.
I'd become deeply invested in Day and June and their romance by the end of Legend, and now I'll be surprised if we can get a half-way decent sequel to Prodigy.
SO GOOD. Action packed and heart wrenching. Flew through it.Just uploaded my booktalk, review/reaction/discussion, yesterday! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fF9xWm...
This book took the feels to a new level, at least for me.June and Day are on the run, trying to survive and have hopes of finding the patriots and bartering with them to save Eden.
Even now, after reading it a second time- I was still racing through yet trying to savor every precious moment June and Day have together.
He's bound at heart by so many factors- guilt over his family, Tess, and this strange connection with June.
It helps.I'd say if you connected to the characters at all in book one- it is definitely worth continuing the series.
“Day, the boy from the streets with nothing except the clothes on his back and the earnestness in his eyes, owns my heart.”I must have read Legend three, maybe four years ago.
Don't get me wrong: I love YA and I love dystopian fiction but I think I might have liked this book more if I had read it a few years earlier.
As I said, I've read enough books set in the former United States that feature fractions, rebels, revolutions and starcrossed lovers.
Prodigy couldn't add anything new to the plot.
It wasn't a bad book though, so I'll read Champion anyway.
So take it, June."So. That ending.June was likeAnd Day was likeAnd the both of them were likeAnd it's better if I don't tell you what I was like because the image of that ball of tears and pain wouldn't be very pleasing to the eye nor the stomach and I want nothing but your welfare.
(hide spoiler)] This suffices for me to love him.Going back to the flaws of the first part of the book, another fact I can't help but mention is the fact that way too many things reminded me of The Hunger Games.
It was bizarre that Day seemed to care more for Tess than June, even though he was meant to be in love with June.
It ended up looking like Day was just in lust/obsessed with June rather than in love with her, and I don't think that was how the June/Day romance was meant to be perceived.-The romance was just a mess… Day claimed to love June yet he wanted and worried about Tess more.
Surely, the girl he loved would matter more than a good friend, regardless of how long he'd known each girl??-I was pissed that Day said that he would save Tess instead of June if he had to choose between them.
A little too young, but I get Lu's reasons for making her 15.
The first is I didn't love Day as much in this book, and I really needed to.
Here's the thing (view spoiler)[Love triangles are great as long as they involve two boys and a girl.
(hide spoiler)]I also didn't love all the dreams June and Day kept having.
I think they are cheap devices in literature and yes that's coming from someone who coined the term "Dream Travel." It's just dream travel is real and what happens in dreams isn't and so it feels like they don't really move the plot along.
This is even better then the first book! I really enjoyed June in this book a lot more than I did in the last one, I am really looking forward to reading the next book but I don't want it to end:(
This book was fantastic!!!! I was cheering towards the end and rooting for June and Day. I am even digging and falling for Anden and his good heart. I hope he doesn't change in the last book and turn out to be one of the bad guys!!
Loved this!

همه گمان می‌برند دی توسط جوخه‌ ی آتش اعدام شده، اما حقیقت ماجرا آن است که برادر دی جانش را برای آزادی وی فدا کرد، و به جای او کشته شد.
و حالا «جون» بیش از هر کس دیگری به جرم خیانت به جمهوری تحت تعقیب است.
دو شورشی عاشق داستان، که حالا شدیداً به یاری نیاز دارند، به ناچار به جنبش وطن‌ پرستان روی می‌آورند، که دشمن قسم خورده‌ ی جمهوری ‌ست.
اما آیا واقعاً می‌توان به این افراد انقلابی اعتماد کرد؟ یا اینکه «جون» و «دی» ناخواسته به مهره‌ های ترسناک‌ترین بازی سیاسی کشور تبدیل شده ‌اند؟ ...
Did not finish!
Just too much of a romance novel for me to stomach finishing it.I really understand the importance of character development.
I finally found myself looking for other things to do rather than picking up the book to read.
That's a bad sign so I decided it was time to put this one down and move on to something else.Such a disappointment because the action of the first book of the series was sorely missing from this one.
I guess if romance is your thing you might like this one.
W O W THE FEELS THO. This was jam packed with action and ALL OF THE FEELS. Like I literally was punched in the gut a few times. omg. I just can't.
huh....I honestly am not that impressed.(14) (view spoiler)[In the end, it's the same-old, same-old "both the government and the rebels are bad" unoriginal plot twist all over again,  (hide spoiler)] just like The Hunger Games.(15) As a whole this book isn't as awful as I'd feared, but it still can't message up to be a good book.(16) But at least the author admits gay people exist...(17) Had I mentioned that both MCs are supposed to be superhumans or some unrealistic Mary Sue characters from badly written Japanese manga?
