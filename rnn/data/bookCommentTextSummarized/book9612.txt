There are thirty-four stories by the master in this volume and I might write about every single one in the book – they’re all like pearls: some just a little bit bigger and some just a little bit smaller…Vanka Zhukov, a nine-year-old boy, sent three months earlier to be apprenticed to the shoemaker Aliakhin, did not go to bed on Christmas eve.
He waited till master and apprentices went to church, then took a bottle of ink and a pen with a rusty nib from the master’s cupboard, spread out a rumpled sheet of paper in front of him, and began to write.
This is an excellent group of short stories, Chekhov's favorite form of writing. I love his stories almost without exception. He is easier to read than most of the other Classic Russian writers I have read. He was a Medical Doctor by trade, of which he was proud.. Hemingway called him an amateur writer which sounds like something he would say. My favorite story in this collection is The Black Monk.
اکثر داستان ها قشنگ بودند و خوندنی.وقتی داستان های کوتاه چخوف رو با داستان های کوتاه دیگر نویسندگان مقایسه می کنم تصور یک بنز در کنار پراید تو ذهنم مجسم میشه.تو نمایش نامه مرغ دریایی ، چخوف شرحی از خصوصیات خودش و در قالب داستان آورده بود مثل این مورد:که با دیدن هر چیزی یادداشت برداری می کرد و هر فکری که در مورد داستان های کوتاه به ذهنش می خورد رو می نوشت
اولين كتابي بود كه از چخوف ميخواندم. اگر بخواهم با داستان كوتاه هايي كه تا بحال خوانده بود مقايسه كنم ميتوانم بگويم عالي بود. زبان و نحوه ي بيان ساده داشت و در زمينه ي طنز هم موفق بود. آخرين قسمت كتاب كه در مورد نصيحت هايي به نويسنده ها بود ، از نظرم بهترين قسمت كتاب بود.اما در داستان هاي اول كتاب تكرار مشاهده ميشد و تقريبا رفته وفته خسته كننده ميشد.چخوف عزيز كاش نگاه بهتري به "زنان" داشتي تا ميتوانستم با شور و شوق بيشتري درباره ي قلم خوبت صحبت كنم . :)

6داستان کوتاه خارق العاده از چخوف..اندوه,اسقف,خواب الود..همه خدان..نقد هایی هم که بعد هر داستان داشت هم واقعا جذاب بود..
That probably sounds like a strange recommendation but Anton Chekhov was a very caring writer that, as a medical doctor, obviously had access to both the upper and lower rungs of society.
Both King and Poe have a very strong inclination toward the lower depths of mankind and, unlike Chekhov, their stories show a very strong inclination toward structure, particularly toward plot and definite endings.
So, by reading a couple collections, someone new to short stories could get a decent feel for the spectrum of possibilities.
بهترین بخش کتاب توصیه هاش برای بقیه نویسنده ها بود ک پایان کتاب اومده بودن و خیلی از خوندنشون لذت بردم داستانا ساده بودن و بیشتر جنبه ی طنز داشتن ولی کتاب زیاد منو جذب خودش نمیکرد یه جمله ک خیلی دوسش داشتم این بود :تنها خداست ک قادر است بدون اشتباه ،از شکست ها ،پیروزی بدست آورد.
What a sweet man! Chekhov was an unexpected surprise. I think I had only seen The Cherry Orchard at college to this point and had expected his stories to be ponderous like Tolstoy or Dostoevsky. They weren't. They were heartwarming. One of them even made me tear up--and I was alone at the time.I am suspicious that the ISBNs for this Modern Library edition are incorrect as they do not appear in the Library of Congress database.
This one recalls beery evenings when I still shuddered from the emotional impact of such simple stories. I suppose most folks at the time - the early 1990s - were swayed by Carver or Bukowski. I worked ALL the ime but recall buying this new at hawley Cooke and then being floored. The Grasshopper is the one which lingers, assuming a parallel position with Joyce's Araby and tales from Sherwood Anderson as the haunting foundation of a life spent between pages.
"I am going to order you to do something new, if you haven’t done it already. Get a collection of the short stories of Chekhov and read every one. Then read “Youth” by Joseph Conrad. I’m not suggesting that you do these things. I am ordering you to do them." - Kurt Vonnegut's life-advice to his children
In the meantime I was reading Chekhov, that’s about all I can recall.It is a strange thing, happening to me once in a while- another time and place, another book: I have been reading Wuthering Heights, an audio book version, in the Baneasa Forest, some 3-4 years ago.
Near the Baneasa forest I have been reading Fathers and Sons and many other books: that’s an area where I walk my dogs every morning and as a side show, I have one book or another.
Beats me…Coming back to Chekhov- I have a love hate relationship with the Russians, almost all things Russian.Their literature marked me from the age of 16, when I started reading Dostoyevsky, Gogol and Tolstoy.
Previously I had read a few short stories by Chekhov, in particular, The Bet. To a large extent, this was what induced me to pick up this collection.
One particular cause of disturbance was Chekhov's treatment of Jewish characters.
Most of the Jewish characters tended to be poor, filthy and stereotyped, "Herod" was used as an abuse etc.
This was surprising given (as I learnt) that Chekhov came out in support of Dreyfus.
Perhaps his support of Dreyfus was not in contradiction with how he viewed Jewish people.
My favorites: Gooseberries and Lady with a DogWithout sounding too pseudo-intellectual, I now love Chekov.
I used to avoid him like I would avoid men with goatees in coffee-bars, because frankly they would either quote from Baudelaire Fleurs de Mal or Chekov or worse yet have a dog-eared copy of Chekov in their hands while sipping a latte in a coffee bar.We did a staged version of Lady with a LapDog at the ART a couple of years ago and Three Sisters last year.
No one unerstands the subtleties of the human condition like Chekov does.It's a great book to have on the bedstand...
Quite liked this little collection. Makes me want go read some more of his works. No story was bad per se, but there were only like two or three that stood out as beyond average. I do really appreciate his writing style with particular reference to his ability to clearly illustrate his characters. They were the soul of each story.
Easygoing stories. Epic style. The stories are transmuting all the way to the point of catharsis. I loved the fact that every story had a point, a message, or critics against the wrongs in society and in humanity. Truly healing and magical.
Chekhov's stories teach you to "let go" when you write. You can go in and out of reality just like the ordinary mind does. Chekhov reminds one of the works of Chagall.
"People who lead a solitary existence always have something in their hearts which they are eager to talk about." --from the short story, About Love, Chekhov.
تا جایی که خاطرم هست اولین کتابیه که از چخوف میخوونم ولی متاسفانه نتونستم با این سری داستان های کوتاه ارتباط برقرار کنم... 😞
It does not contain the longer stories like The Steppe of Ward No. 6, but it does include a judicious selection by the translator Elisaveta Fen.Chekhov's stories portray individuals and their relations with each other in specific situations.
I particularly enjoyed stories like "Enemies", "Teacher of Literature", and "The Cross of Anna".
In response to her success with the governor he awards her husband the cross of Anna, which he wears on a ribbon around his neck.
"Teacher of Literature" portrays a favorite Chekhovian theme -- the emptiness of material prosperity and the tedium of provincial life with the gradual erosion of the 'happiness' of a young man.
I won't attempt to review the writing itself, Anton Chekhov is someone anyone interested in good literature should experience for themselves; he's one of my all-time favorite writers.
To be honest, I suggest if you really want to read Chekhov, don't look at too many, if any at all, reviews of his work (or at least don't take them to heart), many people have conflicting critical views of himself and his writing, the best way to get to know Chekhov is in a personal way, by delving into his work without preconceived notions.
I dont know if this review can warrant justice to the magnificence and brilliance of Anton Chekhov.
All you need to do is read one story.
And you'll be finding any time possible to read each and every other remaining story.
Each of the Russian greats have their talents of analyzing the human psych.
For Chekhov, his is the ability to develop characters.
And this talent enables him to delve deep into the souls of these characters, yet still maintaining fidelity in perspective.
And as the reader, it is sometimes overpowering that we start questioning and developing our own character.
Read it!!
Gave up part way through first story I read, The Lady With the Dog. People having an affair, being stupid, didn't care about them. Not a good intro to Chekov. I like the Chekov on Star Trek better at this point.
Chekhov's short stories are just as good as his full-length plays, as far as I'm concerned.
Wow, what a great experience
I'm not a short story person, but I really like Chekhov's tone and style.*Read excerpts for school junior year college*
Brilliant! The "The Lady with the Dog" was exceptional!
About 2/3 through this book of Chekhov short stories. Chekhov is interesting. Many stories are vignettes of life without plots. Many seem to stop where other stories would begin.
Love "The Lady with the Dog" and "Misery."
