It is here in this fifth volume of the Chronicle series that we at last come to the formation of those first American colonies.
Providing exhaustive coverage of the settlement and formation of the colony of Virginia and it's governmental changes and experiences before eventually moving on to cover the founding of Maryland, the Carolinas, and Georgia, this volume is unfortunately less well written than the preceding volumes covering the development of the New World.
Nevertheless is remains an adequate introduction to the initial foundations of those first colonies and a necessary background for the understanding of the birth of our nation.
