Okay, let me get the following  BOLD STATEMENT out of the way. If I absolutely HAD to choose my single favorite BADASS “action” protagonist of all time HARI MICHELSON (AKA CAINE) would get the nod.    Now I have read many books with main characters who “went to 11” on the 10 level kick-ass meter  so picking a favorite or comparing one to the other is very hard to do. However, overall, taking all aspects of nut stomping, bone-breaking, dialogue-delivering (very important), head-splitting, “you d
(Tournament of Badass Champions.) ********END BRIEF INTERLUDE********Anyway, just for comparison's sake (and so you know I have thought this through) here are a few of my favorite characters that Caine was reluctantly required to bitch-slap on his way to the title of HIS ROYAL BADNESS AND MOST MAIN MAN:1.
Logan "Ninefingers" (from Abercrombie's First Law Trilogy)....sorry Bloody Nine***All of you guys are awesome, but unfortunately somebody had to win***So let me tell you a little about Hari Michelson and the world of Heroes Die. The book itself is one of my ALL TIME FAVORITE novels.
THIS WAS FANTASTIC!So this book is really hard to describe, it takes place in a futuristic dystopian society that uses crazy technology to send "actors" to an alternate reality called Overworld, a traditional Fantasy-ish world.
The hero, Hari, is basically the Sylvester Stallone (at his peak) of actors, and his wife, another actor, gets trapped in the Otherworld and he has to go save her.
WAY darker.
WAY darker.
I mean, talk about a dark anti-hero.
Talk about a cool alt-SF/Fantasy world.
I mean Hari is one of the biggest badasses I've read in a LONG time.
I can't wait to get into the next Caine book, maybe write in more detail about the Caste system on Earth and the magic system in Overworld.
Since I started with a quote from the author I will finish with another one that expresses succintly why I come back to fantasy novels so often: Much of my life has been an obsessive inquiry into philosophy, mythology, magic, religion, and the concept of the Hero (in the Joseph Campbell sense).
The novel takes place partly in/on our Earth, or at least one very like it (we get mentions of books, writers etc.
He's been around longer than most actors (see actors are more likely to die during an adventure than live to retirement...and the "episodes" where an actor dies, especially a well know actor dies make huge profits.) Hari...err, I mean Caine is the greatest killer, errr, I mean actor and adventurer out there and has legions of fans.
It's probably quite possible to read through the novel without noticing it at all if you want to.I find this an incredible book despite a few drawbacks (I found Shanna/Pallas Ril, the love interest incredibly annoying and self-involved, but then I think I/we are supposed to).
That's saying something.The novel is long and the crappy cover is off-putting, but the length does the tale very excellent justice, so I recommend that ya'll just ignore the eyesore and pick up this classic.
Think quantum teleportation to an alternate world where magic works.
Afterwards, well, I was flabbergasted to discover that he could think as well as he fought, and with his estranged wife, they caused so much damn havoc on both sides of the veil.The best part of this novel was watching all the pieces line up and then watch them all fall.It was glorious.
Going from the cover of the book, I’d say poor marketing may have been a factor – or perhaps Stover just wrote this too early to catch the more recent surge in dark fantasy/grimdark popularity.Some might argue that this book is actually Science Fiction because some of the action happens in a dystopian future Earth dominated by a corporate caste system and obsessed with bloodsport entertainment – except a lot of the story happens in a parallel universe version of Earth called Overworld – which is a typical medieval style fantasy setting where magic is real.
First off, cheers to Thomas Stacey for the recommendation.. This book is definitely going in as one of my absolute faves for 2017. "I have lived every day of my life only to bring myself here to this moment and it has been worth every moment" This author has written an epic love story that you're not even totally aware of until you're sucked in. This isn't hearts and roses strewn on the floor. This is like blood, guts, broken bones, severed limbs, bring down the gaddamn world kind of love story.

Like your favourite epic love story ain't got nothing on this.
Like i said this isn't some quintessential love book.
You're introduced to an eclectic range of characters from: Berne - this dude was bloody insane, like if you ever meet someone like this, just run!; To that snivelling, whinny piece of shit, poet boy.
i mean, really, she was a shit.
This book would have been a five star read if it had just been trimmed by about 100-150 pages.
The main plot doesn't even kick in until 100 pages in, for example.
When the book does get to the point, though, it is great.
The worlds that the book takes place in are dark and captivating, the action is brutal, and the characters are all pretty interesting.
It also has a lot to say about the ways in which people are entertained (even at the expense of others).
I am glad I read it, but I don't know if I would read any of the other books in the series.
Executive Summary: Dark Fantasy/Sci-Fi that is more gruesome in places than anything I've read from Joe Abercrombie or George R.R. Martin. Full Review It's hard to believe this book was published in the late 90's. It would be right at home with all the Dark Fantasy that seems to be abundant these days. This book is way more gruesome in places than most of the so-called "grimdark" fantasy I've read recently. This seems to be a book that has gone under the radar of most fantasy fans.This is defini
Executive Summary: Dark Fantasy/Sci-Fi that is more gruesome in places than anything I've read from Joe Abercrombie or George R.R. Martin.
This book is way more gruesome in places than most of the so-called "grimdark" fantasy I've read recently.
You won't find a Brienne of Tarth, or Arya Stark here.If you don't read the description before starting the book, you'll likely be a little taken aback when an assassin in a fantasy novel starts making references to CRTs and Elmer Fudd.
The story feels pretty self contained, so while there are other books, I don't feel a need to rush out and read the next one.It got a little slow in places though.
Like others have said the book takes place in the near future here on Earth, but in that time we have discovered and alternate universe version of our planet called Overworld by us and Ankhana by them.““But I can explain it to you—and your viewers—the same way it was explained to me.
“Hollywood” of that time period takes things to the extreme, you see, Hari Michelson, our main protagonist is an actor playing a part in Overworld as Caine.
Also, and I haven't seen this before, modern words and metaphors were used to describe fantasy things (remember it's someone from the future so they would think the way we do).The main character, Caine, is the biggest badass you've ever seen.
He's right up there with Kvothe, Locke Lamora, and Gavin Guile for the most interesting badass characters.The world building is exquisite.
Matthew Stover really holds to the rule that an author should only divulge 10% of what he knows.
You will read it and think “cool!” to yourself, over and over and over again.Heroes Die has so many things going for it.
Hari Michaelson is the most famous Actor of this world, and his Overworld "character" Caine is one of the most famous men there: "relentless, unstoppable, simply the best there is at what he does." (though he's not, in fact, the best fighter in the world, or even in the book, and he's very far from invincible.)This is probably not for everyone, and Stover's writing style can be over the top - his personal writing motto is "I Swear by the Power of All Dark Gods that I Will Write Every Fucking Word Balls-Out for Glory." But it's not *bad* writing - as far as writing every fucking word etc etc goes, I think it's about as good as it gets.Stover himself described the book this way: "It's a piece of violent entertainment that's a meditation on violent entertainment- as a concept in itself, as a cultural obsession.
Don't let the crappy cover fool you, this is a great book! I'm surprised this hasn't made its way to the big, or small, screen. It has everything, kick ass main character (who develops throughout the story), fast paced action, magic and fantasy elements, gods, war, a really touching love story and reality tv. Wow......just.....wow.
3.5 stars The pros:  Great combat scenes, lots of fast-paced action, dystopian future Earth reminiscent of ancient history repeating itself, and plots within plots ... all for your entertainment.  The cons:  Prolific profanity (although I suppose it could be argued that it's all relevant and 'in character'), graphic violence (again relevant and 'in character'), lust/love seen through testosterone-tinged viewpoint and only one decent character afloat in the grey morass of moral ambiguity. Heroes
3.5 stars
Great combat scenes, lots of fast-paced action, dystopian future Earth reminiscent of ancient history repeating itself, and plots within plots ...
all for your entertainment.
Heroes Die drug me through Ankhana at Caine's frenetic pace on his quest to rescue his ex-wife Pallas Rill.
The beauty and grace of some of the individual combat sequences took my breath away.
Oddly, I found myself comparing this story to The Hunger Games from a broader, visionary perspective.
Both stories have dystopian totalitarian governments ruling Earth and 'bread and circuses' style entertainment to keep the masses (the workers/castes) in their place.
He handled two distinct worlds very well.
One is a high tech, rather dystopian world, the other one full of swords & sorcery.
Not a new idea, but it was a rather new way of putting it together with plenty of excitement throughout.
The characters were well drawn with logical, sometimes complex motivations.
There were multiple heroic figures, plenty of bad guys, & they didn't always stay where they started out.
They grew, diminished or died in a complex web.I can definitely see where a second book has a lot of threads that could be spun out, but this one stands well enough on its own.
Middle Earth meets Las Vegas...where lesbian elves pimp hookers and manage casinos, pixy ferries groove as sexy lap warmers, and ogres and trolls are employed as bouncers.
HEROES DIE was such a kick in the rumpus!
The author has created rich, colorful worlds with strong characters that I loved, loathed, and followed with rapt attention.
The protagonist was deadlier than Chuck Norris or Bruce Lee. The female leads were tough, intelligent, and yeah, sexy.
This story would be, should be five stars...but there's one major problem...and its me.
However, it's a solid four and one half stars.
I did not have high expectations going into this one. A novel written two decades ago by an author that I never heard of. Oh my word, was I blown away! Simply put, Heroes Die is Joe Abercombie and Richard K. Morgan coming together and ripping Ready Player One a new one. Caine, take up a chair and join the hardcore company of Logan Ninefingers and Takeshi Kovacs. In the Matthew Woodring Stover's own words: "It's a pop-top can of Grade-A one-hundred percent pure whip-ass."
Wonderful... brutal... and full of intrigue and action. Why Stover is not a standard bearer for fantasy I will never know. Highly recommended.
It's set on Earth albeit many, many, many years in the future when society has evolved (or devolved, depending on the POV) into a caste system and the ideas of Abraham Lincoln, John Locke, John Kennedy and others of their ilk are considered grounds for sedition.
It's a high octane, action-adventure tale full of violence and greed that nevertheless speaks to the deeper issues of self-identity, what it means to be truly free, and what sorts of evils can arise when society is only willing to consider its own desires.
I'm not sure the book needed the epilogue.
He plays Caine, a fully-fledged badass who kicks all sorts of arse in a fantasy world.
Only Ankhana isn't actually a fictitious world, it really exists in a parallel dimension.
So, whenever people watch one of Caine's movies, they're watching stuff that's happening for real.
That's the sort of badass Caine is.
even Pallas Rill, Caine's wife, who needs to be saved.One more thing, I have a major pet peeve: present tense.
Whenever I stumble upon a book that's written in present tense, I'll put it down and move on to something else.
Well, a considerable chunk of "Heroes Die" is written in present tense.
To be fair, there was a lot going on in my life that made reading take a back-burner, but even when I did pick this book up, it just...
And in general, I think that's the problem I had overall - I just kept waiting for this book, this story, to grab me...
A good one - well written and plotted and whatnot, I'll admit that, but from the rave reviews of some of my friends, I expected to pick this book up and be unable to put it back down until it was over.
I think my expectations were...
I loved this one! It combines a bit of SciFi with a fantasy world, as it is about human actors who get transferred to another plane were they fight or assassinate people. Those adventures get broadcasted at home for a lot of money.It was quite corey and bloody, and kept me well entertained all the time through.I clicked with the main character very fast, and loved to see his development over the course of the story. Once I started it, it was really hard to put it down - I will make sure to come back to this series!
The protagonist, CAINE, is one BADASS MOTHERFUCKER. He doesn't take MESS from ANYBODY, not STUDIO HEADS, not GOD-EMPERORS, not his BITCH-DEITY-WIIIIIIFE. Watch him take out OVERWHEMLING numbers of cannon fodder with GRUESOME violence. He fights with his RAZOR SHARP WITS, and HIS RAZOR SHARP KNIIIIIIIIIIIVES.You want distopian future SCIFI? Here ya go! You want more FANTASY than you can handle? FUCK YOU YOU GOT ITIt's like the MATRIX WITH ELLLLLLVESSPORT A VIOLENCE ERECTION TODAY, READ HEROES DIIIIIIIIIIIIE
Wow! What a wild ride! How do you save your girl when you've been told you have to kill a god first? This was a story that really did keep me guessing until the very end... and what a great end!
The world is interesting, complex and full of potential, as are the male characters.
But only a little bit...2) I know that there are male authors out there who can write convincing, realistic female characters.
It pisses me off.I want to know how the story ends, but I don't want to jump back into a world that pisses me off and makes me feel like I need to shower.
So, one star for not being able to finish the book, bumped up to two stars because there's so much potential if you can get past the unrealistic portrayal of women...and the shit.
Set on an overpopulated Earth shackled by a rigid caste society, and set in the land of Ankhana, a distant medieval world where ‘actors’ from Earth are sent to assassinate monarchs, start wars and cause chaos all for the entertainment of billions back home on Earth.Enter Caine, AKA Hari Michaelson, a superstar actor who’s wife has gone missing in Ankhana.
Caine is a fascinating character: full of rage and bitterness, he is absolutely relentless and unstoppable - a true anti-hero.This book is an absolute Tour De Force: full of violence, blood and gore.
With its slick prose (which reminds me a lot of Scott Lynch), engaging characters and twisting plot, Heroes Die is the book you’ve always needed to read, but never knew it...
Exciting and well-plotted.In a near-future Earth, government control has produced a strict caste society.
Hari Michaelson has struggled up from a Labor position, with the help of a rich patron, to become one of the most famous men on Earth - but he is still only an Actor, subservient to those above him.
Can Caine succeeed over the political and magickal intrigues of Ankhana, and the even more diabolical plots of his Studio back home, who keep trying to create a more entertaining story, and save the woman he loves?"
To quote Matt Stover: "Fuck me like a virgin goat."I'm pretty torn on this one. 4 stars, but that's probably the biggest round-up from a 3 that I'll ever grant on Goodreads. I found the first half of this book to be a little bizarre. As things started to click I got dragged into the story and the end made up for the confusion caused by the beginning.I still have a bunch of questions about the "setting" that I hope will be answered in the next volume of the series.
We follow protagonist Hari Michaelson, whose day job consists of teleporting to a parallel world (or something like that, I got a little hazy on the exact rules) that features elves, magic, a godlike emperor and that kind of stuff.
Once in this “overworld” he dons the role of mega-badass Caine whose violent adventures are watched and adored by millions back on earth.
I’m very interested in seeing where Stover goes with his characters and plot in the sequels and am glad I took the turn into the weird genre side alley this book inhabits.
Heroes DieMy husband loved this book so much that he made me read it.
I like badass heroes and Caine filled that role quite well.
My favorite part of the book were the lengthy, philosophical conversations between Caine and Ma'elKoth.
I loved how Berne was so obsessed with goats in this book.
For such a bad guy he sure did have hilarious one liners such as "Fuck me like a goat." Again this humor thrown into the violence really lightened the mood.This was one crazy world, I have to give it that.
I cannot wait to read more of Caine or should I say Hari.
