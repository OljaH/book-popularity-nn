I'll make this short and sweet. So, basically..  This was absurdly absurd. But you know what?
The Windy City isn't quite ready for Phoebe Somerville—the outrageous, curvaceous New York knockout who has just inherited the Chicago Stars football team. And Phoebe is definitely not ready for the Stars' head coach, former gridiron legend Dan Calebow, a sexist jock taskmaster with a one-track mind. Calebow is everything Phoebe abhors.

The Windy City isn't quite ready for Phoebe Somerville—the outrageous, curvaceous New York knockout who has just inherited the Chicago Stars football team.
And Phoebe is definitely not ready for the Stars' head coach, former gridiron legend Dan Calebow, a sexist jock taskmaster with a one-track mind.
And the sexy new boss is everything Dan despises—a meddling bimbo who doesn't know a pigskin from a pitcher's mound.
She'd been through a lot in her life and sort of came across as a brainless bimbo.
But she was far from brainless and not at all like a bimbo.
***4.5 NOW stars***You’re my only failure.
My only failure, Phoebe.Perfect book for getting in the spirit of the upcoming Super Bowl XLVIII (2/2/2014).Phoebe is a sexy underestimated daughter of a football owner (Chicago Stars).
When her father sudden dies she inherits his team.
Her father had always seen her as a failure and this opportunity to run the team was a test.
She must win the championship or she will lose any inheritance.Dan is the cocky coach of the Chicago Stars.
He has little faith in the new owner of the team.
I don't care that this book was first published 20 years ago. Actually I think that is why I thought it was FANFREAKINGTASTIC! Seriously, ladies you will absolutely love Dan Calebow. I sure did.  I hope to get back to do a complete review because this book deserves one. RL is just a bit hectic at the moment. This one is going on my favorites shelf and I will recommend it to everyone too! It was sexy, sweet and funny. And Pooh....
WOW! What an amazing read, and although I don't often read sports-romance books (especially football..hey I'm Canadian if anything, I'd read a romance with hockey..Eh?..LOL) this was really good!This happened  a lot  while reading this story I really, really, really liked Dan. I loved his complexity, strength, loyalty, gentleness, and his own desire for a HEA.He is not what I'm used to in a 'hero', but he was written beautifully! He just seemed SO real, with many layers.I was wonderful to read h

He just seemed SO real, with many layers.I was wonderful to read how frustrated, and angry Dan would get when trying to talk to, or even relate to Phoebe
.. and Phoebe, you were AMAZING!
LOVED THIS STORY!
5 STARS[image error] What can I say? Another 5 star book? Most definitely!!! I’m starting to think Susan Elizabeth Phillips cannot write a bad book… either that or she has most definitely found the key to my heart. These books exemplify the delicate balance of intense emotion, witty dialogue and comic relief. I have nothing but high praise and giddy admiration for this author and her fabulous books.

I’m starting to think Susan Elizabeth Phillips cannot write a bad book… either that or she has most definitely found the key to my heart.
Returning to Chicago for her father’s funeral, Phoebe, who had believed herself disinherited from her father’s will, is shocked to find that he has left her the sole owner of his Chicago Stars NFL football team.
Dan Calabow is a retired star quarterback, who is now the head coach of the Chicago Stars football team.
”I, Mr. Pigskin-For-Brains, am the owner of this football team; not you.

Well maybe not that good, lol, but definitely the closest I will ever find.I loved Phoebe!
She still was very funny at the beginning, lol, so many scenes made me laugh so hard I had to stop reading the book and analyze them over and over again.
You know, maybe it's just me that I have been reading paranormal for too long and heroes were always the same.
That's how good the book is.
IMHO this was a terrific contemporary romance and I loved every second of it.
Enjoy people, definitely a must read for romance lovers.

Instagram || Twitter || Facebook || Amazon || PinterestPhoebe Summerville is like a cross between Elle Woods and Peg Bundy - she's rich, she's tacky, everyone writes her off as a dumb bimbo. However, she's quite a bit more clever and complicated than anyone gives her credit for, including her father, who disliked her so much that he decided to screw with her from beyond the grave: instead of being disinherited as per his original plan, he's giving her his football team, the Chicago Stars, for a
And he doesn't really feel as sorry as he should have.Minus three.Towards the end of the book, Dan tells Phoebe that he doesn't feel comfortable dating someone with the power to fire him.Minus four.Also, the inclusion of this line:What good were curvy hips and full breasts if she couldn't let a man caress them, if they would never bring a baby into the world or nuture its new life?
She has a couple favorite words that are also repeated several times, like "peek-a-boo", "sassy", and "delirious."This line was kind of weird as well.Like plantation slaves, the National Football League's Chicago Stars had come to pay homage to the man who owned them (5).In addition to Dan, I also despised Molly, Phoebe's younger half-sister.
Not only does he have sex with his ex after meeting the heroine we are given a full gag worthy account.On top of that he keeps dating a “marriage material” respectable woman while fucking the “not so marriage material” heroine.Of course he doesn’t do it intentionally but that doesn’t make him any less disrespectful, or less cheating.You either respect someone or you don’t.My vote is he doesn’t.Sorry mou.
Como no darle 5 estrellas a este libro??? Sencillamente ENAMORADA es lo que te deja este libro, que manera tiene SEP de escribir y crear historias, sobre todo en crear esos personajes masculinos inolvidables.. Me encanta SEP sin duda es una de mis escritoras favoritas porque no me canso de leerla y siempre me sorprende. Dan.. Dan.. Creo que será difícil olvidarte!!! Definitivamente es de esos libros que valen la pena releerlos y nunca nunca te cansarías.. Que joya! A por más de ti SEP!! Gracias gracias por esta delicia..
It was so fun to be in this book.I’ve read the paperback three times and recently listened to the audiobook.
And it provides good dialogue and conflict.There are no details about the rape.
It consists of Phoebe telling her father afterwards that she has been raped.
I think this might be mild enough not to bother them.Dan was a football star and is now head coach of a pro football team.
It’s nice knowing their backgrounds.WYNETTE, TEXAS:5 stars.

What I Did For Love 2009 (Meg visits, from Wynette, Texas series)3 ½ stars.
I owe a huge debt of gratitude to my friends Karen, Mo and Sharon for clogging my feed with updates of binge reading books by Susan Elizabeth Phillips.
But the refreshing writing style sets this book apart from its more modern counterparts and makes it reminiscent of the types of romance novels that made me fall in love with the genre.
Susan Elizabeth Phillips has created a wonderful cast of characters, including the lovable members of the Chicago Stars football team.
My favorite character, however, is Phoebe.
It was a joy seeing the way Susan Elizabeth Phillips constructed her evolution.I’m looking forward to reading the other books in the series.
3.5Mentiría si dijera que no me ha gustado, pero no será un libro que releeré.
Tiene toques que no me gustan, quizás con un toque machista.
Nada exagerado, pero ese rol hombre-macho / mujer diva/madre...
me ha fastidiado un pelín.Más que todo por el motivo que él cambia de opinión (que no voy a desvelar)Muy entretenido, no sé si seguiré con la serie, por ahora no me ha entusiasmado lo suficiente, la verdad.Y, nada negativo puedo decir, bien escrito, con buen ritmo y engancha, interesante el mundo del futbol americano que desconozco totalmente.Personajes bien construidos...
soy yo que la contemporánea no me entusiasma
What started out as a book I thought I wasn't going to be too fond of, turned into a story I loved!I read this entire series out of order.
I started with Nobody's Baby But Mine, which was good, then Dream a Little Dream, which was excellent and my favorite in the series.
Anyhoo, in those books you always hear about Phoebe and Dan Calebow, the owners of the Stars, so I had to read their story for myself.
SEP worked her magic on me and I ended up loving Dan and Phoebe's story and seeing them both live their dream.
“It Had To Be You” is full of hot, sizzling romance, pure football fun and drama that will set any romance fans’ heads spinning!When Bert Somerville, the owner of the prized football team, the Chicago Stars, dies he left in his will that his estranged daughter, Phoebe Somerville, will inherit the football team after his death.
Susan Elizabeth Phillips has not only written a romance novel full of hot and sizzling love scenes, but she wrote a romance novel that is full of drama and love!
Susan Elizabeth Phillips made the characters come to life in this novel, especially Phoebe Somerville and Dan Calebow!
Necesito tranquilizar a mis hormonas para poder hacer lo más parecido a una reseña con sentido. Lo malo, ahora voy a coger el libro de Bobby.¡Te amo Dan!, ¡¿quieres ser mi quaterback personal?! O lo que quieras hacer de mi, sobre mi, encima de mi, a mi lado. No soy una mujer con perjuicios. Pufff mejor paro y ya pondré algo más comedido (o no).#retorita23/04/2017Habiendo tranquilizado mis hormonas, disfrutando mientras tanto con otra amena lectura (Bobby Tom), creo que ya soy capaz de escribir a
Y que supone eso, pues que dan por hecho que es tonta del culo, una barbie, y además una devoradora de hombres (ella contribuye a este rumor, pero tiene sus motivos).
¿olvidamos que este mundo es enteramente masculino?, pues eso, ha luchar con todos los machistas (habrá frases que te harán chirriar los dientes, pero en mi opinión, SEP lo ha puesto así, para ridiculizar esa opinión retrograda).Y por otro lado tenemos a Dan Calebow (aihhhhhh!!!
This was a re-re-re-re-read!! LOL. I must read it nearly every fecking year. I LOVE IT. I love Dan. I love Phoebe. I LOVE SEP!!Thought I was updating on the kindle version but I seem to have been updating on the paperback one. Sorry about that. There will be two ratings on here then. Both 5 stars and I am sure the next time I read it, it will still be FIVE stars.
Phoebe, representa para él todo lo que no quiere y en lo que no quiere caer.Entre los dos saltan chispas, discusión tras discusión, en vez de alejarse se acercan y cuando se acercan....los fuegos artificiales del 4 de Julio se quedan cortos.Es una historia maravillosa, toda ella.
Lo he terminé anoche, con una sonrisa en los labios,queriendo más a este libro de lo que lo quise la primera vez (y la primera ya lo quise mucho), con ganas de volver a leerme tooodos los libros de esta serie de nuevo y adorando a la SEP por escribirlo.P.S. AMO A BOBBY TOM
"I disgraced MYSELF? Unless my memory’s faulty, you were the one who got evicted.""I got ejected, not evicted. That was a football game, not a damn landlords’ convention."   Haha :) I LOVE football, but I rarely read books about it for some reason. And it’s a weird thing to bother me, but I really don’t like it when there’s fake team names. Chicago Stars? Ugh, so fake. It puts me in the mindset of, Ugh, this makes everything feel so fake. I dunno. I’m weird.Anyway, this book and I had a very
And it’s a weird thing to bother me, but I really don’t like it when there’s fake team names.
And while the story was a little ridiculous, it ended up being fun, not stupid :) (view spoiler)[The only truly stupid thing was Dan forgoing a chip shot field goal on 4th down with 8 seconds left.
Oh, and that stuff with Hardesty - that was super stupid, too :P  (hide spoiler)] Dan was a fricken caveman, but he could be kind of charming too.
Dan es el más macho alfa con el que me he topado, tiene muy mal genio y un pronto muy rápido, una aptitud y unos principios un pelín machista que no me gustaron un pelo pero al final no puede negar sus sentimientos.
Son personajes con sus cargas y traumas pero que se encuentran y echan chispas.Es una historia muy divertida, ingeniosa, con momentos realmente divertidos y unos personajes que son puro amor.
Me ha dado la sensación de estar viendo una comedia clásica de de Cary Grant y Katherine Hepburn.
Una maravilla¡¡¡

I'll try to keep myself short (..if that is possible?)***********************************************Phoebe Somerville, the outrageous, beautiful, blonde, Marilyn Monroe-like knockout, inherits a professional football team from her recently deceased father.
And Coach Dan, this temperamental man (a 37 years old former football player), is he able to manage his temper and lead the team to necessary new victories?
I tend to enjoy the older books, but understand some want nothing to do with anything written last century.
The way it was written made it seem that the hero was honestly interested in getting it on with a 16-year-old, rather than him playing along with one of his ex-wife's sexual power play scenarios.
I realize SEP was trying to provide context about the sexual relationship between the hero and his ex, as it did color things that happened between the H/h, but it could have been done in a different and less squicky way.The heroine was definitely over-the-top.
3° relectura.Absolutamente genial. Es otro de esos escasos libros a los que le daría 10, 20, 30 estrellas 😂 Tiene de todo, es perfecto.Me encantan Dan y Phoebe 🔥😍
It was brilliant.
I'm speechless and will not even try to write a review.
It was terrible, and definitely not a feel good-cookie but so great.
I cried and I laughed and the ending was so sweet, so right.
This book was not what I expected but so much better.
My heart broke for Phoebe in the beginning of the book and to follow her growth and healing process was amazing.
It was so believable, so touching.
Updated 14/4/13It was just as great the second time around.
IMHO it's Suzan Elizabeth Phillips very best book.
I think the best reason why this book is awesome is that, other than the usual SEP factor, this book gives a giant fuck you to the "dumb blonde" mentality. I hate that phrase and I hate it when people uses that to their books but SEP created a character who is blonde, who is smart and who is kind.
I enjoy a good love/hate romance, here however the heroine was emotionally hurt one time too many so I found it hard to believe that she could love Dan who should have been told to go and **bleep bleep** himself from the get-go :) The novel also has a very dated 90s feel to it –lots of references to AIDS, homophobia and having gay friends which just sounded too preachy to me.
It’s just not my kind of read –-and a good thing to what with the number of books in this series (lol!)
1a lectura en 2016: Me encantan los libros de romántica donde el humor está presente y Susan Elizabeth Phillips es una auténtica maestra.
Los protagonistas de este libro son geniales por separado pero juntos...
Wow. Voy por el séptimo libro de la serie Chicago Stars y Dan sigue siendo mi favorito.
Me reafirmo en lo dicho, me encanta este libro, pues trata temas muy profundos de una forma muy amena y sin perder el sentido del humor.
Phoebe es una protagonista maravillosa y qué decir de Dan, le aaaaaaaaaamo.
Está y estará por siempre jamás de los primeritos en mi Top10 de book boyfriends favoritos.
(view spoiler)[ Dan had sex with his ex-wife after meeting Phoebe.
Later, Dan meets another woman named Sharon, a school teacher who was obviously good with kids.
And Dan wanted kids and family so much that he assumed he can marry Sharon.
During that time Dan and Phoebe came closer and they had sex.
Dan was so absorbed with his perfect family thought that he didn't even realize he fall in love with Phoebe.
After realizing he loved phoebe Dan ended the things with Sharon immediately.
One of the things I liked about Dan was he apologized every time he said something wrong against Phoebe.
