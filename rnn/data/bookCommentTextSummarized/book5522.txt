There were some parts where I wanted to scream at the book, "No! You're wrong! His name is ALEC not McGregor! AAAAAALLLLLLLLEEEEEEECCCCCC!!!!!!" It was so frustrating, watching a good kid like Alec believe he was a criminal and a murderer. This one was so good! It made me hate amnesia SO MUCH!!!!!
Adventure stories aren't based on reality, they are designed to pick you up onto their shoulders and race off with you into uncharted territory, make you feel the wind in your hair and the excitement in your heart, all without making you leave your chair.
It doesn't matter that everything works out perfectly in the end, that's the beauty of the era the books came from.
And in all honesty, does anyone ever feel this good about picking the one that came in second place?
Alec and The Black return to the wild in The Black Stallion Revolts, in an adventure that rivals the action and excitement captured in the first two books of the series.
When Henry decides that Alec and The Black need a vacation, he sends them west.
When the duo disappears, only they can find their way back to each other and to the people they left behind.The Black Stallion Revolts starts off slow, there's quite a bit of recapping that takes place in the first 30 pages.
But once the story really gets started, it's a nail-biter to the end.
Found it at the opshop and had to read it again..... What a memory ..... I loved these books....
I love this book.
This book hits so many of my H/C buttons (Alec losing his memory, being left for dead, fleeing, taken in by strangers, finding friends, finding a friend again - *big happy sigh*).
I love that in this book the injures Alec receives are treated as such.
No magical healing or jumping around again a day later.
It takes time to heal and there are some long lingering after effects.
The book isn't perfect but reading it makes me very happy and it's as if I'm reading it for the first time again.
One of the weaker entries in the canon. In this ninth book in the series, Farley hits cliche after cliche, starting with plane crash, moving through amnesia, heartless truckers, good-hearted rich guys who gave it all up, clueless cattle ranchers. Not that I didn't read every word- breathless plotting was one of Farley's gifts, and the ability to make one care despite the ludicrous situation. And nobody, but nobody, can write a race scene like him.
When a fight between the Black and Satan nearly ends up with Henry being seriously injured, Alec decides to fly out to a friend's ranch and give his horse some room to run free.
Alec wakes up a complete stranger to himself, money in his pocket and no memory of how it came to be there, and no memory of the Black.
Hitchhiking doesn't end well for him, but eventually a good Samaritan on a donkey finds him and patches him up.
He even finds a job for the frustrated amnesiac.
A horse that seems to know the confused boy, even if the boy doesn't know him.
"You canâ€™t blame people for loving any kind of race, no matter how long or how short, and for loving their horses regardless of their type or breed."A really interesting Black Stallion adventure in that it doesn't have anything to do with the racing world. I like this one, because it proves again the love the Black has for Alec.
loved every book in this series....my best friend Laura and I couldn't read them fast enough
Some people might wonder what kind of things that were effective this book.This is called the black stallion revolts lost in the wilderness and it's by Walter Farley.
The first thing that was really effective was that how the writer wrote the book people say that he was really effective with the writing at the Bennington it's slow but it's gets faster within the book.
I really did not like this when I first read it when I was about 9 years old. It does have a lot of continuity problems with The Black Stallion's Filly, The Black Stallion's Sulky Colt and The Black Stallion's Courage. Also, I think this is the book where the Black is mistakenly described as having a pink muzzle. As I got older, I appreciated this quirky adventure story more and more. It's one of the most distinctive books of the series. My favorite part: the Black being given the name Range Boss by an ignorant cowboy.
This was another 'okay' installment, but less okay than the other ones because it was kind of a shaggy dog story. There was no point, which is always frustrating...you could literally skip this one and not notice for the rest of the series, I think it gets mentioned in one line in the next book.But if you want to read the whole series, then this one isn't all the bad where you won't be able to get through it.
I've read the entire Black Stallion series multiple times but this one is my favorite. The Black has been out to stud for a while but because a series of events, Alec winds up racing the Black again. And, of course, he's victorious. It's a very satisfying read for anyone who has read Farley's books.
This was another favourite of mine in The Black Stallion series. Although it took us away from the racing world for the first half, it was still well done, especially in relation to Alec's confusion about everything. Admittedly, I don't know much about amnesia, but his response to it seemed realistic. I enjoyed the way the novel worked and how it progressed.
This was actually the first book I read from the Black Stallion series. I read the 1950s, green, hard-cover edition because it was sitting on our bookshelf at home and it had a horse on the cover. lol In this one Alec gets amnesia, so it stands out from a lot of the plots in the series. After reading it, I was hooked and read the entire series.
I wasn't as impressed with this one, but it did bring back the Black's past as a desert stallion, even though he had been a successful race horse & sire in previous books we've read. I kind of thought the plot twist with Alec getting amnesia & having to remember was a little predictable, but then I also remember that these are kids' books! it's still a really good story.
It has been a long time since I read this book but I remember really enjoying it. The main Character loses him memory and the Black gets lost. Interesting how they still meet up and end up riding and racing. Lots of fun. :)
The Black Stallion's Filly and The Black Stallion Revolts by Walter Farley - Two of the ones I actually liked again, after a streak of books in the series that I found I didn't care much for as an adult.
I raced through this series as a child. Of course, "The Black Stallion" was my favorite, and I read it a few times, but I waited eagerly for any of the books to return to my branch of the library so I could snap them up.
My dad was reading this to me when a tornado destroyed our house in 1985. I always remembered the beginning and wanted to know the ending. It only took me a quarter of a century to find out. Not too shabby of a read by Mr. Farley. I love kids books that were written pre-1970.
I enjoyed the characters, and their world and hope I get the chance to read the story again and/or to read more within the series.My Rating System:* couldn't finish, ** wouldn't recommend, *** would recommend, **** would read again, ***** have read again.
The Black Stallion Revolts, Black Stallion Series, Book 5, Walter Farley, PB-B @ 1977, 3/78. The once-wild horse needs more space and freedom, so they head out west to a huge ranch. But an accident leaves Alec with amnesia and the Black alone to reclaim his wild life. Okay.
I gobbled up all of these books when I was in my horse phase.
i like it alot
It is so good. I loved it.
The first book was the story of a boy and a horse, but the series grows with books on similar themes of overcoming adversity and animal/human bonding. Loved them as a kid.
I loved this book as a young teen. Actually, I loved every one of Walter Farley's books.
JAR5-Far
Great plot and ending
A big battle for life!!!
