Great book.No one delves into psycological side of his characters like Max Brand. His are not jusr stories, they let us feel the misery of the of the desperate lonely people of the west. He does not glorify his characters, but lets see the struggles.
A little odd, but I liked it.
I enjoy listening to Max Brand books on the way home from work as a way to unwind and escape in my mind for a bit.
Sometimes movies these days are just exhausting trying to keep up with and you feel like the authors or directors are just stringing you along from one cliffhanger and crisis and unexpected twist to the next instead of just telling a good story.
So I like the pace of the Max Brand storytelling usually.
But overall I have enjoyed many hours of good storytelling over the years via LibriVox.
Pierre, brought up by a kindly priest since infancy, is about to enter the priesthood when he suddenly finds out that he does have a biological father who is an outlaw.
The father gave him up to the priest to raise when his mistress died (because he knew his wife would murder the baby if he brought him home to her).
The father is dying from a gunshot would by another outlaw, and writes for Pierre to try to come see him before he dies.
Narrative is well written in precise English while characters speak colloquially. Outstadning and fast-paced narrative. This book was originally published in 1920 and although it has been out of print for a long time it ought to be republished for post modern readers. While I am new to reading westerns I am hooked on Max Brand's style.
This was a very good story. Interesting characters and it moved well. Even a little romance there.
