I loved him.You have no idea how hard it is to find a picture of a man on the internet that would fit the mental image of the hero I have in my head.
Pardon my French.QUICK REVIEW:Enjoyment: 4.5/5Writing style: 5/5Storyline: 4/5 Hero: 4/5Heroine: 4/5Secondary characters: 5/5 Hotness/steam: 4/5 Romance: 4/5 Angst: 3.5/5Darkness level: 2/5Humor: 2/5Depth of the book: 5/5POV: multiple, third personTriggers: (view spoiler)[sex scenes with ow, cheating between secondary characters, mild violence, women abuse, animal abuse, death  (hide spoiler)]The only thing that pissed me off was when (view spoiler)[ the heroine shot the pit bulls.
It was back in the day when men were Real Men, wore jeans and boots, had hairy chests and stubbled jaws, they smoked, they fucked, they drank, they didn’t care what folks thought of them… but now and again one of them could be brought to their knees by a beautiful woman.
This was not even available on Kindle in my neck of the woods but I wanted to read it so bad that I got the paperback, an OLD paperback edition.
Fantastic!! It was crude, full of deceit, and overly dramatic, I loved it!! I think it's officially my second favorite Sandra Brown book, ever!!! Lol. And that cover??!!!
SHEER PERFECTION!I can't stress how much I LOVED THIS!
Don't ask me why this book made me think of that book, maybe it was the atmosphere, the return of a character meant to finish something, the beauty of the surroundings...not sure, but in my mind I saw similarities.
If it wasn't for the intense empathy I felt for him, I wouldn't have come to love him as much as I did.
His feelings were always hidden behind animosity and cruelty, but I felt him, and believed him to be the man meant for Schyler.
This one will be short and sweet. Another freaking great book by Sandra Brown. I just love her books!! But I think you all already know that right. :)I have to say in this one the suspense and romance rolls were reversed. Well in my opinion anyways. There was a bit of mystery and suspense but it wasn't that on the edge of your seat stuff. It was good, don't get me wrong, but the romance and sex (Cash style) was FABULOUS! Cash Boudreaux.... I loved Mr. Cash Boudreaux. He was a dirty talking son o

Cash Boudreaux....
I loved Mr. Cash Boudreaux.
He was a dirty talking son of a bitch but you will end up loving every single inch of him.
This is another highly recommend read from me if your a Sandra Brown fan!!
I've read this way back, and I mean way back and it's safe to say, Cash Bordreaux popped my bad boy cherry.
This was written way back when the word 'Fuck" wasn't used in romance and heroes are supposed to be good and kind.
He says fuck a lot and man-whored his way into my heart.
Romance readers nowadays wouldn't bat an eyelash at Cash's behavior nowadays but back then, many readers were scandalized.
I just loved it.The story wasn't all that but I find the characters fascinating, all of them and it's nice to read books that really breaks the mold.
Slow Heat in Heaven is bit dark contemporary southern family-story with heat.
Oh yeah, this hero and heroine steamed with emotions, strong feelings and did an classic enemy to lovers journey in those dark and dangerous Southern Louisiana woods.
I knew what I wanted most when I saw you asleep under that tree.”Well, well here I got another...Sandra Brown is, in my experience this past six months, a good guarantee for well-made (steamy enough) romantic thriller novels.
~ ...That's what I usually get in those SB novels and so also in Slow Heat in Heaven.
I'm once again pleased and look forward to my next SB reading (or listening) experience.*********************************************************I LIKE - even slightly outdated stories by Ms Brown
Me ha encantado, nunca había leído nada de esta autora y tenía este libro para leer desde hace siglos, había leído muy buenas críticas y sabía que me iba a gustar muchísimo y no me equivocado.
El personaje de Sky al principio estaba dudosa si me iba a terminar de gustar, por que había algo que no me terminaba de encajar con ella pero he descubierto un gran personaje y con Cash más o menos igual.
Se le ve a leguas que es uno de esos personajes que son "duros" de principio a fín y eso es lo que más me gusta de él que no ha cambiado su forma de ser y se ha mantenido así hasta el final.
4.5 ☆Me ha encantado.Soy consciente de que el personaje de Cash tiene ciertas peculiaridades que a lo mejor podrían chocar un poco, pero es que tiene una personalidad tan arrolladora que sinceramente, a mi no me han importado para nada.
Es una novela "de las de antes" en la que los líos y secretos familiares se entremezclan en la relación amorosa de los protagonistas.
No le doy las cinco quizás porque el final me ha parecido algo brusco y me hubiera gustado que la autora hubiese alargado algo más esa escena final tan bonita.
I like some of SB's books -- especially Lethal -- but with a book this long, I needed more light moments and upbeat characters to balance the dark.
After reading 450+ pages of mistrust and misery, I get one or two optimistic, loving pages at the end?Beware, vague spoilers follow, but the big plot surprises are secret.
No loving tenderness between Cash and Schyler (Skyler) until nearly the last page.
I sometimes liked Schyler, but she bugged me, killing those poor creatures, letting Ken kiss her a few times and feel her up, and never trusting Cash.
The hero, Cash, was a sexy Cajun but he also was a man-whore who came off pretty harsh during parts and it was hard to see him liking the heroine for more than sex and her home.
She came off as judgmental and quick to think the worst of Cash no matter what, even though he was a hard worker and figured out who was stealing from them, she treated him like crap for no reason.
I liked the hero's Cajun accent on audio.Overall, an interesting drama-filled southern story but the romance wasn't believable and most of the characters were not likable.
Al principio me costaba mucho empatizar con los dos protagonistas, por su terquedad y a veces sus malos modos.
Schyler y Cash me han gustado un poco más casi en la parte final que al principio, su evolución es evidente pero me ha costado ver en ellos algo más que atracción sexual.
El final es rápido, pero a mi entender es acorde con el personaje de Cash y su manera de actuar durante todo el libro.Al final lo he disfrutado que es lo que de verdad importa.Seguiré leyendo a la autora.
They're engrossing, with a cast of interesting and diverse characters, several story lines that in some way or another manage to intertwine and always a good mystery to solve.
Every scene with him was priceless!I also couldn't help myself from smiling each and every time I heard one of those innocuously simple phrases revolving around Heaven, like "I can't wait to get out of Heaven" or "Take me to Heaven." The double entendres were divine and just added to the depth and temptation of this tale.I highly recommend this book for all SB fans, or readers who love a rich, compelling tale with a real good mystery and sensuality!
#RitaBrown Odio en el paraíso es uno de esos viejunismos contemporáneos lleno de pistos que cada vez se hacen más grandes. Cash es un protagonista muy peculiar un macho de pelo en pecho y con las ideas bien claras, pero esa boquita le pierde y por eso es posible que mucha gente no lo pueda ver delante. El estilo de la autora me gusta, sin duda este será el primero de muchos ^^
A pesar de que el protagonista de esta novela Cash Boudreaux, es un bruto y grosero, no puedo evitar decir que me ha gustado mucho, la historia está muy bien escrita, tiene mucha intriga, odio, suspenso, te mantiene en vilo sin saber que pasará, el único pero que le pongo es el final, me hubiera gustado que sea un poquito más largo, #RetoRita2
So, in the interest of providing potential readers with more Cash-related information (the kinds of things I would've liked to know before reading the book), the following will have spoilers aplenty, so proceed with caution.
It is important to note a couple of things here: first, it is clear that the affair is a matter of both Cash and the woman using each other for sex, and absolutely nothing more.
The scenes with Cash and Schyler have a lot of heat and are very steamy, and the reader knows that each has feelings for the other.

A whole lifetime ago...Happy Reading!============================================Okay, you know some books stay with you forever.
Sandra Brown surprised the hell out of me when I first read this way back when first published.
So, Sandra, if you read this, would love to know why some of your books you've published as eBooks and others not.
Historia extremadamente interesante en partes, pero aburrida en otras áreas.
El romance entre Cash y Schyler fue muy pobre en general, la química estaba allí, pero carecía de interacciones sustanciales entre los ellos.
después de tanto mal trato y falta de romance la historia termina con un único te quiero, uno solo!!Como dije la historia es muy interesante, super entretenida, y bien escrita con un estilo narrativo que cautiva y atrapa, me quedo a deber amorcito corazon.P.D: pero que portada mas fea XDDD, en que pensaban hace 30 años?
Another Brown favorite of mine with two reviews - one at AudioGals and another at Speaking of AudiobooksNarrated by Dick HillAfter a few spectacular fails with Brown’s earlier releases, I picked up Slow Heat in Heaven with more than a little trepidation.
http://www.audiogals.net/2013/01/slow...Unabridged audiobook review written for Speaking of Audiobooks 6/17/10:Narrated by Dick HillI really enjoyed this one but that statement carries this disclaimer – it’s best to read Slow Heat in Heaven (originally published in 1988) as general fiction rather than romance.
Full of sultry heat and family secrets, it’s still a book you can sink into and forget life for a little awhile with.
Cotton Crandall is on his death bed, as is his life’s work, and Schyler is determined to not let either happen.Soon after arrival she decides to restart the once successful logging family empire her gambler brother-in-law ran into the ground, but a series of devastating accidents is about to shut it all down once again.
Still, he’s the only one she can trust to set things right- even though trust is probably the last thing she should place in him- because he’s got the biggest secret of them all.It’s steamy.
Not everyone's idea of a hero, but man did this book make my pulse pound.
Entretenida, amor y lujo del bueno. Da lo que promete y lo cuenta bien.
MARAVILLOSO, me ha encantado!!!!
#RitaBrown #RetoRita2Estaba entre el 3.5 y el 4.5, al final me quedo en el medio, un 4/5.La cuestión es que me ha gustado bastante, un culebrón en toda regla de los antiguos, la trama parece sacada de "Dinastía", jaja...
Pero con Cash he tenido un amor-odio desde el principio que todavía no he solucionado, y más por el final, para mi un poco brusco, me habría gustado que hubiera sido más desarrollado, me quedo un poco "falta de".
Instead of being ecstatic at the knowledge, which I would have been, Schyler fires Cash saying he was not authorized to do that - he did not have her permission to go through the books.There are several mean and nasty characters with schemes, secrets, and spies.
WRONG NARRATOR FOR THIS BOOK:Dick Hill is a good narrator for crime fiction and other genres, but please keep him away from romance and sex.
No character had any sex appeal.
He used too much sarcasm for the dialogue between Cash and Schyler.
Also at times Schyler sounded like a whiny little girl.
Con protas como Cash, cualquier otro se queda corto. Leí esta novela hace añares y todavía funciona para mí. Siempre regreso a ella, a releer algunas escenas. La química entre los protagonistas es alucinante.
Schyler Crandall left home six years ago when she found out her sister was pregnant with her fiance's baby.
But when her father has a massive heart attack, she returns home to Belle Terre to find her family's business, Crandall Logging, on the edge of bankruptcy with a huge loan payment coming due.
In order to save the business, Schyler must put her trust into Cash Boudreaux, a man who grew up on Belle Terre property but was never part of the family.I think I waited about 20 years too long to read this book.
I didn't like that he was seeing other women when he was with Schyler.
It took me a while to nail this book down. The heroine is the worse MC in all Brown’s books I have read. A judgemental, TSTL. ignorant bitch. Most of the characters in there filled me with revulsion. Seriously.
kutulis reviewnya kelak saat aku baca utk ke 12x nya. buku antihero murni terbaik pertamaku, dan ingat ini ditulis 25 tahun lalu sebelum anti hero jadi mainstream di mayoritas novel masa kini.
Loved this one from the fab Sandra Brown when I first read it back in the 80s and am so excited to be able to download SHiH now, along with other SB favs to my Kindle and cherish them forever.
