I swear, people can’t wrap their minds around the concept of a fat girl who doesn’t diet. Is it that hard to believe I might actually like my body? I LOVE LEAH BURKE.I don't actually see how it's possible not to. She's hilarious and badass and sarcastic and moody and totally potty-mouthed. Oh, how I wish I could go back in time and give my awkward, chubby teen self this book. If you've had enough of the depressing gloomy world we live in and want to read something uplifting, unapologetically ne
the Homo Sapiens Agenda, with better dialogue, characters and relationships than The Upside of Unrequited, and it didn't hurt that I just related to Leah so much more.This book has everything you need from the perfect high school senior rom-com: a tight group of hilarious and charming friends, prom and all that goes with it, a will they/won't they (view spoiler)[of course they will, silly!
Like I said, I so wish this book existed when I was in high school.The romance here was just perfect for me.
Becky Albertalli's books are largely driven by the dialogue, which makes for some great banter.
You will encounter me in the afterlife only to learn that I’ve spent the last 3 millennia reciting increasingly complex and overtly emotional poetry about how much I fucking love this book.We really did speak twentyGAYteen into existence and WE ARE THRIVING!!
4.75*P.S. exciting new video experiment ft. this book coming soon (stay tuned)
Instead, we got a rushed romance that felt forced.
(view spoiler)[Plus, Leah dismissing Abby's coming out because she's not "bi enough"?
(hide spoiler)]Was it just me or was almost every character's personality off?
This is most apparent with Abby and Nick, but even Simon felt like a strange fanfic version of himself.
Leah is a pretty unlikable character, which I love to read about - if there's an arc.To sum up my feelings: AGH I wanted to love this book because we need more f/f romances, but I had many issues with it.
FINALLY A GIRL LIKES GIRL BOOK!!There are so many YA contemporary romance going around where it's boy likes boy (and that's awesome!) but I'm so happy we get to see a different version. This book was adorable!The characters were attaching, funny and just angsty enough. If you're looking for a fun summer read, I totally recommend both Creekwood books. It was really nice to go back to this world and continue to explore it. I'm actually sad it's now over!Recommend it!
inspired by my similar review of Simon Vs, here we go: a list of  every iconic moment of this book 🌸 "I'VE BEEN KNOWN TO DO THAT WHEN IT COMES TO ABBY" IN LIKE THE SECOND FUCKING CHAPTER🌺 Simon and Leah inventing bro culture🌸 the fact that Nick and Simon’s college tour list is literally mine subtracting three women’s colleges? the accuracy jesus christ🌺 Taylor disparaging the tech crew and Nora looking as if she wants to silently implode is my mood🌸 “Joseph is the bomb.”“Don’t say the bomb.”“Jos
the accuracy jesus christ🌺 Taylor disparaging the tech crew and Nora looking as if she wants to silently implode is my mood🌸 “Joseph is the bomb.”“Don’t say the bomb.”“Joseph is the blizz.”🌺 Everything Leah’s mom says in this entire book, tbh🌸 the establishment of Leah’s anxiety and how it causes her to overreact to situations and hyperinflate them in her mind and how fuckening relatable that is🌺 Apparently, Simon’s dad asked the tour guide at Duke to “please elaborate on the campus gay scene.”“I wanted to fucking die,” Simon told me.🌸 Leah wearing gold combat boots, like an icon🌺 all the Martin Addison hate🌸 “All my ships kissing - Inej and Nina, Percabeth, a few original characters...” honestly why are we surprised by this it's so in character, Leah has a Ninej shipper personality🌺 “Mr. Spier, memorizing the Hamilton soundtrack is not going to help you on the AP Euro exam.”🌸 Garrett being useless and flirty and Trying🌺 Abby being Maybe Kind Of Cute but Very Straight and Leah being A Bisexual🌸 But the show was amazing, even with Martin Addison back in commission.
It felt like they had chemistry, lost it, and somehow got it again but only because they had had chemistry before.If that didn’t make sense, that’s exactly how it felt to read this book.And then of course, there is a horribly hurtful scene that happened, and I don’t even know how it made it into the final draft with the sensitivity readers Albertalli hired.
It is wrong and hurtful to police the way someone identifies, ESPECIALLY when that someone is questioning their sexuality.Now this might’ve been okay if it had been acknowledged as an issue later on, if Leah had apologized to the love interest about what she said.
3/5 Stars ⭐ ⭐ ⭐“I can't help it. I'm a Slytherin."And I'm the worst kind of Slytherin. I'm the kind who's so stupidly in love with a Gryffindor, she can't even function. I'm the Draco from some shitty Drarry fic that the author abandoned after four chapters.” I finished this book in ten hours with some breaks in between. And I'm not saying that because it was so irresistible and I couldn't leave it down and I wanted to see how the plot was going to unfold, no. Because this book was extremely und
Because this book was extremely underwhelming, couldn't even compare to its predecessor and it felt like the most flat thing I have read in a long period of time.
It’s hard for Leah to strike the right note while the people she loves are fighting—especially when she realizes she might love one of them more than she ever intended.I wanted to love this book so fucking much.
It's like she didn't know what to write as an ending, how to write the confrontation of what would happen after all the other characters would find out about Abby and Leah and she just...
This book may focus on Leah’s character, but it doesn’t change the fact that it reads like a kind of sequel to Simon vs.
She simply wants to figure some things out before.So although it’s a feel-good story in many ways, with plenty of teasing between friends, pop culture references and romantic moments, it nevertheless discusses more serious topics, like racism, relationships, insecurities, goodbyes and, of course, bisexuality.
This book went in a direction that many of Becky Albertalli's fans have been clamoring for and will no doubt enjoy.
Not even Simon can save it.It's difficult to give this book a proper review, because the major story line is being treated like a spoiler.
It's involves a romance between Leah and another character, but I can't be more specific than that without giving away the farm.What I can tell you, is that as a reader who loved Albertalli's debut novel, Simon vs.
the Homo Sapiens Agenda, I really hated how the author had to rewrite so many aspects of that book to make this new story work.
Edit: This book kept invading my mind and the more I thought about it, the more I felt this hatred towards it.
Pre-emotions:Please be as adorable as The Upside of Unrequited and Simon Vs.Post-read-book-emotions:Update: it wasn’t.
This book was so meh.
I’m confused right now.The story felt all over the place.
Half the time, Leah spend it by being a little shit, next thing you know she’s in love with her?!
Just Leah complaining about a lot of shit and her school life.
I would’ve loved to have seen her relationship with her mother and her boyfriend progress into something.
This book wasn’t for me.
I'm the kind who's so stupidly in love with a Gryffindor, she can't even function.Leah.
And of course, with this book, we're invited to revisit all these amazing characters from the previous Creekwood book.
It almost makes you forget that Leah is the main character of this story.
It feels as if Becky is a bit too much in love with her characters.
Trying to get so many characters' background stories between roughly 300 pages is impossible and it flattened they characterisation, in my eyes.Let's talk about Leah.
And overall, Leah is a confident character, who is outspoken and loves her friends.
*insert ‘its not you, its me’ speech here* :'(i think its time for me to break up with miss becky albertalli and this book is what helped me make that decision.
the dedication to this basically admits its her writing fanfiction of her own book, and it definitely shows.
honestly, i found myself just skimming for only the parts involving simon.
and even then, most characters didnt even feel like the same people i met in simon vs.
i know this book is the ultimate dream come true for so many fans and i am beyond happy it was everything they hoped for and more, but the execution of this story just wasnt for me.
But this book sort of totally flipped the characters I so loved, and tarnished the friendships so bad, I don’t know, it was infuriating.I don’t want to summarize the plot, because if you are going to read this book, you need to read Simon Vs.
After I realized that I wasn’t going to like Leah, it was the only reason I kept reading this book.
At least Simon must have said something, pried at her?🚫	It’s not like I didn’t know Leah was bisexual before reading this book.
HOLY SHIT HOLY SHIT HOLY SHIT HOLY SHIT HOLY SHIT HOLY SHIT HOLY SHIT HOLY SHIT HOLY SHIT HOLY SHIT 
To me, it felt like Leah was a way different character than the one in Simon's book.In this one she was moody, angry all the time at PETTY REASONS AND being bitchy to her mother, who loved her unconditionally and was ready to do anything for her.
And as i recall Leah was really mean at some points and no one called her out for it, except her mom thank god.This is just my opinion, and ik many others have different point of views and love Leah and can relate to her.I really wish i liked Leah too since i was head over heels in love with her in Simon...
I'm between 4 and 4.5 stars.When I fall in love with a book's characters, I'm often sad when the book ends, because I want to spend more time with them, and I feel like I've become engrossed in their lives in some small way. So when a sequel comes along, I'm tremendously excited, and of course, I hope it is worthy of the original book.I absolutely loved Becky Albertalli's  Simon vs. the Homo Sapiens Agenda  (see my review), and it was one of my favorite books of 2015. Seeing the movie adaptation

picks up shortly after its predecessor ended, but this book focuses on Leah, Simon Spier's best friend.
But if Leah admits her feelings she knows she'll only get hurt, and she could destroy their circle of friends as well."But it sucks when life moves along without you.
I definitely enjoyed this book but I really struggled at times to feel sympathy for Leah.
So ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ You have been warned.)+ So Leah is an...interesting narrator.I admit she wasn't my favourite in Simon's book and this is purely because she can be really mean and she has a lot of double-standards.
Messy lives need to be in books because life isn't perfect.I just...I think it's fair to ask and demand kindness and apologies.
Also little Simon wrote GAY FANFIC and Bram is literally like "Omg what an adorable baby gay" and I just 😂😂😂.
I think it's okay to have books that are about messy people, but IDK.
& i honestly think the reason I was so gushy and in love with the dynamics between the characters was likely due to this fact!!
i loved leah so much during Simon Vs. because she just had that genuine vibe to her, and she was also such a diverse character.
on the other hand, i hated how rude leah was to her mother  with no context whatsoever  like her mother was so kind and loving ??
like simon and blue were the perfect couple i was gushing and in love.

I felt like Abby and Nick were so into each other in Simon, and having that be switched was so strange.
It also felt SO dumb like "Oh Abby doesn't want to long distance...guess who just HAPPENS to go to the same college as her next year?
I know it's like her character but oh my god I genuinely wanted to tell her to fuck off when Abby came out to her, all quiet and nervous and Leah yells at her to a point where she makes her cry.
I also found the retcon of Leah ACTUALLY liking Abby instead of Nick all this time super cheap, because the previous book is fresh in my mind and I remember all of Leah's outright internalised misogyny @ Abby that never gets addressed once in this book.- Granted, being horrible about women is something most young girls go through, and something that can be developed with nuance.
We're meant to just accept that the girls take 1 road trip and had some supposed offscreen bonding experience before Simon Vs. and that constitutes as a romance.- My main issue with this book is - why does Abby like Leah?
Edit: i’m changing my rating to 3 stars bc i cannot get a certain scene out of my head and i’m just getting progressively more upset about it. anyway, i’ll link my full review when it’s up on youtube <34? 4.5? I DON’t KNOW BUT I CANNOT STOP WALKING AROUND MY ROOM YELLING MY NEIGHBORS MUST THINK IM DYING (not technically a lie bc i kind of am) anywAY AHHH AHH AHHHH GOTTA GO PROCESS MYSELF
1,5 starsGuys. I didn’t like this.I know, I know. I had really high hopes and nobody is sadder about it than I am :(Pros: • The diversity.Cons • Everything else.I’M SO SAD I DIDN’T LIKE THIS BOOK. Seriously, I can’t even tell you how much I wanted to love this but that doesn’t change the fact that Leah on the Offbeat just doesn’t compare to Simon vs. the Homo Sapiens Agenda. This book literally had ALL of the potential but it just fell completely flat for me.***Please note that this review conta
I’ll try to keep it vague and not mention who is involved in the situations, but if you want to be completely surprised about everything, maybe stop reading now.***First of all, I didn’t like Leah.
It’s like Leah is this perfect person, ready (and entitled) to judge each and everyone around her as if she herself were the measure by which everyone else should be judged.
From my point of view, she kind of ends up leading them on ((view spoiler)[I mean, going to prom with someone who is obviously trying to flirt with her all the time?
4 stars!!! How much did I love Leah on the Offbeat by Becky Albertalli?? SO FREAKING MUCH!!! And the main reason I loved it so much was Leah Burke. She is a boss. She’s my hero. I just fucking loved her! I liked her in Simon’s book, but she really shined in her own book. What I love most about Leah is she is unapologetically herself. She never pretends to be someone she’s not and she shouldn’t have to. She is awesome just the way she is.   I swear, people can’t wrap their minds around the concep
How much did I love Leah on the Offbeat by Becky Albertalli??
And the main reason I loved it so much was Leah Burke.
I just fucking loved her!
What I love most about Leah is she is unapologetically herself.
Honestly, I had no idea who Leah’s love interest would be.
I loved how different the two girls were, but how they just worked.
“I thought we liked cussing.”“We love cussing.
I recommend it to all of you who have read and loved Simon.
Honestly, I would 100% recommend reading Simon before this.
so here's some things you should know about me before i get into this:- i'm bi, and was scared to come out to friends irl for so long, even though the ones i would've told are LGBTQ- i'm.
i've never really felt that way before until leah burke came along.
that's something that i'm going to hold close to my heart for a long time.and not to be cheesy as shit but this book also made me feel like....everything might work out for me like it kind of did for leah, y'know?
and i don't think a book has ever made me feel that way before.
“I hate when assholes have talent. I want to live in a world where good people rule at everything and shitty people suck at everything.” I really, really wanted to love this book. It was one of my most anticipated 2018 releases, and I was so excited to get this story from Becky Albertalli. For me personally, seeing a bisexual girl in a mainstream book I knew people would read really means a lot. Unfortunately this fell very very flat to me, and I’m going to be straight up here and acknowledge t
I brought a lot of my ideas and hopes of what this book, and what Becky Albertalli would write, into this book and I think that played a part in my disappointment.I’m going to start with the positives.
if she was a boy y'all would love her but people just HATE FEMALE CHARACTERS)As with all Becky Albtertalli books, this was very readable.
I often felt like aspects of Leah, including Leah’s and Abby’s backstory and how some of the characters interacted, was super out of line with Simon Vs. I want to put a note here that I saw Love, Simon before reading this and that could have influenced by perceptions.
“RIP Leah Burke. She died of acute awkwardosis.” 3.5 ⭐So this was thoroughly enjoyable! I loved being back in Creekwood with the gang! Leah was one of my faves from Simon Vs and she was super relatable. I didn’t love this one as much as Simon Vs, I’ve seen other reviewers say it reads like fan fiction, and I can definitely see that. To swap a characters sexuality from one book to another seems strange, but equally it happens and is understandable and believable at the same time. The best thing

The best thing about Leah is that she is real.
But overall I enjoyed this quick, happy read.
3.5 💜💕Spoiler thoughts below(view spoiler)[I really loved this. The bi rep was awesome, and I am so happy to have Leah and Abby as a couple. But my one complaint is that I wish they waited a lot longer to get together. I felt like everyone kinda screwed Nick over. Especially at the end. I would have loved this if it was about Abby and Leah in their first year of college as roommates and then deciding to be together. But as it was it felt too rushed for me. Other than that I really adored this. (hide spoiler)]
JUST FREAKING WONDERFUL SJHBFKSJDHFBKSDHJF I will talk more about it once it hits shelves!
