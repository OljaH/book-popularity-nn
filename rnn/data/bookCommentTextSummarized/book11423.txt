The book is filled with testimonies of many who were not only physically restored to health but who entered into a relationship with God for the first time by being spiritually reborn. Kathryn Kuhlman, who always credited these wonderful miracles to the Holy Spirit, was not only an instrument of God's healing love, but she was also a wonderful teacher about God's way of life and His power. Great book.....if you want to be encouraged read it.
A tremendous woman of Faith! She travelled this world over many many times. Her teachings are life changing.
Moving miracle storiesEnjoyed reading this book very much. Not only great healing stories. The last chapter of the book explains what faith is and is not. Will read more of Kathryn Kuhlmann's books.
