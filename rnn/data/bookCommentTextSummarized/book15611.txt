"3rd Degree" by James Patterson is the third book in the Women's Murder Club series.
Having read the previous two I was looking forward to this one.Unfortunately I've ended up skipping chapters just so I didn't have to record it as unfinished.
I've read other readers reviews and it still seems to have a good following but for me it just didn't do it.
I have all the other books in the series - I believe there's another 14 or so to go - so hopefully they'll pick up again with the next one.
They are fast and entertaining...yes, including all the cheese.I like to make a game out of taking a shot every time one of the female characters says something no women would say to another women, even if they are best friends.
Seriously, Patterson seems to have zero clue how real women interact.
And I'm usually hammered by the end of a book.Number 3 in the series is about a homegrown terrorist plot, a budding romance and the death of a main character - which really upped the cheese factor for me on this one.
Another excellent installment of Women's Murder Club series by James Patterson and Andrew Gross.Enjoyed it just as much as the first time I listened to it on Audible audio book. Narrator Carolyn McCormick is pretty good, too. Very sad ending, though.
I had 20 likes thanks to you all, and something has happened to them all and now I only have one.
After calling for help, she rushes in and finds two dead bodies...and a child, whom she rescues.What happens in the subsequent days will soon be declared a war of sorts.
And who will be next on the target list?Soon Lindsay and her pals—Claire, Cindy, and Jill—are in the thick of things.
But the entire thing feels rather formulaic and thin.Somehow, despite shocking revelations and stunning returns from the dead, you're never quite shocked or stunned.
A major character dies and it doesn't feel particularly traumatic.
I figured out the mastermind far too easily, and the climax somehow fizzles.
One is a first person narrator for about a quarter of the chapters.
The rest of the chapters are third person narrations following the other women, suspects, victims, what have you.
It's choppy and artificially induces page-turning.Written too quickly, this novel tries to use cheap tricks and pyrotechnics to replace heart and detail.
It's the killing of the characters, and I don't mean in the literal sense of Jill, that is just unbearable.Claire, my favorite, didn't even sound like Claire.
And Lindsay is a woman; as far as I've seen, having been a female all my life, and all, women more often rally around and protect their battered friends, not full-on threaten the husbands.
I'm pretty sure that on some level, Lindsay would have been worried that the abusive husband would become more dangerous once confronted and would have known not to put her friend in that position.
This is the third book in the women’s murder club ,I loved the first one it was amazing The second book, while I loved I didn’t really get into it as much as the first and then there was this one it was shocking.
This book does not disappoint it is full of action and plot twists every time I think I know who is causing the killings suddenly evidence shows up that proves it isn’t them.
I was shocked when I found out that he was going to kill off one of his characters as I love them all, all of them are kickass.
Έτσι λοιπόν στο τρίτο βιβλίο της σειράς, ο ανυποψίαστος αναγνώστης έρχεται αντιμέτωπος με τις συνέπειες που υφίσταται κάποιος όταν διαβάζει για λιμούς, συνθήκες πείνας στον Τρίτο Κόσμο, εξάπλωση του AIDS χωρίς ελπίδες ίασης (γιατί κάποιος προτιμά να κατασπαταλά αυτά τα χρήματα σε προσωπικές απολαύσεις) και μετά απλώς γυρίζει σελίδα.
Σε αυτό το ανατριχιαστικό και αγωνιώδες θρίλερ, έφτασα σε σημείο να δακρύσω στην τελευταία σελίδα, γιατί η γνώριμη σπιντάτη, σχεδόν σεναριακή, γραφή ήταν ακριβώς αυτή που έπρεπε για να μου μεταδώσει την αγωνία της μοναξιάς που ένιωσε η Λίνζι όταν η υπόθεση έφτασε στο τέλος της και έπρεπε να δει τι θα κάνει με έναν άντρα που αγάπησε και την αγάπησε αλλά μένει στην άλλη ακτή της Αμερικής.
5 starsRIP Jill Bernhardt. :-(. Good book. Hope Lindsay and Joe Molinari get together. Case was very weird. Somewhat scary. Can't wait to read 4th of July!!!
Al igual que sucede en las dos entregas anteriores, la protagonista indiscutible y el personaje que más se desarrolla es el de Lindsay Boxer, teniente de la Policía de San Francisco, y como coprotagonistas tenemos a sus amigas, con las que forma el Club de las mujeres contra el crimen.De nuevo, los capítulos son cortos, lo que hace la lectura muy rápida. La forma de escribir de Patterson es sencilla y ágil. Continuaré leyendo el Club, me están gustando mucho, mucho.
Seria asta m a prins, imi place, asa ca nu am decat cuvinte de laudă despre ea. Cam tristă cartea nr 3, dar cu final fericit.
It's great to be able to read these Women Murder Club books in a row.
Admittedly, the story-lines in these books aren't elaborately plotted, but they give the reader enough information to be interested.
Take Jill for instance, the ADA, and friend to Lindsay, Claire and Cindy; I wish I would have known a better.
A beginning of love blooms for Lindsay but, meanwhile, love has curdled at Jill's house, with devastating consequences.This is for sure an almost 4 star read - but not quite.
I actually read the book in one day, i just couldnt put it down.One morning while Lt. Lindsay Boxer of the San Francisco Police Dept.
Lt. Lindsay Boxer went into the burning house to see if anyone was in trouble.
Lt. Lindsay Boxer receives e-mails saying the killers will kill every three days until the government takes responsibility for treating people throughout the world poorly.
Not only is time running out, but one of the Murder Club members is keeping a big secret.
Yes people, Lindsay Boxer and Joe Molinari are involved.
In my opinion 3rd Degree was a very good book.
In this third offering in the Women's Murder Club series, "3rd Degree" starts off with a bang.
And who will be next on the target list?Soon Lindsay and her pals—Claire, Cindy, and Jill—are in the thick of things.
And reminding us all that terror does not always come from outside our borders.Somewhat predictable, but definitely a page-turning novel that features the warm and fuzzy connections between the women.
This might have been an interesting story line to pursue.The motivation for the murderers doesn't add up.
This guy's brother, who was a murderer, is killed by the cops.
So he kills the daughter of a prosecutor, a snitch, and the brother's roommate?
That's his big grudge?It was so obvious that the snooty college professor was in on things.It seems to me that Lindsey's Homeland Security guy was inappropriate for starting up a relationship right in the middle of a case.
If they were equals, that would be one thing, but he was sort of supervising the case.
A Damn good read!Believable characters and plot...not a thing I dislike about this book.
Here are some of my favorite comments from my buddy read: (some are spoilers, but I’ll tag them)26%(view spoiler)[So far I like this book better than the second one, but it’s becoming a little too political heavy for my taste.
(view spoiler)[LT Boxer (hide spoiler)] got some bootyyy!
You go girl!76% “Stories by Eudora Welty, (view spoiler)[Jill always had  (hide spoiler)]great taste in books.” 🤢🤮 I respectively disagree.
I didn’t even finish the damn book, but at least I got an A on the paper.
I now avoid Eudora Welty’s books like the plague.
Digital audiobook narrated by Carolyn McCormick From the book jacket: Detective Lindsay Boxer is jogging along a beautiful San Francisco street when a fiery explosion rips through the neighborhood.
An infant who lived in the house cannot be found – and a mysterious message at the scene leaves Lindsay and the San Francisco Police Department completely baffled.
The formula must not have been working well because there’s a significant change among the club members.
There’s a killing every few chapters, and the women have a personal reason to make sure the perpetrator(s) is/are stopped.
Carolyn McCormick does a reasonably good job voicing the audio.
Interesting, painful and romantic. Lieutenant Lindsay Boxer has earned her rank in solving some of the worst crimes ever committed in San Francisco. This series is getting better every time. This storyline deals with domestic violence, terrorist, romance and crimes all rolled into one. You will enjoy reading it.
It was really a fast-paced book.
Third book in the Women's Murder Club and I loved it just as much as the first two. I was a little upset over a part of it. But the characters were great as they were in the previous two. Kept me on the edge of my seat wondering if they would solve the crimes in time. Can't wait to read the next novel.
Boy, when you get your radicals, it can be quite the crime to solve.
This particular cause, resulting in bombings all over the city and a deadly viral of ricin, is not what it appears to be.
It's personal, and Jill, the District Attorney is caught in the middle of it all.
This kind of story is all too often misunderstood and we all know there are radicals out there, even in the US.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to pin-point the persons who have ruined the lives of innocent people just trying to survive, without putting other innocent lives in danger.
Fun, fast reading. But I couldn't fully connected with people in the story. Maybe I have to read first and second book of this series.
I picked it up because I wanted to read a crime novel with a female lead that wasn't the witness but instead the one taking things under her control.
I had given up on the series already but decided to pick it up again anyway because of the presence of a 'new' love interest.
I also found out that there is a love triangle in the later books.
The guy can barely write a romance what is he doing adding a love triangle??
I will not be returning for more of this series (unless I go crazy) and I don't think I want to read any more of his books either.
A nice plot idea, modern terrorists in USA, who are using the causes of the late 60s as a starting point.But I still feel like his characterizations are weak.
Each book seems lacking in reasons to like these main characters, like he uses the extended time of a series to replace actual character development in a single novel.
I think what bugs me most is that I can see he is a lazy writer.He has a good idea, but seems reluctant to put the time in to make a tight plot, and characters that work together and you care about.
I really enjoy this series especially since the main characters are female, which you don't find too often in crime novels.You don't have to be female to appreciate the great plot, strong characters and fantastic writing style Great book I Highly recommend it...
Best one of the series so far! Even had me in tears at one point! It is still hard for me to get my head around a man writing as 5 women, like sometimes it feels like they think in stereotypes but the overall story is pretty good. Decent read
Actually giving this a 4.5 out of 5 stars
Enjoyed this just as much if not even more than the last two. Have already purchased several more and hope the thrills and twists and turns continue without it becoming a plot blueprint and therefore predictable.
The first two audio books in this series were horrible. This one was WAY better. The plot was even way better. Unfortunately, the series so far has just been kind of...eh. I’m sticking with my 3-star rating because these are easy, fun books and I know what I’m getting into when I start. No award-winning writing here, folks, but an enjoyable audio book for a long commute.
