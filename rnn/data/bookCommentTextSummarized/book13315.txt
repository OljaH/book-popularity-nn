I've read it twice, and both times its simple story and straightforward Universal Truths have stirred me.
Being a witch is her Gift.Now, for some reason, I've read several books about witches this year, but Brida is certainly the first in which the witches are devout God-loving Christians.
This intrigued me for a while, but I decided I was ready to move onto another book about the time Wicca informs Brida that the only way to truly connect with God was to have an intense orgasm.
The only quotes that I liked and made sense in an otherwise rambling narrative:"Nothing in the world is ever completely wrong.
Even a stopped clock is right twice a day" ~ Brida's father (Pg.99)"What is now proved was once only imagin'd" ~ William Blake (Pg.174)"I learned that the search for God is a Dark Night, that Faith is a Dark Night.
And that's hardly a surprise really, because for us each day is a dark night.
None of us knows what might happen even the next minute, and yet we still go forwards.
Because we have Faith." ~ Brida (Pg.24)
Someone to love, someone who loves us, something that adds meaning to our life, our existence.
Some indication to know that our thoughts, feelings, memories, will not die with us when our physical body perishes.
Pick it up, if you think you are alone in finding that elusive something or someone that adds meaning to your life.
P.S: I also especially love the part where the women are standing naked, and do not feel ashamed of their bodies, irrespective of its flaws or perfections, because it is theirs as a facilitator to view this life through a physical form.P.P.S.
بریدا ناچار است، میان دو سنت کهن، یکی را برگزیند: سنت ماه؛ مکتبی اسراری است که برای دست یافتن به آن، باید تمرینهای دشوار، و آئینهای گوناگون را به کار گیرد.
سنت خورشید، سنت هزاران ساله ی بشر، برای دست یافتن به معرفت است؛ و در آن تنها یک اصل حاکم است: اعتماد به شب تاریک ایمان؛ و تنها یک تمرین وجود دارد: نیایش به درگاه خدا، با قلب و روح.
آدم‌ها به‌ هم‌ گل‌ می‌دهند، چون‌ معنای‌ حقیقی‌ عشق‌ در گل‌ها نهفته‌ است.
چون‌ آن‌ گل‌ با شامگاه، با غروب‌ خورشید، با بوی‌ زمین‌ خیس‌، و با ابرهای‌ افق‌، آمیخته‌ است.
“So what is magic?” she asked. …”Magic is a bridge,” he said at last, “ a bridge that allows you to walk from the visible world over into the invisible world, and to learn the lessons of both those worlds.”“And how can I learn to cross that bridge?”“By discovering your own way of crossing it. Everyone has their own way.” My first exposure to Coelho was many years ago. I read The Alchemist at a time in my life when I was experiencing some major changes and I found very real comfort and guidance
I enjoyed several more of his novels but after a time there seemed to be a repetitiveness to them that left me unsatisfied.
Yes, it is a novel, but I expect that that is a politic way of marketing what Coelho believes to be more of a self-help book.
I suppose it is possible that Coelho has some insight into other layers of existence, although I do not accept that as given.
This book made me wish that he had made better use of what mystical powers or insights he might have to have written a more engaging story.Read /posted - 2009Revised/re-posted -12/18/15
I suppose Coehlo thinks the mysteriousness of arcane-sounding phrases like "Tradition of the Moon" and "Dark Night" are substantial enough to keep a reader captivated with neither qualification nor tact.
Perhaps he feels that capitalizing such phrases will provide sufficient proof of their worldliness.A boggling aspect which I can't quite get past is the fact that there is not a single real conversation in this book.
Everyone speaks to each other in brief, billowy ambiguities and somehow knows, with no indication other than the author's repeated assurance, what everyone else is thinking at all times.I would not recommend this book to anyone with an I.Q. higher than a tomato's.
تحكي الرواية قصة بريدا الباحثة عن أسرار الكون التي تتعلم من اثنين من معلمي حكمة الشمس و القمر .بعض المشاهد قد تشعرك بالملل، والبعض الآخر قد يلهمك، والبعض الآخر لا يمكن سوى أن ترفع القبعة تقديراً لخيال باولو ( مشهد لوني و تالبو، مشهد من الصعب نسيانه)لا أعتقد بأنها أفضل كتابات باولو، وجدتني مللت بعض الشيء في النصف الثاني من الرواية، لكنها تبقى جيدة ينصح بها لمعجبين برواياته الأخرى .
لا تحاولي تفسير عواطفك، عيشي كل تجربة بجوارحكِ كلها، واحتفظي بما شعرتِ بأنه هبة من الله حين تجدين طريقك، عليكِ ألا تخافي .
أدوات يستخدمها الله لإرشادنا إلى الطريق )ملاحظة : يوجد العديد من الأخطاء في الترجمة التي ضايقتني حقيقة و أضطررت لإعادة قراءة الجمل مرارا لكي أصل للمعنى المقصود ولا أعرف كيف بهكذا أخطاء أن تقع، في النصف الثاني خصوصاَ ..

That, sometimes, even if you're just in time, it isn't still sufficient.
It doesn't require you to give up all the important things you have just because...Of all the Paulo Coelho books, I believe, this this the best book I've ever read.
There's so much to learn and so much to understand in life.
He wrote it in a way you'll learn.; not just on one side of life, but for the whole package.
But the one who gave it made the best choice of picking it out on the book shelf.
Sometimes, it requires us to choose a difficult path.
كيف أن المرء حين يصادف "نصفه الآخر" يعرفه من بريق عينيه ..
كيف أن المرء يمكنه أن يصادف في طريقه أكثر من " نصف آخر " ..
رغم أن الأمر يشكّل مشكلة.كيف أن الله أودع في كل واحد منا "موهبة" لكي يساهم بها في بناء العالم .كيف أن الحياة بدأت بالخطيئة "خطيئة آدم وحواء" وأن المرء لا يجب أن يخجل من كونه مخطئاً .
نصف ساعة أحياناً في الطريق أو بضع دقائق على مقعد انتظار في الشارع كانت تكفي لتغيير سلوكات النّفس وإرسال رسالة لمجتمع بأكمله مفادها أن الثقافة سلوك قبل أن تكون كتابات ومجرد أفكار حيالية .اقرؤوا في كل مكان كي تتعلموا الحياة .
I liked this little story, but I enjoyed "The Witch of Portobello" (my first Coelho read) more.
However, I think people are looking for a bit too much out of this book.
It's a good little tale, and I enjoyed a few of the lines from it/quotes.
I think Señor Coelho is simply asking us to reflect.
Not every book is a wirlwind, instead a book can be a bit like looking out over a still lake with time to think.
One of the quotes from this book I enjoyed was, "There was a time when people accepted magical expereiences as natural.
Can somebody please tell me what this book was about?!
I loved the Alchemist and this has much of the same philosophical insights and phrases you want to savor .
But I couldn't tell you what the meaning of this book was.
Meets the Magus in the forest who is her soul mate but they don't end up together.
Meets a Witch in the city and wants to become one.
I kept plugging through the book, hoping for some AHA!
moment at the end like the Alchemist, where everything comes full circle, but this was very anti-climatic and I closed the book saying HUH?!?!?
I DID IT!I survived this book!I am a champion!RAAAAAAR! I had an extremely violent, visceral reaction to this story, not because of the mixing of religion and witchcraft, not because of the amorphous way this world worked, not because of the insistence that man and woman are the polar opposite sides of the same thing and that everything everywhere is black and white, yin and yang, light and dark, sun and moon, day and night, no gray area ever. Not even because I rolled my eyes at nearly everythi
I had an extremely violent, visceral reaction to this story, not because of the mixing of religion and witchcraft, not because of the amorphous way this world worked, not because of the insistence that man and woman are the polar opposite sides of the same thing and that everything everywhere is black and white, yin and yang, light and dark, sun and moon, day and night, no gray area ever.
And then feminine intuition rears its head toward the end because we all know witchcraft and magical femaleness are inseparable, the same thing, really.Dude, stop.

The special case between me and Poulo Coelho books is that they come in my life exactly when I'm in a need of them.Brida tells us a story about finding soulmates. Well, if you look at it in that way. How one must look for the right things in his life and why it's important. The tradition of the sun and moon were good to know.The title is very attractive and fits with the story. Couldn't have been a better title. Cover is enchanting. Reading Poulo Coelho is always a great experience in itself.
من اسوء الامور التي تحدث حين يشتهر كاتب معين برواية معينة من المفترض انها الذروة التي وصل لها ادبيا 
"كيف يمكنني أن أعرف 'نصفي الآخر' ؟ " هل لو أتيحت لك الفرصة أن تعرف نصفك الآخر - إذا قابلته - عن طريق علامة جسدية معينة أو ثمة ضوء مميز ينبعث من عينيه ستوافق ؟لا تتسرع في القبول .. ربما ندمت !هناك أشخاص إذا امتلكانهم فقدناهم .. فهم أروع في البعد .. و تملكنا لهم يخلق خوفنا من فقدهم .. ويخلق دائرة مفرغة من العذاب النفسي .. فنشقى في قربهم أكثر من بعدهم ..سعيدة بنهاية الرواية على تلك الشاكلة .. لقد أحببت الفيزياء لأجله !
Again one of the books that I don't understandis it about love? magic? philosophy of life? I don't know and I really don't carebut the atmosphere of the book was great and magicalsometimes it was like a meditation for meby the way, I don't like the author
This is a sweet little story.
In some ways, it reminds me of the kinds of stories one finds in the Bible and the Zohar.
Such stories aren't stories in terms of the classic ideas of plots, but serve to illustrate spiritual points.
I see Brida in that way.
The plot is a very thin scaffold on which to hang a series of philosophical and spiritual ideas.
From the point of view of fiction, this is less than satisfactory.
From the point of view of philosophy, the style is certainly one that's tried and true.
I was stupid af to start Brida🤦3 months ago i started alchemist and hated every word in it neverthel
Brida canvases a beautiful story about an Irish girl, her quest, relationships, love, magic and knowledge about it.This book is not for everyone but those who happened to read it in the right times in their lives, will appreciate its beauty more.Although I have finished reading the book, but its magic and charm will remain with me.
Κριτική στο Blog μου: http://el-bktv.blogspot.gr/2015/07/br...
“None of us knows what might happen even the next minute, yet still we go forward. Because we trust. Because we have Faith.” ― Paulo Coelho, Brida
Paulo Coelho came highly recommended, so I'm going to give him another chance, but this book really didn't live up to my expectations.
For starters, the main character is too much of a Mary-Sue. She's beautiful, we're she's presented as critical (though we don't notice much of this), she has a gift, everyone thinks she's oh-so special.
Although this book often states that a spiritual search is for everyone, at the same time it implies that such things are limited to those who are young, beautiful, gifted, energetic and enthusiastic.
Especially the idea that we're supposed to look for the other half of our soul, and that all other loves are meaningless...

I've never read anything by Paulo Coelho before, so I was rather surprised by the pagan spirituality of this little novel.
It is full of beautifully worded prose--I found myself making little tics and stars beside many paragraphs to go back and examine again (my apologies to those who get the ARC from me, lol).
This is, apparently, one of Coelho's earlier works that has finally been translatted from the original Portuguese.
I found it a good way to whet my appetite for his other works before I come to a decision of what it is I think of him as a writer.
The only expression that could describe my impression after reading this book is “complete disappointment”.
From the very first pages, Magic is presented to the reader as the book’s main theme.
However, I didn’t feel the least bit of magic in the story.
Many issues are dealt with in Brida all at once, that the point was muffled and the novel lost its sparkle.
It’s true that I enjoy Coelho’s writings, and believe them to be insightful and humane, but this book just couldn’t live up to such description.
I wouldn’t recommend this book for anyone except those who like things overly-done, and terribly-philosophized.
هذه الرواية انا اعتبره رحلة كشف عن الذات وما هو ناقص في داخلها اكثر من رحلة بحث عن تعلم السحر, رحلة جميلة مليئة بلمشاعر العالية والمؤثرة للشخصيات وحوارات داخلية رائعة لكل شخصية من الرواية.ابداع اخر في رحلات باولو كويلو مع رواياته الجميلة ومتشوقة وملئية بلمغامرات, الجميل ايظا في الرواية هي تسالت كثيرا داخل مشاعر الانسان وكيفية ربطها وتوافق بين الافكار لكل شخص.
DNF @ about 28%. I guess this book just isn't for me.This book contradicted with my beliefs. Also, I couldn't connect with the story. The author describes well but I just can't understand what's going on in the story. I don't feel the need to read further. (I apologise for writing a DNF review)
Not necessarily because it was a bad story, but because it - ugh, let me start over with this.
Let me tell you that there is ZERO evidence of any kind of Goddess cult surviving for centuries blah blah.
Now modern Paganism is a valid religion.
I would have accepted it as Coelho's invention if not for the disclaimer.
Nevermind the plot or the various wisdoms thrown in which are more or less the reason people read his work.
Do yourself a favor and read The Witch of Portobello and skip right over Brida.
