Why doesn't the world do more to end the horrible inhumanity imposed on people in the work camps of North Korea?
And the political prison camps in North Korea have existed twice as long as Stalins Soviet gulags and twelve times as long as the Nazi concentration camps, and there's no end in site of the between 150,000 and 200,000 people who live in those camps.
North Korea's belligerant reputation combined with nuclear weapons has prevented international pressure to be focused on their work camps.
It takes a pretty strong stomach to read this book.
هر کتابی که دستتون هست رو بذارید زمین، تلفن رو بردارید، نشر چشمه رو بگیرید و همین الان کتاب رو سفارش بدید!!!!!!!!من اصلا از کره شمالی اطلاعات نداشتم، در حد یه شخص معمولی.
این کتاب، سطر به سطر، صفحه به صفحه با روح آدم بازی می کنه.
تعجب آوره که یه انسان چقدر می تونه پست زندگی کنه و چقدر معنی امید متفاوته برای انسان های متفاوت.کتاب داستان حقیقی داره و تمام صحبت ها و اطلاعاتی که می ده با ذکر منبع و سند معتبره.عنوان کتاب، بیانگر محتوا و داستان کتاب هست.خیلی وقت بود یه کتاب رو با ولع تموم نخونده بودم!
عالی بود.
Ostensibly getting rid of families, rather than individuals, considered undesirable by the regime, in actuality slave labour for the State.A mixture of 1984, Animal Farm and the Nazi Dachau concentration camp.
It is the story of North Korea and worse in every single respect than every dystopian novel you've ever read.
One man, only one, escaped and this is his story.Not an easy book to read, but rewarding.
Even if everything in this book has been exaggerated, it would still be the worst nightmare of how people actually live on planet Earth in the 21st or any other century.
Mostly.There are many defectors from NK, some of whom escaped from prisons or labour camps, but Shin is thought to be the only person born in a camp to escape from that camp, which makes his experience more extreme.This should be a really exciting, but agonising story.
Prisoners who violate the laws and regulations of the camp will be shot immediately.The devil really is in the chilling details, not included above.Overall, 2* writing, but 3* for its importance.It's real life contemporary dystopia: I think that's part of the fascination of books like this.
Even though North Korea publicly insists that prison and work camps don't exist, evidence has been seen on satellite photos and on Google Earth.
According to state law, if a family member tries to escape or defect, everyone else in that family will be punished, even if they knew nothing about it.Because he was raised in the prison camp, Shin knew nothing of the outside world.
After hearing the man's stories, Shin began to imagine what it would be like to escape the camp.
So many people have complained about the labor camps in North Korea, and Shin was one of those voices.
I think Shin's story is an important one, but the way that it's presented makes it a little tough to really connect with.
Shin, born and raised in a North Korean labor camp, was the first person actually born in a camp to escape.
I think I'm touched by Shin's story, but not so much the presentation.
Anyway, like I said at the beginning, I do think it's an important story--the world needs to know about North Korean labor camps and how they affect people.
The main character, Shin, having seen his mother and brother hang for planning an escape, spends many years suffering ridiculous torment and miserable conditions, is one of the only known escapees.
He was lucky enough to find people there who opened his eyes to the outside world.
This book at least starts to open our eyes about the situation, not only in the camps, but in North Korea as a whole.
I wish the Chinese, the South Koreans, the Japanese and the US would ban together and come up with a plan to liberate North Korea.
چقدر سخت بود این روایت. و هربار با این سوال روبرو میشی: چکار میشه کرد برای مبارزه با این همه ظلم و ستم؟!

آنها دو مرد و یک پسر جوان را در برابر چشم همهی ساکنان اردوگاه به دار آویخته بودند.
آن دو مرد به سرعت جان دادند، اما جان سپردن پسر جوان یک ساعت و نیم طول کشید.
کسی در پشت سر من پرسید "خدا کجاست؟ او کجاست؟" پس از اینکه پسر جوان جان داد، شخصی که پشت سر من بود مجددا پرسید "الان خدا کجاست؟" و من درون خود صدایی شنیدم که چنین پاسخ داد: "او کجاست؟ او آنجا بر چوبهی دار آویزان است".

کتاب داستان زندگی مردی بیست و سه ساله به نام شین را روایت می‌کند که فرزند حاصل از هم‌خوابی دو اسیر در اردوگاه کار اجباری است، اردوگاهی وسیع و پرجمعیتی که برای مقطوع النسل کردن مخالفان سیاسی ساخته شده؛ بدین شیوه که اقوام فرد مجرم/خائن تا سه نسل بعدتر در این اردوگاه زیر شکنجه و کار طاقت‌فرسا جان خواهند دادپیش از این کتاب‌های مختلفی در مورد اردوگاه‌های مرگ نازی‌ها و تبعیدگاه‌های سیبری خوانده بودم، اما تفاوت اساسی شین با زندانیان دیگر اردوگاه‌ها در این است که شین در اردوگاه بدنیا آمده و همانجا رشد یافته: نه کودکی کرده و نه می‌داند کودکی کردن چیست.
I knew North Korea was a horrible place but I had no knowledge of the prison camps.
For example: A classmate of Shin's (the man who's story is being told) was beat to death by a teacher in front of the class for having a few kernels of corn in her possession.
Shin is the one who reported them to authorities for discussing the escape, because this is what the people are told to do.
Shin's father was put in the camp because a family member of his escaped from North Korea to South Korea.
Subsequently Shin and his brother were born in the camp and knew no other existence.
Entire Families are doomed because of the real or imagined actions of one, and apparently treason must be wiped out over three generations.
So children are born in these camps between assigned parents and never learn filial love or even learn any emotional state higher than the animal need for basic survival.But the writing is somewhat frustrating.The facts are recited and researched well enough, but the way the story is told gets in the way of having more impact.
And ultimately, it does a disservice to the obvious need for the world at large to become more personally outraged as to what's going on over there.
کتاب را بهم معرفی کردند که مثلاً خواندن سختیهای «شین» باعث شود سختیهای حال حاضر خودم را راحتتر تحمل کنم. اما از آنجا که من آدمی نیستم که با شنیدن سختیِ دیگری بگویم «خب، خداراشکر که اوضاع ما چنین است و چنان نیست!»، خواندن کتاب نهتنها آرامشی بهم نداد که بر دردهام افزود.بخش اولِ کتاب که شرح ماجراهای درون اردوگاه است، بسیار کند و دردناک پیش رفت؛ اما دو بخش بعدی -خصوصاً بخش سوم که به اتفاقات بعد از فرار اختصاص دارد- خیلی جذابتر بودند و خواندنشان بهمراتب راحتتر بود.کتاب پُر بود از اطلاعات جدید و دردها
کتاب را بهم معرفی کردند که مثلاً خواندن سختی‌های «شین» باعث شود سختی‌های حال حاضر خودم را راحت‌تر تحمل کنم.
اما از آن‌جا که من آدمی نیستم که با شنیدن سختیِ دیگری بگویم «خب، خداراشکر که اوضاع ما چنین است و چنان نیست!»، خواندن کتاب نه‌تنها آرامشی بهم نداد که بر دردهام افزود.بخش اولِ کتاب که شرح ماجراهای درون اردوگاه است، بسیار کند و دردناک پیش رفت؛ اما دو بخش بعدی -خصوصاً بخش سوم که به اتفاقات بعد از فرار اختصاص دارد- خیلی جذاب‌تر بودند و خواندنشان به‌مراتب راحت‌تر بود.کتاب پُر بود از اطلاعات جدید و دردهای تازه.
While I was reading it, I was so immersed in the story that it took a while to come back to the real world.I am glad I read Barbara Demick's Nothing to Envy before reading this, because I already knew how bad the situation is for ordinary citizens in North Korea, and it was all the more powerful to realize that there are people who live even worse lives in the country's prison camps.
This is the story of Shin Dong-hyuk, a young man born and raised in a North Korean prison camp.
Unlike so many other stories that have come from tragic world events, Shin has learned nothing from his captivity by the end of the book.
In Shin's case by the end of the book, he has learned only to lie continually and be ungrateful...which is not at all a marketable approach to his story.A bigger problem was the writing style.
Shin's story is merely a catalyst to launch us into a history lesson - not the focal point of an chapter or the book itself as we are lead to believe.The biggest problem of all, however, is the failure of the author to disclose his own agenda at the beginning.
When North Korea ever pops up in the news, the items usually covered are about a buffoon-like dictator, the absurd show of brainwashing (real or staged) of many of its people, and the threat of it getting a nuclear bomb.
The force of this book is the chronicle of one man who was born and raised (if that can be called the right term) in one of North Korea's brutal concentration camps (yes, dear, concentration camps still exist in this world today), where life is cheap and the system eventually kills you.
در یک چهارم باقیمانده، نویسنده از زندگی شین و بقیه آدمای خارج شده از کره شمالی بعد از آزادی و شرایطی که باهاش مواجه بودن میگه.
آدمی که اون همه خطر کرده برای رهایی از اون شرایط، و بهش پناه داده شده و نهادی داره تلاش میکنه که برش گردونه به زندگی عادی، خودشو میکشه.
به این دلیل که نمی تونه خودش رو با شرایط موجود وفق بده.
انقدر بهش خیانت شده که نمی تونه باور کنه آدمای دور و برش قصد دارن کمکش کنن.
انقد سیاه بوده همه چی، که سفید رو باور نداره.برنده این بازی تا الان کره شمالی ه.
Their children may ask, a generation from now, why the West stared at far clearer satellite images of Kim Jong Il's camps, and did nothing.”No more brazen and poetic meaning could be found than reading this line from the book, once upon a time seems almost pertinent to this book.
In time he grew to resent his mother, this repugnance would soon lead to a chance encounter with an outsider who would open Shins mind to a world beyond the vile fence.
no longerand so the journey to escape was born in Shins mind.
4 STARS”Tibetans have the Dalai Lama and Richard Gere, (the) Burmese have Aung San Suu Kyi, (the) Darfurians have Mia Farrow and George Clooney. North Koreans have no one like that. Actually North Koreans have imgur, Dennis Rodman and Ken Jeong in Stevie Wonder glasses.A couple of months back, Petra recommended this book to me after posting this link in Booklikes. I’m the least literate person I know when it comes to world politics but human depravity is always fascinating even within the harro
I couldn’t have dreamed this scenario if I tried.I liked that Harden strove to link Shin’s story with the bigger events happening in the country as a whole, though these aspects could’ve been integrated better.
In some ways this helped me in finishing the other book I was reading because for a stretch, I could only read a chapter of this at a time.The first half a bit of a struggle to read through in one sitting but I was thoroughly engrossed with the second, after Shin has escaped from camp as he tries to assimilate in normal society.
خصوصا برای منی که هیچی در مورد کره ی شمالی تا حالا نخونده بودم مطالب زیادی داشتیه معضل فلسفیدرک فلسفی رو هم اضافه کردم چون سرگذشت شین در عین اینکه قضاوت اخلاقی ما رو شدیدا درگیر می کنه، همین قضاوت اخلاقی رو به پرسش می کشه: اگه اخلاقیات انقدر به محیط و تربیت وابسته است، آیا اصولا "اخلاقیات" وجود داره؟ یا صرفا هنجارهاییه که بدیهی انگاشته شدهنویسنده ای نه چندان خوب، روایتگری جذاباز حیث نویسندگی، کتاب اصلا یه اثر ستودنی نیست اما روانه و خوندنی.
برای من که هیچ اطلاعی از وضعیت ساکنین کره شمالی نداشتم کتاب تکان دهنده ای بود 😔
The story of a man escaping a prison camp would pique my interest at any time, but add the detail that it's a North Korean camp and I'm definitely interested.
Then I heard that Shin had lied about certain details regarding his story and I thought, oh boy, here we go...However, Harden did a good job in allaying my fears.
It turns out Shin's lies did not change the details of his escape or the horror stories of his confinement.
یکی ازون کتابایی که وقتی که میبندیش و تموم شده کلی اطلاعات جدید داری :))))) ولی چقد شین شاااانس داشت یعنی اگه من جای شین میخواستم فرار کنم ده باری من و میگرفتن یا از گشنگی،خونریزی،... میمردمیه چیزی که خیلی بش فک میکردم این بود که چقد جامعه تاثیر داره رو اخلاق و شخصیت و ...قبل از خوندن کتاب فک میکردم یه درصد زیادیش به وجود ادم ربط دارهدرک و باور اینکه خیلی از اتفاقای تو کتاب تو زمان حاضر داره اتفاق میفته به شدت برا من به شخصه سخت بودو در اخر اینکه:انسانم ارزوست:/
He ate rats, frogs, insects and the undigested kernels of corn found in cow dung.Every year he witnessed dozens of executions, violent beatings and slow deaths by starvation, untreated illness, torture, and work accidents.When Shin was 14, he overheard his mother and brother planning an escape attempt.
Shin was born there, the product of a casual liason orchestrated by the camp guard to provide more slave labour.
His particular story is now the subject of Escape From Camp 14:One Man's Remarkable Odyssey from North Korea To Freedom In The West, written up on the basis of numerous interviews with the subject by Blaine Harden, a journalist who works for the Washington Post.
Hell could not be so cruel.It’s a world where Shin saw his first execution at the age of four.
It’s an indictment of those who repeatedly condemn the alleged human rights abuses of the Israelis and remain silent about North Korea.
نثر کتاب گزارشی و خبرنگاری که البته برای کتابی با این موضوع یک مزیته، به هر حال سرگذشت شین اونقدر تراژدیکه که احتیاجی به پیچوتابهای ادبیاتی نداره. به نظم این کتاب رو نباید از دست داد،خوندنش دردناک، آزاردهنده و حتی چندش اوره اما باید گاهی به خودمون یاداوری کنیم، بشر چقدر می،تونه پست باشه یا بیرحمانه با هم نوعش برخورد کنه.

I'm not sure how one should rate a journalistic account of some of the worst attrocities happening at this very second in our world, but I'll give it three stars...
He was taught to spy and tell on the other childre, he watched his mother's death without blinking and he was tortured in horrible ways for supposedly knowing about her attempted escape.
He did know about it - he was the one who told the guards she was going to escape.
I hope, during my lifetime, I'll live to see Kim and his entire Politburo burn to ashes.
I hope it won't get replaced by something worse...
فردی به نام "شین" اولین کسی هست که موفق میشه از این اردوگاه های کار که هیچ کس از وجودشون اطلاعی نداره فرار کنه.
اگر بچه ای هم به دنیا بیاد، باید همه ی عمر توی این اردوگاه زندگی کنه.
اینا همه فقط بخش کوچیکی از وقایعیه که شین توی اردوگاه تجربه کرده.داستان کاملا واقعیه اما توی بعضی خبرا خوندم که ظاهرا بعدها شین اظهار کرده که درمورد بیان جزئیات کاملا صادق نبوده.شرح خاطرات شین به شدت دردناک و دلخراش بود و نکته ی جالبش برای من این بود که این وقایع اصلا مربوط به گذشته نیستن و مرتبط با چند سال اخیر هستن.
