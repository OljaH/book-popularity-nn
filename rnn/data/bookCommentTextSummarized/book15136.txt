Despite his relative inexperience, the logistical difficulties of painting something so absurdly high (contrary to popular belief, Michelangelo did not paint lying on his back, though rumor has it that he did once eat a plate of pasta in that position, which, in and of itself, should be recognized as one of history‚Äôs most daring and difficult feats, because gravity‚Ä¶am I right?), the sheer amount of square footage involved (it took Michelangelo more than 4 years to complete), and the near-constant turmoil that resulted from then-Pope Julius‚Äôs warmongering ways (side note: my alma mater, Ohio Wesleyan University, features the seemingly inexplicable Battling Bishop as its mascot; that concept makes a lot more sense after reading about the exploits of the vainglorious Julius), Michelangelo produced a masterpiece of form and aesthetics that continues to inspire people today.
This book felt like the best read I've had in a long time.
The author goes over Michelangelo's character and his relationships with various figures of the days.
As the book follows the progress on the vault, we are made privy to the ever changing political landscape and the ongoing competition with Raphael, as each one pushes the boundaries of art.I have read quite a bit about the Papacy during the Middle-Ages and this was a very nice refresher of the events in Northern Italy at the time.
The book details the technical challenges of the painting of the Sistine Chapel (ranging from paint issues to scaffolding issues to design issues), the life of Michelangelo leading up to the commission, the historical events during the reign of Julius and how they intersect with the chapel painting, and other such details.
Secondly, King includes far too many details of every historic event even remotely related to the completion of this great work, and the tangential details ruin the pacing.
Overall, a recommendation only for fans of the Sistine Chapel, or for European or Art History majors.

Indeed, Michelangelo did not lie flat on his back to paint painstakingly the frescoed scenes on the curved Sistine Chapel ceiling.
Michelangelo employed numerous assistants to help with all phases of the work, since sculpture in stone rather than fresco painting was his medium of choice.King renders both the artist and the pope as formidable personalities.
Although respectful, Michelangelo never cowered before Pope Julius II, and was probably highly admired and respected in return.The Sistine chapel ceiling that took more than four years to complete has become synonymous with Michelangelo's name.
King points out numerous details that illuminate the life and work of an artist whose portfolio seems inexhaustible.
There‚Äôre plenty of guides who tell one and the same story every day in Sistine Chapel, or in the Louvre (insert the museum that you like most) and don‚Äôt even try to make it fun to listen.
Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I love scholars and respect what they do, I certainly know that being a guide day by day is exhausting, and I don‚Äôt think that every individual is obliged to be in awe standing in front of the work of art.
Moreover, I believe art history may be appealing for a huge audience once the person who tells the story makes it relatable.
This book is a fascinating trip through early 16th century Italy, focusing mainly on the frescoing of the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel.
I read several reviews here on Goodreads in which the reviewers felt that the author should have stuck solely to Michelangelo and his art, and that all the other information given is completely extraneous.
I do not have a degree in Art History, nor have I taken an Art History course, but I found this book a fascinating read that drew me in from the first chapter, covering everything from how a fresco is applied to the wall to how colors are created and ground for application onto the plaster to the effect of Julius II's tyrannical papacy on Michelangelo and his art, as well as the rest of Italy.
why is this book soooo boring?! I'm only on page 100-ish and it's taken me forever to get that far because it's so boring. not sure how much longer i can hang onCan't hang on any longer! made it to like 70 pages left, figure i will pick it back up again when i get a bad case of insomnia as it is sure to cure it!
2,80 üòïUn gran calderone, un bombardamento di notizie che spesso non sono inerenti all‚Äôargomento principale del libro.
Continui salti di tema in uno stesso capitolo, con nozioni che non interessano al lettore o che non dimostrano avere fondamento nella letteratura artistica.
Al posto di un libro di arte mi sono trovata davanti un testo pseudo-storico pieno di racconti aneddotici (non provati), dove si preferisce ricostruire la figura umana e non artistica dei personaggi che compaiono sulla scena agli inizi del Cinquecento.
La narrazione della realizzazione della volta della Sistina √® interrotta continuamente da notizie su Raffaello, che, sebbene sia ‚Äúl‚Äôantagonista‚Äù del momento per Michelangelo, potrebbe benissimo essere relegato in un suo capitolo.

It was a huge chore to slug my way through this tome.
Perhaps if a trip to Italy were in the near future I'd have enjoyed it more.
As it is, I realized that the descriptions of more than one painting or fresco were ones I'd blithely walked past with barely a glance when I was in Florence a few years ago.
I did learn a lot about the Sistine Chapel and if I ever see it I'll know more than most, but that's what tour guides are for, so why did I force myself to finish it?
No reason but stubbornness and true grit.
The story of Michelangelo‚Äôs struggle to obey a pope and paint a fresco on a ceiling though he always considered himself a sculptor makes for a dramatic book. The author shares the story sequentially, as Michelangelo slowly makes his way across the ceiling, over a four year period, and intertwines this story with the story of the pope and his desire to keep France out of his realm.
This very interesting book tells the story of how a notable sculptor such as Michelangelo Buonarroti came to spend four years or more of his life painting the ceilings of the Sistine Chapel for pope Julius II.
I know very little of Italian history and have no interest in catholicism but despite these disadvantages, with wit and excellent writing skills Ross King led me to a much better understanding of the country, events and era that help shape Michelangelo and Julius, leading to the amazing ceiling that it one of the wonders of the world.
It was somewhat slow going as I read the book because I kept switching to my iPad to look up pictures of various works of art mentioned in the book.
Years ago I read Irving Stone's "The Agony and the Ecstasy," then saw the movie and was captivated by it.
However, I learned through Ross King's book that there is much mythology in Stone's book.
Since I finished the book I've begun seeing the Great Courses lectures "The Genius of Michelangelo." And, despite it not being factual, I plan to see "The Agony and the Ecstasy" again.
King does a fine job of pulling together information about Michelangelo himself, his struggles with "il papa terribile" Julius II as well as with his family members and his rivals.
Memorable also is the story of Julius's numerous health crises and recoveries - you begin to believe that the old b______ will never die, and he might have died much sooner had he paid attention to his doctors.
It's too bad the illustrations are not more numerous, but if you refer to good pictures of the Sistine Chapel, you will be fascinated by the progress of Michelangelo's skill as a fresco painter, as well as by his personality and the conditions under which he completed this truly herculean task.
While I was reading this book I kept a picture of the Sistine Chapel up on the computer so I could "follow along" with Ross King and his descriptions.This book did a wonderful job of describing Michaelangelo's work, dispelling some of the myths that have accumulated because of Irving Stone's the Agony and the Ecstasy.
Aside from the Sistine Chapel, King discusses Raphael, who was frescoing the Pope's library at the same time.
Most importantly of all he describes the history and its important players during the years Michaelangelo worked on his masterpiece.
If you like Art History and the Renaissance, this a good book to read.
There are wonderful scenes of Michelangelo showing why he was possibly the only man in Rome who could stand up to ‚Äúil papa terribile‚Äù, and it quickly becomes clear why this pope has such a nickname.
The times were terrible and dark but the art was magnificent.In this Kindle edition, the illustrations and photos are just not good enough, so I read this book with an internet connection close by, Googling each work of art to appreciate fully.
Yes, Cod, not God. I wonder if autocorrect was at work here and why we did not get the final edit.
He shows him rather as the head of a team of skilled laborers, with the artist still emerging as a remarkable talent revered by his peers, including Raphael, the young upstart who labors at the same time painting the stunning, yet less well known, "School of Athens."As a Catholic theologian I grimaced at the ugly papacy of Julius II, the megalomaniac who ran roughshod over the gospel to claim papal states in open war.
Somehow he managed--amidst negotiations with the pope, noise from his family in Florence, jealousy and competition with his artistic mentors and peers, and politicking with cardinals--to produce one of the world's most astounding works of art.
Although I enjoyed this book overall, and King does a good job dispelling some of the myths that have arisen around Michelangelo and the painting of the Sistine Chapel's ceiling, it read too much like an art major's master thesis.
did not show the ceiling in its entirety, and 2.
did not have close-up views of the panels beyond one or two samples.
King often described the panels in detail, but some of them were missing from the panoramic view; and if they were included, you had to get out a magnifying glass to try to appreciate the details.
I found the discussion of Italian history during this period, especially the wars of Pope Julius II to be informative.
I read this on the Kindle; one problem with a book about art is that you want to see what the author is talking about, and the Kindle version only provided microscopic (IMO) views of what he was talking about.The book also covers Raphael's murals in the Papal Apartments.
This was also interesting, but I was somewhat disappointed that the book had no real coverage of the Last Judgment fresco painted by Michelangelo, also in the Sistine Chapel.
comprehensive and fascinating discourse about Michaelangelo and Pope Julius II as well as Raphael, contemporaneous politics, religion, culture, etc. in another book, Vittoria Colonna was said to be an inspirer to Michaelangelo; this book seemed to indicate that he had no female intimates of any kind even though the time periods seemed to overlap.
Recently visited Italy and got to see the Sistine Chapel at the Vatican Museum and someone recommended this book which tells the story of Michaelangelo and the history of the four years it took to complete this monumental art project.
Need to re-shelve and read another time.
The characters seem a little overdramatic, but the art history is fun.
Never explained why Michelangelo didn‚Äôt sign ‚ÄòKowabunga Turtle Power‚Äô but overall a solid read.
I enjoyed the details about Michelangelo's labors and his rivalry with another famous Renaissance painter, Raphael. Now that I know more about the lives of these two men, I have a deeper appreciation for the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.
I was disappointed..
plus if you read the notes some of what he says is actually still not agreed upon..
it was an interesting read but there is no comparison to his Brunelleschi‚Äôs Dome which was spectacular...
if you are interested in this time period and art ...
this is a good read..
I don‚Äôt know why the pictures in the book do not include details of the ceiling or Raphael‚Äôs frescoes...
the two page rather small depiction of the ceiling is not even complete!
If you read this have a computer handy to pull up the details he discusses..

At the age of 33, the sculptor Michelangelo Buonarroti, was summoned to Rome by Pope Julius II.
Having been essentially fired from the job of sculpting the Pope's tomb, this strong willed artist defied and denied the invitation as long as he could.
The book covers the fresco process, how paints were made and their components procured and how the sculptor turned painter defied the architect and built his own scaffold.
Going in order of their creation, the panels are explained.While Michelangelo is painting, Pope Julius is also busy.
The very brief sketches of Julius and Michelangelo in Basilica are more compelling.Perhaps the hardcover edition has more photos.
This fascinating book tells the story of those four extraordinary years and paints a magnificent picture of day-to-day life on the Sistine scaffolding - and outside, in the upheaval of early sixteenth-century Rome.I found this book fascinating and couldn't wait for my train ride each day to pick it up again.
Ross King tells the history of Michelangelo and his work on his most famous piece of art in such a readable and accessible way.I chose to read this book ahead of a trip to Rome to get a sense of the history behind the Sistine chapel ceiling and I was not disappointed.
