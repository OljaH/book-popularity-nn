She also lived in a time when being a woman, not to mention Jewish, were both factors used against ordinary people, not to mention a radical activist.Within this context, Rosa Luxemburg rose to challenge Party leaders on a daily basis, earned their respect, and also came to be known as one of the leaders of the left within Social Democracy, along with Jean Jaures, Lenin, and many others who would later become symbols of the working class against the war.
Rosa Luxemburg is a hero, and I recommend this biography to anyone trying to understand not only her, but the world of Social Democracy, of Lenin, and of International Socialism during a highly contentious, and dangerous time period.
beautiful. even though i knew she was murdered at the end, i still cried... :(
3.5 stars. I'm glad I read it, but it had its moments and got pretty dry in parts.
