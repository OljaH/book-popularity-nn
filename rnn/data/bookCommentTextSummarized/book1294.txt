When I was a child my mum read me almost every Uncle Arthur book. I still remember some of the stories to this day.
I remember my friend reading "Jesus Understood" to the class when I was in grade two.
I loved the story then, and I still do.However, I would caution parents to remember that these stories are old-fashioned now.
Even though the values they portray are timeless, they were written at a time when political correctness was not an issue (the author passed away in 1970).
I recommend skimming each story over before presenting it to your child, and making whatever small changes you feel are necessary.
Used this way, Uncle Arthur's stories will continue to promote the values that many of us want our children and grandchildren to embrace.
I grew up with a 20 volume set of these books and read every story. The author is a 7th Day Adventist and I still recall that several of the stories were crossed out with a black marker and a note that said "False doctrine."
I read this when I was in the hospital as a kid, it really lifted my spirits with lots of good lessons and (kind of) funny stories.
When I started reading my mother read this to me as well as helping me read it
Full of short stories that take you to another time.
Really good set of amazing stories that I LOVE! Mom reads this to me every time I go to bed!!!
