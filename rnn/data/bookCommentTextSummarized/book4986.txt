I didn't like this one. The central intrigue of the spies was corny, and their feeble attempts to involve John Sargent were not believable. Victor was overbearing stupid and rude, Lisle's father was barely in the story, and Lisle's mother kept waffling. You'd think she'd been thoroughly offended by Victor, but then there she was in another chapter begging Lisle to give him another chance. What a wishy-washy woman! I'd never have let my daughter near such a weasel once I heard him spout off the way he did. Overall, not one of her better stories.
Good bookA good book that teaches it is right to do what will honor God . When you try to get something in the wrong way, God will not bless you.
This Christian romance novel has a World War II espionage flavor.
WW II espionage twist.It moved slow and progressively seemed to drag even more. I almost didn't finish it at all, but I was stuck in bed after knee surgery.
