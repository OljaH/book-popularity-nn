I kept distracting myself with the thought, "Why the hell haven't I read more of Neil Gaiman's books?" Then I would have to tell myself to shut up, because I'm reading one right now, and I can return to berating myself later.Neil Gaiman really understands fantasy.
I couldn't help but to be completely charmed by and immersed into London Below, right up until the point when some jackass started to wonder, "Why the hell haven't I read more of Neil Gaiman's books?"==============So, a few years later, and a lot of people seem to like this review, still.
I am in love with the looks of this little book!
The picture looked like a grown up picture of Twig from The Edge Chronicles that Chris Riddell did the illustrations on =D I loved those books too.
Richard Mayhew is living a life that is boring in my opinion.
Richard stops to help the girl who is bleeding and pretty much blows Jessica off.
Richard takes the girl named, Door, to his home and lets her rest as she doesn't want to be taken to a hospital.
Richard is stuck there trying to help Door and some others.
Okay, so people have been telling me to read Neil Gaiman for ages. They assume I've read American Gods because the premise is similar to the Percy Jackson series. Well, I still haven't read American Gods, but I did pick up Neverwhere in the Heathrow airport and read it on the way back home. I enjoyed it a lot. Great fantasy, wonderful sense of humor. I can understand why Gaiman is so popular. I'll have to look up his other books.

Besides, there is that certain 'something' in Neil Gaiman's writing that keeps bringing me back to his works - that cleverness, I guess, that boldness in his approach to writing, that apt descriptiveness that burns scenes into your mind without becoming boringly detailed or repetitive, and the bit of mesmerizing darkness he harbors in all of his works, regardless of the theme or target audience.In Neverwhere Gaiman uses the old technique of taking a person belonging to the 'regular' world and throwing them into the midst of a fantastical reality, using the protagonist as our eyes into this world - think of "Alice in Wonderland" or "The Wizard of Oz" or its younger siblings like Mi√©ville's "Un Lun Dun".Richard Mayhew is a timid and perfectly average London guy who suffers from a noticeable lack of figurative backbone - and the only time in his life he does show some of that ill-fated backbone, combined with some very real compassion, he gets himself into trouble that is waaaay over his head.
Allow an example:There are four simple ways for the observant to tell Mr Coup and Mr Vandemar apart: first, Mr Vandemar is two and a half heads taller than Mr Croup; second, Mr Croup has eyes of a faded, china blue while Mr Vandemar's eyes are brown; third, while Mr Vandemar fashioned the rings he wears on his right hand out of the skulls of four ravens, Mr Croup has no obvious jewellery; fourth, Mr Croup likes words, while Mr Vandemar is always hungry.
I think he benefited from calling on existing infrastructures like the London Underground to give a sort of map, but he worked it into the story beautifully.
The story is plot-driven, following the quest of Door, and Richard tags along once he is accidentally brought into this world.
Richard starts as a fly on the wall for the reader to see London Below but as the story unfolds he becomes an active participant in the quest.That's why the story is never boring.
I'm sensitive to giving away spoilers so if it bothers you stop reading here..........By the end of the book, we become Richard trying to open a door to London Below.
I know it‚Äôs because the setting are based on our real world but for me who never goes to London and know about it only from movies and the TV series Sherlock Holmes (THE NEW SEASON IS COMING OUT IN 3 DAYS BTW), I have to Google Image almost every places mentioned in the book otherwise I can‚Äôt imagine what the setting of the story even look like.
(Btw, are all Urban Fantasy the same case as this?)By the end of this book, I can‚Äôt help but feel I wanted a sequel and I'm looking forward to read more of Neil's work.
His fiance couldn't quite see the girl - or more like once she noticed the bleeding girl, his fiance would just as quickly un-notice her.Shrugging that off, Richard takes the girl back to his apartment (at her insistence) and tends to her wounds.
A few short days later, much to his horror, people start to react to Richard the same way.
Door (the injured girl from before) takes pity on Richard and allows him to join her crew - though much to his dismay, this new world is filled with sewer people, terrifying women and the worst possible creatures and things.
Neverwhere!Upon beginning a review of Neverwhere by Neil Gaiman my first thoughts were to write that even a bad Gaiman novel was better than most other authors best work.
But this is unfair, Neverwhere is not a ‚Äúbad‚Äù novel at all.
Compared to Stardust or Anansi Boys, or especially the masterpiece American Gods, it lacks the epic presence and may even be categorized as one of Gaiman‚Äôs lesser works.
What is present, though, is Gaiman‚Äôs phenomenal writing, his brilliant and original imagination and his ability to simply tell a good story.
I was fascinated by the marvelous and imaginative setting of Neverwhere and London Below, but only mildly entertained by the plot, which ‚Äï other than the beginning and the end ‚Äï I found quite forgettable.Still, when I was offered the chance to read a 2016 edition of Neverwhere with the ‚Äúauthor‚Äôs preferred text‚Äù and illustrations by Chris Riddell, whose illustrations make Gaiman‚Äôs The Sleeper and the Spindle so memorable, I jumped at the chance.
:)We'll see if the reread + Riddell's wonderful pencil drawing illustrations change my initial 3 star rating here.Initial review: Neil Gaiman's fantasy about a dark, magical London underworld, which exists side by side with our world, left me with mixed feels.
This is Neil Gaiman: He's not one of Stephen King's favorites for nothing!Incredibly short, seemingly dippy sentences make up this whimsical phantasmagoria-- more Hollywood script/ graphic novel than novel outright.
It must be said that the constant name dropping (we see angels, references to Atlantis...um, Charlaine Harris doppelgangers??) becomes insipid: Gaiman takes over already-told stories instead of making brand spanking new ones.
All this said, the puppetmaster does well with the toys he himself has brandished, placing them in ridiculous situations as outlandish & incredible as those found at Hogwarts or Oz. This & 'Stardust' are equally lit that is just above average & right below great.
Oh and there‚Äôs a marquis and an angel thrown in for good measure!I enjoyed this more than I did The Ocean at the End of the Lane; it had a bit more grit and spite about it - even a swear word or two and an instance of bosom fondling (Neil Gaiman, you naughty schoolboy!).But there is a child-like simplicity to his writing, and I can‚Äôt escape the feeling that it‚Äôs all a bit too YA for me.
My first Gaiman and I‚Äôm enchanted by the quirkiness of this booküòç
Now imagine if someone took the first book and mad libbed characters, settings, monsters, etc, so that you were left with the exact same story except instead of travelling the galaxy with your crazy friend and the most powerful man in the universe, you were travelling in haunted British sewers with a nerd's wet dream of a Xena warrior princess rival and a Gothic princess who can unlock doors (sigh).
Between all the cliche characters, cheesy narration, and formulaic plot, its just not worth your money or a read, especially when Hitch Hiker exists already.
:(I could have spent many more hours exploring those underground tunnels in the company of those wonderful people, and reveling in the amazing things that some of them - especially marquis de Carabas - had to say.I could have spent many more days reading and re-reading those delightfully formed sentences, laughing at the intelligent absurdity of it even when not-so-scary villains were doing not-so-pretty things.I could have spent many more rainy Sundays cooped up in my room and dreaming about rat-speakers and angels, midnight markets and doors, the London Above and the London Below.But no matter how much I tried to prolong it (and trust me, I did), the inevitable happened.I made it past the last page.And I miss you.
Why don't you have a sequel?I loved you before I even started - maybe the words 'Neil Gaiman' on your cover had something to do with that??
Richard had noticed that events were cowards: they didn't occur singly, but instead they would run in packs and leap out at him all at once.This is a very well-written and predictable book by Neil Gaiman.Richard is an office drone.Of course he is.And he's dating a go-getting, beautiful woman who doesn't love him for what he is, but sees "potential" and dreams about the man she can turn him into.
Our first clue that he's a moron.And he's an orphan.Of course he is.One day, which seemed just like every other ordinary day, he and Girlfriend are walking to an important dinner with Important People whom Girlfriend really really wants to impress, when Richard stumbles upon a filthy, skinny young woman in rags who is bleeding profusely.
‚ÄúBeware of Doors.‚Äù  Neverwhere reminded me of Alice in Wonderland with a darker setting. The lead character is an adult confronting a world that he's never known before. The concept of Neverwhere is easily understandable even though the narrative is multi-layered and complicated. Why not ? This is exactly an urban fantasy novel without young adult materials, but Gaiman managed to throw some little things that we're so accustomed to, such as London, the lousy villains, the wise hero and MAGIC.Th
This is exactly an urban fantasy novel without young adult materials, but Gaiman managed to throw some little things that we're so accustomed to, such as London, the lousy villains, the wise hero and MAGIC.There's a point that hit me hard, though.
I loved how surreal this work was, the mix of fact and fantasy is even and it's hard to find this kind of work from somewhere.
Neverwhere is a piece of art that is so simple but unique because it was written by Gaiman.
Richard's motivation was kinda flat, but other than that, everything in Neverwhere was fine and worth reading.
‚ÄúThe Marquis sighed. "I thought it was just a legend," he said. "Like the alligators in the sewers of New York City."Old Bailey nodded, sagely: "What, the big white buggers? They're down there. I had a friend lost a head to one of them." A moment of silence. "It was OK," gurned Old Bailey with a grin that was most terrible to behold. "He had another.‚Äù This book feels like pure magic. And wow, looks like I'm getting the Gaiman hype. Neverwhere follows the story of Richard Mayberry, a pile of anx
Something I‚Äôve consistently loved about Gaiman is his villain writing ‚Äì his villains tend to be humorous characters in their own right.
This was the first Gaiman book I read in physical copy, and I think his writing may just translate better for me on paper than on audio because I liked this so much more after I switched from audio - and that‚Äôs even though I love his voice!!
The lack of references within the writing give a sense of timelessness and ambiguity that feels perfect for the story.
With developed characters, interesting worldbuilding, a timeless feel, and such excellent writing, this is one I‚Äôd highly recommend.
And, in true Gaiman fashion, the fate of the world hangs in the balance.It's a good story, the characters and worldbuilding are magnificent, and it's full of Gaiman's signature reminders that magical worlds are actually fucking terrifying, as well as plenty of his unexpectedly funny bits, like this exchange:"The door was opened by a sleepy-looking footman, wearing a powdered, crooked wig and scarlet livery.
It was something involving a key - I read the book a few days ago, and already the details of the mission are slipping away - but I never felt like I really understood the importance of it all, and it just functioned as a way for the characters to keep hanging out and struggling against evil together.
This was another book group selection (not mine), but by someone who has very good taste in books.I'd never read Gaiman before, but he seems to be immensely popular.
We read it in 2009, many years after it first hit print, but still at the cusp of my interest in fantasy books.
I think it was too much of a fantasy for me, as I tend to need some rules or boundaries, and I couldn't tell what was real here.
read this if you love fantasy.
here's the scoop: I read A LOT.
‚ÄúWe are,‚Äù said Mr. Croup, ‚Äúafter all, famed across the entirety of creation for our skill in the excrutiatory arts.‚ÄùNeverwhere is full of memorable characters, when you read a book in the fantasy field (urban fantasy in this case) it is usually the world building and the plot that drive the narrative, but Gaiman is not your average author, even within his fantastical setting we are still very much invested in the characters.Neverwhere is basically the story of mild-mannered office worker Richard Mayhew who proves the old adage ‚Äúno good deed goes unpunished‚Äù by helping out a girl he finds bleeding on the pavement.
Actual Rating: 3.5 StarsI've not read as much of Neil Gaiman's work as I would have liked to by this point in my life, and so I thought I would fix that with one of his stand alone novels.
But mostly, it's not.‚ÄùThis novel is ripe with black humor, violence, and magic; it's critical of how often we anxiously await the end of our journey through life instead of enjoying the ride.
So in short, I'll say that I enjoyed where this novel was trying to take me.
I maybe wasn't on board with some of it's components, but there are some absolutely stellar moments.If you're die hard fan of Gaiman, this is definitely required reading.
What if there was a London Below, a strange world which consists of Underground railways, tunnels, sewers, and sometimes uncannily parallels the London that the average inhabitant thought they knew but didn't, and in a way that seems a lot more interesting?
I'm not saying you will see me taking off on a sewer adventure (not going to happen), but at least I can read about it, and think that it didn't sound quite as bad as I thought it would (for the most part).I liked the diversity of this world.
What a wonderfully whimsical and well-written novel.One of my projects for 2017 was to get through a stack of Neil Gaiman books, of which Neverwhere is my fourth and favourite.
Neverwhere opens with the entirely average, good-natured Richard Mayhew opting to help a wounded homeless girl on the streets of London rather than go off on an important date with his fianc√©.
My fianc√© recommended this one to me and we had a great chat about how Gaiman builds London Below so effectively because Richard is essentially the reader placed in this ludicrous situation.
Neil Gaiman's books are so beautiful inside and out.

*7/10 spangly shooting starsA contemporary urban fantasy novel in typical slightly off-beat Gaiman style.
(In fact, I had to keep stopping myself from mentally ticking off the 'stages' of the traditional fairy tale as per the structuralist narrative analysis of folk tales by Vladimir Propp and Svetlan Todorov.)Is Gaiman doing this on purpose, though subtly twisting it?
Is Gaiman saying we should stop to smell the flowers, to see the magic in Life?
Is he saying that we should make a conscious effort to keep the magic - the wonder that a child feels for life - that thing that C.S. Lewis described as "joy", in our lives?
There's London Above‚Äïthat's where you lived‚Äïand then there's London Below‚Äïthe Underside‚Äïinhabited by the people who fell through the cracks in the world.
What if Earl‚Äôs Court is truly the court of an earl and the name of Angel station derives from a real angel?
The tube stations Earl‚Äôs Court, Angel and many others now carry new meanings.In the end, Neverwhere is a very enjoyable, but largely unimpressive book.
Not many people see this as a favourite among Gaiman‚Äôs works, but it‚Äôs a good book that I‚Äôd recommend to anyone who has been to London.
Neil Gaiman‚Äôs Neverwhere is an immersive experience in a dark and fantastical place called London Below.
Our protagonist, Richard Mayhew, steps out of his daily life by helping a girl who is bleeding on the sidewalk.
With this action, his old life in London Above (the world we know) ends.
This old life exists side by side (or above) his new one; however, former colleagues and friends in this world no longer see/recognize him.
I enjoyed Neverwhere, but I didn‚Äôt feel as connected to it as I wanted to be until the protagonist became more involved in his own fate.
