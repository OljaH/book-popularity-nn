And as much as I think I can’t do justice to it, words might convey what the five stars can’t: explain why exactly I came to love this.The Chronicles of Lymond had a very rough start for me, very rough; not so much for the usual reasons as for the protagonist character himself, and I was highly sceptical of the day I’d adore the series ever arriving.
Forward to the review, bos’n.When the book opens, we see him through the unsentimental point of view of Philippa Somerville, the girl that hated him for long, and the circumstances are so deceptively decadent that we’re ready once more to place Lymond back so neatly in his little incurable rake box: he’s gambling at a bathhouse with a dubious personage .
He is joined in the role of revealing Lymond's character indirectly by Phillipa Somerville, very young but now exactly naive, a practical no-nonsense girl that stubbornly goes her own way, and provides some of the lighter, wittier conversations in the novel: 'It seems to me,’ said Philippa prosaically, ‘that on the whole we run more risks with Mr Crawford’s protection than without it.' Another recurring theme is the murder mystery, investigative angle, as some of the new characters have hidden agendas and one, a traitor in their midsts, is actually sabotaging the whole endeavour.
I know if I ever get to visit / revisit myself some of these places, I would look for the shadows of Francis Crawford of Lymond and of his companions.Book five coming up soon!["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>
Holy cow! RTC
11/17/10 I'm adding this bit from a blog post that was lifted by someone else in a yahoo group devoted to Dorothy Dunnett because it so much says how I feel/felt about these boooks: Unfortunately the 'lifter' didn't give a source so I can't either.
But anyone who grows to know and love Francis Crawford of Lymond will be able to relate.“It’s a good thing she’s dead.” It was my friend Nora on the phone.
Just “It’s a good thing she’s dead, or I’d kill her.”I’d bugged Nora to read the Lymond Chronicles, raving that it was the most intense reading experience of my life.
SO UPSETTING.
Every book I think it can't possibly get worse and then it DOES.
And every book I think I can't possibly love this book series more and I do.
I think it's been years since a book has made my cry uncontrollably like I did reading this one.
The plot is crazy as usual and this book, like the third, was action packed pretty much from start to finish.
All the characters are so well drawn and developed and feel so much like real people.
But I feel like starting it now.
SO GOOD AND YET SO UPSETTING.
EXTREMELY LENGTHY THOUGHTS TO COME LATER.Edit the second:I could not stop reading this book.
Stayed up until 4 am on a weeknight again, then proceeded during the next day to read it in the bathroom, over a breakfast of oatmeal, and in the car, while waiting for traffic lights to turn green.
Gorrrrrrrgeous, mind-expanding writing: yes!
Main character, through no small devising of his own, WRITHING IN HELLISH AGONY (and if you read this series you will understand why this is a source of jolly good fun rather than an indication of my own severely unbalanced mental state): check.
I have NEVER read poetry so obscure that Googling it doesn't turn up at all. I can now paraphrase the Koran's injunctions on left-handed people, recite the names and succession of upto ten of the 16th century Grand Masters of the Hospitaller Knights, use the word 'corybantic' in conversation, and probably even play a little bit of chess. And for all that, my god, the book still took my heart out and ate it. I hate Lymond. HATE him. Oh Jerott Blyth, I love you, though.
Pawn in Frankincense opens up shortly after the end of The Disorderly Knights, as Jerrott and Philippa track down Lymond on his search to find Francis' child, stolen by renegade Knight Graham Reed Malett and hidden somewhere in the heart of the Ottoman Empire.
This book is filled with non-stop action and suspense and ends with quite a big surprise of a cliffhanger which will send the reader reaching for the next book in the series, The Ringed Castle (Lymond Chronicles, 5).
And she's not even a grown-up yet as that novel ends!In Pawn in Frankincense, she is still quite young* but that doesn't stop her doing exactly what she wants, which in this case is to take off in search of Lymond that she might continue to make up for her earlier bad opinion of him by helping him in his current quest in a way that, she has decided, only she can.
And also weirdly satisfying in a way I totally did not see coming.I now already want to go back to the first book and read all these again -- and I'm not even finished with the series!The blurb for the next Lymond novel, The Ringed Castle, indicates that his next adventure is largely in Russia.
I'm going to breeze past the ever-sexy brand of Orientalism, the through-line of drugs, and the beautiful and telling descriptive language Dunnett employs.Is this entire series about a man learning, at long last, how to have friends and family?
I couldn't help feeling that he fell for the wrong people, possibly even misplacing his trust.) I even developed a hashtag for it, like you do, based on the phrase that Facebook status generator coined for me: #jerottblythstudies I dog-eared page after page, building a case for...what?
They're more likely to cry at anything--happiness, sadness--because they can extrapolate and recognize either how random or how rare those circumstances were.So I was never going to be able to track Jerott Blyth.
Of course, there are plenty of enigmas, traps, and red herrings along the way, before everyone finally ends up in Istabul (Byzantium, Constantinople, or Stamboul, depending on where and when you are in the book.)This features one of the best exchanges between Lymond and young Philippa (Lymond: "The coast is a jungle of Moors, Turks, Jews, renegades from all over Europe, sitting in places built from the sale of Christian slaves.
Plus, it features Philippa taking a course in Running to Seed, and a death scene that ties only with the one in Lions of Al-Rassan for the most likely to break your heart.
On the walk from the bus stop to my building I actually told myself I had to be as strong as Philippa / Marthe, and I held my head up high with watery eyes and braved the five-minute walk without having to stop and cry.
Dorothy has created a handful of the strongest female characters that I have ever encountered in fiction, and Phillippa is our strong little pre-teen/teenager (who ends up proving herself beyond anything I would have imagined).
We also get Mikal, as one of my new favorite minor characters!In conclusion: Lymond’s parent(s) were fucking around, what will Kate say when Phillippa comes home bahhhh, and will Marthe actually be kind to Jerott??
If you haven't read them yet then don't read this – or any other review – There will be spoilers.At the end of 'disorderly knights' Philippa prevents Lymond from killing Gabriel in order to spare the life of a child, Gabriel escapes in the confusion and lures Lymond onto the depths of the Ottoman empire.It is no problem for the gloriously feisty Philippa to convince first Jerott and then Lymond that they really need to take a 14-year-old girl along as they try to resolve the problems that she has caused.Jerott is a man who needs leader he can worship like a god.
Definitely the most readable of the Dunnett books so far, but what an emotional roller-coaster.
I got kind of fed up at the end of Lymond's complete lack of resource against his enemy...
I love the way she gets to mature, and blossom, and manages to be heroic while maintaining her own femininity and character (and, despite the seraglio and the marriage, even her virginity!!!).
I kind of toyed with the idea myself while reading, but never imagined Dunnett would entertain it as well--nay, even EFFECT it by the end of the book.
Lymond...
These books just keep getting better!Heartbroken and devastated by the evil and impossible decisions Lymond has to make while trying to save many lives, not least his son.
Dunnett hits us through all the senses with stunning descriptions and historical accuracy.This time Lymond doesn't control all the pieces on the chess board, least of all the pawns.
Dunnett kills off more than a few established characters in this book and being so divested I was devastated.
This is a much more personal story compared to previous novels and not only for Lymond's character.Emotional doesn't even begin to describe how I feel after that ending!
As the tension mounted to what I still consider, nearly half a century later, the most electrifying scene I have ever read, I was startled to realize my hands were sore from gripping the book so tightly.The Lymond Chronicles are a staggering achievement by a towering intellect that will never be surpassed. The greatest historical fiction ever.
As other reviewers have mentioned, a 5 star rating feels inadequate.
At this point, I'm certain this is the best fiction series I have read.
Ripping story.
The historical elements are meticulously researched, yet woven into the stories perfectly.
The books get rave reviews from virtually all readers.
Many reviewers mention reading the series multiple times.
I recommend these books for anyone who enjoys fiction.
If you are considering starting the series, try to do so when you have some time to read.
I assure you, you will not put these books down and go to sleep at a reasonable hour.I am eternally grateful to goodreads reviewer extraordinaire, Lightreads, for bringing these novels to my attention.
Still one of the most emotionally devastating and beautifully written novels I have ever read. There are a couple of scenes in here, that still, a dozen years and three re-reads later, make me sob like a baby. (If you've ever wondered what an ichneumon is - a kind of mongoose - or what 16 century Constantinople looked like, you'll satisfy those cravings with this book too. Did I mention how beautifully written it is?)And Lymond … he is at his most human in this one, vulnerable, lovable and self-sacrificing to an extraordinary degree.
Fourth book in the series of the wonderful Lymond Chronicles. In this action packed adventure Francis Lymond and his entourage (for want of a better word) find themselves in the heart of the Ottoman empire on the trail of Lymond's arch nemesis, the wonderfully sinister and machiavellian Graham Reid Mallet.Another convoluted and compelling plot, in the hands of a masterful storyteller. Well worth a look.
Or: the one where it gets real gay.Also, separately: real scary.Before rereading it, I had four main memories from this book:1) Lymond finally revealing his age.2) Marthe explaining to Jerott that it's not her that he truly wants.3) Oonagh in the garden.4) That fucking chess game.I forgot precisely when these things occurred -- quite a bit more book happens after #4, for example, than I recalled, and Dunnett drops #3 on page 62.
This is the best thing I read all...whatever year that was.
I've read many climactic sequences in novels which have made me feel tense or anxious, but none which made me feel physically ill, as happened in this case: that long, intense rollercoaster of a buildup to a denouement, which, well.
Let's just say that even though I finished the book hours ago, I still cannot think about it too closely--it's much too raw.I do not want to say too much about this, because I want many people to read this book, and I want them to do so unspoiled.
This is shooting right to the top of the list as one of the best books I have ever read
A perfect, horrible book.(Anyone who's read it knows exactly what I mean.
It's completely readable and enticing down through the part where your nails are digging holes in your palms.I meant to say something about Lymond and point of view, and I'd forgotten that this book barely ever gets into his head either: the dreadful climax is seen from Jerott's perspective.
However, I think the series suffers somewhat from keeping the reader away from Lymond's thoughts.
But I'll think that over some more as I read the last two.)
Now this is the best so far in the series. We have Lymond growing into a real, caring fellow who uses his best intellectual gifts to save as many of his friends, including his 2? children, as possible. Very emotional ending. We now really like him. Dunnett creates the mystic, etheral characters, mostly women, who seem to keep circling into Lymond's life in unusual ways. Are they real? Are they spiritualists? Are they relatives? Are they really guiding his life? A neat little mystery that keeps you reading. The terrible villain finally, finally, is done away with. Hoorah!
This book introduces Phillippa, girl adventurer, determined to make up for her past bad behavior by finding Lymond's lost child. However, she is joined by some of the regular cast and a new character, a mysterious woman who is disturbingly similar to Lymond. The entire book is a game as the cast dashes from exotic destination to the next, unsure if they are the pursuer or being toyed with. Lymond is finally faced with a horrific choice and is it unclear if he will be able to recover.
My favourite of the Lymond books in which Phillippa takes centre stage.
Perhaps, then, it is not a coincidence that I was recommended onto this series by disgruntled followers of GRRM, who assured me that HERE was a book series with many of the same attractions, but which we can read assured that the last book is already published.
Without naming names, and my count may be wrong, I believe no fewer than FOUR major characters, some having been well-established in previous series entries, are killed in this book.
Wikipedia at least warns that while 1 & 2 are more or less standalone entries in the series, 3-4 are tied together as well as 5-6.
Decidedly.The mystery: (view spoiler)[TALK BY DOROTHY DUNNETTSaturday, 30 March 1990One of the anxieties everybody has about Pawn in Frankincense is the identity (Thank you, Judith) of the two children and especially the child who died.
I was defiant I make it clear, I may say, when I was writing Pawn in Frankincense.
By then I thought: Yes, let me, I think, made it clear.
If I haven't, I'm not making it any clearer.The whole of the Lymond series is about identity; it is about character; it is about heritage; and, yes, it is about the future.
This is my second time through the Lymond Chronicles.
I read them for the first time about a decade previous.
So it's been a joy to reread them and fall in love with Lymond all over again.
So if you come to the end of this book and feel that Lymond has become something of an anti-hero; well,that's understandable.
As always with Dunnett, the novel is extremely well researched and well written.
Phillippa comes into her own in this novel and proves a reliable and stalwart friend.
Love Dorothy Dunnett.
She's one of the few authors who continuously surprises me!
Every time it looked like something might work out, a betrayal or other mishap masterminded by the eeeeeevil Gabriel gummed up the works.
I got so frustrated I actually put the book down for a couple of weeks.Returning, however, was a fresh joy, as I had picked up books by lesser writers in the intervening time and was amazed all over again by Dunnett's writing skills.
Also, my heart is so broken by some of the things that happened (all because of eeeeeevil Gabriel) that I need some time to lick my wounds before moving on to the next world setting!
Ms. Dunnett far outstripped the first three books in the series with this one in terms of both quality and plot.Far from being a superbly-crafted adventurous romp with surprising depth and emotional weight, as the three previous novels were, Pawn in Frankincense is a much more internal novel.
I've heard the books continue to improve in quality, but I am not sure how Ms. Dunnett will manage to top Pawn in Frankincense.
