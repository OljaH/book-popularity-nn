Described as 'the best" of Clark Ashton Smith, these stories vary in quality.
Those with a contemporary setting--like the title story--are typical examples of pulp fiction, only distinguished by a latinate vocabulary even more bizarre than Lovecraft's.
However, in his best work, Smith creates credible worlds--ancient Hyperborea, the planet Zothique, the mythical medieval French province of Averroigne--where his dark vision of sorcery and his eccentric vocabulary unite with an elegant flow of incantatory language to produce stories which are powerful and unique.
Clark Ashton Smith was a person of many talents: he was a poet, sculptor, painter, composer; he also happened to be a writer whose writings remind those of his colleague and friend H.P. Lovecraft.
This is a collection of his short stories and novellas subtitled "The Best of Clark Ashton Smith".
While the collection contains stories with elements of fantasy, science fiction, drama, even humor - all of them are essentially horror stories.
Its influence - direct of otherwise - can be seen in a classic science fiction movie "Alien" and other books and movies with similar plots.
I'm just going to mention my favorites in this short story collection.The Return of the Sorcerer - I can appreciate that this came before some of my favorite horror films, Evil Dead, Lord of Illusions, but I'm stunned to see how many themes and tropes have carried over the years to be embedded so firmly in our horrific psyche.
Pretty decent, and even rather modern in flavor, so I'm rather surprised that it came out so long ago.They ARE very hammy, though, and quite amusingly so, but nothing more deep than, say, a D&D game or one of those EVIL B-Movies of yore.

I would have to distinguish the collection versus the material inside.Smith's writing is frequently over-lush, littered with ten-dollar words of dubious necessity, and beset by a curious passivity.
Plot and character become little more than scaffolding for Smith to work his word magic and express his imagery or setting.
It can be an impressive effect but too much at once--binging a collection, for instance, dilutes the experience.
The "best of" selection is presumably according to Weinberg's own taste, and his curation is odd, being neither chronological by publication nor grouped by setting or theme.
I mean stories not of a sorcerer in a far away land, but of a man, living in a town who has an encounter with the unnatural.The Return of the Sorcerer - A good, grotesque weird tale, somewhat predictable for someone who has read a lot of horror fiction perhaps but still an excellent story.
The City of the Singing Flame - Good story in the dark fantasy/weird vein, feels like one of Lovecraft's fantasy world stories.

One of the best single-author collections I've ever read, and a wonderful introduction to Clark Ashton Smith.
CAS is simply one of the most talented writers I've had the pleasure of reading.
This book took me over a month to read simply because I didn't want it to be over!
All of this collection was great, a few of my favorite stories are "The Dark Eidolon", "The Isle of the Torturers", "The Seven Geases", and "The Monster of the Prophecy".
I recommend this collection to any CAS newbies, fans of horror, scifi, and fantasy, or anyone that enjoys a great short story.
Here are a group of stories by an overlooked master of the science fiction, fantasy and horror fields.First published in the 1930s, the unearthly beings in these stories are not just denizens of Hell; they come from someplace worse than Hell.
Some of these stories take place in the present day.
Other stories take place in the distant past, in an era of amazing cities.
For those who are fantasy or horror fans, and have never read Clark Ashton Smith, you are in for a huge treat.
They generally fall into a few categories: “modern” pulp horror (generally pretty good for the period, including the title story, a grisly tale of zombie revenge, and “The Hunters From Beyond”), science fiction (maybe this stuff seemed slick in the early 30’s, but not too good now – although I did like “The Vaults of Yoh-Vomis” which was really more horror than SF, featuring a truly gruesome alien monster), “swords and sorcery”-type fantasy stories (generally adequate – I enjoyed the faerie tale feel that Smith brought to “The Seven Geases”), and several supernatural tales set in medieval France (also decent for the period).
This is a solid mix of pulp stories, mostly fun quick reads.
An excellent book of short stories, and great introduction to the literary prose of Clark Ashton Smith.
I compare the short stories especially to the work of Vance in that while there are a few perfect gems, most of these stories have a scratch, chip, or other imperfection that somehow does not diminish the unique, entertaining experience.
My one recommendation for anyone reading this book for the first time (and perhaps this being an introduction to CAS), is leave the first story for last, which is the title story of the book.
Four stars if you are a fan of classic pulp fantasy -- Lovecraft, Howard, Moore, etc.
-- or a fan of contemporary authors like Moorcock and Glen Cook.
The Zothique stories clearly inspired Elric, among others, and Smith's overall style seems to have influenced every heroic fantasy writer that I've read (so far), including Fritz Leiber.
The horror stories included didn't do much for me, but there are only a few of those; they read like practice sessions for the later work.
I would like to read the other stories set in Hyperborea, Averoigne, and Zothique, and hope that other collections become available.
Clark Ashton Smith is one of the authors I consider part of the Golden Age of Weird Tales. I picked up this collection at World Fantasy, having wanted for a while to read more of Smith's stories. As with many works from that era, this collection left me with mixed feelings. There are moments of sheer bloody brilliance, but as with Lovecraft, the language often feels overwrought and forced, and there are elements of racism and misogyny that are hard to miss. A mixed bag, with "The Enchantress of Sylaire," which closes out the book, being my favorite.
I somehow managed to make it this long without reading any Clark Ashton Smith. The recent reprints reminded me that he's the only one of the Weird Tales greats that I've never read. Now I'm sorry that I waited this long. Smith is unequal parts Lovecraft, Rimbaud, and Vance, and much else besides. His stories are decadent, baroque, finely wrought, and very weird. He has a sense of humor like a poisoned dagger. I'd love to read what he would have wrote without the limitations of the pulps, and I covet the Night Shade Books reprint collections.
Great stories in a sort of disjointed collection. If I'd been putting the collection together, I think I would have grouped the stories in the same cycle together, or perhaps focused on the stories more like the title story instead of showing the whole breadth of Smith's work. I'd read most of the classic weird horror stories before (a big influence on Heroes of Horror), but was unfamiliar with Smith's more sci-fi-ish, mystical-hallucinatory material.
Would have given it 5 if the Averoigne stories weren't so predictable and boring. Loved the rest, especially Zothique. It seems like Clark Ahton Smith is the link in the chain from my second favorite author (HP Lovecraft) to my favorite (Jack Vance) and I am saddened that I did not bother to read his work before now.
"The Dark Eidolon" is a bleak tale of revenge, and as with many of the stories set in the world of Zothique, most characters are responsible for or victim to great suffering, in a way that should be comically absurd - but perhaps the language, only as direct as necessary, helps to soften the blow.
The bleakness and strangeness of tales like these are nicely balanced with others somewhat more satirical, particularly the glee with which Smith depicts men of faith being seduced or tempted by dark women.A few stories really do feel like a slog to get through, and one short novella is a fun ride that is totally underwhelmed by its ending.
But overall this collection is strong and worth a read.
I can't believe I missed out on CAS years ago when I discovered Lovecraft, or earlier when I was reading Howard. Some of the stories are only ok, but some are phenomenal. I had to keep stopping to highlight passages to use as descriptions in RPGs. For some reason Gene Wolfe's intro caught my eye as well. I feel like I should give The Book of the New Sun another chance.
A must for any fan of cosmic horror! A contemporary of HPL and REH, Smith has the same florid, creepy style. Well worth the read!
Ами тъпо е, но проблемът не е в едно симпатично момче с хъски поглед и странен глас, което просто се забавлява, а в това, че все повече се отказваме да фантазираме, да мечтаем, да сънуваме кошмари и да излизаме по-силни от подсъзнанията си, щото не било модерно, разбираш ли.
А едно време…Едно време, дето не е нашето време, в страна, която не е също нашата, и може би слава на вселената за което, между две войни, а и около , преди и по време на тях, в Хамериката твори великата тройка на тъмната фантазия, на която всеки съвременен блокбъстър фентъзи писател може само да им носи чехлите в устица – Лъвкрафт, Хауърд и Смит.
It seems to collect examples of all of Smith's types of writing, including his horror, and unfortunately, his science fiction and fantasy.
The horror stories in the collection are easily the best.
It's when Smith writes fantasy that this collection is at is weakest, and unfortunately those stories make up most of "The Return of the Sorcerer." People often joke about how bad Lovecraft's dream cycle stories are, and Smith's suffer from many of the same problems.
The horror stories in this collection are all worth reading, but maybe seek them out individually or in a more horror-centric collection rather than wading through the long slogs that are the fantasy stories.
Smith has no business in being careful and sacerdotal in his script ��� it is a central honesty to remember that he was writing predominantly for the pulps; those who seek precise craftsmanship are encouraged to look for his poetry.
If any of these writings fail, it is not because of any self-reproof or extenuation on the author���s part, but rather a symptom of the times ��� we're conditioned to believe that exclusiveness in literature is something insane, and where Smith picks up, there really is a bit of an insular quarry.
The story follows a man who is hired by a wealthy old antiquary to translate some Arabic for him...
Lovecraft had written his "History of the Necronomicon" (a mock history of the fictional tome) in 1927 and Smith was inspired by it.
The History mentions that the original Arabic Necronomicon (or Al Azif) surfacing in San Francisco before being destroyed in a fire.
Smith's story takes place in San Francisco but doesn't describe a fire thus leaving room for following stories.
The story also notes that the Arabic text is more complete then the Latin translation of Olaus Wormius.
The thing I enjoyed the most about this book was the style in which it was written.
I annoyed my wife several times by reading some of the more beautiful sentences aloud.The stories were fun, very creative old-timey sci-fi/fantasy.
Of the short stories, only a few could be called eerie, and they failed to really set the creepy, ominous mood of Lovecraft (though the lack of blatant racism was an improvement!).
I was amused by the weirdo endings of some of them, but towards the end of the book the constant need for an unexpected twist ending was a little wearying.
There's no denying CAS is a great writer; he has that same viscous quality of prose that his contemporaries Lovecraft and Howard have, the kind of phrasing that thrills the mind to read.
I confess; I skipped a few of the stories, unable to slog through that slurry of prose for characters I didn't care about and worlds that were so oblique and bizarre I couldn't puncture them.
The Zothique stories were the highlight, for me, and those're the ones I'll probably seek out of his.
I read this collection out of my Lovecraft interest, because this fellow (along with Robert Howard) was closely connected to Lovecraft and shared his "Weird Tales" style.
That connection was the only thing that got me through more than three of these stories.
Very few of his stories have any real point or climax to them, and they often seem to end like fairy tales or myths -- "And then everyone died because that's fate."Let me also say a word about his prose -- I've read fan fiction with prose less purple.
He used the adjective "lepidopteran" three times in one story.

Clark Ashton Smith is a contemporary of H. P. Lovecraft and one of the men who helped shape supernatural horror fiction. Smith's style differs from Lovecraft's in that while many of the characters in his stories are doomed, Smith portrays their situation, their surroundings in a mesmerizing, enchanted mood. Furthermore, Smith is also very open about sexuality, though by our standards today his writing might seem tame, this was the 20's & 30's after all.This book is definitely worth a read if you are looking for something scary, but not too scary.
This is a collection of short stories. The genre is mostly horror with a mix of fantasy/horror. They were all written in the 1930's mostly for pulp magazines. All the stories are well written with a distinctive and enjoyable style. Some of the stories are very good, but others suffer from weak plots. The lead story "The Return of the Sorcerer" is very good and well worth reading. It should appeal to fans of H. P. Lovecraft. I also recommend "The Vaults of Yoh-Vombis", "The Hunters from Beyond", "the Devotee of Evil" and "The Double Shadow".
Clark Ashton Smith is a true master. These stories range from straight fantasy to space bound science fiction to modern day (for him) horror. See how many Lovecraft references you can pick up that he purposely leaves behind like easter eggs. Seriously, though, if you want to understand where today's authors got their ideas, C.A. Smith is one place to look.
