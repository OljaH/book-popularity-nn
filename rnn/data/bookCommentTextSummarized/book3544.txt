This is a really helpful book for everyone interested in anthroposophy and Rudolf Steiner's teachings. It show the background and life of one of the leading thinkers of mankind and helps in understanding his genius.
It is so long for what it is. I'm glad I finished it.I recognize it as a good enough book. I'm glad I've been exposed to it, but it will never be one of my favorites.
I helped me a great deal to see how Steiner came to his ideas. I will study his work in a different way now.
