Steve Jobs was a damn dirty hippie.
In fact he was quite odd and obsessive about his diets, he would go on kicks where he would eat nothing but carrots for long periods of time until he turned orange.
I seriously don't know how anything got finished, I really don't.Steve Jobs was a super genius.Despite of (or because of) all this he created the most amazing things.
I love my Ipod and my Ipad.
I'm very attached, I don't want to live without them.
Thank you Steve for being a damn dirty hippie, asshat super genius.
I believe that Isaacson presents a realistic picture of Jobs that includes both the positive and negative sides to his personality.
However, he does tend to justify Jobs' obnoxious behavior and negative personality traits by reminding the reader that these behaviors and traits also led him to do great things, and achieve the impossible.
I would recommend this book to anyone who is a fan of Steve Jobs, Apple, or is interested in particularly influential people.
I would not recommend this biography to Apple haters or Steve Jobs haters due to Isaacson's apologetic presentation of Jobs' negative traits, nor would I recommend it to fans who would rather remember an idealized version of Jobs.
I am sure that what she writes in her book The Bite in the Apple: A Memoir of My Life with Steve Jobs is absolutely true.
Jobs great achievement was to marry an uncompromisingly zen creativity to electronically-advanced products when all around built boxes.
I went to dinner on a 93' yacht with a chef, hostess and a couple of crew and the captain gave me an iPad for a present.
one and I was too cool not to have a Mac :-) This is true ;-).
He asked me how I liked the ipad and I said great and went to get it out of my bag.
Steve Jobs pushed everybody until they wanted to kill him, but the pushing yielded amazing, brilliant new products.
Be really, really good at something.---Things can turn around if you persevere, but don't be afraid to walk away.Unbending to the end, even the prospect of death didn't soften him up much, but he brought me up short on the last page of the book, because I am obsessed with the same question:"I like to think that something survives after you die.
So I really want to believe that something survives, and that maybe your consciousness endures." I closed the book with a bit more compassion for this difficult man and went outside to pick cilantro for that night's dinner.
so, we are having the event for this book at our store tonight. the number of people calling up to ask if steve jobs will also be present to sign is staggering. in other words, "i care enough about steve jobs to want to read a 600+ page book about him, but i am somehow unaware that he is deceased."is what i hope. the alternative is ghoulish and i do not want to entertain it.
Steve Jobs, Walter Isaacson تاریخ نخستین خوانش: روز یازدهم ماه سپتامبر سال 2016 میلادیعنوان: استیو جابز - زندگینامه استیو جابز موسس و مدیرعامل شرکت اپل؛ نویسنده: والتر ایساکسون؛ مترجم: مهدی پاکنهاد؛ تهران، ستایش، 1390، در 703 ص؛ شابک: 9786005184419؛ موضوع: سرگذشتنامه استیو جابز از 1955 تا 2011 م - قرن 21 ماین دل میخواست کاش سرگذشتنامه ی ایشان را خود مینوشتم؛ اسطوره بودند، شاید آنگاه واژه هایم را میتوانستم با عطر گلهای سرخ نیز بیامیزم، و با آوای بلبل آجین میکردم، تا همیشه خوشبوی و شنیدنی باشند، از نخستین سالهای 1980 میلادی با نمونه کارهای سخت افزار، و سیستم عامل ایشان برای نخستین کامپیوترهای شخصی، یا همان پرسنل کامپیوتر اپل مکینتاش، و نرم افزارهای طراحی شده ی ایشان آشنا بودم؛ از همان روز نخست آشنایی، نیز برایم آسمانی بودند، آسمانی آسمانی.
روانشان همیشه و هماره شادمان.
Isaacson has truly done a wonderful job with this book.
Besides, it will probably make you buy and read the whole thing anyway.To call this man a "Great Marketer" is probably a great disservice to him and Steve would probably have had a fit about that.
This is probably a difficult idea to get to grips with, but is essential too.I hope every Management Guru and CEO is studying this book and drawing the right lessons.
But, Jobs' philosophy on running companies and driving innovation is the best in the modern age and should be copied shamelessly, if not their product features (I am looking at you Samsung).
The drama of this biography is in the decisions Jobs made, the way he followed through on these ideals.
Read the book.
In the same way that you understand a proverb much more after you've had a life a experience that demonstrates it, these will mean much, much more when you see them in the context of Steve Jobs' life.Plus, you'll also discover Jobs' equally as compelling character traits: from his idealism to his irascibility.
So naturally I view all dope-gorging smelly long hair Dylan-worshiping hippies with a certain amount of suspicion and disdain.The author shows, on a page-by-page basis, what an insufferable asshole Steve Jobs was.
But the book left me wondering: why?
how did he become this way?The book is fairly well researched, but except for a precious few anecdotes about his youth, very little is said about his upbringing.
The book says NOTHING about the adopted sister he grew up with.
To me the lack of insight into his teen and pre-teen life leaves a glaring hole in understanding the man.My opinion of Steve Jobs: The ends don't justify the means.
If I learned anything from this book, it's that Apple believed that design is paramount, and spending extra time and engineering resources to make a beautiful design work is worth it.Apple's design philosophy is to "make it simple.
I also loved the story of how Steve was obsessed with quality glass, and ordered the highest end stuff he could find for his Apple Stores.Steve's management tactics got a lot of scrutiny in the book - and many other reviewers use words like "jerk" to describe him.
When Jobs came back to Apple from his hiatus the biggest innovation he made was to focus the company onto just the few products that were working or had potential.
I downloaded the e-book on my iPad (quite fitting) Sun. night and stayed up until the very wee hours reading (on a work night, no less).
Isaacson's writing style is very engaging and, at least so far, he seems to be embarking on a no holds barred, honest portrayal of this very admired, feared, respected, despised, controversial titan of industry.
As a college senior in '85, watching the iconic "1984" commercial, reading all about SJ & Woz and how they wanted to "change the world", I made it my mission to work at this amazing company.
A master, bar none!
I had to be convinced by a GR friend to read this book, similarly to how Isaacson had to be convinced to write it.Back in 2004, Steve Jobs approached Isaacson and asked if he was interested in writing Jobs' biography.
Second, I am not a techie, and while I like and use Apple products every day, I was hesitant to spend my precious reading time on a tech book.
Despite my hesitation, I ended up enjoying the stories of how Jobs got his start in computers, and how he met and started collaborating with Steve Wozniak, and the evolution of products at Apple over the decades.
May I suggest:Steve Jobs: Unrelenting Narcissist, Suspected Sociopath and Giant Fucking AssholeIsaacson writes a great biography: He tells a coherent, cohesive story, he interviews all the players and most important he doesn't feel the need to hoist his subject on a pedestal with his pen.
If a person could not - or could no longer - provide a benefit to Jobs, he would cast them aside...but not before cruelly shitting mounds of aggression and abuse all over their bare heads.
What was so unique about Jobs was that he was a creative person who also had the power to bring a progressive product to life.
Apple also went through a period of time when Jobs was too radical for a board of directors who wanted to make Apple more like other companies.
After reading this biography, I know now that Jobs deserved to be ousted, and what a great occurrence for the world because Pixar would have never been created.
I liked Steve Jobs more before reading this biography.
Well, The mighty Steve Jobs that we have so much to learn from.You can see the Full review here.The bookWalter Isaacson the author is a well-know writer (Einstein, Franklin are his other biography books) has covered all the aspects of Job's life from his childhood, family, friends, to founding apple with Wozniak, each product design (Macintosh, iphone etc.) and venture (Next, Pixar) he conveyed.
The book has benefited a lot from articulation of Walter Isaacson and the content are precise with rich details as he has interviewed all the people he's named in the book as well as Steve Job.The best thing about reading biographies and the very reason why I love biographies is the lessons you can learn from the bests.
I keep flipflopping between annoyed/disgusted and inspired.I applaud Isaacson for putting a masterful bio together without succumbing to the Reality Distortion Field and vomiting out a piece of Jobs-worship like some Apple/Steve-related books out there.
Tomorrow, I will probably feel bad about this review and feel more inspired by the positive aspects of this bio to push myself harder to work better and to do what is right, like Steve would have done.
Short, simple but beautiful, and more importantly, shows me another side of Steve that is more like the person I thought he was before I read the bio.
Bulgarian review below/Ревюто на български е по-долу “Life can only be understood backwards; but it must be lived forwards”, Kierkegaard said. Steve Jobs managed to live even further ahead of his time and pulled a whole world along with him – that of information technology.No one can accuse Jobs of indiscriminate philanthropy. In any kind of philanthropy in fact. Nor in unmotivated generosity. Thinking about it, I understand from what I read that he didn’t sway towards reasonable generosity eit
In any case, he lived a much fuller life than most people.Steve, wherever you are now, don’t forget – “Park different”.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Животът, казва Киркегор, може да бъде разбран само като се обърнеш назад, но се живее напред.
Малко мазохистично наистина, но пък щом действа… Каже ли ти Стив Джобс, че иска да цвят, който не съществува, че трябва всички компоненти да са идеални, нищо, че никой никога няма да ги види и че софтуерът ще върви само с хардуера и това е, ако ще светът да се сгромоляса, ами… правиш го.
ستيف جوبز شاهدت قبل أيام فيلم (Steve Jobs) لداني بويل، والذي لعب فيه مايكل فاسبندر دور جوبز، يعتمد الفيلم الرائع على السيرة الذاتية التي كتبها والتر ايزاكسون بطلب من جوبز نفسه، ولكن يركز الفيلم شخصية جوبز وصراعاته ويتجاهل بقية التفاصيل، فلذا من الأفضل قراءة الكتاب قبل مشاهدة الفيلم، وهو عكس ما فعلته، فقد شاهدت الفيلم مفترضاً معرفتي بتفاصيل حياة جوبز ومسيرته، وحالما فرغت قررت أنني احتاج بعض التوضيحات لهذا بدأت بقراءة الكتاب الذي كنت أؤجله منذ صدوره.
ذهلت كثيرا عند قراءتي لسيرته.لأسباب عديدةكان كتاب طويلاومليء بالمواقف المهمة والأخرى الغير مهمة، والأخرى التي تفضح لك شخصية ستيف بدون أي محسناتذهللت كثيرا من الصراحة التامة ، وظهور ستيف جوبز كما هو، بدون تلميع للصورة وبدون أي تبجيل لشخصه، بل على العكس تماما.
لكني رغم هذا لم أشعر بقطرة إلهام.وهذا ماجعل السيرة بالنسبة لي غير استثنائية على الإطلاق.والتر كاتب رائع، الجمل سلسلة وقابلة للفهم بكل سولة، لم أواجه أي صعوبة ولم أحتاج لدكشنري وأنا أقرأ.كانت سيرة متكاملة ومكتوبة جيدا، سيرة صريحة لرجل سيبقى في أذهاننا طويلا.
Update: I 'did' read this a ways back - my friend gave me her book when done--her husband is still living - a Survivor of pancreatic cancer!
Nobody has made a bigger difference in the quality of people's lives, in my lifetime, than Steve Jobs.
He was the visionary leader in our lifetime that made the biggest difference to the most amount of people.OLD NEWS:I'm not sure when I'll read this book ---(I've got others to read first)---but my friend has pancreatic cancer ---(the SAME TYPE as Steve Jobs).
Starting this soon.
I think Henry Ford once said, "If I'd asked customers what they wanted, they would have told me, 'A faster horse!'" People don't know what they want until you show it to them."- Walter Isaacson, Steve Jobs🍁Steve Jobs: The Exclusive Biography is a definitive portrait of Steve Jobs, one who is considered to be one of the greatest innovators of the history.
Isaacson portrays the various shades of Job in all its forms, black, white and grey.Having read a bit about the Apple's co-founder, I did know about how big a visionary and genius Steve Jobs was.
His tendency to cry makes me wish I--as technically inept as Jobs himself--could bully someone cleverer than I into building a time machine, so I could use it to go back in time and beat the crap out of Steve Jobs.He fucked over Woz.He continually told people that they were shit.He was duped by John Sculley.He held people in contempt when they didn't behave like assholes.He demanded that a machine in a factory be painted.
You'd be dead of alcohol poisoning by page 10 if you actually drank every time Isaacson reported an instance of Steve Jobs being an asshole.
No matter your answers, you *really* should read this book.
There is no way I think you can read this book and not just totally be in awe of Jobs.
His passion for APPLE.
I am not sure that I've ever read a book that showed a man with such passions.
I wish I had read this book years ago.
I wish I had been an APPLE fanatic years ago.
I wish everyone knew just what he did for APPLE.
Again, no matter what your feelings about the man or the company, this is a book worth reading.
In fact both seem foolishly simplistic given this rich, sweeping, detailed, and intimate depiction a truly remarkable man's life experience.What I learned about Steve Jobs is that he was very good at some things, and very bad at others.
What's remarkable about the life of Steve Jobs is how the psychoses and eccentricities of his personality, when channelled through his defining product genius, created the world's most valuable company.
But maybe there's a lesson for all of us in the story of a man who brought some beauty into the world not just because of the gifts that made him a genius, but because of the flaws and idiosyncrasies that made him a person.
Steve Jobs and Apple?
Someone I follow here at GR had recommended it, plus it had been sitting on a shelf in the library forever and I kept bumping into it.So, in spite of my reservations I took it out....and it rewarded me by flying in the face my prejudice.
Walter Isaacson is a superb writer, and in spite of the fact that Jobs was one of the most prickly and outspoken people on the planet - he has done a brilliant job in researching this abrasive genius.
And it turns out, after all, that that Steve Jobs was a genius.
I also want to read more books by Walter Isaacson.
Along with Steve the brilliant innovator who knew how to bring together an A-list team of loyal employees, we get Steve the rude man who will proclaim a product or food or wedding invitation as "shit" and then walk away with a clear conscience; Steve the man who has no qualms about crying in front of others if he doesn't get his way or is overburdened; Steve the selfish man who doesn't bother to remember birthdays or anniversaries; Steve the lousy father who denied fathering his first daughter for the first six years of her life, and who wasn't there much for his three children with Powell.
Steve explained that it was because he wanted his children to truly know their father, and I'm so glad that I got to know him, too.
Wonderfully and grippingly written Biographie....I consider it as a reading highlight for this year.
لم أشعر بالحزن حين مات ستيف جوبز، لكني استشعرت الفقد وفداحة الخسارة حين وصلت لنهاية هذه السيرة التي تستعرض حياة أحد أهم الشخصيات التي صنعت ملامح حياتنا المعاصرة.لقد كان جوبز شخصية فذة واستثنائية‘ في فهمه للحياة وفي فرضه لنمط من الإدارة والتصميم، في مجالات الحوسبة والاتصال والأفلام والموسيقى، تركت بصمة لا تمحى علينا جميعاً.تم تأليف هذه السيرة بتكليف من جوبز نفسه الذي عرف أن السرطان لن يمهله فأراد أن يترك لأبنائه.. وللعالم أيضاً وصفاً لحياته الحافلة القصيرة.أسلوب الكاتب رائع جداً وغير ممل بالرغم من كثافة المادة. تاريخ ممتع ومتشابك ومفيد. كانت تجربة ممتعة تماماً
Isaacson's book reads just like a Time Magazine.
How did Laurene put up with his behavior, and to what extent did she think it necessary to his accomplishments?
It's this depth and understanding, I feel, that matters: after all, aren't all of us reading this biography because we wish we could replicate Jobs's achievements, yearn to walk a vicarious mile in his shoes, wonder just how much it cost him?
Having finished the book, I'm left wondering whether I have trouble empathizing with Jobs because I simply can't understand his moral and rational framework—or because Isaacson's account is so frustratingly impersonal and shallow.
