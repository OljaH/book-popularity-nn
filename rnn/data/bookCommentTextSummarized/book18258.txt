Solid conclusion to the series! The final reveal/solution didn't quite pack the PUNCH I was expecting, but I did still thoroughly enjoy this trilogy. Overall, I'd give the series a 4.5 -- definitely recommended if you want a fast-paced, well-developed superhero/supervillain story with great characters and excellent world building. Brandon Sanderson continues to be one of my favorite authors of all time!I talk a bit more about the trilogy overall (spoiler-free!) in this video - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmRwb...
It didn’t feel consistent with the other books in which if a character made one wrong move, they would end up dead.
I’m not sure why this became such a major part of this book.
Why an author would try to put in such a complex idea, into the last book of an already short series, is beyond me.
Plot holes -There’s going to be major spoilers in my blocked out spoiler section, so I’m doubly warning you if you’ve not read the book yet: LOOK AWAY!

David is still a nerd doing nerd things and getting into situations but he always does things for the good.
And then there are some things about David and his father that just made me almost ugly cry.
Epics are not always bad .
Sooooo . . . This one . . . I had issues. LOTS of issues. Like a MULTITUDE of unanswered questions. Like the chaotic mess of the last 20%, followed by the way too easy (inevitable) demise of Bad Guy(s)--seriously, during one of them, Sanderson actually said, "just like that."JUST LIKE THAT. Do you guys want to hear that a HEP big Bad Guy was thwarted/overthrown/vanquished/etc. "just like that"?B/c I do NOT.BUT.Sanderson. So many, many good things as well. Full RTC.My other reviews for this series:
  Steelheart (The Reckoners, #1)

  Mitosis (The Reckoners, #1.5)

  Firefight (The Reckoners, #2)
[4.5 Stars]I must say, I very much enjoyed this book, but this is the first time I've read a Sanderson novel where I don't think everything made sense.

An Epic finale! This is the third and final novel in the book series “The Reckoners”. AN EVEN LARGER WORLD  Epics are strange, wonderful, and terrible all at once. Don’t let yourself get drawn in by that. It can lead you to… difficult places.

Calamity is a rollercoaster of surprises, where it’s hard to cope in the most of cases, since while the novel is astonishing developed, I am still unsure if I really aprove some of the twists that you find in the book.
So I've finally taken the leap & finished a Young Adult series by one of my favorite Adult Fantasy writers, and I must say I'm very pleased with the outcome of that risk.I've come to expect great things from Brandon Sanderson & once again I think he's delivered a gem of the genre.
How does this series compare to Sanderson's Adult High Fantasy works?
Which could be a good thing for those who struggled with the slow-paced, detailed storytelling of Sanderson's Adult works.Sanderson's forte may be Adult Fantasy, but at the core he is a skilled writer capable of creating great stories across genres.
His trilogies look like this: an excellent first book followed by unbelievably boring second partially due to a fact that he leaves the best characters behind or kills them.
The first book was an equivalent of a summer blockbuster movie (a good one, not recent generic superhero crap, or a reboot).It contained a very memorable first line, excellent characters, great action scenes, and David's awful metaphors.
We left a couple of interesting guys behind (I challenge anybody to call Tia - who prominently featured here - at least two-dimensional character and she is as one-dimensional as they come), there was a lot of talk and minimal action, and David' metaphors became stale.
This book is fast paced, and every time I finished a chapter I wanted to read the next one straight away.
Actually the only bad thing I can say about this book is it finished.
Now thing have gotten more complicated it turnes out both his mentor and the woman he loves are two of the most powerful Epics in the world.
Which both the woman he loves and his friend call him on every time.
If you like sci-fi, comics, or superheroes then this is the book (in fact the series) for you.
There will be heroes. Just wait.  I think this is one of those reviews where I’m going to make it quick: This series, these characters, this author are epic. Truly. I have loved every single minute of this series from beginning to end… Where we're from, there's no sun,Our hometown's in the dark,Where we're from, we're no one,Our hometown's in the dark,Our hometown's in the dark Twenty-one pilots song PERFECT for this series! :Pand I’m not going to tarnish something I’ve always enjoyed with lot
I think this is one of those reviews where I’m going to make it quick: This series, these characters, this author are epic.
It was good still, I mean, I wouldn’t have rated a four if it didn’t make me happy-but a four in an epic fantasy series by Sanderson?
I have to wonder if, in some weird sick way, Sanderson felt like he couldn’t do what needed to be done, in this genre, to make this story unforgettable.
I will always adore this series, especially books one and two, but I will always remember how the third left me needing and wanting an ending that just didn’t exist.
I mean, some low hanging fruit can be knocked off the tree by Tom Thumb, but Come On, can't you see that was too EASY?Seriously.
You betcha.Did sit excitedly through the entire tale, piecing together all the things that came before to make this come to a great end?
Yes. Yes I was.It's an easy tale that rides all our superhero expectations and toys with us in interesting ways, but most importantly, it always thinks through the ramifications of powers and weaknesses in such a nicely thorough way that it still pops this series ahead, at least in my head, from any other similar piece.Yes. I'm including Vicious, ppl.Antiheroes are overrated.
(view spoiler)[I'm just SO glad David got his father "back" kind of, in another dimension and could then have his relationship with him AND FORGET ABOUT PROFF'S STUPID FACE.
For the characters, the plot, the elements, the writing, the sass, and the terrible terrible plans that are so fun to read....okay...time to be doom....
And every time he was mentioned, he was grunting and sneering and it was just tedious repititon on his actions.• Like, I get it dude, SNORT LIKE A RAGING BULL, I'M SO SCARED MY BUNNY SLIPPERS RAN FOR COVER JUST NOW.• And then there was this scene where David could have (view spoiler)[finally KILLED PROFF....aaand, he didn't.
I'm even going to say that it is my favorite book from The Reckoners series.
And when it comes to action and fighting, Sanderson took both of those things in this book to another level.
David, Megan and Cody remained to be my favorite characters, but I also loved some of the new characters we were introduced to (especially Knighthawk).And when it comes to the ending (which a lot of people disliked), I have to say that I bloody loved it.
*Fistpumping* Still, hours after this read. I love you Brandon Sanderson.Freaking Gold...Gold I Say!!RTC
Hello Beautiful Book Blog  Well, David Charleston, it seems you got off easy in this final installment. I feel like it was harder to defeat Steelheart.The demands I made before reading Calamity:♥ Backgrounds for Prof, Tia and Mizzy --- Eh.♥ More explanation of "Calamity" --- Mostly.♥ More similes, of course --- Check!♥ Megan and David in love --- ♥♥♥ I'm happy.♥ All my favorite characters live (don't wanna spoil)I guess about 75% was fulfilled. We got very little backgrounds for everyone. We g
I feel like it was harder to defeat Steelheart.The demands I made before reading Calamity:♥ Backgrounds for Prof, Tia and Mizzy --- Eh.♥ More explanation of "Calamity" --- Mostly.♥ More similes, of course --- Check!♥ Megan and David in love --- ♥♥♥ I'm happy.♥ All my favorite characters live (don't wanna spoil)I guess about 75% was fulfilled.
We got the most basic answer, but the one I really wanted was why?
We find out more about Epic powers and more about Calamity which drives the plot.I liked Calamity.
I thought Calamity was a satisfying conclusion to the Reckoners series.
The story itself was fun as David and the Reckoners had to find a way to deal with Calamity and the darkness that all the epics suffer from while using their powers, while at the same time dealing with the high epic of the new city plus some familiar faces like Obliteration and the shock new villain from the end of Firefight.
We got answers to most of the big questions regarding Calamity and the nature of the superpowers and got a few new mysteries that make the impending new spin-off series The Apocalypse Guard all the more intriguing.
Mhm. I don't know how I feel about that ending.🤔
Thank God .. I couldn't take another series finale going horribly array , I'm glad Mr Sanderson delivered, i feared the worst diving in especially after reading some comments, to each his own of course , I'm just glad i liked it , i enjoyed the events as they unfolded and when it got very exciting and action packed, David's metaphors as always were mental , the novel had a hyper feeling about it the tension raising exponentially ,,, I'm very glad i read this series ... waiting for legion ;0
In truth, I feel torn because even though I enjoyed this book overall, for the first time in a long while I ended a Brandon Sanderson novel without feeling completely satisfied.
Here came the long awaited answers to the questions that have been with us since the beginning, but I’m not sure that they really resolved all that much for me.It probably goes without saying, but it’s worth mentioning anyway: This will be a spoiler-free review for Calamity, but if you haven’t read Steelheart and Firefight yet, keep in mind I may reference events from those preceding volumes.
But his off-the wall metaphors are not enough to make up for an ultimately wanting villain and this is the fact that kind of clashes with all the rest and the reason why even though I wanted to rate this book 4 stars so badly, I still found I couldn't really do it.•The thing is, Calamity was used like some kind of a reverse deus ex machina, needed to introduce the initial disruption.
What I found unsatisfying was not that (view spoiler)[Calamity's world and origin were not revealed (hide spoiler)], because I think that doing that would have only led to a great deal of confusion and explanations that had actually nothing to do with our story.
Honestly, if you haven't read the prior books in this series you will want to stop read my review at this point and start reading Steelheart instead because it is really that good.
This was my least favorite book in the trilogy but it was still an incredibly solid ending to the story.
Mizzy added humor at the right moments in the book but I actually think that Knighthawk's sense of humor was the most enjoyable.This book has a lot of action and the setting was very interesting.
I loved David, Megan, Mizzy, Abraham, and Cody just as much in this book as in the previous installments.
But while Sanderson will still be my favorite author, Calamity was NOT my favorite book.
Why?I felt like nothing really happened in the first ~70% percent.
And then the whole, imo not sufficiently elaborated alternate reality thing just seemed to bring an effortless convenient solution to a myriad of problems?
The book as a whole felt a bit rushed to me.
There were things I enjoyed, though - a special mention to the epic fight scene.
I LOVED Obliteration as a character.
As this series ends, I do feel like I'm saying goodbye to some good friends.And yeah, I know there are mixed feelings on this one, leading to some negative reviews and more criticism than Sanderson books usually receive.
Action has always been at the forefront of The Reckoners tales, and that hasn't changed in book 3 in the slightest.The settings our characters find themselves in, especially the ever-shifting city of Ildithia (formerly Atlanta), are always unique and different.
There were some halfhearted explanations for things going on, including Epic powers and the way that the Reckoner's technology works (which is unusual for Sanderson, as usually his explanations make all sorts of sense), and then a finale that felt...underwhelming.
All three books 4*'s.
A lot of people didn't seem to like this one as much as the first two but I thought they were pretty consistent.
It's an enjoyable series from start to finish.
As a YA series it's pretty basic and easy to read but sometimes that also what you need especially coming off much more challenging reads.
Having everything coming at you in a straightforward manner and not having to worry about symbolism and plots that will have great import down the road is a good change once in a while.
Some of my Goodreads friends have mixed feelings about this book.David Charleston, Megan Trash and Mizzy are one of my favourite characters.There is a full of action in this book.I enjoy reading this book but for me at the end of the book is predicted.I am satisfied with the conclusion of 'Reckoners' series.
3.5 stars.This isn't bad but it didn't live up the previous books, things were just rushed throughout the book.There were lots of battle scenes,David and more of his crazy metaphors, the dialogues were great but few, I miss the whole former plotting of the team, this one is just rushed, if this was the first or second book it would have been acceptable but its the last book in the series and I expected so much from it.
Did you like it?If the answer is yes, then you’re probably going to love this.
If the answer is no… Well, if you’re reading this you’ve probably invested a lot of time in reading the first two books so who are we kidding?
You’re probably going to read this anyway.
Overall, I think this was the most plot based of the three books.
(Also Interstellar)And the way the finally beat Calamity… Well, I thought Megan had been joking when she said the answer was the power of love.
Teniendo en cuenta los dos anteriores de la saga, no esperaba mucho más de este tomo.
Eso me extraña de Sanderson, un autor que suele esmerarse por explicar los enigmas con sumo detalle.
En Calamity se responden muchísimas preguntas que se fueron sembrando a lo largo de la serie, pero otras quedan sin el profundo esclarecimiento al que nos tiene acostumbrados.Quitando esa falta de respuestas (aunque varias se pueden deducir hasta cierto punto), lo demás estuvo a la altura de un final de saga.
Los finales sentimentalistas son mi debilidad; es imposible que no me gusten.
A lot of readers didn't care for this book as much as the two prior ones, but I actually found Sanderson's handling of the story line quite satisfying.
I will admit that the ending raises as many questions as it answers, but it still worked for me, and hopefully answering those new questions is somewhere in Brandon Sanderson's plans for the future, right after he finishes taking over the world.Full review to come, after I steal the book back from my kid who stole it as soon as I was finished.
