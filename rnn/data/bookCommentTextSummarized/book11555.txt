I'm Stu-ing over what I think about The Beatles Illustrated Lyrics by Alan Aldridge. There was a certain Ringo to the pictures Across the Universe of The Beatles lyrics. Some contributions (Alridge didn't write it ALANne) were a Taste of Honey, others casted a Paul on the Lonesome Tears in My Eyes. But nobody wants to know them and I never give them my money. Tomorrow never knows if I'll read this again. It BEAT(le)s reading anything else.
I grew up with this book.
My dad got the original 1969 edition as a birthday present from his older sister.
It was kept semi-hidden in the back of the buffet with some of my parents' other racier albums--Richard Pryor, George Carlin.
Eventually, I found these things out for myself, and this wonderful book became part of my life, too.
It also includes some surreal photography along with gag comic strip graphics and some sexually provocative pieces, too.
I copied sketches of John Lennon that were in the book.
I painted the "All You Need Is Love" piece on my bedroom walls when I was 14.
For me, the Beatles were the musical group of my older siblings.
Then as each year progressed, the Beatles became the Sinatra of rock and roll, the elder tribesmen, so to speak.
Quite frankly, I don't know what they were smoking when they wrote these lyrics, but it worked.
Still, it all comes together somehow and works as a nice collage of a long-gone era."For the benefit of Mr. Kite, there will be a show tonight on trampoline...""...Yellow matter custard dripping from a dead dog's eye"Que??Book Season = Year Round (just don't share with Danny Boyle)
I wrote a review which was the usual incisive disquisition not on the actual book but on the topic the book was about, namely Beatles lyrics, and as I clicked on SAVE this hallowed website freaked out and fell over so my incisive disquisition was lost. But maybe I should stop using Goodreads as a substitute blog anyway.
This wasn't quite what I was expecting, but it was still interesting. Based on the title, I was picturing illustrated scenes from the songs. There are a few of those (Penny Lane being one of the more memorable ones), but some of the photographs looked more like an excuse for the photographer to get to work with a topless model (with only Lovely Rita Meter Maid really bearing any relationship to the song it purports to illustrate).
This book is soooo 60s.
Its still fun to look at.
There is just so much rock and roll energy in their early work that is missing from later stuff.
All that said, I do like the White Album at least the parts that aren't filler, three sides worth maybe.
Oh, and I always liked Lennon songs way more than McCartney songs all the way up to the end in 1970.
Lennon still knew what rock and roll was all about.Listening to "You're Gonna Lose That Girl."

"Fixing a Hole" is one of my favorite songs and to see the accompanying illustration by Tomi Ungerer who illustrated one of my favorite childhood books, makes this book even more precious. That said, the book is also well used since I love to pick it up when I want Beatles' lyrics. I could try to search online just for that and find that ONE song, but then I'd miss out on having another song, quote, or illustration, catch my eye...there I will go!
Got this as an early holiday gift. Just when I thought there was nothing else unique to be published on The Beatles, here is this wondrously illustrated book featuring artistic depictions of many of their beloved songs. Mind you, this isn't a new book. It came out in the early 1970s. But when two volumes were published as one collection, it made this a must have for the bookshelves of any Beatles fan. A highly imaginative and colorful interpretation of the greatest pop songs ever written.
Beautiful book. I own three copies, and my mom has about five copies that she cuts up and makes collages from. I have a couple that she made in my dorm room that I'm looking at right now, "Oh, Darling," "Help," - "Paperback Writer," being prominently featured. ;)It's such a fun book, guys. Any Beatles fan needs to have this - or at least look through it. Simply awesome.
Truly a fantastic collection of illustrations and photos by many famous contributors (my favorite has to be Peter Max, and the four alternate individual photos of the Beatles at the time of the White Album inner photo shoot).Long out of print, but worth finding an used copy of the original printing or a reprinted softcover version.
I have the original edition which is out of print. This is a beautifully and lavishly illustrated book, it more than a book. Its a 'paegant.' You can take a look at the lyrics and the images inspired in various artist.
This book was a surprise Christmas gift from my mum and I absolutely love it. I'm a huge Beatles fan and so to have a gorgeous hardcover book of their lyrics, all so beautifully illustrated is wonderful. This is a book I'll treasure.
I wish I still had this book. Nothing will make you smile faster then a flip through this book. Unless of course you hate the Beatles. Then I can't reccommend anything for you except a vaccination maybe.
l'ISBN e' relativo alla edizione attuale de libro (1997).Su BOL viene indicata come 1�� ed.In realta', quella mia e' l'edizione del 1972, della quale ho provveduto ad uploadare la copertina (sempre che non venga sostituita con la nuova)..
Boy, that was a fun book! And, I learned the vital lyrics to 'Across The Universe', from reading this book! And, the Peter Max-style artwork is especially entertaining!
This book is a demonstration of the pure brilliance that was the Beatles... More so Lennon for me... Pure class of a man and a beautiful human being.
So many colorful and creative interpretations of the songs from the Beatles catalog. Some are done with photographs. Others are spectacular illustrations from artist Alan Aldridge. My favorite is the one for There's A Place.There are two volumes of these books. Best to get both of them, or the complete 2-volume set.
If you love the Beatles and their lyrics ......,great stuff!!
It's fun, reading the lyrics and singing the songs in my head. I know most of the songs, so, it's simply a matter of remembering the tunes and enjoying using the right words. I'm not thrilled with the illustrations. They tend to be focused on women's sexuality or weird illustrations which were not, necessarily made to match the lyrics. So, it just dated a '60's style book, which didn't necessarily enhance the lyrics themselves.
While probably not exactly poetry, the lyrics written collectively by John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr remain and always will remain part of the cultural Zeitgeist of the Western world, ubiquitous and instantly recognizable.To that effect, The Beatles Illustrated Lyrics' package is duly effective and entertaining.
And note that I deliberately use the word "experiences"; merely "reading" The Beatles Illustrated Lyrics doesn't seem to do the book justice.I thoroughly enjoyed this collection, which, while not perfect, clearly does exactly, if not more than, what it sets out to do, and is worth a recommendation.
A plan had been hatched: listen to each song that is illustrated in the book while looking at each artists’ rendering of that song’s moods and feelings then follow whatever flowed next.Instead, long meandering soliloquies on the Beatles and their importance wended their way into the review.A blank screen has always been the source of great stomach churning, as it is for most critics, I suppose, but this was different.
Sitting on my high school bedroom floor with a small eyebrow scissor and glue stick, arranging tiny images late into the night was the closest I’d ever come to feeling lost in the physical act of art-making.I quickly sent off a reply to Sarah “Ugh, I’m so sorry I’m usually never late on deadlines.
i've had this book around my house ever since i was a little girl; it's part of the fond things i remember from my childhood.
I also strongly dislike the lack of george harrison compositions (where's "I need you"?
I think alan aldridge was a bit biased between the beatles.
for gods sake, he included songs john lennon wrote after the break up and failed to include some of ringo and GEORGE's Masterpieces (im a little biased too.
i dont think so).
whatever, it's a well put-together book all in all, and i loved having all the lyrics at hand.
even if i never needed to look them up(:
When I was in college, my roommate found a copy of this book cheap at a used book sale.
I wanted it for my sister who was a HUGE fan of The Beatles at the time, but Shannan refused to part with it.The one thing I remember about the book is the art piece for "Lady Madonna.""Why is there a cake in that refrigerator?" I asked.Shannan had to explain to me that it was not a cake in the refrigerator, but a bun in the oven.
I felt pretty dumb.
I still think (quietly, to myself) that a pregnant lady has a cake in her refrigerator.
Amazing book! Pure treasure for every Beatles' fan and for anyone who wants to know more about that era. Surrealistic and psychodelic pictures enlarge and enhance smart lyrics, so that every song is taken as if it was a real drug. Also some of the songs become more clear and in some of them I discovered another meaning.
SUCH a great find, when I found this book at a sale. ALL the lyrics plus a ton of amazing photos. It will be great to use in my English classes whilst teaching poetry and music. STRAWBERRY FIELDS FOREVER!
Kinda cool, but not essential. It is what it says it is: every Beatle lyric with illustrations by different artists. Some are good, some aren't. Don't waste too much money. Just look at it in a bookstore and make up your own mind as to if you need it or not.
i read this as a kid. very cool and psychedelic
Though the illustrations have really nothing to do with the Beatles, I believe this was an important book because it was the first time the official lyrics were readily available.
Really great book, lets you look into the lives of the Beatles. I loved going over all of their lyrics.
