It is the second book in the Elsie Hawkins series, on whom, Evanovich says, Grandma Mazur was modelled.
Fans of the Stephanie Plum series will also be interested to know that the precursor of Uncle Sandor’s ‘53 powder-blue Buick features in this instalment: Elsie drives a virtually indestructible ‘57 powder-blue Cadillac.
None of her last fourteen interviews has been successful, so now, with her Aunt Elsie looking after Billy and Jason, she’s answering an ad for a carpenter.
The fact that I make a beeline for sci-fi/fantasy in any new bookstore should tell you right away that, despite my gender, I'm unlikely to be in the target demographic for a book about a thirty-something stay-at-home mom and her 2 kids and the buff carpenter she falls for.
Being more often a reader of books aimed at the male demographic, I felt like I had entered some bizarro universe where the women were the perfect do-gooders and the men were the brainless sex-toys whose interests and personalities were brought up only to be snickered at.
An older what you would call "Fluff" novel by JE. Never the less I liked it. It made me laugh as only she can do. It was just the charge I needed for a very crappy day!
I have just read a whole load of Evanovich's early romance novels, and this was one of the less good ones (along with Foul Play). Found the characters less believable than usual, as we ll as less likable and the situations, which are usually exaggerated but believable in other books, to be just too unbelievable and contrived. Not one of her best :-(
There are things he does in the book that are to violent to be romantic - even if you are giving it the leeway required of the genre.Example:**Semi-Spoiler**Woman goes into her bedroom needing some space (from guy she met two days ago) and locks the door.
Said guy (she met two days ago) BREAKS DOWN THE DOOR.
When breaking down a door is romantic: the woman is inside screaming for help, woman is inside unconscious and time is running out, when she is being held prisoner - you get the idea.**Semi-Spoiler Over**The other thing wrong with this book is that the woman in question has two kids.
The talent behind Stephanie Plum has always been there, her love of ill-behaved dogs and general chaos present from the very beginning.Lizabeth Kane is divorced with two sons to raise, and she’s determined to make it on her own.
The first person she meets is Matt Hallahan, part owner of the construction company, who practically falls in love with Lizabeth on the spot.
He also falls instantly for Lizabeth’s sons, Jason and Billy, whose ambitious father has no time for them.
I found myself laughing over and over again while reading this book.
I loved the banter between Lizabeth and Matt and thought their getting to know each other was really adorable...Lizabeth's fascination with becoming a fairy was awesome, and so was her relationship with her 2 sons.
(hide spoiler)] I didn't realize this was part of a series though and now that I know I will definitely check out the others...I would have rated this 3 stars but the humor in it gained a whole star all by itself!
Okay the thing that really made my eye twitch with this book was how quickly they jumped on each other.
They've know each other for like a week and she sleeps with him.
Dude, your a Mother of two that so desperately needs a job that you go to a construction site to get one but you sleep with the man that hires you within a week?
Just made my eye twitch.
I love Janet Evanovich and have read all of the Stephanie Plum series and a few other of her novels.
The relationship between Elizabeth and Matt moves way too fast and is just absurd at times.
Elizabeth sort of reminds me of Stephanie Plum with her brown curly hair and her inability to do simple tasks like put a lid back on a can of paint.
I believe I read somewhere that Evanovich actually modeled Grandma Mazur after Elsie.
She was actually pretty hilarious and just what you would expect from an Evanovich character.
I just didn't really love Matt or Elizabeth to be honest.
If you have just came off of a heavy read and need something light then Smitten is for you.
Lisabeth Dane is desperate to find work to care for her children's needs so she goes to a construction site looking for a job.
He tries to protect her from the hard jobs but she doesn't like his overprotection.
meanwhile Aunt Elsie hawkins has come to stay for the summer and she is a real hoot.
A flasher is on the loose and Elsie doesn't want to miss any of the action.
This and many more anecdotes make Smitten a fast read.
For instance, at one point Matt calls one of Lizabeth's chick flicks a "sissy movie." Do grown men really refer to things as "sissy?" That sounds more like something a fourth grader would say.A subplot involving a "yuppy flasher" bewildered me a bit, although I found it moderately amusing.
I'm not sure what it adds to the story, other than an excuse for the hero to move in with the heroine, which could easily have been accomplished with some other plot device.Finally, I can't end this review without mentioning Lizabeth's pet dog, Ferguson.
Knowing she needed to find a way to support herself and her children, Lizabeth Kane made the rounds applying for jobs.
Majoring in history was not a big help, so she took a chance and decided to apply for a job as a carpenter at Matt Hallahan’s construction site.
Matt knew she wasn’t qualified or built for the job, but he couldn’t find it in himself to tell her no.
The addition of the sons (10 and 8), was also well done, sometimes kids don’t get written in the right age group, but these did (I have a 10 and an 8 yr.
Lizbeth and Matt on the other hand made me want to punch something, but I usually settled with grinding my teeth.
Lizbeth complains about wanting to be independent and free and single, but it comes out as a winded whine.
Matt is bullheaded and arrogant and does anyone he wants regardless of what the people around him say or do.
Their relationship was fast, awkward, and cringe worthy.
This story was a weird telling if to emotionally unstable people joining in an extremely unhealthy relationship.
Very cute story.
But it's really, really hard not to notice the similarities between characters in these romance books and her Plum books.
In this book the character of Elsie (the crazy aunt) was so similar to Grandma Mazur that it was almost reading the same story line, down to the blue caddy.I realize that these romances were written long before the Plum series, maybe all these characters are based on the same "Real" person.
Who knows?
I just can't read them back to back.

This book was a very cheesy wannabe romance novel.
It was a romance novel for the mormons.
Where the author doesn't go into great detail of the loving that the man and woman have, which was fine by me.
But it was pretty lame.
The whole time I was reading it, which I read because I was in a reading stump and my mom had this lieing around, the whole time, I just kept thinking to myself, stuff like this doesn't really happen.
Really, the only cool character in this book was the crazy aunt.
This book was so mind-numbingly dumb (for lack of a better word) I just couldn't bring myself to waste any more time on it.
I realize it was probably meant to be a fluff romance and I have no problem with that, but the main female character was simply dumber than a box of rocks and it was irritating.
The main male character wasn't much better ...
the premise of the story that he would hire a woman with absolutely no work experience, let alone no construction experience and be in love with her almost instantly was just too unreal and unbelievable.I really enjoyed Evanovich/Kelly's "The Husband List", and had hoped this would be just as good, but alas it was not.
This book was just plain fun - typical Janet Evanovich.
This is one of her pre-Stephanie Plum books, and it's pretty obvious (to me at least) that several of the characters in this book were the inspiration for some of the characters in the Plum books.
Matt has some definite similarities to Joe Morelli, Ferguson the dog reminds me of Bob, and Aunt Elsie IS Grandma Mazur.
Even Lizabeth has a resemblance to Stephanie, although not as strong as some of the others.
There's a food-stealing dog, wacky neighbors, cute kids, a jerky ex-husband and a yuppie flasher - what more could you ask for?
When I first started this, I expected something like a Harlequin romance novel. A simple story line that would be okay at best. Surprisingly, I ended up really loving the book. Between Aunt Elsie, Ferguson, and the flasher, I couldn't stop laughing. I think I highlighted close to a quarter of the book because there were so many funny quotes. I can't wait to read the other books about Elsie. I'm sure she'll have me cracking up again.
A fun read... cute and silly but without a whole lot of depth. Janet Evanovich's sense of humor saves the story from tanking. There's a 72-year-old aunt who is concerned about her love life, two boys and a dog who steals supper on a regular basis. The hero falls head over heels for the heroine, but she has to get over her failed first marriage before she can allow this new man to become hers.
I couldn't get into this book when the female character needed a mans help to close a paint can and felt she needed a lesson on painting with a roller. Really? And the male character felt she should be looking into a job as a secretary? Can you say male chauvinist? The female character actually says that she hates being a "helpless female". Then don't act like one!
This fun and cozy romance is definitely a beach read --- I do enjoy Evanovich's early romances, lol. And while they're in the Elsie Hawkins series, Elsie is not the focus, but she is one heck of a spark!
There or 8 or 9 former Loveswept books that Evanovich wrote before the by the number series. This one is definitely more like the Stephanie Plum series. Very funny and I thought this would be what Stephanie would be like if she had 2 kids when she divorced her hubby.
Other than a few of the Stephanie Plum, I haven't read Janet Evanovich. This was a light contemporary romance as opposed to the chicklit of Stephanie Plum. It was just alright. Had some cute, funny moments but seemed almost too silly at times.
Listened to on CD and laughed my head off at more than one part. :)
Hilarious!! Laugh out loud moments! Kind of a cheesy story, but it was an enjoyable, quick read for me.
Cute book with Elsie Hawkins at it again. Adorable wee love story.
So he gives her the job letting paint the houses at first and then given her a promotion to office manager as need help with his office as his partner is out of action Matt finds himself overwhelmed at work and falling for Lizabeth.
Lizabeth Aunty also comes to stay for the summer to help care for the boys.
Lizabeth also finds herself falling in love with him but she feels she is not ready for marriage either until she see him with her children that she decides to take a chance on love.
Lizabeth is in desperate need of a job; Matt needs a construction laborer. Neither one meets the requirements but they work together anyway. When Lizabeth has a flasher outside her window, Matt becomes a "caveman" and decides to move in with her for the safety of her and her family. (Although her Aunt Elsie could kick butt!) This was a nice, short romance with a few twists because of stubbornness plus a few comedy moments due to stubbornness.
really enjoyed this story of Lizabeth and Matt.Luzabeth is a single mother looking for a job, any job. Matt is the owner of a construction company. Lizabeth shows up one day and talks her way into a carpenter job with Matt. It is a fun, heartwarming story with a romance, a goofy dog, an eccentric aunt and a naked stalker! have to find more of this author's books to read.
