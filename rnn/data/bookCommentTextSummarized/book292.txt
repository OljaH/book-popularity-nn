This is a really cool book--the whole thing is typeset in an imitation of old German type, the symbols are intriguing, and the history is fascinating. It is also the best book for reading on the airplane to freak out your seatmate!
It was a reprint of a Victorian publication, by the same people who make those books of paper dolls and stained-glass dog pictures.
It was almost more of a tract than a book, really.
It compiled a lot of occult and historical symbols with concise explanations of traditional meanings.
I guess it really is as they say – the pictograph supersedes alphabets in its universal meaning to all humans.This is a good reference book to keep on hand, especially considering the price ($1.25 originally, $3.00 in a used book store several decades later).
C'erano una volta le librerie Remainders, dove si poteva trovare a forti sconti il materiale di magazzino dei principali editori italiani e spesso anche volumi in lingua straniera. In uno di questi, il primo anno dell'università trovai questo strano e interessante volumetto, certamente non esaustivo della materia. Mi è sempre piaciuto sfogliarlo e in qualche caso mi è stato persino utile per inquadrare meglio alcuni edifici o alcune epigrafi nei miei vagabondaggi ossolani.
This is more a reference book. I wished however, that more had been said about each symbol. I have been left wanted to know more about them. Particularly the symbols that appear in the Gothic cathedrals.
Visually beautiful with a lot of fascinating signs, rendered in woodcuts, no less; unfortunately the text is barely adequate when it comes to delving into the meanings.
Good compilation of symbols and their meanings.
It has many signs in it, some related to my practices and some not. It has the runes for me to study as well, and is a decent reference guide.
