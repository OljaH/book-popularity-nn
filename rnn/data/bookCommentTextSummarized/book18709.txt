Ok. I admit it. I have a crush on Four. And the thing is that...I'm a boy.
I thought my Divergent obsession couldn't possibly escalate any further. I mean Fourtris goodness? Check. Kick-ass action? Check. But a scene from Four's POV?  Well...check! This scene (the knife-throwing scene) from Four's POV is perfect fangirling material. I read it, sat absorbed in the moment and then started sniffling at the fact Four wasn't real for a good hour...or two!I love the complexity of his character and how real Four is. And sorry, I can't call him Tobias for some reason - it just

I liked how it shows how his interest in Tris isn't purely "wow-she's-hot/pretty-romantic-wishy-washy", but deeper - how their two souls are so similar, how they are both fighters, survivors and how "looking at her was like waking up".
That line was pure magic.I LOVE YOU FOUR!!
Looking at her is like waking up.    This was short! Like 16 pages short. Free Four: Tobias Tells the Divergent Story  is Veronicas retelling of the knife throwing scene from Fours point of view. The kindle edition also includes the first two chapters from Divergent, the first two chapters from Insurgent, part of The Transfer and a chapter from Veronicas new series: Carve the Mark  I have to admit that Christina is good—though I don’t like giving credit to Candor smart-mouths—and so is Peter—t

I enjoyed this story, but I don´t understand why it wasn´t just included in Four: A Divergent Story Collection when they published the short stories from Fours point of veiw.
Oh man, this was awesome!But I just wish there was more.
But here I liked him a little more.
I thought that was pretty interesting and informative.I like that she is not your typical pretty heroine but he finds her determination and solid strength attractive.
I can love him a little more for that.And Amar, guys!
Doesn't he sound awesome?
He seemed like a pretty badass and cool leader.You know, I can really see a prequel series/book working well.
Imagine reading the times when Eric and Four were initiates.
Sounds interesting, huh.
This is a prequel (book or series) that actually makes sense to me.And because I am kind.
Ugh, I wish there was another edition of 'Divergent' from his POV! This made me want to reread both books again.
Four!It's a short story.
This short story covers the knife throwing scene - the one in which Four nicks Tris' ear on purpose.
She tips her chin up and looks at me with that Abnegation stubbornness I know so well.
She may have left them, but they are what's making her strong.I can't tell her that it will be okay, not with Eric here, but I can try to make her strong.~Looking at her is like waking up.~The other factions call us brutish, as if we don't use our minds, but that is all I do here.
OMGOSH, how do I love Four, let me count the ways...It was so great to read this from his POV.I loved remembering how Tris saw him, how she was annoyed with him because she thought he was being "mean" to her (when in actuality he was trying to save her!). This just makes me want to read Insurgent even more...I cannot wait until May 1st!
one of the best things about having an e-reader are these groovy little splinter-chapters and novellas available digitally that are meant to tide you over until the next book in a series comes out or to re-tell something from another perspective, and it is all fangirl and -boy squee-ish and a really nice thing that authors can do for us.like this one.a retelling of a key scene in divergent.but…here's the thing.
i'm not saying this was a waste of time or anything, and especially considering this is a YA series, and at that age, i would have killed for extra chapters from my favorite books, like how i read H.
Άρχισε να μου αρέσει περισσότερο ο Τέσσερα!! Νομίζω πως σχεδόν πάντα απολαμβάνω καλύτερα την αφήγηση από την πλευρά του άντρα 💖
I love how Veronica Roth chose this scene for Four's POV.
Most authors who have been releasing scenes from the guy's POV lately, always choose a scene where they were making out or something (in which case she probably would have gone with Chapter 31).
Like Clare's An Offering of Moonlight, or Jennifer L.
Armentrout's Daemon Extra from Obsidian, which is fun, of course.
But this scene of Tobias and Tris is before all that happened.
When they were still figuring each other out.
Again Roth puts herself above the rest.
I love it.
I am rather surprised by the scene choice–in talking with others who've read and loved Divergent, our shared expectation overwhelmingly seemed to be that Roth would pick either "capture the flag/ferris wheel" or "the fear landscape." She mentioned both of these scenes as possibilities she considered.
In her blog–post about this scene, she commented that she really spends more time in Tobias's head than she realized and that writing the scene in his voice turned out to be less difficult than she had imagined.
She "spends time" in her characters' heads, and her writing has a quality in consequence that it could not have otherwise.
"Looking at her is like waking up."
Oh, Four.
Tobias <3 I loved him in Divergent but now I adored him. I thought he was just being mean so Eric won't suspect him, but he is so much better than that :)
Oh my god. It's from Four's point of view. It's only 16 pages or something, but I'm so glad this exists.
3.5 starsThis was much too short.
Why do authors feel the need to tease us with the male's perspective?
I've said it before and I'll say it again: I love reading a beloved female-driven story again from the male's perspective.
It's my weakness.
Free Four an ideal excerpt to read before or after Insurgent as a way to better understand Four's character, his thought process and his feelings for Tris.
He's a pretty great character, you have to admit and I'm thrilled at any kind of deeper insight into his personality.
I can only hope Veronica Roth will give us more Four :)
Oh, wow. Can we just have a book from Four's perspective? No offense Tris, but I love your man...Whoa, Tris, watcha doin' with that knife? *flails* *scampers back to Candor and reminds self to shut mouth around the Dauntless*
Too short! I want more.
I'm still screaming.
I just discovered this now and I can't believe I didn't know about it before!!
what kind of person am I?I love Four, I love him so much, he is one of my favorite male characters ever and this scene in particular is so intense, so strong, so vivid that I felt like dying and screaming and jumping all at the same time!Veronica Roth, again, has demonstrated how incredible she is, how talented, how great.Tomorrow comes out Insurgent and I believe this little but perfect story was the thing I needed to survive till tomorrow.I give it 5 millions stars.
Aaaahhh!! totally loved it! :) I think V. Roth should write a whole book on Four's POV cause this was really really cool.
Raise your hand if you were one of the 35,000 people that pre-ordered Insurgent to get Roth to reveal this Four POV scene.Four was my fave character from Divergent so I'm grateful we're given the chance to peer into his mind: to see what things were like when he was an initiate, what his plans were just before Tris arrived (view spoiler)[to become factionless (hide spoiler)], and that he has...a fifth fear? (view spoiler)[hurting Tris (hide spoiler)]["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>
This one's actually pretty good. A super quick addition to the Divergent series for any diehard fan.
I wish we could have the whole book from his perspective...I feel like short e-novellas should have their own rating system, because sure they aren't the complete story but they bring something to the table.
This story for example brought a LOT to the table when it comes to hundreds of beating hearts who lovingly wait for any mention of Four in Divergent.
Free Four is a short re telling of Divergent through Four's eyes, and not just on any part but the knife throwing scene!!
Let Veronica Roth take a step into the unthinkable and write Divergent again through Four's eyes?!
Seriously, I was pretty horrified by the glorified violence in Divergent, but this manages to be close to psychotic.
He's nasty, completely incapable of making any sort of comment without immediately tacking on some sort of insult, has a very messed up moral core, and is incredibly whiny.
Here's my big issue with this and Divergent.
They seem to think that violence is cool, and advocate its use pretty strongly.
It's bland, clunky, questionable in tone and intent, and completely fails as a character exercise.
Tobias/Four started out as a jerk and remains one throughout Divergent.
It was fine. Didn't love it, but I really like Four, so...
3. He'd guessed Tris was a Divergent since Eric was keeping an eye on her and all the Divergent's are dying one by one except him.
5.Four was afraid Eric would find out he has feelings for Tris as he keeps staring at her.
6.Four feels he could've accepted Max's offer to become a dauntless leader as he could've prevented these heinous training like hanging off the chasm and beating each other senseless.
7.He'd also requested Eric to remove knife throwing from the training syllabus as there was no point in it other than trying to impress people.
OMG KILL ME WHY DON'T YOU??? Since I am too afraid to read Allegiant yet,i decided to read this,and OMG BEST CHOICE OF THE DAY!!! Tobias is so perfect!!! 'Looking at her is like waking up' he says,and i melt..Why does he have to be so perfect?? Ughh I hate that Allegiant isn't that good according to others. I need to know whats happening in the end,but at the same time i don't!!
"I can’t leave now. I like her too much. There, I said it.But I won’t say it again..."Don't you just love Four?May 1st hurry up please!
*Aquí es cuando finjo reír para no llorar*Mi amado Tobias...
siempre estarás en mi corazón.P.D. VERONICA ROTH PORQUE DESTROZASTE A UN PERSONAJE TAN HERMOSO EN TU ESTÚPIDO EPILOGO DE MIERDA?!!!!
'I like [this series] too much. There, I said it. But I won’t say it again'. (because I don't need too - it's obvious)
