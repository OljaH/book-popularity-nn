This book is a master piece by a great master . The way he has put forward the arguments and facts is incredible. Every indian must read this to understand the evolution of Indians and caste based society .
Yes, there are historians who have attempted to look upon the different aspects of untouchability but none of them dares to do such an exhaustive research as Ambedkar aims to.
Being unparalleled in both scope and achievement means Ambedkar has to construct a whole new theory about the inception of untouchability.
This does not mean the work is a result of pure conjecture, Ambedkar does not ask us to 'trust him'.
Finally, it urges us to be social watchdogs, to accept our prejudices and biases and yet still work for the upliftment of those that are not as privileged as us.
Good book. Seems very far fetched though. Good book. Seems very far fetched. Too elaborate when it's not needed. Needs more citations than just confirmation bias. Arguments don't tend to be convincing at all sometimes. Seems more like wishfuk thinking than an accurate analysis.
Ambedhkar have given convincing answer for question of origin of Untouchablity in his book “The Untouchable” which no other scholar have given.He clearly explains through his research on Manu, Rig veda, Smritis etc…He proved that untouchablity emerged as late as 400 A.D.He also provides 2 reasons for Untouchablity:1.People who followed Buddhism even after Buddhism faded away..2.People who ate beef..His views on Aryan migration and Dravidians as Nagas is now been proven through genetic research(R1a haplogroup)
This book is amazing , it exactly point out the reasons why barbaric custom like untouchability is observed in Hindu religion. It is also compares the untouchability in Hindu Religion with religions all over the world, and I come to know that although untouchability for some unhuman things and for some animals followed in some cultures no religion and culture all over the world follows such an in-human tradition.
Thought provoking. Interesting assumptions and comparisons!Great book by a great scholar! Clarity of thoughts, certain assumptions are amazing. The comments on untouchability is not one sided, it might be due to a fight between Hindu Brahmins vs Buddhists is interesting. Opens a new thought style and provokes to read more.
A Honest Analysis on Untouchability & its origin Dr. B R Ambedkar, in this book proposes a solid theory on the origin of the practice of untouchability. He is honest enough to admit that he mad few assumptions to come to the conclusions he did and he also threw the theory open to debate and scrutiny. This book is a a must read for an analytical mind.

Dr B.R. Ambedkar was a genius. I don't think there would ever be man more well read than he was. The amount research he has done to write this book is unimaginable.
