He came to the island the year before with Pitch and met his stallion, Flame.
He is so big and muscular that he rules Antago because everyone is scared of him so they obey him.The setting of this book takes place on Azul Island in the summer.
The whole problem started when they had to go to Antago for the vet, and when they had set sail Tom saw them and wanted to follow them to the secret hideout.
When he started abusing Flame, I wanted to get in the book and do something to him.
"Never was there a horse so beautiful! No other could match the finely molded body or the giant muscles that moved so smoothly beneath tight, sliding skin. No equal did he have in strength of legs and withers, chest and shoulders."Flame and his band of island horses are at risk from a no-good horse "trainer" who isn't, well wo isn't very nice to his horses. It's up to Steve and Pitch to protect the horses from harm and from discovery.Like all Farley's books, they're short and basic, but great for horse lovers.
Returning to Azul Island alongside Steve and Pitch, we are excited to learn this is still a forgotten paradise.
Steve and Flame continue to have the kind of connection most riders dream of having with their horse.
When a chance encounter with Tom back on Antago sets of a chain of events that brings the cruel man to Azul Island, within reach of Flame and the foal, we fear that nothing can ever put things back the way they were.Farley sets up another great novel in The Black Stallion series with tension and excitement.
Although it brings out the character of Flame more than the other books in the Island Stallion series, this is a very violent book and may not be suitable for small children.
I can't help but wonder if Farley was depressed when he wrote this.
It's one of the shortest books in the series.
Even Ruth Sanderson (the cover artist) seems to be phoning it in, too.
Compare the image of Flame on the cover with the Breyer Fighting Stallion model.
Just add some waving mane, a blue sky and some canyon rock walls in the background and --hey presto -- instant book cover.
My oldest son asked me to read this book, thinking that I'd enjoy it. For the most part, I did. I found the contrasts particularly interesting. Tom is painted evil from the first mention and only gets more stupid, fat and animal with every encounter. Flame, however, is his opposite: beautiful, intelligent and benevolent. We're never given a chance to like Tom and we're never given a chance to dislike Flame.Overall, it's an "OK" book. My issues with it are more about what I like in a book than anything to do with the book.
This book had its good parts and its bad parts. I hated Tom, but then, we were supposed to, Farley made that obvious. His villains are almost always very obvious.It did have a few good parts, though. The beginning, before Tom showed up, was pretty good. It wasn't terrible, though, except for the part where Tom and Flame fight. I hated that.All in all, just an okay installment in the series.
I started re-reading The Black Stallion series by Walter Farley in April and read five more from that series in May: Son of the Black Stallion, The Black Stallion and Satan, The Island Stallion, The Island Stallion's Fury, and The Blood Bay Colt. Only The Black Stallion and Satan was as enjoyable as when I was a kid, though I remember never really caring for the Island Stallion "spin-offs" or the two books on harness racing. Where's Alec and The Black? Bring 'em back!
Not as good as the first Island Stallion book as there is a bit to much unreal information about horses. I know both series give human emotions to the horses to an extent but having a stallion care about the well being of a foal was just stretching credibility too far. The boys enjoyed it though and the part where the stepbrother is lost in the caves is pretty creepy.
I enjoyed the characters, and their world and hope I get the chance to read the story again and/or to read more within the series.My Rating System:* couldn't finish, ** wouldn't recommend, *** would recommend, **** would read again, ***** have read again.
This is the only Black Statllion Series book that I'll separately add to my list, simply because it's amazing. It takes place on a mysterious island with lots of tunnels and secret passages and the kinds of things that enchant young readers. Soo good.
The first book was the story of a boy and a horse, but the series grows with books on similar themes of overcoming adversity and animal/human bonding. Loved them as a kid.
Great story! Love the twist!
A rock'n good book!!!!
I wasn't so much of a fan of this book. I found Steve not a protagonist I could warm to and I didn't find the situations as engaging as the majority of the Black Stallion series was.
I can't really remember this book. But it was very good.
There was not a Black Stallion book that I could ever put down. The stories are the best.
Best of the bunch, if you ask me
The boys who went to the deserted island and found the horse, Flame as they named it, did research on the island. They've found a lot of the history on the island.
a great story about horses and their world
Re-read from long ago
Didn't enjoy this one as much as I did the others in the series, but it was still worth reading.
Reread this childhood favorite. Does not hold up as well as some of Walter Farley's other books, but I wanted to revisit the section in the tunnels that haunted me as a kid.
It doesn't really even earn a single star, it simply has too much discription! I can't even finish it, too boring, no suspense.
Amazing.. I love Walter Farley Books.
Good book for young people who like Horse stories.
I stormed through this series. I made a beeline for the "F" section for a month's worth of library visits, until I had read the whole series.
I hace the fondest memories of searching for these books while on vacations at books stores all over the country when I was in grade school.
I really thought this was a really good book
I gobbled up all of these books when I was in my horse phase.
Loved reading this as a child.
