"Sometimes you have to be a high riding bitch to survive, sometimes, being a bitch is all a woman has to hang on to."Having been suspected of being involved in the death of her rich employer, Dolores Claiborne tells the story of her life to the police, from the disintegration of her marriage and suspicious death of her husband to the relationship she had with her employer, Vera Donovan.Wow, this book is pretty unique - it's in the form of a monologue given by Dolores herself detailing the events leading up to her husband's death a number of years previously, as well as the more recent death of her employer, Vera Donovan.
Although I liked the unique narration of this book, I personally was not a fan of the lack of chapters or section breaks, but I guess that's just a personal preference.

In her awesome review, Catie puts it this way: This book is a powerful and naked look at mother-love, at how desperate, intense, and all-consuming it really is....But mainly this is the story of an unlikely alliance between two hard talkin’, high riding bitches; two women from very different walks of life who find that they have a similar core of bitter strength.
(hide spoiler)]Dolores Claiborne is not the only high-riding bitch in this story, there is also Ms. Vera Donovan, her contrary, vitriolic employer who explains the facts of life thusly: "Husbands die every day Dolores.
Reading their books in close succession, I was struck by how stereotypically some of the women had been written, portrayed as weaklings, often breaking down crying and hiding in a corner while the MEN stomped off to solve problems.
The two novels I read last fall that included some irritating stereotypes were Coben's Don't Let Go and Grisham's The Rooster Bar. In both cases, the women that felt like caricatures weren't the main characters, but there were several scenes that made me cringe.
Fascinating story and such a strong voice.
Since this story is pretty much an obvious one, centered on what appears to be a solid who-done-it, it's just the devil in the details where we have to place all our attention.Will this be a rubbernecking event?
Or is an obviously guilty woman obviously and truly guilty with the crime she is being accused of?Truly, the story is a lot more complex and interesting than any first glance, and more than anything, we're meant to get in deep within Dolores's skin.
Classic SK, not supernatural, but absolutely an awesome character slide.Is that the sound of a vacuum cleaner?
And reading I truly was curious how she managed to not drownd in unfriendly world, I didn’t give a damn that she killed that despicable dick her husband was, it's barely a spoiler, Dolores admits that in her first words, I was interested how she managed to get off lightly.
I was interested in her relatationship with Vera Donovan for before the latter turned into demented harpy she was, well, a harpy but a very smart and her mind was razor-sharp but her life wasn't a barrel of laughs either.I found figure of Dolores well written, neither too exaggerated nor inept poor thing.
I have been sitting in a room having a little break, from A Dance with Dragons, listening to Dolores tell me her story.It’s a confession really.About her husband and what happened during that eclipse.
About her employer but; mostly, and most importantly, about herself: as a woman, and a wife, and a mother.It is a very chilling tale, told by today’s master of the craft.The bell resonates.I fell into her voice and found myself in that small town, on that little island, off the coast of Maine with her: listening to the events that led up to that eclipse and after; until now.
(Forgive me as I talk a bit about the movies born from King’s novels.) So Kathy Bates starred as both Annie Wilkes and Dolores Claiborne in Misery and…what’s the name of the other film?...
King created two complex women characters in these two books who I consider polar opposites to one another.
Reading it in the book is where it makes sense, from the lips of Vera Donovan (the woman Dolores worked and cared for – the real bitch for a time).
Like the characters, this book ended up being deceivingly complex because the things that are not directly experienced.
I think what makes it stand out is the unique format of the story, which was Dolores giving her testimony to the police after her employer died in her care.
Although it touched on a horrifying topic, it was not suspenseful or scary--although a little chilling—and was so realistic that it felt more like listening to a true story.
There’s a lot to be learned from Dolores Claiborne, mostly about how to be true to yourself.
I think so far this may be my favorite.
4.5 estrellasUn libro de Stephen King distinto, contado como un monologo, es en realidad una confesión a la policía sobre toda una vida caótica y atrapante.Es una novela un poco densa al principio, pero cuando le agarras el ritmo creo que no lo soltarás hasta que lo termines, Dolores es uno de los mejores personajes que ha creado King y Vera una perfecta "compañera" para ella. Enserio amigos ¡que tal libro ha sido este! De los que realmente te generan esa sensación de empatía y cariño Recomendadísimo para los lectores SK
“Sometimes being a bitch is all a woman's got to hold on to.”One of King's greatest talents is in his writing of characters, making them come across as realistic paper-people with sympathetic emotions and believable motivations.
While she's being suspected in the murder of one, she chooses to start with another story instead.The books a little strange since King has most of it in dialogue, and not all that dialogue is a smooth flowing pleasure to read.
After awhile it flows together when you get into the story, though, and you hardly notice you're mainly reading about a woman sitting in a chair while she talks.
I haven’t read very many from Stephen King (well, okay, I’ve read nine but seven of those were Dark Tower books).
It’s also a dark portrayal of battered woman syndrome and how sometimes the ugly choices seem like the only options.
But mainly this is the story of an unlikely alliance between two hard talkin’, high riding bitches; two women from very different walks of life who find that they have a similar core of bitter strength.This is essentially a monologue/confession delivered by Dolores Claiborne in a small town police station.
With no chapter breaks and one of the best vernacular-heavy voices King's ever taken on, this book's engine very nearly purrs.
Dolores Claiborne is, in my opinion, Stephen King's most well-delivered story.
His short stories and novellas have, but never one of his novels.
Normally, I suggest reading King's books in chronological order, but I believe Gerald's Game and Dolores Claiborne should be read in reverse order.
Gerald's Game was released first, but you get a better experience reading these twin novels if you read Dolores Claiborne beforehand.
Five stars for one of my very favorite Stephen King stories: the enthralling and legendary 1993 novel, Dolores Claiborne.
As old as this book is, and considering it was made into a big budget film starring Kathy Bates (my favorite King adaption, by the way), almost everyone knows the plot — so I won't rehash too much.
But I will say this is the story of a woman — easily the strongest woman King has ever created, and simply one of the best damn female main characters I've ever come across in fiction.
Novels like this one are why he is my favorite writer, full stop.
Another UNPUTDOWNABLE read by Stephen King. As Dolores Claiborne narrates her story of murder, abuse and revenge to authorities (without any chapter breaks), I stayed totally engrossed. You will despise her evil husband and love her entertaining dialogue with Vera as they become friends.As I had recently read Gerald's Game, I thought the eerie connection of two unrelated women who experience terror(view spoiler)[ and kill their husbands (hide spoiler)] during the total eclipse added to the suspense.I thought the movie was great, but like the differences in the book better.If you want a fast, page-turning read, this is it!
I’ve read the book on a number of occasions over the years, and this is the second listening of the audio, and I seem to enjoy it more each time.Different than what we usually expect from Stephen King, but where it is the same, as with all his books, are the wonderfully rich, diverse characters that he introduces us to.I don’t particularly enjoy female narrators but Frances Sternhagen does a great job bringing to life this strong, gutsy, often foul mouthed but compassionate woman.***CONNECTIONS, COINCIDENCES and CHESTNUTS:Dolores Claiborne and Gerald’s Game were written in tandem and were intended to be a two-volume set called In the Path of the Eclipse.
And while I've had a VERY different set of life experiences to Dolores, I'm much better able to identify with her, and actually understand this story.
The other book of King's to use this style is Cujo, and there it DOESN'T work (in my opinion), because Cujo is a story that jumps around and changes perspective and focus quite frequently, so it would actually benefit from being segmented.
Knowing that she's in a pretty tight spot, she decides to 'fess up, and tells the story of how, and why, she did in fact kill her husband, and how her bosslady came to be dead, but that it wasn't murder.

I feel like this book could have easily been a short story or novella, because it's pretty simple and there's not much to it.
This book is Dolores telling the story of how she killed her husband, and how she didn't kill her employer who has mysteriously died.
For me, there wasn't enough story to keep this interesting from beginning to end.If I hasn't listened to this on audiobook, I honestly don't think I would have finished it!
I do think the connections to Gerald's Game were interesting, although that wasn't enough to redeem the book for me.
(I was new to Stephen King back then)Dolores Claiborne is basically a confession of a woman named by the title, to the police after being accused of killing her employer Vera Donavan.
Although she didn't kill Vera, she did confess the things she's been through past 30 years of being with her that was buried deep under herself all this time.
This novel is full of fast paced suspense with an enthralling premise.
As she say it, "Fool me once, shame on you.
Fool me twice, shame on me."I am totally impressed by the writing.
Reconozco que al principio me pareció un batiburrillo de cosas pero poco a poco me fue ganando. Esta novela se volvió frenética y Dolores consiguió conquistarme. Ya nunca jamás volveré a ver igual un eclipse. Muy recomendable!
How Stephen King can write a story, really drag you into it and make you feel for his characters and do it over and over again in a new way.
For those of you who still insist on not reading Stephen King because he writes scary horrific stories.
Thank goodness there is this thing called audio books because let me tell you, the narrator of this story is brilliant.
Well, it's about a 65 year old woman by the name of Dolores Claiborne who lives on Little Tall island outside of Maine.
Dolores has three children and that is what the story is about.
5***** and a ❤The entire novel is told by Dolores Claiborne in her sworn statement to the investigating police. Her employer of 40 years has died in a tragic accident … or did Dolores kill her? Dolores doesn’t pull any punches, she tells us on page two that she did  not  kill Vera Donovan (though Vera deserved killing, more than once … she was a high-riding bitch). No, Dolores did nothing to hasten old Mrs Donovan’s ending … but she  did  kill her husband, Joe St George, twenty-nine years ago. K
Her employer of 40 years has died in a tragic accident … or did Dolores kill her?
kill her husband, Joe St George, twenty-nine years ago.
And letting you into Dolores’s mind – a nearly 66-year-old woman who has had a hard life and who isn’t about to suffer fools gladly.
She’s worked hard, keeping house for rich Mrs Donovan, and caring for her in her senility.
She’s raised three children without much help from Joe, a no-good alcoholic husband who beat her one time too many.
What really impressed me was that King manages to write in a thick Maine accent you can “hear” on the page.
Ok. Eines vorweg: Wer ein Problem mit "derber" Umgangssprache hat, sollte lieber zu einem anderen King Buch greifen.Dolores nimmt jedenfalls kein Blatt vor den Mund und redet so, dass es jeder auf der Insel versteht.
(1/3 gelesen)Abschluss.Wow. Ich habe wirklich selten so einen runden Roman von King gelesen.Die Geschichte, mit all ihren Wendungen, war mir schon vorher dank der hervorragenden Verfilmung bekannt, aber wie King hier den Roman beendet, welche Stilmittel er hier verwendet hat, all das wurde mir erst auf den letzten 50 Seiten klar.Ein wahnsinnig toller Roman, der mich noch lange beschäftigen wird (und mich auf "Das Spiel" neugierig macht!)King Fun Facts.
"There are some times in a person's life that don't have no real minutes in em, so you can't count em up"When questioned by the police about the death of her employer, Dolores Claiborne answers in a way that no-one would have imagined.
Two officers and one stenographer then listens as she tells her story - and what an amazing story it is!
The thrilling and mystifying tie-ins to the preceding book, Gerald's Game , adds so much to the story in so few words.
Never mind that brat and take my word for this being among the best in the King's amazing catalog.
And do read it with it's sister story Gerald's Game!
Juk tiek laiko be Stephen knygų gyvenau!O "Doloresa Kleiborn", kaip Šoušenko apsakymas , yra visai ne tai ko tikiesi rinkdamasis siaubo karaliaus kūrinius.
Tai vienas ištisas Doloresos monologas policijos nuovadoje, kur ji pasakoja savo gyvenimo istoriją.
Doloresa apie tai pasakoja su tokia energija, tokiu karščiu, kad nori nenori perimi jos įtampą ir nekantrauji sužinoti kas nutiko toliau.
Juokiausi iki ašarų (negaliu patikėti, kad sakau tai apie King'o knygą).
Man tai yra vienas geresnių, nors ir netipiškas Kingui, darbų.Apie Šoušenką kalbėti daug ir nereikia.
Nes Stephen King parašė labai gerą apsakymą.
Tačiau jis pasakoja ne apie save.
That's probably just a result of not being used to reading something where the first-person narration is Claiborne-esque.
I don't know any other way of describing the voice other than "Claiborne-esque." It was a bit dicey, a bit choppy, didn't really flow all that well at times.
But I'll chalk that up to Claiborne's voice itself and not King.I didn't really find the story to be all that captivating.
I think if I'd have gotten to know them better, I'd have cared more about the way the story unfolded.There's also the big question, which is: Is Dolores Claiborne guilty, or was she just doing what any mother would do?
Since the people of Little Tall Island have been waiting for 30 years to find out what really happened when her husband had died, she felt she had no choice but tell everything she knew and give her own testimony to these events.I really enjoyed this story a lot but I did have a couple of issues with the book itself.
I find that she was probably the only character that I really liked in this story even if her actions were sometimes questionable.I recommend this book to anyone who loves a bit of history, mystery and a little thriller thrown in.
Questo è il mio primo King e nonostante sembra non sia tra i suoi lavori migliori, almeno a detta di molti fans, devo dire che mi è piaciuto molto. Mi ha davvero tenuta incollata, mi sembrava quasi di essere seduta lì tra loro. Per fortuna l'horror o il sovrannaturale che mi aspettavo, non l'ho trovato, ne avevo un po' timore. Un argomento purtroppo molto attuale quello dell'alcolismo, gli abusi di minori, la violenza sulle donne e i gesti estremi che ne possono derivare. Bello! Consiglio di leggerlo.
Quite possibly the greatest character that King has written yet.
Η Ντολόρες Κλέμπορν, 66 ετών σήμερα, πολλά χρόνια μετά το θάνατο του συζύγου της, ανακρίνεται για έναν ακόμη θάνατο.
Είναι η Ντολόρες Κλέμπορν που –ενώπιον των ανακριτικών υπαλλήλων- αφηγείται τη ζωή της, in medias res, ξεκινώντας από την ανακοίνωση του φόνου του άντρα της και περιγράφοντας διεξοδικά όλα εκείνα τα γεγονότα που την οδήγησαν σε αυτή την απόφαση.
Δοκιμάζεται καθημερινά, στο σπίτι, από έναν σύζυγο που υπάρχει όχι για να της συμπαρίσταται αλλά για να την επιβαρύνει ακόμη περισσότερο (πρώην αλκοολικός, μάλλον τεμπέλης και διάφορα άλλα που θα αποφύγω να αναφέρω εδώ καθότι θα συνιστούσαν spoilers) και στη δουλειά από ένα αφεντικό δεσποτικό και ιδιόρρυθμο.

Sometimes being a bitch is all a woman's got to hold on to.

This book is related to Gerald's Game, even though it is only for a short supernatural moment during the Solar Eclipse.
Dolores Claiborne is a fascinating character and the main reason why I enjoyed this book so much.
Probably one of King's most underrated books, Dolores Claiborne is a true gem about human's nature and mother's unconditional love.
I haven't watched the film though but I don't think it can even come close to the book.
Ich hätte niemals gedacht, dass mir dieses Buch so unter die Haut gehen würde.. ich konnte es kaum aus der Hand legen. Die Geschichte ist wahnsinnig fesselnd und die Protagonistin eine unfassbare Frau. Meine ausführliche Rezension folgt auf dem Blog.
According to a book of Stephen King criticism that I recently didn't finish reading because it was by and large total nonsense, some of Mr. King's squillion readers complained in the late 80s when people got concerned about these things that he didn't really DO women characters -- anodyne props, madonna/whore, blah blah blah.
Being Stephen King, he apparently responded by saying "Then I shall write Dolores Claiborne and Gerald's Game." While I don't think that child molestation and abusive husbands is a hugely empowering through-line for the project (although neither did I really feel like King's female characters were offensive in the first place), Dolores Claiborne was, as I remember from age 12, a ripping good yarn (I'm not sure there are any other authors who impel me to use the phrase "ripping good yarn" ever, let alone routinely).
This is my first time reading this book and I’ve never seen the movie either so it was totally new territory for me.
My favourite part about this book was that I didn’t feel like I was reading a Stephen King book, I felt like I was reading a transcription of Dolores’ confession.
I think that’s a testament to how real King has made Dolores feel for me.
She wasn’t just a character in a book I was reading, she became like a real person to me as her story developed.
I somehow skipped this one when I was growing up. That was a mistake. I didn't see the movie yet either but I'll remedy that this weekend. This is a little shorter than the average King novel but I still loved it. If you like Stephen King at all you'll probably like this. Recommended.
Kao i uvijek, nisam se prevario jer sam dobio jednu vrlo dobru priču o disfunkcionalnoj obitelji, koja nema fantastičnih elemenata pa time spada u, kako ja to volim reći, obična Kingova djela.Radnja započinje kada se glavna protagonistica Dolores sprema ispričati svoju priču policiji s obzirom na nesretni slučaj koji se dogodio.
Kad se sve uzme u obzir nisam požalio što sam uzeo ovu knjigu u ruke jer je King majstor koje god se tematike primi, zbog toga konačna ocjena čvrstih 4/5.IZDVOJENI CITATI„Nema te sile na nebu ni na zemlji koja bi ljude spriječila u tome da misle najgore što mogu o nekome.“„Najzanimljivije što netko može učiniti u ovoj provincijskoj pustoši je da iznenada umre.“ „Na što nalikuje bilo koji brak?
Kind of a trumped up monologue, it's more of a "why-done-it" suspense/psychological thriller than a spine-tingling horror.Ultimately it's a story that explores the complexity of human relationships, motivation, and disappointment using well-drawn, layered, and interesting characters that border on caricatures--in other words, the kind of book I love.The dialect/dialogue is also quite impressive, even if occasionally a little over-done.
It certainly makes the book feel longer than it is (something that didn't bother me, but might bother you.)I really like Stephen King and appreciate his talent, but I've only loved a few of his books/stories.
Great read. Not much of the supernatural so a little different from some other King books. Dolores Claiborne reminds me of Maude Findlay.
Muchas veces ser una cabrona es lo único a lo que una mujer desesperada puede aferrarse. Es un libro diferente de King. Es un drama muy desgarrador. Es increíble la capacidad de este autor para tocar las cuerdas más ocultas de nuestros corazones. Me encariñé muchísimo con Dolores Claiborne. Y obviamente Vera Donovan... Es uno de los mejores personajes jamás creados por King, en mi opinión. En algunas partes se me hizo bastante pesado, sin embargo esta novela me tocó el alma. Tiene un final muy fuerte, que me rompió el corazón.
It's been a while since I read a Stephen King book, and I picked this one up thinking that I'd actually already read it.If I have read it before I can't remember but I loved this book this time around.This whole book is Dolores Claiborne telling the reader her story, and of course, this being Stephen King, it works brilliantly. I was shocked in parts, surprised in others, and very satisfied with the whole thing by the end.An excellent story, from the best story-teller I've ever read.
This is the Stephen King book that I recommend to anyone who says they don't like horror books. Simply put, this is the story of a woman who kills her husband... I'm not giving anything away, you know this from the first few pages. This is as good as any suspense novel you'll find, but with real, true character development that makes you care about the protagonist, sympathize with her decision and feel genuinely sick to your stomach as she prepares to do the evil deed.I tore through this one in about three days.
(so it is better to read it all "in one breath").The novel is focused on the life of Dolores Claiborne, so strange and strong woman that tells his story in front of the policemen of her city (indeed she is accused of killing Vera Donovan, the woman she worked for).With the scrolling of the pages, i start to love Dolores more and more.
Retracing her life made me so sad, some of the thematics that she explain are so "strong" and they have made me thinking about what every day happens in the reality.
but also about her working relationship with Vera.We can consider this book very "deep" because of the thematics it talks about.
I think what I loved most is that the whole story is Dolores's confession to the police.
It starts out with her saying she understands her rights and then she just tells her story.
The story never goes from any other POV, it's simply her confession.
She goes on to tell the story of how she hadn't killed Vera but she did kill her husband.
Despite that, I truly believe that this story, and especially this audio, is not a story to be missed.
The way that the confession is done is really interesting.
It was such an interesting way to tell the story.
but as the novel reveals the secrets of Dolores' twisted, jerk of a husband and unstable daughter, it left me always thinking back to the people on the street and in town every day...
This is one of King's only novels that will take you behind closed doors into the life of a woman whose daughter was abused, whose husband was a pig and whose best friend was her snobby employer who knew what it was like to want revenge and respect.
Dolores Claiborne brings out the fear lurking in everyday family life and small towns where secrets hardly ever surface.
