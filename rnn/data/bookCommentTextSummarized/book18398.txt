Right now, what I want is the throne. Enzo’s power. A perfect revenge. And all the Inquisitors, queens, and Daggers in the world won’t be able to stop me. 4 1/2 stars. You know that feeling when a sequel is everything you wanted and more? That's exactly how I'm feeling right now. I honestly could not put this book down.This series just blows the Legend trilogy out of the water. I think Marie Lu has found her calling in dark fantasy and I hope she continues to write more. The Rose Society is fas
The Rose Society, as Lu points out in the afterword, takes Adelina down to an all new level of darkness.
Teren is undoubtedly the "villain" of this series and I feel like he will have to die before the series ends, and yet the fascinating complexity of his character makes me feel oddly disappointed about that.New perspectives and characters are introduced, but unlike the recent Queen of Shadows, they add thrills to the plot and don't bog it down with unnecessary density.
And the new choices and dilemmas are genuinely very exciting.The ending is as every ending should be mid-series.
Me after the first book:
Damn. Damn damn damn. That's all I can think really, because my thoughts are a blubbering mess. I have awaited this sequel for more than a year and now that I've finally had time to read it, I can assure you that The Rose Society does not disappoint. “Once upon a time, a girl had a father, a prince, a society of friends. Then they betrayed her, so she destroyed them all.” But I have not anticipated just how dark, twisted and, frankly put, sad the story will become. And at times, it was a little
Even after reading this book, he remains a partial enigma, but one so mysterious, sweet around the edges and mesmerizing that I cannot wait to see how the dynamic between him and Adelina will develop since, ahem, there is a potentially wonderful romance going on in here.
Life taught her how love is not going to keep you alive, but conquering and destroying will because no one will dare strike back to the most powerful of them all.
This must be what I fantasized about as a little girl, crouching on the stairs of my old home, pretending to wear a heavy crown on my head and look out at a sea of kneeling figures.”I think it’s safe to say that “The Rose Society” was an amazing rollercoaster of emotions and a more than just constant back and forth between the characters I started to love.
Adelina:”I have never known the mind of a wolf hunting a deer, but I imagine it must feel a little like this: the twisted excitement of seeing the weak and wounded cowering before you, the knowledge that, in this instant, you have the power to end its life or grant it mercy.
THE COVER GOT ME LIKE  I don't like the waiting.Especially when it comes to Marie Lu'books.
My revenge is complete.I force a smile onto my face. In the silence, I sit alone on my throne and wait eagerly for all the satisfaction and triumph to hit me. I wait, and wait, and wait.But it doesn’t come. Blurb: Adelina Amouteru’s heart has suffered at the hands of both family and friends, turning her down the bitter path of revenge. Now known and feared as the White Wolf, she and her sister flee Kenettra to find other Young Elites in the hopes of building her own army of allies. Her goal: t
Let’s do this!Adelina, ah, my Adelina… you are so going to die.I don’t want you to die because I rather love you but I can’t think of any possible outcome where you end up alive and well.
I think he’s a really strong addition to the book and I hope Marie Lu has more things for him because, in reality, he is everything Enzo was not and since I never saw Enzo and Adelina as endgame, I actually don’t feel there’s going to be a love endgame here so yeah, I’d love to see Adelina’s feelings getting stronger toward Magiano.
"They were the flash of light in a stormy sky, the fleeting darkness before dawn. Never have they excited before, nor shall they ever exist again."   -Young Elites.(YES, I LIKE TAKING PICTURES WITH MY BOOKS!)I've seen nothing but dazzling 5 stars review on The Rose Society, don't let it mislead you. This was far from perfect. It has its pros and cons, but i still enjoyed it very much. Most of you probably won't agree with me, and that's okay. I am more than happy to hear your opinion on the plo
-Young Elites.(YES, I LIKE TAKING PICTURES WITH MY BOOKS!)I've seen nothing but dazzling 5 stars review on The Rose Society, don't let it mislead you.
She had a shitty life, she tried making friends, she tried "the right way", but each time she was betrayed, no on was there to help her.
Though, i do understand his reasons, he actually might be right about everything considering the ending of the book *shivers*.
(hide spoiler)]While everyone else, except Adelina and Teren, was just meh, Raffaele was fucking annoying!
If there's something I didn't expect, it was to meet a female-lead who could equal Jorg of Ancrath's dark ambition.Saying that I didn't have great expectations before starting The Rose Society would be an understatement.
(Please don't make Magiano suffer too much, though) (I have a soft spot for LOVE this little thief) ➌ Truth is, what can be annoying is also great : this is my second book by Marie Lu, and I can safely say that I don't get her - I can't wrap my head around the direction she takes her stories, and it used to make me lose patience in The Young Elites, especially during the boring middle.
PAINSO MUCH PAINEVERYWHEREEVERYTHING HURTSBUT IT HURTS SO GOOD PAINPAINPAIN *breaks out in three days grace headbanging*
❝We are drawn to stories, and every scar carries one.❞ Rating: 5/5 ✩If I had to sum up my feelings towards finishing this book, towards the end, since the beginning, in the middle, it would simply be sad, mad, and proud. 3 simple words to sum up my emotions.This will probably be different and longer than most of my reviews, but here goes nothing...“Once upon a time, a girl had a father, a prince, a society of friends. Then they betrayed her, and she destroyed them all.Adelina Amouteru’s heart h
The Rose Society was a dark yet powerful sequel to  The Young ElitesI am surprised by how much Marie Lu decided to change it up.
(hide spoiler)] Character that received some hate from me.reviews now inspired by: Andie and Lissa Reason:I realized reviews should be talking about the book, how it caught my attention, what I did and didn't like about the book, the plot, what I enjoyed or didn't enjoy, not just emotions and feelings summed up into a whole paragraph.What's it about?The Rose Society picks up right where the Young Elites left off.
4.5 stars "What is so great about being good?" I have a teensy confession to make. The Young Elites isn't as good as I made it out to be in my review. If it weren't for the fact that Marie Lu wrote it and I have mad respect for the woman, it would've been a 3.5.But not The Rose Society. These five stars are fully, wholly merited.The reason? Adelina fucking Amouteru. "It is nice, being powerful. Seeing others others bend to your will. I imagine this how kings and queens feel—that with just a few
Obviously, she's going to give us a version in which each and every one of her misdeeds are justified, but I guarantee it'll look a hell lot less rosy from the opposing side's viewpoint.Magiano is a new character Adelina recruits for her crew to rival the Young Elites.
Did I mention he's a snarky son of a bitch and I love snarky sons of a bitches?He and Adelina have a thing, but romance isn't a huge part of the plot since revenge is on her mind 99.9% of the time.
(view spoiler)[Even though Enzo returns, I'm reluctant to call it a love triangle because of that reason.
So what do you think will happen next? Here's what I think.(view spoiler)[Enzo will be back from the dead. Because Maeve's going to 'pay Kenettra a visit'. But if ever Maeve brings Enzo back to life, he wouldn't be the same again. Where did Enzo's body go though? Idk... I forgot, I should read the first book again. Maeve might hide Enzo from the other Elites cause he will be the 'surprise, surprise'.  (hide spoiler)]Obviously, I am not too sure about it. But I really wish it'll happen.["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>
"Once upon a time, a girl had a father, a prince, a society of friends. Then they betrayed her, and she destroyed them all." It's only taken me five months to review this! Everything is fine!When I read this trilogy in January I instantly fell in love with it. I was shocked I'd heard so many negative reviews because I adored it - the tone, the characters, the plot, the complexity and the darkness of it. Six months on I still do feel as much passion and love for this series as I did then - and I
( by bpdrosalies on tumblr)The Young Elites is a dark fantasy following Adelina Amoteru, a girl who finds out she has the power to create illusions.
Plagued by dark thoughts and fuelled by her own rage - Adelina completely destroys the naive girl she was in The Young Elites and develops into a leader and power of her own, she's most definitely a force to be reckoned with.
The Young Elites is an exciting and unique series in the ya genre, which portrays characters who constantly flicker - they're eternally ambiguous and just when you think you're looking at them the right way they do something to surprise you.
<3 (Click her name for her awesome review.^^) On your special day, Alafiya, I wish you more peace, love, happiness, knowledge, friendship...and all that stuff that doesn’t cost anything.
Now, about the review   “Names give weight, reality to an idea.”  The introduction of the story with its imaginative painting of the setting and the characters including their wardrobe reminded me so much of my high school days when all I cared for was this Japanese anime called ”Fushigi Yuugi”.I keep picturing Rafaelle as Hotohori of Fushigi YuugiWhile I keep imagining Magiano looking like Amiboshi of the same animated show.
That was better than I ever could've hoped for.
*insert evil laughter here*My wishes came true.
I wanted Adelina to embrace her dark side more and she did.
I fucking love books that are from the point of view of the villain, and Adelina is so deliciously evil in this it was an absolute delight for me to see.
There was a contrived, obligatory love triangle added to this book, but it was so inconsequential that it was very easy to ignore.That ending was perfect.
I'm not gonna waste any time; I'm starting Midnight Star right away.
Dark and glorious. If I were a villain, Adelina would be goals.
“Someday, when I am nothing but dust and wind, what tale will they tell about me? Once upon a time, a girl had a father, a prince, a society of friends. Then they betrayed her, and she destroyed them all.”  Oh my god. I don't even have words for this. My head is spinning. My heart is beating so loud. My hands are shaking I can't put words into this review correctly. So I will start from my feeling towards this amazing book, which impressed me in many ways that I lost count. The Rose Society is
The book gave me the odd vibes I couldn't shake it off since the first chapter, it gradually poured its poison into my heart and twisted and twisted until I occasinally considered myself as a villain like the lead character.
Adelina was cast out but she doesn't give up on her purposes, she wants to be a queen and won't stop until she sits on her throne.
His character interested me since the first book to this one.

I will keep you until the day I choose not too.
You have destroyed and harm all that is dear to me.
In return, I want you to know what that feels like.
I will not kill you.
I will keep you alive.
I will torture you.
Until your soul is dead"WOWWWW!!!!!
THIS BOOK WAS FANTASTIC.
I LIKED LOVED IT SOOOOOO FREAKING MUCH.Marie Lu you are a writing GoddessMe when I started this book
Me at the end of this book
Guys for those of you, who haven't picked this sequel up as yet to The Young Elites ~~~ What the Hell are you waiting For!!
*4.5*
EPIC Sh*t!!! So Dark. and Vicious. and Intense. Shocking moments and Heart-breaking all over again. The character developments are phenomenal!!! I love it, I LOVE many things. Worth-waiting, yeah!
Once upon a time, a girl had a father, a prince, a society of friends. Then they betrayed her, and she destroyed them all. I don’t know exactly how I feel about this book. I mean… I really liked it! It was fast-paced and addictive. It was also really dark, wow, Adelina blew me away! The last chapter left me without words! What I don’t know is if I liked this one better than the first one (or if is the other way around), I mean, The Young Elites and The Rose Society are two VERY different books,
What I don’t know is if I liked this one better than the first one (or if is the other way around), I mean, The Young Elites and The Rose Society are two VERY different books, and in each of them we get to know a different set of characters, and while I think I liked more this book, I really missed the Daggers, especially Raffaele.
(view spoiler)[As I don't ship this new Enzo with Adelina (their kisses felt SO wrong) (But I still love Enzo) (hide spoiler)].I'm looking forward the next book, this is one of the few series/trilogies that I have absolutely NO idea of how it would end!
The cover has been revealed. Hmm, not sure how I feel about it. I like it more than the first one though.WHY CAN'T THIS BOOK COME OUT SOONER!!!!!??????  I JUST FINISHED THE FIRST ONE AND NEED THE SECOND ONE NOW!!!!!!! THE FIRST BOOK!!!!
4.5 dark starsConfused decisions , panicked emotions, betrayal, destroyed childhood, a craving for love!Yes, this is Adelina Amouteru, the cast-out elite who dearly feels the absence of her friends and is ready to fill the gaping void with revenge.
(view spoiler)[the author added realism to her character by making her untrustworthy of even Violetta in the end and denying herself of Magiano's love (hide spoiler)]But the the dark recesses of Adelina's narrative is just the tip of iceberg!
“I pledge myself to the Rose Society until the end of my days,To use my eyes to see all that happens.My tongue to woo others to our side.My ears to hear every secret.My hand to crush my enemies.I will do everything in my power to destroy all who stand in my way.”  Story ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐After the duel everything changes for Adelina. Being used, betrayed and cast out she flees with Violetta to another city. There she tries to find allies who help her succeed her goal- to get revenge on Teren and the Queen a
Love it ♥️And the ending left me like that: 😨😭😱😳🤯💔🔥☠️Characters ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ “I have never known the mind of a wolf hunting a deer, but I imagine it must feel a little like this: the twisted excitement of seeing the weak and wounded cowering before you, the knowledge that, in this instant, you have the power to end its life or grant it mercy.
World ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ “The gods created the blood fever (...) and so they also created the marked and the Elite.”  Next to our known capital Estenzia we get to see some new places in this world.But the best of all is that new characters are introduced: a queen, a mercenary, a thief and new and old powers mix together to be the force to push the queen from the throne.
Adelina is such an antihero, and the way that her darkness consumes her and the way that it can be read as a metaphor for mental illness (at least, the way I interpret it sometimes) I think is just really chilling and well done.
The reason I took off a star is because I listened to this on audio, and while the narrators were actually spectacular and it was done nicely, I kept getting distract and so my listening experience with this was extremely choppy and therefore it took me a while to read this and I would forget things that happened, etc.
It's also been a while since I read book one.
Wow. Wow.
Wow. First off, this is definitely not your normal book 2.
It is filled with plotting and treachery and delicious twists.
I've loved Adelina from the beginning.
She's strong and still stubborn and she isn't afraid to fight for what she wants.
Even if everyone else thinks it's wrong.
However, the Adelina in this book is a little bitter and fairly mean.
It's definitely quite darker than the first book.
There are some excellent new characters and some really shocking things that I didn't see coming.
The ending isn't a horrible cliffhanger, but it absolutely makes me want book 3 right now.
Loved this! If you didn't like the 1st book in this trilogy I would highly recommend you still read this one! There's alot more action, more world building and a ton more darkness!
3.75 stars. Oh my god I'm so shook, what on earth was that ending? That ending was a huge ball of what-the-fuck and just....my god, I'm speechless. This book was pretty dull throughout and Adelina was an annoying pain in the ass, but the last 25% of this book made up for that.Full RTC.
www.melissa413readsalot.blogspot.comAs those of you that have read the book know, Adelina is fighting her darker side, but she doesn't seem to be winning.
She's loving all of the evil things she is doing and a lot of them I agree with because most of the people are evil anyway.
But with Magiano...I am able to smile, even to laugh.
Adelina does some things that bring these new people to her side.
There are some evil queens in the book too and they are all fighting for the throne as well as someone else.
Makes me wonder what is going to happen in the next book!!
You thought you loved The Young Elites?
The Rose Society picks up right where The Young Elites left off.
Adelina and Violetta have left Kenettra and are in search of recruits to enlist into their own new society of Elites.
The Young Elites was just the beginning of making a villain.
Personally, I have never read a book where it's mainly told from the perspective of a villain which is why I love it so much!
Everyone who read and loved the first book will rest assured that this follow up does not disappoint!
And I loved the surprise of new information regarding the elites and their powers.
