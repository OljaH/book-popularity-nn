This collection of short stories by Bulosan has been frequently compared to Steinbeckâ€™s Tortilla Flats .
I can certainly understand why, though I imagine Bulosan would be upset by the comparison.
The stories are based in the Philippines and follow a young boy who is smart and likes to drink wine as his family attempts to survive the economic effects of colonialism in the Philippines.
They were certainly better than the collection  The Philippines Is in the Heart  which included many stories cut from this collection.
I really appreciated that the short stories worked together and progressed almost like a novel.
i need to read this please help me!
I think its best for the filipino people to read this specially to those who are in the other country. By reading this, they can reminisce their old life in their own country(Philippines) .
