I don't know why, I don't know how, but I ended up loving this book!
That's not to be taken lightly, because I never - or should I say, almost never - forgive a hero who raises his hand against the heroine.As for Jennifer, I had mixed feelings about her throughout the book - sometimes I wanted to hug her, sometimes I wanted to scream at her - but I ended up understanding and loving her too.
I didn't always agree with everything Royce and Jennifer did but, in a sense, their actions were consistent and "right".
I was rendered speechless by the Merrick family/clan dynamic and while yes, I know it is just a story, thier motives and reasonings were written so well that there was no doubt in my mind all of those underhanded, deceitful things could really have taken place.Royce is an amazing man.
In my eyes, he is the perfect hero.Jenny annoyed the hell out of me from the very beginning with her lack of loyalty to Royce, and her terribly misplaced devotion and trust in her clan and family.
Huge 5+ starsKingdom of Dreams is one of the best books I've read! The story is full of vibrant and richly developed characters, a plot that's riveting, emotional, provocative, and a prose that's exceptionally well written. To top it off, this book has one of the best ending I've read. It was amazing, extremely poignant, and very powerful. I'm still an emotional mess hours later. Judith McNaught is an exceptional storyteller and I'm embarrassed it's taken me so long to read one of her books.
5+++ STARS!!!!!!!!!! ABSOLUTELY SENSATIONAL[image error] I just have to start off by saying that this may be my all time favorite stand alone romance book… EVER.!!!!! No kidding. I wasn’t even planning to read it quite yet. But I had gotten the paperback a while ago and it’s been sitting on my nightstand ever since. So the other night, I was having a little trouble sleeping and my ipad was downstairs… so I picked up this book. And I said to myself.. “I’ll just read the first chapter and see what
Lord Royce Westmoreland, the earl of Claymore, also known as the Black Wolf, who is a legend in the land, know for his ruthlessness and his cruelty.[image error]
At least until he met his match in a little Scottish lass of 17.[image error]
A complete contradiction.[image error]
If fact it’s all she really craved, to be loved by her father, her kinsman, and her God. More than anything, she just wanted to be known for the good person she was.[image error]
5 DREAMY STARS… Loved this one. This is the second book I have read by this author and it will not be the last.Royce Westmoreland .aptly named THE WOLFScottish and English wars and hatred have abounded for years.THOR, his trusted stallionCan he tame the lovely Jennifer or will she be the one to tame the Wolf?(The artist who painted this one was actually from my home village in the West of Ireland)Loved Jennifer, she was so feisty, independent, loyal, beautiful … "My own kingdom … I used to plan
“The amusement fled from Royce's face and with a groan he pulled her roughly against his chest, crushing her to him.
Leaning back slightly against his arm, her melting blue eyes gazing deeply into his, his wife replied in a shaky voice, "I think, my lord, I love you more.”
"'Tis a habit I have."Startled and slightly amused, Royce said, "Really?
What did God have to say?""I think," she softly replied, "He said, 'You're welcome.' ""For what?" Royce teased.Lifting her eyes to his, Jenny solemnly replied, "For you.”
A Kingdom of Dreams by Judith McNaught:3 “More *Galavant Than *The Tudors” Stars.     Hells yeah, I want to go there! I don’t really have a choice. Before cracking open, A Kingdom of Dreams, I read Teresa Denys’ masterpiece, *The Silver Devil, and in a Medieval romance face-off; McNaught’s version loses hands down. To be fair, the two authors have very different writing styles: The Silver Devil, is dark, gritty, and authentic to the time period; while, A Kingdom of Dreams, is modish, amusing, a
Before cracking open, A Kingdom of Dreams, I read Teresa Denys’ masterpiece, *The Silver Devil, and in a Medieval romance face-off; McNaught’s version loses hands down.
In television terms, The Silver Devil, is The Tudors; whereas, A Kingdom of Dreams, is Galavant.
'When you're angry, they're the color of wet blue velvet.' Jenny rolled her eyes in disgust.
* 2.5 I'm-really-getting-tired-of-this stars *This really should have been titled Taming of the Shrew- Part II Or A Kingdom of Hell & Misery. No? Too harsh? How about this: Well this sucks. Another McNaught favorite among many that I did not love. I feel like I should put out a disclaimer or apologize to my GR friends for clogging up your feeds with my negative reviews & low ratings as of late. I promise you I'm NOT doing it on purpose. I’m not one of those reviewers. I’ve been in a seri
I kept having to remind myself that Jenny is only a 17 year-old sheltered girl but still, with that age and her attitude...she took a lot of arrogant liberties and quick to believe misassumptions that made me wish someone would slap some sense and humility into her.
That's fine since she exceeds at writing tortured conflicted multi-layered characters I can overlook it but I'd like a little more variety is all I'm saying.
I’m not sure if the heroine’s groveling and humbling herself in the VERY last chapter was worth the ridiculous amount of strife and misery the hero, the couple and the readers are put through.
I liked that she was figuring out ways to escape her kidnappers.
But, after a while, she got real old real fast.I get that she didn't like her kidnapper, Royce.
Considering how women were treated back then, it was like she won the lottery or something.So, she ends up having to marry Royce (not a spoiler, happens first page of the book) and she acts like it's a death sentence.
Oh no, I have to marry the guy that is rich, adores me, has treated me like a princess, and is great in the sack!
And when Royce's brother, Stefan, kidnaps Jennifer and her sister, Brenna, things become personal in more ways than one.
It was wonderful reading about Royce and Jennifer falling for each other and all the conflicting emotions going on definitely made things more interesting.
It always made me laugh how all Royce had to do was start kissing her and she melted especially considering some of the harsh things he said to her!I got a big kick out of all the escapes in the beginning and all the little pranks Jennifer did.
Brenna and Stefan were great to read about, as well as several of Royce's knights.
“You are mad!” she snapped, her chest heaving. “And you are a devil!” “And you, my dear,” Royce imperturbably replied, “are a bitch.” With that, he turned to the horrified friar and unhesitatingly announced, “The lady and I wish to be wed.” This is an oldy but a goody. I love these enemies-to-lovers stories, and JM seems to dish them out on silver platters. She always has the perfect amount of conflict to keep me invested. Not to mention, her heroes make me drool. I'll admit that this isn't my
“And you are a devil!” “And you, my dear,” Royce imperturbably replied, “are a bitch.” With that, he turned to the horrified friar and unhesitatingly announced, “The lady and I wish to be wed.”
I love these enemies-to-lovers stories, and JM seems to dish them out on silver platters.
Bad ass heroine meets bad ass hero.
The heroine was sent to an abbey, although she isn't nun quality in the least.
She gets captured and taken to Royce's camp.
But a misunderstanding has them hating one another, while they are forced into a marriage...A great one by McNaught that you shouldn't miss if you love medieval.
5+ CAPTIVATING STARS"Jenny, I love you.""I think, my lord, I love you more."This book was an exhilarating start to the Westmoreland saga.
Royce (the Black Wolf) Westmoreland, the Duke of Claymore find his destiny when his brother Stefan, kidnaps Jenny and her sister from her convent school wearing a nun's outfit of all things.
Royce is captivated by the brave and proud Jenny.
Every scene in this book was captivating and engaging.
The scene that will always stand out for me is when her family fight Royce in a type of mock battle.
How is it possible that it keeps getting better?!
One of the best fight-to-the-finish love stories!
The last six paragraphs in the book, before the epilogue, where Royce contemplates the recent events in his life, just undid me.
A wonderful journey, as Royce and Jenny discover that you can't always believe what you hear...sometimes it's just better to listen to your heart!
Yes Taryn, I am in love with this book too!
“His hair was black and his black cloak was billowing out behind him, blowing eerily in the wind as if it had a life of its own.
Royce “The Wolf” Westmoreland
DNF - 11%Bad, bad Alex! You should really stop trying to read Outlander-like books. They are not for you.You see, I really enjoy a historical romance every now and then, so I'm fully aware that this kind of books tend to be misogynistic (time period and all that). I can overlook it. What I deeply dislike is when the physical punishment of the woman is involved. I'm beginning to understand that this is a huge pet peeve for me, so I'm going to avoid it from now on.
AMAZING, fabulous, OUTSTANDING read, that deserves a happy dance! **Some spoilers ahead**  To say I was captivated from beginning to end, is a serious understatement. I physically couldn't stop myself from devouring every word written. Not to add any updates or even add this book to my CR list. My eyes were drying out (seriously, I used eyes drops) from not blinking enough and lack of sleep. It wasn't a pretty sight... This historical romance sure didn't feel historical to me. It was so easy to
_________________________Jennifer Merrick aka Jenny, is a stubborn redheaded witch lass, known for her bravery and skill at aggravating and challenging a certain warrior to the point of no return.Royce Westmoreland aka The Wolf, is a handsome fierce warrior, known for his murderous and barbarian ways.
He's feared by all...except for the stubborn and exasperating Jenny.
So being a headstrong 'Merrick' lass, Jenny lifts her chin with pride as she bites the Wolf, then knees him in the balls.Who could blame her for all the trouble and amusement Royce endures during her captivity.
So go READ this book...
Thanks Ash for the recommendation or I wouldn't have read it otherwise and that would be a shame! Also a pat on the back for me since I found this gem at Half-priced books.This story can best be summarized with two words:  Total escapism!!!!  There's a reason historical romance reigns ahead on my favorite genre list and A Kingdom of Dreams is the perfect example! I loved the family/clan dynamics, court politics, and the depth the author portrayed these complex characters. This story was exactly
This story was exactly what I needed to get away from all the terrible contemporary romance I've been reading.
Her clan loyalty was admirable, but terribly misguided!
How could she be so clever when it came to escaping, tricking Royce again and again, but not see that her father and family didn't care about her, just the value she could bring to them??
There was a scene close to the end where I was just about to say "EFF this SHIT, if something doesn't happen soon, this book will end up in the fireplace" but thank goodness Jenny came to her senses.
Seriously. This book was just what I needed. I adored every page. Review to come.
This review was originally posted on Addicted To Romance The Kingdom of Dreams is the first book of the Westmoreland Saga.
I read this book many years ago, and I had this on my list to re read, and since my library didn't have it any longer, I decided I would need to buy it and well worth it in the end!!
I loved everything about this book.
At first it started out a bit slow, and I was a bit worried that I wouldn't love it as much as I did when I read it the first time.
I read this book many years ago, and I had this on my list to re read, and since my library didn't have it any longer, I decided I would need to buy it and well worth it in the end!!
Kingdom of Dreams is a story that draws two people together, that build a kingdom of their own...a Kingdom of Dreams---full of life, love and laughter.A Compelling and Riveting romance to keep you on your toes and make every nerve ending come alive!!
In willingly surrendering her honor to him, she would become a harlot; a disgrace to herself, her family, and all she held dear.-Jennifer pleading to Royce to free her sister, Brenna, who fell ill at the castle."Do we have a bargain?" he asked calmly.
I could have taken you by force any time these past days." Jennifer knew that, and although her resentment remained, she had to fight against falling under the deep spell of his voice as he continued, "I want you, and if that makes me a barbarian in your eyes, so be it, but it doesn't have to be that way.
I stayed up until 3 in the morning, knowing that I wouldn't finish, because I literally couldn't put this book down.
It took the best attributes from a strong-willed female heroine and the very best attributes from an alpha male hero and put them into THIS BOOK.
I don't even really know what to say.
So often, there is only a surface level reality to books set hundreds of years ago.
But I swear I was hearing thundering hoof beats while I read this.
This is the first that I've read by Judith McNaught, and I'm pretty distraught right now that she hasn't written hundreds of books.
It took me a little while to finish this reread of a book that was a fav for me when I first started out reading HRs, years ago.
It was also a rare (for me) medieval read, being set in the late 1400s.Royce, Earl of Claymore, is an English warrior known as "The Wolf'.
Royce and Jenny fall in love fairly early on, but they are torn apart by various misunderstandings and events.
A lot of it is related to Jenny's incredible loyalty to her father.
She is torn between this, and her love of Royce, the 'enemy' Englishman.
It's not till quite late in the book that the scales fall from Jennifer's eyes.
"A Kingdom of Dreams" is regarded as one of the best love stories by numerous romance novels fans.
This book had some decent, at times funny dialog between 2 main characters, the bedroom scenes were fairly steamy without being graphic, but other than that, it was a typical historical romance novel with a very formulaic story line.
The hero naturally takes the heroine's virginity, and she is too willing to give it up, even though they are not married and he is her enemy.
The story naturally ends with HEA, when all difficulties are resolved and a baby is born.The bottom line is, if you are a romance fan, I expect you will enjoy this book very much.
In front of seven thousand onlookers, Jennifer Merrick Westmoreland, countess of Rockbourn, knelt before her husband in a public act of humble obedience, her face pressed to his hand, her shoulders wrenched with violent sobs.
It's actually the prequel to Whitney, My Love and it tells the story of Royce Westmoreland and the proud Scottish beauty, Jennifer Merrick (yes, another proud heroine).
Damn it would've been nice to learn more about the intriguing, abrupt giant.Although I can no longer say all of Judith McNaught's books are for sure five-star reads after reading Someone to Watch Over Me, I think I can still say that her historical romances are in a class of their own.Rate: 5 stars
This story is filled with a perfect blend of romance, adventure, struggle and devotion.Jennifer Merrick is the daughter of a Scottish chieftain and is abducted from her convent school by her father’s sworn enemy, Royce Westmoreland, Duke of Claymore.
Despite these opposing forces, Royce and Jennifer develop an overwhelming love for each other wrapped with passion and loyalty that should never exist between enemies.Royce is the perfect chivalrous character that you can easily fall in love with.
Jennifer is creatively developed as a proud, courageous and willful character that is the perfect opposition to Royce.
I'm like that sometimes."A KINGDOM OF DREAMS has everything I want in a story, be it historical or not, and that includes incredible characters that are layered and multi-faceted, emotional arcs, twists, strong heroines, broody misunderstood heroes, and a delicious fluctuating hate to love relationship that develops into one of the best, more enduring feeling, romances ever.
What did God have to say?""I think He said, 'You're welcome'.""For what?""For you."I'll admit there was one tiny little issue I had with the William situation; one that I had hoped to have a different explanation but alas..
I enjoyed the small gang that accompanied everyone, from the brother-mother-drama to the loyal compadres standing by the side.
Besides family drama on the side of the hero, there is the background of cruelty Jennifer faced and why she ended up in this situation in the first place.
If you're a fan of Historical Romance, you should dig this once since it stays interesting through the storyline, holds up the pacing, has sarcastic and humorous main characters who feel genuine enough to carry their story, complimentary side characters, a castle (yays) and satisfying ending.Look forward to checking out more of this author.
Love is not a strong enough word to describe how I feel about this book!5 HUGE, DREAMY STARS!!!!!!!!!!!!Many people have read this book and I seem to be in the minority of those who haven't until now.
I love HR but this is in a class of it's own!
Breathtaking and incredibly thick with layers and plot twists, this is the best HR I've read to date.
I couldn't understand how I didn't read this sooner.
BEAUTIFULINTENSEHEART-BREAKINGSENSUALPROVOCATIVEI can't put into words how utterly incredible this was...but I can say I ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT!Please read this if you haven't, it will change you.
I am highly disappointed in the build-up, only for it to end that way. I had expected way more for that ending than the one we got. The book was alright, enjoyable even, for like 30 (+-)% of the book, but then I started to lose respect for Jennifer Merrick (17). I ended up with feeling a somewhat hatred towards her, which is not a good thing. She also didn't gain back my trust, which perhaps is why I'm very disappointed with how thing happened.   “The groom always smiles proudly because he's con
I ended up with feeling a somewhat hatred towards her, which is not a good thing.
The only thing I did like about this book was Royce Westmoreland (29).
I also didn't like that how Royce was made out to be this brutal, ruthless and dangerous, when all he was doing was following his king's orders and being good at it.
Even the nickname “The Wolf” didn't fit Royce's description, as all I could see was a man who was falling in love.
(hide spoiler)]Favorite character?
- Royce WestmorelandWould I read more by this author/or of series?
***10****After reading it for maybe the hundredth time, I declare "A kingdom of dreams" to be the best historical of all time!!!The spellbinding quality of Mcnaught's narrations, how she magically weaves a story/characters that transport you to another time and place is unique just to her!!I always wished for movies to be made out of her HRs'..well since that has not yet been done,i'll try a little bit something here with my imagination...(WTH even if it gets a bit cheesy;))"ROYCE WESTMORELAND" *sigh* My hero!!
"Jenny, I love you."She melted against him, molding her body to the rigid contours of his, offering her lips up for his fierce, devouring kiss, then she took his face between both her hands.
4.5 StarsSuch a beautiful story! I loved it! This is historical romance at its finest. The characters were solidly developed and the writing was just superb. It was packed with love, suspense, adventure and lessons to be learned. I fell in love with these characters and I'm sad to see them go.
No género de romance até gostei deste livro. Mas apesar da parte pseudo-histórica, para mim não deixa de ser um romance cor de rosa. Simpático sim, com personagens principais com alguma piada, dai recomendar vivamente a quem gosta do género
