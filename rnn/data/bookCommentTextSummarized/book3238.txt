In my opinion this is not a story you can read as an illustrated version. It was really confusing and some chapters stopped abruptly without any reason. I stopped reading the book, when I was completely confused and lost my interest in it.Probably gonna read the normal book. 🤷🏻♀

This got an extra star for the ending, otherwise it would've been 3.5 stars rounded up to a 4. This is my first Agatha Christie book, and I feel like I'm cheating since it's a graphic novel. But I still enjoyed it. Excellent ending.
Although I much prefer Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's writing style over that of Agatha Christie, I cannot deny that it did provide a bit of a surprising plot twist. Even so, when put side by side to Sherlock Holmes' observation powers, I still believe that Poirot is miles behind. Moreover, 'guessing' doesn't stand a chance against deductive reasoning, as is specific to Sherlock. The ending seems appropriate for such a story type, despite the fact that it seems most surreal and implausible and doesn't exactly provide a healthy view of justice.All in all, an entertaining addition to any home library.
4 stars!She done it again, a simple yet a clever plot.
Delightful.
The comic version of Murder on the Orient Express is very good and excellent if you are new to Christie and want to get a flavour of the her work without committing to the original novel.
I love Sherlock Holmes, just enjoy the character, his precise skits and the crazy figure that minimizes the story all around.But I didn't have a book of Holmes, so I took another.I was in a mood for an old-fashioned thriller.
All this and more I have found here, in this flawed and fun thriller that, though written decades ago, was amusing and surprising to me, and at the end, it was interrupted in a moment when a great moral stench rose from it and challenged me, mainly because I agreed with it unconditionally.It was a pleasure, but I still prefer Sherlock Holmes.
This was all going really well until we got to the over simplified and rushed ending. The whole point is that it's supposed to be a challenge for Poirot because of his obligation to justice and also his obligation to his human instincts. I would liked to have seen an extra ten pages added to explore this.
A detective investigates a murder committed on a train.I thought this retelling of a classic murder mystery (the original is well known and a very strong story) was good, but the graphics and narrative layout could have been better.Rating 3.5
I read the stage play of this and loved the adaptation. Although I thought the illusion of suicide was a little too dark for this time, I was on edge trying to figure out who was the murderer and quite surprised at the twist at the end.
AMAZING STORY!Excellent plot, very deep characters.
A decent, if quick adaptation of the novel by Agatha Christie. The art is fresh and bright and seems to fit the time period and tone of the novel well. I would recommend this to Agatha Christie fans and anyone who might be interested in reading Christie but can't commit to a full novel or one of the myriad of TV and film adaptations.
Engaging story, excellent character development. But lacks certain natural expression since the story takes place in a train.
Preferred the novel, but this was nice enough..
I have not read a lot of Agatha Christie and I was interested to read this one. It is very.... classically detective and does not pretend to be anything else. The ending I found VERY odd.

After being disappointed by The Murder Of Roger Ackroyd, I was pleasantly surprised by this installation in the series. The train setting and distinctive cast of characters lend themselves well to the graphic novel format, and the nature of the mystery means that nothing important is lost if you can't keep track of every hint that's uncovered. Christie's story is a wild ride, and this adaptation does it a decent amount of justice.
Assisted by Dr. Constantine, a greek doctor, who determines COD (stabbed 12 times in various angles and with different amounts of strength) and Director Bouc, Poirot starts his investigation by interviewing all passengers and the staff as well.
As much as Ratchett or Casetti deserved what he got, Poirot takes up the challenge to find out who helped fate along and took justice in his or her own hands.“Murder on the Orient Express” is one of the well known Agatha Christie mysteries about the Belgian detective Hercule Poirot.
Murder on the Orient Express by Agatha Christie and adapted for the big screenAnother version of this note and thoughts on other books are available at:- https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list... and http://realini.blogspot.ro/This is a new note on an old story.I have seen this adaptation again and therefore a new look on the work, with different angles to consider.First of all, the cast was superb and normally it could not have been any better:- Albert Finney in the lead role of Hercule Poirot-

I think it was very clever of them to adapt Agatha Christie's crime novels into comic book form.
MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS was the first 'Agatha Christie Comic Strip' book that I read and I thought it was just okay.
Instead he has to cram his work into small, tight panels.
Also, a lot of the time you can't even see his beautiful artwork because they're obscured by the word balloons, necessary in a comic book admittedly, but it could have been better if he was given just 6 panels per page instead.
O primeiro livro que li neste formato.
Em prosa somos nós que imaginamos o cenário todo, as personagens, as suas expressões, etc através das descrições da autora, em BD tudo está desenhado da forma que o desenhador imagina a história, nós leitores só temos de seguir a história através das falas das personagens.Gostei mas gosto mais de livros em prosa, mais detalhados mais construídos por mim.
Gostei da história mas pretendo lê-la em prosa, acho que deve ser bem melhor, uma vez que apenas posso avaliar a ideia da autora para a construção da história e não a sua escrita.
Hercule Poirot a private detective and retired Belgian police officer, the best private eye of the 1930s,has one day to solve a case.
He is on the orient express and the rich american Mr.Ratchett is dead, murdered in the middle of the night.
The window is left open in Ratchett's compartment.
A handkerchief with the initial "H" is found in the compartment, a pipe cleaner, a round match different from the matches Ratchett used and a charred piece of paper with the name "Armstrong" on it.
Murder on the orient express is about love, revenge and life.
One of Agatha Christie's most famous Poirot mysteries.
A man is murdered on the Orient Express train while it is stuck in a snow drift.
But Poirot soon realizes everything and everyone are not as they seem.This one is a great mystery to spark a moral debate.
And even though the murder victim is shown, the blood looks more like grape juice stains so it shouldn't traumatize younger readers.Notes on content: No language issues.
As mentioned, you see the stab marks on the murder victim but it isn't gory.
Other deaths are mentioned but not shown.
3.5 StarsDidn't enjoy the story or the illustrations as much as I did with the first Queen of Crime Novel I read, Murder at the Vicarage.
It would be cool if I could read French, since this is translated from French and I assume the illustrator and the author/adapter too is French.
I read this rather fast and may need to go back and revisit things, or read it again.
It deserves to be read in candid detail and hopefully, if I read it again or even the real, actual novel, mu understanding of the novel will improve.
I’ve never read anything by Agatha Christie before, and I wouldn’t call myself a major mystery fan, but I really enjoyed Murder on the Orient Express.From the start, Murder on the Orient Express pulls you in and keeps you guessing.Sometimes I figure a mystery out too quickly, and that’s no fun. This book really surprised me. I also appreciated that for being a murder mystery, it’s not gory or gruesome.{Read my full review here}
This book is all about Time. The author constantly brings out the theme of time in his characters schedules, and the whole plot is dependent on it. The story takes place on a long train ride, and then all of a sudden, the train stops in a blizzard and is stuck in the middle of nowhere-with a murderer on board. Evidence is laid out and collected as the story goes on, and you get to know all of the characters-the ending is really really inconceivable!
ممتعه بطريقة مش طبيعيةقرأتها من فترة مش قصيرةوقتها مش كتبت عليها تعليقلانى كنت منبهره بيها فـ كان ممكن ده يكون تعليق غير حيادىبس فعلا مش قادرة افتكر ولو جزء صغير مش عجبنى فيهاتظل طول الرواية تفكر من القاتل وتفكيرك ينتقل من شخص لاخرولكنك بالتاكيد وبالرغم من كل ذلك لن تتوقع القاتل أبداً !!فكرتها رائعه ..من أكثر الروايات اللى أشبعت رغبتى فى نهاية غير متوقعه
Yet another best from Christie. I am sure Poirot is going to be my next stay-always character, in my mind. Poirot's skill for mystery solving is well described by the author. It is gripping, with a well conceived ending. I am sure this book, would be a good read for anyone looking for sheer intellect, well crafted conversations and a thrilling usage of the 'little grey cells'. :)
This was by far my favorite Agatha Christie novel so far. I have to admit, I only read it because I watched a Dr. Who episode that parodied the novel, so I was intrigued to see how closely it followed the original. I think it's safe to say that this one will definitely blow your mind; I did not see that ending coming!
G baca d kamar mba roos coz bukunya nganggur dan kebetulan g kangen berat ma Poirot (detektif kesayangan g neh!)ceritanya tetep bagus tapinya g sedikit kuciwa ma gambar Poirot. seinget g Poirot itu detektif yang tampangnya selalu d tertawakan karena kepalanya berbentuk bulat telur, pendek dan kumis yang besar. tapi secara keseluruhan, okelaaaah...
