Authors, take note. This is how a companion novel is done! You see, freedom has a way of destroying things.  Aya Fuse is just fifteen-years-old but already, the world has radically changed since Tally Youngblood freed everyone. Just a few years ago, it was standard for all kids (16 and up) to get the Pretty surgery - where their faces and bodies were altered to be statistically perfect. Only, there was a dark side to this surge. The doctors would also implant a few lesions in choice spots of the
From tech-heads to surge-monkeys, Aya's city has it all.
And all Aya wants is 1) become Pretty and 2) kick the biggest story ever.Her older brother is a great Kicker - he brings light to many, many events throughout the city and spends life in luxury from the merits he earned.Aya spent her entire life looking up to him, wanting to be him, and now she finally has the chance.
I loved how all the tech expanded and really grew wild in this world.And, above all, I loved Moggle (Aya's old, outdated hovercam with a hilarious personality).
My years as a student steeped in cultural studies and gender theory make it pretty much impossible for me to read works of popular fiction without subjecting them to critical analysis, and Westerfeld's books certainly lend themselves to this sort of critique.
In all of these books, the main (female) character desperately wants to be pretty, special, popular, famous or whatever, but ends up questioning the values of her society when she meets outsiders who don't subscribe to those norms.
I really struggled to finish this book, and I thought it was significantly worse than the others in the series.
The characters actually said things like "Not good!" and "uh, oh!" to react to approaching falling objects and other imminent bumps-on-the-head.
At one point, characters from two different countries meet and have some communication difficulties.
Sloppy writing, I say.Thoughout the series, the characters were pretty one-sided.
Neither Aya nor Tally were very strong characters, and the "ew, bugs and mud!" part of this book really annoyed me.
To sum up: There were some really good, interesting, creative ideas in the Uglies series, but they weren't good books.
Ugh. Finally done.This is how this book made me feel;because it was such a disappointment. and maybe a bit of this;because it was so boring. and also;because...well, it fucking sucked. I've noticed that I've been rating these 'Uglies' books in a pattern:Uglies: 5 StarsPretties: 4 StarsSpecials: 3 StarsExtras: 2 StarsToo bad they don't have a fifth one. If that had sucked as bad as this one, I would have loved to give that a one star, then the pattern would be complete.
Honestly, this book was kind of a disappointment. I liked how it was all accumulated around the Japanese society, but other than that, I was expecting much more of this book. In my opinion, Aya is a very whiny, self-absorbed suck up. I don't like the way Scott Westerfeld portrays Tally in this either because he renders her as a know-it-all b word, to say the least. Which, I don't think Tally has ever been. Her character is not put to justice in this book.
Extras is the fourth book in Scott Westerfeld's critically acclaimed, New York Times bestselling series (originally it was a trilogy).
The trilogy, however, sets the framework for everything that happens in Extras so while the book is great on its own it definitely assumes you know the story of the trilogy.In this new world, where everything is changing, being pretty isn't enough to get by.
Westerfeld raises a lot of interesting questions as Aya deals with the ethics of kicking her new story and tries to decide if honesty really is more important than fame.You can find this review and more on my blog Miss Print
You know this book started out okay but it quickly went down hill.
I also quickly got annoyed at Aya. The Uglies series was my first exposure to Westerfeld and though I really liked Uglies and liked Pretties and pretty much liked Specials I gotta say i'm noticing a pattern with his characters.
They all want something superficial and they strive (like with Tally) and are willing to sell out people to get it.
Grant it most of the times (not with Extras though) the characters realize that they were wrong in wanting the superficial.
Finishing a series always makes me feel like I'm losing a friend.
I've spent a good week or so reading these four books, absorbed in the pages and the characters and their lives, and now I just feel lonely.
Japan is all about face rank now, a little like a city-sized YouTube, with everyone sporting a hovercam and a feed to broadcast whatever they think will boost their rank.
Fifteen-year-old Aya is ranked around 400,000, making her a total extra, however she uncovers a secret clique, the Sly Girls, which she is certain will bump her to the top.
sigh, Zane <3)A great ending, but like I first said...
I liked Aya Fuse (cool name) and her brother, Hiro, and his friend, Ren. I liked the whole premise of popularity and fame being a commodity for living.I can't believe that I am saying this, but I didn't really like Tally in this book!
The whole second half of the story was flat for me.Westerfeld could have left in me in Aya Fuse's city and in her apartment in Shuffle Mansion with Moggle and I would have been much more satisfied.I wish that the authors of popular series, would take a little more thought about their story lines before they quickly release their sequels.
When is it ever a good idea to add a fourth installment to a trilogy?
Aya Fuse wants to become famous by "kicking" a story that will attract everyone's attention, just like her brother, Hiro.
To be honest, I liked Aya better than Tally.
I think the best he did was with Tally and Zayn, but Tally and David and Aya and Frizz seemed to luck chemistry, and the romance was underdeveloped.Other than those two facts, that cost the book two stars, Extras was a great book.
I like that the author gives us food for thought through his teen adventure stories and characters that one can easily fall in love with and relate to.
Ugh. I kind if hated Aya. She was whiny and no matter what situation came up, no matter how dire, ALL SHE CARED ABOUT WAS IF HER CAMERA WAS CATCHING IT.
And I thought the Sly girls were going to be some huge awesome part of the book, but all that happens is they act like they don't know what's going on, then launch Aya into the sky, tell her they knew she was lying, and then tell her that OH YEAH IT'S FIIINNNE.
Aya's "relationship" also just kind of happened, and it didn't build up AT ALL.
I loved all of your other books (Peeps, Uglies, Pretties, Specials, the Midnighters series) but I just can't, and I mean CAN'T, understand how this book wormed its way into existence.Why, Scott?
Why?Why make such a despicable protagonist?
You know, I actually felt antagonistic towards Aya, so I don't think the term "protagonist" even applies.
I tried to love her, and try I did.
You build up Tally's character in three books, only to ruin it all in the fourth.I love your books, Scott, but this one...This one just doesn't quite make it in my list.
ALIENS??????????
ALIENS??????????
ALIENS??????????
Even the writing is not at paar with the previous books.
At one moment the characters are talking and all of a sudden they are on hoverboards which came out of nowhere and running away from ALIENS.
ALIENS???????????"Extras" is the first book I give one star and am not guilt-ridden about it.
I appreciate all the efforts and thoughts authors put into their work, all the sleepless nights and all the blocks they have to contend with so seldom do I dare say I disliked a particular book.
Don't get me started!ALIENS???????
It's finally over!!!I was surprised that the last book was so much better than the first three in the series.This was largely due to a entire new cast of characters from the first 3 books and a bit of a plot change as well.
There is new terms they use here but they seem to make more sense and are used a little more sparingly.Aya is slightly more likable character than Tally, but only slightly.All in all I'm glad there are no more books in this series and that I am finally done.This is not something I will be rereading....EVER!
This novel doesn't center around Tally, the protagonist of the previous three books, but around a new character, Aya Fuse, who's growing up in a post-Pretties world.
In other words, Paris Hilton would still be in our faces all the time, dammit.Like a lot of Westerfeld's work, this book is the most enjoyable if you don't think about it too much.
I'm much, much happier having this, instead of Specials, as my final impression of the Uglies world and these characters, and that's worth a lot, I think.
Although this wasn't as good as the other books, I really enjoyed it. I was a bit disappointed when it wasn't about Tally Youngblood, but it was a really interesting adventure and I am glad that she showed up later. Aya was a bit annoying, how she was obsessed with fame and all. But in the end, I ended up liking her. I thought Frizz was really sweet, Hiro is a jerk, and Ren is a pretty nice character.
So,*******Spoilers ahead******although not many since I don't feel like writing much about this fuckery*******Welcome to the world of Aya Tally 2.0.
Aya has one focus in life which is to become famous.
In the new post-Tally world (of Japan), the goal is to become as noticed as you can.
The higher the hits, the more famous you are.
You just run around being famous.
Aya infiltrates a secretive girly group, secretly videotaping them, which coincidentally leads to uncovering a huge mysterious mystery conspiracy secret something, which transitions to betraying her new friends and showing the video feed to all of Japan, which causes her to suddenly be chased by the secretive secret alien looking people (who aren't really aliens) and blah blah blah.
Listened to series via audio, series review to come.
While he does a good job of how relationships can be screwed due to the difference of ranks (called "difference of ambition" in her world, which is a reason people can break up their relationships, much like our "irreconcilable differences") or make things awkward, it doesn't go much further than that.Also, I found it a little eye-rolling that the heroine does attain a very very high rank in the end, after all, which kind of deflates the purpose of the book, or a purpose.
His mysteries and conflicts which send the protagonists, whether they are uglies, pretties, specials, or extras, are quite exciting and keep you reading to see the solution.
But the last two books, Specials and Extras, have now put him into the writing genre of Eco-Novelist.
His message of it would be better to change your body to a zero gravity atmosphere and send yourself into an endless orbit around the earth, so that the earth can be preserved from any more ravages from humans, IS RIDICULOUS.
Once again, as I've said before, he values the earth more than people, and that is just bass-ackwards.
DNF at page 3I read three pages and realized this is a waste of my time. I have no interest in the series and i can't remember anything from it so what's the point of trying to read this. Not going to waste my time reading this if I'm not interested in it. PRE REVIEWI read the original series almost three years ago and never got to this. I thought I might as well read it now even though i remember nothing. at least its a different plot and characters.
Merits are for schlubs who do the grunt work--ditch diggers, teachers, proctologists ((There aren't enough merits in the world for me to be a proctologist...but I digress)) In other words, the help: "Be a dear and clean up that vomit." They are hardly ever mentioned.Fame is the other fork in the road, and down this fork everyone adores you and everything that you ever wanted just magically pops out of the wall--I'm not kidding.Which way does Aya chose?
Yet for this book the philosophy is never questioned, and thus works beautifully.Aya proves my point by immediately doing something dreadfully dangerous in order to Kick a story.
Scott Westerfeld has generated another really interesting world - the concept is quite separate to Uglies/Pretties/Specials (a world which has been milked) and I think could totally be read as a standalone.
Crucially the characters were distinctive, credible and the sibling dynamic was so convincing.But: some of those annoying characteristics of Scott's writing has persevered, like the infuriating ambiguity.
The writing style was, at times, still a bit crude, like it had been written by a 12 year old.
Sly. Girls.Westerfeld certainly has a talent for thinking up new and interesting concepts and he constructs his worlds masterfully, introducing the vocabulary and practises of the times with ease.
Once you told yourself a story enough times, it was so easy to keep on believing it.Wow, this was kind of a big disappointment.Honestly, the first half before Tally showed up was way better.
Speshul Tally was Extra Speshul Tally sometimes and it really dragged down the story with her angry sanctimoniousness.
it's totally okay for you to steal all our metal!" Also, I mean, come on.
But that doesn't make up for the overall clicheness and cringiness of the love story that existed.Man, Scott, I'm counting on you to not mess up Impostors
Yich. Not pretty. I didn't like the complication of the language barrier when it wasn't very clear. I hated the main character for her stupidity, pride, and assumptions. Its plot wasn't very engaging, and once they figure out what the Extras are doing, it jumps to the party scene. Tally's character is a lot harsher than before, as well. It was less along the same baseline that made the others good. The others were their titles because Tally was one. Tally was not an Extra. Overall, not worth it for the author to have written it.
In my opinion,the book is disappointing, because in the last 3 books the stories hook the readers attention.
In this is book I found that I did not like the main idea, and the main character was a stuck-up 15 year old girl that really got on my nerves.
And even though the old characters were in the book, the old main character (Tally Youngblood) was a totally different character!
I personally think the series should have ended on The Specials.
It was a HUGE struggle just to finish the book and left me wanting to drop the book and never pick it up again.
I think this novel was so creative. The constant monitoring of your stats reminds me of all the stuff I do with Facebook and Twitter and blogging. It's easy to see how this could happen in the future. What a strange world.
Not a Scott Westerfeld ending, at least.Other Scott Westerfeld endings had crazy turns, like (spoiler warning) Tally abandoning reason and becoming pretty, even thought it screws with your brain, or like Tally turning Special, even though it screws with your brain, or Tally not fixing her brain after she fixes everyone else's to keep things in order.No. At the end of Extras, we learn that it was all a big misunderstanding and then go to a party.Wha....?Of course, if Scott Westerfeld writes something else to follow this one, I'll read it because I love his books, and I want him to fix this ending.
This is a crazy odd twist to the government and how it's controlling us! Loved it!You know... I felt like Scott Westerfeld just wrote this one for the fans and that he was really finished when he did the third book. Still great though.
