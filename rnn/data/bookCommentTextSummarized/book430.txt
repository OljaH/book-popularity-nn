Fascinating to read about the various rituals and the secrecy of the rights of the Greek cult.
Short but thorough and well researched. The author did a great job of explaining the mysteries and their origins. He also takes you through as many details of the rituals themselves as possible. I would not read this book if you are not familiar with ancient Greek culture and/or the myth of Persephone.
Very useful to learn about Eleusis mysteries, but you might need a bit of previous knowledge regarding Demeter and Persephone to enjoy it more.
A marvelous little book. Of especial interest to those seeking the mysteries of the O.T.O.
