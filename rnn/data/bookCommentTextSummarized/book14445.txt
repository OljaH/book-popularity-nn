Recommended and recited by my wife.The battle lines are drawn and the fight gets real. There's a think tank working its way furiously to trump the enemy.Yooks and Zooks and their different styles of applying butter on the bread.The book inculcates respect and the very essential feeling of tolerance into children. The unity in diversity.

6 stars!!! Being a huge fan of Dr. Seuss‚Äô works over the years, I was in that mode where I wanted to read everything that was written by him and I remembered reading ‚ÄúThe Butter Battle Book‚Äù many years ago when I was little. Well, I stumbled upon ‚ÄúThe Butter Battle Book‚Äù again when I got older and at first, I was a little hesitant about reading this book again because of its war themes and I usually do not like reading books about wars, but after reading this classic book by Dr. Seuss, I actual
Also, the theme about the Zooks and the Yooks going at war with each other might be a bit disturbing for younger children, especially if they do not understand about the motives of wars or if they do not like seeing characters fighting each other.Overall, ‚ÄúThe Butter Battle Book‚Äù is easily one of the best books about anti-war ever written and anyone who is a fan of Dr. Seuss‚Äô works or would love to read about how terrible wars are will definitely not be disappointed in this book!
Considering some of the check-outs that my kindergartner has brought home this year - the kind I begrudgingly cracked open and read each night with the sort of over-taxed smile and forced lilt necessary to make it through the more inane children's books - seeing a Dr. Seuss was a great relief.
One that I've never read or heard of to boot!Unfortunately, the nightly recite until turn-in-time for this library book has probably already been nixed."That was boring." Sigh.
in a surprising turn for a Dr. Seuss book, I wish I would have known the subject matter before diving in.
Today I read "The Butter Battle Book" also by Dr. Seuss.
Needless to say my very knowledgeable sixth graders proceeded to tell me how the Butter Battle Book is actually a political story about the Cold War. I almost dropped my teeth.
A few years ago when I did a lesson on the Berlin Wall my 8th grade students had no idea what the Cold War was.
One of my students is doing their History Fair project on The Cold War and one of them is doing their project on the Berlin Wall.
I think it is one of his best!
Reviewed for THC ReviewsThe Butter Battle Book is another of Dr. Seuss's titles which reflect his activist side.
One side fires upon the other with a slingshot and from there, the conflict continues to escalate with each side coming up with increasingly preposterous weapons until both possess a small bomb which could blow the other side to smithereens and in essence wipe out the world.It's doubtful that younger children will understand the deeper meaning behind the story, but they're sure to be delighted with the classic Seuss rhyming text and whimsical illustrations of Seuss-ified characters and their silly machines.
Overall, The Butter Battle Book was another fabulous Dr. Seuss story that has earned a spot on my keeper shelf.

A very clever book, really impressed with this one. Shows how to respect somebody if they are different or if they believe in something you don't understand. It then goes on to show if you don't that hatred can turn into a conflict with each side building bigger and bigger weapons, until you end up in a stand-off with a big-boy-boomeroo. Really well done and it leads up to some very interesting discussions with the child you read it too.
Me and Rae loved this story.
When we hit the end, she wanted to know "What happens?" and it was fun to tell her that it was up to the reader to determine what will happen.
Does the Yook drop his bomb and kill himself and the Zook?
Or what if the Zook drops his bomb first?
Is the first one to drop his bomb surprised to find it is a dud?
Will the Zook win, as he has every time before, and history prove that it is always repeating itself?
Which way is the right way to butter your bread?
I love activist Seuss books.
This book is good, but makes me a little perturbed.
In other Seuss books, like the Lorax, there's more of a child-like tone to the story.
My kids felt the tension in this book and the oldest one even shouted, "Can they stop being weird and just hug.
It left my kids a little irritated.
Seuss was one of a kind and I'm happy he found a way to express his views in his books.
Knowing history and then reading about it in a Seuss book, just makes it all look asinine.
A response to Cold War nuclear proliferation and mutually assured destruction as told through buttered toast.
Wow. Just wow.
In all of my thirty one years, I have never actually read the Butter Battle Book.
It must be one of the only Dr. Seuss books I've never read.
I had no idea how dark and gritty it was going to be.
Keep in mind, it IS just a children's book, so it isn't like there is blood and guts and brains spilling out of cracked skulls or anything, but still...
It was actually an incredibly good read.Update: Read this again today in honor of Seuss's birthday.
It is even more relevant in today's political climate than it was when I first read it last year.
A perfect story for our world today.
That cliffhanger ending! AARGH! I NEED TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENS NEXT!The Butter Battle is about the Yooks who eat their toast butter side up and the Zooks who eat their toast butter side down (blasphemy!). This resulted in the great Butter Battle where each country is convinced that their way of eating toast is the correct way. What started off as a disagreement quickly escalates to a full on war. I think this is a great book that teaches kids about war and how pointless it is. We should just embrace our differences rather than force our ways on others!
Dr. Seuss has been known to include many different political issues and views in his children's books.
However, Dr. Seuss used his children books as a platform for different political issues.
Seuss utilized this book to show his readers that both sides in the Cold War were wrong.
This right here is exactly why Capitalist America did not like Seuss' interpretation because they wanted society to be on their side and follow they ideology, so that they could have supporters.
I would use this book in a classroom because the war portion of the book is obvious, but Seuss' ideology behind it is not as obvious and not super important to children.
Another Seuss work with a social undertone, this one is about prejudice and war.
Through classic indoctrination, their governments feed citizens the ideas that they are different and must hate one another.A random and rather juvenile act of violence instigates a full-assault war, and it is interesting to watch as the two sides compete to see who can build a better, more destructive weapon.I think this is a wonderful book to read again and again to children to drive home the message that prejudice and superiority complexes are destructive to ourselves and society.
Especially in this time while the US is involved in what I believe is a ridiculous war, I'd like to read this to my kids.
Yes I‚Äôm counting this as part of my reading challenge üòÇüòÇ I need to build my book count lool.
I had to read this for this volunteering program I do and this book is part of the curriculum to teach kids about conflicts and stuff.
And I think this is one great book to show conflict in a way that‚Äôs humorous and in a way that can show kids how conflicts can arise and become unnecessary.
but personally I think you should have your butter on the top not the bottom so I can see how the Yooks would hate the Zooks.
I‚Äôm personally offended by the Zooks‚Äô choices (KIDDING!)
I missed Dr. Seuss so I picked up this beauty of a book.What I never realized as a child was the social statement in this book.Dr. Seuss uses this story as a reflection of the Cold War, mutually assured destruction, to illustrate how silly conflict can be. The artwork is abstract and beautiful, as always.Dr Seuss was a genius.
Not bad, but illustrations are great as always!
Great book. Points out the escalation of trying to be better than those we choose to make enemies - usually for stupid reasons.
*Sigh* I know war and fighting and a system of defense is important towards a countries "safety" and preservation or what not but by now after paying attention to history and war and all the blood that has been shed can we find a better way to solve our problems already?
We can drop the childish charade of getting each other where it hurts and put our vulnerabilities out there for all to see, take the upper hand and allow war to maybe become a thing of profit and entertainment if we can't let it go completely as Richard Bach portrays in his "One" but stop the killing.
When I was a young girl, my father used to read Dr. Seuss books to me before bed.
I‚Äôm confident it will turn into a tradition because my daughter loves to read Dr. Seuss to me; I can only imagine when she has a family of her own to read too.
Read a book out loud to someone.This book should be mandatory reading IMO because it touches upon a subject that is very difficult for some people to deal with; the judgment of others.
A view that they can identify with and understand.It‚Äôs my favorite Dr. Seuss book of all time.
Basic plot: The Yooks and Zooks escalate their battle over the all important question of which side of the bread should be buttered.In Gulliver's Travels by Jonathan Swift, Lilliput wars with Blefuscu over whether an egg should be cracked at the little end or big end (I tend to crack them in the middle, suppose that makes me a complete heretic), but the symbolism implied that Swift was making fun of the fight over Catholicism vs.
In a similar manner, The Butter Battle Book attacks the Cold War weapons stockpiling and standoff between the USA and USSR.
I am a Dr. Seuss fan, and my 5 year-old is, too.
We begin bombing in five minutes.") It was further controversial because it has an ending that is neither happy nor conclusive.
On the latter score, I did feel the need to give the book a review before sharing it with my five year-old.
I don't think he finds the ending particularly satisfying, but I don't think he finds it particularly upsetting, either.
Once a kid has that kind of exposure, I think Seuss's cautionary tale is a good thing to add to the mix.
The book is a clear product of the cold war era, and especially of the doom era (ca.
In 'The Butter Battle Book' we watch an arms race between two neighboring countries, whose only difference is on which side they butter their bread.
Uncharacteristically, the book has an open ending, as if Dr. Seuss wanted to show that an arms race involving mass destruction weapons will lead us nowhere.Because of its clear cold war theme, 'The Butter Battle Book' has aged less well than other Dr. Seuss books, even though the nuclear threat has never left Earth since.
The message in this book is so funny because in a lot of ways it really does represent governments, and how people with opposing viewpoints take things so personally, even though it doesn't have to be that way. I think that this would be a fun book to use with a high school government class, and have them make text to world connections based on what happens in the book and what they see happening with the government in our nation.

I am currently discussing the allegory with my students.
I thought I would mix it up a bit and throw them something they weren't expecting, so I chose The Butter Battle Book.
As a small child, this wasn't one of my absolute favorite of Seuss's stories, but I still liked it.
True, it does present a very simplistic view of a very complex problem, but it's a children's book.
No matter who you are, it's a good story which points out the futility of getting up in arms over small differences in beliefs or policy.
After reading it to my son, I'm not entirely sure it's a children's book.
and a bit too real, despite the fact that the entire argument in the battle stems from which side of the bread the butter should go on.My husband immediately picked up on it being a Cold War parable, and it is...
it's a fictional, Seussical send-up of nuclear proliferation, and far more thinly veiled than some of his other parables, despite its initial subject matter.
I'm not sure if it's more brilliant or more ridiculous.
Probably a bit of both.
I'll at least keep it in mind for high school history reading.
