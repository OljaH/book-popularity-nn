I loved this book to start with and I hated this book by the end and therefore I found this such a difficult Novel to rate and review.
Firstly the setting for the Lake house is amazing and Kate Morton has a wonderful sense of time and place in her novels.
I was totally drawn in by the descriptive and vivid writing and the wonderful images that that the author created.
The Narrator was excellent on the audio version although the story did drag a little in places.So what was there to hate about this novel, it was too descriptive and way too drawn out.
I had really, really wanted to wait a little closer to the publishing date to read this, but based on all of the great feedback, and my love of her previous novels I couldn't resist.
So here I sit having just finished...
I have enjoyed all of KM's novels but this one will easily go down as my favorite.
As a writer, she has a unique gift of being able to weave past and present stories together in a way that seems effortless.
In this, both stories had me captivated from the very beginning.
Soon, she is completely absorbed by the disappearance of a young boy from the lake house seventy years earlier.As the story progresses, multiple leads are explored and snuffed out.
Alice, the boy's sister, is an esteemed writer and offers many insights into the events surrounding his disappearance.Although there was a love story or two along the way, they took a backseat to the mystery surrounding the crimes.
Underwhelmed is probably the best descriptor of my feelings after finishing this book.Despite all of my gripes, I did think the story was well-written.
So, this is probably a case of "it's not you, it's me".
I only got through a quarter of it. Just cannot get interested in the story. Jumps back and forth between multiple time periods and characters with long-winded descriptions about everything and everyone. It was like listening to someone trying to tell me a story that cannot stay on track. I liked her other books. Perhaps I'm too impatient and the timing for this one was not right. Reading can be such a subjective endeavor sometimes.
The Lake House just doesn't have the same magically indulgent appeal as the author's previous books, though the ingredients are there: a beautiful tumbledown house in the country, a family secret hidden for decades, a character receiving a fateful letter, and a narrative that's split between 'past' (1911 and the early 1930s) and 'present' (2003).
There's nothing strictly wrong with the story, I just found it dragging at points which seemed at odds with how compelling previous Morton books have been.
Two different story lines decades apart, a young boy missing in the past and a policewoman at odds with her superiors and a woman author, make up this story. As with all Morton novels, very descriptive and atmospheric, maybe too much so. Her novels seem to follow a pattern, but this is a comfort read, one know exactly what one will get. A little suspense, a family tragedy, secrets and at last a dénouement. As for the end, a little to pat, too neatly tied up and ultimately a disappointment.
I never review Morton's books. They are just a reading treat, kinda like a piece of reading chocolate. As always, enjoyable but this one was a bit too neatly tied up at the end.
I tried but I can't like this one as much as every one else does. The story is good, some of the characters are interesting but the author just uses far too many words! I was obliged to skim quite a lot of the text just because she rambled so far from the purpose of the book. And then one complete star off for that awfully contrived ending. Sorry everyone who loved it - it obviously just wasn't for me:(
Welcome to LoeannethYou are in a lush and abundant English garden in Cornwall on a secluded lakeside estate.You know the kind; the ones that seem naturally resplendent with rhododendron, foxglove, bluebells, boxwood, ivy and creeping phlox. So beautiful and fragrant it overwhelms your sense of sight and sound and smell. Perhaps tea will be served by the gateway, just over that knoll, where you can follow the pathway down to the lake.Decades ago, in 1933, back at the house, on a midsummer night’s
She is certain things are not as they seemThat something far more sinister is afoot.She is alone in her certainty,And eager, desperate even, to reclaim her post.One case that she cannot rid from her mind and another that she is not allowed to pursue.As promised we meet Alice again in 1932, as a bright, innocent and precocious 16 year old, with a penchant for writing mystery stories,months before that fateful mid summers eve.A time when Ben was still at Loeanneth,a time of dreams and misplaced certainties.Kate Morton serves up an atmospheric tale of family secrets and intertwining destinies, revolving around three mysteries.
While I absolutely adored this book, there were a few times I felt disconnected and disappointed, or that the coincidences were a little too much, but not for too long or in any way to truly bother me.The story focuses on several characters in England mostly during the 1910s to the 1930s, and then current time which is set in the 2000s.
At times, it's a bit too connected or coincidental, but truthfully, isn't that part of why we read books?
So while it can be a bit overdone or over-the-top (even in my own writing, I would agree it happens), it also is what truly makes the book spectacular in other ways.
This was my first novel by Kate Morton and it definitely won't be my last.
On a summer evening in 1933, eleven month old Theo Edevane vanishes from his crib and is nowhere to be found.
After months of searching with no results, the devastated Edevane family leaves their lakeside estate in Cornwall for London.
I loved how everything connected together in the end.
Also worth mentioning, I had a friend on here mention how she was impressed with how authentic Morton made her characters sound ( they being set in London and the author being Australian ) and I couldn't agree more.
She goes to stay with her widowed grandfather in Cornwall, and while there, she comes upon a lake house, Loeanneth, abandoned for 70 years following a family tragedy where a much-loved baby brother disappeared in the 1930s.
Eleanor and her husband had bought back her childhood home, Loeanneth, and her mother, Constance, was reduced to moving back in with them.
As for her spiteful mother, Eleanor has good reason to feel vengeful and finds her chance when the family leaves the lake house after the baby boy disappears.
Alice, a successful mystery writer and Sadie Sparrow, a detective visiting her grandfather while on leave, have their lives intersect in the most unlikely of ways, but it almost feels like fate is working overtime because the odd circumstances that place them together will unravel years of secrets, lies, guilt, and will ultimately lead to the truth about a seventy year old cold case.
What she uncovers is absolutely astounding….I love it when a mystery novel is written in a literary prose, and this story certainly has that advantage, but in the beginning the story was sort of disjointed and moved very slowly.
Kate Morton is one of those authors that are so high up on my list of favorites that I literally hate that I have to wait so long for a new book of hers to come out.
Then when her novel does get published my greedy hands takes one and then I'm sad that I've read it, & I have to wait so long for another!
I know that when I sit down to read her book, I will become lost within its pages.
There's a cover and a synopsis!! Oh happy day!!Let's go October 22nd!!!

Seventy-years later from the tragedy of the Edevane family losing their little boy, DC Sadie Sparrow comes to Cornwall to visit her grandfather.
Sadie finds out one of the daughters was still alive and a very popular author, her name is Alice.
Alice finally decides to talk to DC Sadie because she's getting closer to something, but it is soooo not what Sadie is thinking.
Then the story moves to 2003 and introduces the reader to Sadie Sparrow, who is on enforced leave from the Metropolitan police after her refusal to let go of a case involving a grandmother, mother and abandoned child.
Sadie feels the mother has not abandoned her baby at all and there is more to the story.
Later in the book there are other time shifts back to London 1911, filling in back story, so it seems the author has a lot of threads to pull together.
Every chance I got I was back with Sadie and Alice and co.
I recommend this for anyone who loves stories about secrets and families.
The mother, Eleanor had been brought up in the house and after marrying her husband, Anthony, he purchased it for her, an astounding gift for the love of his life.In June of 1933 a favored baby child, the only son of the Edevane family went missing after an annual house party.
Together they are determined to solve the mystery of what happened at Loeanneth so many years ago…A story about family secrets, lapses of judgement, guilt, homes lost and found, great loves, great passions, and an enchanting place in the world, “The Lake House” is a prime example of what fiction should be.
I just seem to absolutely love all of Kate Morton's books! RTC. 💓
"She'd realized recently (an awareness that coincided with her new obsession for Agatha Christie) that what her previous story attempts were missing was a puzzle, a complex, knotty twist of events designed to mislead and bewilder readers. Also, a crime. The key to the perfect novel, Alice had decided, was to revolve the story around a crime's solution, all the while tricking the reader by making it seem she was doing one thing when in fact she was merrily doing another...'I've had a brilliant i
The key to the perfect novel, Alice had decided, was to revolve the story around a crime's solution, all the while tricking the reader by making it seem she was doing one thing when in fact she was merrily doing another...'I've had a brilliant idea,' she said...'A kidnapping, Ben. I'm going to write a book about a kidnapping...'"
Every night was a gift, when I was finally able to open this book, and was able to step back in time to the 1930's, or to the more recent past of 2003; this intricately layered mystery kept me analyzing and guessing the many clues provided until the very end, when all is ultimately revealed.
THE LAKE HOUSE is a lovely story told in alternating time periods, and at its heart, the mystery of a boy who went missing in the 1930s.
While on leave from her job, a police detective stumbles upon an abandoned estate in Cornwall, and discovers the 70-year old cold case of Theo Edevane's disappearance from the house.
The story shifts between the present and past, back to 1933 and Theo's sister Alice's account of what happened leading up to his disappearance.
I had fun trying to figure out the Edevane family secrets.Disclosure: I received a copy of this book from the publisher through NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.
I can think of Tara in "Gone With The Wind" and "Manderley in "Rebecca." Kate Morton writes great books where the houses are characters and this one is no different.
Loeanneth, The Lake House, is so important to this story.
In 1933 a couple lived there with their three daughters Deborah, Alice and Clemmie and their 11 month old son, Theo.
The family closes the door on The Lake House and leaves everything just as it is.
Eleanor makes a visit once a year to the house but after she dies and leaves the house to Alice, no one comes near it.
Alice the author and sister of Theo and Sadie the detective.Would these two women be able to find information about the disappearance 70 years ago of 11-month old Theo if they worked together on this cold case even though the police had not been able to find one clue or to find Theo?Alice had lived the nightmare of her brother's disappearance, and Sadie wanted to investigate the years-old case after she found the sprawling, abandoned estate of the Edevane family.I LOVED exploring the estate and
I would have loved to live on the estate as well as to be a part of the investigating.THE LAKE HOUSE goes back and forth in time and is filled with mystery, hidden passageways, intrigue, family secrets, and all of Ms. Morton's wonderful, creative writing skills, marvelous story lines, and descriptions that get better each time you turn the page and that put you right at the scene or definitely wanting to be there with the characters.
You will love it!!Ms. Morton had me hooked on her book THE FORGOTTEN GARDEN, and THE LAKE HOUSE is going to be right up there with it as one of my all-time favorites.
Alice, second daughter of the wealthy Eleanor and Anthony Edevane lived on the beautiful country estate of Loeanneth in Cornwall, revelling in an idyllic life where she was free to explore the woods and the lake.
However, events don't quite work out as she planned and something happens that night to blow apart the family and their lives, causing them to flee Loeanneth and never return.Some seven decades later, a young police detective, Sadie Sparrow on enforced leave from her job, discovers the neglected estate while staying with her grandfather and hears how the Edevane's baby son, Theo disappeared on that Midsummer Night in 1933 and was never found.
Not my favorite Morton...review on the way!
I will start by saying I love Kate Morton's writing.
I can picture the story and each character as the book unfolds.
I felt like she crammed a bit too much into one story.
I just felt as if there were too many things going on, too many coincidences and it all tied up way to neatly for me at the end.
By no means will this keep me from being a Morton fan.
Really lovely. A thoughtful story, with very human characters. The ending felt quite coincidental, but overall, a great story!Find more reviews and bookish fun at http://www.princessandpen.com
Normally I don't enjoy books that drag me into acknowledging harsh realities, but Morton is one author who does it in such a way that I can't help admiring it.
This is another wonderfully written book, a joy to read even with the pain that is uncovered along the way.The atmosphere in The Lake House is warm and nostalgic on the one hand, and full of overgrowth and decay on the other.
The mystery is explored in the modern timeline, with character perspectives from the past interspersed.
What can I say about The Lake House that hasn’t already been said?Kate Morton is a masterful story teller, observing the small nuances of human nature, things that don’t change through time, giving the reader parallels between mother and daughter ( they were so alike although Alice never saw the side of her mother the reader was privy to) and the parallels in characters of the 1930’s and those in 2003.This quote from the book sums up Morton’s writing perfectly.“She certainly knew how to write; she had a beautiful turn of phrase.”Weaving mystery and intrigue throughout the story I loved every word.
This novel is very descriptive and multifaceted. I applaud the author for her intricately woven plot line. However, I was hoping for a surprise ending like in The Secret Keeper. Instead, I predicted most of the ending correctly. Giving this book 3 stars for being both humdrum and captivating. I would read another book by Kate Morton.
Let's say that behind every woman in this book is a story that is waiting to be told.I loved reading this book, learning along the way what had really happened when Alice was young and what happened to Theo and I enjoyed finding out more about Sadie and why she was on forced leave.
This book has a really rich story with well-written characters and I especially like reading about Alice mother Eleanor life because that really explained so much and gave me a whole new picture of her than the one I got at the beginning of the book when Alice is "telling" her story.The only drawback in this book, for me, was the convenient ending.
