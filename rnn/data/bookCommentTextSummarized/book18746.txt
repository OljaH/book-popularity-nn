5 SMOKING STARS! Daughter of Smoke & Bone Review This is the best sequel I have ever read.The first book was great ,but this one...perfection.Everything fits amazing,the characters had a truly development,they are perfectly explained and described,the background is smoky cool,and antique.The story is mind blowing,written so smart.There were some moments I was speechless,like what just happened. You can find the full review and more about this book on my blog _________________________________
This was not that world.” ____________________________________________The writing style as in the first book was classic and unique.It is what makes this book ever more special.The author has this way of twisting words.Confusing sometimes but it is so beautiful to read.____________________________________________“A dream dirty and bruised is better than no dream at all.” ____________________________________________(This may contain spoilers)There are some moments that got me,left me mouth opened like the scene with the white wolf and Karou in the court.They way Thiago turned the case on his side was mind blowing and so smart.Also the scene with Karou and Akiva and Thiago in the same room and the scene after that was awesome.I don't even know how the author came with that idea.It was brilliant and wise!____________________________________________“I am one of billions.
Akiva and Karou are in different camps now, with an abyss of resentment, guilt and disappointment separating them.I have already heard a few voices upset by this almost-no-romance development.
The masterful twists at the end left me hungry for more and more, because as much as I know about Eretz now, I also know how much there is still left to explore.Days of Blood & Starlight may be not as quirky and charming as its goulash- and skuppy mischief-filled predecessor, but it's a novel that encourages you to contemplate the consequences of war for both winners and losers and futility of revenge.
Even though I missed Prague and ever annoying Kaz a little in Days of Blood & Starlight, reading it was still a pleasure, albeit a pleasure of a different kind.
"What are we fighting for? What are we killing for? What do you see when you look into the future?" Gone are the first book's spunkiness and lightheartedness, and (thankfully!) the annoying romance angle (even though the deceiving and useless cover of this book may wrongly lead you thinking otherwise). Instead the darkness and dirt and tiredness and betrayals and pain and weariness and hopelessness and violence and vengeance and grim determination set in, and it is so much more realized and gri
Instead the darkness and dirt and tiredness and betrayals and pain and weariness and hopelessness and violence and vengeance and grim determination set in, and it is so much more realized and gripping and touching than I hoped - having lived up to the promise that the first book in the series was trying to set up.
Because, as we have seen so many times in our real world, the natural compulsion is to answer violence with more of the same, to wreck vengeance, to make the other side feel your pain.
A-a whole  year  until the next book comes out?!I can't.....I can't........ *snaps*OHMIGOD I CANT W8 I CANT I REALLY CANT AHHHHH OMGOMGOMG THIS IS GOING 2 TAKE 4EVER ND I WANT IT NOW! I NEED MORE AKIVA AND KAROU! Y DOES THIS HV 2 TAKE SOOOOOOOOOOOO LIKE LONNNGGG!Woahhhhhhh.  Did I just have a total trolly fan-girl rant...  over a book?  Taylor...I think....I think I just need to go sit down. I feel so  woozy.  This series just does such weird things to me *looks at the release date again*  OoooooOoooOooohhhhhhh.
RightI mean reading this book was a hell of a ride. Taylor doesn't just like to rip things apart, she bloody well SHREDS them and scatters the remaining pieces into the wind. Like, I mean this book is really not for the faint of heart. It brings back all the magic of Daughter of Smoke and Bone, but there's more pain involved in this one, both physical and emotional. AND THAT ENDINGNOI MEAN COME ONSTOP LEAVING ME HANGING LIKE THIS, TAYLOR.
Life is your master, or death is.”But of course, my favourite instalment in the DOSAB trilogy has the honour of being my 50th Goodreads review!
Akiva is with his seraphim brethren at their camp as they formulate their next plan for attack, whilst Karou is trying to salvage what little is left of the chimaera race by undertaking Brimstone’s past responsibilities as the resurrectionist.
<3There are spoilers for Daughter of Smoke and Bone, NOT Days of Blood and Starlight, below!Days of Blood and Starlight begins close to where Daughter of Smoke and Bone ends…As we now know, Karou was once a chimaera, by the name of Madrigal, in a previous life.
but i have never read another book that did what this one did for me - i have never felt the horror of war as much as i felt in this one.
and in Daughter of Smoke & Bone she did the impossible for me in that she made me care about the romance angle of it, when usually i am reading these YA books and kind of enduring the heavy stares and kissing to get back to the action.this one?
OMG! I can't believe my first review of this back in 2015 was 3 stars. I must have been on crack! This book is amazing and it made me cry for really sad things and really good things and just OMG! Once upon a time, an angel and a devil held a wishbone between them. And it's snap split the world in two. God!Karou is living with the evil freaking Thiago and the other chimaera. They are all hateful and evil with the exception of a few. But I won't go into that without giving away some major spoiler
God!Karou is living with the evil freaking Thiago and the other chimaera.
The nicer chimaera, but we can't always get what we want, although, sometimes things do come back.
God, if they only knew what they were getting into and thank God at that time Thiago needed Karou or they would have been supper!
Along with Karou and I want my own Akiva!
Thiago is doing horrible things to his people in order to make them stronger.
I am going right into the last book because pins and needles people.
4.5 stars!
No sé ni cómo expresar mi sentir sobre este libro, tuvo muchas cosas increíbles y pocas cosas que no me gustaron, así que empezaré con lo que no me gustó.Creo que tuvo partes algo densas y aburridas, y las historias de algunos nuevos personajes no me interesaban para nada.
Y este libro perdió todo eso: Se volvió oscuro y desolador, y aunque la trama se puso mil veces más intensa, extrañé mucho toda esa magia del primer libro.Esas son mis únicas "quejas"...
Laini lo describe tan bien, que pude imaginarme todo en mi cabeza y fue muy gore para mí (soy bien llorona).
We’ll just bring the people we cared about back to life, and no harm done!Romeo and JulietPartway through this book, Karou somewhat heavy-handedly reminds us that Daughter of Smoke and Bone was the story of Romeo and Juliet + genocide, which, duh.
This story assumes Karou's devotion to this dude, into whose eyes she's gazed for like twelve seconds, would be a strong enough feeling to overcome her grief for her family.
So, like, this book is trying to tell me that Akiva was the nicest guy ever, and dreaming of peace, but then he did all of the hand-burning stuff in reaction to seeing Madrigal get killed?
This does happen to be about 250 some pages… Finally, when certain secondary character become a bigger part of the story the pace is, or at least feels, like it's finally moving forward.
The first part of the book may be slow, but the second half is full of wicked fight scenes and great plot advancement that make you forget it was even slow in the first place.
One example of excellent writing!The character voices, the incredible world, the fantastic fight scenes (especially in this sequel); it's elaborate without being overdone, it's pretty without being cliché.
when i read ‘daughter of smoke and bone,’ i complained that the relationship felt too insta-lovey.
and now after reading this, im going to complain that there wasnt enough love.
the story was definitely entertaining enough (even though this was a classic second book series filler), but there is just something missing for me to fall in head over heels in love with this story.
and even though not much happened in this, i do think the series is headed in a good direction overall and i will most likely be picking up the next book!
If Daughter of Smoke and Bone was a dream, a mirage, a masterpiece of writing and phrases and words, overlapped and edited and fine-tuned to create a perfection of romance, snark, and pulsating chemistry, all tinged with a palpable undertone of bittersweet, Days of Blood and Starlight is like a hard slap, the cold splash of water, and the startled opening of ones eyes into the bleak, war-ridden, fragile, and bloody reality of life.
Unlike most trilogies which follow in a steady rhythm of romance or action or paranormal mystery, Laini Taylor breaks all imaginary constraints and reveals to us the completely unexpected, for Days of Blood and Starlight is as far removed from its predecessor, Daughter of Smoke and Bone, as any novel could possibly be.
Only one word can describe my feelings about this book:Fuck.
FUCK.Don’t take that the wrong way.
I’d previously rage-quit reading anything even remotely YA because I just can’t with the contrived drama, and the angst, and the dopey, sappy, first time love, and the Mary Sues.
Authors, stahp it with the goddamn Mary Sues.
And then there’s the love triangles.
Anyone who’s spoken to me for a fraction of a second on here probably already knows exactly how I feel about love triangles because I carry a banner with me from thread to thread that announces my feelings on that subject.
“AUTHORS, STAHP IT WITH THE MOTHER FUCKING LOVE TRIANGLES.”
You know what makes it so different?
In this we get more of the other characters and everyone needs Zuzana and Mik even if you don't know you do.Oh and the world!
THE WORLD!This felt like it's happening outside my door.
Most of the action is happening in Morrocco and gosh darn it felt like home.The food, the places, all of it is just so familiar.The Kasbah, which are these ancient castles and homes clustered around them.
They are just what I see every day and every time they are mentioned I feel alive.I'll try to write a more appropriate review soon.
It's not the brightest idea to write reviews first thing in the morning XD
IM A MESS THIS DESTROYED ME AND IT WAS AMAZING
I'm currently mourning that I don't own the third book :/I like this series!
I'm really into this magic system with the animal hybrid characters; I think it's super neat.
This one dragged a little, even though I like that it's set somewhere in the world that I've never read about before.
It was just a little bit stagnant because pretty much this entire book was characters watching the war from the sidelines, whereas I think in book 3 they'll be more directly involved.
I'm definitely interested to see how the series ends!**trigger warning for rape**
Personally, I always hold out hope for middle child books, wanting to be pleasantly surprised!Well, the pessimistic, miserly old grinches win out this time because DoBaS isn’t quite as good as its predecessor, but it’s certainly nothing to turn your nose up at.
I absolutely have to know where this series is going, what’s going to happen to them and whether I’m just as naive and foolish as Akiva and Karou for hoping and thinking that they will eventually have some form of happy relationship at the end of this series.TAYLOR MARRY ME I LOVES YOU!This review also appears on my blog, Cuddlebuggery Book Blog.
(hide spoiler)]➨Zuzana: I’m still confused about the magic system in this world.
I get it, Karou had no choice but to work with him but ughh (view spoiler)[I wish she would have killed him sooner.
(hide spoiler)]I’m really not sure how I feel about (view spoiler)[ Ziri being in the wolf’s body.
(hide spoiler)]➨Jael: Somebody needs to kill this thing before I do.
What I’m hoping to see in the next book: ➨ Kakiva sailing.
I hope we can learn more about her story and how she (view spoiler)[destroyed Jael’s face.
➨(view spoiler)[ Get Ziri back to his own body for God’s sake.
Exactly what I felt like after reading the publication date.  ...EDIT... Ooh. Days of Blood and Starlight. Nice title.
EDIT #11: I'm actually holding this beautifully book in my hands.
<3 I'm not allowing myself to read it though until I finish NaNoWriMo. Just a little incentive to get writing.EDIT #10: OHMAGAWD.
EDIT #9:  9 MORE DAYS PEOPLE.
9.  [image error]EDIT #8:  24 MORE DAYS.
Let this book be the exception, and  not  be another case of trilogy-should-only-have-been-a-duology-itis.
EDIT #6: The only time I've ever loved a cover that doesn't match the first one that much.
I'm going to die before this book is released.Dear Laini Taylor,The ONE AND ONLY THING I want for sure from this sequel is for you to NOT:Make a love triangle.
Final rating: 5/5 stars  “Once upon a time, an angel and a devil fell in love and dared to imagine a new way of living—one without massacres and torn throats and bonfires of the fallen, without revenants or bastard armies or children ripped from their mothers’ arms to take their turn in the killing and dying.Once, the lovers lay entwined in the moon’s secret temple and dreamed of a world that was a like a jewel-box without a jewel—a paradise waiting for them to find it and fill it with their hap
“Once upon a time, an angel and a devil fell in love and dared to imagine a new way of living—one without massacres and torn throats and bonfires of the fallen, without revenants or bastard armies or children ripped from their mothers’ arms to take their turn in the killing and dying.Once, the lovers lay entwined in the moon’s secret temple and dreamed of a world that was a like a jewel-box without a jewel—a paradise waiting for them to find it and fill it with their happiness.This was not that world.”  When you read a trilogy, does it make you feel that the second one is always a bridge between books?
These are the Days of Blood & Starlight.    Oh, Ellai, my hands will never be clean again.  4.5 stars. I want to crawl inside of Laini Taylor's head and live there for a little while. For every creative idea I've ever had, it feels like a penny compared to a hundred dollar bill. Laini falls on the idea-rich side.In the past, you might have seen my enthusiastic gushing about book 1 and how I likened it to word porn. Because, you know, that's what it was - porn for the brain that wants to li
Because, you know, that's what it was - porn for the brain that wants to live in a realm of lush visuals and beautiful prose.
All of sudden, I wanted to retrieve every single thing which had been lost.
If you haven't started this series yet and desire to want to live in a place where fantasy meets reality, in a moment of time when two worlds collide, get ready for something like you haven't seen before and might never see again.BUT...don't do what I did and read books 1 and 2 so far apart.
This story mostly focuses around Karou working as a resurrectionist in the desert where she builds new bodies for the souls of dead chimaera.
Akiva is with his half sibling seraphim and then there are a few other perspectives from new characters thrown in to emphasize the scale and threat of the war.My absolute FAVORITE part of this book was Mik & Zuzana (Karou's best friend from the first book).
And now I heard it's being published next year so yay).So there were some parts of the story I liked, but as a whole it was pretty depressing.
I mean, I absolutely adored the magical, almost whimsical quality of the first book!
When it comes to romance in the Paranormal/Fantasy YA landscape, more often than not the reader is presented with truly problematic pairings where rape culture is normalised and where insta-love is presented as par for de course and in lieu of actual romantic development.Daughter of Smoke and Bone was a book with a very strong focus in the romance between Karou/Madrigal and Akiva.
The story then in Days of Blood and Starlight deals with the after, with the guilt, with Karou finding out that HOLY CRAP, she dared to dream of love and that’s what happens when you hook up with a fanatical dude.
This book was amazing.
I enjoyed the first book, but this one was leagues ahead.
The one thing I really appreciated about this story was the tone.
I felt that Laini Taylor expertly captured the feeling of war.
Taylor painted both sides as exhausted and frustrated, the soldiers were unable to articulate why they were fighting anymore.
All they knew was blood.
There was this air of hopelessness, this feeling that neither side was winning, that both were destroying themselves.
But even within this desolate landscape Taylor also sprinkled in small flames of hope to keep us going.
There's something to be said for taking an old story and making it something new, and I loved Laini Taylor's execution of this story.
He's changed so much since book one, where I liked but didn't love him.
Everything lovely about the first book is simply one part of a whole story.
There's so much nuance to both the themes and the characters; this is a book you could analyze for hours.
This is so much more than a cliche love story; it's about tragedy and war and prejudice and oh my god, please just pick it up.
I was completely exhausted from the never ending war between the angels and the chimaeras, the different kind of war dear, sweet Akiva is trying so hard to wage and the war inside Karou’s heart.
Lol.^^)Thank goodness, the magical effect of Ms. Taylor’s writing gave me enormous strength to finish this book.
Also, thank goodness Zuzana and Mik’s humor and adorable romance gave relief and room for breath as I was barely breathing while reading this.I also have to mention my extreme fascination over the author’s detailed description of all sorts of chimaeras and angels.
Συγγνώμη, αλλά δεν καταλαβαίνω για ποιο λόγο λάτρεψαν όλοι αυτό βιβλίο.
Αλλά 620 σελίδες για να περιγράψεις γεγονότα, που θεωρώ πως μπορούσαν να ειπωθούν στις μισές σελίδες, είναι υπερβολικά πολλές.
Για 400 σελίδες βλέπαμε τα ίδια και τα ίδια (view spoiler)[την Καρού να ανασταίνει, τις χίμαιρες να επιτίθονται, τους αγγέλους να σφάζουν αθώες χίμαιρες (hide spoiler)] .
Μάλιστα συναντήσαμε πρόσωπα που, για μένα τουλάχιστον, δεν ήταν απαραίτητα.
Μπορούσα να καταλάβω την ιστορία και χωρίς τα κεφάλαια με τους αγνώστους.Δεν είχαμε Καρού-Ακίβα.
(view spoiler)[Μονάχα σε δύο σκηνές συναντήθηκαν (hide spoiler)]Δεν είχαμε δράση.
Πού ήταν η δράση για την οποία διάβαζα και διάβαζα???
