Everyone wants Jamie's body. Randall, Lord John Grey, Claire, that teen girl and... Me. XD
I thought I would going to keel over until Jamie and Claire were together again but I did enjoy the story up until then, with the exception of a few things.
Also, it's so hard to know that they are all dead, well most, and Murtagh too =( Murtagh, it was so sad when Jamie was telling Claire about it later on.
Yes, Jamie spent some time in jail while Claire was away and sired and damn kid boy doing something really stupid.
"Jamie," I said softly, and laid my hand on his arm.
Just finished the third tale of Jamie and Claire in Voyager, I must admit it was my favorite so far.
(Glug, glug, glug.) So, I must have gone through the stones when I was reading the third book about you and Jamie.
We run into people Jamie has met before, which is odd since we are way the fuck in the East Indies.
Damn women you have a strange existence, time for me to leave.”“Crap Claire!
Please, for love of god and all that is holy help me get out of here.”“Sure thing Stephanie…..first drink this bottle of brandy…..”This book was fun.
This was another five star read. I mean, how can it not be. The effort this author has put into the books is unbelievable. Not sure how long it takes her to do her research. “It has always been forever, for me, Sassenach”  Twenty years have passed and Claire returns through the stones. I thought their first meeting fell a little bit flat for me! Maybe my expections were too high.Plenty has happened in the twenty years that Claire and Jamie have been apart. Some of the things I wish didn’t happen
Maybe my expections were too high.Plenty has happened in the twenty years that Claire and Jamie have been apart.
(view spoiler)[John Grey on the same boat as Claire was on: of all the islands in the Caribbean she finds the shipwreck of the original boat on THAT island: Lawrence shows up and he has already met Jamie years ago in Edinburgh (hide spoiler)]Again, the attention to detail in these books is wonderful.
Each book has taken me five or six days to read, so you will need patience and time and dedication.
But they have been worth it so far.I might take a wee break now and read something else but I look forward to returning to another adventure with Jamie and Claire.
The Outlander series is definitely one of my most recommencded series of books.
They grow together.The historical aspects of the novels are great as well.
Gabaldon really does her research, and it's really fun to see how she weaves real historical people and events into the story lines.
But these novels are NOT the historical romances usually referred to as "bodice rippers." Much more intellectual than that.
Sure, there are some steamy parts...but they're interwoven in a way that makes sense to the story, not the central part of the story.Definitely on the list of my favorite books of all time.
Gabaldon's sex-ridden, hugely researched, academically adventurous, time travel/sci-fi meets historical romance novels qualify as trash novels for lit nerds -- they're absolutely a guilty pleasure.
Can't really go wrong.The books were recommended to me while I was living in England, and a lucky thing, too, because had I taken one look at the Fabio-in-a-kilt-of-passion American paperback cover I would have refused to read it (note: the British version was called Cross Stitch and the cover had a less-than-sexy field of heather on it).
Gabaldon has a way with characters and her prose flows along at an engaging clip.
Pretty much since then, I have been ITCHING to start reading "Voyager"--the biggest drawback has been (besides nabbing an audiobook version from the library) the length.Well, I finally had a chance (between all the Book Club books I've been reading) so I jumped upon the chance to listen to Davina Porter transport me back to Claire and Scotland and Jaime...only what I ended up getting was certainly not what I was expecting.I see it this way: if you go into this expecting just about anything to happen, you will do fine.
I have to say that I was generally disappointed by this third book in the series.
I'm ok with SOME unlikely siuations (after all, the whole premise of the book is unlikely!) but this was just non-stop.
She kept resurrecting characters from earlier in this book or previous books and it often made little sense as to why they suddenly appeared.
I felt like she kept adding these ridiculous situations just to make it a longer book but not for the purpose of the story.I'm really not sure I can go on to the 4th book --don't really see the point.
But only because there are pirates.Things that irritated me:"Och lassie, I swear I'll never lie to ye." "Oh, sorry, I didn't tell ye about that extra wife because I was afraid ye'd hate me.
But that's all the secrets." "Och, I'm sorry I didn't tell ye about having a son, I was afraid ye'd hate me.
But that's all the secrets, I swear."Also, John Grey better show up a lot more in the next book, because I fail to see how he could possibly be a character so beloved he warrants his own series.
I'M ABSOLUTELY SPEECHLESS!!!!!!!!! I don't even know where to begin with my review. I suppose I'll have to think on it a bit... JUST KNOW... there are not enough stars in the sky. As I work my way through this series.... I am just dumbfounded at the awesomeness before me. And this book, by far my favorite so far in the series... words cannot express my love for these characters, and this story. But again, it's one of those stories that enraptures those ONLY that it's meant to. And I am definitely on that list!!!!!![image error]
In 'Ferne Ufer' besuchen wir zusammen mit Jamie und Claire so viele alte und bekannte aber auch neue und unbekannte Orte.
Und dabei denkt man jedes Mal, dass man hautnah mit dabei ist, weil einem die Umgebung so toll geschildert wird, dass ich bei den Szenen auf See teilweise fast genauso seekrank wurde wie Jamie!
Auch konnte man viele geliebte und vielleicht auch nicht so geliebte Charaktere spielten wieder ihre Rolle aber auch viele tolle neue wurden vorgestellt.
Und das Ende war - wie nach den ersten beiden Büchern nicht anders zu erwarten - wieder ein fieeeeser Cliffhanger 😱🙆🏼
⭐⭐⭐⭐ ! Claire and Jamie are finally reunited after twenty years apart. Has their love managed to survive the 20 year long separation?"It has always been forever for me, sassenach."“Voyager” is definitley my new favorite book in this series. It was pretty much perfection for me and it pains me not to give this 5 stars. I have absolutely no complaints about the first 50-60%. It was still good after that, but I significantly lost interest to my big dismay. But this is still one of the best books I'
Has their love managed to survive the 20 year long separation?"It has always been forever for me, sassenach."“Voyager” is definitley my new favorite book in this series.
I found “Voyager” much more fast paced than Dragonfly in Amber, which was probably a big reason I loved it as much as I did.
I also found that the time jumps from Jamie and Claire, added to the story.
I don't know how long we sat there on the dusty floor, crying in each others arms with the longing of twenty years spilling down our faces."Jamie and Claire are now twenty years older, but still (about 200 years) apart We get to learn about their seperate lives in their separate times.
I want to love Jamie's daughter.
***4.5 mis hormonas no tienen nada que ver STARS*** ¿Quién ama a Jamie Fraser?YOOOOO siii 🙋🏻🙋🏻🙋🏻🙋🏻😏 ¡Que me haga mil hijos! 🤰🏻 Esste... digo, que es un maldito el Canijo!!!! (Que mal pensadas eh! )Mira que hacerle eso a mí Claire! No no no, Jamie Malo 😤😤😤He durado meeeeeeses con este libro. Pero es por mis locuras solamente. Pues lo fui leyendo junto con la serie 🙃QUE PEDAZO DE LIBRO SEÑORAS Y SEÑORES! 🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻Es que es imposible describir las sensaciones, emociones y demás que generó en
🙇🏻‍♀️🙇🏻‍♀️🙇🏻‍♀️El único pero que puedo ponerle es el final, pues ODIO LOS FINALES ABIERTOS, 🙄pero sabiendo que está historia es INTERMINABLE, supongo que debo pasarlo por alto.😅Un libro imprescindible, ❤️un amor épico que supera las barreras del tiempo.
es mucho mejor que la serie, el primero me había sorprendido por su insuperable adaptación pero en este me he sentido un poco decepcionada pues mi imaginación supero con creces a las imágenes de la serie.
Jamie and Claire have just parted ways…him to go back and face his grisly death on Culloden field and her to go back through the stones at Craigh na Dun so she can bring her and Jamie’s child safely into the world.The book then takes us through the next twenty years, telling us what exactly happened to the separated lovers.
But Ian and the treasure are taken by pirates and Claire and Jamie set out to recover him.I know that many people love this series and just talk about how great it is.
I can't stop reading these damn books.
UPDATE OCTOBER 2017:It was even better second time around. I had missed so many details first time I read it. “Only you," he said, so softly I could barely hear him. "To worship ye with my body, give ye all the service of my hands. To give ye my name, and all my heart and soul with it. Only you. Because ye will not let me lie--and yet ye love me.”  EPIC STORY. PHENOMENAL WRITING.This is without a doubt my all time favourite series!To read my reviews of previous books, click on pic: .
He's the strongest, burliest, cleverest Scot in Scotland!) (2) Claire survives her third, apparently death-defying trip, through the stones (okay, she's tough too, I'll go along with that), then (3) finds Jamie, witnesses a murder, hangs out in a brothel, loses a nephew, gets caught in a fire (Jamie miraculously survives breaking glass and crumbling stairs), saves the nephew (who set the fire and killed suspicious seaman IN said fire) then (4) finds out Jamie's been married (to the erstwhile Laoghaire of novel #1 who is, yes!
Now my paperback copy is 1,059 pages and I have read Voyager quite a few times and  it is still my #1 favorite in the series.SPOILERS AHEAD  Why?
From Brianna and Claire's heartwarming good-bye to Jamie &Claire's reunion to all the action at Lallybroch and beyond, prepare yourself for a lot of adventure.
Voyager is filled with Jamie and Claire 's missing years.
The turmoil of post Culloden Scotland, Claire and Frank's difficult marriage, Jamie's time in prison, Claire's road to M.D., and a few surprises that keep us readers on our toes.
To this day, I find it very easy to lose track of time especially when reading this particular novel.
THIS BOOK WAS MASSIVE!!!
The first half of the book was so good and made me so happy after the heart wrenching ending from Dragonfly in Amber.
But then, the last half of the book was so slow.
Even though it was super entertaining, the "Voyager" part of the book really dragged on.
I feel like Diana could have moved things on a bit.
The first book is still my favorite, it's nice to go on these adventure with Jamie and Claire, I just don't know how I'm going to relate to the characters now that they are older.
If I weren't so invested in Jamie and Claire I can say with certainty that the third installment in Gabaldon's time-traveling-trash-romance-for-lit-nerds-history-beast-of-a-book almost had me calling it quits on this series.
I loved it.I hated it.I was weirded out by it.If you take out all of the unnecessary fluff and weed your way through the weird shit, VOYAGER is an incredible book.
Like....really, really, really, weird.Oh and let's not forget all the happy little "coincidences".
Actually, this book could have been called "Jamie and Claire and all the Perfectly Timed Coincidences" and it would fit perfectly.
Even though I had planned to take a bit of a break between books, I ended up waiting only a couple of weeks before starting Voyager.
I did start to feel a bit exhausted from this book towards the end.
This is not a series that you would want to read out of order and I don't think that this book would work at all as a stand-alone novel.
Initial ThoughtsI loved it but I have to admit that this book was starting to feel a bit long.
Wonderful story, wonderful characters, and an excellent narrator...but did I mention how long this book is.

(By the way, I’m sad Master Raymond is gone.)Why didn’t Claire tell Jamie about Laoghaire’s actions in Outlander?
(I peeked at spoilers and know it will come up in Drums of Autumn.) Will Claire meet other time-travelers?
Loved getting wrapped up in the world of Jamie Fraser and Claire Randall.
Fast forward twenty years later after the last book, and Claire decides to go back through the stones to find her long lost love.
In the beginning I fell right in and never wanted it to end.
However, this was the first book in the series where I began to feel it was all a little much.
Over the top- constantly falling into situation after situation that all felt a little too convenient.
I also (for the first time) felt that this book was too long.
But so much of the book either frustrated or upset me that in the end, I must conclude that it is time to part ways.As with the two previous installments, it takes absolutely forever to get to the real meat of the story, the part people are actually waiting for.
I understand these books need conflict to sustain them, but I don’t need my blood pressure shooting up every time we learn of some encounter Jamie had with a woman (or man) in his past that has serious repercussions to his relationship with Claire.
I cheated and flipped through pages of "Voyager" to get closure some weeks ago but now it is finally time to read and enjoy the book in full...Once again, Gabaldon doesn't disappoint.
When our couple get together, Gabaldon takes us on an emotional roller-coaster ride as Jamie and Claire try to re-discover each other and come to terms with their dark secrets of the past and their time apart, they are also forced to undertake a lot of traveling when all they want is to be together.
Tiene absolutamente todo para ser una novela íntegra: aventuras, misterio, intrigas, momentos emotivos y sobrecogedores, descripciones históricas y de época impecables, nuevos personajes y el reencuentro con otros, donde, por supuesto, destaca el de Claire y Jamie (creo que ese capítulo lo leí como tres veces para no perder ni el más mínimo detalle), logrando un exquisito equilibro entre la timidez de volver a reunirse y la pasión que los une en forma casi instintiva.
Además, la autora sigue traspasando su estilo mordaz e ingenioso a los diálogos, haciendo que la lectura, a pesar de lo extensa que es, en ningún momento decaiga.
O carte superba! Două perspective interesante, o reîntâlnire emoționantă și șocuri. Răsturnări de situație, emoții și temeri cât cuprinde, aventuri neașteptate. De toate astea am avut parte citind această carte! Claire și Jamie sunt o pereche deosebita!
Eso sí, releerlo en inglés ha sido como leer un libro nuevo, hay una gran diferencia con la traducción antigua.He tenido momentos en los que no podía con mi vida de la emoción y otros en los que he recordado por qué siempre digo que la Gabaldon es una rollera, este libro podría ser menos pesado (literal y metafóricamente) si esta señora supiera resumir y evitarnos tanto detalle.Pero no puedo bajarle las cinco estrellitas porque ningún libro de la serie te llega tanto al corazoncito como éste, con esa primera visita a la imprenta...

As with the first book, I found myself being extremely frustrated with Claire throughout Voyager.
That is obviously a sore subject for me, Claire's double standard way of thinking....so I will leave it alone now.Anyway, I liked the addition of the new characters...especially LJG.
I for one think John Grey is in incredibly interesting addition to the series, and while I realize that fans either love him or hate him...i personally love him, and am even more excited to read his side books that tie into the main series.So, to wrap up....I enjoyed Voyager quite a bit.
