(A-) 82% | Very GoodNotes: It’s about obstinate idealism, social mobility, and how knightly ambition means stumbling into other people’s drama.
A memorable friendship Dunc and Egg make a wonderful pair.
Ser Duncan is not only a knight in name, but also one in deed.
There are few true knights and even fewer when the events of  A Song of Ice and Fire take place.
Their first (The Hedge Knight ) is by far my favourite.
In addition to this, the illustration did help a lot to capture the essence of the story.
It’s starting to get a little ridiculous now, and the afterward didn’t help things: ol’ Georgy suggests that there are more tales from the pair to come.
We follow Dunk, a hedge knight risen up by an old knight with no heirs.
“Oak and iron guard me well, or else I’m dead and doomed to hell.” We see Dunk get himself into all kinds of scrapes, including a trial of seven as well as numerous other fights.
He is a great hero to follow and I loved recognising the names of houses from A Song of Ice and Fire.
They all look the same after a few days on a spike.”  With much of the gruesomeness and swearing included in A Song of Ice and Fire; this book helped in my suffering wait for the Winds of Winter.
It's not a shock though that Martin can make me enjoy something that I typically hate.This book contains 3 novellas about the adventures of Dunk and Egg. A hedge knight and his squire seeking higher status.
I know that Martin has a few more stories about Dunk and Egg, so hopefully in the future I'd read about Dunk being successful in his journey.
It's better if you find out about the mystery of Egg on your own.The setting is great, but that's a giveaway already if you've read the ASOIAF series.
Upozorenje:čitanje ove knjige izaziva nostalgiju i čežnju za svetom Vesterosa, te čitanju iste pristupite na sopstvenu odgovornost.Ocena:4.5*Sastavni deo ovog prikaza je i House Targaryen family tree :)
If you're into stuff like this, you can read the full review.Ser Duncan the Tall: "A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms" by George R.
To wit: The Hedge KnightThe Sworn SwordThe Mystery Knight I’ve read these three novellas previously when they came out in the three different anthologies: Legends I, Legends II, and Warriors.
I have nothing at all against it – it’s just that I enjoy good science fiction more than I enjoy good fantasy.
Several people told me to read the first book in his "A Song of Ice and Fire" saga, "A Game of Thrones".
Read on, if you're into the Ice and Fire Saga.
I told myself why not read something short by GRRM for once.This book is a collection of three novellas, set in the Seven Kingdoms, a century before A Game of Thrones, while the Targaryens are still the ruling House in Westeros.Characters:Dunk, Ser Duncan the Tall, a hedge knight and his squire Egg, Aegon Targaryen (little brother of Aemon Targaryen, who we know from the Wall in ASOIAF) travel the Seven Kingdoms together.
Dunk is a pretty plain character apart from his tallness.
It's Egg who actually makes those novellas worth reading.Plot:A tournament, a trial, weapons.
Another tournament, another trial and more weapons.
This is my Book Of the Month- September 2016, with GR group- Nothing But Reading Challenges- Category: Sci-Fi/Fantasy BOM "The story offered here takes place about a hundred years prior to the events described in A Game of Thrones" This was my major concern before picking this up as I have yet to read the Game Of Throne Series (I have watched all the seasons diligently) but still did not want any thing spoiling my enjoyment of reading this series. So you can absolutely pick this up and enjoy the
So you can absolutely pick this up and enjoy the mention of names of all the famous houses that we have come to adore and hate!This is a collection of 3 short stories involving Ser Dunkard The Tall i.e. Dunk and Egg (who becomes Dunk's squire).
I just wanted to read more about Dunk and Egg and hope there are more stories about them.["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>
Sure, there's such a small amount of fantasy in his work that, aside from mention of dragons in this particular book, it could almost be called historical fiction for its similarity to the York and Tudor War of the Roses back in the 15th century.A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms is a collection of three lengthy short stories that follow the adventures of a hedge knight and his squire.
And yet, the stakes aren't "Save the World or Bust!!!" high, which is a nice departure from the epic fantasy of the day.
I want him to finish A Song of Ice & Fire, a series that I love and that has, in a very real way, broadened my view of the power of books.
The world-building is awesome in A Song of Ice & Fire, but I don’t want to learn stuff just for the sake of learning stuff (especially stuff that is entirely made-up).
For instance, every other thing Dunk says to Egg is a variation of “I’m going to clout your ear.” I don’t know if there was a wager, in which GRR had to use the word “clout” X number of times, but if so, he won.
This book is no different.House Targaryen sits on the throne but we don't view the world from some little lordling's perspective, but from that of a hedge knight.
That alone was enough to give it five stars, but it was the method used to portray this history that I most liked.The style of narrative was different to what I expected: the reader is offered the limited perspective of only one character, we are distanced from the great houses and given the perspective from one with a lower social standing, and more is withheld from us, allowing us no further knowledge and understanding than what our protagonist can offer us.I found myself liking these aspects.
The hedge knight, though a real knight, is of the lowest order and the term itself is somewhat derogatory.Our hero, Dunc, naming himself Ser Duncan the Tall – for lack of a better title - was taken from the squalid environs of Fleas Bottom in King’s Landing by a traveling hedge knight and made his squire.
Final: 4.60Es el primer libro de George que termino, si todavía me falta un poco de "El Mundo de Hielo y Fuego" pero se les digo, George escribe de maravillas😻👌, su manera de contar historias es increíble, ya me sentía como un pinche caballero weiiiiii!!!!
Really, cada parte de la historia es simplemente enlazador, tengo que admitir que el ritmo no fue lo mejor, en algunas partes se tornó un poco lento, pero en general estuvo muy bien👌.
Me prometo a mi mismo terminar la enciclopedia de Westeros la otra semana, mejor digo a fin de mes para ser más realistas XD😅😂🤣.
I just finished reading the two graphic novels of The Hedge Knight and I had no idea this was the book form with a third story of the duo!
I know there has to be more to it then the graphic novels, but it seems like the book was the same.
I loved the first two stories in this book, and the graphic novels.
I had no idea how much I was going to fall in love with Dunk and Egg when I bought the first two graphic novels.
At the end of the book Mr. Martin says to look forward to more Dunk and Egg travels!
There is violence and maiming a plenty.One Hundred years before the events of the Game of Thrones timeline there was a hedge knight named Ser Duncan.
Along the way they run into Lords, Princes and many other famous houses from the GOT story.
You also find out about Egg.The second story is a little after those events and it's a very good one.
I wish they could have been in color but the black and white illustration are great representations of the events and they are plentiful-I loved that!
So as Dunk and Egg (his squire) travel about they are confronted with these consequences: lords who backed the wrong (though not in their mind) side, conspirators to return the Blackfyres, political discontent with the current regime who many believe is being controlled by a sorcerer bastard offspring of the previous king.There is a great balance of fights, character development, narrative progression, and political intrigue.
But the heart of these books is the relationship between Dunk (Ser Duncan the Tall) and Egg ((view spoiler)[(don't open this unless you really want to know) (view spoiler)[ (I'm serious, it is sort of the big reveal of the first novella) (view spoiler)[Aegon Targaryen V (hide spoiler)] (hide spoiler)] (hide spoiler)]).
These are their formative years, when a series of unlikely events will lead to a prince squiring for an ordinary hedge knight and how the two will shape, transform and help each other.The three stories in themselves aren't overtly spectacular, but Martin's characteristic storytelling and the vivid feeling of a more chivalrous, medieval setting (since we usually associate Song of Ice and Fire with the present, so to speak) gives the tales their charming flavor.
I don't have the ability nor patience to rewind (you can still say rewind right?) the recording back to listen to the part I just missed because the narrator whispered the line instead of stage-whispered the line so I could hear it with the same volume I had for normal talking.It's a pet-peeve of mine and typically on find it happens with the best of narrators.
On to some substance.A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms is the collection of Dunk and Egg novellas found in various anthologies (Legends, Legends II, and Warriors), all of which I already owned in print and the first of which I'd already read in print.These novellas are the perfect way to get back to the Seven Kingdoms when you feel yourself missing them.
Three short stories about Dunk and Egg. I was extremely excited to read this novel.
It was about the mysterious Egg, who Aemon loves.
How couldn't I be excited.
It was adventurous.
I wanted to see more people, like the Starks.
Also, I felt like there has to be more adventures.
Just kind of ended in the middle and I want to know what happens to Dunk and Egg. I know GRRM has other fish to fry, but I am left with what else happened.
I am left wanting more.Well now I must read the Fellowship of the Ring and my library book.
Plėstis apie šią knyga tikrai galima ir tikrai yra kur, tik...
Koks to tikslas?
Visi, kas skaitė tėtušio Martino "Ledo ir ugnies giesmę" žino, ko tikėtis ir arba loved it, arba, nors nežinau kodėl, bet visiškai meh'ed it.
Tad ir su "Septynių Karalysčių riteriu" tas pats.
Arba tau patiko pagrindinis ciklas ir tu sau smagiai myžčiosi iš laimės, kad gavai dar kažko susijusio su Targarijenais ir Geležiniu Sostu paskaityt, arba tau tas ciklas apskritai nepatiko ir tada šitos knygos nėra jokio reikalo išvis imt į rankas.
O aš nuo riterio kaifavau, atitinkamas ir įvertinimas.
5* ir, dėde Martinai, rašyk tą šeštą B£€╤ greičiau.
It's known!Mr Gianni, who also did the 2014 A Song of Ice and Fire calendar with a dozen choice scenes from the books, here has produced a grand total of 160 illustrations, all in black and white inking, some quite simple and minimalistic and others so detailed and intricate, in a beautiful style that calls to memory the old-school chivalry graphic novel "Prince Valiant" by artist Hal Foster, which is surely not a coincidence as Gary Gianni undertook the continuation of the franchise after Foster's death, though coloured and not inked as the story used to be in the beginning.
9/10Το τελευταίο (και 83ο) βιβλίο για φέτος είναι από τον πασίγνωστο George Martin. Για κάποιον λόγο, πίστευα ότι ήταν χειρότερο, μάλλον επειδή είχα ακούσει εδώ κι εκεί ότι είναι πιο ''παραμύθι'' από την πασίγνωστη σειρά ''το τραγούδι της φωτιάς και του πάγου''. Η γραφή είναι πολύ ωραία, ενώ και οι τρεις ιστορίες του Ντανκ και του Εγκ που υπάρχουν εδώ είναι πράγματι κάπως πιο χαλαρές σε ύφος, αφού υποβόσκει συχνά μια αίσθηση χιούμορ. Αυτή η λεπτομέρεια ωστόσο δεν χάλασε σε καμία στιγμή την αναγνωστική μου απόλαυση. Το βιβλίο το προτείνω άνετα σε όλους τους φαντασάδες.
bueno, son más bien tres historias que siguen a dos personajes muy curiosos y bastante dispares: Dunk y Egg. Vaya nombres, ¿eh?
Sin embargo, las aventuras de estos dos no son sencillas porque Dunk siempre mete la pata y termina enredado en los líos más increíbles de los siete reinos (?).
El caso es que sí, hay un montón de Targaryens, rebeliones, pretendientes, príncipes locos, disputas familiares, justas, matrimonios, guerras y muerte.Definitivamente tienen que leer este libro.
Pero, si ya los has leído y extrañas la narrativa de Martin, sus descripciones vívidas y la cantidad de muertos que hay en cada página(?), este libro es para ti.
'A century before A GAME OF THRONES, two unlikely heroes wandered Westeros.'A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms book is a prequel story of A Song of Ice and Fire.This book contains three novels:The Hedge KnightThe Sworn SwordThe Mystery KnightA Knight of the Seven Kingdoms book is more for the young readers.
The new readers may start reading A Game of Thrones or A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms but personally, I would advise and recommend the new readers to start read A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms because they will know the basic storyline of A Song of Ice and Fire and background.
A Game of Thrones is more higher level than A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms.
Αυτό το βιβλίο μου άρεσε πολύ περισσότερο από όσο φανταζόμουν. Οι ιστορίες –τρεις περιπέτειες στο σύνολο- ήταν διασκεδαστικότατες. Οι ήρωες, Νταγκ και Εγκ άκρως συμπαθητικοί. Η γλώσσα απλή και η αφήγηση αρκετά περιγραφική ώστε να μεταδώσει την κατάλληλη ατμόσφαιρα στον αναγνώστη. Βέβαια η απαγγελία τόσων πολλών ονομάτων και οι περιγραφές τους –ξεκάρφωτων ιπποτών- μπορεί κάλλιστα να γίνει κουραστική, απλώς εγώ στάθηκα τυχερή και το διάβαζα με καθαρό μυαλό. Στο σύνολο του ένα αρκετά ωραίο βιβλίο, άκρως… ιπποτικό!
Το βιβλίο αποτελείται από τις τρεις νουβέλες του Martin Ο Περιπλανώμενος Ιππότης,Το Ορκισμένο Σπαθί και Ο Μυστηριώδης Ιππότης που αφορούν τις περιπέτειες του Σερ Ντάνκαν του Ψηλού και του ακολούθου του Εγκ,90 χρόνια πριν αρχίσουν τα γεγονότα της σειράς.Πολύ καλογραμμένο,συμπαθής χαρακτήρες,συναρπαστικές συγκρούσεις και συνωμοσίες,περιπέτεια, αγωνία και προδοσία,κλασσικός Μάρτιν.Η ιστορία μιας μοναδικής και γλυκιάς φιλίας ανάμεσα σε ένα αφελή ιππότη τον Ντάνκαν τον Ψηλό και έναν έξυπνο μικρό πρίγκιπα.Όποιος έχει διαβάσει το Game of thrones θα ξέρει ότι ο Martin έχει ταλέντο στο να δημιουργεί ενδιαφέροντα ζευγάρια,π.χ η Arya και το κυνηγόσκυλο,Brienne και Jaime, Tyrion και Bronn.
I had SO MUCH FUN gallivanting around the Seven Kingdoms with Dunk and Egg, it was amazing to be immersed back into GRRM's epic high fantasy world..I absolutely adore ASOIAF, but even I realise that sometimes GRRM can ramble on a bit, especially during the big history dumps.
I loved all three of the sequences, but I think my fave was the second one, as I just loved Lady Rohanne!.It was also great to read a book set in the time of Targaryen rule; there are hints all through ASOIAF of their bad/mad/sad kings and princes, and we finally get to see some of them in action!
The author is giving his readers some real treats so yeah, he can have my money!Rounding off the three novellas about Ser Duncan the Tall and his squire Egg is some quite enchanting artwork (160 illustrations to be exact) by a very talented Gary Gianni.About the stories:GRRM has written 4 novellas about the World of A Song Of Ice And Fire so far.
And it was very nice of GRRM to say that those readers who already bought the novellas in anthologies should get more than just the same stories again so we all got these beautiful illustrations.
I just happen to live with a collector that has to own all the books in a series and I am unable to refuse a crisp new book showing up on my doorstep.
I instantly fell in love with the two main characters and was on the edge of my seat anticipating each and every moment.
Dunk is just perfection in my eyes and the author’s writing style blew me away with how it painted a mental picture of him.
With the author’s latest delay news (no surprise), I will no longer anticipate any kind of future with his writing in regards to this series.
A thousand eyes, and one.” *3.5 starsA fun, quick read.
Since the story takes place a hundred years before the events of ASOIAF, the Targaryens are still ruling Westeros, and I’m not going to lie; it was exciting to witness the famous Targaryen dynasty actually RULING (nowadays they just give long self-indulgent speeches,  ehem, ehem, Dany  ).
Don’t expect this to be nearly as complicated or intriguing as the original series, BUT you are going to have fun (knights, battles, betrayals and dragon eggs –what else could you possibly ask for?) AND meet the ancestors or relatives of some well-known characters (Master Aemon’s whole family, Tywin’s grandmother etc etc).
