Enid Blyton was my favourite author growing up and I devoured everything she wrote. I decided to re-read a few of her novels as an adult and I wasn't disappointed with this first novel in the mystery series. Naturally the mystery of the burnt cottage was very straightforward as an adult, but as a child I remember marvelling at the twists and turns in the plot. A must -read for children!
My dad used to read this series to me and I just love them. There are other series that are more famous by Enid Blyton, but this is the best. I highly reccommend them. Brilliant writing, good plots, and all about friendship and imagination. Who could go wrong with that?
As weekend approaches, it is nostalgia time. Even though this was the first mystery in the series, I read it quite later on. Now I remember only Fatty and Buster the Dog, though.Considered as mysteries, these were simple to the point of silliness, but I read most of them at the right age. So the stars are from my childhood self.I liked Fatty because he was fat - like me. It somehow boosted my ego that a fat boy could be clever.
This time around I’ve decided to read all 15 of the books chronologically for the first time.The Mystery of the Burnt Cottage is the first of the series and opens with siblings Laurence “Larry” and Margaret “Daisy” Daykin waking up to the smell of a fire.
Soon they find themselves forming a “detective” club of sorts (thus becoming the Five Findouters and Dog) in which they reluctantly include Fatty (who they name after his initials F.A.T. and appearance) and little Bets, starting on their investigations and trying to stay a step ahead of their village constable Mr Goon, who pretty much enters the scene with his trademark clear orfs.
A student member of our book club read this, so I decided to give it a read.
What a charming story about 5 kids and a dog.
It took me back to my childhood, although I wasn't around at the writing of this book.
I loved the English phrases/accents!
"I'll be ready in a tick." Love that!
Childhood innocence, with a tad of mischief, and always in good manners.
I enjoyed it primarily for the 1940s, English countryside, kids viewpoint of the world, reading experience.
Just a simple, feel good read.
I guess I am a kid at heart!
Seems like I'll be diving back into my childhood... Came across these series again and it reminded me of the days when I bunked lectures just to read these books in library.. Got an urge to read them back...;) Can't help it these were the books that made me keep on reading...
I bought it in 2009 when I decided to read an english books.
I read it twice but I could not complete it because of the hard vocabulary.
To let you know english is my second language.
Furthermore I challenged myself to read The Mystery of the Burnt Cottage even if it is children book.
I liked the begging of the story when the cottage was burnt and how the 5 children and Buster the dog decided to know who burnt the cottage because they know the police man will be late from solve the crime.
I knew the children will know who burnt the cottage but really I was surprised from the ending.
Finally, I've already finished this book. I like to read mystery book. I chose this book because I used to read books that Enid Blyton write. This novel is easy to read because The writer, she used easy vocabulary and didn't have complex sentences. This novel is about five children and one dog. They want to find that who burnt Mr. Hick's cottage. All of them are clever and really observant. If you want to read a childreb novel with easy vocabulary and funny, I will suggest you to read this book!
This book is about 5 children who would like to find the truth about the person who burn the cottage. I enjoyed to read this book and want to be one of the find-outers too. In my opinion, I think the hero of this story is Buster if he doesn't good nose for snuff, maybe they can't find the real suspect.
I was struggling a bit to think of a children's classic that was not a young adult novel (I Capture the Castle) or a picture book (Winnie the Pooh) or anything by Frances Hodgson Burnett (ha, well, I might read The Secret Garden anyway...), when luckily Christophe came along and suggested his childhood fav  The Find-Outers .I would have easily loved this series when I was eight. It's still very charming now. It has a fantastic sense of humour -- the 'Find-Outers' being kid-speak for detectives,

It has a fantastic sense of humour -- the 'Find-Outers' being kid-speak for detectives, naming the grumpy policeman Clear-Orf because he's always yelling 'Clear off!', for example.
It's a short and quick children's book, and yet a lot of the adults feel fully formed, with their own mannerisms and defects, loyalties and blind spots.
3,75 stars - English pocketbook - I have dyslexia -Youth sentiment. 😀😁😀🦋🌺🌹🌸
Having read most of these delightful whodunnits by the age of 10 I still hadn't got hold of the first book in the series which gives a lot of important background for a fan.
The framework is; "Crime" happens; Self-important policeman tells pesky kids to "Clear Orf" before jumping to the wrong conclusion; Fatty isn't convinced and leads a parallel investigation in which he makes use of a bewildering array of disguises; Larry, Daisy and Pip are there so that Fatty can show off (and help to pad the stories out by following up unimportant leads); Various clues are found and discussed; Bets solves the case without knowing why; Fatty realises this (like Poirot who sometimes needs Hastings); The Find-Outers go over Goon's head to a superior (Inspector Jenks) who recognises Fatty's brilliance and the criminal is arrested.
Cute but enjoyable short story from the mind of Enid Blyton. It's always a joy to read her novels - even when I disagree with a lot of the attitudes portrayed by the characters.Look forward to reading more of this series c:(view spoiler)[Mr. Hicks was the villain after all - tadaaaaa! What a surprise :P (hide spoiler)]
'The Mystery of the Burnt Cottage' is the first in the series (there are 15 titles in all) featuring the Five Find-Outers and Dog and we are introduced to the characters:Frederick Algernon 'Fatty' Trotteville, a generous sole whose nickname comes from his initials FATLaurence 'Larry' Daykin, the eldest of the five and the leader in this first taleMargaret 'Daisy' Daykin, Larry's younger sister.
They also meet up with a new boy in the village who has his dog with him and he turns out to be Frederick Algernon Trotteville who the other four eventually nickname Fatty, after his initials.
Going back to days of carefreeness, the Series is Definitely one of my favorite when it comes to children's book. Read it whenever you want something light hearted to read. For some, it may be non realistic, hypothetical storyline, but come on! That's why we read books right?Short, precise story, with a new plot twist in almost every chapter, it delivers what is takes to be called a mystery story to a decent level.
The review is about all the 15 books of the series.
They're all pretty much the same after all.
Still, there is something about these books which never stops fascinating me.
I'm going back to them over and over again even today, many years after I've reached adulthood.
Although I recognize their weaknesses, although I see the flawed ideas behind many seemingly innocent sentences, I can't help but enjoying them every time I pick one of them up to read it for 1000th time!
** Books 287 - 2016 **3 of 5 stars! I expect more from this children detective story but i think it is good enough for me :)Thank you Bookmate!
Pertama ketemu Fatty, lucu juga. Masih anak-anak banget semuanya. Ketika disuruh tutup mulut karena jelas sekali sombongnya, Fatty masih tersinggung. Dibuku-buku selanjutnya Fatty sudah agak cool kalau digitukan, sedang Larry dkk juga sudah tidak terlalu sebal kalau Fatty sudah mulai menyombongkan diri lagi.
Loved this series of books as a child. These fuelled my liking for the crime/thriller/mystery genres of books, which I still love reading today.
Η αγαπημένη μου παιδική σειρά βιβλίων, με το Φρέντυ το Χοντρούλη να είναι ο αγαπημένος μου παιδικός ήρωας, ενώ ο Μπάστερ είναι ο σκύλος που ονειρευόμουνα να έχω (αν και περισσότερο νομίζω ότι ταυτιζόμουν με τη μικρή Μπέττυ!!)Αυτό είναι το πρώτο βιβλίο της σειράς, αν και το έβδομο στα ελληνικά, όπου γνωρίζουμε τα παιδιά, τον γκαφατζή αστυνομικό (πάντα μου φαινόταν κάπως σαν τον αστυνόμο Σαΐνη με την ανηψιά του, μόνο που εκεί συνεργάζονταν αντί να είναι αντίπαλοι).
Ο πανέξυπνος χοντρούλης δίνει ως συνήθως τη λύση στην έρευνα, παρόλο που ακόμα είναι ο καινούριος της παρέας και του φέρονται κάπως απόμακρα ακόμα οι υπόλοιποι που γνωρίζονται πολλά χρόνια.
I didn't really read any Blyton as a child. Now, reading them as an adult, I feel as though I was really missing out on something wonderful.This series is absolutely charming. It really takes me back to that feeling as a child that anything is possible. The characters are lovable, especially little Bets, and going on this adventure with them is a thoroughly enjoyable experience. I would recommend this book (and the series in general) to anyone who enjoys a spot of mystery, especially for children or for adults who wish to recapture a sense of wonder.
62 - 2015Baca ulang lagi, tapi sekarang buku edisi baru ini untuk koleksi sendiri ;))===========448 - 2012Baca ulang, sebelum bukunya dikirim ke ponakan ;)Pasukan Mau Tahu dibentuk di buku pertama ini. Karena Fatty baru berkenalan dan berteman dengan kelompok Larry, Pip, Daisy dan Bets, maka tentu saja ketuanya adalah Larry. Baru di jilid-jilid berikutnya Fatty bakal menjadi tokoh sentral, boleh dibilang pemimpin, dari Pasukan Mau Tahu.Buku cover baru ini ada foto para pemerannya, tapi kok... Fatty tidak gendut ah! Bongsor sih iya.
I remember that when I was younger I would get read this story as a bedtime story. If I remember correctly I liked the series then and I still loved the book. I like how children solved the mystery before the police men. I also really like the style Enid Blyton write in non complex sentences and easy vocabulary. This book is suitable to read to children and for older children to read. I liked that all the characters had there stereotypical role with in the group. I would definitely recommend this book.
The first in the series (I'm reading them totally out of order, by the way) sees the Find Outers come together for their first mystery.
It's good to see the others doubting Fatty's genius, and sneering at Bets.
They soon change their tune!
You see, Bets and Fatty (and Buster of course!) become my favorite characters over time, so it's good to see the others doubting and being shown up.
The whole group isn't sure how to tackle a mystery, and that's part of the fun.
It was a good mystery, and a fun book.
A great series too!
I think it is a great little book with a lot of small time humour. It may be a children's mystery book, but like any good mystery book, it fills you with surprise and is great for any age groups. The story is very unsuspecting, keeping the culprit hidden till the very ending. For a children's book, it still fills the grown-ups with suspense, and surprises you at the end. Great Book from Enid Blyton.
My favourite Enid Blyton series - the characters are so much fun and hey, how could you not love disguises, bamboozled policemen and villainous villains?
Nice to revisit childhood favourites on my Kindle :-)
Adoro ler livros como esse que me faz relembrar minha infância , quando devorava livros da coleção vaga-lume.Li quase todos!
It has to be 5stars for taking me back 50 years and now I'm able to discuss the book with my 9 year old granddaughter!!
As a kid, my favourite Enid Blyton mystery stories were those of the Five Find-Outers (and dog), over the Famous Five or Secret Seven.
I've decided to re-evaluate these stories as an adult, and THE MYSTERY OF THE BURNT COTTAGE is the first in the series.This isn't as good as the later books in the series, mainly because the mystery is a little mundane.
The kids go around questioning suspects and looking at a couple of clues before the solution is handed to them on a plate.
Mainly this is a set-up for the introduction of the characters, who are a lot of fun.
