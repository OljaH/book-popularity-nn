and after poking about on Google for a bit, I was interested to find an interview where Pullman said Lindsay was indeed one of the people who had influenced him most.
Next thing we know, his magn has become a tough third arm, which can reach out towards other people and suck the life from their bodies.
And the book's barely got warmed up yet.It's uneven, and some bits make more sense than others, but no one else has written anything quite like it.
The book is a modern Pilgrim's Progress, a moral parable, a snare and, until the last few pages, a deception.Lindsay was, at best, a pedestrian writer, incapable of conrete characterization.
The path of the protagonist is transformative and darkly revelatory.One is reminded of another metaphysical fiction, another modern Pilgrim's Progress, viz.
But while Lewis is defending the establishment, retelling the biblical tale in modern terms, Lindsay, after exploring it rather convincingly, demolishes it and replaces it with something like a Teutonic hero's gnostic saga.When first finishing this book, I was profoundly upset, shaken to the core of my unthinking adolescent presuppositions.
Well, uh, hmmm.
This is definitely something.The writing style and character depictions are both subpar, but the narrative of events and allegory are something wildly original, especially for the 1920s.
This book resembles a Gnostic version of the Pilgrim's Progress written by Philip K.
Dick in the post-VALIS period.This book would hardly fit into the genre of 'scifi'.
That term, too often used as an insult, could not adequately describe the book at its best.
A Gnostic manifesto?
Asimovian ego death?People grow new limbs and everything is in strange colors.
There's a struggle for life and death and the creation of the universe somewhere.
Like everything truly excellent, it begins with a séance and an assortment of oddball characters ere the reader finds himself with the protagonist, Maskull, newly awoken upon the gravity-juiced planet of Tormance and, thus, in orbit about the plasmatic sphere known as Arcturus.
It is at this point that the infamous Magn first makes its tentacular appearance, and the remainder becomes a pleasingly puzzling and puzzlingly pleasing extraterrestrial excursion in which the Shake 'n Bake™ with which an individual existence has been coated becomes eaten/removed/flaked through conscious concentration/collision/recollection/contemplation in order to expose the immaterial heart of true being pumping in metaphysical rhythm within.
Or something like that.
Arcturus’a Yolculuk, hikâyeciliğin ve hikâyelerle mest olmuş/olan insanoğlunun zihninin ayartıcı ve aldatıcı yönünü göstermek için onun silahlarını ona karşı kullanıyor.Yapı ve ilerleyiş tanıdık; dil akıcı ve sade.
Şeytan kavramının, dünyayı yaratımındaki rolünden bahseden mitlere kadar giden kökleri ve tanrının adı ve dünya ile olan ilişkisinin devamlı farklı yorumlanması; inanç tarihi ile azıcık ta olsa haşır neşir olmuşsanız, pekte yabancısı olmayacağınız konular (özellikle ikincisi için sadece yaşadığımız dünyaya bir bakış atmak bile yeterli).Bizim dünyamıza kıyasla her yönüyle hayaller âlemi gibi duran Tormance’ın bilinçli varlıkları, içinde yaşadıkları rüya âlemini kendi iç dinamiklerinde yorumlayıp akılcılaştırıyorlar.
The one thing that struck me were the characters' wonderfully ridiculous* names, which you would think would completely undercut the power of the story somehow and force it to seem all at least a little bit silly, however this is not the case.
His stones help propel his craft: now isn't that cute (and so true!).It is a fully-realized world and I can't help but wonder if it influenced Jack Vance's enjoyable and highly detailed entertainments.
"Arcturus" obviously has bigger fish to fry than simply entertaining you.
In other terms, the names, like the story itself, are oddly harmonious hybrids that against all odds work.

Το "Ταξίδι στον Αρκτούρο" κυκλοφόρησε το 1920 οπότε δεν περίμενα να διαβάσω για διαστημόπλοια και λέιζερ στο διάστημα.
Ήταν ακριβώς αυτό που περίμενα να είναι, ένα μυθιστόρημα με φιλοσοφικό χαρακτήρα που όμως δεν του λείπει η φαντασία.
Ο Λίντσεϊ μας περιγράφει το ταξίδι του Μάσκαλ, τον θαυμαστό και περίεργο κόσμο του Αρκτούρου, τους ξεχωριστούς κατοίκους του, όλα μέσα από το πρίσμα της επιστημονικής φαντασίας αλλά επικεντρώνεται στις σχέσεις των ατόμων, τις σκέψεις τους, τις πράξεις και τις συνέπειες αυτών, κάτι που του δίνει έντονη φιλοσοφική χροιά.
Συχνά φέρνει σε πρώτο πλάνο τη θέση της γυναίκας στην κοινωνία (έστω αυτήν του Αρκτούρου) και ακόμη δεν είμαι απόλυτα σίγουρη ποια είναι η άποψη του συγγραφέα ή τουλάχιστον ποια είναι αυτή που προβάλλεται μέσω του μυθιστορήματος.
I’m paraphrasing here, but he essentially says, “If you want to find a man who really believes in himself, check out an insane asylum.” This sentiment perfectly sums up my impression of The Voyage to Arcturus, in that it is pretending to be a thing that it isn’t – perhaps it is really wanting you to think that it knows where it’s going – but in the end, it really, really doesn’t.
How I first came to learn about David Lindsay's A Voyage to Arcturus was in a strange cookbook I saw in the early 1970s written by a hippie who decided to use as the heading of each page a recommended book title.
(Does anyone reading this review know of this odd cookbook?)It is particularly apt that A Voyage to Arcturus is as strange as the way I first came to learn of the book.
What I thought at first was a science fiction novel (based solely on its title) turned out to be a spiritual quest that is just happens to be set on a distant planet named Tormance that circles Arcturus, which in the book is a double star consisting of Branchspell and Alppain.
What is the relation of what we feel to what actually is?Ostensibly, we have a curious protagonist offered a chance to visit a strange planet orbiting a distant binary star system.
But that could only be because I lack the memory or intelligence to recall my past associations with those literature.When our hero wakes on the planet, he is alone and has inexplicably gained the function of several new appendages.
In the final land, he falls in love with a singular being and by then he is already so close to the truth, this emotion is sharp and distinct, made real by his proximity to pain.
It's small but extremely dense, like that lens that Krag gives Maskull at the beginning, an object the size of an egg that weighs over twenty pounds and contains the key to deciphering the universe.My original review below still stands, but I wanted to add some thoughts.
But it is exceptionally powerful as a parable, and Lindsay's creativity qualifies as genius, especially so when considering he wrote it in the 1920s.More than a parable, the entire novel feels like a transcribed dream.
On the other hand, if the reader has had a life-long suspicion that things are not really what they seem, and that most solutions offered to answer your questions are actually empty shells, and has also had a heart-felt desire to get behind the curtain to get a glimpse of the real workings of the universe, then A Voyage to Arcturus may grab you immediately and feel like one of the most important novels you've ever read.
(And that's assuming I absorbed it now, which I'm more than a little hesitant about claiming.) I've been too young to read it and too old, but I don't know if I was ever just right.The book follows Maskull, who, with a character named Nightspore, is given the opportunity to travel to Tormance, a planet which revolves around Arcturus.
One of these observers (Maskull) is then invited by the stranger to visit Arcturus, a planet in a distant binary star system.
He awakes on Arcturus abandoned by his companions and finds himself now in possession of an alien body with strange appendages and new sense organs.Things then get stranger by the page as he Maskull journeys across this new planet, drawn northwards and encountering an array of alien beings who briefly accompany him on his travels.
That is, preconceptions I might have had had I not read the spoiler ridden introduction first.
All in all it was fairly hard work but should appeal to those that like reading a narrative that consists mainly of philosophical musings and descriptions of deeply imaginative environments.
I'm so happy to finally get a copy of this gorgeous Savoy edition of this confounding book! I read this a few years ago with mixed reactions, and I just know I didn't give it a proper chance (I read it in little bits and pieces, often interrupted, while I was supposed to be working - not a very conducive atmosphere for tackling a book with so much substance!) I look forward to encountering it again properly with this luxurious, definitive edition.
Para que se entienda, "Viaje a Arcturus" parece esos episodios cósmicos de "Hora de Aventuras" pero protagonizados por un Finn de treinta y tantos años y todavía más raro que la famosa serie de televisión.La historia nos narra las peripecias de Maskull, el símbolo del hombre corriente, profundamente físico y material, por el planeta Arcturus al que le han llevado sus dos extraños acompañantes, Krag y el taciturno Nightspore.
Pero, y en mi opinión muy afortunadamente, ni Moore ni internet nos aclaran todos las metáforas y claves que Lindsay deja aquí y allá en su relato, me parece fundamental que una novela, sobre todo tan rara como esta, se guarde misterios y enigmas que desentrañar y disfrutar en nuevas relecturas.
This book is the most meaningful thing to ever happen to me. If anyone knows of other books similar to it, pleaseLet me know
I forget...] -134: cool use of the word "apercu", an insight, experienced during Maskull's epiphanies -165: in a book full of unexamined, Platonic assumptions, this line is welcome relief: "With his racial prejudices, Maskull found little beauty in it, yet beauty there was, though neither of a masculine or feminine type..." [about Leehallfae, who by the way uses a 3rd-gender pronoun, ae.] -182: "a hitherto unperceived bend" in a path opens up, cool way to move the action quickly -183: "Maskull felt the fresh, mysterious thrill of mingled pain and rapture of one who awakes from a deep sleep in midwinter and sees the gleaming, dark, delicate colors of the half-dawn." Rare moments like this, where the language returns to earth, seem to display David Lindsay's talent even more than the worldbuilding.
The best key I can offer to the esoteric text is the recurrent symbolism of "Gnostic duality": the twin-suns of the planet Tormance; Branchspell and Alppain, rugged adventurer Maskull, likewise sighting them, in the Starkness-tower and then later his 'true self'; the introverted (and possibly War-traumatised) Nightspore ascends the Muspel-tower at the novel's climax, and of course Lindsay's "new primary colours" of jale and ulfire.On Tormance, Maskull(/Nightspore)'s search for the 'divine' truth is blighted by the deceitful and demiurgic Shaping/Crystalman; whose ghastly, sneering 'death-mask' reccurs in a nightmarish triumph, on those who perish in the pilgrimmage.
A huge influence on C.S. Lewis' 'Space Trilogy' though as Michael Moorcock reflected in a Guardian article Lewis didn't share Lindsay's "God-questioning genius".Anyone who desires an escape from the mundane, should give this one time.
This world is apparently Tormance, the single planet encircling the binary star Arcturus, a world that seems to draw Maskull with magnetic compunction that he can or will not resist, even when a terrible voice in the night declares that the journey will mean his death.In a desserted observatory in Scotland, where Krag claims their pilgrimage will begin, are bottles containing "back rays", encapsulated fragments of light that travel back to their source of origin instead of outwards.
At one point, after drinking the water from a sacred stream and becoming conversant with the working of his first new sensory organs, Lindsay describes Maskull's experience as "a symphony of the senses", and in fact, the whole book reads like this, even the chapters taking place on earth.
But once our characters reach Tormance - a planet circling the star Arcturus - the adventure begins in earnest, in a world where the spiritual takes physical form, and our hero Maskull battles a zoo of tempters and diverse philosophies as he strives reach the Blue Sun, and free his soul from the dreariness of everyday life.
Here though, it clashes, and Lindsay risks loosing his reader before truly commencing his story.
To place the normality of early Edwardian England at odds with eerie Tormance perhaps, and so emphasise the illusion of everyday life?
"I can't believe you're going to force yourself to finish that book."- "Life is a struggle.""You're going to rip it up and give Manny Rayner paper cuts until he dies."So I stopped. I really did try. Not only did Manny mention it in his review of my book, Lisa: A Chess Novel but I'm giving science fiction the old college try. Hoyle's The Black Cloud is next.Arcturus is everything I feared sci-fi would be.
A man takes an interstellar journey to discover truths of the spirit.
These are not the kind of spiritual truths that are liable to make anybody happy.
Somewhere between The Wizard of Oz and HP Lovecraft.A unique book, but not an enjoyably written one.
It explains a lot, though--from Elric to Gene Wolfe to Clive Barker and more.
I thought I understood what gnosticism was about, and that it was no longer a Thing.
Nope.
I understood almost nothing, and it's still a Thing.
See the Supernatural TV show.
So not a great work of fiction, but an interesting key to other work, and an apt philosophical demonstration.
I am not sure what to make of this classic science fiction novel - it was more a philosophical metaphor than the space travel adventure story that I had hoped for. I don't think that I understood what Lindsay was trying to say. The final two chapters in particular confused me with (view spoiler)[Nightspore apparently being Maskull (a Maskull who survived the death of the main character but also existed before his death) & Krag being Surtur which was pain on Earth. (hide spoiler)]
And Tormance is a luscious world, at first appearing like the world of Avatar, but quickly becoming an acid trip of the highest order, a world in which our hero Maskull encounters strange people and stranger places one after the other, and leaves piles of bodies in his wake.Throughout his journeys, Maskull's body is constantly being modified to adapt to his new environments, and he grows appendages of tentacles and third arms and various eyes that change his personality and relationship to the outside world.
it is a work of high-pulp art, which can be an operatic kind of art, where characters are drawn broadly and shallow, and speak like bloated German philosophers: "'This world, which lies extended before us, has three directions.
Swept from Victorian England to a distant planet, everyman Maskull begins an epic journey of discovery through that alien environment towards its metamorphic gods. A third of the way into his journey, Maskull encounters a violently sexual woman, murders her husband, demands her obedience, and then has her sing a song while they travel. Its "words were pure nonsenseor else their significance was too deep for him" (113). The same can well be said of this entire book. A Voyage to Arcturus is a feve
A Voyage to Arcturus is a fever dream of exploration, metaphor, and metaphysics, but its dry voice is often its undoing, removing the reader too far from its universal aspirations.
Lindsay's voice is so distant and dry that not even his vibrant landscape can enliven itbut that landscape is vibrant, alien, and thought-provokingly strange, with a sprinkling of images that linger in the imagination.
I found A Voyage to Arcturus to be a long, slow, strange journey, but on the whole it's one I'm glad to have taken: cerebral to the point of dry, but still intriguing and wholly original, this may not be pleasure reading but it is worth picking up.
I have known for some time that this book was a big influence on C.S. Lewis's space trilogy and, now that I've read all of those, am finally getting around to this one.I can see the resemblances already but am intrigued by the story.
-----------FINALI am not actually finished but having read about a third of this book I feel I've gotten what I wanted from it.
I can definitely "feel" the influence on C.S. Lewis whose Space Trilogy I found difficult enough going although he did (thankfully) include interesting stories to go along with the imaginative worlds and new beings.
Really loved this for the first quarter of the book. Thought it was great- wicked weird- which is always good. Unfortunately, the well-written weirdness could not make up for the lack of action in the plot. The antiquated views, especially concerning women, really started to bug me. Eventually I got to the point where I couldn't be bothered with this story anymore. The only reason I gave it two stars was because it had some great ideas character/setting wise.
it was like the author took me on a date, we went back to his place, he asked my consent to have sex, I said okay, then he did a BUNCH of things I was uncomfortable with, but for some reason, I stayed quiet and just let him do it. Then I left, feeling dirty and ashamed and not knowing why or what I did wrong.
The protagonist, Maskull, travels to an alien planet and in each land he traverses, the landscape and people are different than the last.
The differences in each place even extend to the morals and philosophies of the people and Maskull often finds himself in agreement, even being driven to murder in lands where pity is rare and the strong prevail.
Yet through it all, he is driven to meet the god(?) Surtur and so walks on and on, finding different ways of looking at the universe but none of them quite right to his thinking.
Lindsay's novel like so many tales of fantasy and science fiction is a quest for the answers to life's mysteries.
Its use of space travel as a spiritual process highly influenced C.S. Lewis in his development of the Space Trilogy, and J.R.R. Tolkien read the work with "avidity" and clearly Frodo's struggle with the ring and his journey to "the darkest depths of Mordor" remains indebted to the trek across Tormance.While seminal the work is showing its age but retains its mystery.
While approaching one hundred years of age Lindsay's legacy still offers much for both the spiritual man and the jaded mandarin.
