I usually spend a good amount of time during these reviews going back and forth on why or why not the title we’re discussing is or isn’t Newbery worthy.
There’s no question that Shadow of a Bull is distinguished and award-worthy.
There’s plenty in there about fighting bulls too.
I still don’t feel like the fighting is really fair, though.
Several characters in the book say that the bull really wants to die this way, but I call bull crap.
But anyways this book isn’t about the ethics of bull fighting.
The narrator doesn’t take a stance.The ending even surprised me a little.
Beautiful ending.
"The town, suddenly, like a spring gushing from under a rock, flowed into song.
60)"They listened to the quarrels that erupted like brush fires and died as suddenly as they started." (p.
What I learned from the book is that I have an intense dislike for bullfighting.
It tortured me to read of the bulls being taunted, attacked by picadores and killed by the bullfighter after showcasing the his skills.
I resented the six men in black who prepared Manolo Olivar for his bullfight that was to be his coming-of-age ritual.Shadow of a Bull is a dark story.
Throughout the book the author glorified the artistry of bull fighting without addressing the downside."...when bullfighting began to develop in Spain, it was a pastime for the noblemen only.
If he lives after he enters the arena, it is for one of two reasons: either he has been too cowardly and, disgraced, will meet his death outside of the ring, or he has been so brave that both the bullfighter and the public wish to spare him to perpetuate that extraordinary bravery in his descendants.""Don't waste your pity on the bull.
Manolo Oliver is the son of the greatest matador in Spain, Juan Oliver, who was killed by a bull and is expected to someday follow in his fathers footsteps but there is one problem.
Manolo does not want to be a bullfighter and is afraid of bulls.
Unfortunately for Manolo at the age of 12 he has to fight his first bull.
In this book Manolo is expected to be just like his father and follow in his footsteps.
I really liked reading Shadow of a Bull because the reader got to see how Manolo built up his courage and fear to fight the bull.
BULLFIGHTING!is the setting of this book, but not the topic.
Wojciechowska is not concerned with debating ethics and animal cruelty; she is only interested in bullfighting as a backdrop to her story about a boy's decision on how to be brave and how to spend his life.That being said, this book is a wealth of information about the art and culture of bullfighting.
This book could just as easily have been written about skiing.The plot- a boy is told he should be a bullfighter, but he's not sure he wants to be- is hardly unique.
You have to know what you want in your life and do the best you can in order for you to fulfil your dreams and ambitions in life however knowing what you want is not easy you need to have a strong determination to be successful.
In order for you to be successful you have to give it a try to do something like Manolo did however he realized that being a bullfighter, even though he tried but it wasn’t his ambition in life.
Overall the story tells us to be who you are.
I would recommend this book to someone that was interested in heritage of spanish bullfighting.
It was very moving about a boy and his fathers death and the love they had.
A male audience young and old would like this book.
The title is appropriate but can be misleading in a way that you may think that the main character may be a bull.
I felt sorrow for the main character to find strength because he had to struggle between what he felt in his heart and what his family felt was right for him.
I read this book when I was younger and loved it.
The main point of the book was that there was a boy who was expected to follow in his father's footsteps as a bullfighter but he's afraid of bulls and doesn't want to fight them.
This book is a great way to show kids that they don't have to do what others expect of them to do and that they should always do what their heart tells them to do.
This book also gave a lot of Spanish culture which will introduce kids to other cultures which they may not be aware of.
There was a nice little story in here about bravery and learning to live the one's own life versus the one others expect, but the truth is, I'm never going to enjoy a book about bullfighting.
Only three discs long on audio book. So very, very good. It's recommended for 10 and older. I'm not sure if it is because it describes a bull fight and that might be considered too intense for younger readers/listeners or if because some of the subtleties of the story might be lost on younger kids. In either case, it is an excellent book, well deserving of the Newbery. I highly recommend this one.
Fantastic! This is another book about a boy who fears he is a great coward and rises above his fears. I think I loved this book even more that others in this genre because he didn't do what I expected and I think what he did do showed even more courage. "You cannot confuse bravery and courage with lack of fear. Real courage, true bravery, is doing things in spite of fear, knowing fear."
With the added glossary I never felt lost or confused and ended up learning a lot of how the practice of bullfighting works.The story focuses on a young boy who's father was a incredibly famous bullfighter in his town.
When Manolo was just 3, his father ended up dying leaving behind an incredible legacy that the town reminisced.
However, during a scene when she talks about Juan, she becomes very melancholy and upset with the whole sport so I didn't know if she truly supported the town making her son into her husband's shadow or if she forced herself to be proud because she thought this was what her son wanted.Overall a good quick read.
Andrew ZerbyForm I (Orange)Core Reading3-25-15 In Shadow of a Bull by Maia Wojciechowska, the author’s main message is that a person does not have to be what everyone else expects them to be. The reader comes to understand about human nature is that it is hard for a person to resist being what everybody expects them to be. This book take place in the small town of Arcangel(I dont know if it exists even though i looked on the internet) in Andalucia, Spain. The main character is Manolo Olivar, a b
The reader comes to understand about human nature is that it is hard for a person to resist being what everybody expects them to be.
The main character is Manolo Olivar, a boy who grows from 8 to eleven years old throughout the book, and the story is told in the perspective of third person limited focused on Manolo.
First of all, manolo’s mom is the one taking care of him, and is just mentioned throughout the book, as if the person taking care of the main character is not that important.
I really loathe bullfighting and only chose to read this book because it won the Newbery. I liked Manolo, but I didn't find great parts of the book very engaging. So much of the book was like a textbook on bullfighting. The parts that didn't deal directly with that were the only parts I liked.
Shadow Of A bull was a very interesting book. In the book it shows examples of honesty and other life principles. I recommend it to everyone
“The Birth of a Toreador” At the young age of 12 Manolo Olivar is battling his private demons; he Knows he is not brave—that he lacks the courage, skill and AFICION to face down bulls the way his famous, dead, father, Juan Olivar, did with bravado.
But his father’s famous destiny was prophesied at his birth by an old gypsy woman; the man, who died at 22, barely had time to be a husband and father.
Although Manolo resembles his father in build and features, he does not burn to die in the bullring.
How can Manolo avoid facing the bulls he dreads—without dishonoring his father’s name?
I liked this book because it was very entertaining and it was all about decisions and identity.For example, the town of Arcangel idolized and loved Manolo's father Juan Olivar.This is evident when townspeople are having a conversation and saying,"His was the longest nose in Spain.""Why shouldn't it have been?
I do not enjoy the Spanish language myself, but it introduced me to some words that brought rich words to my vocabulary, and could work for students who want to challenge themselves.
I enjoyed the book and I would give it a 3/5 stars only because I didn't really connect to the setting, culture, and language.***This is a good book for boys to read.******This is a good book for English Language Learners (Spanish as first language)******This is a good book for students wanting to challenge their vocabulary or wanting to learn some vocabulary of a different language.***
Bulls do not die prettily, and there is not need for young readers to know that reality.The characters are quietly strong, from Manolo, to his mother, to enthusiastic and sweet young Juan Garcia—who does have great passion, or aficion, for toreo—through the very believable and also quietly heroic doctor.I doubt that Shadow of a Bull would win the Newbery in the this century, but I am glad it did towards the end of the 20th.
It is their fervent hope that the boy in the story will grow up to be the next great bullfighter in the town.
I love that word, accessible - it means the book is very easy to read and understand.
A book that is easy to read and understand, but that has a terrific story full of feeling and interest, what could be better?!
It's like creating a beautiful and simple statue, so lovely and simple to look at and admire, but the sculptor hit LOTS of tennis balls before his stroke looked so smooth and easy, if you know what I'm saying.
Ever since, his village has looked forward to the day when Manolo can take his father's place in the bull ring.
A day for the bulls.
With the sun, a man has a shadow, the bull has substance.
And with no wind, there is no danger of the lure blowing against the bullfighter's body." 131-2"The fate of a brave animal should never be anything but a noble death after a noble fight.
A man is not like a fighting bull.
A man's life should not be all fighting, but also giving, loving.
A man's life is many things.
Real courage, true bravery is doing things in spite of fear, knowing fear." p.
The book Shadow of a Bull was good because you meet a kid from Spain named Manolo that is 13 or so, he also looks like his father at a very young age.
Also he has to fulfill he’s destiny to become a professional bullfighter like his father was.
So Manolo has to train but he’s too afraid to be a bullfighter.
After a while of training his friends think he’s improving and they think they should get Manolo a bull but without its horns trimmed.
When Manolo gets his first bull he does something that no one else did in the history of bullfighting.
I was not thrilled to read the explicit descriptions of what occurs in a bull fight.
Here is the central message of the book (and my favorite passage:"The fate of a brave animal should never be anything but a noble death after a noble fight.
A man is not likfe a fighting bull.
A man's life should not be all fighting, but also giving, loving.
A man's life is many things.
Real courage, true bravery is doing things in spite of fear, knowing fear...Be what you are, and if you do not yet know what you are, wait until you do.
I liked this story and felt that it really gave an excellent lesson in the bullfighting.
However, I only gave it two stars because I felt that it was not very well written for the intended age.
The book, though is written too simply and the themes are too safe and juvenile for an adult reader.
It was originally written in 1964, so the author could be forgiven for the narrow focus and dryness of the topic, but I don't think the modern young reader would have much interest in this book.
A group of bullfighting experts take him under their collective wing and start preparing him for his first match, to be held when he's twelve--just like his father.
The question is, does Manolo want to be like his father?
To the book's credit, it is not an easy question to answer.
Manolo struggles with the question, all the while as he is being pushed along to a future others have chosen for him.
It's a well written book that does a good job of expressing the thoughts and feelings of the characters and making the art of bullfighting come alive.
Shadow of a Bull by Maia Wojciechowska has always seemed to be one of the least popular Newbery Winners, and so I’ve not been in a rush to read it.
I enjoyed the book thoroughly, though, finding it to be a satisfying and meaningful story.
Shadow of a Bull is about Manolo.
Manolo, however, is not so sure that he has the bravery to fulfill what is supposed to be his destiny.The novel is well-told.
I also just really enjoyed Manolo’s development, as he struggles with questions of responsibility, identity, destiny, and bravery.
About what I would expect from a Newbery of this era: male protagonist from a European underclass, rich cultural descriptions with lots of history and landscape details, internal conflict, very little plot.
But I can't imagine expecting many readers to embrace it.
And while the bull was viewed sympathetically and the brutality of the sport was a central theme of the story, the morality of blood sport was never really questioned, just the protagonist's participation in it.
I read this partially to consider what to do with a languishing class set of this novel.
I can not imagine reading this with an entire class; there are many better options available.
In this book that really doesn't deserve a Newbery, a young man prepares to became a bullfighter like like famous but deceased father.
The book deals with Manolo's internal dialog about his conflicted feelings; how he is afraid of fighting bulls, disgusted by the thought of killing bulls, but even more afraid of disappointing the men who venerate his father and have been waiting for young Manolo to grow up and inherit his father's position.I'm pretty sure that the horrendous spectacle of bullfighting is a thing of the past.
Manolo's father is the most famed matador (bullfighter) in all of Spain.
He is not only afraid to face the powerful animals that are capable of killing a man, even one as brave as his father, the idea of having to kill the animals in the name of sport repels him.
Maia Wojciechowska's novel is one of fear and bravado, written in the sparse language of a Hemingway aficionado (and indeed Wojciechowska was friends with Hemingway in real life).
It is not a perfect novel, but it is an endearing one and it's flaws are few and far between.
A book about bullfighting seems like the last book I would want to read, but Shadow of a Bull is not just a book about bullfighting.
Shadow of a Bull is a rich book about the trials of being the son of a hero, a book about the struggles of a boy trying to find his own way in a world that is attempting to force him to take a path the boy does not want to take.
Manolo is the son of a magnificent bullfighter.
Manolo does not want to be a bullfighter.
