This is a typical Berdyaev hot little number if one can be so bold - a rave about history that manages to turn the subject inside out, so that what most people would ordinary consider to be "history" isn't, and that what "really" is history is what most people would scoff at if it was suggested. A fun read of a book by a great, inspired and sometimes too effusive mind.
View on the history which is opposite to Marxist dialectics. It don't need to be considered as negation but as supplement of it. The book is rich with many excellent metaphysic insights, and I think the core theme especially is confrontation between Hellenism, Judaism and Christianity. Of course, keep in mind there are some idealistic nonsenses which you need to take with a caution, but overall this book has greatly enriched my understanding of history because this is its only concept that can critically parry Marxism.
