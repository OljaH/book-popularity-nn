(The main character is usually the same spunky single woman, presumably the author loosely disguised.) The three "old" ladies (Tish and her two friends, the narrator and someone I think is named Aggie) probably aren't even that old.
The stories all start something like this: "The second time Tish set the house on fire, I couldn't have prevented her because I was busy making sandwiches for the gymnasts.
Well, we found out later they weren't really gymnasts, but that's another story." I made that up, but it's EXACTLY that kooky.
This was only the short story, not the book of shorts with the same name.
Old-fashioned stories. I liked them
I wanted to like this book more than I did.
I still find Tish a bit overbearing and know-it-all at times, but I think overall this was more amusing than others I've read
If Lucy Ricardo were a spinster geezerette, she would have been Tish. All of this author's Tish books are a delight. If laughter is the best medicine, Tish shoudl be in every doctor's bag.
