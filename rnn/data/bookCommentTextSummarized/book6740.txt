Folks, Great Tales of Terror and the Supernatural is essential reading for any horror, suspense, thriller, or mystery fan.
I could talk about the real shiners in this collection, but I'll instead rattle off some of the writers I encountered here for the first time back in my early twenties:Algernon BlackwoodM.R. JamesE.F. BensonOliver OnionsSakiArthur MachenJohn CollierWilkie CollinsAnd these are just the ones that were previously unfamiliar to me.
Add to that amazing list writers like Poe, Lovecraft, Hemingway, Faulkner...do I need to go on?
Great Tales of Terror and the Supernatural is one of the finest collections of all time.
That being said, the set up was interesting...the classic spend a night in a haunted house story and I always like a story in which multiple characters are driven to madness but come on Arlen...write what you know, buddy!A Rose for Emily by William Faulkner: Man, after reading a story like this, I have to take back some of the mean things I said about Faulker after reading "The Sound and The Fury." (Some of the things, but not all of the things.) This was a great tale that shows how one unfortunate effect of "Southern Hospitality" is that it may inadvertently allow something dark and horrible to exist just below the surface...something that isn't confronted until it is too late.
This anthology was my favorite book of all time from the age of 10 until the age of 12.
There are many favorite stories here that almost everyone has heard of and read: The Most Dangerous Game, Leiningen Versus the Ants, Shredni Vashtar, The Open Window, The Monkey's Paw..
Many here are still widely read because they were anthologized here first.
Even so I could not get over how many of them used the framing device of a bunch of white Englishmen at the club who are just lighting their cigars and settling down to hear one man's hair-raising yarn...or something very close to it.
I actually have an original, 1944 edition that was passed down to me by my father when I was just entering into my teens. Many of the great classic authors grace these pages, from Faulkner, Hemingway, Hawthorne, Dickens, and Forster to Poe, Wells, and Kipling, among many others. My only disappointment is that I can no longer read through the book without worrying that I will break the binding! Perhaps I should be looking for a newer copy...
I first read this book years ago, but I've since read through the majority of the stories several times each. A great collection--the old-time, atmospheric tales are my personal favorites!! A great book to have on your shelves. :)
F. Benson, and Algernon Blackwood are each represented twice) depict both naturalistic and supernatural themes; the two are separated into two distinct sections: 20 "Tales of [naturally-caused] Terror," and 32 "Tales of the Supernatural" [which are not necessarily terrifying in intent, though they usually are].
The plot arcs of the stories run the gamut from tragedies, through tales of evil punished, to happy endings; the tone is usually dark and serious, but a few are actually dryly humorous.Some of the naturalistic terrors are science-fictional in nature; murder and madness are of course staples, in many and varied permutations; and Carl Stephenson's "Leiningen Versus the Ants" is one of the greatest tales of the "man vs.
That's understandable as its a slick, whittled down murder story - not a mystery or even much of a crime story, like the Jacobs piece earlier it's more in the line of an ironic ending ALFRED HITCHCOCK PRESENTS episode - not a "whodunnit" but a "willhegetawaywithit?" Another slight but fun read.Moving into the "Supernatural" portion of the book, I'll always look forward to an unread Henry James ghost story as I consider "The Jolly Corner" an absolute masterpiece of his work in the area.
Some of the choices are rather inexplicable - ‚ÄúPollock and the Porroh Man‚Äù can be read either way, but is near the beginning of the book, while Saki‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Window‚Äù is explicitly not a supernatural story, but that‚Äôs where the editors put it.Almost entirely English/American with the exceptions of De Maupassant and Dinesen, I believe, and the gender balance is sadly tilted in the usual direction.La Grande Bret√™che ‚Ä¢ (1832) ‚Ä¢ Honor√© de BalzacThe one where a ‚Äúhaunted house‚Äù is created not by ghosts, but by the memory of some unpleasantries involving a cheating wife and her would-be lover being walled into a closet by the husband - very proto-Poe. Framed by a man staying in the town‚Äôs inn after the death, years later, of the wife in question.
The first half were stories of high suspense and the second half, scary tales involving the supernatural.Actually not all the stories were scary or suspenseful.
And of course it would not be a complete analogy without some Edgar Allen Poe.One of the most suspenseful stories is by Carl Stephenson titled, "Leiningen and the Ants", where a group of Europeans and Native South Americans try to stop a siege of local, giant killer ants.The section of the supernatural has a couple of stories by well-known writers of ghost stories, like M.R. James, Algernon Blackwood and F.
Review: Murderous spouses, ancient curses, talking corpses, seductive ghostsover a thousand pages long, presenting 52 stories from 33 authors, this collection is massive and dated, halfway a historical fragment and halfway a resource, fascinating but deep enough to drown in. It's so vast that it's almost impossible to review: no single opinion can reflect so many stories. There are a few classics here, just as many minor offerings from famous authors, and plenty of forgettable selections. Half t
There are also authors and stories which helped create the genre but are now forgotten, and pleasant surprises such as Benson's skin-crawling "Caterpillars." There's more emphasis on action than modern readers may expect, and a sprinkling of gallows humor.
There are too many duds to recommend it to a casual reader, and the selections are too arbitrary to make it the only classic horror anthology you own, but Great Tales is often fascinating and occasionally great fun.
To my surprise, the anthology is still in print¬óso if you stumble upon it, I well recommend you pick it up and read a few tales.
When wicked cousin would take away the ferret, too, Sredni Vashtar grants the victim his wish.Back for Christmas, John Collier4 üåüHow appropriate that the author is named Collier.
In this story, it is.The Beckoning Fair One, Oliver Onions3 üåüAn author is working on a second book, due in October, when he feels the urge to move residence to a flat in a house.
One day, he discovered an Omnibus route that travelled to Heaven.This story is a lesson to the people who will take themselves so seriously, caring only for how they can impress their fellow human beings, who look down on those who appear simple and uneducated to their"venerable" selves.
If you never read another horror anthology, if you even hate horror, you should read this one anthology just to make sure you round out your literary background. The one essential classic anthology that has NEVER been bettered since it was first published. Cannot really be compared to anything else.If you are a horror buff, then you owe it to yourself to read this to find out where it all came from and what the best can be.
Beautiful words, not very gory. It makes you realize the difference between schlock writers and true artists who can convey a mood with a few well chosen phrases. I loved it - one of the few books I won't lend out to friends. I can't afford to lose it! I've also ordered books by some of the best authors in the anthology.
Lots of good authors and great stories, but this book confirmed for me that Lovecraft is still the best when it comes to horror.
A fantastic (in multiple senses) collection of horror, both supernatural and psychological.
I like how this isn't all ghost stories, but has a good mix of different takes on horror, terror, the supernatural, and the mysterious.
It stretches from the early/mid-nineteenth century (Balzac, Poe, Hawthorne) to its original publication date (1944), and includes some essential stories by the likes of Algernon Blackwood ("Ancient Sorceries" and "Confession"), M.R. James ("Casting the Runes" and "Oh, Whistle, and I'll Come to You, My Lad"), Arthur Machen ("The Great God Pan"), H.P. Lovecraft ("The Rats in the Walls" and "The Dunwich Horror"), and dozens of others.
. there were probably dragons and vicious demons ‚Äì racial memories of an earlier age, with its bloody tyrannosaurus and its creatures still more ape-like than our own primitive ancestors.‚ÄùMy only real complaint with the book is that, for reasons best known to the Editors, the first 280 pages are devoted to Tales of Terror (in chronological order, by author birth date), and the remaining 800 pages are devoted to Tales of the Supernatural (again in chronological order, by author birth date).
While I admit that the Tales of Terror do not have any ghost stories, it seemed to me to be an artificial construct to divide the stories in such a way.Having said all that, this is a great collection, including such tales as ‚ÄúThe Facts in the Case of M.
This is a big book of old-timey stories about ghosts and other bizarre supernatural stuff, including a few classics like The Most Dangerous Game and The Monkey's Paw. Most of these stories are more strange than scary, but I found them all pretty fascinating. One that stands out in my memory: Lukundoo by Edward Lucas White. (Whoa! That story!)Giving this five stars because it's a great collection of all sorts of dark weirdness.
This anthology is the best among all the collections available in the market which claims about having most of the best ghost & horror stories inside their covers. Simply the list of contents would be enough to make lovers of ghost stories gasp in delight, and when you combine the contents with a very-very reasonable price, you have to run for it! Most highly recommended.
Thanks be to Google. I think I've identified this title as an anthology much-beloved in my childhood. This is old fashioned psychological horror, creepy and disturbing rather than gory. I loved The Great God Pan, Casting the Runes and Sredni Vashtar. Now to pay my respects to Amazon!
This is a fantastic collection of suspense/horror stories from the twentieth century. If you like horror and suspense, and you just don't have all day to sit around reading books, get this collection of tales.
Favorite stories:Oh, Whistle, and I'll Come To You, My LadThe Beckoning Fair OneWhat Was It?The HorlaThe Screaming SkullAfterwardThe Dunwich Horror
Has a good mix of short stories from the well recognized authors, and some that may surprise you.
A little silly, maybe, in their conclusions, but the sense of building atmosphere and menace in these two stories is unparalleled within this collection.W.W. Jacobs' 'The Monkey's Paw' - seems much older, like a folk story, or cautionary tale.
Either way, surprisingly chilling, in which getting what you ask for turns out to be worse than you could have imagined.Arthur Machen's 'The Great God Pan' - lengthy, the longest in the collection, but its mood is marvellous, distinct from the many urban settings of the other stories, strange and old and excellent.H.P. Lovecraft's 'The Rats in the Walls' - admittedly I'd read this one before, but it's still top-tier Lovecraft.
This book, an anthology of what are generally considered the all-time best short stories of the horror/supernatural genre, provided some of the most riveting reading of my childhood and adolescence.
I was a voracious reader tackling adult concepts with a hunger for new insights, and it wouldn't surprise me to learn that Great Tales of Terror and the Supernatural was the catalyst for considerable synaptogenesis during that period.
Now an adult perspective let me get resolution for this longstanding question in my mind."Sredni Vashtar" had me mulling the concept of youthful rebellion against oppressive authority, while trying to wrap my mind around the psychopathic behavior of a child the same age as me.Wonderful, stimulating, enriching, horrifying stories.
My taste for horror and supernatural stuff is episodic, a little of it goes a long way for me.
In that respect, this is a perfect volume -- a reader can dip into it for a taste, then put it aside for a bit, and then go back for more.
Nevertheless, try reading "The Monkey's Paw" again.
Try reading "Leiningen versus the Ants" again (sure, you read it in middle school -- it's a different feel for a grown-up).
For my taste, Lovecraft's "The Rats in the Walls" is the triumph of the genre.
I first read it 50 years ago.
Read it many times since.
Although there are some very good stories here, there are also some stories that are for various reasons virtually unreadable.
Had the following stories been excised, this anthology would have been good indeed:"Leiningen versus the Ants." A remarkably stupid story.
These include:"They." A most moving story; its perfection is a justification for the artistic existence of ghost stories."Sredni Vashtar." Delectably dry."Suspicion." Engagingly written and plotted."A Rose For Emily." A masterclass in how to structure a short story; perhaps the finest story collected here."The Horla." Truly frightening with a most memorable ending."Casting the Runes." A testament to the power of understatement."Caterpillars." Excellently developed suspense."The Celestial Omnibus." Beautifully written.Taken as a whole, this anthology demonstrates a strange mixture of masterpieces and mediocre dreck.
This is a terrific collection of short stories in the terror and supernatural genre.
You're reading stories from the advent of the genre.
Frankly, though, I had to come back to this collection in 3 sittings over the better course of a year.
I could only handle so much in the way of short stories.
But that didn't detract from the text.The only point of criticism to offer is that a lot of these stories come out much the same.
It can get a bit cumbersome.Still, there are some real gems in the collection, and I was re-introduced to some authors I had forgotten.
This is a great collection of classic stories that no horror aficionado should be without.
While the older stories in it were somewhat dated and didn't shock me as a modern reader, considering when they were written, they would have been ground-breaking.
To show the importance of this volume, this was also used as one of the texts in a class I took on the horror story.
As a writer, collections like these are important; you have to know where the shoulders of the giants are if you want to stand on them.
I love to read stories like these, and what's also really cool is that I've actually heard of some of these older authors.
And I am even seeing them in things that I see now, outside of the book.
I can't wait to finish this one.
Whoo!
I loved reading the short stories, though some I was genuinely confused on as to why they were in a book with such a title as this, but I absolutely enjoyed reading it.
Overall, it was such a great book to read, by many different writers who are all no longer with us.
What a fabulous book! I was surprised at how many of the tales I‚Äôve read, and I was excited to see my favorite short story--A Rose For Emily included in this collection. The most interesting thing about this copy was it was an original copy from 1944 and the flyleaf said ‚Äúthis is a wartime book‚Äù and though it was made with rationing in mind, the quality should not be affected. Thanks to my coworker for lending it to me!
