I read it solely for the language and it’s slick and altogether sexy. And that’s it. You don’t expect me to seek significance in a piece which is considered the first “DADA-novel”, do you? This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.
Second through Brain is both an interesting story and a dada manifesto/programme, as well as a linguistic experiment, an attempt at making language, together with the narrative, to “torque freakily high.” It is a text that forges its own peculiar idiom, lexically and morphologically, as well as grammatically and syntactically.
The text reminds us that only such aesthetic programme is revolutionary that seeks (to paraphrase Marx) not only to describe its own present condition and medium, but to change them.
This translation comes at the opportune moment of the 100th anniversary of the founding of dadaism in Zurich, reminding us of the strong cultural axis, in the 2os&3os, between Prague and the epicentres of Western European avant-garde.
Großartig! Wahrlich schnelldrehend, komplett bescheuert und am Schluß doch einen Sinn enthüllend, und dabei ein Hochvergnügen im konsequent respektlos-kreativen Umgang mit der Deutschen Sprache :D
Incredible that this has never been translated before. Hugely overlooked. It reminded me a lot of the Oulipo writers (Perec's "W" in shorthand).
