I have been happily re-reading the Trixie Belden series over the past few weeks.
Trixie Belden and the Marshland Mystery is the 10th book in the series.
The first six books of the Trixie Belden series were written by Julie Campbell.
So perhaps one author added the Dan character, but the next book was written by someone else....and they didn't like the character?
Or the books were written concurrently, and the two mentions of Dan added to the story at the beginning and end of the book were added for continuity.
:) There are 39 books in the Trixie Belden series, written from 1948-1986.
This falls into the category of "Trixie's imagination runs away with her, but she's not as far off as you'd think" stories.
I kind of liked Gaye, the violinist, because she was a spoiled brat and a really good liar...you'd think that would work against me liking her, but she made for an interesting challenge to Trixie and Honey's patience.
(hide spoiler)]--but the story made the ending satisfying.Not happy with the immediate downplaying of the significance of the bracelet Jim gives Trixie in The Happy Valley Mystery.
This another issue that has almost a gothic feel to it with burned out mansions, a 40-year mystery, a dangerous marsh, and and elderly lady who lives at the edge of the swamp.I really enjoy this book, and I love learning about the herbal lore that the Bobwhites learn about as they pick samples to replace a teacher's prized herbal collection.
A very enjoyable read.
In this one, people complain that there isn't really a mystery involved. I don't see why. Trixie can't always be solving a mystery 24/7 nonstop. And it wasn't like the book was bland, either. There was plenty of action and suspense to keep you satisfied. Favorite Kathryn Kenney book so far, four-and-a-half-stars out of five.
This is odd, of course, because they were MEANT for teen and pre-teen girls, but I was a young boy that read everything he could get his hands on and when I first stumbled on my first TRIXIE BELDON book I was instantly hooked!
Trixie is the star, or "lead" character, followed by Jim and Honey (who quickly became the love of my young life, I had a total crush on a fictional character that only existed in ink) and this brave trio was constantly getting into trouble, solving mysteries and murders; that sort of thing.
I lost all of my Trixie books years ago, lending them to friends and that sort of thing.
Trixie Belden is a 13-year-old girl detective, and this series is much in the same vein as Nancy Drew, only aimed at a slightly younger readership (which, of course, doesn't discourage me from reading them!) There were 39 books published between 1948 and 1986, and while they're all attributed to Kathryn Kenny, this is actually a pseudonym.
I read the first 9 last year and I'll try to read a couple more before the end of this year.The books are light and enjoyable reads, following the exploits of Trixie and her friends and siblings as they solve various mysteries.
He's supposedly friends with the Bobwhites.
Yeah, right.)The excuses that they give for why he's not there are worse.And I quote: "Dan Mangan wouldn't be able to do as much as the others, because his chores at Mr. Maypenny's kept him very busy from early morning till late at night, with only enough time off to attend school and study.
He was very happy living at the old farm, as Mr. Maypenny was giving his young assistant more and more responsibility, now that Dan had learned to like the life and had put the past behind him."Yeah.
Trixie and Honey decide to make an herbarium for their botany teacher and stay up all night with butterbrot and coffee...
oh wait, wrong series.Trixie and Honey venture to Martin's Marsh to gather some weeds for their elderly botany teacher.
There they meet Miss Rachel, last of the Martins, living in the old Martin Estate servants' quarters.
So then there's this whole tiresome issue of a mean reporter writing bad stuff about Miss Rachel and her tragic family background, Bobby is less annoying than Gaye, Gaye takes Bobby's turn at running away, minor peril, happy ending.
A childhood favorite re-visited.Is the story as good as I remember?
– Most of a day’s read.Characters?
– Memorable, several characters.Setting?
– Real world, pre - computer pre - air conditioning, pre - cell phone.Written approximately?
– approximately 1963.Does the story leave questions in the readers mind?
– Ready to read more.Any issues the author (or a more recent publisher) should cover?
Also, the absence of computers, cell phones, and air conditioning in homes, especially the mansion.Short storyline: Trixie Belden, Honey, Jim, and her brothers work to save Rachel Martin from losing her ancestral home to the highway and the bank.
Okay so the description of this book is misleading, the story has little to nothing to do with looking for gold.Honey's cousin Gaye a young violin prodigy is staying with the Wheelers with her Aunt Della while preparing for a concert.
Trixie and the Bobwhites work together to try and find a way to solve Mrs. Martin's problems and help little overworked Gaye.
Also Trixie and Honey are working on a project collecting herbs for their botany teacher.
However Trixie without a mystery to solve is kind of like peanut butter and no jelly sandwich.
Trixie Belden and the Marshland Mystery is book number ten in the Trixie Belden mystery series.
Trixie Belden and Honey Wheeler are best friends, horse lovers, and detectives who always seem to accidentally find a mystery waiting to be solved.
In this book, a famous child violinist, Gail, runs away to an acquaintance of the Belden family's abandoned barn and puts on the acquaintance's dead sister's clothes.
It is up to Trixie, Honey, and the Bob Whites of the Glen to find out where Gail is before Gail misses her upcoming big tour!I love the Trixie Belden Mystery Series because it combines two of my favorite things - - horses and mystery!
When a child prodigy and her mean old aunt come to stay with the Wheelers, you can guarantee a mystery will follow.
Trixie tells Honey about the legend of Captain Kidd's hidden pirate treasure, which is supposed to be buried near the Marsh.But when the child prodigy disappears, it's all hands on deck!Although this is not one of my favorites, it does have an interesting, but full, storyline.
For Christmas one year, my parents grabbed me the entire Trixie Belden set and I couldn't put them down.
After I finished with them, they continued to purchase them as quickly as I could read them.
Even with a learning disability, I devoured the books.
I look back now and I find that Trixie Belden was much more age related to young girls, particularly to me, reading the books than Nancy Drew.
There was something in these books that I found to be a greater escape than I did ND, too.
I found that they weren't so "over the top" or dated.
Reread this to my daughter.
I owned this book as a kid so I must have read it, but I remembered nothing of the plot and now I know why.
This one is a bit of a disappointment, redeemed from a 2 star by the middle section when a young girl goes missing and Trixie finds her.
The actual "marshland" mystery is barely a mystery at all and what could have been an exciting ending is condensed into a single paragraph of Trixie remembering something after the danger had passed.
Next up in Missing Heiress which I do remember certain scenes quite vividly.
The tenth book in the Trixie Belden series. Boy, for a small town they sure have some tragic family histories. Firs the Fraynes, then the old lady living in the cottage and her family and the burnt out mansion.I enjoyed the story that went with the BWG’s latest project, and thought the injection of the spoilt little girl added a different element to the dynamics.A fun read with nothing too much to complain about.
I have NO idea when I first read this book. It was not one of my favorites at the time and as I am reading it now, I do not remember much. Must be I didn't go back to it like so many of the others. :-)~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~RE-READ~12/5/2013
This is not one of my favorite Trixie Beldon books, but still has some good fun with the gang. Also some compassion for another, less fortunate ... always enjoy the rich/poor themes running through the books.September 2013 ... re-read ... good help for a senior citizen, but not really a mystery (though it is a more believable kind of mystery for young teen-agers).
A trip to the nearby marsh leads to a chance encounter with the old woman who lives there. Can Trixie and her friends help Miss Rachel? The characters are still wonderful, but I really struggle with this book because there is no real mystery.Read my full review at Carstairs Considers.
Book 10. Trixie's birthday was mentioned at the beginning of the book as being only a few weeks away and I spent the whole book excited as if I was going to attend her birthday party. The joke was on me when it ended on her birthday. (I wasn't bummed though).
Never one of my favorites in the series, but still a good one. The thing with this one is there's no real mystery. It says it's about Trixie seeking Captain Kidd's treasure, but she never believes that. A treasure is found but it was a small part of the story.
Trixie turns 14 at the end of the story. Miss Rachel Martin gives Trix an old 'brass' box, which turns out to be solid gold. The sale of which allows Miss Martin to move to town and open a rug and quilt shop.
Bland mystery in this one, though I love the spring setting and the fact that Trixie actually gets a birthday (her only one in the series). Hated the violin prodigy and her annoying poodle and found Bobby Belden's crush on her totally unbelievable.
(3.9)Trixie and Honey (and the rest of the gang towards the end of the book) help a young prodigy to experience a more normal life and help an old neighbor in trouble. I hate the prodigy's dog so dang much.Recommend 9/10+ for scary situations.
This book makes ME want to go to Lonely Marvin's Marsh.that sounds cool!
3 estrelas - grande leitura da minha pré-adolescência!
I loved this whole series my Mom passed them all down to me.
Another great read.....this will keep you on your toes!!!!!!!
Trixie Belden was one of my earliest great media obsessions. I absolutely adored all of the books and desperately wanted to be Trixie.
read when I was eleven through 13
one of my favorite ghost writer trixie books
