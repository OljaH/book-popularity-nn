There was a twist in the end that shifted the pattern a bit, so it was nice to be surprised and see that not everything was predictable.As for the romantic part of the story, Dana and Jordan had good chemistry and I enjoyed reading their scenes together.
- but I think NR did a good job showing why their first time together wasn't meant to be and how they needed to go their separate ways - Jordan being the one who had left - before getting back together for good.As it happened in Key of Light, there's a lot of talk about symbolism, coincidences and fate in this book too.
Anahtar serisi geç keşfettiğim, bulması biraz zahmetli ama okuması da bir o kadar keyifli bir seri.İkinci kitap Bilgeliğin Anahtarı’nda kütüphaneci olan kadın karakterimiz Dana, ilk anahtarın bulunmasından sonra görevi devralır ve ikinciyi aramaya başlar.
Tabi anahtarların bulunması ilk defa bir ciddiyete bürünebildiği için, laneti yapan büyücü Kane de bir o kadar cüretkar davranarak kadın karakterlerin önüne bir çok taş koyar.
Her ne kadar sonrasında aklı başına gelmiş olsa da daha da fazla sürünmeliydi bence.Kadın karakterlerimiz ve erkek karakterler çok yakın arkadaş oldukları ve önemli kişiler olmalarından dolayı kitapta sık sık göründüler.
Kızımız onu gittiği günden sonra bile seviyor, fazla karşı koyamamasına şaşmamalı.Yazar ufak ufak Zoe ve Brad çiftine de bir ön hazırlık yapmış.
This book is my absolute favorite in the Key Trilogy, La Nora does it again!What I enjoyed the most was the chemistry between Dana and Jordan.
It almost upstaged the thrill of reading about Dana's quest to find the second key.
Dana made a very good, real feeling, non-cliche heroine, and I loved reading how Jordan measured up to her character where many other men wouldn't be able to.
I also really enjoyed how this part of the saga flowed and continued from the first book, Key of Light.
Absolutely loved this book!
She still have resentment about the way he broke up with her and she'll try to ignore him but he doesn't make thing easy for her and maybe her heart wants a say in it.
I like seeing them grow and find their true fate and of course, Love ;p I adore the whole plot with the deities and the process for the hunt of the keys with a couple of clues and the friendship between the three heroines, but what make this series a favorite of mine is the chemistry between the MC.
In this second installment of Nora Robert's Key trilogy, librarian and book afficianado Dana Steele finds herslef tasked with the quest to find the second key, the key of knowledge.
Her journey takes her into the past, present, and future, as she struggles with the feelings she still harbors for writer Jordan Hawke.Not only is this my favorite book in this trilogy so far, but this may be my favorite Nora Roberts book so far as well!
I love this series and the mystical nature of the quest that the women are on.
And Dana is just an amazing character.
Between searching for the second key and starting up her business with Malory and Zoe, Dana just doesn't have time for Jordan any more, no matter how much she still loves him.Jordan knows what he lost all those years ago, and he has no intention of losing it again.
It's obvious that the plot has been ratcheted up a notch and the danger is a bit more pointed, both of which increase the pressure and intensity, but there's also more room given to the emotional development and relationship here that was very pleasing.I always enjoy a lead character who is an author, and Roberts did that particularly well with Jordan.
And the first one is already a great book.Dana Steele is one hard-assed woman, the kind of heroine I just love and adore.
And she love books.
He battles his own demon, having to come to term with his mother's death and wanting to make something/someone out of himself.
But he comes back, to amend the wrongs.
And to re-capture the heart of the only woman he ever loved.In her quest to find the key, Dana has to put her painful past with Jordan behind.
Together, they embar on the journey to find the second key to unlock the souls that had been confined for centuries.
Overall, I definitely enjoyed this novel as much as I expected to!We picked up right where we left off in book one - right after art gallery-owner Mallory has found the first key and unlocked the first of three glass boxes, holding the sleeping souls of three innocent demigoddesses.
Now it's librarian-turned-bookstore-owner Dana's turn to find the second key within a month, and where Mallory's mission led her to delve into the world of art and beauty, Dana's quest leads her inside the pages of the books she loves - diving into literature to unlock clues as to the key's secret whereabouts.
Canım Jordan😍
Read this trilogy back to back. This was even better than book 1!
Que boas gargalhadas dei a ler este livro.
keşke hiç bitmese dediğim serilerden biri<3
He is not a happy camper after the first key was found and you can bet the ladies are going to be getting the brunt of his irritation.The three women continue to bond through this book and we learn more and more about each of them (though not too much about the third, Zoe, otherwise there wouldn't be much of a 3rd installment.) Indulgence (the gallery, bookstore, salon) is coming along nicely as well!❖❀❖❈❖❀ THOUGHTS ❖❀❖❈❖❀By the second book Nora Roberts is really getting the story rolling, and the reader just can't wait to see what happens next.
Malory, Dana, and Zoe gather once more at the house of Warrior's Peak to see which one will be chosen to find the second Key (Malory found the first).
Dana is angry when she finds out that her once friend and lover, famous writer Jordan Hawke, was also invited.
Sometimes that's life, and although it hurts in that moment, we realize whatever happened, happened for a reason and it simply wasn't the time.
Maybe in a 3rd book, we'll also get to see how Simon, Zoe's son, looks at his mother's new life and friends.
There were only two things keeping me from DNF'ing this: 1) to fill a Romance Bingo square and 2) to find the mystery of the hidden key.
The main couple in this book is Dana and Jordan and they suck as a couple.
But he was a mystery/thriller novelist, so you get a crap ton of "insight" into how authors work/think about writing/think about readers, etc.
I hate this because I always read into this more as how the author of the book thinks/works.
Remember the days when Nora Roberts actually wrote GOOD fiction?This trilogy was, by far, her best.
I loved the banter among the boys, the good-natured ribbing that comes only from knowing people for years and having a shared history with them.
I loved the mystery of where the key would be in each book.
The Brides Quartet was also good, the boonsboro inn not so much, the dark witch trilogy repetitive and the stars thing was just...no.
She has not written anything of the caliber of this book in the last 8 years.
(Just like I was captured by Flynn's mouth in the first book, I was reeled in by Jordan's cool, aloof but haunting history) But as the story progressed, two factors came at me like wrecking balls.
Words so beautifully woven by Nora that I felt just like Dana -- the heroine fighting love but ironically fighting for it at the same time.And the Jordan developing did happen and it captured me to the extent that the vividness of the emotion I felt is seriously on rare occasion despite my sappy, lovesick, romantic self.
That just like Jordan's skill with creating a world Dana could grasp, the same was done to me thanks to Nora.
I like her books "okay" but I see a pattern that I've gotten a bit tired of reading.
Man is smitten with woman.
Man keeps pursuing.
Woman treats him like crud.
Man wants her even more.
Woman finally falls for man.
Oh, that was book #1.
This book-- Goddess, warrior, sorcerer, scorned woman being bitchy towards the man who broke her heart.
I'll think about reading the final book, to find out what happens.
third character is a woman who treats a man like crud.
Just an okay book, but not my favorite.
unfortunatly i figured it out before they did, but i still enjoyed it.
Perspective still jumps a lot throughout the book, but I feel as though the subplot (of Dana, Malory, and Zoe coming together to start their own three-in-one business) was more fluidly interwoven in the plot, and the climax of the book actually felt like a climactic point that was appropriate to the elements of the story.Additionally, I enjoyed the fact that unlike Flynn and Malory, who just had instant sexual attraction that more or less played jump-rope with being Insta-Love, Jordan and Dana had a history behind their relationship and a lot of past emotional issues between them to work out and overcome.
He forces a kiss on Zoe in this book to try to "make a point to her" and it's honestly kind of uncomfortable.
This was a re-read for book club. I think I last read this book back in high school, so it was interesting coming back and seeing it again. What really blew my mind is that I'm now older than the main characters, also the lack of cellphones. When I first read this it was totally normal that no one had phones, this time I kept thinking, just call his cell... oh yeah. Either way good re-read!
This book was a wonderful, unlike many others. The adventure the characters pursued is clearly well thought about and nicely timed in the book. I would recommend this book to everyone above 6th grade, but make sure to read the first one witch is Key of Light.
Nora Roberts with a sprinkling of fantasy thrown in for good measure. Good read while off sick.
I liked Dana from the first book, and we get to see the events that were hinted at in the prior book regarding her relationship with Jordan.
She has the biggest entrepreneurial journey to make of the three girls, so it was good to see her struggle through what it means to be a book lover trying to sell books (as opposed to working in a library where she need merely recommend or assist).As much as I liked Dana, however, I never really warmed much to Jordan.
While I can understand people letting grief lead to isolation on an intellectual level, it just doesn’t work for me emotionally.

Dana Steele had made two new friendships recently, became co-owners in business with these special ladies and resurrected an unwanted relationship with her former boyfriend, Jordan Hawke.
But that doesn't mean she has to like him.She had also been presented with the next phase of locating a special key for Rowena and Pitte.
They were interesting characters returning from KEY OF LIGHT but I didn't see enough of them.
And Dana?
He knew he made some mistakes and he had a very short time to earn Dana's trust.
Though I am not over-happy with this trilogy I will still read KEY OF VALOR, Zoe and Brad's story.
She didnt have the same stop and go feeling as the last heroine either which made it an easier read.
The plot was more well paced than the last with the action scenes distributed throughout rather than clustered at the end but i still wasn't sucked in like i am with most of her books.
i know we're trying to be all mysterious and poetic but in the end it just feels like a waste.
This one wasn't quite as left field as the first one but i still feel like its an unnecessary part of the story.
I liked Key of Knowledge better and maybe that's because Dana stuck on me from the very start, don't get me wrong I love Malory but I can relate to Dana's love of books and I admire her logical thinking and the fact that she has a mouth on her and isn't scared to put it to use when she's pissed!
His tactics will only result in his own undoing since they pretty much have the opposite effect than intended, other than scaring the living daylights out off the good guys.I'm moving on t Zoe next and her story should be even more interesting since she has that cute kid of hers, Simon, in tow and not forgetting a certain Bradly Vane.

It just sort of shuffle the story forward until the ending in the third book.
In the second book of the Keys it´s Danas time to find the key and herself.
I really like that in finding the keys the leading woman has to face her demons (not literary demons, but old,emotional junk they carry around).
And that the men not fall completely for the woman, they also has to face their demons.
This, the second book, are more interesting and the emotional stuff are deeper since Dana and Jordan have a history.
Now that Malory has discovered the first key (Key of Light, Book 1) Dana must take on the task of locating the second key to unlock the “Daughters of Glass”.
I enjoy the characters despite the fact that they and the action are a little predictable.
The first and second book could be interchangeable by switching character names.
Despite that, I am interested enough to continue on to Zoe’s quest in the third book of the trilogy.
Like sorbet between courses of a meal, these books are great for in-between the non-fiction I have on my TBR list.
