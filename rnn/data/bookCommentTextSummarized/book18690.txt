And the base emotion underlying it all that was getting harder and harder to ignore.Terror.The strengthening sense that something was very, very wrong. As with The Magicians, I have to confess I like the TV series Wayward Pines far better than the book. Yes, I know the "reveal" has been spoiled, but that really wasn't my problem with it. Pines is built on a fantastic idea - no, really, a truly epic idea - and that strength just about manages to carry the book despite some poor writing, an assho
As with The Magicians, I have to confess I like the TV series Wayward Pines far better than the book.
Special Agent Ethan Burke is involved in an accident on his way into Wayward Pines, Idaho - a place where two missing agents were last supposed to be.
The book is written in a very simplistic way, which may not seem like a terrible thing, but it is noticeably juvenile - I'm not usually someone to notice the writing unless it is very good or very bad, and this one I picked up on right away.As well as the writing issues and the whiteness, Ethan Burke is far less likable in Pines.

On the flip side, if you have a non-spoilery friend who claims they “knew what was coming the whole time,” you should kill unfriend them as well because they are full of crap.
Hands down the best suspense I’ve read this year and it gets ALL the stars.Copy provided by NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.
”Since the Industrial Revolution, we’ve treated our world like it was a hotel room and we were rock stars. But we aren’t rock stars. In the scheme of evolutionary forces, we are a weak, fragile species. Our genome is corruptible, and we so abused this planet that we ultimately corrupted that precious DNA blueprint that makes us human.” Ethan Burke was sent to Wayward Pines, Idaho, to find two missing secret service agents. One of them was his old partner and for a brief time his lover. Going aft
Burke escapes from the hospital, which was starting to feel more like a prison, and wanders around the town.
I mean what the hell is going on.”There is a big twist, and I am not going to talk about the BIG TWIST because some of you might want to read the book or watch the excellent TV series by M.
I watched the series before reading the book.
Normally, I will read the book before watching a TV adaptation or a movie, but in this case the series kind of snuck up on me.
4.5 - I need to next book ASAP.You know when you find a new TV series and you just want to binge watch it? This is how I feel about his books.I read Dark Matter last year and loved it so I was excited to read more of his work. This time was no different. Another thriller sci-fi that keeps you on adrenaline and that you can't put down. Trust me you want to go into this knowing nothing. Just read it.This didn't end up being what I expected but I really liked it and would recommend it!

There is no real way to review this book just go in blind and expect some mind blowing to happen.
Μετά το πρώτο βιβλίο και έχοντας ξεκινήσει το δεύτερο μπορώ να πω με κάθε ειλικρίνεια πως εκτίμησα περισσότερο τη απλή καθημερινή μου ρουτίνα.
Αγάπησα περισσότερο όλους τους συνανθρώπους μου σε κάθε γωνία του πλανήτη.
Είμαι ιδιαίτερα ευτυχής που μπορώ ακόμα να ονειρεύομαι και να μοιράζομαι τα πάντα με όλους τους αγαπημένους μου.
Μίσησα βαθιά κάθε μορφή προστασίας που κλείνει σε καλούπια την ανθρώπινη δημιουργία σε κάθε επίπεδο.
Την μουσική τη ζωγραφική και κάθε μορφή τέχνης που εκφράζεται και μεγαλουργεί μέσα στην απόλυτη ελευθερία τον ανοιχτό διάλογο την κριτική σκέψη την ψυχική επαφή και την ανθρώπινη επικοινωνία.
Μετά από αυτό το βιβλίο μου δημιουργεί τρόμο κάθε μορφή αναστολής.
I mention this as a personal bias, because Blake Crouch's 'Pines' reminds me, above all things, of a Dean Koontz novel.
This being the case, I'd hope to find a lot more interior dialogue than Crouch offers; thoughts and investigatory theories formed and discarded by the protagonist (a trained Secret Service agent) rather than descriptions of him running down an alley or up a staircase, reporting only what he sees and seldom what he thinks.In an afterward, the author credits David Lynch's 'Twin Peaks' as a source of inspiration for the novel and, reading the sales description, I was put in mind of both 'Twin Peaks' and 'The X-Files'.
Author Blake Crouch has done an excellent job of putting together a suspenseful thriller that is at its finest when, in Sixth Sense fashion, the reader can experience his presentation untethered with pre-knowledge.
I don’t watch TV, so I haven’t seen anything about the television series and had only read a few of my GR friends reviews and the theme of all of them is what I impart now, don’t even read the back cover, just start reading and Crouch will do the rest.Drawing inspiration from such writers as Ira Levin, Stephen King, Richard Matheson, Philip K.
Dick, Shirley Jackson and Octavia Butler author Blake Crouch has crafted a gem of a thriller with horror, science fiction and fantasy elements.
At the risk of alienating all of my most excellent friends who've loved this book, I'm going to be honest and say that while there were things that I liked about it...
waking up with no memory thing and the M/C having a migraine as described by someone who's never actually experienced one, and the uber-nice Nurse Pam - but after a bit, it started to pick up.
I know a lot of people will disagree with me on this, but don't worry, I shall elaborate and explain why I feel like that.
Secret Service agent Ethan Burke wakes up in the mountain town of Wayward Pines, his memory full of holes aside from that of a horrific car wreck that landed him in the hospital.
Why can't he contact anyone outside of Wayward Pines over the phone?
Ethan Burke wakes up in the idyllic paradise of Wayward Pines and things quickly go pear-shaped.
Just what is Wayward Pines and why does everyone seem to want Ethan Burke dead?
I'm really curious how the sequels will play out.Pines is a rip-roaring thriller, full of twists and turns.
There’s the part of me that loved the mystery of the first half and then there’s the part of me that didn’t like the whole idea behind the book.
We're given little snippets of his past and the life he shared with his wife, but it wasn't enough for me to connect with him on a deeper level.A secret service agent, Ethan's latest assignment has landed him in the small town of Wayward Pines, Idaho.
Some things didn’t make sense and others were a little too bizarre for my liking.Am I curious enough to pick up book two?
And, for the most part, I will never know how far off I actually am.When I started this book, the idea that came to mind is that maybe the author woke up somewhere after a heavy night of drinking, not knowing where he is, with a pounding headache and unable to recall anything.Hey, if you've never found yourself in that scenario, I need to say two things:Congratulations...and fuck you for judging me - it only happened once, and, surprisingly, I managed to learn my lesson.Okay, the author left a note at the end of the book, and I was way, way off.
This book.It's written.In fragments.The writing style really got on my nerves. While it was kind of a page turner, the final reveal was really far-fetched and disappointing, which left me feeling ambivalent about the whole thing. I also felt the supporting characters needed to be fleshed out. Overall - meh.
MAY 1, 2016 - Bumping this because the entire trilogy is on the Kindle Daily Deal for $1.99 each.
It's also on Kindle Unlimited.
Go read it.
Now.This book is amazing.
The only thing is, I wish (view spoiler)[ Beverley hadn't died.
:(  (hide spoiler)]Now I have to watch the TV show.
I can totally picture him as Ethan.
I can't WAIT to find out what happens next!!!Original Post:This book is amazing!
One of the best thrillers I've ever read.

Rating: 4.5* of fiveI hate, loathe, detest reviewing Kindle books.
It's clunky.
How should I know which bookmarked passage is mine?
I have to look all over the damned place and usually end up annoyed so I can't quote the good bits.That's why I've never reviewed my Goodreads friend Blake Crouch's eerie thriller Pines.
It's set in Idaho, which is scary enough for me right there with all the right-wingers and Mormons (hi Pat, sending smooches, please don't shoot me), in an imaginary town called Wayward Pines *cough*Coueur d'Alene*cough*.
It's a $2 Kindle purchase today.It's worth twice that and more.
I'm shook. I've never read a book faster than I've read Pines. Holy moly! To say that it will keep you glued to the page is an understatement.*This is only the second book by Blake Crouch that I've read, but he just hit my Favourite-Authors list.*Absolutely amazing.
Review written September 24, 2015.I hate when this happens.It's absolute hell when there's a book everyone loves and yet you end up hating it. I seriously hate it. Some might think "ooh, but it's fun being the black sheep!" but I tell you: It is not.Disliking books is not a comfortable feel. It's as if there's a big party, everyone's invited and when you get there, you figure out no one wants you there. That's how I feel after reading this book. Because I wanted to be crazy about it. Because I
My issues were the usual ones, and while I was not liking it, I wasn't feeling hatred of the passionate kind.The first thing that started to annoy me was something that got me from page one.
I'm not sure if I will watch the show, but one thing I am certain: I will not be reading the next books.Now, please, please, please, if you disagree with my review, don't go self-righteous mode because you're not going to change my opinion.
I did not like this book and nothing you say will make me question neither my rating nor my decision.["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>

YESTERDAY IS HISTORY.TOMORROW IS A MYSTERY.TODAY IS A GIFT.THAT’S WHY IT’S CALLED THE PRESENT.WORK HARD, BE HAPPY, AND ENJOY YOURLIFE IN WAYWARD PINES!
This story blew me away and that is quite a significant statement when you consider that I had already watched the TV series.Secret Service Agent, Ethan Burke was sent to Wayward Pines, Idaho to locate and recover two federal agents who have been missing for a month.
The big reveals as you start turning into the home lap are masterfully handled, effectively closing out this chapter of the story and leaving you nail biting, anxious to start the next book in the trilogy.
The male lead (let's call him "he") wakes up in an unknown town, badly bruised, penniless, and without any memories of his life.
When it comes to thrillers, I've drawn this conclusion : more the author keeps us in the dark, characters wise, more my interest is piqued, because the lack of knowledge adds tension to the story and you know what?
He isn't a likeable character, not flawless by any means, but I cared for his quest of answers, even more because the layers of his life aren't immediately unraveled.
It's the same price for each book in the trilogy.One road in No road out...I've just finished reading this crazy book - and I'm totally bewildered.
As with most books, at some point in the story I assume I know which direction it's taking; sometimes I'm right (lucky guess), other times I'm way off the mark - and I couldn't have been further from the bullseye with this one.
As others have stated - it's best to go into this one blind - don't even bother to read past the premise, skip it if you can.
In the pines, in the pinesWhere the sun don't ever shineI would shiver the whole night through. -  Leadbelly In case you're planning to read Pines for yourself: the less you know about this book, the better. Therefore I intend to keep this review spoiler free, but I can't guarantee that certain judgements I make won't foreshadow events in the book. It is entirely safe to proceed reading through this first paragraph in case you need your fix of my reviews, but there won't be much to see except fo
It is entirely safe to proceed reading through this first paragraph in case you need your fix of my reviews, but there won't be much to see except for something you probably already guessed given my warning: the biggest strength of this story is its supremely intriguing mystery.
At least that's what I've come to expect from these kinds of mysteries: no matter how wild and crazy the tentacles of the plot writhe about, I expect them to be wrapped up neatly into a nice little box by the end of the story in a fulfilling way.Sadly, shows like Lost lost most of their allure through uncovering their mystery.
That doesn't mean that the book was in any way bad, it was a page-turner with a fantastic story and I read the book during a day and I loved all the twist and the ending that explained it all.
This is the kind of book that you should read without much knowledge so I fully understand and I'm grateful for all the reviews that I have read that stated that they will not spoiler the book.So, read this book, it's a truly remarkable book with a fascinating story and a very, very good ending that leave you with the craving for more.For me, it wasn't a wow book, but still truly entertaining and I'm looking forward to reading the next two books in the series and see the TV-series.
No dream without the nightmare.This story is something I like to call 'How many times can you gasp loudly say WTF?!
while reading a book?'And the answer would be: many, many times.I'm not going to say much, because I feel like this is one of those books that you should go into knowing as little as possible.
Every single time I thought I knew something, I felt like somebody pulled the rug from under my feet and I fell flat on my butt.
Can't wait to see where the story will go, because I literally have no clue.
My Rating: 4.4/5
Pretty good start to the series. I am excited to see where the next one takes the story. I was very much reminded of the tv show Lost (and the author even mentions that as an influence). The twists and turns, the mysteries and revelations have so far given me one heck of a mind blowing experience.
Grateful this one didn't end with a terrible cliffhanger. I love how there was some amount of closure but it kept me wanting to pick up the next one soon.
"Where'd you live before Wayward Pines?""I've always lived here.""You've never left this town?" Ethan asked."You can't leave," the boy said."Why?""You just can't.""I don't accept that.""That's why you're going to die."   Not too long ago, it feels like yesterday, really, I saw a television commercial for a show called Wayward Pines. It was utterly compelling and drew me in every time the commercial aired. I never got around to watching it, I never really catch TV shows unless they're re-runs o
"Where'd you live before Wayward Pines?""I've always lived here.""You've never left this town?" Ethan asked."You can't leave," the boy said."Why?""You just can't.""I don't accept that.""That's why you're going to die."
"Thanks for your help, and your concern," he said, pressing G three times until the button illuminated, "but I think I got it figured out.""What?""It's this town that's wrong."
Okay, okay, if it's a severe love triangle or I think a main character may be in danger of dying, I might do a little reconnaissance to see how it happens, who they end up with, or what the situation might be.
★★★☆☆I’m sad to admit that I watch way too much TV. My addiction is so out of control that I even try to keep abreast of all the exciting new shows coming down the pike—pathetic, I know. Last year I saw an intriguing trailer for an upcoming show on Fox called Wayward Pines. After watching, I filed it away in the old steel trap, and didn’t think too much more about it. Then a few months ago reviews for a book called Pines started popping up all over my feed. The story seemed vaguely familiar some
That’s when it all came flooding back.Attempting to review this book without spoilers is a bit tricky, but I’ll give it a shot.
As a long time student of Sherlock Holmes, I’ve always utilized this piece of sage advice when tackling any new mystery, “Once you eliminate the impossible, whatever remains, no matter how improbable, must be the truth.” Well Mr. Holmes, that’s all fine and dandy when dealing with one of your little adventures, or maybe even some real life mysteries, but the problem with applying that logic to a story like this is that it’s hard to know what’s impossible.
www.melissa413readsalot.blogspot.comOk, wow!
This book just blew me away.
It kept me guessing all the way through to the end game!
Until the next book that is :)I felt like I was on a crazy train ride!
This book is so awesome!
It's creepy and could really happen some day, it could be happening now.
This book had me on the edge of my seat the entire time.
I can say if you want to read a book that is full of crazy and what the..
moments, then you need to read this book.
A fun read, though not brilliant in terms of the final revelation; it more or less ties things up but there seem to be more than a few inexplicable plot points.
He ran, jumped, climbed things, jumped some more, chimneyed, jumped and ran, did some more running and all with massive bruising, blistered feet, a duct-taped together thigh, various head injuries and a killer headache.Suspend your disbelief and ignore the writing style, and there's the fun read I mentioned.
