1–DISAPPOINTING–Stars You know there's a problem when the cheating aspect is the least of my issues.
I was probably one of the few among my GR tribe who liked Beautiful Redemption and had no problem with Thomas being hung up, at first, on the previous heroine of this series. So I had to give this a chance. Now, this book runs parallel to Beautiful Redemption and unlike BR, the second half of this book was a clusterfuck. Cheesy, predictable and boring. (view spoiler)[Taylor cheated on Falyn. The cheating wasn't shown in the book but if you've read BR, you'd see it happen in the moment. (hide spo
(view spoiler)[Taylor cheated on Falyn.
(hide spoiler)]Now I had no problem with (view spoiler)[cheating (hide spoiler)] per se.
The (view spoiler)[one-night stand got pregnant.
And Falyn, as revealed in the chapters prior to it couldn't get pregnant anymore.
The (view spoiler)[OW had to give the baby to Taylor and Falyn to raise because, you know, she can't deal.
After they got the (view spoiler)[baby, Falyn also got pregnant.
(hide spoiler)] Hurray for Taylor's magic peen.
Unnecessary and predictable.I'm not even going to touch on how unlikable Falyn and how weak Taylor is because I don't see the point.
1 Hesitant Star.  So basically this is the story of another of the Maddox brothers. He meets Falyn, a girl with his own past and problems, and they slowly fall for each other. But as their ghosts and problems keeps getting in the way, they will realize their relationship will not be a walk in the park. This is a review that really pains me to write. Mainly because Jamie is the author of one the books I believe to be one of the pillars of NA, “Beautiful Disaster”, as that book is also one of my
The quality of Jamie’s books seems to be decreasing with each one in this series, and unfortunately, I believe this means the end to me.
For me, the (view spoiler)[ cheating  (hide spoiler)] wasn’t the biggest problem.
I’ve read books where that happens and I’ve rated them 4 and 5 stars.
I just don’t understand the meaning for that, except for the adding of unnecessary drama and it was so badly developed it was painful to read.
(hide spoiler)]Love Triangle:  (view spoiler)[ No.
(hide spoiler)]Cheating:  (view spoiler)[ Yes.
(hide spoiler)]HEA: 	(view spoiler)[ Yes.
JAMIE HOW FUCKING COULD YOU I am seriously heartbroken . Probably because I went in with high expectations. I mean it's the Maddox brothers, & they're addicting okay? But I was left completely disappointed.Basically my single biggest pet peeve when it comes to stories was in this book (to some degree). I really am spoiling the plot if I say anything about it, but if you really wanna know it's that there was (view spoiler)[cheating, sort of (hide spoiler)]. The story started off pretty good.
But I was left completely disappointed.Basically my single biggest pet peeve when it comes to stories was in this book (to some degree).
Falyn doesn't have time for distractions from her ultimate goal, so she rejects him.
Falyn is pretty unfazed until she realizes he may be able to help her reach her goal with a little manipulation and so begins the start of them.
Then came the unnecessary, weird insecurities that cause drama and fights, blah, whatever I didn't even mind that stuff honestly.
;) My swoonfest continues over Taylor Maddox, and just for extra yumminess, he is a hotshot firefighter, and loves to save damsels in distress in his free timeThe lucky damsel he completely falls for is Falyn.
Falyn wants nothing to do with him, but ...
she discovers he is her meal ticket to unveiling a secret, no matter how much it is going to hurt.Taylor’s usual calling card reads ‘one night stands only,’ but Falyn has unexpectedly managed to get underneath his gorgeously tatted skin.BUT Taylor is all too human and makes a big, I’m talking BIG mistake!
Liked first part, hated second one. 4 stars/0 stars
I paid $14 (I had bought the paperback) for this so I'm going to be more honest, and perhaps, frank in the review.I this book!!What the hell?!Some of what went down in this book really ruined it for me.Taylor is a douche.What he did was unacceptable.Falyn was annoying.Some of the other characters in this book...did they really even have a purpose?I swear, the Maddox brothers' stories are getting much worse.
I wasted my time and money that I can never get back.
“My jeans don’t know your jean well enough to be washed together.”  I have to say I don't know what's happening with these stories. When I first read "Beautiful Disaster" I loved the story. I adored Abby and Travis. And I was curious about the Maddox Brothers. Now that I'm getting the chance to meet them one by one nothing out of the extraordinary is happening.

The whole "Beautiful Sacrifice"?
AND I got to meet Tyler Maddox!
Read 8/22/2015 Edited 2/22/2016
Sure she was hurt, but then she just got over it and decided to (view spoiler)[play family with Taylor and the child he had with the woman he cheated on Falyn with (hide spoiler)].
Personally I could've never forgiven something like that.I got over the (view spoiler)[cheating (hide spoiler)] part since Taylor would've never done it if he'd known that Falyn hadn't broken up with him.
She wanted Taylor to take some time and figure out whether he would really be okay with never having kids, and his solution is to go out of town, get drunk and fuck another woman with no condom, getting her pregnant.
If this doesn't justify the need for a "fuck-to-the-no" shelf, I don't know what does..."Because it's sounds just as painful as this:
But the more vexing thing is that this devolved into a drama that was so over the top that I shook my head and said "Yeah, even if Jamie McGuire ends up writing five more books in this series or even a new one entirely, I'm not going to follow her as an author even if she co-writes with an author I actually do like." Reason being, the quality of the book isn't there for the price tag or for the time taken for the read.First, there's cases of awkward writing that are more frequent than not:"Before I had time to stop my expression, I narrowed my eyes and sneered.""His lips baptized my skin in a line of tiny kisses..."Then there are contradictions in the text, such as Taylor saying he has a master's degree in Women's Studies bud didn't go to graduate school.
4.5 Sacrifice ★'s “I don't need you to save me.
I just need a little help to save myself.”This is my favorite so far in The Maddox Brothes series!
I really love Taylor Maddox so damn much.
Though he really doesn't take shit from anyone, that's the Maddox way!!
Taylor was so swoony and I fell for him right away, plus he's a hotshot firefighter and I LOVE firefighters 😉.
Falyn story was so beautiful and Taylor stole my heart!
Beautiful Sacrifice was the best one yet and it broke my heart so many times 😭😭.
That qualifies as need.”“I want you.
I completely and utterly done with this author. My stomach hurts and I didn't even read it!!!
DNF *No Rating*I'm just not feeling this book anymore. The heroine is too bitchy, secretive, and deceptive for my personal taste. And now that I've read some spoilers, I know that there are some actions by the hero that will not sit well with me later on so I'm cutting my losses. I don't want to waste my time on something that will end up angering or frustrating me, just don't have it in me to continue.
Then when the girl shows up pregnant it all just fell too perfectly into place, the fact that she did not want the child and Falyn and Taylor could keep it for themselves.Hey Falyn!!
Total turn off and made it very hard to like him after that no matter how much he apologized and claimed he loved her or that he could not imagine life without her.I know Travis slept with 2 girls while Abbie was staying with him but even that did not bother me because they were not together, plus even drunk Travis remembers to use a condom!!!
Okay, so when the reviews started coming in, I was a little hesitant to read this book, however, my curiosity won me over and I'm glad I did.
That doesn't mean everything is peachy with this couple...they are a little different and if you've kept up with the series, you know what Taylor did in Beautiful Redemption.
And Falyn makes that only too clear to Taylor.
And of course, I loved all the time with the Maddox family.
We do get some page time for Tyler (Taylor's twin) and Ellison who will be featured in the next book.
I wish I could give a book zero stars.
I get that these books aren't great literature by any means.
Yet I have enjoyed them up until these past two books.
It really feels as if McGuire isn't in this for the story anymore, but to see how many books she can pump out.
All of them are the same, have the same dialogue, and are rushed with nothing to really grab hold of your attention.Thank god there is only one Maddox brother after this, because I can't continue on with these horrible books anymore.
I thought this one was going to be good, after the way it started.
Honestly, Travis and Abby were the only good thing about this entire series.
Taylor, started out as an amazing motherfucker and ended up being the worst kind of scum the world has to offer.
I sort of understand where Falyn is coming from - again, what the fuck is up with these ridiculous names?
There is nothing beautiful about this shit.I thought this book would be a nice change from the rest of the series, but I honestly fucking hate it now.
I love the Maddox brothers and Jamie McGuire's writing style and I also loved this book. Because of my issues with cheating I had to deduct half a star from my rating so that's why this novel got only  4 and a half stars  from me but I loved it nonetheless :DHaving a little insight into the characters from reading the other novels in this series I wasn't as shocked by what happened and I have to confess that the plot was a little predictable. But the characters pulled their weight throughout thi
But the characters pulled their weight throughout this book and made this novel a great one :DFalyn left her privileged life for the chance to live like she wants so she goes from Ivy league student to waitress...but caries after her a painful secret.
Being hot, charming and a walking wet dream isn't making things easier :PI didn't like the cheating part and I felt that the novel could have been good even without that but what's done it's done and I liked it even despite that.Can't wait for the next Maddox brother to get hit in the head by Cupid and fall fast and hard :P
REVIEW TO COME4.5 Stars!(BR with Sharon)
WHAT. THE. HELL WAS THAT?!Like ????!!! @#$%^%$#@#$%^%$#!!!!!!No. NO. NO. I can't even say what I really think about this book because it'll be just one big fat spoiler.(view spoiler)[Look Jamie, if you're going to give your main character endometriosis and make getting pregnant supposedly hard for her, but then you will anyway give her the miracle of having a baby in the epilogue, don't you think getting Taylor to cheat and have a baby with another woman for Falyn to freaking raise was a taaaadd

I have ecstatically followed the Maddox brothers series from day one, but for some reason the twins have never quite broken away from the periphery.
Jamie McGuire always manages to prove me wrong in all the best ways.
By doing that, Jamie McGuire is able to enrich a story that has already been published.
Taylor definitely broke away from the periphery and became a solid main character, but most importantly, a solid hero.
Beautiful Sacrifice has me impatiently anticipating Tyler's story, but at the same time I'm a little scared to let these brothers go.
cheater:==>livro anterior (beautiful redemption) "Thomas smirked.
“He got dumped.”The feeling of victory vanished, and guilt jarred me into silence.
That didn’t last long when I remembered the yelping and wall-banging.
“So, you slept with—” I almost slipped and said Agent Davies.
“I’m sorry.
It’s none of my business.”Thomas couldn’t hide his relief.Taylor took a long deep breath and blew it out.
Falyn and I worked it out, and she’ll be in St. Thomas, so I’d appreciate it if…you know…”“Falyn is your girlfriend?” I asked." <==--- nada demais, já li muito livrinho de banca com história muito melhor!
I just need a little help to save myself.Here we have Taylor Maddox, one of the twins in the Maddox family.
Taylor comes into the diner for lunch with his coworkers and the rest is history.My jeans don’t know your jean well enough to be washed together.I really wasn't super surprised with what happened.
It was weird and awkward, but wasn't a deal breaker for me because I have come to expect things like that from the series.
I liked Taylor and I liked Falyn.
However, I feel like Jim needs a cute little novella to end the series right.
2.5~3 StarsI am having a difficult time with this review and rating because I'm not entirely sure where I'm at.
I have enjoyed the books in this series, but this book was not easy, and if I'm truly honest, it was very frustrating.
I certainly do not want to reveal too much and spoil it for anyone else, but shit happens that I am just not a fan of that is just hard to move past.
All in all, I am a Maddox brother fan and want to know Tyler's story and see how it all ends, but I think I will watch the reviews before I dive in!!
Me encantaba como Falyn no daba una mierda por Taylor y él solo seguía insistiendo porque ella lo rechazaba cada vez, pero ella sabía que eso pasaba y por eso le daba en las pelotas a Taylor.Pero como en toda historia Maddox tiene que salir Travis con sus problemas y pasa a ser el centro de atención en el libro.
Jamie, déjalo ir, ya hiciste cuatro libros de él (si no es que más), suficiente de su relación jodida por toda una vida, gracias.Pues no sé, si te gustan los hermanos Maddox con sus relaciones jodidas y problemas psicológicos te va gustar éste libro.

Beautiful Sacrifice es el tercer libro de la serie Maddox Brothers de Jamie Mcguire y narra la historia de Taylor ( uno de los gemelos ) y Falyn.Han pasado varias horas desde que termine de leer este libro y aun sigo sorprendida por la puntuacion que le puse a la historia de Taylor, nunca pense que su historia solo mereciera tres estrellas pero sintiendolo mucho, Beautiful Sacrifice no alcanzo a ser tan bueno como esperaba ni tampoco cumplio las altas expectativas que tenia.Desde mi punto de vista empezo siendo una muy buena lectura : rapida, ligera, divertida...
*silently growls* This book was frustrating.
I do not like frustrating books.
This is Taylor Maddox's story, and he falls in love with Falyn Fairchild.
For most of the book I was invested in their story.
They knew each other's souls, and books like that just get me.
Then, this whole unbelievable forest fire happens, Falyn freaks out and thinks that Taylor is dead, and then she forgives him so easily?
Maybe I'm a bit of a cynic when it comes to certain things, but cheating.
Anyway, regardless of my frustrations I am still pretty invested in the Maddox boys' lives and I'm looking forward to the next book.
When I read about it in the previous book, I wasn't happy, but reading about the circumstances of the so-called "break-up", I just really wasn't rooting for the relationship.
One thing I cannot stand in romance novels is cheating, it is pretty much my only complete turn-off, and unless there are mitigating and justifiable circumstances, and these I must believe whole-heartedly, the characters and the relationship are no longer enjoyable as soon as it happens.
Plus I spent the whole book waiting for it to happen, which was not wholly enjoyable!
