Rating: 4* of fiveThe Book Description: Virginia Euwer Wolff's groundbreaking novel, written in free verse, tells the story of fourteen-year-old LaVaughn, who is determined to go to college--she just needs the money to get there.
When she answers a babysitting ad, LaVaughn meets Jolly, a seventeen-year-old single mother with two kids by different fathers.
This is a YA novel written in a teenaged girl's voice in free verse.
As a rule, a safe bet.Rule, meet exception.I love LaVaughn and Jolly and their weird, codependent growing up.
It's totally unnecessary to tell this story in any kind of verse, but whatever.
It's a novel told in a free verse style, and I wondered if that would bother me.
I soon realized, though, that the verse style made the story more powerful.
I loved it!Make Lemonade is the story of 14-year-old LaVaughn who befriends Jolly, 17-year-old mother of two, when she answers Jolly's ad for a babysitter.
We see her change and develop as she comes to love and care for not just Jolly's children, but Jolly herself.
The relationships she builds gives her new perspective and understanding into the world outside herself.The story was beautifully told, and I'm eager to read the next book.
This is one of the best YA books I have ever read!!! It tells the story of a young girl in the poorer neighborhoods in NYC who answers an ad to babysit for two young children. The mother is only 17. The characters in this book are courageous and well developed. It is an amazing read and should be on the reading list of every middle school in the world!!
Wow. This book has been sitting on the bookshelf in my classroom for 8 years, but I only now had the pleasure of reading it. I loved it. It has symbolism, poetic format, imagery, philosophical/political issues regarding teenage moms and welfare, and two emotionally strong, female protagonists. Two teenage girls - one a mom, the other her children's babysitter-become friends and develop their self-esteem and strength together. It gripped my heart at the end, there. Phew. Wasn't prepared for those tears at all.I will be recommending this tomorrow in class.11:5611-14-12
Fourteen-year-old LaVaughn answers an ad for an after-school babysitting job that turns out to be life-changing.
When Jolly gets fired, LaVaughn babysits for free during Jolly's job search.
The book is beautiful to read with a poetic style that defies rules and expectations, and tells a provoking story that challenges the reader's assumptions about poverty, teen pregnancy, and life choices.
She seems too perfect, inhumanly perfect, with no endearing faults.
Her only real fault (and it is not endearing) is a tendency to judge others.
I found this book depressing, but the writing is beautiful and the story poses some worthwhile questions.
"'I counted 17 ladies and girls on the bus.
And I thought of all the blood.
That's a lot of blood.
You know?'" I love that because that’s what I think every time I see a group of girls.
I think of how much blood they bleed and how much more there’s to come.
If I pour all their blood they bleed into a pool, would it overspill?
Do they smell their blood after they catch their blood?
I wouldn’t have thought this woman pictured it like me.
It’s good to write things people think but don’t ever say.
It’s good.
While a nice enough story about resilience, Make Lemonade confirmed that I just don't "get" the whole novel in free verse phenomenon. Sometimes limits, such as the compressed length of a short story, or the structured poetry of Shakespeare's plays lead to increased creativity on the part of the author. As I have for the other verse novels I've read I felt like the poetry in Make Lemonade led to lack of complexity in characterization and material closer to a short story than a "novel".
I love this! Another one from my YA Lit class. It's a highly accessible story about two teenage girls growing up in a rough neighborhood. One babysits the other's two young babies, to make money for college. It's written in the style of urban poetry. The story tells about daily life, and offers little originality in the topic matter, but it still manages to be really interesting. It asks deep questions about socio-economics, in ways that kids can grapple with them.
This book is about how a mom(Jolly) who's seventeen and has two kids, is helped by thirteen-year-old LaVaughn, and she turns out to be one of the most important assets in Jolly's life.
This book kind of tells you about the things that Jolly went through, but it's mostly talking about the life-changing events that went on in Jolly's household.
There was one part of Make Lemonade that really cuaght my eye.That was when Jolly did everything she could to save her baby, Jillie.
I think that is truly showing love for her baby, even though she's only seventeen.
This poetry book was not my cup of tea.
Make Lemonade Book Review LaVaughn is an ambitious girl with high hopes and dreams of going to college.
However, LaVaughn ends up babysitting Jolly’s two kids, and Jolly is a single mom who is 17 years old, struggling fiercely with life.
Things aren’t going to be sour and bitter forever; there is a time when things come to an end, when things will become sweet.This book related to my life (well, it related more to my past) because when I first moved here to Korea, I struggled with Korean culture and education.
When life gives you lemons, make lemonade. LaVaughn needed a part-time job, something she could do after school to help earn money for college. Jolly needed a babysitter, someone she could trust with two kids while she worked the evening shift.It didn't matter that LaVaughn was fourteen, only three years younger than Jolly. It didn't matter that Jolly didn't have a husband or a mom and dad, because LaVaughn gives Jolly and her two babies more love and understanding than should be possible for a
LaVaughn needed a part-time job, something she could do after school to help earn money for college.
Jolly needed a babysitter, someone she could trust with two kids while she worked the evening shift.It didn't matter that LaVaughn was fourteen, only three years younger than Jolly.
It didn't matter that Jolly didn't have a husband or a mom and dad, because LaVaughn gives Jolly and her two babies more love and understanding than should be possible for a fourteen-year-old, because if she doesn't no one else will.I admire Wolff's style.
It is the first time i've read of such a style.
What an incredible book!!!!
It is rich in character development, spot on in the harsh reality of the consequences of teen aged pregnancy when there is little or no support base, poetic in words and heartbreaking and heartwarming at the same time!Needing a job to save for college, 14 year old LaVaughn accepts the position of babysitter for two children.
Seventeen years old, living in poverty, surrounded by hopelessness, their mother Jolly simply cannot get a grip on how to survive and look beyond day - day living.
I haven't reviewed any YA on GR yet, not because I've not read any, but there's so much YA that covers all the same territory (i.e. dysfunction) in much the same way.
This book's style was fresh when published in 1993, and YA free verse writing was quickly published from other writers, evidenced by Karen Hesse winning the Newbery four years later with "Out of the Dust." Eminem's first CD came out in 1996.
But, if this book wasn't good, if it didn't hit a nerve, if it didn't resonate with both its targeted audience and those who get these books into kids hands, I wouldn't be writing this review now, twenty years later.
5 stars not just because it's excellent ...
but because Wolff really was at the leading edge of what has become a delightful genre with all kinds of wonderful possibilities--the novel in verse.
I find it interesting that Wolff knew instinctively that this style of writing (which didn't even have a name at the time) would be the perfect format to address bright but struggling readers.
Telescoped ideas and emotions, viscerally expressed themes; that's what this genre does best, and the best novels in verse published today are still those that compress a lot of meaning into surprisingly few words.
This book, _Make Lemonade_ was described in a "BookPage" review as "a journey of discovering how to turn life's lemons into lemonade".There are now 3 books in the "Make Lemonade" trilogy. The sequel to _Make Lemonade_ is _True Believer_. The third book is _This Full House_.The is a first-person narrative. I enjoy that voice.The books are written in free verse poetry which the author describes as "prose in funny-shaped lines" (BookPage review, March 2009).
Read this as part of my Teen Services class in grad school. Lovely.
Third read, great every time!
I feel like it’s going to make people enjoy it because they will learn why some people don’t want to waste their parents money just for college and they will work hard for it.
I think this was a good book because La Vaughn was a hard worker character.
If I was y’all I would try hard and read this book because if you read it you’ll learn why the La Vaughn tries really hard to get the right amount of money to go to college.
If you’re a teenager and you don’t have money to got to college you should read this cook and know why La Vaughn was working for.
A girl Lavaughn offered to watch her kids.
Lavaughn helps with the kids still, and jolly has to go to school to get a better job and support her kids.
I liked it when Lavaughn tells her mom, “Jollys fired that means I’ve got no babysitting money”(Wolf.60) her mom feels bad for jolly and tried to help.
I also like it when Lavaughn “Took Jolly to her steam class”(Wolf.86).
Lavaughn is trying to shoe Jolly that she needs to get back in school so she can support her kids now and in the future.
I like LaVaughn.
I like the way she tries to figure out the world, if she's taking advantage of Jolly or if Jolly is taking advantage of her.
I like the way these two girls, only three years apart, have such vastly different lives and they way they're brought together.
I like that there isn't anything too trite like a scene where LaVaughn just gives in an cleans Jolly's apartment for her (which is what I might have done).
I enjoyed the sequel, True Believer, even more.
I think the poetic style comes through more there, reminds me a bit of Sharon Creech.
This book was about a teenage girl named LaVaughn who just wanted to have a job to save money for college. However, then she meets Jolly, a girl not that much older than her who has 2 kids. Jolly is struggling and the LaVaughn is helping her out by babysitting. This book was definitely a page turner and I loved this story.

Not satisfying.. the ending was disapointing
This book was good but I wish that there was more interesting parts the most interesting thing was at the end.
In the book Make Lemonade by Virginia Euwer Wolff, the author uses unique and subtle motifs to show the challenges that people face when they are put through the hardships of poverty but must persevere to break out of it.
“Yes, sir,” says the driver.” On page 37, Virginia Euwer Wolff uses another symbol to connect to the meaning of the challenges of poverty and how to face them.
They just have to lie in it.” This connects to the fact that some people have bad adversities to face, but they just need to “lie” in it, and basically get through it and face it.Generally, like a lemon tree, it is hard to take the first leap into growing out of poverty and into a successful blooming plant.
Jolly struggles to stay on top of her rent, keep the dishes from becoming a huge moldy pile of dishes, stop Jilly from hollering all the time.
LaVaughn becomes stuck inside Jolly's problems with--trying to help her sift through the small daily events that come up that make life hard and sometimes ironically funny.
There is a moment of empowerment or redemption or something at the end that makes it feel more complete even inside the grit of real life.
That moment that Jolly saved Jilly's life--let's talk about moments like that.
Let's talk about that moment when Jeremy sat on the shoe bus, when he pushed the 9 by himself.
I really like the author's style of writing, she does a great job connecting to the reader and showing the point of the view from LaVaughn, the main character.
She does a great job showing specific detail that makes you get a picture in your head of what the character is seeing.
And in my opinion thats a very inspiring message to read about.I rated this book a 4 on good reads but if there was half stars i would rate it a 4.5 because i really liked this book.
I would recommend this book to teens because they can find a really good connection with the main character.
Lavaughn is going to go to college.
But college is expensive and Lavaughn needs money.
But in order to keep her job, Jolly needs a babysitter.
Lavaughn is bright, hardworking and is determined to make a better life for herself.
Lavaughn decides Jolly needs help and does all that she can to help Jolly recognize and achieve a better life.
Wolff does an amazing job at realistically depicting the struggle of two people trying to make a life better for themselves.
Jolly is at times irritating, but this is because she is embarrassed and ashamed of her ignorance, and Wolff shows this subtly so that you begin to double think your irritation towards her.
In this book the main character La Vaughn whos a younf teenage girl whos 14 years old is saving up money to pay for her collage.
She believed that she had a better way to earn money other then babysitting but she stuck to the job as much she hated the place she worked in she still kept working.
My favorite part of the book is when La Vaughn helps Jolly the mother of the 2 kids she babysitts to go back to school.
i believe that La Vaughn noticed how she wasnt the only one who went trough difficulties.
