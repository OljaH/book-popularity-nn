and it does not feature extreme violence - the violent moments are just that, 'moments', and there is no juvenile dwelling on the pornography of blood, guts, & pain (although there is definitely blood, guts, and pain in our protagonist's life).Curse of Chalion is Adult Fantasy in a few ways.first, it is all about the interior life and the slow-burning changes in a broken man.
he is one of the most thoughtful protagonists i've come across in Fantasy and a truly Grown Up, Adult Hero.second, the pacing is very deliberate.
it moves at a conservative pace, bringing the reader along on Cazaril's slow journey.
Funny thing: halfway through this book I found myself thinking about what it is that makes Bujold's writing so distinctive in the world of science fiction and fantasy (she's another one of these writers who straddles both worlds), and it suddenly came to me that she was like Jane Austen, interested most of all in people and their relationships in constraint-ridden societies.
So, not an original observation, but more reliable for being an independent duplicate.Also like Jane Austen, her books tend to be fairly similar to one another...
even though she writes both science fiction and fantasy.
You know all these books sporting princes and princesses fighting for or defending their heritage, the tales that take you right there to the very heart of what is happening and let you experience the heat of events through the eyes and hearts, and souls of the high and lofty?
The motif I found the most profound in the whole book is the invitation to reconsider our own personal paths - when we a arrive at some point in our lives we can always ask ourselves: was it by accident, by pure chance or was there some design, some pattern to it?
I think it should be outlawed.”Undoubtedly, the way Ms Bujold approached the divine and supernatural is one of the strongest points of the book.
The first time I read this, I was torn between my respect for Bujold and the slow burning plot of this first fantasy I had ever read by her.
But she's so excellent with SF, why switch?" And then when I started reading it, there were none of the fast-paced elements or larger than life characters that I expected.In fact, other than the fact that Cazaril was a broken man like Miles, he was pretty much Miles's opposite.
The Bastard's death magic is particularly harrowing, and it happens to have the largest role and plot significance in the novel.
It's hard reviewing books that I really like, especially when I don’t really have a systemic way to determine whether or not a book deserves a five star rating (i.e., the I-want-to-sing-and-gush rating).
Let me start this review from the point in time when I first realized that this book was a WIN.
No hard feelings if you're missing out on one very layered, very charming character in fantasy.After all, though he is a hero, Cazaril's not like an honor-stiffened Ned Stark or a badass Roland Deschain or even a wise and powerful Gandalf.
Bujold thankfully avoids the traps of failing to have critical information shared between characters, so while Caz undergoes spiritual struggles, he discovers people to help him find his path.
I also greatly appreciated Iselle, the young female royal being developed and individualized into a well-rounded, thoughtful person, almost the exact opposite of her brother.There are a few fantastical elements that are well placed, making it an epic fantasy filled with divine miracles more than magical ones.
I enjoyed the assured way Bujold handles language and development, and appreciated the balance between reflection and action.
I like this trend a lot, but once in a while there comes a book that is none of that.Enter "The Curse of the Chalion".
This book is polite.
It tells a great story and has a very relatable and likeable main protagonist.Cazaril, our main character and only view point perspective, is 35.
In the course of the story he turns 36, which is my age right now, so I can perfectly relate to him.It's a pleasure to read about his kindness, his intelligence and humility.Kudos to the author, who created a very believeable character.
Now and then however a wonderful book comes along built on the characters within.This is definitely a character driven story.
There is about this story (much of the way) a melancholy feel of the inevitable doomed hero moving inexorably toward his fate...
Allowing for the fact that this is a story, it to is fairly interesting).
The overarching sadness here, much of it from the weakness of the story's gods and the way things had to be worked out was very effective.This was for me a very pleasing book and an enjoyable experience, and I plan to read the sequel(s).

Now I wish you all Happy Reading and may you always find what you need in the pages of a good Book!!!
Muy, muy bueno. Me ha gustado mucho conocer la pluma de esta escritora y su mundo. Sin duda, una gran aventura.PD: Muchas gracias Fonch por acompañarme en este viaje.
I've read Curse of Chalion twice over the years and loved it both times.
It is a fantasy story with an original feel and with a truly unique main character.
The story followed Lord Lupe dy Cazaril.
It seemed an easy position at first but soon Cazaril found himself caught up in the complicated politics of Chalion.
The story was very engaging and the best thing it had going for it was Cazaril himself.
Caz was a super easy character to like and root for and was a different sort of fantasy hero.
This is top notch quality fantasy.
It has politics, scheming, a well defined system of gods and religion, well developed characters who all develop in leaps and bounds through the story.
The story is a slow burner, but it’s so good you won’t care.
I hope the rest of the series lives up to its first novel.
This book makes you think about our fates in the world, how life is arranged, how events and lives intertwine and how maybe we are all part of a greater plan than we can know.
“I need words that mean more than they mean, words not just with height and width, but depth and weight and, and other dimensions that I cannot even name.” *That is Lois McMaster Bujold effortlessly describing what I often feel about excellent writing but lack the skill to articulate.
What I like best about starting a Bujold book is that feeling of homecoming.
Another Bujold trademark is unconventional protagonists, she tends to stay away from the fearsomely skilled and well endowed sexy heroic type.
....* Back to that “I need words that mean..." quote.I just want to mention that it is not highlighted in my Kindle edition of this book.
“Well, what is a blessing but a curse from another point of view?” I’ve been reading fantasy for a long time, however  The Curse of Chalion revealed a new variation of the genre for me, which I loved. Here we don’t get to know a fantastical world, action-packed adventure with strange and out of our experience characters. It reminded me of a medieval world with power struggles not unheard of, but at the same time ultimately unique. It’s profound in that it doesn’t pretend to be more than it is,
It’s profound in that it doesn’t pretend to be more than it is, and in doing so it achieves much more than we could expect.The Curse of Chalion is the story of a man beaten by war and betrayals, vicissitudes of life.
Cazaril isn’t an accessible and clean-cut hero, but gradually he carried the story with ease and ended conquering that status in my eyes.
“I have had another thought on such fates that denies neither gods nor man.
The Curse of Chalion is not an action moved plot, but driven by people and their relationships.
The main plot was straightforward and enjoyable although the prominence of gods and curses undermined the importance of the characters while making the political machinations seem somewhat trivial.
The hints in the story that he wasn't always so bad and that the curse turned his own good qualities against him felt like a waste of a great opportunity.
The frequent use of god's as plot-points isn't my preferred type of story, although for those who like this kind of high fantasy this plot will surely be enjoyable as it was handled well here.I thought the world-building was one of this book's biggest strengths.
After escaping, he hobbles his way back to Chalion, feeling like an old man at age 35.
The soul searching and attempts by Cazaril to make meaning of his fate feel like a creative way to lighten his load.
I loved the following example which feels like the story of Job given a Buddhist slant: If the gods saw people’s souls but not their bodies, in mirror of the way people saw bodies but not souls, it might explain why gods were so careless of such things as appearance, or other bodily functions.

I think it should be outlawed.”Undoubtedly, the way Ms Bujold approached the divine and supernatural is one of the strongest points of the book.
At times it reminded me a bit of Hobb's writing style (this is very high praise from me) and I really enjoyed being able to follow a character who was 35 rather than a typical 'farmboy' etc.
(although we all know I love a good farmboy story too)This book focuses around Cazeril, a man who has had one hell of a life.
We follow Cazeril along the road where he uncovers the remnants of Death magic, and he also meets all kind of people who are both good and bad and somewhere in-between.
The first part of the book is the story of how he rebuilds his life, and how his sense of honor brings him to continue giving his life and loyalty to Chalion even when he feels he has nothing left to give.It's a slow start - I didn't see what the point of it all was for quite a while.
The slow start is something I can deal with because it pays off in the second half of the book - but give me too many medical details and I'm just not happy.
This is the first book in a trilogy, but it really feels complete to me as it is.
Last Monday I bought a house.
Since then I haven't read a single page of a book, or written a single word of a review.
I have, however, stripped a lot of wallpaper, painted skirting boards and ceilings, planed and re-hung six doors, packed, carried and unpacked an awful lot of boxes, built a couple of beds, a cot and a bookcase, battled cats into cages and entertained a toddler.
What a great book!It reminded me to put everything by Bujold that I haven't read on my wishlist!Engaging characters meet an action-filled plot with tons of plotting and intrigue.
I'd very much recommend this to fans of George R.R. Martin and Guy Gavriel Kay.My edition came with blurbs from Robert Jordan & Dennis McKiernan, and an ad for the latest Weis & Hickman - all of which, I must admit, I eyed with trepidation, not having an overly high opinion of any of those authors - but although this is undeniably epic fantasy, Bujold's writing far exceeds those other authors.
And today at work, I must admit, I had the book at my desk, sneaking a page here and there at opportune moments....
***Actual rating: 5,00***Simply stunning. The best classic fantasy I've read in ages. Characterisation of the main character probably the best I've ever read.
Executive Summary: It took me a little bit to warm up to, but in the end I found this an enjoyable read. Full Review I read this as the August pick for Sword & Laser. Despite considering myself more Sword than Laser (or maybe because I do?), I think overall I've been mostly disappointed with the Sword picks, especially the last two.This one however, did not disapoint. It starts a bit slow. The pacing reminded me a bit of Assassin's Apprentice, so you if you enjoyed those books, you may enjoy
Executive Summary: It took me a little bit to warm up to, but in the end I found this an enjoyable read.
It's the characters that make this book enjoyable.It's also nice to get away from all the grimdark fantasy I've been reading with something lighter.
That is both a nice change from most fantasy these days, and a little sad, because I've grown attached to her characters and would like to see how they make out after the story ends.This is my first book by Ms. McMaster Bujold, but won't be my last.
I realized something as I was reading this book.
Many fantasy books, when they involve any kind of court culture, have as their viewpoint character someone who doesn't know how it works, and blunders around until he or she figures it out.
It's relatively rare to have the main character be someone who does know exactly how things work.
Cazaril, the main character, is such a man.
He isn't a quintessential courtier by any means, but he knows how things work.Note: The rest of this review has been withdrawn due to the changes in Goodreads policy and enforcement.
What a delightful world.
The work that went into researching medieval Spain sows, as does theincrediblemimagination that went into turning the story into its own consistent telling rather than just a metaphor.
Now layer on top of that a deep theological debate nested in an other-worldly system where the debate is not between monotheistic beliefs and their prophets, but polytheistic beliefs and the acceptance or rejection of a lucifer-like god as a force for good or ill.
Top it all off with strong likable characters prevailing against the odds to save a kingdom a family and a world and you have a masterwork.
Another thing that may like is the vision that has Lois Mcmaster Bujold of the policy, as of diplomacy in this universe, as in his novels of science fiction starring thousands Vorkosigan https://www.goodreads.com/series/9825...
The characters in this case if it is thousands move by the corrupt world of Barrayar, Cazaril, and Iselle moved by Cardegoss without staining, or corrupted indeed is fascinating, as it features Lois Mcmaster Bujold evil in the universe of the five gods in this case by m middle of a curse by a King, that looks like Alfonso X (but it is not).
And hallelujah for that.It’s curious that in many ways the characters fall into traditional fantasy stereotypes: the battle-weary warrior; the feisty princess about to be forced into an unwelcome marriage; the playboy prince; the evil advisor to the king.
I liked very much that Cazaril isn’t hell-bent on revenge, though, and just wants to keep his head down and survive as best he can.The magic is low-key, and revolves around the five gods, the Father, Mother, Son, Daughter and Bastard, and the way they interact with their human followers.
This is a beautifully written book, with a memorable and wonderful main character, a plot that doesn’t depend on villains who are evil just because, and a resonant ending which brought me to tears.
I can't find reason to delete a single word from this book because every single detail, as meager as may be, is important for the course of action or building characters; and sometimes they are crucial in more than just one way.
He would never have a chance against the curse if it wasn't for the past developments, which are sometimes educed deceivingly obscure.Some other reviewers complained that the pace of the novel is too slow - but I don't believe that to be the case either.
A lovely, intimately told story of court intrigue and of the good people who are sorely tested to remain good in the midst of peril coming at them from all sides. There are moments of beauty and lots of quiet, good humor, that are brought to vivid life by a sharply-drawn and entirely believably human cast of characters. This was my first Bujold novel and it most certainly won’t be my last.
4/5; 4 stars; A-This is great fantasy writing.
I loved the character Caz. He starts out the story in a state of utter destruction.
Just the kind of main character I can really get behind.
Another thing I liked about this book was the Five Gods themselves.
The theology of this fantasy world is interesting.
One of the things I have always appreciated about this author is that she can introduce some pretty heavy themes and complex ideas into her work but there is always the little pocket of humour here and there.This narrator, Lloyd James, is new to me but I will definitely listen to more of his work.
I liked the way he interpreted the voices.
