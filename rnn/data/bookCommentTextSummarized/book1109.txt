The Prophet was Gibran's first book and is his magnum opus. One of the greatest books ever written.Wanderer is also a good one.
Beautifully poetic, inspiring and insightful. Great read for those who love prose.
Short read, obvious advice on how to live life, nothing quite unique but not bad either.
Beautiful musings by the Poet of Lebanon.
Every line is quotable!
I take it almost everywhere.Kahlil Gibran is a crafter of art with words.
I take this book everywhere with me (using Kindle on my phone) and read it in waiting rooms and such.
I can't say I've read the entire thing cover to cover, but I do skim through and find things that interest me at the time.
Kahlil Gibran doesn't write limericks, though.
He takes life and uses words to reflect the true essence of what we feel, perhaps even what we are.
Sometimes it is like opening my eyes in a dark room and seeing a shining light in the distance.
i always like to read kahlil gibranhis unique philosophy for life, relation, personality, love there are no wordseveryone must read
