Reading Montague Summers is a real treat. Only can the great Monty start a tale about a Cobbler from Istanbul then segue into descriptions of dandyisim in shoes only to return to the story of the cobbler which ends in a necrophiliac encounter that begets a disembodies head they turns the cobbler's (Who in the mean time has become a pirate) enemies to stone. Fascinating details concerning style and machanics of shoe construction. Monty roxx.
Whether through laziness or pomposity (by 1928, a classical education was hardly the norm, even in Britain), Summers peppers the book with lengthy, un-translated passages in Greek, Latin, Middle and Modern French, and Middle High German.The Latin, French and German weren’t serious problems for me, but I don’t read Classical Greek and neither, I imagine, do many modern readers.
If you’re interested in the real vampire (the dreaded vlkodlak that kept Balkan peasants sleepless, clutching talismans and muttering prayers), this is your book.
Montague Summers,  The Vampire in Lore and Legend  [reprint of The Vampire in Europe, 1929] 329 pagesThe companion book to The Vampire: His Kith and Kin = Vampires and Vampirism. I won't repeat what I've already said in the review of that book. This book concentrates more on Europe, especially Eastern Europe (Greece, Russia, Roumania, Bulgaria). The quotations in this one are mostly translated. There is a good deal of repetition of stories from the first book.
Blargh... this would have been so much better if the author had taken into account that not everyone interested in horror folklore knows every imaginable language out there. Oh well... maybe there will be a better translation some day.
More of the same in this one as with his book in the vampire, except he does more with the late nineteenth and early twentieth century.
