:/ Here's our "cast":Alex AKA Rose HathawayAidan AKA DimitriDeacon/Seth AKA Adrian* Deacon (HB) and Adrian (VA) both have drinking problems* Caleb AKA MasonLea AKA Mia ....gosh their names even rhyme -__- In the Vampire Academy Mia's mother dies due to Strigoi attacks, in Half Blood Lea's parent dies due to Daimon attacks.
But this book isn't just similar, it's been copied to the point where I got confused over whether I was reading Half-Blood or Vampire Academy.
- - - - - - -So I went on to read the second book, hoping the rumors were true that the it was completely vampire-academy-less.
Surely this book is illegal. I mean, someone once tried to sue J.K. Rowling because their book included a kind of wizard sport tournament similar to the one found in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, they claimed she had stolen the idea from them... and this small matter takes up such a minuscule percentage of the novel! Not to mention the fact that no one I knew had ever heard of the guy's novel before...Now, pretty much everyone I speak to has heard of - if not read - the Vampire Academy s
Things started to branch off from the obviously stolen idea and take their own shape; like the introduction of Apollyon (a half-blood who is granted super powers in order to keep pures in check, but only one can exist at any given time) and some other interesting discoveries that I can't talk about without giving away huge spoilers.Even though Half-Blood is a well-written, dark and sexy novel, I couldn't help but be turned off when I discovered that the author had taken someone else's idea.
I'm in love with Aiden St. Delphi.Of course that's not a big surprise, since he's the reincarnation of one of my first and eternal book crushes, Dimitri Belikov, but still it's a reason to smile (well, not for my mother, she weeps every time I fall for another fictional character instead of producing grand-children).  “You will kill the ones you love. It is in your blood, in your fate. So the gods have spoken it and so the gods have come to foresee it.”  There is a secret society, one us mortals
I'm in love with Aiden St. Delphi.Of course that's not a big surprise, since he's the reincarnation of one of my first and eternal book crushes, Dimitri Belikov, but still it's a reason to smile (well, not for my mother, she weeps every time I fall for another fictional character instead of producing grand-children).
Once upon a time, the horny greek gods mated with humans, and thus the Hematoi (or Pure-Bloods) Moroi were born.
Even though Alex is the reason I almost gave Half-Blood 3 stars, it is Aiden that deserves all the stars in the sky.
Paranormal/fantasy books are not my favorite genre, but every once in a while I like to read one to change things up a bit.
While I'd by lying if I said that it was the kind of book that makes me fall in love with the characters and rush out to grab a copy of the next book in the series, I can't deny that I enjoyed it.The story centers on a seventeen year-old girl who was born into a "secret society" of sorts.
She was schooled at the Covenant, where pure-bloods and half-bloods train to be Sentinels - fighters that hunt daimons, the evil pure-bloods that feed off of other pure-bloods.However, before Alexandria could complete her training her mother leaves the Covenant, taking her with her.
At the beginning of Half-Blood, she is found by Dimitri Aiden and other Guardians Sentinels and returned to the Covenant, where she hopes to continue her education.
Of course, Aiden steps up and offers to train her in his free time and because of his words, Alex is given a chance to prove that she can become just as good as the others by the end of the summer.
Alex is a half-blood, try guessing what Aiden is!
Far too many characters and situations were just copied from the Vampire Academy series to Half-Blood for it to be an accident.
Finally finished! I'm absolutely in love with this series! Took me a bit to read it but loved every second of it. Really loved the pace and execution of this story. JLA's MC are always awesome and interesting, plus the guys are to die for (I'm referring to Aiden btw ;). Seth is great....but Aiden is my favorite for some reason.. Caleb is an awesome best friend and he's adorable! This story reminded me of Cassandra Clare's work, which I found really cool! Awesome and highly recommended read. Really can't wait to read the rest of this series.
If you've read either Half-Blood or Vampire Academy (it doesn't matter which one) this review will basically be spoiler free because you'll know what's going on from reading either book when I do my comparison.
I would say at least 85% of the story was ripped from VA books 1 and 4, and the other 15% was given a Percy Jackson-like twist.I read the book because I was craving a Mead fix, and missing Dimitri something fierce.
I'd read it all before in other books, and some of it felt like I was rehashing Percy Jackson (especially the part with the oracle).So uh...yeah.
You will kill the ones you love.Fate had been right about that.  Blurb:  The Hematoi descend from the unions of gods and mortals, and the children of two Hematoi pure bloods have godlike powers. Children of Hematoi and mortals--well, not so much. Half-bloods only have two options: become trained Sentinels who hunt and kill daimons or become servants in the homes of the pures. Seventeen-year-old Alexandria would rather risk her life fighting than waste it scrubbing toilets, but she may end up s
Damn him.I like how we see him getting fond of Alex day by day and how their relationship grows till the point you can feel it between the pages.Aiden is such a tormented soul who had to grow up way too fast to take care of his brother after his parents were killed by daimons and he’s such a badass sentinel I just want to hug the crap out of him and then fuck him senseless, what can I say.Girls, he’s a good boy, he truly is but oh, he can behave badly when he wants to.
I know you’ll come a long way and all that shit but still and maybe I’m getting a bit ahead of what’s gonna happen with him but yeah, asshole.Oh, and one thing I didn’t like about the book was that I couldn’t feel Alex’s loss when it came to her mother.
WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT???! This is what I was talking about! Ms. Armentrout! You really know how to make your fans scream out more!!! Merged review: MY REACTION AFTER READING THE BOOK:     [image error]Yes! I am extremely happy!This book exceeded my expectations!THE GISTHere are some of the things you need to know about first before I get to the real gist of this book. We all know that the Greek gods were very fond of mingling with humans. And when they mingle with humans in a not so innocent w
Fortunately, people from the Covenant a Pure named Aiden St. Delphi (the guy she’s been secretly fantasizing over for three years) found Alex and took her back to where she belongs.
I didn’t know what to expect with the male lead character Aiden.
I mean yeah Daemon from Obsidian was hot as hell but I didn’t know that Jennifer could create someone as hot as Daemon but in a different way!
Seth is delicious a hottie too just so you guys know!The supporting characters were there to love and hate too.
Fast-paced and infused with JLA humor that has since become the norm when I read her books.
Felt like the school aspect of the plot was a bit unrealistic (haven't read Vampire Academy so not sure if it was an issue in that one too) but I could be a bit biased in boarding school-related settings.
I loved how she shares the same role as Seth and he doesn't get along with Aiden, that should make things very promising for the sequel.
As always, I feel like JLA's strength lies in dialogue & romance, her weakness in this book was definitely the action and a bit the overall plot.
Every once in a while a reader might be fortunate enough to stumble upon a piece of published literature that makes them feel  SO BLOOD ADEQUATE  as an aspiring author.For me, this book has done it. If this stuff can be published and loved then I think I’m gonna be a best-selling author in multiple universes. Name your most hated clichéd tropes, kids and I will guarantee you will find them in this book. :) 1. The writing is so immature. IT’S LIKE A TEN YEAR OLD WAS GIVEN A FREE PASS AT WRITING F
Every once in a while a reader might be fortunate enough to stumble upon a piece of published literature that makes them feel  SO BLOOD ADEQUATE  as an aspiring author.For me, this book has done it.
IT’S LIKE A TEN YEAR OLD WAS GIVEN A FREE PASS AT WRITING FAN FICTION AND THIS IS THE BEST THEY CAME UP WITH.
HE’S REALLY SUPER HOT.
He’s probably as hot as the sun.
He’s hot.
I’d been gawky and a total dweeb then" Someone end me.5.
yet not interesting enough for me to CARE why it’s so dramatic.7.
Overall, this book was a wonder!!!
What happened to her was horrific---'tragic' is for people who die in car wrecks!" Daimons are basically the Strigoi of this series, but they drink blood from Pures and Half to obtain the Aether carried in their bloodstream.
Caleb stood up as I walked into the living room."You look hot."I scrunched up my face."You think this is hot?"He laughed as he turned toward the door."No"Then there's the sexy Aiden St. Delfi, a Full Blood also referred to as Hematoi; he's fiercely responsible and dedicated to training Alex to becoming a powerful Sentinel.
Half-Blood is book one in the Covenant series by Jennifer Armentrout. The world Jennifer has created in this series is both disturbing and amazing. This book has both intense action and sweet love. I was hooked on page one.   Alexandria or Alex for short is a Half-Blood. Her mother is a pure and her father whom she never met was a mortal. Pures are like the royalty. Half-Bloods not so much. Halfs are either trained as Sentinels who hunt and kill daimons or they are forced into servitude for the
Half-Blood is book one in the Covenant series by Jennifer Armentrout.
Alexandria or Alex for short is a Half-Blood.
Halfs are either trained as Sentinels who hunt and kill daimons or they are forced into servitude for the Pures.
Then, there is the Apollyon who is a Half but has special powers over all of the elements.
The person that is training her is none other than the Pure, Aiden St. Delphi.
“Do you know what your name means?
I can anticipate there is so much more coming for Alex, Aiden, Seth, and the other residents of the Covenant.
First I would like to say I've never given a book 1 star, because I think that just the dedication of an author earns him at list 2 stars.
It equals Strigoi, Damphirs and Moroi.Once a Pure drinks the Aether (blood) from another, it becomes a monster, a Daimon.
It's just like vampires.The plot begins with Alex who is returning to the Covenant (The Academy) after a long time.
She needs to catch up with her training, to be a Guardian - Oops, a Sentinel one day and kill Strigoi - ah, Daimons.
Alex being kidnapped just like in book 2 in VA series.
i've been pretty let down by a lot of YA lately shatter me so it was kind of refreshing to read something that was nice and entertaining.now let's be clear: this book isn't going to win any awards for like, achievements in literature but it was FUN.
this is a lot like vampire academy.but actually, the lore is better!because pure bloods and half bloods only sort of coexist.
now the good stuff: man meatsthere's a scinty hinty of some super special love geometry and i'll be real clear with you: I DON'T GIVE A FUCK WHAT YOU SAY.
FIVE FUN FACTS about JENNIFER L.
ARMENTROUT + Book Signing Photos - > HERE 6 FUCK ME HARD (OR JUST RUB UPON ME) AIDEN STARSIt’s not secret I am a Jennifer L.
Armentrout (J.Lynn) fan.
Yes, I have a girl crush list (just like a book boyfriend list) and she is an author that is on there.
So, with my mini me (that’s my reading buddy, I call her mini me, b/c she’s ten years younger than me and reminds me of me ten years ago) told me to read Half-Blood, I said, well what the heck.Oh my god, where h
I love the Lux series, but book 1, Half-Blood, oh no comparison.I fucking gobble this shit up and real good!
(I know that didn’t make sense, but it was the only way I could convey my feelings)Alex (Alexandria) is a Half-Blood and Aiden is a Pure (full-blood).
Yes, there’s back story and side characters, but I love reads where it’s mainly about the Hero and Heroine.
I was like Oh my god until the last second and you will too.If you aren’t a huge fan of YA paranormal reads, I just think you aren’t picking up the right books.
This book is amazing! Fans of VAMPIRE ACADEMY will love it. The main character, Alex, has a wonderfully edgy, sarcastic voice, and she's simultaneously strong and vulnerable. I pulled this query out of the slush pile and read the manuscript in a day--I couldn't put it down! Put this on your "to-read" list; you won't be disappointed!
Jennifer L. Armentrout, writing Half-Blood:
So freaking good!!! 😍😍😍 I'm going to read next book like right now... 😏😏😏
As it stands, the characters and the plot all feels like a very watered down version of VA.
The premise is slightly different, but the boarding school setting, the reviled and necessary half-bloods, the evil daimons/strigoi, all felt rehashed, and not in a good way.Alex is Rose, without the spunk, with more slut-shaming (does she really need to repeatedly call her nemesis Lea a skank?
Whereas in some other series I've read like Mythos Academy, the living gods and goddesses do not get involved in the characters of their creation, whereas here they actually do take a part in monitoring their descendants.
UGH! Now I have to wait until April to find out if she gets her head on straight and realizes Seth is her man!!! LOL! Loved this book =)
I just love everything she writes. And not because she is writing literary gold rather she pulls me into these worlds and I never want to leave!
Anything by my queen, Jennifer, is freakingtastic-mindblowing AMAZING!!
big heavy words, but if you read Vampire Academy then you'll immediately notice the striking similarities between both books.
I just got halfway through it and that was enough for me to feel like I was reading a complete Vampire Academy rip-off.
However, I have been talking with a few friends and it happens that, according to them, that's not the case.
You may actually enjoy this book if you have never read Vampire Academy.
Re-read 30/9/13:Re-reading this book was like visiting an old friend with a great sense of humour! I fell in love with this series all over again from the very first page - the tale of Alex, the kickass halfblood heroine, and her journey, one that I will never, ever tire of :)Original Review"It was him - Aiden St.Delphi."As soon as I read that I was all like, "Oooooh yeah. She's got it baaaaaad." But then I read about how pures and halfs can't be together and I was all: Shit. Is. Going. To. Go.

But Aiden's like "No one here is your enemy, Alex, it's all in your head - I'm sure they all want to come over and have a tea party later on."
sure .Kickass - with tonnes of action, a brilliant new world and Armentrout's signature humour - this book is epic and is a definite must-read.
"Alex?" I turned around, figuring he'd changed his mind and was going to order me to see Marcus in the morning and fess up to my bad behaviour. "Yeah ?" He brushed a lock of dark hair off his forehead and flashed that lopsided smile. "I remember you" I scrunched up my face. "What?" The grin increased to a full smile. And... oh, man. He had dimples. The air in my lungs died. "I remember you, too" Where do I even begin by writing this review? Well……Half-Blood left me utterly speechless. It comple
I definitely think Jennifer has thrown in a curve ball with the connection between Alex and Seth and again, it’s left me wanting more.
I’m left imagining the outcome of the series and I know; only Jennifer has those answers at the moment but I will be definitely waiting impatiently until the next book is released.
I find myself imagining the worst possible outcome so I won’t be disappointed but, I honestly know I won’t be because if Pure is anything like Half-Blood, I know I be amazing.Overall, Jennifer has created a fantastic new series.
I really enjoyed this book, my only issue is I found it very similar to Vampire Academy. I wish I would have read this one first, because I really love Jennifer L. Armentrout's writing style! I'm looking forward to seeing where this story will go.
As a girl myself, I know how we think-feel-want.
Okay, okay so I finally decided to read this one knowing how awesomely, amazingly, wonderfully, beautiful Armentrout's writing is.
And that would kind of suckReview:I loved the whole Half-Blood, Pure-Blood concept.
He is just a sweetheart and really loves Alex but since he is a Pure, they can't be together.
Halfs and Pures are not supposed to mix their blood-which is a shame because DAMN, we all know she wants him too!
Aiden was a pure.” I would highly recommend this book!
I am dying to get my hands on both Onyx(sequel to Obsidian) and Pure, the Half-Blood sequel.
Gawd I am loving this series, Alex is such a great heroine. The rest of the cast ahhhh I love too 😍😍😍. I love Aidan, and Seth, and Caleb and Deacon too 🙄😚😏 I know whatever they are all awesome I love them all hahaha 😝. Off to listen to book 2 😁
If you want the same ingredients as the previous ones, love, action, drama, feisty heroines and adorable heroes, this is your chance to experience it:)The plot of the book begins with Alexandria Andros and her mon running away from the Covenant, an institute in which they lived all of their lives.
Losing her mom left a huge whole that needed filling and this aggressiveness of her will come from wanting to defend her memory.If Alex didn’t impress, Aiden did.
