Her love for Evan is a little more nauseating in this sequel than in the first, but I am glad that this whole situation introduces us to a minor but fascinating character called Grace.
If these things bug you too you might be wondering how this book still manages to pull out a load of awesome and get a high rating...Because - and I should probably stress this - Cassie and Evan are only a very small part of The Infinite Sea. This book is full of different characters and interesting little back stories that it's easy to just ignore those two.
I need this book.
I'd kill for it.
I.  Need.
I.  Need.
Book.
NOW.Rick Yancey, you better hurry up.
I know, I know, it takes time to write a masterpiece.But.Really?
Really?I just can't...my whole life is waiting.

Before reading this, I heard many many bad reviews and things about this book, and if you know me, you would know that The 5th Wave is my favorite dystopian of all time, and to be honest ,after hearing those things I kind of stepped away from this book because I didn't want it to "destroy" the first book as many people have said.
____________________________________________The Infinite Sea follow the story of the first book "The 5th Wave".
Ringer is still a great character but still Cassie got my heart in the first book.
I liked this book, but after the awesomeness of The 5th Wave, it was somewhat of a let down.
The writing, world, and characters were all fantastic, but the story was hard for me to get into, especially in the first 100 pages or so, which I felt kind of dragged.
Things picked up and the book definitely ended on a high note, but that didn't quite make up for the beginning.
I'm still invested in the series and can't wait to get my hands on the final book, but I don't think this was a very strong installment in the trilogy.
I think we can all agree on how much we need this book in our lives!As for Cassie and BEN?!Why did he dare to kiss her when it should be Evan kissing her??!!Is that his way to give the former young-school-girl inside of her a cookie?
He clearly knows no that she must've been infatuated with him in school.
*Sigh/Grunt* Whatever!Evan BETTER be alive!
And Cassie better forget about her childish school crush on Ben!Come on Mr. Yancey, give us a happy ending.Oh, yeah.
I just finished this and forgot everything that happened because nothing happened.
THAT COVEEER¿September 2014? I need the fucking book right now!I can't wait EVAAAAAAAAAAAAANNN
*zero spoilers for the first book*Good morning, The Infinite Sea. I'm afraid I have some bad news.
You're suffering from a bad case of Second Book Syndrome.It's a common affliction in the YA middle child.
Not lethal, of course, but very annoying.Your name is The Infinite Sea, and the phrase was mentioned multiple times in your body.
Then there's the matter of the rats living in the walls of the abandoned hotel your characters were living in, which were referenced almost religiously in the first several chapters.
I definitely prefer The Fifth Wave to this book but The Infinite Sea doesn't fail to deliver and is 
We have a title and a publication date!!Waiting for this book which I don't even know the title.
Omfg.I'm completely blown away by what the first book did to me.I'm going to be honest here: I didn't like Evan from the start.
For me, it always was Cassie and Ben.I was okay with the friendship-bonding thing between Ben and Ringer, but Cassie and Evan?
I was just sitting there like "NO!
Please don't go all Twilight on us, like "Uh oh no, I am an alien, you're human, we can't ever be together because our species are fighting each other ohhh paranormal romance".
No, what I Need.
Crave.Good christ, I need this book so badly.
But in the end, I just have too many other books that need read to waste my time on a book that I have to force myself to keep reading.In the end, I just didn't care anymore.The story dragged so much that I just lost interest in it.
What romance?So I cheated.I knew my friend, Jen from Jenuine Cupcakes, had just finished, so I just asked her to tell me how it ended.
As it is, I don't know if I'll even have the motivation to read book 3.Dejectedly Yours, AndyeReadingTeen.netUpdate: I did end up finishing this, I just let it play (audiobook) in the background while I did other things.
August 2014?
Even the stars will wink out one by one and there will be no light or heat, and this is the war, the endless, futile war against the lightless, heatless void rushing toward us.   [Impressive Reading Experience] Oh, wow, the most enjoyable thing while reading this is that I'm completely amazed by how perfect and powerful Rick Yancey's words are. He's indeed an extraordinary writer because he never fails to overwhelm you with seemingly simple descriptions yet you'll feel the strength and emotion
Like the first book, this one contained alternative POVs from several characters in the story, but mostly from Ringer's instead of my favorite Cassie's.
He showed us that not all aliens downloaded in human bodies was unbreakable and perfect; some of them, like him, was wounded and malfuntioned, and by saying "malfuntioned", I mean not only his broken body, but also his mindset--the way he chose not to destroy humankinds as the commander ordered--was pinpointed as the ultimate target of Vosch(the commander), which brought out the next part of the story.
También tengo que mencionar a Navaja, con el que tuve una relación de amor-odio durante toda la parte que narró Hacha, pero al final puedo decir que tomó las decisiones correctas (aunque tremendamente inesperadas).El final del libro me gustó bastante, me estaba temiendo que los personajes terminarán de una forma muy similar a como terminaron en la primera parte (que era lo que se veía venir) pero Rick Yancey me sorprendió bastante con los acontecimientos de los últimos capítulos.En conclusión debo decir que aunque este libro sea mas lento que el anterior, es sin duda una excelente parte de la historia, una muy buena apertura para la conclusión, que por lo que nos cuentan aquí, va a estar muy interesante, muy sufrida y llena de acción.
re read this book this month and it was even more amazing the second time aroundI dont think anyone should or really could write a review to sum up how amazing this book is!!!! Reading it this time I noticed so many tiny things that make up so many big moments. And this book again has stolen my heart and messed with my head. So for now all I will say is, Rick Yancey has done it again... BrilliantI just can't understand how anyone couldn't like this series!  Read review for this book and others on our blog:http://southernbredsouthernread.blogs...http://southernbredsouthernread.blogs...http://southernbredsouthernread.blogs...
MOAAARRRR aliens, please.
When I think of some of my favourite series (like Legend and Percy Jackson), what makes them so great is that each book reintroduces all you need to know so that you aren't confused - this book didn't do this.
If you were reading this book straight after the 5th wave however, this wouldn't be much of a problem.
It could have easily been compressed into about 100 pages and did not deserve its own book, and would have been far more enjoyable added to either the end of the 5th wave of the beginning of the next book in the series.Plus, I just really wanted more!
wat
BEFORE READING Why can't I have this book freaking now?! Oh yeah! That's because it comes out in like what, August...of 2014?!?! UGH!!! I am SICK of cliffhangers! After what Rick Riordan did to me, I don't think I can take it! Wait...Rick Riordan...Rick Yancey...OH MY GOODNESS!!!! The Rick's are Cliffhanger kings!!! -.- why, just why? AFTER READING Warning. This review may contain spoilers. You have been warned. Don't go crying if you read something from here and you haven't gotten that far. No
After what Rick Riordan did to me, I don't think I can take it!
I loved this book so much!
It killed me to not be able to read this book for a week or so due to my homework and studies for school.
But when I did get to read it, I fell in absolute love.
I loved her loyalty to Evan.
I hate it so much and love it so much at the same time!
Ben and Ringer was like a cute couple thing to me.
Right as you make me love you with Ringer, you probably like, DIE OR SOMETHING.
*4.25 SILENT STARS* "People die. Love endures." I didn't love this book as much as I loved the prequel, but it was pretty enjoyable nonetheless!By the way, I completely forgot I still had to write this review, oops! Basically, most of what happened in this one was everyone getting their bearings and it felt like more of an extremely long prequel to the third book, which I honestly can't wait to read.Though the first half of this book was pretty boring, the second part was seriously awe-inspiring
Basically, most of what happened in this one was everyone getting their bearings and it felt like more of an extremely long prequel to the third book, which I honestly can't wait to read.Though the first half of this book was pretty boring, the second part was seriously awe-inspiring yet again.
I have no clue where Rick Yancey gets his inspiration for all these crazy plot twists, but boy I love it!
The last few chapters had me going crazy yet again!I loved that this book involved a lot of Ringer's POV, since we didn't get that in the previous one.
If anything there is (view spoiler)[ a love triangle with Ringer and another soldier instead of Ben. It all depends on your definition of love triangle.
The final third covers a period of about a month and sticks with just one character whereas the first 2/3 have a consistent and even POV switch.It is almost entirely nothing but action.
And while it was a very enjoyable read and I was riveted, I really missed the emotional impact of the first book.
There's practically no time for character development in the ensuing chaos.
She’s got Sams, with his bedraggled bear, as well as Zombie and the rest of Ben’s ragtag group, waiting with mounting impatience for Evan.
Where in hell is he or as Ringer might say, “What to hell is he?”The focus here is not so much on Ben and Cassie or even Evan for that matter.
Instead we learn more about that ragtag squad of Ben’s, most notably Ringer.
That is not to say the rest of them are ignored, in fact we do learn more about Evan’s earlier (pre invasion) days, which is how we meet Grace.
I don't think it's useless filler, but I am wondering what on earth Yancey has planned for the finale.First read in October 2014.Original review:I don't feel like much progress was actually made in this story, it felt like all filler.What went wrong for me was that we spent so much time watching our characters set things up only to never see it play out.
I need this book now! WHAT HAPPENS TO EVAN! I DOT WANT HIM TO BE DEAD!!!
So basically at first I was like, "Eh, this book is pretty mediocre compared to the first." And then as the book progressed I was like, "HOLY COW THIS BOOK IS FABULOUS." So yeah, I am completely and 100% in love with this book.
2. If Ringer is going to cling onto her feelings for Razor and Cassie refuses to stop being in love with Evan, WHO IS GOING TO END UP WITH BENJAMIN PARISH, THE BOY WHO STOLE MY HEART.
7. I like this book a lot because it's about so much more than just survival and love and regular story crap like that.
If there's an intense, Twilight-esque love triangle, I'M GOING TO MOTHERFUCKING PUNCH EVERYBODY IN SIGHT I'm going to cry really, really, really hard.Evan's the choice. It's not Ben. It never has been Ben. And godmotherfuckingdammit it never will be Ben.Cassie saved Evan. Evan's ALWAYS liked Cassie. Therefore Evan + Cassie = happy book.That is all.
First Read: June 2016, Rating: 4 StarsSecond Read: October 2018, Rating: 4 StarsI have only one thing to say: vincit qui patitur.
I thought it was amazingly written, creepy and I just fell in love hard with it.
I loved reading Cassie & Evan's part but Ben was really annoying in this book.
In this book I would say 70% of the book follows Ringer...which if I'm honest I didn't hate.I didn't love at first that it was mainly Ringer's POV because I just wanted to read more Cassie..more Evan but I gotta say I liked the change of pace.
I loved reading all her parts and her struggle in this book was REAL.
