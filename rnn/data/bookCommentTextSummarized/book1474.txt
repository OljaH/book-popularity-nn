I hadn't actually read this one before but I found it very exciting. It's yet another that I wish would've been turned into a full length book.
She fooled me again. How I love Agatha Christie and her humour.
This one was just so silly. And of course, Christie took the chance to pick on herself in the process. I love her sense of humor.
A mystery writer is accused of murder. Clever and entertaining.
Not my favorite, but an interesting story using the slight of hand.
I liked it and I disliked it. Possible spoiler..... though heck this is 50 years old, it shouldn't be all that shocking if you know your Christie shorts. Don't get me wrong, it is a fine short story, but I'm just not the fan of the cons and the bad guy getting away.
Het avontuur van meneer Eastwood (kort verhaal)bevindt zich in 10e vijflingEen raadselachtig telefoontje brengt de detectiveschrijver Anthony Eastwood naar een adres in Londen, waar een mooi Spaans meisje op hem wacht. Maar lang blijven ze niet alleen.
I might be wrong about other Christie books, this is my first, but judging by the movies this one seems to be the first with such an open ending. Well, one of the ending, rather.
There was no mystery in this story although she tried to manipulate our view of the events, yet there was nice humor that balanced such a defect.
