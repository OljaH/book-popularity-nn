Funny at first then repetitive
Inagaki Taruho was an experimental writer who wrote quirky, little nonsensical stories from the 1920s onward. Imagine a Georges Melies film in writing... Each of these delicious little stories is an object for contemplation.
Very interesting book. Avant-garde short stories (ranging from a few sentences to a page) about....well....crazy stuff. Lots of encounters with Mr. Moon, comets and stars.
薄荷水の香りがします。
