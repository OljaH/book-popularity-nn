Chapter 5 in book 5 is the most intense, the most gripping chapter of all the Fablehaven books.
I was not prepared for what Brandon Mull pulled out of his sleeve.
Brandon takes us all over the world, several continents.
It's a breathless race to find the remaining artifacts.
The Sphinx's history is revealed!My favorite characters are Seth and Vanessa.
I wish I could tell you what Vanessa knows.
And if you're in Salt Lake City on March 23 you won't want to miss the release party.
We'll announce all the details at Fablehaven.com and BrandonMull.com.

I didn't think "thank heaven's it's over," like I have with others.
At the every end of the book, Brandon mentions that he might do more with the characters, but it will be with a complete different series.
The Characters are fun and very likable.
It would be smart to start a completely different series if he would do more with these particular characters.
She got so frustrated with Seth's character, and she almost through a couple of my books.
I looked as Seth's character just as a normal brother.
Thank you Brandon Mull for letting me be part of your journey though Fableheaven.
i'm like no, oh my god, what the hell.but boy was it a good ending.
a little long but a good ending to a good series.i will absolutly pick this series up to reread again sometime.
One of the greatest things about summer is that you can read fun books that don't make you think, and Fablehaven gave me the diversion I needed.
The Harry Potter books are perfect in every way and the characters paid a steep price to get their happy ending.
Bracken and Kendra's romance weirded me out less than the whole Warren and Vanessa thing.
But maybe that is just because I wanted Warren to myself.Now the books have come to an end, and it is time for me to start thinking about a new series to keep me occupied.
Very exciting. I liked meeting new people and traveling to another preserve. The dragons were amazing. And whether or not it was intentional, Raxtus made me laugh. It's interesting to see Kendra's relationship with the Fairy Queen develop. I'm glad Seth's character is growing up; he's a lot like Warren now. Unfortunately, Warren has the worst luck of anyone.
The conclusion to the five book series focusing on a brother and sister who discover a magical world run by their grandparents.
I'm in the minority for loving it way more than Harry Schmotter, er, Potter.
:) Anyway, without giving spoilers there are a good number of twists and minor to moderate surprises.
Mind you, that's for an adult reading the book.
I suspect teen agers might be more amazed by things and such.
PAGE COUNT: 544 pp.; WHEN READ: March to July 2010; MY GRADE: B to B plus.
I think the major problem with this book was that Mull was trying to make you feel how terrible the bad guys are, how terrifying, how threatening by killing off character that we don't care about at all.
Mull even goes as far as to introduce these Eternals who are immortals that must die before the demon prison can be opened.
accidently let loose a demon a hundred times worse than the bad guy they were already fighting.Way to go Seth.
Mull even writes in something along the lines of "Seth wasn't even upset that Kendra defeated the demon king singlehandedly..." in exposition.
I started this book a few evenings after it came out and told myself I would put it down and go to bed as soon as I reached a stopping point.
I finished the book seven hours later, having read the entire thing straight through, because as it turned out, there are no stopping points.
Reading the last battle scene, it's really incredible to see how far they've come, when you think of how in the first book, Kendra was shy and scared and Seth was pretty much an idiot.And the book is surprisingly profound in places, commenting, without preaching, about the nature of good and evil and temptation and choices.
This last book in the Fablehaven series  was Is EverythingI Laughed, Cried. Cheered and Fell in Love, whilst reading this Gem. I did not want this to end. I wanted more, so much more. The plot twist was believable and enjoyable, the characters ( new and old ) were Amazing and the action and suspense was most certainly, a Euphoric Experience.I Love these Memorable Characters Immensely. Middle Grade book my Ass, this read is for any and all age groups. 10 ~ I'm sad that is over, but feel honored that I experience it ~ Stars
God, this series is my everything.
There seems to be a generation of Harry Potter fans who are looking for the fun, adventure, and growth that we experienced in that series.
What we got from these wanna-be stories is a sense of fun and adventure, but a lack of something deeper.Don’t get me wrong.
It is a story about kids thrown into a world of magic, kids that still have families.
For awhile there we began to think that kids HAD to be orphans in order to have adventures.) It has the fun.
{December 19th, 2014} MINI-REVIEW4 to 4.5 stars, I want MOAR. “Try as we might to postpone them, days of reckoning inevitably arrive.” Well this was certainly quite the ride. Everything really managed to be covered in almost 600 pages and in a smooth way to almost. I'm surprised how much work went into this final book. After the last book, I was wondering how it would hold up. Thankfully I was surprised again, especially since I finished this within less a day. Pretty insane, huh?Now what to say

Thankfully I was surprised again, especially since I finished this within less a day.
Pretty insane, huh?Now what to say about this final installment that probably hasn't been said?The final chapter was a troll ending response from the author, had me going NOOO I WANT MOAR FABLEHAVEN though lmao.
But that's the thing about good series, you're supposed feel that way by the end.
“Some imagine the difference between heaven and hell to be a matter of geography.
The difference is much more evident in the individuals who dwell there.”
Brandon Mull is simply a wonderful writer. If I had kids, I'd MAKE them read this series. All the other rave reviews are right on, and written by more talented reviewers than myself. I will add two points. First, I really like how Mr Mull weaves in little "life lessons," quite directly but without being preachy. And, Mr. Mull, if you really are contemplating writing more Fabelhaven-related books, I would love to see more of Doren and Newel! I haven't laughed out loud at dialogue in a book in a very long time.
This is by far the best and most action-packed of the series!Full RTC
This series was fantastic. I highly recommend it and the author!
Yup, my first attempt at writing an intellectual review begins with the word, WOAH.I've been loyal to the Fablehaven series ever since I read the first book.
I instantly fell in love with the ideas that were found in Brandon Mull's books.
I would like to hail Seth as one of my favorite characters in the series; but my liking for him grew in the last book.
Yeah, he's messed up more than any other character in the books but what I love about Seth is his desire to make things right.
Moving on, to other characters I liked - Kendra, Bracken, and Warren.
The conclusion to this series was really good, but I'm happy I finally finished them.
I was so happy when Kendra liked Bracken, and he returned her affection, I was so ecstatic.
When it was revealed the the Larson grandparents were alive and well, it didn't really affect me, I mean, they were assumed dead from book one, why should I care about them now?
I know that there isn't supposed to be a continuation of this series.
But I am still hoping for a new series that revisits this magical world.
The magic creatures were really cool, and I would like to see more of those in the books (if there is ever a continuation).
Now I need to read every Brandon Mull's book 🙊
تجدید ریویو:خطر اسپویل :)این مجموعه واقعا خاطره انگیز بود برام و اینقدر جذاب هست که نمیشه موقع خوندن
It's a book that really made me want to live the lives of the characters.
Now these books feel like chores, as if each character is presented with a list of things to do, and they go do them.
The book is so focused on events that the characters feel like bystanders.
Throwing in many additional characters in each book does not help improve the series, it just adds to the short choppy nature of each book.
Keys to the Demon Prison felt more like a video game than an exciting novel with specific tasks to complete, objects to retrieve and places to go.
He atrasado la lectura del último libro porque no quería que esta historia se acabara nunca.Cada libro ha sido mejor.
Aparatos mágicos y lugares maravillosos que despertarán la curiosidad del lector y lo atraparán en cada una de las páginas de esta pentalogía.Resumir el quinto libro es muy difícil sin meter algún spoiler, por ello sólo me queda decir que deberíais leer este libro.
De principio a fin es una maravilla y es la saga más original y fresca que he leído este año (aunque sea literatura juvenil).La recomiendo por encima de todo y si no lo hacéis no sabéis lo que os perdéis.
My issue with this book is the same issue I've had with all of Mull's other books.
From a technical/grammatical standpoint, it's written pretty poorly.
He employs very little imagery, and sometimes sounds like he learned to write by reading too many fantasy novels.
Mull just tells me.
Lengthy descriptions and big words don't necessarily make good writing.
I also think it was a mistake to introduce so many new characters in the last book of a series.
His ideas are good, he's pretty creative, and his characters are well developed, so in general, I like the story.
Epic conclusion for an outstanding series. There isn't much to dislike in this book. I loved it.
a little too long but a great finaly to a really great series.
Me gusta, aún así, el contraste que hace con Gavin de que uno era un perrito tartamudo y Bracken es este príncipe de las hadas super líder re marcado rubio ojos azules (srsly) carismático gracioso que sabe desenvolverse socialmente.Hay algo que empecé a notar a partir del tercer libro o algo así y es que las descripciones empiezan bien pero se van haciendo como flácidas al pensamiento (!?) y empiezan a aburrir.
Brandon is an amazing storyteller, and was able to captivate me from the very beginning of the series.
I’m thrilled that it ended the way it did, with the demon prison and everything.
Reading Keys to the Demon Prison, I was literally on the edge of my seat, bringing the book closer and closer to my face, trying to inhale everything in one breath, all of the vivid scenes that Brandon was portraying, the emotions that the characters were feeling.
Keys to the Demon Prison was an absolutely brilliant end to an amazingly intricate, breathtaking series.
It was the ending that really bugged me.For five books, Brandon Mull has been setting us up for the final battle.
The whole time I was wondering, "How is Bracken fighting with a horn?" "What are the fairies doing?" Etc, etc.
Same thing with Kendra and the Demon King.
A little more struggle would have made much more excititng.I also felt that the romance between Kendra and Braken too sudden.
It felt thrown onto the end, and not woven into the book.
I just wish Brandon Mull had taken a little more time at the end, and not rushed it so much.
