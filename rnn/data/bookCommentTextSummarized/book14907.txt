The thing that strikes me most about her work is that every time there's a new discovery about how paleolithic people lived, it goes along with her stories.
Things they said were silly back when she wrote it (Neanderthals with instruments, Neanderthals living with homo sapiens sapiens, and the like) keep proving true.
She presents interesting ideas of cognition, culture and how societies develop.
The rest remain interesting if you can deal with the constant repetition, soft core porn and the fact that Ayla discovers everything but cold fusion.
Clan of the Cave Bear is an incredible, courageous story.
I know we homo sapiens sapiens don’t have as good memory as Neanderthals but I’m pretty sure your average human doesn’t need to have a piece of information repeated every five pages.
Ms. Auel, are you disrespecting me?We know that Ayla doesn’t remember ever seeing any humans that look like her, only Neanderthals, so it’s obvious she would have body image problems, feel ugly, big, deformed.
It’s implied many times but just in case we don’t understand why a tall, slim, blue-eyed blond girl might feel ugly, Auel explains, repeatedly: "For as long as she could remember, Ayla had never seen anyone except people of the clan.
Omg!! This book was awesome!! I hope I get to read the rest of the series. I might buy them for myself for my B-Day! Yes, there were some parts but there always seem to have those in books I read! Still loved!! Happy Reading! Mel 🖤
Set during prehistoric times, Ayla’s Home and her family are lost to a devastating earthquake.
Homeless and alone she wanders the land, barely surviving, until she is found by Iza - a member of The Clan.
As time progresses The Clan become accustomed to the different girl, and she integrates.
A wonderful selection of characters, I was reminded of the Disney film ‘Brother Bear’ where each Clan member has a spirit totem, in the form of an animal - I was fully engrossed in this world, and look forward to continuing it.
I once read an article from National Geographic in which the author had spent some time living with a Stone Age tribe in Africa.
The people were a studied anachronism, living in modern times, but within a carefully maintained atavistic society of hunting and gathering.
This read like a study of the group, similar to Jared Diamond or Thor Heyerdahl, where she is an omnipresent and omniscient narrator of the life and times of Ayla as she grows up with the clan of Neanderthals, close relatives of humans, but distinct and different.
First and foremost, she has a capacity to create fully alive, three-dimensional characters whom the reader can relate to (positively or negatively) just like real people --Iza, Creb, Brun, Broud, even several of the minor characters; and above all Ayla herself, as we watch her grow from a scared, traumatized child into a strong, highly competent and intelligent woman.
Indeed, she's much too strong, competent and intelligent for some of the Clan to accept in a woman (and judging from critical and reader reactions, some moderns aren't very cool with it either!
:-))That brings up another strong point of the book --Auel's intelligent engaging of serious issues that are still relevant to our lives today.
A family of Cro -Magnons, the first modern humans, our direct ancestors, were wiped out, near a small river, all except a little girl named Ayla , just five, she liked to sneak away and jump joyously into the stream, at dawn, a swimmer before the child could walk.
Maybe because the helpless girl is from a strange, mysterious, new people, Broud, takes an instant, quite insane hatred towards her, they don't resembles them, he thinks , a threat somehow, but for generations haven't been seen, until now, the Others, could compete later, for the scarce food supply, the wild animal herds that constantly roam the lonely steppes, by the cold glaciers from the north, they are always a danger too, and someday will start down again...
I *really* wanted to dig this book. I have a burgeoning obsession with prehistory, evolution, and the antecedents of man, and a tale of Cro Magnons and Neanderthals is exactly what I'd love to read.Sadly, this book does not contain that tale.Instead, it's a goopy mess of inane metaphysics, prurience for prurience's sake, and a none-too-subtle dollop of racism, as the blonde-haired and light-skinned heroine shows the more primitive (and darker-skinned) Neanderthals how to do--well, just about everything.This is a white man's burden fantasy writ large, and not writ very well.
if I don't personally have the ability to prove or disprove a theory (or identify a transmission), I'm just going to sit back, relax and focus on the stories.I love stories.And, since it turned out that my end-of-summer fantasy of having sex with Viggo Mortensen in a cave off of the Mediterranean Sea wasn't going to happen, I started searching for a story that would have an adventurous feel to it.
did I find excellent cave sex in this book of Neanderthals (or primitive man, or whatever in hell these little sloped forehead, hairy pygmies are supposed to be)?Well, does this answer your question?In this primitive society, sex was as natural and unrestrained as sleeping or eating.
Auel The Clan of the Cave Bear is an epic work of prehistoric fiction by Jean M.
The narrative switches to a group of people who call themselves "The Clan" and whom we come to understand are Neanderthal, whose cave was destroyed in the earthquake and who are searching for a new home.

Over the course of the series she invents or discovers (view spoiler)[the spear thrower, basket-weaving, superior weapon-making, the sewing needle, surgical stitching, horseback riding, the bra, the domestication of animals, the travois, the use of flint and pyrite to start a fire, the concept of biological reproduction at a time when pregnancy is believed to be magic, and contraception.
(hide spoiler)]But if you enjoy this, you'll love the second book, where she (view spoiler)[finds her True Stu Love in Jondalar, a sexy angst-bucket of sexiness whose huge penis has always proved too intimidating for his sexual partners until Ayla comes along, at which point the series experiences a 1000% increase in bad caveman porn.
This book and the series that follows is endearing, troublesome, and whole-heartedly compassionate.
This is the book my grandmother read to me as a little girl during the middle of a tornado, while we waited out the storm by candlelight.
This is the book that started me reading...
really reading.
I learned that I can love my quiet time, and apparently I love stories on the ancient human race...
our beginnings.
The ways of survival, ways of development, natural medicine, culture and anthropology.
The flavor of this book is 'tribal', but the sentiment and the moral is, "the totem that chooses you can present many hardships and challenges, but the gifts are worth it."
Is the book factually correct?More to the point: is the book any good?He had a sudden understanding of the gulf between the mind of this girl and his own, and it shook him.The intimacies of clan interaction does have a terrifically epic backdrop in prehistoric (paleolithic) Europe and something that the author conveys quite well is the solitude; you really do get the idea that there are not many people around.
Season follows season; day to day depictions of paleolithic Neanderthal life serving as backdrop for the pissing contest between Ayla and Broud; wash, rinse, repeat.
I loved this book when I was a teen. Indirectly, it lead to my pursuit of a BA in Anthropology. Perhaps it is that Anthropology degree that has rendered the book unreadable for me 25 years later.
Somewhere near the beginning of the book, Auel makes some kind of reference to the size of the Clan members' (Neandertals) heads being related to how much knowledge they can hold.
But later on she states that this is the reason they cannot progress technologically--because their brains, and therefore their skulls, would have to get larger in order to learn new things, and if their heads get too large, childbirth will become impossible.
If this were a fantasy book, the mystical story elements would make more sense.
--All of the Neandertal characters have dark hair, skin and eyes, whereas Ayla is blonde, blue-eyed and fair-skinned.
The idea of gods and Totem animals as guiding factors for life certainly seem plausible as belief systems for societies like this one, and even the rituals and strange occurrences could relate to magic.I really enjoyed the creativity and ingenuity Auel bought to the Clan and their magic, and I feel like it worked really well as a vital part of the story and culture for this world.Honestly, I could go on for quite some time with all the things I completely loved about this book but I think I'll finish by saying it's great and you should read it for yourself.
This was a fantastic book.
I read it in 7th grade, and was absolutely obsessed with it (which is nothing less than stunning, because at that age most books that lacked dragons weren't worth my time...).
In a way its perfect for around that age, because its all about struggling for acceptance and trying to learn the social norms of a society.
The rest of the series isn't nearly as good.
Valley of the Horses is fun but lacking the depth.
I stopped reading them after the third book in the series.
*** 3.65 ***
I read this for the first time years ago and although there's absolutely zero romance at all, not even a hero (that comes in the next book .... Jondalar, be still my beating heart!), sometimes the story is just that good romance doesn't need to feature, this is one of those. I adored this book, and still do after re-reads. A truly amazing, captivating and fascinating series that will stay at the very top of my all time favourites list.Not even 10 stars is enough for this book.
My favorites were Iza and Creb, but I also liked Ayla herself, Brun, and Ooba (sp?).
I liked how Iza embraced Ayla and was thoughtful enough to pass along the medicine woman trade, trying to think of Ayla's future.
I couldn't help but think of me and my sister when I read about the two.The story meanders along Ayla's life, her struggles to become Clan, and her tension with Broud.
Men can beat women and be completely justified--this happens to Ayla quite a few times in the book.
This book was powerful for me. It brought to life a world disappeared by more than 10,000 years. Ayla is such an inspiration and strong woman. I love her dedication to life and to her tribe and to herself. I love that she became a medicine woman. This book is one of a kind.
It was long and maybe just a little too descriptive at times... but incredibly creative. I couldn't put it down. Also, I listened to the audiobook. Narrator was okay, but read a bit fast and with without enough inflection at times... this got better as the story progressed. All in all a fabulous read. Looking forward to book two.
Auel, whose published fiction has been dedicated solely to this Ice Age series.Set in the late Pleistocene Epoch as many as 35,000 years ago and in an area that looks suspiciously like the present day Crimean Peninsula, of all places, The Clan of the Cave Bear begins with a 5-year-old girl named Ayla whose tribe is wiped out in an earthquake while she's off swimming in a stream.
I found the biology of the characters to be unique, a facet lost in the film version with Daryl Hannah, 25 years old and 5'10", cast in the role of Ayla.The major weakness of The Clan of the Cave Bear is Auel's geriatric writing, which is plodding, and tells and tells and tells.

Šiuo metu yra net penkios teorijos, kodėl neandertaliečiai išnyko: a) asimiliavosi su žmonėmis (nes, pasirodo, maišymasis tarp rūsių buvo įmanomas ir didžioji dauguma iš mūsų savo genome nešiojamės apytikriai nuo 1,8 iki 2,6 % iš neandertaliečių kilusių genų);b) mes juos sunaikinome fiziškai;c) ilgą laiką sugyvenome greta ir taikiai, o jie paprasčiausiai išmirė dėl demografinių problemų (konkurencija su protingesniais mumis irgi, aišku, nepadėjo, bet shit happens, čia ne mūsų kaltė);d) dėl kitoniško imuniteto neatlaikė mūsų atneštų bakterijų ir parazitų;e) klimato pokyčiai, dėl kurių neandertaliečiai nesugebėjo prisitiakyti prie laikmečio ir pasikeitusių taisyklių;įdomiausia dalis yra ta, kad faktiškai nėra jokios informacijos, kuri daugiau ar įtikinamiau paremtų kurią nors iš teorijų, tad galima teigti, jog visos jos vienodai tikėtinos, kas rašytojams palieka labai, labai plačią veiksmų ir teorijų laisvę.

Esta es una de esas historias amplias en cuanto a número de personajes, espacios y tiempo.
Nos regala una mirada, aunque ficticia, bastante desarrollada y justificada, de los que pudo ser la vida de nuestros primeros antepasados más directos, siempre a través de una perspectiva familiar y cercana.Ayla, la protagonista, nos ofrece una visión genial de las limitaciones del cerebro de los Neandertales con respecto al suyo propio, más avanzado.
Esta perspectiva nos brinda escenas curiosas como esa en que el mago de la tribu le explica el concepto de número -uno, dos y más de dos-, y ella inmediatamente entiende que está hablando de una serie continua que se prolonga mucho más allá y con la que se pueden hacer operaciones sencillas.
TRUE STORY: reading Clan of the Cave Bear to augment one's understanding of the Upper Paleolithic era is like reading Playboy for the articles. . . .
This was one of the first "grown-up" books I read, along with The Thorn Birds, excluding Harlequins. Honestly, I didn't love it and I didn't read all the sequels, although I remember my friends chatting about it. Meanwhile, I had discovered Victoria Holt and Mary Stewart and Ken Follett and I had plenty to read.
Auel avoids the problem of getting into the complex details of culture by making the novel more about character relationships than an exotic cultural setting.
Still, perhaps if writing action is not her forte, Auel's decision to avoid it could have been a wise one.The character dramas are very well done, and the lack of action does allow more time to appreciate the wondrous natural environment in which Ayla moves, although I still maintain that the best novels contain a little of everything.
