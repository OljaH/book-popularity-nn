Cassandra Clare co-wrote this, so obviously, there are Shadowhunters in it.Where are they? I can't find them.
What's with all the Harry Potter comments? Can authors not write stories about kids and magicians anymore because it's a "rip off" of H. Potter?
Callum Hunt does not want to be a magician.
All his life, his father has warned him about the dangers of magic, and the sinister ways of the mages who teach youngsters to use their powers in the underground world of the Magisterium.
When Callum comes of age and must take his entrance exam for the Magisterium, he tries his hardest to fail.
He is chosen to train with Master Rufus, the most prestigious mage in the Magisterium.
Callum doesn’t want to be a magician.
He wants to fail at magic.
Will Callum ever be allowed to leave his new home?I liked Call a lot.
Wow. This seems like yet another total ripoff of Harry Potter. And look at that cover. Three kids, two boys and a girl, going to a school of magic, with a death eater death eater in the background...
If Cassandra Clare wants to write books about shadowhunters or magic, it doesn't even freaking matter it's her choice on what she wants to write, and wait-you don't like it?
SERIOUSLY PEOPLE, STOP.
Do you even know HOW many books have been written on magic?
Harry Potter was the most successful fiction book on magic, but do you know how many others there are?
I GET THAT YOU MIGHT NOT LIKE IT, BUT I DON'T GET WHY YOU'RE HATING ON HER NEXT SERIES WHEN YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW IT MIGHT TURN OUT.
A pre-review in Disney Gifs Initial Impression:First 50 pages:All the Harry Potter similarities:Worldbuilding + Magic system:The plot:The very obvious "plot twist":The convenient info-dumpings: Conclusion:Basically:
You're all thinking it. No one wants to say it, but we're all thinking it. *sigh* Okay fine, i'll say it.J.K Rowling to Cassandra Clare:Well, at least this one isn't about Shadowhunters.
I really wanted to love this. Really wanted. ‘‘The Enemy was a great mage – maybe even the best – but he went crazy. He wanted to live forever and make the dead live again. That’s why they called him the Enemy of Death, because he tried to conquer death. He started pulling chaos into the world, putting the power of the void into animals…and even people.’’ Sigh.I’m thinking that this reminds me very much of someone in the Harry Potter series. You must be annoyed of seeing this being so much compa
I have actually no idea what Cassandra Clare and Holly Black are thinking about their work, themselves, but I wonder how they did to NOT see (or perhaps they just didn’t care?) the ‘that-belongs-to-the-Harry-Potter-series’ elements.The beginning, I actually enjoyed.
‘‘You’re closer to the element – like you’re doing magic, you eat rocks or sand, fire mages can eat matches, air mages might consume blood for its oxygen.’’
I was expecting something different and wanted this to feel like a true fantasy book.As much as I love witches, magic, wizards and boarding schools, those elements in the story weren’t, surprisingly, enough to make me enjoy the plot.
I'm not one to roll my eyes at similar storylines - I don't curse all MG novels about magic school for being Harry Potter rip-offs, but there are only so many similarities I can tolerate.So let's see, we have this kid, Call, who was marked at birth by the most evil of its kind - someone corrupted by his desire to become immortal (called the Enemy of Death but I call him Ed, sounds much more ominous don't you think?).
How they find students for the Iron Trial had me a bit confused, especially as it said some kids don't even know themselves they have magical abilities.
Why does the blurb read like a Harry Potter re-mix?
How is it even possible I didn't know about this?!!!I mean seriously? A series written by two of my favourite authors? AND I JUST DIDN'T KNOW?!WTH?! There's no way I'm not going to add this to my to-be read pile.Which unfortunately leaves me with 300 books, which also means that the limit I set for myself is thoroughly broken, which means I need to READ the hell out of my to-be read,which means I'm basically screwed! *lol*BUTHolly Black and Cassandra Clare!!! Jeez!!! I'm doomed! <333
This book was super fun, has an awesome magic system, and just sets up the rest of the series so nicely! I am so excited to see where this all goes!More thoughts coming soon in video form! :)
I’m going to try and regurgitate (lovely word) this whole subjective experience in the most objective manner possible. I’ve heard a lot of this going around:   "I won’t read this because it’s just a repacked Harry Potter."   Sorry to break it to you, but most likely, those that will gravitate the most to this book are those curious enough to see this attempt at a magical school. After the phenomenon that was Harry Potter, one that transcended a series initially aimed at children into a universa
After the phenomenon that was Harry Potter, one that transcended a series initially aimed at children into a universal experience, the magical school concept has been set aside into an exclusive league of it’s own.
As though I was a middle grade child, woefully ignorant of the pleasures of the magical world of Harry PotterAnd so I have three separate outcomes to this review (three because you’ve got to keep in mind the invisible mindset: I don’t read middle grade fiction—exceptions for the glorious Ms. Clare).
And you can most certainly can compare any magical fiction to Harry Potter, really without trying at all.
And we all thought Cassie was going to try something new.
I thoroughly enjoyed this book! I'm interested to see where the series goes. :)
Cassandra Clare (and Holly Black, though her influence is basically invisible) wrote a book about a kid going to magic school.
Look at the cover, and try to tell me that the villain doesn't look like a Death Eater from the movies (fun fact: (view spoiler)[as it turns out, that's exactly what he is, too) (hide spoiler)].
There could have been a few redeemable things about the book (Aaron <3), but by the end, the terrible twists, the plagiarism, and the fucking use of fake accusations of abuse as a villain's ploy bothered me way too much.
Even though The Iron Trial is the first book and focuses on the world building and its history, there is still a lot undiscovered and I would love to read more about it.The only thing that fell a bit short and so caused the four stars instead of the five, was the plot and pace in general.
I didn't feel like there was much plot present in this book because of the constant amount of world building and character development.
We wanted to build a fun world, characters we loved, and as many twists and surprises as we could come up with.
Sadly I hadn't seen the kids in The Iron Trial did the same.I know, at least this book actually includes POC (people of colors) as the main characters, this much I can appreciate, but still.(3) the Mages-teachers who are stupid and horrible educators In this book, the mages in this magical school are terrible as educators and these mages also suck totally at fighting the evil Chaos-ridden too.
Very solid start to a series. I feel like there were some things that were under-explained, but overall I love the world!
Can't wait to read it!
I haven't read a Harry Potter book for what?
I missed magic ♥I can actually imagine Cassie writing this,all happy and excited because she began her career writing HP fan-fiction,so this book is like a dream come true to her.
xD I love Cassie,and i'm really pissed of with all the hate.
I don't know Holly Black,but i want to.
After reading this one,reading her books is a 'MUST'.
So about the book.
The fact that it was like Harry Potter made it really familiar,it was like i knew it,it felt home.
Lovely book.
Stop the hate.
The Iron Trial also isn't the same recycled plot line we have seen with books trying to be the next Percy Jackson or Harry Potter.
My four-star rating instead of a five is simply because this book had a lot of information dropped on us.
We had to learn our characters and the world, so I can only imagine how much better the next books in the series will be.
We are really getting a feel for the school and the characters, learning the world.
I will definitely need to pick up more of Holly Black's books once I'm all caught up on this.
I’m late to the party. But two fantastic authors co-wrote this? I’m reading it. 🤑 Hope to like it.
REVIEW: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-WWG...3.5*It was entertaining enough and I will probably continue with the seriesIt felt like more of a 5 star book at the end, but since the first 200 pages were lacking, I'm sticking with a 3.5
I haven't had that much fun reading a book in a very long time, fantastic!

Es mas un 3.5 que un 3El ritmo del libro es muy lento para mi gusto, esperaba mucha más acción y más magia, pero al igual que los personajes principales, me aburrí con el Magisterium las primeras 240 páginas, lo que es mucho teniendo en cuenta que el libro tiene 300.Qué salvo el libro? Los giros en la trama, los descubrimientos y la acción de las últimas escenas, es como si una autora escribiera la primera parte y la otra la segunda, el ritmo y las escenas cambian rotundamente.

4.5This was really entertaining, if not somewhat derivative. I've got a lot too say about this one so I'll be uploading a book talk about it!
Predictable, unoriginal, boring. Absolutely boring.

Actual rating: 3.6 ⭐️Story ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️All his life Calls father told him how bad the Magisterium was.
So when the day came to get into the Magisterium, Call tried really hard to fail.
But he still got a place in the strongest team of the Magisterium and begins to learn how to control magic.
But with time he got smarter and I started liking him.
Even if I really liked the whole school concept with the different stones, I’m still confused about some of the other world building.
Relationships ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️I adored the friendship the three of them build.
