No, it's going to be used solely to transport beautiful women back in time to the Highlands to experience a whirlwind romance.Get in line, ladies...And please note to any future Highland authors out there - Kilts were not invented in Scotland until 1725 and specific clan quilts weren't invented until the 19th century.
Circenn is no Barrons and whilst Lisa, who starts off making me roll my eyes, is no Mac, she is a reasonable female protagonist.What saves this novel is it's interesting conceptualization of the time-honoured Highlander/Timetravel formula, mixed in with a strong, beautiful romance.
As in, this book will have you Moning.The woman knows how to write sex.
Circenn and Lisa's story - Circenn is a half-human, half-fae man living in the 14th century.
He is also immortal thanks to Adam Black slipping the magic Fae liquid that makes humans immortal into his drink when he was in his 30's.
He doesn't realize that his curse will also bring back whoever touches the flask....Enter Lisa, who is working her night time shift in a museum as a cleaner.
Her curiosity drives her to touch the flask and the next thing she knows she is in a bath with a naked Circenn in the 14th century.
"If one looks down the timeline, one can discern which things are irrevocable and should not be manipulated, and which things will make little difference." That said, I must admit to being slighlty annoyed with (view spoiler)[Circenn changing five years of Lisa's life in order to make everything - and I mean, everything - right and perfect for her.
(hide spoiler)] Anyway, if that was to prove how much Circenn loved Lisa, it was fine by me.
:)Despite all its "flaws", I loved this book and will definitely read the rest of the series!Random thought: I'm a bit curious about Duncan Douglas, one of the secondary characters.
Circenn is immortal in Scotland and he really hates it.
He hates seeing people he loves, wives, favourite pets dying around him for the past 500 years.
A little of magic and she ends up in old Scotland while Circenn has already taken an oath to kill her.
Of course they fall in love.In this book Adam Black is manipulating people's lives again and there is a huge revelation about him towards the end that it will make you go back and reread the parts of the book which included him.
Posted on Under the CoversIf a cursed flask holding an immortal elixir is what it takes to travel back in time to find a Highlander hottie like Circenn, then I’m getting my butt on the next train to the museum!Lisa Stone is twenty-three years old.
Little does Lisa know that the ancient flask before her is cursed to be returned to its owner once it is found.
With this time-travel romance, Lisa must choose to either go back to the twenty-first century to care for her mother or remain in medieval Scotland to be with Circenn.
The question is, what can’t she live without?
The Highlander’s Touch is the third book in Karen Marie Moning’s Highlander series and once again we’re back with a heavy time travel influence.
But this time, whether because I’m getting used to it or perhaps it was better written, the time travel didn’t bother me as much as it did in Beyond the Highland Mist and other time travel books I’ve read.
I really do hope it’s just me becoming more comfortable with the theme, because it seems I’m missing out on a lot of great Highlander tales.I thought this story was pretty good, and I found myself laughing out loud a few times.
Since I was thinking about bad books, I remembered I read this at the beginning of the year and forgot to add it to my read folder. The book feels like a writing exercise in preparation for the Fever series (which I loved). Yeah, she can write a sex scene but that's about it. Not recommended.
*Shrug* Sure,I guess.If you're in a mood for a pure highlander read with a pleasant enough plot.This series in Ratings  so far: #1 Beyond the Highland Mist - 5 Stars !

Karen seni aşırı seviyorum❤ Klişe bir konuyu alıp böyle muhteşem yapabilmesi inanılmaz bir şey. Ve bir şekilde bunu Ateş serisine bağlamış olması da mutlu etmedi değil🤗 Circenn aşırı ateşliydi. İskoçlara bir zaafım olduğunu hep söylemişimdir ama bu adam bir başkaydı ya❤

3 to 3 1/2 starsI'm glad I read this series out of order (these books can be read out of order).
Personally, I don't think the series was particularly engrossing until after the third book.
Books four, five, and six are my favorite, with book six, The Immortal Highlander, my favorite of the series.
You must, however, read books four, five, six, and seven in order.
I recommend reading the series in this order: Kiss of the Highlander (#4),The Dark Highlander (#5),The Immortal Highlander (#6), Spell of the Highlander (#7), The Highlander Touch (#3), Beyond the Highland Mist (#1), To Tame a Highland Warrior (#2)
I was going to write a review, but Im just completely blank. I will however say what I deem important to say - This book was awesome. Circeen had a manclub the size of an elephant. Lisa was horny all the time. They could freakishly read each others minds - a talent I wouldnt mind having with my husband. The story was funny. The story was great. A happily ever after with trimmings on top!

The romance felt more real than in the first 2 books, and I much prefer
(view spoiler)[Yes (hide spoiler)]
Although this one had a more realistic historical feel to it.And again, as with book 1, sometimes things are mentioned that seem like they will have an impact on the story, yet nothing comes of it.
And there was a bit with Circenn's friends Galan and particularly Duncan, when it seemed like they were being set up for a romance to happen in this book, or a future book but having looked, there seems to be nothing for them.
So again, a scene with Duncan and and "intriguing" woman, that leads nowhere.But overall, a much more enjoyable story than book 1 and 2, with characters I like much more.
For an entertaining and comprehensive diatribe on this book, please read Zosia's review.
She touches it and is transported back in time to the 14th century where she meets a very naked Scottish warrior.Sounds great doesn't it?
Well it is yet another fun summer read.
Add in a little fae mischief and we have a great way to spend the time waiting for Shadowfever to be published.All kidding aside, I really did enjoy this novel.
It was a beautiful romance with some very hot love scenes.
I loved the psychic connection between Lisa and Circenn.
And the ending was beautiful...heavy sigh....A great summer read.
Going to read Kiss of the Highlander now.
A Highlander series where so far only one guy is immortal.I'll admit it wasn't bad in the beginning, but close to the end is where it took a turn for the, not worse, but totally and completely ridiculous.I tell you, I practically saw it coming and had to speed read because I couldn't believe she actually tied it up in such a way.
It's like that is the formula for a happily ever after and without it you may as well end the world now.But while Karen Marie Moning can write the romance aspect very well, her stories have plot holes so big I'm surprised I didn't fall into one.
karen hala seni seviyorum!okuyun, okutun.
Pero menos mal que en este vuelve a sus orígenes, a la línea que comenzó con la Nieblas de las Highlands, los viajes en el tiempo, la fantasía, las faes, y a Adam Black y eso me gusto, pero la traducción ha sido tan penosa que no le podido dar más puntuación.
La trama no estuvo mal, pero lo que más me gusto fue el giro que da al final, fue la parte más divertida y esa pareja formada por Cin y Adam me encanto, pero ese final, WAF quiero saber más y me voy a poner a leer el siguiente ya.
Book 3 in Moning's Highlander series is better than 1 and 2 but still lacks some oomph.
Circenn Brodie (great name!) is one sexy Highlander!
That's gigantic even if he is an immortal!Lisa, the heroine, is a bit drab and some of the things she says or does reminded me a toddler stamping their feet in frustration.
A bit too quick I thought.
Circenn is what keeps this book afloat.
The steamy-scenes missed the mark each time--almost there but just out of reach of being really good.
A bit of a twist on the time travel romance.
Good, but not as wonderful as the next book in this series. That one is swoon worthy. I really want Adam Black's book now. I know his story is going to be fun.
LAAAAANNNNNBen de XIV. yüzyıla gitmek istiyorummmmm 😭
Circenn makes his known but Lisa is still torn between being with someone she thinks she is falling for or feeling bad about her mom and trying to find a way home.
(view spoiler)[ I wanted to read a little, maybe in the Epilogue, about them sharing there feelings while she was pregnant, or while she was having the baby.
I would actually, maybe this is horrible of me, but I really wanted to read about how he felt about the amount of pain she was in while having their baby.
(hide spoiler)]Overall, I really liked this book, besides the disappointing ending.
Working as a night cleaning lady at a museum curiosity gets the better of her and opens pandora's box aka cursed object that send her RIGHT TO 14th century -> to Cin -> during bath time.For a hardcore warrior Cin is an amazingly patient man who courts and woos (very seductively) Lisa, as she adjust to the idea of her new reality and at the same time grieving for her mother.I really enjoyed appearance of grand-grand-grand parents of some of our beloved (and not so beloved) characters from books 1 & 2.
Favorite Word:  TUPPING  Favorite Quote:  "Feelings, emotions—they are neither right nor wrong.
There were a lot of things to like about this book.Circenn and his insistence on following a few basic rules - until he meets Lisa and starts breaking his own rules one by one.
Circenn and his love for his family and his people.
Circenn and his old-fashioned morals and gentleness.
Circenn and his desire to make Lisa happy.
Circenn and...I found it very easy to empathize with Lisa and her problems in the present time, and to respect her because she put aside her dreams to work menial jobs and care for her mother.
No ha estado mal este libro aunque leerlo de una traduccion hace que pierda mucho la historia... en este libro el protagonismo absoluto se lo lleva Cin, por sus pensamientos, sus reglas y su oscuro pasado... ella se deja llevar y no he sentido en ningun momento que este a la altura de Cin.... Estoy deseando leer el libro de Adam jejeje...No es de las mejoreas sagas de Karen Marie Moning pero se deja leer y cambio de registro!
You know, you never forget your first one.But what's not to like about this story, really?It's set in Scottish Highlands (my favorite setting of them all; I've actually visited both castles mentioned in this story—Dunnottar and Brodie!), it features, albeit briefly, the battle at Bannock Burn (providing one of the best quotes in this book*), it's filled with wonderful supporting cast (the Douglas Brothers, the surprise appearance of Robert the Bruce in all his matchmaking glory...), and has one hell of a leading man.Circenn Brodie, the ninth-century warrior living in the fourteenth-century war-torn Scotland, falling in love with a twenty-first century woman.
4 stars Re-listen
I have enjoyed each of her books in the series so far, especially since I love anything romances to do with the Scottish Highlands.
One of the things I didn't expect when I first started reading this one, was how emotional this book would become for the reader, from beginning to end the plot was filled with excitement, adventure and lots of romance.
This time around we are dealing with Circenn Brody and Lisa.
Circenn is the keeper and guard of the fae's important relics and documents.
Lisa is at the museum when she over hears two men talking about a important artifact.
Whoever holds the relic will be imported to Circenn to be "taken care of."Circenn doesn't realize just how hard it will be to go through with his deal when Lisa shows up in his chambers.
I love the chemistry between Circenn and Lisa.
It came in at around a two to three stat rating, which is a pity as the hero is rather scrumptious.But there are just too many continuity flaws in the plot and I don't mean as in relates to the time travel stuff!!
Lisa booby-traps the floor of the room with shards of pottery, Circenn cuts himself on a couple, next thing they're rolling around on the floor with nary another scratch.
Yes, I know I'm being picky but little things like that really annoy me sometimes.
At times the book gets me in so well that I forget the little stuff, this one didn't get there.
Great, now I've forgotten the other little things that seemed out of line.
Because you sure can't tell by her actions.
Bonus points if even a kindergartner could tell it's a boneheaded move.Third, no one in the 14th century should have been able to understand two thirds of what came out of her mouth.
Yet they magically understand it all and can respond with 20th century slang.Fourth, Moning constantly repeats that the characters are in love with each other but never actually shows it.
It's just her repeatedly writing that their in love with no actions from the characters to really back it up.Other than Lisa's love of Circenn's giant cock.
She shows that plenty...
