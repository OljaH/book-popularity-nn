The novel follows the story of the rise and fall of a rock and blues band of Spokane Indians from the Spokane Reservation.
The three boys start a rock and blues band in Spokane using Johnson's enchanted guitar.تاریخ نخستین خوانش: روز سیزدهم از ماه اکتبر در سال 2016 میلادیعنوان: آوازهای غمگین اردوگاه ؛ نویسنده: شرمن الکسی؛ مترجم: سعید توانایی؛ تهران، روزنه، 1394؛ در 360 ص؛ شابک: 9789643345051؛ موضوع: داستانهای نویسندگان امریکایی - سده 21 مبسیار خواندنی ست در آستین هر پاراگراف، قصه ای و شعری سروده است.
“They dreamed of fishing salmon but woke up as adults to shop at the Trading Post and stand in line for U.S.D.A. commodity food instead.
They savagely opened cans of commodities and wept over the rancid meat.”I was first introduced to these characters when I saw the movie Smoke Signals, which was originally a book (that I didn’t read).
I liked the movie, in part because I think the actor Adam Beach is yummy.
In this book, Thomas is given an enchanted guitar and forms a band with Victor and Junior.
I don't know what I was expecting when I picked this up.
Upon moving to Seattle and finding out that he was a local, I picked this up at a used book store, figuring I'd give it a read.
I did not expect Thomas-builds-the-fire to get under my skin and change my life.
"Reservation Blues" made me realize that I may never fully understand, but gave me new eyes to help me at least see.Truly one of the best novels I've ever read - perhaps because it was the perfect time of my life to read it, perhaps for other reasons.
یک کتاب بسیار عالی! میگن رعالیسم جادوییه، ولی خب من که نمیدونم ینی چی.داستان درمورد یه عده سرخپوسته که بند موسیقی میزنن. اما شیوه بیان و اتفاقایی که میفته واقن نظیر نداره. مثلن یه صحنه داریم کهگیتاره با طرف یهو دیالوگ میگه. و ازین قبیل بامزه بازی ها. که خب مثال نمیزنم دیگه ازشون چون مزهش میره. اما واقعن روون و شیرین و جذابه و زمین گذاشتنش بسی سخت. اگه دنبال کتابی هستین که اسون خونده بشه، دنبال خودش بکشتون، و یخورده هم تمای فلسفی یا عمیق پس داستانش داشته باشه، این یک گزینه عالی خواهد بود!

This is some very American magical realism, what with its mash-up of the Robert Johnson crossroads legend with life on a Spokane Indian reservation and rock star ambitions.
Perhaps even more American than apple pie?!??As a concept, I love American magical realism (see also: Swamplandia!, which coincidentally is about people who like to pretend they're Indian).
Robert Johnson selling his soul to the devil for his guitar skill (a blues legend which is taken for truth in the book) runs parallel to Thomas & Friends' quest to become rock stars, using the same guitar, ultimately hoping to escape the poverty of the reservation.
ازون کتابایی که کلی نوستالژی و کنایههای ناب رو زنده میکنن. خیلی کتاب زندهای بود و نویسنده اطلاعات فوقالعادهای در زمینه فرهنگ عامه و سرخپوستا و موسیقی و هنر داشت.

لذتبخش و تأمل برانگیز.
If reading Sherman Alexie’s The Lone Ranger and Tonto Fistfight in Heaven is like running alongside a longhouse with 24 windows, getting 24 glimpses or mental snapshots of life inside, Reservation Blues is like being invited in and offered a can of Pepsi, a hot piece of fry bread and a place to crash.
In Reservation Blues you’re living on the reservation; tempted to turn away from particularly painful moments and compelled to stand solemnly when “characters” you’ve come to care for fall beside you.
In the terminology of white American history, Reservation Blues is a Tall Tale with larger-than-life everything .
Having Robert Johnson suddenly appear on a reservation to get rid of his possessed guitar, given to him by that gentleman, and seek redemption is brilliant.
The guitar changes hands and creates problems, more than they already had, for the Indians that use it as a way off of the reservation.
Three young Indian men take possession of Johnson's guitar and it takes control of them, or does it just accentuate the problems they faced every day.
The inner conflicts they face daily, the problems with relationships between the men and women they encounter in their lives, including within their own families are enough to overpower a weaker people.
I love how he touches on the irony of a situation that drives it deep into the loneliest part of your being instead of just staying cliched and clever on the surface.I love how Alexie weaves between various stories seamlessly and how the mythology and the reality of Native Americans blurs hazily together.
I also love how Alexie always ties the present into the historical.
In this book, a lot of the horror of the Native American genocide is relived through characters' dreams.
How do we live our lives informed by it but not chained by it?The movie "Smoke Signals" by Chris Eyre is based off of this book loosely.
I actually found this book along with many others in a trash pile on my way to work.
Anyway, I read the book, which was about a group of Indians on a reservation in Washington (I think most of his writing revolves around similar characters) who end up starting a rock band.
(There's a lot more to it than this, but I don't feel like explaining.) There were some good characters in the book and I liked how Alexie wove Native American folklore into the story.
But I didn't think it was as strong as the story I heard on the radio.

A treasure of a book!
At first, I was disappointed in myself because I could not, did not, will not finish this book.
I mean, I need to read this; it's this month's pick for the book club I'm in.
Speaking of which, Alexie's other YA novel Flight made me cry out loud.
As I tried to get into the story and failed, I felt awful knowing I was not going to finish the book.
I'm a lazy reader (my niece has told me so and she's right).But then I started to get mad at Alexie.
I won't be finishing RB although I may pick up another book by ol' Sherman in the future.
Surely, I thought, this is not the kind of writing that gave Alexie his literary stature?I picked up "Reservation Blues" because a few of my students were reading it for an English class, and I liked the idea of being able to discuss it in our adviser meetings.
The idea of Robert Johnson showing up in the modern world, still carrying his guitar, kicked my ass and got me excited for something weird and different.Johnson ends up taking a back seat early on in the story, leaving the stage open for a handful of characters who put a band together and start playing gigs on their reservation.
But the whole story is not just this.
Stories that are filled with magic.
Stories that have happened in the 19th century and stories that have happened yesterday.I could feel the magic everywhere.
I could hear the music they played.
I could hear all the notes that big mom sang.
And I mourned for their loss.In a world of cruel realities a little bit of magic has to be cherished.
I cherished all those little moments of magic that I felt while reading this book.
Read it not just for the stories.
Read it because of the magic.
Years after reading it I still remember the book and its characters.
I’m hopin’ Big Mom can get it back"I'd like to write a linear review of Sherman Alexie's Reservation Blues, but the story is only part of the story and a linear summary would miss it.
Thomas Builds-the-Fire’s stories – and Alexie's – climb into your clothes like sand, [and] gave you itches that could not be scratched.Reservation Blues is in the style of reservation realism: both larger than life events – meeting the long-dead including Robert Johnson, working with the magical Big Mom – and realistic emotions.
The music howled back into the blue van, kept howling until Coyote Springs became echoes.
Reservation Blues begins with the tortured soul of a musician, and his guitar.
The blues musician, a reanimated form of the late Robert Johnson, hands his enchanted instrument to Thomas Builds the Fire.
The bitterness and well as the resent I imagine that Native Americans feel, is well represented in this book through their disdain for their government distributed foods.
As I musician, I felt closely related to Robert Johnson.
As well, Reservation Blues gave the reader insight into the lives of modern day Native Americans.
This image is not only cliché, but its out dated and inaccurate of the average Native American.
Any book that starts out with Robert Johnson mysteriously appearing at the Spokane Indian Reservation decades after his death and handing off his enchanted guitar with its devil-dealed skills ready to transfer to its next caretaker is all right with me.
The local youth starts a band called Coyote Springs and head off on a musical and self discovery adventure that is quite fascinating and heartfelt.
there was also an enormous sadness built in throughout and a fascinating encounter with Cavalry Records in NYC which was quite heavy and quite brilliant as the cruel and exploitative music business was written in to help display a much bigger story than the average rise and fall story of an American rock band.
Thomas-Builds-a-Fire is one of the greatest characters in 20th century literature.
Stronger than Alexie’s debut collection, RESERVATION BLUES explores similar territory with an even greater scope as he takes his compelling, hilarious, and tragic characters (Thomas-Builds-a-Fire, Victor, and Junior) off of the reservation while also bringing outsiders onto it.
Overall, this novel should be the one people suggest when recommending Alexie to those who prefer novels (THE LONE RANGER AND TONTO FISTFIGHT IN HEAVEN is a great book but might not be as cohesive for people who already bristle at short stories, even though there’s plenty of character overlap).

The devil tuned his guitar for him and Johnson became a great player.Keying off this opening scene, Alexie develops a story in which Johnson gives Thomas his magical guitar, who gives it to his friend Victor, a drunken lout who suddenly, though intermittently, becomes able to play fantastic blues.
It’s what made the last line of the song, Reservation Blues, echo for me: “And if you ain’t got choices, Ain’t got much to lose.”I also asked him about the lack of ambition that seems to inhabit reservation culture and Indian life, as portrayed.
I might have expected a bit more humor, but otherwise it wasn’t off in any way.I think the book surfaces a lot of issues concerning Native Americans (and American culture) that I liked more than the plot line itself.
What emerges is a fairly believable story with a few mystical tweaks (the lovely inclusion of Robert Johnson, the crossroads demon, and a strong Native American mother figure) that easily embodies the lived experience of a specific class of often-overlooked Americans.While I didn’t particularly love the book, I’m glad I read it, and I’m likely to pick up more of Alexie’s work.
There's magic in this book.
An older magic, and a sadder one, probably because it's all true.
I picked up Reservation Blues from the library because it was being displayed as a prominent book in Banned Book week.
When I read the premise, that of famous blues musician Robert Johnson (who supposedly sold his soul to the Devil at the crossroads to become the best guitar player ever), wandering on to a Spokane reservation and giving Thomas Builds-the-Fire his guitar, I was hooked.
An honest, heartbreaking look at life on a reservation.
One of my favorite reads this year.
از طنز تلخ کتاب های شرمن الکسی، فقط تلخی ش را داشت.
پر از آه و ناله بود داستان فقط.
که چقدر سرخ پوست ها بدبخت اند و به ما ظلم شده و از این صحیت که خوب البته درست است و در کتاب های دیگرش هم بود ولی نه به این صورت.
بد بختی در این کتاب موج می زد.
اصلا داستان یک سری بدبخت بود که بین مردمِ بدبختی مانند خودشان زندگی می کردند.
(حالا نه به این غلظت.)ترجمه خیلی بد بود.
ولی به این بدی نبود...
Sweet, sad, and satirical portrayal of life on a Spokane Indian reservation and attempts by a group of young men to break free by forming a blues-rock group.
Good balance of a vivid and dramatic story interwoven with myths, legend, dreams, and whimsy.
Elucidates the paradox of the white society seeming to value Indians for their spirituality and respect for nature while holding negative and inaccurate stereotypes.
Alexie is sympathetic to whole cast of characters he populates this book with and affirms well the power of forgiveness and love as a source of hope for change and preservation of a community in the face of change.�
This story meanders a lot, which takes away from its effectiveness, IMO. That said, it's still a heart-tugging work that really digs into the pain of life on the reservation without presenting any easy solutions.
Thomas Builds-the-Fire is a young man with a talent for telling stories and writing poems and song lyrics, living on a Spokane reservation.
It turns out to be the famed guitar player, Robert Johnson.
Later, Thomas discovers that Johnson has left his guitar behind, and that's when the adventures begin.
The guitar is magical, almost playing on its own and turning anyone who picks it up into a prodigy.
At this point the story focuses on the band's short but rapid rise to semi-fame as an Indian band.
