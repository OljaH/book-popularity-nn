dana has been bugging me to write a review of this for the longest time, and now that she is on vacation and out of my path for ten minutes (seriously - the girl moved to my town just so she could stand under my window all night calling "hey!!
middlebrow..." (david, i am using your voice here to recreate, i hope you don't mind)not that there's anything wrong with "middlebrow", especially coming from a lady like this who proved that she had no idea what a 17-year-old reluctant reader would be pleased to get as a gift and instead was imposing her own values on this poor girl.(shame, shame) hey, kid - hope you enjoy the journals of john evelyn!!
I want to be buried with all these three novels.
So, you may know it's a Modern Victorian novel, which is a mini-genre I love & want more of, and you may also have heard that in this particular Modern Victorian lesbians are somehow involved.
It is true, but what is more to the point is that a completely enthralling love story is portrayed, which happens to be between two women.
It’s not like Waters is serving up any profound insights into human nature or casting her eye over a wide panorama of human life.
It’s essentially a novel that traffics in pastiche (plagiarism?) and is built on two startling plot twists (and as such tailor made for the screen).
Whenever a character is in the grip of an emotion it’s like an entire orchestra strikes up operatic music.
The plot of this novel straitjackets all the characters.
On a good note it did make me again appreciate the brilliance of Dickens who could do great plot twists without sacrificing character development.
This is a Victorian murder mystery with a lesbian romance. You will probably love it, but even if you don't, it's highly unlikely you will have read anything else quite like it.
As for “pearl,” you might imagine those shiny white things cast among swine, or, if you know Sarah Waters and her reputation for lesbian love stories, you might picture lustrous riches in more carnal terms.
To be honest, it became a distraction.As for the palpability, you expect that from Victorian England, right?
I give Waters credit for making me think about surface relations, hidden agendas, and more visceral matters of the human heart.I suspect anyone who has read both this book as well as The Crimson Petal and the White is constitutionally incapable of avoiding comparison.
It seems that Fingersmith is one of those books that people want to read but are not doing it for some reason.
Gentleman secured a temporary job with the uncle and the plan is for Sue to become Maud’s maid, help the thief seduce the young woman into marriage and after the fortune was secured to lock her in a mental hospital.
There is a bit of Dickens feel to this novel which drawn me even more into the adventures of the two young women.
After reading this book I feel once again grateful that I live in this era and in a country where women have equal rights.
It’s not a bad book, but nowhere near as rich or enjoyable as I'd hoped.Literary NodsI noticed quite a few echoes of classics, and I liked all but one of these little homages.
A young woman living in a large lonely house with an uncle who spends most of his time in the library; uncle’s dodgy friends; enticed away by her drawing teacher; the wrong woman locked in an asylum in an attempt to gain a legacy; Marian/Marianne; some big coincidences… (hide spoiler)]Plenty of authors have successfully based their work on a well-loved tale, so I’m not sure why I had such a problem with this one.
What a read!
I felt like Alice falling down the Rabbit Hole.
It's like throwing out the time old question of, "Who are you, REALLY?" Be prepared for some crazy zapped answers to that one."We have a name for your disease.
You have been encouraged to over-indulge yourself in literature; and have inflamed your organs of fancy.
You have read too much."Such was told to women of the day.
That quote from the book left me laughing with my head fully tilted back and thinking, dear reader, how you and I would be locked up for sure from mega hours and years of "taking to the literature".
I have to admit that throughout almost all of Fingersmith the main random thoughts sweeping across the desolate land of my mind were along the lines of: WTF?
So while some parts where breath-taking and put me in a frenzy (I swear I was tachycardic), some other parts kind of put me in a stupor (while monsoons where still blowing my mind and I was trying to figure out what could possibly happen next.)All in all a great read but not for the faint of heart.

I said no, that I had just been reading Fingersmith and I was really stressed out because now I had to leave the house and didn't know what was going to happen next.
And that is basically how this book took over my life (in a good way).Sue is an orphan who lives in London in a house of petty thieves.
When I had to leave the house I took it with me, hoping that I might get a moment to read a little further.
The con, we learn, is not what we thought it was, and then, in the next section, we get to read the same scenes again - but from Maud's perspective this time.
So if you liked the movie, please go read the book, because there are some major, major bombshells that you still need to know about.
As seen on The ReadventurerFingersmith packs quite a few twists and surprises.At first, after reading the book's plot summary, I expected it to be a rompish, Les Liaisons Dangereuses-like adventure.
I haven't read much Dickens to enter a flowery comparison here, but Waters' prose is very much on par with the best 19th century writers, only slightly more explicit and touching on the subject hushed out in the mainstream fiction of that era (I am talking porn and reprehensible way of treating wealthy women behind closed doors and in houses for crazies).
Susan turns 17 and Gentlemen has come up with the con to end all cons-- taking advantage of the niece of a wealthy man up in the country.
That's the premise and that's all I'm saying about the plot because the execution left me hanging onto every single printed word.This book has been hailed as a modern Dickensian novel, and I savored every long chapter Ms. Waters presented.
Broken down into three parts- the author takes her time weaving a solid storyline with fleshed out characters and just as she manages to sell her story, she pulls the rug right out from underneath the reader.
Reread December 2016 after seeing THE HANDMAIDEN. -------------A superbly written novel, full of great twists and turns. You may be able to guess some of what's going on, but the author will still surprise you with daring prose and unexpected red herrings. If you've never read the author before (as I had not) I'd recommend not reading ANY reviews about the book, not even the Amazon general description. The book jacket and this http://orangeprizeproject.blogspot.co... should whet your appetite enough. Trust in the author to do the rest.
I mean, Victorian mystery + thieves and cons + lesbian heroines + um, you know, that, um, twist =Yes, this ⤴ does mean I almost nearly enjoyed the beginning of the story.Part II was pretty good at first, but then it all started getting somewhat sort of moderately boring after Spoiler Spoiler Spoiler (not the character’s real name) did spoiler spoiler spoiler and ended up being spoilered spoilered spoilered in spoiler spoiler spoiler (I have a special talent for faithful–and not too revealing–plot recaps, I know).
Anyway, so the not unexpected twist ♫twisted things again♫ (view spoiler)[yeah, that was pretty lame, I know.
And, damn, this thing is nearly 600 pages or 23 hrs if you're listening to the audiobook.On the final line of the last page I felt like I emerged from a bunker since sinister doom was around the corner at every turn.What saves it, though, is that the book is brilliant and well-crafted.
Sarah Waters enjoys putting her readers in this pickle just as much as her characters.As the story unfolded I kept going along thinking "This can't happen.
As it is, I at least got a sigh of relief in the end which made the ordeal worthwhile.For the read, I did listen to the audiobook version which was narrated by Juanita McMahon and she was absolutely fantastic throughout.
Waters has clearly steeped herself in Victorian literature, and on one level this is a classic Victorian potboiler full of outlandish plot twists, coloured by the kind of period detail familiar from the likes of Dickens and Hardy.
The first and last parts are narrated by Sue, and the middle part by Maud, and they both drawn into a plot to gain Maud's inheritance, which is dependent on her marriage.Waters explores many aspects of Victorian society and its hypocrisy, focussing on the experiences of women and their limited choices, with fascinating asides on mental hospitals, erotic fiction and various forms of criminal activity, some of which stretch the reader's credulity.
I LOVE that I didn't know what was coming because that made the reading experience so much more intense.
I was in awe at several points in the book and I spent a lot of time trying to figure out what was going on.
I would like for everyone else to read this book without knowing too much about it, and therefore I'm not going to say much else.
But trust me when I say that this book will pull tricks on you, so if you like those kind of reading experiences you should definitely pick it up :)
Part 1 = Amazing. Part 2 and 3 = Is this book over yet?!

Not to mention, any ending that harkens to one of my favorite Anne of the Island scenes is just going to make me blind with the swooning.I’m not going to write any sort of synopsis for this book, and that’s just for your own good.
I was so completely wrapped up in the utterly engrossing feelings and thoughts of the characters that I never anticipated a few dramatic turns that I really should have seen coming.
And that’s when the romance feels formidable.
It’s about a love that’s denied and uncertain.
I do love a bit of Sarah Waters, and I'm pretty sad that this book has ended.
Despite the fact that this book consists of over 500 pages, I can say, that it certainly doesn't feel like a slog when reading it.
I had guessed what the novel was based on, hence the title, but it was so much more than that.I just love the fact the book is set in Victorian England.
I love the erotica scenes that she includes in her writing.
I must say, the other novel that I've read by Waters, is "Tipping the velvet", and the erotic scenes in there are hot, and beautifully explicit.
Still underwhelmed.
There were times when I could really forget that I was reading a book written in the 21st century as it felt so authentic.I don’t want to talk about the plot too much except to say that at the centre of it lies “a dastardly plan to relieve a young lady of her fortune”.
This is a story in which nothing is as it originally seems to be with a very complex, intricately woven plot which really kept my interest right to the end and I can’t wait to read more of this author’s work now.
The novel is a three part tale, written as a postmodern feminist rendition of a Victorian melodrama in its Gothic, Dickensian(Oliver Twist) splendor, with ample touches of the decadent extravagance of the Greek gods Priapus and Venus, as well as the somewhat toned-down values of Brontë and Poe. Greed, treachery, love, and moral ambiguities splashes the otherwise all too familiar theme of Gothic terror, intrigue and madness with some unique plot points and introduces an alternative version of love to this historical fictional saga.
Unnerving, colorful characters adorned the story line, such as the alternative household of Mrs.Sucksby (what a name for a baby farmer) who calls on Dainty to pass her an infant, she wanted something to squeeze.
'Be careful I don't grow tired of this scheme. I shan't be kind to you, then.''And is this kindness?' I say.We have moved, at last, into shadow, and I see his look: it is honest, amused, amazed. He says: 'This is dreadful villainy...When did I ever call it anything else?' Five stars! All those plot twists had me like:An excellent choice of a buddy-read with Chloe, who loved it as much as me!Dreamy and surprising, lush and tense, Fingersmith is everything a historical mystery should be. I went i
All those plot twists had me like:An excellent choice of a buddy-read with Chloe, who loved it as much as me!Dreamy and surprising, lush and tense, Fingersmith is everything a historical mystery should be.
And let me tell you, having been disappointed by reading gay undertones into other books / shows and it never coming to fruition, I was SO happy with Sue and Maud.
(hide spoiler)]The plot was extremely twisty for the entire length of the book.
I still don't know quite how a copy got on my shelf, but it's a keeper for sure.["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>
*The writing is VERY atmospheric; the story reads as a Gothic mystery, and even if this is not a genre that I habitually read I was impressed.
I do think I have given you enough of an indication of what this book offers so you can judge if it will fit what you are looking for.****************************************After a little more than half:A friend asked me if I found the writing in Sarah Waters' Fingersmith verbose.
BUT, but, but, now, in the second part, we are being told the same story all over again, albeit from another person's point of view!

Reto #41 PopSugar 2017: Un libro recomendado por un autor que te guste El libro está dividido en tres partes y escrito en primera persona en forma alternada por las dos voces femeninas principales: Sue y Maud. Ellas son las dos jóvenes alrededor de las que se teje la trama, aunque al principio esto no sea tan evidente y uno pudiera pensar que el quid del asunto es el engaño que quiere perpetrar Richard Rivers, ayudándose de Sue, para quedarse con la fortuna de Maud.Nada más lejos de la realidad
Sin embargo, para que todo tenga sentido, la autora tiene que escribir toda la primera parte nuevamente desde otra perspectiva (lo que ocupa más de la mitad de la segunda parte) y, con el nivel de descripción que tiene el libro, la lectura se hace un poco cuesta arriba.Lo que sí me gustó mucho es cómo la autora logra crear las atmósferas de sus decadentes escenarios principales; para nada me costó imaginar la lóbrega y monótona casa de Briar, o la sórdida casa de Land Street, y qué decir del manicomio: realmente para estremecerse.
