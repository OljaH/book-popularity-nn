The Mystery on Cobbett's Island is the 13th book in the series.
Trixie finds an old letter hidden in a book, sending the kids on a treasure hunt for hidden money.
I love the book lists in the back of these old paperbacks...in the back of the old copy of Mystery at Cobbett's Island that I have it lists "The Meg Mysteries'' as a recommended series.
I did a little bit of research....the Meg Mysteries is a series with a middle grade age amateur sleuth written in the late 60s.
The first six books of the Trixie Belden series were written by Julie Campbell.
Again, I have no memory of reading this one. The mystery is light, but interesting, and Jim gets to punch someone out. He does this with surprising frequency for such a low-conflict series. I especially liked the description of the regatta, and the clambake made me extremely hungry.On the other hand, there's a part of me that wishes the Bob-Whites weren't quite so altruistic. There's always a good cause that needs helping, but it would be nice if they ever demonstrated any difficulty in giving up the reward/treasure/pile of money they find.
Love, love, love the island setting, the sailing, the clam bake, and the treasure hunt type mystery.
I loved the camaraderie of the Bob-Whites, even Mart's constant teasing wasn't overly obnoxious or annoying.
I love "treasure hunt" type mysteries, I loved the sailing, exploring the island, the gazebo, and of course, the little hint of a Brian/Honey romance.
The fact that every time there's something critical that needs to be done, it's Trixie and Jim who get to do it.
Jim was kind of over-the-top in his constant praise of Trixie.
I am starting to wonder now if it was island life and clam bakes from this book that fueled this interest.The crime in this book is more minor than most books, the Bobwhites end up solving who is busting the lights of the buoys, but this is done secondary to the mystery of a treasure map.
I am partial to secret cods, old letters, and treasure maps so this book appeals to me in this respect.
But, then again, all the Trixie books appeal to me.A little more light-hearted than some of the other titles, this is definitely a good one in the series.
He LOOKED at her body in a bathing suit -- that's about as sexually explicit as the Trixies ever get.
(Speaking of which, it's hilarious the need the Trixie fanfic authors have to pair everyone up -- and since Dan didn't have a designated Bob White girlfriend (other than Hallie) he's often cast as the guy one of the girls is having an affair with, or he gets stuck in a threesome with Mart and Di.)But I digress -- my favorite scene is when the girls look through Pete's mother's attic and find dresses to wear to the fundraiser.
I slowly amassed the whole series as first editions (it seemed so glamourous as a kid owning precious books that were older than me!) by saving all my pocket money to buy them from the local secondhand store.
They sat in a back corner of the store, thankfully ignored by everyone else, as I slowly acquired them through pocket money and then in a mass swoop for Christmas.
So I didn't really like this book.
First of all, the mystery.
I've never been a fan of treasure-hunt type mysteries.
It was funny imagining Jim swaggering up and going "Yeah, Trixie's the boss of this gang." Haha!
Okay, yeah, I like sailboats, but I'm reading this book for enjoyment, not to learn everything there is to know about sailboats.
I also skimmed over the Captain's stories, they were boring and took up like five pages.
I liked that Jim picked Trixie up and spun her around, it satisfied the Jixie shipper in me.
Not the best book ever.
I do not remember the first time I read this book. I had to do extra chores and such around the house to be able to "earn" these books, or the money to BUY them. I was always sad when I could only afford one because I DEVOURED these!! Looking forward to re-reading this now!~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~RE-READ~ December 14, 2013FUN re-read. I enjoyed this one a lot. Lots of neat stuff about sailing and a grand adventure for the Bob-Whites!!!
The BWotG (minus Dan. AGAIN *angry face*) are vacationing at the beach when Trixie finds a letter. This isn't one of the best/strongest stories, but it does have an actual mystery, Trixie and Jim going undercover for an hour, and lots of sailing.Recommended 10/11+ for scary situations.
Book 13. Another book minus Dan but Trixie seems so much older in this one. At the time I thought it was just maturity after a trip to NY haha. She and Jim start to "notice" each other in this book and I remember my loyalties swaying a bit from Dan to Jim at the book's end *gasp*.
My annual summer re-read...I sit on the beach and still get lost in the world of the Bob Whites!
They had left the book as written, without correction for "current attitudes and beliefs." It was interesting to read that because it heightened my awareness.
To me, changing a book is like rewriting history.
I saw myself over 50 years ago.
I saw how the intrigue of the book captured me.
I found out how I built my vocabulary and won spelling contests (thanks, Mart Belden!) And my love of drinking makes milk like water (thanks, Trixie?).
I may not read another any time soon but this was a pleasant trip down memory lane.
An excellent Trixie Belden mystery.
This is odd, of course, because they were MEANT for teen and pre-teen girls, but I was a young boy that read everything he could get his hands on and when I first stumbled on my first TRIXIE BELDON book I was instantly hooked!
Trixie is the star, or "lead" character, followed by Jim and Honey (who quickly became the love of my young life, I had a total crush on a fictional character that only existed in ink) and this brave trio was constantly getting into trouble, solving mysteries and murders; that sort of thing.
I lost all of my Trixie books years ago, lending them to friends and that sort of thing.
It wasn't right and it was not one of my favorites.
There are a few late in the series I don't like either, through 10 are the gems.This one was all over the place and very different than before.
The person who penned this book knew the broad strokes of the series but didn't care to keep all the facts lined up.This one was also another one that was a lesson instead of a mystery, this time of sailing.
It was 75% sailing lesson, 25% mystery and that's why I don't like it as much.
A childhood favorite re-visited.Is the story as good as I remember?
– Most of a day’s read.Characters?
– Memorable, several characters.Setting?
– Real world, pre - computer pre - air conditioning, pre - cell phone.Written approximately?
– 1964.Does the story leave questions in the readers mind?
Also, the absence of computers, cell phones, and air conditioning in homes, especially the mansion.Short storyline: Trixie Belden, Honey, Jim, and her brothers explore Cobbett's while on vacationing, and manage to stumble on a mystery to find the missing money of the former owner of the home next door.Notes for the reader: A great mystery!
"When the Bob-Whites arrive on Cobbett’s Island for vacation, Trixie finds a mysterious letter.
But the clues in the letter are hard for Trixie to understand.
or on sea?"Honey and Jim have invited the Bob-Whites to a vacation on Cobbett's Island.
The gang arrives on Cobbett's Island just as a fierce storm hits.
The Bob-Whites find a letter in the library of the house they are staying in and it sends them on a treasure hunt to find some missing money.This is one of my favorites in the series, because everyone is having fun and they come together in the end to solve the mystery.
Trixie Belden and the Mystery on Cobbett's Island is book number thirteen in the Trixie Belden mystery series.
Trixie Belden and Honey Wheeler are best friends, horse lovers, and detectives who always seem to accidentally find a mystery waiting to be solved.
In this book, Trixie and Honey find a treasure map that has almost undecipherable sentences and illustrations on it.
It is up to Trixie, Honey, and the Bob Whites of the Glen to find out who before Cobbett's Island goes crazy!
I love the Trixie Belden Mystery Series because it combines two of my favorite things - - horses and mystery!
Trixie for once manages to avoid getting into too many scrapes on her own, and doesn't go off on as much of a 'gumshoe detective' mission as usual.
As much as I love the Trixie Belden series, the adventures can sometimes seem a little far-fetched - as indeed this one is to a point, but the sailing descriptions, the storms and the character interactions made this one of the more enjoyable, if less 'dangerous' Belden books in the series.
This book is amazing, as all of the Trixie Belden books are.
Again, Trixie, Honey and all of their friends try their hardest to solve another mystery.
The mystery on Cobbett's Island starts when Trixie finds a message hidden in an old book while the Bob-Whites of the Glen are on holiday.
With the help of a new friend, they try their best to solve the mystery that the message unfolds while helping many others along the way.The book did get a little boring int the middle, but I guess all books do.
I recommend this to anyone who enjoys mysteries from the age of 7...
For Christmas one year, my parents grabbed me the entire Trixie Belden set and I couldn't put them down.
After I finished with them, they continued to purchase them as quickly as I could read them.
Even with a learning disability, I devoured the books.
I look back now and I find that Trixie Belden was much more age related to young girls, particularly to me, reading the books than Nancy Drew.
There was something in these books that I found to be a greater escape than I did ND, too.
I found that they weren't so "over the top" or dated.
The gang (except for poor Dan, as Trixie puts it, "Oh, jeepers! What's wrong? He's our newest member and it's not fair for him to miss out on the fun again...") heads for the Wheelers' vacation home on Cobbett's Island for some fun by the sea. While browsing through some books, they discover an old letter that indicates somewhere hidden is a chart that will lead to a small fortune meant for someone called "little Ed".
Trixie isn't looking for a mystery when she and her friends head to Cobbett's Island. However, their first night there, they find a letter that suggests there is a treasure nearby. With their new friend Peter, can they find it? This is my second favorite book in the series. The characters are wonderful and the plot is very well done.Read my full review at Carstairs Considers.
This was a fun book, and gave an introduction to sailing. Of course, it made Trixie and her friends out to be some kind of superheroes, as always, but that's what was fun about these books when I was a kid. Sept 2013 ... another fun re-read ... lessons about sailing, kids helping others, all combine to make this a fun book.
The thirteenth book in the Trixie Belden series. This was probably their most enjoyable “out of town” adventure to date. There was a good cast of additional characters and a cracker little mystery to go along with it.It had its usual “everyone making fun of Trixie” stuff, but aside from that this was thoroughly fun reading.
Ha! Found this at Powell's in Portland and was sure it was one I didn't have. I have been slowly replacing these since I lost all my books from childhood in a house fire. This is so very wholesome, but they do encounter a rebel teenager with a gun in the end. Luckily Trixie outwits him and they get the gun away. Nice work Trixie!
I read all of the Trixie Belden mysteries many times as a child, but I didn't remember The Mystery on Cobbett's Island as well as some of the others. I was therefore pleasantly surprised when I recently re-read it to find it a really solid Trixie Belden with a well-done plot and many of the best elements that make me love these books.
I read so many Trixie Belden books when I was in middle school. It was so much fun to read this one (again, I assume, though I didn't have any memory of the plot) as an adult. The mystery was pretty well done, and the characters, while not super complex, are endearing. I think I will have to pick up a couple more from the series to enjoy.
The Bob White's are visiting Cobbett's Island on vacation, they are planning on sailing, clambakes, swimming and lots of fun, but Trixie finds a mystery involving cash hidden away years ago. Trixie engages the Bob White's in the search for the money, along with new friend Peter.
I did not WANT to learn about sailing. But that was a good part about how Trixie and Jim have to dress up in bad-girl/bad-boy drag in order to have a date that doesn't include everyone else. Also the part where Honey has a questionable dream about Brian.
