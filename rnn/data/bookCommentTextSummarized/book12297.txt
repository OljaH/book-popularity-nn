And completely erased is the notion that David Bowman, as Star Child, is now one with the Universe, in some Zen-like way, and also much more like something we'd called a god.Don't get me wrong, 2001 is still one of my favorite films, but to get the full meaning and understand the full weight of why 2001 has been called "the perfect science fiction story," you must read the book.
Unfortunately, Kubrick stripped away the mysticism and theory and left us what is, in comparison to the book, only a glimmer at something bigger.Kubrick touched the monolith, but Clarke went inside.
Classic.
I read 2001: A Space Odyssey when I was a teenager and knew it was a very influential work of fiction because of the film and all the attention it had received.
Thirty years later, I have read it again, and though I may not completely get it the second time around, the more mature reader can better grasp the vision and message of the genius author.
I especially enjoyed the many allusions to other works and found the reference to Melville's Ahab particularly engrossing.
Not just an excellent science fiction novel, this is a work of literature, brilliant.
I remember watching 2001: A space Odyssey about seven years back and almost losing my mind during the overlong Stargate sequence and what followed after that acid trip. *The I might puke face*Fast forward to 2017, one of my buddies called me up and said, 'Sreyas, 2001: Space Odyssey is a fricking classic. You should read the book before watching the movie'. Fortunately, I had a copy of the novel with me and I jumped right in!  ❝ If he was indeed mad, his delusions were beautifully organized.❞  T
I remember watching 2001: A space Odyssey about seven years back and almost losing my mind during the overlong Stargate sequence and what followed after that acid trip.
The story starts in a time before the dawn of human kind, when benevolent and rather mindless man-apes were dying one after another due to overlong drought and natural predators.
After seven years, I was just moments away from finally understanding the end of 2001 A space Odyssey.*I understand......

Clarke's prose doesn't bring all the boys to the yard.Now that I've got that out of the way, I enjoyed this book very much.
Some of it is a little dated, not surprising since Clarke wrote it around the time some man-ape discovered fire.
A lot of it is spot-on, though, like Heywood Floyd's tablet by another name.The first two threads do a great job of setting up the third.
The man-ape thread was the least exciting but nicely set the stage.
By the time Bowman's thread got going, the book was very hard to put down.Unlike a lot of sf classics, I enjoyed both the story AND the concepts.
This main section of the book is entirely set in space so we don’t know if Clarke would have predicted iPads and Tumblr.(Monolith on the moon)The middle section of the book where astronaut David Bowman is battling crazed and homicidal AI HAL 9000 (of “Daisy Daisy” fame) is my favorite.
If you are puzzled by the Kubrick movie this book may help to clarify almost everything for you, except that according to Clarke Kubrick and himself had different idea of the story they wanted to tell and Clarke’s answers are not necessarily the correct one!
If you like the film adaptation of  2001: A Space Odyssey but have not read this book you should.
“He now perceived that there were more ways than one behind the back of space.” As a longtime admirer of Stanley Kubrick’s dazzling film, I was more than a little hesitant about picking up this book, apprehensive that it might not be able to live up to my perhaps overly demanding expectations. And it did take me a good 50 pages or so before I really began to connect with Clarke’s writing. After that initial rough patch, however, I became increasingly immersed in this absorbing story, eventually
Clarke masterfully depicted the vast grandeur of space, in part by subtly yet persistently underscoring how very small and alone David was, and he did so in such a way that I ended up feeling something I’ve not experienced in quite some time: pure childlike wonder at the unfathomable, incomprehensible beauty and magnitude of our universe.
I was captivated, intrigued, and exhilarated by this grand adventure into the nature of existence, the heart of the universe, and, unexpectedly, the endless expanses of the human heart.
And, granted, the book did end things with a freakin’ (view spoiler)[Star Baby
389. 2001: A Space Odyssey, Arthur C. Clarke2001: A Space Odyssey is a 1968 science fiction novel by British writer Arthur C. Clarke. It was developed concurrently with Stanley Kubrick's film version and published after the release of the film. Clarke and Kubrick worked on the book together, but eventually only Clarke ended up as the official author. The story is based in part on various short stories by Clarke, including The Sentinel (written in 1948 for a BBC competition, but first published i

It looked like a fantastic space adventure so a week later I went to see it.
Dave Bowman: Hello, HAL.
Do you read me, HAL?
HAL: Affirmative, Dave.
Dave Bowman: Open the pod bay doors, HAL.
HAL: I'm sorry, Dave.
Dave Bowman: What are you talking about, HAL?
Dave Bowman: I don't know what you're talking about, HAL.
HAL: I know that you and Frank were planning to disconnect me, and I'm afraid that's something I cannot allow to happen.
Dave Bowman: Where the hell'd you get that idea, HAL?
Dave Bowman: Alright, HAL.
Dave Bowman: HAL, I won't argue with you anymore.
HAL: Dave, this conversation can serve no purpose anymore.
Forget what you think you know if you’ve seen the film.This is surely a landmark piece of Science Fiction.
I also enjoyed learning more about the monoliths and their true nature and/or purpose.For some reason I thought the opening sequence (the Dawn of Man) would be boring.
The grand finale was everything I’d hoped for and it does clear the water a bit, although there are some things that remain tantalizingly open for interpretation.
OK, so he had the date of space-worthiness wrong (we’re more than a decade overdue) but there are any number of things in here that are interesting (Tablet PCs with internet capability, for example).
4.5 Stars. The books of Arthur C. Clarke (at least the ten or so that I have read) have been consistently good and of very high quality. When I pick up one of his books, I can be confident that I won't be disappointed. This book is terrific and don't think that if you have seen the movie you know what is going to happen.
There was a nice bit at the back of the book where Arthur acknowledges the differences between the two and the explanation behind it.The stories are very similar, it's just some of the details that change.
Was the 1:4:9 ratio in the movie?Unlike the movie the ape men are very interesting and the difference is that it talks about how the monolith experiments on them and chooses those most fit to teach to use tools.
Oh and the last 20% of the book makes much more sense than the last 20% of the movie.
“They became farmers in the fields of stars; they sowed and sometimes they reaped.And sometimes, dispassionately, they had to weed.”Written a year before Neil Armstrong became first man to step on moon, the science fiction story is really well written.
Clark mixes his speculative predictions with true events from past (like the panic caused by broadcastings of Wells’ ‘War of the Worlds’) and once he quoted Niels Bohr (““Your theory is crazy-but not crazy enough to be true.”) I loved his descriptions of lives of astronauts – the long, lonely, boring journeys interrupted by occasional wonderful sights and destinations.
Without doubt this is a science fiction classic, and an early example of a novel and a movie that are born at the same time, adding detail and nuance to each other by the makers’ consistent communication and reflection on the respective effects of different media on the end result.
As a story, I found it interesting and compelling, especially the hilarious initial chapter on early humans and the reason for their development into something of a higher intellectual order.
It is not even the story of the supremacy of any specific technology or species as such.It is a reflection on the utter unimportance of humanity from a cosmic perspective.
Posle čitanja jednog ovakvog remek-dela teško je naći prave reči koje bi iskazale divljenje koje osećam prema Arturu Klarku; čovek je pravi genijalac, vizionar, a na momente mi se činilo kao da nije sa ove planete.Priznajem, oduvek sam bila fascinirana Svemirom.
Šta, vi kao niste o tome razmišljali kad ste bili dete?
E, pa onda ne znam kakvo vam je bilo detinjstvo!U svakom slučaju, koliko god da sam oduvek imala bujnu maštu, postoji nešto što nikada nisam mogla da zamislim: kako je to biti astronaut?
Ali, šta ako postoje neka pitanja na koja odgovora nema, ili ih još uvek nema.
Like a lot of sci fi, the first half of the novel was a bit slow and hyper focused on a mysterious technology.
Which is great because if you love sci fi it’s probably because you like your mystery with a hint of tech.
Which covered a good portion of the central half of the novel.
This is a rough depiction of my face while reading it 🙄.Then came the mind blowing, spectacularly done third act, which is a bit hard to grasp but amazing in scope and theory.
This is a rough depiction of my face while reading that part🤪.
One of the few instances where the movie was better than the book, but not by much. The remarkable thing about this book is how it stands the test of time. The science, the technology, the language, the style, all fit into our modern view as if it was written last week. It was published in 1968, before men walked on the moon, before cell phones, before...well, almost everything we take for granted these days. It is science fiction at it's best.
The apes of the first section evolve into spacefaring humankind, and then the protagonist, David Bowman, morphs into the Star Child, showcasing hope that from the darkness and the slime, this fragile human species might see beyond itself to become more than its most basic designs for destruction.
(Note: Clarke's book has the astronauts traveling to the sixth planet, not Jupiter, as in the film; this was amended in the three sequel novels that followed.) Much like David Bowman, his evolution into the Star Child is at once a frustrating and beautiful allegory for our recognition that we are but infants in this universe of ours, and that our evolution requires a humility before the sheer vastness and incomprehensibility of creation.
In need of more material, Kubrick and Clarke spent two years building around the story, developing a novel, and then a screenplay.Kubrick, who favored using images and sound to tell a story and held contempt for plot, believed all a movie needed were six to eight "non-submersible units," according to science fiction author Brian Aldiss who worked with Kubrick on A.I.: Artificial Intelligence.
It was a pleasure to be swept away into one possible 2001 where the technological leaps of the space race didn't stop with the moon landing.-- The monolith is the greatest extraterrestrial ever put on film and so far, the most compelling I've come across in fiction.
In my case I liked both versions quite a bit, but for different reasons.Part 1The book has the edge when it comes to describing the first part, when a monolith from an unseen alien race visit the Earth 3 million years in the past and intervene with a group of starving ape-men and pushes them to use tools to kill animals for meat, as well as using these weapons on rival ape-men tribes.
However, the ultimate intentions of the alien race, and any details about them, remain a mystery.In conclusion, 2001: A Space Odyssey requires that you experience both the book and film to fully grasp the intent of Clarke and Kubrick, and it is well worth the time.
With an unlimited supply of food and not be dependent on plants and fruit ,for survival.Very rare during the long drought conditions(millions of years long).The human race might reach its destiny ,for better or worse ,after all.
The spaceship Discovery is built and sent to Saturn 's moon Japetus.
And will be revived when they arrive, at their destination.It's a rather boring voyage,since Hal never makes a mistake.But still the view ,of giant Jupiter's constantly changing and colorful atmosphere,the planet's numerous satellites, is not to be missed.Neither is Saturn's Rings and moons.This novel with a strange and vague ending.What does it mean?
Αυτή η γέννηση εκφράζεται με το βρέφος που ταξιδεύει στο διάστημα, Πλέον είναι μια ενέργεια (;) που ξέφυγε από την υλικότητα του σώματος και είναι έτοιμη να ταξιδέψει ελεύθερη στο αέναο σύμπαν.Κρατάω κάτι που βρίσκεται στην προτελευταία σελίδα του βιβλίου:“He was back,precisely where he wished to be,in the space that men called real”και στην τελευταία σελίδα:“For though he was the master of the world,he was not quite sure what to do next.But he would think of something”.Υ.Γ.
Εννοείται διαβάστηκε με τη μουσική υπόκρουση του “Also Sprach Zarathustra” του Strauss.Κάτι ήξερε ο Kubrick και το χρησιμοποίησε στο soundtrack.
I knew the basic story before ever approaching the book, but I didn’t find that this hampered my enjoyment of it at all and I liked the extra details that the novel was able to include (at least in regards to my hazy recollection of what the movie covered…definitely time for a re-watch).
I have to admit, though, that I thought the movie was better able to ramp up the suspense when it came to (view spoiler)[the game of cat-and-mouse between Bowman and HAL (hide spoiler)], but overall I thoroughly enjoyed this novel and thought its exploration of a possible vision for humanity’s further evolution was great.
I did not expect a book on extra-terrestrial life to leave me thinking about the evolution of mankind.You won't find any alien action here, no war-of-the-worlds scenario.
Instead, 2001 is a book that relies on the sheer strength of ideas - which is what I believe good science-fiction should be about.
(hide spoiler)].I did not fully understand the ending and I don't think I ever will.
No wonder this has been labelled as the best science-fiction book ever.
Necu ovde nesto posebno pametovati. Jedna od najboljih SF knjiga. Savrsen spoj tehnologije i filozofije. Obavezno stivo za svakoga ko voli da cita (subjektivan sam :P ).I jedna od retkih dela gde film i knjiga cine savrsenu simbiozu i treba oba dela upoznati.
I recently finished two SF books, this one and Prelude to the Foundation. I gave the book by Isaac Asimov 4* but after reading the Odyssey I will downgrade it to 3*. I believe the Odyssey is better literature and more thought provoking.
Film e libro sono abbastanza criptici nel loro significato, ma rispetto al film il romanzo riesce a essere meno ambiguo; diceva Clarke: "Se qualcuno capisce il film alla prima visione, io e Kubrick abbiamo fallito nel nostro intento".Il libro consta di quattro capitoli nei quali viene rappresentata tutta l'evoluzione umana.
L'ultimo salto avanti nell'evoluzione la dovrà fare un uomo, Bowman, e lo farà in completa solitudine.Alla fine, in un percorso praticamente circolare corrispondente al ciclo della vita, nascerà un nuovo bambino, più evoluto, superuomo.Tutto questo per ipotizzare il fatto che l'evoluzione dell'uomo non sia stata spontanea, ma piuttosto aiutata o indotta da stimoli esterni; extraterrestri, forse.
An absolute must-read for science fiction fans!Arthur C. Clarke was certainly ahead of his time, considering that the book was published a year before we actually put men on the moon in 1969. I think that adds even more astonishment to his writing and his imagination. Reading this book in 2018 makes me appreciate it even more.
Forse la parte iniziale di Clarke, proprio perché emessa da un narratore onnisciente che parla dal futuro, rispetto a un presente narrativo di 3 milioni di anni fa, è più appassionante nel libro: da umani dell’oggi, ci viene fornito punto di vista attraverso cui identificarci mentre guardiamo la vicenda degli ominidi.
La fase successiva, con il viaggio verso il monolito nascosto sulla Luna, per me rimane quella più ostica di film e libro, quale che sia il mezzo con cui viene raccontata (nel senso che mi annoia).
