Vallière who is also the narrator, his friend Gregson, and Cook - "reminiscent of a Shakespearean clown" - are escaping from Zonraki, trying to cross the yet unknown country to reach the Gurano Hills.

One thing about Nabokov, whether it be a little a known short story or a famous novel, I am always in awe of his writings regardless of subject matter.
The stories, Terra Incognita, Spring in Fialta and The Doorbell, feature peril and sadness, in an escape in the tropics, a fateful meeting and a return of the fearsome kind.
Terra Incognita was the stand out, The Doorbell was second, Spring in Fialta was OK, the stories might not be his best, but there isn't a drop in the quality of his language.
Want to read Nabokov but are not sure about starting with such a story as Lolita? Well, this is a very good introduction to him. Many people begin by reading his long novels, but a lot of Nabokov's magic comes from his style and word choice, which can be seen in his short stories as well, so I always tell people to begin with them instead of his longer works, they are slightly less problematic/traumatizing.
Superb style but the stories didnt really do it for me. I liked the second one, about Nina, the best.
Terra Incognita 🌟Spring in Fialta 🌟 🌟 🌟 🌟The doorbell 🌟
Postoji čudno i postoji Nabokov.
Od svih Rusa, Nabokov mi je omiljeni.
Čovjek je mag magova.
Bog otac.
Terra Incognita je igra.
Igra stvarnosti.
Šta je stvarno, a šta ne.
Gdje je izlaz iz okova svakidašnjice (ukoliko shvatite šta je svakidašnjica).
Terra Incognita je teritorija uma koju ne znamo i koju nikada nećemo saznati.
To je mjesto gdje je sve moguće pa i dijenje ličnosti u stilu Dostojevskog (kojeg je Nabokov prezirao).
Zanimljiv spis, sem ako ga čitate na ruskom jer taj čovjek i riječi...
Sve što se pojavilo tu, razradiće se kasnije u tom romanu.
Each of the three short stories in this volume are entrancing in their own way.
"Terra Incognita" is a bizarre kaleidoscope world, "Spring in Fialta" has the graceful melancholy of old-fashioned black and white European films, and "The Doorbell" is a disorientating, grotesque portrayal of detached mother and son.
The one thing that these stories all had in common however, was that they were beautifully written.
Nabokov's writing is the style of writing that makes me feel like I've been transported to another world, pure poetry in prose.
I feel the stories would benefit from a single, undisturbed sitting.
Nabokov is a man after my own heart with this collection (though incidentally I suspect these three short stories were grouped in this volume posthumously.) I can't find a scrap of evidence here to suggest that he is not completely uninhibited in his use of language, as he invents and repurposes words to suit, and bends one or two (frankly stupid) established rules of English grammar to his will and the discerning reader's delight.
'The Doorbell', almost as short as the titular story, drops the first-person narrative and so seems in some ways less fantastic than the other two, but is nonetheless a worthy exercise in experience-telling.
The titular piece is ruined by a hamfisted and ghastly bit of materialistic sermonizing. Dreadful. Though the colorful prose and imaginative stories save the rest of it.
دو داستان خوب اگر دلتان برای قلم نابوکف تنگ شده باشداما ویرایش فاجعه ممکن است حالتان را بد کند!
علائم سجاوندی بسیار آشفته و با فاصله از کلمه قبل و چسبیده به کلمات بعد بسیار در متن زیاد است.
جایی از متن نوشته شده: «خب وقته رفتنه» یعنی ماجرای ه-کسره به کتابهای چاپی هم (صدبار تاسف) رسیده استزبان مترجم بین زبان گفتاری و نوشتاری کاملا سردرگم و آشفته استحتی وسط کلمات فاصلههای اضافه افتاده و نیمی از کلمه به سر سطر رفته است!مثلا یک سطر این طور تمام شده: در لژیون خارجی خدو سطر بعد این طور شروع شده: مت کر

As you might expect from Vladimir Nabokov, the writing is very beautiful, stunning even. The first story was superb but I found the second and third tough. The second story particularly was hard work to trawl through and I found myself enjoying the beautiful words but willing it to end. The third story is more interesting and not so long but still not up to the first story.
The title story is a 14 page journey into the jungle almost as mesmerizing as Heart of Darkness in its language and imagery. If only the other two stories could live up to it.
#1 - 5 stars#2 - 2 stars#3 - 2 stars
Without particularly loving the subject matter, or even particularly remembering (only a few days after the fact) how the stories actually went, I found myself floored by the little descriptive passages - particularly in Spring in Fialta.
"Terra Incognita" is a bizarre kaleidoscope world, "Spring in Fialta" has the graceful melancholy of old-fashioned black and white European films, and "The Doorbell" is a disorientating, grotesque portrayal of detached mother and son. The one thing that these stories all had in common however, was that they were beautifully written. "Terra Incognita" is probably the best piece of literature that depicts tropics.
My other Pocket Penguin of the day also contains three stories, originally written in Russian and translated into English several years later by the author.
It is perfection in fourteen pages.The second story, "Spring in Fialta", is probably based on a real visit and possibly a true encounter, but is set in a fictional resort.
This is the longest story of the three and apparently Nabokov had some difficulty getting the English version published; I cannot understand why.The final story of the trio is "The Doorbell", a wickedly funny little tale of a grown-up son reunited with his mother for the first time in many years.
All three stories are perfect in their own way.
This story is that of Valliere, a rugged explorer in a tropical faraway land, as he and his two crewmates and native porters navigate the land.
The only problem is that Valliere is in the fits of a malaria-like illness, and his mind starts to leave him as the loyalty and safety of companions also does.Nabokov writes with abandon, as usual, forming eloquent, beautiful sentences that still evoke so much emotion and action.
I was impressed with the characters' slow descent into madness as described so quickly but thoroughly in this story.
Desde que tive a oportunidade de ler Lolita que Vladimir Nabokov passou a ocupar um lugar na minha lista mental de escritores verdadeiramente extraordinários, pela habilidade no uso da palavra tanto para contar histórias como para criar personagens reais, com as quais criamos laços. Daí veio o meu interesse por este livro, pequeno para variar, mas com o estilo inconfundível de quem cria frases como moldaria barro. Fica a minha opinião sobre cada um dos contos.Continue a ler a opinião aqui: http://bloguinhasparadise.blogspot.pt/2014/06/opiniao-terra-incognita-vladimir-nabokov.html

It recounts fleeting meetings between the narrator and a woman called Nina.
The narrator's voyeurism and his tendency to reduce Nina to her physical presence don't manage to mask the complexity of her character.
This comes as a shock to the narrator who is completely dumbstruck by her reaction when he asks: "Look here -what if I love you?".
Nina, who would "utter course words with perfect simplicity, (becomes) embarrassed" forcing him to pretend he was joking.
This turns the tables on a narrator who spends the majority of the story dismissing Nina as child-like, uncultured but lovable.
Intellectual playfulness - definitely a great description of these stories!
Nabokov has a very unique turn of phrase sometimes, really as if he's painting with words.
I only give this little book 3 starts because for me personally, they're not something to relax into and enjoy - they're portraits, snapshots, and I prefer an actual story (probably why I don't get on with short stories in general, but you never know what you'll find on new literary voyages).
Give them a try, they're fast to read and a refreshing contrast with a lot of popular writing that's around today which is really more storytelling than literature.
I've read Lolita, and Ada, and The Real Life of Sebastian Knight, and possibly started and then gave up on Pale Fire. All of them, except Lolita, unmemorable. Reading these stories, I remember why. I can admire the use of language, and the structure of sentences, and the similes and masterly metaphors, and the like. But it often feels like a lot of sound and fury. All show and no go. Aptly described by the Nabokovian word meretricious.And yet no doubt I'll read more of his wordy works at some point in the future..
There are 3 stories in total and one thing they all have in common is amazing language and imagery. I had never read anything by Nabokov before, I was easily swept up in his style of writing. The stories themselves...they're not bad. The characters are barely memorable but the over-all message/theme in each of the stories is interesting and inevitably what you’ll end up talking about. If you like to feel very connected with the characters in any story then I would look for something else.
The first story, Terra Incognita, is really enthralling and exciting to read, and one can tell that Nabokov's writing is top-notch throughout the book, but the narratives of the two other stories fall a bit flat in terms of how interesting they are. It was only the first one left me thinking, and it was only the first one that I could finish in one sitting without ending up feeling bored, hence why this is not being rated so high. The writing is absolutely beautiful though, don't get me wrong!
With just three short stories, this is a little taster, introduction to the author's work. He's obviously a talented writer and I enjoyed all of the stories but am not sure whether I should read anything else by him. I would prefer a collection that concentrated on the weirder, more magical side of his writing (if it exists). Recommendations welcome.
Read a lot of his short stories, all different, though sensual, some are the best I ever read. Two of the stories here are very short, leaving little room for character development. The first one is rich in language, mesmerizing. The last is rather factual, more of an anecdote. I like the longer middel one best, melancholic, beauty of language and some character development.
It's hard to believe this was written by the same genius who weaved Lolita. It sounds more like an excerpt from King's Solomon's Mines. Months, perhaps weeks from now I'll have scenes from this short story filed in my mental folder of limbo--snippets of stories I can recall, but can't remember where from--where these from books or from some movie?
'Terra Incognita' highlights the extraordinary talent of Vladimir Nabokov, and his ability to adapt himself to any kind of genre. The three stories in this book represent genres from honest love to madness to adventure, three genres almost obsolete in his great work 'Lolita'. This trilogy of short stories only confirms Nabokov's place in literary greatness.
A fevered dream of a short story - never sure what's real or imagined. Nabokov stretches language and imagery into something new, dense and florid. A journey through dark heat, as Bob Dylan might have said.
with the exception of the title story, the other two works in this collection are fantastic. for such short texts, they're incredibly well realised. the let down was the title story which never really got going.
