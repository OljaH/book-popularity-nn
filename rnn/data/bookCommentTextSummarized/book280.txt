This is a collection of short stories by Kawabata. The title of the book comes from the first story called "The Dancing Girl of Izu"In general all of the stories had a strange feeling, very distant from me and yet very human. I enjoyed all of them quite a lot. I don't think this is for everyone though.Be well folks <3
That is the "prayer in the mother tongue."A string of solemn words sprint from my mind onto my lips at slight picture of a funeral that passes on the street.
With my hands pressed palm to palm; expressing gratitude to the death a prayer in the mother tongue, “Bless the departed soul and forgive all the mortal sins”; escapes in the melancholic air.
The choreographed beats of a drum lingered from a nearby tea house.As I sat on the old steps, waiting for the youth, whom they called ‘Master of funerals’, I heard the heart wrenching cries of a child as his poured the oil out of the lamp, lit in front of the dead.
Moreover, I let my personal weaknesses flood my perceiving of Kawabata's writing, judging it and condemning it for the uncomfortable and unbearable feelings he aroused inside me.I don't even know whom to recommend this book to - people in a joyful state might see their happiness slip through their fingers, while people who are already sad will find themselves on the brink of depression.
I might recommend it to the few that are in possession of a clear, balanced mind, as only they could appreciate the disjointed, chaotic world peopled by Kawabata's troubled characters.There is not one single happy soul in this collection of short stories, with themes like alienation, loss, deception or cruelty.
Everytime i read for "Yasunari Kawabata" i got that feeling of being impressed and depressed at the same time ... there was a dark shadows that haunted me for days after reading this book, now that i also read for "Natsume Soseki" and " Yokio Mishima" i started to believe its a Japanese thing.
Relato breve de Kawabata. Describe el corto viaje de un estudiante que se encuentra en su camino unos músicos ambulantes. En realidad no se puede decir mucho de este libro, o lo mismo, se puede decir tanto de él, pero es irrelevante. Llamar impresionista a esta obra es la mejor forma de describirla. Puesto que solo quien la lea, y como la lea, podrá llegar sentir el mensaje de amor y soledad que entrega.
I preferred the Yasushi Inoue story,'Obasute', beginning..." When on earth was it that I first heard the legends about abandoning the old people on Mount Obasute?" This theme is also dealt with in the movie ' The Ballad of Narayama'
De todas formas me gustaría recalcar que no debería entenderse en la atmósfera kawabatiana, a mi modo de ver, este paso del mundo infantil al mundo adulto de manera rígida sino que se trata más bien de idas y venidas constantes de un lugar a otro representadas por los personajes masculinos que pueblan sus novelas, siempre enganchados al recuerdo de la juventud y a los amores apasionados que en él encuentran, independientemente de la edad que tengan.Respecto al entorno como espejo simbólico de las emociones de los personajes, el paraíso al que se ha aludido más arriba, concuerda con el lugar donde se ubica la historia, la península de Izu, un lugar tradicionalmente de recreo y ocio en Japón, en contraposición a Tokio, de donde viene el protagonista (dicotomía que encontraremos después tanto en País de Nieve, las montañas en ese caso, como en Lo Bello y lo Triste, Kioto allí).
Racconto.Conosco troppo poco la narrativa giapponese per poter capire il ruolo innovativo di Kawabata e conosco abbastanza bene la natura americana per non prendere per buona la dichiarazione di Donald Keene sul fatto che gli americani capivano Kawabata più del giapponesi.Ma a Keene possiamo perdonare l’entusiasmo vista la sua carriera decennale di esperto iamatologo.Il racconto è breve e, come già presente nei suoi temi, riguarda un viaggio.
Un giovane studente incontra durante il percorso verso la penisola di Izu una piccola compagnia di artisti girovaghi, categoria all’epoca non proprio ben vista.
This new, published in 1926, made him famous man who would become one of the greatest Japanese authors.The five that make up the new collection here this all revolve around the subject of love, the beauty of women and death, as we frequently find in his work.The danseuze Izu (1926):This first novel, which gives its name to the collection, inspired by the personal experience of the author.In 1918, Kawabata on a trip to Izu. During his journey on foot, he meets a traveling theater troupe.We find the same frame in the story where the narrator is fascinated by the beauty of one of the young actresses.
Five stars for "The Dancing Girl..." Classic Kawabata in many respects, but there's also sobbing on a random schoolboy at the end.The rest of the stories were lacking in sustenance, I felt. Shikoku had a few mentions, about which I was a faintly excited, but they've rather put me off the other Palm-of-the-Hand Stories. And without them I'll never achieve "Kawabata Completion"! Is it just me, but does "palm-of-the-hand" sound like they're supposed to be a bit raunchy?
As we can see and imagine the seemingly loving bond initiated by the nineteen-year-old narrator ‘I’ when he again meets such a young, pretty girl named Kaoru, a dancer traveling as a member in a group to another town [“I had seen the little dancer twice before.” (p.
This might be quite a simple, ordinary story between a young man and his fledging love after seeing her but Kawabata has own ways of narrating to induce his readers to read on and wonder if his love is shared and ended happily.
Oh, here is one of my fav of Kawabata: Diary of My Sixteenth Year. When I first read it, I was astonished of the power of these simple words. The Dancing Girl of Izu is very popular in Japan. Not sure what else are included in this English translation, but if you like Kawabata, this should be a good read.
The stories are hit or miss but the title story, "the dancing girl of izu" is a subtle yet powerful coming-of-age story of a young man experiencing young love. Usually these stories are cheese but this one was very good. The other stories were generally just okay to me with some of them feeling like diary entries. If you liked his "palm of the hand stories" you may end up liking some of the other material in this book.
For anyone who has watched a loved one slip away from dementia, old age, or illness, the autobiographical story "Diary of My Sixteenth Year" contained in this book will be both painfully familiar and oddly comforting. The other stories are also beautiful and haunting - I especially like the Money Road. The collection of short, short stories at the end are all challenging - their meaning isn't always clear, but they are beautiful and will stay with you for a long long time.

Seperti saya baca di bagian yang menceritakan latar belakang Yasunari Kawabata, cerpen-cerpen (edit: novelet-novelet) di dalam buku ini banyak mengisahkan kesunyian, kematian. Ada cinta yang tak terungkap, ada cinta bertepuk sebelah tangan, kiranya begitu.Yang saya suka dari buku ini adalah Yasunari Kawabata menuliskan kata-katanya dengan indah dan luwes. Namun, saya memang sedikit sukar memahami buku terjemahan, sebagaimana saya membaca karya terjemahan Jostein Garrder. Perasaan saya sama: lebih banyak hampanya.Terakhir : 3.0 dari 5 bintang!
2,5*Ao inicio fiquei confusa porque esperava uma narrativa num todo mas só depois me deparei que este livro era de facto um livro de contos japoneses (3 contos)Quanto ao primeiro conto que em conclusão foi o meu preferido, talvez aquele que eu mais me entreguei revelou-se muito personalizado de uma maneira boa e bonita, tanto como os espaços, sentimentos e personagensO segundo conto achei muito confuso pelo facto, também de eu estar a querer estabelecer uma ligação com a história anteriore o terceiro conto foi também muito satisfatório de se ler e ao mesmo tempo inquietante
Pasiunea pentru animale, plante, iubiri, singurătăţi, război.
رواية جميلة، اعتقد بداية جيّدة لي مع الادب الياباني..استمتعت بالرواية لكن م جذبتني لأن قصتها مو مثيرة بجد! بس اقدر اقول ان كتابة بعض التفاصيل والاحداث بالرواية يقدر يخليك تسوي لها مانجا براسك من صنعك انت
I originally read Kawabata's story "The Dancing Girl of Izu" about an year ago as a separate work from this particular book.
However, when I read this story, I wasn't in the mood for that sort of thing.
I also have a feeling that Kawabata's other works have the same sort of style, so while he is a good writer, I'll get back to him specifically when I want that kind of thing again.
That's not really my thing, but some people like that sort of literature, though, and the style was actually pretty good.
The most impressive narrative/short story is "The Dancing Girl of Izu." I never had a passion for Kawabata's work compared to someone like Osamu Dazai, but still, I admire his poetic ability with the narrative.
The beauty of his work (as well as Dazai) is his ability to convey his life as a work of fiction.
Dazai is a huge influence on my writing, with respect that one can use their life, and put it into "Fiction." Kawabata does the same.
My other attraction to "The Dancing Girl of Izu" is that the island Izu Oshima is mentioned throughout that short story.
This collection of short stories by Kawabata Yasunari demonstrates his meticulous attention to detail.
The Dancing Girl of Izu and Other Stories are an exquisite blend of artistry and imagination.
The popular title story, set in a rustic landscape between sea, mountain and sky, The Dancing Girl of Izu is beautiful look into the world of a dancing troupe and their customs of work, rest and play.Kawabata, the first Japanese novelist to win the Nobel Prize is more like a sculptor than a painter, in that he takes away rather than adds.
His style is ever so delicate, like the sakura that bloom in spring.
The mystifying aspect of the book is perhaps lost entirely to poor translation.
I enjoyed bits and parts of the book where I felt the translator's sentences did justice to what the author was saying.
Japanese literary mindset is one which holds beauty and mystery quite similar to the literary culture of Latin America but this unfortunately could not emanate from this collection of semi-autobiographical short stories.
Many times the stories seem vague in themselves, most ending abruptly much to my annoyance.
Only the author's relationship with his grandfather invoked emotions in me and that too just lasted the first few pages of the book.
The Dancing Girl of Izu", (Japanese: 伊豆の踊り子, izu no odoriko) published in 1926, was the first work of literature by Japanese author Yasunari Kawabata to achieve great popular and critical acclaim.
The short story was first translated into English by Edward Seidensticker and published in an abridged form in The Atlantic Monthly in 1952.
Martin Holman and appeared in a collection of Kawabata's early literature published as The Dancing Girl of Izu and Other Stories.The story has been filmed several times in Japan, including one version starring Momoe Yamaguchi.Today, part of the story's name, odoriko ("dancing girl") is used as the name of express trains to the Izu area.Retrieved from "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Danc..."
Real rating: 7/10A collection of short stories by the great Kawabata.
Through these pages the reader meets the picturesque melancholy of being that is Kawabata's work, his rhythmic poetic flow cascades through out and offers to us the realisation that death, love, and sex all ride the same lines.
From the opening pages of the dancing girl we are brought into this world where the philosophical nature of being is brought to light.
This is a lovely semi-autobiographical tale from a man who dare not finish a story in case it burdens the piece with the inauthenticity of fiction.
Real rating: 9.8/10This story may not be Kawabata's legacy or his great masterpiece, but it is Kawabata doing what he does best. The tale of a man uncertain with his life going to onsens. The writing and prose is an imagists dream and it flows with a simplistic structure that drives home the reality of all those involved in the tale. It is reality or as close to it as fiction can be before it drifts off into the doldrums of overly stylized journalism, that ironically bears only the faintest hints of truth.
This was a Christmas present from a friend, that is, I don't usually read this kind of books so I can't compare it to a better one. For me it was a five star. In a very close personal manner you get to know the simple, ordinary workings of a student, of an old wife, of an abandoned lover, of a young wife who lived in innocence, and a naive girl who never knew she'd been in love, of countless other people that you see through the narrator's mind's eye.
