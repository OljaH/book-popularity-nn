not a review and there probably won't be one any time soon. i also won't be climbing Mount Everest in the near future. but here are some cool illustrations that i found and want to share.          World of the Ring by Jian Guo
These criticisms further suggest, at least to me, that the archetypal source of all fantasy's entrenched racism -- even those books being written today -- is The Lord of the Rings.
I love it because of its place in my personal mythology, its genuine originality, its creativity, its power, but I love it with my mind open to its flaws, and I refuse to make excuses for Tolkien or his work.Twenty-five years ago I'd have given The Lord of the Rings my highest possible praise.
What makes LOTR a unique book, and one of the most ambitious experiments in literary history, is Tolkien's use of names.
All authors knows how important names are, and use them to suggest character; though when you think about what is going on, it is rather surprising how much can be conveyed just by a name.
The interrelations between all the invented names and languages make Middle-Earth feel real, in a way no other fantasy world ever has.
It’s the best I can do, though I know many goodreads users share my difficulty when reviewing this book.
You can learn all that there is to know about their ways in a month, and yet after a hundred years they can still surprise you at a pinch.” They carry with them the key to destroying the dark.
And Middle-Earth no longer needs such a figure, darkness is now on her doorstep; it is no longer hidden.
So Middle-Earth needs a man (or Istari) with far sight that can unite the scattered forces of Rohan and manipulate events in order to ensure that the King does, indeed, return.
Look at thisss, hobbitses! Not bought at flea market for ten francses. Catalogue says worth seven hundred dollarses. Oh yes, Not knows about bookses, gollum. But can't touch, can't read, she says too valuable. Going to eat fish instead, but nice birthday present, oh yes precious.
I love all the earlier ones too like Verne and Carrol and CS Lewis but The Hobbit and The Lord Of The Rings its like an institution.🐯👍Who else, besides me, has the notion that the real hero in the Lord Of The Rings story is Sam?
Sam is the typical accidental hero.
Sam is you and me and represents the courage we all have inside of us.

Three thousand years after the defeat of the Dark Lord Sauron before the slopes of Mount Doom, a magic ring falls into the care of Frodo Baggins, a young hobbit from the Shire.
A story starting, as the stories often do, with 'once upon a time'...Once upon a time, there was a little boy who have never read a fantasy book.
The one day he discovered this huge brick called The Lord of the Rings, and started reading it.
And none of them could ever hope to compare to what was still the boy’s favourite book.Later that little boy would grow up to become a man (though he probably never will grow up completely, mind you).
I tried to read this part of the book once, but DNF it then.
Then I picked up the trilogy bound in one volume and went through it fairly steadily.I've read that Tolkien wasn't as original as first claimed.
There is a book called The Broken Sword that has parallels with LotR.
The Eddas, the Welsh myths, and Norse myths all are the foundation for this great story.This was a reread and was a satisfactory one because I wanted to reach my favorite parts.
I had a lot of fun reading LoTR, and I've not yet deleted it from my Ereader because I'm tempted to reread it soon.
For those who are familiar with the great and influential fantastical authors, from Ovid and Ariosto to Eddison and Dunsany to R.E. Howard and Fritz Leiber, it is clear that, long before Tolkien, fantasy was already a complex, well-established, and even a respected literary genre.Eddison's work contains an invented world, a carefully-constructed (and well-researched) archaic language, a powerful and unearthly queen, and a central character who is conflicted and lost between the forces of nobility and darkness.
Bulgarian review below/Ревюто на български е по-долу The pilgrimage of Frodo, Sam and their fellows lasted for a year, and it happened so that it took me nearly as long to see them home to the Shire. Well, people say good things happen slowly, so I don’t regret the journey one bit.Something crosses my mind that Terry Pratchett has shared in ‘A Slip of the Keyboard‘. He was 12 or 13 when he read ‘The Lord of the Rings’ for the first time. His parents left him at some neighbors’ house to babysit

One of the greatest trilogies of all time and certainly the measuring stick to which all subsequent fantasy-style writing is compared, The Lord of the Rings trilogy still stands at the top of the stack. Its realism, the characters and monsters, the storyline, the epic battles, and the quest motif are all drawn with incredible care by Tolkien in his chef d'oeuvre. My favorite was The Two Towers but all three are absolutely stunning. It has been a few decades since I read them so perhaps this year I will have to journey back to Middle Earth once again.
I need to mention that I will not bother hiding any spoilers as I have trouble believing any modern person living in civilized enough parts of the world to have internet access has not read this one or at least has not seen the movies – which for all their faults were decent, but I am not talking about that abomination called the movie version of The Hobbit.For the very brief synopsis of the plot I will quote Brandon Sanderson’s brilliant description from his Alcatraz series.
494. The Lord of The Rings (The Lord of the Rings #1-3), J.R.R. (John Ronald Reuel) TolkienThe Lord of the Rings is an epic high fantasy novel written by English author and scholar J. R. R. Tolkien. The story began as a sequel to Tolkien's 1937 fantasy novel The Hobbit, but eventually developed into a much larger work. Written in stages between 1937 and 1949, The Lord of the Rings is one of the best-selling novels ever written, with over 150 million copies sold.The title of the novel refers to t

Tolkien's work is the fullest realization of literary world building ever penned.It is also sophisticated writing, drawing on older forms (epic, romance, tragedy).
So, what Tolkien foregoes in terms of dialogue he replaces with style and action: a classic example of show not tell.Having just spouted all that praise, I have to admit that all the criticisms are true: the story does resound with Luddite anti-industrial metaphors, overt Christian themes of salvation and spirit, a structural decision to include songs that doesn't quite work, and fantasy tropes that are now cliche ...
I diligently read every last one, hoping that they held some deep meaning in relation to the story, but if there is one, it is so obscure that it serves no purpose.
Also, the book is all about walking.
Yes, I know they are on an epic quest, and there has to be soul-searching, etc., but the amount of detail regarding the walking is a snoozer!
However, reading this series was a drudgery.
The only really good part that you miss in the movies is when the hobits return to the Shire in the last three chapters of The Return of the King.
When a book defines a genreThere is nothing you can say anymore,That will add or detract from the volumes and volumesOf all that has been said before:So a book review I'm not attempting,Though the GR site is sorely tempting;Just paying my respects from the bottom of my heartAnd raising my hat to the Master of the Art.
My first read through the series occurred during my high school years and, I’m sad to say, was not very enjoyable.
I saw the movies before reading the series and I think this did much to set my expectations up for an entirely different type of story-telling.
In the last few months my husband and I played through Lego Lord of the Rings and it got me to thinking that maybe now, after getting both a bachelor’s and master’s degree in English literature, I’d be ready to read through the series again with an open mind.
The BBC Big Read says it's the #1 novel ever, beating out the likes of Pride & Prejudice, Jane Eyre, and Harry Potter. Who am I to argue, it certainly was my first and favorite in the realm of fantasy literature. As an adult I've come to appreciate the traditional novel's more, from writers like the Bronte's, Jane Austen, Charles Dickens, and others. But the mysterious and magical land and inhabitants of Middle Earth will always have a welcome spot in my heart and mind.
This is the entire, epic Lord of the Rings trilogy. Tolkien created an imaginative and incredibly detailed world with an unforgettable struggle between good and evil, played out on so many different levels, and in different ways with various characters. It's not necessarily an easy read - Tolkien can get a little dry at times - but there's so much richness and depth to it.*sigh* I really need to reread this sometime soon ...
If you're into stuff like this, you can read the full review.Christological Sacrifices: "The Lord of the Rings Trilogy" by TolkienIt is not really possible to re-read a book, just as it is not really possible to step into the same river twice.
The next time, one's thinking is going to be entirely different.
I have read "LoTR" half a dozen times.
I think Heraclitus even said you couldn't step into the same river even once.
I was already a silent reader of proper books from the Praça de Chile Library and could read the scheme books a dozen times before I was called.
(and I've now put this review in the correct order so the newest bits are at the bottom)THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING: BOOK ONEFour hobbits, two men, one elf, one dwarf and a wizard.
In fact it has taken me longer to read the book than it did for the whole journey to take place and I am no slouch on the page turning front.THE RETURN OF THE KING: BOOK FIVESo now the Fellowship is well and truly torn asunder and even all the squeaking hobbits have been effectively separated, albeit it for a short while.
One book to rule them all.
Whenever my environment had failed to support or nourish me, I clutched at books…-Richard Wright, Black Boy If you want a purely enraptured detailing all of and only of love provoked by these pages, look elsewhere. If you desire an analysis of the fundamental roots of fantasy and how this book fits in within the wider scope of the literary genre, it is not here. If you crave a complete and utter breakdown of all the faults this novel begets on the larger realm of reality, you will be unsatisfie
What I loathe and utterly despise is the poisonous formation of sides when it comes this book and indeed any work of literature, a refusal to consider a book as a mix of both good and bad that can never be fully or easily reconciled in the mind of those insistent on thinking in terms of black and white.
The author created this world out of a passionate love for language and all its myriad veins of influence in the cultures it births and the land it names, and its lengthy prose and detailed care set the stage for my confident desire to discover further works of literature, no matter how long in script or difficult in absorption.
My anniversary date celebration consisted of booze, books and groceries.
I saw my precious and nothing was going to stop me from making it my own, especially not commonsense.My reading stretched on for weeks on end and every day the book got heavier and more cumbersome (if you aren’t singing 7M3 right now then you can’t call yourself my friend).
I was Frodo and the tote became my Sam. Without my durable new friend I would have been miserable and it would have taken me a hell of a lot longer to finish one of the best stories I have read in a while.
Iako jeste svakako malo lošije omatereo - nije više to ta griva kose, plus hoda malčice nakrivo pa mu džaba što je visok 2m - što se najviše ogleda u uštogljenom dijalogu, ovo je i dalje potpuno fascinantno štivo sa više tačaka gledišta, ali ona glavna, sa koje se vide sve ostale, svakako je svet.
Jer Srednja Zemlja ima potporu bar koliko i ova naša (ako se pravimo da to nisu dve iste zemlje – kao što sam Tolkin reče, „Srednja Zemlja je ništa drugo do naša matična planeta – ali u drugoj eri mašte“), što je upravo ono što isparava sa stranice.
I was forced to read this book.
Each member of my first book club had an opportunity to choose the book we read.
When one of the members chose The Lord of the Rings I was not happy.
Fantasy is not my genre!
But I was a good book club member and read it anyway.I loved it!
There were times when I did not want to sleep because I wanted to finish just one more page or chapter.
Tolkien creates whole worlds, languages, species, and histories.
Somehow he manages to entertain, make you think, and visualize the world he describes.
It first spoke to me when my fantastic fifth grade teacher chose The Fellowship of the Ring for our classroom reading period, and I've never looked back.There are curiosities that abound within the trilogy, not least in that the opening chapters of The Fellowship of the Ring would not be out of place as a direct sequel to The Hobbit, whereas by the time we have reached Rivendell, the entire tone of the book has been altered: become more adult, more serious and darker, possessed of a sense of finality and portents of an end to wondrous things that comes to permeate the remainder of this questing original.
There will always be a degree of this, yet I perceive that readers look for works which contain at their heart a story and characters that appeal to them.
Interestingly Moorcock mentions Watership Down at the same time as discussing The Lord of the Rings and both books are strong because they have characters which touch the reader.
In the tea garden at the bottom of the abyss - to use Moorcock's metaphor then...What I am essentially arguing is that superficially The Lord of the Rings is nothing more than a silly idea.
Like the truth that life feels like a big battle that can be lost if you don't muster up some courage for the fight; or the truth that there is an evil force out there that seems very real and seeks to destroy us and will do so unless somehow we find the greater force that wants to live; and this other one: that you are blessed if you can find a friend or two to help you along the way.
We read books for all kinds of reasons but the best reason to read is our deep hunger for words that will help us find a way in our lostness.
You try to flee them by hiding in a disused warehouse under a soiled mattress in the Democratic Republic of Congo, but Frodo and his friends will find you eventually and pull you into their lair of medieval gimps called Bilbo and Bongo on an implausibly long and homoerotic quest for a misplaced ring.
This whole quest could have been avoided!
Since the creation of Dungeons & Dragons and the games it spawned I have been on countless pointless quests for rings.
How dare you, Lord of the Rings, invade my cultural happy place so brutally, you ubiquitous beardy bastard?
