Lots of teasing and I'm not sure how I feel about the ending (definitely, not happy!).
huh?He left her at the movies after all the cards she made him? That was my 6 year olds response.
Well I needed a book from 1980 for a challenge, and it's Valentine's Day, so figured why not. But the ending????? When the kids say, ummmm what???? Well......*Challenge: A book that came out the year yo were born*
Just a whole story about kids feeling anxious and making each other feel bad. If Lord of the Flies took place on Valentine's Day.
2nd installment of the Grandparent/Grandbaby book club.The ending made me laugh.
This book is a funny ("hey hot lips"), holiday mystery, and I know I can count on entertainment from Arthur every time.
“Arthur’s Valentine” is another classic book from Marc Brown’s legendary “Arthur” series.
“Arthur’s Valentine” is a cute book about the trials of having your first love interest that will make children feel all cuddly inside themselves.Marc Brown has done it again at both illustrating and writing this book about the trials of puppy love.
Marc Brown’s story is cute and bittersweet at the same time as we sympathize with Arthur trying desperately to get Sue Ellen to notice him.
Arthur’s Adventures has always been one of my favorite series but sadly this book is not one of my favorites.
The overall story is cute and would get some giggles from a young group of kids.
My biggest problem with this story is that there really is no lesson taught to young children who pick up this book.
There is some bullying and teasing in this book and it’s never resolved or even pointed out that it’s bad.
If Mark Brown had changed the ending and the overall moral to this story I would have enjoyed it much more and it would be a better learning experience for kids.
Moreover, the book clearly boasts a vividly inspired creativity that will appeal that will appeal to the imaginations of a younger student audience and features illustrations that support comprehension of the characters, story and setting occupying a majority of the page.Bookshelf Mentor Writing Ideas:-Sentence Fluency: The text of Arthur’s Valentine showcases a variety of sentence structures: simple and complex; dialogue and narration.
The writing also features especially rhythmic passages in the poems and love letters.
Classroom Integration: When students finally begin attempting to write their own stories involving dialogue, this story can be used as an example of the proper style and conventions used.
Arthur keeps getting letters from his secret admirer, and he cannot figure out who it is. He thinks it is Sue-Ellen, but when he sends her a valentines letter she laughs at him and makes fun of him. The secret admirer sets up a surprise movie date for them.... he still cannot figure out who it is. I thought this book was cute, and liked the bright colors. The font was also really cute.I would use this in my class to read to elementary students on valentines day just as a fun read to have in class for giggles.
My children love these little books. They thoroughly enjoy each and every story, as if they are all unique and individual without any cause for similarity among them. Even though sometimes, they might seem tedious and repetitive to me as a parent, I do enjoy being able to read short-stories to my children that are clean and respective.
Copyright 1980. The illustrations in my copy are from that date. I see he's updated them to look more like the tv show. This was one we always read around Valentine's Day. The text is simple & not too wordy, so it was a good before bed book. The end was goofy.
Really awesome book! I love My daughter loves this story. It is a bit short , but really sweet. Reading this story brings back my childhood days; especially with the little crushes we used to have as kids
It's a very nice book.It's so funny. I like this book because it teaches us to love one other.💟💞👄💋❤💙💚💛💜💕💖💗💘💝💏💑👬👫
Sweet bookMy kids loved this book and my youngest immediately shouted "do that one again!" I do wish they left out the teasing though.
Marc Brown's books were always a part of my library when I was first reading, and I think I read almost all of them growing up. Arthur was always someone I could connect to because like him, I wasn't always the "cool" kid. This story is just another great lesson about love and friendship.
A really cute read. I adore the Arthur series and his adventures. This story is about Arthur who keeps getting letters from a secret admirer right before valentines day. He can't seem to find out who it is, but he really hopes it's the new girl in class. In the end he meets his secret admirer and there is such a cute picture for the ending page. This would be cute to read to kids around valentines day. I think for youngsters they can really relate to it.
The illustrations are a bit strange.Do they always use the t.v. animation images on the book covers?
It is strange that they use the cartoon images on the covers when the illustration are different on the inside.
I really liked the way Arthur was rendered because he looked much more like an aardvark.
We always used to remark how t.v. Arthur looked more like a hamster.
I really liked the way Buster was drawn, too, but Francine looks horrible.
A couple of the other secondary characters faces were misshapen, too.
This story is from Arthur the TV show. If you or your children enjoy the show this may be for them. While this book is a Valentine's Day book is does not have much love other than Arthur wanting Sue Ellen to be his secret admirer and then his secret admirer sending him cards. It does have kids picking on one another for liking another and instead of thanking others for their Valentine they laugh and make fun. There is a lot of rejection as well in this book. Lastly, the picture are terrible.
He had several people in mind, but he hoped it would be Sue Ellen.
The day before Valentine’s Day, Buster made a card for Sue Ellen to give to her.
I remember reading author book when I was young.
I found by reading this book that they had much the same issues as girls and it helped me relate to my fellow classmates easier.
Almost the entire book is fully colored unlike many.
The book deals with serious issues facing children today.
When reading it, the audience becomes intrigued by the mystery of who has been writing the letters to author.
I love reading the Arthur's Adventure Series by Marc Brown to my daughters when they were younger. The story was really cute. A great story to read on Valentine's Day.
Arthur is savage at the end. But I like to think it he laughed from afar about the prank and then ran back to sit with Francine
Arthur’s Valentine Marc BrownsArthur starts getting secret admirer letters around Valentines Day at school.
He starts getting embarrassed and thinks they are from his crush in his classroom.
To me, Arthur is a joyful read for any age of readers.
I will always love to read Arthur books because I grew up on them.
I would use this book in my classroom during valentines.
I will for sure contain a variety of Arthur books in my classroom in the future to have enjoyable reads for my students to have.
Through the entire book the reader is left in suspense as Arthur tries to find out who his secret Valentine’s Day admirer is.
Furthermore, the reader is launched into Arthur’s thoughts as he receives a secret valentine day after day.
Arthur secretly hopes that his valentine is the new girl “Sue Ellen”, he even suspects that it is actually her and sends her a love note of his own.
Near the end of the book however, the mystery of the secret valentine is finally revealed.
I may use this book to read during story time in preparation for or on Valentine’s Day as a fun read.
Someone was sending Arthur valentines cards, but he couldn’t figure out who.
Arthur made Sue Ellen a valentine, who he hoped was sending him valentines, and all of his friends made fun of him again.
Arthur goes to the movies to meet Francine, and ends up leaving her with just a box of kisses.
I would use this book to teach my students that making fun of other people is not okay, and that giving out Valentines is normal.
Arthur finds out that Francine is the one who has sent him multiple Valentines, and ends up leaving her alone at the movies.
One of the early Arthur books as well as the debut of Sue Ellen, whom I had a crush on when I was younger...Anyway, it's Valentine's Day and someone is sending Arthur Valentines.
As for who's sending Arthur his valentines...read the book to find out.The art is still primitive compared to the later entries, but it's getting better as Marc Brown really is developing these characters.
Plus, Arthur's hometown has a folksy charm that you don't see in the more urban depiction of Elwood City from the acclaimed PBS series.Not a great Arthur book, but still a good one.
Valentines day come once a year so it makes sense that Arthur would have a experience as well.
This book is about Arthur finding a valentines in his locker.
The Valentines does not show who it is from so it turns out that Arthur has a secret admirer.
This book would be terrible in the classroom.
Also this encourages kids to start to have crushes on each other, even if the age is not right to have crushes.
This also give the kids ideas to send secret notes to a person they have a "crush" on and cause drama in the classroom.
Arthur's Valentine is a story about how he was getting valentines before it was even Valentine's Day. Arthur was hoping it was the new girl, Sue Ellen.
Sue Ellen was not too thrilled that the card that Arthur gave her caused everyone to laugh at Arthur.
When he got home he received another letter that had a movie ticket inside that his secret admirer wanted him to come to the movies.
Francine turned out to be Arthur's secret admirer in the end!
This would be a great book to read to children who love the Arthur books or keep on there own personal little shelves.
At the beginning of the book, Arthur was getting Valentine's from a secret admirer.
He didn't know who it was.
He got notes in his lunchbox.
He thought it may be Sue Ellen, who he had a crush on so he made her a special card.
Arthur's friends made fun of him for making the card for her.
When Sue Ellen opened her card from Arthur, she couldn't believe Arthur wrote her that mushy letter.
Everyone began to laugh.
It ended up that it was Francine that left the love letter.
In the end Arthur left Francine hershey kisses.
