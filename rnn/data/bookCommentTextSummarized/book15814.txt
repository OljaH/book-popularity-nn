The end was such a surprise.
I wasn't expecting it.
The kids have read this before and they didn't spoil the ending funny enough.
They laughed at me and my surprise.
Our book is old and it still work.
It creates quite and effect.I love Eric Carle's work and this is a beautiful book.
The Firefly looking for his people reminds me of the Ugly duckling.
Where does he belong in this world.
The Ugly duckling is much more complex.
This book still does a nice job with that idea of 'Where do I belong?'The Kids also gave this 5 stars.
How have I never read this classic picture book before now?
I absolutely love the end of this with the light up part showing all the fireflies it was a pleasant surprise and the kiddo loved it.
My son liked this one and I hated it. He had like a gazillion million questions while we were reading it which is the last thing I want to do when I'm trying to get a talkative rambunctious toddler to go to sleep. So it's definitely a daytime book when I'm ready for so many questions :)
Very cute book. As an adult though, I bought it more for the fascination of the book mechanic's, to check out the twinkle-lights built into the back cover of the book.

A lonely firefly meanders through the night looking for others of its kind. Will it ever find them?This book gave me a legit *gasp* moment when I reached the last page at the library. It's a fun surprise and a great little story along the way. I don't always love each and every illustration but the style is undeniably unique and appealing.

Beautiful book! Love the final page with all the blinking fireflies! Eric Carle's books are magic!
A firefly is born and takes its first flight into the night sky searching for his friends.
On his journey, he spots many bright lights, but they all turn out to be man created light sources and not his friends at all.
This makes the firefly even more lonely than he was at the beginning.
He interacts with animals, children, and cars trying to find others still, even falling for fireworks in the great distance.
The firefly searched and searched until it finally found the other fireflies with their lights flashing gently in the darkness.
(The book actually had light up bugs too, so that was special)
The Very Lonely Firefly by Eric Carle starts off with a scene of the sun setting and becoming night time.
The book brings in the main character, the lonely firefly.
The lonely firefly is flying through the night trying to find someone that has the same light as he does.
What caught my eye about this book was how interactive the illustrations and small texts on each page interplayed with each other.
The book itself has amazing illustrations and interacting small bubble texts throughout the story.
I read The Very Lonely Firefly as a young adult and I recommend this book to an early reader.
What we love about this book:-Common urban animal (firefly) as main character.-The art is special and interesting, but not confusing.-Carle's collage technique can be used to inspire collage-making (cutting and pasting).-Lots of smart, deliberate repetition of key words, phrases, and story patterns help children track what's happening, motivating them to attend.
I believe kids feel secure (safe even) and proud of themselves when they can anticipate the next line.-Carle signals to children when the book is about to transition to an ending by slightly deviating from the story's format to help them anticipate what's coming.
The little firefly keeps seeing lights, but they end up not being other fireflies.
At the end, the little firefly finally finds other fireflies and he is not lonely anymore.
This is a story that children will enjoy and remember for years to come!Author and Illustrator: Eric CarleAudience: K-1stGenre: Fictional Picture BookTheme: Belonging	In the words of Eric Carle, “ The Very Lonely Firefly is about belonging.
We all want to belong to a group, a family, our own follow creatures.”Illustration: Eric Carle is a very unique artist and this is brought to life in this particular picture book.
Well, I've seen the back of this book before, but hadn't read it.
And as I like fireflies, the subject of the book got to me.
But not my favorites.But who can not like blinking fireflies at the end?!And in honor, here was the song we women sang in Sound of America 2000:Ho, ho, hotaru koi, atchi no mizu wa nigai zo, kot-chi no mizu wa amai zo, ho ho hotari koi, ho, ho, yama michi koi.Hotaru no otosan kanamochi da,do ri de oshiriga pikapika da.
ho ho hotari koi, ho, ho, yama michi koi.Hiruma wa kusaba no tsuyu no kage, yoru wa ponpon, taka chochin.
When a little firefly is born at dusk, he finds that he is alone and lonely, flashing his lights to find other fireflys.
Soon, the very lonely firefly goes out into the night searching for other fireflies, it sees many things that light up such as a lantern, a candle, and the eyes of a dog, cat, and owl all glowing in the darkness.
But still there are no fireflies But it is not until it discovers other fireflies that it finds exactly what it's looking for-- friends, and lots and lots of glowing firefliles.
Kids will love it.
He searches out different sources of light hoping he will find more friends.
This book is a great way to introduce the science of light.
I think it would be great to introduce all types of different lights and to pair it with live demonstrations while reading of some of the sources (i.e. flashlight, reflection, lantern).
It would be great to discuss how sometimes we may be lonely and friends can help us feel better sometimes.
This topic is important for all young children, especially those that are just entering preschool and may feel lonely when they are away from their family for the first time.
What was really interesting about this book was the dedication in the from cover by Eric Carle about it books and making a series of stories.
It would make for good points when using the books with kids."quote"Dear Friends,After THE VERY HUNGRY CATERPILLAR had been published I wanted to create a VERY quartet.
With this book I have achieved that goal.1) THE VERY HUNGRY CATERPILLAR is about "hope".
Crickets and people alike search for and hope to find a suitable mate.4) THE VERY LONELY FIREFLY is about "belonging".
We all want to belong to a group, a family, our own fellow creatures.I hope you like my firefly.Sincerely,Eric Carle.

The pictures are spectacular and the final page where he find the fireflies all the tails light up.Age appropriateness 0-4Connection to six early literacy skills - I think this book hits all of these early literacy skills		Print Motivation - it is an engaging story and you want to find out what happens to the firefly		Vocabulary - lots of different light sources are used and it gives children the change to think of each light source.
Still couldn't find other fireflies like him.
I know if the end the fireflies were supposed to light up when the book was opened to the last page but the batteries had probably been long dead or broke.
I know that this is supposed to be good but I wasn't as impressed as I should have been.
Mr. Carle still uses his amazing skills with paint and paper to create stunning pictures that drive the imagination of the all the children who read have read and admire his books.
I might have loved this book if the story had been as good as the pictures.
In this book a lonely firefly is looking for another firefly by following around different sources of light.
He first spots a lightbulb through a window, hoping that it was another firefly.
He then spots a candle and flashlight and is once again disappointed that it is not another firefly.
He continues to follow around different sources of light until he finds a group of fireflies and is no lonely.
I believe that the major theme of the book is to never give up.
He did not give up he found what he was looking for.
I can relate to this book now.
However, there is a big problem--this firefly is lonely, and doesn't think it will be too great to tour the world alone.
So, as the firefly is traveling, he stops and recruits friends on the way (different groups of animals).
Once the firefly isn't so lonely anymore with his travel companions, he sets off on his journey to see the world.
Thus, the animals no longer want to journey around the world and go back home.
The Very Lonely Firely continues his journey to find a whole group of other fireflies that he fits in with--he's not so lonely anymore!!
Personal Reaction- I like this book a lot because the story is very cute and also presents something new to students.
Some of the things in the book may be new to students.
The story also keeps children guessing because it asks about different lights that could be seen outside at night and distinguishes them from a firefly.
I loved this book as a kid and I think others will too!Purposes- I would read this aloud to kindergarten students for several purposes:-exposure to new insects and possibly some other vocabulary-enrichment/enjoyment due to the story and illustrationsCurriculum: read aloud-possibly used for insect unit-could possibly be used as a more advanced beginning to read bookOverall, I think that this book is very beneficial to students in many ways and I think that it is one that many young students should read.
I honestly, think this story would be good read a loud book for children in the classroom.
I would personally use this book at the beginning of Kindergarten, because the language is simple.
The book does include some larger vocabulary words, which would help stretch a Kindergartener’s vocabulary.
This book would be good to use if I were introducing a topic about firefly’s and how they communicate through their light signals.
I could also use this book to help teach determination, because the very lonely firefly was determined to find his friends.
The last in Eric Carle's quartet of 'Very', The Very lonely Firefly is about belonging.
"We all want to belong to a group, a family, our own fellow creatures." – Eric Carle.This is a lovely book to read aloud to an individual child or group.
It was a...'For Australian children, who will guess 'torch' instead of 'flashlight', I alter the reading to suit and explain the nuances of varying English-speaking peoples.
For example, when the dog goes 'Bow Wow' I ask, 'What do Australian dogs say?'The book I borrowed from the library had flashing lights on the last page which brought the fireflies to life for the listeners.
This book is full of repetition.
This would be a good science lesson book.
You could teach children the different light sources.
There are similarities in this book; the firefly was trying to find another firefly but found different light sources instead.
Emotions are another concept from the book, all the firefly wanted to do was try to find other firefly's to fly with.Learning Experience:In this learning experience the kids would be put in groups of two.
I would bring in flash lights and turn the lights out.
The kids would then have to sort through the other groups to find their partner.
PB16: I love Eric Carle picturebooks.
I love how his illustrations are different than most other illustrators.
I am not sure exactly what he does but the pictures appear to be collages, and they are rough pictures, the lines aren't always straight, faces tend to be boxy, but they work for this book.
The best part of this book, without question, is the last page where the lonely firefly finds all his firefly friends and they all light up with real little bulbs!
As a child that was so exciting to reach the final page!
This book The Very Lonely Firefly is a great children's book.
As the book goes on its the firefly trying to find other fireflies that sines like him.
The firefly runs into different light sources like a lightbulb,candle,flashlight and many more things.
I love the ending of this book because it actually shows the light from the fireflies.
This book has simple illustrations but they go along perfectly with the story.
I would like to read this book as a bedtime story because its calming;its not too long or short.
Overall The Very Lonely Firefly is a book that all children would enjoy.

Carle, E. (1995). The very lonely firefly. New York, NY: Philomel Books.A firefly is looking for someone who looks like him. He sees an owl, a lantern, animals' eyes and even fireworks. All of these have bright lights but none match him. He is lonely and wants someone to share with. Just as he's about to give up, he finds what he's been looking for. Like other Eric Carle books, this book is bright, colorful, and has surprises. It captures the eyes and the imagination. It is designed for infants to approximately 5 years old.
This battery operated engineered book tells the story of a lonely firefly who runs into different sources of light (a candle, a flashlight, a lightbulb) as she searches for other fireflies. At the end of the story, the firefly finds a group of fireflies and the reader can push a button on the last page making all the fireflies light up. Great story to read in the dark with a flashlight. As a follow-up activity the teacher can read a nonfiction book about fireflies and have students create a poster listing some of the facts.
