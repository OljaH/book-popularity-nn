Always love Dale Carnegie's books.
This book contains content blended from two Dale Carnegie books: "How to Win Friends and Influence People" and "How to Stop Worrying and Enjoy Life." I'd already read "How to Win Friends" less than a year ago, so the content was relatively fresh in my mind and it seemed like the majority of this book contains content from that volume.
I really enjoy the pieces that were from "How to Stop Worrying" and I'll need to add that book to my list, because I would have liked to have more of it within this book.

wonderfulllll its really nice.
Teaches you important things about life through simple, everyday stories.
Maybe if you don't like your job, you should change it! (smile) We all have those days, where we don't like the situation we are in. If we are in the right place as far as our job or circumstances, than maybe we need to look at the bright side of things, create a positive attitude, and go from there.
This is actually quite good.
Cerita2nya eye catching....
i need to learn how to love my job...
People like to feel they are right and that they know more than you do and unfortunately when you know a lot and you have a very good memory for useless information you find yourself unintentionally correcting people a lot of the time.
Not from a place of believing that you are more superior and therefore right but from a genuine place of wanting to share the information you’ve acquired in life to benefit the other person; hence why I was drawn to become a teacher.
It would have greatly benefited from more direct application to life and to a job rather than specific examples of dealing with people as the other book had that covered already.
I'll give 4 stars because few of the things in this novel gets repeated with other novels authored by Dale like How to win friends and influence people, The leader in you, etc.Coming to the content of the book, it's very palatable and easy to read and understand.
Most of the incidents mentioned are the real one and helped Dale in his personal life.After reading this book your life and job won't be changed from monotonous, boring movie into thrilling, entertaining masala movie...but this novel will definitely help you to change your perspective and teach you few life-saving hacks to enjoy your life and job!
Ein großartiges und sehr motivierendes Buch 👍
Dale's book is the masterpiece.
One time reading is not enough to make it into practice.
He is like my rich father who teaches me about how I can improve my leadership with people.
As I continue the book, I could see I have made many mistakes in addressing people.
Sure, everyone doesn't like taking order, they like saving their face in public, being encouraged and empowered.
I really appreciated people who have stayed and worked with me so far.
Although I made many mistakes in leading them, they still tolerate my fault.
I will use Dale technique to improve myself.
As most of people do job for living, maximum number of people goes to their offices or workstations to work may be much industrious so that it payback more bucks which may fulfill their amenities and additional needs even though the job is not much interesting.
This book pours ideal solutions to make a dull job interesting to save more time in office and to spend the saved time with your sweetheart or family.
As I am going to start my career within a week I picked this book to read to find what kind of solutions are penned to enjoy the job as well as life.
I previously read, though didn't finish, How to Win Friends and Influence People, so I knew I liked Dale Carnegie's casual writing style and very much agreed with his advice.
But much of this book is made up of excerpts from How to Win Friends, so it was a bit redundant for me.
I also questioned the advice more on this read than on my previous one, which is largely because of the advice of Nice Girls Don't Get the Corner Office.
I suppose some middle path between the books is the right balance.
There's probably more overlap than there is disagreement.
Only if I had the choice of introducing a mandatory course in our school, college or unis or even at workplace, I would make learning to "live well with People" a mandatory course and Dale Carnnegie , the master trainer. Don't get confused with the silly titles of his books, no book has actually made me understand the human as good as that. It's highly recommended to all yo professional and executives out there who are genuinely interested in relationship management, in and outside the workplace. The book would even change the perspective on your personal relations as well.
This is selections from How to Win Friends and Influence People and How to Stop Worrying and Start Living. Basically the condensed versions in order to cash in on Dale Carnegie's popularity and as a quick introduction to some of the concepts. A bit dated in some of the ways things are presented, I'm more used to less verbiage from this sort of book, but otherwise quite readable.Interesting view of how teaching other people well can reflect well on your work and home life.
Most of the content is from Dale Carnegie's 'How to Stop Worrying and Star Living' and 'How to Win Friends & Influence People'. If you have already read those two, I suggest you to skip this book.But it's a short book and reading those anecdotes on famous people including Abraham Lincoln, one more time, can only help.~ThatLeo.com
Knjiga nije kompatibilna sa nasim mentalitetom i zivotnim navikama. Postoji dosta dobrih saveta i poucnih primera koje bi trebalo zapamtiti,medjutim,nisu jasni niti upecatljivi na prvo citanje. Svakako preporucujem,jer nismo svi isti.
This was a great book that combines the lessons from the How to Win Friends and Start Influencing People & the How To Stop Worrying & Start Living book.
Always trying to look at things from that person's perspectives and ensuring they get what they want is key as why would someone be motivated for your own objectives vs.
Another great one is never giving orders as if you can show someone why they should want to do something for their own benefit then they will be much more motivated to do whatever that thing is that you are asking of them.
All of us will facing a real work life environment.
Where there's a lot of tiredness, complaining, worry and resentment.
But in this chapter Dale Carnegie had told us how to banish boredom that produces all this kind of fatigue, worry and resentment which will produce uncomfortable feeling to do work.
Without we realize we always complaining lack of this and that but sometimes we didn't know that the other have nothing compare, to our life.I love this one quote saying:"I had the blues because I had no shoes, Until upon the street, I met a man who had no feet"Everyone will facing a difficulties in life.
Uno dei libri migliori che abbia mai letto, è anche uno dei libri piu ristampati e letti al mondo, non è solo un libro motivazionale ma anche uno strumento giornaliero per affrontare il lavoro e la vita quotidiana. È un libro ricco di esempi che dovrebbe essere la Bibbia di molti uomini politici italiani (se sapessero leggere) per molti imprenditori italiani (se non vivessero sull assistenza statale o bancaria). Un libro adatto a tutti da tenere sul comodino.
A very good book, as the other ones I've read from the author. It explains in a very positive way how to deal with several aspects of life and one's job. It's quite a useful book because it has lots of examples in which the reader will certainly identify himself, in order to transform (or try to) certain issues for the scope of having a better life.
360 life transforming. I totally suggest that this is a must read... I wish i should have read this long way before.... i have always been a Dale Carnegie's fan. His works are always brilliant. No words could ever describe. #mustread
I love Dale Carnegie writing, as one of my favourite books is "How to stop worrying and start living". Which is probably why I couldn't like " How to enjoy your life and job" as much as I did with the previous one. Overall, nice light book to read.
Very informative. A lot can be learnt about human relationships and dealings. His experiences and examples are worth reading; also, they are tried and tested, so can be used in our own lives to form better bonds with people.
nice
Dope 👍
What I disappoint from this book is, I buy this one without knowing that half of the book was taken from his other works. So, kinda not really inspired me.
