This was a good addition to the series and there was a lot of action but for some reason I expected more with a book with both the weasel and wolf in one book. Ending got crazy though and really added action to the story. The ending brought it from 3.5* to ⭐⭐⭐⭐. Still loving this series. On to Mary, Mary now. My quick and simple overall: quick and entertaining afternoon read. 🐺🐺🐺🐺🐺🐺🐺🐺🐺🐺🐺🐺🐺🐺

As much as I enjoy reading James Patterson, and as much as I am in love with Alex Cross (yes, I admit it), this installment failed to satisfy me.
Even Cross' love life seemed stilted in London Bridges.
London Bridges had me thinking throughout, "enough already with the bombing and killing - and for goodness sake, who is the real Wolf?" My feelings about London Bridges (this one goes into the donation box), however, will not keep me from reading future Patterson/Cross installments.
Bad villains return, but weak terrorist plot not much fun...This is the tenth in Patterson's Detective (now FBI special envoy) Alex Cross series, and from the outset, we would surmise that if you are not a faithful follower of the previous nine, you will be lost.
Couple that with an incredulous plot wherein the Wolf is leading the presidents of four countries around by their noses, almost a trite post-9/11 recital of terror with Al Quida thrown in every few chapters just for effect; it soon becomes clear this is not one of Patterson's better efforts.
Very bad book!
No real plot, things just seem to happen out of nowhere, no connection between the caracters, no real investigation, no twist at the end...
talking about end, what the hell was that??
One of the worst and poorer endings I've ever read!!The sentence in the synopsis: "Then, in the most unforgettable finale James Patterson has ever written, Alex Cross confronts the truth of the Wolf’s identity – a revelation that even Cross himself may be unable to survive." What???
Unforgettable??
Only because it was so bad!
The Wolf identity, Cross will be unable to survive...
In London Bridges Alex has to face two killers that he has yet to catch: the weasel and the wolf.
Then there's the Wolf, who is a mastermind and psychopath, from The Big Bad Wolf.Of course this book delivers mighty good twists and turns that I honestly had no idea were coming.
It was super interesting to see how Alex realized that the Wolf and the Weasel were working together - and that they were really good at it.Some deaths really shocked me in this book because I kept telling myself - like no, they aren't going to die.
I don't know what to do with James Patterson. His prose is amateur (coming from an amateur). His villains are cartoony. The plot just goes whether the protagonist does anything about it or not.And yet I read the whole thing, and am even considering reading another Patterson novel on my shelf. Whatever Patterson sucks at, he's got the "What happens next?" factor down PAT.
Alex was more unbelieveable in this book than others.
The voice-over guy on the audiobook seemed to only change the inflection of his voice, but didn't seem to be able to convey the characters' emotionally.
I'm new to audiobooks so, maybe he wasn't meant to.The Wolf strikes again.
He'll huff and he'll puff and he'll blow the house down.
He actually does this at one point.
This guys seems to have eyes and ears everywhere.
Cross seems to be in the background for the first half of the story, just tagging along.This read was a little thinner than usual with more holes than a king-sized crocheted blanket.It's all good though because I like fast-paced reads.
I was hoping it wasnt going to get worse after Big Bag Wolf - but it did.plot even weaker than BBW, plot has more holes than a cheesegrater - and likely more cheese in it. usual "but im so lovable, i have a hapless lovelife but its not my fault - but i know you'll sleep with me" Cross attitude.All I can say is - James, whichever ghost writer you are using for these books now, shoot them and write about that, it might be more entertaining than your latest offerings.
Another great Cross book! Just when I thought I knew who the Wolf was, things got twisted up and I had to guess again. Not to mention I think Patterson is setting us up for something bad to happen with Nana Mama. I figure she's gonna live forever......so I hope not!
LOVED the twists and turns!!! One of James finest works!!!!
That said, I liked the book, I had a blast reading it ( as always when it comes to Cross books) and it kept me in suspense while adding more pressure to the all ready huge pile of problems.
Cross is back in the hot seat not only trying to find out who this supposed Wolf is but also trying to catch the Weasel, whose slippery ways have kept him from repercussions.
I can't say more, its best reading these without knowing too much, but I'm looking forward to the next installment, titled "Mary Mary" which is supposed to be fantastic.
As if it's not enough that Alex Cross has a plethora of rather vicious bad guys just chomping at the bit to strike back against him, now he has two.
In this novel, we see the return of not just the Wolf from the last Alex Cross novel, but also Geoffrey "Weasel" Shafer from Pop Goes the Weasel.
And both are gunning to not just take down Cross, but bring the world to its knees via total city destruction.
I am so thankful that the Alex Cross books of old seem to be back.
I read this book because it's in my collection, but do not recall anything whatsoever about it. The description of the book might be why. It sounds awful to me and nothing like any book I would ever enjoy. I doubt I'll read it again since the first time wasn't memorable at all.
Awesome!!! Suspenseful, and great ending!!
You’ll like me better if I’m honest. The body count is so high that the author cannot take time to develop the characters, but we get characters from other, earlier books in the series. Yet, the old characters don’t change anything but appearance. I still enjoyed it some, but I was skimming, flying from the truth. I frequently heard the James Bond music, Goldfinger appeared, but in books, endless death is tolerable more than in movies. I will plough on. Inspector Montalbano and Archie Goodwin are far better.
For the reader, the book has good momentum and for the publisher, the series has good momentum.
The James Patterson franchise kicks out several books a year featuring various authors and different series.
Presumably the Alex Cross series is written thus far by somebody with the actual James Patterson pen name.
One in four Cross novels is great, two in four are decent and it appears to me that every couple of years, a loose collection of scraps are gathered up and glued together by some frantic editors and released to publishing.Patterson's books are compulsively readable.
Unfortunately, I think it is also a gimmick for writing.

As a mysterious group of soldiers evacuated the population of Sunrise Valley, Detective Alex Cross is on vacation.
The local police found a video camera that revealed the suspect behind the bombings.
Although Cross has had a lot of experience controlling situations like these, the suspect is in control; he tells he FBI what to do, who to put on the case, and who to get rid of.
Because the local police and the FBI have very little control, many of the situations are out of control.
Sunrise Valley, Nevada is annihilated in seconds.Major cities around the globe are threatened with total destruction.Seattle, San Franciso, Washington D.C. and London, Alex Cross travels.
Some vacation, mostly business.This, the fastest paced Alex Cross book to date, felt like a race car or a speed boat.
The antagonists, "The Weasel" and "The Wolf" were the most dangerous, most colorful and most elusive of all the criminals Cross has had to deal with.When the action cooled, Alex took time to be with his family.
Little Alex, now three, resided with his mother in Seattle.
Little Alex didn't want his daddy to leave.
I loved the pacing, the plot and of course Alex Cross.
One out of every 17 hardcover books sold in the US are written by James Patterson.
Curious to see what the fuss was about, I picked this up.
Thank god I got it at a library, since I cringe at the thought of a dollar of mine greasing the gears of the Patterson book-writing machine.
The writing is this book, the 10th in his Alex Cross series, is god-awful, the plotting lazy, and the characters thin as balsa.
And so many exclamation points!But to his credit, Patterson seems unembarassed (sp?) so the machine marches on, doing its part to bolster the publishing industry.
2.5 stars. My least favorite of the series so far. It was just too out there... too unbelievable and there was too much going on with very little detail. Things were blowing up and people dying yet it sounded like the same sentences used to describe the lunch they had. The writing felt very disconnected with little to no emotion.
Always a fun read! Love this series... and surprisingly, it's difficult to guess the endings. You think you know it but then you really don't. Starting to get worried about Nana though... she's getting a little old and her health is declining. Not looking forward to the ending of that.
good read
I feel really bad for Alex’s family though every time he thinks that he may take some time off to spend with them he ends up having to work.In this book both Schafer and The Wolf are working together!
They warn the Authorities that if anyone tries to investigate them they will blow up another city of course Alex don’t listen and investigates them anyway, so when he rolls up on the decoy, the Wolf and the Weasel know that they are being investigated.
They end up blowing up places in NYC, London and Nevada.
Oh boy, this thing with the Wolf went on a little too long. To avoid spoilers I'll write as generic as possible. The Wolf was a good character in the last book but became very in believabke in this book. It was just a little too much. The sub plots were great as usual but the overall story felt too far.oit for me. I am.sticking with it and have moved on the Mary, Mary and am excited to discover what happens in the sub plot of Alex's life with the big man (Alex Jr) and family. Keep reading!
Just horrible. no real "detective" work, just flying around, and almost constant nagging about work vs home. Its getting really irritating. Plus the "swoosh, clip, clop, clip, clip, boom, chapter 99, chapter 99, twinkle, twinkle" track before every chapter of the audiobook. Yes, they do say every chapter number TWICE and over 120 chapters. Very irritating.
These last two installments of the series really helped me start to enjoy the Alex Cross series. I seemed to have a harder time getting into them because they do have a bit of cheese factor once in a while. However, the overall drama and the crime and thrill is really intense and I quite enjoyed it! Great Read!
A good one! But not one of my favourites. Nothing original here Mr Patterson. Sorry!
پل های لندن کتاب دهم از سلسله کتاب های الیکس کراس میباشد.
که تقریبا ادامه کتاب قبلی از همین کتاب ها است بنام گرگ بزرگ بدجنس.داستان طور آغاز میشود که گروه از ترورسیت ها قصد دارند که وحشت را در بین مردم به راه بیندازند.
دولت در مقابل خواست های والف بی کقایتی از خود نشان میدهند وهمین جا است که اولین پل را در شهر نیویارک مورد حمله قرار میدهند و بعدا لندن و فرانسه.
باید بگویم که والف در صحفه آخر کتاب شناسایی میشود و با زهر خودکشی میکند بدون آن که الیکس کراس از وی بازپرس کند.
E cioè che il lettore deputato, del genere, abbia desideri predatori e cannibaleschi.
Seguendo questo ragionamento, il giallo è una caccia e il lettore è il cacciatore.
Alla fine, perfino il killer nell'essere scoperto e catturato, diviene vittima dell'indagante di turno e vittima del lettore.
Per questo motivo l'assassino nel thriller non può essere scialbo, deve avere qualche cosa che lo renda un trofeo di soddisfazione.Forse è in omaggio a tale schema che sempre più spesso i polizieschi sciorinano una serie infinita di vittime, martoriate con efferratezza propria della "anestesia" perseguita dal pulp di un Sincity.
I don't want to go through the story lines , But in brief , Cross is an FBI agent ( originally a policeman in Washington D.C) who has been chasing a criminal 'Geoffrey Shafer' Known as Weasel " a filthy rich sadistic person who likes to rape young girls and then kill them by torturing them " he is involved with the Wolf , a former figure of the Russian Mafia , !!
It was classified into chapters two or three pages for each which made it really easy and comfortable for read .I was a bit confused because it was my first read of the adventures of Alex , and it turned out that this book is somehow connected to someone before .
