4 zvezdice jer je solidna ljubavna priƒça i ba≈° mi je trebalo neko jednostavno lagano ≈°tivo da se malo opustim.
Love the book, love the series. I'm having such good time rereading these books
I really enjoyed this oldie, the relationship between the two and how it developed and for a change even the heroine's doubts didn't annoy me because they made sense because of her past.
Previ≈°e njanjavo. Ali ≈°ta ƒáu, moram da proƒçitam sve ≈°to mi padne pod ruku...
lagano ≈°tivo za opustiti se ;-)
Both are things Nora is a master at not doing.
I've never had a Nora book I could not read.
You can only say "yes I want this" and then immediately "no, I don't, this is all your fault go away" once or maybe twice in a book.
I couldn't stand her and when one thing happened (view spoiler)[ you share a bed with a man, roll into him and cuddle him, turn him on, have sex with him "in your sleep" then basically say its all his fault and make him feel like an ass?
Cu mult mai buna decat prima carte a seriei! Poate si unde Diana a crescut neav√¢nd parte de iubire, crezand ca fratele ei a uitat-o.Recenzia mea completa o gƒÉsi»õi aici: https://justreadingmybooks.wordpress....

The second book in the MacGregor series.Tempting Fate is an outstanding book of two people who are very different and very similar. Diana Blade is a woman who's never known what a family feels like. She keeps her life separate and made and oath not to complicate her life.And then caine came along...Caine is as always a fun guy and being a lawyer makes him a strong opponent in battle so when he decided to destroy Diana‚Äôs wall for feelings things go beyond than just friendship.

A MacGregor Book!This one is about Caine MacGregor and Diana Blade, who, incidentally, is Justin Blade‚Äôs sister.
Who is married to Caine‚Äôs sister, Serena MacGregor.Here‚Äôs another thing that I feel like happens more often in books and movies than in real life ‚Äì siblings of spouses fall in love, too!
And also, allowing Diana to open herself up to Caine, and forgiving herself for her feelings toward Justin and how she was raised.Besides, this is a MacGregor book.
When Justin's estranged younger sister Diana is invited by Serena to visit them, she never imagined she would end up meeting Serena's charming older brother Caine.Both are lawyers by profession, and cautious by nature.It's insta attraction for them, and how they fall for each other and fight Diana's issues is the story.I loved meeting the family again.
However I felt Diana had a LOT of insecurities, and Caine had to fight tooth and nail to conquer them.
(2018) Esto es curioso esta Saga o Serie me la le√≠ completa hace a√±os realmente hace A√ëOS!! y llevo d√≠as editando los Shelves y descubro que esta serie esta sin fechas!!! e inclompleta!! porque esta estoy 100% segura que la lei completa aun la recuerdo, asi que tuve que buscar fechas y! tengo el aproximado es mas hasta sinopsis tenia (no la recuerdo tenia)
Assim como o primeiro livro, esse livro saga dos Macgregors √© surpreendente. Assim como Jogo de Sedu√ß√£o, Destino Tentador √© um romance de tirar o folego, rom√¢ntico e picante!! Um livro que mostro empodeiramento da mulher e a sua for√ßa de vontade para alcan√ßar seus objetivos, e al√©m de tudo de alcan√ßar seus desejos!!
A terrific read! ‚ò∫This series is one where all the characters are believable and you just know you could be friends with them, regardless of your lack of social status. üòÑI can't wait to dive into the next book.
Another Nora Roberts series I missed, The MacGregors. And again, what can I say? She writes with many twists and turns with great character development. Love her books as she usually ends all her books with a warm, fuzzy feeling. Looking forward to rest of series.
No entiendo c√≥mo ponen tan bien esta serie porque me parece insulsa a m√°s no poder, al menos los dos primeros libros que he le√≠do, con "instant love" y 0 inter√©s. Ya no le doy m√°s oportunidades, no es para mi.
My least favourite of this series. I found both main characters to be unlikeable. The only thing that saved it, somewhat, for me at all was the appearances of family members from the other MacGregor novels.
The perfect book that reflects woman's mind and her insecurities. It also illustrates woman's hunger to prove her identity. I just love the book and the narration. The inner conflicts of Diana is much relatable.
The narrator of this audiobook did a wonderful job. It's a little dated but it's a wonderful romance.
A good read, but if NR's work is any indication, sex was terrifying in the 80's.
The second in the MacGregor series - good characters, good romance and Daniel MacGregor.
Dvoje advokata zapocinju zajednicku praksu,posao sa sobom donosi ljubav...obican ljubic
A Great Read!!I enjoyed this book very much. I loved the characters and their families. I recommend it to all. Nora Roberts rocks!!!!
Lots of laughs, a few tears and a wonderful sigh at the end.
Thus, Diana Blade, attorney at law, is invited to Serena and Justin's hotel, and there, through circumstances that one could very easily call fate, meets Caine MacGregor, another attorney at law who seems eager to get close to her and bring down her emotional defenses.
Thank God Caine treated her so coldly when she was trying to make amends, otherwise I would have lost any kind of respect I held for him...The only parts where I didn't feel like murdering her through my glaring the words on the page were the ones where she was doing her job.
Frequent.Hero: Lawyer.Heroine: Lawyer.Trigger: Domestic Violence and Rape.Enjoyable romp, heavy on the relationships, with our Hero being the first to admit to love and doing the chasing.A curious dub con episode, our hero and heroine were asleep (him naked) in the same bed and did it without really waking.
She had very definitely stated she wasn‚Äôt ready, but was fully engaged in the sleep sex.Rape case where he didn‚Äôt do it and she said he did after her father forced her.
