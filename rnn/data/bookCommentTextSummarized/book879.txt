If you could only have one companion book to your bible, this should be it!
Truly unique. Fascinating, thought-provoking, and enlightening. The section on the Great Pyramid is worth by itself the price of this book, though of course the rest of it is a great resource as well.
Very easy to understand
Must readIf you have any interest with being a Bible scholar this is a great book to start with. You may not agree with certain things like The Rapture timing but it is hard to argue the points explained.
Clarence Larkin has spent a tremendous amount of time on the charts contained herein.The outlines of the dispensations, the abundance of references, and his confidence in the clarity of his presentation make this more or less an encyclopedia for subscribers of dispensationalism.
Amazingly organized and well thought out presentation (Larkin was a mechanical engineer before being called to the ministry) of the Bible from Genesis to Revelation. Every believer needs to read this 98 year old book at least once. Excellent! Superb! Exceptional!
The essential handbook on Premillennial ThinkinglThough dated....this is a classic on Dispensationalism. You will find ample cross references and intriguing charts.The table of contents works well on the Kindle.A great title to add to your theological library.maranatha!
This is by far one of the best Dispensational books. Not at all poorly written or illustrated. I give it a 1 because of the very poor theology that dispensationalism is.
One of my favorite authors and one of my favorite books.
