Very good book detailing the importance of leadership during a revolution. "A rising of the masses of the people needs no justification. What has happened is an insurrection, and not a conspiracy." ~Leon Trotsky. The insurrection was turned into a revolution by the Bolshevik Party leaders, namely Lenin and Trotsky.
A polemic text. Empty words. It would have been funny to see a shallow mind trying to recreate the Russian Orthodox church around the Marxist doctrine. There is only one church: the party. And everyone outside this church is heretical, or against the revolution. But it is not funny given how many have had to die for this new cult.
Absolutely essential reading for anyone interested in Bolshevism
A very interesting historical document.
