In this book Wells looks at the problems of education and how education affects how people are able to think and how this affects the country as a whole.
Wells tackles Christian and classical ideas on education and children.
But this is more than simply a book of ideas.
The book starts in late Victorian England and ends shortly after the first world war.
They grow up and deal with love, decadence and the reality of war in a very meaningful way.
I greatly enjoyed this book.
In this book, also written right after WWI, Wells looks at the problems of education through two characters who are raised together as children and their guardian, a man who has spent much of his working life in Africa and come home to England to convalesce.
Wells is looking at education in the most holistic way - not just schools but what we learn from our parent,s our friends, what we read in books, what we hear in Church or from our poilticians.
Joan may be one of Wells' best female characters - full of life- and Oswald, one of his most sympathetic.
Good book, but became very political at the end. Pretty love story, though.
