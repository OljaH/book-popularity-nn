Ghyl Tarvok is the son of a kindly but distracted woodworker on Halma - a planet that is ruled by an aristocracy, tightly managed by its public welfare department (which incorrectly calls its governmental system a "Welfare State"), and exhibits traits of a dogmatic but not entirely authoritarian theocracy as well.
young Ghyl dreams of many things: owning a 'space-yacht', traveling to far worlds, discovering the truth behind the legend of Emphyrio, making his home a better place.
the novel Emphyrio is about Ghyl gradually understanding the mysteries in his life - his own dreams & desires, his father, the true history & rulers of his world.
The plot revolves around a young man, Ghyl Tarvoke, who hails from from the city of Ambroy located on the planet Halma.
Unhappy with the way things are, Ghyl, in typical Vance protagonist fashion, vows to knowledge up and learn the truth behind a legendary figure, Emphyrio, in the hopes that he will find the secret to changing his society.
All of the hallmark's of Vance's best work are displayed in Emphyrio: **incredible world-building;** smart, well-integrated descriptions of local color and customs;** marvelous, economical prose; and ** an unusual, well thought out social system, whose flaws and hampering of individual freedom lie at the heart of the story.
His father teaches him to read archaic script, including the ancient covenant of their world and the legend of Emphyrio.
Inspired, Ghyl first tries to run for mayor, (view spoiler)[but this leads to his father's arrest and eventual death.
Ghyl manages to escape being crushed to death, and instead realizes the great secret of his world.
As a novel, the pacing is very ragged: we spend chapter upon chapter watching Ghyl grow up, and then no time at all (view spoiler)[on the revolution or rebuilding of his world.
With a somewhat slow beginning, I gradually found myself more engaged with the story and immersed in the dystopian, theocratic vision Vance created here.The intransigence of the bureaucratic regime, the resistance to change and the desperation with which people will cling to the status quo when they have even the smallest vestige of power is demonstrated wonderfully here.
I just didn't buy it and thought the regime collapsed all too easily.
Jack Vance is quickly becoming one of my most-favorite authors. His imagination astounds me, his witty irony makes me giggle, and his language is a joy to read. No one can create whole imaginary societies with such richness and ease, or write venomous insults in such a courtly manner. Very talented and very underappreciated writer. This book is not quite up there with the Dying Earth series, but still it's fun, quick, and enjoyable read.
Jack Vance's catalog is an embarrassment of riches and this standalone novel is no exception. Emphyrio is wonderful and charming and I'll fight anyone who says otherwise.
Amiante is paid very little for his works, even though, as Ghyl eventually learns, these screens end up being sold to museums and buyers on distant planets for exorbitant amounts of money.Persons who do not enroll in the welfare system are considered to be noncups (short for noncuperatives).
Ghyl learns about the Historical Institute on Earth that might possess the rest of the Emphyrio story and documents about the real history of his planet Halma.
He thinks about traveling to Earth but has no funds or means to do so.In the second half of the novel Ghyl becomes increasingly dissatisfied with his life, society and work.
But unfortunately, for all the brilliant world-building, the novel lacks a certain dramatic tension, as well as a real appeal for the world it portrays.The world of Emphyrio is interesting, but strangely placid.
But most of the story takes place on a small world of artisans, away from the most interesting aspects of Vance's creation.
There is a sense that this place is unjust and something of a repressive environment for the protagonist, Ghyl, and his father; but the form of repression they live through is pretty mild and unthreatening.
His obsession with a fragment of the legend of Emphyrio, and his slow draw away from his destiny as a woodworker, is well-written, but lacks dramatic tension.
Ghyl Tarvoke je sin, nazovimo stolara, koji kroz djetinjstvo ni ne razumije o čemu je riječ, ali kako godine prolaze shvaća da je njegov otac kršitelj pravila i kako prezire vlast kojoj se moraju pokoravati.
Na brodu, ali pogotovo na Damaru, shvaća što je zapravo na stvari i kako njegov matični planet Halma funkcionira.
Neću bacati spojlere, ali kraj je fantastičan.
Vance piše za engleski pojam bravurozno, pa sam čak čitao i engleske recenzente koji se ponekad gube u njegovom jeziku.
Zovu ga „skladatelj jezika“ jer barata s njim kao s notama koristeći pri tome arhaične, izumrle, nenadane izraze za poznate stvari što daje dojam nekog starog spisa, ali i uskraćuje dojam nama NE-englezerima jer se patimo dok čitamo.
An underrated book but perhaps Vance's best stand-alone work.
We get to know quite well the protagonist Ghyl and his motivations.
(view spoiler)[ This spoiler will only make sense to those who have read the book.
When the light dawned on Ghyl, I re-read those few paragraphs a couple of times to try to understand.
Only later, when he explained it to Lord Dugald, do we learn what he realized.
But still I didn't understand why Dugald went along with it, and when Dugald explained it to the other Lords and Ladies, I don't know why they accepted it.
It just didn't make sense to me that Ghyl could have done what he did.
I thought it was a Cold War age anti-communist propaganda piece, espousing how any one in a socially provided for system will become "lazy." Furthermore, everyone in Ghyl's life is a jerk, from his mostly-disinterested father to his so-called "friends" and the girls he dates.
"Realistic" means that the "good guys" or the "ordinary guys" do have to win sometime!But when Ghyl's father, who insists upon reproducing a legend of a mythological figure called Emphyrio, who dares to challenge the system (which he doesn't have the ending to) is "reconditioned" to death, Ghyl undergoes a transformation.
When he becomes an adult Glyn is sufficiently angry to take matters into his own hands and tries to rebel against the system, setting in place a series of events that eventually lead off-world and much danger.One thing I have always loved about Vance books is the detailed description of a stifling society, where social status and appearance is everything.
It feels like the author was probably working to a word-count, realised that after 180 pages he had to finish the story right now, and so literally did just that.So it would have got a score of 4/5, but the ending knocked off a star for me.
Vance allows young Ghyl to go about his business and live his bleak and depressing life, which not only set up the motivating factors for the end of the book but also showed in minute detail the inner workings of Ambroy society without resorting to clumsy expository scenes.
The aforementioned contrived dialogue and thin characters combined with a slow-building plot all work against the story to a certain extent, except that the plot was actually quite interesting if you set aside the desire for typical SF action and adventure.
Vilket i vanlig ordning är synd och skam, om än att det bästa jag läst av honom har varit de två böckerna han skrev om Cugel the Clever.
Språket glimmar fortfarande till ibland och det märks absolut att det är Vance som håller i pennan.
Det första, speciellt, är Vance som briljerar med ett samhälle och dess system.
Samhället karaktärerna lever i är absolut ett förtryckande sådant men generellt så är det inget som tynger dem, egentligen.
Språket är mer sparsmakat än vad jag hoppats på men Vance är ändock Vance och vet hur man använder målande språk på ett bra vis.
From my Amazon.com review:I found this novel by chance, as part of a collection of classic science fiction works.
I knew Jack Vance from his Dying Earth novels (The Compleat Dying Earth) but this book is different.
A well written parable, with beautiful use of language and description.
The planet is controlled by the Lords, owners of major industries, who (with the guild) control all trade and keep things under control.The novel takes aims at a number of targets.
The written is charming and the book is easy and enjoyable to read.
It succumbs to a languid threat to reveal the true state of affairs, an even less likely event, though followed by a proper riot and revolution.As dystopia's go, this is a decidedly utopian one, static and unyielding, yet full of individual endeavour, glamorous maidens, enchanting pavilions filled with fine costumes, dancing and a certain pride in fine craftsmanship.The cover of my edition features a rather sturdy couple, the male clutching at a gun, whilst spacecraft wizz past across a starry backdrop.
This is rather at odds with the gentle political tale of ineffectual rebellion, kidnapping and mercantile swindling inside the covers.
Alcuni sono sicuramente più particolari di altri, e per me il libro è stato piuttosto interessante sotto questo aspetto, anche se avrei voluto che a questo aspetto fosse dato più spazio.Vedere le differenze tra i vari pianeti e in particolare scoprire come Ghyl reagiva a queste peculiarità è stata una delle cose che più mi ha spinto a continuare la lettura, in quanto ci sono molte altre cose che invece non mi sono piaciute.
Anche perché le osservazioni di Ghyl sono un punto chiave per tutta la storia, quindi bisogna farci attenzione.La relazione lord/beneficiari è una di dominio dei primi sui secondi ma non si capisce fino alla fine il perché di questo ordine costituito.
Emphyrio is a rather standard story about a human in the distant future on a distant colonized planet trying to improve his situation in life.
It all also a search for truth, revenge etc.
A bit like an SF version of The Count of Monte Cristo if you like.
Although SF, there is little science involved.
Still it all taking place on a colonized planet in the future qualifies it as SF and in addition there is some space travel done.I am left with the feeling this is an expanded short story.
The start is poor but the story picks up a bit.
I love Vance. His use of language is always interesting and enjoyable. He is sharp, witty and intelligent. He also has the ability to create fascinating worlds/societies and intriguing characters. Emphyrio is fantastic novel. It's rather short and quick to read, but Vance packs a lot in. He's very highly regarded when it comes to creating unique scenarios and landscapes, but this novel does more than that. It delves into themes such as self-responsibility and individualism. But mostly, like all of Vance's work, it's a great deal of fun.
4.5 stars, actually.There's a certain soft touch to the way the book is written that I found appealing, even though I started to feel as though the plot was being neglected. At the end, I realised this was not the case at all, and Vance had pulled off a fairly neat trick, and managed to develop all the elements of the book (characters, plot, setting) in a perfectly synergistic way. The key characters will stay with me for a long time, I feel - Ghyll is a more subtle, layered hero than those of most sci fi novels.
Estamos ante el que es, a mi modo de ver, el mejor libro de Vance. En este caso sacrifica un poco de su maravillosa habilidad de creación de civilizaciones exóticas, creándo una un poco más cercana a la nuestra, donde el viaje de Ghyl Tarvoke, a modo de epopeya de héroe griego, nos lleva a una aventura que toca temás tan actuales como La lucha de clases, la alienación y la relación paterno-filial.En resumen: un Vance que se sale de su linea habitual para ser aún mejor.
Eerily similar to the current situation in Greece. Unsuspecting peasants kept in conditions of eternal underpaid manual labour in a rustic environment that attracts tourists, overzealous tax collectors and "enforcers of regulations", an irrational religion with devout "jumping" clerics. All governed by an oblivious blood-sucking upper class which itself is controlled by some distant "troika". Only the names change...
Jack Vance might be best ever Author.His Tales of the dying earth inspired dungeons and dragons.His gaiean reach was star trek like.His magnus rindolf were aprt doctor who part sherlock holmes.Only Robert E Howard, Michael Moorcock, and AE Van Vogt contend for worlds best Author ever.Suppressed because he had tiny pro capitalism flavour.A Giant given fewer than deserved awards by democrat laden scifi associations.
What starts out as a "coming of age" novel (I think we have more than enough of those out there right now) develops into a search for liberation from oppression. The mystery is in who the oppressors really are and by what mechanisms they maintain power. The journey toward that end is captivating. A little wrapped up in the 1960s as regards style, but beautifully written and intelligently presented.
I am always marveled by Vance's imaginative histories and capacities to create believable alien societies and put the human condition in some place further in time or in an ancient past. Emphyrio is a book that combines the science fiction story teller along with the mystery author which Vance was both along with some virulent criticism towards the exploitation of the human work.
One of the bleakest settings I have ever encountered.Liberals have taken over an entire planet and transmogrified it into an oppressive welfare state.A young freedom fighter adopts a name from antiquity, that of the legendary hero Emphyrio, and risks everything to set things right.
Took me a couple of chapters to get the hang of the world, but then I got sucked in. Really liked the book's main character, his dilemmas, his search for truth. Looking forward to checking out some more Vance books.
Jack Vance's strongest single novel it is seen as and i can clearly see why. A great book and my first Vance it showed my way to him.
I was not that impressed with this book at all. The first half is very much fantasy-I didnt see it as SF at all, then just after the halfway point it changed and became an SF adventure. Much better but by then it was too late.Not bad but not brilliant either.
