Each chapter is then followed by Rateliff's commentaries on what we've just read, providing fascinating insight into Tolkien's sources, inspirations and useful background information.Thus we learn about Tolkien's fascination with "eagles-to-the-rescue"; the development of elves from Norse and Celtic folklore, through the Middle-ages and into the late Victorian and Edwardian era; Tolkien's likely source for Beorn the werebear; neolithic lake towns, etc.That the commentaries are annotated, and frequently refer back to Tolkien's own invented mythology, makes the book wonderfully convoluted and recursive.
Rateliff pieces together fragments of history in order to present THE HOBBIT as it was originally drafted by J.R.R. Tolkien.
And this opens up to aspect number two.As Tolkien begins to make his second pass through the draft, notating and correcting as he goes (in pen over the top of original pencil writings), names begin to change, the story arc and scenes start morphing and readers get to see and understand why those alterations were made.
Finally, Tolkien's original vision is presented for the world to see, and the extent of the expansive growth of Middle-earth and its characters is opened up to inspection.
Deeply fascinating and insightful this illuminating book is a must-read for all JRR Tolkien fans Similarly to ‘The History of Middle Earth’ series (13 books in total) this book examines in detail ‘The Hobbit’ in regards to how this children’s story came into being and how it grew.
This book looks behind Tolkien’s tale to explore those themes hidden within, as well as noting those changes that have occurred over the years to the original publication.
If you are looking for an assured, accurate read relating to J.R.R. Tolkien’s ‘The Hobbit’ then the history behind it makes for great reading.
The History of the Hobbit is a series similar to Christopher Tolkien's History of Middle-Earth, with Rateliff providing early manuscripts of the story, plot notes and his own commentaries, allowing fans to see how  The Hobbit: Or There and Back Again  was formed. While a few names differ from the published version, the story isn't so dissimilar from the published version we're used to. Indeed, the biggest change is probably the meeting between Gollum and Bilbo, which was only changed to the vers

While a few names differ from the published version, the story isn't so dissimilar from the published version we're used to.
The plot notes, however, allow us a tantalising glimpse at different ideas Tolkien thought about including.The commentaries are – to me – more readable and interesting than those in History of Middle-Earth.
They trace possible inspirations to related material, including historic texts, but also to Tolkien's own legendarium.
Somewhat disappointing, unfortunately, especially compared to Christopher Tolkien's "History of Middle Earth." Most of the comments by Rateliff (the author) concern guessing influences on Tolkien's imagination or nit-picking small textual changes.
It was good to read some of Tolkien's ideas of where The Hobbit might have gone, but I've been getting the feeling lately that we're delving a bit too much into Tolkien's creative process.
Don't get me wrong, I love the Histories of Middle Earth, but there's only so much you can hack apart the process of a writing.
Noting that Fili instead of Kili said such-and-such really has very little point for anything.
Any history of Tolkein's writing is a history of the man himself and I would have liked to see it tied more closely to his own life. However various biographers and DVD special edition extras have done that to death already. What you're left with is a deep and scholarly dissemination of the writing process and how Middle Earth was built. A must read for anyone who considers themselves more than a casual fan, but a little dull for the rest of us.
I love Lord of the rings and I think this is a good precuel.
Fantastic. Terribly dry, but if you love the Hobbit and you love history(as I do) you'll enjoy this. Must read for anyone who love's hobbit story!
This one-volume edition is absolutely amazing.
The information in it is very detailed and Ratcliff has done an excellent job compiling and commenting on the various stages of The Hobbit creation.
The book itself is of very high quality with a very pretty dustcover.
If you take the dustcover off the book is also gorgeous to look at.
The paper used for the book itself is matte with pictures in glossy paper.
Certainly looks very well put together.
Having everything in one edition instead of the original format of two volumes makes the book a bit heavier, but in my opinion, strengthens and makes for a better and far more presentable product.
I found parts of this book good, but sometimes I didn't because it was written so long ago and it was written quite weird and old words. I took quite a while to read it because I wasn't really enjoying it too much and it was a relief to finish it. I really liked the movies though, so for me the movies were better
The Hobbit was magical and exciting. I read this book in 6th grade which is very rare for me. I was not much of a reader and this book had me dreaming about The Middle Earth... I would even paint and draw pictures after each chapter which has lead me to LOVE the movies series of the Lord of the Rings which I have yet to read.
as a massive tolkien fan, i really enjoyed this. it takes parts of the book and adds a lot of obseervations and notes and for me at least gave a lot iof intereing insights into the hobbits that i wouldnt perhaps have looked at otherwise. some people might find it a bit dry and lecture-like but i think the style suits the format. will definitely appeal to tolkien fans everywhere
Very interesting!Wouldn't recommend unless you've read the hobbit a couple times, or just read it recently. If you've read even a bit of the history of middle earth, it makes it even more interesting. Glad I read this!
