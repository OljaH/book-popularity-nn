4.5 stars!Absolutely loved this story and the illustrations. I wasn't sure what to expect going in to this and I was pleasantly surprised with it.
I've read so many versions of fairy tales that it takes a really interesting spin(dle) (ha) for me to enjoy. Unfortunately, this was not the caseThe best part - how Gaiman takes the fairy tale characters and weaves them into a new-old story.  “You don’t need princes to save you. I don’t have a lot of patience for stories in which women are rescued by men." Yes, there's a sleeping beauty but she's nothing is like the original story. Yes, there's a Snow White, but gone is the calm Disney gal.  Lea

Yes, there's a sleeping beauty but she's nothing is like the original story.
Learning how to be strong, to feel her own emotions and not another's, had been hard; but once you learned the trick of it, you did not forget.
the whole story had a very lackluster feel to it.
The illustrations are black and white gorgeousness, decorated with gold leaf here and there.
It's definitely a visually impressive book.And yes - there's a cool twist to the traditional Sleeping Beauty tale, as well as a new spin on the Snow White story.
But the book is so short that there are no really interesting or developed characters.
The villain is the traditional, one-dimensional kind that longs for youth and power, and the story just felt like it needed something else in order to be memorable.Pretty much any story that relies on its big twist kind of falls flat, in my opinion.
The Sleeper and the Spindle could have been such an enchanting, lovely lesbian fairytale retelling.
The illustrations are rather ubiquitous and of good quality… but not that necessary.
At least, it isn’t necessary to have that many of them.
This being a short story, and the author not having depicted everything or everyone in extreme detail, we never get to know the characters all that well.
The story is original, that’s for sure, and I liked the unpredictable twist, even though I was expecting something else to come out of it.For fans of Neil Gaiman’s writing style and his Snow, Glass, Apples short story.
Find all of my reviews at: http://52bookminimum.blogspot.com/ “There are always choices.” It seems every time I delve into the world of a retelling I begin by pointing out how much I didn’t care for the original. I guess it should come as no surprise that Snow White and Sleeping Beauty weren’t my idea of a great time when I was a kid either. In fact, the entire world of Disney princesses kinda creeps me out – unless it’s these kind of princesses . . . . But I digress. Due to the above I didn’t h
I guess it should come as no surprise that Snow White and Sleeping Beauty weren’t my idea of a great time when I was a kid either.
The story is about a young queen (Snow White) who is given word by three of her loyal followers (dwarfs) about a sleeping sickness that fell over a neighboring kingdom decades before, but has begun to spread.
I’m rounding up, however, because there was a little more to the story than met the eye that left Mitchell and I looking something like this .
And also because it was oh so very pretty to look at .
Purest magic!
A fairy tale as classic as they get, with a twist as modern as can be.Once upon a time there was a queen.
She had a troubled childhood, and lived in the shadow of her abusive, narcissist stepmother.
But magic works both ways.
You can say no to power and yes to self-determined life.
All that is possible, in the magical world of Neil Gaiman and Chris Riddell.The art and the words weave a web of imaginative power, an inspiration for those of us who are tired of princesses marrying to be forgotten.
Queens take the road less travelled by.
“The path to her death, heartbeat by heartbeat, would be inevitable.”A wonderful book with beautiful illustrations and a new perspective on our most beloved fairytales.I'm not a big fan of Gaiman's writing, I guess. Would this be the same artist but a different author, say Laini Taylor or Catherynne M. Valente, this could have been as magical and wondrous as I had wished it.Find more of my books on Instagram
The first thing you should know: this is NOT a lesbian retelling of Sleeping Beauty.
I'm sure you've all seen the Chris Riddell illustration of Snow White kissing Sleeping Beauty awake by now, and will have seen this book lauded as LGBT representation.
What I got was one sweet lady smooch and one (admittedly beautiful) illustration to accompany it...and that was all.
Not true love's kiss.
However, I am bumping it up to four because for starters, nothing Neil Gaiman writes is ever BAD, Chris Riddell's illustrations are beautiful as usual and the production quality of the book is flawless.
I went out on a limb recommending this to Kelly (and the Book Boar) for her fairy tale retellings project when I was only halfway done with this, but I'm relieved to say I still liked it when I finally finished it last night.A queen is (reluctantly) about to get married, but when a sleeping sickness spreads through a neighboring kingdom and threatens hers, she sets aside her plans, puts on her mail shirt and sword, and heads off with her dwarf friends to take care of the problem herself.
MY BLOG: Melissa Martin's Reading ListI got this book from the library but I can tell you it is going to be added to my bookshelves as I must have it.
Queen Snow and the dwarfs arrive at the castle and find (just like they said) everyone asleep.
Until along came Snow, who isn't a prince but a Queen, and wakes her up.
We find out all is not as it seems as the Beauty wakes up.

This story didn’t need a hero, that was perfect on his white horse.
Sometimes I love what you do and at other times I absolutely hate it.
Gaiman subverted the standard fairy-tale so much that his ending, one that was clearly meant to be surprising, was so blatantly obvious to the point of actually being mundane.
So to spice things up a bit Gaiman makes the hero a woman.
By reversing such things, the story that followed was easy to predict; it was just the opposite of what you’d normally expect to see.
There’s no time for anything to develop, and the eventual villain that revealed itself was practically an overdone caricature.
It's like the bear bones of a story.
A wonderful Neil Gaiman retelling....remashing....reimagining of a fairy tale. A gothic, creepy tale for sure. I listened to the audio and it was wonderful. A full cast of characters with music and various sounds. Fantastic. Though I must get the print to see the drawings that are part of the book.
this book has the most beautiful cover i have ever seen in my LIFE.
and beautiful black-and-white illustrations.
and it's a fairytale retelling.
and it's by neil gaiman.
and it's short.i have loved books for all of those reasons alone.
like, by neil gaiman?
illustrated?
short?
fairytale-y?
doooooone.SO WHY DIDN'T I LOVE THIS ONE, WHICH HAD ALL OF THOSE THINGS.it just didn't feel particularly any of those things, i guess.
the writing was meh for neil gaiman.
everything was confusing because it was so short.
NOT ENOUGH ANYTHING, REALLY.i guess that's what you get when a book is under 70 pages and, like, half illustrations?still.
Poznati motivi iz bajki ispričani na malkice drugačiji način...neki bi rekli "Svetogrđe!", "Kako se samo usudio?!", a ja kažem, ako je neko mogao to da uradi na pravi način, onda je to Neil Gaiman. A koliki je Gaiman mag za reči, toliki je Chris Riddell majstor za crtež.Vidim da su mišljenja podeljena kada je reč o ovoj pričici, ali meni je posle napornih mesec dana na poslu došla kao melem na ranu.
If they don’t like it, you might want to think seriously about disinheriting them, because it will show they have no heart, no eye for beauty and no sense of humour.
And you don’t wanna empower people like that, really.
Those with no kids - yeah, buy it for each other.The art by Chris Riddell is so stunning, every other page is a gobsmacker, and it helps that the young (nameless) queen kind of looks a bit like Jessica Jones as played by Krysten Ritterand the retelling of Sleeping Beauty by Neil Gaiman is wry and has dwarves.
There are always choices.Since I've read The Graveyard Book I wanted to read more books by both Neil Gaiman and Chris Riddell.
And now, that I've read it, I can safely say that this book was just as good as I expected it to be.This was a retelling of Sleeping beauty and Snow White mixed together.
I loved Gaiman's dark twist to the story but I've got to say that my favorite thing about this book were Riddell's illustrations.
And as soon as I've finished the book, I wanted to read it again.

3.5 magical starsEnormous peaks of mountains separate the kingdoms of Dorimar and kanselaire. Kanelaire is rowdy as the wedding of their queen approaches. But Dormiar is silent as it mourns the spell that has put its princess to sleep.   “Up the blooming stairs and past the blooming cook and what are you cooking now, eh, great land-arse, nothing in your pots and pans but dust and more dust, and all you ever do is snore.”  There is one oncoming calamity, though, poking its head out its burrow, vi
3.5 magical starsEnormous peaks of mountains separate the kingdoms of Dorimar and kanselaire.
But Dormiar is silent as it mourns the spell that has put its princess to sleep.
It is now up to one kingdom to save another one and in doing so, save itself.The lust for beauty, power and youth underlies this story and the concept of life threaded into a roll of yarn is unique.
Comprehensively written with lucid descriptions, The Sleeper and the Spindle is a blend of Snow white and Sleeping Beauty with a few touches from Maleficient.
It is a quick, beautiful read with an unpredictable villain.
As a sleeping curse hits the kingdom, the queen postpones her wedding and sets off with three dwarves to free the sleeping princess and end the curse...Neil Gaiman and Chris Riddell team up yet again to present this short fairy tale, a dark combination of Snow White and Sleeping Beauty.As dark fairy tales go, it had its moments.
The art by Chris Riddell added to the tale and reminded me of old woodcuts at times.I liked the ending quite a bit, not nearly as pat as I was expecting.
I guess I expected more from Neil Gaiman this time out.
🎃Es una mezcla de la bella durmiente, Blanca Nieves y The walking dead.
😂A diferencia de los cuentos tradicionales, aquí no hay un caballero que salve a la princesa, sino que es la reina la que toma el mando y va al rescate de la bella durmiente.
Al fin un cuento en el que las mujeres se muestran valientes e inteligentes.!!
👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼 Tiene unas ilustraciones preciosas y un final inesperado que me gustó mucho .!!“A la reina le había costado aprender a ser fuerte, a sentir sus propias emociones y no las de otra persona, pero quien aprende esa lección ya nunca la olvida.” ❤️
This was so, so short, it would be impossible to review it w/o giving any spoilers. Let's just say, it was Gaiman style through and through and the audiobook production for it delivered a whole cast to enjoy. A little twisted, as expected, it plays out as a short of the original tale with a punch of a parody.Enjoy :)
Whimsical and deliciously  dark  at times,  The Sleeper and The Spindle is a retold fairytale featuring a not-quite Sleeping Beauty and a sword-weilding Snow White. ￼The moment I set my eyes on the book cover, I knew I need to have this beauty in my possession. I was beyond delighted when I found out that this tale is accompanied with gorgeous illustrations by  Chris Riddell (who also drew for the macabre children's story,  The Graveyard Book. Another favourite!). Coupled with Neil Gaiman's exce
at times,  The Sleeper and The Spindle is a retold fairytale featuring a not-quite Sleeping Beauty and a sword-weilding Snow White.
Coupled with Neil Gaiman's excellent, lyrical prose  The Sleeper and The Spindle has successfully met my idea of a true whimsy fairytale.After waking from a year long magical sleep, Her Majesty the Queen is set to marry a young prince soon.
Such as the choice for Her Majesty to pick her own Happily Ever After, and what a change that is.Actual rating: 3.5 stars**Disclaimer: The illustration above originally came in black&white with no typography added.
I liked this very much. I think I liked this very much. I'm almost positive I liked this very much . . . o.OFull RTC.
Hacen falta historias como estas.
I listened to this book on cd and it was very good. They had back ground music and multiple different voices for each character. It felt like listening to play. I highly suggest listening to this short book. It was very good :)
This pair have never let me down yet.
The Sleeper and the Spindle is a fairytale retelling / mashup of Sleeping Beauty and Snow White, but with the characteristic darkness and twists we'd expect from Gaiman.
Riddell's illustrations are as stunning as always, presented in black, white and gold to give a very traditional and magical feel to a very modern fairytale.It's a short story, made to be read it one sitting, and I would say it's the perfect bedtime story if it wasn't for the extra level of unsettling Gaiman creepiness lathered on top.
I guess it depends on the kid!I loved it, I will read it again and again, studying the artwork in fine detail, and I'm very happy to have this is my collection.
First read down for the 2017 BookTube-A-Thon!
El libro es un retelling mezclando dos cuentos clásicos, por un lado Blancanieves con sus enanitos y por otro, La bella durmiente; creando un cuento completamente nuevo y original, de perfil más oscuro y al menos para mí, con un final inesperado.La narración como no podía faltar en Gaiman es perfecta; con la típica estructura de cuento (introducción, nudo y desenlace), lenguaje y longitud.
La segundo que más me gusto, fue que no se esconde a las personas feas, es algo que se realza, porque no por ser bello tienen que ser los buenos y por ser feos ser los malos.Sin duda, un pequeño tiempo bien invertido, aunque el libro sea caro, creo que merece la pena tenerlo como alternativa a lo clásico.
