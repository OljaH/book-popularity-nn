I will write a review for this book, but really I can sum it up in two words: hard work.Very long, very slow, very boring.
If I had not been reading an ARC and also didn't want to get harassed by Bracken fans for writing a DNF review, there is no way I would have made myself suffer through this.I didn't love Bracken's The Darkest Minds - truth be told, I thought that got really slow too once they escaped - but time travel and pirates was a premise worthy of a second chance.
It was so atmospheric, and I was really impressed with the details and the amount of research that had to go into writing this.
The time travel aspect was fascinating and just straight up cool, I loved our two main characters and was so happy that we got to see from both of their POVs. AND THAT ENDING!
Let's just say I'm eagerly anticipating book 2.If you're looking for a cool time travel book, or you love atmospheric stories with rich settings and historical details, or if you just want to read an awesome 'questing through time' type adventure, this is probably the book for you!
THIS WAS SO GOOD! Of course we get a classic Alexandra Bracken cliff hanger at the end. I loved the writing style in this book! It was completely different than the darkest minds trilogy. I love seeing when author's change it up.
Loved the world created in Passenger, and I can't wait to get my hands on book 2 after that ending! Here's my full booktalk/review: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H403u...
Probably my favorite book of 2015, didn't want it to end so I made it last as long as possible!
So excited for you guys to read this! It's very different from TDM :) REVIEWERS PLEASE NOTE: The story has undergone changes since the BEA ARC was produced several months ago. If your version DOES NOT begin these chapters, please ask for an updated manuscript/ARC: https://www.scribd.com/doc/267310694/...

If he thought he was going to grab her, he was going to get every last ounce of New York City she possessed. Etta swung her head around, searching for something sharp. Whoa! Whoa! Trust me when I say that this book was all sorts of surprising. You might have recalled that last week, I read Bracken's Darkest Minds and hated it, to say the least. I'm always willing to give the author another chance, but to be honest, I didn't have high hopes. That's not to mention the blurb being confusing and lo
And the premise involves time travel, which is something that's horrifying easy to fuck up in the hands of a poor writer.But I liked this book - a lot!
GIRL POWER, YEAH!To be honest, when we met Etta for the first time, I didn't have high hopes.
“You don’t think I’m good enough, do you?”“No, duck, no—”“Don’t call me that!” Etta said, backing out of the office.
I don’t have anything else!”“Etta—Henrietta,” Alice tried, but Etta was past the point of listening, of caring what either of them had to say.“I’m playing,” she told her instructor, “tonight, and at the debut.
Really great! Excited to see where the series goes!
Fantastic. Need the next one now. Or maybe yesterday.
It took me forever to finish this, and I wonder now, if it was worth it at all. There were some parts I truly enjoyed, but as a overall experience, I can't say that it was the best.
DNF @ 60%If I could sum up this book in one word, it would be this: tedious.Etta, a young woman on the cusp of adulthood, has spent her entire youth as a sheltered, lonely, talented violinist.
I’m not sure what the point of telling this story from third person PoV was.
Add to this some insta-lust/love/whatever between her and the male lead, some plot holes, and a whole lot of narrative that could have been cut out altogether and you wind up with one long, TEDIOUS, YA novel filled to the brim with reminders of why I so rarely return to this genre.
This is such a rich story with wonderful characters!
I don't think I'm quite as blown away as most people, but it was really good.This book didn't really start to pick up until about 150 pages in for me, so just give it some time whenever you pick it up - it hooks you eventually.WORLD BUILDING AND TIME TRAVEL WERE GREAT.
All of that was fantastic and interesting and unique and well done and I loved it.Overall I liked the characters, though the romance was a bit much sometimes.
I really need to know what happens next.Overall a great and fun read, but not BLOW ME AWAY THE BEST EVER AMAZING.
By the time it did happen, everything was NOT explained well and I was now both confused, bored, and exasperated.
This entire premise needed to be explained better, and between being completely bored, mostly annoyed with the generic premise, and partially confused at the action, I ended up skimming the last half of this book.
This might stem partially from the fact that i'm not a fan of historical fiction, but I just hate Alexandra Bracken's writing.
This book could have been half the size it actually is, which is nearly 500 pages.
Getting back on the goodreads train for 2016! This was an excellent first book, however it did not meet my expectations. I was wishing for a more epic adventure tale, the events leading up to the end of the book were lacking excitement. Although I have no doubt the second book is going to be amazing with the cliffhanger Alex left us with. More or my thought here: https://youtu.be/hkt26OBYv2A
Passenger highlights all of Bracken's strong suits: strong characters, extensive history research, character-driven plot, and shippable romance and keeps readers guessing until the very end.Violin prodigy, Etta Spencer, accidentally uncovers the secret society of time travelers and is thrust into a dangerous hunt to retrieve a powerful object that could change the world for the worst if fallen into the wrong hands.
A lot of this book is clue-solving and running, but I wish the plot could have slowed down a bit for the characters (and us readers) to explore the time periods.
I really enjoyed the main character Etta and the fast pace of this book!
The adventure she finds herself in was super fun and I just couldn't put this down!I'll have my full video review up in a couple of days!(view spoiler)[THAT ENDING.
Who knows.I really enjoyed that we got to see from Etta's and occasionally Nicholas's POV.
I loved them as partners!I'm super interested to see how Nicholas and Sophia work together in this next book.
WHERE on earth Etta ended up (and Julian as well).
❝Love was selfish, wasn't it? It made honest men want things they had no right to. It cocooned one from the rest of the world, erased time itself, knocked away reason. It made you live in defiance of the inevitable. It made you want another's mind, body; it made you feel as if you deserved to own their heart, and carve out a place in it.❞ I really wanted to like this one. I really did. But I knew I wouldn't because when it came out, there mixed reviews about it but even with the mixing added, m
It's different than most writers and even though that's good at times and refreshing, knowing there are authors out there that write stories a lot differently, it's told in ways where the journey isn't a fun one but a boring one where you just want to stop and put an end to it because it's nowhere near fun and entertaining.
Nothing really kept me intrigued, I just wanted to finish it and that is why I skimmed through a lot over and over and didn't care, didn't bother going back to see if I missed anything interesting since, there really wasn't.
I think if you're used to reading YA plots, this book will come off as a bit slow and tedious.
like the writing was good but I still wanted everything to get moving.The story reminded me a bit of Ruby Red by Kerstin Gier with how there are families that pass on the genetic ability to time travel, how the girl finds herself traveling to different times without any training, she's attracted to the guy she travels with, and her mission is to track down a missing device.
It also kind of reminded me of The Girl from Everywhere by Heidi Heilig with the whole ship & time travel stuff too, BUT it's totally its own story.
I had absolutely no expectations going into this one and I am glad to say that I throughly enjoyed it!This book was by no means perfect. At times it was a bit cliche and aspects of the plot were somewhat unoriginal. However what I loved about this book was that it allowed me to completely escape reality. I just had such a fantastic time exploring this world and falling in love with these characters that I didn't have to think about anything else. Overall, this was an extremely fun read and I can't wait to get to the sequel!
The Ironwoods are the largest family of time travellers and make all the rules.Passenger is told in two different perspectives from Etta and Nicholas, and in third person point of view.
I wanted to know more about how time travel works in this world and more information about the families and this secret object.
I enjoyed the descriptions of the different places they travelled to, however I don’t need to read that a side character put on more perfume or that Nicholas smells like sunshine for the hundredth time (what does sunshine even SMELL LIKE????
Video review to come!The concept was killer, the characters had a ton of potential, but this book really suffered from first book syndrome, symptoms being: chronic information dumps and a sloooow moving plot. It picked up a lot in the end and I really did have fun reading it, but I didn't love it as much as I had expected. I am excited to see where the series will go though!
So all throughout my life, society, the media, and my peers have indoctrinated me with the opinion that PASSENGER SUCKS !!And honestly I was  SOOOOOOOOOO  hesitant to start this book bc everyone knows I can’t handle another slump in my tragic life and slow pacing is not my best friend HOWEVER comma its was actually pretty decent. (s)  Pros - TIME !!- TRAVEL !!- Historic fiction owns my soul and it was bloody gorgeous - Nicholas Carter - The world buildings is 😍 😍- I LOVED TRAVELING TO DIFFERENT
-	don’t we all just LOVE an extra bought of insta-love in our lives??-	Too much kissing for being relatively foreign to each other I mean STRANGER DANGER KIDS-	Like she literally knows this guy for 2 days and shes willing to GIVE HER LIFE FOR HIM-	the pacing is slowwwwwwww-	THE CHAPTERS ARE SO BLOODY LONG WHO ALLOWED THIS-	too much descriptions involved, makes it difficult for attention to be held-	the ending made like 0 sense ???-	her mom pisses me the hell off-	also I wish the whole time travel thing was explained better -	had LOADS of potential but it just came off as v confusion  rather than well developed-	THE BOOK IS HEAVY man, like my arms were crying while I was holding it-	Guess who’s skipping her workout today?I’ve heard that book 2 is MUCH more entertaining and so this is why I pushed through and binged this book bc I need the cover of book 2 in my lifeAlso all my buddy reading partners ditched me and im forever hurt by their betrayal (s) “It's our choices that matter in the end.
I felt taken along for the journey with Etta and Nicholas, like I was travelling to all these unknown times and worlds myself.
The slow unravelling of the story and the mystery was great, and I loved how you had a little insight into each character that other characters didn't know about.
I loved both Etta and Nicholas in this (and I admit I kind of pictured them as Daisy Ridley and John Boyega from The Force Awakens??) Both were such captivating and charming and interesting characters.
I was denied (of course, Disney^^) but perhaps you'll be more lucky :) (view spoiler)[They never, ever, approve me (FOR REASONS, I guess), so it doesn't mean anything for you, try it out!
(hide spoiler)]Edit 04/29 : I think I'm in love with that cover.
Edit 04/14 : Alexandra Bracken just shared her Pinterest board she created for this series.https://www.pinterest.com/alex_bracke...DID I SAY I WANTED IT?
Okay, so let me sum up : it is a time travel story with pirates written by Alexandra Bracken.
Who created Liam.Okay - Of course I can't wait, hey, what do you think?["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>
Beautiful, smart, diverse, and well-researched.This is one of those times where the story on the inside matches perfectly with the amazing cover on the outside.Truly absorbing. Alex has woven in some delicate intricacies of history and shown how old hurts trickle up into society hundreds of years later. She manages to deal with some very important issues in a thoughtful, intriguing way.And the romance…love, love, LOVE. So much love for it!!
Video review coming later this month!!!
I absolutely loved Passenger.
It was completely different than a lot of books I normally read and extremely refreshing and unique!
I love how Alex Bracken can write something so different from The Darkest Minds, which is an absolute favorite of mine, and yet do so well with it!
Passenger just proves how much of a versatile, extraordinary writer she is.
Full review to come on my YouTube channel on the release day!I received a free copy of this book from Disney Hyperion.
I had no obligation to review this book and all opinions are my own.
His history and his back-story were even more interesting than Etta's.
A free-thinking independent 21st century teenage girl with a well-mannered 1920s young boy, how the year they were born in shaped who they were and who they could be.
They travel to different parts of history and it was so fun to read about.
She experienced history like no one else could and it was shocking to her.
I liked the story-line and the settings were just great fun to read about.
I'm pretty sure any historical romance fan would love this book!
I ended up just skimming the rest of this book. Eventually, it just dragged on. I definitely loved the concept of this book, though. I loved the time traveling and how they had to go to different years to search for an object. I also loved the characters. They were very interesting to read about. Overall, I found the plot kind of boring and very slow.
