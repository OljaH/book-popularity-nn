“There are worse things than death,” I say. “Shall we learn about them together?” 4 1/2 stars. When it comes to heart-racing action scenes, I cannot think of another YA author who does it better than Sabaa Tahir. She plunges you into the chaos almost immediately and once again, for the third book in a row, she keeps the drama and bloodshed coming until the very end.The ONLY reason I rated this book slightly lower than An Ember in the Ashes and A Torch Against the Night is that I felt like Elias
But maybe it was that Laia's and Helene's (sorry, the Blood Shrike's) perspectives were just so damn good that Elias's ghostly wanderings paled in comparison.If you've been enjoying this series up until now, there's no reason why your love shouldn't continue on with this book.
But I must prepare myself, for such stories are dragons drawn from a deep well in a dark place.
I'm not going to say too much about the story in case those reading this review haven't checked out the first two books yet.
I also find the Nightbringer very interesting and I can't wait to read more about him.Overall, it's a bloody, nasty book in a bloody, nasty series.
Devastating and excellent. Can't wait for the final installment! My full booktalk discussion is up on my youtube channel (polandbananasbooks). =)
So I'm seeing lots of turmoil in my feed but I thought I'd pop in.
I'm not crazy about switching covers/etc in a series either, but before you go off on a huge tangent, go check out Sabaa's reasoning for the changes.
My thoughts on the design/etc don't matter, and I happened to adore the old covers SO much, but this woman did a cool thing with her influence, and I'm so glad I know why!

OKAY BUT WHY DO WE HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL 2018???As if ONE year wasn't long enough, Sabaa goes and makes us wait TWO years for the next book. :((((((((What are we supposed to do until then? :'(
whyyyyy, sabaa, whyyyyyyy???(aside: mwahahahahahaha)you know how they tell you that good things come to those who wait?
i never bought into this school of thought bc i'm pretty much veruca salt when it comes to books.
but, holy hell, is A REAPER AT THE GATES worth it.
i was immediately drawn back into this darkly dangerous world and all its amazing characters.
each POV is distinct and painstakingly wrought.
exactly what you've come to expect from the brilliance of sabaa tahir.all i'm saying is that i need more.
in veruca salt singing voice: DON'T CARE HOW, I WANT IT NOWWWWWWW.
THIS COMES OUT THIS YEAR. Holy moly, time has passed rather quickly. But I'm still not happy about the cover style change. Hmph. Meaningly, my torturous, never-ending wait.  Because freaking 2018.
I had no option but to not form any attachment, since we weren’t given any breathing room for the plot to slow down and for it to shift to the characters.Book One was great.
But yet again, I feel like we weren’t given any and the focus was still on the plot and these characters trying to navigate and fix the messed up world they lived in.
At this point I couldn’t think of anymore excuses to give and just became fuckin’ annoyed that these characters had no substance and weren’t convincing in their power and magic at all.
I hope Helene murders all the hateful peasants, rules the world and finds someone worthy of her greatness.
Me:  Nothing can be worse than the Tower of Dawn coverA Reaper at the Gates: *exists*#WhatTheFuckAn Ember in the Ashes is one of my favorite series ever. I don't deserve this.
I have to say, there is no one in the writing game quite like Sabaa Tahir when it comes to opening up EVERY book with heart-pounding intensity.
When I read the first 80 pages of this book I NOPED and put it down so fast not because it wasn't good, but because things were not going well for the characters and I knew it was about to get SO MUCH WORSE.
So despite knowing that my heart was about to get stomped on I willingly dove myself back into the story of Laia, Elias, and Helene for the third time and I was not disappointed.
The immediacy of Tahir's writing remains spot-on, but the beautiful prose found in An Ember in the Ashes is absent in the third installment of the series. Too much of A Reaper at the Gates reads like filler, and the narrative lacks compelling focus with characters seemingly running in circles. The plot hinges on a reveal that's been blazing red since the first book in the series. The Nightbringer remains a tool used for narrative convenience, and Tahir's continued underutilization of one of the series' most pivotal characters [(view spoiler)[Laia's brother, Darin (hide spoiler)]] is an unforgivable transgression.
im trying to imagine how it would feel to finish a book and NOT BE WORRIED ABOUT THE FATE OF MY BABIES IN THE FINAL BOOK👏LET👏ELIAS👏AND👏LAIA👏BE👏HAPPY👏ᵖˡᵉᵃˢᵉ4.5 stars buddy read  with this reading disaster machine~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~what the heck happened to the matching cover designs????the title is 💯💯💯👌👌👌💯💯 but the cover is so OFF AND NOW IM SAD AND CONFUSED WHY DONT WE HAVE MATCHING COVERS!!!!. . . also. . .is anyone gonna mention how gorgeous elias looks??!?!?!!
Sabaa Tahir has this way with her writing that makes the reader FEEL every emotion.
From the writing to the plot, to the world building all the way to the characters, everything is so captivating and completely addictive.
I'm elated that we finally got to see more of the connection between Helene and Harper♥, now if Helene would get out of her own way :( Also, I love the character of Darin, Laias brother and of course lets not forget the newcomer Musa.
“Don't start now.”“What I feel for Elias is different, a flame I hold close to my heart when I feel my strength flagging.
I can't talk about this plot.Ughhh I'll just say that I'm not HAPPY with where the story is going, buuuut also love it.
I loved how there's more of a story for the Nightbringer too.
The book felt a bit darker (or maybe just bleak at times) but there's also a strong theme of love, hope, & humanity through it all.
I'm realllllly hoping that the next book can whip out some kind of conveniently semi-happy ending, but I'm excited for it no matter what!
eventually it picked up and things got really intense and gripping and the story progressed, but for so long it seemed like everyone was just looking at their watches, killing time.
i’m not sure if it’s series fatigue on my part or on the author’s, but the last 1/4 of the book proves there’s still a story to be told and new hearts to break and as always, there’s a strong cliffhanger that makes me eager to see what comes next.
Love cannot live here.  When one of your favorite authors in the world has a new book coming out, it generally becomes your whole world. You have laser focus. Books lose that quality that always seems to drag you in. You obsess and rant and annoy so many people, yet you just could care less-until the day comes and you finally have it in your hands and you can’t devour it quick enough. This is that book. I just so happened to be one of those lucky Bloggers/Bookstagrammers that was a part of the
She hurt me in ways I can’t explain-Cal is my DARLING and I just think it was a case of trying to make so many female characters strong, that she almost backpedaled and made some of the more solid moments of the series all for not-just to prove ‘I female.
Where my other boy was brought down to an almost sad loser (I still love him, don’t be fooled) by the author’s hand, Sabaa makes Elias an even stronger character-Laia is strong.
Elias could ruin everything in one moment-for the whole world as he knows it-but he can’t give himself up completely if it means Laia will be hurt.
“Curse this world for what it does to the mothers, for what it does to the daughters. Curse it for making us strong through loss and pain, our hearts torn from our chests again and again. Curse it for forcing us to endure.” Look, I'm gonna do something a bit weird here and start with the negatives I REALLY, really enjoyed reading this book but at the same time I had some niggling little issues that I was waiting for some action on and it never came. I need to talk about them. this is an excelle
Look, I'm gonna do something a bit weird here and start with the negatives I REALLY, really enjoyed reading this book but at the same time I had some niggling little issues that I was waiting for some action on and it never came.
time But with that being said, I feel like Sabaa Tahir underused some characters so badly here, and it was extremely disappointing.
I really liked the role Laia has stepped into and the political/military heavy nature of Helene's story arc.My other criticism that I want to get out of the way ties into the above and that is the plot had no clear focus for the first half.
Plus, even if I still love him with my whole heart and think that he deserves a future full of rainbows and jam with Laia, I didn't enjoy Elias's storyline.But leaving those two things aside, the book is perfect.
Our three protagonists, Laia, Elias and Helene, are on their own journeys doing different things but they all have the same goal, to protect their loved ones and the world in general.As for the romance, being A reaper at the gates a plot driven book, it's in the background.
Full review to come soon! Let's just say after this:I still love HeleneElias is amazing and my heart for him..Laia, I've really grown to enjoy her character.So many plot twists I did not seeing coming...like at all!The ending....what???Amazing book, I expected nothing less from this series!
If you're buying the books with these covers, the older editions also got revamped, and together they look alright I guess...but my bookshelf feng shui is going to be thrown off.
Here are the remakes of the original covers, in case you haven't seen them.So at least the color hues are similar....Cover reveal:Kept seeing these comments about the book cover, and I kept scrolling cause I was like dunno what that is don't care.
Really, why did they change the cover style?And why does Elias look like he just popped out of Assasin's Creed?****EDIT-Answers to my initial questions found in this interview
All I can say is that this book and series definitely live up to their hype and I’m not kidding when I say this is probably the best one so far?
Laia, Helene and Elias all suffer tremendous losses in this book and they hurt.
The Waiting Place and the magic within kept tugging at him which resulted in my baby boy being ripped away from essential moments and scenes where Laia really needed him, it was maddening and frustrating.
All in all Elias’s chapters hurt the most and I honestly don’t know what I’ll do when the last book is out.
Yoooo this was bloody amazing and so much better than the last one, I loved it!! My heart hurts for my poor soul catcher and I have to say Laia has grown on me but Helene is still a queen 👏🏼 I really like the mythological side the plot has taken and I can’t wait to read about all the shit that will go down in the last book😊
This cover is freaking AMAZE BALLS! Guess I will go over and pre-order for NEXT YEAR. Lol
Okay but why did you change the cover because I own the first two and now they won't match and I mean it's super cool looking and I love it but can we finish one edition and then start the other because I'll have them both
Not only this, but we see the cost it brings them, and with this you really see into each characters emotion throughout and that is what I love so much about this book in particular.The build up throughout is nerve wracking, and I honestly got such a strong sense of The Lord of the Ringsand Battle of the Bastards (Game of Thrones) in regards to some of the action… that’s how on edge I was throughout.
Its almost as if publishers don't understand readers at all. Publisher : What should we do with the cover of the third book in the series?Cover Designer : We should make it   COMPLETELY DIFFERENT! Publisher : Perfect! The readers will love it! Readers:
8/14/17WE HAVE A TITLE, I REPEAT.
WE HAVE A TITLE.
I am the definition of sHOOKETH by the TITLE BUT THE COVER?????
AM I THE ONLY ONE SLIGHTLY DISAPPOINTED AND BY SLIGHTLY I MEAN WTFFFFFF Hun, take a look at the rest of your fam.
Look.
Maybe.I'm not cover hating except I totally am but like...
Let's just be happy we have a cover with pretty pictures.
But why couldn't you match 😫And maybe it'll match with the fourth one?
We gotta wait 8 months for this to come out and then like another year or so after that (but I hope the fourth one matches???)Amberish.
“Curse this world for what it does to the mothers, for what it does to the daughters. Curse it for making us strong through loss and pain, our hearts torn from our chests again and again. Curse it for forcing us to endure.”...Ya know, I shouldn't even be surprised at this point. I knew from Sabaa's instagram feed that this book would rip my heart out, but  man.  A Reaper at the Gates successfully made me a shell of my former self, and I honestly don't know what I'm going to do until the fourth b
A Reaper at the Gates successfully made me a shell of my former self, and I honestly don't know what I'm going to do until the fourth book comes out.What can I even say?This installment in the Embers Quartet has everything you could ever want.
It's insane how far she's come since book one, and I'll continue to love her even when this series concludes.
Cook plays a much bigger role in this installment of the series, and I was overwhelmed by the depth of her character.There are so many evil surprises in this book that'll have you screaming.
So I caved and the reread happened. Buddy read with this fake Canadian—————————————MY HEART STILL HURTS. To the point where I’m itching to reread Reaper already.If you haven’t read this book or started this series, I urge you to do so immediately. Everyone needs to know the pain and the joy.—————————————IT’S HERE, IT’S FINALLY HERE. At long last.I can’t wait to be destroyed.
Do you ever read a book and go I wonder how would I feel if I read this in a different time or in a different format?I do that with a lot of my books, especially the ones I love. But for this one, I have no doubt I would've loved it no matter what, I was just hooked from the first chapter till the last one.ANDIFRICKENLOVEELIAS
