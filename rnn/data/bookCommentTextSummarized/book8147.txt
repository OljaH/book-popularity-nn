A good novel for a rainy day or an unexciting journey.(view spoiler)[ this book has a Ted score of three, meaning, good to know about, but not to seek out and read (hide spoiler)]
Of course, most people don't realize this - they fondly imagine that their lives are unique....jus as well too, because when you do tumble to it, the effect is very disturbing."This quotation comes two thirds of the way through this great little book and it just tickled my fancy though the actual plot of this novel would be of purely historic interest.
Its main theme is of a committed catholic couple trying desperately not to get pregnant whilst not using artificial conception but instead reverting to the contortions and skewed thinking that saw 'natural family planning' with its thermometers and calendars and 'yep you're clear for entry sir' (obviously not quite how the Vatican would phrase it but.....) as a more loving and nurturing road for a couple.
His thesis topic, which was a commentary on all of the British essayists, was changed by his advisor to: “Very Long Sentences in the works of Three Victorian Novelists.” The research he had done so far on the essayists, particularly those of Egbert Merrymarsh, a lesser known writer of the period, was of no use.
Thus far, he had not yet picked out which three Victorian writers he would concentrate on, nor had he any idea on what constituted a “very long sentence.” On top of all this, of course, was his constant worry about his wife becoming pregnant again.
Adam Appleby es un joven que en los años 60 trabaja en su tesis de doctorado sobre Literatura Inglesa, no tiene trabajo y sospecha que su familia está a punto de agrandarse otra vez (ya tiene tres hijos).
Extrañamente, no soy adepta a las novelas o cuentos que tienen a la Literatura como eje principal, giran alrededor de él, mencionan autores o libros cada párrafo y medio y los dan por conocidos.
Es entretenido (en este caso, no es lo mismo que “divertido”) y presenta una óptica distinta para alguien que no está muy al tanto de los problemas de los matrimonios católicos, pero si parte del objetivo era hacerme reír, no cumplió con él.
For various reasons I only read it in very short snatches and this may have contributed to my lack of warmth for this book, but in my defense if I had been more interested I probably would have made time for it (as I have done for many others once I got started.) Furthermore, there have been plenty of other books that I read in the same manner (five minutes here, five minutes there) that I rate much more highly.My copy has a thirteen page introduction (written 15 years after the original publication) which I read first and now wonder if it would not have been better to do so afterwards.
Has a lot of common with Lodge's later novel, How Far Can You Go?
Like that book, this is a comic novel about British Catholics.
If Catholic beliefs seem to you self-evident tripe, Lodge provides enough context to help you understand, even sympathise with his poor characters, why they accept something you would not.
If you want all the Catholic perks, they feel, you can't pick and mix minor things like controlling your own fertility.
One feels genuine pity for the hero's wife (and Lodge's) who spends much of the novel stuck full of thermometers and studying graphs, all to try and predict a safe time to shag.
Me sorprendió bastante, y superó mis expectativas.Es un libro breve, que cuenta la historia de un día en la vida de un hombre británico, católico practicante y que dedica sus días a leer en la biblioteca del Museo Británico para poder terminar su tesis doctoral, y a la vez, intenta no tener hijos en la época previa al Concilio Vaticano Segundo, cuando la anticoncepción era considerada un pecado aún más terrible que lo que es hoy por la iglesia.
This contains a wonderfully accurate description of the loneliness and despair of the dissertation writer.
Uma abordagem aos problemas dos casais católicos nos anos 60 face à questão da contracepção feita com humor ainda que britânico
Britanski muzej propada je vrlo duhovit roman, pun izuzetnih parodija i aluzija na poznata djela svjetske književnosti.
Najočiglednija i, možda, najsmješnija je u samom epilogu koji završava poput Džojsovog Uliksa.Inače, glavni lik je dvadesetpetogodišnji postdiplomac Adam Eplbi, nezaposleni otac troje djece, preopterećen mogućnošću da mu je žena ponovo trudna.
Vrlo zabavno i kratko štivo zagarantovanog kvaliteta koje će se naročito svidjeti svim istinskim ljubiteljima književnosti i takozvanih modernih klasika, ali i svima onima koji vole zdrav britanski humor koji ne preza ni pred čim.
U životu je obrnuto.“ Inače, pravi knjigoljupci, bez djece, mogu ovaj pitki roman pročitati za manje od dva sata.
Poor Adam Appleby has several problems.
Second, Adam's future career in academe is highly dubious unless he finishes his long-overdue thesis on English Literature, with which he wrestles aimlessly day after day in the library of the British Museum.
Third, these problems have made Adam so addled that the boundaries between reality and literature are beginning to get a bit fuzzy -- as life increasingly begins to imitate art, poor Adam is never quite sure whether or not he's stepped out of his front door that morning to find himself plopped in the middle of a novel by Kafka, James, Conrad, Hemingway or James Joyce.
2015 LBC Bingo: Fanfic/PasticheThis book has a fascinating premise: a scholar studying in the British Museum is so affected by what he is reading, his narrative of a day in his life takes on the style of what he is currently reading.
According to the afterward, the author mimics: Joseph Conrad, Graham Greene, Ernest Hemingway, Henry James, James Joyce, Franz Kafka, D.
I have to admit that evidently my knowledge of British literature is rather poor because I noticed exactly zero of those influences.
However, the book is charmingly British and highly comedic so even the unlearned can still enjoy this quick and fun read.
Some fellow Joycean recommended this book to me; whom I don't recall.The British Museum is Falling Down: timidly parodical, quirky British humor mimicking Modern literary styles while betraying scrimpy style of its own. Faintly quaint, or quaintly faint. A cross-pollination of problems attendant upon questions of human fertility, religion and esoteric literary research that is perfectly appealing if that particular three-way intersection holds out a compelling interest. Otherwise think of a sort of mild-mannered academic Londoner-Catholic version of a Woody Allen tale.Like that.
The description of a student's life as a researcher in the BM Reading Room resonates with me, even to the homage to Karl Marx. I remember my days in the BM well and this book captures the experience meticulously. As a bonus, the novel is also funny. The parodies are fine and the situations hilarious. Oh those fumbling but menacing butchers. The days of criticism versus scholarship seem mostly past now, and so the book carries a nostalgia softly. Even the Beatles sort of show up. And don't let me forget the contraceptives
The story of a single, ordinary day told as a series of pastiches. Like Ulysses, only actually FUN TO READ.
More fun in Midlands UK - this time, it's a book that takes place in one single day in the 1960s. Ace!
One of the funniest books by Lodge. With a wonderful passage of Martian chronicles at the beginning of the novel.
I love David Lodge's earlier books. They are very funny.
no conocía al autor y la novela es de los sesenta. me gustó. humor inglés en todo su esplendor, crítica a la academia y al catolicismo.
Delightfully funny with a charming epilogue. Each chapter is a parody of another novelists' style.
Very funny and gentle ribbing of literary and academic culture, as well as pre-Vatican 2 Cathoic culture.
Dear David,I hope this review finds you well.You will be delighted to know that I've just finished to read "The British Museum is Falling Down" that juvenile novel of yours which, although widely ignored back in 1965, later became one of the most successful books you wrote.Dave, you know how much I like pretty much everything you wrote (apart from literary criticism, but that's my Achille's heel) and I would like to be frank with you as I've always been: this novel disappointed me.Perhaps, it's more my fault than yours.
Há tempos li a “Terapia”, livro mundialmente conhecido e reconhecido como sendo um livro hilariante e não sei que mais, mas o certo é que não dei mais de 3 estrelas e por algumas gargalhadas que me arrancou.Neste "O Museu Britânico ainda vem abaixo”, enfim, tem menos qualidade do que “Terapia”.A história é a seguinte:Anos 60, um jovem casal, que segue direitinho os mandamentos do catolicismo, vive um dilema ou poderemos dizer um drama: Não consegue ter uma vida sexual feliz e agradável.
During one of the conversations in the story, Lodge does make reference to the fact that whilst all classic literature involved slaying dragons, the modern novel can revolve around the day of an average person – and the fact that so many books like this are being written means that people nowadays must be living lives already lived by characters in books).
But if this is the sort of novel that educated people deem “Brilliantly funny” – I’m not sure I want to be one of those people.I suppose this book would have been enlightening for people who don’t know much about the Roman Catholic faith.
Plus exactement, ça fait déjà quelques années qu'il tente de boucler sa thèse dont le sujet est "La strutucture des phrases longues dans trois romans anglais modernes".
A ce jour, il n'a pas choisi les trois romans en question et n'est pas encore parvenu à se décider sur la longueur à partir de laquelle une phrase peut prétendre à entrer dans cette catégorie.
Malheureusement, lire des livres toute la journée, confortablement installé dans l'un des rares fauteuils rembourés de la salle de lecture du British Museum, ne rapporte pas trop d'argent.Dés les premières pages ont est embarqué dans cette histoire à l'humour corrosif.
That was a problem in my enjoyment of the book however: I could see there were shifts in the narration, but apart from three cases, I didn't know the author "pastiched" well enough (or often enough, at all) to recognise it and appreciate the effort.
Apart from that, the book was enjoyable enough, but I found the main character neither that likeable nor that interesting, so I wasn't left with much enthusiasm.
I was also a little bit frustrated with the attitude of the characters about the ban of contraception in the Catholic church and kept mentally screaming at them "just use a condom, who cares, not Jesus that's who!".

Sementara petuah bijaksana pastor paroki kurang mendapat tempat di hati dan pikirannya.Membaca buku ini sekali lagi saya teringat akan kebijaksaan Gereja tentang keluarga dan perkawinan yang disusun dan ditulis oleh mereka yang tidak pernah berkeluarga dan tidak pernah menikah.
Satu teguran dari Vatican telah diberikan kepada hirarki Gereja Indonesia empatpuluhan tahun lalu karena menyerahkan masalah kontrasepsi ini kepada hati nurani dan kesepakatan sang suami istri.
Suatu jalan tengah yang diambil oleh mereka yang tidak pernah berkeluarga dan tidak pernah menikah.Semoga mereka yang berkeluarga tidak merasa kecil hati ketika berhadapan dengan Humanae Vitae.
This one contains his much quoted remark that "literature is mostly about having sex and not much about having children, whereas real life is the other way round."It's written as a literary parody, which I confess I didn't notice until the end (I've never read James Joyce but the neverending sentence was a giveaway) and only Lodge's endnote cleared up who else he was pastiching (even then, I thought the sherry party scene very reminiscent of Lucky Jim, and was surprised this wasn't one of the books he as pastiching).
Este libro me ha gustado bastante, quiz�� no tanto como esperaba (y por eso 4 estrellas), pero es que esperaba much��simo de uno de mis escritores brit��nicos favoritos.
El protagonista, Adam Appleby, es totalmente genial, as�� como la parodia de los eruditos y estudiosos acad��micos, los estudiantes de doctorado, los cat��licos, el mundo de las Humanidades...
Life is the other way round." La verdad es que reconozco que este libro no le gustar��a a la mayor��a de mis conocidos...
pero es que ninguno de ellos es un angl��filo empedernido como yo :)
