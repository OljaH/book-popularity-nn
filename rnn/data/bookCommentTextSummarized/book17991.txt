Short version:Qhuin and Blay got a corny story and played second third fourth fiddle in their own book.
I know Ward has a typical style of writing but until a few books ago there was distinction between different characters' POVs. Now all of them have the same generic Brother-on-crack voice.
For Qhuin and Blay's story to be different from the little bits and pieces we saw of them in the previous books.
Like my friend Tara said: "It's like reading the book before theirs."More importantly: we have waited for Qhuinn and Blay to get together for years.
QHUAY RELATIONSHIPThe thing is that Qhuinn and Blay were pretty much ready to be together many books ago.
They could have gotten together right when Qhuinn begged Blay to have sex with him.Instead, Blay lied through the whole book about Saxton.
I wonder if anyone working on this series still takes it seriously, tbh.PARALLELSThere were parallels between Qhuinn and Blay through the whole book.
There were many ways to develop this character right, but like anything else lately with this series: Badly Executed.I can’t believe 20 pages before the ending of their book, Qhuinn was still saying he was not gay.
Because Blay is Qhuinn's family.Qhuay will always be my OTP.
I ♥ Qhuay. Review to come.
There is not a moment of complacency, you might think you know where she is taking you and then a spanner is thrown in the works to take us in another direction… I was enthralled and captivated, and yes, at times frustrated and impatient but still turning the pages at an alarming rate, trying to absorb and digest each new piece of information.
They were going to be treated by the same standards as any other couple and I was over the moon about it.In the past year, i.e., the period that intervened between the aforementioned announcement and the release of the book, discussions soared and expectations climbed to heights unprecedented in the series, with fans demanding, among other things and in no particular order: a full HEA for their favourite couple, full on m/m sex, lots of romance, bonding scents, a confession of undying love from Qhuinn, Qhuinn on his knees in front of Blay, Qhuinn bottoming, Qhuinn crying, Qhuinn suffering, Blay developing some backbone (what many fans call 'alpha Blay'), Blay coming out to his parents, and many more, ranging from the relatively typical and valid to the totally unrealistic.Fast forward to last week, when I finally got to read Lover At Last.
Joy Happiness Contentment Also... Yep, I liked it. The Qhuinn and Blay moments were touching, emotional, fulfilling, and oh yeah, scorching HOT. The first sex scene was so surreal, I thought I was reading fanfic for a second. I had to pause and collect myself. It's really happening!!!Okay, so it wasn't perfect. There are certainly things wrong with this book (gay men CAN have sex in positions other than doggy style), but the reason I counted down the days to this release - all the things I've pi
The Qhuinn and Blay moments were touching, emotional, fulfilling, and oh yeah, scorching HOT.
There are certainly things wrong with this book (gay men CAN have sex in positions other than doggy style), but the reason I counted down the days to this release - all the things I've pined about and wanted for these two - Ward delivered.
I mean,(view spoiler)[Blay giving Qhuinn his ring?
And I want to hear ALL about those piercings down below.Also, I want Saxton to move on and mend his broken heart with someone new, hopefully in the next book.
Not only does she gift readers with scorching hot sex scenes that rock the chandeliers but provides enough heat and heart into the scenes so that it’s just as emotional as it is physical.Angst is one thing that has followed Qhuinn and Blay for most of their journey so it’s not a surprise that Ward would threaten to shatter readers’ hearts once again in LOVER AT LAST.
I know a lot of readers didn’t like Layla because of her involvement with Qhuinn and I wondered how Ward would change that if she planned on writing a book about her but hell, she completely changed my mind about her.
the very very very end is super cute and only slightly ruined by a horrible reference to Don't Stop Believing.what i didn't like:the plots: this book is not about Qhuinn and Blay.
there are 12 POVs.QhuinnA black guy who would be a lesser if he didn't die.LaylaXcorAssailWrathMr.C - forelesserTrezSolaZypheriAmSaxtonfor what i think was meant to be a paranormal romance this was too many POVs. TOO DAMN MANY!the lack of actual romance: the first two times Qhuinn and Blay have sex it's after traumatic events dealing with people in Qhuinn's life.
at this point i actually don't want to read Trez's book.
4 Finding Yourself Stars SpoilersFirst 2014Reread 4/11/2017 "I'm sorry I've wasted so much time - and if you don't want to be with me, I get it. I'll back off - I'll live with the consequences. But for the love of God, if there's a chance - for whatever reason on your side - revenge, curiosity...hell, even if you'll let me fuck you just once and never, ever again, for the sole reason of driving a stake through my heart? I'll take it. I'll take you...any way I can get you."-QhuinnLover at Last is
As much as I loved Qhuinn and Blay, I was very frustrated with Qhuinn pushing Blay away in past books and felt this read was going to be a very dramatic one.
I mean I love Blay and I understand that after years of Qhuinn pushing him away he is scared of getting hurt but damn.
Waiting for you...and we love you."-Qhuinn and Layla
Bottom line with Qhuinn and Blay's book is I love them as a couple but I didn't like the journey their relationship took to get to their HEA.
*full review posted**this will be spoilerish*  Qhuinn watched from a vast distance as his own hand reached out and touched Blay’s face, the fingertips running over the five o’clock shadow. “I’m sorry.”Oh, God, to touch him. To feel the warmth of his skin, to inhale his clean, masculine scent.“I’m sorry.”  I am a very big fan of the series, and I'm incredibly happy these two guys got their happy end, they really deserved it after all these years <3That said, this could have been better. No dou
It's just, nothing really important happens here, there isn't any big deal with any bad guys, just them dealing with their feelings and being angry at one another.After Saxton finishes his re-write of the law, he realises it's over between him and Blay, and they break up.Qhuinn doesn't know that, but is willing to have an affair with Blay all the same, just so he can be with him.That leads to some very steamy sex scenes, a whole lot of fights and misunderstandings, and a happy end at the very end of the book :)The end.

  TEAM QHUAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!OMGODDESS THE COVER IS GORGEOUS!!!!!!! VA VA VA VOOM! *drool*
I actually had an easier time rewarding 4 stars to the previous books because my expectations weren't that high to begin with, and I felt like I'd been given more than what I was expecting.
Decisions, decisions...If you've read up through book 10 in this series, this review will be safe to read outside of the spoiler tags.
I really want Xcor and Layla to get their own book.
You know who I don't want getting a book?
I found myself skimming a good portion of the book (outside of Qhuay, the brothers and Xcor/Layla, of course).Assail and Sola?
(view spoiler)[Qhuinn's brother?
5 AT LAST stars!!! It’s no secret that I am a little obsessed with the BDB. Ever since I’ve started reading this series, I’ve been hooked. Although Vishous is my favorite brother, Qhuinn has always been a close second. There is just something about him I love. That being said, I have been SO EXCITED to read Lover At Last. This is the book that got me to start BDB in the first place. It was blowing up my newsfeed and I thought- PNR- m/m? YES! I have to read this series. I really feel its only far
Blay tries to move on with Saxton, pushes Qhuinn out of his life.
So what happens when Qhuinn and Blay finally come together?
The end of Qhuinn and Blay’s story left me with the biggest smile on my face :D I feel like they FINALLY got the ending they both deserved.
Although Qhuinn and Blay’s story was the biggest part of the book, it wouldn’t be a BDB book without other multiple story lines going on.
The only tiny complaint I have, is that I wish there would have been just a little less outside stories, and more Qhuinn and Blay.
4+ FINALLY StarsThe story, we have all been waiting for. The book that we were raving about for a whole year and my personal initiation in the M/M genre. (details below)Ladies and Gentlemen... (or Gentlemale if you part of the glymera) Love. The difference between someone “loving” somebody versus being “in love” was a curb to the Grand Canyon. The head of a pin to the entire Midwest. An exhale to a hurricane. Qhuinn is really the son of no one.Rejected by his own family, without bloodline and re
His only solace: fighting in the Brotherhood, his desire to built a family and have a child and his one and only comfort…Blaylock son of Rocke.Blay was always there for Qhuinn.
I felt invested in this story and I fell in love with these two incredible men… Now, aside Quay, the rest of the book was a little all over the place… It signifies a time of transition and a fundamental change in the world of the brothers but I was really kinda bored reading all about Xcor and Sola and Elan and a bunch of others..
But what I got was a whole lotta time spent building up love stories for Xcor & Layla, Assail & Sola, and Trez & Selena.
Let Quay share the spotlight with one other couple, just to entice me, but to butcher their book to the point that I have to "book mark" the Trez, Assail, Lessor, Sola, Layla, Xcor parts just so I can come back to them later, is UNFAIR to the FANS!!
The book would have been so much better!!SaxtonSaxton was written out of Blay's love life in a manner that was honest and respectable.
I asked Goodreads readers, fans of the Black Dagger Brotherhood series, and most especially fans of Qhuay (Qhuinn & Blay) for their thoughts on the book. They were allowed 5 words each. Here's what they had to say: *********************************************************spoiler-free review* “Because I was, and I remain, utterly and completely and totally…in love with you.” I am a fan’ish of the BDB series.

I asked Goodreads readers, fans of the Black Dagger Brotherhood series, and most especially fans of Qhuay (Qhuinn & Blay) for their thoughts on the book.
I’ve liked the books in varying degrees throughout.
None of that matters when it comes to Qhuinn and Blay.
It’s not like the friends-to-lovers, miscommunication-ridden angst, soul mates storyline is new.
QHUINN AND BLAY!
Sexy, heartbreaking, HOT, loving, CARING, beautiful, intense…you get the full gamut with them…and even ONE word would have been worth it…so I’m thankful for what we did get in this book of our beloveds.
*Disclaimer*--I have endeavored to make this spoiler-free, but beware anyway.It’s been a long time coming, but readers of the Black Dagger Brotherhood series finally get to see the culmination of the romantic entanglement between Qhuinn and Blay.
While I never saw them as a future mating, their interactions showed a strong bond of friendship and caring, and the courteous way he treated Layla warmed me to Qhuinn, as well has his loyalty and bravery in fighting for the Brotherhood.
At the end of this book, I realized that I truly loved Qhuinn, he has become one of my favorite characters in this series, which is saying something!BlayI have always loved Blay.
"Even if he got shanked, even if his precious little ego and his dumb-ass little heart got shattered into a million pieces, it was time to stop the bullshit.
It was time to be a male.
As Blay started to straighten, like a message had been received, Qhuinn thought, That's right, buddy.
Our future has come." -Lover Reborn♥♥♥♥♥BRING ON THE QHUAY LOVIN', WARDEN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I'm SO ready.♥♥♥♥♥OMG, IT'S PERFECT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Why isn't this in my hands right now?!♥♥♥♥♥FROM THE WARDEN ON FB:“Let me kiss you.” Qhuinn groaned as he leaned in.
“I know I don’t deserve it, but please .
I don’t give a f**k, I’ll beg.
“You've always had me ... and my heart. My soul. Everything. I wish it hadn't taken this long for me to man up.”  I'd been waiting this book since I started reading Dark Lover. Qhuinn and Blay are my main ship, I shipped them so hard even when I gave up on them. I just wanted to shake Qhuinn and knocked some sense into him. I pitited Blay for loving his best friend, and I thought that they being together were impossible, Is it plausible for them to see each other in the same light and know that
Qhuinn and Blay are my main ship, I shipped them so hard even when I gave up on them.
I pitited Blay for loving his best friend, and I thought that they being together were impossible, Is it plausible for them to see each other in the same light and know that their feelings aren't different ?
And I love you," Blay repeated.
Qhuinn has been rejected all his life, he belongs to nowhere and has no family, the one he has is Blay, and he can't lose him.
FIVE AT LAST STARS. “You've always had me ... and my heart. My soul. Everything. I wish it hadn't taken this long for me to man up.”  April 28th 2013 was the date I started my brotherhood journey and here I am three months down the line and finally up to date with the black dagger brotherhood series and what a journey it has been. I've said this before but it has to be said again I never thought I would be so caught up in a series about vampire warriors and their love, pain, war and lives. Lover
Lover at last, follows the same pattern as the others in the series interweaving the brothers lives by chapter but the shining stars in this tale is Blaylock and Qhuinn our very own 'Qhay', this story has a taste of everything to suit most paranormal romance lovers - suspense, action, war, love, drama, unrequited love, declarations and as a added bonus to top off this genre we see a continuation of epic vampire warrior life.
A story not to be missed in the series, heartache and tears to be expected but JR Ward delivers to her readers once again with a taste of epic love and longing of hearts.
More like he couldn’t breathe.Reminding himself not to be a world-revolves-around-me asshole, Qhuinn brought it back to what was happening between Blay and Saxton.“I don’t want that for you,” he said, his eyes roaming around that face.
Man…too late to answer that—he was reaching forward with his other hand and putting the palm on that heavy shoulder.“I’m sorry.”Oh, God, he was drawing Blay in, pulling that body up against his own.
It had been too long since he’d touched the guy…and never like this.“I’m sorry.”Palming the back of Blay’s head, he urged the male closer to him, tucking that face into his own neck.

Male/Male Romance in the Mainstream...at Last Well, I'm a happy, puddly, messy romantic sap. That's all there is to it. This book was everything that I asked for and even a little more. --Was there a lot of fan pandering? (view spoiler)[Absolutely (hide spoiler)]. I don't even mind a little bit. --Were there a few easy paths taken? (view spoiler)[Yes. (hide spoiler)] I just breezed
(hide spoiler)] And for the way it was delivered, J.R. Ward has my appreciation and respect.There's a reason I read romance and this is it.
Even though a lot of the book felt like pandering, I really did get a sense that Ward is still there steering the story in a direction she wants it to go.
You could take it as all of those people are just happy they're getting their HEA.I feel like, since I had that Facebook conversation with Ward yesterday, that I have to take her for her word (she is the writer, afterall), that to her the story being told is about Qhuinn.
♥♥♥ QHUINN & BLAY!!! ♥♥♥Our beloved boys are FINALLY getting their story, and they are getting it the true and proper way...in a full-blown BDB world-building hardback NOVEL!!!

  Thoughts Before Reading
Qhuay, YAY!!!! Qhuay happy dance!! *swoons* Qhuay happy dance!! *faints*Somebody better have some smelling salts and the crash cart defibrillator paddles ready!!!!
This can be great when it's a character you like because they'll pop up in books outside of their own, even in scenes that would be better served by someone else because it's obvious Ward just wants to write them.
But Layla is pregnant and this is The Most Important Thing in the World so this of course leads to Layla asking Blay to see if she smells pregnant and so on.For the majority of the book Layla is in danger of miscarrying the baby so of course this leads to many, many scenes with the ever-present Doc Jane who seems to have forgotten that she treated a pregnant Bella and gives Ward another chance to make us hate Havers.
Genre:  MM Paranormal RomanceType: Book 11 of Black Dagger BrotherhoodPOV: Third PersonRating: From a young age Qhuinn had been an outcast.
Being a fighter for the Brotherhood helped, but a rift with his onced best friend was killing him inside.After years of pining after his best friend, Blaylock finally moved on.
I'm glad that he learned to stand up for himself even though what he did kind of hurt lol!Qhuinn and Blay's journey started as best friends, turned enemy and finally became lovers.
I'm looking forward to whichever direction the series is going.Note: I love Qhuinn and Blay but WTF with the epilogue?!
I don't need to know about Assail (the fucking cokehead douchebag) and fucking Sonia (whatever her names is) the cat burglar, I wanted to kill something every time a Qhuay chapter ended, and I had to read about fucking Trez and his sex addiction!!!!!Ok that being said...I did love a lot of things about the story:1.
I always felt like I never really knew Blay and in this novel I finally understood him.In the end, I was mostly satisfied and if I could only rate Qhuinn and Blay I probably would have given the story five stars, but I was bogged down with all the tangents.
BUT as it makes a major breaktrough in mainstream fiction, and that is a BIG DEAL, my rating will be 5 stars.Also:*I've been waiting for this since LM.*It got me into m/m, for which it deserves another star.That doesn't say I'm happy with all of it.
Although, I am truly happy it is a novel, because as stated earlier - and it deserves to be mentioned multiple times, this is a big deal.Assail - kinda interesting.
(hide spoiler)]lessers - booooringBlay and QhuinnI'm satisfied, if not completely happy, with what we got.
Maybe.THE Point: Qhuay's story got told, and in a mainstream novel.On the whole, I'm in a happy place about it.
I am so fucking happy for these two guys, I am so fucking happy that my two babies, my two favorite vamps people, my two best friends - so happy for Blay, my brother from another mother, and so goddamn happy for Qhuinn, my soulmate!
Because it’s fucking Qhuay, that’s why!My first complaint with this book is all the side stories.
Yes, ok, if you’ve read these books before you know that that is pretty common, but still, we had 4 fucking love stories going at the same time, and that shit just doesn’t fly!
I'm sure I'm in the minority but I was disappointed by this book.
There were too many sub-plots and characters and not enough of Quinn and Blay.
I wasn't sure if she would ever go there in fear of losing her core audience.
I've read my fair share of m/m sex scenes, and it was obvious that this was her first attempt at writing them.
They seemed akward and were lacking the passion that can be found in her m/f scenes.
On a positive note, I'm happy Quinn and Blay found the happy ending they deserve.
That alone made it worth the read.
