‘Which means more to you---your own personal safety or the existence of the system?’‘My safety,’ Anderton answered, without hesitation.‘You’re positive?’‘If the system can survive only by imprisoning innocent people, then it deserves to be destroyed.
If you think about someone who looks the exact opposite of Tom Cruise, you will know what John Allison Anderton looked like in Philip K.
And, in a sense, they are innocent.’‘In our society we have no major crimes, Anderton went on, ‘but we do have a detention camp full of would-be criminals.’” When Anderton pulls the latest cards from the Precogs and finds his name among them, stipulating that he is going to kill someone next week he doesn’t even know, he knows that he is being framed.
It's hard not to associate this solid, yet too short short story with that blockbuster flick starring Tom Cruise......and I'm not even going to try.
Because I loved the movie, even though I hate Tom Cruise.
Let's just say I've never liked him and have only tolerated watching his movies, all the while wishing it was someone else in his role.
Even with my anti-Cruise bias, I really enjoyed the heck out of the movie and expected the same with the story.
In comparison, the original story is like a quarter's worth of floppy anti-climax on one of those sticky, paint-chipped, slow-moving mechanical rides out front of your typical beat-down grocery store.
:D If your name shows up on a card as a future murderer, you're arrested and held in a detention camp indefinitely.When Anderson picks up a card and sees his name on it as the future murderer of Leopold Kaplan - a man he doesn't even know - in one week, he suspects his wife and/or Witwer of setting him up.
He's abducted promptly upon leaving his house and taken to the home of a retired Army general: Leonard Kaplan himself, who has some things to discuss with Anderton.The story and the movie start in very similar places but then turn down different tracks, and by the end they've veered wildly apart.
I honestly don't get how to like this novel, aside from the premise.The blurb/synopsis is very ambiguous, yet that's not my problem with this one.
I honestly only liked the first story, and the others were boring and flat.
I needed to force myself to read and read hoping to be able to enjoy myself, but after every short story the level of my boredom drastically increased.
I'm clearly not recommending this, but if you're fond of PKD then maybe you'd be able to enjoy this.
1.5/5 stars, clearly not for me.
What I should like to know is why Anderton would have committed murder in the timeline which the first minority report forecasted.
Anderton, like most such people, just can't see himself as a murderer.
The truth is murderers aren't much different from the rest of the world, and anybody can be a murderer, given adequate circumstances.
Think of soldiers or executioners or police - they aren't much different, they are just given the right circumstances.
They don't understand any of it, but we do."So lemme give you the quick and dirty total spoiler version of the rest of the plot: Anderton's name pops out the machine claiming that he's going to commit a murder, which is grounds for him to be arrested and detained (for a week?
4 - He then sees THAT report and realizes that if word gets out that the precogs are false-predicting, it would shut down the Precrime division - because that would mean that they are totally imprisoning innocent people (not to be confused with 'people who just haven't committed a crime...
I'm not going to cut PKD any slack for that.I feel like there should have been MORE to this story.
It was so terribly dull that by the time I got to page 18, the number of fucks I gave had actually dipped into the negative range and I just could not continue.I'd like to keep this short, so I'll list the things that sucked about this story:- 20 pages seems simultaneously too long and too short.
They're so homogenised, in fact, that when two characters talk to each other, it reads like somebody talking to their clone.- The concept of the minority report.
China’s security boss planning to use AI to stop crime before it even happens. Meng Jianzhu says data analysis can predict patterns which could stop terror attacks of social unrest before they happen. (The Independent Sept 2017)
How would you fight a system you thought was infallible?While I like the writing and find the idea of a dystopic future where precognition is so reliable that it's used as crime prevention vastly interesting, I don't find this story believable mostly because I can't buy into the idea of precognition as reliable; even cognition (as we know it) suffers from reliability problems.
Dick built though, but there's just one too many holes in the narrative to keep me from being fully immersed in the story.I saw the movie right after finishing the book and found it disappointing because Tom Cruise always disappoints.
Read on the WondrousBooks blog. I'd heard so much about Philip K. Dick but this is the first book of his that I actually got to read. In one of my classes he was the main topic too often for me not to find something of his. I kind of expected that the hype would be bigger than the actual greatness of Dick's works. But I'll be the first one to admit my mistake.I actually liked The Minority Report so much, that I chose the movie as my exam topic. The movie and the book are extremely different. As

The movie and the book are extremely different.
Therefore, I think I need to read at least one more of his works, preferably an actual book, to decide what I think of him as a writer.Do I recommend this?
Yes.Do I recommend the movie?
I'm happy to have a look at the film now, but I can tell it's going to be a very different animal.
Science fiction-ee stuff that is still very science fiction-ee abounds right alongside typewriters and analogue computer read-out cards.
It colours the philosophical elements with a kind of perfect sepia wash.
Sure he can jarringly rush through narrative space like he was working to a minute-close deadline, but sometimes that breathlessness has a charm to it, a kind of charismatic crazyman tugging on your arm in a zoo.
I look forward to reading the rest of the shorts.
Computers manipulate “gibberish” from three “precogs,” each one seeing into a possible future, and Anderton determines whether a crime will be committed.
When two or more “precogs” agree on an outcome, the resulting agreement is a majority report and the police can act on it.
The system has been working fine until one day a majority report indicates Anderton will murder a retired general.
But the second report, the minority report, considers his seeing the first report and therefore changing the outcome and in this scenario he wouldn’t kill the general.
Then the third report, which consider his seeing the minority report, indicates he would kill the general.
This precognition system is achieved using 3 human robots with the precognition powers to send out reports on a card that the person will eventually murder someone.
VERY MINOR SPOILERS I'M JUST EXPLAINING THE LOGIC BEHIND THE ROBOT SYSTEM:Precog (what they call the human robots in the story)The concept of the majority and minority report is explained in the story later.
The 1st precog gives the preconceived report that a person is going to murder someone.
So there is a 3rd precog who's report determines the majority report.
So having 2 majority reports will make sure that the person will actually commit murder.
Basta dizer que vi o filme de Spielberg antes, que usa o essencial do conto de PKD, expandindo de forma magnífica este mundo em que três mutantes da agência Precrime conseguem prever crimes, o que permite detenções antecipadas, sendo que o mais recente visado é John Anderton, o responsável pelo programa.
Anderton doesn't want to lose his position or Precrime.
Kaplan wants the Army back in control instead of the government.
We're set up to think Anderton is the protagonist because he's the one being sought after for a possible murder.
When someone suggests to him that Precrime should instead let the accused future muderer know about his/her possible crime to see if he or she changes his or her mind, he's very blaise about it.
I think Anderton's wife is the only one that brings up the subject of free will although she doesn't actually say free will.Very good read.

On many levels, I really enjoyed it, despite its flaws.1) It got right what the movie got incredibly wrong.Namely, that in any story with a character knowing the future (specifically his own) there needs to be the feeling of inevitability.
And the easiest way to prevent a murder from happening is to not go to the building where the guy lives at the date and time you're supposed to kill him.This is the problem with Spielberg's version.There never is any reason for Anderton to kill his intended target.
Nor is there ever any reason for him to meet this man at the date and time, other than the protagonist's own morbid curiosity.
Fantastic short story from Philip K. Dick. I was actually surprised at how much I liked this, as I'm not normally a huge reader of short stories and I know Tom Cruise was in the movie adaptation. But it was very engaging and quick paced. I'll need to read more of his shorts, if this is any indication of the quality. Who would have expected the short (view spoiler)[story from Philip K. (hide spoiler)]Dick to be so good? While I did see that climax coming, it was still very satisfying.
Movies make me go to sleep more frequently than books do, and are also less consistent in non-soporific effects to boot.But I passed through at least two different household settings of enrapt friends watching the movie, enough times and enough peeps to know that there was something there.
It was the final attempt that was the time I finished the bulk of it, so that attempting to not complete the reading at that point would have been more painful.
Definitivamente me encanta. Es la posibilidad de un futuro tan real, amaría que existiese PreCrime en la vida real.💕 RTC cuando consiga el libro...
2,5*
So I turned to my dog-eared copy of a collection of Dick's short-stories and read it in bed.
There are fully developed characters which is very, very difficult to pull off in a short story.
That said, this story is about concepts, moral questions, the way a future society might deal with crime – and those elements are compelling.
I don't think you have to resolve complex issues in a short story – you can raise them, highlight them, get people talking about them.
That's what short stories do.
That's what short stories do.
Um marco na história da ficção científica, K. Dick fica lembrado pelas suas ideias mais do que pela sua prosa. Este conto alargado já foi adaptado para filme, assim como muitas das suas obras. A razão do seu sucesso pode residir neste facto.
It's a simple, though original tale, but not complex enough to get a 4 star rating.
Amazing story, very well written. I've never seen the film, but I understand it's different, more action-centered. Well, I like this version here. It's a novelette that reads a lot like a short story, with a great concept and a great deal of control where the author's concerned, since you just know the story feels and goes exactly like/where he wants it to.
rushed, stilted, too much telling rather than showing.
every 1950s pulp writer could add in a character who 'could see the future.' but if such a talent could be developed and/or standardized, what exactly would happen to crime / policing?PKD's mistake, I think, was not incorporating a second story line into this work, and thus ending up with a 350 page fully immersive novel.
the novella suffers as an art form-- because just when you've become invested in the world / characters, the work ends.
a story line involving stock market speculation and/or economic forecasting would have counter-pointed the police/crime storyline of this work.
I think the main problem with this book, is the same problem a lot of short stories seem to suffer from.
We've hardly met the main character before he's on the run, and I just didn't care.
Thanks to the Hollywood film, everyone knows what the main plot of this book is, and as with so much of Dick's work, his paranoia fed into great ideas.
But unlike the movie, there just wasn't enough time to delve into the reality of this world, although Dick does make some effort to have his characters question the morality of a world where mentally ill children are enslaved in order to imprison people who have not actually committed any crime.
Very short book, a novella really. The book is nothing like the movie and I was surprised at how much more interesting were the ideas in Spielberg’s work compared to the original concept and simple story. Of all the books by Philip K. Dick I have tried,The Man in the High Castle, A Scanner Darkly, Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?, this is the one I liked best, however I still think the movie is better than the book.
Μια από τις καλύτερες συλλογές διηγημάτων του Dick στην ελληνική γλώσσα. Πέρα των διηγημάτων τα οποία έγιναν ταινίες (με μεγάλη ή μικρότερη επιτυχία, δεν έχει σημασία) εμφανίζονται όλα εκείνα που με έκαναν να αγαπήσω τον συγγραφέα. Ερωτήματα όπως το που τελειώνει το πραγματικό ή αν υπάρχει τελικά κάτι πραγματικό, όπως και τα όρια του ανθρώπου είναι ερωτήματα τα οποία δεν απαντάει, αλλά εγείρει ο Philip Dick στα περισσότερα από τα διηγήματα αυτού του τόμου.
