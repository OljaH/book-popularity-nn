First off: this is NOT good detective fiction.
Cleek is poacher-turned-gamekeeper, a master criminal who decides to turn straight and work for Scotland Yard after being stricken by the sight of a lovely, innocent young woman whose jewels he was about to pinch.
Most of them read like scripts, they are so dialogue heavy (a handy device to avoid being slowed down by difficult-to-write-descriptive passages etc).
Having said that, there are some nice turns of phrase and some good jokes involving Cleek's Cockney teenage sidekick, the gluttonous 'Dollops'.
fun and interesting - I like Cleek
Synopsis: short stories about Cleek, first a master criminal but now a detective with Scotland Yard. He wants to pay back his earlier victims.
Several short mysteries where Cleek figures out that the answer is. It starts out with a story of how he gave up his criminal life and became a detective. Interesting classic mysteries.
