Because I don't know how you go from writing a great paranormal romance, beloved by millions, to this piece of crap novel.
There is a social contract between the readers/buyers of romance novels and the novelists who write them.
....So why at the end of this pulp romance series did I feel like I was reading The White Hotel?
Like - we should report it to the school's psychologist - bad...)I mean, I see how Ms. Harris painted herself into a corner with Sookie and Eric, but that's the beauty of fiction, especially pulp fiction -- you can paint yourself right out.
Sookie would shut the fuck up about Bill.
Going through thirteen books of her wearing a banana clip and Mary Janes, I'm going to fucking shoot myself.
5.) Sookie basically fucked herself with the entire: "hey, my husband is marrying some other chick and the only thing I can do to stop it is to use this magic thing that I am planning on using to save my boss".
The. Fuck.
Eric, I hope you like your new wife.
I hope she's not as fucking stupid as the one you have now.
Spoiler Alert*****Spoiler Alert*****Spoiler Alert****I've read thirteen books to find out which man would be Sookie's HEA!!!This is what I wanted:I would have settled for this:But, This is what I got:Sookie was just as surprised as I was:Jason is just as lost as I am:I just feel I wasted my time reading this:And I'm a tad bit upset:My review had originally ended here, but my friend, Sunny, wanted details.
Freyda, Queen of Oklahoma, and Pam. Eric states that he wants to end his marriage to Sookie, she is sad and shocked, but goes thru with the ceremony.
She doesn't cry, but is very hurt by Eric's actions.Arleen gets out of jail, only to end up in cahoots with Amelia's dad and gets talked into breaking into Sookie's house and stealing one of her scarfs.
Someone who accepts her for who and what she is: A Sup. If she ended up with Eric, she would have to give up a part of herself to be with him.
In book 12 Harris wrapped up all the past characters and love interests with a pretty red bow, telling us how they were, what they were doing -- basically showing us why they wouldn't be with Sookie.
Her natural instinct to save Sam showed her true love for him -- not the stupid lustful crap she had with Eric and Bill.
Alisha: The fan who is neither crazy, nor entitled rantsUpdate: So I've been on Amazon, watching the reactions. Lots of sock puppets and rabid Charlaine fans giving this turd 5 stars. Even Anne Rice is weighing in! I'm uber suspicious of all reviews that say, "She tied this up nicely, way to go Ms. Harris! and I look forward to reading the Coda in October!" Gotta hand it to Penguin, they are on top of this."Hey everyone! Look over here! Disregard the bad reviews. Those people are CRAZY!" There'
I've thought a lot about why Harris would write an arc that heavily favored Eric, then dismantle the entire work in three books.
Likewise, with Sookie, Harris' ability to do what she wanted in light of True Blood, crazed fans, and simple boredom all took their toll on the work.I've read books 1-9 at least five times each.
Harris thinks that (view spoiler)[ rape is a appropriate plot device, selling Eric into sex slavery for the next 200 years.
Harris wrote Sookie as brave in the beginning and accepting of other supes because people had always treated her like crap.
Just don't.I was reading the wrong story all along.I didn't really care who Sookie ended up with.
At least I would have gotten the chance to see Sookie falling in love with "the right man for her".
What an amazing story!Harris said she knew how she would end the series by the second book.
But after 10 more books of hearing crickets where Sam was concerned it was pulled right out of her ass.[end of SPOILER]How unfair to Sookie.
How lame for Bill.Sookie was way off in this book.
Because I thought that since the author fucked up Eric's story, she at least would be fair to Sookie.
In my mind, the Sookie Stackhouse series ended at book #9, it's ridiculous but that's how I feel.
I easily could have went on Goodreads and found out who Sookie ended up with yet I continued to read in hopes that this book would somehow redeem itself after the poor quality of the past few books.
A better ending to this series would have been if Sookie married that table because she is so obsessed with it.
The ending made me so angry and I felt like I had wasted my time reading this entire series.
(C+) 65% | Almost SatisfactoryNotes: Former supporting players form a mystery-solving super-team, reminisce, run about, while the mystery solves itself.
I am never buying anything from Charlaine Harris againYes she spoiled my investment in her series...I really wanted Eric and Sookie to end up together.
Forgive me for being a die hard romance reader but that was the only interest I ever held for her books.
Besides the romance element of the book, there were so many inconsistencies between character's personalities and their actions.
Oh that's right>> money.By the way I was hoping Sookie would make the right decision however we all know she is a fictional character whom is ultimately controlled by her puppet master...but she still must be destroyedOn that note Charlaine...
You wonder why we all wanted Eric and Sookie to have a HEA?
You wrote the books, you created the characters, you created the arc, the narrative, and we followed you for 13 years.
I am so upset by the ending of this series that I refuse to read the last two books.
Eric Northman will forever be a beloved character.
You could have had Sookie end up alone, but instead you put her with a character she has shown ZERO interest in since Book 1.
No wonder you decided not to tour with this book.
”I truly think you take the prize for having more people wanting to kill you than anyone I’ve ever known. I’m only trying to get to them first. But it’s fun, in a way.”I can’t believe I actually read the last of the Sookie Stackhouse books! XDWhen I first started this series I was 19!!! So yeah it took me about  11 years  to finish it. Which is pretty okay, considering that this series consists of a total of 13 books. *lol*After so many adventures there were a lot of old and a few new faces in “
;-) Since I don’t want to spoil anything, (which is pretty hard after 13 books *lol*) suffice it to say that as usually she’s facing those troubles head-on.
Okay?!Here I go!(view spoiler)[“I don’t want you grateful,” he said.
*lol* A human life and a family would have been impossible with him though so I guess Sam was a more realistic option in the end.
I think it was just too much packed into one book and I didn’t like the change of POVs. That’s just my personal opinion though, so don’t let me keep you from finishing this series too.
If you don't like a book, don't read it.
If there are technical issues or things you don't agree with from a reader's standpoint, feel free to point them out but understand that the power is always going to lie with the writer.
This has been what I've said to countless angry readers for well over 20 years.Now, I say screw that.
Harris' handiwork, not only in this novel, but in the series as a whole, has been as sloppy and shoddy as a used car salesman attaching a bumper with crazy glue.
I wouldn't want to offend the fourteen-year-old fanfiction writers.
Don't just stay away from this book and this series ...
I will always be an EL. I am so sad that Ch has destroyed a much loved character. There will be ALOT of disappointed fans. and to be honest it won't be just Eric fans who are upset. This book finished with a thud.After so many yrs invested as a reader I feel cheated. Sadly she is going to lose and upset alot of readers. For me,writers are only as good as their last book.Sad way to end a series, that could easily have been one of my favorites
As soon as the HBO tv series came out, Ms Harris began to write with the tv series in mind - and the WRITING WENT TO CRAP.Charlaine Harris is the next runner up to the Laurell K Hamilton writer of SHAME award..... never again Ms Harris, never again.
Pre-Read Review: My only hope is that she ends up with Sam, whom I've been rooting for since book 1.Post-Read Review: (view spoiler)[“I’m Sookie Stackhouse.
I love that in the end, Sookie knows that she is strong, that she can stand on her own two feet and survive whatever life throws at her.
Yes, I’m overjoyed that she ended up with Sam. But I’m not surprised.
So, for me, there was no way she was going to end up either Bill or Eric.
That’s what makes a book good to me.
From the first line..."I'd been waiting for the vampire for years when he walked into the bar."to the last..."I’m Sookie Stackhouse. I belong here."it's been quite a journey with Sookie and her friends. Thirteen books...mostly good but nonetheless I've enjoyed reading them and they will be missed.  Thirteen Hints ♦ There's a wedding. {Yay!}♦ There's a divorce. {ugh}♦ There's a new life. {Yay!}♦ There's a death. {or four...who's counting?}♦ Someone leaves. {ugh}♦ Someone returns. {total surprise!
Thirteen books...mostly good but nonetheless I've enjoyed reading them and they will be missed.
I have to say that I quite enjoyed the book...I love being in Sookieworld and I will miss it.
But...it was time for Sookie's story to end.
We all know who the true romance is of this series but it just wasn't happening and I knew that as soon as CH decided that Sookie wanted a baby.
I know a lot of people were upset about that but I'm glad that CH decided to end the story the way originally saw it...with Sookie being happy and it just wouldn't have worked out the other way.
After 12 books of having it said repeatedly by Sookie that Sam is ONLY her friend/boss/older brother type, she all of a sudden finds herself in love with him?2.
It was also stated repeatedly throughout the series that Sookie believed she would never be able to be with a non-vampire due to her telepathy.
Sookie did not want children as she was afraid of passing along her telepathy.
In a previous book, Sookie asked the question if her telepathy could be removed and was told that it could not.
So here we are at the end of Sookie Stackhouse and I for one am sad.
For thirteen books she has been close to death numerous times.
Now I know ya’all are upset that Sookie did not end up with Eric ‘the hot’ (if that’s possible being dead and cold and all) vampire.
Come on, he nearly got her killed about ten times!!
Step away from the vampire Sookie.Then there were her baby pangs.
I don’t see the problem here; your best friend is the person you should end up with.

YOU CAN'T GO BACK!!!...(view spoiler)[Sam...
what a shocker (hide spoiler)]
It's pretty high handed on her part to think that just because we bought all the other books that we would be beholden to buy this farewell F-you to her readers.I don't feel like I've been gypped out of a Sookie/Eric HEA; she doesn't deserve him.
He always went out of his way to make sure Sookie was protected, and he never failed to show his affection for her, however subtle it may have been at times.Eric ends the series, however, as pouting, spiteful, and spineless, whining over the fact that Sookie used the cluviel dor to save Sam’s life instead of using it to get him out of his arranged marriage to the queen of Oklahoma.
I read it again at 15 and I fell in love with a certain vampire with the initials E.N.And I devoured rest of the 8 books, loving every bit of it.
I loved the series till the 9th book.
She told me about the plot, the cluviel dor and Sam. I know it's a bit presumptuous criticizing a book I haven't read.
Not cool.If you were planning to pair Sam and Sookie up since the beginning then why have you put us through 12 books of amazing vampires and werewolves and what not?
Sookie's into Sam more than our beloved Eric.Why put us through that Charlaine?
Go Harris!*sighs* I really hope this book doesn't turn out to be like I think it's going to be..(Painful) Predictions:-Eric with that Freyda--> angst, pain, bitterness, jealousy on sookie's behalf.-Bill and Sam start to look more appealing.-But Bill wins in the end.-Some close people die.-Either Bill ends with her or..(or Sookie dies, but I don't think so)..or.......
really, thinking about it now, if "Seric" and "Eookie" are any indication, then they definitely wasn't meant to be!Long live Samookie..
I REFUSE to buy or read this!!
Charlaine Harris KNEW the majority of her fans read this book series because WE ALL LOVED ERIC AND SOOKIE!!!
We are supposed to TRUST our favorite authors to take us on a journey, make us sad, cry, rejoice, smile, want to pull out our hair, fall in love with our favorite characters and in the end know it was a hellva good ride.
She took us on an epic journey with Sookie and Eric.
(*note- I did try to read a borrowed copy~ kinda knew I wouldnt want to buy it.
I'm very disappointed, and it's more than the ending.
2-2.5 Stars :(If I had only one word to describe how I was feeling after reading this book it would be... And I hate to give it a poor rating. I hate giving any book a poor rating. I know authors work extremely hard on their books, but I have to be honest here... after years and years of reading this series, the final book was a let down for me. So we have Sookie...  Anyone who has read this series knows that Sookie is a telepath. She has fae blood in her. Hearing everyones thoughts is intrusive
after years and years of reading this series, the final book was a let down for me.
Anyone who has read this series knows that Sookie is a telepath.
She can’t directly ‘hear’ the supes thoughts, so those are the guys she goes for.And her MANY men (that all make appearances in this book)...Her kind of sort of Vampire Husband?
At the end of the last book, Sookie had one chance to make a ‘wish’ with her fairy object.
Then FINALLY the ending...Even though Sookie ended up with my second favorite guy and the guy I thought would be best for her, I couldn’t even be happy with that.

Skimmed most of the book, but could not finish. Im not mad that CH did what she did (its her brain baby after all), Im angry that she built a relationship for 12+ books only to botch it and say FU to us all, "Lets have some Seal loving instead" *shudders*I read books with HEA because I can trust the author not to tear my heart into pieces, this shows that I can never ever trust CH again.

My real problem is (view spoiler)[ that since the author has consistently stated she knew who Sookie would end up with since book 2, why did Harris take such a convoluted path to this ending?
But had Harris ended the prior book deadlocked with Sookie made a grand claim that seeing the light fade out of Sam's eyes made her see how much he meant to her, that he meant everything, so she used her cluvial dor on him---that would have worked better for me than this.Had Harris ended this series around books 6-8, people wouldn’t feel so jerked around.
The whole series has been one big, F U to Christian fundamentalists, and now your going to give them the nod that they were right all along?I could go on, its not hard to nit pick this book, nearly everything that happens is so half asked it doesn't make sense or even entertain, and I'm nearly always prepared to give a pass on enjoyable crazy, like the idea of Vampire Elvis.The Central plot is terrible and Sookie actually mocks it at the end.
Okay, it could've ended sooner. The last four books were much more annoying and boring than the previous ones. Or maybe I've grown too old for True Blood. But the ending wasn't so bad. It felt almost nostalgic, after 13 books and almost 5 years... Goodbye, Sookie._______The last one finally... I'm curious how will Harris resolve her Happily Ever After for Sookie... It seems a bit impossible at this point.
