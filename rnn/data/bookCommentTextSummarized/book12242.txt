William Peter Blatty looking like he is ready for his casting call for a spaghetti western.The Dodge City Public library, they never has anything I absolutely need immediately, had a copy of the fortieth anniversary edition.
So if you have thoughts of reading this book make sure you read the fortieth anniversary edition because as Blatty stated.
And of his faith.”The thought that kept going through my head as I read this book is if you find proof of the devil or a demon or even true evil doesn't that mean you’ve found proof of God?
This was the case that inspired William Peter Blatty to write this book.
Curiosity compels you to read this!  THE DEVIL IS IN THE DETAILS It was kinda hard to decide the rating on this novel. If I'd think only on the raw reading experience, I would say that it was a 3-star material.However, I had to ponder about the whole additional info and further development of characters compared with my experience with the film adaptation (which certainly is one of my favorite horror films). So, I think that the fairest rating is giving a solid 4-star rating.Certainly due all t
So, I am still glad of having read the original novel, since not matter the film adaptation covered the most important elements of the general storyline;......the novel indeed gives you enlighting info about the background of the characters, even "new" characters that didn't appear on the movie version, and deeper development of many of the scenes.On the film, you never have doubt that there is a demon inside of Regan,......but in the novel, there are plausible scenarios causing suspicions on other characters, with the chance of a more rational explanation.
I thought about getting a copy of the movie to watch again since I have read the book but hell no.
The only reason I wanted to watch it again is because I wanted to see if they had some of the really disturbing things in the movie that were in the book.
There is a part in the prologue that I didn't even realize was in another part of the movie until I read the book.
Regan's mom Chris who is a movie star let her do it because she didn't think there was any harm in it.
The movie was scarier but the book had more detailed, disturbing stuff.
A masterpiece...unqualified, unadulterated and unequaled. How better to describe the definitive, 40th Anniversary edition of one of THE classic horror novels of the 20th century...rendered in audio format and narrated with passion, verve and pitch-perfect delivery by William P. Blatty himself.I’ve seen both the original and extended, remastered versions of The Exorcist several times and believe it ranks among the finest horror films ever made. Until this week, I had never read the source novel.

Thus, wifhout worrying about spoilage, I am going to mention briefly what struck me most about the book and then finish with a quick “compare and contrast” describing where I thought the film and the novel, respectively, were the superior product.
5. The Smell and Sound of Evil: Just as the book could not compete with the visual perfection of the film, the film could not (for obvious reasons) come close to imbuing its telling with the stench described in the novel.
Of course, I knew of Blatty's novel and I was aware of the cutie little green Pazuzu-face of young Regan, but since I don't believe in the main theme of the story, I knew I wouldn't be able to appreciate the film, right?
Perhaps I am a little harsher than I should, but her interactions with Regan's doctors and with Karras didn't exactly make her look like the sharpest knife in the drawer.So, a great book that would have been a success even if the film had never come to pass.
Scared the heck out of me !!
THE EXORCIST is on quite a few of my favorite lists.I have read this book once before, and I own- and have watched the movie numerous times.
This time I listened to the audio book.It is my favorite movie poster.It has one of my favorite "the making of" documentaries.
It's in my top ten favorite movie list, and top five favorite horror movie list...and now that I have listened to the audio book.
Favorite audio book...by far.William Blatty's voice is like butter...slathered on the perfect horror filled bagel with cream cheese.Georgetown, Washington:Chris MacNeil- an actress, and her young daughter- Regan- are living in Georgetown, while Chris is filming a movie.
Damien Karras is a central character in the book and his presence is felt throughout, both through his personal struggles with his faith and the dedication he had when thrust into the middle of the demonic possession of a young girl.
Chris MacNeil is also a key member of the story and her struggle to understand her daughter proves to be an ongoing theme the reader will discover.
One cannot review this book effectively without mentioning Regan and the demon that appears to be embedded within her, as it is this that proves to offer the ultimate spine tingling.
The book has more of an underlying theme of questioning whether Regan is possessed that the movie lacks in part because once you see that kid’s demonic features and her head spin all the way around on screen, you know it’s supernatural in origin.
So already this thing has turned from a simple gimmick review to what felt like a pain in the ass.Since I don’t have the time and/or patience to figure out all the differences I won’t dig into that, but I’m not calling it a Rubbermaid Treasure either since it’s technically a different book.

The film with Linda Blair and Max Von Sydow was so far ahead of its time.
I was just a young boy when the film was released and remember that there was heaps of controversy at the time.
I know that the film was back in theatres a while ago and my partner and I went to see it again with our nephew and niece.
I guess times and tastes have changed.
The book is great and the original film too, whatever the younger generation may think.
I think it stars Ben Daniels as the priest.🐯👍
El exorcista es, sin lugar a dudas, el libro más terrorífico que he leído.
Recordemos que el miedo es subjetivo, y mi debilidad siempre han sido las posesiones satánicas.
No me esperaba el análisis psiquiátrico ni las explicaciones psicológicas para enfrentarnos a las posibles explicaciones de las "posesiones", pensé, que habría mucha religión involucrada y actos de fe, pero me encontré con razonamientos lógicos que la verdad nos dejan a todos una sensación de: ¿ok entonces, todo está en la cabeza o de verdad existe el diablo?Es un libro completamente engatusador y repugnante que me dejó realmente perturbada pero ¿en el buen sentido?
I’m going to try to be as spoiler free as I can considering some people may not have read this *or* haven't seen the movie, in fact, it would help you to know that I only saw the movie when I was very young and I kept my eyes closed most of the time, so even though this book is old, there are those who have intentions of reading it and don’t want the story spoiled.That being said, if you want to go into this book totally blind, maybe skip the rest of this review and just know this: I recommend this book for fans of horror.
I’m sure most of you have seen the movie.If you found the movie scary, the book is more horrifying in some ways.
Jiminy Christmas!Low point of the book for me: Lieutenant Kinderman (just couldn't get into the character) and too much information on Father Karras’s background.
I'm not sure why I didn't want his background.
I'm sure I'm in the minority on this one because the backstory was crucial to his faith.The movie at the end scared the bejesus out of me, but not as much with the book.
So because of this, I’m giving the book 4.5 stars instead of the full 5.
There is the demonic possession of Regan McNeil and the horrors that are described as a part of that invasion, the night and day distinction between a young girl and the maniacal, infernal force that changed her.
But what drives this work; the central focus is not the blasphemy going on in Regan’s bedroom, but the spiritual conflict taking place within Father Karras.
Karras wants the possession, wants to know that a demon has taken up residence in the child, because this will be his definitive sign from God that his faith is real.
Finally, in the peaceful words of Father Merrin, the exorcist, Karras finds absolution from his doubts.
Doctors are unable to diagnose what could have caused this shift in personality, so Regan's mother turns to Father Damien Karras, who is suffering from his own lack of faith.I'm finally writing a proper book review for one of my favourite books of all time after reading it for the third time.
It quickly became one of my favourite movies and I decided I needed to read the book.
After reading this, Legion and The Ninth Configuration, he would rank as one of my favourite authors, and so I take a lot of pleasure in people "discovering" Blatty as a writer.Another surprising aspect for a number of people was how emotional the book is.
However, as I said before, it is not the physical manifestation of the demon that is important - it's how people deal with the posession.Chris asks Father Karras to perform an exorcism - an ages old ritual used by the Church to purge the demons out of the posessed.
Nevertheless, Father Merrin and Father Karras set out to perform the exorcism.The lenghty ritual tires the priests, both physically and mentally.
He dies free of burden and guilt; his life had purpose, just like Regan's - The demon chose the girl to lure Father Merrin to face him, just as Father Karras was chosen to face the demon and defeat him.
“I think belief in God is not a matter of reason at all; I think it finally is a matter of love: of accepting the possibility that God could ever love us.”  An unexpected and unplanned BR with The newly minted Kaz and Inej lover, The closeted lady reviewer and The guy with STILL no profile picture. Thank you guys, for leaving me in the dust such a nice time!Phew! What a crazy and scary read!What can I say about the book that’s not been said a million times over? I mean it’s been out there for d
Imagine seeing a loved one being contorted out of shape, physically and mentally, to an extent where you don’t recognize them anymore.
Imagine a loved one acting in ways you can’t even comprehend.
Imagine being scared by someone you love.
Imagine being denied and being forced to accept something you couldn’t think possible.
I loved how that chapter coalesced and that was the part where the book started picking up pace and things started becoming abysmal!Honestly, I did not see the point of Father Merrin’s character, especially considering the sort of ending that was executed.The ending, for me atleast, was a negative point in a way.

It is not just a horror story – it has elements of mystery and psychological thriller as well.We all, or rather many of us know that the story revolves around the possession of a little girl by an evil entity.
The story opens with a scene in an archaeological site in Iran, and we get to know that some ancient demon is going to do something evil.The author had done some pretty good research – the references to various concepts of neurology and psychology reminded me of The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat by Oliver Sacks – a truly remarkable book.
This is a really chilling and frightening story.There is nothing more powerful and engrossing than a story about a persons battle with their state of mind and Demons. In this frightening story you have a mother and her 12 year old daughters bond shaken, faced with a state of mayhem immersed in a struggle for survival and triumph over adversity, you just feel for them immensely and love for their solitude to prevail. The Jesuit priest also had a love for his deceased mother and guilt of not put
In this frightening story you have a mother and her 12 year old daughters bond shaken, faced with a state of mayhem immersed in a struggle for survival and triumph over adversity, you just feel for them immensely and love for their solitude to prevail.
He's in a struggle to overcome his downfalls and darkness of past days on a path of resolution.The writing paints some much more better images in your mind, than those distant but quite fresh images i have of the movie, of those notorious scenes of a possessed young girl rotating her head and shout profanities and vomiting.
The Exorcist by William Peter Blatty was released in 1971, we've all seen the subsequent film released in 1973, you might have read the book but an altogether different experience is guaranteed to scare the pants off you with the audiobook.
From the different impersonations by the demon to the relationships of the characters entwined in the story, everything is perfect.
*Just watched it and rightly justified as one of the best horror films of all time but the book, well the book is even better, simple as that*.
If you found the movie scary, the book is grosser and more horrifying in some ways.Maybe it's because the readers imagination is more vast than anything that can be shown on screen....There are few scenes that had me completely grossed out but this book is a definite page turner.The ending is something that I knew about (because of the movie) but still reading it gave me the chills (view spoiler)[ The sacrifice of Damien's life so that the evil spirit leaves Regan's body but in the end the spirit is not destroyed or we can't be sure it has been and will not attach to anyone else.
It’s a free for all.Why is this relevant to this review?Satanic Panic was at its peak in the 80s, when I was young, and the one Horror Film we were absolutely forbidden to watch was The Exorcist.
And damn it’s a good one.The first thing that I should probably mention is that the message in The Exorcist is actually very pro religion, so I’m not entirely sure what all the drama was about; the blasphemies uttered by the demon is only to be expected given the context of the story.
Such a classic. The writing is like popcorn, dialogue is realistic, the characters are likable while having unlikable characteristics, and there's plenty of moments that will either get under your skin or turn your stomach altogether (yes... that scene). Highly recommended!
The book started out slow and for the first half of the book there was no real "scare" factor.
Most of the book was no one believing that the daughter Ragan was possessed, but instead that she just had some psychological problems which were causing her transformation of an innocent girl to a stark raving lunatic.
The book finally started picking up pace with more things happening regarding the possession of the daughter and then when the priests became involved with them trying to exorcise the demon, the book ramped up.
In my opinon, I think the movie was far more scarier than the book.
Finally, the last book I read in 2015.
You've read four books this year, so, like, you're, you know, still behind...FUCK!Anyballs, here we are, decades after this book was released and the movie adaptation gave baby boomers nightmares.
Of course, in this book, it works.
Yowch!Side question: Do you ladies feel it in your guts when you're curbstomped in the nu-nu?
There's a lot more inner thought, as you'd expect from a novel, but overall the movie is a quicker way to absorb the same content, as the author is the one who wrote and directed the movie.
on oct 26th 1987, an english professor bought this book in shanghai foreign book store at the price of rmb 6, as much as nearly rmb 200 this day i guesslast week i paid him rmb 100 for this book. the jacket is long gone, the bounding parched and cracked, but the paper is well preserved, better than i imagine, should be a nice bargainnow i'm the ultimate owner of it, no jacket, sorry, no pix but there's the first taiwanese edition, sept. 1974 :D
A very addictive read, with some strong creepy scenes and dialogs.
Highly recommended, it is classic terror.No tengo ni idea de como se me cruzo por la cabeza la idea de leer esto, pero aqui estoy.
LolEl libro El Exorcista, es justamente lo que la pelicula es; terror clasico sin mucha profundizacion pero con escenas muy interesantes.
Tiene escenas fuertes y bastante incomodas, con respecto a la religion, asi que si no te perjudica leer algo asi, pues te recomiendo el libro, sobretodo si te gusta la pelicula.
I felt it wasn’t as scary as I had expected, but definitely the horror element was managed quite well throughout the book.There was a time around the middle when I was feeling all GYANI because of the extra neurology, psychology and psychiatry detail but it was over before I might have started feeling the urge of putting the book down and getting degrees in those :PThere were only a limited set of characters but the relationship dynamics between each duo was quite different.
How a horror book can end with that iconic line from Casablanca, yet it feels perfect.
