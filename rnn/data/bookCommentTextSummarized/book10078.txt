The last book, Castle Roogna, with Dor as the main character bothered me.
He was way too innocent for someone pretty curious about what Anthony refers to as the adult conspiracy.
Anthony can write great characters....Bink, Dor's Dad and the main character in the first two books, was a believable character.
But I don't get the feeling that Anthony can do young adult characters all that well.
If I wasn't so bugged by Dor's character flaws, I'd have been inclined to give it 5 stars.
I just don't care for spiders even if this was one of the good guys.
Real good guys.
I wrote an individual review for the 1st two stories, so I'll just focus on the overall book and 3rd
Xanth was a world I felt an immediate affinity for. The creative application of puns into a fantasy setting was one of the greatest finds a young girl could stumble upon.Out of the three stories in the collection Castle Roogna was the first Xanth novel I ever read, and the one that sent me spinning into his world. The concept of the Adult Conspiracy was both mysterious and fascinating. As I got older and more mature I appreciated different aspects of the novels. I liked that Xanth was a world with layers that appealed to different age groups.
The first three Xanth books are the best, and the first, A Spell for Chameleon is excellent. Unfortunately, IMO, the series went downhill from there (Vale of the Vole is the last one I read).
I truly loved how Anthony created an entire world. He created an elaborate world with magic and characters. The setting was dynamic and descriptive. He helped me to see some more creative means to writing. And appreciate those writers who can create an entire world separate from reality. The way he combines his unique world with exciting action packed writing showed me how to write stories which were more action inclined.
These are for young adult maybe younger and adults wanting a quick escape. They are fun, fast and full of puns As I recall, there is some adult themes, but PG. I stopped reading the series at I think Crewel Lye. Anthoney did over 20! Eek.IF you or anyone you know have learning disabilites (like the author) you will enjoy the beginnings of Castle Roogna. Hint: he has to write an essay and has a little trouble.....
I read all the Xanth series as a pre-teen, early teen (all hundred? ;-) ). I loved the puns, and the bantering between characters that would probably make me groan today. I rated it as 4 stars for kids :-), so many adventures--so many hours away from ones 'regular life'.
These books were a constant fixture of my late childhood. I read and reread them, usually finding a joke or pun that I hadn't understood previously now made clear. A must-read as far as I'm concerned.
I read this when I was probably 13 or 14 and it was a great young adult fantasy. It is a creative use of idiosyncrasies in the English language to create a whole world of comedic adventure. I recommend the series to anyone just discovering the world of fantasy.
Absolutely LOVED LOVED LOVED this book!! This book is what made me fall in love with Piers Anthony. Unfortunately, lost "custody" of my treasured hardback copy and have yet to find another :-(
so far very gookd
Young adult 10-15
This is the very first Piers Anthony book, 3 in 1 book that leads me to be looking all Xanth books in every bookstore here in our place. How I wish I could compile every book of the series..
Good, funny, intriguing fantasy!
Loved this book! Total escape! A wonderful book to introduce young teens to the world of fantasy!
This was another favorite of mine. I read this series back in the '80's. I love the puns Piers Anthony used in the story. It was not only an enjoyable fantasy to read, but it was funny and witty.
* - failed to finish it** -finished it, but it was a struggle*** -perfectly readable**** -enjoyable read***** -very enjoyable, would (or have) read multiple times
I finished the first book, now I need to read the other two. And now all books are read.
Although many would make a face at these books as being for children I probably would still enjoy them at the age of 36. (but I'm no weirdo who read the whole series)
Read the first 10 or so of these when I was in junior high; loved these books - wonder if they would hold up now, 25 years later? I bet I'd still enjoy reading them.
Good but Anthony seems to have a fixation on panties.
Piers Anthony's writing is misogyny at its finest. The story itself is ok, there are some clever pieces, but over all some very disturbing themes. Not a huge fan. I won't be reading any more of his stuff.
I disliked this series, and I remember when it "arrived" and a lot of people liked it.
I have liked a couple of Anthony's books but I can't say I'm anything like a fan.
If you like this, enjoy.
It's not "to my taste" as they say.I kept the book on my shelf for a very long time occasionally going back, but never getting involved.
I know a lot of people who snatched up everything "Xanth" as soon as it appeared, but it just never appealed to me.
Oh well, for the fans of these I'm happy for you, to each his/her own.
I love the Xanth series, it is funny and engaging and a fine journey to take! The puns are funny and smart and never regrettable and the characters range from endearing to irritating to entertaining and even frightening at moments, but I'd say, all in all, a wonderful read for young adults on up!
Using the compilation form as there are too many to list individually. remember reading and rereading these as child during the summer.
I grew up with Xanth, and at the time I loved it. But the books haven't aged well, and in revisiting them I found very little to hold my interest.
