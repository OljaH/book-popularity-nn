one of the first books I read
A favorite in our house!
This was a favorite book of mine as a kid. This may sound strange, but I cared the most about the wonderful illustrations of food in the book, especially the delicious big chocolate cake! I remember feeling bad that Mickey and his friends tried to exclude Donald Duck from their fun picnic. LOL. But it does teach a good social lesson.
This book was a staple at my grandparents' house. The sound of my grandmother's voice readily comes back to me when I think about passages from this book. It's also how I learned a new meaning for the word 'cross.' :)
A wonderful little story to share with your loved ones. For fans of disney.
A Little Golden Book from my youth, re-read as an adult. The moral of the story is a little cloudy, as you are really in trouble whether or not you invite Donald Duck along on your picnic.
it was fine
Mickey Mouse's Picnic by Jane Werner was a fun read. Mickey, Minnie and the gang are going on a picnic but don't invite Donald...
