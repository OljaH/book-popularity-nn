Well that was a splendid little treat. I enjoyed it's storytelling method once again - with Hastings having this mystery recounted to him by our beloved Belgian. As always, I felt like I was right there with them. Poirot, and Agatha Christie sure do know how to tell a tale :) <3
Nice one. :)
It just didn't grab me. Maybe because it plays to stereotypes. Maybe because it is not that complicated or interesting a case.
Hastings and Poirot are talking about speculative investments. Poirot states that he does not have any investments except for some shares he received after solving the case of a Chinese-nationals' murder.Poirot recounts how Mr. Pearson hired him to find the papers regarding a Burmese mine after Wu King's disappearance and subsequent discovery of his death. (view spoiler)[ Mr. Pearson went to great lengths to throw Poirot off of his scent. But it didn't work. (hide spoiler)]
Great short story.Hahaha christie never ceases to amaze and intrigue me. She has such a way with words that she keeps you guessing til the very end.
Good short story
Good and well formed story, I enjoyed it.
Very interesting short story, really refreshing after fiasco with "Big four".
