513.8 HILRef:The Process of Education by Bruner, Jerome SDavid Hilbert, a German mathematician recognized as one of the most influential and universal mathematicians of the 19th and early 20th centuriesQuotes:We must know. We will know.David Hilbert liked to quote "an old French mathematician" saying "A mathematical theory should not be considered complete until you have made it so clear that you can explain it to the first man you meet on the street".Review as not a academic approach to introduce math. Should be a good to self-reading book.
Yesterday, I learned what an oblate spheroid is. Also a prolate spheroid (which I hadn't heard of before.) If you rotate an ellipse on its major (longer) axis you get a prolate spheroid (which looks like an egg). If you rotate an ellipse on its minor (shorter) axis you get an oblate spheroid (which looks like an onion).
