Reader, I married him first.
Bertha Mason is the madwoman in the attic; she is the raving lunatic that is Rochester’s first wife in Jane Eyre,but have you ever stopped to wonder what her side of the story is?
Well the simple answer is a man named Rochester.
Rhys names the character Antoinette, a name Rochester refuses to use when he learns of her past.
Neither culture would accept Antoinette as one of their own, as she herself recognises: “It was a song about a white cockroach.
In short - incoherent overpraised rubbish.
I have read my share of classics over the years.
Some of them were boring, some outside the area of my interest, but never had I come across one that was so dreadfully bad and at the same time so critically acclaimed.I simply can't comprehend how this jumble of disjointed sentences can be seriously called a "masterpiece." The story was almost impossible to follow.
Had I not read "Jane Eyre," I'd be lost in this book completely.
The characters' motivations and even actions were hard to understand, their personalities were non-existent.
Awful beyond belief.Reading challenge: #27, 1 of 2.

Rhys wanted to give her the past that Bronte didn't, and she also wanted to show her decline into madness so the reader could appreciate who she was and where she came from and why she ended up the way she did.I just don't think it was handled very well and I didn't like the writing style at all.
This book appears on lists like "Novels for Feminists" and "100 Books Every Woman Should Read" - why?
One was snaky looking, another like an octopus with long thin brown tentacles bare of leaves hanging from a twisted root.” - Jean Rhys, Wide Sargasso Sea I was curious to read this book as it was considered a sort of prequel to Jane Eyre.
The themes explored in the book are very postcolonialism (discusses the relationships between former slaves and slaveowners after Emancipation), identity (Antoinette is Creole and is therefore not accepted by either the blacks or the whites) and madness.I’ve just finished reading a book about the Suffragette movement that looked into historical accounts of insanity in women.
I will definitely see him in a less than favourable light when I do re-read Jane Eyre.
Every once in a while, I stop to think about the neglected characters in various novels who exist only as plot devices.
I do not know if Charlotte Bronte ever thought about it, but Ms. Rhys obviously did, and this compellingly readable novel is the product.The language is beautifully evocative.
I could see, hear and smell the tropical countryside (very much like my homeland), at once breathtakingly beautiful, compellingly seductive and strangely frightening-like Antoinette.
Especially to the eyes of an Englishman whose green meadows and rolling fields hold no secrets.Yes, the countryside is beautiful...

Wide Sargasso Sea – Jean Rhys (1890 – 1979)Characters: Antoinette Cosway, Tia, Aunt Cora, Grace Poole, Richard Mason, Annette Cosway, Pierre Cosway, Mr Mason, Christophine, Godfrey, Edward RochesterAbstract: Born into an oppressive, colonialist society, Creole heiress Antoinette Cosway meets a young Englishman who is drawn to her innocent sensuality and beauty.

However, this is widely regarded as a classic, and as I've read Jane Eyre many times (review here: http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/...), I thought I should finally try this prequel novella.With such well-known books, I don't think it's a spoiler to say this imagines the story of the mad first wife in Rochester's attic: from her childhood in Jamaica, through to her marriage to Rochester, and a final epilogue that ties the two novels together, set in her attic at Thorfield.
An epic romance made meek, singular, aromatic, ethereal, surreal.
A fresh little nugget of splendor, of much-needed prose perfection.
This is gothic romance at its absolute height.
(It's perhaps the best piece of fan-fiction ever.) And I say this as "WSS" is in actuality a side story formulated for the emblematic crazed woman smack in the middle of "Jane Eyre".
merging elements of brutal nature and brutal nurture both, to birth a spectacle like one I've never experienced before.
Rhys gives us so much by giving us the absolute least.
Leaving the reader naturally to ask for more.
I remember that summer as one of the best of my life, and while Jane became my personal heroine and I developed a fervent crush on Mr. Rochester, I discovered an awkward but exhilarating female awareness completely foreign to me.
Impressionable Edward Fairfax Rochester, the typical Victorian gentleman, overwhelmed with the intensity of these somber, bizarre, damp landscapes with its menacing and reproachful people, can't avoid feeling equally appalled and attracted to his new wife.
And curiously, this new found truth does nothing but enhance my feelings for my childhood hero, this wounded rogue, shinning with all his flaws, who comes more alive today than ever.
Also, as a stand alone book without referrence to Jane Eyre, I don't think it is a particularly interesting book.The story for me was a bit flat.
This is a case of having to know a bit of the background of the world at the time the book was released to really get it.
😉)So, here's a basic bullet point rundown:- A so-so story- Doesn't really stand well on it's own (must be read after Jane Eyre)- With Jane Eyre in mind, you should really read a synopsis of it before, during, and/or after you read this (unless you are well versed in Jane Eyre)- I give it 3 stars as it is cool to get backstory from another book, but I couldn't go higher because I was not moved or blown away.
Anytime a writer takes on the idea of writing or rewriting another writers story or characters, they are treading on delicate, even sacred ground.
But somehow Jean Rhys pulls it off without too much damage to the original work, and let's face it, Bertha needed to have her story told.
Bertha's real name is Antoinette Cosway, and this is her story.
Unsuccessful most of her life, Wide Sargasso Sea came late in her career, "too late to make a difference" she would say.
"If I could live my life over again, and choose......I would rather be happy than write".
My neighbors think I am mad.
No one thought you had a soul too; a heart that once throbbed to the love of a man.
Or that you had a mother, consumed by a raging fire of the memory of your dead brother.
That you tried to keep sane in a mad-mad world filled with people who were no better.Why did no one think of you, Bertha?
Only a madwoman in the attic.
I will call you Antoinette, a name your mother may have given you, with love, when you were born.
I feel I owe a debt to the original publishers of Wide Sargasso Sea because if not for its publication her exceptional early work may have remained for ever out of print and I may never have been introduced to Jean.
Yes, he writes beautifully and yes he makes you feel his loss, but damn, he sucks the air out of the room so there’s nothing left for the rest of us breathe!
I don’t want Jean tied to Glen Hansard in my memory.
For those of you who haven’t read Jean Rhys, or those who don’t feel particularly attached to her early work, you may want to read some of the other reviews that have praised WSS.
This book encapsulates the melancholy of evolving times and evolving minds and it measures human decency.
Go, her black housekeeper of many years warns her, take your money and leave your husband and he'll be a poor man.
It's coincidental that I read this after reading Of Human Bondage, but after watching recent news with tears in my eyes as I had to once again doubt basic human decency, I thought how it must have been fate that linked me with these two works that illustrate life and the oddities of humans and their complexities.

All better than people.Better. Better, better than people. Imagine you are owned. Not from day one, not full physically either, but the brief taste of the former and the dire potential of the latter is enough to make you scream.

***SPOILERS HIDDEN******NO JANE EYRE SPOILERS***Published 119 years after Jane Eyre, the famous classic that inspired it, Wide Sargasso Sea is Jean Rhys’s attempt to give Bertha Mason (here going primarily by the name “Antoinette Cosway”) a detailed back story.
A fan of Jane Eyre since I first read it in ninth grade and a fan of the movie version of Wide Sargasso Sea, I greatly looked forward to reading this book.
Rhys didn't flesh out Rochester any more than she fleshed out Antoinette, so significant narrative devoted to him matters little, nor should it change how fans of Jane Eyre feel about Rochester.
Jean Rhys provides an atmospheric backdrop to Jane Eyre, asking some obvious questions and posing some difficult questions.
Of course the symbolism of the Sargasso Sea and all the myths surrounding it is significant; on the surface marriage offers Antoinette many opportunities, in reality the waters are treacherous.The juxtaposition of the Byronic hero Rochester in Jane Eyre and the same man as callous villain here is a sharp one.
The changing narrative voices can be a little confusing and though I think I prefer Rhys’s early stuff is better, but this is an important adjunct to Eurocentric nineteenth century novels.
Love’s Fierce Play"Wide Sargasso Sea" is both a  parallel novel  with respect to "Jane Eyre" and a novel that could stand alone, if read with no knowledge of the connection. It explores the Caribbean background of the marriage of [Bertha] Antoinette Mason to an unnamed Englishman (presumably Edward Rochester) and their return to England, where she is confined to a room in a "great house" (or is it made, as she believes, of cardboard?). Antoinette is a Creole, her origins being half-English and
Antoinette is a Creole, her origins being half-English and half-Martinique, but she is described as both white and beautiful.
For she belonged to the magic and loveliness." Soon, she is equally discontented with life in her homeland: "We were alone in the most beautiful place in the world." She hopes that things will improve in England, where she imagines "chandeliers and dancing, swans and roses and snow." Only there, Rochester continues to scorn her "blank hating moonstruck face." Like the Paris of "Quartet", her English caretaker, Grace Poole, recognises that 
But that is after, this story belongs, not to the governess, but to the wife.Antoinette Cosway is a girl who is pressed beyond her limits.
Subject to her environment and her mother’s precarious hold on her own wits, Antoinette is destined to be a mix of all that is fragile and all that is fierce.
You pray for help and hope for this poor girl, and yet you know it is not coming, for you know her end before you even begin her story.
Jean Rhys uses the 'mad woman' of Jane's story to look at events in a previous history of the despicable Mr Rochester.
In this novel Jean Rhys could be said to be writing about herself, or an aspect of herself spied in the 'mad woman' of Jane Eyre, as much as Charlotte Bronte wrote herself into the position of Jane.
She was also proclaimed dead while still alive and her work was 'rediscovered' at that time.So, it makes sense that she would see the 'mad woman' of Jane Eyre as a kind of misrepresentation.
In the process of writing this novel, Jean Rhys therefore throws light on the madness of madness as it were.
Also the black population, even though the island has mixed races, doesn’t seem to approve of individuals such as Antoinette and her mother Annette, who is from the French colony, Martinique, as is the servant Christophine, a Catholic who dresses very differently to the other servants, practices “obeah” and can supposedly do magical but evil things.There are just so many themes running through this book but to me the main ones are: colours, madness, genetics, the backdrop with slavery being abolished and the end of colonialism for the British.With colours, red is predominant throughout, starting with the fire at the Coulibri Estate where Annette, her family and her new husband Mr Mason live.
This is actually really good. It's like the source material of Jane Eyre, except more so. Claustrophobic, socially incisive, complex, maddening.
Rhys tells the story of this character from childhood, seeking the roots of her tragedy.This melancholic, shadowy, evocative, power-shifting book, elegantly and beautifully written, is a much needed reproof to a literary tradition which has presumed to speak for, and affected the marginalisation of non-European and especially colonized people.
While she brings Antoinette's lost voice into a literary dialogue, Rhys also speaks in her own; her style of conflicts and contrasts expresses her willed resistance to colonial forms and the European tradition.
Or a lie..."Yesterday I reread Wide Sargasso Sea, the last in my "Jean Rhys The Complete Novels" book.
It's a cheat to have them just SAY that they know something.I have a bad feeling about Wide Sargasso Sea that it's a patronizing revenge novel about an evil man who crushed the spirit of a helpless woman.
It's not taking the secret away like she says in Wide Sargasso Sea. It's giving a damn to consider that there is more behind everyone else's walls than just what they want you to think there is.
Jamaica’s motto is:"Out of Many One People"… and indeed, what a particular island we discover through this novel: an island inhabited by Blacks, Whites, slaves from Africa, Spanish first settlers, English who seized the island afterwards, French people, Chinese and Indian laborers, as many as different colors and cultures, this could be a paradise but Men being what they are, it’s most often a hell.In this fiction, Antoinette Cosway, a creole girl, tells her childhood at Coulibri Estate in Jamaica, where she was born in 1839, seven years after slave abolition.Between the indifference of her mother and the slave revolts, her fate turns upside down: she is sent to a convent (a school) that she will leave at the age of seventeen, to get married; but marriage is not always synonymous with happiness, far from it ...After a childhood without education, where she lived as abandoned, poor and wild as the estate in perdition she loved yet, in the convent, Antoinette discovers another world:"...
The book is brief so it's not that hard to reach the end, but I found it rather pointless and it left me completely, absolutely, utterly unimpressed. Maybe it's my fault, but that's what happened.(In case you're wondering, yes, I have read Jane Eyre.)
(We have to wonder how Jane fared as his wife.) And in the end, for Antoinette, at least, it’s desire that wins out.Wide Sargasso Sea is filled with lush imagery, exotic imagery to a man like Rochester who has come to expect the misty skies and the heath of Yorkshire, which are dull by comparison.
With Wide Sargasso Sea, Jean Rhys has changed the way readers look at Jane Eyre.
