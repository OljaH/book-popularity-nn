Yep. You guessed it. The murder involved a tape measure. (I knew they were dangerous, I mean look how often they lie)  But the questions are who did it and why?
I don't read Agatha Christie, but having watched Miss Marple on tv again (the unforgettable Joan Hickson version) I found a couple of Miss Marple shorts free on Amazon. Delightful. I could hear Joan Hickson speaking the words of Miss Marple as I read. My only real quibble is that the story felt rushed somehow which means it only gets three stars. (oh sod it, I'll be generous - the husband was written really well - four stars it is then!) I might, (only 'might') venture to read a full length Marple novel now. ;)
Dullest story I've read written by the Queen of Crime !!!Frankly I prefer Poirot over Marple, but such a dim story by Christie came to me as a surprise. I mean a murder happens, suspect can be easily identified, but pulling motive out of thin air seemed way too much to digest !!!
Weak Agatha Christie short detective story.
Cute - I love Miss Marple - always so quietly smarter than everyone else around her, like women had to be back then. A nice piece of brain work, short and sweet.
Entertaining but the end didn't convinced me so much. However, that was funny.
"Agatha Christie was the greatest exponent of the classical detective story. Her unique literary talents have crossed every boundary of age, race, class, geography and education. While she refined the template for a fictional form, the reading of her books became an international pastime." John CurranI started reading and collecting Agatha Christie books when I was 9 years old. I adored her books and still do. There is a great comfort, as an adult, in reading her books and acute observations of people that favours style over the penny horrors of sadism, torture, and graphic violence favoured by some authors.
Sometimes I feel as though I'm one of the dozen people who don't care for Agatha Christie's writing even though I love reading mysteries.
there's a feeling of incredible smugness at her own cleverness that I get whenever I've tried reading one of her novels.
This time I tried a short story, and that was a wise move.
I got to "see" Miss Marple in action without what I call the Christie Aftertaste.
Miss Marple noticed one tiny item that solved the murder, and I liked the way she explained it.
I think I'll be trying more short stories written by the Queen of Crime.
The only problem with short stories is that every little detail counts because it's supposed to be short so you know that everything that seems irrelevant has to be relevant because they aren't going to waste pages talking about some other crime that happened years back (jewel robbery, in this case). Which makes it a little bit too easy to guess what's important and what's not (like the pin, the robbery, and the characters).However, it's still an interesting story. As interesting as a short story can get, anyway.
Good Mrs. Marple short storyI enjoy almost all of Agatha Christie's short stories. This one was no exception. Good plot and easy read. I gave it a 4 out of 5. The plot was good and I think very original. I like the Mrs. Marple character. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys short stories or Agatha Christie.
Ummm , you can guess the killer by the third line.
Good one!
a short, short story

A typical Christie fare but a considerably sub-par mystery!
Enjoyable short "whodunit" story! Another classic from Agatha Christie!
Finishing up the last of the Agatha Christie short stories.
Miss Marple is certain that it is someone else and she sets out to find out who.I've been reading a lot of Hercule Poirot short stories, so I thought I'd switch it up with a Miss Marple short story.
I really like Miss Marple, even though I tend to read more Hercule Poirot mysteries.
This is, of course, because more Hercule Poirot stories were published.
So I loved visiting St Marys Mead with Miss Marple.I didn't guess the murderer in this case, although I was pretty certain it wasn't Mr Spenlow.
The title gave it all away...
What makes me smile is that even if I correctly guess early on WHO DUNNIT, I am compelled to read these short stories to the last word and full stop!See my review also at:http://www.amazon.co.uk/product-revie...http://www.amazon.com/Tape-Measure-Mu...http://www.amazon.ca/product-reviews/...http://www.amazon.com.au/product-revi...http://www.amazon.in/product-reviews/...

It's obvious that I'm at the beach with a Kindle loaded with Agatha Christie books that were on sale at the Kindle store. Perfect reads while sitting in a beach chair by the surf. In this book, a woman is found strangled in her home just before she is suppose to have a final fitting for a new dress made by the village dressmaker. It takes Miss Marple's keen eye to figure out what happened.
Miss Marple: the Complete Short StoriesRating System:* couldn't finish, ** wouldn't recommend, *** would recommend, **** would read again, ***** have read again
It was a quick and easy read, but I wish it had been longer, with more confusion and intrigue. There wasn't enough time to build up the tension before revealing everything. It was also easily solved, the title giving it away.
I downloaded this onto my kindle and read it in half an hour or less.I think the reader could solve the murder before Miss Marple explains all to the baffled police who are intent on arresting the wrong person.
It's been quite a few years since I read a Miss Marple Mystery and I'm glad I've revisited them. I enjoyed the quick read, but I'm always slightly frustrated when Miss Marple reveals the murderer's motive with information which that hasn't been made available to the reader.
Enjoyable short read.
I love a good Miss Marple and this is a classic. Short and sweet.
This is a great Miss Marple mystery that had interesting characters.
