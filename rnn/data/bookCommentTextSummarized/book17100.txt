This started off very good then turned into the usual thrillerish stuff, because it's a thriller.
Don't thriller fans get bored of these boring familiar twists and turns?
And the motive was that the guy in the wheelchair had filmed the dog molesting his ex-wife and was threatening to put the whole thing on facebook, and not the other way around!
That's why he had to get these people to do those things.
When Lorna gave a lift to the armadillo with the eyepatch, it was a giveaway - they obviously already knew each other.
You just wouldn't pick up any old hitchhiking armadillo.
Widow Claire moves to Tranquility, Maine, with her teenage son, Noah.
Claire and Noah are still adjusting to their new life months later.
Claire begins to question her decision in making this move to what seemed like a peaceful town by the lake.
What is the cause of this violent behavior in the town's teenagers, and does the answer lie within the waters of Locust Lake?This was a terrific medical suspense/thriller.
I liked that the story was told from many points of view and not just that of the main characters.
Tess Gerritsen is known for her way of spooking you with medical words and when I read the summary, the first thing that came into my mind is :  U R B A N L E G E N D I love urban legends but I was thinking that maybe T.G wouldn't do well with that genre so I was a little bit wary.
But really, I shouldn't have doubted Tess Gerritsen because holy smoking mackerel, she did an amazing job combining some urban legend and science.Bloodstream takes us into Tranquility, Maine where twice a century, teenagers went all Genghis Khan to everyone.
In the first half of the book, I started to feel disappointed.
There are so many characters introduced, and the scenes are so short for each bit of the action, that I found it hard to follow the thread of the story.
I also, I have to say, found Claire, the main protagonist, a bit whingey.
I prefer my female leads to have more bite.However, I should have been more patient!About half way through, I began to understand the characters better and the story started to come together.
Öncelikle bu kitap bana çok özendiğim halde neden küçük bir yerde yaşamak istemediğimi tekrar hatırlattı.
Başkahraman Dr. Claire ergen oğlunun kendisine yaşattığı sorunlardan bunalıp Tranquility'e taşınıyor romanda.
Biri istenmeyen adam ilan edilmeye görsün, daha onun o kasabada barınması çok zor.
Warren adlı bir karakter daha var mesela.
Gerçi bu dışlamada haklı bir korku da var ama yine de çok iticiydi.
Bir de çok tutucular.
İnsan hiç demez mi bunda bir anormallik var.
(hide spoiler)]Kitabın atmosferi çok iyiydi yalnız.
Kara kışın hüküm sürdüğü romanları çok seviyorum.
Claire'i de takdir ettim.
Kitabın sonunu çok beğenmedim ama Gerritsen'in yazım dilini seviyorum.
bakterijos žudikėsŠtai jau trečia Tess Gerritsen knyga, kurią skaitau ir vis dar neprisikasiau prie garsiosios Rizzoli/Isles serijos, bet man atrodo jau pastebiu jos tobulėjimą ir jeigu viskas tokiais greičiais tai na greitai netruks pasiekti tobulybę.
Apskritai tai šitas trileris dar ir toks labai keistas, toks grynai labai medicininis, ne medikai blogiečiai kaip ankščiau, bet bakterijos.
Kitas reikalas, kad viena labai aiški užuomina buvo jau pačioje pradžioje ir buvo aišku, kad tai kažkaip susiję, nors kaip tai paaiškėjo tik pabaigoje, galbūt sumanymas toks ir buvo, nežinia.
Pati pabaiga irgi turi silpnų vietų, viskas taip pokšt ir aišku, bet labai ir tai nekliuvo.Nu tai ką, pradedu jau rimtai užsikrėsti Gerritsen manija.
Tess Gerritsen skaityti pradėjau dėka savo buvusios kolegės, dar dirbdama knygyne.
Kolegė garantavo, jog autorės braižas man patiks ir ji buvo visiškai teisi.
Tada ta kolegė įvardino savo mėgstamiausią Tess knygą, ir tai buvo būtent „Šėlas“.
Klerė negalėdama taikstytis su tuo kas vyksta pardeda kapstytis giliau ir suvokia, jog prieš daug metų miestelis kentėjo nuo tokių pačių įvykių.
Gydytoja pradeda aiškintis visko priežastis ir tai jai prišaukia ne vieną nelaimę.Tai visiškai kitokia Tess knyga, ir visiškai aišku kas ją įkvėpė.
Kad „Šėlas“ Tess Gerritsen knyga, suabejoti neleido daug įdomių, itin detalių medicininių detalių ir aprašymų.
Knyga patiks visiems prisiekusiems Tess ar King‘o gerbėjams.
Although I favour her Rizzoli and Isles books, I am more than happy to read her earlier work as well.
Her earlier work falls more into the romantic suspense genre, but there are also a few medical thrillers to be found.
With Bloodstream, we have more of a medical thriller than anything else.Although I enjoyed Bloodstream, I found it was not quite to the level of some of Tess Gerritsen’s other work.
It’s certainly worth it if you’re a fan of Gerritsen, though – I simply wouldn’t recommend it as a starting point.
In Maine there resides a town called Tranquillity, a close-knit community of peaceful people.It's next to a lake and is a popular vacation spot.So when Claire Elliot and son Noah move there to escape their pasts, the new start seems full of promise.That is, until Tranquillity drags them under.As Claire fights to build her medical practice, she finds the locals hostile, wary of newcomers who've come into their home.But as she tries to win their respect, a rash of violence sweeps the town's children, and murder stalks the streets.With no idea what's causing it, Claire fights to uncover the shocking truth.And in the process, uncovers a horrific history that the town wants to keep buried...
Bloodstream has its slow moments, but they're few and far between, with the author mixing devastating events with revelations as the writing takes us on a smooth path to the finale.
I think it may be one of the creepiest prologues from a mystery book that I've ever read.
In fact, the beginning chapters of Bloodstream reminded me heavily of a UK movie called The Children (totally recommended, by the way.
So much that I kept clicking the Kindle thinking "It can't really be over..."However, my main issue with Bloodstream was that I thought every single character in it was an idiot.
In the end, I thought that Bloodstream was just okay and I definitely liked all of the books in the Rizzoli and Isles series more than I liked this one.
I was completely unaware of Gerritsen and her Rizzoli and Isles series - Ice cold is the eighth book in the series.
I borrowed the book too, liked it, and quickly read all of the earlier books in the series and a few of Gerritsen's very early thrillers.
I wasn't expecting much with this thriller, but I was quickly drawn in by the story.
Claire, a family doctor, who was recently widowed, moves to northern Maine to take her teenage son away from the crime spree he had started in Baltimore.
The plot moves at a good pace and the characters ring true.
It was good, decent author. I have to admit, I thought it'd be better. The thriller genre doesn't thrill me as much as it once did.
3 1/2 StarsFor the most part I liked this book a lot - in fact I read it at one sitting.
I was fascinated by the medical and scientific parts, which the author nailed.
She's a MD.😉) I personally felt there were too many twists and turns, however.
It's this one!" (You get the idea.) I would have gone with five stars had there been fewer explanations of the twists, and a better explanation of the true 'bad guy', which came at the rather abrupt end of the book.And what's with the cover of the book??
Doesn't pertain to the book at all...
Γενικα αγαπάω τις ιστορίες που έχουν ως τοποθεσια το Μέιν.
A rash of violent and deadly incidents, perpetrated by teenagers rock a Northern Maine township causing a deep seeded fear, pitting people against people and families against families.
The interlocking mysteries send the reader on a rollercoaster ride they are not likely to forget.
The real culprit of this story of horror lies dormant for decennia before striking again.Stephen King no longer has a monopoly on Maine based horror as he has to relinquish his exclusive right to Tess Gerritsen.
By this I mean that she has the uncanny ability to show the reader a tale from many sides and perspectives.
Bloodstream is my first book by Tess Gerritsen that I've read.
And I'm glad that I did.After her husband's death, Dr. Claire Elliot together with her teenage son Noah moved to Tranquility, a small town in Maine.
The story line was great with a tight, tense, well-paced plot, full of intense and engaging characters that contribute to its uniqueness.
But I was really hoping for more love scenes between Claire and Lincoln.
Overall, Bloodstream is definitely worth a read, Tess Gerritsen had me guessing and on the edge of my seat.
This is the first time I've read Tess Gerritsen and I'm definitely sure that it won't be the last.
Tess Gerritsen is definitely the Queen of the Medical Thriller, at least in my eyes.
Her background in medicine helps create very believable and readable medical situations, which are the basis for the thriller aspect of the stories.
In this case, teenagers in an otherwise sleepy Maine town are becoming unexplainably violent and turning on friends and family members.
Bloodstream is Tess Gerritsen's 11th stand-alone novel.
The action is set in the small town of Tranquility, Maine, where Dr Claire Elliott has relocated with her son, Noah, to remove him from less-than-desirable influences in Baltimore.
After the discovery of some human bones at nearby Locust Lake, followed by a shooting at the high school Noah attends, Claire begins to suspect something is affecting the behaviour of the local youth population.
Claire even begins to wonder about a parasitic infestation.
Tess Gerritsen is the master of medical detective drama, and once again shows her skill and knowledge in this novel.
Ik blijf het ongelofelijk vinden dat mensen zo'n geweldig plot kunnen verzinnen. Hihi, ergens moet Tess zelf ook een kronkeltje hebben. Maar wat een waanzinnig goed boek. Alweer kon ik tot op het laatste niet verzinnen wie nu de uiteindelijke dader was en ik ben dan ook diverse malen op het verkeerde been gezet. Absolute aanrader!!!
I have a hard time accepting that she wrote this book, its just not the same as the others. Its horrible, predictable and something I would think a teen would write.
They wanted her to be like their old doctor and just throw pills at the problem.
She also knows that the kid with the gun is one of her patients and she wants to treat him because he is not behaving correctly and she feels that he has some medical problem that needs to be treated.
His father doesn't want her near his son and gets his friend a smug town doctor to take over the care of the child and he treats Claire like she doesn't know what she is doing.
Visada galvojau, kad labai gerai pažįstu ir žinau paauglius, jų elgesį tam tikrose situacijose, jų mąstymą tam tikromis aplinkybėmis.
Pasirodo, kad nė velnio nieko nežinau ir tai, ką išmokau studijų metais apie juos, yra tik maža dalelė to, kas gali vykti tikrame maišto pilname paauglių pasaulyje.
Beskaitydama šią knygą aplink save mačiau ir regėjau dabartinį jaunimą, bandžiau suvokti jų poelgius bei mąstymą, stengiausi įsigilinti į jų kasdienes problemas šeimoje ir mokykloje.
Tuo pačiu stengiausi suvokti, kodėl jie kartais vienaip ar kitaip pasirenka sau priimtiną išlikimo variantą šiame gyvenime.
Absorbing story that held my attention. Very surprising ending! I'm mad at myself that for didn't see it coming.
Love her books
Interesting, but too much like "Life Support" that I've just finished two days ago - similar main characters, plot twists and even minor love affairs seem the same.
Well done..As all of her books are. I have read many of her books and Bloodstream is right up there with the best of them. Gerritsen will never let you down.
What a great book for the medically oriented! First mystery book I’ve read and I’m not sure if it can be topped.
This is the first book I have read by Tess Gerritsen and wow is it an amazing book! Her central character is Dr. Isles who is a Medical Examiner. In this story something is happening to the teeneagers of a town that's turning them into hostile violent, even murderous persons. Dr. Isles must discover what is causing this horrendous transformation before the situation spreads and becomes worse. After reading thise book, I will defintely read more of Gerritsen's intense thrillers. This one was hard to put down. Check it out for a great read.

Mình thích Tess ngay từ khi tình cờ đọc được một quyển tiểu thuyết của bà, một trong những cuốn đầu tiên của loạt tiểu thuyết quanh cặp đôi nhân viên điều tra Rizzoli và nữ bác sĩ pháp y Isles.
Nhưng chậm nhất là đến khoảng 2/3 quyển truyện thì người đọc đã có thể nghĩ được cốt lõi của câu chuyện sẽ đi theo chiều hướng nào, tuy là về tiểu tiết thì vẫn còn mập mờ đôi chút, tức là không biết tác giả sẽ giải quyết như thế nào.
