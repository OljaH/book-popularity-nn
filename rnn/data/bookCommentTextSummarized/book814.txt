Makes me want to buy some Liberty Bonds. And enlist.
This is a book in the set of original Tom Swift books, there have been five series published by the Stratemeyer Syndicate and they are a lesson in how literature for young people has changed over the last century.
Many people in science and technology have stated that the “Tom Swift” books were an inspiration to them growing up.
There are of course German spies and many expressions of anti-German fervor now that the United States has declared war on Germany,  The war hysteria even extends to criticism of Tom for not signing up for military service.
One feature of the books in this series that I find amusing is the presence of the black giant Koku.
In this installment WWI is on, and Our Hero Tom is being asked why he does not enlist and go teach them nasty Germans a lesson! He does not explain why, creating further suspicion about Tom's courage. However, we soon find that Tom is indeed doing his party by inventing a tank. Spies try to get it, but Our Hero Tom foils there plans, and the tank get sent off to Europe to teach the Kaiser a lesson!
Really good old classic young readers book about a young inventor that invents this awesome inventions and then goes on these wild and crazy adventures, sometimes getting into trouble in the process.
I read the Tom Swift Sr. books as a child and again when I got my Kindle in 2010. They are an easy read and enjoyable. It is interesting to see how writing has changed since these books were written.
Dnf. Didn't like the Librivox audio quality
