Some of the most celebrated thinkers of all time including Plato, Aristotle, Copernicus, Kant, Newton, Darwin, Freud, Jung, and Einstein all suffer the same slanderous buffeting by the forgetful zeitgeist of modern science: “They were wrong”.
A person need not be accurate for all Time…only for their time.Aristotle was a renaissance man in his own era: astronomist, botanist, zoologist, political scientist (tutored Alexander the Great), theatre and literary critic…all this, and still he is preeminently remembered as a philosopher.
Aristotle treated philosophy like a living art form rather than a dead science of empirical facts, and his ideas will live on because of it.
Supreme then among the sciences and superior to all subordinate science is that which knows the end for which everything takes place, which is the good for each thing and, as a whole, the highest good for all nature." Aristotle is confident that there is an objective reality "out there," beyond human senses, but one which can be understood.
Again, of two bodies, that is said to be the hotter which takes the longer time in cooling, as also we call that which is rapidly heated hotter than that which is long about it; as though the rapidity implied proximity and this again similarity of nature, while the want of rapidity implied distance and this again dissimilarity of nature." -Aristotle in On the Parts of Animals"When the objects of an inquiry, in any department, have principles, conditions, or elements, it is through acquaintance with these that knowledge, that is to say scientific knowledge, is attained.
Only cuts out the boring bits.
Philosophy has always been hard for me to read, it takes alot to work through the ideas
