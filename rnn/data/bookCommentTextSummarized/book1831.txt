Amazingthis book is now one of my favorite mysteries books. I love the characters and the plot of the story. I would recommend this book to anyone who is the the age of 13 or higher.
A good quick read. Sure did not see that ending coming at me.
Was a slow read in my opinion but interesting enough. definitely a twist at the end.
Western with lots of mystery and suspense, twists and turns in the plot.
