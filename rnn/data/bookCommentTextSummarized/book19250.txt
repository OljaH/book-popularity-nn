Favorite Quote: Adam didn’t approve of Walmart.Note: This is a spoiler-free review!I had not read any blurbs or spoilers for this book before I started it and let me tell you how surprised I was at the first few chapters in this one.
In River Marked we get a lot of Adam and Mercy.
But then something big happens and the rest finished quite nicely.The second reason I read this series is for the amazing intricacies of pack life Patricia Briggs has created.
Adam and Mercy are removed from pack (or as much as they can be) in this one.
Still loving this series! (view spoiler)[I'm a bit disappointed the actual wedding ceremony wasn't detailed beyond the set up and reception. Also I would have liked more details on the first night of the honeymoon ;) (hide spoiler)] Another fun and fast read!
Fans of the series might be very relieved that this book's mystery doesn't deal with fae, vampire or pack issues unlike previous books.After a lovely wedding, Mercy and Adam head off on their romantic and sex fueled honeymoon.
How much more does the Mercedes Thompson series have in it?
I enjoy the Thompson world, and I'm glad that Briggs has taken it up in her Alpha and Omega book series, but I'm honestly not holding out for anymore books that focus on Mercy and her crew.
I'm glad that it's coming to an end and hopefully the last book will maintain the same good quality as the ones that came before it.
Re-read March 27th 2017****Spoilers if you haven't read the previous books.****Adam and Mercy go on a luxury camping honeymoon, and trouble and excitement follow, because nothing can be simple or boring in Mercy's life. River monsters, psycho otters, other shifters and Coyote show up to make things interesting. Love Adam and Mercy together! They are definitely a power couple. Lorelei King's narration as usual was amazing!
Re-reading confirms the overall issues with the series Silver Borne/series review but it remains an enjoyable installment.It begins with Mercy rescuing a male friend from himself, followed by pre-wedding jitters, encouraged by Mercy's mom now including butterflies and balloons.
Adam and Mercy then hitch up a camper and head to a private campground along the Columbia River where they have lots of tastefully alluded to sex in between eating hot dogs and going for runs.
Mercy and Adam are innocently playing along the river when they discover an injured man in a boat.
We get a LOT more time with just Mercy and Adam.
I became very quickly attached to characters we just met, and love Adam and Mercy even more than I ever have.
Bliss.Unfortunately things don't go quite as planned and when they find a person with his foot bit off, Mercy's suddenly thrust into a mystery that brings her into much closer contact with her own personal history.I loved this book.
I get that, and I like that Mercy saves the day, but I wish this could be handled a bit differently in the books.
Patricia Briggs has this amazing ability to keep this series feeling fresh.
Unlike other longer series (for example, the Sookie Stackhouse Mysteries) the plot lines never feel contrived or forced.
River Marked is the epitome of Brigg's ability to tell a story that feels so real, despite the fantasy.
When more is revealed about Mercy's background it seems authentic, not like Sookie's fairyblood, which seemed pulled out of Harris' ass.
The continued growth and development of Mercy and Adam's relationship is one of the things that keeps bringing me back to these novels.
River MarkedMercy is back, sassier than ever and with her classic ability to find trouble literarlly anywhere  “I start to think he hates me, and he does something nice, like save my life or give me a cool pep talk” We meet some new enemies and allies, see old friends again~ all just a great big Tahitian love festI love how she thinks both saving her goddamn life and getting a pep talk are both nice things to do  “You quenched Lugh’s walking stick in the blood of an ancient Native American monst
“I start to think he hates me, and he does something nice, like save my life or give me a cool pep talk”
We meet some new enemies and allies, see old friends again~ all just a great big Tahitian love festI love how she thinks both saving her goddamn life and getting a pep talk are both nice things to do 
Nice Mercy, gotta make any situation worse—eh i’d do the same thing probably
“You are going to be the death of me.”I sucked in my breath.
Adam, don’t let me do that.”“Shh,” he said.
I had a lot of fun listening to the audio of this story.This story takes place away from most of the group and I have to say that I missed some of the characters that I have grown to love just a bit.
There are some interesting characters that are a part of this installment including some that knew Mercy's father.This book had a lot of really good elements.
Adam and Mercy are away for most of this book and I did kind of miss the rest of the regular group.
Wow, I feel like this series needed this book at this point.
If you've been aching for some quality Adam/Mercy time, you get it in spades!
Just good old loving and bonding between a couple that has very little face time in their every day life.
Due to the enormous responsibility of Adam's position in the pack...and therefore Mercy's as well...they get miniscule amounts of down time.
Even if this is the majority of romance for the rest of the series, I think it will be enough.
As every, one of the BEST UF series available!
I knew I was going to love reading Mercy Thompson’s adventures!!!
I am totally addicted!!River Marked is the 6th book in the series and it’s quite different to the previous novels as it’s mostly set away from Mercy’s home and a whole new set of characters are introduced, which gives us more information about Mercy’s heritage.Mercy & Adam are now married and mated and set off on their honeymoon to a secluded camp in the Columbia River area.
There’s something in the river that is killing people and Mercy has some connection to the monster, named River Devil.Between trying to discover the reason for the killings, she encounters a Native American tribe that knows something about her earlier life.
4.5 STARS!!!Even after five books, Briggs is able to keep the Mercy Thompson world fresh.
I found that this book was very different from the others.
The Pack is set on the sidelines, while Mercy and Adam take centre stage and new characters are introduced.
The newbies are very interesting because they are the first Native Americans we’ve encountered in this series apart from Mercy.
I thought that as Mercy entered a new phase in her life, her friends were also dealing with changes in theirs.
I just adore Adam and Mercy together.
So I wished (i.e., asked the publisher) for a copy of the upcoming Mercy Thompson book, Fire Touched.
Plus there's an Alpha and Omega book that, I've been reliably informed, absolutely needs to be read right after River Marked.
River Marked is the story that takes place mostly during Mercy's honeymoon, which starts off wonderfully and then goes south in a way that only Mercy's life can, with something very ancient, fearsome and hungry in the water.
A fair amount of Native American mythology--or Briggs' variation on it, anyway--is woven into the storyline, along with the usual suspects (werewolves, vampires and fae).
*** 4 ***So once again I have to write something about a book in the Mercy Thompson world and I feel like anything I say would be redundant...
I love the strongly influenced by the Native American culture of storytelling and mythology tale Patricia Briggs has gifted us with.
Going camping in nature seems like a good idea at first, but obviously trouble keeps finding our part time coyote everywhere.
There is danger, love, friendships, and hidden agendas as always, expanding our understanding of Mercy's nature...I recommend this book to all fans of the series and the Urban Fantasy genre.
As much as I've loved reading every book so far in this series, it is about time that we got something like this one.
The old Mercy and Adam are back at it again but with sweeter, more tender moments between them that will make you melt.
Her heritage, her (finally) feeling like she belongs somewhere, and of course, her relationship with Adam and I couldn't of asked for more.We got so much that has been missing from the other books without even realizing it had been missing.
We finally get the in depth took into what makes Mercy, Mercy and I couldn't of been happier about it.
4 "Who is Mercy Thompson?" Stars for the story and 5 Stars for the narration!
Six books into the series and the Mercy Thompson Series is still holding strong as one of my favorite PNR/UF romance series of all time.
To me, this book almost read as a stand-alone with a somewhat different focus than the prior books in the series.
Additionally, the setting of the story--Mercy's and Adam's honeymoon--removes them a bit from the usual cast of characters which also sets a different tone.
Lorelei King as always renders fantastic narration.
4.5/5.0*warning* a huge torrent of gushing admiration about to commence...I now understand people who are so blinded by their love of an author, they truly believe they can write no wrong (listen closely Lisa Kleypas fans) The eye rolling is over, I am officially capitulating and stand repentant...
Her Mercedes Thompson series is humorous, suspenseful, touching, warm, scary, inventive, romantic - everything, just everything I love in a story!
While the plot-line of a water monster was not as riveting to me as others have been, the interest and page-turning suspense was still present right along with the touch of humor that makes Mercedes such a beloved character.
The book is very much about two things: Adam and Mercy's relationship and Mercy's...biological roots.
I think that the outside conflict of the "big bad" is instead used to support the development of those two stories, rather than being the driving force of the book.
Readers who aren't into that might not enjoy this book.
On the whole, I appreciated that this was a further development of Mercy's character and her relationship with Adam, but some readers may have preferred that the author not focus on those elements and instead spotlight outside conflicts like in some of the previous books.
I don't understand why so many people liked this book so much less than the others. It's my absolute favorite so far. I love, love, LOVED it. I've always loved Native American Folklore though. But that's just me.
I never get tired of this series!!! i love patricia briggs. She is a very good writer. I can't wait to start the next book!!! 5 stars!!!
Picture of the Columbia River Gorge, by Doug Porter[image error]★★★★☆ (This is a review of the audiobook.) This sixth installment of Mercy Thompson’s series is very well narrated by Lorelei King.
Mercy also gets some answers about her Native American Indian father she never knew.This one is a little different; no mechanic’s shop, very little pack interaction.
(Thanks goodness Jesse made a phone call to complain to her father about Darryl.) And the pace seemed slower to me, too, though Ms. Briggs always has a nice way of setting future scenes up without me even knowing it.
I LOVE the Mercedes Thompson series!!!!!!!!!
okay, so now that that's out of the way.
Mrs. Briggs....you best bring my boy Stephan and his mystery machine back.
or we gonna have a few issues.*************************** after reading *******************************************STEFAN WAS BACK!
not in a way i expected but yes he was indeed back.
Thank you Ms. Briggs.
This book was pretty good, I felt you could see more of Mercy and Adams relationship develop and how they've grown, and how Mercy has grown as a person and is not just impulsive but now thinks about the consequences of her actions.
Pretty good book.
Woo-hoo!!! Bring on a new Mercy, I can't wait :) :) :) :)
I really enjoyed this latest Mercy Thompson book.I think that watching Adam and Mercy get married and have a honeymoon was great fun, especially since we all know Mercy can't go 5 minutes without a new enemy.This time, the Fae are involved in their honeymoon plans, which can come to no good.
In this book, Mercy is up against an ancient river monster and some Otterkin who are eating all the swimmers.
I loved him, LOVED him in this installment-wish we'd seen more of him.Overall another great installment in the Mercedes Thompson series, if a bit slow at times.http://www.demonloversbooksandmore.co...
I'm sorry, this is going to come across as completely selfish but so be it, I didn't care what happened to anyone in this book EXCEPT Mercy & Adam. Saying that, the first 2/3 of the book involved a story I didn't care for with a group of people I cared less about. Yeah, I know, I'm a bitch. But I want Mercy and Adam, and I want them with the pack. So sue me, I'm selfish.
She always has amazing covers, I can't wait!
In longer urban fantasy series, a road trip is often involved, taking the characters away on a quest and away from their usual world. This one focuses mainly on Mercy and Adam. We delve more into Mercy’s heritage and the world of walkers. I adore Mercy and Adam as a couple but I found I missed some of the usual players. I feel happy for Mercy to have immersed herself in Native American magic as up til now she hasn’t had much information to work with.Next!
A lot of fans won't agree with me, but at this point Mercy and Adam haven't gotten a lot of page time together.
Thankfully River Mark is the book where Mercy and Adam really get to interact.
It made them feel like a real couple and for me the last book really took some shortcuts in developing characters.
It was great getting a slower pace, though it's still a crazy rush of a read, and finally get the time to develop Mercy and Adam together.
