Once upon a time there were three bears who lived in a wee house in the woods.Once upon a time there were three billy goats who lived near a bridge.Once upon a time there were three soldiers, tramping together down the roads after the war.Once upon a time there were three little pigs.Once upon a time there were three brothers.No, this is it. This is the variation I want. It was a better coming of age than Catcher in the Rye, but I also thought Twilight was a better coming-of-age than Catcher in
Cadence and her crew call themselves "The Liars." The Liars are composed of her cousins Mirren, Johnny, and the outcast "Healthcliff," Indian love interest, Gat.The Liars supposedly cause trouble.
I thought that was her being overdramatic again, until I realized that the guy was fucking bandaging her up afterwards.The main character has a huge tendency to use purple prose.
She describes her migraines like they were the end of the world, which, I understand to some people they might be, but if you're getting a fucking migraine, there's really no bloody need to get all freaking poetic about it.
“I’m not saying he wants to be the guy who only likes white people,” Gat went on.
This is the kind of book that, when I finish reading it, I’m like FINALLY and then throw the book out of the window (in this case not applicable because of digital copy so I'm doing it through a gif.) But really, what a weird story and an uncomfortable and pretentious atmosphere this We Were Liars book has.
If it did, this is not the book for you.)It’s like the author wanted to make this story ‘phenomenal’ and so damn poignant and thought that by adding some metaphorical sentences, a different writing style and a heavy recycled subject she would succeed.
This might not make sense unless you've read the book, but wow it was powerful.3) The use of fairy tales from the main character to describe situations.4) The sense of complete mystery and suspicion: I was always questioning everything.5) The use of dramatic lines.
I think sometimes side characters can feel inconsequential and here they felt really important.There weren't very many things I didn't like, to be honest, but there was one:1) The title.
I don't want to say anything in case spoilers, but I don't think it's the perfect title.Two final things:1) I have a theory.
We were tedious.
sobbing. sobbing. sobbing. so much love for this book, and its perfect, perfect ending. i can't even capitalize right now. i don't even want to capitalize right now. in fetal position.sob. my souuuuul.
It's true what they're saying: you're better off if I tell you nothing about this book.So I will just say two things.1) It is worth reading.
Even though I only gave it 3 stars.2) I gave it 3 stars because of the writing style, which irritated the hell out of me.
The fact that it got 3 stars after annoying me so much will hopefully give you some indication of how much I liked the idea.It's a very clever book and an incredibly sophisticated piece of YA.
The writing was too choppy and fragmented and I hated the frequent use of nouns as adjectives.
Like this:
Like he was searching for something.
It's been awhile since I have so totally hated a book. I'm surprised at how varied the feelings on here about this book are...some of my friends hated it. Some of them liked/loved it. I still love them....Let's get to why I hated this so very frigging much. The main character is a twit...but then the whole family is: Welcome to the beautiful Sinclair family.No one is a criminal.No one is an addict.No one is a failure.The Sinclairs are athletic, tall and handsome.  That's actually the good part o
In some parts of the book the author tries and make the character act like she has redeeming qualifications-but then a short few pages later I just want to smash her again.
The cream ones with the embroidery."It was easiest to tell her I would.And later, I told her I had.But Bess has asked Mirren to do the same thing,and neither one of usbegged Granddadfor the fucking tablecloths.Then that lovely twist of an ending:I'm probably going to hell for this but don't click if you gonna whine...(view spoiler)[I thought it was the burning of the housebut noooooo...it's that they are all fucking dead..except for princess dumbass.
It felt like a really random story about a rich, white girl and her white girl problems, crying her white girl tears and I felt myself unsure about what the point of it all was.And maybe that makes me sound extremely heartless, but I couldn't relate to the main character (no, I'm not even going to tell you her name because I want you to go in blind).
But somewhere along the lines, I started to become intrigued with the story because it became this strange, wild thing that I couldn't piece together.Lockhart uses a very odd narration with fragmented sentences and strange descriptions, but I thought it was beautiful and unique.
Tragic, yet hauntingly beautiful story.
so, just like Little Bee, this book begs you "NOOO, DON'T TELL ITS SEEEEKRITS!!" and if anyone asks you how it ends, just LIE.so part of me is tempted to write this whole long review about how this book is a magical adventure focusing on a young girl in manhattan during the blackout of 2003, when all the red pandas living in the sewers came out to play, carrying tiny flashlights and shepherding people from manhattan to their homes in the outer boroughs and all the lessons this young girl learns along the way from her red panda guide about life and humanity and art history and, ultimately, herself.
”We were warm and shivering,and young and ancient,and alive."When I began to read this book I went in completely blind and had absolutely no clue what it was about.
The Liars will make you wonder, they’ll make you question what happened in summer 15 and you’ll not only become curious but you’ll also feel a need to read on.
If she gets in, I’m confined to my bedroom for a day or maybe two.”Are you curious and intrigued already?
If yes, I hope you’ll enjoy the book as much as I did.
I do not suffer fools.I like a twist of meaning.”
Cadence and her family spend every summer on a private island, courtesy of her racist and classist grandfather.
All of her aunts constantly vie for the grandfather's attention and favor (in an attempt to keep ahold of the family fortune).Cadence and her cousins consider themselves above such petty actions and spend most summers making trouble, being rich and taking advantage of the liquor bar.
Candace (ooo, that girl...) is such a great example of why kids should be given hard limits.
This chick literally goes to a private island every summer....
*5 Stars*There’s not even a Scrabble word for how I’m feeling right now…This story left me defeated, but its tragedy was paired equally with an unconventional beauty.
The story is told through the voice of a confused, emotional, and dejected eighteen year old girl—and the writing remained consistent with her distinctive perspective.
I don't think I ever fully connected with any character at all--and the fact that I was moved to tears by the finish is what made this a five-star read for me.
Twists slowly unravel▪ Writing: Poetic.
(view spoiler)[Not a conventional HEA, no.

that wasn't what i was expecting! IF YOU HAVEN'T READ THIS YET, JUST JUMP INTO IT. It's better the less you know about it! I just posted my full booktalk! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5uex... =)
lets play two truths and a lie. ready? i will go first. - this book has an unreliable narrator and you cant trust anything she tells you.  - this story has such deep secrets, even its secrets have secrets.  - this novel has a twist that you wont see coming, but you will try to convince yourself that you did. think you got it?i can guarantee you dont.because the best lies are those based on truth.so read this book for yourself.maybe then you will be able to spot the imposter.and if anyone asks you,just lie.↠ 3.5 stars
WOW. Just... wow...
Where do I even get these ideas?Instead, 'We Were Liars' tells the story of four young teens.
Needless to say, the Sinclair family is filthy rich.The story is centered on Cadence, the oldest granddaughter of Mr. Sinclair.
Despite the obvious differences in race and financial standing, Gat becomes good friends with Cadence and her cousins.
Together, they come to be known as "The Four Liars".Cadence and Gat soon become inseparable.
Worst of all, Gat seems to have abandoned her in her time of need.After a prolonged absence, Cadence returns to the island once again.
However, I found myself really enjoying the story of Cadence and the "beautiful Sinclair family".

“Tragedy is ugly and tangled, stupid and confusing.” Everyone warned me about the twist in this book!
A patriarch, his three daughters and their children summer every year on Beechwood Island, where each of the three daughters had a house for themselves and their children.
The summer of their fifteenth year, Cady has an accident.
When she returns for Summer Seventeen, things don’t feel the same.
Her migraines and head injury cause Cady to suffer memory blanks from summer fifteen.
Though I knew there would be a shock twist, I was in no way prepared for the one they gave me!
____________________________________________  “Be a little kinder than you have to.”   ____________________________________________Okay so where to begin.I liked this book,you can see it by my rating,but I don't feel it ended right.I am not saying it was a bad ending,not at all,I enjoyed it,but there was no justice.The next part of the review will contain spoilers because I want to discuss with you some part of this book.Okay so let's begin:____________________________________________  “Do not a
Like you know that the house leaks on gasoline or whatever liquid they used and before knowing that the friend on the floors above and from the basement are out and safe,she lit the freaking room to fire.I know I might be harsh a little,and I know they were fifteen,but I think someone has to mention it,because we all know that Cadence was the main character and I,personally,don't feel bad for what happened to her, and to be honest, I think she deserved worse,because it was her fault.
The real moral questions raised by the subject of the book, including racism, land ownership, inheritance, materialism, greed, and manipulation, are acted out in flat, white-hat/black-hat morality plays by stock characters of little or no complexity.
Those questions are then answered by an intruding author's voice that patronizes the reader by declaring single answers to every moral issue raised.
Finally, the main character, despite being the pov character in a novel of psychological recovery, is a completely empty vehicle for plot and the author's voice, with no identifiable personality or characteristics by the end of the book.
I don't cry a lot but boy this had me sobbingI don't even know how to describe the feelings this story left me with. Just read it and you'll understand
We Were Liars is an incredible, heartbreaking read that really messes with your mind until the very end.
The plot itself is one you can't talk about or read about as you're bound to find out spoilers.
It did take me a bit to get all the characters and different disaccords in order - the cryptic, mind-boggly nature of this plot and writing makes it hard to make sense of what's being conveyed at times, but this is clearly purposeful and I ended up impressed by its cleverness.
But anyways, this review has to stay short because, la la la - no spoilers - it's that kind of read.
WARNING: This book is a liar and it will cause you to cry for the next three hours, it crushes souls and it severely destroy hearts. Proceed with caution.I spent the whole time sobbing. trying to catch my breath. then sobbing again.We Were Liars scarred me and Im broken way beyond repair. And if anyone asks you how it ends, just LIE.You can listen to my fanmix of We Were Liars on 8tracks.
If I had expected less, I probably would have enjoyed it more, but as it stands, it ticked a few boxes for my various readerly pet peeves:1) A first person narrator2) An unreliable narrator (This is not a spoiler.
If those things don't bother you, or at least don't bother you as much as they bother me, then you'll probably enjoy this book.
If you read enough fiction featuring amnesiac and/or mentally unbalanced main characters, the ending to this book won't come totally out of left field.
I'm pretty disappointed in this one. To me, it was very predictable and underwhelming. However, I did really like atmosphere of the story, the characters, and the writing. Listening to it as an audiobook definitely enhanced the experience.
