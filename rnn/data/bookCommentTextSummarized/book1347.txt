I love Albert Payson Terhune. He writes very good dog books. Wolf is one of my favorites, though it is sad towards the end. Terhune is one of those writers who, understandably, really gets dogs.
This book was a wonderful statement about being "different," and an introduction to the form of the tragedy. As a child it was my first tragedy and it taught me that endings are not always happy ones, but there is great comfort in the memory of a loved ones heroic last act. The self-acceptance and confidence of the outcast Wolf influenced me greatly and at the end, oh, how I wept!! And read it again and again. It was one of the formative books of my junior years.
My first introduction to collies, long before I ever heard of Lassie. I have read every Terhune book I could find but this first one about Wolf is my favorite. They very strongly influenced how I felt about dogs growing up and how I believed animals should be treated.
I liked this book a lot! It was sort of like "A Dogs Life" but Wolf isn't a stray dog.
Wolf was the outsider, a funny-looking, but purebred, collie, and I loved reading about him. Another of my dad's old books that I enjoyed.
I don't remember the details of this book but I do remember it was one of my favorite Terhunes.
