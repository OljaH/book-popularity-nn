Much like The Last Wish before, Sword of Destiny is a collection of short stories following a talented witcher called Geralt of Rivia.
Although you can start the series with Blood of Elves which is where the full-length novels commence, I can't recommend enough that even though a handful of these short stories are hit-and-miss, that they will add considerable depth to the future narrative arcs.
If you decide to read the short story collections first I'd truly recommend starting with The Last Wish and not Sword of Destiny.
The stories of this anthology are longer and less funny although one of them can be considered to be entirely humorous.
It is a standard situation when two people are deeply in love with each other, but both of them keep creating obstacles that prevent them from being together, knowing exactly what they are doing.
I mean imagine two people meet each other, fall in love, get married right away within a couple of pages, and fall into a standard married routine.
Geralt and Yennefer is exactly such couple.
So yes, there is definitely some good stuff here: a little bit of intrigue, a pinch of adventure, a dash of Let's Gleefully Hack at Things (LGHaT™), a speck of humor, a drop of shenanigans and a soupçon of my homicidally sexy boyfriend.

I’m sure the games are awesome, but I’m quite glad that I can immerse myself in "The Witcher" universe through my preferred medium.“The Last Wish” and “The Sword of Destiny” are each a collection of short, inter-connected stories that read very much like a character study.
It reminds me of Tolkien, in that there is a depth to the world Sapkowski has created that makes you feel like it's been around for a very long time.
Sapkowski has an interesting way of setting up a story according to traditional fantasy and fairy tale fashion, then allowing the darkest facets of our own world bleed through the pages.
Collection of stories. Some were good, others not so good.
I read this book in swedish (called Ödets Svärd - Sword of Destiny) and let me just say;WOW.
Sapkowski, you f-ing rule.It doesn't seem like the Swedish publishers will publish any more Sapkowskibooks, and all I can say is; Your Loss, man.Luckily, the Witcher Saga is available in English!Everything about this book is awesome, from the characters to the world, to the humor and the fighting scenes.
(unless you are a ghoul or something, and then Geralt will find you and destroy you.)So, if you haven't yet read any Andrzej Sapkowski, do it now.
Review iz 2014.: Jedne večeri se Džon Grin i Paolo Koeljo otkinuli od Rubinovog Vinjaka i odlučili da pišu fantastiku pošto tu sad leži lova. "Ti dnapišeš onaj 'lozofski deo one... one... 'nutrašnje mono-loooge... i spoljašnje...kaksezovu", zapetlja Grin jezikom, "a ja ćdnapišem ljubvne priče i dialogitakoto". "Ae", reče Koeljo, pre nego što je glavom opalio o već lepljivi sto i skotrljao se na pod bifea "Čep".I tako je nastala ova knjiga.
This second short story collection is unfortunately the weakest part of the Witcher universe that I have read.
It is not on the level of The Last Wish, the stories feel mashed together without the same sense of purpose as in the other book, and they are less exciting, less symbolic and less epic.However, I love experiencing the world of the Witcher and following Geralt of Rivia and Yennefer of Vengerberg on their adventures (even though Yennefer is dreadfully annoying in this book compared to other volumes).
4 of 5 stars at The BiblioSanctum http://bibliosanctum.com/2015/12/17/a...Sword of Destiny is a collection of short stories featuring Geralt of Rivia, and it is actually the second book in The Witcher sequence.
But because the English editions of the series’ first three full-length novels were released before this one (not to mention I was also pretty adamant about waiting for the audiobook, which wasn’t released until December 2015), I had to read it out of order.Now that I’ve completed the book though, so much is finally falling into place!
Sword of Destiny bridges the events between the end of The Last Wish (the first short story collection) and Blood of Elves (the first novel of the series), making it a must-read for fans of The Witcher.
It started out way too boring, its not that the characters are not interesting but it lacked a plot. Im not a short story person perse. After the mermaid chapter it got more intense and interesting. Thats when it picked up my interest (Brokilon, cool amazonian chicks and Ciri ) and I went through it quickly. Really cool ending, got me a wee it emotional xD
As the story unfolds, we discovers that others' motivations are also more varied than we might've guessed.A Shard of IceIn a dingy midden heap of a town, Geralt must compete with a powerful wizard for the affections of the beautiful sorceress Yennefer.
but while Geralt is still there, a boat of pearl divers vanishes - and a second request (or order) is issued: discover what monster might have slaughtered the divers so that commerce can resume.
The Sword of DestinyWhile on a dangerous mission as envoy to the Lady of the forest of Brokilon, Geralt stumbles across a badly-wounded acquaintance.
Ach, ich liebe diese Welt. Ich liebe Geralt. Ich liebe Rittersporn. Ich liebe alles. Bin so froh, dass ich noch eine ganze Reihe Bücher vor mir hab.
I've read these stories before (obvs) but that doesn't make them a bit more interesting, entertaining or edge-of-your-seat worthy.
Read it because I still mostly feel all those things for sure.
I will say that I'm loving the stories in terms of action, adventure and Geralt.
I start on page 1 with investment already and I just want to be clear that this was never going to be anything resembling an objective reading experience for me.
The two things that give me pause here are the writing style and the treatment of women within the story.
3.5/5 stars.The compelling characterisation of Geralt and the imaginative world of Slavic lore and fairy-tale retellings continue in this second collection of short stories.
Sword of Destiny was published after the first three full-length novels of The Witcher.
I find that The Last Wish is overall a better book than Sword of Destiny with the connectivity of having a frame story wrapped around the short stories.
Ever since I've read the short story "A Question of Price" in The Last Wish, I was waiting for this crucial moment; the introduction of Princess Ciri and her first meeting with Geralt.
«La espada del destino tiene dos filos... y uno eres tú». «La espada del destino» es el segundo libro de la saga de Geralt de Rivia, mejor conocido como el brujo o The Witcher. Esta saga presenta un comienzo atípico en relación a otras obras de fantasía porque los dos primeros tomos son colecciones de historias cortas que ayudan a conocer a Geralt, el mundo en el cual transcurre la saga y los personajes que acompañarán al brujo a lo largo de su viaje; se puede decir que la saga comienza de verd
Pero esto no quiere decir que por usar un lenguaje vulgar sean cuentos de mal gusto, sino todo lo contrario: los títulos de cada una de estas historias guardan un gran significado y las metáforas que utiliza Sapkowski para presentar cada tema son impresionantes y muy hermosas; el cierre de la última historia (que se titula «Algo más») es uno de los mejores ejemplos.Si tuviera que señalar algún aspecto negativo de este libro, además de la falta de cohesión entre las historias de la que hablaba anteriormente, es cómo el autor maneja los "encuentros amorosos" de Geralt.
The more stories I read about Geralt of Rivia the more I love him.
The best thing about these stories is that the characters are so very real despite living in a fairy tale world.I liked this set of short stories a little better.
In THE LAST WISH the only thing holding the stories together was that they all starred Geralt.
The thing I love most about Geralt is how honest he is as a character.
At heart this book is a fairy tale soap opera staring a cat eyed monster hunter.
Çok duygusaldı buluşmaları 😢İlk kitaptan çok daha iyiydi. Üçüncü cilt ne zaman gelir acaba 😫
This collection of short stories is not available in an official English translation so I had to read the fan translations.
Nothing extraordinarily original or outstanding, but there was something in the quality of the character creation, dialog, and interactions that makes the stories have a very intimate feel.
It's nice to read a book about "monster hunting" that tries to give the hunter a soul and relies less on heavy action sequences and stale monster types (Hello Monster Hunter International.
I'm still sour from having just read that one.) I'm looking forward to immediately jumping into The Last Wish which is another short story collection in the Witcher universe.
OK, six, if you're counting Season of Storms, but I'll deal with that story collection last.Either way, I'm really enjoying my re-read so far.
And of course, it's great to see some other characters pop up who will become much more prominent in the future.Because this particular collection is less action-packed, with some stories being pretty introspective, the pacing ends up being rather moderate.
This isn't a bad thing, I actually really enjoyed this approach, but it's something to be aware of, particularly for people who are here for the monster action.And now, onto Blood of Elves!
Which is a shame because I do quite like Geralt and find the magic and monsters and all of that jazz enjoyable + interesting.Something that definitely bogged down my enjoyment - and was coincidentally the only major issue I had with the previous book - was the gross sexist/rapey throwaway lines and world-building.SPOILERS BELOW - Yennefer is overpowered, bound, has her blouse ripped open, her breasts groped, and is then basically told she's going to be passed around by a group of dwarves to 'enjoy' after they've completed their hunt.
Con El último deseo y La espada del destino lo que hace Sapkowski es introducirnos en su mundo y ambientación, presentarnos y perfilarnos algunos de los principales protagonistas, además de dar un giro a la mitología de Europa central y del este.
Ya me fascino con el primer libro, pero creo que aquí aún esta mucho más depurado, sobre todo en los dos últimos relatos.
تا قبل ازدو داستان آخر این کتاب یه ستاره بود.
دو تا داستان آخر 5 ستاره بود.
ناگهان وارد دنیای اصلی ویچر شدیم و به نوعی پیش زمینه ای بود برای داستان اصلی.ترجمه در مجموع خوب بود و روان .
فقط دو تا نکته:اول اینکه نمیدونم چرا مترجم اسم شاعر که در تمام نسخه ها به وضوح "دندلایون" هست رو "جسکیر" ترجمه کرده.دوم اینکه در آخر داستان یک جایی سرخود توشته یک سال قبل و کلا روند داستان رو پیچیده کرده بود.غیر از این دو مورد ایراد دیگه ای نداشت.سرنوشت یک شمشیر دو لبه است که یک لبه اش تویی و لبه دیگه اش مرگه.
"It's like they said! Geralt! it's like they said! Am I your destiny? Say it! Am I your destiny?""You're much more than that, Ciri. Much more."Fuck. Too many feels in these past two audiobooks.
Another great collection of Geralt's adventures!There was more emotional depth than in the first set of stories, especially in A Little Sacrifice and Something More.
The very last page of A Little Sacrifice wrecked my world for a few minutes.
The feels man, the feels.The only story I didn't care for much was Eternal Flame.
The pacing was horrible and the twist was foreshadowed so heavily that I already knew what to expect, therefore ruining any satisfaction at the end.
Reasons to give this a read:1.) The first meeting of Geralt and Ciri!2.) Mermaids full of attitude and sass.3.) Here be dragons.
Golden dragons!4.) Geralt on acid.
Me ha faltado algo para darle 4 estrellas, pero tampoco son 3.Es entretenido porque hay muchas historias y no te da tiempo a aburrirte, pero yo ya quería una trama más continua.
La historia que más me ha gustado ha sido la del dragón, porque los dragones son mi debilidad.La de las dríadas del bosque espero que la vuelvan a tocar más tarde en alguno de los libros porque tengo mucha curiosidad.Y ahora voy a hablar un poco (muy poco) de los personajes.
La historia de Essie me ha encantado y me ha dado muchísima pena.
U priči "Komadić leda" ponovo pratimo odnos između Jenefer i Geralta (view spoiler)[kao i njihov rastanak, ali ne definitivan (hide spoiler)], dok "Večni plamen" prikazuje susret sa mimikom koji unosi haos u život trgovca kojeg oponaša.
(view spoiler)[Naime, u priči iz prve knjige "Pitanje cene", Geralt rešava delikatnu situaciju u kraljevskoj porodici i tada, kada biva upitan šta traži kao cenu za učinjen trud, izgovara: Daćeš mi ono što već poseduješ, a o čemu ne znaš.
(view spoiler)[Ono što trgovac nije ni mogao da pretpostavi jeste da je njegova supruga, u njegovom odsustvu, prihvatila devojčicu iz izgnanstva, a devojčica je, ni manje ni više - Ciri.
Alucino con la cantidad de registros que tiene en los diálogos, haciendo que cada personaje tenga voz propia.
Grandísimo trabajo también el del traductor.En este segundo tomo sigue con el formato de relatos, para profundizar en la historia de los personajes pero sin un hilo conductor como sucedía en el primer libro.
Esto ha hecho que estuviera algo perdido en la cronología de los relatos y su relación con los del primer tomo.
También hay un par de ellos que me resultaron algo lentos.Pero las 4 estrellas se las llevan los dos últimos.
Kao i prva knjiga - brzo, osvežavajuće, bez opterećujućeg razvlačenja, s malo više humora i mnogo bolje osmišljenim celinama/pričama.Utkana poznata mitologija, to jest poznata bića ne ostavljaju utisak prežvakavanja već poznatog jer su preoblikovana u skladu s pričama - odlično utkana u piščev svet koji mi se, kako čitanje odmiče, sve više dopada. Za razliku od nekih drugih serijala, koji su mi se smučili na drugoj knjizi jer vode u beskrajno prežvakavanje po svetovima koji sa svakim poglavljem postaju bespotrebno sve veći i veći, ovu knjigu mogu svakom ljubitelju fantastike da preporučim.
Sapkowski knows what he's doing. He just knows.
Oh Geralt, how do I love you?
Enough to sneak chapters on my phone whenever I can.
So yeah yeah, I came to the books through the Witcher 3 game.
A quick trip through the wiki helped a little, but there's nothing like source material.
All this backstory is finally filling the massive holes in my knowledge (and finally introducing me to the people behind the Gwent cards).More Geralt side quests, all wrapped around more of the story of young child Ciri and their shared destiny, with some Yennifer on the side.
Special appearance by ...
Geralt's mom!
