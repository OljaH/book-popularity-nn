I can’t say much because a friend (Karen❤) is still reading it but I wanted to post something.Review edit.
So Karen finished and has posted her review.
What a great book!
I loved these two.One of the things I loved about it was that the story spans over a period of time where we get a back story on Francesca that propels you into a new period of time.
(Does that make sense?) Loved watching them grow and change too.Skeet was great to have around and I loved the relationship that he had with Dallie.
The humor was great.
And yes, there were some pretty sweet sexy moments too.
She was the most beautiful British bauble in Europe's jet-set playgrounds. Now she's broke, furious, and limping down a backwoods road in an ugly pink Southern Belle gown....He was tall, lean, and all-American gorgeous. He liked his brews cold and women loved to keep him warm. Why in hell is he stopping his car for this woebegone, surly Scarlett?  I read this book about 4 or 5 years ago and I loved it. I re-read the book about two years ago and I loved it. I recommended it to Karen and Sharon
He liked his brews cold and women loved to keep him warm.
I re-read the book about two years ago and I loved it.
I re-read the book about two years ago and I loved it.
Read it a third time and I ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT.
Written 26 years ago sure its a bit dated but I didn't care.
I love to read these older books.
I'm old enough to remember 26 years ago pretty well.
Gotta love Skeet, the old codger.
I am sure I will read this one again some time in the future.
I loved it. This is my second time reading it and I thought it was great. Loved Dallie - the overbearing jerk. Ms Fancy Pants - what a girl - dusted herself off and got on with life. Please read this book. It is so much more than any of the one star reviews. OK it may be an oldie but I don't think it is at all dated. She even made the golf seem interesting - I was on the edge of my seat at the Classic!!
i appreciated the characters for what they were (imperfect) and the story for what it was (covering a long timespan from decades ago) and the couple's chemistry was really top-notch.But. When a book is written in 1989 things happen.
My hope is that SEP has grown as an author and no longer has hurtful language like this aimed at a community.
My other issue is this didn't feel like a romance.
I want to like my characters in a romance-and that's about the only place that's necessary, and this golfer and spoiled British immigrant were really unlikeable, awful people.
The heroine goes through one heck of a journey and I would have gave the book 2 stars for her alone but she makes a decision (view spoiler)[doesn't tell hero she had his kid, even when original reason not to, wanted to stand on her own feet, becomes mute (hide spoiler)]; I just couldn't side with her.
The vibe of a guy throwing anything at the heroine in anger, screaming at her, or even slapping her "with only a small portion of his strength" in any context is take a good hard look at worthy but without personal relationship for knowing personalities, it feels abusive for the heroine.
5 STARS[image error] First off, I want to thank my lovely friend Maura for recommending this wonderful book! I absolutely loved it. It was my first book by Susan Elizabeth Phillips, and I must say… I am impressed. This woman can write. The story was fairly involved and spanned a period of over ten years. It was a riches-to-rags-and back story of a young English socialite who was raised in wealth and frivolity all her life, only to be left alone in the world after the death of her mother at the a
It’s not like she’s without prospects though… there are the multiple proposals she’ s received from some of the worlds wealthiest men, but unfortunately she’s scorned them all.
And so their story begins… It’s hard to lead you any further without giving away too much.
What a waste, she thought, her eyes straying back to Dallie - putting a face like that on an ignorant hillbilly.
One of the things that I loved most about the story was Francesca’s strength of will.

Fancy Pants is the best unexpected surprise I've gotten so far this year! I was extremely reluctant about starting this book, and I probably wouldn't have even given it a try if it hadn't been for  Anzu's review  the fact that I had it as a group read. In a nutshell, this is basically what this book meant to me:  +   +   +   =  This book made me feel every different kind of emotion, from angry to love to joy to frustration to shock, and everything in between.

This book made me feel every different kind of emotion, from angry to love to joy to frustration to shock, and everything in between.
I started out hating Francie and ended with her as one of the most inspirational and wonderful characters I've ever had the pleasure of getting to know.
I started with loving Dallie, then hating him, and then pitying him.
I ended with liking him, but all my love for this book's cast is reserved solely for Francie.
Since I loved this book so much, I can't wait to get started on some of her more popular stuff!
I felt like I already knew D & F from the later books, so for me seeing them as their young and love struck persona's was not to be skipped.Unfortunately, the time line in Fancy Pants goes back and forth from past to present and tells many additional stories, not just Dallas and Francesca.
We also suffer through a waaaaaaaaaaay TMI story of how Dallas met his first wife, and later a side romance story between his ex and a wacko political activist.
(this was my biggest complaint) And yes, there were a lot of characters to introduce and long stretches of random tangents to endure.
However, when all was said and done, SEP had me so invested in all of the characters that I couldn't help but love the book.
There were times in which I didn't even like any single person involved in the story, but I think that was part of it's charmNow, feminists put on your Femi-Nazi shades because this is a book written in the time of the reluctant chauvinists.
Just a heads up there.Great book, great story.
Nuestra reseña en A la cama con... un libro Menos mal que SEP fue mejorando!
I loved the old family sagas on TV, like Dallas.
Generations of family and all their blissful daily problems and joys.
This family had generations of ups, soaring to the highest peaks and bone crushing defeats and plenty of the in-between moments.The main part of the story focuses on Francisca and Dallie, two complete opposites thrown together by desperation one night.
Dallie, messed up with some serious back ground problems was a true man when it counted.
These characters were so richly written I felt like I'd known them for years.I want more from this world.
Fancy Pants is the first installment in Susan Elizabeth Phillips's adult contemporary romance series titled: Wynette, Texas.
Whoop Whoop!The Wynette, Texas series is some of Ms. Phillips' earlier work and if Fancy Pants is any indication, she has since perfected her signature writing style.
The romance was sexy, even though the love/hate banter was pretty extreme (on the hate side), and there is an admirable message portrayed through the female lead: Francesca “Fancy Pants” Day. No matter our looks, family wealth, or social status, there will come a time when those things will no longer serve us and we will have to make our own way.
*2'5*Pfff, este libro me gustó más que el anterior, tuvo momentos más graciosos aún asi me resultó bastante pesada la lectura y por momentos más pesada todavía.
Nothing like the Susan Elizabeth Phillips books I’ve read so far.
But then I got to know him a lot better and I ended up hating his guts.
How can I hate his guts when he looks like that?
How the hell did I end up liking that bimbo??
So you can imagine I was like “Must...not...feel...bad...for....evil...Francesca....” *a scene where she has to clean toilets* ”Aaaawwwww Francesca poor thing!!!!!”It felt nice growing up with Francesca.
I got to hate her, admire her and in the end love her.
I even ended up liking Holly Grace.
I like her books to be a bit lighter than this.
Review written June 2, 20174.4 Stars - Yay, as good as most of SEP's contemporary romances (here with a fabulous talented audio narrator)Book #1Fancy Pants from my favorite m/f CR author Susan Elizabeth Phillips was first published already 1989.
As usual, immensely great narrated by the very best SEP novels narrator, Anna Fields.
Stopping could lead to the biggest mistake, or best time, ever.
ABSOLUTELY GREAT BOOK TIME.
I just want more of these Wynette, Texas books soon.********************************************** I LIKE - every time I'm clever enough to choose another hilarious fun, smart and witty SEP romance as a audiobook listening
The back story reminded me very much of a Danielle Steel novel but it did serve the purpose of explaining why the heroine of the book was such a self-centered, helpless brat (sorry but its true).When gorgeous socialite Francesca loses everything she's forced into lowering herself by accepting an acting job which she believes will be glamorous and make her into an instant star.
I have to credit the author here because she did an amazing job of turning a thoroughly unlikable character into a admirable person.I can't say this was my favorite book by Susan Elizabeth Phillips because it was too damn long and I wasn't thrilled by half of it.
There was no need for us to know each designer piece of clothing Francesca or Holly Grace were wearing.I hated the characters.
I hated the hero.
I hated the side characters, although Holly Grace was kickass.
You might ask yourself why on earth did I the continue reading this book if I hated it so much?
The stories this woman creates, they grip you and won't let you go until you've read them.
You'll either love them or hate them, but you won't be able to put them down.
It was an ok read, well written but didn't float my boat!- Too many side stories going on.- Didn't like Francesca.- Didn't like Daliie.- Disappointed in the way Dallie treated Teddy when he found out about him - Taking his anger out on the child was not fair.- Dallie & Francesca hardly spent any time together. Didn't feel any connection/romance between them.- Really liked Teddy.- Found myself cheering Dallie on in the golf tournament.- Only continued with this book as written by SEP.Hoping the next one is more to my taste.
si digo que me ha encantado... me quedo corta
This was FABULOUS!!
Già allora la SEP scriveva molto bene, su questo non c'è dubbio, ma, come è giusto che sia, nel corso degli anni il suo stile è cambiato, si è evoluto e modernizzato, e per quanto mi riguarda è migliorato moltissimo in quanto ad emozioni e simpatia dei personaggi.
Sicuramente una delle parti che ho preferito di questo libro è stata conoscere il piccolo Ted Beaudine, uno dei protagonisti maschili della Phillips che ho amato di più (protagonista de “Una Scelta Impossibile”).Lettura consigliata a chi ama la SEP e vuole sperimentare la sua penna nella prima fase della sua carriera di autrice!
It’s certainly a product of it’s time.
That said - I kind of loved it.
I loved how hard parts of it were to read.
I loved how much I hated Dallie for like 90% of the book.
And how much I hated Francesca for at least 40%.
I loved the moment I didn’t hate Francesca at all anymore.
This was a tough read.
The first half of the book is painful.
It took me some time to get into it.
Dallie also hit Francesca.
I don’t think this is a book for everyone.
But clearly it’s a book for me.
2.5 starsI am crushed that I have to rate a SEP book this low. I just didn't like either H or h much in this one. I kept hoping I would eventually love this book, but no. Don't get me wrong, everything works out and the kind of become likeable - but too late. Just ok and I'm sad about it.
She had a baby by Dallie Beaudine, a man that was a bit of a mess and sometimes a jerk, and didn’t tell him for 10 years.
I was so furious with the character I couldn’t even read pass that.Dallie Beaudine had lost his first child, just 2 years old, in a terrible accident and Francesca Day robbed him of 10 years of his second child’s life.
The book goes through chapters explaining how Holly and Dallie are so close (a very weird relationship) but she just accepts the story and become friends with Francesca with no question and not telling a man she claims to love.
This is how our hero Dallas "Dallie" Beaudine first meets her.I usually love SEP books but in this book the characters are not all that endearing: our heroine is obsessed with her looks, money, and success (
), and our hero is obsessed with bimbos and failure.
He neglects to tell her he's married (
yes, he was married when Francesca and Dallie had an affair!
); she neglects to tell him she had his son.
The background story was way too long and boring to read.
Why bother to tell their entire story?
Para sıkıntısı ile başetmeye çalışırken, film çekimi icin Amerikalara kadar gidiyor.
Dallie ise yakışıklı ve bir o kadar da ünlü golf oyuncumuz.
Dallie aslinda cok yetenekli olmasina ragmem bir türlü büyük turnuvalari kazanamayan bir arkadaşımız.
İkilimiz yakınlaşıyor, Francesca Dallie'ye asik olduguna inanıyor ama büyük bir sıkıntı ve şok ortaya çıkınca.
10 yıl kadar sonra ise Francesca başarılı bir tv yüzü.
Dallie Francesca'nin basarisini ve oglunu biliyor çünkü ortak bir şok olacağınız arkadaşları var.
Ogrendigi zaman isler yeniden çığırından çıkıyor😂 buradan sonrasi ise Teddy ve Dallie'nin baba ogul olma çabaları ve Dallie'nin Francesca'nin kalbini calma çabaları uzerine gidiyor.
Bu yüzden kafa dağıtmak istediğimde, canım romantik komedi bir film izlemek isteyip de kararsız kaldığımda hemen onun kitapları can simidim olurlar👍 Burada yazara ve kitaplarına methiyeler dizebilirim ama Bayan Ukala ne yazık ki SEP'in çıtasının aşağısında kaldı.
Kitabın yazıldığı tarih göz önüne alınırsa acımasız olmamak gerekir ama dediğim gibi yazarın kalemine aşina olanlar bu kitabı bir parça yadırgayacaklardır.Neden mi?
Çünkü bana göre yazar anlatımını çok dağıtmıştı.
Çok fazla yan karakterleri detaylandırmıştı.
Dur biraz şunu biraz da şunu anlatayım, gibi bir hava vardı genel itibariyle.
Yine de SEP'in en kötü kitabı bile tür içinde sıyrılır.
Siento decir que este libro ha sido una decepción, con un planteamiento muy made in SEP de los que me gustan se ha convertido en un despropósitos importante, con reacciones demasiado ridículas e irreales.
Balayı ve Taşbebek tarzı bu kitap da. Güzel elbette ama öyle çok eğlenceli bir şeyler beklemeyin...
И този път С. Е. Филипс не ме разочарова. Книгата ми хареса страшно много. Цялото ревю тук http://booumouse.blogspot.bg/2017/07/...
