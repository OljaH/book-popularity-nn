These seven short stories offer us an interesting glimpse of Macdonald polishing his craft in the magazine trade.
Even the earliest stories included here are professional and well-made, but I get the feeling that smaller forms--even the novella, one of which ("The Bearded Lady") is included here--were not ideal for a Lew Archer tale.
Archer is at his best investigating the past and its present consequences, and the past demands a certain length to tell its story.
Still, they are Lew Archer stories.
And second-rate Archer is good enough for me.
Several people recommended Ross Macdonald's Lew Archer series as the ones coming very close to Raymond Chandler's writing quality.
Corrupt cops, a femme fatale, mobsters and their henchmen, big gunfights, a cynical hero with a heart of gold getting knocked out by a blow on his head - all of these and more are here.
I cannot help comparing Lew Archer to Philip Marlowe as the letter is the sample against whom everything else is measured.
it got me thinking about having a job where you come into contact with people at pretty much the worst time in their lives, and then when things are kind of cleaned up, you sail away.
I liked Lew almost as much as Philip Marlowe, and I thought it was fun that he spends some time in San Diego (where I live now; I lived in Los Angeles when I was reading Raymond Chandler -- it's cool to hear about what these places that I know were like, years and years ago).
at times the set-up is a bit far-fetched, but there are some interesting characters and the resolutions are pretty satisfying.
Some great little stories and some not so great. However, despite some ridiculous far fetched plots that are so unlikely it's laughable , the spare stripped down prose is superb . Archer is a great character . This book of shorts gave me an intro to Ross macdonald's iconic hero and I have acquired five more full length archer novels which I hope will be less convoluted than these short stories .
Collection of short stories a couple of which pre-date the first Archer novel. They're generally worth reading, but MacDonald didn't make his reputation on the strength of his short fiction. The plots are OK. And the dialogue is generally fine. But the penchant for the bad-guy to enter in to a long confession at the end of each story is tiresome and silly.
This book is proof to the mastery of MacDonald's talent.
Within these pages are a dozen or so short stories chronicling a few cases taken by the great detective protagonist Lew Archer.
What MacDonald usually accomplishes in 200 lean pages, he triumphs at executing in 20.
It is amazing that in just a short amount of lines, he can get the reader knee deep in a mystery, still throw in a few twists, then escape the other side with a great ending.
During my hard-boiled period (i.e. whenI was going through Dashiell Hammett and Raymond Chandler, like there would be notomorrow) I had managed to procure an old copy of this book. And yes, compared to "The Galton Case" or "The Chill", these stories are rough & rushed. However, some unforgettable lines, a narrative that's so crisp that you can cut yourself with it, and the character of Lew Archer ought to be sufficient for you to pick up this book, or its later expanded version (The Archer Files).
This hardboiled multi-story collection featuring private eye Lew Archer is an almost "what's what" in gumshoe plot devices. While some stories work better than others in my opinion even the weakest can be viewed as good or passable. The prose is poetic with some smart writing (including a twist ending in the story "The Sinster Habit" that I honestly didn't see coming but made perfect sense when I re-read it)that shows that solid story telling has no timeframe or expiration date.
Dead-eyed toughs and dangerous dames, mobsters and moghuls abound in this marvy little collection of tales, in which Lew Archer makes good (Marlowe style!) not once but seven times. "Guilt Edged Blonde" is the only real clunker in the bunch, and even that slides by on sheer attitude. Not for those seeking depth, but there's nothing better for atmosphere.
Some top-draw short stuff from the Master. Even the ostensibly 'weaker' ones packed a helluva punch. That's how good the damned sonofagun was!!
These short, punchy mysteries (usually revolving around some adultery or other) are a great way to get out of a reading slump.
But the gun was an inhibiting factor."The Name is Archer is an early collection of Ross Macdonald's (the pen name of Kenneth Millar) short stories.
Tom Nolan in his great Ross Macdonald: A Biography explains the origins of this collection: in the summer of 1954 Bantam Books "made a deal for a collection of Lew Archer short stories.
Mr. Millar has not yet found his voice, which will be so unique and powerful in his future works.In the first story, Find the Woman, which is set in the mid-to-late 1940s, Archer has just been released from the army, and is in his second day on the private eye job.
I even enjoyed "The Sinister Habit" and "Wild Goose Chase," though they were my least favorite, and likely only because they had the misfortune of coming at the end of the book and paled in comparison to the stories that preceded it.
Once you got involved and invested in the characters the story was suddenly over.I bought this book on a whim in a used book store, drawn to it by the title--The Name is Archer.
The seven stories allowed me to warm up to the character and see him in different situations and settings (as well as see his development over a decade).
Out of the two post-war heirs to Raymond Chandler's title as master of the American hardboiled detective novel, it was Mickey Spillane who conquered the bestseller lists but Ross Macdonald whom the academic literates embraced.
Macdonald seems to have gone in the complete opposite direction of Spillane by downplaying the trademark sleaze and grit of Hammett and Chandler in favour of introspection and complex moral dilemmas.Another difference which already at this point gives Macdonald his own distinct vibe is that instead of the Great Depression and World War Two, Lew Archer's adventures take place against the backdrop of the immediate post-WW2 economic boom which resulted in one of the most optimistic and prosperous eras in American history.
His paperbacks always had twisted family plots and a solid,rock-like ex-cop named Lew Archer.
The writing was solid, too.
Ross never wasted words.
These early stories show the rawness of his writing.
But the writing still comes through, raw or not.
After this comes theabduction, by helicopter." After years of writing these understated and fascinatingbooks, Ross got discovered and made legitimate.
The New York Times called the Archer series, if memory serves,"the finest series of detective novels ever written by an American." These stories have violence and gunplay in them.
But they also have Archer.
And Archer develops in these tales.

The Name Is Archer is a collection of Macdonald's earliest Lew Archer stories.
The Archer series ranks with Chandler's Phillip Marlow series as some of the best American detective series.
The collection of seven stories range from good to very good.
A few end a bit too abruptly (though that's something that's true of most mysteries of that period -- when the case was over, the story ended), but the best of them are compelling, with examinations of the characters.
Most also deal with themes Macdonald would examine in far more depth later in his career, involving complex, failed relationships.
Enjoyable collection, but I'm still not on board the Ross Macdonald train.
I can see that he's admired because he has a decent vocabulary and drops in high art references, but I fear the brow is still up around the middle of the head.
Doesn't have the resonance and power and sticks in your brain moments like Highsmith, Chandler, Hammett, Thompson.
And, whew, most stories have some real humdinger matter-of-fact misogyny moments.
He loves to compare women to birds of prey.
And of course there are many humans comparable to beasts and birds of prey, but they way he writes it it comes across as part of a woman's DNA.
Macdonald's wheelhouse is to mine the depths of his characters' motivations by means of an intricately constructed plot. The short story format doesn't really give him an opportunity to do this, so what we're left with is Macdonald's trademark sparse yet devastatingly effective prose. The mysteries themselves run the gamut - a couple are excellent, a couple are decent, the rest just so-so. Entertaining, but I'd suggest reading the full novels first if you're just getting into Macdonald. The Name is Archer is more for completists.
The Name is Archer (1955—stories probably previously published between 1946 and 1954) These six stories are printed under the name John Ross Macdonald, who changed his pen name to Ross MacDonald, probably so as not to be confused with John D. MacDonald. These are models for short mysteries, hokey with all the bodies piliing up, of course, but you can see Lew Archer’s character developing. It is hard to differentiate the early Archer from Phillip Marlowe.
There was Sam Spade; then, there was Phillip Marlowe, thenthere was Lew ArcherDash HammettRaymond ChandlerRoss McDonaldThese are the founders of what we have come to expect of the American P.I.This book is not the best Lew Archer but it is a good collection of short stories of how Archer starts his work after WW II in Los Angeles.Entertaining
Classic detective fiction, but not good detective fiction. Hammy dialog, and secondary characters confessing to murders in the last 2 paragraphs typifies this collection of short stories. For the best in the genre, read Hammett or Chandler. For two-fisted action with hammy dialog, stick to Spillane.
I gave stars to each story separately and then averaged them: Find the Woman - ***Gone Girl - *****The Bearded Lady - *****The Suicide - *****Guilt-Edged Blonde - ****The Sinister Habit - *****Wildgoose Chase - *****Midnight Blue - ****Sleeping Dog - ***
This is a collection of Lew Archer stories from 1955. Archer is the prototypical hard-boiled private eye and brings all the suspense, violence, sex and literary flourishes you'd expect from the best of this genre. I would recommend this book to any mystery lover or fan of hardboiled fiction.
a wonderful collection of stories features Ross MacDonald's world weary detective. more sensitive than Marlowe but tougher than Spade Lew Archer bridged the gap between post-war nihilism and modern malaise.
Film noir influenced private detective stories, meaning it's almost surprising when the client DIDN'T do it. Archer was the best of the later tough-guy private detectives.
A fantastically complex set of mysteries with a likeable main character
If you didn't know it, you'd think it was Chandler. This collection is a good introduction to this fine noirish author.
Solid noir potboilers with some well turned phrases and dialogue. Predictable after a while.
Terrific so far. Lew Archer is a great pal to have at your hip, and 50's LA--actually written in 50's LA!--is a tireless setting.
