I am a simple girl.I see Brandon Sanderson...I buy.
Even though I already had the book, I'm impressed a Brandon Sanderson book was in my November Fairyloot!! Click the link under the picture to see the goods. I think I left out a picture of one of the cards! sigh....THE GOODSI had so many things I wanted to say for this review but I have nothing right now! I have cried sad and happy tears. I have loved many. Go read the damn book people! It's Brandon Sanderson! What more needs to be said?Happy Reading! Mel 🖤🐶🐺🐾
“You get to choose who you are. Legacy, memories of the past, can serve us well. But we cannot let them define us. When heritage becomes a box instead of an inspiration, it has gone too far.”  Skyward is the start of a brand-new YA Sci-Fi series by Brandon Sanderson. You all know that I love Brandon Sanderson’s work, especially The Stormlight Archive and Mistborn, and I knew I couldn’t let this new release pass me by without immediately reading. And, friends, this was nothing short of a treat.
This book follows a young girl named Spensa, who wants nothing more than to follow in her father’s footsteps of being a space pilot and defending her home planet from an alien race called the Krell, who are relentless in their attacking.
Okay, so even though I loved this reading experience so much, and I truly think Brandon Sanderson comes up with the best worlds in SFF, two things bothered me about this book.
I actually was feeling really slumpy before I picked this up, and not only did it rectify that, but it reminded me why I love books and stories and fictional worlds so much.
Aside from avoiding info-dumping, this also lends an air of mystery to the history of the planet, its inhabitants and their lifelong war, but at the same time is not too obscure as to frustrate the reader.The story is written mainly in the first-person POV of Spensa - an angry young lady with a lot to prove and hence had quite an attitude problem and a propensity to act like an idiot sometimes.
Let's just ignore that for a moment.THIS is the quintessential Top Gun meets the Last Starfighter, complete with a girl pilot with a huge chip on her shoulder, a lot of growth to be had, a mysterious AI starship she's caring for while undergoing training, and KILLER dogfights.Did I cry a little as the cadets started dying or being pulled from the classes by freaked out parents?
Yes. Did I have an INSANE amount of fun reading this?YES.Hell, I'm already devoted to this man's fantasy.
I just never guessed, although I SHOULD HAVE GUESSED, that Sanderson's Law was always a great means to bring understandable science-like laws to the field of Fantasy, but COME ON...
Star Wars training academy sort of story!Final review, first posted on Fantasy Literature:Brandon Sanderson’s new young adult science fiction novel, Skyward, replaces his intricately detailed fantasy magical systems with equally detailed dogfights between one-person starship fighters of the humans living on the planet Detritus (it’s as bleak as it sounds) and the starships of the alien Krell.
Most of the time in between is spent with training in the semi-military space pilot school for Spensa and her group of ten eighteen-year-old classmates, and with frequent individual spacecraft battles with the Krell aliens.
And even though she had a time we’re she overthought thinks, where she had insecurities, she soon realized that you can’t be afraid of a thing you don’t know for certain.
My favorite character was probably M-Bot. He was be cutest, funniest and weirdest thing I have read about in a long time.He kind of reminded me of Aidan, but In a cute innocent cinnamon roll way.
But the war never ended.Like I said, I’m not a fan of sci-fi.
Relationships 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟You know what I really really love in books?
I mean, this is an author that can do no wrong in my eyes. When every book you read of his is a 5 star read, you reach for perfection and perfection is what you get with him. I'm so damn happy we're getting a book release from him this year. 😍
EDIT: The book dropped a few days ago, everyone needs to go read it ASAP, you won't regret it!!*AS MANY STARS AS THERE ARE DEBRIS IN THE RUBBLE BELT*Okay, let me start off with this: I live for Spensa.
What I will say is that I would have given this 5 stars for Spensa alone.
But throw a precious, sassy and funny sidekick, a band of awesome and loyal flightmates and some seriously kickass airfights into the mix and we’ve got ourselves a masterpiece!This was my first ever Brandon Sanderson book, and I’m kicking myself for not having picked up any of his other books earlier if they’re all going to be this good!
a girl pilot and her AI-driven sidekick ship teaming up to battle aliens? this sounds so good and if it ends up disappointing me, I will personally use my last €€ to travel to Sanderson's house, knock on his door and....BURST INTO TEARS
Skyward has all the hallmarks of a Sanderson story: mysterious prologue, likeable protagonists, curious past civilizations, new technologies, and the looming threat of a warring race.
It’s always a pleasure spending time inside Brandon’s mind as he creates a new playground of rules and takes his characters for a ride through unchartered territories.I won’t say much about him, but I LOVED M-Bot. He’s such an interesting character and honest to god funny.
Identity can be defined by how some human characters act and think, but this also applies to an AI struggling to determine whether it can create new ideas on its own.
This was a fun read and I enjoyed it (it is, after all, Sanderson) but his adult novels are what truly get my pulse racing. Wand what cemented my love for him in the first place.
I was lucky enough to be provided an ARC from the publisher, Gollancz, via Netgalley in exchange for an honest review. Thank you so much for giving me the opportunity.Rating: 4.5 stars Brandon Sanderson shoots for the stars in Skyward, the first entry of his sci-fi adventure, and absolutely aces the takeoff.  Is there anything better than a new book release from your favourite author?Ok, I have to admit though. I am not a huge fan of sci-fi books, and as such avoid them where possible. I will ho
I will however make exceptions for my favourite authors, and Brandon Sanderson is right at the pinnacle of that list.
A few frantic reading sessions later I can excitedly confirm, the master of fantasy, Brandon Sanderson, has brought his particular brand of AWESOMENESS to the sci-fi genre as well.Spensa (callsign: Spin) dreams of being a starfighter pilot for the Defiant Defense Force.
She has studied for years to make her dream come true and knows every possible answer that she may need to pass the flight school test that ensures admittance to the pilot training program.
Spensa and her mother and gran have gone from the family of an esteemed pilot to the outcasts and she has a hard time making friends and being allowed basic human courtesies.Some of the things I most enjoyed about this were the way that the fight scenes (something I almost always dislike) actually felt really immediate and fun.
I definitely think Sanderson has managed to write a book that is pretty lengthy, but it feels very easy to read once again and I whizzed through it enjoying learning about the life the humans lead and the battles they fight daily.On the whole, a very dramatic story with a lot of happy and sad moments and a few surprises too.
This review was originally posted on Books of My Heart   “That music the water makes,” she said. “Isn’t it the most wonderful sound ever?”“The most wonderful sound ever is the lamentations of my enemies, screaming my name toward the heavens with ragged, dying voices.”   Bless My Stars this was fantastic! You know how you are going along in your life thinking that most of the stuff you are reading is good, and it is, but then you read something and it makes everything else seem dull by compariso
Sure, I’m hoping long term we are warming up and there will be a romance but SCUD it, I’ll be okay if there isn’t one, you can *gasp* in amazement now.So you probably want to know why this is in my TOP 3 books for 2018 at the moment.:First there is the MC Spensa a.k.a. spin.
Still I loved getting to know all of them and each brought something special to the story.Fourth is M-bot, I know I mentioned him above (talking ship) but I think that I highlighted almost everything M-bot said in this book.
Like all Sanderson stories it had a nice mix of action, humor, mystery, and surprise twists and turns that kept it an engaging read.
Skyward might be no Way of Kings but it was a lot more exciting and fun than 99% of the other stuff I've been reading lately so I'm not going to get caught up in rating this lower because it is not peak Cosmere stuff.
Things take a fun twist for her when she stumbles across a mysterious wrecked ship.
Spensa was not my favourite Sanderson character but she was, mostly, easy to root for despite her flaws.
3.75/5 stars “Tremble and fear, all enemies!” he shouted. “For we shall shake the air with thunder and blood! Your doom is imminent!”Let's talk about this gorgeous cover. Gorgeous, but very misleading. Because from the cover it looks like a main character might be, ohh I don't know a 25 year old woman, while in reality Spensa is a 17 year old who acts as if she were 12 most of the time. The whole book is very juvenile, really. In fact it reads more juvenile than The Rithmatist did, so while this
Because from the cover it looks like a main character might be, ohh I don't know a 25 year old woman, while in reality Spensa is a 17 year old who acts as if she were 12 most of the time.
In fact it reads more juvenile than The Rithmatist did, so while this is marketed as young adult it's definitely more on par with books like Percy Jackson.
To me this book, while great in its own way, feels like a very watered down version of what Sanderson can actually do.
It's also fast paced with almost no world building.I don't really mind that it wasn't very umm sciency but I do like when things make sense and that's actually my biggest problem with the book.The characters were nice.
My favorite character tho is Rig and I so wanted more of him, he was a loyal and just an all amazing friend from beginning to end and I'm sad that this book didn't focus on that.The other character were all okay, I don't hate any of them particularly but also love is a strong word that I can't use to describe my feelings for them.The writing was good, and as always I liked how Sanderson does his fight scenes.
La muerte nos trata a todos como iguales".Creo que nunca me había devorado tan rápido un libro, ¡la historia que Sanderson contó aquí me atrapó por completo y la amé!
Y es que, normalmente, no soy muy de historias en el espacio, naves y pilotos, pero Escuadrón me hizo querer ser parte de este mundo y convertirme en una piloto y combatir a los krells.
Así que estas personas han armado sus vidas bajo la superficie desarrollando muchos tipos de trabajo pero, sobre todo, entrenando a pilotos expertos que ayuden a combatir a los krells.
“We must not cower in the dark because we’re  afraid of the spark within us.”Shipping Jorgensa!
“The answer is not to put the spark out...”5 whole ✨...are not enough to classify Spensa!
Not gonna lie, the man’s the writing Spin (ha!
See what I did there!) “But to learn to control it.” If you haven’t bought this book, you missed the boat!
If you’re not reading this book, you’re missing the boat!
Add it to your tbr before that boat passes you by!
Not gonna lie the battlefield’s a Nedder, but it’s worth a Chaser!
Claim the stars ✨ OH MY GOD GUYS! This book was amazing and so much more than I was expecting. The characters are all so well written and the world and ughhhhhhh everything about this was spectacular! And inspiring! I love M-Bot and Spensa and Jorgen I can’t wait to see what Brandon Sanderson has planned for Starsight!!
“I’m going to strap in, and I’m going to fight. That way when I die, at least I’ll die in a cockpit. Reaching for heaven.”  Brandon Sanderson is my favorite fantasy author and once again he has shown why with this fantastic sci-fi YA novel. I’m a huge sci-fi fan and Sanderson once again blew me away with his AMAZING and BEAUTIFUL writing and his absolutely BRILLIANT imagination.    “You watch yourself,” I said, wishing I had something to stand on to bring my eyes level with his. “When you are b
Brandon Sanderson is my favorite fantasy author and once again he has shown why with this fantastic sci-fi YA novel.
I’m a huge sci-fi fan and Sanderson once again blew me away with his AMAZING and BEAUTIFUL writing and his absolutely BRILLIANT imagination.
There was so many things to love about this book: Spensa aka Spin, who is just fantastic with her bloodthirsty nature and her determination to have her dream of being a pilot become true despite the numerous obstacles in her way; a geeky best friend and some very interesting fellow classmates; a very adorable pet and the very best thing…… a talking SHIP, M-bot, who totally stole the show for me :-D !!!!
I loved Skyward with my whole heart. I can always count on Sanderson to create wholly unique worlds, filled with magic, wacky and endearing characters, and pulsating action sequences that leave you on the edge of your seat. This is not one to be missed my friends, it is a thoroughly entertaining read that will give you all the feels.
This is one of the more interesting themes explored by Brandon Sanderson’s new sci-fi epic Skyward: Claim the Stars, book one of the Skyward series.
Skyward has all the hallmarks of a Sanderson story: mysterious prologue, likeable protagonists, curious past civilizations, new technologies, and the looming threat of a warring race.
It’s always a pleasure spending time inside Brandon’s mind as he creates a new playground of rules and takes his characters for a ride through unchartered territories.In addition to some of the themes discussed above, this story also explores the nature of identity, both human and artificial.
I would also like to note that I really, really want this review to be good, but I kind of feel like my life is over after reading this all day and I don’t think I really have the words to explain how amazing this book is.So, for those who don’t want to read the long version-if you want an action packed, un-putdownable, exciting, emotional and very, very well written adventure,  pick this book up.
The progression was perfectly paced, the world building was incredible for a first book in a series, and one that isn’t that long at that and Sanderson never shied away from making things hard for his characters.
In fact, Skyward is the first of his new YA project, after the conclusion of the Reckoners trilogy with Calamity, and while I know some were a bit bummed this was not the Apocalypse Guard, I think spirits will be lifted again once the sheer awesomeness of this one starts to spread.In a word, Skyward soars.Teenager Spensa has always grown up in her father’s shadow, though in her world, it is not so rare for the descendants of First Citizens families to feel outshined by the heroic achievements of their elders in the Battle of Alta—the battle in which forty pilots for the Defiant Defense Force protected their planet Detritus from the alien Krell attack.
Rating:  4.8/5 (rounded up to a full five!)🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟Why did this book have to end?! We were having such a great time! I want the sequel nooww! 😫🙈Okay, tantrum over for now. 😂What a FUN read! I was nervous before reading it because it’s sci fi (which doesn’t always work for me) but also by my favorite author — but I will never doubt again! The book is kind of loosely inspired by How to Train Your Dragon (one of my favorite movies ever) but in space — and it delivered that and more! But it’s amazing
But this is more like military training - and the action starts getting suspenseful and intense very early on in the book!And as fun as the story is, it’s also emotional and explores the consequences of living in that harsh world, of fighting for your life and your friends, and what it means to Spensa to prove her worth.And the twists and revelations!
I loved it but it’s deliberately mysterious at first - these people don’t know all of the answers to why and how they ended up where they are.
Because the book ended on a high, and I want to know what happens next in this world and for these characters!
This book was flat out awesome!!
It was totally action packed and I loved the characters.
I was held in suspense about what was going to happen and at times I couldn’t put the book down.
It was so well written and the characters were so well developed that if something happened to them, I was really upset.
Spensa’s struggles became important to me and I cheered her on through her journey.
The ending just about gave me whiplash, so watch out when you reach that last 20%, it’s super hard to put down.
I can’t wait for the next in the series to come out!!!
To be honest, I was expecting more.The pacing was really good, in my opinion.
I never felt bored, even though I would say this is a slow book which I love.
She learns and grows so much on this book and I can't wait to see what will happen in the next book.M-Bot was unexpected!
I found myself laughing out loud when M-Bot was speaking!It didn't blow me away but it was an awesome story!
I couldn't stop reading!I hope this book is the start of an awesome series because it has so much potential.I can't find anything wrong with this book, I just wanted more.CLAIM THE STARS
I wanted to write this review right away, but I thought that it would be better to let the book sink in a bit before I wrote the review.
To put it simply, this book is about Spensa, a 16-year old girl who lives on this planet called Detritus.
Ever since she was little, Spensa wanted to become a pilot.
This story is about Spensa trying to become a pilot, learning more about herself, and her father.
General Thoughts  Right after I finished this book, I wanted to read it again.
