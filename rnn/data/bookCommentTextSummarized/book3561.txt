I really enjoyed preparing this old, out-of-print book for reprinting.
It is a terrific debut mystery for John Stephen Strange, set in 1926 New York City.
Detective Van Dusen Ormsberry is a dapper, clever detective, and his protegee, Billy Adams, is a lovable boy detective wannabe.
The victim in this mystery is a Crime Writer himself, but what was he writing about that may have lead to his murder on the top of an omnibus?
This title was one of the first recommendations of the newly created Crime Club in 1928, and Fans of the Golden Age of Detective Fiction should really enjoy this first of Strange's 22 mystery novels.
Solid murder mystery from the time period. This means not so many clues but following the details of what people did and saw and said for alibis and the like. Once the sifting of details became focused then the finding of specific clues became important. Fun characters, some stock but fleshed out well.The main police detective in this is - Ormsberry. I must have a first edition since the book is has the author's pseudonym on the cover as the author.
The man who killed Fortescue by John Stephen Strange is a Detective Ormsberry novel originally published in 1928. A reporter and crime writer is murdered just as he is about to publish a book looking into the death of a man called Fortescue. A solid detective novel, it was an interesting read. Not as good as an Agatha Christie though.
I thoroughly enjoyed reading this mystery set in New York in the 1920's. It is a picture of the language and culture of time period, and a satisfying mystery as well. Detective Van Dusen Ormsberry is a great character with something to prove by solving this case, and his side kick "The Admiral" is delightful. This book is a great read!
