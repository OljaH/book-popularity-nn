I definitely feel this novel would appeal to non-superhero fans who are still intrigued by the concept of supernatural abilities.I LOVED the characters in this story.
I found most of characters to be interesting and complex.I REALLY enjoyed the slight romance in this story, more than I have regarding YA books in a while.
The story is definitely centered on the dynamics between Renegades and Anarchists, with romance being one of the least important parts of the plot in my opinion.
The thing is, the Anarchists and the "good guys" the Renegades both have bad people in their groups and good people.
Captain Chromium himself had promised that no harm would come to him or his family, but only so long as he stopped making weapons for their enemies.
Just reading the part when Nova's family was being killed was horrible.
***END OF SPOILERS!!!***So one day Nova is on an Anarchists mission to take out one of the Renegade leaders.
You can meet him in the book üòäOne of the Anarchists pushes Nova to become a Renegade and find out how to take them down.
The orphaned Nova, however, feels they are the reason her parents were murdered and so she teams up with the other side - the Anarchists - in order to overthrow the Renegades.It was almost unreadable at first, with the cliche dialogue making it seem as if the characters were reading off the script for the latest superhero movie:
The Sentinel is a mysterious new superhero who claims he is a Renegade and Adrian suddenly disappears every time he‚Äôs around.
We are told his identity in the beginning.)It's a long book for YA and it feels even longer.
There were like two characters who would‚Äôve made this book a lot better but none of them were given enough backstory or enough page time..Honestly, I think the main problem is that when I think about this book‚Ä¶I don‚Äôt feel anything.
The Anarchists are the supervillains in this case, and of course like any other superhero comic/book/movie, they're actually the ones with a vision for the world.
But what's absolutely unrefined WILD to me, however, is that no one, NOT ONE SINGLE CHARACTER, was able to come across two brain cells to rub together and figure out that Adrian was the Sentinel and that Nova was Nightmare.
Not as in ‚Äúnot wet.‚Äù Hopefully all pages are Dry City, USA in that sense.)The second pacing thing: this felt like 1.5 books.
I can pick an exact moment around 350 pages in that felt like a perfect stopping point, but this bad boy just...trucks on.
At a lot of moments this just felt like every entry into the superhero genre tossed in a blender with every YA fantasy of the last five years.And that‚Äôs really lame.Luckily, we left the good stuff to cheer ourselves up!!THE GOODEven though this was unoriginal, it still managed to be...kind of fun?
I feel like a linguistic prophet.)Also, I think Marissa Meyer puts forth a good effort in terms of diversity in this book.
‚ÄúHero or villain, all prodigies were powerful. All prodigies were dangerous.‚Äù  Me and Marissa Meyer have an all over the place relationship. I wasn‚Äôt the biggest fan of The Lunar Chronicles, but I love Scarlet and Wolf! But my favorite thing she‚Äôs ever created was Heartless, which I five starred and it made it onto my best of list the year it came out. So, I didn‚Äôt know what to expect going into Renegades. I wasn‚Äôt even going to pick it up originally, but I did solely because I saw a Goodreads
TL;DR - I loved the gay dads, but I only ended up liking Renegades.
And, if you‚Äôve ever read a book by Marissa Meyer before, you can probably guess that a romance happens as well.
I think it‚Äôs important for kids and teens to be reading about questioning the world around them right now, and I really liked the discussion that could be had here from these themes that were presented.
‚ÄúIf people wanted to stand up for themselves or protect their loved ones or do what they believe in their hearts is the right thing to do, then they would do it.
A NEW MARISSA MEYER TRILOGYSUPERHEROES, VIGILANTES, VILLAINS, CRIMEYES YES YES YES
Super fun and unique, while still throwing nods at other stories.Before I say anything else, a big thank you to the publishers for sending me an ARC in exchange for an honest review!Basically, this is a world where prodigies (people with special abilities) used to be oppressed, but a man named Ace Anarchy rose up and fought for their freedom & acceptance.
As I mentioned before, this is like a mashup of all your favorite superhero movies, but at the same time, the story is totally unique and so are the characters.
Ughhh this is one of those books where I'm going to fail miserably at explaining what it's about because I need to use my hands to map out the tangled web of identities and goals...So Nova starts out with the "villain" Anarchists and Adrian is with the superhero Renegades, but Nova eventually goes undercover to try out for the Renegades.
Adrian remembers the gangs that rose to power in the absence of government in the Age of Anarchy and thinks the Renegade's current Council is better, but Nova's definitely there to take them down:
I feel like the amount of expectations I put on this book just made it bound to disappoint me. Like, think about it realistically, how is ANY book ever going to live up to the glory that is Scarlet??You just‚Ä¶can‚Äôt compete with that ya know.My feelings and thoughts summed up:  The Pros - I love me some anti-heroes, give me bad guys with tragic back stories and complex development that make me rethink my entire moral compass - The ending was bloody fantastic, that last sentence left me all !!???!!
Like, think about it realistically, how is ANY book ever going to live up to the glory that is Scarlet??You just‚Ä¶can‚Äôt compete with that ya know.My feelings and thoughts summed up: 
-	It hurts me to have to list cons for marissa meyer bc she is everything I want to be when I grow up but this book was just //not// doing it for me-	I still got hope tho bc I didn‚Äôt like Cinder very much but the rest of the series SLAYED my existence so hopefully she makes a comeback, plz plz plz-	So, the cons-	The book felt like a filler.
In my mind, Marissa Meyer still had Beauty and the Beast, The Little Mermaid, hell The Princess and the Frog, as well as many other fairytales to write entire books about.
She has no idea if her new series will be well-received or completely hated, and yet she still dared to write what she felt was right to her, not what everyone (like me) expected her to.
Meh. But as I mentioned, I was still very interested, because Marissa Meyer knows how to make the reader want more, with small twists and turns hidden at various places inside the storyline, and by making us curious about the future of the characters, whether we're fully invested in them or just a little.
why didn't anyone tell me THIS EXISTED
One week into the new year and I've already finished three books? I'm on a role. Maybe I just developed a new superpower.RTC
The Renegades and The Anarchists don‚Äôt know that he is Sentinal.
Also, this is the scariest power I have ever heard of in my life and I will never ever wish to meet or be Queen Bee.Ruby Tucker | Red AssassinA part of Adrian‚Äôs Renegade Team.
I feel like every story can benefit from their own, personal storm.Hugh Everhart | Captain ChromeonOne of the original Renegades.
She is in charge of her own group at Renegades, but her team doesn‚Äôt seem to be liked very much.
and I got even more curious, intrigued and excited when I nearly reached the ending and to be honest, I cried a little bit while reading this book but I won't talk further about why I cried because I don't want to spoil any of you and now let me tell you about the pacing.I love reading slow-paced books but even though it's slow-paced, the book has to keep me interested and this book did that to me.
( if you want to find out who these characters, just read the book.
PSA: THIS BOOK SUCKED BUT NOT BECAUSE OF THE GAY DADSI don‚Äôt think anything Marissa Meyer writes will ever live up to the series that The Lunar Chronicles was, because this was HORRIBLE in comparison to that.
I felt so disconnected & distracted to actually READ & ENJOY the book, despite trying so hard to love it.Like you know when you‚Äôre lying down on the beach and trying to enjoy the beautiful sunset but you just can‚Äôt stop thinking about how global warming is going to make this part of the ocean flood the entire beach & land and suddenly it‚Äôs all ruined for you??
I hadn‚Äôt even planned on reading this and finished it in three days. It was sooooooo good & fun & dark but also funny at the right times and GREAT! Such a fun spin on the superhero/super villain type of story, and I NEED the next one!

Even though I loved all the characters in this book, I still think they need a little bit more depth.
I loved how Nova saw the world and the people in it.
All prodigies were dangerous.Renegades is actually the first book I've read about superheroes and villains.
There are two organizations in this book: the Renagades (heroes) and the Anarchists (villains).
Maybe Nova's childhood would have been happier if the people around her weren't so passive.I also sided with the Anarchists because there were Renegades who didn't deserve to be called "heroes," in the truest sense of the word.
Marissa Meyer wrote Renegades in such a way that categorizing characters into heroes and villains wasn't as easy as pie.

BUT YOU KNOW HOW SEDUCTIVE BOOKS ARE, RIGHT??
YOU FEEL ME??
Marissa Meyer......................
you better impress me.
Loved it! This book reminded me so much much like the movie Sky High in some aspects. And that ending!? üò± Can't wait to read the next one.
Set aside @ pg 171. I do want to finish this, just not right now.---I'm here for aaaaaaall the gay dads :)---oh my god you guys LOOK AT THIS COVER
do re mi fa so done with this book i had to dnf 90% of the way
4.75I did not expect to love this as much as I did...but it honestly could have been half the length.
second time read and review!I FREAKING LOVE RENEGADES GUYS.
MAYBE!Overall, I can't wait to dive into that beautiful book that is sitting right next to me.
_________________________________________________________It's not weird or anything that I can't wait till I reread this book, right?!I love Marissa Meyer and I was pretty sure that I would love Renegades.Yup, I did.
Yeah, never take me to a book store and say "get whatever you want" you will regret it.Anyways, I loved Marissa's take on superheros - it was a super fun read that I just couldn't put down.
I'd be fucking pissed - like NOVA.
ive read many books about people who have abilities or gifts, but i think this is the first book ive read where they are actually considered superheroes.
like crime fighting superheroes, against villains.
and i will say it felt very cheesy in the beginning, but i got into it.
eventually.
because this is a beast of a book with loads of introspection and description.
so there was a lot of trudging through that had to be done.
but fortunately, things really picked up in the last 200 pages or so.
and because of that, i think the next book is going to be so much better!!
Me ha enganchado much√≠simo desde el principio, y es que siempre me pasa con esta autora, sabe crear inicios incre√≠bles y sabe pegar al lector a las p√°ginas de su libro.
Ha creado una ambientaci√≥n de lujo, donde te sientes dentro c√≥mo de un c√≥mic de X-men, por lo menos es la sensaci√≥n que me ha dado, pero con unos personajes totalmente nuevos y unos poderes que yo no hab√≠a potenciados en ninguna otra historia que haya le√≠do (o visto).
Aunque es cierto que al principio del libro viene un glosario con los personajes, pero a√∫n as√≠ ten√≠a que recurrir bastante a √©l durante las 100 primeras p√°ginas.
3.5 to 4 starsI enjoyed this book, but it was a bit draggy at times.
It felt like it took a long time to make even a little progress.
Also, there is a bit of dystopian in here with many YA tropes, so it may almost be overload!I did enjoy the relationships between characters in the book even though I was not sure they always made sense.
My guess is 1 out of 5 will love it, 3 out of 5 will think it is okay, and the last 1 won't like it at all.
The cover ! Oh my gosh ! I'm shaking.Looks like a comic book, but it's okay.Hell yeah !Superpowers + Marissa MeyerThis year couldn't be better.March on, girls !
"There are many dangerous people in this world. But there are also many good people. Brave people. No matter how bad things get, we have to remember that. So long as there are heroes in this world, there's hope that tomorrow might be better." [insert gif of me attempting to give a fuck]Five months. It took me five months to slog through Renegades. It's just so profoundly boring. I could've wept wishing it'd give me an emotion. Or just half an emotion. I'm not greedy.Renegades tries to sell itse
"There are many dangerous people in this world.
But there are also many good people.
Brave people.
It took me five months to slog through Renegades.
I could've wept wishing it'd give me an emotion.
Or just half an emotion.
I'm not greedy.Renegades tries to sell itself as morally complex with its dual POVs (Nova, the 'evil' Anarchist; and Adrian, the 'good' Renagades), but it fails to break new ground with a genre and topic that has been explored numerous times across literature and film.
Yeah, yeah, not all Renagades are stout-of-heart heroes, and the Anarchists had good intentions.
