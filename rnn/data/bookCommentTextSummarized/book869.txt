Excellent book!Reading James Schultz is a wonderful experience. His descriptions are so vivid that you can easily picture the scenes in your mind as you read. I'm in the process of reading all his work. I definitely recommend!
Lone Bull's Mistake a very good read.It was a joy to be able to read this book. The insight into the Native American way of life and how the family and friends dealt with Lone Bull and not giving up on him and he learning about himself. Very positive.
This1918 book was written by James Shultz, who married and lived among the Pikuni tribe in the 1880’s. He operated a couple of fur trading posts in Montana. The plot is a frame for an adventure around Montana in the early days of outposts and fur trading before the buffalo died. I think this story gave me a better understanding of social expectations and skills among the native americans. I followed up with Mr. Shultz’s recounting of his real life experiences in: ‘My Life as an Indian’.
Love all the books by this writer. I have gained so much knowledge of our first people. I have always been a reader of U.S. History but none of the great history writers and books that I have read addressed all of our history. Reading Mr. Schultz' first hand accounts of native life and customs has been an eye opener.
Good bookBook described in detail the daily life of an Indian. Written so well I felt I was there. Hard to put the book down.
