Very extensive reference of herbs...not ALL herbs but this book was published in 1931. I looked up echinacea and it was about a quarter of a page. I believe if this book was published today there would be more to it.
The materia medicas have been broken into 2 parts, but the full index is available in both versions.
Strangely enough, above the index on each page it doesn't say list of plants, but lists of plates.
Information is not spared on herbs, and each gets at least a page, with tiny text.
Sometimes an old poem or piece from an ancient Materia Medica is given as a treat, such as with Culpeper and Gerard.
Diagrams adorn many pages, in black and white, all helping the old feel appeal.A great choice for reference materials, now considered classics
A modern re-print (unabridged) of the first half of a book on herbs and other plants originally published in 1931. A bit of science (botany, medicine, toxicology and agriculture), a little folklore, a little history, a even few recipes. Interesting, but not something that you'd sit down and read cover-to-cover. On the other hand, after the inevitable zombie apocolypse and after all of the drug stores have been looted this book should really come in handy.
I will definitely be on the hunt for volume two of this set. It has history, lore, medicinal, scientific, etc. Love it!!
Go-to for my entire life.
good with spagyrics and Making PLant Medicines
Volume one and two are required reading and resources in my herbal library. So many plants (and books). Isn't it awe-inspiringly wonderful?!
very helpful in the home, for cooking, spell-craft and medicinal purposes. I've also used it to help plan wedding floral arrangments
