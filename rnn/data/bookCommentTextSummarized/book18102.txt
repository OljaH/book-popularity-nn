It’s been fatal in the past, eventually locking up their bones until they die.This goes on for 500 pages – Trez and her living each day to the fullest, allowing Selena to experience things and do everything romantic, while everyone else scrabbles for a cure.Except then she dies.The heroine of the book, dies.
You don’t give us 600 pages of romance, just to kill the heroine.
And the romance reader is sobbing or angry right along with them – but we have trust that the author will give his or her characters a happy ever after by the end of the book.

But I still think JR Ward has an incredible mind, is a crazy talented author and story teller, and I still feel that The Shadows was more than worthy of it’s 5 star rating.
The Shadows primarily focuses on brothers Trez and iAm, although many secondary characters play a large part as well.
We got to know them in Rhev’s book and then they were in The King quite a bit as well.
I was more excited to read about iAm then I was Trez when I started this book.
iAm proves just how much he would do for Trez in this book.
it became painfully clear to me that (view spoiler)[ when I'm reading to escape and waiting for the happily ever after that’s going to give me hope that true love exists and can overcome any obstacle… I don't want real.
(view spoiler)[ A world where no one expects happily ever afters…  (hide spoiler)]The bottom line…In the real world things can be horrific and unfair and brutally tragic, which is why I read romance - I want to escape the reality that can be ugly when loved ones pass from our lives.
Romance books are supposed to end with a working relationship between the hero and heroine.
Meanwhile, we've got iAm percolating a very second-string romance with a ridiculously predictable outcome, and that is supposed to be satisfying?
It made the character look like he had a personality disorder and then it had no impact on the plot.
I liked where it was going, until he stomped all over it with a hooker.In the end of it all, I was just left tired...

I love you forever.”-TrezI can't say I am shocked that J.R. Ward killed off Selena even before I read all the spoilers.
Personally, Rhage had always thought the poor bastard was suffering from Phury Syndrome a condition whereupon one brother was so fucked-up that the other fell into a black hole trying to save him.” As anyone who reads the BDB knows there are lots of side stories going on in each book, almost like a on going soap opera.
So Xcor is going to have to really work hard to redeem himself in his book, whenever it comes out.
I wonder what the new cover is going to look like? When the others have all been this hot?   SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS! I’M NOT FUCKING AROUND THIS WAS TAKEN FROM THE CINCINNATI Q & A TRANSCRIPT APRIL 5TH 2014DO NOT READ UNLESS YOU REALLY WANT TO KNOW WHAT ELSE IS IN STORE FOR THE BDB! Personally I couldn’t wait and NEEDED to know what was coming. So if you are like me, read on! But If you don’t want to know. Seriously don’t read it!

Q: Are we going to hear from the glymera?A: Yes, but they’ve really had their cock and balls cut, but they really have great ideas (eyerolls) and I’m looking forward to see what they are.Q: Why didn’t we see that scene between Wrath and Tohr, at the pool house?A: I know as a writer it’s my job to write but that scene was too personal which I know sounds weird, but I really think that sometimes there are things I can’t show…Q: What’s the difference between the S’hibe(Sp?) the Moors, and the Shadows?A: The S’hibe, the moors and the Shadows are all the same.
She knew she had fucked up so badly, she literally made a post to justify her book on the release day.Let that sink in.Now, this is not a review of The Shadows, since I haven't and won't read it, but a comment about her post and series in general.
Whose fault do you think it is that these characters have no personality and are boring to write or read about?
That's dehumanizing and offensive in so many ways, I don't understand how no one from her team of ass kissers didn't– oh right.Not only does JRW have no idea how to write female characters, she's created one of the most sexist universes I've ever read.
Thinking about what happened, of course I wish for a different outcome.However, and even though I understand some fans were left deeply angered with the way things turned out to be, I can't help but appreciate the beauty in the pain and harbour a small flicker of hope inside of me.J.R.Ward is a talented writer.
They all suffered in some way and it was hard as hell to witness that, but I stand by my words that everything was worth it.But the story goes on and I know J.R.Ward has a lot to give us still.
This won't be the end.I know there is something waiting along the way for Trez and that we'll see him in a different light.
OMG. OMG. OMG. OMG.The Shadows finally get a book! YAAAYHold Up!! Wait a minute!! (view spoiler)[ So there is no HEA for Trez? (hide spoiler)]BOOOOOO!!****I Suffer from Mixed Emotions*********Not. Sure. How. To. Rate. This.****Final review...with MEGA Spoilers ahead!!!You have been Warned!!J.R.

There were two love stories, Trez and Selena, and iAm and his secret lover.
I wanted a happy ending for Trez, to counter balance his entire life of misery.

(hide spoiler)] Everyone with access to books on healing, i.e. Manny, Doc Jane, Rehvenge, and even iAm, could find no cure for Selena.
ETA on 11 April 2015: Please see at the bottom of my review.1.5 stars rounded up.First of all, I would like to clarify that the blog J.R. Ward posted on release day of The Shadows played a major role in my opinion and my rating of this book.J.R. Ward attributes everything she puts on paper to her Rice Krispies, assuming the role of the Delphic Oracle, or that of a mere conduit who doesn't have a say in her own work.
Oh also, I killed the heroine.Editor: *gapes* Why??J.R. Ward: Meh. She was uninteresting.
I mean, it was a very heavy reading and I was way too invested in the story, so for me it was actually quite difficult to read and finish.And maybe I'm growing old but I wasn't that happy with the multiple POVs this time and I kinda missed the old days when there were only three or four POVs. It wasn't all bad because I loved almost all the characters.Yep, you know who I didn't like?
I usually take my time with these books because it's a lot to handle.I don't know how things are going to work out for Layla and Xcor.On that note, I really don't like all the hate Layla always gets.
Popular author: "Hey, come over here, I want to show you something!Popular author's fan: "OMG! Of course. I've been waiting a whole year for you to show me something! I'm so excited!"Popular author: "Here, look ..." And now for the full report. So long some of it had to be my first GR blog post.I’m an addicted reader. If you see me, there is a Kindle or a book somewhere on my person. It’s how I spend most of my free time. I love reading all kinds of stories, but mostly I love Romance. I read a l
I read a lot of different genres, but I always come back to Romance.
Trusting, of course, that the author will have your back in the end.I tend to give Romance authors and their stories a lot more slack than I do other authors and genres.
Because I know how hard their job is and I appreciate that even if nothing else works in the story I can trust in that one thing.
Because trust is important to me, and Romance as a genre is also important to me, I rate it on a different scale than I do other genres.
What a heavy, depressing, disjointed and disappointing book.
I just can't even....I feel like I've been slapped in the face by Ward.
The Shadows contradicts everything Ward has lead us to believe regarding "bonded" mates.
The stars, the ending, the audacity that this is suppose to be a HEA is complete BS.
The H/h was one of MANY problems of the storyline.
I just don't have the words to express my disappointment and I can't believe I am one staring a BDB book from my favorite PNR author but it is valid.
4.5 Emotionally Battered Stars!! I laughed, I cried, I laughed some more, than I cried some more, and finally my heart crumbled in pure agony!! This is going to be a difficult review, I don't want to give anything away about the outcome.....Trez and Selena:I've been intrigued by the Shadows since Rhev's book Lover Avenged. I didn't think that the WARDen could pull off Trez being worthy of a Chosen because of his manwhoring ways, he came off as..... I don't know...not callus because he was alway
Xcor and Layla:We get a couple of revelations regarding Layla's pregnancy and her relationship with Xcor...Layla is so conflicted, I feel for her...I don't know how much longer she can continue with her deceptions to the King, the Brotherhood, and Qhuinn & Blay.
“But destiny can surprise you.”- Q to LuchasA little Insight into BDB Legacy:We meet and get to know Paradise, the blooded daughter of Abalone, First Adviser to the King who will be featured in the first book Blood Kiss in the BDB spin-off series 
I knew I wouldn’t like it, I knew how it would end...and yet...I still had hope.Ward's spoiler link hereFor example, if I see cheating...I know it’s a hard line for me.
I’m done with Ward, because I don’t trust she won’t do this again to us.Her comment about how she grieved for her dog through this book...then write this, let it be cathartic, then put it away.
TL;DRThis reads like the previous BDB books, but the heroine dies at the end.
OF COURSE I'M GOING TO READ IT. I can't be saved, I'm too far gone. Save yourself.
“She is . . . the moon in my night sky. And that is the beginning, middle, and end of it. There is no more to be told than that, and never shall I speak of her again.”  I've been waiting for this book since I finished The King, and consequently my hope was too high before I could get my hands on this beautiful book. The Shadows follows after what happened to Trez and iAm in the previous one, while Trez can't stop whoring himself, iAm is trying to fix things his brother has done until now. The s
The Shadows follows after what happened to Trez and iAm in the previous one, while Trez can't stop whoring himself, iAm is trying to fix things his brother has done until now.
The story of this book is heartbreaking and painful, yet it's so beautiful in the same time.
Why is this book so exquisite (view spoiler)[ even though the ending is sad and unacceptable for some readers (hide spoiler)] ?
This is the book that I can't get it out of my head and my mind even I read it the first time last year.
Britney is not the only one not feeling it. I can not believe how boring this book was. I was as bored as a stone statue (oh yes I did go there). I'm not even going to write a comprehensive review. I'm just going to jump from one rant to another. I mean if the author can write an almost 600 pg book just jumping around randomly from plotline to plotline then why can't I? (There will be spoilers in my rants so stop right now if you don't want to know stuff)1. I loathe these Chosen chicks. Like re
If even you know how boring they are WHY ARE YOU WRITING THE THIRD DARN BOOK ABOUT THEM??(and that's not even counting the endless Layla drama)2.
There were a bunch of scenes in this book where I wanted to throat punch her but the one that really made me mad was when she gets so upset seeing Xcor jack off that she trips and falls hard enough to break her arm.
We know Ward can write emotions like no other yet this storyline was so damn boring that I didn't cry.
How about Ward stop writing all these storylines and go back to one, two things a book?
Seeing some one star reviews kinda scares me...Now I know what the hulabaloo was all about! I'm just going to come out and say it...I loved this one. I had absolutely no idea before reading this that there was any kind of controversy brewing. But then I saw some one-star reviews, and I thought "Uh-oh, how can that be?" J R Ward with one-star reviews???So the further I got into the book, I sensed what that was all about. Yet I held out hope that maybe it was something else? Maybe what I thought w
Because I was just so involved in their romance...it made me feel so much...and I cried and cried and I couldn't believe that I was crying...and Trez did so many beautiful, romantic things for Selena (oh my, the amusement park, the restaurant scene, the ring shopping)...and I loved them so much as a couple!
Yes, it was a shocker when (view spoiler)[ Trez and Selena didn't get the miracle that Rhage and Mary got, or that V and Doc Jane got.
(hide spoiler)]Now, about the rest of the book: there's a lot of plot threads left dangling...Layla and Xcor...things started to heat up, but then...let's just say their story is far from over.
So, this is my review of the latest Ward book. I love this time of year, and the traditions that come alone with it as a long-time JR Ward fan. It's a big part of why I enjoy this series so much.Sorry, but this is a really long review. I had a lot to say! Possible Spoiler Disclaimer:  I will warn readers that while I really tried not to use overt spoilers, you will see that there is an emotional shock that comes in this book, but I don’t reveal exactly what it was. Readers beware!The Shadows is
Will iAm ever get the chance to build his own life, and to make decisions that aren’t dictated by his sacrificial love for his brother?With a storyline that like, you know there’s going to be major drama.
Having said that, I’ll definitely be reading the spinoff series, even though I think it’s Ward’s bid for the New Adult niche (and I’m not interested in that genre).So, yes, I think I could go on about this book, but I’ve already written such a long review.
J.R. Ward changes the game with THE SHADOWS with not just one hero, but two in Trez and iAm. As these two brothers have their stories told, expect a lot of emotion, action and passion. All of these things are things I’ve come to expect in a J.R. Ward book, but especially in the Black Dagger Brotherhood series.The Shadows have been in the series for a long time, but since they were just on the sidelines I never gave them much thought until now. As the eldest of the two, Trez is the Anointed On
J.R. Ward changes the game with THE SHADOWS with not just one hero, but two in Trez and iAm. As these two brothers have their stories told, expect a lot of emotion, action and passion.
Ward’s romance is really about putting together the hero and heroine and then letting the emotions flow as they come and I definitely felt a strong connection between these two.Now in addition to The Shadows, Ward focuses a lot on progressing the world.
(view spoiler)[The side characters first, before I get into the Trez/iAm thing : 1.
He waited all this time to lose his virginity and his story got rushed in one book, while Trez had a several book buildup prior?
Granted, I'm sure there will be at least 5-10 books (yes, Ward will keep this series going that long) before Trez finds someone, so we'll be lulled into a place of Selena being a dull memory, the same way that Wellsie was.
I went into this book with an idea of how I thought it would all go down, and while I had the general idea right, the story has some huge surprises, and took me places I definitely wasn’t expecting!
I’m not going to go into detail about their backstory, because their history is well developed before this book starts (don’t even think about reading this series out of order!!!), and the way everything plays out for them is a real surprise - it’s best to watch it all unfold as it happens.
We are briefly introduced to her love interest and I am so excited for their story.

Then she lifted her hands to the mesh that covered her face—but it was to hold the masking in place. “I am afraid.”“Of what?”What if he didn’t like what he saw?“I already know you’re beautiful,” he said, as if he read her mind.“How?”He touched the center of his large chest. “I see you in here. I know you … in here. Y
Sympaths and Shadows would have made great sub-stories and side-series.Obviously the book focused mainly on iAms story and iAm’s HEA but from Trez’s point of view which is a bit unfair for iAm, because really Trez is a selfish, self-centered guy who thinks that the Earth revolves around him and his never-ending drama.Apparently after he almost ruined iAm’s story, Trez’s story will continue as it was obvious in book The Chosen.Readers were tortured for the majority of the Shadows about the question whether Selena will be saved in the end.
Until now all the readers love Wellsie and Darius, but most of them do not want to talk about Selena’s death.

The (view spoiler)[HEA (hide spoiler)] romance lover in me wants to be mad at J.R. Ward and feel disillusioned and rant in frustration, but dammit, I still really freaking liked the overall story.
So, I’m giving this a somewhat reluctant and begrudging 4 stars.["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>
I am going to rate this a 4.5 stars, and my reason I can't really reveal without spoiling part of the story.
This book was an absolute roller coaster ride in the best, and at times;worst way.
I need to sit and contemplate before I write my review.
This is a highly emotional book..That is all there is to it..and I will say that after reading this story, I won't ever be the same.
In the past few books, I found there was so much other stuff going on, we didn't get enough of our origional brothers.
More to come with my review...
Still a good book, despite you know what (view spoiler)[selena's death (hide spoiler)].PS: Will I ever get Nalla interacting with the Brothers? WITH HER DADDY? Is all I ever want?-----------Apr 08, 2014----------Trez and iAm's book!["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>
This is 2015 and we've came a long fucking way from skirting around story lines that take people out of their comfort zones.I am seeing people actually writing things like:"How did her editor let her get away with that one???"-Ummm, because it's her fucking book and her fucking world.
The beauty in this book is the life Selena lived, and the unconditional love Trez showed.
They didn't need a HEA, because in the real world we are not promised one."Romance books are supposed to end with a working relationship between the hero and heroine."-Let's talk about other romantic relationships.
The further into the series the books go and the more it becomes less about the Brotherhood themselves and them fighting an all-out war against the lessers and the more the books become all about Doc Jane and all the patients she treats.
So you can cut that out too.Basically the main plot of the book centres around Selena dying and Trez trying to get out of becoming the next Shadow Queen's personal sex slave and all the drama as everyone tries to give them a happy ending while the two of them go out on dates and try to pretend everything will work out just fine.I'm losing my patience with this series.
This was an adult paranormal romance, which focused on the romantic lives of iAm and Trez.Trez and iAm were both interesting characters in this story, and both had their own problems.
I liked how they supported each other though, and didn’t only think of themselves.The storyline in this was about Trez finally getting together with Selena, and us finally finding out what her illness was and how it affected her.
We also got a romance happening for iAm, after his shock revelation in the last book, and learned more about Trez’s birth right as the Princess’ mate.
The ending to this had some surprises, and things didn’t end happily for one of the brothers.7 out of 10
