I have been a fan of Emilie Loring since high school days.
This book was good as usual.
It was about Ann Jerome who had been in love with her sisters fiance for years.
He had been away for a year and came home injured.
Ann was so happy to see him but Sonia her sister had fallen for someone else during his absent.
It was interesting to see how loyal Sonia was even tho' she did not love this guy anymore.
Lots of lessons from Emilies books......I started reading this while in Va. and finished after coming home.
I reread this book because I like the story of the injured engineer returning from foreign parts. Unfortunately, 36 years after the most recent read, I've become less tolerant of stupidity, and the way the main characters absolutely refuse to see anything outside their accepted mindsets is truly stupid.
I know Emilie Loring's books are formulaic, but I've always enjoyed them. This one was written during WWII and it's always interesting to me to see the point of view of someone who was actually living during that event.
Loriing's books are an interesting period piece. I'm passing this on to Goodwill.
I thought this book was confusing and boring. Not Emilie Loring's best.
I started reading Emile Loring books when I picked up a paperback from a rack in a hotel lobby (for 50 cents) while on my sister's & my yearly vacation to visit my father. Hooked! I went on to purchase and read every Emilie Loring romance written and available in paperback, not knowing that she had died before I was even born. I loved these books, but read them when I was between about 12 and 18 years old. I was a young reader - do keep that in mind! :-)
Charming story with some confusing vernacular that I assume was common in the 1940's.
Light and fluffy love story.Brain candy.
