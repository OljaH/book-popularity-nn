His guests include: Hercule Poirot; Dr Bartholomew Strange; Lady Mary Lytton Gore, and her daughter Hermione; Captain Dacres and his wife Cynthia; Muriel Wills; Oliver Manders; Mr Satterthwaite; and Reverend Babbington and his wife.
While holding a dinner party at his home in Yorkshire, Strange suddenly died after drinking a glass of port.
ولی چون تصور می‌کنند عدد سیزده نحس است، و خوب نیست تعداد میهمانان سیزده نفر باشد، خانم وایولت میلری، منشی سر چارلز هم به جمع مهمانان اضافه می‌شود و تعداد آنها به چهارده نفر می‌رسد.
در داستان سه نفر (یک کشیش و یک دکتر و یک بیمار روانی) به طرز زیرکانه، و بی‌رحمانه‌ ای به قتل می‌رسند.
The Three Act Tragedy is yet another interesting murder-mystery of the Poirot series.
(hide spoiler)]We see only a little of Hercule Poirot in the story after his appearance in the first act till he re-enters in the third act.
So instead of Poirot, we see two armature detectives poking their noses around to find clues and gathering evidence in an effort to establish the identity of the murderer.
When Poirot so painstakingly established the motive for the crimes, it came as a real surprise to me.
In my personal view, the murder-mysteries in the Poirot series are where Agatha Christie is at her best.
After all, that is why I love and respect her above all others; if I want to solve a mystery halfway through I'll read Sayers or Tey or any of her other contemporaries.However, Three Act Tragedy deserves all five stars quite apart from whether I solved it before Poirot or not.
It reminds me of the solution to The ABC Murders but with a completely different motive.Why didn't I suspect Charles?
Charles seemed to be his Watson here, even though I know perfectly well--and I say it ALL THE TIME--that with Christie the murderer can be absolutely anyone.

Simply delicious, but more Poirot would have been appreciated. Plus, now I can't get my mind off of the idea of Mr Quinn magically popping up to pair up with Poirot and his old friend Satterthwaite (who is in this book and to whom I owe this bookish dream of mine).
And which give a whole new meaning to 'choose your poison'.)Unlike his usual solitary sleuthing ways (or ones where Hastings tags along and remains continually baffled, puzzled and in awe of Poirot's detecting and deductive skills), in Three Act Tragedy Poirot has teamed up with a team of individuals all too invested in the resolution of the murders.
And that's just the way we like him.And so, as one amateur detective interrogates one suspect, and the other equal amateur interrogates another, Poirot puts the little grey cells to work once more - and acts as a sort of information center.
"Illumination by:HERCULE POIROT"Christie seems here to have had fun by using the theatre, which she loved, to shape the form and content of this novel.
Actors take the limelight in the midst of the more usual characters, such as doctors, priests and aristocracy, that people Agatha's casts.Poirot is actually absent for most of the narration, the investigative work done instead by Sir Charles Cartwright, Mr Satterthwaite and Miss Hermione Lytton Gore "Egg", until the end that is when the Belgian indeed provides 'illumination'.Apart from this, the book is also a great example of Christie showing her mastery at misdirecting her readers.
Really enjoyable, as Agatha Christie always is.
A unique book in the sense that Mr. Satterthwaite, usually associated with Mr. Quin, plays second fiddle to Poirot here.I did not like the book as much as some of her others - except for a daring premise: (view spoiler)[a dress rehearsal for a murder! (hide spoiler)] which left me totally dumbfounded.
Christie, continuing her focus on theater-based mysteries, supposes (through Poirot) that actors, playwrights, theater-goers and detectives all can observe closely, though they will obviously typically notice different things.
um, yes.*People are always saying things like “It must have been the work of a lunatic,” or madman when it doesn’t seem to make sense why someone would kill such a nice man as Babbington, for instance.Christie often plays with readers by commenting on what they know are typical tropes of mystery and detective novels.
Ed anche questa volta quel genialaccio di Poirot ha fatto centro.
le sue meravigliose celluline grigie...Non è certamente tra i migliori della produzione Christie, però la storia è ben orchestrata; buone le ambientazioni ed esaustive le descrizioni dei vari (non molti) personaggi...
Devo dedurne che a volte le celluline grigie funzionano anche a me?
😉A proposito di ambientazione: ho scelto questo libro perché una piccola parte della storia (piccolissima a dire il vero, appena un paio di capitoli e poche pagine), si svolge a Montecarlo, con qualche richiamo qua e là proprio a quel soggiorno.🌍 Europa Tour con un libro sotto il braccio: 🇬🇧 Inghilterra 🇬🇧 & 🇮🇩 Principato di Monaco 🇮🇩📚 Biblioteca
Our lead this time is Mr. Satterthwaite (who is actually from Christie’s Mr. Quinn short story series, which shows that she was doing crossovers long before Marvel made it cool); who is a fairly reasonable detective in his own right, bringing into question why Poirot is even needed in this book.
Poirot gives us a reason , but it seems rather forced, and like Christie needed to “explain” the character in such a way as to why he wouldn’t be a proper lead for this case.
This book was a bit frustrating for awhile.
The characters and scenes were interesting enough for a bit, but meh...I kept wanting to skim ahead after awhile.
After page 128, seriously, Hercule Poirot started appearing for real.
Once he came on stage the story started to come together even more so, even if it wasn't from his usual detective-type meddling.
At first I was afraid this would be another disappointing mystery type where a solution is found without any clever clues to help the reader...however, it turned not to be so when the case was explained.The clues instead were so very minor and subtle it was almost impossible to pick up on them.
I GUESSED THE KILLER!!So, this is obviously my absolutely favorite Hercule Poirot novel, since I was such a genius that I solved the crime before the chapters got into double digits.
I couldn't guess the motive, but I knew who did it, how said person did it, and other specifics of the crime fairly early on!
You know, it's really not from being so smart; it's from reading so many Poirot books, and so many in a row.
I'm going to take a break to enjoy my success since I know that I won't get so lucky the next time.
Three-Act Tragedy, first published as Murder in Three Acts in 1934, proves that an Hercule Poirot novel with very little Hercule Poirot just doesn’t rise to Dame Agatha Christie’s usual high standards.Charming, inoffensive Reverend Stephen Babbington suffers a fatal seizure after sipping a rye martini at a house party hosted by Sir Charles Cartwright, a famous stage actor with lots of charm and healthy self-regard.
Nearly all of the guests present at the first death are present at the second, but this time the verdict is nicotine poisoning.One of the guests at Sir Charles’ fateful house party in Cornwall are Hercule Poirot; another is the meek, observant Mr. Satterthwaite, sentimental but a shrewd judge of character and a regular in Agatha Christie’s Harley Quin stories.
Even more troubling for the great detective, there was absolutely no motive!My Review: This review is of the novel, eleventh in the series, and of the twelfth-season film adaptation for Agatha Christie's Poirot.
The story is the same in both media, omitting the unnecessary written character of Satterthwaite as a less dimwitted version of Hastings.Babbington's death is only the first of three apparently utterly unrelated murders.
When the killer is unmasked, it is a bad, bad day for Poirot and a painful and frightening awakening for the younger characters in the story.But the murders and the motives survive intact between the media.

This is classic Poirot. For more than 70% of the time, all the running, talking to people, verifying alibis, working on motives is done by three people. Then walks in the master sleuth with his little grey cells and solves the crime!! A Christie fan will get an inkling of the murderer right in the beginning but nevertheless it is fun to read and discover the murderer in the end.
A good one!
I didn't really care for Mr. S (just because I never want to type out his name ever again) and I didn't really like him working with Poirot.
I kind of felt that I was skimming a lot in this book because of him but at the same time not because of him?
I don't know - I guess this book was just kind of meh or boring to me.
I just want more Poirot in my life right now and nothing can stop me from reading these books!
Poirot wasn't in this one a lot but it makes sense why in the last chapter.
After never having read any of her books, Three Act Tragedy marks the fourth that I've read so far in 2017 (following And Then There Were None, Murder on the Orient Express, and The Murder of Roger Ackroyd).
It's not always right, but usually 20-30% into the book I point to one character and say with a certain amount of authority, 'you, I think it was you.' I've yet to be able to do that with Agatha Christie.
Chi ha l’imbarazzante tendenza per i naufragi può restare in terraferma per tutta la vita, ma appena si avventurerà in barchetta sul lago del parco, finirà sott’acqua.
Lo stesso può accadere a un Hercule Poirot.
Dove si trova lui, avviene immediatamente un delitto.
Ahi ahi, tre stelle stiracchiate.Questa volta, cara Christie, ho faticato a stare dietro alla tua storia.
Non mi attirava il cast di personaggi né l’ambiente, e il signor Poirot compariva solo ogni tanto.
Da pagina 160 circa, però, tutto è andato meglio.Peccato aver capito subito il colpevole...Per ora, questo è il libro con protagonista Poirot che mi è piaciuto di meno.
This novel is also curious because one of its main characters is Mr. Satterthwaite, who collaborated with the mysterious Mr. Quin in a different novel.ESPAÑOL: Está bien esta novela para pasar un buen rato, es original, distinta de otras de la autora.
Además, en este caso conseguí descubrir, no sólo quién era el asesino, sino también cómo y por qué habían tenido lugar los asesinatos, y esto último lo descubrí antes que Poirot.
Esta novela también es curiosa porque en ella aparece en un papel importante el señor Satterthwaite, quien en otro libro famoso colabora con el misterioso señor Quin.
Every time I read a Christie I remember why she's the Queen of the crime world. Her characters leap off of the page, her plots fizz along and there's not a single boring word. Stellar in every way, this theatrical murder mystery isn't even one of her best, and it's still brilliant. 12+*Please note: this review is meant as a recommendation only. Please do not use it in any marketing material, online or in print, without asking permission from me first. Thank you!*
Like all Agatha Christie books it's expertly crafted and gives you enough clues/red herrings to keep you guessing and eagerly reading.I was a little sad at how little page time Poirot had as he is absent for a lot of the book.
There are a lot of characters and at the beginning I had to keep double checking who was who but once I figured that out, I thought this was an entertaining read.I loved that there was a character who seemed very like Agatha Christie too!
It's not one of my favourites from the Queen of Mystery but it's still a rock solid read.
13 year old me was right, that's quite the twist. I thought I didn't remember this, but my updates seem to say otherwise - it's all laid out for everyone to see.Poirot was MIA for most of the book.(view spoiler)[I did wonder why there was a marriage proposal before the end. That's usually a clue that something aint right. (hide spoiler)]--------------Review written when I was 13:A good book with a very clever surprise ending.
4 o 4.5 estrellasMe encantó este libro, como siempre me sorprendí mucho al descubrir quién era el asesino, nunca me lo imaginé! La explicación del caso y conocido lo resuelve Poirot fue sin duda una de mis partes favoritas.Próxima reseña en www.navegandoentrelibros.cl
Good one!
Another ending that I did NOT see coming. A classic Agatha.
