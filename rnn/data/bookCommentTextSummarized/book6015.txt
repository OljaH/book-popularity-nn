What's not to love in an Enid Blyton. Complete reading satisfaction guaranteed :)
My favourite book as a child. I lost count of the times I read this one. A great mystery with some nice twists. Lovable characters.
... reading with my 10 year old daughter...I've read Famous Five Series way back when I was a child and I've read it numerous times. This series is new to me. My daughter and I have read this story together and we both loved it.
Is people going to be mad of me if I said I never read this book as s child?
I hope not!I love this book.
At first, I really hate Loony.
In fact, if I ever encounter a kid like Loony, I'd dislike that kid as well.
Up to all sorts of tricks almost all the time, I find that Loony is annoying.
But as I keep reading it, he can be a nice kid.
It's just he lacks attention and some people are just like that, annoying 😂Reading it for fun and for the English.
Tāda normāla bērnu/jauniešu grāmata. Nevaru teikt, ka dēls būtu mega aizrāvies, bet beigas viņam patika - tad jau bija vērts.Man pašam jau šķiet, ka visas šīs bērnu piedzīvojumu grāmatas ir ļoti līdzīgas ar pārāk vienkāršiem atrisinājumiem, bet varu derēt, ka savā bērnībā ar kaifu būtu lasījis.
to je najboljša vseh cajtov
Pity, because I would have enjoyed it, just like I enjoyed the Famous Five and the Adventure series.
Having one of the group (Barney) be from a very different social class was an interesting twist, and I look forward to seeing how Barney's story progresses.The book kind of reminded me of Five Go Adventuring Again, with the children spending the holidays at a house with adult supervision and a tutor so they can catch up with their school work.
The children never went on holiday on their own, so it was more of a mystery/crime adventure kind of story.
I don't remember much about the content anymore, but I know that books of Enid Blyton were on my bookshelf at my childhood. It was mostly mystery that was captivating and round characters (fully developed). I remember that the ending was always something that I didn't see coming and that is what I liked - this unexpected plot twist and how everything fits together.I'm sure that this and other books from the collection would be interesting to re-read or read for a bit older people. It doesn't have to be only children's literature to enjoy a fine writing.
Chtěla jsem změnu a hlavně přečíst i knížky, ke kterým jsem se v dětství nedostala, ale na poličkách stále čekají. Tato kniha, ač je určena mladším čtenářům umí vtáhnout do děje lehkou dějovou linkou, ve které se objeví i napětí a nebezpečí. Je to něco jiného, než ten dospělý stereotyp - tady je vše rychle vyřešeno bez jakýchkoli průtahů. Takže jako oddychové čtení to není pro dospělé čtenáře vůbec špatné a mladší to musí posoudit sami, ale věřím, že se jim to bude líbit a sáhnou po dalších dílech.
What I don't understand is how something so big and noisy could have happened for months in a quiet village at night without anybody noticing anything.
Love this old-fashioned mystery.
This is a good old-fashioned type mystery for young people.
I guess this is the first book in a series called Barney Mysteries.
Barney is a young teenaged boy who is homeless and searching for his father.
While staying in a deserted old mansion in the country he meets brother and sister Roger and Diana and their cousin Snubby who are staying nearby with a sort of governess while their parents are abroad.
The kids are intrigued by strange unidentifiable noises at night in the old house.
When Barney investigates he becomes imprisoned.
The mystery is sort of predictable but it still makes for good reading.
The first in the Barney series, and a good book at that!
I've always liked Barney; he is the perfect Enid Blyton character.
Joining him in this series are the tricky Snubby, unwanted by most of his relatives, the untidy, rather mean at times Diana, and Roger, a kind of fill in big brother character with no outstanding qualities.
He kind of just exists, in comparison to Snubby and Barney at least.
I liked the mystery with this one, and although I don't own many in the series, I'm now left wondering when Barney finds his father as he appears in a later book.
Roger and Diana are not exactly thrilled to discover that they are to spend the holidays with their mother's old governess, and that their cousin Snubby will also be staying with them.
Especially since they are all to have a tutor.
But then they meet Barney and his monkey Miranda, and explore the nearby Rockingdown House, which has long been deserted.
Since Barney is basically homeless, he decides to sleep in the old nursery, but then he hears strange noises at night — noises that leave no traces behind in the dust!
But he is determined to find an answer, even though it places him in great danger.
Enid Blytonová mi opět dokázala, že dokáže uchvátit srdce všech čtenářů, i ta, která již z dětskosti vyrostla (alespoň částečně). Autorce bych chtěl poděkovat za další skvělou četbu, jež mi ukrátila dlouhé večery. Nejedná se o nic výjimečného, ale zároveň nic ledabylého, za mne jasné 4 hvězdy! :)
I loved this book and WANT MORE!
