Mars hopes that his reports will encourage their home planet to continue their support.The first half of the book takes place on the ship where Gibson learns his way around and gets to know the astronauts.
As soon as the ship lands on Mars, they all but disappear and the story shifts to Gibson's observations of the land he sees and the work the colonists have done to make it inhabitable for humans.Maybe this would have been interesting if it was non fiction, but just reading one person's idea of what living on another planet would be like is not my cup of tea, but other readers might like it.

Clarke novel I've read.
I can't compare it to his own later novels, but it is interesting to note the differences between Sci-Fi of the 50s to the genre today.
While the character-building was well done, and the few passages that were descriptive of the Mars Clarke was guiding us through were eloquent and picturesque, the book as a whole was fairly simple and quickly read.
If it were written today, I would have rated it lower, but since it was a Sci-Fi novel written in a time before we had even landed on OUR moon, I imagine it was pretty advanced for its time.
Around 1950, he wrote The Sands of Mars, a sand-in-the-spacesuit novel about one man’s exploration of Mars and of himself, a story of growth and transformation, of becoming an adult and responsible individual.Clarke possessed a talent I have come to like more and more with advancing age, the ability to write an interesting yarn without introducing violent conflicts or bad-guy characters.
The main character, a science fiction author named Martin Gibson, grows in a credible manner from being immature and egocentric to assuming great responsibility.I found the novel in a bargain bookshop in my hometown Gothenburg in the late 1970s and it has remained in my bookshelf ever since.
Martin Gibson is a science fiction writer and he decides to spend his money on a trip to the red planet which is now becoming colonised.
The two become friends and soon Gibson is accepted as part of the group (at first he is looked down upon, as just another writer of space adventures).
I think the last time I saw the word 'connexion' was in a Dickens novel!Still, all good stuff with drama (a sandstorm), adventure (young Jimmy being amazed by Mars's aerology) and humour, not to mention a bit of relationship controversy!
Tek kelimeyle harika bir kitaptı.. Atmosferine girip dış dünyayı unutturan içine girebildiğim bir kitap oldu.. Alıp götüren kitapları çok seviyorum, keşke sahaftan daha fazlasını alsaymışım clarke, asimov ve bilimum eski kurgu-bilim kitapları :)

I re-read it now because it was the yahoogroups Hard-SF book of the month for March 2012, and in order to count it in the paperbackswap 2Q2012 SF Challenge as a first novel of a British writer.
This could be considered a precursor, set in the same universe, as Clarke's Space Odyssey books.I'm afraid I remembered next to nothing about the novel from my first read.
I enjoyed it more than I was expecting, but probably mostly those were feelings of nostalgia for a past era of science fiction.
The one well-developed main character - a science fiction writer - had a single traumatic female relationship in his past.
I'm having trouble putting this into context.
When originally published, what sort of book would sit next to it?
Something pulpy and ridiculous?
Was this revolutionary in its cold fidelity to hard physics and technological understanding of the time?
What would I compare this to?Given Clarke's stringent adherence and reputation, it's tempting to pick at the things he doesn't get right--cigarettes on spaceships, typewriters, administrator-secretaries on Mars, meteorologists on space stations, newspapers in set type--but I later wondered how many of these were deliberate, that suggesting handheld reading/writing/chatting devices with the capacity of several libraries would be a stretch too far for his audience.
This has been a difficult novel to rate, partly due to it being Clarke's "first full-length novel," but also that I've found it difficult to keep thoughts of the author's later masterpieces (i.e., The City and the Stars; Childhood's Endcertainly two of the greatest works yet produced in the entire realm of Science Fiction) from impinging onto memory as a no doubt unfair comparison.The Sands of Mars is an example of an author not only stretching his imagination into a novel-length statement for t
The staggering use of imagination present in, for example, The City and the Stars is naturally enough not yet full-blown present, but the underpinings of future expressive growth most definitely are!The novel is a worthy read, and could just as well have been given three stars (something which, judging by the cumulative rating of the novel, many have doneand even higher than three stars); it's just that, for me, I can't get the searing genius of the two above-mentioned works out of mind (and there are othersthose simply happen to be my personal favoritesRendezvous with Rama [NOT THE SEQUELS!] also is resident in the "upper echelon hierarchy").
So, fair or not, in comparison to certain of the later works, The Sands of Mars suffers.
Pensare che si potesse scrivere Hard SF nel 1951 lascia sempre attoniti, ma d'altronde, lo faceva già Verne molto tempo prima; e c'è tanto dello spirito, dell'amore per la scienza e del "Sense of Wonder" di Verne anche in quest'opera di esordio di Clarke.
Leggere le "Sabbie" è irrinunciabile per un appassionato di AC, ma è anche un altro sorprendente esempio di SF con più di 60 anni sul groppone, eppure ancora pienamente godibile, brillante ed appassionante.
Lo sarà ancora tra altri 60 anni, anche se magari sembrerà sempre un pò meno hard SF e un pò più "Steampunk"...
Perfectly serviceable terribly quaint novel about the settlement of Mars in I guess the 1990s?
It was Clarke's first novel, written in about 1948 and published in 1951, and Mars has a (thin but far too thick) atmosphere, weird plants, (spoiler) animals, and no mountains at all--we hadn't figured out yet the biggest mountain in the Solar System is there.
Not bad, not good, just a book, but one I've owned for like 4 years now without reading so I'm glad I got that out of the way.
The first Arthur Clarke story I've ever had to read as an historical artifact, as opposed to a simple novel.
By his own admission, the story is written prior to the major (and by implication, disappointing) discoveries in the 60s and 70s about the spartan/sterile nature of Mars.
The result is almost like reading an alternate universe rendition of the red planet; a final visit to a Mars more recognizable by Ray Bradbury than by authors like Ben Bova.
This is definitely the oddest Clarke novel I have read to date, and most of it is held together by the sheer strength of his prose style.
Agradable y de rápida lectura. Menos "científico" que otras obras y más centrado en las relaciones humanas de sus personajes. Su desenlace me ha dejado un poco con gusto a poco, pero es porque pensaba que tendría un giro más brusco, pero he entendido que el autor se centró más en el protagonista que en la historia. Lo que cierra igualmente con saldo positivo
Ciò fa sì che il romanzo appaia come un resoconto che non coinvolge durante la lettura.La contemporanea presenza di questi due aspetti purtroppo non mi ha fatto apprezzare il libro.Ho letto altri classici che raccontano un Marte totalmente diverso da ciò che poi si è rivelato essere, ma il modo in cui erano scritti li rendeva comunque godibili, poiché mi permettevano di emozionarmi insieme al protagonista, penare con lui.
I am reviewing the hard science fiction novel The Sands Of Mars by Arthur C Clarke which is a very good book which I bought from kindle.
The plot is an author is on his way to Mars when his ship, he is flying solo, runs into trouble.
He is taken aboard a space freighter and completes his journey to Mars.
There is only a small crew aboard the freighter, much smaller than on a passenger ship.
I think Clarke though has written better stories than this.
I think A Fall Of Moondust is my favourite story by him.
It was mildly interesting, but not enough to keep my focus on it.I didn't really start, I think, to pay attention to what I was reading, until Squeak and the Airweed got involved.The problem that I have with Clarke seems to be that he's a wonderful writer for the FIRST book in a series, and that after that, as he tries to add more depth, to flesh out characters more, etc, he seems to struggle, and gives too much attention to these aspects, and less to what he truly excels in - which is the hard sci-fi writing itself.
I might read the third book, but can't say I have any great desire to.
This was probably a good book back when it was published (1951), but it focuses too much on "real" science that is now outdated and/or wrong.
Which is funny, because two of the characters in the book have a friendly argument about whether science fiction stories survive the test of time (chapter 5).
It starts off as an interesting discussion, but it doesn't go anywhere and is never resolved.And that's sort of the tone of the entire book: it just meanders and never really goes anywhere.
Clarke's worst book.
drago mi je bilo pročitati prvi pravi (pune duljine) Clarkeov roman.(do tada je objavljivao samo priče)puno je tu naive (hej - 1951. - opet je sve "atomsko") no odmah se vidi i budući master tzv. hard-core SF podžanra - ne upada ni tada lako u zamke popularnog, maltene magijskog, SF-a (mada ima dijelova koje baš i ne može znanost objasniti - recimo, nije mi baš jasna uloga metana i atomskog pogona no možda sam i ponešto propustio :) )jedan zanimljiv oblik hrvatskog iz 1957. sa milijardom zareza u rečenici.više od trojke
There's just something about classic 1950s sci-fi that makes you feel excited about the future. Everything is a little over-simplified, from the exobiology to the human psychology, but wouldn't it be great if colonising other planets was this easy? Films like Interstellar (awful) and The Martian (awesome) try to recapture that optimism, but somehow never quite get it. Maybe I'm showing my age but compared to new sci-fi, some of which is seriously depressing, I'll give Mr Clarke 4-5 stars every time.
The Sands of Mars, Martin Gibson isimli ünlü bir bilim kurgu yazarının Marsa olan yolculuğunu ve Mars'da yaşadıklarını anlatıyor.Marsı anlatırken, Mars'ın terraformation veya dünyalaştırılma sürecine tanık oluyor ve Mars'ın aslında kendi kendine yetebilen bir dünya olduğunu fark ediyor.Kitap Arthur C. Clarke tarafından 1951 yılında yayınlanmış. Kitabı okudum (dinledim), ancak diğer Clarke kitapları kadar etkilendiğimi söyleyemeyeceğim.
This is a quaint novel that plods along at its own pace. I like how Clarke hints and makes references to the future Mars that will come to be. This gives the narrative, which is short and rather contained, a feeling of fullness and scale that I really enjoy.
L’enigma delle attività promosse dal burbero presidente Hadfield non è l’unico con cui Gibson deve confrontarsi: già sull’astronave il passato doloroso è tornato a fargli visita, facendogli incontrare il figlio della sua ex compagna dei tempi dell’università, e inoltre sembra che Marte, prima dell’arrivo degli esseri umani, non sia disabitato come tutti suppongono…Appartenente alla “Golden Age” della fantascienza (pubblicato nel 1951), “The Sands of Mars” (plauso all’editore italiano che ha mantenuto miracolosamente il titolo originale) è un romanzo da antologia, che contiene tutti gli elementi tipici del genere: i viaggi interplanetari, la scoperta e la colonizzazione di un nuovo mondo, le strane creature, vegetali e animali, che laggiù possono trovarsi, le innovative tecnologie al servizio dell’ambizione umana di spingersi “là, dove nessun uomo è mai giunto prima” etc.
A classic that stands the test of time!The Sands of Mars is a joy - a lightweight, easy-reading, far-sighted hard sci-fi novel that addresses the broad topics of interplanetary travel and colonization, development and terraforming of the hostile extra-terrestrial Martian environment.
One could quibble, I suppose, that the science is slightly dated and there were certainly a couple of predictions that have since been proven incorrect but, for my money, the story is made all the more exciting and amazing for the degree to which it is now, fifty years later, approaching reality and the possibility of achievement!Martin Gibson, a celebrated science fiction writer, has been invited to be the first and only passenger on the maiden voyage of Ares, the first interplanetary vessel that will be devoted to passenger travel.
While Asimov's contemporaneous sociological musing can come off as wooden, Clarke instills in the reader a genuine enthusiasm which bridges the 65-plus-year fact gap in his hard science.
Set in a period in which the Mars colony is reasonably well-established, but still small, and still working out issues of sustainability, question such as the value to Earth of continued investment are handled deftly and provocatively.
What is more frustrating is the fact that in the early 1950s Clarke could envision, not unreasonably for the era, the establishment of permanent colonies on other bodies within the solar system within 40 or 50 years.
In retrospect, Foundation seems shot through with all-knowing smug smart-arses, while the characters in The Sands of Mars felt a lot more real and relatable.
Martin (Martian??) Gibson in particular is a classic slightly clueless everyman that is easy for a reader to identify with, and I enjoyed the more individual psychology (in contrast with the civilisation-wide "psychohistory" in Foundation).It doesn't seem entirely fair to compare this book with Foundation so much, given it was written earlier, but these are the only two Clarke novels I've read recently, and it's interesting to think how his writing style changed in between.
ACC does not just add some human drama to a cool what-if idea.
If what happened in this book happened in the real world (the findings on Mars and mankind's changing of it), it would matter to me and there would be people involved very much like ACC has imagined who would be affected by it in just the way he proposes.
This book is hopeful and bright and yet realistic in its outlook, yet it faces the very real challenges of the skeptics who question why we bother to explore the universe.
Fun to see another perspective on what a Mars colony might look like (though a little dated, as the author notes!).General thoughts after reading:-The romance felt a little forced and rapid, as if an afterthought to add another layer to the characters and plot.-The author tried to give Gibson an interesting character and history, and partially succeeded.
I felt there could have been more brought out in Gibson, as there were many passages and internal monologues that hinted at a nice, complex character, which might've brought more to the book.Or it might not have.
The character arguing for lost value appears to win and this book would bare that out.
For example, I stopped reading when the Mars stenography pool became a focus of this book.
That pool, in the greatest of 1950s stereotypes, was full of young women whose greatest desire was to get married and start making babies.Bottom line: had I been better prepared for the slow pace and ridiculous 1950s stereotypes I may have enjoyed this as a story about the colonization of Mars.
As is, I feel I wasted my time.
