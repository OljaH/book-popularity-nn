She created Earthsea in 1964, introduced Ged in 1968, and finally ended the series (?) in 2001 with The Other Wind.
Just as Ged, in his old age, is “done with doing,” by now Le Guin is far less interested in plot or character than in the implications of the one-sided world she created a generation earlier.
In Tehanu and “Dragonfly” she opens up several flip sides to her early subjects: women rather than men, ordinary people instead of wizards and kings, everyday concerns like chores and crime rather than magical catastrophes, and the simple behavior and merits of dumb animals rather than dragons.
It's started of with Wizard of Earthsea, a book showed me that you don't need great amount page to write a great epic fantasy book.
You get to know everything you need about the world in 200 pages.Third book was epic adventure and while great on it's own, it's weakest Earthsea book.Original trilogy is great and remains my first choice to people looking to get into fantasy.
Second half of the series came later and it was much more focused on character development and has strong feminist voice.The 4th book, Tehanu, is highlight of the series and one of the best fantasy books I read.

Don't get me wrong, the dragons are great and the whole introduction of new characters and getting back to the King and to the question of Ged and the role of women in this world is pretty good, but the best part is the return to the dry lands, the realm of the dead.As before, there's a balance between wizards and dragons, and all of this becomes even more pronounced as the reveals keep coming, as we learn mankind's place in the world and where we fit into the scheme of things along with our dragon brothers.Pretty cool stuff, really.
The whole thing is brought to an unexpected and wonderful conclusion.This feels much more like the original three books than either of the two later ones but it does still lack the sense of exploration I prize so highly that is found in A Wizard of Earthsea and The Final Shore, which leads me back to the beginning of the review; this is the last of Earthsea and there are somethings I could wish had happened somewhere along the way, that didn't: Ged travels far and wide in the course of his stories but we never sail the North Reach with him or explore Hogen land.
Reading the books of Earthsea is like opening a series of nesting dolls in reverse.
Fleshed into being in The Tombs of Atuan, Tenar shows us how the magic of Earthsea's women reaches deeper than the skill of the mages and into the elemental power of the dragons.
Featuring a wider cast of characters than the previous volumes, the last book brings together everything we have learned about Earthsea to change the foundations of the world.Truly the master Patterner, Le Guin gives us something mythic in reach and universal in meaning.
La lectura de este libro de Terramar no ha sido tan satisfactoria como con los volúmenes anteriores. En mi opinión, no aporta nada nuevo a la saga y difiere bastante con lo que llevaba leído. Me sucedió la primera vez que lo leí, y me he vuelto a pasar.
Other themes that’ve been a big part of the books previously (the role of women, for example) are still here, now integral to the world where perhaps they weren’t in time for A Wizard of Earthsea and Yarrow.It wasn’t my favourite of the series when I first read it — I think I have to concede I love the first two books most and always will, though Tehanu and The Other Wind are growing on me — but reading it this time, it seems like a very fitting ending point.
Then I read -Techanu- and thought it was more like an interlude with a plot added in at the end for good measure.
-Stories of Earthsea- was barely passable and now this -The Other Wind- left me with a final bad taste for a series I loved for a long time.It was nice to hang out with some old friends (Ged, Tenar etc...) but at some point toward the end it started this downward spiral into incomprehensibility.
Was it some type of literary experiment?I'm not sure, but my final stance on Earthsea is: Read the first 3 books and pretend the others don't even exist.
Yerdeniz'in son kitabı hakkındaki düşüncelerimi kelimelere tam olarak dökemeyeceğim.
Seriyi bitirmem yıllar sürdü, ara vererek okudum.
İlk kitapları düşünüyorum da, Yerdeniz Büyücüsü'ndeki Ged, Atuan Mezarları'ndaki Tenar...
Son kitaptaki hallerine göre ne kadar farklılardı.
Yaşlandıklarını okurken onlarla bir yaşlandım, görüp geçirmiş bir ruh haline büründüm.
Her şeyi oluruna bırakıp, korunun ötesini seyrettim, batının da batısında uçan ejderhaları düşledim.
Yerdeniz'i herhangi bir seriyi bitirir gibi bitirmedim çünkü kitaplar boyunca yaşananlar; büyümek, yaşamak, ölmek, kadın ve ejderha olmak içimde bir yere işlendi.
Ve içimize işleyen yerdenizler bir olup ejderhalara dönüşerek batınında batısında esen rüzgarda raks edecekler, bir gün bizim de gideceğimiz diyarlarda.
Of course, UKL's words are glorious no matter where or when one comes to them, but oh, how these words burn.
Meditations on life and death, on women and men, on dragonkind and humankind, on mage and commoner.
And of course, this:“I think," Tehanu said in her soft, strange voice, "that when I die, I can breathe back the breath that made me live.
I can give them back to the world.
I can give them back to the world.
That will be my gift back to the world that gave me the life I did live, the love I loved, the breath I breathed.”
The Other Wind ≥ Tehanu ≥ The Tombs of Atuan > Tales from Earthsea > ... > A Wizard of Earthsea > The Farthest Shore.(The Other Wind is greater than or equal to Tehanu, which is greater than or equal to The Tombs of Atuan, which is greater than Tales from Earthsea, which is several orders of magnitude greater than A Wizard of Earthsea, which is greater than The Farthest Shore.)THAT IS ALL.
I really enjoyed the series, although I thought this last book was the weakest.
One thing I enjoyed was that we had the chance to revisit a lot of favorite characters from past books in addition to meeting some new ones.
A lot of plot threads from the various books were brought up and woven into a bigger picture.
The problem is that I thought that bigger picture was blurry.
Ο Άλντερ, βυθισμένος στη θλίψη μετά το θάνατο της γυναίκας του, αρχίζει και βλέπει όνειρα που τον φέρνουν σε επαφή με τις ψυχές της άγονης γης.
Αναζητώντας βοήθεια, οδηγείται αρχικά στον Κίρκο και από εκεί στην Τενάρ, την Τεχανού και στη συνέχεια την Ίλιαν, τη γυναίκα-δράκο που εισήγαγε η Λε Γκεν στο προηγούμενο βιβλίο.
Οι Χάρντικ και οι Καργκ, μάγοι, θνητοί και δράκοι καλούνται όλοι να παίξουν το ρόλο τους και να επανέρθει ο κόσμος στην ισορροπία.
Η συγγραφέας αγγίζει ξανά το θέμα του θανάτου και της αναγέννησης και κλείνει το έπος της Γαιοθάλασσας, χωρίς να αφήνει καμιά εκκρεμότητα για τους χαρακτήρες και τον κόσμο τους.
The first time I tried to read it, I don't think I had, and I had no idea who Orm Irian was or why she was significant.One thing that I disliked in The Farthest Shore was the picture painted of death.
It's interesting to me that, at the end of The Farthest Shore she thought the series had ended, and presumably also at the end of Tehanu, but this book fits so cleanly, so clearly, as if it was intended all along.The writing is once again beautiful, in places.
While many characters that were old favorites come back for this final chapter, it never feels like Le Guin is shoehorning them in just to say hello.
Amazingly, this book not only makes itself and the series even greater, but makes previous books better in retrospect.
While Le Guin's writing is always excellent, I found the first four pages of the last chapter, where she goes through every characters dreams the night before the world is forever changed, to be one of the most beautifully written scenes in any book I've read.
Overall, there was no better way to end an already amazing series.
Ged, Tenar ve Tehanu... Gulumseyerek biten seri, ejderhalar ve kadim zamanlar. Oyle guzeldi ki... Okumadan ölmeyin!
Is it me, or is the only way someone can be a good guy in this book (maybe in all of her work--I'm not a fan) by giving up something that's vital to themselves and the people around them?
Degradation much?) So no, I'm not a fan, but Michelle West said THE OTHER WIND was the book LeGuin was born to write, and it was okay--I finished it.
And during the story and previous to the story people had to give up the core of themselves as payment so many times that it got on my nerves.
AH! PURE PLEASURE!
Woww.. The story has evolved so much. I thought Le Guin decided to write for younger audience in the first books but later 3 make you think about the society. (Like all her other books do). I won't spoil it but it was an appropriate ending.
Otra vez han pasado años entre novelas y otra vez se nota demasiado la influencia de los cambios interiores de la autora sobre la continuidad de la trama.
Este libro, mucho más filosófico que los anteriores, representa una auténtica subversión de los valores del ciclo: los dragones, que eran claramente seres caóticos y muchas veces malvados, pasan a ser espíritus superiores, un ideal en el que reflejarse.
Los malvados bárbaros de la segunda novela han sido más fieles a los compromisos de los hombres cuando se separaron de los dragones...
8/10
Embora o ritmo desta narrativa seja bastante lento e não tenha sentido aquela vontade de ir pegar no livro em qualquer momento livre (o que se reflectiu no tempo que demorei a lê-lo), continuo a gostar muito da escrita de Le Guin.Acho que é um final muito bonito para o ciclo Terramar e fiquei com pena de o ter lido tanto tempo (quase 4 anos) depois dos primeiros 4 livros desta série (não li os Contos, que penso não estarem traduzidos em português).
Almost all the books are about journeys - about finding and reconciling with your dark side, about finding freedom ( often from invisible bonds), learning to love what you are instead of what you do, learning to trust another person, and finally about shaping your destiny, rather than being defined by it.
But in the end, everything was reconciled.
The charactors lives suddenly didn't become perfect, all problems of earthsea wasn't magically solved - but balance was restored by making hard choices.
Like the book says in the end " We broke the world to make it whole.."
Duygular gerçekten şelale 😍
I understand that the dragons left, but I don't understand if Archipeligans still have dry purgatory as an afterlife, or if that's just for people who practiced magic in their lifetimes.
In that book, two people had to make a sacrifice in order for it to happen.
In the Earthsea finale, I was unsure whether magical practice was going to phase out as a result of the dragons leaving.Usually it's fine to end a book with a continued sense of mystery, but this time it seemed like a bunch of loose ends.
If you haven't read the other Earthsea books, don't start here.
If you don't have a sense of Earthsea already, much of the plot will bear less significance, be less interesting and make less sense.Weaving together so many strands from the previous Earthsea tales, this is a beautiful imaginative and inspiring story.
I wanted pages of insight into all of the characters, and much more detail on pretty much everything that happened.
What this means is that I will have to imagine the rest, and that is part of what makes it such a good book.
There are many stories to keep inventing for yourself long after you've stopped reading.
3.5TENGO una muy buena explicación de por qué leí esto antes que todo lo demásFue por errorLes juroLa cuestión es que sé que a la autora le gusta escribir novelas "spin off" de su saga de Terramar, por lo que, cuando me topé con esta preciosura en oferta, tapa dura y el apellido de la autora allí reluciendo en el medio, no dudé en comprarlo.
Además, la tapa no decía que era "Terramar #6", ni en ninguna otra parte lo aclaraba, por lo que pensé que se trataría de una novela independiente ambientada en este mundo.
Lot of sitting around and talking about stuff in this one. They talked about interesting stuff- just not a physical story as much as the others. Enjoyable & satisfying end to this EXCEPTIONAL series otherwise. I started reading the Earthsea books last September and I think the thing I've most enjoyed about them (aside from the scope of themes addressed in each book) is that they follow the characters from their childhood into their seventies.I'll miss Tenar and Ged, but I'm happy I got to know them for this long.
I'm not sure she can stay away, and I'm thinking (hoping) that someday soon we'll see a return to the Archipelago, and the magic of Earthsea.
When I first read A Wizard of Earthsea, not long ago really, I commented on the Balance of the world.
Over the course of this series that balance has been skewed, slowly but surely.
Especially because I feel like I can easily contradict myself by staying that these stories are very personal at times.
But for now know that I am satisfied with my stay in Earthsea, and hope to return.
