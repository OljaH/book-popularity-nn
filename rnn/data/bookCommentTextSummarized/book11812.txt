Chiar dacă povestea este una pentru copii și tineri, ea poate fi citită de oricine, ideea lecturii și ilustrațiile ținându-te curios până la final.Protagonistul nostru este un pui de bufniță de hambar pe nume Buf. Toți știm că bufnițele sunt niște păsări de noapte, însă Buf are frică de întuneric și nu îl înțelege.Încăpățânarea sa de a percepe frumusețea întunericului dispare pe parcurs, el fiind ajutat de o serie de personaje auxiliare care, rând pe rând, îi prezintă diversele minunății care fac nopțile speciale: focurile de artificii, sclipirea stelelor, fulgerele nopții, putința de a te ascunde, de a medita, apariția lui Moș Crăciun, etc.Nu mă așteptam să îmi placă așa mult această cărticică, și chiar mă bucur că am reușit să trăiesc clipe frumoase alături de micuțul Buf care evoluează văzând cu ochii, devenind o adevărată bufniță de hambar.Ilustrațiile mi s-au părut extrem de frumoase, hazlii și potrivite pentru poveste.
Recenzie completă: http://palarisme.ro/chef/carti/recenz...Mi-am dorit cartea de când am aflat că protagonistul este o bufniţă.
Să îţi mai spun şi de Hedwig?Buf este un pui de bufniţă de hambar care doarme noaptea şi nu se simte (încă) pregătit să plece cu părinţii săi la vânătoare.
Cum Buf nu merge la vânătoare, aşteaptă în cuib sosirea „adulţilor”, devorând toată prada adusă.
Mănâncă orice.
Mănâncă tot.
Nu pare să observe că părinţii lui sunt din ce în ce mai obosiţi, că tatăl său îşi pierde răbdarea, iar mama sa vrea să doarmă, în loc să călătorească împreună cu el prin lume, la revărsarea zorilor.
Tomlinson's 1968 well-loved little book of an owl who would rather be out during the day than the night, is charming.
Each chapter has little Plop sent off by his parents (who I adored for their subtle humour) to find out why the dark can be a good thing.
Although my eldest (4) was instantly drawn to the repetitive element of the chapters (who will Plop meet next), he was also tickled by Plop's nature: inquisitive, innocent, silly and quirksome.
It didn't take him long to notice that Plop's descent from the trees gradually improves or that each person Plop met, taught him something about the night: this structure was a comforting aspect of the narrative for him.
I had bought it as a gift for a kid because of another review, and thought I could give it a read to see if it makes a good present.This book follows Plop the baby owl, an unusual night bird - he's afraid of the dark - and the little adventures he goes on in order to overcome his fear of darkness.
These characters teach him small lessons and show him reasons not to fear the darkness: the fireworks, the fun, the stars.As a character, Plop the little owl is adorable, and so are the illustrations of him.
e musai de citit cand sufeltul pereche este bufnita :Ddaaa, e o carte simpatica pentru copii
O poveste frumoasă, inteligentă despre frica de întuneric. Cred că ar putea fi o alternativă excelentă de a risipi teama micuților de întuneric, o terapie prin povestea de noapte -bună ,drăgălașenia lu Buf simplificând totul :)
Aveam nevoie de o carte ca aceasta, mă gândeam că o să fie ceva boooooring, dar Buf este o bufniţă tare agitată și plină de viaţă.❤
Cea mai drăguță bufniță din lume. :D
Plop goes home tells Mrs Barn Owl the news but still doesn't like the dark AT ALL but he does decide to hang his sock up when Christmas Eve arrives.When his parents are out hunting the following day, Plop flies down to see a man with a telescope who tells him that dark is wonderful as when it is dark he can see lots of stars in the sky and he points out such as the bright Pole Star and Orion the Great Hunter along with many others.
Great for year 3/4. Lots of illustrations to keep children engaged. Provides a large scope for comprehension tasks i.e. creating their own chapter spinning off or adding to the story.
Plop is a comical name for the main character of a children's book, from my experience of reading this story in school to children they are absolutely drawn in from the beginning right till the very end.
It was a really useful book for the children to link what they have been learning about in Geography and Science with Light & Dark to what happened in the story with Plop, and it could also link with children's fears of the dark and explaining to them all the positives that happen and that they will see when it is dark outside.
I remembered this vaguely from childhood, and bought a copy for my son for us to read together.It could be a lovely warm and helpful read for children scared of the dark, but for any child, animal books are a hit, and to read about an owl being afraid of his natural environment is a novel idea and intriguing.My son didn't sound keen when we started, but very soon warmed to the main character.
It certainly helped that he had the name 'Plop'!Plop's parents are rather nonplussed that their (barn owl) son is afraid of the dark, won't come out at night, won't go hunting with them.
I like Plop’s landing style.
Plop is extremely cute and of all the strangest things he is afraid of the dark.
I like the way Paul Howards illustrates young Plop and the way Jill Tomlinson uses lots of spoken words and introduces many characters.
This book has a really nice twist to it as most Owls are nocturnal.
Why is an Owl a nocturnal creature?
Discuss some other real life nocturnal creatures?
In the end of the story Plop discovers many marvels of the dark and concludes that the dark is 'super', as is this book.
He simply hates it, but his mother and father are tired of him always waking them up during the day (when they are, of course, fast asleep) and asking them to feed his never-ending appetite."So Plop shut his eyes, took a deep breath, and fell off his branch."Plop is no good at landing, so he mostly just falls.
He visits various people and animals and asks them about the darkness and in turn, they each give him a reason why the darkness is not a foe but instead a friend.
Bella la discussione "I libri della vostra infanzia".
Mi ricordo solo che la presenza di alcune illustrazioni tra un capitolo e l'altro.
Forse un vasetto di inchiostro che si svuotava.E mi ricordo anche la trama.
Un gufetto che incontra altri animaletti e riesce a farsi passare la sua paura.
Scusate lo spoiler sull'imprevedibile finale.Libro consigliato solo a chi non ha mai letto un libro in vita sua, oppure a chi lo ha letto tra i suoi primi libri e vuole riprenderlo in mano.Ed ovviamente libro consigliato a chi ha paura del buio.Grazie a Moloch per il salto nell'infanzia.
We were reading this book as an ending to our science lesson (light and dark).
I think young children can really relate to the story as they may not like the dark and are afraid.
The book shows how dark can be fun and how it can be related to different events such as Christmas.
Not forgetting I love the way how the author describes the different ways Plop lands.
All the children in my class loved this book and had a good giggle when they heard the name.
The little owl goes on a journey meeting different people and a friendly cat who tell the owl how the dark is ok it is exciting, kind, fun, fascinating etc to help him overcome his fears of the dark.
The owl learns more about the dark and is not affraid anymore, when he returns home he tells his mum and dad Mr Barnowl his adventure.
Nice story read this with my son who is 7 years and also does not like the dark very much, so we had lots of conversation about his feelings which helped.
A good book for little one’s who are afraid of the dark, will have them cured in 7 days!  The story is about a young barn owl called Plop, who is terrified of the dark. The plot is divided into seven little chapters. Through each chapter Plop learns something new about the dark: dark is exciting, dark is kind, dark is fun, dark is necessary, dark is fascinating, dark is wonderful ... and dark is beautiful. Plop isn't convinced immediately, but by the seventh night he's looking at the dark through new eyes! He is no longer afraid!
A truly brilliantly written children's book.
The Owl who was afraid of the dark starts with the intro to Plop who wants to be a day bird and his mother tries to convince him that the dark is better.
She tells him to talk to the people who are around and find out their views.
Dark is beautiful, necessary, kind are just some of the opinions he drums up from people.
Although the book is written for children, as an adult I truly appreciated how the story was crafted.
Don't miss reading this book to see how ordinary words can create a magic...
It's a children's book but I've only just listened to it and I loved it. It's really funny. I bet you have never encountered a clumsier, more naive, annoying and yet lovable little owl (barn owl, that is). More reasons to give it a try? The owl's name is Plop (!) and he "wobbles" a lot (it's my favourite English word, amuses me every time I hear it).
O cărțulie educativă și amuzantă, potrivită pentru un copil-cititor începător, asta pe lângă megacunoscutele basme ale lui Petre Ispirescu.
but I think it’s a classic that would be welcomed and loved by Y1 children today.
Way back in the 1990s past I think I successfully used this story as part of a ‘Light and Dark’ theme - we made a dark cave out of a massive cardboard box, used all of our problem solving skills to exclude as much light from inside as we could and then took torches and coloured filters and lenses and mirrors inside to explore - and I think we went on to The Hodgeheg (Dick King-Smith) to extend the nocturnal animals theme....
I vaguely remember a visit from a mystery cave-dwelling creature too - I think he left footprints and a letter and a written dialogue between children and creature ensued....
Poor Plop, a baby barn owl who is very much unlike all other barn owls; he's afraid of the dark. His parents, unable to convince him to go hunting with them and to conquer his fears. Instead they send him down to meet humans and seek their views of the darkness that takes over.
Though others think the dark is exciting, kind, fun, necessary, wonderful and beautiful, Plop doesn't think so because he is terrified of the dark. However, after several interactions with others, he concludes that DARK IS SUPER!
A book FOR children... 😶
One of my childhood favourites! My copy was read until it fell apart, then sellotaped together and read some more! Lovely book.
Plop’s patient parents, Mr and Mrs Barn Owl, try their best to gently encourage him to change his perception and join them on their night flights and hunting but Plop’s detest for the dark has made him adamant on aspiring to become a day bird!Jill Tomlinson cleverly names each chapter after a good quality about the dark: dark is exciting; kind; fun; necessary; fascinating; wonderful; and beautiful.
It can be filled with patterns of stars, especially shooting stars, the bright moon, the point that the dark can be exciting because it can mean fireworks will be able to be seen vividly, such as golden rain and Catherine-wheels.
In the end Plop overcomes his fear of the dark and can proudly call himself a night bird.I found the book to be a very fluid read, which could be to do with the conversational style it was written in.
Combined with some good moments of humour, mainly to do with Plops naivety, the story flowed well and was not a struggle to read at all.
I would recommend this book for children aged 6-7 particularly as the main character shares a common fear with young children, being afraid of the dark.
He soon learns that it's not as bad as he thought and he makes new friends along the way.
The story follows the same pattern throughout each short chapter, and there is use of repetition in the chapters in the way Plop greets his new friends and the way he feedbacks to his mother at the end of each of his adventures.It is a lovely story that can be read independently by children 7years plus and read to younger children.Moral of the story is that when you know more about something it's not as scary as you thought it would be.A lovely read.
A wonderful story about a little Barn owl called Plop who is afraid of the dark.
Plop meets many people and animals in the story that help him to see the wonder of the night-time and darkness.
By the end of the story Plop is a happy night bird, hunting with Mummy owl and Daddy owl.
There were a few things, aside from the story itself, which I really loved about this book.
The second thing was the repetition - Chapter titles, names Plop is called and Plop's exclamation at the end of each chapter - 'I do not like it AT ALL!' The repetition will help young children remember the story and makes the book fluid to read aloud.
