So, I could deeply sympathize with Ann, the protagonist of this story.And it turns out that her worst threat is not the aftermath of the nuclear war.
These are all very pertinent issues to Ann in this book, and I had to work through them as I read.
The issues of isolation, fear for the future, defining who one is when the world is no longer the same, and having control of one's life and destiny were very well-handled here.
I think Ann could be a metaphor for any young woman who is facing choices in her life that will define her present and future.
I think of Lucifer's Hammer or the other later classics of post-apocalyptic nightmares that came out later like The Stand and Swan Song and so many others, but here's the gorgeous bit:This one scales down everything into a tight little pocket of a farm that escaped the devastation of the nukes leaving one teenage girl alone after the rest of the family goes off and succumbs to one of any number of perils.
A man.The rest of the novel is all about them.
The man takes, the woman either succumbs, herself, or she fights for her freedom.
This is one of those books you read when you're in middle school, but you never forget about it. In fact, I've been ceaselessly frightened of radiation poisoning every since. Sort of like my plague fears, which developed immediately after I read the first chapter of Albert Camus's The Plague. If you didn't read this then, you ought to read it now; it's really fantastic.
I haven't been able to find out how much he'd written before he died and how much work they had to do, but I think it's pretty rude not to credit them on the cover rather than hiding their labors in the "about the author" note.Okay, time for some spoilers.This is a very strange book.
I'd be happy to spend tens of pages on how Ann Burden, a sixteen-year-old farm girl, is keeping from starving and freezing to death.Trouble is, I'm hearing plenty about the combating starving and freezing, and precious little about how she feels.
My Loomis should have been dead right away when Ann saved him, I wanted Ann to shoot him, and so the book could have at least been good.
I do not recommend this book to other readers, unless you want to read a very very very boring book that made no sense, and that Ann should have killed Mr. Loomis right away, would have made the story a lot better, but instead they author had to continue the story with Ann taking care of Mr. Loomis.
I am also pretty sure that most of the students would rather do that then read very very very very boring books.
Yeah. That’s how this one is going to go. The expectations were high with this one. I first discovered this book when I found out it was being made into a movie so of course I was all about getting the book read first. Especially when I realized this author also wrote one of my favorites of all time:  The Secret of Nimh . Naturally I couldn’t find a copy anywhere but FINALLY! Some luck blew my way and my library came through. I started it immediately. I finished it within 24 hours. And now I’m s
She retreats to a nearby cave with her dog Faro to monitor the individual and determine whether or not to let him know there’s one other survivor besides him.John Loomis is a scientist from New York.
Unfortunately, the stream that flows into that lake was still affected by radiation and he falls deathly ill.Spoilers, ahoy!(view spoiler)[So Anne decides she can’t hide in her cave while she watches quite possibly the last man on Earth slowly die from the contaminated water.
At the end he finally gets Faro to follow her scent and the dog is about to lead him right to the cave.
She’s strong, determined, and kind hearted all the way through the novel, there’s never any doubt who is in the right and who is in the wrong.I also love the progression the characters take throughout this novel.
At the end of the day, I think this is a bit of a feminist novel… I don’t want to say much more incase you haven’t read it and want to, but let’s just say it’s about a young teenage girl overcoming more than just the aftermath of nuclear war.
I really enjoy post-apocalyptic stories. I really liked the narrator and her ability to survive alone. But when I finished reading all I could think was I am so tired of bullying men. Tired of them in my movies, tired of them in my books, tired of them in the news and tired of them in my government.
Keeping that time frame in mind, the way that sixteen year old Ann deals with the loss of her family and the events that follow are nothing short of amazing.
Ann, having lost her mother, father and two brothers, finds a way to not only go on, but build a life for herself at her family home in a valley that was remarkably saved from some of the fallout.
This is an amazing young adult novel that shows the strengths and weaknesses, the humanity and the horrors of what life could be like following such a devastating event.
The plot sees a young girl – sixteen years old – who is left in an isolated valley after a nuclear holocaust.
That old line/joke/insult saying: “I wouldn’t marry you if you were the last man on Earth.” Well, what happens when there are only two of you on Earth and what exists between you is nervous mistrust and outright hostility.
What follows is a supreme battle of wills – a young girl against a strange man for possession of what is essentially the whole worldIt’s a wonderfully powerful piece of work – frightening and disturbing, with only the faintest glimmer of hope.
In the Old Testament, three tales of human frailty follow the creation of the world; Adam and Eve, Cain and Able, Noah and the ark.
In Z for Zachariah, Robert O'Brien novelizes the end of the world with a similar set of stories; in place of Noah's ark we have an anti-radiation suit designed just in time for the nuclear holocaust.
The lone human inhabitant of the valley is Ann Burden, a resourceful farm girl who has her hands full tending her animals and crops but still finds time to pray, though she's not always sure why.
Adão ou Lobo Mau?Ann, uma jovem de 16 anos que sobreviveu num vale-mini-éden a um holocausto nuclear é uma Eva sem Adão.Um belo dia avista ao longe uma corrente de fumo, que parece caminhar na sua direcção.Virá aí o seu Adão?Infelizmente, Não!...Ao contrário de Ann, que se manteve mentalmente sã, o seu recente companheiro está psiquicamente afectado e em vez dum potencial Adão, mostrou-se mais próximo do Lobo Mau.Após a Sobrevivência Física, a Psicológica!Qual delas a mais árdua?!...Nota: Na capa, estão retratadas 3 pessoas.
Não obstante, este é um bom livro e ao que parece, bem melhor que o filme!
Excellent book; the real horror of it isn't the nuclear devastation, but the feeling of being stalked and having no one around to help you get away. At first Mr. Loomis is a likeable character but he quickly takes a turn for the creepy, and that's when this book gets really intense.
I just re-read this amazing book that I've had for a long time.
The first time I read it was when I was in 4th grade because my sister had read it.
I found it boring.
I read it again in 7th and understood it better than I had in 4th grade.
And now, for 12th grade, it's just plain awesome.
I can't say anymore, cause it will ruin the terrifying suspense of this book.
I recommend it to anyone who likes suspenseful books.
Basically, the book exemplifies the meaning of being truly alone, isolated and preyed upon.
Awesome book.
** Mild spoilers **I'm surprised, I actually really liked this book!
And then one day a man in a plastic suit pulling a wagon covered in more plastic arrives.
Ann is suspicious, in the few weeks before the last radio station died, there was much reporting about people going insane in their desperation for survival.
So Ann hides for a few days until the man makes a mistake and swims in a poisonous river, and then gets extremely sick.
** Mild Spoiler **However, the man is not all that he seems...
This is a book about survival, fear and hope and how these three things can change people.
It's a genuinely scary read, and easy to understand why it's such a classic tale to be shared with the next generations.And now, a word about the film:(view spoiler)[SPOILERS: Ann's character has been aged up, "Caleb" is nowhere to be found in the book, and the film's heavier on Christianity (it's much lighter in the novel).
As for Ann trying to seduce Loomis in the film, I'm so angry about that.
When a character is almost raped in a book, but in the film she tries to seduce the guy...
That's not Ann's character, and I can't help but wonder if the film wrote in "Caleb", too, to sex up the story.
Disappointed to learn Hollywood got its hands on this book and made it into a shitty movie.
If you're going to read this book keep in mind there isn't a love triangle in it nor is it a love story.
For the love of all that is holy, do not pick up this book thinking you're going to be reading a modern YA post-apocalyptic novel and then be all disappointed about the fact that it isn't all about sex.
I swear to Iesha I'm going to bitchslap the first moron who writes a bad review of this book simply because it's nothing like the movie.
She had been surviving in a secluded valley until another stranger showed up in her peaceful domain, one that she helped restore to health and offered the hospitality of her home.
This man, in turn, tried to attack her, took over her house, and even shot her.I seesawed between admiration and disgust at Ann's actions.
On the other hand, I thought her idea of continuing to work the farm and and offering to split the food with the stranger even after he attacked her as totally foolish.
Even her hesitation to kill the dog, though understandable, was a little misguided.
From the moment Ann first sees smoke rising from beyond the valley, each development wrenches her further and further from the life she's adjusted to--seemingly for good, and then with terrible consequences.
The personal details and unflinching descriptions of life after a nuclear war make the story even more gripping.
While the story leaves this somewhat open-ended, Ann's ultimate victory will make them cheer.
Readers will be on her side from the beginning, even as they struggle to imagine how they would feel in her place.
Z FOR ZACHARIAH is a story that will haunt readers long after they've put down the book.
I read this in my 6th or 7th grade english class. It is a wonderful story about one girls struggle to survive after a tragic event. I learned that you can not count on everyone to be there for you all of the time, that you have to be independant or else you will most likely will not it if you were to lose everyone.
Z for Zachariah (1975), which is a Post-Holocaust novel of considerable sensitivity, a solitary surviving adolescent girl comes to realize that she cannot make a life with a male survivor who has entered her quiet valley and attempts to take control; she eludes his attempt at rape and travels across the desolated landscape in search of other survivors. It is a fine book, morally complex and not simply a story of good versus evil; the girl's victory is ambiguous.
I think I'll shoot my dog that I've known and loved my entire life instead of even trying to take a shot at him...because that would just be dumb.
Even the dog prefers to obey men than women, and the girl accepts that.
Needless to say I didn't much enjoy the book since it kinda riled me up with thoughts of slapping some sense into that dumb girl (even at 16 I had more sense than that) and slapping some handcuffs on that psycho.
Wait, this is a YA/MG book?? Definitely couldn't have figured that out from the movie (which I am loving btw).

I recently saw the movie of this book and really liked it.
Mankind has once again tried to destroy itself and there is one person left alive, at least that's what she thinks.
So I picked up the book from my local library.
Book started the same as the movie but after a few chapters there was a radical difference.
Maybe it wasn't such a good idea to see the movie first!
But, then again, I would not have read the book if not for the movie.
Just a three star for me.
I liked it but I liked the movie better.
If you want to know about this book I suggest you read it and don't pay any attention to the movie, 
From a secret hiding spot Ann watches as a man comes to the valley, and this issue raises a whole new set of questions regarding her survival.
Where did he come from?And most importantly, can she trust him?Trust and fear are big themes within the story.
Control and power also come into play.
But again, I think that's because I would have liked to have seen Ann take a different course of action, even though I know it would have been out of character for her.
Yes, I know, it comes down to how people respond differently, but still.
Her valley is safe, somehow protected from the nuclear disaster that has wiped out the rest of the world by some sort of weather formation.
When John Loomis shows up in her valley, wearing a safe suit that protects him from radiation, Ann is cautious.
At first, she is glad to have human company, but her joy soon turns to fear as it becomes clear that John Loomis is a tyrant who will not be satisfied unless he is in control - of the valley, of the house, and of her.
John Loomis, seen through her eyes, is a fascinating and frightening - is the word villain?
4.5⭐Na informação extra deste livro, podemos saber que quando o autor faleceu não tinha terminado de escrever esta historia.
Este tipo de informação pode deixar-nos um pouco reticentes ao iniciarmos a leitura.
Alias eu nunca percebi que a narrativa tinha sido escrita por três pessoas diferentes.
Sendo um livro com menos de 200 paginas pensei que pudesse não ser tao bem sucedido, ou seja, que fosse super acelerado e que os acontecimentos fossem explicados demasiado rápidos.
Mas mais uma vez este livro surpreendeu me.
Adorei a forma como o autor nos quis contar a historia.
Sem duvida, um dos melhores livros que li este ano.
Recommended by Laurel-Leaf in The Turning Place: Stories of a Future Past.... On p. 41 I'm actually sort of bored, as it seems much like a generic old dystopia. I was also dismayed to learn that family finished this from draft & notes posthumously.....Almost done, want to say that it's certainly discussable. For example, (view spoiler)[has Loomis so paranoid he's stupid, or does he just have bad social skills? Maybe he's mildly autistic? Being kind to the girl would have worked so much better.... (hide spoiler)]....Done. Good book. Especially for its time, but still enjoyable now.
