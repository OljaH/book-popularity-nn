:DThe story in HERO is about a woman, Lexie, who ends up working for a powerful man, Caine, with whom she shares a painful family history.
I'm certainly not excusing or dismissing all his mistakes, but I'm saying that I understood what prompted them.I really loved that Caine and Lexie's past "connection" was revealed right at the beginning of the book...
It really got me right inside these characters' minds and allowed me to perfectly visualize the whole story as I read.Despite Caine's goal to make her life miserable, Lexie was equally determined to get through to him and show him that she was different than her family.
"Of course, I'd just agreed to a no-string-attached affair with him, so I guessed I shouldn't hold out for silly little important things like affection." No you shouldn't."I already wanted more from him and we were only five minutes into our casual fling."➸ Look, I'm trying very hard to stay calm here and not yell at you or shake you because I know you'll make him love you.
▩ Even if the guy tells you a ridiculous amount of times that he doesn't love you, that's a lie.
4 stars! I love that Samantha Young writes stories that are more than just romance- they always have something special. With Hero- it had that combination of angst, suspense, humor and the perfect amount of steaminess. It was one of those books that had a hero you loved to hate at times, but usually they are my favorite type of guys!Alexa Holland is an assistant to a popular photographer. Her life has changed majorly in the last few months. When she first meets Caine Carraway, things don’t go as
It was one of those books that had a hero you loved to hate at times, but usually they are my favorite type of guys!Alexa Holland is an assistant to a popular photographer.
Even though she knows this job will be rough, it’s her way of letting Caine get to know the real her.
Caine does everything in his power to make Alexa’s life difficult.
I loved watching Caine and Alexa’s relationship grow.
Alexa and Caine made me laugh out loud more than once.Alexa was the type of heroine I love.
Title: HeroSeries: StandaloneAuthor: Samantha YoungRelease Date:  February 3, 2015Rating: 5 starsCliffhanger:. No HEA:  (view spoiler)[ Yes (hide spoiler)]I am very happy that I could start of my new year with Samantha Young’s book. Hero was on my anxiously waiting for list so you cannot even imagine how excited I was when I started reading Alexa and Caine’s story. I hoped and prayed for the best. I really didn’t want this book to disappoint me, my heart wouldn’t handle this bitter regret. Fortu
Hero was on my anxiously waiting for list so you cannot even imagine how excited I was when I started reading Alexa and Caine’s story.
It is a tad bit different from On Dublin Street Series; I would say it’s more complicated and complex, yet at the same time, I got everything I loved from it.Alexa Holland and Caine Corroway share a secret.
The lusty looks, sexy comments and great flirtation made this book very hot read.
I certainly hope every fan of Samantha’s sexy and heartwarming reads would fall in love with Hero as hard and strong as me.
4.25 Stars  The only thing I was starting to predict was that if I did by some miracle find a way to make Caine see who I really was, I was almost positive that I wasn't going to come out of it unscathed.  There is nothing better for me than a hate to love trope. Nothing. I eat it up and ask for seconds and thirds. I will never get enough of it. Add into that equation a brooding business man and a fantastic heroine and you've got yourself a recipe for a terrific read!If you're a fan of Samantha
Unfortunately her impulsive decision doesn't quite pan out the way she wants when the only reaction she gets from Caine is disgust and the loss of her job in the process.Lexie is definitely one tough cookie.
She'll no longer be jobless, but she'll work for him...Caine is a very intense character and he definitely doesn't shy away from making Lexie feel like she's below him.
Caine was a straight up asshole at times, and Lexie always pushed his buttons right back.
This one’s a fun, sexy, yet at-times emotional enemies-to-lovers office romance that just about had a little bit of everything sprinkled in the story, and is a winner for me!So a little bit about the story…the heroine Alexa Holland is an assistant to a famous photographer and in one of those shoots, meets the hero Caine Carraway, an aloof CEO who shares a twisted and messed up past with her.
The only reason I’m not giving it five starts is because some attitudes of the hero and his constant indecision, which in my opinion brought a lot of unnecessary angst to a book that already had enough drama.
Yes, there are a few moments where Alexa can almost be considered a doormat, and believe me, in those moments I just wanted to beat the heck out of her, but she was relentless in proving her love and that was something pretty good to see.
The chemistry between Alexa Holland and Caine Carraway is off the charts hot.
The two of them cannot be in the room with each other without fireworks going off despite Caine's obvious dislike for Alexa.
Another thing I liked about this book was Alexa.
Have some respect!" But...I couldn't call her a doormat either because I think Ms. Young did a phenomenal job giving me her back story.
I am also forgiving toward heroes who run hot-and-cold throughout the book.
But...Caine rejected Alexa too many times...too many.
The chemistry and connection between Caine and Alexa kept me flipping the pages until the very end.
4.25 Stars "...sometimes you've got to let yourself be vulnerable even when it's the scariest thing in the world." Samantha Young delivered a hot well-paced story with an added element of secrets and mystery. I adored both main characters and the secondary characters, Effy and Henry. To my surprise, I even loved the push and pull of their relationship. The sexual tension was well done and seriously that office sex scene was crazy hot. This is the story of Alexa Holland coming face to face with t
This is the story of Alexa Holland coming face to face with the man whom her family wronged so many years ago.
And I’m also a very busy man.
As for her estranged family they play a part in the secrets and oh yeah… Cain’s got a secret himself.Their banter, sexual tension and sex scenes were palpable…Overall, this was a good read that was hot and steamy with likable characters and a few good twists.
I also really loved that epilogue great job Ms. Young!
I’m not looking for a great adventure.
It's been a while since I've read something about sexy millionaire.
He was my kind of asshole hero, he acted like a douche but deep down you knew he cared, and it was enough to like him even though he didn't deserve it at times.
"I keep waiting to not feel like this, because there are times I can't bear it.
Overall, great story with a bit angst, some sexy times, sassy heroine, asshole hero that is not that asshole in the end, recommended for all Samantha Young fans.
I'm not looking for a great adventure.
You are my great adventure."
With a premise that I enjoy almost every time, enemies to lovers, “Hero” it's an angsty, steamy read that for sure will hold your attention.Our heroine, Alexa, works as a personal assistant for Benito, a famous photographer.
Alexa wants for Caine to see her, to see she’s nothing like her father, she wants somehow to be there for him.
She sees the real Caine, she sees in him what he doesn’t, she knows for sure he deserves happiness as much as she does and she tries to make Caine admit that he loves her back.I really enjoyed this story.
“I fantasize about f*cking you in this office a hundred times a day.”  You know you’ve really liked a book when you find yourself re-reading it four times in the span of a month! At first glance, the premise of this book might appear to be just another billionaire-falls-for-the-girl-next-door scenario, and you might walk into this story expecting nothing more than some good ol’ smutty fluff with great chemistry between the characters and a few blazing sex scenes. But you would be wrong. Becaus
I loved their banter, I loved the energy between them, whether they were fighting or getting tangled between the sheets, every scene they shared being a delectable delight start to finish.Caine Carraway and Alexa Holland are apparent strangers to one another, but their lives have been tragically connected from a very young age.
While Alexa sees how great they truly are together and wishes for more, Caine remains an impenetrable fortress of emotions, his past making him blind to what is right in front of him.
After reading "Hero" this author has gained my respect for not only talented writing; but being able to capture my attention with highly entertaining characters who take a love and hate relationship to a whole new level!
Considering the world is a small place, our heroine meets up with the man who has been hurt by her dad, and this man is not willing to even look at Lexie..let alone talk to her.
I was able to over look a lot of his mean ways because deep down he just was terrified to learn that he isn't good enough.
4 stars!   “You’re the one real thing in my life right now … You should know I don’t want to let that go.”   Samantha Young is one of my all time favorite authors. Even when her books aren't my favorite, I've never given her anything less than 4 stars because she delivers the perfect romance books that work for me.  Hero  follows in the footsteps of her other books as a highly addictive, angst inducing, well written romance.Alexa Holland grew up believing her dad was a hero. That is, until she
One day on set, Alexa comes face to face with the man whose life was ruined by her father, Caine Carraway.
It was a bit sad to continually read Alexa getting her hopes up about a real relationship with Caine knowing as the reader that he wasn't ready yet.
For all of you out there who love steamy scenes, get your fans ready to help cool you off.This was a 5 star read for me all the way up until about 80%.
Alexa and Caine were so well developed and complicated and it just made me love them all the more for it.

After college, Caine started Carraway Financial Holdings, & opened a private bank which he has expanded on over the years.
Caine & Alexa are suddenly thrown together by circumstances & even though he harbors this misplaced hostility towards her, he can't help how attracted he is to her & how much he wants her.
;)) LOVE me some Caine Carraway!

In fact, I seemed to have a little love/hate for Alexa myself.
I did however love the writing, certain scenes, the emotional side of things and the little bits of humour and wit here and there.
Now jobless and desperate to stay in her expensive apartment, Alexa agrees to put up with his bad moods and contempt and is eager to make amends with him for her father's mistakes.Caine hates that he is attracted to her but Alexa is determined to make him see her for who she really is and not just someone associated with all the pain that her father caused him._ _ _ _I really enjoyed the first half of the book, the Love/Hate theme and the sexual tension was delicious and you could feel the chemistry between them which further increased every time they failed to resist each other.
4 - 4.5 StarsI am huge fan of Samantha Young and couldn’t wait to start this new standalone about a sexy billionaire, because no matter how many times this story is told I still love reading them.
Alexa Holland knows all about Caine Carraway, not because he is a sexy playboy, but because he is collateral damage to his father’s mistakes.
Alexa is not your average heroine she is open, honest, and can’t wait to tell Caine the truth about her.
This story is so different from what Young usually writes, but I loved it just the same.
As I started reading the book, I kept wondering what everyone saw in this story that I couldn't see.
At 56% I still haven't found anything that makes me want to keep reading so I have decided to move on to a book I might actually like.
She lets Caine control her life when she goes to work for him.
When Alexa speaks up for herself, Caine says that she has a smart mouth.
When I read a story, I need to find something that will make me want to keep reading and I just cannot find it in the book.
5 I love me some Caine StarsI love the Dublin series (I’ve read every single one), but I was really happy to see a new Samantha Young book that isn’t related.I feel like Samantha Young is going back to her roots.
Caine does not like Alexa’s family and he doesn’t like Alexa.Alexa works as an assistant to a photographer, who happens to be shooting Caine.
Caine doesn’t want to work with Alexa and refuses to the do the shoot and Alexa gets fired!I love the way Hero starts out.
Very much like On Dublin Street.You get a little history to why Caine hates Alexa so much and its valid reason.
3 stars  I found this much better than the last few SY books I read. I did enjoy the sexy time and the banter was hilarious. But after halfway Caine and that stick up his ass started to bug me. I must applaud Alexa for pursuing what she wanted (she was an awesome character) but there's only so many times a guy can treat her like shit. Also his excuse felt so random.Recommend if you enjoyFun banterSmoking hot sexy timeQuirky smart ass challenging heroineJackass moody brooding rich heroOffice roma

To my absolute delight and surprise, Alexa turns my preconceived world upside down and reveals her true identity to Caine the moment she meets him.I must stop right there and acknowledge my gratitude to Ms. Young.
I knew right then this book was going to be special.Caine is so taken aback by Alexa's big reveal that he fires the photography team instantly.
I’m going to ask you to leave one more time, and if you don’t I will physically remove you.”-CaineAlexa puts aside her sassy spunk aside in order to ask Caine to help her get her job back.
Alexa and Caine working together is like fire and gasoline.
Excited to finally start this!**Buddy-read with Pavlina**

The push-pull chemistry and enemies-to-lovers interaction between Cain and Alexa was off the charts magnetic and explosive and kept me riveted.
Not having enigmatic Cain’s POV hindered the story and lessened my enjoyment because I wanted, no needed, more insight into his thoughts and actions.
The ending was satisfying, and I liked finally seeing Cain so (view spoiler)[adoring of Alexa in the epilogue (hide spoiler)].
And right now I met my first love again after so many books and times apart.Caine Carraway is an ass...
Thank God it's only a facade.Alexa Holland couldn't believe her eyes when she found Caine in the same room as her because she knows something that might send Caine over the edge if he ever found out who she is.From the beginning, I liked the fact that the story doesn't round in circles.
I wanted to at some moment but I liked the fact we only have Alexa pov.teasers from webFor more reviews
When Alexa Holland meets Caine Carraway for the first time she’s surprised and stunned.
It’s a shared connection in pain, and Alexa wants to find a way to say sorry for all he’s gone through.
I felt more connected to Alexa than Caine, which is to be expected since the story was written from her POV.
I don’t think Alexa would’ve wedged herself into Caine’s heart so deeply had she let her pride get in the way of her feelings for him.
I didn’t get much insight into what Caine was feeling or his motives beyond speculation on what Alexa experienced with him.

If you could put a face to the words Persistent and forthright, Lexie would be that face.
In terms of Caine's face, he had a few masks of his own he wore.
Indifferent, egotistical but my favourite one was the one he had with Lexie when he allowed his guard to be down.
Lexie and Caine's relationship was fraught with uncertainty and sometimes I could have easily shook them, the past that caused them friction also bound them together.
Lexie's go-getter attitude was a great character trait and one I enjoyed reading.
Sinceramente, después de haber leído otras novelas de esta misma autora, esperaba encontrar en ésta un poco de su magistral pluma, pero me he encontrado con un cliché sin sentido; tanto en el título como en el desarrollo de la historia.
ⒽⒺⓇⓄI loved it!!I didn't know what to expect - I love Sam's Edinburgh stories...but I was really looking forward to this one.
It didn't disappoint.
It wasn't really anything new.
Rich CEO Hero, heroine working for him - falling for him - lots of family problems.
Nothing I haven't read a dozen times before - but also something I've loved a dozen times before.
And I really loved Caine & Lexie.Perfect story - verrry sexy, funny, suspensy!
READ.
IT.!!!EDIT after re-reading it to prepare for VillainLOVED IT JUST THE SAME THE 2nd TIME AROUND!Adorable & very sexy love story!
Can't wait to read Henry's story now!!!
