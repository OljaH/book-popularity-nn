I'm always up for reading a Dr. Seuss book. When a little boy wakes up on a Wednesday, he figures out that everything around him has turned upside down, inside out and completely back to front. Nobody seems to recognize the change. Now it is upon the boy to discover the abnormalities and deal with it by himself. Because clearly, nobody's helping him. Simple, lucid and enjoyable. One of my favorites.
4 StarsThis was one of my favourite picture books when I was a beginner reader. In classic Dr. Seuss style this story is simplistic and fun, with illustrations that work directly alongside the story, requiring the reader to spot all the wacky things wrong in each picture.  It all began with that shoe on the wall. A shoe on a wall....? Shouldn't be there at all."
This book says it's by Dr. Seuss but it's ACTUALLY by some other guy! Underwhelming. I was barely even whelmed at all. Afterward my dad gave me this speech about how even if a book isn't our favorite we can always learn something from it. NERD ALERT. -M
Wacky Wednesday by  Dr. Seuss is one of my kids' favorite Dr. Seuss books. They are ALWAYS excited to read it. It's a whole book full of "What's wrong with this picture?" pages. There is a plot - a child wakes up noticing a shoe on a wall, and the entire Wacky Wednesday proceeds with many, many things wrong all day long. Until bedtime when things were righted, and "I even got rid of that shoe on the wall."
An ode to a really strange day12 February 2012 This is probably my favourite Dr Seuss book, having I read it many a time when I was a kid.
I guess the reason for that was because it was one of those books that you didn't just read, but actively participated in it as well.
On every page there were things out of the ordinary, and you, the reader, were to try and find as many of these 'Wacky' things as possible.
I must also admit that I have not read it in a while, and I suspect that with my rather
An ode to a really strange day12 February 2012	This is probably my favourite Dr Seuss book, having I read it many a time when I was a kid.
Basically this book is about a kid that has had a bad day.
I would probably suggest that this book is allegorical as well (allegory, as I have previously mentioned, is actually a very good way to assist a child in understanding the world around them.
The allegory here, and the lesson to be learnt, is that we will always have bad days, or Wacky Wednesdays (I heard that used that as a term for coming down off of hard drugs).
Wacky Wednesday is an "I Can Read It All By Myself Beginner Book".
The story is of a little boy who is having a "wacky Wednesday" and everywhere he goes has something wrong.This book is not only for the purpose of improving a child's reading skills it is also an activity book.
Each page has hidden objects that are "wacky".
There are more and more objects to find on each page.
By doing this it makes the child think more with each page.
This means that by the end of the book their skills have improved that much more.
I thought this was gonna be one of Dr. Seuss's short books, one that might be a bit dull. The rhyming is basic and the story is short but it was really good fun, a sort of play on a spot-the-difference puzzle. You look at the page and have to find all the odd things, teachers in roll skates, somebody walking a crocodile or chimneys in trees. It took us a while but we managed to find them all, a good puzzle book to do with your kids.
I love this book read it check out my music.ly miss.helfie follow me

LeSiege) "I Spy"-almost style book, the tale of a blonde haired boy counting all of the "wacky" and unexplainable things he could find to appear a Wednesday, that captured my attention.
The wacky situations are in numbered order (page 1 has a shoe on the wall, page 3 a working hose is cut in half, bananas grow from an apple tree, etc.) and it's not until the end (the top number being 20, easy for a child) when Patrolman McGann finishes the day with: "Just find them [the 20 wacky things left] and then you can go to bed," when the reader can close the book finished and satisfied.
It all began with that shoe on the wall. A shoe on a wall . . . ? Shouldn't be there at all!Then I looked up. And I said, "Oh, MAN!"And that's how Wacky Wednesday began.Dr. Seuss both wrote and illustrated his most famous works, but he did create a few books illustrated by others, usually using a pseudonym. He wrote Wacky Wednesday under the name Theo. LeSieg--his own name, Theodore Geisel, turned around. It was illustrated by George Booth.Wacky Wednesday tells of one Wednesday when everything
And I said, "Oh, MAN!"And that's how Wacky Wednesday began.Dr. Seuss both wrote and illustrated his most famous works, but he did create a few books illustrated by others, usually using a pseudonym.
He wrote Wacky Wednesday under the name Theo.
It was illustrated by George Booth.Wacky Wednesday tells of one Wednesday when everything was wacky: shoes on the wall, bananas growing on an apple tree, worms chasing birds, and much more.
The text of each two-page spread announces the number of things that are 'wacky' in the accompanying illustration, inviting the reader to find them all.
Some of the people around him make him feel like he is the crazy one, then he comes across someone who helps him out and let's him know he isn't quite as crazy as people try to make him out to be.
Sometimes, you feel like you're the only one going through some craziness until you run into that one person that lets you know: No, it's not just you!
Wacky Wednesday was a fun, cute read in a way that only Dr. Seuss and these types of books can be!
Another childhood favorite!
These illustrations fascinated me as a kid, and they still do!This book is a "what's wrong with this picture" story, where each page showcases a number of things that are wrong (chairs with missing legs, strollers with feet instead of wheels).
And the reader has to find them all.The rhymes are fun and the pictures a hoot!
I would love it if there were an answer key in the back, but sadly there's not.
Still, this made a huge impression on me as a kid, and looking back through the illustrations now I can see why.
Loads of fun!
I saved this one to read on a Wednesday and found it a lot of fun to pick out the wacky things on each page. My favourites were the many weird and wacky things you can do to a pram and its baby occupants.
The edition we have only lists Theo. LeSieg as author. The Dr. Seuss editions are newer. http://www.pussreboots.pair.com/blog/...
My 4-year-old loved this book! She loved looking for the wacky things on every page, and she giggled through the whole thing.
Morale of the story: Kids, don't smoke weed!
Surrealism for Beginners. My babysitters must have become so sick of reading this with me.
As the story proceeds, the number of wacky occurrences increases on every page, and soon the reader is engaged in finding and counting the wacky items on the double page spreads.
The illustrations for this book are different from those created by Dr. Seuss because this book is illustrated by George Booth.
Tension is created as the narrator encounters increasing numbers of wacky things, and as she tries to escape the wacky world, she is consoled by a police officer assuring her that her adventure is almost over.
The narrator finds every last wacky item, and wakes up to find that order in her world has been restored.
Part of my children's literature reading project.Illustrated by George Booth, one of my all-time favorite cartoonists.In this case maybe not such a great things.Ted Geisel draws quite well himself, and his classic books lack nothing in that regard that I've noticed.I'm sure this book is fine for reading to children, particularly being interactive.But perhaps not one of the author's prime products.Won't be buying this one for my grandson.
It took me forever to find this book since it was in the early reader section of our library, and not with all of the other Dr. Seuss books. Now I finally know what all the hype is about this book and why Derek's preschool and kindergarten classes were obsessed with Wacky Wednesday! This is such a fun book to read, with all of the crazy pictures, and the counting exercises throughout were a bonus!
Fun but inconsequential, similar to Where's Waldo or Dutch zoekboeks. Good for practicing spotting anomalies and counting with youngsters.(Note: 5 stars = amazing, wonderful, 4 = very good book, 3 = decent read, 2 = disappointing, 1 = awful, just awful. I'm fairly good at picking for myself so end up with a lot of 4s).
Oh my gosh, I loved this book! It was crazy fun hahaSo not only was it a sneaky way to teach counting, it actually had wacky things to look for in the illustrations! It was like an iSpy book or a Where is Waldo book.....couldn't turn the page til I found all the wacky things wrong with the pages lolTotally fun discovery by Dr. Seuss. He never disappoints 😍
Growing up I would ask my mother to read this book to me over and over. I thought it was hilarious. I would spend a lot of time trying to find all of the wacky/ unusual things in each picture. I would love to read this to a class but then encourage them to look at it on their own to truly see all the funny wacky things in the illustrations.
I have loved this book since I could read. Though the illustrations are not by Seuss, they are still funny. It is a cute counting book and the child must also be able to recognize things that can and cannot happen in the real world, i.e. a fish does not fish for people. Be advised that on one page there is the picture of the little boy showering and his backside is drawn.
This was my favorite Dr. Seuss book growing up. I even named my pet turtle after the book. Wacky Wednesday turned out to be a snapping turtle we had to release back to the Mississippi River but will remain a cherish childhood memory of mine.
Kids love this book because they can look for all the wacky mistakes on the pages. I find it a bit annoying when you have to look for 20 mistakes on one page- very difficult to keep track of them all!
This book was read to me during a spirit week in elementary school and it taught us what to wear for our very own Wacky Wednesday. I loved this book as a kid it was so funny and just out there. Another great Sues book. The appeal to these books I think are the funny pictures and rhyming.
