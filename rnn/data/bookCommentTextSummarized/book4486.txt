In this revised edition of Mr. Giedion's classic work, major sections have been added and there are 81 new illustrations./ The chapters on leading contemporary architects have been greatly expanded.
In his discussion of Le Corbusier, Mr. Giedion provides detailed analyses of the Carpenter Center at Harvard University, Le Corbusier's only building in the United States, and his Priory of La Tourette near Lyons.
There is a section on his relations with his clients and an assessment of his influence on contemporary architecture, including a description of the Le Corbusier Center in Zurich (designed just before his death], which houses his works of art.
Canonical book, for it establishes some of the upcoming "moral values" of Modern Architecture. [return]Giedion's seminal work - first appeared as "Charles Eliot Norton Lectures for 1938-1939" - belongs to a centenary tradition of Classical Rationalists such as Viollet-le-Duc or Auguste Choisy, for whom architectural history derives directly from the history of building technology.[return]It is a classical work: a must-read for anyone interested in Modern Architecture and its early history.
Rereading this - it was the first architecture text I ever read. We'll see how it stands up to the intervening 13 years.Mid Read note: I forgot how effing boring this is. Not bad, just boring. Incredibly dry.
This guy is so important its sick... A must read.
A Fantastic Architecture book that I recommend to all Architect to have a look at it.
A comprehensive history of modern architecture and the best one to gain an overview of the style.
I read an earlier edition about ten years ago. It was a superb tour of modern architecture. The tone is sharp and arrogant. An exciting book.
Still reading, but this is a classic, must read for any aspiring modernist designer. Giedion was a force to be reckoned with.
