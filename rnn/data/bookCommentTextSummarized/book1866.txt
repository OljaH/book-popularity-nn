Honestly an amazing and interesting look on the psychology behind what might lie behind the perpetrators of mass atrocities such as genocide. Though, I find Staub's summaries of what happened in his case studies to be just that--summaries, with a good deal of info left out--this is not necessarily a reflection on him, but more of an urge to others who read this to further research for themselves the case studies he uses. This is honestly such an important book.
I read this before I conducted the research paper, because of the great in depth analysis of how genocide and killing actually develops. Good for sociological studies. Great use of the examples - the Armenian Genocide, the Holocaust, Rwanda...
Pretty cool info.
