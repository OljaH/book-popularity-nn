To be always right must be sometimes monotonous.""I do not find it so," Poirot assured him.ABOUT THE BOOK: Hercule Poirot is called on to investigate the murder of a brother and sister in this classic from the Queen of Mystery.When Cora Lansquenet is savagely murdered, the odd remark she made the day before at her brother's funeral becomes chillingly important: "It's been hushed up very nicely, hasn't it.
. But he was murdered, wasn't he?"Desperate to learn more about both deaths, the family solicitor turns to detective extraordinaire Hercule Poirot to unravel the mystery.

from my blog, where it is much easier to give links, pictures and half-stars at https://clsiewert.wordpress.com/2015/...Goodness, but I’m a reading disaster when it comes to Christie books.
So that’s a sad statement of my mental affairs that I’m almost pleased by solving the murderer of a book I’ve read twice before.
That Dame sure can tell a tale, because it remained no less suspenseful.I’m working on a theory that Christie was a master mystery writer.
For me, to mix my metaphors again, it’s the difference between 17th century Dutch paintings and cubism, particularly Braque, one of my favorite painters (although not this one):versusI think that’s why Christie works for me.
Story:  A wealthy man dies & his relatives gather after his funeral for the reading of his will, during which his sister states that he was murdered.
Poirot is called in to solve the mystery.Without revealing the plot too much, I will get into what works & what doesn’t work in terms of the storyline:What Works: After the Funeral has the ideal setting for a perfect murder mystery; a dead rich man, plenty of greedy relatives & reading of a dead man’s will.
The many characters introduced all at once & their stories, all gets confusing & it slightly distracts you from the main mystery.
Evil is not something superhuman, it's something less than human. 😈Agatha Christie👿
" Moartea este definitivă, nu există nici o viață după moarte. Nici un mort nu se întoarce înapoi pe pământ. Este un vechi adevăr - că orice om are ceva de ascuns. Asta este valabil pentru noi toți."
I used to make fun of Scooby Doo and how the gang would unmask the villain at the end, specifically how the villain would inevitably and hurriedly admit to the crime.
Much of the groundwork is laid out by a lawyer before Poirot arrives on the scene to tie it all up neatly.The body of this book is quite good.
It's a satisfactory end as far as solving a crime goes, however, here again the murderer blurts out the truth.
But that is a minor point as far as my enjoyment of the entire book goes.
[Name redacted] did.”One of the features of this tale that finally make it impressive and not just ploddingly proficient is that Christie increasingly reveals her love/hate relationship with her little round Belgian, whom she likes to make fun of for his arrogance.
Sacre bleu!And she makes fun of his way of speaking: Poirot: “The time has come to tell you all.”Inspector Morton: “You sound like a young lady in a Victorian melodrama.”And he does, in this tale of all things Victorian!
And then Morton can’t resist saying what we as readers are thinking, something Christie perhaps might admit herself about her now close to fiftieth book, which she really does want to finish:“Yes, yes, tell me all!
Ah Poirot, how I enjoy you with your funny egg shaped head, your sleek moustaches and your willingness to embrace the rampant racism present in the average Englishman all in the pursuit of a tricksy murderer.
Underlying it is a will, a reasonable amount of money and a statement that murder may have been committed.
For in this one we're not even sure if there has been.All very typical Christie and Poirot.
Poirot doesn't show up for a while and even when he does he's often in the background, quietly setting people off and observing the outcome.
unbelievable one!  ------------my favorite quotes:    ...
Unorthodox storyline. Relatively smaller novel in length than other Poirot novels, it all begins when the deceased's sister makes a comment that her brother was murdered. In true Christie style all family members are suspects. Poirot joins and solves the murder. Interesting read.
The story starts after the funeral of Richard Abernethie, when his scatterbrain sister Cora makes a wild statement: "But he was murdered, wasn't he?" There is no such scandal, and everybody admonishes Cora - but the seed of doubt has been sown.
Because the silly Cora has in the past been known to blurt out unwelcome truths.Then, the next day, Cora is bludgeoned to death...-------------------------------------------This is an exquisitely structured novel with plenty of characterisation.
As with all of Christie's novels, it uses the classic technique of misdirection, but it would have to be a very astute reader who can spot it.
I suggest all Christie fans to reread the novel and marvel at her craft.Five stars, without a doubt.

It depended, Mr Entwhistle reflected, on the mentality of the murderer.This was my first time reading After the Funeral, but, of course, it is the story that is loosely used as the story in Murder at the Gallop, that classic Marple film starring the incomparable Margaret Rutherford.
After the Funeral is a Poirot mystery, not a Marple.
They were less alarmed by it than they had been by the single word ‘detective’.After the Funeral is a fairly standard Poirot story, not the best, not the worst.
It's a bit of dark satire, more than a murder mystery, but it isn't as good as other Poirot stories.
I did remember who it was but this allowed me to focus on the rest instead and lead me to wonder if sometimes the crime is only the carrot she dangles to attract her readers, the ‘meat’ of her novels being instead in the studies in psychology and sociology she acts, all with a good dose of humour and irony.
Her characters are so recognisable as ‘personalities' seen in the real world that I can only imagine too well our author surrepticiously, or not, taking notes of everything she saw around her.
"...reading an Agatha Christie novel is, above all else, great fun." - Sophie HannahOpen an Agatha Christie book and you step into a different time and a different world.
Abernethie's sister, Cora Lansquenet, shocks everyone when she suddenly says “He was murdered, wasn’t he?” The others, after their initial shock and surprise, put it off as Cora being Cora.
Often the story is told through other characters such as the family lawyer.
And when Poirot says “The time has come to tell you all.” Inspector Morton responds “Yes, yes, tell me all!
A good one!

From the book jacket: When Cora Lansquenet is savagely murdered with a hatchet, the extraordinary remark she made the previous day at her brother Richard’s funeral suddenly takes on a chilling significance.
At the reading of Richard’s will, Cora was clearly heard to say, “It’s been hushed up very nicely, hasn’t it… But he was murdered, wasn’t he?” In desperation the family solicitor turns to Hercule Poirot to unravel the mystery.My reactionsOh, I love Hercule Poirot and his little grey cells.
I’m glad I had a text copy along, because it has a family tree printed in it, which is a great help in keeping these various Abernathie relations straight.
Seriously.Some of the most despicable characters and an ending that had to be the dumbest one yet for a Christie novel.Once again we have very little Poirot to start with.
(view spoiler)[We find out that Cora's companion murdered her all to sell a Vermeer painting she had in order to get money to open up a tea shop.
It makes no sense for this woman to have pretended to be Cora, let alone to say that perhaps Richard Abernethie was murdered.
Good...but not the best from this author.
A careless statement is uttered after a funeral, which seem to lead to a brutal crime....Another delightful mystery, and I totally suspected the wrong person!
Yet again, the cast of characters was vast and involved multiple relations.
I find that Christie liked just dumping a boatload of names on the unsuspecting readers and letting them figure out the connections for themselves.
I always have such a hard time distinguishing characters for the first few chapters, but they do tend to get a distinct voice eventually.
Just get through that part and have faith in Christie's storytelling to eventually untangle this viper's nest.
Although I enjoy escaping for a few hours into the world of murder mystery in some British countryside manor, still this one is rather disappointing. But perhaps it is the case of 'it is not the book it is me' because I wasn't really in the mood when I read this one. 2 stars only.
This was such a good mystery. (view spoiler)[ To cover up 1 murder an illusion of another murder is created. (hide spoiler)]There was no way I could have guessed the murderer or the way the thing was actually executed.
I was reading recently why it is that we find detective stories so satisfying and apparently it is the very lack of empathy we feel for any of the lightly sketched characters that enables the reader to stand comfortably aloof from the proceedings and indeed (in my case) very quickly forget who the murderer was.
My favourite part of Poirot stories is the bit where he realises with absolute certainty who the murderer is, but doesn't tell anybody so that there is always a chance that there could be one more victim while he is busy obtaining final proof.
This is the third Agatha Christie novel I’ve read, and I’ve definitely passed the threshold from wary curiosity to fandom.
The characters were fun, the mystery was interesting, and the whodunnit was a surprise, but definitely not a cheat.
I will say that I was a little surprised at the attitude towards women expressed throughout the story.
Especially women “of a certain age”.
Especially women who are childless.
Especially unmarried women.
It’s a puzzle to me, but maybe it will become more clear as I read more in her body of work.
He really is delightfully arrogant.
Audiobook via Audible.
3 stars for the audio because I didn’t care for the voicing of Poirot.
I kept expecting to hear David Suchet’s voice every time Poirot opened his mouth.4 stars for the story.
The cast of characters in the story was an awful bunch of people.
The mystery was interesting with an appropriately high body count.
(You’d think the English countryside was teeming with ruffians and murderers.) I liked the premise for this mystery; a man dies and at his funeral his sister states he was murdered.
An ailing man in his sixties dies.
Not unusual.
At the funeral a sister blurts out 'but wasn't he murdered?'.
Everyone shushes the sister who always even as a young woman spoke out of turn and blurted whatever she came up with.
The murder of Cora - the sister in a hatchet attack the very next day however and the subsequent attack on her companion makes it obvious that someone is trying to hush and hide something.In typical Agatha Christie fashion slowly unravelling the murderer is done methodically and carefully if somewhat slower than more modern mystery murder stories.
En realidad son 3,5 ⭐No es mi favorito de Agatha, pero me pareció interesante y entretenido. La puntuación es sobre todo porque a pesar de que he leído varios libros de esta autora, aún no he logrado descubrir al culpable, siempre termina sorprendiendome...de todas formas voy a seguir compitiendo con vos Agatha!!!Ojalá fuera una contemporánea y pudiera pedirle que escriba un libro en el cual participen Poirot y, mi favorita, Miss. Marple.
AudiobookI figured this book out and as I was patting myself on the back and high-fiving myself (because my husband and daughter could care less), I figured out at the end I read it before. I guess I'm not as intelligent as I thought.
My first Agatha Christie and I really enjoyed it. I guessed the murderer but I constantly changed my mind!!!
A good mystery full of red herrings; that kept you guessing. Poriot doesn't make much of an appearance in the first half though which was the only downside.
