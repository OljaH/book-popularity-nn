This reflects a similar plot in an earlier Wentworth called "She Came Back" where a woman thought dead three years returns home. That story was set during WWII, while this is set long after the Armistice, which means both stories have similar beats, and very different outcomes.I preferred this to "She Came Back" though.
This is my Mum’s book and not something I would normally read but the text on the back sounded interesting so I gave it a try. Really enjoyed it! Loved the suspense and intrigue the whole way through and a bit of romance too. Really good enjoyable book.
A delicious and delightful a suspension romance in 1926This is one of Wentworths earlier novels – – don't expect it to be crime fiction. There's plenty of suspense however and it's a page turner. I think you'll enjoy this one – – I sure did!
I like the Miss Silver books and haven't read any other ones till now. This was ok but I got a bit fed up with some of the characters and the whole book seemed awfully slow and the whole thing took too long to get going or even stay going. Perhaps Patricia Wentworth improved over the years and got better at creating atmosphere and pace. However am happy to try some more at a later date.
So romantic!This is not a mystery in the sense of dead bodies or stolen pearls, but it is the mystery of an identity and a missing man. Yes there are suggestions along the lines we see in William Smith, but this is primarily a sweet romance, and very enjoyable too. Highly recommended.
Another lovely read.
Not a mystery, per se, and I wish some things were better explained — but I enjoyed it on the whole.
