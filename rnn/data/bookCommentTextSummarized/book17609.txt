WARNING: Bad poetry ahead.
I stand here, and I think,if there is one thing I want to say,to Xiomara,it’s that she is proof effervescent passion and love, transcend hate.Words have the power,to open your chest,and pull your heart out,and carry it to the sky.
But if those words are not expressed,if they remain imprisoned,and you remain restrained,you will never feel freedom.I want to let them free,to let them fly,to let them breathe,to let me cry,my emotions out,to form a pool,that becomes a sanctuary.
And now I’ve written four (bad ones).
If you’ve enjoyed One by Sarah Crossan, you’ll love this for sure.

“Burn it!
Burn it.
This is where the poems are,” I say, thumping a fist against my chest.
“Will you burn me?
Will you burn me, too?” I’ve always been fond of stories told through verse, and I love Elizabeth’s poetry, so when I learned that she was writing her first YA novel, I knew I had to get my hands on it.
I never once doubted that I would love it, but I didn’t know it could mean so much to me.
I didn’t have a clue that I was in for such a raw, honest ride about how religion impacts childre
If you are uncomfortable with religion being portrayed in a candid and sometimes negative light, I’ll go ahead and say that The Poet X may be one you should go into with caution, as Xiomara does raise a lot of questions about the church, scriptures, and God. She has a hard time coming to terms with the devout beliefs of her loved ones, and the gap between her religious views and her mother’s come to blows (literally) throughout the story.
This was INCREDIBLE. I very rarely enjoy poetry but I listened to the audiobook of this one and it absolutely blew me away. I can't wait to buy my own physical copy so I can tab up all my favorite parts. SO. DAMN. GOOD.
Wow. This was absolutely phenomenal. What a powerful gut punch.Elizabeth Acevedo's National Book Award-winning The Poet X is deserving of every single accolade that comes its way. This immensely moving novel-in-verse will light a fire inside you while it takes your breath away.Xiomara Batista is about to start her sophomore year at a high school in Harlem. She has been the object of male attention since she grew tall and her body grew curves. Her fiercely religious mother has only mistrust for
Fast.When your body takes up more room than your voiceyou are always the target of well-aimed rumors,which is why I let my knuckles talk for me.Which is why I learned to shrug when my name was replaced by insults.I've forced my skin just as thick as I am."The best way Xiomara finds to combat everything that threatens to bring her down—her mother's religious fervor and mistrust, her father's disregard, the secrets that Twin seems to be hiding, and her growing desire for a boy to like her—is to write.
🙎🏽♀📓🖊  "Xiomara may be remembered as a lot of things: a student, a miracle, a protective sister, a misunderstood daughter, but most importantly, she should be remembered as always working to become the warrior she wanted to be."  ❤📝🎤I loved how honest, raw & beautiful this book was. Elizabeth Acevedo gave voice to so many youth through Xiomara. I was her in my youth and this book took me back to those teen years growing up in NY with strict Hispanic parents. How I wish I had a book like this

Elizabeth Acevedo gave voice to so many youth through Xiomara.
I was her in my youth and this book took me back to those teen years growing up in NY with strict Hispanic parents.
Xiomara's voice was compelling, vulnerable, empowering and above all passionate.
It had a fantastic flow, the poetry was poignant, and Xiomara's voice and character really shined through.
Her mother wants her to be close to a god she's not sure she believes in and feels that should be the focus of her life.
She only has one boy she likes, but she can't really be with him the way she wants to be (overprotective mother).
I feel like I got more out of it hearing Xiomara's story and listening to her read her poems.
This is very much a coming of age story about a girl who doesn't feel like she fits.
“Burn it! Burn it. This is where the poems are,” I say, thumping a fist against my chest. “Will you burn me? Will you burn me, too?” ― Elizabeth Acevedo, The Poet X  🌟3/5🌟This was really powerful and moving, however I just couldn't connect with Xiomara and was at times, frustrated with her.
Sooo good. SO good. And the poetry was beautiful! I’d read anything by Elizabeth Acevedo.
A story that will slam the power of poetry and love back into your heart!! Highly recommended!
I absolutely adored the way Elizabeth Acevedo writes.
I found myself rooting for her from the first page onwards and essentially finished this book in one sitting, it was far too addictive and moving to put down.
There were so many elements I adored, from the way Xiomara’s draft and final assignments seemed to portray what she was actually thinking and feeling and wanted to write vs.
There wasn’t a page of this book that wasn’t powerful and lyrical and I’m so incredibly excited to see what Elizabeth Acevedo has in store for her next book because, if this was anything to go by, I’m sure it will be utterly stunning.
I think this is such an IMPORTANT book today; it’s from the perspective of a Dominican fat teen, it shows just how powerful words are whether they break or heal you, and it discusses all different types of relationships and learning to climb back up when everything (or everyone) has left you brokenand while I’m not struggling with my religion right now, and I generally don’t like religion talks in books, the religion discussion here meant a lot to me.
I’m not limited by others because of their religious beliefs, but I’ve faced different types and levels of oppression by religious people because I’m not Christian.
As with many other novels-in-verse, I am struggling to call this poetry.
To me, this is beautiful, effective prose, cut up and served up in small bits.
I am used to traditional poetry (that rhymes at least occasionally) and might need further literary education to get on board with this concept of chopping up prose to present it in a visually distinctive and pleasing way and calling it poetry.
But I digress...I recommend listening to this novel on audio.
The author does an outstanding job reading her creation (and it doesn't sound like poetry in her reading either!)The weakest part for me was the ending.
🚨 The Poet X explores several important topics with a feather-touch: body shaming (Word!), the anti-feminist foundations of organized religion (Yas, girl!
In the opening pages, fifteen-year-old Xiomara laments the way men respond to her full-figured body.
Xiomara's double standards about objectification of another person's body convolute an important message.
The book's most notable grievance is its perfunctory verse.* It lacks the lyricism and passion found in Blood Water Paint, written by fellow longlist nominee, Joy McCullough, the powerful economy of words demonstrated in Long Way Down by Jason Reynolds, or the devastating emotional depth of One by Sarah Crosson.
I keep re-reading some passages.
Slam poetry means a lot to me!
*cries for 5 more years*A touching story about a young Hispanic woman growing up in Harlem with a very devout mother.
But there is so much more to it than that <3I couldn't say enough about this book if I tried - I just adore it to pieces.
I'm extremely glad this came in my PageHabit YA box for March, the comments from the author make the experience exponentially better (as if it wasn't fantastic already :P ) <3 <3--------I.
GOT.
LETS.
*3.75 FIRST BOOKTUBEATHON 2018 READ!! I loved this book. I laughed and started tearing up at points. However, the ending was horribly rushed for me and that disappointed me. I wanted so much more from the ending gahhh. But I did love the story, it was beautiful ~
4 StarsThis book snuck in my house, smiled at me politely and then punched me in the gut 42 times. And afterwords, I thanked it. Aka: this is super important and gave me feelings even if I have some qualms about the endingFull RTC
“I only know that learning to believe in the power of my own words has been the most freeing experience of my life.
It has brought me the most light.
And isn't that what a poem is?
A lantern glowing in the dark.”  I will admit it -- I often judge books by their covers.
When I saw the cover of The Poet X, I knew I had to read it and downloaded it before even reading anything about it.
I'm glad I did because I'm not sure if I would have read it if I'd read the synopsis first.

This book is an exception; it is a book that's at least as beautiful and compelling as its cover.
It is a powerful and beautiful book, the words flow flawlessly and musically.
I'm so glad I judged this book by its cover!
However,There are many pros to reading this story, which follow.*We see the voice of a young Afro-Latina (Dominicana) searching for and speaking her truth.
We see our she gains her voice via poetry and spoken word.
Xiomara's mother is tied, like a groupie, to her religion and she lives in a black and white mindset to life and society.
She loves her mother, even her father, but what is expected of her stifles her like an albatross clinging to her neck.*New York City!
The city serves as a character within the story, open to possibility.*LGBT representation, which harks to the cultural complexities I wrote.
The audio is highly recommended, skillfully read by the author, which led me down an internet rabbit hole of the author performing poetry from outside this book.This would have been a good book to read when I was the same age as the narrator, because she is confronted with conservative parenting that actually physically prevents her from expressing herself in various ways, condemns the natural exploration of her sexuality, and she is able to write about the conflict so honestly.
It drives home the importance of a variety of voices, and adults teenagers can depend on outside of their family structure.
The less good pointsBecause of how this book is conceived as poems from Xio's viewpoint it's a very insular reading experience.
While it's beautifully intimate and the connection we as readers can make with Xio is incredibly moving, it does mean that we do not get to relate to the supporting cast in the same fashion.
The ratingSo there seems to have been a trade off with this book because of the poetry format: the format lends itself to truly connecting with the MC but feeling short-changed by the character development of the supporting cast and the absence of a really great plot.
3.5-3.75 stars  TW: Abuse and Sexual Harassment - topics: religion, poetry, masturbation, periods, relationships- read this in one sitting - super quick read- really enjoyed the writing style - main character was badass- the religious aspect gave me  Carrie  vibes at one point- ending lacked for me, was too perfect- story could have been more developed - a lot of great quotes
When I’m told to have faith in the father, the son, in men - and men are the first ones to make me feel so small.  The Poet X is not only a book about a girl discovering her love of poetry. It's about a young dominican girl, Xiomara, living in Harlem. She has a curvy figure that draws unwanted attention from men and boys. Her mother blames her for this. She is taught to cover up. She is torn when she finds herself liking a boy going against everything she's been taught. Is she sinning? Her moth
Little does her mother know, but Xiomara has been questioning religion.
Only able to express her true self on the page, she shares her thoughts and questions through poetry in a notebook her twin brother gifted her.I found this to be an incredibly important book due to the subject matter.
Not to mention her twin brother who has his own secret he can't tell.The religion plot line is a fascinating one as well.
It incorporated Xiomara's love and discovery of poetry in with the other storylines even when slam poetry wasn't at the forefront.This was an important, relatable coming-of-age story told in poetry form.
I was not expecting any of this and I was not expecting to be on a roll of loving all these books at the moment!This was breathtaking. I literally felt like I had to read quicker to match the pace of the poetry because I was scared it would slip away from me.Xiomara is a 15 year old girl just trying to get her shit together. She digests everything through poetry - it's a beautiful perspective on the world.She questions everything, from boys, to church to bullshit creepy men hitting on a minor.Read this book. It's beautiful.
Like many young girls Xiomara is given unwanted attention by leering men wherever she goes.
Xiomara uses her writing and creativity to figure out what she wants and how to express it.
Xiomara relates well to her twin brother Xavier, although they have different strengths.
Reading about a Dominican teenager coming of age was refreshing because too few young adult books focus on people of color.
I would recommend this to reader's who enjoy coming of age stories with unshakeable female characters and problematic family dynamics.I received this e-book from HarperTeen in exchange for an honest review.
“It almost feels like the more I bruise the page, the quicker something inside me heals.”Fazia um tempo que eu não marcava tantas frases num livro.
And she is amazing!In an autobiographical way, she tells her coming of age story in poetic verse.
Her brother “Twin”, she’s always just called him that, knows X well and gives her special notebooks to write her most intimate thoughts in.
As X is growing up she is experiencing some tensions with her mother about faith, and boys, and love…and these notebooks are her way of expressing her emotions about her world.
Or will her mother come around and realize her daughter’s needs?***This book is all that and then some.
Full review originally posted on my blog:   Word Wonders  I wasn’t planning on reviewing The Poet X.
I really wasn’t.
Because I listened to the audiobook and I made it a rule not to write full reviews of those just because I listen while driving so I never take notes.
But this is the one exception.
I read this book three months ago but the words and the feelings are still so vivid in my memory that I decided to let it all out of my system and write a review out of it.
It’s safe to say I adored i
I read this book three months ago but the words and the feelings are still so vivid in my memory that I decided to let it all out of my system and write a review out of it.
One other element I loved at the end, is that her parents start realizing that they’re in the wrong and promise and try to be better but not everything is magically fixed.I highly HIGHLY recommend reading The Poet X if you’re comfortable reading about the topics stated above.
Actual rating 4.5/5 stars.The Poet X follows teen, Xiomara Batista, as she uses her own poetry, and enters into the world of slam poetry, in an attempt to understand her divorced feelings from her religion, her tumultuous relationship with her family, and her own identity and place in this world.My first book written in verse has proven to me that it can compete with wordier or lengthier pieces of prose for emotional impact and how deeply it could resonate with me.
Before the review, I just want to let you know that there's an international giveaway for a copy of this book on the Blog Tour if anyone's interested! :) ***Actual rating: 4.5/5 ‘En voz alta, Xiomara’ Stars*** The Poet X is a book you’ll easily fall in love with from the first page until the end. It’s profoundly meaningful and extremely poignant in the era of #OwnVoice and #Diverse. There’s not a thing I don’t like about this book, but if I had to choose one particular element I love the most, i
There’s not a thing I don’t like about this book, but if I had to choose one particular element I love the most, it’s definitely the main character, Xiomara.
Through the verses and slam poems in this book, the author meticulously crafted the feisty yet sensitive mind of Xiomara, which takes the entire character development up a notch.
things throughout this book, she eventually discovers the magic of slam poetry and the power of her words.
Hence, when I start reading this book, I’m surprised to be carried away with Xiomara’s dynamic and distinct character as well as the truths of her words.
