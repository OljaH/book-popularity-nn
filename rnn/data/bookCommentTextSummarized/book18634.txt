The second installment in the "Up In The Air" Trilogy and Bianca and James are BACK setting beds, planes and horses on fire!
She is afraid of relationships and commitment but the walls around her heart can't resist James' "attacks"...
I abso-FREAKING-lutely root for this couple!They are so baffled of their chemistry, that they are adorable and they can't help but agree that they can't live without each other!This book is more focused on Bianca & James' relationship as they deal with past partners, jealously, paparazzi and escalating feelings, that the threat on Bianca takes the back seat.
I really can't wait to read the next book!!!

I was a slut once with my body, but I’ve never been a slut with my heart.”“You’re my angel, Bianca.
You make me a better man.”
I LOVE JAMES CAVENDISH...
He is alpha sexy, generous, kind and really, could he be anymore perfect?!?!?!
Her name is Bianca.
Come to terms with it.
“No one else can do this for you, Bianca.
Don’t ever consider it.
Some of my new favorite books!
If you haven't read these books, you need to!
Come on February 12th!
This is another deeply erotic and highly emotional instalment in Bianca and James' story.It's the second part of the Up in the Air Trilogy and it doesn’t work as a standalone.
There is James, doting, caring boyfriend – he will do everything and anything for Bianca, he thinks of everything, tends to her every need.
His feelings for Bianca run so deep but his fear that she will not return his feelings and leave him again is all too apparent.
I think it’s beautifully done, it doesn’t feel rushed, you can feel the intensity growing between Bianca and James, even if neither of them will actually say the words.

And so the story of Princess Buttercup (Bianca) and her Love continues, the 2nd verse of its theme song portraying the dark forces trying to keep them apart:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYQ4B1...
Book 2 is the intense continuation of James and Bianca’s relationship.
Let me provide a brief synopsis of this book: Bianca and James have sex.
In fact, let’s play a game of “Hot or Not” with Mile High: “We’re going to fuck like animals in the horse stalls, and you’re going to love it”  – James  Hot or Not?
No. Gross.Also, the author completely rips off an entire sex scene from Fifty Shades.
Not cool.Moving on… I liked a couple things about the first book, but these good aspects disappeared in the second.
This book appeals to one type of person only - someone interested in reading Fifty Shades fanfiction.
Mr Beautiful, I WANT YOU!  He does it again! I am mesmerised with him! Am definitely gonna recap my Mr. Beautiful again! Bianca and James faces few demon in their pasts and it's up to me make their relationship work and trust each other! As we all know James has been a manwhore before this!

Mr Beautiful, I WANT YOU!
Am definitely gonna recap my Mr. Beautiful again!
Bianca and James faces few demon in their pasts and it's up to me make their relationship work and trust each other!
At times, Bianca needs kick, instead of talking with him first about that white elephant, she decides to jump into his bed!
BEAUTIFUL IS REALLY GOOD!
certain image of James will surely enter in!
"Nothing in my life has ever felt so perfect as being inside of you""I was a slut once with my body, but I've never been a slut with my heart""I'm going to drink your milk like this when you breastfeed our children" That man is really makes my leg go jelly!!!!!
4 SINFUL JAMES CAVENDISH STARSThis is the second book in the Up In The Air Trilogy the first being In Flight which I have to say I didn’t love but don't hate either.
I had serious mixed feelings about the book and the series but there was something that made me want to keep going and see how things developed and turned out and I have to say I’m SOOOOO glad I kept reading.
James is full on in love with her in this book.
James has a ton of work ahead of him trying to get Bianca to open up and see the relationship for what it is.
“How would, ‘I want him to f*ck me to death, and he just might’, rate on that scale?”Of course, James walks up at that exact moment and he wastes no time in letting Bianca know how much he misses her...“Did you want me to f*ck you in front of all of your co-workers?
Even though James' actions are shouting them, Bianca still needs that and I have a feeling James does too.
I think that both him and Bianca need to have some growth to be able to let others in.
If I thought I enjoyed James and Bianca's story before in book one, in this book I was positively swooning.In this second book the author takes us on the delicious journey of obvious soul Mates, we get to learn more about the characters that I fell in love with from book one -Jealousy, possession, love, life, heartache, pain, dark hidden pasts all play their staring roles in this roller coaster epic love story.
I thought this couples journey was told so well by the author, and as a reader I felt every heartache and drawn out angst.What I loved most about the book is the inclusion of story telling surrounding the romance and steamier scenes, which allows the reader to learn more about each character.
I find this better than the first book.
James Cavendish surely impressed me here.
I'm in awed on all the he'd done to win Bianca.
He's more patient, persuasive and considerate since he's also adjusting on having a new relationship (definitely not contractual).
Bianca wants to take their relationship really slow.
She got the public's attention by dating James and as well as trying to control her feelings whenever she encounters his exes.
I love how their relationship grows up into something more and help each other to fight their own demons.
This book deserves my 4 stars.
at some points I wanted to slap Bianca just so she finally stops being so negative and literally pooh pooing on James feelings toward her and their relationship - “There you go, belittling us again.
I was a slut once with my body, but I've never been a slut with my heart.”  But James is persistent slowly thawing that ice around her heart and I am glad that Bianca finally submits.Beyond their developing love story there is a huge cliff-hanger at the end with some revelation regarding her family...
I really hope I'm wrong  (hide spoiler)]So can't wait for the 3rd book to see what happens["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>

Well this one went downhill FAST for me.The things that I loved so much about In Flight were almost nonexistent in the book.
I loved Stephen's character in book 1, and his character almost completely disappears in this book.
I loved Bianca's backbone in the first book.
In this book, she surrenders as James's sub and her lovely character disappeared.
It was a shame.More than anything, the thing that changed for me from book 1 to book 2 is how I felt about the character of James Cavendish.
****4 MIND-BLOWING stars****"I never thought I'd have the urge to fuck someone to death." "He's good in bed, too?""That just isn't fair. If I looked like him, I'd never leave my house.

****4 MIND-BLOWING stars****"I never thought I'd have the urge to fuck someone to death."
I'd just stay home and fuck myself."***************************************************This is the second book in the UP IN THE AIR series, MILE HIGH.
Both Bianca and James are a work in progress and we find out some secrets from both of their pasts.
Continuing on one month after the events of the first book, In Flight, this book picks up the drama straight away, with James and Bianca still struggling with their tumultuous, fledgling relationship.
They still want each other, badly, but Bianca still has issues with the relationship side.
I was so mad at her, and then my heart broke even more for James when he says this line…  “I love any touch from you.
I was frustrated with her, sure, but she was honest with herself, and managed to give enough to James to let him know that she was affected by him.
Here at the end of book two in the series and I still haven't been introduced to Tristan or Danika, so I'm wondering where they come into the story.
I feel like Bianca is being given every opportunity known to man to understand how much James cares about her, and yet she is so ignorant.
I've read a handful of authors who really make me believe it, and use that aspect to drag me kicking and screaming deep into a love affair with the genre.
I don't believe in it with James and Bianca, I just don't.
I’m a sappy romantic, so I loved seeing Bianca nurtured and showered with affection.
However, it bothers me that the moment Bianca is in James’s presence, she loses her independence and her boundaries dissolve.Stephan isn’t in this book as much as the first one, and I missed their fun interactions.
BDSM is integral to the plot, but I think there’s just way too much sex.
It makes me wonder if their relationship is built on a firm foundation or if it’s primarily sex.
This series is a page-turning guilty pleasure, though, so I’m off to read the next book.
I really liked this book. It has just the right amount of drama for a light, hot read. I love the developing relationship between James and Bianca. I love how dominate and possessive he is. The things that James does to Bianca is just flat out hot! I can't wait to get more of this sexy couple in Grounded.  "You're more precious than my own life to me, Bianca."  "You feel like home to me, James." A hoarse pained sound escaped his throat. "Yes," he said, he voice rough with emotion. "This is home.

Not much happening in this book. I felt like i was in a boring knockoff world of Christian and Anna. Something about James just felt odd, i had a hard time connecting with these 2. Does he really need to dress her all of the time... And what is with the choking scene, a bit much....he is crazy
There’s no room in perfection for insecurityMile High, book 2 of the Up In The Air series, begins almost a month after the end of book 1, In FlightThe whole flight crew, including captain Damien, are on an overnight layover in Miami and Bianca is slowly recovering from the assault of her father.
So I needed to give you at least a small taste of the wanting.”James whisked her away to his horse ranch, where they have wickedly hot sex on James’s horse, Devil or Demon the verdict on his name is still out!“You must know by now that I’ve never done any of this for anyone else.
BDSM is where he gets that control but he has very few people in his life he cares for or even trusts.Bianca witnesses her father kill her mother at a very young age and she runs away to save herself, meeting Stefan, who becomes her brother and best friend.
James having been with so many woman and feeling nothing, knows the minute he lays eyes on Bianca that the feeling he gets actually means something and he will stop at nothing to claim her.
The lengths that James goes to to keep Bianca is crazy and probably completely unrealistic but is also the reason I absolutely adore this book series.
SO FREAKING GOOD!Mile High is the second book in Up in the Air series.
It's still about the amazing love between Bianca and James.
They both have pasts that they need help to deal with.
Both dealing with abusive men.
The amount of caddy bitches doubles in this book.
Everyone is out for Bianca's blood because they have no idea what the hell James sees in her.
James is even more controlling in this book because of Bianca's safety.
There were some twists and turns in this book, a lot I didn't see coming.
I'm trying to hard to save the book for tomorrow..
TRYING...
FREAKING....
HARD.
James Cavendish is beyond amazzzzzing!!!Simply beautiful man who falls in love with Bianca.I knew when the first book ended that he would find his way back to her!!I love the fact that he gave her space in his own way.
I love this series!I love the fact the trilogy is about their love story mostly.I get quite irritated that some series the 2nd and 3rd books are about other characters.
This book really gives the characters the time they need to have their story...I love that Bianca is finally opening her heart to him.
Cause this series for me is... I... JUST... xxx
Love Love Love this book!!!! I can't get enough of James and Bianca. I want book three like now. It was such an incredible book and I pretty much swooned over James the entire time while reading this. An excellent book and recommended to everyone who loves a sexy billionaire.
I feel pretty much as I did after the first book, I am a little baffled by their instalove but I'm overall enjoying the storyline.Also Damien is such a nice guy, I want more of him!! Can I get a Damien book please????
WOW!!!!Mr. Cavendish doesn't disappoint in this book. There were so many moments where I wanted to jump into the book and take Bianca's place. "Then live with me. Be with me. Swear you'll never leave me.""I want to lay the world at your feet." "Meet my future"Looking forward to book 3 and HEASERIES:   Cliffhangers.Spinoffs:
O.oWTF?Abi konu yok?
Ya tamam, sevişin, yine sevişin de bu ne amk?!
Nemfomanyak kardeşlerimiz bile illallah deyip beyaz bayrak salladı bu neyin azgınlığı allasen?Kitabı okurken bazı şeylere öyle sinir oldum ki, yazmayı unutmamak için kimisini not aldım.1- İlk kitapta işini çok seven, işini özenle yapan, boş zamanlarında resim yapan, arkadaşıyla vakit geçiren o kendi ayakları üzerindeki kız gitmiş...
2- Yahu her boku adam yapıyor!!!
bir de fırfırlı elbise :SD: Ama şu kısacık şort, tişört, dolgu topuk ayakkabı ve ELMAS TASMA?!!!!
Adamın stilisti dillere destan müthiş bir güzellik, dövmeci kız afet afet, eski itaatkarı ooo yeme de yanında yat (get it?
bildiniz müthiş bir güzellik :D :D Kısacası kötüydü.
Cümleleri tamamen salladım, ama kitapta böyle bir de 'ğ' katliamı var, bilin istedim.
James and Bianca's story continues, their love appears to blossom....
I find James, as delicious as he is, to be completely obsessed with his control of Bianca.
(view spoiler)[Another example is when he got those tattoos for her, seemingly to only have her submit to letting him pierce her nipples!!!
(hide spoiler)]What really convinced me of his pathologically obsessive behavior was (view spoiler)[ was when he brought her home from the charity event, and he wouldn't answer her questions about his past relationships with Jolene and Jules until he had her stripped naked and shackled to the bed so she couldn't run away!!!
