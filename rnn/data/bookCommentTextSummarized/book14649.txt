And I award this 5 stars, symbolically on Banned Books Week as an apology for all the cowardly sentiments of the ones who misuse their power by banning books, thereby shutting out many powerful voices which demand and need to be heard.In my eyes, an author's merit lies not only in their sense of aesthetic beauty, but also in the scope and reach of their worldviews which must reflect in their craft.Alice Walker's is the voice of one such African American writer that recounts a story which not only breaches the boundaries of an issue like emancipation of women but tries to detect a common pattern in problems plaguing civilizations across continents.
As an abused, uneducated woman (abused by her father, husband, and step-children) who was only ever shown love by Nettie, the letters are very telling, and are the only means Celie has of expressing her feelings.
It really amazed me how a woman who was abused so much (sexually, physically, verbally) could still have so much love in her heart, and not be bitter.
Imagine hearing things like this regularly: (Husband to Celie) –  “Who you think you is?
Celie is a wonderful character and proof of the resilience of the human spirit.
The more I wonder, the more I love.”
Wow. I mean.
Wow.You know how there are some books and their words wrap around you like a comforting blanket?
One.The Color Purple rips the clothes right off of your skin, leaving you bare and vulnerable.
Even when you're not.Wow.Have you seen the movie?
I thought I was prepared.
Because the movie was devastating.
The movie didn't prepare me.Walker's words are music.
It makes me yearn to find pieces of literature that can show me the mysteries of that continent.I am incoherent and refuse to speak of the summary.
It's The Color Purple!
It doesn't need a summary.It is alive.It is life.
Done my second book for #booktubeathon!
Long before women began speaking up about their different experiences in the #metoo movement, Alice Walker's Celie and her sisters resist the violence and power of the men around them and go on living through the pain and frustration, only to find life worth fighting for in the end.
I knew it had a POC main character, heard that it was about women's rights and about abuse.
I heard it was a great book.
But I still did not expect this.The main character's life is miserable.
I still don't understand how she made it through to a certain point, because if it were me in her skin, I probably wouldn't have been able to stay in that skin for long.It was not an easy book, neither plot nor writing were exactly motivating.
But I found so much hope in the first, and even happiness in the last chapters, that I just came to love it.Find more of my books on Instagram

A Masterpiece!“I think it pisses God off if you walk by the color purple in a field somewhere and don't notice it.” ― Alice Walker, The Color PurpleFrom the time I first read this book (I have read this many times), it has been a favorite.
Walker has brought to life the story of two sisters: one a missionary in Africa and one a young abuse wife living in the south.
This book spans years as we see their lives.Celie writes letters to God and her sister.
There is also hope, strength, resilience, love and yes, happiness.Celie finally finds herself after being introduced to a couple of strong women.
Alphonso refuses to let Nettie marry, instead arranging for Mister to marry Celie.
Shortly thereafter, Nettie runs away from Alphonso and takes refuge at Celie's house, where Mister makes sexual advances toward her.

Despite finishing this over a week ago, I have staved off from writing a review as I feel anything I could write would not do the sublime elegance and exquisiteness of this book justice. The characters and their emotions are displayed in a raw and unapologetic way, their stories are dynamic and compelling, their plights are austere and penetrating, and the writing is evocative and exalted. I urge anyone and everyone to read this hard-hitting, powerful and corporeal book as it has such an important story to tell!
Sure, I'm glad the prof didn't shaft this woman of color writer like she had with others near the beginning, but I have to wonder about those students for which this class assignment was their first reading.
The teacher may know how to spell feminism and womanism and patriarchy, but all that only matters if the taught have been allowed to give a damn.I can't keep track of how many times someone's said that they're not an expert as an excuse for shutting down the conversation since my return to college.
The language was harsh at first but once the flow arrived it was swift. Hardships were told in stride and empathy makes the reader want good things to happen to a few of the characters. And then, good things happen to them but they still aren't happy but they now seem content. This book was fun to read with surprisingly happy nuances described during tragic conditions.
This was fantastic. I am so glad I finally read it after having known about it for so long and never having been assigned it in school. It’s beautifully written. Celie’a voice is so strong and all of the characters are well developed. I especially loved Shug and Sofia. And now I’ve got to see the film.
My gran got me this book years ago and just getting round to reading it now. It was a quick read but really emotional. Had elements in it i didnt expect.The Africa parts bored me and were very slow.
“El color púrpura” es un novela epistolar, que trata sobre la dura vida de Celie, una mujer norteamericana de raza negra, que vive en el sur de Estados Unidos a principios del siglo XX.
Es uno de los mejores que leí este año !!
😊Mi personaje preferido: SOFIA Por último, les dejo las frases que más me impactaron: ”Mientras pueda decir D-I-O-S sabré que hay alguien conmigo.””Desde que nos casamos no hace más que pensar en hacerme obedecer.
Eres negra, eres pobre, eres fea, eres una mujer.
Vamos, que no eres nada.”
Wow such an amazing book! Although many parts were so difficult to read, so heart breaking, its a story that sticks with you. I loved when the story expanded to include Nettie's life as a missionary. Celie's courage to endure all the hardships and losses, including the hardest loss of her sister, makes many of today's problems seem so insignificant to me. This is truly a remarkable book that I highly recommend!
Sofia y Shug Avery son dos mujeres con las cuales Celie conoce el amor, la necesidad de valorarse a si mis, y que el querer a alguien no significa que debas aceptar cualquier cosa, incluso con ellas el lector las quiere, por momentos no caen bien, pero al final encontramos que son extraordinarias personas, y mujeres que sufren el dolor de ser mujeres en una época de machismo, y de ser negras en un lugar donde el racismo es no sólo extremo sino que es la norma.
2.5
A running topic through the book is Celie’s relationship with God, who for a long time is her only confidant.
Thanks to an important talk with Shug – one of the most important talks in this book – the author shows not only how racism and sexism has affected Celie’s image of God (as an old, white man) but also how ‘wrong’ it is to search for God in a church.
The second half of this book however, when Nettie’s letters from Africa take over and the narrative gets divided between Celie and Nettie, was when things started going downhill for me.
O Cúmulo Do Machismo Já alguma vez vos ocorreu pensar sobre o Cúmulo do Machismo?Pois bem, se lerem este livro irão chegar a uma fórmula mais ou menos assim:É um marido maltratar a mulher com tal grau de brutalidade, que esta e a amante dele se tornam melhores amigas e ambas optam por vê-lo pelas costas, pirando-se juntas!...Como corolário dessa misoginia extrema, a única mulher da vida de tal homem, passa a ser um fantasma feminino, com quem flirta ocasionalmente, para alguns passos de dança descontraídos!
;)No livro, esse tal marido boçal apanha tamanho choque ao ver-se duplamente abandonado, que opta por reinventar-se um pouco!
I re-read it in 2007, and enjoyed it just as much the second time.First thing I should mention: This is not the book for you if you object to blunt language about sexuality, and strong language in general.
She goes through several lifetimes of pain and hurt, but ends up a strong woman in the end.The entire book is told through diary entries, which I think makes things quite interesting.
It touched my heart after reading everything that came before.Favorite character: Albert.
His story makes me think there's hope for just about any lowlife.
Walker's characters are not caricatures as they are well-developed and multi-dimensional, i.e., not only with both their good and bad sides revealed to the readers but also the reasons why they behave or think that way.
When I finally closed the book, I did not feel unsatisfied really but you know that feeling when you are standing in front of the buffet table and you still have that small space in your tummy and you don't want to go for dessert because it is fattening?
I would not surely know how to behave as a black man if I got married to somebody like Sophia.
The book starts off in the darkest of places and the light is shed more and more as the story goes on.
The book focuses on Celie's journey.
In the book, Celie leaves Mister and goes off to live with Sug. They have a deep relationship.
I am so glad that Celie has a chance to know what love is.
I would love it if no one ever had to suffer the way Celie did; it was terrible.
I'm very thankful to have had the experience of this book and to see a completely different way of life.
I've had an awfully difficult time writing about this book, so I'll keep my thoughts to a few short points which others have doubtless said better elsewhere.The Color Purple is a series of letters written by a poor Southern black woman, Celie, to God and her sister.
Rural Georgia in the 1920s is a rough place to be poor, black or a woman (to say nothing of all of these), and Walker firmly establishes this setting, especially in contrast with the scenes in West Africa.The Color Purple is deeply emotional and matters for many reasons.
“It is the very mark of the spirit of rebellion to crave for happiness in this life.”- Henrik IbsenThe African village Natie visits in this book had this ritual where members are initiated to community though facial scarring. Something easily accepted by most villagers, but with which embarrasses a more conscious Tashi: “ Tashi is, unfortunately, ashamed of these scars on her face, and now hardly ever raises her head.” It is a novel about people reacting to very similar scars given to them by so
“It is the very mark of the spirit of rebellion to crave for happiness in this life.”-	Henrik IbsenThe African village Natie visits in this book had this ritual where members are initiated to community though facial scarring.
“The most common way people give up their power is by thinking they don't have any.” - Alice Walker (not this novel) If she hasn’t already protested, it was because she suffered a far worse poverty- feeling of being unloved.
In the end Celie forgives God. Celie’s anger was just another thing stopping her from enjoying her life.
Heart-stirring and powerful, The Color Purple is truly inspiring - I don’t know what took me so long to get around to reading this novel!
Most readers will know the background to this one, either through the book or the movie.
When I initially started this book, I was hesitant about the epistolary format and struggled a bit with the dialect.
This is one book that I will be placing on my shelf with the intention to read it once again.“I think us here to wonder, myself.
And that in wondering bout the big things and asting bout the big things, you learn about the little ones, almost by accident.
Since its release in 1982, The Color Purple had been a subject of frequent censorship due to its violent sexual content and language. Not to mention the casual and constant change of partners, lesbianism and the polygamous society of the Olinka tribe. Written in epistolary form, the book is a series of letters addressed to God through which our protagonist, Celie, found solace in her chaotic life. She exists in a time of male dominance and fixed gender roles. “Well sometime Mr._____ git on me pr
Written in epistolary form, the book is a series of letters addressed to God through which our protagonist, Celie, found solace in her chaotic life.
Although an ambiguous female relationship was present, it was Shug Avery’s self-assured but loving character that bolstered Celie to resist oppression and gain selfhood.
Despite the injustice presented in this book, indelibly the nature of God was narrated in a non-fixated way.
You come into the world with God. But only them that search for it inside find it.
It had been subtly implied in this book that God was Celie’s most attentive listener and in the end made concrete validations for her.
I can't believe I ever gave this a three star rating. I'm glad I reread this book now that I'm older and can appreciate what's being written. It really is a masterpiece.
I started it, put it on hold while I did a couple buddy reads and finally got around to finishing it.There was only one thing in the whole book that bothered me and it was the character that is consistently referred to as Mr.____.
What’s the message?The book starts out with our MC, Celia writing letters to God. These letters tell us a little bit about her and her life.
The more I wonder, the more I love.”“I think it pisses God off if you walk by the color purple in a field somewhere and don't notice it.” And lastly,“Here's the thing, say Shug.
