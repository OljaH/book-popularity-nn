All in all I felt this was a good read. Bukharin's initial thesis on dialectics was a little weak, relying on appeal to common sense over strong argument. There is a middle section where he goes into everything from Babylonian mythology to steel working to demonstrate materialist change in societies but it comes off more like Bukharin flaunting knowledge. When he expands on Marx, however, he's a lot more clear and argumentative.
