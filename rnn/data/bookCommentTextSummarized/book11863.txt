It's a good book if you are out of touch with electronics. Simple way of explaining the basics and main concepts of electronic circuits. However, the questions are too direct when you need questions which require more critical thinking.
its very essntial
The essential textbook on electronics read this in the second year of engg.
This book is wow. I switched over my graduation field to Electrical and Electronics Engineering from Bachelor in Computer Applications and nothing seemed to excite me about electronics back then. THIS was the most interesting text I found back then. It will guide you and then test your knowledge aptly. Recommend also for people starting to learn electronics as a hobby.
excellent book

A book that gives total information required in electronic circuit point of view. It explains in detail with necessary equations and problems. Good for a beginner

Kutsal kitabƒ±mƒ±z.
very nice book
It is one of the best ever books to introduce some of the most routinely used devices in electronic design. If you want to thoroughly understand the device fundamentals, read this book and solve problems without fail to test your grasp of the device characteristics and behaviour. I highly recommend this book.
