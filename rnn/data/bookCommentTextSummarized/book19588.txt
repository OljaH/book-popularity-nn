4.5/5 stars!Great book, I loved the Roman aspect to it and CANNOT WAIT to learn more about all the Roman stuff in the next book because I can already tell it's going to get CRAZYYYYYY!
Re-read in 2017 so I can FINALLY finish the rest of the series!Original Review:THAT ENDING WAS SOOO GOOD. I NEED THE NEXT BOOK ASAP PLEASE AND THANK YOU.
I SWEAR TO GODS, PERCY, YOU HAD BETTER GET YOUR MEMORY AND GET YOUR SORRY HIDE BACK TO NEW YORK OR I WILL FIND A WAY TO GET INSIDE THE BOOK AND KILL YOU.Also, I just had a terrible, horrible, ugly, bad, horrendous, repulsive, monstrous idea.So, at the end of the book, when Jason remembers all that stuff about the Roman camp, he remembers the names of all his friends.
and if Percy's hanging at that Roman camp in the Neptune cabin, there's a 99.9999999% chance that he's just like Jason and can't remember anything about CHB or anything else, either (since Annabeth is always right, and all).So does that mean...
Probably SPOILER ALERT, but nothing you couldn't have figured out in the first few pages.According to Goodreads, 97% of people liked it.
NO!) and 2) she has the VERY RARE gift of charmspeak.2.
And then there was Jason, Piper's love interest.
It seemed like she thought that she should be attracted to him, so she was.3.
But then he got the VERY RARE gift of creating fire from nothing and I laughed.Also, I quickly got sick of the simple writing style.
The part at the end where Jason (view spoiler)[doesn't die even though ANYONE ELSE would, because he's SPESHUL (hide spoiler)] was incredibly frustrating....I'm done.
(B+) 79% | GoodNotes: It treats memory as the primordial stew of personality: a precious, bubbling cistern of affection, anguish and intrigue.
A one on one buddy read with my wonderful friend, Audrey =) Yay, finally got me a buddy =)I liked this book more than the first few Percy books but I'm not sure I'm going to continue with either series.
I was telling a friend, I'm pretty sure what ruined Percy for me was watching the movies before reading the books.
I just know that while reading the books, any mention of the characters in the movie, I would cringe.
And even though this series seems even better, I know Percy is going to be back and all I see once again is the idiots in the movie.
I also think I liked it a lot better reading it the second time, probably because I'm more familiar with the characters now.
The first time I read it, I think I was a little distracted being like, "but WHERE'S PERCY JACKSON." Reading it again and knowing there was no Percy in it, I think I was a bit more invested in the characters.
(Apparently the first time I read this book I really liked Piper ...
So, it's a little hard to let go of that attachment and be like, "I MISS PERCY!" But, oh well.So yeah, this book.
All of my friends seem to have read this series, and I want to start it so much, but I haven't read the Persy Jackson series yet.Can this series be read before Persy Jackson, or is this a prequel or a sequel. And if you have read this, any feedback?
I read almost of this book in a relax mood. But the ending! It was killer! Shocking! When I realised what actually happened and craving for more, the book ended!!😣😣 That was painful. OVERVIEW New characters are being introduced. Jason, Leo and Piper. Jason has lost his memory. Finds himself in a school bus where Leo and Piper claim to be his friends. But he doesn't remember them.

Jason, Leo and Piper.
Moreover Hera is being kidnapped by monsters and there is a threat of rising of the king of giants and the most powerful antagonist ever, (view spoiler)[Gaea (hide spoiler)].
I thought I might not enjoy the humour.
Eventually I began to like his character.
He was the character who contributed in almost of the humor of this book.
(hide spoiler)] I really want to see her with Jason in the next book.=> Hera.
Looking forward to her in the next book.
Seven half-bloods shall answer the call,To storm or fire the world must fall.An oath to keep with a final breath,And foes bear arms to the Doors of Death.  New prophecy. New characters. New adventure. Same, EPIC world!!!Meet our new demigods; Jason, Piper and Leo.Jason is the mystery in this trio, see he doesn't remember anything, not even who he is. A God has stolen his memories.Piper has a secret, a terrible one that will only cause pain and suffering, but what other choice does she have?Leo
The start of the new prophecy has begun...To be honest, I was a littleteeytinybit nervous that this book wasn't going to live up to my expectations.
I can't believe how much I've missed this world.I loved this book!
We even get to see some of our favorite familiar hero's, but sadly, some aren't here in this book, but hoping Rick will include them in the next.I don't want to give anything away.
The Lost Hero is an incredible start to a brand new adventure!Highly entertaining!
One was their camp wasn't nearly as interesting as Camp Half-Blood.
Another was that there was more of an emphasis on pairing up characters and I'm just not a fan of romance.
Doesn't that strike anyone else as strange that the main character from the first series wasn't even around at first this time?
Secondly, this book (and all of the ones in this series) are way longer than they needed to be.
It's a brick of a book, and I'm not talking Lego.
THE ENDING. OMFG.
Every time the Gods are shown in these books it makes me feel like a puny mortal, and I love how real they seem even though they are so abstract and literally a myth.
There were several times in this book wherein a bit of Riordan's typical corny writing comes to play, something I would rather do without but am able to tolerate because there's a lot less of it in this book than there was in the previous series.I listened to the audiobook for this, but I think for the rest i'll be reading it physically since they're so fast and there are so many different characters, it might behoove me.
I thought the Percy Jackson series was fun, but I like this one a lot more!
The characters are in their teens now and the tone seems like it's aimed at a slightly older audience than the previous series.I loved all three POVs (especially the diversity)!
(view spoiler)[I love the idea of there being a Roman version of Camp Half-Blood and that Percy Jackson is currently over there with amnesia because he swapped places with Jason.
(hide spoiler)] The blending of Roman & Greek mythology added a lot.
So there's lots of potential here and I'll definitely be continuing this series.
Each of these characters are dealing with something:-	Jason lost the entirety of his memory -	Piper is hiding a terrible secret -	Leo is always dealing with ish so all this demigod business is just more for himJust like all of Uncle Rick’s books, there’s action, cuteness, and lots and lots of adventure involved.
Like I understand, it’s great, your characters rock, you deal with so much important ish, but 500 pages man, lessen that please.
So we better be seeing some more Percabeth in book 2 or else .
( 3.7 STARS )This was really great, it felt amazing to be back in Percy Jackson's world (despite the fact he wasn't in this one).I loved the new characters and the new ideas within the plot!
It was also really nice to see old characters and references to the Percy Jackson series, they were brought in nicely and worked really well!The only thing that let this book down was the fact I felt like the plot was very similar to the lightning thief.
But, the twists in the story redeemed it as it kept me hooked and wanting more.Will be reading the rest of this series without a doubt, looking forward to seeing Percy make a return!!
It made their motives and actions have a much bigger impact on the overall arc of the story, which really helped build my enthusiasm for what's to come.So, good characters aside, I have mixed feelings about the actual plot of The Lost Hero.
Now that I know the main conflict of this series (introduced at the end of Lost Hero, which might be part of the initial issue even though I really loved the "reveal"), I like where Riordan is going with the story.
However if you're like me and late to the party, I would only recommend this Heroes of Olympus series if you've already read (and loved) Percy Jackson.
There were a lot of questions of who everyone's parents were so Piper's godly parent surprised me but it I thought it was pretty cool.
And some of the events that took place in the first series make a little more sense once you read The Lost Hero.
The characters are wonderful!Throughout the whole book, you're asking questions beyond where's Percy.
Riordan gives you just enough answers to appease you but then (a lot of the time) you have more questions you want answered after the new revelations.
I guess I should.) Of course, we can't discuss this book without discussing the original Percy Jackson and the Olympians.
The most important thing about Percy was that he evolved over the course of his series.
The only interesting character of the trio proves to be Leo, who is haunted, a little insecure, and on occasion jealous.But ever since The Last Olympian itself, all of Riordan's books have lacked something.
Riordan is trying to write a different series about different heroes in a different voice, but he has retained the writing style of the previous books, something which should not have happened.
"what grade are you in?" "What do you do up there in Detroit?" "Is this your first visit to unnamed water park?" ect.One thing I like to ask kids is "What is your favorite subject?" Nine times out of ten you get "recess" or "gym" (the kiss ups say Art), but Ashley said English.Me: So, do they have you read a lot of books?Ashley: um.....uh huh!Me: What are you reading right now?Ashley: Mocking Jay, the 3rd Hunger Games book.
I'm Peeta all the way.So the conversation continues through the sketch, I go up to the register to ring up the parents whom are looking at me with an odd expression on their faces.
LOVED this book!
In the Lost Hero, Jason (a demigod) finds himself in Camp Half-Blood with no memories and two new demigod friends, Piper and Leo. Around the same time, Percy disappears without a trace.
The three friends embark on a quest to rescue a captured Hera and fulfill a new prophecy.My enjoyment of the Lost Hero was hindered by the fact that I disliked Jason, the leader of the gang.
I also wasn't a huge fan of the Piper/Jason pairing.
Piper could have been so strong and awesome, with her intelligence and charmspeak, but she just spent most of the book fawning over Jason.
Definitely my new favorite series! Too bad Percy's not here but I'm looking forward to seeing him in the next book. Jason, Pipper and Leo are the best although I kind of feel bad for Leo for always being the third wheel hahaha. He's actually my favorite out of the trio. He's literally the cutest character I've ever seen.
The plot was way more complex and I loved being in 3 character's heads instead of just one.
#notevensadSo we have 3 POVs: Jason, Piper, and Leo. I was wary that it'd be another Annabeth/Percy/Grover trio BUT NOPE.
I mean, I love Annabeth and Percy, but there was so much mystery surrounding these three.
I love you, Leo. You are easily the best character in the book.
The plot followed the typical Send-Kids-On-Potentially-Lethal-Quest format that all Riordan's books have.
I'm easily sold to loving these new characters, but, ya know, if Jason gets more interesting that would be epic.
(4.5 stars) People where not joking when they said it was even better than the Percy Jackson books! Cannot wait to get book 2!
Para nada, amé toda la historia incluso después de adivinar el paradero de Percy como 100 páginas antes de terminar el libro, que es donde revelan su paradero.
Como dije antes, todo se trata de puentes...La forma en que el autor incluye en el universo las romanas de los dioses griegos, los enfrentamientos, las apariciones de nuevos enemigos mortales, los titanes, gigantes, monstruos, TODO; absolutamente todo es digno de resaltar.
Eso sí, su humor y su forma de narrar es única e irremplazable.Jason, Piper y Leo: me encantaron.
Final rating: 5/5 starsFinal rating - for the whole series: 5.5/5 stars   “It'll be dangerous," Nyssa warned him. "Hardship, monsters, terrible suffering. Possibly none of you will come back alive.""Oh." Suddenly Leo didn't look so excited. Then he remembered everyone was watching. "I mean... Oh, cool! Suffering? I love suffering! Let's do this.”  Wow, i have to say, this series seemed addicting right from the start. As soon as i heard about this spin off series, i had to read it. But first, i h
Also, this books follows three POVs - Leo,Jason & Piper.
: ____________________________________________If you read PJ before, you should remember the prophecy that was spoken at the end of the fifth book.
And the appearance of the 3 teenagers, Piper,Leo and Jason makes it even more confusing for them.
All of that to escape the painful history he had, and to hide the pain he still feels.Characters from Camp Half-Blood still appear, like Annabeth, Clarisse and some others, but i was sad because there was no Nico, or Percy in this book.
Possibly more like a 3.5 because it was great to be back in the world in general, but I'm not sold on all of the new characters yet. It was so much fun to see some old faces though!
So here is the part that struck me Haley was diagnosed to have ADHD and dyslexia and that's the reason why Percy Jackson is created as a demigod with ADHD and dyslexia.I have to admit that when I've first heard about the story I cried because I think that what Riordan did for Haley was really sweet and it shows that he really loves Haley no matter what.
A glossary of the gods at the end of the book (love it!>.<)My Spoilery Review For those who have already read it.
When she was claimed as Aphrodite's daughter I was like WTH is Rick Riordan's thinking O.o???
Leído en Enero del 2016Yo durante todo el libro... ¿O era Annabeth la que estaba así?Es extraño leer un libro de Percy Jackson sin Percy Jackson, pero Riordan lo compensa incluyendo a nuevos héroes, esta vez nos presentara a  Jason, Piper y Leo , ellos tendrán una misión especial provista por la diosa Hera ¿o era Juno? Siempre las confundo, como sea, esto conlleva a una aventura llena de peligros, monstruos, Dioses excéntricos, y momentos de comedia y amistad; muy al estilo de Riordan que conoce

Siempre las confundo, como sea, esto conlleva a una aventura llena de peligros, monstruos, Dioses excéntricos, y momentos de comedia y amistad; muy al estilo de Riordan que conocemos y amamos.
Debo mencionar que me encanto el hecho de la inclusión de personajes latinos y aborígenes americanos, como coprotagonistas, así como también disfrute mucho de toda la historia, aunque, claro, cuando se trata de libros del tío Rick, no soy muy imparcial.Entonces tenemos, una nueva profecía, un nuevo comienzo, nuevos semidioses, nuevos enemigos, más mitología griega, y ahora mitología romana… ¿qué más se puede pedir?
