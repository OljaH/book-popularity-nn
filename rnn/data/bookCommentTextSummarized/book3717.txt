I read it again, and I'm bumping my rating up to 5 stars.The story begins and ends on the day of the funeral of Miss Emily Grierson, an institution in her southern town.
We had long thought of them as a tableau, Miss Emily a slender figure in white in the background, her father a spraddled silhouette in the foreground, his back to her and clutching a horsewhip, the two of them framed by the back-flung front door.Time becomes fluid as stories and events from Emily's life are shared with the reader.
A classic, literary short story that will give you the ultimate creeps. A Rose for Emily is a dark, disturbing but strongly evocatively written tale rich in symbols, ironies and vivid imagery and remarkably depicts the consequences of living in and wanting to preserve one’s glorious past. You can read the short story here.
The story opens with a brief first-person account of the funeral of Emily Grierson, an elderly Southern woman whose funeral is the obligation of their small town.
The townspeople pity Emily not only after her father's death but also during his life when he wouldn't let Emily marry.
With the acceptance of her father's death, Emily somewhat revives, even changing the style of her hair and becomes friendly with Homer Barron.
Emily’s distant cousins are called into town by the minister’s wife to supervise Miss Emily and Homer Barron.
We did not say she was crazy then. We believed she had to do that. We remembered all the young men her father had driven away, and we knew that with nothing left, she would have to cling to that which had robbed her, as people will.

The second William Faulkner short story I have read turned out to be an absolute success.
On diverting, brief eight pages, Faulkner manages to introduce his readers to the character of Miss Emily Grierson, a woman marked by loneliness and bitterness.
And it succeeds on each and every level.The story starts off with a slow narration, recounting the life of Emily Grierson until Faulkner's final revelation will step around the corner and confront you totally unexpectedly.
It is impossible to talk about this story without spoiling its most important turn of events, so I will leave this review at a whole-hearted recommendation for you to read it.
William Faulkner's A Rose for Emily: The Town as Narrator and AccompliceThis classic Southern gothic story was chosen as a Moderators' Choice for members of  On the Southern Literary Trail  for October, 2014.  WHEN Miss Emily Grierson died, our whole town went to her funeral: the men through a sort of respectful affection for a fallen monument, the women mostly out of curiosity to see the inside of her house, which no one save an old man-servant--a combined gardener and cook--had seen in at leas
WHEN Miss Emily Grierson died, our whole town went to her funeral: the men through a sort of respectful affection for a fallen monument, the women mostly out of curiosity to see the inside of her house, which no one save an old man-servant--a combined gardener and cook--had seen in at least ten years.
Alive, Miss Emily had been a tradition, a duty, and a care; a sort of hereditary obligation upon the town, dating from that day in 1894 when Colonel Sartoris, the mayor--he who fathered the edict that no Negro woman should appear on the streets without an apron-remitted her taxes, the dispensation dating from the death of her father on into perpetuity.
واقعا چه داستان کوتاه غافل گیر کننده ای بود ! فقط انتهاش رو سه بار خوندم تا از بهت در بیام و هضم کنم که چی شده و امیلی چه دلباخته ی خودخواهی بوده که دست به این کار زده و سالها تونسته از همه این راز بزرگ و مخوف رو اینقدر زیرکانه پنهان کنه , نمیدونم این دیگه چه جور عشقی میتونه باشه ولی من هنوز در بهتم ؛ احتمالا این عشق نیست بلکه یک جور جنون و خودخواهی محض هست که همیشه با عشق اشتباه گرفته میشه ...
This wasn't really recommended to me by Aj. My curiosity just got the best of me after reading Aj's short but informative review here and Rachel's review.I honestly have to read this short story twice for the story to actually sink in.
I didn't know where the story was about or where it will lead to at first everything started to make sense the more you delve into the story, but I just have to read it again - to know if there were some clues and hints out there I missed before the genius Faulkner dropped the horrifying and disturbing bomb.The writing and narration of the story was somewhat inviting the readers to ride and live with the town to reminisce the pitiful life of Emily, alone on the big house, left to carry the legacy of being the last Grierson, and it was one of the best ride!
This is some kind of a gothic story that tells you about a woman(EMILY), from a wealthy and respecta
داستان اول رو خوندم،اولین تجربه من از فاکنر هستش. پسر کتاب فروش پیشنهادش کرد . امیدوارم همون قدر که گفت عالی باشهخب ! دارم ریویوو رو ادیت میکنم =)) خیلی کتاب جالبی بود، ۶ تا داستان کوتاه عالی که امیلی و دوسال از از محبوبترین های من بودن با اون پایان های اصغر فرهادی طور. نمیدونم چرا برادران کوئن تا حالا از روی این کتاب فیلم نساختن. بنظرم چیز فوق العاده ای مثل تصنیف باستر اسکراگز از آب دربیاد
❎   DON'T BE DECEIVED BY THE TITLE. NO ONE'S GETTING ANY ROSES.  I had to read this story twice to grasp it fully. But after a reading count of two, I still am not able to decipher who the hell the speaker is. And yes, this bothers me slightly. But I'll say it, this was one beautiful - short - piece of gothic literature. The fascinating thing about the mysterious identity of the narrator is it didn't take away from the story, if anything, it yielded more intrigue and allure, causing me to be mor
The fascinating thing about the mysterious identity of the narrator is it didn't take away from the story, if anything, it yielded more intrigue and allure, causing me to be more attuned to the foreboding sense of darkness and doom throughout the story.
That's something you absolutely can't tell.This story is about Miss Emily from the prestigious Grierson family, who lived in a prestigious eyesore of an house.
Miss Emily, as the narrator describes is something of a monument.
But no, Miss Emily is not your average heroine, you'll just have to read it to find out why.
A big reason why I read writers like Faulkner is because of beautiful metaphors like this;"and the very old men--some in their brushed Confederate uniforms--on the porch and the lawn, talking of Miss Emily as if she had been a contemporary of theirs, believing that they had danced with her and courted her perhaps, confusing time with its mathematical progression, as the old do, to whom all the past is not a diminishing road but, instead, a huge meadow which no winter ever quite touches, divided from them now by the narrow bottle-neck of the most recent decade of years." Well of course after a metaphor like that I was perfectly satisfied, and all was right with the world at that moment.
این یک مساله مهم است، چرا که نشان می دهد از زمان کلنل سارتوریس تا به حال، زمانه چه قدر دچار تغییر شده است.
با این بخش از داستان مشخص می شود که خانم امیلی تا چه حد در گذشته غرق شده است، زندگی او هم چنان با رسوم و سنت های گذشته پیوند خورده است.
موارد مختلفی در داستان وجود دارد که نشان می دهد خانم امیلی نمی تواند گذشته را رها کند.
در پایان داستان خواننده متوجه می شود که خانم امیلی حتی هومر را هم رها نکرده است.
حالا که بایس بری برو . اما علتش را من نمی فهمم و هیچ وقت هم نمی خوام بفهمم . دیگه از من انتظار فهمیدنشو نداشته باش .
Like a long-lost uncle who is always kind of looking out for me, and remains a lingering presence, but who is intimidating, and just a little bit scary.
It centers around a young woman named Emily who has this kind of "untouchable" mysterious air about her.
As an old woman, Emily no longer has her beauty, but people still remember her in her prime, and long to discover her secrets.
The story slowly and beautifully unravels the mysteries and secrets surrounding Emily, and finally results in a climax which has haunted me for fourteen years since I first read this story as a high school junior.
این مرد، همان هومر بارون است که سالیان پیش چند روز پس از آشنایی با امیلی ناپدید شده بود و به این صورت، تراژدی بزرگی شکل میگیرد...ویلیام فالکنر در داستان "یک گل سرخ برای امیلی " به جستجو در درون انسان هایی می پردازد که از مکنت مالی و نفوذ فراوانی در جامعه امریکایی برخوردارند و در واقع این نفوذ و مکنت ، به آنان اصالت بخشیده است ؛ اما این اصالت سبب تنهایی صاحبان خود شده است.امیلی و خاندانش به پشتوانه همین اصالت خانوادگی ، با هیچکس در ارتباط نیستند، با کسی مراوده ای ندارند و نشست و برخاست نمی کنند؛ چرا که گمان می برند ارتباطی کوچک با خانواده های غیراصیل ، آنان را از اصالت خانوادگی خود دور میکند.خانواده میس امیلی گریرسن ، نماد چنین خانواده هایی است ؛ آنانی که برای به دست آوردن یک چیز - که همان اعتبار و نفوذ و اصالت است - خیلی چیزهای دیگر را از دست می دهند.
Revisited after 20 years because I wanted to compare to a short story written by William Gay, The Paperhanger. I definitely like shock factor in literature. Faulkner perfected this story.
یادم میاد توی کتابی مصاحبه نجف دریابندری رو خوندم که توش نوشته بود یک گل سرخ برای امیلی جزو اولین ترجمه هاش بوده که بعد از سال ها وقتی دوباره رفته خونده با خودش فکر کرده که چه ترجمه فاجعه ایه!
:)) به خاطر همین من از اولی که داستان ترجمه رو خوندم روی ضعف هاش کلید نکردم چون می دونستم جزو اولین کارهاش بوده و به خاطر اینکه خودمم مترجم تازه کار هستم خیلی درکش می کردم.
در مورد داستان...
یکی از قشنگ ترین داستان های کوتاه گوتیکی که می شه خوند.
این اولین اثریه که از ویلیام فاکنر خوندم و خیلی دوسش داشتم.

مردی از راه می رسید که با امیلی بیرون می رود اما مردم شهر فکر می کنند مردی اهل ازدواج نیست.
This is an extremely atmospheric and downright creepy short story. It makes me believe that I can learn to love Faulkner. A Rose for Emily
ألا يمكن أن يجتمع كلا الأمرين !معا؟🌟🌟🌟🌟سقف جديد للرب حريق آخر و أب و إبنه أبطال للرواية لكن ما خلف السطور نقد لنظام العمل الذي تم تطبيقه في الأرياف...و كأن فوكنر يقول لنا بأنه عندما يسيطر الجشع على النفوس لن يسلم منه شيء...
یک جمله در این داستان کوتاه تخطی از زاویه دید داره. هر کی بگه من جایزه بهش میدم

I came to know about this book through the song 'In The End' by My Chemical Romance, which is inspired on this book. And I must say, this is the greatest story ever written. While the story is most macabre, for me it also shows the ultimate end of Romance and Love.I don't want to spoil the story or the amazing plot, so please just read it!
ینی وااقعاً باید باور کنم که کتاب لیدی ال - رومن گاری یک کپی از روی این داستان فاکنر بوده!!؟از اول که کتاب رو شروع کردم هی داشتم به خودم میگفتم نـــــه چقدر شبیه لیدی ال و فضای اون داستانه و وقتی به انتها رسید یقین پیدا کردم که بله همینطوره و من اشتباه نکرده بودم
باز هم فاکنر است و توصیف دردی -یا درینجا دردهایی- که با عمق استخوانت لمس میشود.

"A Rose for Emily" was my first encounter with Faulkner and I must say it feels like I drew the long straw because I loved the story and it piqued my interest for further Faulkner literature.
Had I started with "The Sound and the Fury" or "As I Lay Dying", I'm afraid I wouldn't have liked him that much - but honestly I have no way of telling as I haven't read those books."A Rose for Emily" was great because it was one of those amazing things that happen to you and you don't even realize it until it's over.
It seems like Ms. Emily is observed by many people, through different sets of eyes and it does follow a pretty uncommon POV, it's not described as first person singular "I", but first person plural  "we".
The last line is my favorite though!Throughout the whole story, the author plays with the reader, like a cat plays with a mouse, pretty merciless author, right ?
Now, let me get one thing very clear, this POV could really really rattle your brain, so keep it in mind that the TOWN is the narrator.Long story short: It is a pretty good story with well balanced suspense and thrill!
تقابل سنت و مدرنیته...امیلی،از خانواده ای اصیل زاده،سنتی و مغرور است.اگر هومر را نماد مدرنیته بدانیم؛ آنچه رخ میدهد کشته شدن مدرنیسم توسط سنتگرایان ست.جایی که امیلی توان تغییر و تطبیق خود با معیارهای امروزی هومررا نداشت، با کشتنش او را تبدیل به جسدی سرد چون نیاکانش کرده و در کنار جسد وی زندگی را میگذراند.. در حقیقت میتوان گفت هومر را با معیارهای خود تطبیق میدهد..در این داستان هم امیلی و هم هومر دارای نقاط ضعفی بوده و هیج یک کامل نیستند و در نهایت هردو میمیرند،هم سنت و هم تجدد
Who said graphic imagery is required to make a person shudder? William Faulkner, with this subtle southern gothic story will make your jaw drop in horror at the climax. This excellent short story will leave a long lasting impression on your mind, and so will the enigmatic Emily.  Recommended!
This collection of short stories was just so so for me. Faulkners writing is masterful as always but the stories all ended leaving me with a feeling of "what was the point?"
Move over Glenn Close, Miss Emily Grierson just showed you up!This is disturbing gothic necrophilia of the first order, and I did NOT see the last line of this story coming.
How unsettling.Faulkner really delves into the more murky, psychological side of the gothic here instead of relying on its traditional set pieces (endangered young heroine, decaying castles, etc.).Emily really channels a darker Miss Havisham from GREAT EXPECTATIONS.
And like Miss Havisham, Emily is obsessed with holding onto a lost moment in time.One would think that Emily's father would be familiar with the root cause of Romeo and Juliette's plight.
