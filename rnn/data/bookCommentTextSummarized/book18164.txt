What she does best here is get the balance right between fast-paced action/adventure scenes and character development, I now have no doubt in my mind as to whether I'll be reading the next book.In Through the Ever Night, Perry and Aria face many challenges to their relationship and to their lives.
I enjoyed it immensely and I can't imagine I will be forgetting the hilarious duet scene with Aria and Roar for a long while............................................................................................................Before reading:Who is this dude and what has he done with Perry?Okay, firstly: "His hair looked like it had never seen a brush.
Third Time Read Review  MINI REVIEW IS POSTED My thoughts about this book is practically the same as the first and the second time I read it. It is the third time I read this book, but when I read it for the third time, I found out some information about this book that I didn't know. I don't know whether I didn't catch these information the first and the second time I read it or maybe I forgot them? *shrugs* This book is more frustrating compared to the first book. The first book was fun for me

If you want to know more about what I think toward this book, you can read my second time read review.
this book broke my heart so badly and this was the second time I read this book but nothing changed.
like my life was just  perfect  but I looked like this on the inside I just loved this book so much.
This review contains spoilers for Under the Never Sky. Recently--and far too often, if you ask me--in young adult trilogies, second installments have been widely known to be practically a resting point for both the author, and the characters and the plot. Instead of what should be an intense ride setting up for the final installment, the second installment in a trilogy is, more often than not, a complete and utter bore ending with a bang to lure readers who were less than impressed with the sec
One of my favorite things about the Under the Never Sky trilogy so far is the relationships and character dynamics that Veronica Rossi so masterly develops throughout the course of the novels.
The romance between Perry and Aria will most likely end up being one of my favorites in young adult by the end of the trilogy, and the thing I have to say I love most about the romance in this trilogy is that, while it is certainly an important factor, it never overshadows other factors such as the plot--which appears to be another case of Rossi not receiving a memo most authors, unfortunately, have.
TIP: DONT read your favorite book series when you're sick. I finished it without much feels and was not able to dive and lose myself into the story. I know, the blame is on me. Will read again. :)~~~~~gotta stay alive 'til 2013 for this...gosh. not even a synopsis? :(
(I know I’m terrible, but I just can’t stand anyone of you like/love/adore her!)Okay, enough for the villain, let’s move on to some good and funny characters, shall we?We all know that Perry became the Blood Lord of the Tide after the quick battle with his brother, Vale, in the previous book, and now he just bumped into a group of awesome fighters who happened to be somewhere in the woods in the same day he thought he’d never see Aria again.
I didn’t feel like wailing or sobbing when those moments happened (which was weird because I think I should), but the ache I felt in my heart was so real.
I don’t usually like to reference character hotness as a selling point in a book – but these two don’t even need to touch to be steaming up the pages which (now that I think about it, is probably a fire hazard).
As always, some of the best parts about Rossi’s writing is the litany of secondary characters – Roar being one serious MVP.Once again his wit and personality bring a much needed buoyancy and humour to an otherwise action-packed, edge of your seat, angst fest that left me clutching the book yelling, “What?!
Oh my god howwillieversurvive!?!” You know it’s been a good book when you’re left thinking, “Oh yeah!
“Love is a rebellious bird that nobody can tame.” A great sequel to Under the Never Sky.I especially enjoyed watching Aria's relationships with Perry and Roar unfold.
There was hardly any relationship drama, just a few tiny twinges of jealousy from Perry's side.
In all the books I've read, couples go through different stages in their relationships.
There's ups and downs (e.g. Clary&Jace, Tris&Four, Gwyneth&Gideon) in many of those books, so it's refreshing to read of romance that spares you from most of the drama.
(view spoiler)[...and really disappointed that she died a few chapters later.
Give it to me, she wanted to scream. Give me the pain. Let me take it from you.  4.5 stars. Why you hurt me, book? Please forgive me for being stuck in kittah speak, but for the love of all that's good, WHY?!?You are toying with my emotions, Ms. Rossi. I don't know whether to be impressed or angry over the gut punch that I just felt. Of course, the part of me which questions everything is not going to take this lying down. I will get back up and seek out answers. I am not convinced that what j
For whatever reason that makes no sense to me, I'm somehow happy with the world outside of the realms and the stories and interactions happening on the side of the coin we're staring at.My poor heart was overwhelmed for most of this book.
Perry was different in this book, but in a good way.
She was smiling.Perry brushed her hair away from her shoulder and breathed her in, letting the strength of her temper bring him back.
Yes, there is more to all of this world than just emotions and lovely characters.
Like its predecessor, it’s told from both Aria and Perry’s point of view, and while third person alternating view is by far my least favorite narrative mode, Rossi made it work splendidly.
He is a far cry from that rash, headstrong boy we know from Under the Never Sky, and if I had to choose one thing that really stood out in this book, it would be his characterization – the subtle changes found between the lines, but perhaps more important for the remainder of the story than everything else put together.There are things in Through the Ever Night that will make you laugh, things that will make you cry, things that will make you inch up nervously in your seat, some that will make you angry enough to punch something (hopefully not someone, though), and things that will make you swoon.
We pick up right where the story left off in Under the Never Sky where Aria and Perry meet again.
I loved Under the Never Sky but I think this surpasses that story, something almost unheard of with a sequel.
I loved the romance between Perry and Aria.
Their characters are so well fleshed out, and you feel their concerns, despair, joy, and love right along with them.
I really like the way things are shaping up, and I think the next story has real potential to be just as exciting as this one.
"We lose and lose, but we're still here."•I never expected this to be a major issue in this review, but I can't deny it kept my mind occupied far more than I'd liked: the romance.
It's easy to read and entertaining, and those are perks I can't in any way ignore, but besides that, there's very little to save.➽ I hoped in an improvement on the first book, which, in all fairness, was not half bad to begin with, but I think it legit to expect something more from the second installment, be it a trilogy or a longer series.
3.5Will these books ever cease to surprise me?!?!?This is the second book in a trilogy.  I.DID.NOT.HATE.IT!  I just...I...what?This series has honestly surprised me to no end. I'm very wary when I go into second books from a trilogy, like, I go with the lowest expectations because I know they're bound to be slow, I know nothing really happens and always tend to expect the worst (even though the worst still manages to piss me off). So going into this book and coming out as happy as I did. Look, I
I'm very wary when I go into second books from a trilogy, like, I go with the lowest expectations because I know they're bound to be slow, I know nothing really happens and always tend to expect the worst (even though the worst still manages to piss me off).
So going into this book and coming out as happy as I did.
Seriously Rossi, thank you.
You can practically taste the love these characters have.
I love these characters!
I mean this woman had me scared of turning to the next page never knowing what was going to happen.
Seriously Rossi, I'm going to repeat myself.
Once again, Veronica Rossi has proved her prowess as a writer and if there's anything I can guarantee, it's that fans of the series will most definitely not be disappointed by this scintillating sequel.Through the Ever Night picks up exactly where Under the Never Sky left off with the reunion of Aria and Perry.
I love that Rossi made Aria just as much a friend to Roar as Perry and furthermore, that she made Roar such a huge forefront in this novel.
In the first book, I clearly am annoyed at Cinder but in this, I love him.
Such a cute lovely boy going through puberty.
I did love Reef for he was a fatherly-figure.
And I almost (i don't usually cry!) cried while reading what happened to Roar and no, he did not die.And tbh, I expected more of Brooke's sassiness and rudeness but oh well, she only released fumes in like the beginning which I am completely okay with.
The happenings were just so heartbreaking, bitter, and beautiful at the same time.
Στο δεύτερο μέρος της σειράς, οι αγαπημένοι μας ήρωες, παλεύουν για να βρουν μια θέση, ένα σπίτι κάτω από τον ξένο ουρανό.
Αυτή είναι μια συνειδητοποίηση που την πληγώνει και την διώχνει ολοένα και πιο μακριά από τον αγαπημένο της.
Στην μέση όλων αυτών, ο αγαπημένος πλέον σε όσους έχουν διαβάσει τα βιβλία Ρόαρ, ψάχνει την εξαφανισμένη του από προσώπου γης αγάπη…Στην πλοκή περιπλέκονται ο κόσμος που διαλύεται, φυλές που αλληλοσπαράζονται, κρυφές συμφωνίες, μεγάλες προδοσίες, δολοφονίες και ο μικρούλης Σιντερ, που μπορεί να σώσει την κατάσταση (εν μέρει) αλλά δεν έχει ιδέα πως… Συνάμα, το όνειρο για την γη με τον γαλάζιο ουρανό και τις κίτρινες και κόκκινες πεταλουδίτσες, που πετούν χαρωπά ξεμακραίνει ολοένα και περισσότερο…!Πολύ δυνατό!"Ζω ήδη, αρνούμαι να με κυνηγά ο ουρανός".σελ.
Perry and Aria's adventure is just so fast-paced and exciting, it never gets boring.Though I don't remember absolutely everything about the first book, it was pretty easy to get back into this.
I'm glad Aria's and Roar's relationship stayed platonic though, I wouldn't have it any other way.The one thing I didn't like was that the book was a bit too fast-paced in my opinion, at times I felt that the story could have been a bit more elaborate instead of going from one action-packed scene to the next!
I NEED THE NEXT BOOK NOW
The second book to trilogies usually is always literally secondary to its prequel including the greatness of the story. So often, when I read the second book in a trilogy, I set my expectations low. But this book surprised me because it's just as amazing if not even better than the first that I couldn't help tear through the pages to finish it and get my hands on the third book.
I can't believe that he loves Aria as much as he claims when he had so little faith and trust in her and when he was desiring someone else and was so affected by some other girl — it actually seemed like his reactions to Kirra conveyed more passion than when he was with Aria.
I hope Aria finds out about Perry having sexy feelings and thoughts for another girl (Although, I bet if it is mentioned Aria will just forgive and forget like the typical doormat heroine).
Yes, there are other people who are hoping to stand in their way of finding the Still Blue, but no-one owns them; the fight is always to stay alive first and hope for a better world second.I was glad to be thrown into the familiar switching POVs – the same as how they were in ‘Under the Never Sky’ – changing between Aria and Perry, but different in that a lot of the novel happens when they’re apart from each other.
😭😭 Well this was sad! I'm nervous about the last book. I hope all the people I hate, die and all the people I love, be at peace 😪. RTC
Plus, the action sequences are handled way better – rather than the cannibal attacks or aimless wandering through the wilderness as before, Rossi actually uses the postapocalyptic disaster setting she’s created to challenge and develop her characters, something I would’ve never expected from reading Under the Never Sky.Take Perry, for example, who takes on a shit load of new responsibilities now that he’s the Blood Lord of the Tides.
This book made me cry like a little baby while riding the bus.
I can hold it back most of the time, but in this book?!
I loved knowing more about this world, I loved meeting the new characters and knowing more about the ones we met in the first book.
I still love Perry more than life and the girl just keeps getting better.
I loved everyone getting reunited and every separation broke me in half, some more than others.I need to read Into the Still Blue ASAP.
A mi esta saga me encanta, el primer libro fue maravilloso y aunque este lo sentí un poco lento también me gustó bastante.La estructura del mundo creado por la autora es súper original y los personajes me encantan, quedo con muchas ganas de leer el tercer y último libro de la saga. Reseña Completa: http://bastvilard.blogspot.com/2015/0...
No review can justify the awesomeness of Veronica Rossi's latest book in her Under The Never Sky Trilogy.
I am trying to keep this review as spoiler-free as possible.You know a book is great when you can't stop reading it and when it's over you feel like the book left an impact on you.
I really love Perry and Aria!
I loved how much action, adventure, and romance Rossi packed into this book.
Veronica Rossi creates such vivid descriptions that you really feel like you are in Reverie.
If you loved Under the Never Sky then you must read Through the Ever Night.
Way too far away....
Days were darkened by clouds and the blue cast of Aether. Nights were brightened by the same. They flowed together, the edges blurring into an endless day. An ever night. This book two of the Under the Never Sky trilogy is naturally magnificent. The world building was great. I fully understand now the concept and the goal of this trilogy; Veronica is such a good writer in weaving and interweaving words, sentences, to come up with thoughts you could never imagine. Love, friendship, dreams, happi
Days were darkened by clouds and the blue cast of Aether.
Nights were brightened by the same.
An ever night.
This book two of the Under the Never Sky trilogy is naturally magnificent.
Love, friendship, dreams, happiness, melancholy, to live, to strive and to survive are properly blended.
I wasn't bored on every chapter of this awesome book.
Love interests kept me smiling.
I still can't get out on the tension and emotion it brings.The Aether storm.
And how Cinder used the power of this deadly storm.
And with that, I'm ready to go into the Still Blue.
Yes, I'm ready.
Through The Ever Night captivated my attention and made me an emotional mess. I was constantly flitting between butterflies, smiles, devastation and heartache. And by that last page, I realized that this series has easily become one of my favorite dystopian series ever! So saying I have HUGE expectations for the final book is definitely an understatement! While I keep my fingers crossed for what will happen next, here are some of my favorite things about this series so far: Perry held her agains
While I keep my fingers crossed for what will happen next, here are some of my favorite things about this series so far:
But this time around it almost felt like their world was a living and breathing entity.
But among those secondary characters, Roar was my favorite by far.
I grew to attached to him, and his fate became just as important to me as Perry and Aria's.
✮I loved how the story developed - As the pages unfolded, we were taken back to a struggle the existed in Under The Never Sky. Which was the stark differences between Aria and Perry.
**4.5 stars**Can I just say "la la la la la" and pretend some of this stuff in this book didn't happen??Veronica Rossi does not hold back!
She has the nerve to write such a kick a$$ sequel to Under the Never Sky and mess so so thoroughly with my emotions.
This book takes place right after "Under the Never Sky".
This book is just weighty with emotion.
I think Roar affected me the most in this book.
Now I can't (view spoiler)[read Roar and Viv. My heart, oh my heart.
I need some answers so badly that it physically hurts.Amazing book Ms. Rossi.
Atleast for a guy who has lived in the woods for all his life and basically doesn't own a decent shirt .After reading..Well let's just say , that things are much much clearer now and definitely much better.And also things make more sense now......what i loved about this book is the nice use of vivid imagination.
Every character played a pivotal role in this fantastic book!Leave Aria and Perry.
