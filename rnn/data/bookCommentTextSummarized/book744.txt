I tip my hat to the fine folks at Project Gutenberg: virtually every title I have or will be reading in the near future comes from them.The Orchard of Tears is the non-stereotype book that Sax Rohmer wrote in the last year of The Great War. It is very different from all of the Fu Manchu and Crime Drama books that made him a well-paid and in-demand author.
This free download to my Kindle was strange. The hero knew the "truth," and he was looked upon as almost the second "redeemer." The entire world eagerly awaited his books and writings -- i'm not sure i understood what he was saying -- i know that it involved reincarnation. in some cases, he was thought to be starting a new religion; in others, he was defining existing religions. I found it quite confusing but supposedly, it was one of Rohmer's easier-to-understand books. I really can't recommend it to anyone!
Weird and rambling, it never drew me in and frequently left me bored or confused. It has nuggets of good but is really bizarre, and not in a good way.
Somewhat rambling tale set in the first world war. Not as fluent as other stories by him that I've read.
