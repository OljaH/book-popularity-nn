It was ok. Love me some Wren.  He was odd even in the Were-Hunter world. When it came to the human world … they would lock him in a cage if they ever learned of him.

I loved Maggie and Wren together…their story is sweet and so heart-warming.
And he brings into her life what she has been looking for such a long time…..Loved their banter….
This morning it was 2005 in New Orleans, I was staring at you wondering what it would be like to have the ability to change into a tiger.
Now it’s the day before I enter the world in 1981 and I can turn into a tiger.
He never thought he’d feel anything like this.
I LOVED THIS BOOk! It is absolutely awesome! I loved both Wren and Maggie, a cute couple. Everything I've known about Were-Hunters is so intriguing. Near the end when Maggie got some power, I felt a bit surprised but I liked it because that made them had their sweet HEA eventually.This is a great series! I'm flying to the next book!
I absolutely loved this story!I can't believe I was lucky enough to read two great books in a row!Ok, I must admit, I forgot how much I liked this series.
And surprisingly, the 8th book is still really good!
Most of the times, after the first couple of books, a series becomes "meh".
The characters were lovely!
But this one was great!
It wasn't that annoying, gushy thing I usually don't appreciate in UFs. Nope, it was a cute, sweet, full of action and killing kind of plot.
There were even some things that I didn't expect, and I love surprises.
Cleverly measured tension, great suspense and worrisome conflicts, heartbreaking past, amazing secondary characters, and emotional, intimate, but also steamy erotic scenes.
He never thought he'd feel anything like this.
Both Wren and Maggie have insecurities, but slowly gain confidence from each other.Aside from one mistake in the time travel aspect of the story ( (view spoiler)[ If Wren’s father, Aristotle takes his brother, Grayson back to the past to kill him, then there has to be two Graysons at that time, and Aristotle only kills one of them.
I really want to know how it works.
This was a pretty standard Dark-Hunter book.
The books are usually light-hearted reads filled with plenty of romance, humor, and with just enough drama to keep things interesting.
I was equally happy with the way Marguerite's feelings for Wren helped to give her the courage to stand up to her father and finally live the life she wanted.
We met a few familiar faces from the previous Dark-Hunter books as they popped up to lend a hand to Wren.
This might not have been one of the very best Dark-Hunter books but it was still a worthwhile and fun read.
I loved Wren and Maggie.
Wren, as usual, had a heartbreaking history, but not nearly as bad as others.
Was it perfect - well no, but I am not sure anything is anymore.Overall, I loved Wren and all of his issues and I loved watching Maggie help him through them.
Wren was so sweet to her.
Mother Peltier - total bitch.There was some repetition from other books when event overlapped, but it was not bad because Maggie and Wren were not with others a lot.Safety gang notes (view spoiler)[Wren was a virgin, Maggie was not but not overly experienced.
(hide spoiler)]
Very sweet book.
Younger feeling, as the two main characters are college aged vs all those eons old DH's.
Wren: super antisocial busboy at the Sanctuary bar.
Maggie: law student, senator's daughter, super preppy proper type.
What I liked about this story: how kind & caring Maggie is to Wren & his responses to her kindness.
Seeing Wren's progression as he continues to interact with Maggie.
And the plot/villain is more of a side note, it does bring in new characters & Savitar - who's the older beach bum surfer dude version of Acheron.
Karakterlerden girmicem, Wren zaten ayrı mükemmel.
Ama hikaye, gidişat falan çok çok ayrı mükemmeldi.
Evet mate olayına aşığım, hatta Sherrilyn bunları eşlemeyecek diye çok korktum kitabın sonuna kadar içimden sövmediğim küfür bela kalmadı.Ama işte tam bu kitapta bize diyor ki Sherrilyn, o mating mark belki olayı dramatikleştirip özelleştiriyor lakin karakterlerin hissettiği aşk eşleşmeye bağlı bişi değil sayın okuyucular.Yine de eşleşme olmasaydı söverdim.
Gerçi ben Sherrilyn’e bayağı sövecek gibiyim Sav’ı yazmamış çünkü.
“Yahu ben hazırım kadın,” diye bağırmak geliyor içimden ama saldım artık gerçekten uğraşamayacağım başıma ağrılar giriyor.HayledieNot: “Mate” diyorum çünkü nasıl çevireceğimi bilmiyorum gerçekten.
“Eşleşmek/eş” “mate” kelimesini okurken hissettiğim şeyleri hissettirmiyormuş gibi geliyor.
ME VOLVÍ UNA ADICTA, creo que ya lo había dicho no?No sé cómo le hace Sherrilyn Kenyon, para hacer hombres taaan lindos, comestibles y que son fáciles de amar, pero es que cada protagonista tiene algo que los amas unos más que otros mis favoritos hasta ahorita sin contar a Ash son Vane y Zarek.Pero Wren es Mi hombre PERFECTO, para que conozcan algo de mí, me encantan los tigres y todo lo que sea de felinos pero en especial los tigres, y Wren es un hombre-tigre, por eso digo que sería mi hombre perfecto tendría dos en uno mi tigre y mi amante.
Esta historia es algo diferente tiene su punto de drama pero no tanto para moquear.
Animals are pretty straight forward.
That's all I could think of!Wren is a busboy at the Sanctuary and Maggie shows up their one night with her study group because they wanted to honor Nick, who they think is dead.
So, when one of the male douchebags notices that Wren is looking at Maggie, he decides to be a tough guy and throw his drink at the lowly busboy.
Wow, throwing your drink at another guy?
You have to throw something!Maggie feels bad about having jerk-ass friends and thus the great law student/busboy romance begins.This book was really cute and sweet.
No esta mal este libro pero no es mi top.
Wren se desvive advirtiéndole que él no tiene nada de normal y ella lo ignora, pero luego se le pasa porque no le queda de otra y ve por qué Wren no puede y no será jamás como el común de la gente y aún así sigue pensando que él está loco.
Si alguien te advierte que es parte de la especie más violenta y agresiva de la historia y que es peligroso para ella estar cerca, NO TE ACERCÁS, lo dice por tu bien, no te está tomando el pelo.
THE CRINGIEST BOOK OF THEM ALL.ugh.I honestly dont know why I didnt enjoy it as much as the previous 7 books....
But the characters felt super boring and plain and meh.
this whole book felt "meh" to me.
The relationship between Wren and Marguerite lacked of passion, and there were moments super unrealistic, even in this world.
UUGHH.(the very ending was amazing because we get to see Nick and I am refering to the very last page, the only interesting moment to me, tbh) Also...this "Savitar" character....
I want to know more about him.Apart from that...
a lotta repetition and foreshadowing and exchanging povs zillion times during one scene. plus- different voices fairly distinct, Wren; minus- aforementioned repetitivness and uninspired sex scenes.
♥♥♥Creo que esta mujer no va a dejar nunca de crear hombres que quiero en mi vida, historias que me hagan emocionar. Me ha gustado MUCHO ♥Wren ♥♥
Meet Wren Tigarian, the sexiest tigard alive ! [image error]Sebagai were-hunter, singa putih yang mendapat perlindungan di Sanctuary,bar milik Nicolleta, sang mama beruang, Wren bukan siapa2 selain busboy...tukang lap2 meja dan bersih2. Tapi siapa sangka, kalo dia adalah satu2 nya ahli waris terkaya setelah microsoft..ha !Masa lalu yg membuat Wren di ungsikan ke sanctuary ....Marguerite yang teman dekan Nick Gaultier, bosan, sejak Nick di kabarkan tewas, dia ingin pergi ketempat Nick biasa hang
[image error]Maggie penasaran sama Wren dan nyusul ke Sanctuary , dan kaget saat tahu Wren terluka karena dia.Saat di kamar Wren lah ciuman pertama yg memabukkan di terima Maggie dan membuat Maggie dan Wren ketagihan.Wren datang ke kampus Maggie buat menemui Maggie,lagi2 di hina karena penampilannya yg lusuh dengan rambut gimbal ala rasta nya itu, di serang lah teman Maggie yg menyebabkan Wren masuk kantor polisi.Maggie kaget saat mendengar berapa besar tebusan buat menjamin Wren, lebih kaget lagi saat dosen nya Dr.Julian Alexander (si handsoeme itu)dan Bill suami Serena yg menjamin Wren.Saat itu lah Maggie baru tau kalo Wren ternyata tajir berat.Tadi nya Wren ga mau lagi ketemu Maggie karena cuma menimbulkan masalah, eh,tapi malah dia cukur rambut,dandan rapi dengan baju mahal, datang ke kampus Maggie (yang bikin Maggie kaget setengah mati akan ke gantengan Wren)...bawa bunga dan coklat...ahaiiiii....
He lands in jail more than once.So he's not a guy I'd pursue in real life, is what I'm saying.We see his point of view alternating with hers and clearly understand why he does all of this stuff - Kenyon does succeed in making him a likable and sympathetic character.Maggie also is someone who seemed like a character to me and not a piece of cardboard.
She barely freaked when she found out the man she'd been having sex with was a were-tigard, and after (view spoiler)[Aristotle (Wren's father) violates her by biting her against her will and transferring his mother's were-tiger powers into her.
Actually he’s a were-Tigard which makes him part human as well.
Whatever… he’s achingly gorgeous, and a bit of a loose cannon but at the same time is absolutely swoony with a very gentle soul.
Living a life that she hates, she is drawn to the charismatic Wren the moment she first sees him bussing tables at Sanctuary.
We get to revisit with some of the characters we met in previous books (including Julian, Vane and Fang), which I loved, but best side character award (in the absence of my beloved Acheron) has to go to Savitar, he’s hilarious!
Reread- Oct 2015Every time I pick up a Sherrilyn Kenyon book, I know I'll be doing nothing that day as I get lost in her amazing world of sexy, swoonworthy heroes and sassy, quick-witted, fierce heroines.
I devoured Wren and Maggie's book and now that I'm done, I'm so sad it's over.
I don't know what it is about the Dark Hunter Universe, but I was hooked from the very beginning and each book get better even when it seems impossible.
There's not a single thing about Wren and Maggie that I didn't love.
They're easily one of my favorite DH couples, but then again, I say that after every single books.
Each book makes me want to read about a specific character for the next one.
When I saw Wren in either Night Play or one of the others I can't even remember now I have binged so much of these I really wanted to read his book!Wren's mother was certifiable.
She is on par with Umbridge from Harry Potter and that's saying a LOT.I am so happy that they are now mates!
Thanks Nick!
Or I guess Savitar but Nick was the one who asked.
I am also really happy that Wren's dad is alive!
I have a lot of questions about his motivation.
*4.5 Stars*I loved Wren and Maggie! Wren had my heart from the beginning, poor, misunderstood, sweetheart that he is and Maggie who never judged him when so many others did. The storyline was exciting and full of action with convoluted time travel elements that prevented me from putting it down! The ending was fantastic and I liked how their mating played out, Fates be damned!!
First time read - July 2010 ( I think) - 5 starsSecond time read - July 2015 - 5 stars This book and Night Pleasure are my favorite from Sherrilyn Kenyon so far. There are also the first two I've read by her.
I just love how it started, my favourite line from the first page:“Life is a soul-sucking test that you either survive or fail.
Wren and Maggie travel back in time to get proof that Wren didn’t kill his parents, where Wren’s father bites Marguerite in tiger form effectively giving her animal powers, making her a were-tiger.
Lots of twists and turns in this book, the way everything turned out with Wren’s father was unexpected and I loved how Maggie loved Wren before she knew how much money he had, she loved him or who he was on the inside not what his standing was.
I don't know much about Savitar except for the fact that he is supposedly training Nick to be a Dark Hunter, however, I have a feeling there is something else planned for Nick besides being a Dark Hunter.I'm glad Wren came out of his shell and faced his past to learn the truth of what really happened to his family.
I'm glad he met Maggie and learned to trust.
I love Wren.
I read Sherrilyn Kenyon's Bad Moon Rising before I read this book, and if you have read BMR, you know that Wren is in that book to an extent because it overlaps with Unleash the Night.
I liked this story in that Wren and Maggie faced many challenges and through them all, they basically stayed together.
What was most surprising was the revelation of Wren's father being alive all this time.
I adored seeing Wren finally come out of his shell and Maggie telling her father off towards the end.
Also, I liked seeing more of Dante Pontis.
4.5/5 ❤🐯🐆...... 🐒
The next installment after Unleash the Night is "Dark Side of The Moon", which I have in my bag and am itching to read.Anyway, I thought the love story between Wren and Maggie was touching and sad at times, but always hot and sizzling.
I know, I know, it's a terrible habit and has caused me more than once to have to go back and re-read an entire chapter, but this time I took my time and read every single line.I highly recommend Sherrilyn Kenyon to anyone who loves a juicy, sexy, kick ass, paranormal romance filled with references to the ancient Greek Gods who just happen to be around in the present.
Don't get me wrong - I love the Dark-Hunters, but I really enjoyed Wren's story.
But things change the night Maggie Goudeau, a senator's daughter, comes into the bar with friends.
But, things quickly escalate into a bar fight where Wren's animalistic side comes roaring to life.
Later, as Wren & Maggie begin exploring their mutual attraction, a devious plot threatens to destroy their chance at happiness and they find themselves on the run for their lives.Intense & action-packed but also beautifully romantic & sensual, Betrayed is a tantalizing, sexy read that touched my heart.
