As long as he's not writing racist stories about lazy, wine-swilling Mexicans (see my review of Tortilla Flat), Steinbeck is great. I never read much Steinbeck before this summer, and I'm sorry I've missed him. One of my favorites so far is the story "Flight." There's not a lot of dialogue or action, but the character changes so dramatically. I'm looking forward to teaching this!
I loved this book tremendously, even though I've read several of his classics on their own, this one excerpted the best of the best. It was a treat to experience some short stories I hadn't read, some reflections from late in his life, and the Nobel acceptance speech. A must for any Steinbeck fan.
I think I like his novels better. I liked the short stories Molly Morgan and Humbert.I think The Snake is sort of silly. One carnivore scandalized by another carnivore's fascination with the carnivorousness of a carnivore?
A great travel book, if you don't have a Nook or Kindle. There are a few complete stories and quite a few samples of different books by this great author. When I'm in the mood to read something short and entertaining, I reach for this one.
If you like STeinbeck, you'll appreciate this diverse sampling of his works. If you don't like STeinbeck, you'll appreciate even more so the brief, more poignant writing moments that erupt from his work.
Extracts from many Steinbecks. Made me want to read the full versions; a bit frustrating.

I like reading a little of a lot of stuff. So if you want a quick intro to Steinbeck read this.
