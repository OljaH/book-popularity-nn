Archer's Voice was one of the most heartwarming and uniquely beautiful stories I have ever read.
Yes, it is a part of the Sign of Love series, but that is a series of standalone novels -- each main story is separate from the others.
Archer's Voice is the story of a woman chained to the memory of one horrifying night and the man whose love is the key to her freedom.
My heart was breaking for them and I desperately wanted to know more.We were told the story mostly from Bree's POV but with a few flashback scenes from Archer's childhood.
5 Archer starsI am in awe of this book.
It hit all my five star plus buttons.
I know it’s early, but I can already tell this is going to be in my top 10 of the year.
I loved it that much!
Archer Hale has spent his life in solitude.
Something traumatic happened to him when he was seven years old and left his voice box so damaged he could no longer speak.
He lived with his uncle, never leaving the property.
His uncle passed away a while ago, and he’s been alone ever since.
He knows it’s not normal
Bree leaves her hometown of Cincinnati Ohio (which just happens to be MY hometown ;)) to head to the small lakeside town of Pelion Maine.
The Archer she’s come to know.
Archer is obviously inexperienced when it comes to women, but he wants Bree, and he thinks she feels the same.
Bree more than wants Archer.
She is falling for him.Bree tries to get Archer to come out more, to join the land of the living.
With the friendship and love Archer and Bree are developing, there is also some drama and suspense going on in the background.

“It suddenly occurred to me that Archer Hale had taught himself an entire language, but hadn't had a single person to talk to.
I will try to write a better review when I catch up.College graduate Bree Prescott flees to a lakeside town and meets a 23-year old recluse who doesn’t speak, Archer Hale.
What is his story?
And what is Bree running from?A feel-good read!
Loved it!
Suspense, angst, reflection and an epic love that will melt your heart.
I liked it, don’t get me wrong but it was nowhere near a five star book for me.
Note to self, don’t read a book on Release Date unless you are absolutely sure that you will love it.Every single one of my friends who has read it gave it 5 stars.
Pressure was too much and it did not work for me…It is a lovely story, the characters are nice, the prose flowed but there was something missing to give it that little push for a four or five star review.It felt more like a YA read than a NA read….

I'm never a fan of musky as a description or even a scent being described as "male." I'm also not a fan of phrasing such as this : the taste of peaches and Bree exploded on my tongue.I make a motion to strike the word core from all romance books from here on out.
Why the story kept me reading : I liked Archer.
I liked the setup of how Bree and Archer got to know each other.
I don't even know what that's about.I listen to your breathing and the way you dig your fingers into my hips right before you're about to come.
I had put off reading this book for awhile because I had heard all the hype and was worried that I'd be disappointed.
Now, I'm kicking myself for waiting so long!
'Archer's Voice' lived up to the hype and surpassed my expectations.
I loved this story!It didn't take me hardly any time to fall in love with Archer.
I loved her kindness and persistence.I don't want to give much away here, because this is a story that deserves to be read.
I loved every minute of it and it is definitely a new favorite of mine.
This is my 5th time of reading this book but still it makes me so happy...
Loving you is an honor and a joy, Archer.” “I know I'm probably the last person you want to see right now, but I thought if I sat on your porch, you wouldn't be scared.
Teach me what you like, he said” “How do you teach a man who has lost everything, not to fear it happening again?” “I didn't know enough to dream you, Bree, but somehow you came true anyway.
And that is going to be the great joy of my life, Bree Prescott.” “I’m in love with you too.
4 1/2 Stars A very sweet and unique love story that's well written and emotional. It's as heartwarming as it is heartbreaking and has the perfect blend of real-life issues, powerful romance and heart-and-soul. I loved it.
A little sappy and predictable, but a sweet, heart-warming story nonetheless.  “Chiron's wound symbolizes the transformative power of suffering-how personal pain, both physical and emotional, can become the source of great moral and spiritual strength.”  Archer's Voice was the story of two wounded healers. Two people who felt lonely, scared and insecure, and found their redemption in each other. Bree's life drastically changed one stormy night, that left her paralyzed with fear and excruciating
“I knew I loved her – fiercely and with every part of my heart, even the broken parts, even the parts that felt unworthy and without value.
Archer's Voice is my first Mia Sheridan book and it won't be the last.
Most of the times I wanted to hug him and comfort him, make him believe that everything would be okay and that this silent, beautiful boy deserved love.
My word for love is Bree.”
Archer's Voice made my heart fly, and despite its flaws, it was a soulful and all-consuming story that left me smiling and hoping.
*****FIVE++++++++++++ ONLY EVER YOU STARS*****{BR with Mel and Dee} Every now and then a book comes along that completely reaffirms why I love reading! Archer's Voice has definitely been added to that growing list of books for me! I love stories that completely satisfy the hopeless romantic in me. It is because of these books that any man I meet will never measure up!! LOL I love a story about people who have been broken somehow, usually by a heartbreaking tragedy, and it's the love of that one
Archer's Voice has definitely been added to that growing list of books for me!
I love stories that completely satisfy the hopeless romantic in me.
This is that story of love that completely touched my heart.
She gets herself a cute lakeside cabin, and soon lands a job as a waitress at the local diner.
But even though she helps to bring him out of his shell, somehow Archer fears his love for Bree will end up suffocating her.
I didn't think my heart could take it, but then Bree and Archer spend this beautiful night together and I'm thinking thank God the angst is over.
4.5 Seeing Archer Stars  Mild Spoilers"How do you teach a man who has lost everything, not to fear it happening again?

Teach me, Bree.
I fell madly in love with Archer.
Loving you is an honor and a joy, Archer.”-Archer and BreeArcher and Bree were absolutely beautiful together.
Be. You-ArcherThe only thing I didn't like in this book was Travis and his bitch mom.
I felt they both got off after all the pain they caused and it pissed me off.
5++++++++++ stars for this beautiful silent man. Archer Hale stole my heart. I finished this book last night and it took me some time to decide on my review.  I loved everything about this book. I loved everything about Archer and Bree. They were just so beautiful and kind. Their love for one another was just so sweet.  Archer lost his voice at a very young age during a terrible tragedy. He never really recovered and he was known around town as the " weirdo". No one really talked to him and he k
I loved everything about this book.
I loved everything about Archer and Bree.
They were just so beautiful and kind.
Their love for one another was just so sweet.
No one really talked to him and he kept his distance from the people in town also.
The people didn't really know what his deal was except that he did not speak to anyone.
Bree moved to the small town to hopefully escape her nightmares of the tragedy that she lived through.
It was hard because Archer didn't feel whole and he didn't think that he deserved Bree.
Give Archer's Hale and Bree a chance to captivate you!Jay Ryan as Archer HaleDear New Adult Authors:Take a look at what Mia Sheridan did here.
She wrote a beautiful, sexy, panty-dropping, tingling-in-private-parts-hot, damaged hero and not a single time he was*abusive*disrespectful*slutshamer*an idiot who ruins the relationship with his stupidity*a cheaterand still the drama, the steaminess (and the sales for Mia sheridan!) were as high if not higher than many other books of the genre that promote negative attitudes toward women (cough tangled cough) or cheating.Archer and Bree's love story is one that will remain with me for years to come.
I love you Archer Hale!
Hearing them is certainly different from reading them.
The characters are unique and flawed.
Bree found a treasure hidden away when she and Archer crossed paths.
It was amazing to read/hear as she peeled away his layers.
The innocence and eagerness that Archer exuded translated well in different aspects of the story, from his first movie to his first kiss and more.
My emotions were certainly engaged by the story and in more ways than the romance aspect.
I don't think I remember hating a character more than Travis.
This is a solid story with an enlivening composition.Safety: No rape.
The story drastically turned into a hundred percent erotica or perhaps my copy was just defective because I’m pretty sure somebody printed the wrong half of the book and printed the pages of a manual teaching how to enhance somebody’s sexual life.
Personally, I’d like that wonderful aspect of life to leave me a little room for imagination the way Colleen Hoover for example, would do it.^^Two things good about the book though: The happy ending (Nicholas Sparks lost this round, ha!) and giving me plenty of chances to exercise my facial muscles from too much cringing.^^Gah!
4--My Heart....My Emotions....Just Give Me a Moment--Stars!!I'll just be....yeahArcher, Archer, Archer I just want to give you the biggest freakin' hug.
And I wanted so bad for Archer to find peace and happiness.
It was just a journey getting there.Archer Hale witnessed a horrific tragedy at the age of seven that changed his life.
He lived a life of solitude and lonliness until he meets Bree.Bree Prescott is running.
Archer and Bree become friends.
For the first time Archer believes in having more.
Bree and Archer fall in love.
Watching Archer navigate through life experiences that he knew nothing about.
So good!This is the only book I have read so far in my whole life that it talks so much about love, while it does not sound corny, old-fashioned and cheesy.
But still she does not hesitate to dive in her feelings and embrace love.As a genuinely good person, she does not lead on without reason, she does not lie and she does not play with the feelings of others:
But I wasn't really sure at that point what was going on with me and Archer.
When Bree falls in love, she will dive in enthusiastically.
4 stars!!I honestly wasn’t planning on reading this book just yet but my crazy fingers swiped on it, the book opened, hours flew by, and whaddya know? I’m through with the book. As for my rating, it took me some time to decide as I was spinning between the 3 and 5 star range. I mean, I liked the book. I loved it actually. But I didn’t  LOVE  it. The praise for this book is absolutely warranted though. The deep emotional pull and one of the very best literary heroes is probably enough to give thi
Bree is a very likable heroine who is both lovely and kind, and for someone who is afflicted with terrors and understandable trust issues, she easily makes new friends, gets a new job, catches the eye of the town’s most eligible bachelor, and is the first to coax out the reclusive hero Archer Hale in just days.
As much as I loved everything about Archer, some things in this story bothered me, like Bree just happening to be the only one who could communicate with him with sign language.
★★★★★ 5 Stars! “...the loudest words are the ones we live.”  This story was absolutely BEAUTIFUL.Ever since I first read Stinger and later on Leo and Leo's Chance, Mia Sheridan has become one of my favorite contemporary romance authors. She just has a way of storytelling that completely resonates with me and that makes me fall in love with the characters and their epic love story each and every time. And Archer's voice was no exception. Once again, this was a wonderful story that made laugh and
Her strength and ability to see the best in people made Bree a very likable and easy to relate to heroine and I loved her quirky side and sense of humor.✦ Archer Hale ✦An accident as a child has made Archer Hale lose his voice.
*MAJOR SWOON* It takes a while for him to open himself up to Bree and the friendship she's offering but once he finds out that she truly wants to get to know him and spend time with him, he comes completely out of his shell.
My word for love is Bree.” 
All in all, Archer's Voice was an unputdownable, unforgettable story about love, hope, loss, friendship and healing that will from now on reside on my all-time-favorites-shelf.
Archer's Voice is a beautiful, sweet, tender and unique love story of two people overcoming painful pasts while holding on to their humanity and hope.   In Archer and Bree, the author has created two flawed characters, made them feel human and relatable - not only did I sympathise with the two but I wanted so much for them to attain their aspirations and happiness.  The author's inspiring prose really moved me.....  Loved the build-up of their relationship from friends to more.Great epilogue. Be

4.5 EMOTIONALLY HEARD STARSSo I finally read a book by Mia Sheridan, and I must say  I LOVED IT!This book is about two emotional scared individuals who come together to form a couple.They both have to overcome their demons that haunt their dreams nightly.
CAUSE THAT MAN WAS FINE.However, the things he signs to Bree at the beginning are very disturbing:"..Sometimes I feel like everything is over my head.
Why?" Again, Bree you are such a Saint.Overall, I loved this ugly cry inducing book that made me feel like a was a part of their story.
5 **I lost my heart to you.** STARS  “Someday … when we're old and gray, I'm going to look at you lying in bed beside me, just like this, and I'm going to look into your eyes and know that it's only ever been you. And that is going to be the great joy of my life.”  Thank you to my blogging partner in crime Sandy. She has been bugging me for ages to discover Mia Sheridan's books and Archer's Voice in particular. And what a success it has been. Hit me right in the feels. Beautifully written, wonde
She has been bugging me for ages to discover Mia Sheridan's books and Archer's Voice in particular.
Archer has lead a very isolated life, hiding himself from the world and Bree functions as a catalyst to pull him out of his shell, giving him hope.
In return Archer is the safety and peace Bree so desperately needs.
My word for love is Bree.”
All the surrounding characters are very well written and Bree is his perfect counterpart, but Archer absolutely makes this book what it is.
A feel good read, a carefully constructed and slowly paced romance with a lot of heart, emotion and the occasional heartbreak.
The story grabbed my attention from the very first words.Bree has moved to a little town in Maine.
She’s looking for a new start and finds herself a little cabin to move into.
After finding a job at a diner and meeting some new people in town, she runs into a man named Archer.
Only it will be a hundred times worse because I’ll know what I’m missing.
Don’t let me destroy this.” —ArcherI just loved Bree and Archer’s characters.
Bree is so kind-hearted and she’s willing to go the extra mile to break through to Archer and help him heal.
3.5 StarsI am definitely in the minority on this, but I just didn't love  this one as much as most of my friends seemed to. Don't get me wrong, it had a lot of really sweet elements and themes weaved throughout the story (e.g. the whole dandelion thing), and Archer and Bree were really cute (if somewhat flat?) characters, but it was just missing something for me. Probably just me though.
With the way the story begins I was immediately pulled in and wanted to know more.
We see that Archer is an average seven year old, but is afraid of his father after seeing his behavior with his mom.The story then switches to present time and we meet Bree.
Not long after arriving Bree meets a now grownup Archer.
Archer and Bree are average people with normal insecurities, and I love how together they helped each other.
From the outside Bree looks perfect, but on the inside she is living with guilt and fear from witnessing her father’s murder.
“Sometimes an understanding silence was better than a bunch of meaningless words.”  Archer's Voice made me fall in love over again. This book is not perfect, yet it epitomizes how long people can live their lives without love and dreams. Every breath I took while reading this book was worth the feeling Archer gave me. I liked him. Even cried for him. I don't know if I haven't read this book, how can my life be completed like this. I am so happy to have Archer and Bree in it, they're two people
Every breath I took while reading this book was worth the feeling Archer gave me.
I don't know if I haven't read this book, how can my life be completed like this.
I loved to see when they first met, the chemistry was there, and I could touch it by my heart.Archer is a character who has depth, he doesn't try to conceal his pain when he's around Bree.
There're many scenes that broke my heart, too, but they showed how mad a man can be when he is holding on and never wants to let it go.
And, Bree, in case you're wondering, I don't ever want it back.” You will fall in love with Archer and Bree.
There is no alpha male, just a sweet, sweet silent man who you will immediately fall in love with.
I'm so happy that Archer had his happy ever after , I can't think of any other character who deserve it more.A book of hope, a book of survival, a book of acceptance, and a book of love so strong- words were not needed.
Love spoke louder through every look, every touch, and every movement.
Don't know what I was thinking because the H/h weren't teenagers, they were in their early 20s so it didn't bother me the way I thought it would.Just loved the whole originality of the plot ((view spoiler)[the mute, virgin hero (hide spoiler)]), the RS part of it, and of course loved the heroine and adored the hero, Archer.
A minor quibble for me was the ending...didn't totally buy it (view spoiler)[how quickly Archer was able to take over the town without much resistence.
(hide spoiler)] But no matter, no way did it ruin it for me.One of the best books I've read this year.
"Maybe there was no right or wrong, no black or white, only a thousand shades of grey when it came to pain and what we each held ourselves responsible for."  A unique, extraordinary, and captivating story of a broken man's journey towards healing, love, and transformation.I totally love this book and there are a lot of reasons why I adore it. The story of Archer Hale and  Bree Prescott really made such a great impact to me. I wanted to write a brief background of the story but I decided not to,
A unique, extraordinary, and captivating story of a broken man's journey towards healing, love, and transformation.I totally love this book and there are a lot of reasons why I adore it.
The story of Archer Hale and  Bree Prescott really made such a great impact to me.
Archer Hale is such an amazing character.
I love the way she totally accepted Archer for whatever he was.
No wonder why it was nominated for Goodreads' Best Romance of 2014, absolutely without a doubt, it's one of the best New Adult romance books ever written!Rating: 5 Stars
