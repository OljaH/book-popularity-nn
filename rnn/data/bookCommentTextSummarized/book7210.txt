After the last volume which was a little disappointing I am happy to find that this one did not have those mistakes. Overall these 4 books about Dirty Fred and the others were a great journey. Unique and lovable characters and interesting stories with great plot twists. Also despite its shortcomings I would still recommend to read the third book in the series as well since it still had some nice moments.
