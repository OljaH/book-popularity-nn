Of course, it came from someone involved with Arrested Development -- should I expect any less?The first three-fourths of this book are told in the form of email correspondence, magazine articles, even doctors' bills purportedly strung together by fifteen-year-old Bee in an attempt to tell her mother Bernadette's story.
She wants to host a bruncheon (I don't know if that's a word, but I'm coining it now) to woo legitimately upper-crust parents to the charter school and Bernadette's blackberry bushes are interfering.
She hates Seattle, the parents at Bee's school, her husband's company, everything around her...except Bee. She loves Bee desperately and wants to do anything she can for her daughter.
(I know a book is genuinely good if I feel the need to share it.) I did enjoy it, and that's saying something, given that it's outside my regular reading habits and I don't think I'm the target audience for the book.
Whatever that means.If you're the sort of person who only reads fantasy (as I know some of my readers are) be aware this doesn't have any of that in there.
There's feelings and shit in this book, and a girl looking for her mother.
Or what's typically considered "Chick Lit" (Though I hate that term.) odds are you'll like this more than four stars worth.
Narration between the documents is provided in brief snippets by Bernadette's precocious daughter Bee. Alas, there are many problems, and the book never lives up to its promise.
Also, the title and jacket copy of this book seem to promise that it's about the mysterious disappearance of, and search for, Bernadette.
The problem is that Bernadette never really disappears.
But the book suffers the most when the narration switches to Bee full time after the disappearance.
It felt like Semple was trying to write a book that was zany, unique, and inventive, but also perfectly conventional, with all the benefits of both storytelling styles.
The book is a meta-compilation supposedly put together by Bee of emails, articles, and other assorted correspondences that tell the story of Bernadette: what made her who she is, and what led up to her disappearance.
Maria Semple used to work on Arrested Development, if that gives you some idea of what I mean by 'wacky.'Now, just to warn you, I'm writing this all high off the ending (which was just fucking lovely), so I might be a bit biased, and you might end up reading it and being like, Ashley, what the fuck?
For the first time ever, I'm going with the Goodreads-appointed rating system.
This book was simply "OK", therefore I am giving it 2 stars.
I was also disappointed that what I had originally thought was the whole point of the book (Bernadette disappearing right before a trip to Antarctica) didn't even happen until way later in the story.
I found the lead-up to Bernadette's disappearance to be quite dull, and I only became vaguely interested when it finally happened.I don't have very strong emotions towards this book, which leads me to believe it just wasn't for me.
To her Microsoft-guru husband, she's a fearlessly opinionated partner; to fellow private-school mothers in Seattle, she's a disgrace; to design mavens, she's a revolutionary architect, and to 15-year-old Bee, she is a best friend and, simply, Mom.Then Bernadette disappears.
But Bernadette's intensifying allergy to Seattle--and people in general--has made her so agoraphobic that a virtual assistant in India now runs her most basic errands.
Note to self: When writers whose work you dislike intensely blurb a book, ignore the hype and avoid it.

Simply put: READ THIS, or you WILL have a supremely lame life.
This I solemnly swear...Yup, this is a total classic--a brilliant novel that the critics have hailed as impossibly LOL fuhu-nny.
But I simply must add on to this (and this is why this has been the best novel I've read since "The Art of Fielding"): truth is, it will make you cry.
Bawl-like-a-baby cry...
over the disappearance of this unique individual.
"Where'd You Go, Bernadette" is what astute book worms crave.
I will never stop recommending Bernadette!
It is one of the best novels of the 21 st century.
Laugh out loud comedy about a family in crisis. Bernadette is a quirky,opinionated, likable character. Bernadette disappears one day after her 15 year old daughter aces her report card and wants to claim her promised award: a family trip to Antarctica. The only problem is that Bernadette is agoraphobic and uses her assistant in India to run most of her errands. My best advice: READ THIS BOOK! It's hilarious, funny and a welcome relief to books that seem to be similar to other books. This book is original, well thought out and laugh out loud funny.
There is a new genre of contemporary fiction in which believability is thrown out the window in favor of wacky plot machinations, but which is not satire because the emotions of the characters are too real.
(See also, "This Is Where I Leave You.")When her daughter was born with a heart condition which gave her skin a blueish hue, Bernadette Fox named her daughter, Balakrishna Branch, because the Indian God, Krishna, is blue and the name means "child Krishna." Wacky, huh?!!
Oh, and did I mention that she is a genius - MacArthur grant and all?Bernadette's husband is also wacky!!
There is so much wackiness that it becomes exhausting.The problem is that Bernadette's daughter, Bee, is a totally believable character.
People don't go to Antarctica, they're called to Antarctica...I can't quite make my mind up about this funny/weird/sad book all in one.
The beginning of the book made me laugh at almost every page, mainly because of the weird 'mum' and her 'matchless' statements and behavior; it also struck me this story is actually a bit sad.
Still, say close to four stars for this unparalleled witty, loving and funny story with a teary edge to it.
About a special strong-minded and witty girl named Bee, her out of bounds mum and the love for each other.
There are email exchanges between Bernadette and an online personal assistant, notes from Bee’s school, several catty moms opining about Bee’s parents, and various other documents of a plot-spoiling nature.
It was also nice that we weren’t just told that Bernadette, Elgie and Bee were smart, we got to see the evidence of it as well.
Special mother-daughter bonds were handled deftly.I have a friend or two out there (oddly enough, near broad-minded Boston (view spoiler)[Note that I did not say Milford since that would have been specific enough to identify exactly who I meant (hide spoiler)]) who might be tempted to judge a book by its cover, and in this particular case assume “chick lit.” While it does have a female perspective, I personally wouldn’t defile it with such a label.
I know I usually use the word "engrossing" in a positive way, to convey that a book was compelling and interesting, fascinating and exciting.
But apparently the author didn't notice(?) that Bee is way judgmental too.But that's really only part of the misogyny/sexism written into this book (and written into our culture).
It lost all the other stars because I kind of hated its tone (every person in it uses the same voice, by the way), its content, its underlying assumptions, its message, I could go on...but I've wated enough time on it already.
The blurb makes it seem like it’s a ‘‘laugh-out-loud-worthy’’ mystery novel about a mother who disappears and a daughter who moves mountains to find her mom.Sure, that does happen… in the last 3/4 of the book.
Still, it’s a page-turner in the sense that all those literally props—letters, interviews, e-mails—are easy to read and relatively humorous.I didn’t think this was a ‘‘laugh-out-loud’’ type of book, but it does contain a good couple of clever dialogs and original scenes.The characters are not ones I cared too much for.
Favorites: "Suddenly, Audrey Griffin started running toward the car all stiff and out of rhythm.
"Perhaps because we both went to prep school and Ivy League universities ourselves, we did not fetishize them like other Seattle parents." -43.
"Wooowww," Audrey Griffin said, spreading the word up and down like a roller coaster.
The book becomes less plausible, more fantastic as it goes, rising in a crescendo of unbelievability -- but it's all benevolent and fun, and you barely notice it and it's easy to go along with it.
But really wonderful in a, "I wish that would actually happen!
A great book.
I was overwhelmed by what transpires in the book.
Relentlessly (for most of the book).
The story is so domineering that we are caught unawares when the book ends.Benadette Fox and her family paint a ludicrous picture of her household.
I do think that Maria Semple was inspired by various authors, and all of these authors are still alive.
That's my impression at least.What a story!
I don't think this is a strictly chick lit book.
I had to knock out one star due to the chaotic and unsatisfying last act, but overall this is a book that will stay with me for a long time.
1.5 "whatever~~" stars !!.Maria Semple is a very clever, clear and concise writer which are all real
THIS IS MY ILLUMINAE.By which I mean, “This is Illuminae if I liked Illuminae, and also instead of being set in space it was set in the Pacific Northwest, and also instead of descriptions of camera footage and server readings it was emails and flyers and whatnot, and also it was the present day, and also instead of teeming with unnecessary romance and the same plotlines over and over it was actually funny and entertaining.”Basically the only thing it has in common with Illuminae is the unique/found-document style formatting.So again, I say: MY ILLUMINAE!!!I read this book a few years ago, when I was young(er) and stupid(er), and I thought it was meh.
Maybe finishing it after getting enough sleep had something to do with the disappearance of giddy happiness and the emergence of the ambivalent noncommittal shrug at what I just read.It starts as a clever satire featuring the cream of the crop of Seattle, Washington - a place where Microsoft has its headquarters and where the people do not live up to the standards of haughty and cultured LA transplants.
And it's such an easy and fun page-turning read - perfectly suited to a slow sleep-deprived call shift at work.
The character who is truly infuriating is Soo-Lin, but I will say no more in case you want to read the book.
Many readers seem to hate on Bernadette's husband Elgie (and with good reason), but if you're the forgiving type like I am, you'll feel compassion toward his character.
The only issue with this book is that it seems to end abruptly.
However, the mark of a great book is that it leaves you wanting more no matter how it ends, so this feeling is entirely forgivable.
If you're looking for a fun, spunky read, then this book will be right up your alley.
This is my favorite book that I have read in a long while.
It's just, I feel like this might be one of the best books I've ever read about art and women and motherhood and technology and life and Seattle.
I mean, Bernadette is infuriating.
Reading her sections of this book, you want to slap her just as much as you want her to like you (!).
And Elgie, for a while I was worried about him ever being a character for real, but then he just -- he just EXPLODES at the end of the book, just, perfectly sketched in.
Semple’s spoofs are fun-house mirror reflections of layers of upper-middle class American society: oversharing to strangers via the save-face format of e-mail and social media (the exchanges between Bernadette and her $.75/hour personal assistant Manjula, who is based in India, are screamingly funny); the obsession with work and achievement (woe to Microsoft, whose culture is skewered and roasted like a vegan hotdog on a gas grill); dogmatic liberalism –Bee splutters her outrage towards her private school: “Their class was studying China, and the debate was going to be pro and con Chinese occupation of Tibet.
What a fun read to begin the new year! I resisted reading this for quite some time, as I generally like a deeper read. Yet, right from the beginning the peculiarities of Seattle and Microsoft were sprinkled in through the story. Hmm, I have a Goodreads friend who lived there and worked at Microsoft. Now I know why she's the crazy nut she is (you know who you are.) I loved how the story was often told through emails between the characters, interspersed with the main character, a teenage girl named Bee. This was just a crazy fun read!
I wanted the last book I read in 2015 to be special, and Where’d You Go, Bernadette fit the bill, despite the obvious “chicklit” cover.
(Most of my GR friends who know Seattle say Semple’s observations about the city, from its architecture to its five-way intersections, are dead-on.)It’s not until midway through the book that you grasp how Semple – a former writer for clever sitcoms like Arrested Development and Mad About You – has constructed the book.
And that’s where the cover – not to mention the title – begins to makes sense.
Where'd you go Bernardette, by Maria Semple is simple a riot of abook. I laughed so uncontrollably in the plane that some passengerscomplained. A Seattle teenage girl tells the story of how and why hereccentric mother, who has alienated everybody around her, includingher Microsoft geek of a husband, ends up lost in Antarctica. Not tomiss if you need to get over a bout of depression.
She’s suffered a couple of serious set-backs in her own career as a cutting-edge architect and has had to worry about the critical health issues of her daughter Bee. A crazy-quilt cast of characters unrolls from e-mails, articles, bulletins, receipts, and other types of correspondence and documents that form this epistolary novel: a consultant hired by Bee’s school to help it compete for “Mercedes parents,” enemy neighbors Bernadette calls “gnats,” husband Elgie’s “admin” at work who dispenses a lot of pop psychology learned at her “Victims Against Victimhood” group, Bernadette’s India-based virtual personal assistant, and a host of others .
I think the main issue here is that I thought this book would be totally different, but regardless, I can't wrap my head around this one.
People say it's humorous, but to me, it read like a satire and I was feeling left out by the joke.
The "humorous" situations were over the top and insanely dramatic, which felt very fake to me.
I can't put my finger on where this went wrong but it was boring and strange and in the end, I still don't know if Bernadette is supposed to be psychotic or a genius.
This book just went way over my head.
What an absolutely original, inventive and humorous novel, I can't remember the last time I read a novel that caused me to laugh out loud. Bernadette is a definite original, someone I wish I knew in real life. Yet, there are poignant moments, serious self realizations come to the surface and her daughter Bee is an absolute delight as well. Who knew you could form complete characters from e-mails, letters etc. yet in this book Semple does it and does it well. Definitely recommend.
But this is a really brilliant tactical style, because it allows not just, like, one unreliable narrator, but instead a dozen semi-reliable narrators, each of whom is speaking from his or her own legitimate point of view, one which isn't exactly wrong, but is often not the whole story.
Says Maria Semple herself, in that weird backmatter stuff that's like a guide for reading groups or whatever: "Epistolary novels, when done right, can be an explosion of fun." And it is!
You just know Maria had such a marvelous time putting it all together.
And even more impressive: I didn't know a thing about the style gimmick going in.
The Hype is Right: Where’d You Go, Bernadette by Maria Semple (Book Spoilery Review) “Of the million reasons I don’t want to go to Antarctica, the main one is that it will require me to leave the house.” Flipping through five pages of praise to get to the actual storyline of  Where'd You Go, Bernadette was a telling sign. Plus: the book is set in the month of November when it starts, which is the current month, and reading something that's set in the same period of time is only a bonus that wor
The whole first half of this book uses anything and everything, except standard chapters, to tell the story of the Branch family (consisting of 15-year-old Bee and her parents Bernadette Fox and Elgie) and the people in their orbit.
The last one I had the most joy uncovering.“I was going through an Abbey Road phase because I had just read a book about the last days of the Beatles, and I spent most of breakfast telling Mom about it.”I wanted more moment like this that show how supportive and close Bee and Bernadette are...
A fun to read novel, hard to put down, but not totally satisfying.
The locations - Seattle and Antarctica - seem to be as important as the characters.Bernadette is a stay at home mother who is remarkably anti social.
But throw in architectural drama, blackberries, school gate politics, workplace restructuring and poncey boarding schools and you have a novel with drama and flair.
All the characters seem to have flaws and strengths in equal numbers.Nice touches - Antarctica is a special place, and long may it remain so.
Nice to have a New Zealand character - we feel so insignificant in our tiny nation at the end of the earth!
