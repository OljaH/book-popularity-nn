After an illness following a plane crash in Sumatra, Edward Bond is whisked away to The Dark World, a twin of Earth where mutants rule.
Bond has fragments of memories that aren't his own and bluffs his way through situations as long as he can.Ganelon was an interesting protagonist, an anti-hero motivated by his own ends rather than heroism.
Since Kuttner was involved with the Cthulhu mythos crowd, it's not hard to imagine that that was intentional.The Dark World wasn't developed as much as I would have liked.
The Dark World is a quick read and should entertain any fan of pulp fantasy and Roger Zelazny fans.
Osnovno što me navelo ka ovoj knjizi iz 1946. je Zelaznyjeva napomena kako mu je bila izravno nadahnuće za Amber serijal.Što je našao u njoj ostala mi je nepoznanica, meni izgleda kao da je ovime nadahnut za Gospodara svjetlosti, a ne za Amber.U principu fantasy žanr se dobro drži tijekom desetljeća nakon što je napisan, ako je dobro napisan.Ovo mi jednostavno svojim stilom ne odgovara, previše osjetim Gospodara u njoj i to mi ne odgovara pa zato samo dvojčica.Inače je prilično kratko pa se može pročitati.
And that summer, in "Startling Stories" again, the team came out with "The Dark World," a work that is pretty much a "hard" fantasy with some slight scientific leavening.In this one, the American flier Edward Bond is whisked from the Pacific theatre during WW2 and transported to the eponymous Dark World, an alternate Earth that has diverged from its parent in space as well as time.
Though called the Coven, Ganelon's fellows number only four, and include Medea, a beautiful vampire who feeds on life energies; Matholch, a lycanthrope; Edeyrn, a cowled, childlike personage whose power the authors choose not to reveal until the novel's end; and Ghast Rhymi, an ancient magus whose origin really did surprise this reader.
An average fantasy book today runs probably around 500 pages.
But back in the pulp era of fantasy the average book was the length of what we would probably consider a novella.
Some could pack in more in 100 pages than some authors today can in 500.Back then when I was reading these for the first time, this was one of my favorites.
At the time it seemed new, and it was for me, I hadn't read anything like it.
And so since then I have read better authors and books that are very similar.
Los Sanderson, Abercrombie y Martins han perfeccionado la clásica para volverla real y más actual.Aquí lo que vais a leer es una fantasía barata, puramente pulp.
Que te guste o no dependerá de lo refinado y quisquilloso que estés en ese momento.Lo bueno de todos estos relatos tan sumamente clásicos, difíciles de encontrar y facilones es que en un futuro costaran mucho dinero, y serán sumamente buenos.
Pues esto de la literatura fantástica se va desviando poco a poco hasta dejar de serlo, y solo habrá realidad medieval con un toque mágico muy sutil que dejara con la duda de si es magia o no.
His evil cohorts swapped him back.Kuttner gives us a hero who starts as a good guy, becomes the bad guy, and really only helps the good guys win because he's pissed off at the other bad guys.
It's an interesting trick that kept me reading in spite of some stylistic awkwardness and dated prose.That said, Roger Zelazny cites Kuttner as an influence, and fans of his Amber books should read this just to enjoy the frisson of recognition as you realize how direct that influence is.
I have no doubt the Ganelon character in the Amber books is a direct recognition of the debt Zelazny owes Kuttner.
Kao prvo, kako u malo riječi reći puno.
Zbunjeni protagonist budi se u Svijetu tame i otkriva da ima svog dvojnika Edwarda na Zemlji, pilota koji se srušio iznad sumatranske prašume.
Njihova su sjećanja ispremiješana zbog čini čarobnice Freynis koja je htjela svojem šumskom narodu dati šansu protiv Covena i njihovog vođe Ganelona (koji je Edwardov parnjak u Svijetu tame).
Također, roman ima i zanimljivu mitološku komponentu - sva bića koja na Zemlji spadaju u bapske priče koje se pričaju uz vatru, priče o vukodlacima, vampirima, gorgonama, u Svijetu tame su ustvari genetske mutacije koje same sadrže ključ za svoje uništenje.
On the surface, this is some classic Sword & Sorcery, but it's actually secret Science Fiction, and I love it.
Kuttner is an often forgotten figure in genre fiction, but he's an important one (as is his wife, C.L. Moore, with whom he worked frequently, and in fact is suspected by some to have helped him on this one).
Though there are times when it feels very pulp, there are others where you'll find it hart to believe the book was originally published in 1946.
The book is bold and fun, exciting and emotional, and powerfully weird.
If you're a fan of Fantasy, Science Fiction, Sword & Sorcery, or just a good story told well, get yourself a copy.
I thought I'd go back and read a book from the Golden Age of SF. I picked Henry Kuttner's The Dark World from 1946. Not one of Kuttner's best as it turns out. Luckily it was short, so I slogged through it, but he wrote much better. More fantasy in style although based on a science fiction premise. Only for completists.
Part of this explanation does bend the setting from a fantasy to something more explicitly alien, and some of it casts the otherworldly Llyr as a weirdly posthuman horror.The first person narration is troublesome.
On one hand, Ganelon / Edward Bond deals with memory loss (with regard to the allegiances and goals of the beings around him), so limiting the story to only his perspective makes sense: the reader rediscovers Ganelon's past and his position in the Coven with him.
But two sets of controlling memories contend for control within him, so Bond may become Ganelon in the next paragraph or vice versa, with a slightly different feel to his narration.
Most of the big events have already happened and only the last battle remains, where an unexpected twist happens.
Basically, we gradually learn everything through summaries during flashbacks.
Unfortunately, the book is too short to flesh out any of its ideas, so none the characters has something memorable about him/her, and the plot is almost entirely tell / don’t show.
It could have easily been ten times longer if the author bothered to spend more time on every event and character.
Because of that, it reads fast and interesting but leaves you wanting to read the actual thing than its summary.
In this story, Kuttner tries to combine several fantasy themes into a science-fantasy whole - werewolves and vampires, Greek myths, and Lovecraftian themes. It is a moderately successful story, though at times it feels rushed (probably because of its origin in the science-fantasy pulps).
Very good fantasy/SiFi story. Kuttner is a lost master today. The scope of his work is incredible, and his influence on fantasy and SiFi writings is largely unknown. If you are looking for a new writer to try, you won't be disappointed with any of his works. Very recommended

Excelent Story 💕💕💕
Kuttner is one of those classic pulp authors that I never got around to read even though his wife C.
L. Moore is one of my favorite writers of dark fantasy and planetary romance.The Dark World is interesting in a number of ways.
All the magic that is happening gets explained with the science of the day.
He is a tyrant out of a fantasy world who gets banished to our universe and has his memories wiped.
Then he goes back to his world but has trouble remembering who he is and where his loyalties lie, and ends up leading a revolt against his fellow tyrants.
Роман – тъмно бижу, заровено някъде назад в годините, в неясните периоди на книгоиздаването отпреди двадесетина години, открит и преведен по неведоми пътища от хора с явен вкус към различното и много доброто, открили абсурдно изящно съкровище от безкрайно непознат автор.
Катнър пише блестящо, свързвайки елементи от класическо сюрреалистично фентъзи с научна фантастика, от типа човек със сравнително съвременни познания относно технологии и биологични закони се сблъсква с противоречивите правила на необяснен фентъзиен свят, изпълнен с прадедите на вампири, върколаци и горгони, плюс тайнствената тъмна божествена сила, трептяща зад границите на възможното и естествено хранеща се с много, много кръв.
Ας πούμε όμως ότι έχουμε να κάνουμε με δυο παράλληλους κόσμους, την Γη και τον Σκοτεινό Κόσμο, με κάποιες πύλες να ενώνουν τους κόσμους αυτούς.
Στον Σκοτεινό Κόσμο κυριαρχεί η Σύναξη, όπου μέλη της είναι μια κόκκινη μάγισσα, η Μήδεια, ένα παράξενο πλάσμα με μέγεθος μικρού παιδιού ή νάνου, η Εντέυρν, ένας άνθρωπος που μετατρέπεται σε λυκάνθρωπο, ο Μάθολχ, ένας γέρος που στην Γη θα τον συναντούσαμε σαν Μέρλιν αλλά στον Σκοτεινό Κόσμο είναι γνωστός ως Γκαστ Ράυμι, και ένα άλλο περίεργο ον, που υποτίθεται ότι είναι και Θεός, ο Λυρ.
Και στην μέση έχουμε τον Έντουαρντ Μποντ, όπως είναι γνωστός στην Γη, αλλά στον Σκοτεινό Κόσμο λέγεται Γκάνελον.
Στην Γη έχουμε τον Μποντ και στον Σκοτεινό Κόσμο τον Γκάνελον.
The Dark World by Henry Kuttner is in Paizo's Planet Stories line, and is written by one of the masters of the pulp era.
Some of the concepts might seem familiar, or even cliche, such as the premise of a man from modern Earth being transported into a fantasy world, but when you consider that this was first published in 1946, you realize that it certainly wasn't a cliche then, and in fact inspired many of the stories that used these concepts later.One of the joys of The Dark World is that each time you think you have a grasp on what's going on, Kuttner throws another curve ball that makes you re-evaluate everything that's happened before.
However, I never quite felt grounded in the story.
I should note that I read this in kindle format and I did notice a few typos in that format compared to the printed book, which I also have.
Overall, the book had some lovely prose, illustrated lots of imagination, and created some appealing and interesting characters, but the story itself was not as good as I would have liked.
If you're a fan of Sword & Planet fiction, then you'll probably enjoy the book but not be blown away by it.
It is a short book and a quick read.
So this is a classic SF book by a well-respected SF writer.
Rumor has it that it was an inspiration for Zelazny's Amber.
Perhaps, I can see it somewhat.
The protagonist is so thoroughly evil that I had a hard time getting through the book, as short as it was.
I didn't want to see him win the day.
While I still don't very much like the book, it comes too close to glorifying bad things, it did not completely fall through.
Even if, like with me, the book does not completely captivate you, it's short.
Henry Kuttner's "The Dark World" was listed as an inspiration for Zelazny's "Amber" series, and I can see why. Funny enough, I found it more instantly engaging and exciting than Amber, heretical as that probably sounds. It's very pulp-adventure in the classic vein (everyman travels to an alternate dimension where he's a powerful leader), but with some great twists. My only real complaint is the typical 1940s sexism in the tale, but so it goes. Well, okay, I have two complaints -- I want a sequel!
Marion Zimmer Bradley reread this book almost monthly, and who are we to disagree with that paragon of taste?But I really liked this book, either way. It has dimension shifts, pagan deities, magic soul-sucking swords, the fight for freedom(tm) and various other ingredients that might have influenced, say, the Elric stories in some ways. Though for full disclosure I should say that I read this in the magazine version, rather than in the later novel form, so I got pretty pictures into the bargain.
The Dark World by Henry Kuttner is a classic of Fantasy. I have a soft spot for pre-Lord of the Rings fantasy, and The Dark World is one of the better ones. Common to most fantasy books of the time, our hero is plucked out of our world and into the Dark World. From here Kuttner weaves an interesting tale with a notable psychological component. The novel is a major milestone in the transition to modern fantasy.
Hyvin Lovecraft-henkinen scifipulp-tarina, ja vaikka ikää onkin jo seitsemisenkymmentä vuotta, toimii tarina edelleen, toki tietyin varauksin. Kieli ja rytmitys ovat aikakaudelle ominaiset, mutta Kuttner kirjoittaa hienosti tunnelmoiden ja aikaa kestäen.Suosittelut kaikille jotka haluavat lukea Weird Tales-henkisiä tarinoita, tutustua spekulatiivisen tarinankerronnan historiaan tai Lovecraft-faneille.
Dieser klassische (Kurz-)roman wurde 1977 in der Terra Fantasy-Reihe veröffentlicht. Es ist die Geschichte eines Mannes, der auf eine Parallelwelt entführt wird, in der "Magie" vorherrscht. Eigentlich eine vielversprechende Prämisse, aber für meinen Geschmack etwas blutleer ausgeführt. Es sollte dringend jemand den Plot stehlen und sehen, was man damit machen kann.
A 1946 story I would have enjoyed immensely if I had read it as a teen. Here,Kuttner, one of the great pulp writers, is imitating A. Merrit. Ordinary Earthman enters a world of magic and sorcery...a very short story which made a fast read.
This books feel so borried,its fantasy,and the history is very interesting,but the progress of the lecture is very slow and with non-sense.This was acctually a really bad book,I really cant recomend it.

Planet Stories edition of one of the best, and earliest fantasy novels. Kuttner was one of the seminal figures in science fiction/fantasy's early years. This novel, first published in 1946 is, literally, the blueprint for hundreds of fantasy tales that have appeared since then.
I don't normally read fantasy but I really enjoyed this book.I like the way he reasons, logic/ science versus magic. The book is well written and easy to read, couldn't put it down, am definitely going to look for more of his work.
