While the book was written in 1945, its analysis of race, class, and the exercise of power through urban politics resonates nigh perfectly today.The authors were such astute observers of their time that even with 70 years of hindsight we have little to add to what they had to say.
Their politics were rooted in a deep intersectional analysis of labor, capital, and the dynamic coalitions that cut across class and identity to mold the city.
They surveyed and interviewed hundreds of people to write this book.
They carried out deep ethnographic work with Bronzeville communities and share the insights, attitudes, and language of real people who populate the world that they describe.
A Mega-classic of urban sociology, in this book Drake and Cayton (from the 2nd Chicago School?) explore a large array of issues facing African Americans during the 1930s and early 40s. My professor gave me a deep distrust of the connections they draw between class and religious experience, but I would still consider it a must-read for American historians as well as contemporary sociologists interested in city life.
