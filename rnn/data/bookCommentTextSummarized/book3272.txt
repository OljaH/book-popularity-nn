I read this work over a period of several months. If you love books, collect them, hold them, smell them, etc... you will love this work. Jackson wrote it in the style of Burton's Anatomy of Meloncholy, and it was HUGELY entertaining. It also made me realize that my love of books directly competes with my love for Christ...not good.
The result, at least for my academic use, is that Jackson has composed what amounts to a review essay of basically every thought a person might have had regarding books and reading through the end of the nineteenth century.
I have to admit I very much enjoyed some sections of the book -- particularly his insights on books as weapons (literally their use to hit people over the head) as well as the history of reading and the toilet (which didn't go to graphic lengths, but was still suggestive of a potentially interesting field of study).
Since the kinds of books (bound in moroccan, tooled in gold, some with the scribblings of famous authors in the margins, others with names like Elzevir and Manutius on the title page) that most excite Jackson's bibliophiles have all but disappeared from the open market, the kind of mania that drives the collector to the bookstalls and the back corner of dusty shops is almost never satisfied with the object of its mad desire.
Unless it is inherited or stolen (the latter being one of the finer chapters in this book), a library of the kind that Jackson describes here is all but entirely out of reach of the book lover of modest means.
