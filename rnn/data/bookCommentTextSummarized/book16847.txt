She definitely caught my attention, but I never went because it just seemed like the selection was going to be much smaller, and my current library and I have a great thing going right now.
But now I'm involved with two libraries and, boy, is my life going great!
I mean, the fiction section is like three rows, maybe four.
This is the book I left with last week, and this is now my favorite Stephen King book.
Seriously, this is my favorite book I've read from him.
And, thank you Stephen King for a beautiful first date with my local library.
Deserve more than 5 stars
When the recently convicted murderer of two nine- year- old twin girls, the Detterick's, John Coffey, a giant black man, strong as an ox, enters his final home, sadistic prison guard Percy Wetmore, the governor's wife, nephew, he brags about the political connection constantly, enthusiastically shouts "Dead man walking ", the vicious young officer got that idea, reading it in a cheap magazine.
To be honest didn't know Stephen written this book 😑BRILLIANT BOOK, AND Author book as good as movie 5 star ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐Loved loved the movieDon't feel like a large review, I can say if you did not watch the movie you should do so soon!!
The Green Mile is easily one of my favorite movies of all time, and to be completely honest, I had certain doubts about whether the Stephen King novel it was actually adapted from would be capable of causing the same range of emotions in me as the movie did.And oh, how it succeeded with doing that.First off, allow me to mention something about my love-hate-relationship with Stephen King.
Untypically for King's novels, we only meet a few characters, but even those of minor importance to the story are drawn out in such a fascinating way that it becomes difficult to resist caring for all of them.Originally, King published this book in six different installments before releasing the six parts altogether in this novel.
I'm not at all into horror, either in books or in films, and even though my boyfriend has for years tried to get me to read Steven King I've avoided him like the plague.
The delight with the book, as is often the case with books, is that it goes into much more detail in particular with the character of Mr Jingles.This book just illustrates how versatile King is as a writer and that in years to come will probably be considered one of the great literary genius of the Twentieth century.
The book is an example of magical realism.Characters: John Coffey, Paul Edgecombe, Percy Wetmore, Brutus "Brutal" Howell, American Law Enforcement.تاریخ نخستین خوانش: دهم ماه دسامبر سال 2002 میلادیعنوان: مسیر سبز؛ نویسنده: استیون کینگ؛ مترجم: پرویز کریمی ناصری؛ تهران، درسا، 1380، در 525 ص، شابک: 9646104509؛ موضوع: داستانهای نویسندگان امریکایی - سده 20 معنوان: مسیر سبز؛ نویسنده: استیون کینگ؛ مترجم: ماندانا قهرمانلو؛ تهران، افراز، 1386، در 624 ص، شابک: 9789647640527؛ چاپ دوم 1388؛ موضوع: داستانهای نویسندگان امریکایی - سده 20 مخلاصه کتاب: داستان در سال 1932 میلادی روی میدهد، و در مورد زندگی «پل اچکامب» یکی از نگهبانان قدیمی زندان «دیترویت»، در ارتباط با زندانی سیاهپوست و غول پیکری به نام «جان کافی» است.
I'm a huge fan of Stephen King and The Green Mile has got to be one of the best novels he has ever written.
In fact, it's one of the best novels I have ever read in my entire life and a great piece of literature to boot!The novel is simply amazing.
The novel left me thinking about the death penalty and whether it's time it should be abolished worldwide.
I've developed quite a convinced moral stance against the death penalty thanks to reading this novel.
My country doesn't have the death penalty so I never really thought much about it until I read this book.
إن لم تكن قد قرأتها بعدفأقرأها و لا تتأخرثم شاهد الفيلم بطولة توم هانكسقطعة من الفن.
بالرغم من اعدام الفرنسي إلا أن الفأر ظل كحلم ينتظر تحققه على يد الأجيال الجديدة فقد ترك المكان لأنه كان يتوق إلى الحرية بعد أن أنقذه الكلب كالعادة و كما يحدث في الحلقات الكارتونية تماما.أنا لا أنادي بعودة الرق بل أرى أنه يجب علينا أن نكون آدميين و كرماء في جهودنا لحل المشكلة العرقية.
ماذا عساي أن أقول عندما ينتهي بي الأمر واقفا بين يدي الديان و يطلب مني أن أفسر لماذا فعلت ذلك؟ هل أقول أن هذه وظيفتي.و طبقا للواقع فإن الطيبون و العظماء ليس لهم مكان في هذه الحياة و لكن ربما وجدنا لهم مكان على الميل الأزرق ثم في أحضان سباركي العجوزأنا متعب من الألم الذي أسمعه و أشعر به أيها الزعيم.
Siempre había escuchado cosas positivas en torno a esta historia, pero por alguna razón, siempre le había escapado.
Quizá porque suelo ser muy sensible con ciertos tópicos, y por lo poco que había escuchado del libro, sabía que iba a sufrir como condenada pun intended.
Y así fue, me lloré la vida, principalmente luego de la mitad del libro.
Pero no me arrepiento de haberlo leído, por lo contrario, se ha convertido en uno de mis libros favoritos en la vida, y no solo del autor.Bella historia, remueve mil emociones, te mantiene enganchado hasta último momento, y toca tus fibras más sensibles.
Hermoso libro, recomendadísimo.
Después del chasco que me llevé con It, sentía la necesidad de leer algo más de Stephen King, algo que me quitara el mal sabor y me recordara porque admiraba tanto a este señor.
"Es de los mejores libros de King", dijo.
es de los mejores libros de King.
La Milla Verde es uno de esos casos excepcionales en los que King ha decidido dejar de lado el terror para enfocarse en su faceta dramática...
Lo curioso es que, por esta misma razón, tambien es un libro que reconforta.
[Reviewed in 2003.:]Have you ever read a book and been so affected by it that it moved you to tears?
Ugh. I am really bad at reviews.What I can talk about, however, is the emotions that the books caused to arise in me.Do you believe that people can be evil?
Do you believe that a person can be bad, or evil, or however you want to put it, without having any good in them?
How often do you think of why a person does or says something without your own perspective having influence over the thoughts?
This was also the most horrible book I have ever read - but in the best possible way!Not a single sentence was unneccessary; I enjoyed every scene and interaction.The main character was wonderfully developed - he really seemed like a real person and at times it was hard for me to forget that he's just fictional.
But at the same time, I wanted to set the book aside and never pick it up again, because I just didn't want the story to end.I also want to mention that I have never seen the movie before (something I will now do as soon as possible!), so I absolutely had no idea what would happen.
So when my friend recommended it to me I decided to finally read Mr. King and am glad that I read this.Story revolved around the inmates of Cold Mountain Prison who are there for murdering someone waiting for their death on Old Sparky, an Electric chair.
Life was pretty much simple for the workers of prison until Delacroix, John Coffey and William Wharton came to Cold Mountain.
John Coffey was a quite man and Wharton was the troublemaker.
One of King’s best, up there with The Shining and The Stand.King is able to terrify because he is adept at drawing us into a scene, luring the reader in with deft characterization and attention to detail that creates empathy and understanding.In Francis Ford Coppola’s brilliant The Godfather part II, in the scene where a young Vito Corleone (played by Robert De Niro) shoots Fanucci, he wrapped his pistol in a towel and the cloth catches fire after the shots.

The Kindle edition is currently on offer: 0.99p in the UK and $0.99 in the States.This is another book, I read eons' ago, and is up there with my favourite King' novels (The Shining, The Stand, Firestarter, Misery, Cujo, Pet Sematary, Salems Lot, etc).
If Goodreads, existed at that juncture; when I first read it, I would've accoladed it five-stars.
I've still got the softback copy of the book, which is in pristine condition, so not sure whether to buy the Kindle one - or not.
"The Girl with all the Gifts" is currently the same price, as this one, as well - in their respective, territories.
In my humble opinion this is one of Stephen King’s finest pieces of work, along with the Dark Tower books, The Stand and The Shining. The writing is beautiful, the characterization masterful, the story itself downright compelling and the ending absolute perfection. A masterpiece from start to finish!OLIVIER DELAYEAuthor of the SEBASTEN OF ATLANTIS series
When I decided to read The Green Mile, I was absolutely, positively 100% sure it would never measure up to the movie, and was I ever wrong.All of the characters (including Mr. Jingles) are so well drawn that you feel like you are experiencing their lives and feelings right along with them in Cold Mountain State Penitentiary-1932.If I could rate this magical, unforgettable (rip your heart out) story more than 5 Stars, I would not hesitate to do so. What else can I say except......."Time takes it all, whether you want it to or not".
It's where every prisoners had to walk on their last days to meet "old sparkey" King was able to develop the characters so well.John Coffey : (last name not spelled like the drink) the gentle giant who knew people's thoughts and could even heal people.
He's never encountered someone like John Coffey.
It's an excellent read and I highly recommend if you haven't read it.Things I researched as I was reading, because I want to know these things: Interesting !!Did you know during the depression era that what people really called the electric chair ?In 2008 Nebraska Supreme Court determined that execution by electric chair was cruel and unusual punishment.
Bueno, ha pasado un tiempo desde que acabé el libro, y ahora ya puedo dejaros mi opinión:Este es el primer libro de King que leo, debido a que no me suelo leer libros o autores tan aclamados para evitar así una decepción, que es lo que normalmente me llevo.
Es un libro ameno y entretenido, que en ningún momento se hace pesado o repetitivo, en el que todos los personajes tienen su propia personalidad, conoces como piensan y aún así te sorprenden.En cuanto a la historia, en mi opinión es original y completa, en la que se cuenta estrictamente lo necesario, sin excesos ni defectos.
(My father lived off my mother for 25 years, all together, but that's another story for another time.) The Two Dead Girls was the first "book" my mother bought after we got back on our feet.
Fast forward...By 2004 I had been married and moved away from my parents for three years, and had inherited what was left of my mother's book collection.
My tiny apartment wasn't big enough for two people (it was my wife and me; my daughter wouldn't be born until April 2005) AND bookshelves (no joke, that place was SMALL!) so my book collection, which included the serialized version of The Green Mile, was in storage.That September, Hurricane Ivan came ripping ass up the center of Alabama.
It’s a long book, so that’s not so much of an issue (unless I’d given up on it, of course), and once I was comfortable with the cast I was quickly sucked in to the atmosphere of it all.
But I have some misgivings.What I Liked:At this point I'd read only a few of King’s books (11/22/63, Joyland and Mr Mercedes) but enough to know that ensnaring the reader by drawing believable, empathetic characters is a cornerstone of his longevity as a successful writer.
This was certainly in evidence here as I was introduced to, and grew to love, Paul Edgecombe (who narrated the story first person, for the most part) and his colleagues on the Green Mile.
Creo que la combinación del lápiz y la memoria crea alguna clase de magia, y la magia es peligrosa.El Pasillo de la Muerte, también conocido como La Milla Verde o Milagros Inesperados es uno de los mejores libros de Stephen King.
La historia está narrada en primera persona por Paul Edgecomb, quien se encuentra en una residencia geriátrica, en sus últimos años de vida.
Paul nos escribe que en uno de sus años de trabajo ingresó un preso totalmente diferente, y ahí es en donde entra en escena John Coffey.
هذه الرواية اعتقد كلمة ابداع قليلة في حقه, بل انه تحفة ادبية عظيمة من الكاتب ستيفن كينغ كل صفحة هي ا

Obviously these same people have never read his novellas in the collection Different Seasons, or The Dead Zone, or 11/22/63, or Hearts in Atlantis, or this book especially.The story is set in the 1930's and follows Paul Edgecomb, the head warden on the death row ward of Cold Mountain Penitentiary, a man whose job is to try to make the prisoners' last days and trip to "Old Sparky" as peaceful and humane as possible.
If you've never read Stephen King's work because you don't like horror stories, then read this and it will make you a fan.
Το έχω κατατάξει στην κατηγορία "τρόμου",μαζί με τα υπόλοιπα βιβλία του King,αλλά για το μόνο που έχεις να φοβηθείς διαβάζοντας αυτό το βιβλίο είναι για τους δακρυγόνους αδένες σου(καλά,αν έχεις δει ΚΑΙ την ταινία δεν το γλιτώνεις το κλάμα!)Από τα πιο ανθρώπινα που έχει γράψει,με χαρακτήρες που φτάνουν στην καρδιά σου και μια ιστορία που η ανθρωπιά της ξεπερνάει το υπερφυσικό της στοιχείο,νομίζω πως το "Πράσινο Μίλι" είναι όχι απλά ένα από τα σπουδαιότερα βιβλία του Stephen King,αλλά ένα από τα σπουδαιότερα και πιο συγκινητικά που έχουν γραφτεί ποτέ.
Εγώ λεω ότι όσο γράφονται βιβλία που μπορούν να μας κάνουν να νιώσουμε τη μαγεία της λογοτεχνίας όλα θα πάνε καλά. Αστέρια πέντε και μία υπόκλιση.
