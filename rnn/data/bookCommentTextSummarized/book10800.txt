(she opens the freezer) Umm, why do you have a copy of The Shining in your freezer?Joey: Oh, I was reading it last night, and I got scared, so.Rachel: But ah, you’re safe from it if it’s in the freezer?Joey: Well, safer.
Y'know, I mean I never start reading The Shining, without making sure we’ve got plenty of room in the freezer, y'know.Rachel: How often do you read it?Joey: Haven’t you ever read the same book over and over again?Rachel: Well, umm, I guess I read Little Women more than once.
If you have not read The Shining already do not overlook the opportunity presented by the publication of Doctor Sleep, the sequel, to revisit one of the best ghost stories of our time.
It is difficult to think about the book without finding our mental screens flickering with the images of Jack Nicholson in full cartoonish psycho rage, the very effective sound of a Big Wheel followed by a steadicam coursing through the long halls of the hotel, and the best casting decision ever in choosing Scatman Crothers to play Dick Halloran.
There is considerable back-story to Jack and Wendy that gets no screen time.
This was most excellent; I can 100% see why this is many readers' favorite Stephen King novel.
Sure, it has all the creepy crawlies and spooky wookies to get your heart racing, but it's so grounded in reality that I had a hard time rationalizing with myself that "it's just a story." The 150 page set up is well worth the reader's time, as it lays the groundwork for much of the why behind the narrative, and it also gave me a chance to bond with precious Danny before the shit hit the fan.
I was sitting in an American English class at the University of Arizona, what seems like an eon ago, when a woman, older than the rest of us by probably 15 years or so, raised her hand and asked the teacher why we weren’t reading Stephen King for this class.
I don’t think I’d even read King at this point, but I’d been working in a bookstore for many years and knew how important he was to providing me with a paycheck.
That said, probably the best of King will be read 100 years from now.
Yeah, yeah, there at the end things got a little hairy, but it was still mostly a human trotting around getting all stabby.Now, I say mostly because good old Jack is getting some help from a couple of freaky paranormal spectres and...THE HEDGES!In an effort to be transparent, I feel like I should mention that I've never actually watched the movie that was based on this bestselling novel.
The gist is that there's this guy (Jack) who made a few mistakes because he was a bit boozy, and is now trying to go straight and get it together for his family.
Danny does not know that he has a gift; he takes it as a matter of course, until Dick Halloran of the Overlook Hotel tells him that he "shines on".Jack Torrance, Danny's Dad, reformed alcoholic and struggling writer, is trying to put his life back together after a tragedy.
King does a masterly job of awakening that child, and putting him/ her in the midst of childhood terrors through the alter ego of Danny Torrance, lost in the cavernous corridors of the Overlook.There are a lot of passages which literally creeped me out in this novel (the topiary animals, the fire hose in the corridor, the woman in the bathroom to name a few).
October 2016*2.5/5* Soooo I wasn't a huge fan of this. There were a few things about it that I enjoyed, but overall I found it to be boring and overly drawn out. Also not scary AT ALL which was my biggest disappointment. October 2015I'll probably pick this up again someday, but I'm really not in the mood for this right now. Reading Harry Potter alongside this kind of ruined it for me.... Oops.
About as perfect a haunted house story as can be, King was at his best here.
King touches base with psychological elements, theological, metaphysical, spiritual, and cryptic aspects of a ghost story to wrap the reader in a blanket of horror.** I watched the 1980 Stanley Kubrik film recently and this made me want to reread the book (which I need to anyway).
Kubrik's film grasps the psychological elements of the book and delivers an extra large thin crust The Works pizza of haunted house horror.
King also disagreed with the casting of Nicholson who too closely identified with insanity (due largely to his exceptional work in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest).
The man who was going to live by his wits....be a best selling author, acclaimed playwright and winner of the New York critics award, man of letters, winner of the Pulitzer Prize,  .....you killed my appetite .....
I’ll never be able to look at a Triscuit cracker again without thinking of “The Shining”, ....
let alone eat one.
You, Sir, took the joy out of crunching those little squares.
I can see why readers get hooked on King.
Huge thanks to Zoey!!!!!!
I’m so glad I read this!!!
An adrenaline rush!!!!!Off for a long Sat. morning hike - starting in 31 degrees.
Geee...
this is California!
It was so much better then the movie!The slow progression of insanity with Jack Torrance was one of the best things about this book.
I loved the overall menacing presence of The Overlook.
I loved how the hotel becomes more violent and threatening to Danny and his family the longer they stay there.
You just couldn't quit reading!I enjoyed Danny's struggle as a kid with understanding his 'gifts' and how to use them in a positive way.Danny, don't you dare go into room 217!This whole book was just awesome!
This review doesn't give this book justice for how great it is.
I recommend this book to Stephen King fans and horror lovers.One of the best books out there!
Five year old Danny has psychic mojo that includes reading thoughts and precognition courtesy of visions shown to him by his imaginary friend, Tony.Nearly broke, Jack takes on the job of being the winter caretaker for the Overlook.
As Jack is being driven into madness, Wendy and Danny become increasingly terrified of what he might do.I once read something in which King talked about denial of his own substance abuse problems in which he noted that he somehow wrote The Shining without ever once realizing he was describing his own alcoholism.
His best book is 'The Green Mile,' but since it doesn't quite fall under the Horror category, it is either 'Shining' or 'Carrie' which take top prize.There is not one single detriment to this well-known tale of the disintegration of the American family within the realm of the undead.
King is not a fan of the Kubrick film, and it is easy to see why.
His story is about the build up of tension, the "shining' a catalyst that promotes a bridge between the haunts & the humans.
To say the 'The Shining' is just a ghost story is something Kubrick ran with...

Now it’s time to watch the movie and read Doctor Sleep.
He took his time slowly unraveling the story, taking pages and pages to build the setting and deepen our relationship with the large cast of characters.
But SK takes even more pages, sometimes entire blasted chapters to develop his characters and set his scenes.
The fact that King takes his time building the horror makes the scary scenes that much scarier.
King takes you on a long roller coaster ride that moves slowly up the long, high incline before bringing us crashing down screaming our faces off at the end.
That says something to me and it got me thinking that there is a lot to like (and even love) about much of King’s work.
I also found myself thinking of this story as a pretty good microcosm of King’s work (both the good and the bad) as it contained many of King's strength and weaknesses.
Overall, I think King has created a classic, yet unique “haunted house” story while at the same time including an engaging and evocative depiction of obsession, alcoholism and madness.
Actual rating: 4.25 🌟Obviously this story is a famous one, which led to me not being all too surprised at the things that happened, but this doesn't mean that reading this book wasn't exciting and didn't keep me on the edge of my seat.
I read many stories where one thrilling thing happens after another, which just gets repetitive after awhile and takes away from the excitement.
Of course this can be a thing." No matter how out of this world the plot may seem.I really liked how every character in this book had a distinctive voice, even though there were many changes of the point of view.
A vague bartender who knows how to mix them, wild, crazy , raucous "people" inside, and noisy scenes happening frequently, sounds like fun...Now to begin, John "Jack" Torrance has a little drinking problem, a falling down drunk, to be honest, it wouldn't matter much to anyone, except he is married with a lovely wife Wendy and a good son Danny age five, he the kid, sees things though...which becomes a problem later on.
Let go by the school he desperately needs another job quickly, this is where the ancient Overlook Hotel, in the high Rocky Mountains of Colorado, over 10,000 feet in elevation, becomes important.
Καταπληκτικό! Δεν βαρέθηκα ούτε στιγμή! Η πλοκή κυλούσε σαν νεράκι. Αδυναμία μου βέβαια ήταν ο Ντάνι, το πενταχρονο αγόρι που πέρασε από πραγματική κόλαση. Τις τελευταίες 250 σελ. τις διάβασα χωρίς να αφήσω το βιβλίο από τα χέρια μου. Δεν μπορούσα να κοιμηθώ πριν φτάσω στο τέλος και πραγματικά άξιζε. Το τέλος με βρήκε με δάκρυα. Ανυπομονώ να διαβάσω και άλλα βιβλία του Stephen King που είναι ο βασιλιάς του είδους! Τουλάχιστον σε αυτό το βιβλίο.Αντε να δω πως θα κοιμηθώ τώρα.
Now I know why some things happened.
You know those things, the little things that are only in the head, written in the book, but doesn't show up in the movie part.
I know the book messed with my head but I didn't realize it would make me write that way!
I hope anyone reading this can understand what I meant.I really did enjoy the book, although I did feel a bit crazier than I am at times with all of the voices in everyone's head!
:) I didn't want one of the bad things that happened in the movie to NOT happen in the book.
Click here to watch a video review of this book on my channel, From Beginning to Bookend. Mix a heaping helping of exposition, a generous spoonful of backstory, a man struggling with alcoholism and a pinch of scares. Shake and pour over ice. Voila! La cocktail de Shining.

I actually really like Jack Torrance.
He has personality, plenty of flaws, and he’s just like every John Doe next door.
Stephen King does an excellent job describing Jack’s descent into madness.
Danny is another great character.
Because the way Stephen King describes the hotel, it’s not just a hotel.
It’s a person, a living and breathing thing with as sole desire to make sure the Torrances never leave.Suspenseful from the get-go, thrilling and terrifying, this is a great novel.
This is my first full-length novel read by Stephen King, and I can’t wait to dive into another one of his works soon.
Once upon a time, there was a young man who believed that books were always better than movies.
He read Dickens and saw filmed versions and knew it was so.
He read the popular books of his day, the mysteries and science fictions and fantasies, and those were always better than the movie.
The young man went out to read the book that gave birth to that image, knowing that the book MUST be better than the film.
It was gone, and with it his notions.Suddenly there was a film that was better than the book.
And it was happening everywhere around him.
Again, I can appreciate King’s craft, but didn’t find this a satisfying or fun experience.The obligatory comparison with the movie.Before reading this I’d watched the film a few times, enjoyed it, smirked at Jack Nicholson’s over the top performance and thought that Kurbrick’s vision of a horror movie was overblown but decent.
First, any questions or plot holes that might have been nagging at me after watching the movie were answered within a hundred pages of reading the book.
This inhuman place makes human monsters.When Jack, an alcoholic 14-months sober, gets offered a job as a caretaker for an old hotel in remote Colorado, he has no choice but to take it.
He packs up his wife, Wendy, and his psychic five-year-old son, Danny, and waits for the snows to come.The hotel has a Grudge, unfortunately.
There's probably a lot more.This Grudge sees Jack, his wife, and most especially his little boy Danny as a kind of all-you-can-eat buffet, personally delivered for its enjoyment.
I tried...I really did.I first read THE SHINING just before the movie came out on video- some time in the 80s- because usually if I watch the movie first, it is very rare that I go back and read the book- I remember liking it quite a bit, but over the years the movie and the book seemed to have blended into each other in my head.
I had only read the book once...but I have watched the movie zillions of times.
I never once believed that Jack ever loved his wife and son.Kubrick also took out much of the supernatural in the movie, making it more of a mental breakdown of Jack's character, than influence from a haunted hotel.
It don't hate you and me but it don't love us, either."My relationship with horror stories is a weird one.
I hate them, but my fascination for them always overpowers that feeling.
It may take me ages to pick up a certain book or watch a certain movie but at some point curiosity always kills the cat (and satisfaction brings it back.)The only Stephen King I've read before is Carrie.
Same thing applies to background details like the hotels history, its former owners and guests.King also leaves many questions about the hotel unanswered, which is equal parts torture and genius.
I saw the Ready Player One movie with so many scenes right from that old film and had to rewatch the original Kubrick film and read the original novel again for *very* good measure since I'm back on an SK kick.I watched that movie a few days ago and thought to myself, "This is a really bad movie.
I still think that Jack is pretty awesome, but no matter how cool he is, it can't save this film."And then I read the original book, keeping in mind what SK's thoughts were on the Kubrick film, as remembered so iconically through RPO.
But can even his son Danny's special gift, The Shining, stop him from going mad and butchering his family like other caretakers before him?Yes, I'm several decades late to the party in reading this but after reading Joe Hill's NOS4A2, I had to read my first non-Dark Tower Stephen King book in years to see how the old man did horror back in the day.
Sure, there were some creepy parts, most of them involving Jack or Danny and the Overlook's ghosts.
I think if I hadn't seen the movie first, the book would have been much more enjoyable for me.I think the advantage the movie has over the book is that a third of the time isn't spent delving into Jack Torrance's past.
