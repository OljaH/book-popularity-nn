After an interval--however long it takes for an alien to enjoy a meal al fresco--they lift off from our uninteresting planet, probably never to return, leaving behind the star voyager equivalent of empty beer cans, plastic forks, paper napkins, cigarette butts, and perhaps a noxious spill or two.
This book is the story of the "stalkers," the smugglers who venture into The Zone to bring back some of these dangerous and ultimately baffling artifacts for sale on the black market.The book begins as a rather straightforward adventure made superior by the imaginative creation of the Zone and its artifacts (the Strugatsky's add just the right details to delineate a place and evoke a mood, never more) but it deepens and enriches further as we learn more about Red and the stalkers, what they have risked and how very much they have lost.
”Intelligence is the attribute of man that separates his activity from that of the animals. It’s a kind of attempt to distinguish the master from the dog, who seems to understand everything but can’t speak. However, this trivial definition does lead to wittier ones. They are based on depressing observations of the aforementioned human activity. For example: intelligence is the ability of a living creature to perform pointless or unnatural act.”“Yes, that’s us!” There is a 1979 film by Andrei Tar
They ignored us.What The Frill?Here we are the most intelligent species to ever evolve on this planet (debatable) and the big moment occurs when another, obviously intelligent species comes to visit, and they act like the snooty prom queen and king at the big dance.
In these zones they left behind trash, as if, as one scientist put it, they had just stopped off for a roadside picnic.
Stalkers are people who go into The Zone and retrieve objects.
Arkady and Boris StrugatskyThe book was published in Russian in 1972 and translated into English in 1977.
It seems dishearteningly likely that the space visitors made little notice of us; that their visit here was little but a "roadside picnic" - a quick stop in the middle of nowhere, a break after which they left to never be seen again, leaving only a bit of waste behind them - the relics worth quite a bit of money, and a toxic area - the Zone¹ - where humans cannot survive, where the invisible effects of something inside it inflict permanent scars (mental and physical) on those brave (or foolish) enough to venture inside it.¹It was hard for me to believe that this book was written years before the catastrophic explosion at Chernobyl Nuclear Power Station - an explosion that left a "Zone" full of deadly invisible poison affecting those in it or near it, with ghost city that once was full of people and now is just a shell of a disaster.No wonder that in popular culture Chernobyl and Strugatsky's "stalker" became intertwined.
It would be like having to read the same page of the book over and over until I 'got it right' and could proceed to the end!""Isn't that exactly what you do spend your time doing with books?" He replied, "Haven't you just described literary analysis?"Hmm.A while ago, as most of you probably know, Roger Ebert wrote an article declaring that 'Video Games Can Never Be Art'.
As a bleak, lonely, post-apocalyptic world, I found it far more touching than The Road (which Ebert holds up as an example of modern art).But for me, video games have never been about the puzzles, the fights, the winning or losing; it's about the story, the experience, the quiet moments which define a world:
I join the ranks of sf aficionados who judge Arkady & Boris Strugatsky's Roadside Picnic among the greatest science fiction novels ever written.
Although there are six locals or Zones where aliens left mysterious objects behind on this planet, the setting for Roadside Picnic takes place in and around one such Zone in Harmont, Canada, a fictional mining town way out in the boonies.
This abandoned apartment complex built by Soviet Gulag prisoners looks like a movie set for the film Stalker Xenology, the study of extraterrestrials I agree with Dr. Pillman: the way we humans are going about studying the left-behinds is highly flawed in that it assumes the aliens think like we think.
This is probably their best-known novel internationally thanks to a movie Stalker by Tarkovsky and several video games by the same name.
The Zones are dangerous, but the artifacts are highly prized and so some people called stalkers smuggle things from Zones.
During the progress of the story Red pays the price of visiting the Zone in full.
Even after my countless rereads I still get spooked being inside it following Red's expeditions.As with a lot of good Soviet science fiction, expect a lot of question asked, no clear answers provided and no happy end, but still in my opinion the ending was very powerful and moving.
What happens when aliens arrive on Earth and leave again without so much as a hello, leaving behind all their rubbish?
This book carries the spirit of a trend in human history.
The Earth is not at the centre of the Universe, nor is the Universe confined to our single solar system, galaxy, or even cluster of galaxies.
We’re not at the centre of anything.
A funny, tragic and unique take on alien contact, Roadside Picnic offers a thoughtful and fascinating look at what it means to be human.
It’s a dangerous job as the zones are radioactive or magical or something as illness, mutation and death stalk the alleyways and empty streets in an eerie prophesy of Chernobyl years after this was published.SF fans will draw comparisons to Frederik Pohl’s 1977 novel Gateway because of the profitable but hazardous collection of alien relics.
But whereas Pohl’s novel was hard SF, this had the Russian literature undercurrent of depression and morose introspection.This was very influential and even contained a Vonnegut reference; a classic in the genre and a must read for fans.
Others have gone over the connections better than I will, but I can say one thing freely: The two are very similar in the gross, between the oddness within the area and the desire for both understanding and possible trinkets, but that's pretty much where the similarities end.
Sure, we'll keep asking questions in both novels, long after they've ended, but this one keeps things pretty light even when the MC is crawling through the mud.

You know, when a book is so bloody fishing good and fantastic and amazing and also a little stupendous that you have absolutely nothing-zilch-nada-zip-rien de rien to say about it?
This short novel is a "how-to" on sidelong insinuations, information gaps, and inferences that make for a wholly satisfying story.
The main character, Redrick Schuhart, starts out as an entrepreneurial collector of alien artifacts, and becomes a hardened, curmudgeonly, but effective artifact hunter searching for (view spoiler)[the ultimate prize, a golden ball that purportedly gives the owner his wishes (hide spoiler)].
Aliens have left some things behind.
No one quite knows the full functionality of the artifacts, and no one understands the full dangers of "The Zone".
But I digress.Like many great books, the meaning of the ending is left up to the reader.
The short novel deals with the aftermath or cultures that develop from “The Visitation”, as this event came to be known.This book reminds me of “Big Dumb Object” sci-fi trope where an alien artifact is found by humans but their owners are absent, for examples  Rendezvous with Rama ,  Gateway, and  Ringworld .
The main difference is that the objects in Roadside Picnic are little ones scattered all over the Zones of Visitation, your average sci-fi BDOs are gigantic things floating in space.
I imagine this is due to the perfunctory developments of these characters; even though much of the narrative is focused on Redrick Schuhart I don’t feel like I know much about him by the end of the book.
Being below the concern of alien beings is not a new science fiction theme (although it is a relatively rare one), but I've never read a book that examined the idea quite like this.
Ursula K.
Le Guin's foreword is right - most of the time, the people who interact with alien technology are highly skilled and educated, even if, as in Rendezvous With Rama, the aliens couldn't care less about us.Note: The rest of this review has been withdrawn due to the recent changes in Goodreads policy and enforcement.
You can read why I came to this decision here.In the meantime, you can read the entire review at Smorgasbook
And as for anything else -that’s fate."I'm afraid I'll keep responding to the words "Russian science fiction" by shouting "We by Yevgeny Zamyatin!" since, in my humble opinion, Roadside Picnic does not reach those level if not, maybe, in the concept.
Because the concept is great (what if the infamous alien invasion finally came, only in the form of our foreign friends having a merry picnic and discarding their litter and scrap and waste there on the ground?
The characters are no better.In all honesty, I can't recommend Roadside Picnic: it looks like one of those books that will make you somehow richer as a reader and as a person, but in fact it left me nothing at all.
This is telling about the renown of this SF book from the Soviet era; a renown that is probably due, in part, to Andrei Tarkovsky’s Stalker (1979), loosely adapted by the Strugatsky brothers, who took part in the screenplay, from the last section — and undoubtedly the best part — of their book.The setup is commonplace in SF literature: some aliens have visited our planet.
It expands across some ten years of the life of stalker Red Schuhart, with scattered episodes: conversations regarding the peddling of alien objects, talks on the nature of aliens and humans, incursions inside the Zone, streams of consciousness.
When the war ended and we all left, the locals were confused over how these goods came, and in some instances imitated army procedures and made Army insignia in order to get the cargo once again.
A strange and technologically advanced entity has visited Earth and we are left stumbling around wondering what happened.
They visited one day, left behind incomprehensible magic, and left us to wander around and peck at the scraps, like animals at a roadside picnic.The book has an irresistible premise.
There is a good chance of a quick and painful death, but also imaginable riches.This fantastic idea aside, the book read poorly in many places.
Ακόμα ένα βιβλίο που χρησιμοποιεί την ΕΦ για να εμβαθύνει στους κοινωνικούς και πολιτικούς προβληματισμούς του ανθρώπου...Οι εξωγήινοι περνάν μια βόλτα από τον πλανήτη μας και φεύγοντας αφήνουν διάφορα αντικείμενα τα οποία γίνονται πόλος έλξης για επιστήμονες, τυχοδιώκτες και οραματιστές...
Τα "σκουπίδια" των εξωγήινων βρίσκονται σε μια περιοχή που ονομάζεται Ζώνη και εκτός των θησαυρών κρύβει πολλά και διάφορα μυστικά.
Οι άνθρωποι ανακαλύπτουν έναν καινούργιο πολιτισμό ή ποια πραγματικά είναι η θέση τους μέσα στο σύμπαν;;; Το βιβλίο είναι δυνατό και η γραφή των αδελφών Στρουγκάτσκι στρωτή.
Τα 2 πρώτα κεφάλαια είναι ελαφρώς κουραστικά όμως τα 2 τελευταία είναι άκρως ενδιαφέροντα και παρασύρουν τον αναγνώστη στο δυστοπικό μέλλον των συγγραφέων!
what you're telling me is that aliens turned up, ignored us, trashed the place, and buggered off back to Andromeda or wherever?"RP: "Yep." Welcome to the world of Roadside Picnic, the novel Tartovsky' famous film Stalker is based on.Aliens have visited several places around the world.
It turns the underpinnings of the story completely away from the usual directions Alien technology focused stories take, which is usually something to do with the discovery of world-changing tech left on a distant world by a long-dead alien race whose origins are now lost in the mists of time, blah-blah-snore.
First contact is made in the form of Zones and its far from idyllic or disastrous scenarios from the SF past.
What we got is far more akin to a slap to the face...
hell we can understand a slap.
This is an indifferent gesture, if it can be called that and nobody knows for certain.
This uncertainty and danger sucks in all that have anything to do with it and probably drives them mad, or at least make them pay for it.
We see all this through the life of the Stalker Red and with him ask: Why, How, Did we do something wrong, Is it worth it, and never get an answer.
4,5*
Since then Roadside Picnic has been published in dozens of editions and languages over the years, and inspired the 1979 Andrei Tarkovsky film Stalker, which the Strugatsky brothers wrote the screenplay for.The story is set after the Visitation, when aliens briefly stopped on the Earth and left six Zones where strange alien technology and physical phenomenon exist.
Instead, we have the Stalker, the Writer, and the Professor (much like the 4 main characters of Vandermeer’s Annihilation), the latter two seeking either inspiration or fame by discovering a Room in the Zone that will grant the entrant’s deepest wish.We are then subjected to over two hours where almost nothing happens at all.
Somehow Andrei Tarkovsky was able to read this, extract an absolute masterpiece of pseudo-genre film, and yet actually have almost no relation to the source.
Where Tarkovsky took this into ambiguity and philosophic riffs, the original is more specific in its terms, dealing almost entirely with the massive criminal economy that springs up in the wake of a tremendous event (if you've ever wondered what the Zone actually is, here we're simply told in the first pages, but that doesn't scratch the surface).
This is equally present in the actual descriptions of the Zone -- which are incredible, nail-biting, and bizarre -- and in the surrounding events sometime only obliquely mentioned.
Roadside Picnic is one of those, although I have another reason to read it that will soon be revealed.This is a story about the aftermath of a first contact event - except there wasn't as much contact as aliens treating Earth like a...
roadside picnic.
They came in, destroying entire areas and rendering others unsafe for humans (the forbidden zones), and left a lot of debris.
"Stalkers" comb the zones for alien technology that they can only guess at the purpose, and suffer the consequences.
But mostly it looks like an ordinary neighborhood, with ordinary houses, nothing special about it except that there are no people around.”The aliens had visited the Earth and they had gone but after them, there were left visitation zones that humans vainly try to explore, understand and use.Roadside Picnic is a complex investigation of transcendence: of the moral, scientific, political and humanistic problems, it can create…There are rumours of the Golden Sphere hidden in the Visitation Zone and bruited about that it can grant any human wish…“He laughed a happy laugh, crouched down, and beat the ground with his fists as hard as he could.
If you're into stuff like this, you can read the full review.Matter-of-Factness SF: "Roadsiden Picnic" by The Strugatsky Brothers(original review, 2000)Just started re-reading this yesterday and am already gripped.
It's truly unsettling in the most understated of ways.
It reminds me a little of John Wyndham's work; it has a similar quality of matter-of-factness about it that somehow makes it all the more chilling.Pure literary gold...strangely put me in mind of "Stoner".
You read and there is no way you can stop.
Or you've arrived at work and, seriously, you can't stand in front of class reading a random book; especially not on your smartphone.
It focuses attentively on the unscrupulous and fiercely competitive atmosphere that would settle among us humans on our rush to turn alien litter into profit to escape poverty and starvation.The setting and how it influences and informs the characters about life, happiness and freedom might seem analogous to the oppressive conditions in Soviet Russia, but if it renders us a glimpse of the stagnation of the Soviet era in the 70s, it does so by concentrating on how short, scarce and unpredictable are the lives of the fictional men charging into the Zone by need and by greed.I don’t mean to say it is a book remarkably free of politics, which is not the case, but the focus of the book is largely directed towards the time concerns of unchecked scientific research and nuclear fallout.Those who know the video game series S.T.A.L.K.E.R., especially the first game in the series, “S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl”, will recognize several main parallel plot points - such as the wish granter - and familiar elements, like the artifacts, the gravitational anomalies, and the ability to throw bolts to scout for anomalies on the trail to the center of the zone.

Uuuh, ovo je bilo fascinantno, kako narativno, tako i idejno. Slobodna struktura koja se dosta retko sreće u žanru, kuplovana sa implikacijama vanzemaljske posete, kao i nekim nihilističkim idejama. Greota što nije duže, mada možda je i ta mera upravo ono što izaziva tako snažan utisak.5-
Somehow, in spite of his failings, we sympathize with Red, even as we sometimes cringe at his cruelty and indifference to others.Red narrates some of the story; although other parts of it are narrated by other characters, for example, Richard Noonan, a contractor who's a friend of Red.At the beginning of the book, Red has a day job as a lab technician at the International Institute of Extraterrestrial Cultures, a local think tank on matters relating to the Zone and the Visitation.

Roadside Picnic questions the meaning of "human intelligence" while, at the same time, putting our intellectual (dis)abilities under the microscope.
What if Newton was to come across a microwave emitter, as one of the characters in the book puts it?
That's what the characters face in Roadside Picnic and the best that they can come up with, is to sell and make profit of the findings.
