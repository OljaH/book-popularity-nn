I'd say that this is sheldon's best book. Among all of his books, this was the one that could drop my jaw down..haaa. I remembered reading this book during my grammar class, since i could not put it down even for a single second.In the end i was kicked out of the class because unconsciously i was gasping very loudly. Sheldon really put the story in a stunning and excellent way. The plot, starting from the beginning,the climax, till the end was really well written. You would never have guessed that it would end that way...
I had heard a lot about Sheldon's novel and borrowed the book.Nothing Lasts Forever did not make much of an impression but Tell Me Your Dreams was the real deal.
All the trademark ingredients of Sidney Sheldon novels such as sex, deception, betrayal, dark secrets, ulterior motives, greed, opportunism have been skilfully used.
I had come across the said condition somewhere prior to reading this book the first time but couldn't place it in the story.
If you like thrillers and do not mind sex & gore -then you might enjoy the book.
"Iar ea își aminti durerea așteptării disperate a lui Jim din gară, cum crezuse în cuvintele lui, având încredere în el. Se răzgândise și nu fusese suficient de bărbat să vină și să-i spună asta. În schimb, o lăsase să aștepte într-o gară, singură.""-Ai avut mare noroc. Dar, asta e, unii au noroc, unii nu. De multe ori, Dumnezeu se joacă cu destinele noastre, nu?"
Svakom prevodiocu je zadovoljstvo i čast da dobije priliku da prevodi autora koga voli i čije je sve knjige pročitao... :) Prošlo je 15 godina od prvog objavljivanja ovog prevoda... I knjiga je doživela da je objavi i treći izdavač... Prvo izdanje bilo je Narodne knjige, drugo Alnarija, a najnovije, ovogodišnje Vulkana... a verovatno će ove godine osvanuti i prvo crnogorsko izdanje... :) ali u pitanju je u svim slučajevima isti prevod... :)
With Sidney Sheldon books, most of the time you can't find right words to write in your review. Because you are so thrilled to speak or write anything.This book was adorable.
This is another masterpiece of Sheldon.
This book is full of psychological brain game.
Sheldon described the alters with very good tricky ideas.
I should use my imagination as good as my logic mind to find out what the issues really were.
I still couldn't find another fiction book which tells Multiple Personality Disorder as clear as Sheldon's "Tell Me Your Dreams".
It even helped to understand MPD when I took psychology in university!
;pI own this book for myself, Indonesian version, and had read it for maybe 20 times.
I read the English version once and it was even better for me.
(if you could be kind and forgiving enough to categorize them as twists that is).However, the reason why I hated the book was because really how dumb does the author expect us to be?
Second, the different characters are so shallow and so poorly fleshed out that you actually feel like whether you're reading a last moment class assignment, or an actual published work.
Maybe if you have not read works like Stieg Larsson's The Millennium Trilogy, then you might empathize with the protagonist, or gush about how great it is.I guess it was a feat in itself for me to complete the book.
teehee:pMoreover, the whole story comprises of attention-grabbing characters with different professions/jobs like painters, jewelry shop owners, introverts, computer technicians, psychos, cops, detectives, lawyers, and doctors, but it does not dwell on police procedures very well.
Despite all the differences of the characters mentioned above; this is still a simple, easy, and an unforgettable read.
I would suggest that you better hang on to your seat guys!In the end, I wanted to spoil a little excerpt… “There could have been a terrible ending for her (Ashley Patterson), but this was the happy ending she had prayed for.I'm on my way at last.
In the next two chapters, we are introduced to Toni Prescott and Alette Peters who work at the same company with Ashley.
Toni is six years younger than Ashley, born in England, she is a bit of a wild child with serious maternal issues.
When Ashley attends her ten year reunion, she learns that Jim was viciously murdered and castrated the morning they were supposed to meet.
Toni and Alette are both alters which had been created by a traumatic experience (when Ashley was six and eight years old).
This novel was written in the third person, with insight into the minds of Ashley, Toni and Alette.
That's because there's a touch of psychology in here.
Psychology's holy grail plus murder equals a masterpiece!
I can say that Sidney Sheldon is a good writer because of this book.I remember being amazed of how Sidney Sheldon narrated this novel.
Where everything at first is confusing and gradually it all becomes clear until the very end.
(Oh, it's also a book about healing...) Unlike what has happened in Doomsday Conspiracy, where everything in the end is just - bleh (sorry for the lack of a better term).
Anyway, as an end note, I just want to you to imagine me whistling the tune of Pop goes the weasel!
This story is about the women, Ashley Patterson, who suffer the multiple personalities disorder.
Both of them was created when Ashley was raped by her father, Dr. Steven Patterson, who is famous doctor in the world.
Last part is the story about how Ashley overcome her problem.
The concerns is that how to overcome their problem and create a new life and build a positive mind.
Many people are hardly to listen to the positive message form media and journal.
Always listen to the negative message from relationship and think of the awful image from the violent movie.
A savage killer whose modus operandi sends a chill down men's spines: viciously stabbing the men to death, and then cruelly slashing off their private part!
Apparently a demon straight from hell; yet the truth might be unbelievable.
The killer, a woman is charming, courteous, amiable, peace loving.
The epitome of a most desirable young woman.
Confused?
This is a chilling story, confusing and unpalatable in many parts.
Inevitably, Ashley's world falls apart, resulting in a celebrated trial - with the horrified world focused on the goings-on in the court.
Is Ashley a cold blooded killer, or is she innocent?
Forensic evidence shows that she is as guilty as hell.
Not until my husband eagerly introduced it to me and showed me how he'd been impressed by the Sheldon's novels.
This eventually marks the first novel of Sidney Sheldon I've read.
And I guess he had done some research before, thus from the novel I could get some valuable information about MPD syndrome and the criminal trial process in the State, though the later perhaps wasn't descripted deeply.
So I could say that I was as much impressed as my husband, and feel so much confident to read other novels by Sidney Sheldon.
هر وقت در مقابل دست درازی مردی قرار میگیره، اون رو به طرز وحشیانه ای میکشه.کتاب معمایی نیست و فقط جناییه.
روان شناسان زیادی به چندشخصیتی باور ندارن و اونو دلیل موجهی برای اثبات بی گناهی مجرم نمیدونن.من متخصص نیستم ولی کسی که به خاطر جنون به طرز وحشیانه ای دیگران رو سلاخی کنه، شاید مجرم نباشه اما هیچ وقت نمیشه آزادش گذاشت.(view spoiler)[احتمالا نویسنده هم همین نظر رو داشته.
چون از پاراگراف های آخر کتاب معلوم بود که اشلی می خواد بره و از پدرش، کسی که در کودکی آزارش کرده بوده، انتقام بگیره (hide spoiler)]
There was no suspense, no plot twist and I really wanted the story to end quickly so I could read my other “precious” books.
Second part felt like an alter of John’s Grisham A time to kill… or The firm…..or his other not so cool law-based books.
Lately I’ve seen this Korean drama based on lawyers and prosecutors; I hear your voice.
If I ever kill my professors or steal books I’d better sit on the electric chair than have him as my advocate.
But obviously the main subject of the book was the MPD Sidney so charmingly wrote about.
The third part somehow made me give this book another star.
Awesome. Doesn't matter which book of Sydney Sheldon you are reading, it will always make you thrilled.It is the story of a girl named Ashley Patterson, who is suffering from Multiple Personality Disorder yet she is unaware of it. She has two other alters named Toni Prescott and Alette Peters, who know her but she does not know them. Very nice thriller. Go for it 👌
It was perfect the first time. It was perfect the second time. What more do I need to add? Review to come if I find the right words.
Toni Prescott and Alette Peters are both co-workers of Ashley's, however the similarities end there.
Reminiscent of high school, Toni and Alette do their best to keep Ashley out of their cool clique, but find it extremely difficult after a string of murders irrevocably binds their lives together.
Toni, Alette and Ashley know virtually nothing about each other until all three women are inexplicably linked into a murder investigation that will lead to one of the most bizarre trials of the century.This book is a work of fiction, but is based on several actual cases.
The story is about a girl with a multiple personality disorder..And she's completely unaware of it.
The book goes through three stages: One, the girl, and her multiple conflicting personas, get involved in a horrible serial murder case.
The third phase focuses on her efforts to overcome her disorder.The best thing about Sheldon's novels is their ability to completely immerse the reader in the ocean of the plot.
Crime and mystery lovers, this is one book you'll never regret reading..
even after you read it twice..
i've read this book when i was a freshman in highschool.
all my peers talk about this like it's the best book ever.
but after a few years, i can't help but frown all throughout re-reading this book.
**SPOILER ALERT**the circumstances that was chosen by the author to set and deliver the "twists" of the story were HORRIBLE.
a character who only meets sexual abusers???
THE PLOT WAS SO FORCED.
and the development of the characters were so inconsistent.
like the police officer that she killed.
that was the initial establishment of the character, then all of a sudden he ends up forcing ashley to have sex???
I'm out of words! This book blew my mind. It just became one of my all-time favorites.
I felt nostalgic when my colleague gave me some old books her mother owned.
I read 3 of his book (not that many i admit )but i was surprised abouth his writing style.
I will read all of the books i got of course.
This kind of books are very easy to read.
I hope i am not going to insult his fans by saying that this is *I will read on the beach style of book*(which i did) .
It was very easy to see during a trial that she is just not going to be executed so trial felt pointless...
Tell Me Your Dreams  is a very interesting, engaging, nail-biting and heart-pounding read based on the concept of Multiple Personality Disorder or Split Personality. Being a nurse, this book grabbed my attention immediately. And I was hooked from page one up to the last. I won't go into details because I don't want to spoil it for those who haven't read it yet and besides this book needs to be read. If you are Sidney Sheldon fan or Mystery/Suspense lover, you would really have a great time read

4.5
Actual rating 3.5CONTAINS SPOILERSThis was such a great book!
The characters were great and had depth.
I totally believed the whole story.
I believed the characters.
The romance between Gilbert and Ashley wasn't actually shown, even though it was clearly pointed out in some places that the two had feelings for each other.
It would have been even greater if Ashley and him became a couple when the therapy finished.
It was never mentioned in the book.3.
Sheldon said that dr Patterson and his wife always fought about one thing, which was as well never mentioned.
I chose to read this one because I learned from some forum that this is about (view spoiler)[ multiple personalities (hide spoiler)]. It's too late to realize that I have spoiled myself on that part. If I didn't know what this was about, it surely would be a mindfuck. And all that happens after, even the ending was a bit predictable already. Yep, it really isn't anyone's fault but me. I've been hearing good things about the author for a while but I only found time to read one now which I immedia

I've been hearing good things about the author for a while but I only found time to read one now which I immediately regretted because her writing is excellent.
Now, I am just thrilled to learn more about the author's works.
2015 Reading Challenge: #41 Libro de un autor nunca leído   Primer libro que leo de este señor y me gustó mucho. Al principio era un estilo el psicoanalista pero después cambia de rumbo y me sorprendió porque pude conocer más sobre el tema judicial; planeo leer otras obras suyas.
The best Sidney Sheldon novel by far, and I have read quite a few in my days, when life was all about sneaking novels into the dorms and reading them under blanket covers. A feat feasible through generosity of friends who were days-scholars and made them available for reading
4.5 stars rounded down to 4!You know when you are listening a really loud rock song and you become oblivious to the world around you and become a part of an imaginary music video which is only in your head.
And then the song finishes and you look at people around you sitting in silence completely unaware of the great music that was jamming in your headphones seconds ago.
(view spoiler)[I took me a while to understand all the alters of Ashley but I loved the way each one was so different from each other.
I loved the character of David Singer even though the court scenes felt repetitive after some time.
Toni dan Alette saling kenal, tetapi Ashley sama sekali tidak mengetahui mereka.
Hingga terjadi 5 pembunuhan sadis pria dgn penikaman beruntun dan dikebiri.Bagian kedua adalah ttg si pengacara David Singer dgn segala problemanya menghadapi kengototan ayah Ashley dgn mengungkit hutang budi dan ambisinya menjadi partner di firma tempatnya dia bekerja.
David shock ketika mengetahui dan melihat sendiri Ashley mengalami gangguan Multiple Personality Disorder dimana perilaku dominan Toni sama sekali tidak bisa dikontrol oleh si tuan rumah, Ashley.
Dan titik terang mulai terjadi saat masa kecil Ashley terungkap.Walaupun saya tahu novel ini hanya fiksi belaka, saya tergelitik juga bhw ada "kebenaran" dlm kasus MPD ini.
