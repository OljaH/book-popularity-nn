Fifth Formers of St Clare's (St. Clare's, #8), Enid Blytonعنوان: پنجمی ها در سنت کلر جلد 8؛ نویسنده: انید بلایتون؛ مترجم: ایلونا جودمردی؛ مشخصات نشر: تهران، شهر کتاب، هرمس (کیمیا)، 1386، در 207 ص، شابک: 9789643632076؛ جلد 8 از مجموعه سنت کلر
Another book in Blyton's series about St Clare Boarding School.
This book was first published in 1945 and it is important to keep that in mind when reading as some of the language is dated and means something entirely different in current times.
This was a particularly humerous book with a wonderful description of Mamzelle's hilarious night catching burglars.Just to set the mode of the time, here is a brief quote:"Each term brought different things to learn, besides lessons.
Those girls who faced their difficulties, saw and understood their faults, conquered their failings, and became strong characters and leaders would make the finest wives and mothers of the future."
This book series is very sweet and has lovely little moral values spun within each adventure of the twins. Character development is the main focus of each story as the twins meet new classmates and teachers upon each return to their school. Life experiences teach valuable lessons.My favorite character is Carlotta, the little circus girl who loves who she is through and through and remains unique throughout every school year.
Pas baca buku pertama seri St Clare ini kupikir kalah menarik daripada seri Si Badung atau Malory Towers. Tapi ternyata setelah baca buku kedua hingga yang keenam ini, seri ini justru seri sekolah berasrama yang paling kusukai dari dua seri lainnya. Soalnya memang kisah anak-anak St Clare jalani masa sekolahnya ini lebih variatif dan lebih terkesan menantang. Solusinya pun ga se-jump to conclusion kayak dua seri lainnya.Rekomen banget lah 😁.
I like this book. It really is interesting it engages the reader.
I loved it! But i'm soo sad that the fifth formers can't play any tricks nor have midnight feasts because they are fifth formers!
ada anak baru, anak baru tersebut kemudian berulah, terus diselesaikan eh disadarkan di st clare.
Tapi anak kelas IV yang diturunkan krn sesuatu hal.Ternyata dia menderita suatu penyakit yang mendorongnya selalu makan dan tidak dapat mengendalikan diri.Tapi di seri terakhir ini, Mirable yg sebelumnya telah baik, justru menjadi congkak dan sombong setelah diangkat menjadi Ketua Murid bidang Olahraga.Oya, Angela si Cantik juga kena batunya.
Dia tidak naik kelas karena malas belajar dan hanya peduli pada kecantikannya.Endingnya, si Kembar Pat dan Isabel diangkat jadi ketua murid untuk periode terakhir mereka ada di st clare.udah deh
gadis gadis st clare naik ke kelas 5!
banyak sekali yang terjadi di semester ini: mirabel yang menjadi ketua olahraga sekolah tapi kemudian sempat menjadi lupa diri.
Alma pudden anak kelas 6 yang diturunkan dari kelas 6, serta cs claudine-antoinette kakak beradik yang merupakan keponakan mam'zelle.di akhir cerita, pat dan isabel menjadi ketua murid di st clare karena mereka akan naik kelas 6, kelas tertinggi di sekolah asrama itu.
yah, sedikit memaksa sih menurut saya, kesannya seolah olah ingin agar pat dan isabel selalu sama, seragam, dan setara.
dan sejujurnya saya juga membayangkan kalau Angela itu pasti lovable hahaha :))
I understand that I haven't read the other books in the series, but I seriously doubt that would make these characters any more likeable for me.
These are stereotypical high school girls - mean, bitchy, sneaky, conceited, self-centred.
This book doesn't represent the image of a world I'd like to see for girls.
It represents reality for far too many and doesn't do enough to condemn a bullying culture.That's just my opinion, guys.
Much love to everyone who praises this book and its characters and genuinely has soft spots for them.
You found something in this book that I didn't.
Love to everyone xoxo
yeay, buku terakhir dari seri si St. Clare. menceritakan Pat dan Isabel yang sudah duduk di kelas lima. lucunya, saya tidak mengerti apakah edisi Bahasa saja yang terdiri dari enam buku. yang jelas seri St. clare terjemahan bahasa ini melewatkan kisah Pat dan Isabel di kelas tiga dan kelas enam. ya secara umum, buku ini menarik sekali. saya pribadi senang membacanya, bukan hanya karena ini buku cerita anak-anak yang ringan, namun darinya saya menjadi tahu karakteristik sekolah asrama yang menyenangkan. semoga nanti berkesempatan memiliki atau mengelola sebuah sekolah asrama :))
It did irk me growing up that this was the last book. What about the sixth form, and prefectship??Antoinette was just not as fun as Claudine, but then who could be? Although MAD PROPS to her for the trick she plays on Angela, who abuses the system of the upper forms getting the lower forms to run errands for them. ;) We also get the wonderfully named Alma Pudden here, yay! Such a pasty, puddingy little horror.
Pat, Isabel and Alison have matured enough to enroll in the Fifth Form. Does everyone think they are just too mature and dignified for the naughty exploits and "treeks" they have been accustomed to play on unsuspecting mistresses? Never mind, Claudine and her little sister Antoinette cause plenty of mischief to make the book fun for Blyton's many readers. Typically, Blyton was unconcerned about political correctness: a troubled fat girl is the book's hapless villain.
I think it's one of her best books. It's got all the elements of a good St Clare's novel - funny jokes, friendship and camaraderie, yummy food and a great ending which sadly is also a bit of a cliffhanger. It's a shame she never wrote the missing terms, I'll definitely try and read the Pamela Cox's fill-ins.
This was actually the first book I had read of the St. Clares series years back. And this along with the second formers at St. Clares is my favorite in the series. While second formers feels warm and fuzzy, this one is out and out fun. This book also has some serious moments and some take aways, the humor is what stands out.
The st clare's books were my all time favorite books as a child. The O'sullivan twins were incredibly likable and following their adventures though school encouraged me to read and enjoy it. Midnight feasts were my favorite concept in the series and I believe they are an excellent read for any little girl.
love the book hate the print I love this book but the print is horrible I'm 9 and I can't read some of this because of the print it's stupid that I paid for all the books in the collection and the print is unbelievable
awessome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!i learned a simple thing but a good onewe should not overreact when we get a higher position than otherslike mirabel did in this book!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!The chapters were quite interestingi am excited to read the next part
Foi uma colecção que li completa e seguidinha! Não foi maçadora nem fui perdendo o interesse...aconselho a adolescentes pois embora os tempos sejam outros há sempre alguns temas em comum na adolescência de todos nós!
Un buen final para una buena serie
Interesting..funny..
i think sinting
Mrzelo mě, že dvojčata a další ústřední postavy už tu jsou poněkud v pozadí a nedostává se jim tolik prostoru, nahrazují je mladší dívky.Ale závěr byl - klišé! Ale dojemný a jiný bych nežádala.
Con todo, es el mejor de todos los libros, aunque le sobra la parte moralista para mi gusto! Pero con la serie de incidentes ocurridas a Madmoiselle en la media noche me he reído bastante!!
finished the st clare series, finally!! ^^
For all of it being a book of its time, it's still just as charming and fun as I found it when I read it when I was a little girl. Soo happy I re-read it in English.
Suka sama covernya, baca buku2 EB jadi kepengen merasakan minum teh ala Inggris. Terus bikin pesta sembunyi2 tengah malam, hehehe
The ending Is really quite satisfying of the last book. Ah I love St Clares I'd forgotten how much xxx
nice 1
It's so lovely to see how the O'Sullivan twins, Pat and Isabel, have matured since the first book in this beloved series by Ms Enid Blyton!
#2011-26#Buku terakhir serial St. Clare.Saat anak-anak pemberontak ini berubah menjadi dewasa tak terkecuali Allison.Persahabatan masa sekolah memang takkan pernah berakhir.
