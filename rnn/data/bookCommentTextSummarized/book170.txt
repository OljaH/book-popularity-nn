This is especially thematic in the title story "Tropic Death", in which a middle class black child, Gerald Bright, is repeatedly interrupted from his hobby of staring at the sea to be immersed in the problems of the poor children around him and the troubled reunion of his mother and father.
(from "Tropic Death")The frequent descriptions of the white quarries of 'marl', a kind of limestone, also have the same oppressive effect on the writing.
Tropic Death provides a vivid series of glimpses into the lives of people usually in the background of such exotic novels.
A superb gift of a book as far as lyrical beauty and storytelling prowess. Hemingway of the Caribbean, if you'll allow. The beautifully rendered patois makes this book nearly qualify as a foreign language and encourages readers to slow down. Incredible imagery and often very funny.
A little hard to read because of dialect but excellent.
I din't understand much of it but the characters manage to touch you for the briefest moment that they appear.
