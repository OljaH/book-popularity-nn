Možda je malo nepravedno suditi skoro sto godina staru knjigu po današnjim standardima, ali... Likovi su bili užasno loši, bez ikakve boje u njima, a nagla ljubav je gotovo pa potpuno apsurdna, radnja nije bila ništa bolja, a nije pomoglo što nema apsolutno nikakve atmosfere u knjizi. Totalno me nije zanimalo što će se dalje dogoditi, niti tko je za što kriv.
It felt like the story was all over the place. I understand it's a mystery, but it was sometimes too confusing to follow. No detailed explanation at the end.
In this book, the beautiful Jane Leith is induced by her father, John Leith, to marry Peter Clifton, a young man who is very rich, but who seems to have had a shadowy past.
Perhaps he has a shadowy present as well, he keeps appearing through the book in sketchy situations.
Jane barely knows Clifton before she marries him.
One of Peter Clifton's best friends is the Harley Street physician, Mr. Donald Cheyne Wells.
Cheyne Wells is also Clifton's physician.
It also appears that Peter Clifton has a hobby of producing etchings, very fine ones too.
Lots of interesting twists and turns to this mystery but still a tight enough plot that everyting wraps up in the end. It takes a couple chapters to meet all the characters and to get the gist of the story but after that it's quite a page turner.
When the "guilt" of the main character is stuffed down one's throat like this, one quickly becomes pretty certain that it isn't guilt at all, especially when none of the other characters even possibly qualifies as the hero.
A.L. Burt, 1927
Really interesting book with unexpected end.
