That was positively mad! (Pun intended).
3.5 stars
This short story is not Parker Pine or Harley Quinn as it has been labeled . It is a very good non series detective short story .
But there is a long road before we reach that point.
At what particular spot on it shall we erect a post and say,"On this side sanity, on the other madness?" It can't be done...if a man suffering from a delusion happened to hold his tongue about it, in all probability we should never be able to distinguish him from a normal individual.
The EXTRAORDINARY SANITY of the INSANE is most interestingA nice little story with a clever twist...
An extra point for the above quote...
Not sure why this is labeled as a Parker Pyne short story, as that character doesn't appear at all. If anything, it seems very suited to Satterthwaite & Quin. Would make for a very thrilling adaptation, I think. Christopher Lee has a marvelous voice, but I think I would have enjoyed this more had I read it myself instead of listening. Still very good though, wonderful surprises.
It was a very refreshing and entertaining reading. Agatha has made it back to her unique style with this story
Good short story
A lovely, twisty short with a little bit of creepy. And they call Dame Agatha "cozy." hmpf
This was a fun quick read! I think it's safe to say that i'm an Agatha Christie fan!
Middling Christie, ably acted by Christopher Lee.
A seance and a psychic premonition. A twisty short story.
Another brilliant one by Agatha Christie, with a spot-on narration by Christopher Lee.
Always love a Christie
A good and interesting short story book.
