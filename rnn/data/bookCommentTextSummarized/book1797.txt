In the spirit of Read All the Christies, I ordered this after seeing it in someone's feed.
I've been reading Christie for a long time, so it's not like I opened it with expectations of heart-pumping action.
Part of it was definitely as Miriam noted in her review, that of connection with the lead, a young woman who wants 'adventure.' After witnessing a man collapse on the railway, and another man claiming to be a doctor rifle through the dead man's pockets, she manages to involve herself in investigating the death.
It's got that early Katharine Hepburn feel to it.I skimmed; there's eventually African adventure, romance, and apparently espionage, which explains it.
It is really a hard life. Men will not be nice to you if you are not good-looking, and women will not be nice to you if you are.My first encounter with Agathie Christie's work was not a disappointment - although, perhaps, it is not one of her most popular books, it was certainly an enjoyable entry into this genre. Think Africa and diamonds and adventure and mystery - welcome to 'The Man in The Brown Suit'. What I liked: ✔-The fact that it was set in South Africa. Everybody's heard the famous say
✔︎-The friendships (and romance) At one point, in this book our protagonist, Anne Beddingfield, meets a new acquaintance, and their friendship slowly develops over time into true companionship.
Their relationship was, to put, a little casually, very cute, although maybe it was a bit too much at times (especially when Anne immediately fell in love, claiming she loves him and wants to spend her life with him, when she literally just let him a couple of minutes ago, but still, it was heartwarming).
This kept the book fast paced and very misleading, although Pedler was extremely sexist and sarcastic - his diary entries were interesting to read, and he was a little hilariously pathetic at times.
Before there was Miss Jane Marple and very shortly after the birth of Hercule Poirot, there was Anne Beddingfield, the plucky heroine of The Man in the Brown Suit.
Dame Agatha Christie included Hercule Poirot in 45 books and Miss Jane Marple in more than a dozen.
But Jane Beddingfield appears only in The Man in the Brown Suit (although another character in this novel, the debonair Colonel Race, went on to appear in three more).
Onboard ship, Anne gets enough excitement to satisfy anyone — including any reader lucky enough to get a hold of this book.
As always, Christie is a master of the crime/detective genre, managing to make this a fun and exciting romp without decreasing any of the mystery and sense of the sinister.
I must say I felt rather sorry for his lack of luck with Anne, but I'm looking forward to revisiting his character in the later books.
Anne, although not the most likeable heroine, is spunky and fearless, and her romance with Harry is one of the highlights of this book.
There's a little of something in it for everyone; a crime (and its solving), unique characters, a spot of romance, and an all-round adventure.
Just like most of her stories during the early 1920’s, this is more of an adventure thriller than the traditional Whodunnit that you’d associate with her.Young Anne Beddingfeld is looking for adventure, when she witnesses what seems to appear as an accidental death on the London Underground it soon leads her travelling to South Africa.I really loved the set up of this novel, it felt so familiar to many of Christie’s other novels.
My first Christie without Poirot or Marple and I still enjoyed it, much to my surprise. Anne was a feisty, independent minded protagonist. She was a bit of an insta detective though. A good range of supporting characters. It was also interesting to read about South Africa and Rhodesia: contemporary fiction at the time, and now historical fiction. You wouldn’t know that this is one of Christie’s earlier novels.
Sir Eustace Pedler, M.P.
It is a theory of mine that one always gets what one wants.”The Man in the Brown Suit, or Anna the Adventurous, was published as a serial in 1923, and is completely over the top!
Add to this a piece of paper with a cryptic clue, the smell of mothballs, and a man in a brown suit, and our Anna throws herself to the chase, leading her into ever more dangerous situation, and a trip to South Africa!!You do still get Christie’s sarcastic self through the lines, with the wicked wit shining through the descriptions and narration, but this is ultimately ‘just’ a fun adventure.
A great thriller from Christie's earlier writings. Published in 1924, it has traces of the Western world's racial bias against the Africans. The only disappointment is that published just a year after Poirot's great thriller- The Murder on the Links, Christie decided to give him a miss. However overall the pace is racy and you get a good ringside view of South African terrain.
Forget the mystery, forget the complex scheme hatched by a mysterious criminal mastermind, Agatha Christie’s ‘The Man in the Brown Suit’ is really a spoof.
Written in 1924 it has the suspense serial, the kind with feisty, flapper heroines at their centre, directly in its sights.
On witnessing a mysterious death at a tube station, she throws herself impulsively into the mystery and before long is sailing to South Africa on the trail of a mysterious criminal mastermind.
Sometimes it's easy to get distracted reading Agatha Christie. You get used to the idea that she's the creator of Poirot, of Marple, even of Tommy and Tuppence. Those characters can almost become more important than the novel itself, and when you read a Christie that doesn't have the distraction of a famous detective creation you can be surprised by just how good Christie can be. To be fair, those other novels with Poirot in are pretty good too but this one struck me that I was just enjoying  Th
You assume Colonel Race is in the clear – in part because Anne suspects him too much but mostly because he goes on to appear in a couple of later Poirots as a supporting character (although, this is Christie, even that doesn't give him a free pass) – and Mrs. Blair who seems to be having far too much fun helping Anne to be the baddy.
Anne's narrative is interspersed with extracts from Sir Eustace's diary, which is a clever idea allowing Christie to provide extra information outside of Anne's direct experience.All the characters – apart from Colonel Race – appear to be exaggerated for comedic effect.
3,3/5This was a good old Agatha Christie mystery .Her books are never my favorites but I still have all of them on my TBR. They’re too addictive
This is one of Agatha Christie's best stand alone novels - part mystery, part thriller and part espionage story - which takes us from a London tube station to revolution in Africa.
When her father dies, she takes an opportunity to go to London, where, quite by chance, she witnesses the death of a young man at a tube station.
Finding a piece of paper dropped by the 'doctor' at the scene, she believes the death to be linked to that of the murder of a young woman at the house of Sir Eustace Pedlar.
كان هذا الكتاب هدية من صديقتي :) إن كنت تحب الروايات - البوليسيه فأنصحك به وإن كنت لا تحب فـ أعطه فرصه لأجاثا كريستي أسلوب رائع في السرد :)
I really enjoyed this mystery about an orphan who takes it upon herself to solve a murder. On the way she meets the man of her dreams and has many adventures. Very well-written.
تضطر آن لتوفير احتياجات البيت، قد تخرج احيانا للهو فتشاهد مغامرت باميلا، وتثير دهشتها بطلة الفلم، المغامرة التي تسعى في كل جزء للإمساك بالمجرمين.هذا الفيلم يلهم آن عندما يموت اباها، فتقرر ان تصبح مغامرة هي الاخرى، وتذهب الى لندن.
ولكن بعد مضي ثلث الرواية تبدأ الصورة بالاتضاح ويبدأ تصفية بعض الشخصيات لانها تكون بالفعل شخص واحد.احببت جميع الشخصيات، المجرم والمغامرة و السياسي والجندي والعاشق، كل منهم ليديه ما يميزه واغاثا لم تبخل علينا في ذكر قصصهم التي قد تبدو غير مهمة ولكنها كلها تؤدي الى جريمة القطار!
This read very differently from the large majority of Christie's work - it sounded like a cross between Christie and Wodehouse. I laughed almost the entire way through, even if it was a bit too silly in parts. Loved it.
Snippets of his diary are peppered throughout the tale, and he's such an entertaining, whiny, funny character, that his dynamic really adds to the story.Another aspect that helps make this book so delightful (aside from it's great mystery, and it's main setting in Africa) is that it's one of the more romantic Christie mysteries.
I can hardly believe it was ten years ago I read this!!!***Originally Read January 2003***A great mystery filled with great characters!
I don’t identify ahead what pertains to which series, nor watch any films lest I be wholly surprised by my journey; 90 years after “The Man In The Brown Suit”, came out.
Bolstered by her keenness at filling in the blanks, she willingly follows the case aboard a ship; creating one of the most fantastic novels I have ever read.
I adored every page!Running around Africa on the strength of wild intellect, deft disguises, old and new crimes culminating, Kimberly diamonds, and even romance.
I adore Suzanne Blair as much as Anne.
With trivialities settled aboard ship; one imagines the adventuring in Africa can only be grand!
Her father has just died, she doesn't care -- fine, he didn't care for her, either -- she's staying with some near strangers who kindly took her in, she decided to investigate a murder because she thinks she can parlay it into a job with a newspaper or money to travel.
And because she doesn't care about the murder, neither do I as the reader.
Colonel Race has just appeared on the scene, don't know anything about him yet, but at this point don't care.
I certainly don't care if the protagonists gets a love interest.

Luckily for her, the villain had a soft spot for her.

Life became busy and my reading dropped off until my Kindle days started but even though I had many Christie kindle books, I only have read a handful which I enjoyed but my LOVE for her novels is back after reading "The Man in the Brown Suit"!!!
Enough of that...I loved this story from the get go and was wondering throughout what the mysteries were and how Christie would play this out.
I remember being always surprised when I was younger and being older now, she still surprised me with her twists but living life I could see somethings coming I would not think possible in my youth but still quite not sure given how it was played out or if it would go that direction.
أخيرا قرأت الرواية التي غيرت فكرتي عن أجاثا ... لم أتوقع المجرم أبداجريمة قتل لامرأة في فيلا بلندن ووفاة طبيعية لرجل في محطة القطار لكن الأسباب غامضة ..تقوم البطلة بالغوص في غمار اللغز بعد ورقة تجدها عند قتيل المحطة ..لتكشف أن الموضوع متعلق بألماس مسروق وتكون دائرة الاتهام موجهة على مجموعة من الرجال ..ثم مع الأحداث وسير الرواية تتقلص لرجلين ..في الأخير 😂😂المجرم الأكبر هو شخص لم أضعه في قائمة المتهمين اطلاقا ولم أشك فيه أبدا ..فالروائية جعلته يبدو ملاكا وديعا حتى آخر الرواية
Sin duda esta mujer sabe cómo escribir historias atrapantes que se te pasen volando; es cierto que a veces lo dejaba abandonado por unos días, pero puedo decir con certeza que, cuando lo retomaba, disfrutaba de cada página.Tengo que admitir que soy medio lela para los misterios; empezando con que no es mi género favorito ni uno que leo con frecuencia.
De todas formas, hubo un giro en particular que me dejó pirando, y por eso, una vez más, aplaudo a la Reina del Misterio.Este no fue un libro que me voló la mente ni nada por el estilo, pero lo disfruté, sobre todo los personajes y el estilo en general.
A 1924 mystery/romance by Dame Agatha Christie - who knew!?
Spunky Anne Beddingfield - the young (over age 18), unmarried daughter of a scientist - loses her father.
Finding herself "an orphan," she chooses to use her pittance of an inheritance to book a berth on a ship to South Africa in pursuit of adventure - trying to solve the mystery of the man in the brown suit.
With smarts, persistence, dumb luck, and the help/hindrance of new-found friends, Miss Beddingfield survives several attempts on her life and finds love in Rhodesia (who is, of course, handsome and wealthy).
A very cozy, unexpected, early Agatha Christie book.
Bettie's Books
Having spent the last of her money on a ticket, she's determined to solve the mystery, even if it leads her to the other side of the world.Add a bunch of hilarious characters, Eustace being my favourite, a mad romance and a revolution, and this story makes for a crazy couple of hours of reading.The book did include a few very old-fashioned thoughts on marriage, usually by a character that was everything but old-fashioned, which seemed a little strange.
It's one of the things I'm not really liking about her writing .All up, it was a fun romp though, that's probably one of my favourites of Christie's standalones so far.
