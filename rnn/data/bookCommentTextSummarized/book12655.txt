In the beginning, 2 California residents, Hatch (antique dealer) & Lindsey Harrison (artist) reminiscence the lose of their son, James(5), to cancer.They go on a trip to forget their lose.
In grief, they adopt Regina with hard acceptance by her & many to accept.Enter "Vassago", the book's monster character performing as expected - attacking & killing people, to get back his "Satan" spirit so he can go back to hell.
What could Hatch do?Typical Koontz horror book, it's a good read.
My April 2015 readHatch Harrison & Lindsey (wife) avoid a truck (Bill Cooper) going into a river killing Hatch.
Vassago did take their adopted child Regina to his "hideaway", a deserted amusement park.
4 stars🇺🇸🦋
I allowed my many library books to jump ahead of finishing Hideaway, which I own. However it's a superb book! A great mix of everyday horror with very real, average characters. As Koontz addressed at the end of the book, the good vs evil theme struck a cord in a lot of readers. I found this storyline definitely added to the reality, especially as shown through the eyes of Regina, a 12 year old orphaned girl. I recommend this book as a great thriller!
Koontz blows.
So I decided to give Hideaway a shot, and I didn't come back disappointed!Hideaway introduces us to ordinary couple Hatch and Lindsey Harrison, who one day during a storm are out driving on a highway, when they are swerved off the road by a drunk driver, resulting in their car to crash.
Now to protect his family, Hatch realizes he may be the only capable of putting Vassago down.A great storyline, great plot, great characters, and a big twist at the end which I never saw coming!
I used an audiobook by Brilliance Audio to help me through this the second and third time - at the end of that program is a fun, insightful interview with Dean Koontz.
I love the character of Regina.
I love the setting of an abandoned amusement park.
Storytellers such as Dean Koontz are a gift to the world.Some Passages:.
He remembered the bat that had swooped into the service station lights to snatch the hapless moth out of the air, eating it alive.______Dear Daddy: For a proper burial, they'll need to know where to find his nose.
For the most part, King did it consistently better--thus my reason for abandoning Koontz for pretty much the entire last decade--but Hideaway shows that that wasn't always the case.
The movie version is also worth a look, as it improves on the plot somewhat...but it totally ruins the best character of the novel by changing her from a disabled orphan girl to a very ordinary one played uninterestingly by Alicia Silverstone.
Update: August 2017 read:I just really want to add to my previous review; This time around I really enjoyed this book and what made it different for me was that I paid more attention to the ending and there were several things I liked about it.
Ήταν η πρώτη μου επαφή με τον Dean Koontz.
Το κρησφύγετο , ήταν ένα πολύ ευχάριστο ανάγνωσμα εαν είσαι φαν του συγκεκριμένου είδους.
Επ'ουδενί δεν το αποκαλείς αριστούργημα.
Ήταν αρκετά προβλέψιμο.
Κάτι σαν χολιγουντιανό θριλεράκι , που με το που βλέπεις το κάστ και το σέτινγκ μαντεύεις με την πρώτη τι μέλλει γενέσθαι.
Μόνο έχω ανάκατα συναισθήματα για το τέλος.
Δεν με ικανοποίησε ιδιαίτερα.
Έχω την αίσθηση οτι κάτι μου έλειπε.
Το τέλος του ήταν λιγουλάκι άνοστο.
Σε γενικές γραμμές, με ενδιαφέρει πολύ να ξαναπιάσω βιβλίο του συγκεκριμένου συγγραφέα και το κρησφύγετο το προτείνω σε μη δυστροπους και περίεργους αναγνώστες.
Classic, suspense-filled Dean Koontz.
As always, Mr. Koontz introduces at least one character that the reader simply falls for, and this is no exception with the funky, spirited young Regina completing a circle that has been open too long with the book's main characters, a couple that had been merely existing for many years.
A brush with death revitalizes the relationship, but also initiates a creepy, spine-tingling connection with evil.
One indication that this is an earlier novel by Mr. Koontz is the too-pat wrapping up of the intrical supporting character--the esteemed doctor, who esentially, albeit unknowingly, created the chaos.
I have found that on the surface, Dean Koontz may appear to be a shallow, mass producer of books, but as I read more of them I realize how well-developed many of his characters are.
There was a movie made of this book which I have never seen and do not plan to after reading Dean Koontz's thoughts about it.
The movie chnaged the book too much and took away the innocence of one of the key characters.
I would reccomend this book to those who like religious undertones in telling a good vs.
3.5/5 StarsI haven't dived into the horror or thriller genre much recently so I was hoping for something that would shock and amaze. I absolutely enjoyed the writing but the ending was just a bit far fetched in my mind so I didn't love it. I really wanted to spend more time in Jeremy's head, it was just so scary and fascinating when he spoke so politely with his victims. I'm sure I'll read another Koontz book in the future, might just be a while.
Was a very interesting and well thought out book. Had me hooked and wanting to find out what was happening with ever page I turned. Had I had more reading time, this is one of those books I would have polished off in a couple days. A solid read.
(In this book it was true) 3º The Evil doer is always Chaotic Evil.
If this was Dungeons and Dragons the guy was that one guy that chaotic evil characters are afraid of.
He is that evil.4º Everything ends perfectly well.
That evil guy I told you about starts dreaming as well.
So why read it?Well, I think he can be a good writer and envelops us with the tale.
The characters are made with strong and weaker aspects that are relevant to the tale.
In Koontz tales I don't fear for any of my characters.
Lindsey was another worthy character to sit inside of…how she dealt with past issues proved fascinating and it’s apparent she’s a strong individual.Vassago is one creepy guy and enough mystery is enshrouded around him to leave the reader from becoming bored.
One of Koontz’s better serial killer works, it touches upon the supernatural and leaves the readers clues so they don’t become confused, but doesn’t reveal all until the final segments.
Dean Koontz doing what he always does best.
I enjoy the style and his ability to step out beyond the lines of what you might expect.
However, I find that sometimes find that Koontz isn't quite at his best.
(Won't spoil tho)What bothered me about this book was the ending.
It's left with a sum-up of the aftermath and what they grew to be later on - but there was a hollow cynicism in that end that doesn't seem characteristic or likely in his ending.
It wasn't bittersweet.
It wasn't happy...
The end.
I left myself thinking 'oh...' Aside from that it was pretty suspenseful and filled with classic Koontz devices.
Enjoy!
But it's not his best.
This is my first dean koontz novel and i can say that I'm pretty impressed by the overall result!
It's a fast read and it has some moments of intensity (another novel by him 😆) it's completely different from the writing style of the King wich is a good thing, i though it was going to be a ripoff like some of the king novels.
Some negatives are that his writing style it has something that makes the story drag on at some parts and especially at the first 50 pages or so..
and i kind of expected more from the ending!3,5/5 ⭐️
As the author ended the book: 'Not too shabby.'A dramatic fast-paced, suspenseful story I've come to expect from Koontz.
His characters come to life in a way I can see them clearly in my mind's eye.
The doc doesn't typically know whether the people he is giving a second chance at life are good or bad.
The ordinary guy and the evil one are unfortunately linked and that link is a major part of this tale.I could hardly turn the pages fast enough while reading, and although the end is a little anti-climactic the supernatural twist makes up for it.
A really good read.
I read a lot of Dean Koontz's books when I was in high school.
His novels feature a lot of similar scenes and scenarios (frequently an evil serial killer trying to track down a protagonist who's all heart, though with a possibly tortured past, and often a friendly canine companion), and some are great, some are OK, but they're never boring."Hideaway" was the first of his that I read, when I was fourteen, and has always been my favorite.
I’d like to Dark Rivers of the Heart again too.
Dean Koontz is my favorite author and this book is my favorite one by him.
Now he has a psychic link with an evil man who murders humans so he can portray them in a scene that he thinks is befitting.One central theme in a Dean Koontz novel is good versus evil.
Actually, throughout the imagery is fantastic whether it is the antagonist's lair or the link between the two main characters.
The only flaw in this book is that characters outshine the main character.
This is an uplifting book that explores both good and evil of the supernatural world.
Hatch is an antiques store owner and his wife is an artist who are driving in icy, treacherous conditions.
Hatch is reanimated but begins to have strange dreams and visions of a serial killer that goes by the name of Vassago.
The murders start hitting Hatch a little close to home when he sees visions of his wife and their adopted daughter through the killer's eyes.The movie was very cheesy and really was not comparable to the book much.
There were a lot of similarities, but the differences were enough to make the movie less entertaining.
Hideaway continues the ongoing theme of Koontz's fiction: Good vs Evil.
And if you've read some Koontz before, you know his stance.To give the man some credit, the novel does open with a bang: a car accident that's vividly written and riveting, and almost justifies all the praise this work has received.
There are some good elements in Hideaway; Some of Koontz's descriptive pasages are eye pleasing and the beginning is riveting, but as a whole the novel is drawn out to the extreme and forgettable.
A fantastic little book. Moves at a break neck pace.There are two types of Koontz novels; chicken shit and chicken salad. 'Hideaway' is the latter and more. Five star novels are a rare gem within Koontz's bibliography; this work is a diamond among an ocean of pieces of glass.
Overview: Hatch and Lindsey Harrison have somehow survived a horrific car accident.
During the trial period of Regina’s adoption, visions and other weird happenings occur, making them wonder, did Hatch lose something during the accident?
Or perhaps he gained a gift of some sort during his recovery.Likes: The Harrisons seemed to have a good set of attitudes.
Lindsey was able to roll with the flow.
Regina was fun to be around.
And Hatch managed to avoid the personality flaws he witnessed during his youth in his own life.Dislikes: Vassago’s parts were just sad.
It was a fun read.
If you only get your books at airport gift shops, and you read mostly the likes of Janet Evanovich, John Grisham and Harlan Coban, what I would like to call the blockbuster writers, the Jason Bays and John Carpenters of the literature world.
Writers that write for the big players, that write to a certine number of rules, so that the reader is only entertained, never awestruck or enlightened.
There is something familiar and safe with authors such as Dean Koontz, which is why they are so popular.
After being dead for over 80 minutes a man is brought back by a resuscitation team. Upon being brought back he learns he has some kind of phsycic connection with a deranged killer. Feeling lost and unable to help the victims he sees in the visions, he realizes it's a two way connection and the killer is after his family. A steady paced read that brings hope, love, and meaning back into the lives of two people who had lost all hope.
I've read this book many times but now that I'm a bit older (40's), I am a bit turned off by the incredible amount of evil exposed in this book by Koontz spending so much time in the mind of the demonic villain. Koontz uses a balance formula when he creates his "good" and "bad" characters. The contrast of the extremely evil encourages me to no only side with the good guy but to empathize to much a greater degree. An interesting book but not for the weak of spirit.
He finds out that he is able to see through another person's eyes: he peers through a stranger's vision who has a secret place lurking amongst his twisted artistic creations.He feels the man's thoughts, his anger, his hatred of the living.
And Hatch and Lindsey know only the beginning of what hell this man hopes to bring upon the beings of this earth.----This was a good book!
It seemed fascinating to see a book by a writer who I haven't read but am interested in so jumping into a story I had no clue of to begin with made it extra exciting!Koontz has a great writing style.
ο παλιός καλός Koontz
Read it for a second time and just like before , I found it weak and boring.
