A James Patterson, I couldn't wait to tell the girls.
Now look at me, I was back at the library, putting it all out on the table, ready to shake things up.
I paid the fine and left with 2nd Chance.Chapter 196I met the girls at the bar to discuss the book.
Jill looked at me, took a deep breath and said, "Now listen lady, we've got to figure this out together.
That it seemed like the book version of "Charlie's Angels." But I didn't dare say anything yet; these were MY girls I couldn't disappoint them.
I sighed and took a sip of my beer.
Another excellent book from James Patterson. I am really enjoying working my way through his many books! This one is the second in his Women's Murder Club series and it was fun, easy reading. I read most of this on a train trip and its short chapters, good story, and lots of action and intrigue made it ideal reading for this purpose. This is a fun series. I really enjoy the main characters even when I have to suspend belief over their actions and just enjoy the ride.
holy crap, these are HORRIBLE books. I can't stop reading them. It's like picking a scab. Someone help me!!
"2nd Chance" by James Patterson is the second in the Women's Murder Club series.
Having read and thoroughly enjoyed the first one (1st to Die) I had high expectations for this.In the usual James Patterson style the story starts off with full on action and emotion and continues through the whole book at a fast pace, tension and twists abound with a final turn in the story I really hadn't thought of.
It looks like James Patterson has fobbed this series off on a "co-author." Disappointing.
The plot has almost exactly the same structure as "1st to Die," in the style of "We definitely have the killer!
we don't have the killer and the case is full of holes."Lt. Lindsay Boxer also suffers not one but TWO acute attacks of Lois Lane Syndrome and charges into dangerous situations with the sort of recklessness only a fictional character who obviously must survive to continue the series can afford.I'll give it another book or two, but will abandon the series if they continue in this vein.
The Women’s Murder Club is back. This time they’re after a racially motivated serial killer. Lindsay once again is proving to be at the top of her game as lead detective on the case. That is, of course, with the help and support of her close friends, Jill, Claire and Cindy. Quick, suspenseful read that I didn’t want to put down. I’m so glad I finally started this series that has been on my list for so long. Looking forward to book 3!
First, to be clear, I need to say that this review is being written for the *Audio Book format*.This is a high paced very enjoyable book with lots of drama, suspense, and plot twists.
Having said that, this is the only audio book in the series with these narrators.
From here on, books 3-10 are narrated by someone else who does a much better job and I know that it makes a tremendous difference in continuing on with the remaining audio books.
As a side note, which had nothing to do with my star rating, is that the coauthors change for books 2 & 3 in the series.
While some might view Lindsay's rash actions in chasing the killer "to the death" as heroic, she violated every standard police procedure several times: proceeding without backup, failing to call in her location, not waiting for the SWAT team, etc.
Lindsay's father, gone since childhood, shows up for some interesting sub-plot material along the way...If you like short chapters, this book's for you, as a span of two to three pages is the most we can muster.
Are our authors maybe angling for a screenplay and book all wrapped up in one?
I thought this one was really good. The killer was very unexpected.
This book is probably more of a 2.5/5 stars, but I’m rounding up because my maiden name is Patterson.
If somehow, I’m distantly related to James, I want to stay in his good graces.
😉😅Ok. I’m going to try to make this review short.
Honestly, I’m kind of disappointed.
This book overwhelmed me with an intense feeling of “meh.” I just hoped for more from the plot.
Compared to the first book, I found the conclusion to be somewhat confusing and a little far fetched.
I am going to continue with the series.
🤞🏻Here’s to (hopefully) being the only dud in the series.
I usually read James Patterson books as a guilty pleasure and quick read, interspersed between "good" reads.
I'm kind of disappointed that I did, because I'm beginning to find these books tiresome and recycled, and even sort of irritating.
I really don't consider myself a book snob, and I can usually find some enjoyment in any book I finish.
And, I did find a LITTLE enjoyment, but I'm starting to feel like these are becoming a waste of my time.
James Patterson, you have so many books out there.
I believe that common themes in an author's books tend to say a lot about who that author is deep down.
The story arc is almost identical to how the first book went down: there goes murder one, two, three and counting, then we finally had a suspect and wow we're chasing him down, we're finally getting leads after days of incompetence, the important clues are discovered by the super friends and not the police, how surprising, but the killer proves to be too illusive, then personal tragedies start to happen, and the woman has to keep her shit together and be strong, because you might forget, this is a typical novel about a woman protagonist written by a man, and there are stereotypes, so Lindsay Boxer must be the typical tough-but-weepy-in-the-inside-but-wait-no-she-really-is-tough character, her last name should've clued you in the first time around, didn't you notice?
I didn't like this book quite as much as the first in the series, mostly because the story seemed so similar. It was still fun with a quick pace and I like the characters. James Patterson can certainly write, I just didn't find this as good as the previous book.
Και πράγματι, τα θέματα είναι πολλά: επιστρέφει ο πατέρας της Λίνζι, η Σίντι βρίσκει ταίρι, η Τζιλ μένει έγκυος αλλά εξακολουθεί να δουλεύει με έντονους ρυθμούς ενώ σύντομα δύο από τα μέλη θα εμπλακούν άθελά τους στο αδυσώπητο κυνήγι του δολοφόνου.
Αυτό που δε μου άρεσε καθόλου στη Λίνζι και μου φάνηκε είτε εντελώς καινούργιο χαρακτηριστικό της είτε κάτι αταίριαστο ως προς την ψυχολογία της, ήταν η σωρεία γκαφών που έκανε στο βιβλίο.
Τρεις μήνες μετά την υπόθεση των νεονύμφων, που χάρισε στη Λίνζι τον βαθμό της υπαστυνόμου, η Γυναικεία Λέσχη Φόνων έρχεται αντιμέτωπη με ένα τέρας που δεν ορρωδεί προο ουδενός, πιστεύοντας στη δική του χίμαιρα.
Segunda entrega del Club de las mujeres contra el crimen, en el que las cuatro integrantes del club, con la teniente Lindsay Boxer a la cabeza, intentan resolver un nuevo caso.Igual que sucede en el primero, los capítulos son muy cortos, el lenguaje es sencillo, y la trama atrapa, así que se lee muy rápido y cuando te das cuenta ya has llegado al final del libro.
Once again James Patterson & Andrew Gross combine to engage the reader with another page turning thriller. Lt. Lindsey Boxer and her Women's Murder Club cohorts, Clare, Cindy and Jill are drawn together to solve a case involving a sharp shooter who's terrorizing the city. The twists & complications in this case are typical Patterson intrigue but with a fascinatingly surprise conclusion. Anyone who has enjoyed this series will find this as worthy as the previous installments.
The second outing of the Women's Murder Club is a satisfying mystery with a decent number of twists and turns.
While the Club seems to be bonding every more tightly, they didn't have all that much to do in this story, compared to the last one.
The women are positive, strong female characters, but there are moments, just moments, when I feel that the writer is not a woman.
Yet the legal eagle states that there's absolutely nothing that ties him into the murders and no way to get at him.
Then they could build their case without worrying about him committing another murder.
5 starsAnother very good book. Really enjoying this series. RIP Chief Mercer. Cool that Lindsay Boxer became a Lieutenant. Nice to see the Women's Murder Club again. Glad we got to see Marty Boxer for a little bit. Case was weird and somewhat scary. Poor people who died. Hope Cindy and Aaron Winslow will stay together for a long time.Can't wait to read 3rd Degree!!!!
This is only my 2nd book by Patterson, but I am now a huge fan. I usually don't LOL when reading books. It takes a lot for me to get to that point, but I did towards the end. Not to mention, I just couldn't put it down. I think Patterson knows what he is doing by having such short chapters. It makes it so much easier to continue reading the book.
15 years ago I read this book for the first time.
I remember giving this book a high rating.
Now, so many years later, I still think it's a better story than book 1.
The motivation behind the killing spree is more rooted in a credible vendetta; and it's more than just a random psycho-killer on the loose.
When one of the victims is the African-American chief of police, Earl Mercer, the homicide team become more certain that the killings are related to the SFPD.
I feel like we haven't scraped the surface.***3,5 rating***
3.5 stars
And so starts the hunt for Chimera, the serial killers nom de guerre.As more victims fall to the city's newest monster, it quickly becomes clear that he is tied to the dark history of the police department, in particular, that of a local cop who killed a young man with questionable ties to drugs 20 years previously.History also starts to play a role in Lindsay's personal life, when her father pops up out of the blue after being missing since she was 13 years old.
After choir practice as the children are leaving, a gunman open fires on them, killing a young black girl and Lindsay investigates.
It seems like a random act until Cindy, Lindsay's friend and another member of the Women's Murder Club, tells Lindsay that the hanging of an older black woman and the killing of the girl may be related.
one hits its mark killing the person and other just misses.As Lindsay continues the investigation, she has to deal to some of the most hardened criminals to get to the bottom of what's going on.
James Patterson's second installment of his Women's Murder Club series is a fast pased but ultimately unsatisfying read.
The Women's Murder Club seems to have everything that could possibly go wrong happen to them--apparently Patterson has decided that at least one of them must suffer a major medical ailment per novel.
Patterson pushes a red herring for several pages only to pull a culprit out of left field to finish the book on a rather unsatisfying note.I've read both of the books in this series and have been, quite frankly, underwhelmed.
2nd Chance reconvenes the Women's Murder Club, four friends (a detective, a reporter, an assistant district attorney, and a medical examiner) who used their networking skills, feminine intuition, and professional wiles to solve a baffling series of murders in 1st to Die. This time, the murders of two African Americans, a little girl and an old woman, bear all the signs of a serial killer for Lindsay Boxer, newly promoted to lieutenant of San Francisco's homicide squad.
The sensational killings that have rocked San Francisco appear to be unrelated except in their brutality.
She calls her friends in the Women's Murder Club together to see if they can discover what it is.
Working with Chronicle reporter Cindy Thomas, Assistant District Attorney Jill Bernhardt, and medical examiner Claire Washburn, Lindsay discovers that there is indeed a link.
The victims were of different ages, lived in different locations, and were killed with different weapons.
The partners in the Women's Murder Club realize that this killer is after something unspeakable, something deeper than revenge, and that the next target could be one of them.
SPOILER: In the first book she continuously confesses her love for her group of friends.
In this book she continuously confesses her love for her group of friends.
In the first book she exerts all her energy on the suspect just to find out in the end he is not the killer, in this book she exerts all her energy on the suspect just to find out in the end he is not the killer.
In both books the actual killers are related to the original suspect and were doing the killings for them/in their honor!
Wonder what the 3rd book in the series is about...(sarcasm).
I'm all for the 'unconventional' way of doing some things, but having a murder club consist of 4 women just doesn't appeal to me. However, I'm reading this series because it IS so unconventional. Getting to know these women is fun. Each with their own problems, they also show strength with each other and if it works, then go for it. More to follow.
LOVE The Women's Murder Club Series! Even more every time I reread them.
excellent read!!! Alot of suspense!!! just when you thought it was solved it actually isnt!! love this series!!!
