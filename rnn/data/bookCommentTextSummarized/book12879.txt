This is most unusual for me, I’m sure some of you may have noticed how quickly I can get through books.I started reading the Sandman almost a year ago now, and I’ve only just finished the third volume.
She’s certainly the most beautiful depiction of death I’ve ever seen…….(stares silently into the distance) Final thoughts  So this was another solid entry into the Sandman series, though it could never be quite as good as the rest when it doesn’t tell a sustained story, allowing the drama and tension to build up through the issues, it was still very enjoyable though.
The Twilight Zone comes into The Dreaming. Creative Team:Writer: Neil GaimanIllustrators: Kelly Jones, Malcolm Jones III, Colleen Doran & Charles VessLetterer: Todd KleinCovers: Dave McKean MUSES, CATS, PLAYWRIGHTS & ELEMENTS This is a wonderful volumen in the The Sandman run where the great storyteller, Neil Gaiman, unleashes his imagination to the fullest giving us the pleasure of reading four stories where anything can happen...CALLIOPE You have changed, Oneiros. In the old days, you
Morpheus, the embodiment of Dream, has many names, and Oneiros is one of those who used at some point, for some purpose.It’s certain that the topic of a failed writer capturing a muse (a real one, from the Greek mythology) to be able to write again successful novels is something used here and there, but Neil Gaiman gives us here, this theme with a wonderful past relationship between Morpheus and Calliope, the muse of this tale.
Mm. I wonder what cats have to dream about?
“A Midsummer Night’s Dream” tells us about a special performance of this play, on an isolated rural hill, by Shakespeare’s own company, arranged by Lord Dream himself.
Gaiman shows his command of the form too, using it—as his master Shakespeare did—not only as meta-fictional commentary, but also as metaphysical meditation.“A Midsummer Night’s Dream” is quintessential Gaiman, and makes Sandman 3 a worthy entry in the series.
Note: This is part two of a rambling multi-volume re-read of the series.
Midsummer's is my favorite of Shakespeare's plays, I should mention.
You can make Shakespeare a character in a comic?
This time when I read it, I thought to myself.
"We have a play with a play in it."Then I thought: "No, people are *watching* a play with a play in it.
Then I thought, "No. I am *reading* a book about people watching a play with a play in it.
And the play is about the people watching it.
I can honestly see why so many of you love it, but...I can't force myself to do this any longer!I don't like the art.
The difference is, the artist isn't one of my kids, so I don't feel the need to put this up on my refrigerator.
Sorry, I know a lot of you love this style.There are few different stories in this one, and I didn't like any of them.First one is about a writer who rapes a muse over and over again for inspiration.
This is a fairly short volume, but each story is tight and delightful.
A cat's dreaming of a new and free world.
You want ideas?
I'll give you ideas...
:) The cat's dream was of overturning the rule of man, while remembering that cats once DID rule man, but man dreamt of a new world with more of it's kind and changed the nature of reality.
Can't cats bring themselves to reverse reality in the same way?
It brings a whole new spin on the adage, "To herd cats."But it was the story about the Shakespearian production that takes the cake.
All right...starting to feel it now. I'm digging it. Let's keep this Dream train rolling, Gaiman. Onto Vol. 4.
Here we participate in the first performance of the famous play, held in a meadow for the Lords and Ladies of Fairyland.20 - Facade is the closest Gaiman comes to a classic superhero origin story, puting a dark twist on the saviour of the world mythos, showing the alienation and the psychological pressure of being a 'freak' in the eyes of the normal people.I hope I will meet some of these characters in later issues.
Even if they prove to be one-night-stands, their stories have depth and showcase the themes I am becoming already familiar with : the alternative history, the deconstruction of the superhero character, the use of mythical creatures in a contemporary environment.
What I remember of Sandman was that the first two volumes weren’t that great (and that checks out) but that the series starts to take off in this third volume, Dream Country, and… it doesn’t.
Unlike the last two books which were lengthy narratives, Dream Country is a series of four thematically linked short stories with Dream and Death making cameos but not taking centre stage.
It’s also the first time we see Morpheus live up to his name, shape-shifting from his human-ish form into a Dream cat, showing that he is Dream for all beings, not just humans.The World Fantasy Award-winning A Midsummer Night’s Dream is the third and best story of the book.
Calliope was fantastic, as was A Dream of a Thousand Cats. Full review to come!
In Calliope, a man discovers and abuses his muse and in Facade we learn a lot about the faces we wear and the sister of Morpheus, Death, plays a role.
If Death doesn't know, who does?The second story, A Dream of a Thousand Cats was unique, but also brought with it the theme that Gaiman brings up in American Gods-how much do our beliefs shape the world around us?
At the end of this volume, a script of Calliope was included-which was a cool peek behind how Neil Gaiman and the artists put an issue together.
Τρίτος τόμος και ήταν σχετικά με τα 2 προηγούμενα λίγο πιο αδύναμος. Σε αντίθεση με τα άλλα δύο αυτό δεν έχει μια μονοκόμματη υπόθεση αλλά 4 αυτόνομες μικρότερες ιστορίες (σαν συλλογή διηγημάτων ένα πράγμα) με κοινό παρονομαστή τους Endless, τρεις τον Morpheus(περίπου) και μια την Death, η οποία σε κάθε της εμφάνιση είναι απολαυστική! Γενικά την είχε την πλάκα του!
I only really liked one issue and that was the one dealing with Death and the woman who was not a woman, Rainie.
"Calliope" was a great story and we find out more about this Muse and her relationship with Dream.
I liked the idea of Dream having a son though what was being done to Calliope all in the name of writing was terrible.
"A Dream of a Thousand Cats" I think my cat would enjoy this story.
It was an interesting idea that I will admit to being slightly bored a bit."Facade" so I had to look up the character of Rainie since I had no idea who the heck she was and what her deal was either.
3.0 stars. A good collection of four unconnected solo stories. I did not like this volume as much as Volumes 1 and 2 but it is still worth reading. My favorite story is probably "A Midsummer Night's Dream" followed closely by "A Dream of A Thousand Cats." The former story is the only comic book to ever win the World Fantasy Award for Best Short Story.
Açık konuşmak gerekirse sabırsızlıkla beklediğim üçüncü cilt önceki iki ciltin yanında sönük kaldı, içerik olarak beni doyurmadı. Tabii ki yine de Neil Gaiman ve usta çizerlerin işi.
'...sonra uyanıyorum, kendimle yüzleşiyorum.Ve hala buradayım....bu gerçekten korkunç.'Kısa kısa, bağlantısız hikayelerden oluşuyor. En sonuncusu favorim. Bu kadar fantastik olup da bu kadar karamsar olmayı herkes başaramaz. Çok, çok sevdim.
Every time I read a volume of Sandman, I desperately hope I'll love it.
Then I get a sinking feeling as I read and find myself bored and unimpressed, and I start to fear that someone is going to show up at my door and revoke my nerd card.
I...do not adore this series.It seemed like it took me ages to get through the Midsummer Night's Dream section of this book in particular--I was bored out of my mind.
I've given it several tries, and I just don't like it.Please don't take my nerd card away.

Another one I really liked was A Midsummer Night’s Dream, with me being a fan of Shakespeare, I immediately recognised a lot of the characters and loved the new representation of them.⚜️Although each story is separate from one another, they do share the overall theme of imprisonment and, of course, of dreams.

The Sandman, Vol 3: Dream Country: Four excellent stand-alone storiesVol 3 features four stand-alone stories in the Sandman universe, “Calliope”, “A Dream of a Thousand Cats”, “A Midsummer Night’s Dream”, and “Facade”.
What sacrifices must a writer make to come up with a steady flow of stories to remain successful?
It’s wonderful to see how Gaiman carefully staged the beginnings of this story earlier without revealing what was to come.
Just as in Calliope, the theme of the artist and what he must sacrifice to produce great works is explored, with an unexpectedly personal touch at the end.“Facade” is strange and ghastly story, quite different from the first three.
My only slight complaint is that we still have a lot to learn about Sandman and his world, but I think this volume (although not fabulous at teaching us a lot more) hinted at much more to come.I would say that these books are thought-provoking and magical more than many other Graphic Novels or comics I have read.
The imagination of Gaiman is a weird and wonderful place, and the Sandman graphic novels give you a small glimpse inside.On the whole a fairly cohesive and wonderfully imagined set of stories and I look forward to returning to the Sandman world as the series goes on.
Strangely enough this was my favourite volume so far, though it was disconnected from the rest of the storylines.
We meet the mother of Morpheus's son, and find out what cats dream about.
(The latter issue, number 19, is the only comic book ever to have won a World Fantasy Award.) Death has her own bittersweet story, as she attempts to help out an agoraphobic ex-superhero."The cats were my favourite of all the stories thus far.
Maybe I just like cats though.
Death is also a favourite character so it was nice to see more of her.
Wow. I'm glad I started reading The Sandman again.Dream Country is the shortest of the series (I believe), comprised of four short stories.
And it worked.Gaiman again show his skill at immediately dropping you into a story, and most importantly: making you care.
Gaiman's comments to the artist and hilarious and insightful, and I can easily say that it has forever changed my appreciation of these works of fiction.But who cares what I have to say?
Go check out Tim Callahan's re-read on Tor.com, since he has graphic novel wisdom that far surpasses my own.
Four stories which reveal how human desires for fantasy go a bit awry in the world of the Endless. Wait. Maybe it's the other way around.....I loved two stories very much: A Midsummer Night's Dream, and A Dream of a Thousand Cats. The tale of the writers and the Muse is horrible. The Element girl fable was meh.Still, altogether, if you can, buy the entire Sandman comic series. It is horrible and excellent.
Gaiman's The Sandman Vol. 3 "Dream Country" is more or less a collection of short stories that are related to the the series, but unrelated in terms of the main storyline that's been going on in the first two volumes.
I hate when good storylines like that in "The Doll's House (Vol. 2)" get cut off with something unrelated like this book, but this tangent was good.
Dream Country is smart, creepy, complex, moving, and like all Gaiman I have read thus far, very well-imagined.
Se trata de un volumen intermedio entre arcos, desconectado casi por completo de la trama principal, que nos arrastra por cuatro historias de origen independiente y con nuevos dibujantes.
Para que prueben el universo de Sandman sin meterse en la serie regular.Me encanta Calíope (una historia sobre una musa secuestrada) y la esplendida Un sueño de mil gatos (donde un líder gatuno intenta que los gatos cambien el mundo soñando).
No conecto tanto con la premiada El sueño de una noche de verano, donde Gaiman une el mundo de Shakespeare con el suyo.
A Midsummer's Night Dream <3
“Writers are liars my dear, surely you know that by now?..”This month I continued with my graphic novel read with Neil Gaiman’s Sandman series of Volume 3 Dream Country.
The second is “A Dream Of A Thousand Cats” where several of them meet in a graveyard to be told stories by a wise old cat of dreams of how they came to be in the order of life.
The third is a play of “A Midsummer’s Night Dream” which is set on top of a hill arranged my Morpheus with an audience from Shakespeare’s actual dream creations.
This is so interesting to read to see how it came to life.
