Interview with JK Rowling... Stephen Fry: Can we settle an important question?JK Rowling: Yes.Stephen Fry: How do you pronounce your last name?JK Rowling: It is Row-ling. As in rolling pin.Stephen Fry: So if any of you hear someone pronounce her name “Rohw-ling”, you have my permission to hit them over the head with — not with Order of the Phoenix, that would be cruel. Something smaller, like a fridge.
I finished this book with tears in my eyes and laughter on my lips.Just wow, excellent book!
It only took me 7 months, but at least i've FINALLY finished the damn book! Video Review:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzB8h...
(obviously a reread) *cries*
I had to re read it. I was in such a nostalgic mood.
Sure, there were some tough parts earlier on, and while it's true that some darkness crept into the ending of the previous installment, for the most part, that was a pretty happy book compared to this.
Where you expect Harry to be in the know, he’s in the dark, where you expect The Daily Prophet to be filled with stories about the ministry pursuing Voldemort, there’s only silence, where you expect excitement about returning to Hogwarts there is only frustration and angst.
J.K. Rowling really starts taking the series down a darker road in this book.
She is so talented at character development, and it really shines in this book.
Here, Harry is 15 years old, and for most of the book, he's whiny and self-centered, just like a typical teenager.
For me, this book was stronger for character development than plot.
Yes, this is a key book for the series, but I felt like most of the book was spent with characters' internal issues and development rather than the plot.
I love how Harry and the crew are dealing with more adult issues now, such as relationships and death.
“Is it true that you shouted at Professor Umbridge?""Yes.""You called her a liar?""Yes.""You told her He Who Must Not Be Named is back?""Yes.""Have a biscuit, Potter.”This is my favourite book in my favourite series of all time.
It's also the book that introduces us to my most hated fictional character ever.
Never have I hated anyone as much as Umbrige.

I love angsty Harry and all of the crazy drama that this book contains.
Here, we get to see Neville's parents, as well as Gilderoy Lockhart (who is adorable now and not at all annoying), and I WISH THAT WAS IN THE MOVIES.-it sucks that Harry was banned from playing Quidditch this year, as I LOVE Quidditch.
If you ever think that Neville isn't brave until the last book, you are wrong.
This particular book reveals A LOT of stuff that most people were probably wondering about whilst reading the other four books, as well as information that you probably didn't even think of.
(A) 86% | ExtraordinaryNotes: It’s a transitional book, which holds back its potential, but it adds greatly to its mythos with excellent new characters.
Finished this one last week and forgot to mark, but I loved it.
I ended up taking a massive break for several months because I'm such a mood reader but I really have always loved this one.
And I was really happy to get to revisit the scene where Harry talks to Nearly Headless Nick about why some wizards become ghosts and why most don't.
I always wanted that scene in the movie, but it's beautifully done in the book.
Also loved the extensive conversation between Harry and Dumbledore, which was also reasonably shortened in the film.
Dear Dolores Umbridge, (view spoiler)[R.I.P. Sirius Black. Best friend, godfather, member of the Order. The injustice of it all hurts me every time I read this book. You will never be forgotten. <3 (hide spoiler)]["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>
I know the feeling dear, Harry! 🙁Happy Potter Reading! Mel 🖤🐾🐺
This book used to be my least favorite book of the series and after rereading it, I can't understand why... I loved it!So many good things I had forgotten started here like the DA meetings. I still absolutely hate Umbridge and I'm out of my reading slump (hopefully!).
Despite this being the longest book in the series, I read it quicker than all the others.
And this scene was perhaps the most powerfully written in the series for me, we all know what happens next: 2.
3. Luna Lovegood- because the weird people are always the best people.
Luna’s by far my favourite character because she is so completely herself in all her colourfulness; she’s often ignored, avoided and even ridiculed as a result but secretly she is brilliant.
The world needs more Luna Lovegoods.
I always thought she had far more chemistry with Harry than Ginny ever did.
SO many feels!!!I really love this book. The plot and world gets so complex, and I'm very happy to get answers and explanations at the end!This one was a crazy, scary, and ... frustrating.. (Umbridge) ride, but still so fun.
❝Things we lose have a way of coming back to us in the end, if not always in the way we expect.❞  Rating: ★ ★ ★ I feel like I'm going to get attacked for only rating a Harry Potter book 3.75 stars but Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is probably my LEAST favorite of the series thus far.
It went by so slow and I felt like too much went on but at the same time nothing really happened.
This book could've easily been made at least 200 pages shorter if J.K. Rowling got rid of all the point
Rating: ★ ★ ★ ¾I feel like I'm going to get attacked for only rating a Harry Potter book 3.75 stars but Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is probably my LEAST favorite of the series thus far.
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix will probably always be my least favorite book and movie in the series, but the worst Harry Potter book is still a whole league better than a lot of other books.
Full review and other non-spoilery reviews can be found @The Book Prescription* On a scale from one to ten, how obsessed with Harry Potter are you?me: about 9¾
I know it's not fair to compare, but because the film version of Order of the Phoenix isn't one of my favorites, coupled with the fact that this is the longest novel in the series, I was really nervous to get to this one.
Obviously I was a muggle fool who deserves to be chased around by Peeves for a full 24 hours, because this was such a vital installment that really breathed a mature life into the series.
What a brilliant, hauntingly beautiful way to write a series that grows as the reader does.
English (Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix) / Italiano«The hottest day of the summer so far was drawing to a close and a drowsy silence lay over the large, square houses of Privet Drive.

Angsty Harry is seriously one of the greatest teens ever written.
*collapses in a puddle* Peoples, I usually read a book in a day, two days if it's big, three if it's super huge.
And while there are 2 dozen things I love about these books, THAT is what makes me wait, like 9 million years between picking up volumes.
Another = injustice for no reason.OKAAAAY BUT YOU GUYS PROBABLY THINK I HATE HARRY POTTER NOW AND IT'S NOT TRUE.I also have a list of things I freaking loved.
I'd like to try audios one day...) because she's smart and into equality and rights and I just love her, yes okay?!+...oh and McGongall.
I still can't believe my sixth grade self devoured all 870 pages in two sittings. Only you Jo, only you.
Hello, I think this is my favourite book in the entire series, but also I barely remember what happened because I read most of this over three days while on vacation.
All I recall is my parents yelling at me to do something other than read, all that good Sirius, Neville and Ginny content (my three faves), that terribly wonderful frustration that existed every time Umbridge spoke and the introduction of Luna Lovegood.
*tagging this bc no one tags HP spoilers and it's hurt me one too many times, but you know what happened...
we all know what happened.*(view spoiler)[ My biggest and only problem with this book was and continues to be Sirius' death.

Umbridge? More like Umbitch.That woman deserves to die. Painfully.
It is saved only by the virtue that it is a Harry Potter book and moves the series along to the still yet unknown finale.My issues with it:- deals with complex social/political problems in a simplified, extreme, and dichotomous manner- characterisations are too easy/lazy- all good or all bad (with the exception of Snape who's good/evil intentions are yet unknown), all courageous or cowardly, the righteous or the corrupt.
- the laudable themes of power/corruption/propaganda/censorship are played out with such naive characterisations, extreme situations and melodramaticism that it results in inflammatory knee-jerk reactions rather than furthering understanding of the subleties of these ideas.
The story that gets told helps to establish and develop so many things - no book of the series has been a filler so far!
Despite the book being so long (my copy has 800 pages), no line is boring or unnecessary.
These characters are just normal teenagers with normal conflicts and fights, and I'm so happy that (besides all the fantastical elements) these ordinary things find a place in the story as well.
This makes this adventure so much more special, because you truly see these characters grow up and learn!
6/11/2013I know that I have neglected the subject of the new Goodreads policy a lot recently, and I ought not to have done that.
And well for someone (me), who has suffered a lot because of that (Facebook only made my freedom of speech more restricted), I found a haven for myself in Goodreads, where apparently no one gives a damn whether you insult or disagree with them because well, they don’t care.
You can remove all the reviews you want, Goodreads, but this is something I believe in.
