2.5*Only 2 of the stories involved Dr. Thorndyke (The Missing Mortgagee & Percival Bland's Proxy) which was a disappointment. Of the others, one was more of a ghost story than a mystery (The Attorney's Conscience) and another implied supernatural effects (The Bronze Parrot). The Great Portrait Mystery was the best of the non-Thorndyke stories.
So, there was more than one story contained in this delightful book. The first story, "The Great Portrait Mystery", was very fun to read! "The Bronze Parrot" was such a weird story, but definitely amusing. "Powder Blue and Hawthorn" was a gruesome and harrowing tale, although somewhat satisfying too. I felt positively shocked! "The Attorney's Conscience" was an interesting ghostly read. I loved it. "The Luck of Barnabas Mudge" was humorous and satisfying. I can only say, "what a lucky man he was!"
Even though this is a Thorndyke book, he only appears briefly in two of the stories. The stories in themselves are strange and the novels seem to be consistently better than the short story collections.
A delightful read. Charming characters, missing treasure, happy ending. A trifecta.
