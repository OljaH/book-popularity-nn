ALL THE STARS RIGHT HERE.Can we all just slow clap for this? AND THIS BOOK. NO WORDS RIGHT NOW. I just.. My thoughts have yet to make sense. So for now, all you have to know is that Evolution is a fantastic book that will most likely be the source of my nightmares and paranoia for the next few days.GO PRE-ORDER NOW!

I just ordered mine :)***********updated FULL review***********I wasn't sure how it could be possible, but The Evolution of Mara Dyer was even more intese and twisted than The Unbecoming.Before reading: Huh, my book is signed with, "Who will you believe?" Interesting.
Day 5: Has brother stand next to me while I brush my teeth.One of the many things I loved about this book was Mara Dyer and Noah Shaw.
Even though Mara Dyer is the reason I can't look into the mirror after I take a shower, I will read anything by Michelle Hodkin.
“Tell me what you see. Because I don't know what's real and what isn't or what's new or different and I can't trust myself, but I trust you.”  I am confused. And scared terrified. I am angry. I am freaked out. I am unconditionally and irrevocably in love with this series. And it hurts.  “You will love him to ruins.”  When a book starts with this line, you know that things are going to get ugly. In The Evolution of Mara Dyer Mara's family is seriously concerned about her mental state and decide
The thing is, Mara is not crazy but pretends to acknowledge that she is crazy in order to stay out of mental institutions, but she's afraid that she will lose her sanity if she doesn't get answers.
That's what The Evolution of Mara Dyer did to me.
Michelle Hodkin found her way into my brain and into my heart, and I am scared of what she'll do with that power.
This arrogant, dedicated and broken boy was the only source of light in Mara's life, his love the only stable thing in a world that was falling apart.
If I had to pick two words to describe this book, I'd say: Hot. And freaky.Really, I would recommend this series to anyone who likes the intensity.
Mara and Noah are as spirited as ever, and I loved Mara's family, as usual (the mother is exempt.)A word of warning: The cliffhanger is even worse than The Unbecoming.
But what did I expect, when The Evolution was so much more intense, so much scarier, so much more sick and beautiful and gut-wrenching?*Thanks to Simon and Schuster for the ARC.
Mara's drugs could make her loose her memory of certain events.Lost time, anyone?Pyscho therapist Dr. Kells repressing certain memories, perhaps?Look who's not as crazy as we thought she was.So, (view spoiler)[ at the end the crazy Dr. Kells tells Mara, 'Noah's Dead.' Well, I was like bullshit!
(hide spoiler)]Also, upon re-reading the Evolution, I have (view spoiler)[ discovered Jamie's powers.
He realizes that he may have been responsible for her death Example 3: When Jude is torturing him, Jamie tells him to let go - and Jude lets go.
VERY TWISTY PLOT. SUCH TWISTED CHARACTERS.WOW
I just finished the book and I’m totally freaking out and silently screaming obscene phrases at the air because man, that twist, that ending (or the lack of it), as picked up from the book, is batshit crazy.
I’m not sure whether to be impressed or upset by the revelations and I guess that’s when you can say a book is really good- when it totally messes up with your head.
She starts seeing, hearing and feeling weird things which her family and doctors dismiss as simply symptoms of PTSD.
255 and I want to list out a few things I wish Michelle Hodkin would write in the remaining part of The Evolution of Mara Dyer:(1) Mara is in fact crazy.(2) Jude, Mara's ex-boyfriend and would-be-rapist, is in fact dead.(3)Whenever Mara thinks she's seeing Jude, it's only her seeing her imaginary stalker.(4) Every single spooky event that has taken place in the book is either Mara's own handiwork or they taken place only in her head.(5) Mara goes all psycho-bitch and kills Noah, her boyfriend.(6) Mara goes all psycho-bitch and kills her family members.If any of these things really take place, it would definitely make my day!NOTE: I did a buddy read with Alice when reading this book.Rating: it's a 'I can't give a flying fuck to a book which keeps refusing to make sense' negative stars.Since there's no such thing as negative stars in the GR rating system, I had to make do with one star.Supposedly I should feel sorry for Mara Dyer, because our Super Special Lovely Snowflake Heroine is being wrongly accused of being insane.
This book was BANANAS!!
-_-• Also while I ship Noah and Mara like nothing else (because they are cute and needful)...their romance almost felt too old?
It's not graphically or sexual or anything, don't get me wrong -- but it doesn't feel like a TEEN romance.• Jamie's potential is STILL wasted, dangit.• There is a huge "AFJDKSLAFDJ WUT WUT NO NO" moment at the end, but because the book is like 95% "is this real or not real"...I didn't get thumped by the plot twist.
TOO FREAKING LONG, I SAY.....Okay, but you know what?!
I'm so proud of her!.Every part of his story from his search for truth, what is real and what is not, all that mystery, even as it struggles to appear normal trying to ignore what happens is so brave, it really is a book that plays with your mind and that makes it very difficult to leaveNoah is still one of my greatest literary love of all time !!!!!!And it remains a character no waste ;)“If I were to live a thousand years, I would belong to you for all of them.
That notion where, "hey, what good is life anyway if I'm not reading this very book in this very moment?" That moment when you build up this elaborate hypothesis in your brain and you're all, "I KNOW how this should end, why doesn't the author just let me take the reins from here on out, mmkay thanks," but then you're introduced to a conclusion (or cliffhanger, such is the case) that rattles every molecule of your being to the point where you're going to lose your shiz for the next 365+ days until you get that soul-slaying conclusion to one of those most enthralling, possessing series that you've ever read in your 27 years of life?Yeah, this book has those things.If you were left scrambled after The Unbecoming of Mara Dyer, I have good news for you.
Reading this story was akin to playing a mind game Half the time I was trying to figure out who to believe, what the truth really was, and the other half, I was questioning everything I thought.Unlike many YA books, Evolution really included Mara's family into what was going on.
It definitely made me wish I had an older brother like Daniel.My favorite part of this book, though, was seeing more of Mara and Noah's relationship.
In Evolution, it feels like Michelle Hodkin is finally letting you in on the big secret....
4.5 starsI found this one to be a bit slow at times but it did definitely deliver as far as the creepy twisted plot. I love trying to figure out what's going on. Also really love all the characters but sometimes I just got so frustrated wanting people to believe Mara!!!
NO. NO NO NO. NO.
“I’m afraid– I’m afraid I’m losing control.” I’m afraid I’m losing myself. The idea was a splinter in my mind. Always there, always stinging, even when I wasn’t conscious of it. Even when I wasn’t thinking about it.   What did I just read? My emotions are all over the place. Just when I thought I was getting answers, Michelle Hodkin slams me over the head with some grade A mindf*ckery. But who the hell am I fooling? I loved every second of it.  *All spoilers tagged  *  Mara Dyer once believed
Mara Dyer once believed she could run from her past.She can’t.She used to think her problems were all in her head.They aren’t.She couldn’t imagine that after everything she’s been through, the boy she loves would still be keeping secrets.She’s wrong.In this gripping sequel to The Unbecoming of Mara Dyer, the truth evolves and choices prove deadly.
(hide spoiler)] Mara doesn't know what or who she can trust and how she can keep everyone safe from herself.
When people have told you you're crazy so many times that you, slowly, begin to believe it yourself.
After being hugely disappointed with the way the first book turned from fabulously creepy to annoyingly romancy, I did not hold very high hopes for its sequel--even though I was (obviously) curious enough by the ending to still be looking forward to it.
It's still largely present, but, surprisingly, I even enjoyed that part!The romance in the first book completely threw me off.
Not only did I not remember why I didn't like Noah at first--which I'm sure helped a ton--it is kept a part of the plot, not squashing it.
Another disappointment in the first Mara was the whole non-answer to her "power".
I really wasn't expecting this to be better than the first book!! The action was perfect, the romance great, the side characters amazing, the plot twists perfectly done.I think the first book was just a little too slow for me, not enough of the paranormal aspect...but now I feel it was appropriate because we needed the intro and back story...but everything about book 2 was just amazing and captivating.
Y'ALL WHAT A FUCKING PAGE-TURNER I CAN'T BREATHE
“I’ll walk forever with stories inside me that the people I love the most can never hear.” O.M.G.I meanTHIS BOOK IS AWESOME!I can't even start putting into words my feelings at the moment I finished this book. This woman was able to mess with my mind. It made me surprised, confused, angry, sad, amused... I DON'T KNOW!!!Basically this girl cannot have a single day in peace. Even when she tries to tell the true that is taking her sleep away, nobody believes her. Not even I believed her. I have to
And that whenever she’s not home, I feel like I’m missing my partner in crime.
I wish Mara knew that I never minded, because she’s my favorite too.”
And I still hate how he makes Mara feels so insecure and all Mary Sue. But still, he is really helpful to the story and I couldn't resist to his charm.
And even though it's starting to be a cliche to have THE different character to get the readers to be amused about how authors are giving attention to others than blue-eyes-blondes, I still loved Jamie.
A little tally to begin:Number of times I screamed “W.T.F!!???” out loud - 96Number of times I was actually scared to leave my room because of all the creepy things happening – 8 Number of times I had to put my kindle down and just stare at the wall to fully digest WTF had just happened – 11Number of times I wished I was 17 because I was SWOONING HARD OVER NOAH FREAKING SHAW- 3,857,892,357How a book can make me afraid to leave the safety of my bed and needing to turn the lights on to do so in one chapter then have me drooling over a 17 year old in the next is beyond comprehension.
Final rating: 3.5/5 stars  This was the boy I loved. A little bit messy. A little bit ruined. A beautiful disaster.Just like me.    The last 20% were so worthy of 3.5 STARS. I don't know if it is a standard for Michelle Hodkin or if i always get bored until i reach 70% of the book? Because it is the deal with me and Mara Dyer series. But, this time, i got some answers. But! I got confused as hell! And i loved that! Can you imagine? I actually loved this book. More than the first one anyway.Now t
I won't reveal much about the story, since i don't know how i would write the synopsis but it was creepier, weirder and definitely better than The Unbecoming of Mara Dyer.
I’m in love with you, Mara.
The best way to describe Mara in this book would be obsession: obsessed about Noah, obsessed about her feelings, obsessed with her fears, obsessed with everything that has ever happened to her.
The thing about Noah is that he is way to secretive.
But this series has interesting story, it was just not so well executed but who knows what will third book give us?
There are, of course, other faults in the novel, such as the fact that I found it to be way too long drawn out in the second half and that it ends in yet another cop-out of a cliffhanger to stretch out the series when everything could have easily been resolved in this book, but I think the 'in-your-face' creepy scenes may have been the most prominent and effective detraction to my enjoyment in The Evolution of Mara Dyer.
The cliffhanger at the end of The Unbecoming of Mara Dyer left me with a feeling hope that the series would eventually become awesome over time, and more importantly it made me care for what would happen next.
Beautiful Mara Amitra Dyer Noah  Elliot Simon Shaw.
Whoa, all the stars in the sky for this book 🖤🌌The entire story was stunning, heart wrenching, captivating, unique, beautiful and I kinda ran outta words..
Mara and Noah are fascinating and their whole relationship is perfectly imperfect.
A little bit messy.
A little bit ruined.
A beautiful disaster.
Their story is unique and different.
"Noah started this chase and I stood before him, waiting to be caught.
He was waiting for me to chase him." The plot twists and mind games were just unreal, which made this book almost impossible to set down.
WHAT. A. TRIP.you guys. what even was this book!?!?!?!?? lets just forget about mara and her issues for a hot minute. i feel like its me who needs to check into a facility because i have no idea what is fact and what is fiction anymore after reading this. i honestly dont know what to do with myself at this point.  4 stars
OH MY FREAKING- WHY DO YOU LEAVE ME HANGING LIKE THAT, WHY!? I just *sigh*.... Can it be October already, please?
THE SCIENTIFIC THEORY: aka I’ve scoured the net, and yet none have mentioned the following theory pertaining to The Retribution of Mara Dyer  (edited to include A Clockwork Orange--found at the bottom.) (October: edited to include the Daniel Myer theory) This all links back to Biotechnology. Otherwise known as David Shaw, Noah Shaw’s father. Noah’s father owns a megacorporation that all stems from research in biotechnology. According to the UN Convention on Biological Diversity, Act 2, biotechn
I’m thinking that the two either originated and were artificially formed, or were experimented on, so as to encompass the G1821—genetic experimentation that defied nature and defied God. A couple of you have mentioned the link between the genetic code and Jude and Claire’s address: 1281 Live Oak Court.
Instead I remember semblances of certain things, and in my mind I can link them back to certain places, or locations, of where I’ve seen them (tangent, I know, but essentially it’s like if you asked me for a definition of a concept I wouldn’t remember, but I would remember the concept you want to find and remember it’s location in a book, eg.
I quite enjoyed the book more than The Unbecoming of Mara Dyer.
Mara Dyer in this book is not better than the previous one with those hallucinations, she thinks her ex is back but her parents and doctor don't believe her.
Noah Shaw is the one who believe in everything Mara tells him and he's trying to protect her at all costs.
He's obviously a Gary-Stu in my opinion.The romance in this book is intense.
Noah wants Mara to conquer her demon and come to him.
I love this kind of relationship and hope that they'll find their HEA in the next book.
*4.25 ENTRANCED STARS* “This was the boy I loved. A little bit messy. A little bit ruined. A beautiful disaster. Just like me.”  AGAIN WITH THAT CLIFFHANGER ENDING!! I  CANNOT  HANDLE IT.If I don’t manage to get my hands on the last book soon, it’s gonna be my ass in a mental hospital and not Mara’s!I really easily tend to forget what happened in books I’ve read a long time ago.It’s been a year and a half since I’ve read the first book in this series, and this story sucked me back in as if no ti

One thing is for sure, once readers put this one down, they'll definitely need some time before picking up any other book.Mara in this book, was let's just say, funny and in a way messed up as she was in the last book.
The one most important thing I loved about Mara was that, even though her life just decided to spiral towards cookoo-ville, she remained strong, optimistic, loyal, (insert many other synonyms), and stayed true to herself.Okay, I've decided that I'm going to dedicate an entire gushy paragraph to Noah Shaw just because this boy deserves it!
I honestly don’t know what to say...As in, I have no words because this book really didn’t strike anything, not even to the point where I’m blowing fire ranting about it...Yet it’s not good enough where I can actually say anything positive about it. Rtc, but until then (which will probably be a while cause this gurl has quite a few Rtcs) this book shall remain a:Meh.
