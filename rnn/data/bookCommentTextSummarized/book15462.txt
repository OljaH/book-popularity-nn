A MILLION STARS IF IT WERE POSSIBLE!Literally one of the best mangas I've ever read.
It's all about animals, which I loved, and Leo is insanely adorable.
I really hate the cover though, I'm so sick of misleading covers.
My parents will see this and think "WTF are you reading?!" And really, I think my mom would like it.
It says 'Teen+ for OLDER TEEN' on the back, but again, that's misleading.
No cussing, no nudity, (Leo did have his shirt off once though), and not even that much blood.
(Honestly, my phone has more pictures of him than mine)When Vie and I went to the park.This one time when we were home alone and the best friend came over.He looks like a blonde fluffy burrito OM NOM NOM.Mum knit him this sweater; I swear everyone at home adores him.
Even the extended family.From Holi last year.Their bromance is a stuff of legends.When I went out with ze friends early this month and spotted sleepy puppies!This manga is about a girl who loves animals but they seem to hate her for some reason.
The cover does not serve this manga! I mean, it looks kind of explisite, though it's a perfectly innocent story about a girl who likes animals and a boy who behaves like one. Actually, she even treats him like a pet! However, the romance was really nice and cute and the characters were adorable!!
Contrary to the bondage-y looking cover, this is a pretty innocent story. The relationship is very like that of a cat to a person, with only hints of sexual or romantic attraction to come later. Likewise, the mysterious background is not explored, although it is implied that one of his parents is a shape-shifter or other supernatural creature.
Cute and funny!
I loved the main lead, Yuiko.
She is kind and brave.
She loves animals.
And Leo, he is really sweet guy and funny, even though he has dangerous looking eyes as he has grown up in nature, like Mouqli.
He has some animal instincts too.
No wonder, Yuiko was interested in him.
Despite the cliches, the whole story was simple and heartwarming.
The mutual kindness and closeness between Yuiko and Leo felt so geniue and cute.
It really made me feel better in general.
I was smiling the whole way.
Too bad that it is only two volumes long.
"He lived out in the wild for a long time."Yuiko loves animals so much she terrifies them when she glomps them.
Because of this, everyone's terrified of Leo.But Yuiko sees how gentle he is towards animals and after talking to him, realizes he's just a big softy who just wants a friend.I liked how the love interest wasn't a rude jerk for once.
Leo was adorable and went through rough times but he still is kind towards others.
Yuiko and him immediately click and it's because of her compassion that Leo adores her.
The other main character, Leo, looked a lot like L from Death Note, Volume 1: Boredom.Yuiko is a ditzy girl who loves animals and is undeterred by the fact that animals don't seem to like her very much.
One day, as she's rescuing / getting mauled by a cat who runs up a tree to escape her, she meets Leo, a wild boy covered in blood, who is up in the tree and who calms the cat.
Leo takes a liking to Yuiko, who is the only student who has shown him kindness.
YAAAAAAAASSSS! This is the cutest!!!! Leo is too cute to be true! Leo and Yuiko！ OTP!!!!!!!!!! 5 stars! The art style was not fantastic, simple yet cute!!! Awesome!
Just a short romance manga, that's all. Just THE CUTEST THING I'VE EVER READ IN MY WHOLE LIFE NO BIG DEAL.
Do not judge this book by its cover. Its actually a funny sweet story with a cute romance.
But before I tell you what I enjoyed about this story I must say I never would have given it a shot if didn’t already love Motomi Kyoususke’s current series Dengeki Daisy but because I do I did give Beast Master a try and am sorry I did not pick it up sooner.The story begins with our heroine Yuiko trying to coax a cat to come to her, her neighbor’s cat who likes to go out and because Yuiko loves animals so much she doesn’t mind.
Como en sus anteriores obras, esta autora me ha hecho pasar un buen rato. La pareja de Aoi, una súper amante de los animales (como yo XD) y Leo, un chico súper dulce que saca su lado salvaje cuando detecta amenaza (tiene su porqué) es adorable. Y sus historias son muy disparatadas.
3.5 I liked this! it is really cute and I hope we get to learn more about Leo's past in the final volume. ^^
So cute. 😊
Uno dei pochi shojo che ho letto, dato che non mi piace molto il genere. Una storia originale, lui non è il solito figaccione di questo genera, anzi ricorda un po' L di Death Note, lei è una poveretta che ama , non ricambiata, gli animali, che preferiscono il più ferale lui. Ferale però solo all'apparenza. Il risultato finale è un racconto tenero, dolce e sopratutto molto spassoso.
A silly concept, but a fun shoujo manga with a sweet side to it.Yuiko is a normal high school girl who loves animals.
It makes for a refreshing change from near-abusive guys with glasses that often pop up in this genre.There's plenty of moe moments for the shoujo crowd in the book, too.
There's some nice comedic moments with a trio of local tough guys who prove to be a lot more helpful than you think, and you can tell Yuiko wants nothing more than a kitty or doggie of her own to hug and pet and call it george.The art is decent, but don't go by the cover.
When I read the title and saw the cover I was thinking that it would turn out to be really weird or just frankly, be pretty crappy.
But it was highly rated on managafox and I saw it was only two books so I figured I would have nothing to lose.
You just need to read it to find out.
Even though it's short, it has a great story (as well as some fantastic and very touching extra stories) and I feel that it wrapped up really well and left me very satisfied ^-^ So stop reading reviews!
Go read it right NOW!Awh crap...
I have a few shorter series that I like to read over and over -- this is one of them.
A short story about Yuiko who uninterested in boys - loves animals instead - but animals seem to HATE, and the new "beast-like" male transfer-student that everyone's afraid of: Rei Aoi....you see where this is going...When Rei Aoi is scared or sees blood his hair turns white, he loses control, and becomes a wild-beast beating-up his aggressors.
For every other adult the drawing was fine -- but her reveal of the father seemed like a joke.
Oh my, what a beautiful story...This is one of the shortest but most unique mangas I've read in a while."Yuiko Kubozuka is a high school girl who loves animals.
The next day, that boy turns out to be Yuiko's new transfer classmate, Leo Aoi. She finds him to be funny and not scary at all, while everyone else feared him because of his appearance.
Not only was she not scared but she helped him calm down and get to his senses.A beautiful romantic story about a boy from the wilderness and a girl with a kind heart...
This is the story of Yuiko, a girl who scares animals and Leo, a boy who scares humans but attracts animals.
You see, when Leo see's blood, he blackouts and his primal instincts take over turning him into a raging beast that is unstoppable, that is until Yuiko comes along.
From the moment that Leo saves a cat that Yuiko unintentionally scared up into a tree they are inseparable.
Leo hugs Yuiko and tells her not to move so that he can call the birds over to them.
Thoug the series was really short and I wish that it was longer (>.<) it was good while it lasted.I have to say Leo's character is so cute, he should have his own collectors items.
And he loves Yuiko which is great but the funny thing is how he is so childish and clingy and OMG, its so cute.
>3<So, if you've read this series, you know when Leo left and then Yuiko was all sadicle and then Leo was all sadicle?
Then they kissed, YAY!:DSo overall, the series was amazing and entertaining and cute and hilarious.
I liked it very much. Leo is so adorable!!!! I like this one as much as the other manga by the author Dengeki Daisy. It is adorable, fun and has action which I loved very much. I'm looking forward for other mangas by the magaka. This is my review for all the volumes and the maybe spoiler review on the last volume with my fav parts from it.
I bought these when I was a bit younger. In fact it was one of my *kuch kuch*first bought*kuch kuch* manga. And once in a blue moon I will reread all my manga to see if I still adore them with a passion only a teenager can muster.Can't say I still have the passion but I still adore this manga. It just makes me laugh and personally I think it's amazing that this manga can still do that.
So far so good ! Just finished reading the first volume of BeastMaster and its adorable. If you like romance, strong heroes that have the tendency to be quirky, silly but sweet heroines, then you might like Beastmaster.Very light, happy reading, ( some situations of peril) nice artwork and just the right touch of romance and fan girl cheering in this volume. Will continue to read series.
4.5 stars
best manga for 'sociopathic' like me
Manga davvero carino, mi è piaciuto molto. La storia è interessante, il tratto del disegno molto curato e i personaggi... beh li ho AMATI <3 Voglio assolutamente un Leo personale ora :D
Yet another book I love!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! There has got to be something wrong with me..... Hey where can I find the sequal?????
The translation I read was good. Very clean for a manga and rather enjoyable. I tried one of her other series (Dengeki Daisy) but it was not clean enough for me to continue reading it.
Hikâye beni çok da etkilemedi, çizimler de Electric Daisy, Vol. 1’den aşina olduğumuz tarzda.İki ciltlik bir şey olduğu için yarım bırakmaya gerek yok, bitireyim gitsin diyorum.
