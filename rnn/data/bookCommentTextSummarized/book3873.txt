At first glance, these two popular genre novels lack the subtlety and resonance of Rampo's short tales...that is, until we reflect on the very different narrative voices of each.The Black Lizard is in the form of a classic pulp yarn of romantic adventure, starring a beautiful master jewel thief and her devoted male accomplices, and also featuring a master detective half in love with her but nevertheless determined to bring her to justice.
برای چشم بادامی ها هیچ مرزی بین تخیل و واقعیت وجود نداره . همین باعث میشه شما کتاب های ازشون بخونید یا فیلم هایی ببینید که عجیب ترین جرم جنایات در اون رخ میده
One tends to think of Japan as quite insulated culturally in the years leading up to World War II, but Edogawa Rampo was writing Western-influenced crime stories as early as 1922.
Today, every Japanese mystery writer’s ultimate goal is to win the Edogawa Rampo Prize for the year’s best novel.
Sadly, though, most of Rampo’s work still awaits translation into English – that’s why it was such a treat to read these two early novels from Japan’s grand master of the genre.The Black Lizard pits Rampo’s master detective, Akechi Kogoro, against the seductive wiles of a female jewel-thief extraordinaire.
Edogawa Rampo (say his name out loud) is one of Japan's great figures in the mystery lit field. Like his American namesake, he deals with the creepy and the decadent. A major voice in early 20th Century Tokyo, Rampo can write horror that is extremely sexy. 'The Black Lizard' is a novel about a woman criminal matching her wits with a Detective. Yukio Mishima wrote a screenplay based on this book - and the film version is great.
مارمولک سیاه را خواندم.بسیار ناامیدکننده.گویا سانسور هم زیاد داشت چون شخصیت اصلی یک فم فتال بود.کل کتاب بر پایه تغییر قیافه و مخفی شدن در جعبه بود.عجیب بود که چگونه اینقدر تغییر قیافه ها باور پذیر بود و کسی هم مشکوک نمی شداز این کتاب هاست که باید بفروشمش
خلاف آنچه شنیده بودم، کتاب جذاب نبود.داستان های اتاق قرمز (مجموعه داستان همین نویسنده) را که بخوانی دیگر به خواندن این رمان نیازی نیست.کارآگاه بسیار باهوش است... همیشه چند قدم جلوتر از مجرم است و این عجیب است.داستان موزه ای که مجرم راه انداخته هم باز نمی شود و به نظرم بسیار نقص داشت.
This book contains two of his famous novels, ‘The Black Lizard’ and ‘Beast in the Shadows.’ I didn’t read both in one go; rather there were a couple of weeks and at least one book in between.The Black Lizard is a well-known story in Japan and was made into a movie in the 1960s.
Yet, the gothic story has stayed with me for these several weeks since I read it.Beast in the Shadows was, to me, a much better and suspenseful story.
Crack is good, but Rampo's better!At least, the English translation of the short stories collected in Japanese Tales of Mystery and Imagination were like crack for me.
Instantly recognizable as classic Rampo, with all of the elements I enjoyed in the aforementioned collection: fantastic mystery and sheer imagination, in the tradition of Conan Doyle, and of course, Poe.Why they didn't lead with this story is beyond me, since The Black Lizard is easily the weaker of the two.
Famously, the translation for Japanese Tales of Mystery and Imagination was arduous (it's also recounted here in the introduction).
I would probably say that I was a bit disappointed with "The Black Lizard" ...
and was expecting something a bit clunky and unsophisticated.
Watching the film, all of the hiding in furniture seemed a bit unoriginal from a man who'd written "The Human Chair".
The book is a bit self-conscious about this, it's kind of sweet and try-hard po-mo but it's not very smooth.
This is sophisticated, very sexy ("The Black Lizard" was a bit sexy, I liked everyone being naked in cages), believable (no doppelgangers or people spending three minutes in quite straitened circumstances to transform their appearance), and mysterious.
درسته ک معمای حل نشده داستان باعث شد چند ساعته کتاب رو تموم کنم اما نمره قابل قبولی نگرفت. تغییر چهره بیش از حد و آخر داستان نسبتا گنگ ... و البته با اسامی ژاپنی هم نتونستم ارتباط برقرار کنم با کارهای آگاتا کریستی قابل مقایسه نیست
تغییر چهره زیاد داشت. نتونستم باهاش کنار بیام
اولین کتاب جنایی ای بود که از ادبیات ژاپن خوندم داستان دست خوش سانسور های بسیاری شده بود مخصوصا سی صفحه آخر به اوجش رسیده بود که برای یک داستان جنایی که در آخر نتیجه گیری و روشن شدن حقیقت رو دربرداره جالب نبود.
He seemed to try imitating the style of classic British/American detective stories from the 1920s-30s, but while it gave off that feeling, the pace of the writing was way too slow and often lacking in energy.
My impression was that The Black Lizard was supposed to be a fun story about a battle between a sexy female thief and a famous, sharp-witted detective.
Both stories would have actually been very good if the writing style had more energy and a faster pace.
Instead, the narration style made both novellas feel like cliche, generic detective stories with predictable plots, and frankly sucked out all the fun.
There was even an unsubtle reference to another of the writer's works, THE HUMAN CHAIR, that inspires the villain to form a new plot.Much better, and darkly disturbing, was the second novella, BEAST IN THE SHADOWS.
Still, that didn't detract from the work at all, and the ending definitely fit the tone that had been established.Much has been written about the author's desire to reimagine Edgar Allan Poe for Japanese audiences, especially Poe's TALES OF MYSTERY AND IMAGINATION.
However, his writings are interesting beyond mere curiosity...and some, like BEAST IN THE SHADOWS, are haunting.
A beautiful, brilliant villainess with a black lizard tattoo plots to kidnap the daughter of a jeweller, so she can get her hands on a famous gem.
If you've never read Rampo this might be a good place to start, as The Black Lizard is a clever crime caper with some improbable but fun twists and a genuinely odd vibe.
The second story, Beast in the Shadows, is just as far-fetched and just as entertaining.
A series of clever twists and ingenious ideas lead to a surprising conclusion.
Who is the Beast in the Shadows?
the second novel, beast in the shadows, is pretty brilliant--complex, grotesque, with elements of metafiction/unreliable narration that worked really well.
the first novel on the other hand, the black lizard, was pretty lame; it reminded me of lupin III, and it was basically silly pulp stuff, but without even being compelling like beast in the shadows was.
some of the treatment of gender/sex (especially considering this dealt with S&M and a bunch of weird fetishes) didn't work well for me, but since this was written more than 80 years ago it's understandable, and in a lot of ways it's impressive that rampo went into some of this territory at all.
There's a real Batman/Catwoman vibe to the story of the Black Lizard, and a strange sort of sadness to it that adds to the story. This is not the Akechi Kogoro of The Fiend with Twenty Faces, and this book is much more adult and intense. Beast in the Shadows isn't quite as well done, but it also combines violence, mystery, and tainted love to create an interesting tale unlike modern mysteries. Neither are too difficult to figure out, but the fun is still in the reading.
Interesantísimo libro, dos historias bastante atrayentes y atrapantes. La lagartija negra presenta una lucha de ingenio entre los dos protagonistas, y el desarrollo de un romance, cada capítulo es una nueva lucha de ingenio y, siempre plantea el interrogante de ¿cómo lo hizo?.La bestia entre las sombras me parece la mejor de las dos historias, tanto desde El punto de vista del estilo cómo de la historia en si, atrapante, llena de interrogantes y, fundamentalmente, el asesino nos engaña conforme su plan. Una historia atrayente con su toque de perversión.
Stopped about  way through the Black Lizzard. I just don’t like the style. There are patronizing comments of the narrator everywhere.“Now perhaps readers will think the author has committed a major bungle here. (…) But the author has not made a mistake.” Actually, the author has made a mistake, of annoying me with this comment so much that i stopped reading shortly after this.

I liked Beast in the Shadows better then The Black Lizard. Both were entertaining.
These two classic by the Japanese father of detective fiction are like coked-up Agatha Christie novels teeming with sex and bloody violence. Awesome.
I know he’s considered the grand master of mystery in Japan (a friend once told me that she had asked the shopkeeper at a book store in Osaka if people would get confused at having Edogawa Rampo and Edgar Allen Poe so close to each other on the bookshelves, and the man had simply replied “no way, Rampo is much more famous.”) Well naturally, being a fan of detective fiction, and especially Japanese detective/mystery fiction, I knew I had to read this book.Black LizardThis story is written from a third person omniscient viewpoint.

These two golden-age novellas by Edogawa Rampo while as different as night and day (or - since they are both dark in tone - as different as night and night) are equally excellent in their plotting and characterizations.
“The Black Lizard” involves a battle between a master criminal and an equally skilled private detective.
It plays like an adventure story rather than a mystery and includes jewel robberies, kidnappings, locked rooms, and cliffhanging situations.
“Beast in the Shadows”, a story of sadism, murder, and detective writers, is very complex (towards the end I wasn’t totally sure what was up) and very nasty-dark.
This book is a collection of two novellas by Edogawa Rampo, and each has a very different style.
At first I had trouble getting into this book.
The translation of he first story felt incredibly cheesy and fake, with many lines coming off to me as stilted and forced.
However, the story itself has many twists and turns and it’s fun to try to guess what is happening.Overall, I felt the second story was much stronger, with more interesting characters and more satisfying writing.
Nevertheless, overall, I was still somewhat disappointed by this collection.
Two stories that couldn't be more different if they tried.
The Black Lizard reads as an aged spies movie, a romantic story where the mistery is more about how Akechi manages to outsmart her nemesis than about the crimes themselves.
I have to say I was a bit dissapointed by this one, as my expectations were those of a mistery fan, and I craved for a well-crafted crime.The Beast of Shadows, on the other hand, was way more interesting to me.
A well laid out mistery, reminding of Edogawa's love for Poe's work.
I really recommend reading at least this one.
البته این به ترجمه بیشتر برمی گردد تا خود داستان. گرچه چندان پرمایه نبود. ممیزی یا همان سانسور داستان را ناقص و تکه تکه شده کرده بود. به ویژه پایان اش که واقعا توهین به نویسنده و خواننده اثر است. نمی دانم چرل مترجم یا ناشر این طور مثله شده به خود اجازه می دهند داستان کسی را چاپ کنند. البته گذشته از حق نشر نویسنده که گمان نمی کنم پرداخته باشند.
