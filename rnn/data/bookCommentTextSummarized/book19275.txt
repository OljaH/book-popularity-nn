I just keeping thinking how sad it is that Harry didn't have these amazing people in his childhood.
And like I said in my review of the Cursed Child- I could never have enough of from the HP world.
‘Oh, OUR names, did you mean? You should’ve said! This here is James Potter, and I’m Sirius Black!’Now what was that supposed to mean?Find more of my books on Instagram
I feel like I've been punk'd. The ending.   What did you think? Who do you think the guys in the alley were? Why were James and Sirius trying to go so fast on their bikes? So many questions!  So many questions. No kidding. Lucky me. I get to do all the asking and wondering. I can't even - **DRIVES BACK** But wait. Seriously, is it that some pages are missing from the version of the story I read? Maybe it's some kind of puzzle! **RECHECKS. AGAIN** Nope.I'M OUT. AGAIN.I still love you, J.K, uncond

Woah!I did not know that this existed. The only problem with this book was that it was not a book. A 3 page prequel."I felt like the times never turned. Harry Potter remains the best book I have ever read." The bond between Sirius and James is too strong to be suppressed in the pages of memory. They stay alive and afresh, no matter at which point of time you read them.Your age does not matter. It never does. All that matters, is the warmth in your heart.Thank you Ritu for recommending this to me

This is a book dedicated to you.Harry Potter is the best piece of work I have ever read and you are the best book I have!People, you will savor this short prequel.Because friendship and love can make you a person you never thought you were.
I read this a few weeks ago online actually, and it was short but great.It refueled the fire within me that burns just to say, "We need a Marauders book/movie."We need one.Now.I'm looking at you, Rowling.
Set three years before the birth of Harry Potter, the story recounts an adventure had by Sirius Black and James Potter. The story is just 800 words & 4 pages long, so i don’t think it qualifies as a full sequel. Perhaps it would have worked better as a bonus chapter in the Prisoner of Azkaban or even the Order of the Phoenix (Harry accessing one of the memories stored in Dumbledore’s office, again  )But reading this book brought back memories of reading Harry Potter and this book was written

I hope that there is a spinoff series for the ‘Marauders’ in the future.
Remember the time when your ate your favorite chocolates and nothing would stop you from saying "I want more of it, Please!!"This prequel left me saying the same thing!!First I come to know a prequel of Harry Potter exists and when I read it, it sums itself up in the blink of an eye!! Why Why Why!!Such a small read!! If that's not cheating and betrayal, then I don't know what is!!!
I have acute nostalgia for HP today and recall that I haven't read this one, I don't know why, but I decided to read it anyway. This is a too-short story. James and Sirius get into trouble, nothing serious. But the main point is that we see their lives being so lively and full of energy. Sirius is an basically easy-going guy, and I wonder if it's possible to learn more about him in the future with other short stories, companion novels or whatsoever.I think I might reread all of the HP books again next month.
I didn't know that I had missed something from my beloved series.
When I came to know about this, I went for this without wasting more time.
This story is just a little adventure of James Potter and Sirius Black (one of my favourite characters in the series) Good!!
:D :DThis story was too short.
That's why I love her works.
So sad she didn't write more fantasy books after Harry Potter series.
😔 She wrote just one series and wrote it in a way that she can't be forgotten.
But still I really wish I could get more of her works.
oh my poor little heart, it could not take this tiny little sliver of happiness. eight-hundred words were not enough, I needed more of padfoot and prongs.  "The one who had been driving had long black hair; his insolent good looks reminded Fisher unpleasantly of his daughter’s guitar-playing, layabout boyfriend. The second boy also had black hair, though his was short and stuck up in all directions; he wore glasses and a broad grin."  *sobs*you can read the 800 word prequel written by JK for a c

Short but sweet, full of nostalgic feels and obviously five stars as it was written by Queen Rowling!
...This here is James Potter, and I’m Sirius Black!”“Things’ll be seriously black for you in a minute, you cheeky little —”Okay - it is official now! We need a book SERIES about the Marauders!
I "siriusly" can't rate this because too short! What did the comedian say to Harry Potter? Why so Sirius?
I wish JK Rowling would write 7 books about the Marauders' life in Hogwarts.. Is it too much to ask?😭😭
"Both were dressed in T-shirts emblazoned with a large golden bird; the emblem, no doubt, of some deafening, tuneless rock band" A LARGE GOLDEN BIRD .... ... A PHOENIX? Are James and Sirius wearing matching ORDER OF THE PHOENIX t-shirts?!??!?!?!??!?! LMFAOFJHwioefhgbiuakjs those idiots

This here is James Potter, and I’m Sirius Black!”
I'm new to the Harry Potter book fandom, I liked the movies for all of my childhood but only allowed myself to dive into the books this year.
Sirius Black was my favourite character in the Harry Potter series, and this short 800-word story made me want to cry so much.Set three years before Harry is born James and Sirius are doing what they do best - getting into trouble.
“We owe you one!”“Yeah, nice meeting you!” said James.
مگه جادو کردن جلوی مشنگ ها نقض قانون رازداری نیست؟
`Thanks very much!' called Sirius over the throb of the engine. `We owe you one!' `Yeah, nice meeting you!' said James. `And don't forget: Elvendork! It's unisex!'If you're thinking, 'what the hell' and 'this makes no sense', then you should read Harry Potter: Prequel because it makes as much sense as that quote. It feels odd to give anything related to the Harry Potter series anything less than 5 stars but this novella really has nothing to do with the series and it adds nothing to the series either.
“And don’t forget: Elvendork!
It’s unisex!”I needed something light - this fit the bill.
If you haven't read it yet, you have no earthly idea exactly how short 800 words can feel.
As a side note: I really really love the image of James, Lily, Sirius, and Lupin all matching in Order of the Phoenix tees.
Lily: I believe it's called a secret society...Lupin: Well, right.
She has a point...James: No one will ever know, you worry too much!Sirius: Well we could tattoo ourselves up with our symbol but I've heard there's a group already doing that sort of thing - tacky, really.
Jedan trenutak ti puls ubrza od radosti zbog susreta sa starim likovima i već sledeći te žacne tuga jer je u pitanju kratka priča od svega 800 reči.
Opisana nam je dogodovština iz mladosti Džejmsa i Sirijusa koja prikazuje susret sa policijom nakon što su uhvaćeni kako prebrzo voze svima poznati motorcikl.
Situacija i postupci policajaca će vas svakako oraspoložiti, kao uostalom i zafrkavanje dobro poznatog dvojca.
Iako je Roulingova navela da je u pitanju samo kratka priča, nakon objavljivanja osme knjige me ne bi čudilo da jednog dana čitamo o događajima pre Harijevog rođenja, a nakon što su njegovi roditelji i prijatelji završili Hogvorts.
This contained one action scene of unexplained fragments, in Jo Rowling’s 800 words for a dyslexia charity.
Notably, “Harry Potter: The Prequel”, 2008, is a treat; just by being an additional glimpse of much-loved characters.
Evil and darkness abound, while secrets and clues to decode, delight any avid mystery fan.
The romance and family love, extended to the Weasleys and school teachers, are very adult in scope.
We could have basked in a lovely tableau of Harry with his parents.
I am glad Jo’s handwriting helped a charity but would have, by far, preferred an emotional union.
A family prequel would be wonderfully timely for me!

Only complaint, way too short *pouts* So much fun to read :)Oh, you wanted a real review? Too bad :-P ;-)Read the story here
★ ★ stars! I liked this but it added nothing to series. I suppose it’s a good example of the sort of shenanigans Sirius and James got up to in their younger years.
3.5 Golden Starsthat was cute! & fun!but short!I hope we had more James & Sirius & marauders' stories!I loved James! even before I knew this fancast.😍edits below from my marauders account on instagram:
The unofficial Harry Potter prequel is an 800-word story written by J.K. Rowling. It was handwritten for a charity event at Waterstone’s.Just 800 words filled with wonder!http://www.mugglenet.com/harry-potter...
What a pair of dorks. Loved it! It was really short though.
Oh boy! Reading about James Potter and Sirius Black as a teenager is a true delight.
Oh my! James and Sirius so funny! I need more! J.K. Rowling should make books about this two troublemakers.
** Books 222 - 2017 **3,1 of 5 stars! What?! I've never know before such prequel is exist! :OOkay it maybe not count into novel since it is only 3 pages! Shorter than Short stories =__=a the link :http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Har...
