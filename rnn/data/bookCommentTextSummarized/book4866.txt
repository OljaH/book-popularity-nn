Add to this sudden wealth the fact that the guy took his wife’s last name for the duration of the cruise and you came to the same conclusion as his wife: he embezzled the money from his company.Still with me?
Belle was leading high-class life on the ship and as a part of it developed a crush on a guy completely out of her league – from a social standing point of view.
The problem was, the guy was already in sights of a woman from his class: a spoiled entitled girl who used to get what she wants.
And, of course, in 1938, $25,000 was no small amount.Mrs. Newberry is most concerned about her daughter who is, naturally, young, beautiful, intelligent, outgoing and delightful.
Mrs. Newberry doesn't want Belle to be embarrassed when it becomes apparent that the two families don't really move in the same social circle, and she really doesn't want Belle to suffer if it turns out that her stepfather is a crook.Mason agrees to look into the matter and is soon burning up the airwaves with ship-to-shore telegrams.
In a twist of fate, the president of the company is also on board the ship with Perry, Della and the Newberrys.

Erle Stanley Gardner.
***.Gardner did his damnedest to confuse the reader with this adventure.
Constant introductions of new or alternative suspects left me hanging at the end of each chapter.
They meet up with a woman who claims that her husband was likely guilty of embezzling $25,000 from his employer, and then changing his name and lifestyle.
Things come to a head when the husband is killed by being shot and then thrown into the ocean.
You get to pick from about five different likely suspects, but have to wait until the very last chapter to really learn who the culprit was.
I had to fight my way to the end.
Mason and secretary Della Street are enjoying an ocean voyage back to the mainland, after a working trip to Hawaii, but can Mason ever stay out of a tense, mysterious case? One of the most complex and convoluted of Mason’s cases, what begins as a simple favour to help safeguard the happiness of a young girl just setting out on life, turns into an almost insolvable mystery, even stumping the famous lawyer, and forcing him to adopt the most unorthodox means to ultimately find a solution. Well worth reading.
That, and the ingenious plots, are why I read Perry Mason.On the whole, the ones written by 1950 are the best.
Newberry is the name of Belle's mother and deceased father; the step-father's name is actually Carl Moar.
Belle's mother thinks it must have been Carl.With that background, during the storm mentioned above, a man goes overboard.
I won't go through all the details of who saw what and who said what, but the man overboard is identified as Carl Moar and Mrs. Newberry, Belle's mother, is arrested for murder.Oh yes, what is the "substitute face"?
In the earlier Mason books, Perry is always ready to get engaged in a fight, verbal or physical and he proposes to Della Street on and off when the mood strikes. Lots of cliches and dated jingo lingo. Mason is returning from a trip to the Orient with Della (vacation) and in passing through Hawaii takes on a case aboard ship. The substitute face is a client's picture in a frame, substituted for a famous actress, whom she resembles. Take it away, Perry....
This book left me stunned. I never thought that the solution would be that simple. Next time I read a Perry Mason novel, I'll try to jot down notes. Though I doubt I'd be able to uncover the mystery. Five stars!
i am beginning to really like this author's work. this is the second perry mason book i have read and i love the pace, charm, wit and the sheer amount of clues that surround the mystery. definitely give it a go if you can get your hands on this book.
Fun and a little bit unexpected. Yay!
A very good mystery. Though, it did get a little confusing in between, finally all's well.
Belle talks like a pre-teen, and nothing in the story really justifies the special regard Mason has for her.
These people are not like the rest of us.
Take Celinda Dial, for instance: "A good polo player, holds an aviator's license, has a yacht of her own, shoots par golf." Lots of ugly cliches which demean minorities are bandied about (especially n...
At least Gardner seems to have moved beyond the idea that people's eyes have almost a speaking role in describing character.You see a more emotional Mason here, especially concerning Della Street.
The trial scene is the usual high point of the story.Lots of quibbles, sure.
Kui ma "Purunenud pildiraami juhtumit" lugema hakkasin, tundus see mulle kummaliselt tuttav. Raamaturiiulis seda aga polnud, nii et ilmselt olen selle kunagi raamatukogust laenutanud. Esimene lugemine võib jääda nii 10-15 aasta taha. Ja arvestades, et mul olid peamised asjad meeles (sh ka üllatav lõpplahendus), võib järeldada, et tegu on piisavalt hea raamatuga, et jälg maha jätta. Seekordsel lugemisel ta nii hea ei tundnud (pigem 4/5), ent eks müsteeriumite puhul ongi ootamatused ja värskus väga olulised. Ja noh, Perry Masoni lood on alati väga mõnusad ajaviitekrimkad.
great Perry Mason story
It sure was convenient that so many people potentially connected to an embezzlement scheme were on the same Hawaiian cruise.
Intricate and fast-paced, bringing back the flavor of the past - how could I give anything less than 5 stars to Perry Mason?
The twelfth book in the series. As I've previously said - I'm not going to review them all. they are all interesting and great reading, but I'm just putting a quick note to say that this is the best so far. ESG is close to stride now. So far no Hamilton Burger and no Lieutenant Tragg but I have a feeling they're waiting in the wings.
Older mystery authors like Erle Stanley Gardner do not seem to follow formulas as much as many of the current authors I've read.
Perry Mason is asked to help a woman who believes her husband has embezzled $25,000 from his company.
While he takes only murder cases he listens to her concerns to give advice.
Then her husband disappears, presumably murdered and the woman is accused of the murder.
Mason takes her case because he believes she is innocent.
A quite good read and I recommend it anyone who enjoys Perry Mason and/or Erle Stanley Gardner.
Reading early Perry Mason novels like this one makes it clear how ESG was able to sell 300 million of the things.
Sometimes you wonder if Perry is trying to PROVE his client innocent or MAKE him so.
Lots of twists and turns that actually advance the plot; nothing gratuitous.
The crime takes place at sea and the trial is at San Francisco, so you're far removed from many of the pillars of the other novels.
But the plot is only stronger because of it.
I think this is the oldest Perry that our library owns, and I'm quite glad I found it.
Despite the hotness of the previous installment, Perry and Della did not book a suite together for their romantic South Seas luxury cruse.
Perry apparently scored a room to himself, although he spent most of the storm-tossed voyage back from Hawaii to Los Angeles striding the decks being all manly.However, Della ended up with a roomie, which I guess was a thing back in the '30s if you didn't have the swag to manage a room to yourself.
Fortunately, it was a girl with decent sea legs and with a step-father murdered en voyage, so I suppose it wasn't a total loss.Perry, Della and Paul (who pops up once back in LA) make short work of this case, so further developments await apace.

Perry takes a vacation cruise with secretary Della Street, but business interferes.Perry Mason series - When Perry Mason meets Mrs. Carl Newberry on a vacation cruise, she is a woman desperately interested in saving face.
But Mrs. Newberry suspects that her husband embezzled their new-gotten gains and she turns to Mason for legal advice.
When Mr. Newberry dies suddenly and his wife is left holding his hefty money belt, Perry wonders if his grieving client is really a black widow.
It's Perry Mason, what's not to like.
This is one of the books where the relationship between Perry and Della is presented as much more personal than in the TV series.
At the beginning of the book they are returning from a long journey to the Far East, where they have been together for many months.
At the end the book he all but proposes to her.
She tells him he needs her as a secretary more than as a wife.Unfortunately there is a very un-PC phrase used twice in the book...it was more common in the 30's, but very disturbing now.
My first Perry Mason book and it was pretty good. It took a while to get into it but the solving of the mystery part played out well in the end.Yes as I heard Perry goes for theatrics and questionably legal tactics that would never fly in reality, but given its a fictional world I'll cut a little slack.Can't say I find the characters wonderfully developed or that I'm a fan of Perry as a person, but I think that development will unfold across the series.A fun read.
Della and Mason go for a cruise! You'll be shocked to learn that someone on board is murdered. Don't worry, Mason takes the case, and flimflams people until he has it solved.I wish more of it had been about the cruise, and less the murder. It seemed like a wasted opportunity. I guess Gardner didn't feel comfortable writing about the young ?lovers? spending so much time together without a murder going on. In fact, they only spend about 1/4 of the book on the cruise, the rest is in Sand Diego.
This was pretty interesting. How Perry stays out of jail on this case is one puzzle after another. But he is in prime form here. And Paul keeps saying "I don't think we ought to do that. We need to go slow here." But Perry just keeps plowing ahead. There are a lot of characters and it is tough to keep the characters straight without a program. Good thing we have one. I guess all of the clues are there. Unfortunately, I only picked up on some of them.
I think I can pick up a Perry Mason book blindly.. Fun always and interesting cases.. This one was no different. Thoroughly enjoyed it.. Rarely is Della's and Perry's relation given so much importance ;)
Pretty good mystery, though all of our three principals skirted the law at some points, it seemed. Some racist language thrown in twice was bothersome to me, even if it may have been common at the time.
Mason really took things too far this time, left fingerprints at the crime scene to trick the District Attorney's office to track down a witness....almost got Paul, Della and himself arrested.
In the last half page the relationship of Della and Perry is made clear.
This was a delightful read. All along, you know the solution is going to be more complicated than the clues would have you believe. Classic Gardner.
