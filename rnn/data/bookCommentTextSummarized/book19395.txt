I always wished that Paulo Coehlo was my uncle so that I could call him ‘Papa Coelho’ and sit at his knee while he smoked his pipe. I think that he would be delightfully eccentric, and given to saying things like ‘Suffering, if confronted without fear, is the great passport to freedom.’ So, true, Papa Coelho. So true. If he was my uncle, though, I might not tell him that I thought The Alchemist was tripe, and that most of his books carry too much philosophizing and not enough narrative. But in
I think that he would be delightfully eccentric, and given to saying things like ‘Suffering, if confronted without fear, is the great passport to freedom.’ So, true, Papa Coelho.
The narrator of the story tells us right off that he’s not going to try to write a straight-up biography, but that in the interests of objectivity (of a sort), he’s just going to put down verbatim the interviews he conducted on the subject of the alleged ‘witch.’ From the journalist who fell in love with her to the woman who felt betrayed by her, from birth mother to adoptive mother, from teacher to student, are all given a chance to tell how Athena, born Sherine and sometimes called Hagia Sofia, messed them over.
This book *really* made me think about who I am and where I am going, and who I want to be as a woman, a wife, a soon-to-be-mother, a daughter, and a human.I didn't always like Paulo Coehlo's work.
But a friend recommended Veronika Decides to Die to me while a loved one was in the hospital for depression and I was struggling to understand what might be happening in there, and ever since, Coehlo has been one of my obsessions.When I picked up The Witch of Portobello, I didn't know quite what to expect.
That is the central question of international bestselling author Paulo Coehlo's profound new work...""Oh. Profound," said the skeptic in me.
ونجح باولو كويلو في أن يجعلني أعطي نجمة واحدة لكتاب يمجد قداسة الأنثى-_-الرواية واحدة من أكثر الكتب التي قرأتها إملالا وسخافةبغض النظر عن التنمية البشرية التي تنضح بها الروايةوالتي هي عادة أصيلة عند كويلوفالرواية كبناء ضعيفة ورسم شخصياتها لم يكن على القدر المتوقع منه خاصة من كاتب رواية احدى عشر دقيقةوفوق كل ذلك الرواية لم تأتِ بجديدفلا متعة في الحكاية ولا في الفلسفةوليست هناك قيمة من أي نوعفقط غثاء وقرقرة ودس ألف نصيحة سيريالية لا معنى لهاوأخيرا روحانية كويلو تثير الغيظفعالمه ليس له وجود على ارض الواقعبل هو فقط في رأسهولا أظنه يريح أحدا سواه
Trapped for hours in an airport with nothing to read, my wife was further victimized by this remarkably bad book, one of five books available for sale in Portland International Airport at 2am.
You can turn to any page and find a really hackneyed phrase.
The story is supposed to be the voices of different people, but the Catholic priest, the Lebanese mother, the 65-year old restaurant owner, are all utterly indistinct.It's a platform for his blah-blah-blah philosophizing about Joy is this, Love is that, do these five things to live well, etc.
Maybe there's some good advice in here, but you'd need to be awake to absorb it.

Seriously, one of his characters lists four female archetypes that women supposedly follow, and although he calls them the witch, the virgin, the martyr and the saint, it's just that quote about how all roles for actresses are hookers, victims or doormats, with "bitch" thrown in for variety.
None of the characters felt particularly developed.
Oh, and the editor's notes just insulted my intelligence.
And, if you reference Maronite Christians, but it doesn't add a damn thing to your story, you don't have to interrupt a thought to tell me what their sect believes.
I could rant on like this for awhile, but basically, this is a preachy non-story that insults its readers intelligence.
What a load of crap, this..!!!I had long since wanted to try a Paulo Coelho book and I picked this on impulse.Man, I've never been soo damn wrong in my life.Half way through it, I was getting HEADSPINS...!!! Being stubborn as I am, somehow managed to get through it and was left utterly dismayed and with a very bad taste in my mouth.HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE..!!The author literally CHOKES you on his idea of spirituality and self awareness.WORST READ EVER..!!!!!!!
.. قبل أن أتحدث عن رأيي بالرواية ومضمونها , دعوني أكلمكم قليلاً عن عبادة الطبيعة ..هذا كان يا مكان وفي غابر الأزمان وقبل ظهور ما يسمى بالديانات السماوية كان هناك مفهوماً لدى غالبية البشر - تحول إلى عبادة فيما بعد - على أن الطبيعة تمنحنا الكثير وتخبرنا بأسرارها كل يوم ..
ومن يمثل الجمال إلى جانب الطبيعة غير " الأنثى " ؟ لذلك ظهرت أفروديت عند الرومان وفينوس عند الإغريق ..
أثينا الأنثى النابضة بالحياة كانت على صلة مع الطبيعة منذ طفولتها ..
أثينا تلك الغجرية الأنثى ..
أثينا كان يجب أن تموت ..
‘The Witch of Portobello’ by Paulo Coelho is not a straight biographical book or the opinion of the writer on its main protagonists. It’s what the other people transcribe the writer about the women, the Witch of Portobello. “No one lights a lamp in order to hide it behind the door……..No one sacrifices the most important thing she possesses: love. No one places her dreams in the hands of those who might destroy them. No one, that is, but Athena.” It’s the story of Athena, or Sherine Khalil, who w
It’s the story of Athena, or Sherine Khalil, who was always ready to walk out of the door from the comfort zone and confront the winds, the thunder and the lightning that life can bring, again and again, all by her own choice.According to the writer, there are four classic archetypes of women who search for a meaning to their lives or for the path of knowledge:The Virgin (not speaking of sexual virgin): One whose search springs from her complete independence and everything she learns is the fruit of her ability to face challenges alone.The Martyr: The one who finds her way to self-knowledge through pain, surrender and suffering.The Saint: The one who finds her true reason for living in unconditional love and in her ability to give without asking anything in return.The Witch: The one who justifies her existence by going in search of complete and limitless pleasure.“Normally, a women has to choose from one of these traditional feminine archetypes, but Athena was all four at once”Shreine Khalil, known as Athena was born in Romania and her parents, a successful industrialist family of Beirut adopted her, as their much loved, much-wanted daughter, who grew in wisdom and beauty.

I literally could not put this book down. While I'm a book lover and devour many books, I consider this one to be a very special treat.

I've heard wonderful things about Coelho and was excited to try him out, I love topics that deal with witchcraft and things fantastical, and I'm a sucker for redheaded heroines.
I was so annoyed by the middle of the book that I nearly put it down, but the cover art convinced me to keep trying.
Surely the artist must have been inspired to create such a beautiful cover ...
except that in the publishing world, cover artists rarely have time to read the books they're designing for, so it's unlikely there was much "inspiration".
It is one of Coelho’s books I'm ever gonna recommend to you.This book tells you the story of Athena, a very mysterious woman, the story itself told by many different flesh entities who knew her or did not know her at all.
From an early age she had a strong religious vocation and knew all the gospels by heart, which was a blessing and a curse.This book was totally different from other Coelho books.
Coelho verily focuses on multiple narrative process that is unsatisfying at times as they impose their different opinions on the main protagonist, Athena.
This is not a novel -- it's a treatise. There is a character, Athena, that I never come to care about, and there is no plot. What IS there, you ask? Well, there's an explication of a belief system. That's it. That's what this is.Most of the book is taken up in various people talking to each other in the kind of philosophical conversations that normal people almost never have. Whenever you see a chat starting, buckle up.I couldn't have been more disappointed, as I like Coelho most of the time. I just don't like being the object of preaching.
I find so many of the "rules" to be in direct conflict with Jesus' teachings, with passages from the Bible (which we also must remember was a) written by mortal men to the best of their recollection and b) was assembled by a group of men later on who cherry-picked gospels to support the doctrine they personally crafted.)But in general, we know Jesus was an amazing man who lived his life to include all people, not to exclude them.
And I have found the Catholic Church and it's devoted followers to be some of the most judgemental people.

أنهيت الرواية لان ضميري يمنعني غالبا من أن أبدأ كتابا ولا أنهيه !كانت واحدة من أكثر الروايات التي قرأتها مللا وسخافةربما تشبعت من الكلام الصوفي و "الام الكبرى" فهي بعيدة جدا عن معتقداتي...
فلماذا البحث عن معرفة الله في الطبيعة أو عن طريق الرقص أو طقوس اعتبرها شعودة فكرة عبادة الطبيعة و أن "الله لم يخلق الكون بل الله هو الكون" و "الإلهة الأنثى" كلها أفكار وثنية قديمة و لا علاقة لها بالإسلام.
لاني تفاجات بالكثير من القراء المسلمين ممن تقبلوا هده الأفكار بحجة أنها مغذية روحانيًا..في رأيي أن يتشبعوا بتعاليم الاسلام بدل هده الترهات..
ذهنم رو پر از سوال و فکر میکنه.تو تمام ساعت هایی که این کتاب رو میخونم و یا کنار میذارمش ذهنم رو درگیر خودش میکنه.روایت خیلی جالبی داشت و دوستش داشتم.
This book was a little "much." I was first introduced to Paulo Coelho with his acclaimed novel The Alchemist.
There was nothing natural about it - rather - almost something "forced" in trying to convey the story of a young woman finding her "center" through "the Mother" and essentially becoming a Witch; possessed bodies and cultish meetings included.
True - I didn't agree with any sort of life philosophy this novel conveyed - the female face of God being freedom from the bondage of a distant omnicient male God. It promoted chaos vs organization and attacked the idea of organized religion at all its core idealogy.
So I'm basically just going to write down my thoughts, and how the book made me feel.The main character, Athena, discovers that there could be more to life after going to her neighbour's flat to complain about the loud music.
Whilst I appreciate that the church is (generally) more relaxed now than it was them, it still throws forward the argument that unless you agree with their teachings and ways of life, you are seen as the enemy.After reading the book, somehow I felt more in touch with myself, although I haven't attempted to practice any of the methods Athena uses.
💙2.5/5This the story of Athena, a mysterious woman, the story itself told by many different flesh entities who knew her or did not know her at all.
From an early age she had a strong religious vocation and knew all the gospels by heart, which was a blessing and a curse.Athena had the secret desire to become a saint someday.
Her adopted mother, who was always ready to take care of her, give her all the love and comfort she could and want to see her win in whatever she does though didn’t understand her.
I bought this book in Cabo for a few pesos and later found it was being given away FREE, so my expectations were somewhat tempered and let me just say Coelho does not disappoint.
THANK GOD CHECK.
Check?

The beautiful, misunderstood, dancing gypsy motif hasn't been performed this well since 1996's Hunchback of Notre Dame, so kudos to Mr. Coelho for respecting Walt Disney pictures enough not to outdo it.Did I mention they were giving this book away for free?
Commençons d'abord par la structure que j'ai trouvé qu'elle n'était rien qu'une manifestation d'une envie inutile d'innover, et qui ne m'a pas du tout plu, parce qu'en écrivant l'histoire de la sorcière de Portobello à partir de différents points de vue, ce qui en résulte est une accumulation d'avis et non pas une histoire cohérente.
La spiritualité était un peu trop forcé, il n'y avait aucun genre de jouissance tout au long des 288 pages, seulement un tas de conseils fourrés dans les événements.Il n'y avait nullement des événements qui rendent le lecteur attaché à l'histoire et désirant la finir pour savoir ce qui va arriver.

ساحرة بورتوبيللو عمل فريد من نوعه على الأقل من حيث العرض الروائي فهذه هي المرة الأولى التي تصادفني رواية بمثل هذا السرد حيث تتكون الرواية من مجموعة شهادات لأصدقاء وشخصيات ذات صلة ببطلة القصة شيرين أو أثينا كما تحب أن تلقب.
لا أحبذ الدخول في الموضوعات الغيبية ولكنني استمتعت وأنا أقرأ هذه الرواية، السلبية التي شعرت بها هي بعض الأخطاء المطبعية بالإضافة للمطبات التي أضفتها المترجمة على سلاسة سرد اللغة في الرواية ففي الكثير من المواضع أشعرتنا المترجمة -سامحها الله- بأن الرواية مترجمة وبلغة عربية قد تكن غير متينة لكن يبقى فعل الترجمة أمراً ليس باليسير إتقانه.
Major disappointment. I've enjoyed Paulo Coelho's work before, but this is a very weak novel. I admit that I am easily creeped out by the kind of leaky spirituality that this book revolves around, but beyond that, the writing for female characters is god-awful and the mystic quest that the protagonist is on is laughable. The mystery of the compiler of all the separate accounts, once revealed, escaped being predictable by being stupid. A phoned-in, whimper of a book.
رواية جميلة .. أجمل من على نهر بييدرا هناك جلست فبكيت .. و اسوأ من الخيميائي و 11 دقيقة.لمن قرأ روايات باولو كويلو نجد أنها كلها تتحدث عن نفس الأفكار و نفس الثيمات الدينية و العقائد الأنثوية و الإيمان بالتقمص و بالسحر و بالمعجزات الناتجة عن الجري وراء بعض القديسين.بالنسبة لي عندما وصلت غلى نصف الرواية كنت أقول مع نفسي هاهو باولو كويلو و قد علمت ما ستؤول إليه النهاية !!!اقرأها و لكن لا تتوقع الكثير
إلى ما بعد منتصفها كنت قد رأيتها الرواية الأروع لباولو، لكن الأجزاء الأخيرة كادت تقتلني ، فلولاها ولولا بعض أفكار الكاتب التي أمقتها مثل:(روح العالم، الأم الكبرى...) ناهيك عن كونها مكررة في الروايات الثلاثة الأخرى التي قرأتها له لكنت أعطيتها النجمة الخامسة.لا بأس.. الرواية جميلة وتقدير النجمات الأربع منصف لها.
احببت الرواية ساحرة.. ^^اعجبتني هالفقرة:"الحب، يقولون لي. لكن الحب لا يجلب السعادة ولم يحلبها يوماً. فالحب، على العكس من ذلك! إنه حالة مستمرة من القلق، بل ساحة معركة، ليال هجرتها النوم، نتسائل فيها إن كان ما نفعله صواباً. الحب الحقيقي مزيج من الانتشاء والغصة."
This is the type of book I recommend you read in a quiet, comfortable room with the sunlight streaming in through the windows and the whole day stretched in front of you to think.
You might ask yourself, "Shouldn't all books be read under those conditions?"While that would be ideal, that isn't always the case.
This isn't a book to fly through.
Yes. But just read it and see for yourself what I mean.
This is one of those books that you'll just have to read for yourself to find out what I mean.
Just read it.
