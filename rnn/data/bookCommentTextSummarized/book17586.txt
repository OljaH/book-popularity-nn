He has convinced himself that he is supposed to be the common man's author2.
And they have to be cliched and not too intricate - because the common man's life is just not complicated enough for a Dostoevskian treatment (god forbid!), or for a "literary treatment"4.
Having worked out his grand role thus, this self-appointed common man's author sits down to write.2.
Being a celebrity in this country is license to be an expert on anything, and he gets disproportionate voice in the media, though usually a shrill and mildly pompous one.
I see that some folks have already rated this book, when it hasn't even been released.
But I've read enough reviews to conclude that the reactions are generally polarised.
Just edit it and you have your own review ready.Reaction 1: Loved itCB rocks!!!
Wen i used to see his ads in papers with free chapters, i was like, 'yeaaaaah CB's new book is coming out!' n mom wud say, 'Don't get excited, it's called an editorial'.
But hey, you know what, at least it's 'intellectual'.P.S. This is just a tongue-in-cheek review to entertain folks who are waiting impatiently for the book release.
I generally refrain from reviewing books because I know the hard work that goes into penning down 250 odd pages of literature.
He considers the common Indian man to be IQ less, illogical and having no sense or appreciation of literature.There is no other way I can justify his coming up with 'Half Girlfriend'.I cannot fathom what moved Mr. Mohit Suri, who has already bought the rights of the novel for his next screen adaptation, to tears.
The only kind of tears this book can draw out is those out of sheer frustration!
And read it for my friend who said it was  great .Faced with this dilemma, I decided to read Half Girlfriend because I didn't want to be critical about something I hadn't read.So against all my better judgment, I picked up this book and started reading.I had found a screenshot making the rounds of social networks with some verrry derogatory remark to the female protagonist and it had made me really angry.
Anyway, let's meet the Madhav - A horny, eyebrow fetishist basketball player who is also a prince of some random place in Bihar.He "falls in love with Riya" as soon as he sees her playing basketball.
- Like you really really need to mention it!!Why it always have to be the same cycle: • Humara bechara helpless Hero[Our poor helpless Hero] (**Zero) – Check• The antique Heroine (**Jisko pyaar karne main koi dikkat noi bas saath rehne main nakhra hain) – Check • Wahi ghisa pita college [Same old college scenes] – Check • Picking out one state of India [Iss baar Bihar ki baari hain] – Check• English language ki taarifein – Check• Detailed version of Heroine’s clothing (**lipstick ki brand taq pata hain humko thanks to CB!) – Check• And the usual story – Meeting – Talking – Falling for each other – Fighting – Not fighting – Running away – someone brings another one back – happy ending – spices added – sad ending!
I can envision thousands of youth in Bihar, who will never read "To Kill a Mocking Bird", but who will readily see themselves in Madhav and will have no difficulty in comprehending Bhagat's simplistic yet charming writing style.
And mind you, I am not a guy who reads "Only Chetan Bhagat Novels".
It's a different story altogether that a new "generation" of young writers flourished in India after Five Point Someone, trying to imitate Bhagat's style and ended up hurting his already many times questioned reputation.
Half Girlfriend is a very good read.
I like him as a writer (LOVE actually) but his stories never really get to me) Anyway, This book was about a guy called Madhav.
He meets divorced Riya again and she offers him help with his english as he had to make a speech for BILL GATES who was coming on a visit to India for sponsoring organisations working for the society's betterment.
This book was really really really making me LOVE ITThis is again when it started going down again!
A girl supposedly out of his league (and one page dedicated to the introduction her looks): Check3.
Guy's love at first sight (because of smell of her perfume or any random reason): Check4.
One page dedicated to the love making: Check7.
Weave a story around 1-6: Check'Friends with Benefits' or "I can walk Englis' is a more apt title for the book than Half Girlfriend, which might have happened because CB picked any two random consecutive words he saw on the first page he opened.This time, its a screenplay waiting for Deepika Padukone to accept the girl's role and the movie can kick-off to make 100cr.
Hah. I've read every Chetan Bhagat book(if we can call those sentences lumped together a book) only to argue with my friends as to why I absolutely depise his writing.
And every social media page is flooded with my friends( I may have to disown them after this) exclaiming "Chetan Bhagat - My favourite author" "The best author" and likewise idiotic comments.
Life's way too short to read shitty books like these when there are so many great books I still need to read as my shelf reminded me not so gently.

I thought Chetan Bhagat can't get worser than " Revolution 2020" but after reading his latest novel , Revolution 2020 feels like a better book. So,looking forward to his next novel so that I can feel that "half girlfriend" is a better one.
A Huge Putoff {eyes rolling}There are better books out there and there better writers out there! Even if you don't want to read Rushdie or Jhumpa Lahiri there are select few who write contemporary, interesting stories! I'd personally recommend Zero Defect if you want a fast paced, and thought provoking read.  There is also a lesser known (among indians) bookShantaram though not written by and indian author is an interesting contemporary book set in Mumbai.So, open your mind and read something be

I quote :: But I felt something deep inside, strong enough for my heart to say, You have to talk to this girl at least once in your life"**Crazy person Alert!**>They become friends>Guy wants to be more than friends>Girl says no>He thinks the only way to get her is to sleep with herThis is where I will stop.
Read the book at your own risk.
Chetan Bhagat has fallen to new found lows to write a book only in hopes of making it into a masala blockbuster movie.
With all due respect, only Half Star.
I am finally, actually finished with Bhagat and his scripts.
This was my most-difficult-to read-Bhagat, more than Three Mistakes of My Life or Revolution 2020 for that matter.
You see Chetan Bhagat and I go back a long way.
I felt obliged to read each book that Bhagat wrote.
Here's one for Science; take that you English Puritans!As to Half Girlfriend, well, the girl is sexy and hot in her shorts.
She is equally sexy and hot in salwar-kameez.
She is of course very beautiful and sexy and hot.
She doesn't want to have sex despite being so sexy and hot.
what a piece of trash..this book actually managed to fall short of my already meagre expectations.Chetan Bhagat has over-exploited way too many stereotypes in this book.The stuff about girls giggling senselessly at just about anything a rich guy says is especially repulsive.
I haven't read this, nor do I intend to. Funny that Goodreads allows people to rate books that haven't even released.
It is one of those books you just pick up and then cannot put down.
Mainly because you want believe in it.
You want to believe that such love still exists..
that fate gives your love a second chance.
I love how Chetan Bhagat writes.
Do not read this book if you are one of those who read to add to their literary shelves...
this is a simple book which can touch your heart and leave you with a smile on your face...it sure did on mine :)
All the scenes are so overdone in books and cinemas of the past that you feel they are plagiarized, like girlfriend is reading but the sun is on her, so you block the sun, girlfriend removes a rice grain from your face so you put more grains on it.
Also, I think Bhagat self assumes that he is the voice of this generation and he raises all sorts of issues through this book.
When you read this title you think it’s about friends with benefits or something like that, but this title has nothing to do with the story being told.

But some of these are not trash, vulgar and insults to literature – these are the actual "centers of a million flaming imaginations".I read Chetan Bhagat's books for their entertainment quotients, and this book is high on it.
And if one takes up this book without a Literary Snob's judgmental hat (irrespective of whether or not she has actually read what she believes to be good literature), she would conclude that this is indeed a good story.This book reads more like a screenplay of a Hindi movie, a bit exaggerated but entertaining one at that.
Half of that particular thing, according to me is pointless and useless.
I just don't understand what intrigued me to buy this IITian's stupid-desi-just-written-for-the-sake-of-bollywood novel that revolves around pointless-meaningless HALF- RELATIONSHIP between the Bihari Madhav & moody Riya of St.Stevens, New Delhi.
I feel naive to call that a relationship at the first place.Even before the release of the book & just with the start of pre-ordering, Chetan Bagat announced his director for this desi-love story with Deepika Padukone & Arjun Kapoor in the lead roles, as I expected :D Dear Chetan, you're not a national sensation anymore when it comes to contemporary writings.
of course the protagonist is noble , someone similar to the one in revolution 2020.
to be only interested in kissing the girl with out knowing anything about her( in fact learns it all later)and by the way title is just a tiny portion of the whole narration( of the style this happened and then that happened )Poor english but who cares when a movie can be made out of it.
Ugh!And by making English the subject of the book which hardly it is as the girl never has a problem with his english and its a love story in the end, CB got an extra excuse to write badly.
I am certain this book will be a blockbuster, a game changer of sorts and Chetan Bhagat will continue to dish out overtly dramatized Bollywood scripts as novels.
Clearly, Chetan Bhagat's book dishing software likes Game of Thrones.
So after 262 pages of a very mediocre love story, it ends in the most Chetan Bhagat-ish way possible...
At this point you, as a reader would be aware of certain facts about Chetan Bhagat, he loves horny dudes, he loves drama, he loves impromptu making out sessions and he loves happy endings, so much so that he scripts the most ridiculous twist and brings a character out from the dead.
The only reason I am giving this book two stars is because I am a huge fan of Chetan Bhagat and love his books but this book was nothing more than a waste of time and a huge disappointment.
There was not much of a story plot and the entire plot felt as though it was overly exaggerated.I love Chetan Bhagat's writing but in this book it felt too monotonous and the story,the writing everything felt as though I have already read it several times (which I probably did in all his other books!!).
Nothing about the book feels original or makes you fall in love with the characters.
Half Girlfriend is a story about a boy meets a girl and falls in love. Madhav is a boy from Bihar, who doesn't know much English. Riya is a girl from high society and speaks fluent English.I have enjoyed previous books by Chetan Bhagat but honestly, this book didn't click much.
I started reading Chetan's books when I was in my 10th grade (around 2008).
It all started when my friends used to gush and discuss at length about his books.
And with those gush fests piquing my curiosity, I gave it a go.
Few years down the line when I re-read those books, I realized what an idiot I have been all through.
Every book of Chetan's has the same old story, just few sex scenes peppered here and there.
He should probably stop writing books and write stories for Bollywood movies.
I don't know why I gave even that one star.
Note : I am not one of those arm chair intellectuals who 'hates' Chetan Bhagat and his books.
Well played Mr. Bhagat.Got the book on it's release date itself, thanks to the quick and prompt delivery by Flipkart.
Yes. Well written in the sense that Mr. Bhagat writes stuff with incredible detail so that it is fairly easy for the reader to picturize in mind what is going on.
The language is pretty simple too, but this book is way ahead of Bhagat's earlier works in terms of literary quality.
Too much complexity, and not in a good way.I have multiple problems with the book.
