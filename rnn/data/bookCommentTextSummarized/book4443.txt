I guess I'm fickle.This title is now my favourite Georgette Heyer mystery.What's not to love?
My favourite Watson (Hemingway) is now the Sherlock, a colourful & very funny cast, including the murder victim.
I was chuckling right through the read, especially the scene where (view spoiler)[Vicki decides it's time to get rid of the Prince!
(hide spoiler)] I really think this would make a wonderful made for TV movie, especially if they play it as a farce.& I have at least made a start on the casting.
He has the quick wit & puckish charm I associate with Hemingway.The histrionic yet charming Vicki.
However, on reading this novel, the first Inspector Hemingway mystery - first published in 1939 - I was really impressed and enjoyed this much more than the previous mystery I had tried.In some ways, this is a typical country house murder.
When a murder occurs, it is up to Inspector Hemingway to find a way beneath the tangled financial issues, the various scandals and issues between the characters, strange occurrences at a recent shooting party, the constant amateur theatrics of Vicky, plus Ermyntrude’s hysterics, to try to solve the crime.
One of the pleasures of reading is that you can do things through books you'd never want to do in real life - like climb Mt. Everest or survive a concentration camp.
I'm thankful I've never spent the weekend with a fortune-hunting Russian Prince, a young man who despises his father and insists on telling everyone about it, and a girl who treats all of life as dramatic theater - not to mention a murderer.
Yet I find time spent with this book delightful.
The characters are fun and the plot moves along well.
It's fun to do the same.
**Yawn**This was not one of Heyer's better mysteries.
I found it tedious and slow with absolutely no suspense.
There wasn't anything for us to be excited over (unless you like meltdowns/melodrama ), nobody else was threatened, the victim wasn't liked and frankly, the person it ends up being wasn't a surprise.
And there weren't any REAL clues for us to become excited over.
*Yawn* Its always a bad sign when you find a book so tiresome you start skimming and flipping chunks.
And even that was too slow.
**Yawn**
Wally Carter is a corpse in waiting. Never have so many suspects gathered to justifiably kill off a vile bounder since Murder on the Orient Express. The characters were wonderfully quirky, the dialog was amusing and the plot just twisty enough to keep me engaged. Lots of fun and just what I was in the mood for.
This was also my first “proper’ Heyer mystery since the only other one I’ve read Penhallow while it did have a murder and some element of mystery, this lasted only for part of the book which was more a character study than a whodunit (though a very good one nonetheless).The wealthy Ermyntrude Carter is married to Wally Carter, her second husband who sponges off her, lending her money to his cronies she disapproves of, particularly Harold White, enters shady deals (with the said Mr White), and is not above entanglements either―in other words, not a very savoury person at all.
It's no secret that Wally Carter married Ermyntrude for her money and in the last two years since their marriage, his deplorable behavior has gotten worse.
Ermyntrude's daughter Vicky has returned home from school, ready to play any role at a moment's notice and eager to take in the drama between her mother and step-father.
The prince, who wants to marry Ermyntrude?
The lovesick, hot tempered farmer in love with Ermyntrude?
I was wishing Wally dead not long after I began the novel.
The only characters I actually liked were Mary and Hemingway.
A buddy read with my friend Jemidar and worth closer to 3 1/2 stars.
The third last novel in my 2011 Heyer mysteries reading project, this is neither my favourite nor my least favourite of these novels.
As with all of Heyer's mysteries - and most of her other novels - this novel features seriously eccentric characters who engage in witty banter while doing strange things.
But, for someone dedicated to reading Heyer's entire oeuvre, or for someone dedicated to reading as many examples of 1930s mysteries as possible, it's not a bad way to while away a few hours.
The story begins with the introduction to the setting, characters, their backstories and goes along sometime building to the point where the murder occurs and then after a time the detective enters and investigates before arriving at the solutions while along the way there is a bit of comedy, drama, and some romance among the players.This is Heyer so of course the cast was a colorful and interesting group, the dialogue was fun, the development was good and the romance subtle.
I would definitely listen to more of her narration work.All in all, my first venture into a mystery by Georgette Heyer was a good one and I'll definitely pick up the others.
I would suggest to any reader not to make this your first Heyer mystery, however.Surprisingly enough, after having recently stated in my review for The Unfinished Clue that I can never manage to deduce whodunit, I was able to peg this killer down almost as soon as the deed was done, by a pretty obvious choice of words by Heyer.
Given the fact that I am horrible at deduction, I can only conclude that this murder mystery was poorly constructed by Heyer.I wasn't as impressed by the cast of suspects in this novel.
Heyer is being very interested in distinctions of class here, ranging her characters from county to not quite-quite to rather suss and there is definitely something a little uncomfortable about how the county are privately amused by Ermyntrude but willing to associate with her to get money out of her.There is a lot of humour to be had out of the character of Vicki, who is rather similar to Neville from A Blunt Instrument - deliberately provocative and ruthlessly willing to upturn social convention in a good cause.
Period piece who-dun-it.
Shooting, dinner, bridge and the country set.
The man of the house, Wally, seems to be always biting off more than his intellect can understand.
And he isn't the root of the money tree.
His wife is.A number of possible suspects and at least two young women in the marriage market.It's ok, and cuts a time warp like photo in a frame for the good weather "country life" of the wealthy English before WWI.
Not compared to Heyer's Regency marriage market set of women.
Much better to stick to her dozen or so Regency escapades.
Who may not be the brightest person but her good nature,generosity,and kindness make up for it and I love her character.Drama and all.
It's always nice to have a sensible character among all the others who have a flair of drama about them.
Georgette Heyer's characters and writing style know no equal.
I never read any of her books without laughing and smiling though most of it.I like that the murder doesn't happen intil 100 and some pages in.
If you enjoy Heyer's writing or her other mysteries or just are looking for a good mystery I would recommend this book.Rating:4 out of 5Content Rating: PGKeeper: Yes
Buddy read with Kim :-).A lighthearted cosy mystery full of wonderfully eccentric people, high drama, red herrings and a very clever 'howdunit.' Definitely keeps you guessing to the end. Not your usual detective novel, but great fun all the same.
I repeat I am not a fan of detective books. But I must admit it is hard not to like Heyer's detective books (although I am saying it after reading only two of them).I used to think that if one had taken a romance from Heyer's novels there would have remained not many of her charm. But it isn't true.This book was a perfect Heyer's charm. Funny, light, enjoyable, entertaining. Reading it I wasn't only solving the mystery, I was enjoying charming language, meeting amusing characters and simply I have had a good time with the witty book.
This review is for the audiobook edition only.Ulli Birve did a fine job narrating this mystery overall. In particular, her voice for Ermentrude was excellent. However, for a few of the male characters (such as the butler Peake and Inspector Cook), her narration was at times wooden.
2.5 stars.Not one of Ms Heyer's better works. I had to rewind a couple of times in the beginning because there were too many characters being established with their background stories. Took too long to get to the actual crime. Only the last 1/3 of the book was interesting once the investigation started.
This time I knew what was coming and still enjoyed it very much, I just saw lost patience with some of the slower patches (basically any scene without the mighty Ermyntrude and her fabulously precocious daughter Vicky!) Still recommended as a highly entertaining take on the British Golden Age country house murder mystery.July 2015 reread, 5 stars: I read somewhere recently that much of the pleasure in reading a great book is reading it at the right time, and that was certainly true for me in this case!
Wow, this was not the book that I was hoping to read. I struggled, literally struggled, to finish this book. The problem---way too much verbage (not a word, I know). The descriptions of dinners, clothes, you name it, was so over the top that I felt like screaming. You could read pages and nothing happened. I won't be rushing out to read another mystery by Heyer, but I will continue to read her Regency romance books because I really did enjoy those.
The solution is, perhaps, a bit more convoluted than is strictly necessary, but it's still a fun story.I've mentioned before that I have a very soft spot for Ms. Heyer's mysteries (and her delightful characters), and this book is no exception.
See, Heyer favors female characters with good minds, sharp tongues, and a lively sense of humor.
Meanwhile, under all that drama, Vicky has a fairly sharp brain and a lively sense of humor, as well as a genuine desire to shield her mother from mistreatment.
The superlatively analytical Inspector Hemingway reveals his unnerving talent for solving a fiendish problem.Either Heyer is back on form in this one or I'm feeling better....in the last mystery I read by her the characters all seemed a little too much.
The internal bickering is back on target, there are plenty of motives and red herrings, and though it soon becomes obvious who the culprit is (if you use your vintage mystery logic) it's still a puzzle as to how s/he did it.The most enjoyable part of this novel for me was the interactions of Ermyntrude and her daughter, Vicky Fanshawe, with the rest of the characters.
The Prince was such a stereotypical charming character but had a phony side to him that made him enjoyable to read, especially his behavior towards Ermyntrude, it was obvious he was after her, but it was just funny to see him try and get her attention.A few criticisms about this book, well the plot is a little slow but it's to give you a proper introduction to the characters and a way to get you to know them more so the mystery will work out perfectly.
Well, That Was A Thing That Happened....I am a  huge  fan of   Georgette Heyer's Historical Romances, especially her Regencies, which are comedies of manners with a bit of love and a lot of humor. I cannot count the number of times I've read   VENETIA,   THE GRAND SOPHY,   FREDERICA,   ARABELLA,   THE NONESUCH and   FALSE COLOURS - I have them in hardcover, paperback (multiple versions), and eBook (which at least the pages don't fall out of if you re-re-read it too much!). So - you'd think I wou
Georgette Heyer's Historical Romances, especially her Regencies, which are comedies of manners with a bit of love and a lot of humor.
So - you'd think I would also be a fan of her mysteries, largely written in the 1930s, right...?NO WIND OF BLAME takes forever to get around to killing its sole victim - the irresponsible spendthrift skirt-chasing husband of an aging actress who married money, then when he died found Our Oh-So-Deserving Dead Body To Be as Hubby #2!
If this were a Heyer Regency that wouldn't be a problem, as they have even less action but are chock-full of engaging and colorful characters to spend time with - here, though, the characters have their quirks but are neither engaging nor especially colorful.
Having only read one of her mysteries before, I must say I was pleased with this one too (though it is certainly a slower boil than Behold, Here's Poison) as her characters are always delightful, the dialogue/banter witty and engaging and one can't help but feel very sorry for the Inspectors having to deal with this particular set of melodramatic country gentry.
The one bad thing about reading this mystery however is that I spent the first part of the book waiting for one of the character's to die in order for the mystery to begin.
Maybe it was just me being hopeful throughout but I was quite pleased with how things ended up for the characters.
Wally Carter, his ward Mary, his wife Ermyntrude, and her daughter Vicky are an odd bunch.
Whodunit?Vicky, the flighty would-be actress who loves her mother?Mary, Wally's sensible yet much put-upon ward?Ermyntrude, Wally's wife, who has other suitors for her hand and has just discovered something ugly about Wally?Hugh, Mary's friend who is sarcastic and clever enough to hide just about anything?The Doctor, who Ermyntrude "did a good turn" in the past and has mysterious mood swings?The Prince, who wants to marry Ermyntrude for her money?Mr. Steel, who wants to marry Ermyntrude for herself?Mr. White, who owes Wally a great deal of money?Mr. Baker, who threatened Wally just the day before?Or one of the many supporting characters?
This started off well, there were some interesting characters and the feel of the book was good, however it didn't completely satisfy - too many other characters were added further along, some completely unessessary.
I did enjoy Ermintrude though, what hysterics!
Also Vicky who enjoyed posing.
Started off thinking Mary was a sensible character, but she lost it for me later on when she just disolved for no apparent reason.
Inspector Hemingway was good Scotland Yard material, and I enjoyed the way he solved the puzzle (even if I was there before him).
I liked the first book I read from this author (Footsteps in the Dark) so much that I knew this one wasn't going to be able to meet the same standards.
Most of the characters I didn't care about, including the man who gets killed, and I felt like it took SO long to get to the actual murder mystery that I almost lost interest in the book completely.
I did like the Scotland Yard inspector though so I will definitely read the rest of the books involving his character and hope they get a little better.
This author didn't write many mysteries, which is too bad because this one was wonderful. She specialized in writing romance but don't think her mysteries follow that mold. The plot was excellent, the characters great fun and the ending satisfying. If you like British mystery a bit on the cozy side with humor and eccentric characters you'll LOVE this one.
A very enjoyable read. I didn't guess who the murderer was which is a plus for me.
Will Carter is a man who isn't well liked, he married for money and he spends it like there's no tomorrow. When he is shot dead there are plenty of suspects. The first in the Inspector Hemingway (formerly known as Sergeant), No Wind of Blame takes its time to get anywhere, I found this the least likeable of the Hannayside/Hemingway books.
