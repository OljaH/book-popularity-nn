A passable book about the "true" story of Billy the Kid by an author who was a contempory of the Kid. It's a short read and is pretty much a series of vignettes of the Kid's life. It's a much better read if you are familiar with the movies Young Guns I and II.
He was awful and I found no nobility in him. Good reading by the narrator.
Written in 1920. There was a style to books of that era. Just kind of "the facts" nothing but the facts. But it is also nearly 40 years after events. Seen John Wayne in Chisum one too many times. So had to read about the Lincoln County War and Billy the Kid. More of the movie is based on fact than I thought.
After reading the intro, I thought this book would be told as if from some old timer in a bar. To my surprise it read like a long newspaper article stating mostly facts with some commentary. It was a quick read great for a before a afternoon nap.
Read this while getting ready to go to New Mexico.
Story from eye witnesses, written about 1920
This is a historical book written by someone who actually knew and met "Billy the Kid". However, the writing is very poor and really could have been jazzed up a great deal with a co-author.
The historical information is good but way to many spelling errors
