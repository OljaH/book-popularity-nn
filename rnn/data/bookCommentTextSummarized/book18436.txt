It is not a stand alone, but rather it completed the story of Beautiful Disaster allowing you to experience the full extent of Travis’ all-consuming love for Abby.There are extra scenes at the beginning and end that weren’t mentioned at all in BD and a few scattered throughout the book but for the most part, it follows the story we already know and love but tells the other side.
Almost like she was both hanging on to every word, and amazed that I knew how to read.” You really get to see the complete “Travis” picture with this book – you see his hope, his pain, his anger, and his desperate love for and need for acceptance by this one girl who has completely taken over his heart.
If she didn’t look absolutely sexy like that, it might have worked, but her skin was impeccable, and the lack of makeup and the frames of her glasses just made her eye color stand out even more.“It’s about time you showed up,” I said, falling onto my couch.At first she seemed proud of her idea, but as we talked and I remained impervious, it was clear that she knew her plan had failed.
Her embarrassment was immediately replaced by irritation, something I was far more comfortable with.America suggested watching TV, but the last thing I wanted to do was to be in a room with Abby, unable to talk to her.
The fact this even EXISTS!

Don't forget to check out the Playlist at the end of this review  Walking Disaster is Travis's POV From Beautiful Disaster  by Jamie McGuire.
And when you read this story you'll see it that there is a lot more to him than beautiful disaster shows!i really think that Jamie is a poor writer, i mean okay she created BD which EVERYONE LOVED but...
now okay Walking disaster explained A LOT but still how could she knows that she would be able to write from his POV , i really think that book should have been better, but nevertheless i gave it 5 stars because i loved the idea of it .
Plus HELPFUL ADVICE when reading this book.5 Mega stars for TRAVIS3 Stars for content and executionEquals 4 overall starsI'm so glad  Crista and I decided to do a buddy read of Walking Disaster for the blog  Swept Away By Romance.
I'm simply saying that Walking Disaster is STRICTLY a companion book to Beautiful Disaster.
Walking Disaster enhances Beautiful Disaster's love story, nothing more.
That said, the story is somewhat disjointed and for the general reader to fully appreciate and get the most from this book, I recommend the following: • YOU MUST READ BEAUTIFUL DISASTER FIRST.
NO SPOILERS for anyone who hasn't read Beautiful Disaster yet, and if you are thinking of starting this series, even if they are both sort of the same, I do recommend you start with Beautiful Disaster first :) My Review of Beautiful Disaster can be found here.This is a dysfunctional Romance.And just like in my review of  Beautiful Disaster , I will quote Deb Caletti“Love at first sight should send you running, if you know what's good for you. It's your dark pieces having instant recognition with
Travis, on the other hand, is completely tattooed (which is not a bad thing, but in the eyes of our society these days, it isn’t exactly the best thing) he’s messy, temperamental, sleeps around with many girls and most definitely wants to be with Abby.
I sort of hated really disliked Abby in this book?Travis’s point of view was a little bit difficult to read.
All in all it was a good book, and I definitely recommend it to anyone that enjoyed Beautiful Disaster, it really helps you understand Travis and see this love story from a new perspective :)************************(This part was written when Walking Disaster had first been announced) *Cover Update!*That cover!This book!!!Wait - 2013?
The was time I head want really the I and seriously only couch angry one thing don't sigh bad can't 
7. Copy - Paste - PublishJamie McGuire plagiarised substantial chunks of Beautiful Disaster and marketed this as a new book.
Either he became an even bigger asshole and started referring to himself in third person (not entirely unbelievable come to think of it) or Jamie McGuire didn't even bother to edit her blatant copy and pastes.
As I was reading WD, I was hoping to get to know Travis, understand him and maybe like him.
He honestly speaks like an immature virgin with no sexual experience whatsoever.Now the thing that made me want to punch Travis in the face...6.
*full review to come* oohhh lalala ... buttercup !!!how i love that picture. thats how i pictured travis and pigeon in my mind <3 :D :pbut its too far awayyyyy [image error]
2013???20FREAKING13Am I being testedWhat did I do to deserve thisUGH!!![image error]I just can't...
Travis calls every woman (except for Abby) who shows an interest in him a vulture, and instead of saying "we had sex" or "we banged" or even "we fucked", he goes for the charming "I bagged her".
She's pretty much the definition of hot-and-cold.If I ever had the chance to speak to Travis - to tell him only one sentence - it'd be kind of obvious, seeing as my hatred for him knows no bounds.Okay, I know Petyr Baelish probably isn't the best person to tell someone to go fuck themselves, but give me a break.Travis is literally one of the worst male characters I've ever encountered in all my years of reading.
We could finally get inside the head of The Travis Maddox and he’s the one I consider as my first ever book-boyfriend so squeal for the excitement and expectations.Walking Disaster follows exactly the plot line of Beautiful Disaster but the new lines and dialogues and parts makes my reading experience seems like I was reading an entirely new book.
They quite picked up my interest after reading this one.I gave Walking Disaster 5 star rating but that doesn’t mean I don't have a bit of hesitations or comments or not so good thing about it such as:Why Travis is head-over-heels in love with Abby?
5 Stars <3 I’m going to start right off and say... If you loved Beautiful Disaster, you will love this! If you didn’t love Beautiful Disaster (depending on the reason) you still may love this! Being in Travis’s head was way better than Abby’s :DMy Travis and Abby  “You’re not her type”“I’m everyone’s type!”   “It just sucks that I finally found the girl worth having and she’s too good for me.” It was great to see Travis’s pov! Now, I have a lot of book boyfriends, I’ll be the first to admit i
If you loved Beautiful Disaster, you will love this!
If you didn’t love Beautiful Disaster (depending on the reason) you still may love this!
Being in Travis’s head was way better than Abby’s :DMy Travis and Abby
But Travis has been towards the top of the list since I read BD around a year ago!
I know April 2nd can’t come fast enough...
“You can’t tell me what to do anymore, Travis!
but one of the best parts of this book- There is an epilogue!
A good one that takes place years after BD ends!!!
I thought people would think I went into this to "hate read", but honestly it was more academic (okay, maybe a little bit for the snark and pending train wreck, but not primarily).One of the things I wanted to do in this pre-review was write a fanfic-ish dialogue between characters that I would consider my "book boyfriends" trying to determine why Travis wouldn't make it into a formal "Order" of sorts.
EVEN JUST SEEING THE FREAKING TITLE MAKES ME SWOON!! I NEED THIS BOOK NOW. 2013?! Jamie McGuire, you're killing me here girlfriend.
I decided a long time ago I would feed on the vultures until a dove came along . A pigeon. Travis“Abby being in my room made it feel like home, and the emptiness no longer seemed right.”AbbyOMG this book was amazing . Even though I was reading the same story being in Travis head was an amazing experience .Travis for the first time in his life is getting overwhelmed by a girl.She is brave , intelligent and beautiful but he knows that she is hiding something from him. In the beginning his only pu
It's hard to forget Travis and Abby after these books.I cried , I laughed , I loved Travis and I'm really glad that I read these books."Each anniversery was a victory.A middle finger to everyone who thought we wouldnt last.Even though we'd pull each other through hellwe'd found heaven."["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>
So, I just finished devouring “Beautiful Disaster,” which was told in Abby’s POV, and discovered this companion book told in Travis’ POV. Having already fallen head over heals for Travis, this read was a no brainer for me. I couldn’t wait to get inside his head and hear him tell his side of the story.Travis is so adorably adorable it is insane. This flawed, beautiful man proved time and time again he would go to any lengths to prove his love. Ahhhhh, the deepest  sigh!! Even though you are re-re
I couldn’t wait to get inside his head and hear him tell his side of the story.Travis is so adorably adorable it is insane.
Even though you are re-reading the same storyline as “Beautiful Disaster,” it just felt new because Travis was giving his account of the events, and told from a totally different perspective.
And speaking of which, each brother has their own “Beautiful” book that I cannot wait to dive into.
Luckily this series has been out for a few years, so all the books are available.Catch you later, as I have four more delectable Maddox brothers waiting in the wings to swoon over!!
Wait, this is gonna be a series?   After the absolute fucking train wreck that was Beautiful Disaster, there is seriously gonna be another one.    Excuse me, I've gotta go throw up.  What the actual fuck?   Well, fuck. Book one was fucked up enough. Now we get book two. This is bound to be EVEN MORE fucked up because - of course - it's from our beloved disgusting, STD ridden male lead, Travis. Travis is a sick fuck. He is psycho. He is a stalker. He is obsessive. He is in dire need of anger mana
After the absolute fucking train wreck that was Beautiful Disaster, there is seriously gonna be another one.
Book one was fucked up enough.
This is bound to be EVEN MORE fucked up because - of course - it's from our beloved disgusting, STD ridden male lead, Travis.
Travis is a sick fuck.
Abby doesn't give a fuck about Travis' controlling nature.
She lets Travis control her.
And I'm telling you all right now, THAT'S NOT FUCKING NORMAL.Dear Abby,Simply because you're SO infuriating,
I mean, it's only a matter of time before Travis bashes the fuck out of you.
Again I repeat myself, maybe it was only because I knew the whole story and therefor maybe I experienced it differently :) But that doesn't change my rating and I did find it amazing because I was finally in his head!I read so many reviews of "Beautiful Disaster", lots of them bad and lots of them good.
Girl, you have got some nerve! I've never been one of those people to highlight into oblivion while reading, but girl, did I regret not highlighting the fuck out of Beautiful Disaster! Let me point out that I read it a couple of months ago and only read it once. Apart from the memory of reading a book walking the thin line between something I am indifferent to and something I hate, there is nothing else about this book that lingers in my mind. So, imagine my frustration when I start reading Wal
I've never been one of those people to highlight into oblivion while reading, but girl, did I regret not highlighting the fuck out of Beautiful Disaster!
But think about all the people who actually liked Beautiful Disaster and became your fans.
I actually have a sweet small example here:Beautiful Disaster:"We did the dishes together in silence, with Toto asleep at our feet.
He dried the last dish and set it in the rack and then led me down the hall, holding my hand a bit too tight."Walking Disaster:"We did the dishes together in silence, with Toto asleep at our feet.
Either way, it seemed the moment I met her, my life had been turned upside down.
And I didn’t want it any other way.”I honestly didn’t know what to expect with this one because of the fact that it’s basically the same story told in the first book, but it turned out to be much more than that.
There were new scenes included and readers will obtain a deep understanding into what’s made Travis the the way that he is and just how much he truly loves Abby.This is a page turner that’s written well and easy to read.
Travis! <3 The RD can't come soon enough! UPDATE:Travis Maddox… Gosh, how I missed ya. (ღ⌣ღ)I loved being in Travis’ head. Seeing the story of him and Abby through his eyes was like chocolate cake for my shipper heart. I enjoyed the book very much, yet at times something didn’t feel quite right. I was missing something and I didn’t know exactly what until the “goodbye sex” scene or rather the morning after, when Travis’ world came crashing down on him for the first time. Angst! I was missi
UPDATE:Travis Maddox… Gosh, how I missed ya.
I enjoyed the book very much, yet at times something didn’t feel quite right.
I was missing something and I didn’t know exactly what until the “goodbye sex” scene or rather the morning after, when Travis’ world came crashing down on him for the first time.
I was missing angst—that feeling us girls yearn for in every romantic movie or book.
Walking Disaster is a must read for every Travis & Pigeon fan, but it didn’t quite reach the level of emotions I was feeling while reading Beautiful Disaster.
So.  It all started quite a few months ago when I was quietly going about my business. Until something hit me like a sledgehammer in the head.This.  Then of course half the reading community seemed to hate it, so obviously that seemed to be my call.That resulted into one day of obsessive reading till I was stumbling my way through normal people activities the next day:  And all-day fantasies about bare-chested, tattoo-clad, gorgeous, manwhore 20-year-old fighters:  While desperately trying to cl
While desperately trying to cling on to little fragments of patience till the HE-POV came out.
Until 4 days ago, when my dormant fantasies took the reins of my weak and feeble restraint and I was plunged (wholeheartedly) into the head of this crazy-assed, son of a bitch Travis Maddox.
Unable to restrain myself, I reached out for Abby, wrapped her small frame in my arms, and planted my lips on hers.
I put so much force behind my words, I could feel all the blood rush to my face.
“I belong to you,” I whispered, my anger fading as desire took over.
My Travis and his Pigeon: "Leaving emotions at the door, and replacing it with numbness, or anger - which was much easier to control - was easy. Letting yourself feel made you vulnerable." This is Travis's motto. He thinks that people ruled by emotions are weak. He is rough boy, living carefree life, depending on noone. He has his ideal girl dreamed-of in his head, he has just never met her yet. Until Abby comes into his life. She is different, refreshing and she doesn't succumb to his charms as
He thinks that people ruled by emotions are weak.
He is rough boy, living carefree life, depending on noone.
He has his ideal girl dreamed-of in his head, he has just never met her yet.
Until Abby comes into his life.
Being it Travis's head was unforgettable experience.
I wished author paid more attention to storytelling and editing and tidied up the flow of the story to make reading more enjoyable experience for her readers.* I received ARC from NetGalley as an exchange for honest review *More reviews on my blog 
This second book in the “Beautiful “ series is done in Travis’s POV!!
I have been planning to read the Maddox brothers series but I first wanted to refresh my memory on the romance of Travis and Abby!
I really became angry with her on how she treated Travis!
Even with my annoyance with Abby though, I still enjoyed this read and now I’m eager to continue on to be in the world of the Maddox brothers!
If they are anything like Travis, I’m in for some swoon worthy reads!!!

In short it's a retelling of Beautiful Disaster in Travis' POV.
a lot!But even with all it's "flaws" the Epilogue was what made it worth it and if anything we got to see what Abby did to poor boy and fall more in love with him.
A big, relaxing breath moved my chest up and down slowly as I fell asleep next to the second woman I’d ever loved.
[image error]~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~Wheeeeeeeeee peeks into Married Life of Mr & Mrs MaddoxValentine's Day 
Me too, Britney. Me too. I think I suffered from high expectations on this one. I thought we were going to get all this new information about their relationship and I didn't feel like that happened. I felt like a lot of the conversations were the same almost verbatim but with pronouns changed. I understand I will probably be in the minority on this and would appreciate people not jumping on me. :)I will say, that the epilogue completely saved me and I had a huge smile on my face when I finished

I'd like to start this review by raising a toast to the most infuriating, dysfunctional, addictive, up and down, head over heels in love couple in the history of book writing ~ To Travis and Abby, long live your messed up Love, you have entertained and horrified your readers in equal measure and I can't help but love it and here are my thoughts ...I had funny tummy, girly yummy feelings throughout this book.
Love him or loathe him Travis Maddox is a character never to be forgotten.Travis MaddoxAbby AbernathyI was Crying at the Prologue, feeling forever at the Epilogue and addicted with all that in between ~ truly unforgettable.
