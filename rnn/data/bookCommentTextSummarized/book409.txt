What did he fear? It was not a fear or dread. It was a nothing that he knew too well. It was all a nothing and man was a nothing too. An old man drinking alone. A man that won't leave, a young waiter in a hurry to go home to his wife and another waiter. It is as simple as that. The complexity that left me stunned lies beneath that simple plot that unfolds with the help of Hemingway's characteristic style. And, once more, the economy of words cannot tame the torrent of emotions that can take ove
The complexity that left me stunned lies beneath that simple plot that unfolds with the help of Hemingway's characteristic style.
Some people try to divert their attention away from the loud silence of introspection, so they focus on work.
Some people pour brandy into a shiny glass, feeling the silence of the night in a clean, well-lighted place.
They watch the rest of humanity facing their loneliness and try to provide a clean place with decent light to those in need.
They face their loneliness helping other to face theirs, in the best way possible.
A man in the vastness of this universe; nothing.
Does Hemingway's writing still have power? Can it still move us or does it seem hopelessly stilted and dated? I'd begun to wonder that lately so I picked up this short story and...wow. The rhythm of Hemingway's descriptive language is masterful, his sentences like little incantations, and while the dialog might seem a bit stylized--you can't quite imagine people talking this way--it has a unique spare beauty to it nonetheless, like a stylized church painting. There's so much bound up in this story--aging, loneliness, empathy, despair. It's few pages contain multitudes.
I read this because I couldn't sleep, and the people in this book, mostly old, don't want to sleep. I guess sleeping sucks, maybe there's nothing much to wake up for, maybe they're hardcore nihilists, maybe Hemmingway was sober while writing this. It doesn't matter, sleeping sucks.
"A Clean, Well Lighted Place" is absolutely the best short story of all time, and the greatest thing I have ever read. I know that's a big statement but I really believe it to be utterly perfect. It's one of the most heartbreaking, intimate stories I've ever read and it captures a lifetime of humility, loneliness, and our ability as humans to be both the source of pain and salvation for each other - all in 3 pages. It will stay with you forever.
A solid short story that addresses suicide, aging, and the importance of having a purpose in one's life.
As you can discern from my reviews over the past couple of months, I have a lot of problems with Hemingway and his writing.
However, I appreciate that he tackles difficult topics in a way that confronts the darkest aspects of the human experience.
His work, including this story, emphasizes the importance of mental well-being, of connecting with one another's hardships and humanity.
I hope we can all find our own clean, well-lighted place - and that we can provide that place for one another.
I am literally speechless. I'm positive that this is my favorite short story that I've read so far.
Perfect three pages.Simple yet deep. But a few pages filled with loneliness, humanity, depression, empathy and indifference .... the impatience of youth and the small things that make an otherwise meaningless life still worth living. Classic, nostalgic, moving .... almost lyrical.
Hemingway didn't say what has happened to the latter after the young waiter (who wants to go home already and sleep) refused him another drink and drove him away.
The old one explains: old, like the customer, he is one of those who like to stay late at the cafe, in clean, well-lighted cafes, "with all those who do not want to go to bed, (with) all those who need a light for the night."Had someone close to him known that Hemingway needed a clean, well-lighted place to drink late in the night, his suicide could probably have been prevented.
A story about three men at different states of their lives; two waiters of a cafe (one young, one older) and an old man as a customer.
The old man is living in a state of despair and loneliness, having recently attempted suicide.
It is because of this that he wants to keep the cafe open because he knows that it is a clean, well-lighted place.
This proves even more tragic; even though people suffer from the same thing, they all go through it alone.Hemingway shows the transition of youth to elderly in correlation with happiness to loneliness, hopelessness and despair by using the younger waiter, older and the old man.
From the short story collectionThe Best Short Stories of the Modern AgeDouglas Angus
James Joyce once remarked: "Hemingway has reduced the veil between literature and life, which is what every writer strives to do."
How lonely, depressed and indifferent an old man can be?
I'd read it forever
Hail nothing full of nothing, nothing is with thee. This book is one of those rare exceptions in Hemingway's work that I didn't hate reading.I enjoyed how absurd everything seems but is not, there's no real conflict or an objective or any resolution but then as the writer said- nada y pues nada y nada y pues nada Just another nocturnal scene involving a couple of otro loco mas insomniacs, how they differ or relate to one another and to this old gaffer, who seems nonchalant, high and cares about
Hail nothing full of nothing, nothing is with thee. This book is one of those rare exceptions in Hemingway's work that I didn't hate reading.I enjoyed how absurd everything seems but is not, there's no real conflict or an objective or any resolution but then as the writer said-

Just another nocturnal scene involving a couple of otro loco mas insomniacs, how they differ or relate to one another and to this old gaffer, who seems nonchalant, high and cares about nothing.BE like the old boy!
Analysis of the two major characters in A Clean, Well-Lighted Place by Ernest Hemingway (DOES contain spoilers) One of the major and most ostensible distinctions between the two major characters (the two waiters) in Hemingway’s short story is the age difference. One of the waiters is “younger” and the other is “older”, probably a middle-aged man. They are both keeping watch of their last customer, an old man who drinks to excess, and discussing the fact that he had tried to commit suicide.  Alth
The younger waiter refuses to offer the old man another drink, saying that he wants to go home to his wife who is waiting in bed for him.
This all indicates that he is not lonely like the middle-aged waiter, who rebukes his colleague and says that they should have offered another drink to the old man.
The middle-aged waiter does not want to leave the café, because it is his comfort zone, his refuge, where he thinks he is the most comfortable being.
The middle-aged waiter says, “What did he fear?
I don't know why I don't read more Hemingway. I'm left stunned every time I finish his work. The depths he manages to explore with his economy of words is legendary and he's done it again here, maybe better than he has in any other of his short stories.
مقهى و ثلاث أشخاص، في ثلاث مراحل عمرية يمثلون التدرج من الشغف بالحياة إلى التعقل والتفهم ومن ثم إلى وحدة الشيخوخة
It was all a nothing and a man was a nothing too. What an existential masterpiece, with so many philosophical layers. This is pure genius. Highly recommended.Happy Reading.
The image of despair, loneliness, youth, old age, humility and reflection.
explaining the deep need of humanity to find hope, purpose and need in a state of despair and loneliness.
the old man found it in the end of a glass of brandy, meanwhile the older waiter found it in becoming an aid of hope by worrking at night in a well lighted place to his preference a cafe.
he defends him from the young waiters perspective of utter confidence and unecessary baggage to ponder what troubles the old man.
not realizing not always life stays still for he too , the old man had all that once.
This particular short story seems to have been popular for its treatment of the Lord's Prayer, but I am spellbound by Hemingway's ability to shake loose a raft of emotions in such a short space.
Maybe it is his self-centredness I identify with - I am not sure - but I seem to be able to identify with all of the characters, torn from the feeling of working with the public in a dull job,to being grateful for a job, to being old and not wanting to be in a popular place but to drink one's poison in a "clean well lighted place", then to hopelessness with a sense of resignation, then dignity and contentment all in one.
I like to read this story with my Introduction to Literature students and then ask them which character they identify with best; the old drunk man, the older waiter, or the young waiter.
I think the character you pick is fairly telling about your time and place in life.
I tend towards the younger waiter--I always feel like I can't wait to go away from work in order to live my real life.
But I love the treatment given to the older waiter in the end, when he goes away from the diner in quiet reflection, and he tries to uncover the meaning of life, "Nada ya nada...
This will have me looking at those late-night tables who come in moments before we close a bit differently from now on.
Deep and meaningful, Hemingway writes a great short story that has many questions and indeed a lot to think about...
Well there is nothing in this story that is praiseworthy or anything unique. Its just story about nothingness and how there is nothing in this world.The text level was fine, then concept was just very lame and didn't develop at all and characters were few and fine and there is nothing nice about this story.
It's the best short story I've read so far.💕🌸
A very brief but powerful short story. I think it speaks about loneliness. Probably about other things too, but I haven't re-read it enough
one of the best literary works ever written. and safe to say that this is my favourite short story which sums a lifetime in 3 pages.
He doesn't care about why the old man tried to kill himself, he's just exasperated by him because he stays late at night drinking at the bar and keeps the young waiter from going home early, and because of that, he says twice he should have killed himself.
Like this arrogant, shallow young waiter.His older colleague instead realises one thing: the deaf old man is just lonely.
Broke my heart when I felt the old man was just lonely, sad and all the young waiter could say was "Ah, if only you had killed yourself!"What I find interesting is how the story focuses a lot on lateness and nothingness.
(Or you can argue that it is the window through Hemingway's depression that leads him to his suicide, but one thing for sure is that it is definitely a window through the ordinary, yet tragic life of men.)Although Hemingway doesn't try to sensationalize the story being told, it doesn't mean that the story itself is a small, trivial stuff.
Their own words speak louder than the narration.Hemingway's minimalistic writing style works beautifully as we are not seeing through the lens of the narrator (or narrator's judgement); we are allowed to jump into the scene, making it life in our head, seeing it as it is.
Should it not, however, I will remind myself of the story about an old, deaf, lonely, suicidal man who gets himself drunk in this clean well lighted café.
At the end of the story, the older waiter comforts himself thinking that others probably suffer from insomnia as well.
The young waiter could very well end up like the two others, but there's simply no understanding, no cooperation to help these lonely people on their way.
