For weeks, I attempted to finish Patricia Cornwell's "Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper, Case Closed" I haven't written a real book review, (or even been inclined to write one,) since High School English Lit., but this book frustrated me enough to write one.I've heard from many people what a wonderful piece of forensic investigation it is, how interesting, and that it seems the most plausible answer to the question of "whodunit."It must be confessed, that though I ordinarily like Patricia Cornwell's style of writing, and find her fiction very entertaining, I could not finish this book.
Let me first say, I hate when an author prints his or her own name larger than the title on a book cover.
That was not the worst thing about this book.
I found “Portrait of a Killer” because it rates highly among other true-crime books and I thought I was learning about actual events, until I was about a quarter of the way through and did some research of my own.
This book should be advertised as a theory and should not say, “case closed,” on the cover (also in smaller print than the author’s name).
Despite the rather presumptuous sub-title of "case closed", Cornwell doesn't prove her thesis.
When discussing how women were seen at the time, why is Cornwell citing a book written in the 1600s?
How does she know her Ripper letter is the real, deal?
Somehow I doubt that Cornwell is the only Ripper expert who worked hard, despite what she implies.10.
Cornwell keeps saying she wouldn't do something, and then does it.
She does not rebutt fully the claim that Sickert had an alibi.If you want to know how NOT to construct an argument, read this book.
I thought it would be a sort of historical re-cap of the Jack the Ripper killings with Cornwell revealing the person that she thought to be the killer, with evidence to substantiate her opinion.
I did not expect to be lectured over and over and beaten over the head with her opinion on the identity of the killer.
From what I've read, Cornwell went a little bonky in the head with trying to prove that her guy was the one, spending millions of dollars to acquire paintings and writings that belonged to him.
Recommended for anyone that enjoys a good, repetitive lecture.
According to Ms Cornwell, she began to wonder about Walter Sickert being Jack the Ripper when she was flipping through a book of his art and came across his 1887 painting of Ada Lundberg performing at the Marylebone Music Hall.
Were it not for HRH Joseph Sickert’s absurd conspiracy claims, which he later admitted were a fabrication, nobody would ever have suggested Walter Sickert as a possible Ripper suspect.Anyway, getting back to Cornwell's theory (though she considers it to be a matter of fact).

That led me for a while to read up on the Ripper -- novels where Sherlock Holmes meets him, and so on.The problem with this book is that although Cornwell claims that she has solved the case beyond a shadow of a doubt and that The Ripper was noted artist Walter Sickert, her evidence is no more complete or compelling than say, Alan Moore and Eddie Campbell's evidence that the Ripper was the royal physician Sir William Gull, or Hempel and Wheatley's evidence that the Ripper was Prince Edward.
I have to say, I know I am in the minority when I say that I find this argument for artist Walter Sickert to be the Ripper rather convincing.
All that said, what makes this book so interesting is how Cornwell draws out the pathology of a sociopath.
Was Sickert the Ripper -- from what I see here, it's pretty evident that he was a profoundly disturbed person and bore a real hatred/fear/contempt of women.
If you can handle it, go on and read the book.
I read this during a time in my life when I wanted all mysteries solved! Unfortunately, my needs weren't fulfilled with this book. In fact, I think I had more questions afterward than I did when I started.Am I satisfied that she may have, in fact, closed the case and the mystery of Jack the Ripper's elusive identity has finally been solved? Sorry, no. And I think that this is one mystery that I am content to leave just that.
I can't believe that she spent a million dollars of her own money to research the true identity of Jack the Ripper.....and, despite the title, she has come away with little to no proof - she relies a great deal on mitochondrial DNA evidence that she admits is inconclusive, and paintings done by Sickert years after the fact.
Sickert seems to have been an ass, and perhaps he was the Ripper, but Cornwall has done nothing in this book that would allow her valid use of the subtitle "Case Closed".
The only thing that keeps this book from one star are the great photographs included, especially those of the Ripper letters.
Or because Sickert occasionally wrote on a certain type of paper, that happened to be the same type as the one used in the ripper letters, then it had to be him!
And he wrote most of the 250 (????) letter jack the ripper sent to the police too!
She goes on and on about the type of paper used in the ripper letters, and does say that maybe even if the paper is the same it does not mean Sickert is the killer, yet she decides that he is.
That's the only evidence i agree with, that maybe he wrote a letter.
Non voglio più leggere questo libro.
In questo libro si può leggere della mentalità degli uomini (e delle donne) di quegli anni, delle loro passioni per il teatro e le corse, dei problemi sociali di Londra.
So solo che la Cornwell porta sufficienti prove per ritenere “chiuso” il caso di Jack lo Squartatore.🕯 NEWTs readathon (August 2018):  History of magic, exceed expectations  (read a book at least five years old)
Possibly the most horribly "researched" book I've ever read. Case closed, my ass.
Δεν πίστευα εξαρχής πως ο ένοχος είναι αυτός που υποστηρίζει η Cornwell πως είναι, αλλά ήθελα να δω την έρευνα που έκανε και τη διαδικασία που ακολούθησε έτσι ώστε να αιτιολογήσει το σκεπτικό της.3 αστεράκια γιατί σέβομαι τον χρόνο και τα χρήματα που αφιέρωσε σ' αυτή την έρευνα.
Θα έπρεπε λοιπόν να είναι πιο προσεκτική και να αναφέρει πως πρόκειται για μια έρευνα που προσεγγίζει τις διάφορες εικασίες για την ταυτότητα του δράστη κι όχι να πανηγυρίζει (ναι, ναι) στο τέλος του βιβλίου, λέγοντας για την ομάδα της "Μαζί τον πιάσαμε.
Patricia Cornwell apresenta na obra “Jack, o Estripador – Retrato de um Assassino”, o que eu considero ser apenas “mais uma” teoria acerca da identidade de Jack, o Estripador.
Mas depois há tantas suposições, tantas conjecturas, tantas hipóteses sem base suficientemente sólida que não consegui “agarrar” esta teoria.Já tive acesso a várias teorias a respeito da identidade de Jack, o Estripador e esta revelou-se como apenas mais uma que, muito honestamente, não me convenceu.
I liked this book because Patricia Cornwall presented quite a stirring case for her argument that the killer was a rather famous artist named Walter Sickert.
She created this protrait of Sickert with such passion, convinced she really has solved this case, that I couldn't help but get excited, too.
I had a chance to walk around in one of Jack the Ripper's hunting grounds, making it all the more exciting.
It wasn't until I got back to the States that I was able to do some research on my own that I learned just how far off the experts consider Cornwall to be.
When it comes to the artist Walter Sickert, her favoured suspect, her case is vaguely circumstantial at best.
There’s not a scerrick of direct physical evidence against Sickert, or any other suspect to my knowledge.
Yet there are at least a dozen others who present a more likely psychological and logistical fit for the crimes than Sickert.
For a more objective (factual) overview of the murders and the more likely suspects, I’d recommend Philip Sugden’s “The Complete History Of Jack the Ripper” or Donald Rumbelow’s “The Complete Jack the Ripper”.
Oy.I'm one of those folks who is forever entranced by the Jack the Ripper saga.
Oy.Prior to this, I had never read a Patricia Cornwell book, so I was not a follower of her mystery books.
Safe to say, after making it through this "expose" of the Ripper, I won't be reading any other Cornwell books.
Since I have always felt the responsibility of reading a book from cover-to-cover, this meant torture.
Like goths in high school.Book Season = Winter (hope for a blackout)
Hey lady! Don't write a book saying you solved a case when the best you can do every other line is something "probably" or "may certainly" have happened.
After months, I finally buckled and put this one down... I should have taken it into the yard and shot it... It literally was that bad...
In the beginning of this book, the author states that she became interested in the Ripper murders on a visit to London and was soon convinced that the artist Walter Sickert was responsible.
Having decided on this, she then claims to have solved the murders and sets about, rather unconvincingly, attempting to convince us that this is the case.Alarm bells began to ring when Cornwell states with utter conviction that the Ripper's first victim was Martha Tabram - a fact hotly disputed amongst those who have investigated the Ripper murders.
so, patricia cornwell has solved the ripper case.
which makes portrait of a killer an extremely annoying read.
you'll be forced to wade through plenty of the brackwater of standard bourgeois reaction to anything and anybody involved with prostitution (hey compassion - hey contempt!), the standard true-crime-solved insight about the psychological mechanism (yes, singular: one mechanism, and one mechanism only) that produces serial killers ("the ripper hated women - sickert has had surgery on his penis as a boy - sickert is the ripper"), and some wailing and whining about the hardships of the london police force in the dying century.
cornwell's final argument is based on handwriting samples.
fun to read alongside with  from hell; and if it's just to see how ripper speculation can be cool, too.
Buddy read with the awesome Sarah!
If it wasn't for the buddy read, I would have put this one on hiatus until I was in a better head space.Pros:-She really did her research and put a ton of effort in here.
Cons:-I found myself bored a lot of the time (see disclaimer above).-The pacing and the flow felt off.
I felt off-kilter a lot of the time (see disclaimer above).-I think better editing could have made it more concise and flow better.I'm going with my default rating of 3 stars, until I re-read and give a more accurate rating.
I admit to having a great interest in the Jack the Ripper case and have for many years.
I was interested to see what Cornwell could come up with as to who could have done the killing.
I was thoroughly disappointed with this book.
It was basically filled with Cornwell's guesses that she put out as facts.
She just made all these facts from his life just fall inter her theory.
I wouldn't suggest anyone to read this book.
Patricia Cornwell delves into the Jack the Ripper case.
I believe her insight and knowledge of the murders, papers, and other evidence during the killings is very well portrayed in her book.
I'm not entirely convinced the true killer is identified, but of all the evidence and other books I've read about Jack the Ripper, I believe her investigation of the crimes to be the most accurately portrayed on the subject.
Even if you believe or don't believe Cornwell identified who Jack the Ripper is, this book is a great read.
It was such a jolly job the last one”, “The police pass me close every day, and I shall pass one going to post this”, “Just a line to let you know that I love my work”…By using modern forensic technology, Patricia Cornwell has exposed the artist as the author of the Ripper letters.
She owns more than thirty of the Sickert’s painting and she believes that the artwork closely resembles the Ripper crime scenes.
And she has also claimed that some of the letters written by someone purporting to be the killer, had the same watermark as some of Sickert's writing paper.
Just the other day, I heard someone on television say what I've heard all my life: that the true identity of Jack the Ripper has never been discovered.
Not true.
The only mystery left in my mind is how some people can read the book and not be convinced.
They can be very good at "hiding in plain sight."I'm reading this book for the third time, now--and I know "who done it." What's fascinating is not the gruesome details about the six murders originally attributed to the Ripper (he actually committed many more) but rather the historical detail and the psychological profile of an incredibly brilliant and complex man.
Cornwell is somewhat of a "guilty pleasure" for me as a number of the Scarpetta novels really got me hooked and "Hornet's Nest" and "Southern Cross" are better still.
The Jack the Ripper case is of course both horrifying and fascinating and I picked up the books with some high hopes.
Unfortunately, none were met.
Cornwell goes about her task the "wrong way": after introducing "her" killer, she dedicates the book to nag us into believing what she believes, and not successfully either.
There are probably a lot better books about the case to choose instead of this one.
Man, I had this whole summer of reading books I thought I'd love but didn't (Da Vinci Code, Under the Banner of Heaven, and this). So I wasn't quite as disappointed with this one as the other two, but it's not good. I love Patricia Cornwell's mysteries (although they're definitely guilty pleasures), and I love stories about Jack the Ripper (or really anything that takes place in London). But geez, you can't name a book "Case Closed" and then present such a shoddy case. I really hope PC sticks with fiction from here on out!
Finally I found out who Jack the Ripper was! For the longest time I thought if I ever wanted to know the true identity of Jack the Ripper I would have to go under cover as a man and join the Freemasons to learn all their secrets, since I heard on the Jack the Ripper tour I went on in like 1999 that the only people who really know who Jack the Ripper was are the Freemasons. Needless to say, reading this book has proved a lot easier than my previous plan. Thanks Patricia Cornwell!
