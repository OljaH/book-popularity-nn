| AMZ US | AMZ UK | B&N | KOBO | iBOOKS |Blurb: My relationship with Hunter Delucia started backwards.
So I left him with my mother’s—she could scare away any man with her talks of babies and marriage—and flew back home.I’d thought it was funny, until the following week when he rang the bell at Mom’s house for Sunday night dinner.
This man stole a piece of my soul—because the soul lives forever, and so will my love for this beautiful man.SEX, NOT LOVE, the latest by Vi Keeland, has yet another absolutely perfect book boyfriend who is sure to steal your hearts.
It’s clear that Natalia has stolen his heart but for some reason, he’s unwilling to give their love a chance.
The past is holding him prisoner and has stolen his ability to hope.Will Hunter be able to let Natalia go when all is said and done?Here are my overall ratings on the book:
I LOVED it soooo much! :)Ps. Teaser was taken from Vi's FB page. :)
Why did he chase her like crazy (apart from him sleeping with OWs after their 1st encounter, he was kinda obsessed with the idea to have sex with her), why did he forced himself in her family and in her life like a bulldozer, only to break her heart after 2 months of sex???!!!
Well, I wouldn't have, but again, I never hid my cold heart...I'm not a fan of vulgar men, and this one had ott dirty mouth.
No information if he slept with OWs, she remained celibate, but went on a date with OM.

Hunter got the garter.Natalia needed to sleep with someone.
Hunter wanted to sleep with Natalia.
“I’m not sleeping with you, you know.”“Why not?
Natalia is at New York.
Neither Natalia nor Hunter are ready for commitment:Natalia’s current life is complicated.
Life was not easy for both of them, but they both will manage to cope.I especially loved Natalia's character, her gentle giving nature, her empathy, her willingness to sacrifice herself.
DNF at %20.Up until page 215 0f a 255-page book, all chapters written by the hero are about his past and the girl he loved in the past.
After realising Hunter is telling about his ex-love in his chapters, I checked how far it goes and it goes too long to bear!
Too bad, I did and I just realised I wanted him to be with his ex!How does a very experienced writer do this in a romance book?
WTH, really?Killing her own book - that's what I call this!(P.S. In another book maybe I would read it to see what it serves but this is pure romance and I want to read the romance between the hero and the heroine...)
Genre: Contemporary RomanceType: Standalone POV: First Person - DualRating: Natalia Rossi and Hunter Delucia first met at a wedding of their mutual friends.
However secrets from the past could potentially derailed what had been built.I have read Vi Keeland's books before but they are collaboration works.
Natalia wanted to take what she desired but her past made her doubted her decisions.
I do like the premise of fuck buddy who turned out to be more, but for such story I do wish there's a little bit more of sexy scenes lol!
It would appeal to readers who like sexy friends (with benefit) to lover story.💋 🍆 💋 .
5 She’s My One Stars!-“You look in the rearview mirror too often, sometimes you miss what’s right in front of you.” Natalia Rossi is s gorgeous 28 yr. old divorced Italian woman living in New York. She dates, but doesn’t really put herself out there since men only ever let her down. She’s happy with her job as a behavioral therapist, & has a close family, and great friends. When her best friend Anna is getting married, she heads to California for the wedding. She’s introduced to the grooms b
She dates, but doesn’t really put herself out there since men only ever let her down.
She’s introduced to the grooms best friend, Hunter Delucia, and sparks fly.
Not ready to let anyone in, Nat shares some fun, flirty banter and a few hot as hell kisses with this delicious man, and then boards a plane, and returns to her life in New York.
This book had so much humor, was super sexy, & has a man you will absolutely fall in love with.
Hunter Delucia totally stole my heart!
Hot alpha males are a dependable favorite in romance novels and oh boy is Hunter one decadently hot alpha you’ll completely fall in love with!  With Sex, not Love, Vi Keeland authors a charming and touching novel with quick and witty banter, scorching sexy times, and exquisite angst. Oh! And swoon, let’s not forget the swoon. It follows Hunter Delucia, a charismatic and wealthy architect Californian, and Natalia Rossi, a divorcee and behavioral therapist from NY who has sworn off relationships.
With Sex, not Love, Vi Keeland authors a charming and touching novel with quick and witty banter, scorching sexy times, and exquisite angst.
Being part of their respective best friends’ wedding party, Nat and Hunter meet during the wedding’s rehearsal dinner where sparks immediately fly and although it wasn’t her intention, Nat ends up in Hunter’s hotel room.
But what started as Sex, not Love turns into much more.
I just loved how Hunter pursued Nat in the most relentlessly charming, flirty, and dirty talking way.
I fell in love with Hunter immediately.
Sex, Not Love by Vi Keeland is a standalone contemporary romance.
Opening a new Vi Keeland book is one of my most favorite things about being a romance reader.
So, it's safe to say that I am a HUGE Vi Keeland addict and my love for her, as impossible as it may seem, grew, became crazier, with her latest release Sex, Not Love.Sex, Not Love is a contemporary romance standalone that sizzles with witty banter and steamy sex, but also delves deep into heartbreak and gut-wrenching emotion.
She brought us a beautiful romance, full of heart-stopping moments that make Sex, Not Love impossible to put down.
3.5 StarsOverall Opinion: This was a cute, sexy story. I think I had those darn expectations get me again, because I was expecting more 🤷🏻♀. I don't have any major complaints, so I didnt dislike it -- I just didn't love it like I was hoping I would. I think I wanted more time with them interacting as an actual couple. We have what felt like majority of the story with one or the other pushing away, and then we have sexy times...I guess I wanted more of when things were working well. Instead, it
We have what felt like majority of the story with one or the other pushing away, and then we have sexy times...I guess I wanted more of when things were working well.
Feelings start to develop, sexy times commence, and some big secrets are revealed...and they get a HEA ending.POV: This alternated between Natalia and Hunter's POV.

Oh, I am someone who has a hard time saying no to things that are my Guilty Pleasures...It has to be a really bad piece of Cheesecake for me to turn away...Pushing the Clock and continuing to read extra minutes before going back to work...
The stepdaughter has to handle a very difficult situation and she learns her stepmom is there for her and so much more than she realized.Both of these characters have a full plate of reasons to be how they are...but the need and love which develops cause both to look their fears in the face.
It’s weird because I usually hate reading about the past love of the hero.
I’m just not a fan of the heroine Nat. 3 STARS ⭐️⭐️⭐️ November 2017 How can people give this 1 star when THEY HAVEN’T EVEN READ IT YET?!
You can rate a book however you like BUT PLEASE READ IT FIRST so at least you know what it’s about.
🙄 Or if you don’t like a certain author, then at the very least create a “not interested” shelf or something and not give them a star after shelving them as “read” even though you haven’t read a single word of the book yet.
NOW LIVEAmazon US * Amazon UKSex, Not Love was an okay book but I had some issues with it.
I liked Hunter and Natalia and their story was pretty interesting.
There were multiple flash backs to Hunter's past and it honestly made no sense to me.
Even when I finally connected it to the present and realized what was going on, it still didn't make sense.
Even with the little parts for me that became annoying they were able to keep me happy with the book.
And I loved reading every moment of the time it took them to fight for their HEA!This book was so adorable and funny and so very moving.I adored Hunter!
The way he pursues Nat. Even though he doesn't want anything serious either, due to stuff we don't yet know about!Just adorable and heartbreaking!And poor Nat with her stupid ex and all the responsibility that came with that.I just loved Nat & Hunter and their families and friends.(Have we read Derek and Anna's story before?
SEX, NOT LOVE was such a beautifully adorable & funny & heartbreaking romance!
4.5 StarsThis book left me completely smitten with the banter and the hero, Hunter!!
I’ve loved everything I’ve read from her.
Though neither are looking for “the one”, Nat finds herself trying to keep distance between the allure of her best friends’ husband’s best friend.
Sex, Not Love.
He lives on one coaster, Nat the other.
Ms. Keeland has the ability to blindside me in almost every book she writes.
I never expect the twist, I’m always looking the wrong direction and I love that she’s able to do it every time.
She keeps me on my toes while simultaneously weaving a love story that burns so brightly you know someone is bound to get burned.
Vi’s creations always sound so good to me and it’s very difficult for me not to love everything this woman writes.
She is an absolute auto-buy author to me and I am glad to say she did not disappoint with this release.Sex, Not Love is Vi’s newest standalone novel and it all starts with the instant connection between two people who seem to be opposites.
Hunter and Natalia meet in their respective best friends weeding and it’s impossible not to notice the chemistry between them since their very first meeting.
I loved this book with all my heart! ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐This book was so beautifulll! And the ending was perfect. Arnold is the reason why I still believe in true love. Presents like this one are pure gold! Natalia and Hunter were such a nice couple (I don't even know if couple is the right word, but anyway...). Hunter was... I have no words. A thoughtful, gorgeous man. The kind of man I would be lucky to have in my life someday. I adored his relationship with Izzy. What is there not to like about this guy?!
I loved this book with all my heart!
Natalia and Hunter were such a nice couple (I don't even know if couple is the right word, but anyway...).
Books like this one are the reason I love fictional characters more than people in real life.
Some true words were written here (or quotes I really liked): “Why am I attracted to assholes?”“Because they’re attractive.
I loved this story!Hunter Delucia and Natalia Rossi meet at their respective friends' wedding rehersal, and the sparks fly immediately.
Yet still, Nat resists giving Hunter her real number.
Even though Hunter doesn't want a relationship either, and suggests "sex, not love' for them, Nat gives him a phony number again--her mom's.
I loved Hunter--he was cocky and sexy and wildly inappropriate at times, but he was a good guy, and Natalia could see that.
You could see how she was falling for Hunter, even though she thought she could do the whole' sex, not love' thing.
2,5 Stars.  Hunter and Natalia met before during their friend’s wedding and feel immediately attracted to each other. But she gives him a wrong number and they don’t have the chance to meet again until almost a year later, when their friend’s son is born. This time she gives him his mother number but it backfires when he manages to charm her. It is supposed to be a temporary physical fling. Neither of them wants or is looking for something serious. Unfortunately things are not always that way.
Yes, Hunter had some issues in the past, but at some point that stops being an excuse for you to be an asshole.
I’ve read a lot of 5 star books with that and I loved them nonetheless… (view spoiler)[ what I never want to read, tough, it’s chapters dedicated to THOSE relationships.
There was a lot of moments where I felt like Hunter and his ex-girlfriend were a better match than him and Natalie and  (hide spoiler)]that is not something I look for in romance books.
(hide spoiler)]Love Triangle:  (view spoiler)[ No.
(hide spoiler)]HEA: 	(view spoiler)[ Yes.
Buddy-Read with the Lovely Six, set to commence March 19. 2018 Romance ChallengeCategory: Contemporary Romance  3.5 Sweet Pea StarsFortunately for me Sex, Not Love did not leave me with the same lackluster feelings as Beautiful Mistake. The lovely Six may have disowned me as a friend and buddy-reader if that had of happened.  Life isn’t about the big win. It’s about the person you call first to tell you’ve won.  Vi Keeland has this knack for creating male leads that belong on my ‘the-man’ shelf
However, Nat isn’t interested in smooth talking men with bodies like Greek gods, for good reason.
It’s rare in a romance for me to actually understand why people decide to ignore their attraction to one and other; in Sex, Not Love I understood Nat’s reluctance.
Add to it that Hunter, for viable reasons of his own, is only looking for something short term and you have yourself a shitshow of reasons to climb all aboard the train away from:DANGER AHEAD!After sharing a drunken kiss and a bed, but NOT sex, at their friends’ wedding celebration Natalia flies off, leaving Hunter with a fake number and the expectation to never see him again.
He badgers her friend for Nat’s real number but like a good friend she doesn’t give it out.
And when they get together, it’s extremely hot!!!Like I said before this story started a little bit slow and then picked up steam, at that point I couldn’t put it down cause it surprised me in the most wonderful way.
I loved it!The story is told in first person dual POV.
But most of Hunter’s POV is told in the past, so we’re seeing his backstory through his eyes.
It normally can rub me the wrong way, like in Ugly Love for example (I know, I know, unpopular opinion).
I actually think Vi Keeland nails it with Hunter’s backstory and how it’s told.
Truly loved this book much more than I expected to. Not that I didn’t think I’d enjoy it, because I have enjoyed this authors work before, but I didn’t think a friends with benefits book would be so deep and emotional. I was peasantry surprised by this one I will openly admit. It’s the perfect combination of heat, sweet, and emotion. I loved both the main characters, and the side characters added so much to the story. Such a great read for so many reasons.Highly recommend!https://instagram.com/p/BjZ-js6g69x/^fan edit on IG!
Nat blows him off with a wrong phone number and they don't see each other again for nine months...for Anna's baby shower.
Her Mom ended up inviting him to Sunday dinner...and giving him Nat's correct phone number.
Normally, it would be easy seeing as Hunter lives in California and Nat lives in New York but Hunter just happens to be on a work assignment in New York for two months and that makes things a whole lot easier or does it?They both have had a lot of drama in their lives and neither are looking for repeats.
Everything about this story was.. wonderful!I love this author’s sexy, fun reads so I didn’t waste any time diving into Hunter and Nat’s story!Meeting at a wedding and sharing instant chemistry had Hunter and Nat beginning an uncomplicated, complicated relationship dance. What did they want out of any type of relationship? How could it possibly work? Casual was the key… “Think about it, sex not love.” Mutual friends and a doggedness on Hunter’s part that was sweetly stalkerish, meant both of the
wonderful!I love this author’s sexy, fun reads so I didn’t waste any time diving into Hunter and Nat’s story!Meeting at a wedding and sharing instant chemistry had Hunter and Nat beginning an uncomplicated, complicated relationship dance.
“Think about it, sex not love.”
I thought Hunter was going to be this charming, uber-handsome, player.
I loved her relationship with her family and her acceptance of where and how she got to the place she was in.
There’s history while they’re making new memories and it all balanced to a wonderful, heart-warming and soul-tingling read.
Before I review the book, can we please talk about the cover model??
Like??
Perfection in the form of a human being.
I highkey searched for his name and it’s Fabian Castro.
You are welcome.
Now this book is definitely my favorite so far by Keeland.
I usually find her books quite average but this one was so good.
I really liked Hunter and I really liked Nat and I love them together!
There were tropes here and there, but that’s expected so I don’t really care.
I’m just here for a fun, easy read during midterms period, and that was provided!
