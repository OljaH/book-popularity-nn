Ok read! typical S.Sheldon's kinda writing and storyline that involves entangled crime,mystery and a little suspenseful with a few flawed characters (paperback!)
Upravo se sprema crnogorsko izdanje... Pre devet godina je poslednji put objavljena...
A fantastic read.In a normal book,the suspense is about who the killer is.But in this Sidney's maste
This was Sheldon’s second to last novel published before his death. The usual style is there: strong, determined heroine, a hidden agenda/conspiracy, worldwide travel to exotic cities. But for some reason, even though the pacing was written in Sheldon’s rapid-fire style, it seemed to take a while for things to wrap up. Not his best, but not his worst. Only so-so for me.
I picked this up at a library sale, having never read anything from Sheldon before, and the dust jacket spoke highly of him and his other work (books, TV shows, awards, etc.).
Good authors, who do their homework, can put the reader in the character's shoes - what they're thinking, feeling, and seeing.
Here you have a main character who travels to half a dozen major cities around the world and she may as well have been traveling to Des Moines, IA.
Sheldon doesn't even mention jet lag after the third or fourth flight in a week.
Two friends of mine had just finished reading this book, they liked it and recommended it.
I'd never read a book by this author until now.
is supposed to be about a local news reporter, Dana Evans who's curiosity about a well known philanthropist's murder get's her into more trouble than she bargained for.
Something feels not right about this and Dana starts, in the beginning out of curiosity to look into his death.
Trying not to give away spoilers here but Dana encountered people who spoke different languages and you mean to tell me every time she could speak those languages?
I don't think I'll read any more of this author's books.
I am so sorry to write this, but this book wasn't my cup of tea. I didn't like the reason for the deaths in this story. Crime is my favorite genre and I don't like this type of crime stories. The style of writing is pretty light, it's an easy read, I did like the twist that happens, I just didn't enjoy reading this book as much, I had a totally different expectations.
i wanted to give this book 5 stars but :) nothing is perfect in life had to find something imperfect with it so there was i thought that it was not long enough (funny)..on the other hand this was a very well written book
I picked this book up because it was a "New York Times bestseller" and I had never read anything by Sidney Sheldon and wanted to see what I thought of him as an author.
Situations are contrived, characters don't feel like real people.
Just about every page has something on it that strains credibility, or seems fake or contrived.
Conversations don't feel real.
Situations don't feel real.
I won't pick up any more Sidney Sheldon books.
This just goes to show that just because a book is a NY Times bestseller, doesn't mean it's worth reading.
This is probably the worst "mystery" I've ever read.
What do I say w/o sounding like the critics or the back of the book cover?
The main character runs into her bosses office and he says you come running in here like Chicken Little screaming "The sky is falling, the sky is falling." I love that.
Once I reached like chapter 9 I had a difficult time putting it down.
If you like a fast paced thriller, you cannot miss this read.
I remember his book, Sands of Time, I read literally in two days, it was so wonderful.
With all of the other books I've read of his, this ranks up there at the top of the list.
Not finished - Probably won't finish since the e-library copy expired on my nook color a week ago.Here's the thing - this book above all else, is incredibly predictable. The plot is blah, the characters under-developed and shallow. He describes the characters(namely the men) the same. I suspect her fiance is the bad guy- lol. Either way, I was very disappointed. But don't take my word for it.... (haaa)Sidney is a talented writer, no doubt. I just didn't care for this particular novel. Read "Memories of Midnight" for a great Sidney Sheldon novel.Peace, I'm outta here!
a friend recommended this book to me have to admit I did not expect a lot but I was pleasantly surprised..THE SKY IS FALLING is a scintillating thriller set against a world-class background. The elegantly crafted plot builds from curiosity to terror culminating in a conspiracy of enormous proportion. While fiction has its roots in truth, from the Author's Note at the end, one wonders. Could this really happen, or has it?
Note to Mr. Sheldon: 20-somethings don't speak like Dana Evans. They don't call everyone, including boyfriends, "darling."
2,5*
The genesis of the plot is sparked by the curiosity she succumbs to after the death of the last member of the affluent Winthrop family-all 5 of which have died 'accidental' deaths within the appalling span of a year.The book was thoroughly equipped with treachery, deception and treason but at the same time it also depicted loyalty, love and friendship in its most versatile framework.
I loved the fact that this book got me thinking, it got me trying to outsmart the author- miserably failing in unearthing the end.
The first book I read by Sheldon I didn’t like, however I decided to give him another chance because a few of my friends liked his work, maybe I just picked up a bad one… so this is my second Sidney Sheldon book and I still don’t like his writing or whatever this is called.
How was important for Dana’s mother to call her and tell her she thought Dana would cry at the Winthrop funeral, were Dana answers that she did cry.
After quite some time since couple of people recommended Sheldon to me, I decided it was time to try his books.
All the time during the reading, I was under the impression that this book was not written, but simply, put together in a rush.
The number of side characters too big.
It is also possible to accomplish both high-adrenaline action and emotional approach to the story and characters.
In this book, you can not connect even with the main character.
It will take a lot of good critics, and really big number of pleased readers for me to take another of Sheldons books to read.
18/18 --> I've read them all!If you've read The Best Laid Plans, you would have come across Dana Evans.
In this story, she's more fearless than ever - or at least that's what she seems to be.
She goes on a manhunt across three continents after having suspicions about the series of deaths that wipe out the remaining members of the Winthrop family in one year.I wasn't very fond of The Best Laid plans to begin with.
Sure, I liked Dana then and I liked her on this book but the story itself didn't excite me as much as I had hoped.
I never thought in a Gazillion, Billion years that I would find a Sidney Sheldon book that I couldn't finish.
A whole scene in which her mother's new husband insults her adopted son and its over in a paragraph...
Usually with Sidney Sheldon's novels we are given so much detail about our narrator that we feel every one of their feelings and small exchanges such as this become interesting and progress the plot, but I barely knew Dana.Every character was wonderful or perfect and their situations were wonderful and life was just bloody wonderful, unless you were a Winthrop apparently...This just wasn't the book for me.
Yawn. Another book from the box o' paperbacks (I am beginning to sense why my neighbor is getting rid of them..). Written in the early nineties - characters were pretty lame. Tons of story lines and none of them intriguing enough to develop - apparently even for the author.
Muy buen libro, la verdad que me encantó, aunque con un final bastante confuso... Como siempre los libros de Sidney Sheldon, te atrapan, y te dejan como mas. Mucho misterio y Suspenso! me encantoo (= Recomendadisimo
رهيييبةحاسة حالي عشت احداث فلم اكشن امريكي :|من بداية الرواية لحد اكتر من نصها .. ماكنت فاهمة حاجة.. وكل اشي داخل ببعضهوفجاة بدا كل اشي يوضح .. وفهمت كل اشي :|مممم اول مرة اقرا هالنوع من الرواياات..استمعت كتير :D
Few hundred pages were great, and fast paced. I could feel the thrill. Though after a while, it started to become rather repetitive and boring
It's a good mysterious story about the murder of a family. Nicely written by Sidney Sheldon.
Tuy nhiên, điều này không phải hoàn toàn là tiêu cực, vì đôi khi tác giả cũng để cho những quãng nghỉ hợp lý, và mạch truyện dễ theo nên với một cuộc phiêu lưu kịch tính thì nhanh cũng là điều chấp nhận được.Một lần nữa, mình chẳng đoán biết được gì trước khi phải đọc đến 10-20 trang cuối, thật khó đoán (and at the same time, cũng dễ đoán) và quan trọng hơn, đó là mình hồi hộp cả từ tận trang 400 đến trang 500, tức là chờ mãi để hết hồi hộp, chờ "mọi dữ liệu đâu vào đấy" mà mãi không hết hồi hộp thành ra hơi mệt :))Một cuốn sách thú vị và NHANH.*spoiler để còn nhớ*.....
The Sky is Falling!
This was my second book by Sidney Sheldon.
The plot is about a murder mystery and it is described in a fascinating manner.
Well, I should not ruin the Reader's interest by describing the story here itself, right?
It's a suspense story which will not allow you to put the book down.Now, it's obvious that whenever you read anything , you get to learn something.
From this book, I literally loved the character of Dana Evans(the leading character).
So, this is what I learnt from this book.
Another nice piece from Master Storyteller. But, my expectation was little high. From starting, story's plot was spreading. When it finished, I was felt that where is the special thrill! Dana Evans was a strong role. Kemal was a mystery to me. Jeff was the lucky guy who has his love in life.
Ensimmäinen lukemani Sheldoni. Ihan täydellistä kesälukemista! Tarina koukutti ja viihdytti.
The use of the word "wonderful" 😆😅😂The whole book felt like one very long conversation.
I’m ashamed of myself.” “You sued, but you didn’t take him to court?” “No. He—we settled the lawsuit.
Can you tell me what the settlement was?” “No, I’m afraid I can’t,” Joan Sinisi said.
“It’s all very confidential.” Dana wondered what it could have been that made this timid woman bring a lawsuit against a titan like Taylor Winthrop and why she was terrified to talk about it.
Pretty good - kept my interest from beginning to end
