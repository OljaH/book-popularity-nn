“I love you more in this moment than any moment that has come before it.” This book was a raw and emotional reminder of why I read romance.
It reminded me of the small magic within the big hardships we conquer for love.
This speed-train of a novel hit me hard enough for it to become one if not the best of my reads this year.
All Your Perfects acted very slowly like a vice on my heart and before I knew it - it had taken it and shattered it.
I shall now write a resemblance of a review whilst pick
That last star means that I would take that book into fresh hell and back and still hold it like it’s everything beautiful in life.
A good husband—a husband who truly loves his wife—wouldn’t cheat on her and then blame his infidelity on the fact that he’s lonely.”7) Later on we find out why Quinn forgives him and she clearly states "The reason HE allowed himself to fuck up is because he gave up on us."I am not in anyway justifying infidelity, because even in this case it was hard for me to get over.
5 stars!!!  Colleen Hoover is one of my favorite authors. Not many can evoke the kind of emotion she does with each and every book. All Your Perfects may be her most emotional one yet, at least for me it was. Quinn and Graham’s love story starts out in an unconventional way. From the moment they met, to when they married, to now, 7 years after that, it’s apparent that fate put them together. They are still just as much in love now as they were in the beginning, but things out of their control ha
Quinn and Graham’s love story starts out in an unconventional way.
It’s hard to admit that a marriage might be over when the love is still there.
Though much of the book was hard for me to read, I thought Hoover ended this story perfectly.
I loved how the book ended.
I loved how real, raw, and brilliant this book was.
But for those of us that can, I feel that Colleen did justice to this story and this topic and I’m happy that this book was written.
It’s a journey you need to read to experience.
"If you only shine light on your flaws, all your perfects will dim."My intent is not to make this review all about me, but about the book, so if you want to discuss anything regarding mine and my family's personal journey (or need someone to talk to about your own), please feel free to send me a private message and I would be glad to do so.
It could be that this book was so special to me because it was personal on many levels, so maybe it won't speak to you in the same way that it did me, but I have a feeling that All Your Perfects will give many readers a similarly satisfying experience as I had.
To the author and any reviewer who justified hero’s cheating, blaming it on heroine:Has it occurred to ANY of you that she was going through depression???And he was SUCH a good guy and loved her SO much that instead of realising the love of his life is clinically depressed he cheats on her and then justifies this by claiming he was thinking of HER all the time.Did she blame him for her miscarriage?
NOTHING can redeem you.I’m the residential bitch here, but I solemnly pray all of you who support this BS, never come to a hard time in your life when you go into depression and then get blamed for it and get abandon and betrayed by your spouse.

ARC provided by Atria Books in exchange for an honest review.  “The problem is, love and happiness are not concordant. One can exist without the other.”  All Your Perfects is a book that made me feel every emotion in the world. It broke me, and it healed me, and it made me not feel so lonely. I wanted to hug my iPad, and throw my iPad. I wanted to give it five stars, and I wanted to give it one star. I swear, this book made me feel everything.

Trigger and content warnings for: infertility, miscarrying, depression, grief, cheating, loss of a loved one in the past, abuse, a self-harm scene involving cutting with glass, and a really gross comment about how stay at home moms are looked at as bad because of “feminism and all that”, and another really questionable paragraph about how therapy/therapists aren’t helpful for the main character that I felt was done really poorly.All Your Perfects is a hard-hitting book about a topic I’ve never read about before; infertility.

A new book from my all time favorite author!!!
YAY!
"what's your greatest accomplishment"  me: colleen hoover liked two of my reviews. also me: we're practically best friends now ☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺ me calculating how bad the emotional damage would be if i read this book:
*Possible spoilers*Quinn, our heroine, is infertile and consequently, she spirals into a depression that widens the disconnect between her and, Graham, her husband.
The reader is then taken on a journey through Quinn’s five stages of grief.Hoover interspersed past and present to bring us this couple’s story and it’s quite blatant that incorporating their “then” was an attempt to bring much-needed levity to a book that is intensely melancholic.
A melancholy I’m sure was meant to tug at our heartstrings; and while it didn’t move me to tears as it did other reviewers, I was sympathetic toward Quinn and wished she would get help for depression and PTSD.
Otherwise, this story was quite forgettable.
6 STARS I’ll be honest, I was scared going into this book. I knew it was going to be angsty. I knew I’d cry. From friends who had read it, from seeing comments here and there, I expected pain. What I did not expect was to be completely broken, and it's safe to say that I have never felt pain like I did while reading All Your Perfects. Sure, I’ve had my heart crushed in books before, but not like this. Never like this. I’m still reeling. This story is powerful. A raw, poignant portrait of the br
Graham and Quinn’s story has such sorrow in it but it also such profound hope, and that's what truly shined in the end.Moving from past to present, All Your Perfects shows us Quinn and Graham's budding relationship at the start, while also flipping to the decaying state their marriage is currently in.
It’s brutal yet exquisite as you read about these two people who were once so in love, so happy, so free and fun and fantastic that are now completely consumed by pain and sadness, hopelessness and frustration.
All Your Perfects is about a troubled marriage, the impact of infertility, and acceptance of what one cannot control. I feel like so many reviewers have already written wonderful reviews about why this is such a compelling read, so I am going to keep this short and sweet!I was completely riveted while reading this--strong characterization fuels the narrative. I loved the characters, even though there were times when I was screaming at them! Quinn's psyche was a bit much to handle at times; I wa
I loved the characters, even though there were times when I was screaming at them!
When I wasn’t reading, I was thinking about these characters and how their marriage was going to play out.
All Your Perfects takes a realistic look at infertility and how it can tear a marriage apart, which might be hard for some to read.
However, the dark parts are nicely wrapped inside the shiny romance of when the characters first meet, which helped to harshen the blow when it came to reading the most painfully awful moments of Quinn and Graham’s deteriorating marriage.
The guy is a cheater and the book is 300 pages of angst, depression, sadness and betrayal and everything gets “solved” in the last 20 pages lol ok Ps - Question time : Can Colleen Hoover write a book where the main character doesn’t go trough something traumatic and/or suffers through the entire book ?????
She’s constantly writing the same book with a different problem, it goes like this the heroine has a problem(infertility/abusive relationship/ deeply insecurity, then a guy come to rescue, they can’t be together(they can but they have to suffer so it’s more #romantic), angst for pages, then everything is solved in the last few pages and happily ever after, there you go!!!
but here i am, reading another CoHo book that has, yet again, broken me.
this is the inevitable result of a CoHo book, ladies and gentlemen.
the book blurb is a bit ambiguous, so i will keep my review vague as well.
regardless, i found it so easy to empathise with these characters and have my heart hurt for them.
it took me awhile to warm up to them, quinn in particular, but goodness, how my heart ached for them throughout this.
she makes me love love, the good and the bad of it.
this just came out and im already dying for her next book!↠ 5 stars

Almost every time this woman releases a damn book, I end up a crying, sobbing mess well past the time I was supposed to go to bed like a responsible adult, and I lay there with my tears wishing I never had feelings!And you know what?
As per usual with a Coho book I think it’s best to go in blind (like I did) and see what unfolds.
I don’t always love her books, but I do always have a very emotional response to them whether good or bad, and it shows me what a talented writer she is.
*****FIVE STARS*****{ARC Generously Provided by Author} ”If you only shine light on your flaws, all your perfects will dim.” ALL YOUR PERFECTS is COHO’s latest and I found this one to be captivating. It is one unbearably angsty read but I loved every minute of it. This is why I’ve always considered Colleen Hoover to be one of the most truly gifted authors out there today. It’s been a while since I read a story about a married couple's struggle to keep their love alive and this one was unbelievab
It’s been a while since I read a story about a married couple's struggle to keep their love alive and this one was unbelievably gripping!!
We get to witness their love blossom and grow through the alternating chapters that take us to their past and then we feel the utter despair that consumes them both in the present due to their struggles with infertility.
The couple who once couldn’t go a day without making love have now gone without intimacy for months.
He is definitely going on my list of top favorite characters created by Colleen Hoover.
Chemistry Between Hero & Heroine:
Colleen Hoover ruining good makeup days since 2012. No one can deny this women knows how to write. I’m not a super affectionate or emotional person. I’m not a lovey dovey kissy huggy person but for some reason those are the kind of books I want to read. COlleen Hoover dips into some hard to talk about topics but does it so perfectly. I’ll write a more in-depth review later.
4 StarsQuinn and Graham are married for seven years but now they are not as happy s they were, they’re struggling, they don’t feel alive inside and it’s eating their marriage.
Quinn thinks it’s her fault and because of her, Graham can’t have what he wants!
They still love each other so much but they’re just losing faith, interest, and hope!
Graham is trying to save their marriage but how can he, trying alone!?Enjoyed it so much!
I wanted to blame Quinn but how could I!!!!
I wanted to blame Graham but yet again how could I!!!
😭⭐😭⭐😭⭐😭⭐ 4 it left me sobbing like a baby with a heart full of hope stars for Colleen Hoover's All Your Perfects!  “The problem is, love and happiness are not concordant. One can exist without the other.” Oh, the emotions this book made me feel! I laughed, I cried, I wanted to hug it and I wanted to fling it across the room. Hoover certainly knows how to elicit feeling from her readers. It's because her characters are so real, raw and flawed. The characters and the situations they face resonate
😭⭐️😭⭐️😭⭐️😭⭐️ 4 it left me sobbing like a baby with a heart full of hope stars for Colleen Hoover's All Your Perfects!
Hoover tackles infertility and it's effects on life, love and marriage.
It made me think about all those women who are faced with infertility.
Told in alternating timelines, we see how Quinn and Graham meet, fall in love and ultimately find their marriage falling apart.
I love how Hoover took us past the "happily ever after" here.
Things are not perfect, there is real turmoil here.
“If you only shine light on your flaws, all your perfects will dim.”
Colleen Hoover just keeps on getting better and better.
Granted, this hasn’t topped It Ends With Us or Maybe Someday, this book does come close to it.
Raw and painful to read and I appreciated how she delved into the psyche of these characters who have been so emotionally damaged.
Such a hard, but incredible story to read.
Pre-reading feels!
• I’m expecting for this book to gut me.
•I never thought I'd see the day that I would be excited for a Colleen Hoover novel.
But I am hella excited for this!
My marriage is going through some shit right now.
So, I felt this book to my core.If you want to know how hard marriage can be, read this book.All Your Perfects by Colleen Hoover alternates between the “THEN” and “NOW”.
I normally am not a fan of going back and forth so many times in a book but it worked beautifully in Quinn and Graham’s story.You see, Quinn and Graham met when they caught their spouses cheating on them with each other and from there 1+1=2 and now they’re married – I’m not giving anything away, it’s stated on the back of the book.
Don’t cry.” – Graham
Their ex’s cheating wasn’t their test.
5  Category 5 moments STARS  "I hope you choose the road that will make you the happiest. Even if it’s not a choice I’ll love, I will still always love you . Whether I’m a part of your life or not. You deserve happiness more than anyone I know."   Les juro que quiero hacer esta reseña, pero no sé por dónde empezar, y no puedo dejar de llorar.Reseña Pendiente...
This time Colleen only discussed one subject and focused on it which made me happy she listened to the criticism of last book.🌟 I am going to start my thoughts in order: The cover is not that good looking to be honest.
Do you know that Endometriosis causes infertility and since it was mentioned in the past the they should have effing tried to treat it, there are many simple ways to treat it with all the advance medicine!!🌟 Then the conclusion was good and the ending was also well written so that was good.🌟 The writing style is as good as ever, I mean this is Colleen Hoover so no objections and the plots were good but I couldn’t ignore the things that were not well explained.“The problem is, love and happiness are not concordant.
Graham announces to Quinn that his girlfriend is in Ethan's apartment, having sex with him at this very moment.
After the initial shock wears off, Quinn and Graham wait for Ethan and Sasha to come out the door, and steal and eat the Chinese takeout food that Ethan's had delivered to his apartment.
It alternates between two timelines: Quinn and Graham's meeting and initial romance (sexytimes alert!) and seven years later, when their marriage and relationship is on the rocks after years of struggling with Quinn's inability to get pregnant.
There are some good secondary characters, especially Quinn's sister Ava, and the earlier timeline is a very heartwarming romance.
“If you only shine light on your flaws, all your perfects will dim.” Hands down one of CoHo's saddest books, it's definitely up there with Hopeless and Too Late. I woke up with a headache from all the crying last night. I would advise being in the right mood to read it because it can be emotionally draining, especially if you're not in the right mindset.

“If you only shine light on your flaws, all your perfects will dim.” Hands down one of CoHo's saddest books, it's definitely up there with Hopeless and Too Late.
Trigger warning: (view spoiler)[ infertility, depression, divorce, cheating  (hide spoiler)]All Your Perfects was so different from the books I usually read.
One of my favourite things about this book is the way it describes long term relationships and marriages.
“Our marriage hasn’t been perfect.
No marriage is perfect.
The secret to our longevity is that we never gave up at the same time.”I don't think I can do this book justice with a review.
As engaging as her previous novels!
Colleen Hoover is one of my favorite authors and I've been fortunate to enjoy almost every single book she has published.
This is the story of Quinn and Graham's marriage, its ups, downs and everything in between.
The novel is character driven and emotionally engaging.
The timeline alternates between the present and the past and is told from the point of view of Quinn.
There's love, humor, sadness, and reflection.
I just loved it.
Hope she becomes a new favorite author and that you enjoy her books as much as I have.
ALL THE STARS!!!!  “If you only shine light on your flaws, all your perfects will dim.”   Oh man, I cried a lot reading this one. And since crying while reading books is a rarity for me, I tend to give 5 stars to those books because a book that can move me in that way is a book worth of my favorites list.  “I knew everything I needed to know the first night I met you. Nothing external could ever influence my opinion of you.”  As you may know if you’ve read some of my reviews in the past, Collee
As you may know if you’ve read some of my reviews in the past, Colleen Hoover has always been a hit or miss author for me.
Don’t get me wrong, I absolutely adore her and think all of her books are well written, but I haven’t really loved all of the books of her I’ve read in the past.
Anyways, the ones I’ve loved, like November 9 and It Ends With Us, I’ve really, really loved, and All Your Perfects is definitely one of those.
Quinn’s POV benefited a lot from Hoover’s sparse but emotional prose.
Maybe it was an attempt to make the story more suspenseful than it is or emotional, but whatever the reason was, it didn’t work for me.
And now that I think about it, this book didn’t have a lot of characters.
We get to meet Quinn’s sister and her husband, Quinn and Graham’s exes, and Graham’s sister, but they’re not very well-developed characters.
Like it’s not enough that Quinn is infertile, she has to suffer more tragedy, she has get cheated on.
I don't think I want to put myself through this angst fest again :SWhile the struggle with infertility isn't something I'm familiar with, I was able to understand the emotions the heroine of this book was going through.
A lot of other aspects of the story, specifically the issues some people go through in their marriage, I could definitely relate to.
No marriage is perfect...
I think Colleen Hoover explains it perfectly in this book.
If you're looking for an emotional rollercoaster of a story - do pick this one up.
I listened to the audiobook and it was excellent, definitely recommend.
One of my most favorite things every year is the excitement I develop to read a new Colleen Hoover book. It’s just a fun feeling that I am sure is felt by many others as well. The anticipation, the hype, the support that she has, it’s all just so much fun to participate in. All Your Perfects was no different for me. “No matter how much you love someone- the capacity of that love is meaningless if it outweighs your capacity to forgive.” I would like to introduce you all to my new favorite coho bo
One of my most favorite things every year is the excitement I develop to read a new Colleen Hoover book.
I would like to introduce you all to my new favorite coho book.
I do want to apologize to Hopeless though because that one held on so strong for so many years but All Your Perfects just impacted me in such an emotional and personal way, therefore it has been promoted to new favorite.
I understand every part of this book way more than what I’d like to.
