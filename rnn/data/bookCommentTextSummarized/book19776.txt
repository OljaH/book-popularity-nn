(I mean, Catie liked it, and she's my go-to person for good books - so what's *wrong* with me???)I think my first stumbling point was the puzzling childishness of this story - including the 'epic' bits and all the 'dangers' the characters faced.
The number of times Finnikin charges someone, has a fight (without any physical consequences EVER!) - just to become their BFF afterwards was getting too much to count.Anyway, I was more than willing to overlook the flaws - I do that all the time, in the countless books that I love.
It’s hard.
And on the twin bright side, I do have as feeling that I won’t have the same experience with the next two books in the series.The real problem is that it took me a long time to see the characters as real people.
Not because it’s rather super slow-paced and there’s quite a lot of walking done by the characters (they should learn to run sometime), but because there’s so much heartache, so much sadness, so much struggling to do the right thing.
I commend anyone who has read this book.
It’s like reading five books in one.
Always your choice.So, I stared at the book when I got home and silently told myself, "This better be good or I'm going to troll the shit outta Kennedy's review." It wasn't a threat, it was a promise.At about 15% into the book, I completely forgot about my vow to make her previous trolls look like cute bunnies.At about 25% in, even though I checked the book out from the library, I purchased the Kindle edition for my iPad so I could read late into the night while my household slept.At about 35% in, anyone who attempted to talk with me while I was glued to the book was met with silence or a growl.
Oh my god, this book was amazing!Melina Merchetta, you humble me.
THIS is how you write an epic book.Badass, Marchetta.
You know, I wish Melina Marchetta would be more considerate of my mind - it's exhausting, having it blown all the time.
As seen on The ReadventurerMy second reading of Finnikin of the Rock and I am changing my mind - 5 stars!Now, when I have more fantasy under my belt to compare this book to, I am pretty confident it offers something that many others in the genre don't.
However, there are so many other things about Finnikin of the Rock I loved that I am happy to overlook the obvious flaws, to stick to my 5 stars and to wait for Froi of the Exiles with eager anticipation.
Whenever I write a review of a Melina Marchetta book, I risk sounding like the same old broken record... but, whatever, it's not my fault if she constantly manages to deliver the stuff I love! I'm not sure what'll happen if I ever dislike one of her novels, probably the sky will fall in and the world will end. Don't you know what to expect from Marchetta by now? If not, then I'll fill you in briefly: interesting, memorable and the very opposite of cliched characters, flawless writing, a plot th
If not, then I'll fill you in briefly: interesting, memorable and the very opposite of cliched characters, flawless writing, a plot that is gripping even though it isn't about supernatural creatures taking over the world (yet - but I'm actually curious to see how she'd handle that genre)...
This sudden change in my opinion of the fantasy genre was only solidified by reading Finnikin of the Rock.It's difficult to pick a favourite character when they are all so well developed, and also difficult to pick a favourite part of the novel when it's full of some of the best-written action, adventure and romance scenes.
I've said it before and I'm sure I'll be saying it again: Melina Marchetta never ever wastes characters.
There isn't one thing I can point out that makes me say "this" is why I don't like her books, but there are numerous problems I can draw attention to.My biggest gripe is that the plot hinges on assumptions made by numerous characters.
Although, Marchetta does address this by having one of the characters point out to Finnikin that if he knew the truth then he wouldn’t have made the right choices.
I liked Finnikin until he decided that he was in love with Evanjalin; which was yet another thing that didn’t occur naturally.
This is not a review. This is a badly written poem. “Then I choose to drown,” Finnikin said. “In hope. Rather than float into nothing.” Since I was a nipper I have come to the conclusionThat when it comes to fantasy: I am strongly opposed. When I read a book with long, confusing namesAnd swords and maps, its pages remain closed. So imagine my surprise when I finished this one(In the early hours of this morning, I feel I should note)That my stomach was rumbling (I had no time to eat!)And my heart
They are complex, compelling and always sexy brave,And they treat their chosen one like an equal except Will.From Jonah to Mackee to good old Trevanion Finn.(On Froi, the jury is out ‘til the sequel) But this book isn’t about the boys for the ladies are the ones to watchWith their passion and love and their unrelenting loyaltyAnd determination to show they will fight for what’s rightFrom the goddesses to the lost ones and, of course, the royalty.
But it’s easy to see, from my other reviews, that I am smittenWith every single book that Ms Marchetta has written.
I just know that I will always have a warmest place in my heart for Evangalin, Froi, Finnikin, Sir Topher, Trevanion, Lucian, Lord Augie, Lady Abie and even Balthazar.
And I also know that that is such a small as to be almost insignificant thing to give to these characters who'd been through so much cruelty, so much heartbreaks, just so much.I was so emotional - at times my heart was so full with the pride of them all yet other times I could NOT stopped laughing!

12/07/16 Kindle deal today for 1.99 here Buddy Read/Re-read with a great group of people at Lumatere Chronicles Group Read starting with Finnikin on Dec 1 2015So wonderful, the second time trough I loved it more so I'm bumping the rating up to 4.5 stars.I laughed, cried and was just amazed by the complexity of the characters in the story Marchetta tells.
Evanjalin is a mystic of sorts and convinces Finnikin it is his quest to help her return a king to their people and help them break the curse and so our quest begins.It seems like Evanjalin is playing by a set of rules no one else can knows and right away it is unclear if she is a force of good or bad, but it is certain she is a force to be reckoned with.
Unreadable. I hated Evanjalin (I should have known from the spelling of her named). The POV and storyline kept jumping back and forth and gave me a headache. We're also supposed to care about the entire history from the day of creation of this world and all of its nation, it seems. Too much world-creation crammed into a lacking plot and failed to capture my attention.And Froi. I'm supposed to feel empathy for and look forward to reading the next book about a boy that tried to rape the female protagonist? No. Just no.
It's fun and enjoyable, but I, however, wasn't able to enjoy it because I was dragging this book for almost an entire month.
This was my first High Fantasy read and I can successfully say, I enjoyed it.
It wasn't anything original, typical, my-kingdom-has-fallen-and-someone-claims-the-real-king-is-alive-so-off-we-go-to-revive-the-kingdom.
Tbh, like I probably mentioned before, I kind of forgot things while reading this so I'm not sure if there is anything special about Finnikin.
Froi is my son and I love him sm and I can't wait to read his story.
Overall, this was an interesting experience and I'm pretty sure High Fantasy people will love this.
I loved the characters, even though they frustrated the HECK out of me sometimes, and even though some of their decisions felt more like plot devices than actual decisions people would make.
This book takes a little bit to actually get going and took me about 100 pages to fully get into it, but when it gets good it gets so good.I WAS SO EMOTIONAL A LOT OF THE TIME LIKE HOW CAN THIS BOOK MAKE ME SO EMOTIONAL WITH LIKE 5 PAGES OF BACK STORY.
Usually 200-paged books are WAY too short for me, and salt is a look that should last a long time on me, but I just wanted to end it all??
No thanks.Then there were some other minor characters, but I don’t care enough about them to talk about them so.🌹🌷🌹🌷🌹🌷🌹🌷🌹🌷🌹🌷🌹🌷🌹🌷🌹🌷🌹🌷🌹🌷🌹🌷🌹🌷🌹On top of literally feeling my life slowly drain away from how much the book dragged, the romance made me want to die even more!!!
(But then again, I don’t usually see things coming, like how much I’d be disappointed by this book.) But they weren’t SHOCKING???
But if you want to try to read this, I literally don’t care.
As if being the fan proclaimed Queen of YA realistic fiction wasn't enough, she had to go and write Finnikin of the Rock and prove to her fans and critics alike that labels and genres mean nothing to her, that she's in the top tier no matter what the task calls for.
Like all kingdoms, there is a King and Queen who rule over its people.
This leads to the slaughter of the King and Queen and their heirs, and soon after they are replaced by an imposter king and the majority of Lumatere's people become exiles.
4 stars - 4.5 stars - 5 stars? Oh, well, I don't know people. Sorry.Finnikin of the Rock is the story of people who try to step forward, and forward, and forward... Until perhaps, one day, perhaps they'll share a land called home again. "Speak, Finnikin wanted to shout at her. Lay blame. Shout. Rage. Rage!"

Sorry.Finnikin of the Rock is the story of people who try to step forward, and forward, and forward...
I'll be honest, I didn't expect it to move me so much - and yeah, I realized pretty fast what a fool I'd been to underestimate Melina Marchetta's ability to take my heart and squeeze it.
The fact is, I'm always fooled in the same way with this author : I'm travelling through her words, confident, conceited even, until I come across a sentence which breaks my heart.
The only thing you need to know is this : following Finnikin, Evanjelin, Sir Topher and all the other *cough* Froi!
Buddy read with my darlings Nab & Basuhi  & Hershey  Final rating: 5/5 starsFinal rating - for the whole series: 5.5/5 stars“Be prepared for the worst, my love, for it lives next door to the best.” This is not the first time that i have read this book. This is my second time and i love it as much as i did back then. My feelings stayed true to it, and that wont change easily as it seems. So, you should know that i am writing this review while having in mind that i have also read the rest
I love her stories, her writing style, her characters - basically everything.
But people of Lumatere won't give up easily - Finnikin of the Rock, Evanjalin of the Novices and Sir Topher travel to find the lost heir to the throne, prince Balthazar.The world building is amazing.
____________________________________________CHARACTERS: ____________________________________________♦ Finnikin:Finnikin of the Rock, son of the captain of the King's guard, searches and hopes to find his childhood friend, the rightful heir to the throne, Balthazar.

I’ve put off writing this review for some time now because I know I won’t do this book justice. (Also, I was lazy and I have an exam coming up, but details, details.)   Pros  - The writing is gorgeous. It has a poetic touch yet the book remains dauntingly mysterious- Complex and developed plot- The characters – I would  die  for them- WE ACTUALLY GET A POSITIVE REPRESENTATION OF A FATHER/SON RELATIONSHIP IM SCREAMING- I felt like I was being stabbed in the heart, multiple times- Melina Marchetta
I’ve put off writing this review for some time now because I know I won’t do this book justice.
Rather than float into nothing.” 5 stars!!~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~`` Fake  buddy read  with  Pragya  and  real buddy read  with  Silvia   it was all a liebc everyone knows I'm Marchetta Trash™
I really liked this book, I am finding it hard to write a review on it though.. I found it confusing at times, but that didn't bother me? That sounds bad, but it was sort of the good kind of confusing... I don't even know what's going on with this review. Okay, bye.
Along on his journey, the beautiful but wild Evanjalin, his mentor and teacher, Sir Topher and thief Froi come together to find the mystery between the country’s impostor king and the biggest secret that is known in the entire kingdom.Full of adventure, wonderful story telling, highly developed characters and a mystery that will have you wanting more, Finnikan of the Rock is clearly a winner.
I love big stories with several plots, and the setting just sounds so unbelievably like the medieval time which I love that I couldn’t help but fall for the characters and their problems.Finnikin is an agreeable character and highly suspicious of Evanjalin for she’s stubborn and always argues with him a lot.
4 STARS”You asked me once what my magic was.That is my magic.” I am now convinced Melina Marchetta is made of equal parts freshly-baked cookies, clean laundry, pixie dust and waffles. Something about her books just comforts me in ways I cannot attempt to capture into words. Her oeuvre covers themes that in their simplicity would probably come across emotionally exploitative in lesser hands, but her crafty storytelling effortlessly ties textured characters with my personal reflexes and sentiment
They travel to the Cloister of Lagrami where a novice named Evanjalin claims to walk in the dreams of the remaining Lumaterans within the walls has walked into Prince Balthazar’s dream.While I’ve read (and loved) nearly all her contemporary books, it took me a bit of time to brave The Lumatere Chronicles.
Where Finnikin, Evanjalin and Sir Topher gathers the necessary implements and pieces to their fractured hopes to get their people home.Though certainly, Marchetta's fingerprint is still all over the place: Trevonian and Beatriss had a little of Sam and Georgie while the way the five days of the unspeakable was revealed is pretty much the standard in her books.
But I've also read a lot of books multiple times where that feeling holds up, and for some reason it just didn't really do that for me with this book.
I just knew that I had to keep reading to find out what these boys were promising, and what would happen, and how it would all end up!The main part of the book picks up ten years after the prologue.
There he meets Evanjalin, a young novice who joins him and Sir Topher on their trip.This is a lot of explanation, so that's all I'm going to leave you with.
My prayers have not been answered yet, Trevanion.
If she has more Finnikin of the Rock type books up her sleeve, my pocketbook is in a world of hurt because OMG this book blew my mind away and tugged at my heart the entire time!
After ten years in exile, Finnikin is led once again to a rock to meet a novice, Evanjalin, who is plagued by dreams of those held behind the walls of Lumatere waiting for someone to rescue them and return their land of light.
However, Finnikin of the Rock is one that I feel is worthy of sequels because simply put, I ♥ Finn.
I'm having a hard time pinning down what I didn't like about this story.
so many beautiful moments.
and here's the best explanation I can offer: I felt like a 3rd party viewer- sitting in the stands, watching events happen.
I never felt like I was in them.
Additionally, the pace was quite slow; and the story is told from multiple POVs -and I just felt like when I was finally connecting to Finnikin or Evanjalin..
Please, please do not let this keep you from reading the story.

What kind of book is Finnikin of the Rock?It's a fantasy book.
It continues with an invasion, a terrible curse and the struggle of one people to take back what they lost.For me Finnikin of the Rock is a book about identities.
So, end in end, this is a book that is only disguised as fantasy but that, in reality, is well above that.
It's probably superfluous to say that I really loved this book and I can't wait to read its sequel coming out in October.
My favorite passage:"Because without our language, we have lost ourselves.

I proclaim this is the year, I fell in love with Melina Marchetta.A fair warning to everyone, this is not a full review of any of the books, but instead a quick overview discussing what, I find thought provoking about the series.
She was tired of feeling helpless all the time."Did you hear what I said?" Tesadora asked, gripping her arm." They say were dirty," Phaedra cried, pulling free.
But, Lumatere Chronicles have so many interweaving threads, a reader can’t seem to take a break.In addition, to this series’ handful of depth and layers, this story is highly fueled by its remarkable characters.
I would heartily recommend Lumatere Chronicles to readers who are looking for a classic high fantasy book.
.me: this book sucksme @ myself: ok, but who tf asked ????you know when someone's like "oh, it hurts me to do this more than it hurts you" and you're just here like ( °_ °) seriously, you mcfreakin juiced carrot ??? i'm offended you would even say that to my face well, i'm here to say ...... *takes a deep breath* thishurtsmemorethanithurtsyou (tag yourself: i'm the juiced carrot, obv) i just wanted to start off by saying that because i thought that the day i rated melina marchetta anything less
*takes a deep breath* thishurtsmemorethanithurtsyou (tag yourself: i'm the juiced carrot, obv) i just wanted to start off by saying that because i thought that the day i rated melina marchetta anything less than a billion stars would be the day my very soul revolted against my body because damn.
and you know once you start skimming, all the characters could die, they world could burn, and you could be physically sucked into the book ala Inkheart and it still wouldn't be able to tread water
2.5 stars.
I don't know if I went into this with too high of expectations or what but i AM SO CONFUSED.
So many friends who love the same books as I do are huge fans of this one and kept saying I would love it, buuuuut....
I'm just extremely underwhelmed.
I recognize that it's the TYPE of book I would normally like (yay high fantasy), I wasn't huge on the writing style and never really got into anything.
I don't even have strong enough opinions about this book to dislike it!
It's just one bland, neutral...
bleh.
Wonderful, amazing, beautiful, absolutely brilliant... I need more stars! ★★★★★★★★★★  "Because without our language, we have lost ourselves. Who are we without our words?"  This was such a powerful story that got straight to my heart. After finishing it I was left speechless - Melina Marchetta has this effect on people. The characters are so well defined, the story is so complex... All that I've felt while reading Jellicoe Road I felt again while reading this book, and these 2 stories are nothin
Lucian vowed he would be the light whom they traveled toward in times of need.- EvanjalinA young novice that in the beginning does not tell as much, but as the story unfolds there are no words enough to express all that she holds inside, all that she had lived in those 10 years since the "five days of the unspeakable".
Or sell you to the slave traders of Sorel," Finnikin said with a shrug.- Sir TopherLet's accept our path, Finnikin, and hold our tongue, as the novice does so beautifully.- Froi Looking back, I didn't know what to make of him in the first book, but just wait for the next ones, there's so much to him that doesn't meet the eye."You never do anything stupid like that again," she whispered with fury.

Be prepared for the worst my love, for it lives next door to the bestWords fail me, Yes..I..can't...find...the...right...words, to express how shockingly raw, deep and unequivocally flawless my first read from Melina Marchetta was.
I shutter to think the gigantic mistake that I would have made if I had DNF this thing of beauty to early.Finnikin, Evanjalin, Sir Topher, Froi, Trevanion and Perri are just are few of the characters in this book that I fell in love with.
I loved how his character grew throughout this book.
