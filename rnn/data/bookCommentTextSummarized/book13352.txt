Remember, remember the fifth of November... This TPB edition collects the original 10 comic book issues, then divided in the graphic novel in three chapters.Creative Team:Writer: Alan MooreIllustrator: David Lloyd VALIANT VERICITY  Remember, remember! The fifth of November, the gunpowder treason and plot; I know of no reason why the gunpowder treason should ever be forgot! It's one of the first sentences that came to mind when you think about the masterpiece by Alan Moore & David Lloyd. And
This is my favorite graphic novel ever!One of the first impacts when I read reading this graphic novel the first time, it was when I realized that you don't start to read in the beginning of the story.No, the plan of "V" is so carefully crafted that when the government think that he started, he is already finishing it.
But, honestly, as a hardcore Alan Moore's fan, I think that the changes are good thinking that film is a different format than comic book and therefore, some things can be changed and still delivering the same powerful message.
(A-) 83% | Very GoodNotes: A Miltonian antihero in an Orwellian world, the hero's a kind of philosopher Batman, but for anarchy instead of law.
For all of the criticism heaped on movie versions of novels and other literary works (well deserved in many cases), there are times when the filmmakers get it very right (e.g., Lord of the Rings, the Princess Bride, Schindler’s List). The Graphic Novel, in particular, is a format that lends itself well to adaptation and, in the right hands, can often IMPROVE on the source material. Examples of this, IMHO, would include: From Hell, Road to Perdition and Sin City. To that small but distinctive li
For all of the criticism heaped on movie versions of novels and other literary works (well deserved in many cases), there are times when the filmmakers get it very right (e.g., Lord of the Rings, the Princess Bride, Schindler’s List).
To that small but distinctive list I would add V for Vendetta as I thought the film version was superior to the print.
While reading, I often found myself thinking to myself that I preferred the film's vision of the narrative.
Without spoilerizing, one example of this is that I thought, in general, the character depictions were vastly enhanced, largely due to the superior casting.
I adored this graphic novel, every single page of it. If I could give it more than 5 stars, then I would.
I freaking love the movie and I love this novel!! One day I will add the pic of me in my V mask! I just need to get a good hat and cape 😉Happy Reading! Mel 🖤🐶🐺🐾
Alan Moore depicts these questions in this scary graphic novel that is set in some crazy right-winged London that reeks of fascism and corruption.
Indeed, what he exacts is a form of manipulative control, which is the very thing he is trying to destroy through his wave of terrorism.
I don’t think he’s any better that what he is trying to destroy, but perhaps that’s the idea.
Perhaps, Moore is trying to suggest that corruption is the very essence of human nature, and that nobody is beyond it.
Like a philosopher hashing out his ideas, Moore explores his theme by setting limits to focus the hypothesis.Whether V can be excused or praised outside his personal motivations is another argument, but the fact that Moore has isolated and located this argument at a point in narrative space shows his thoughtful, deliberate mastery of the form.Like Watchmen, the film version mostly strips out this layer of complexity, and is content (like the majority of action films or violent dystopias) to let this personal struggle be the end of the moral question, thus reducing V to a violent hero (or antihero).

The BOOK turned out to be a graphic novel.
I asked if this was an illustrated version of the literature and searched to discover that this WAS the book.
So the graphic novel sat on my bookcase for months and months while I read other books, more traditionally published.
But then I learned that Neil Gaiman had published The Sandman series and I recalled fondly my high school days when I read Marvel and DC comics and I have helped to enliven in my youngest son a fondness for the comics as well and he and I have had fun as he discovered this exciting medium.
Sure, apparently innocent people will get harmed , but, ultimately, all the world’s problems are these people’s fault anyway, so why shouldn’t they suffer for their poor choices.To describe the story as convoluted is to be gracious to its famous writer, because this tale is filled with ambiguity to the point a reader has no idea if V is a “good” guy, a “bad” guy, or just some mentally deranged person running around killing people and blowing things up for fun.
Rather, it is just another piece of political ideology, where the writer frames the narrative in his terms so that only his viewpoint is attractive, and as such, it is better left undisturbed by those seeking a true story.
If Watchmen is Alan Moore's Sergeant Pepper, and From Hell his Abbey Road (And in the end the love you take is equal to the number of prostitutes you disembowl) then V For Vendetta is his Rubber Soul.
Like Rubber Soul it tends to get overlooked and undervalued because it's "merely" a perfect pop record rather then a artform redefining masterpiece.
Not because I have any great love for government, but because I side with The Joker in my firm belief that so called "civilized" people will eat eachother alive when given the slightest reason or provocation.
Hell most of them do it anyway.Anyway rant ended, great book, Alan Moore Prevails.
The proof of the enduring quality of the tale is not necessarily in the success of the movie version (which I liked even better than the comic), but in the recent proliferation of masked 'Guy Fawkes' anarchists who are starting to challenge their governments in their abuse of authority, and who believe in the freedom of information and the freedom of expression, with Wikileaks, Anonymous, assorted whistleblowers and antiglobalization protesters hopefully only the tip of the iceberg: People should not be afraid of their government.
اوج این شیوه ی روایت رو توی کمیک دیگه از همین نویسنده، "نگهبانان" میتونید ببینید.علاوه بر شیوه ی روایت، پایان کمیک به کلی با پایان فیلم متفاوته.
این که هیچ چالشی سر راهش نیست، از جذابیت داستان کم میکنه.ثانیاً "وی" زیادی شعار میده که باعث میشه تک جمله های نابی که بعضی وقت ها میگه، بین انبوه سخنرانی هاش به چشم نیان و هدر برن.جدای از این ها، شخصیت شوخ طبع، قدرتمند و حکیم "وی" خوب و به یاد موندنی بود و "هیو ویوینگ" خیلی خوب نقشش رو توی فیلم در آورده بود (هر چند فقط صداش شنیده میشد.)
It’s a celebrated classic by the most acclaimed comics writer of all time, Alan Moore, and is one of the few books many non-comics readers have read.
V for Vendetta is a badly written, even more poorly conceived pamphlet espousing anarchism as the ideal political system featuring non-characters in a moronic dystopian future world with a storyline of the most convoluted revenge.
Hearing an argument - made numerous times - against fascism is like listening to a child who’s just discovered Hitler and the Nazis and is telling everyone what a bad thing they were.
That was a great graphic novel!In dystopian times, the UK government has taken all civil liberties from the citizens, allowing them to spy on anyone without warrant at anytime. V will stand against the oppressive and controlling British government at all costs. The masked hero V is a good crusader like Batman or Zorro, but for me and because of his relationship with Evey, he has a lot of similarities with the Phantom of the Opera. Both are masked (because of their deformed face) and they have a score to settle....
I know of no reason why the gunpowder treason should ever be forgot." —V for Vendetta, film adaptation (2005)."V for Vendetta" es la tremenda novela gráfica escrita por el brillante autor Alan Moore e ilustrada por David Lloyd; una distopía que refleja la crudeza del carácter opresor del gobierno, su injusticia y la verdadera esencia del anarquismo.En el año de 1997, tras el fin de la tercera guerra mundial, la conversión de Londres en un estado fascista, la erradicación de musulmanes, negros y homosexuales, emerge de las cenizas de un campo de concentración, V, el máximo anarquista y terrorista de los tiempos que se viven.
This stems, I think, primarily from the fact that it's an anarchist comic, and making anarchism into a coherent and attractive viewpoint is nearly impossible, given that anarchism is probably the illest-conceived of any extant ideology.However, because it's ANARCHISM, because the writing is coherent and cleverer than most graphic novels', because it's all draped over with mystery, because it's a well-designed book, tone and layout-wise, and because the art is fantastic, the essential failure of the book-- the fact that it lacks anything behind its shell of hyperenergetic blathering-- gets a pass.Seriously.
My very first comic / graphic novel - and yes, I don't really know the difference except, maybe, that graphic novels are darker than the typical comic books?
;pBy the way, since this is the first graphic novel I've read and am reviewing, I thought it appropriate to finally try including images / gifs - if you don't think it appropriate, shut up.
However, since I have seen the movie several times and love it, I decided this would be the perfect try.And it was.You probably all know that the story depicts a grim future with a totalitarian regime that rules through fear.
remember remember the 5th of novemberΒαθιά πολιτικό, συνδυάζει το μέλλον με το παρελθόν σε μια υπόθεση που θα μπορούσε να διαδραματίζεται στο παρόν, το παρελθόν ή το μέλλον. Εκπληκτική σύλληψη και υλοποίηση της ιδέας, κάνονας απόλυτα σαφή τα μηνύματα που θέλει να δώσει. Εξαιρετικό και το σκίτσο. Εξαιρετική και η ταινία (πόσους υπέροχους ρόλους έχει παίξει ο Hugo Weaving - Matrix, Lord of the Rings, V for Vendetta...)
The 5th of November....One of a very long waited to-read that been sitting on my shelf for so long.As a Story, it's almost 4 ☆☆☆☆, but the art is totally 2 ☆☆.Yet both have its own high points and low ones...More on that on the full review.
I shall not spoil the rest of the story or the plot for you-especially if you are unfamiliar with what happens.The plot of the angst driven anti-hero fighting a fascist government is really not that original, but what sets this book apart is Alan Moore's prose.
Quite in keeping with the nature of the government in the tale.If you are looking for a great story, phenomenal prose that will stay with you after finishing the book and most of all- the salient points it makes about people and their particular relationship with their government, self-development and concepts of what is freedom make this a deep book.
In times of darkness and great need, we look for a hero.
Tick-tock, times up for some very bad people.
Book 2:The saga continues, but this time we see Evey and her trajectory.
Do you take it?I actually found this more cogent than the movie version.
While the cinema was beautifully shot, this showed the transitions better, albeit in a longer fashion rather than a few cuts.
The power and depth of V as an entity and the use of letter is sketched out better.
I liked the movie, but this was superior.
There were a series of experiments on human prisoners in one of the camps with one prisoner surviving and acquiring super-human abilities (as well as some touch of madness).
The novel feels like anarchist propaganda with some pictures and disjoint plot-lines thrown in.
The movie had a good plot with side plots going nowhere removed and the main characters being more interesting (Evey in the novel feels like an empty shell, no so in the movie).I already mentioned some parts of the plot being nothing but filler.
In fact, from the humanity experience it was not much better that fascism for which is was a proposed cure in the novel.
Reto 22- 2018 Book Challenge: Un libro con una aliteración en el título. Todo el mundo es especial. Todos. Todo el mundo es un héroe, un amante, un loco, un villano. Todos. Todo el mundo tiene su historia para contar.
The prose is simply beautiful - I felt like hugging every word uttered in it, specially in Valerie's letter:"“But what I hope most of all is that you understand what I mean when I tell you that even though I do not know you, and even though I may never meet you, laugh with you, cry with you, or kiss you.
I love you.
Moore won't tell you what kind of government is better but simply that one must not give in to a order full of injustice; and that such order should definitely be broken.
I can think of no reason why the Gunpowder Treason should ever be forgot.”V for Vendetta is one of my favorite movies of all time.
For that reason, I never read the graphic novel that inspired the movie, for fear that it would fall short.
I wasn’t disappointed at all, and this is now my favorite graphic novel.I think of V for Vendetta as an alternate 1984, one where Winston and Julia fought back against Big Brother and won.
In both V for Vendetta and 1984, those bigots and fear mongers succeeded.
4.5 StarsDamn. Alan Moore is one hell of a writer. This was written in the 80's yet the parallels to today...it’s chilling. I watched the movie years ago and liked it but I always hesitated on reading the graphic novel. I’m glad I finally did. The political and social commentary is still very relevant. I wasn’t the biggest fan of the illustrations. I often found it difficult to decipher who was who in the panels so if their names weren’t said, I wasn’t always sure who was present. Other than that though, an almost perfect comic.
Ugh.So I read this book because people seem to think it is this great political tome and V is this great revolutionary character.
V saves her from being raped and murdered - and I could get into a diatribe here about how much I dislike sexual violence being used for entertainment, but I'll save it for a later point - only to be tortured into seeing things his way and working with him, which brings me to...2.
Also, the political rantings are vague, shallow, boring, and, um, sort of senseless ranting.
There are other ways to establish bad characters and fucked up social structures.
From the same author as the superb and similarly pessimistic Watchmen (reviewed by yours truly here), the story takes place in a future England following a global nuclear conflict with England tightly ruled by a vicious, vindictive, totalitarian Fascist party, the Norsefire, that has killed off the “denizens” of society (minorities, homosexuals, etc) in concentration camps.
Another major departure from the book was the confrontation at the end between V and the Finger where the blood splashes as V hacks through the secret police troups – again classic Wachowski (Hugo Weaving borrowing some of his Smith moves from Matrix) but still lots of fun to watch.
Cómic visionario que está lleno de buenos valores a pesar de la crueldad y violencia que encontramos en sus páginas. Un obra de culto imprescindible para los amantes del arte secuencial.
