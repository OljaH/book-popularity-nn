. She falls for him because: Depends on who you‚Äôre asking.If you asked me, I‚Äôd say that she just couldn‚Äôt resist his charming personality.If you asked a fan of tortured heroes in romance, she‚Äôd say that she saw through his bad boy fa√ßade and that underneath it, was a tender heart craving to be loved.If you asked Freud, he‚Äôd be on it for a week.Surgeon General's Warning: Trauma Unit, kindly proceed to Ancient Rome to tend to the wounds of a very tortured hero.
The Devil's Advocate: Bad boy finding his true love is probably the most popular female fantasy after Channing Tatum.
Dance with the DevilI'm thinking...Phury + (-) + Zadist = Zarek.Zarek was very much like Zadist from Black Dagger Brotherhood, and I LOVE ZADIST!! If you take Phury away from Zadist you'll be left with Zarek. This probably makes no sense at all but that's all i could think throughout the whole book. Maybe it was a mistake to start this series with this book because now i hate all other hunters! Except Ash. Full review to come...
‚ÄúDying‚Äôs easy. It‚Äôs living that‚Äôs hard.‚Äù  Dance with the Devil is a perfect romance, the beautiful love story of Zarek and Astrid. Certainly, it's not simply a romance: there is an incredible plot and fast-paced action, suffering and dread, twists and turns, revealed secrets, humor, one of the most heartbreaking background story ever, and fascinating secondary characters.But the main attraction of the novel is the story of the two of them, the development of the love and relationship of Astrid

She held her hand out to him.
‚ÄúYou have to learn to trust someone, Zarek.
Dance with the Devil will always remain one of my all-time favorites.
I felt quite sorry for Zarek in this one, he‚Äôd had a terrible life and hadn‚Äôt even been shown love by his own father. He and Astrid made a good couple though.6.5 out of 10
Obviously, he needed to have his revenge.Astrid: She was sent to judge Zarek, but she could not resist his dark charm.
She slowly breaks through Zarek, she makes him feel loved, she gives him cotton candy to taste, she follows him in his nightmares, she teaches him how to make love, she falls desperately in love with him.One thing I loved: Both Zarek and Astrid love the book "the Little Prince" and they say passages and recite favourite quotes to each other while they are falling in love.Settings: AlaskaI greatly enjoyed the story.
He's one of my favourite characters and I'm really glad I got to read his story.
I adored Astrid and her undiing strenght to not let go of Zarek and to show him the beauty of kindness and love.
Well...OK, so let's get to the grand plot, shall we?
Why exactly can't he!?' Seriously, I liked Acheron in the previous books but now I just want to kill him.
Then why does she write such a weak plot, where he's nothing but a bitch for the bratty, slutty Artemis.
What matters is that Zarek's story is amazing and you definitely should give it a try.
So, even though Zarek is a Dark-Hunter and therefore very powerful, we've got the vulnerable Astrid to balance it out.3.) This book employs one of my all-time favorite tropes: bring-the-dangerous-wounded-man-home-and-heal-him-while-falling-in-love tropes.
I mean, I can think of a thousand things a man can do to disrespect a woman sexually, but it's definitely not anything Kenyon writes about.
What he's doing is a safe, loving, respectful (for a boyfriend) activity and not even in the least bit dirty, shameful, or letting a man 'handle' you, which to me makes it sound like he's doing something disrespectful, violent, or unwanted - which he isn't.This isn't the first time Kenyon's pulled this crap - she did it in Night Pleasures when the hero grabs the heroine's ass while they are kissing.
Even though the story took place within a matter of days, much like the previous books, the connection between Zarek and Astrid was more palpable and consequently more believable to me, because they actually spent large swaths of time virtually alone together, during which they were able to communicate on a fairly deep level.
The only thing about Zarek which I would have liked to know that wasn't told, is exactly how he became a Dark-Hunter and what his act of vengeance was.
Zarek was a whipping boy and then a slave during his mortal life.
I know it's disgusting, but I stand by my decision.Astrid is a justice nymph who is sent in to judge immortals when the gods are thinking of killing them.
Zarek, of course, is rude and prickly as ever, but he also finds her attractive and does nice things for her behind her back.
I have two young men who bring over loads of friends all of the time and shoving a whole pancake into their mouths would be a good day.
His mortal life apparently sucked, and his immortal life doesn't look like it's much better.
This was my first Sherrilyn Kenyon book (once upon a time) and it was the book that started my love of the Dark-Hunters.
The only other hero that comes close to Zarek‚Äôs torment (and actually surpassing it) is Acheron, who is one of my other Dark-Hunter loves.There are a few books that I love having multiple copies of.
I know Zarek is a character I‚Äôll revisit often, and actually being able to read the book at any moment, no matter where I am made the decision to purchase the Kindle version easy for me.
A pesar de todos esos peros, este es el libro de la saga que m√°s me ha gustado hasta la fecha.
Y toda la culpa la tiene ese maravilloso personaje que es Zarek, ese sarc√°stico fan de Nazareth que no ha perdido su humanidad a√∫n cuya vida, tanto como humano como Dark Hunter, no ha podido ser m√°s terrible.
Sin olvidarme de la tierna relaci√≥n de Ash y Simi, otros dos grand√≠simos personajes de los que uno quiere saber siempre m√°s.
4.5 starsLast book of 2016 and I'm so glad it was a great read!
When I read the previous book, Night Embrace, I liked Zarek so much I got super excited to start this story, which is this book.
I tend to find heroines annoying, but Astrid was definitely not annoying!
The plot was different from the previous books and it was refreshing.
Also, there were new characters introduced and older characters making appearances again and I can't wait to read their stories.
Also, it was not filled with confusing new concepts like with the previous book, which was great.
This fourth book in Sherrilyn Kenyon's Dark Hunter series is one of my favorites. Zarek is an incredible hero with a horribly tortured soul. I wept for him, and I was angry in his behalf... words can't express just how much I adore him.Interestingly enough, Zarek is one of the most tormented heroes I can think of, next to Zsadist, Brother extraordinaire from the Black Dagger Brotherhood. Zarek and Zsadist... hmmmm.... must be a "Z" thing.
I give this book 5 stars solely for Zarek. I cried so many times for his story. Was she inspired by JR Ward's Z who'd been a slave. Coincidence or not? Anyway, I cried buckets over Zarek. Now it's a toss up between Kerian and Zarek for who I like better. My only beef is more new characters were brought in. Where are those from the last story?
4.5 MI Pr√≠ncipe Encantado STARS Este libro me dej√≥ con el coraz√≥n roto üíîüíîüíî emocionalmente hecha papilla üò≠üò≠üò≠ y con deseos asesinos para cierta Diosa üò†üò†üëäüëäüî™üî™M√°s adelante har√© una rese√±a mejor
It wrenched my heart just to think about how deeply hurt he had been.Astrid was the justice nymph who was sent to pass judgment on Zarek.
They both fell in love with each other, but Zarek thought he was a worthless slave who didn‚Äôt deserve her.
I had never thought reading PNR story could move me to tears!I really loved this couple!By the way, there were some background stories of the other interesting characters that made me want to know more about them.This is by far one of the most enjoyable books I‚Äôve ever read.
De momento este se lleva la palma en la escala de dram√≥n :'(
I have a love/hate relationship with Sherrilyn Kenyon.
Could we have one male who likes himself and his inner child?
Other than that, I liked this story.
Astrid is the judge who Themis sent to either save him or kill him.
Or is Acheron right and he's redeemable?I love how we see more of Ash here than ever, and we see his and Artemis' relationship.
I got a bit bored with the action/lack of action mid-way through, but then it picked up again.
I loved the ending, and I like Zarek.
Astrid was perfect for him, and they got their HEA.
Pense que este libro no me iba a gustar tanto como los anteriores y me equivoque, TERMINE AMANDO A ZAREK ‚ô•‚ô•Artemisa es una puta que merece morir,Adore a SimiY me encanta AshSasha me hizo reir mucho!Sin lugar a dudas este libro entro en mi corazon ‚ô•‚ô•

Finally, with Ash's help, Zarek is able to realize that he deserves love, too, and goes to Astrid.
At the end of this book, Zarek remains one of my favorite characters from the series and he'll always have a special place in my heart.Astrid was an interesting character.
She gave Zarek something special, something all his own, and she stood by him even when he was trying to send her away.Simi, always an interesting character to me, was once again one of my favorite things about this book.
This is how Italians envision Zarek of Moesia. Yum. And let me tell you, his love words to Astrid, ‚Äúla mia stella‚Äù (my star)... ahhh... they sound much sexier in Italian.  ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚ú© Okay. This was a good read. By that I mean well written and a well developed world setting. It is just that it is pretty depressing reading about all the abuse Zarek suffered through-out his lifetime. Especially as a child. He was feared and rejected ‚Äì for the most part unfairly ‚Äì over and over. And for centuries! I rea
This is how Italians envision Zarek of Moesia.
It is just that it is pretty depressing reading about all the abuse Zarek suffered through-out his lifetime.
I really like the heroine, Astrid, a Justice Nymph.
**sigh** There is a lot of focus on the other characters in this world (which is not a bad thing, unless you want the romance to move forward faster): Acheron, the leader of the Dark-Hunters; Artemis, as the Dark-Hunters‚Äô primary goddess.
I definitely need to read a happy book now.
Zarek is a Dark Hunter, who has commited some terrible act in the past -about 1000 years ago- and was punished in exile in Alaska during all this time.
Acheron, leader of the Dark Hunters, steps in and asks for a judge to decide whether Zarek should live or die: the judge is to be Astrid, daughter of Thetis.Zarek, is the epitome of a tortured hero; I have never so far read about a more tortured one.
Astrid and Zarek try to defeat Thanatos (=Death) and run for their lifes, while other dark hunters along with Acheron get involved in the fight.
I feel pain and sorrow thinking about his life both before and after he became an immortal.
He subjugates himself to that bitch whore Artemis and others pay the price, like Zared.
She took some drastic measures to help him, but I was on board.Simi is just the best character!
Playing "this little piggy" on her toes....Plus she hates the bitch whore as much as I do - although she calls her the heifer goddess.Just about everyone else...I am pretty pissed at the lot of them because of how they treated Zared.
There is a lot of time spent reliving Zared's past.
Im only four books into the series, but it just keeps getting better and better!!!Thanks Aly for recommending this series :)))My Zarek:
I¬¥m only four books into the series, but it just keeps getting better and better!!!Thanks Aly for recommending this series :)))My Zarek:
I‚Äôve really enjoyed these books because they are filled with a ton of great characters and packed with fast-paced action.In this book, we meet Zarek who is a soulless Dark Hunter responsible for protecting mankind from the Daimons that want to destroy humans.
There were great secondary characters that played pretty big roles in this book and I hope to read more about Sasha, Simi, the Fates, Jess and of course Acheron who is suddenly become one of my favorite in this series.As with Kenyon‚Äôs other characters, she sure likes to put them through torturous times.
And in fact, a lot of the flashback scenes are a bit hard to read.
But that only made me love this character more by seeing the reasons he ended up being so damaged...so cold.
Kenyon frustrated me with a couple of the encounters that the two of them ended up having, but it still adds up to one of the most satisfying, heart-wrenching, and beautiful stories I have ever read.Kenyon's dialogue here, shines.
Some of the things that Zarek says to Astrid were heartbreakingly beautiful and romantic.
In my opinion this is SK's best work, and Zarek is a character that I will never forget.*read more reviews at my blog*http://ravingbookaddict.blogspot.com/
