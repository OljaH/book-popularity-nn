In this case, none of us really had a chance.Also, Mac's a big whimpy coward who should have told Barrons right from the getgo that she loved him.My other problem with this entire series is the nature of women and men portrayed.
YET, he knows that Mac's search for her sister's killer is the one thing she's after and he is all too happy to keep information about that to himself.Fiona gains some power by eating unseelie flesh in these novels yet she is ultimately a doormat to her petty emotions for Barrons.
I read this book back in early March. March. And I left one of those little notes saying that I was going to compile my thoughts and would be back soon to write a review. Well, um, it seems it took me a bit longer than I thought possible to get over everything I experienced with this series. Truth be told, I'm still reeling from it.Unlike a good few other readers, I didn't nab each book as it came out and it wasn't until around the time that Shadowfever was being released that I actually picked
I read this book back in early March.
The last time I became so addicted to a story and its characters was back when I was watching Buffy.This is a book and a series that I feel very strongly about and, because of that, I want to say what needs to be said to get everyone to read it.
Anyway, I happen to think Barrons is one of the sexiest characters in any book I've ever read.
it has everything.This series is one of my all time favourites.
Shadowfever is not one of those series finales that you want to forget ever reading.
It takes talent to write an ending that is so satisfying and with the outcome we all wanted, and make it so exciting and unpredictable until the very last page.Shadowfever is not a flawless book.
It gave me painful flashbacks of being in Katniss' head in Mockingjay (I love that book by the way).
Goodness, I feel hot flashes just thinking about him!I look forward to reading Fever books again and again in all their sexy, violent, intriguing glory.
And there are more Fever universe books on the way.
Basically, every single one of these books makes me want to break into song and dance!
Hell, I'm ruined for every other book EVER.
I know that once again I'm being melodramatic but KMM basically turned us into Pavlov's dogs, training us to drool every time Barrons acted animalistic.
Hell no.The way I see it is: it's about the journey not the destination.Much the way I felt at the end of Lost -What the faaaaaa?What the batman was the smoke monster?
Hell if she knows!Sure, I was disappointed that I didn't get the exact answers that I wanted.
I cannot believe it’s over.
I am still stunned by all the information we were given, all the revelations...It is so much to process.Yet, I revel in every thought and feeling that assaults my body, and trust me, there are many.
Absolutely Astonishing!
Breathtaking.Mind bending.Heart-wrenching.I was right.
I want more.
My chest hurts, my brain spins, and all I want to do is hug this book and dive right back in.
The theories and questions running rampant in my mind are going to drive me insane.
However, I just know this book will be amazing...I can feel it in my bones!
Shadowfever did NOT need to be the length that it was, that it was stretched out entirely too long with unnecessary emo verse and Mac Version 200 Questions made me want to stab someone.Here are just 2 of endless examples in which a paragraph of questions are used to tell the story:“What would happen when we finally had the Book under lock and key?
All I can think is: His head is gone and I don’t know how to merge with the Book.
Well after that marathon reading session I am exhausted.Started the first book about a week ago and could not stop. It was intriguing. I loved it and I usually do not read fantasy, paranormal, call it what you will. ”Bloody hell, Ms Lane, you drive me bloody fucking crazy.” I THOUGHT I’D LOST EVERYTHING.HOW IGNORANT I WAS.HE WARNED ME.I HAD SO MUCH MORE TO LOSE.I WANT TO DIE.This review will be mostly visual “Some people bring out the worst in you, others bring out the best, and then there are t
I loved it and I usually do not read fantasy, paranormal, call it what you will.
“The moment I laid eyes on you, I knew you were trouble.""Ditto.""I wanted to drag you between the shelves, fuck you senseless, and send you home.""If you'd done that, I never would have left.""You're still here anyway.""You don't have to sound so sour about it.""You're upsetting my entire existence.""Fine, I'll leave.""Try and I'll chain you up.”
I LOVED Jericho Barrons, yes Irene, you were right.I LOVED Barrons and Mac together eventhough I felt they were not together enoughMACSeelies/Unseelies/FaesIf you are looking for a book with hot, erotic sex scenes ….
I’ve fucking done it. I’ve re-read this series and reviewed all of them in some semblance of a calm and rational manner. But this fucking book…Where do I go from here? What do I read?! What is this world we live in? It fucking SUCKS compared to the one I just left! I haven’t seen my friends or family in a fucking WEEK. But you know what?Because I want more. Jericho Barrons. Jericho. Barrons.JERICHO. BARRONS.*flails*Oh, Mac’s okay too…I guess. Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Pinterest
I'd been going about my daily business here on GoodReads (by which I mean I was stalking everyone I know), when up pops an update relating to something called a...
I ignored it.But then up pops another.
This went on for about 90 minutes.My curiosity got the better of me: WHAT is a Barrons and WHY is everyone talking about it?
Let me be the one to tell you:THEYWERENOTKIDDINGI have done nothing, NOTHING at all for the past four days except drink coffee, pee when necessary, and swoon over Jericho Barrons.
Och) and the heroines who think they’re lacking in redeeming qualities, but are adored and thought to be perfect by these lusty gimme an Och burly heroes that any women would tear off their kilts to get a taste of what they don’t wear underneath them.When I heard Karen was going to start a new series that wasn’t a romance, but more along the lines of a paranormal mystery about a young woman who goes in search of her sister’s killer, I wasn’t interested in reading.
Oh my god.I just can't do this right now the first four were so good but this installment is drowning me in angst. I'm drowning, literally. There's no reason for Mac to be acting this damn sad & I despise reading from Dani's perspective...Maybe later... but also maybe not since I've heard awful things about the later books in this series. :(
★★★★★ 5+ EPIC, ONE OF A KIND, MIND-BLOWING STARS. "Evil is bad that believes it's good." Exciting, exhilirating, intense, powerful, highly unique, nerve-wracking, unputdownable, emotional and unforgettable.This series is an absolute must read!  "The good guys and bad guys aren't as easy to tell apart as I used to think they were. You can't look at someone with your eyes and take their measure. You have to look with the heart."  In this final installment of the intoxicating and mind-boggling Feve
Good and evil are even more difficult to tell part this time around.
Mac discovers that nothing is as it seems and that she has to rely on no one but herself to overcome the ultimate evil, hiding in the deepest and darkest shadows of Dublin.
But the battle must go on and together with allies she's determined to make the world a better place once again.Mac Lane is by far one of the strongest, most heroic female leads I've ever come across.
I loved all the fantastic characters, but of course Mac and Barrons were my favorite ones.

Nobody!That is so stupid, I don't even have words for it...FAIL!Still, this was an awesome ending to the original Fever series, and I'd recommend these to anyone who loves a good urban fantasy.Besides, you know this had to be good if even Dani can't kill my love for it!Original (long-winded and spoilery) 5 star review: 2011(view spoiler)[I read this a couple of days ago, but I was mentally waffling on the rating, so I decided to let my review ride until I could decide.
(hide spoiler)]In her desperation she becomes Darroc's ally and someone gets really pissed with her actions.Mac in this book learned the truth about her past and she was proved to be very strong and like always she was such a badass.J. BarronsSexy beastJust in case you dont know him Barrons is not the guy who will bring you chocolates and flowers on the Valentine's day.Enough with the eyecandy.Well in this book we finally learn what he is.Personally I didnt expect him to be what he was .I had other theories but I loved this explanation a lot.
You have to look with the heart.A book consuming your soul, whispering seductive secrets in your ears.
Yes, it could be the sought after Sinsar Dubh or it could easily be this bloody fantastic series...Mac, the girl that went through hell and emerged a fighter.Jericho, the man that cared too much to admit all his secrets.
A whole specter of emotions for a story that changed they way I will read paranormal books.
But that's the story with the best books; you don't want them to end, but they do and you lose a friend.
Check.-PLOT HOLES.
Check.-Plot devices.
Check.-No resolution to certain important things EVEN THOUGH THIS IS THE LAST BOOK IN THE SERIES.
It needs to be said: SO MUCH OF THIS BOOK COULD HAVE BEEN DELETED (*cough* the majority of the first half of this book as it has nothing to do with the last half of this book) -Three Words: deus ex machina(s).
Check.-Disturbing prelude to sex.
(Dear Moning, you did your best trying to sell your Highlander series, but guess what?
I'm still not going to read your Highlander series.
By the way, really disappointed that you turned THIS series into a trashy romance.)
That starts to feel like the author is just using certain tactics to play with reader emotions.
But it begins to feel like the author is being stingy about him for most of this book.
For book 5, it just felt like we were still getting too much angst and drama in their relationship.
*Everything* is answered in this one, and I don't think I've ever read a book in a series that was so dense with vital information.
Hold on, I need a drink.(view spoiler)[ I am happy with how things end with Mac and Barrons.
It's a good thing I don't care about new year and don't believe in the "rest of the year will go how you start it" stuff or I would have gone cuntzilla on the author for shatting on my whole year.Last book has ended with a cruel cliffhanger and this one picks up from there.
We wade trough pages after pages of Mac's inner monologue and "special moments" from the first 4 book.
Then finally came the moment I've been waiting for 4 fucking long books!
As if that wasn't enough we got to hear Dani's emo teenager inner monologue.Mac found out an information about herself so we had to hear it in circles.

I've just found THE BEST FREAKING UF SERIES I'VE EVER READ and for that I'll always worship KMM.
I won't lose the respect I've earn among GR's friends just saying that Barrons' body (view spoiler)[and #literalmagicpenis (hide spoiler)] is the reason for 5 stars.
She warms his frost. He cools her fever. That’s me every time I read the Fever series. Every. Fucking. Time.Since I got used to giving you a song for each book, I guess I can do another one for Shadowfever as well. What comes in my mind that is perfect for describing Shadowfever is Porcupine Tree’s  Sleep Together . I think my reasons are obvious. To the absolute joy of the female gender, Mac and Barrons couldn’t keep their hands off one another in this book. Get a room you guys!The first time
That’s me every time I read the Fever series.
Time.Since I got used to giving you a song for each book, I guess I can do another one for Shadowfever as well.
Get a room you guys!The first time I’ve read Shadowfever, I thought it was the end of the series.
When I was reading Shadowfever for the second time, I couldn’t remember much.
Now that the future two Fever books are set in stone, I’m not so bothered by the ending anymore.
At least I’m hoping that my questions will be answered.
Originally read from January 19 - 22, 2011*FAVORITE BOOK OF 2011* "She warms his frost. He cools her fever." I've been asked many times what my favorite book is, but I don't think I've ever answered that question adequately enough. After reading this book, though, I think I finally have my answer: Shadowfever is the best book I've ever read. The book starts off exactly where the previous one left off, with Mac stunned after killing the beast. The first 5 or so chapters are heart-wrenching to rea
The book starts off exactly where the previous one left off, with Mac stunned after killing the beast.
Dying for someone isn’t the hard thing.
I think in the ten-or-so plot twists in this book, I only foresaw about one.
Which is HUGE and half the reason I love this series so much.The ending left me speechless, ecstatic, and about a million types of happy.
For all of you who have read the previous books in the series and can't imagine a HEA ending whatsoever: it's true what Mac said in the beginning, she does hold a lot of joy by the end.
"You’re Mac, he says. “And I’m Jericho.” How did fans live so long with book 4 ending like it did and then the wait for this book? The prior book had a brutal cliffhanger but Karen Marie Moning more than made up for that heart stopping ending with this book. The Sinsar Dubh, everyone wants this damn book! Mac can feel it and can hunt it and so she is very useful to every being who yearns for it. Whether they want to use it for themselves or place it back under lock and key Mac is the girl ever
How did fans live so long with book 4 ending like it did and then the wait for this book?
Whether they want to use it for themselves or place it back under lock and key Mac is the girl everyone needs.
Mac finds out all of Barrons secrets and it is about damn time!
Mac and Barrons finally come clean.
Barrons was wonderful in this book he shows all he is and in turn they finally are at the stage where readers had wanted them to be since the first book.
”He lives.I breathe.I want.
Ice to my fever.”
How fucking awesome. And Jericho Fucking Barrons. I get it now. Totally mindblown.This is me right now.
Was I satisfied with the book?For all of those who know me and have been following my reviews, you know this series is my top fav and an absolute obsession!
What I adored the most about this series was the way the books were written, KMM has such an amazing and unique style and you just can't help to love it.
Now that I am finally done with the series I can say it is still my top fav and I adored every page in every book.
I hate when series go on and on and you know they should have finished so many books ago.
I’m so thrilled I picked up The Fever series and I’m really sad that this is the last book for Jericho and Mac. Well, at least for several years.
I had been listening to Dreamfever (book 4) on the way to work and finished.
I loved feisty and self-confident Mac, and with each book we make new discoveries about her identity and her powers.
I was happy with the way things ended and tied up, but apparently after three books revolving around Dani, we get more with Mac and Barrons.
Jericho Barrons just told me he loves me.”
I have an urge to shout "You're killin' me Smalls!!" I also love anyone who understands that reference.
I wish I had known before hand what kind of crazy a** ending Dreamfever was going to have and then I would have waited to read it--scratch that, I should have waited for the whole series.
On the other hand, it is rather interesting to develop my own alternate endings for the series.
Also, I'm tempted to read KMM's Highlander series but to be honest, they sound kind of ....
So if anyone who loved the Faefever series likes them, let me know and I'll work on getting over my prejudice.
A thrilling, huge, conclusion to this series. So many questions were finally answered from the beginning of the series that I loved discovering everything as things were slowly making sense and the twists were amazing, and I'm so happy I read this series this month. It was exactly what I wanted to read when I didn't know what to read.
So at least now Mac will be content about everything she has succeeded so far, there will be a new start in her relationship with Barrons and she will defeat the bad guys and avenge her sister.Wrong!Firstly, Shadowfever starts with Mac feeling greatly guilty about what she thinks she has done.
Other times you feel that you are back at book 1 and they are tiptoeing around each other.Thirdly, what bad guys?
And the most evil/devious character has a “Not Happy For Now” ending.I haven’t read book 9 “Feversong” yet, but I have a strange feeling that he will be back.Advice: Keep you schedule clear when you start the book!
