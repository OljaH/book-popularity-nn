The Purple Prince of OZ happens to be a purple elephant who has been promoted to prince of the land so he is with the royal family always.
The book starts when Kabumpo saves a young boy from dipping-the worst punishment in the land.
But then one night an "entertainer" arrives to display his skills for the royal family.
Only Kabumpo, Randy, and the Kings brother stay.
The King's brother takes control of the kingdom and Kabumpo and Randy must start off to find the royal family.
I rate this book 4 out of 5 stars.
One of my favorite of the non-Buam Oz books, as an exiled boy king, his faithful elephant , a wizard in a jar and a rather large wind up toy soldier struggle to regain his throne from the evil types that have overthrown him.Lots of fun fantasy moments.
Book 26
Nowhere close to the charm, magic, and inventiveness of the originals. These books should not be considered Oz canon.
