The movie is also an almost line by line rendition of the scenes in the book, which is not surprising, given that the author worked on the script.So, what it's all about and why do you need to give an answer to the opening question : "Have you got Soul?"It's about the power of music to cross geographical borders, language barriers and generational gaps and to give meaning and direction to your life.
, and among other things it shows that Doyle can write complex, nuanced characters.) In fact, for half the book I had to keep going back to the page that listed the band members’ names and what instrument they played:Jimmy Rabbite; manager.Outspan Foster; guitar.Deco Cuffe; vocals.Derek Scully; bass.
And here’s what happens: they rehearse; Jimmy books them first one gig then another; they perform them both; another character (Mickah the bouncer) joins them; they get a nice write-up in a local paper; one player gets interested in jazz; the vocalist (whom everyone hates) gets a big ego; and all the men are attracted to Imelda, one of the backup singers.So: not much plot.
Young Jimmy Rabbitte, unemployed resident of a fictional working class neighborhood of Dublin, Barrytown, gets the brilliant idea that Ireland needs sex machine music like James Brown’s.
Here is the pitch of self-recruitment by a middle-aged horn player, “Joey the Lips”, who is the only one who has had professional experience playing soul music: --The Lord told me to come home.
… Ed told me to back to Ireland and blow some soul into the Irish Brothers.
Nevertheless, we moved forward with our dream and started penning lyrics to songs with no music…our muses were more than confused.
So, on one foggy day (I can’t really be expected to remember if it was foggy, can I?) we went to all the girls in our neighborhood that were about our age, never younger only older, and asked if they would like to tryout for our band as dancers.
Our band broke up after that…I have always loved that memory, and since my wife was one of the girls it makes it all that more meaningful.
This novel's entire focus is on music, and how it can enrich one's soul and move you, emotionally, the way no other can.Despite not knowing every one of the band and artist's names that litter this piece, I did enjoy the message it was promoting and thought Doyle did a wonderful job of allowing his characters' passion for music to translate across the page.
This is Doyle's forte, and his characters are what made for such an enjoyable and hilarious reading experience.Whilst all these things accumulated to make this a joyful little piece, I finished it with none of the overarching understandings or intense emotions that his other work had given me.
I went into this book knowing nothing about it, not having seen the movie, certainly not having seen the musical and not being familiar with the Irish institution that is Roddy Doyle.Initially I thought there was a mistake and I somehow obtained the screenplay for the film rather than the novel.
It’s all there in a story of a few Dublin teenagers who form a band and try to bring some soul into the Irish capital.
However, I think this is one of the few instances where I think ‘the movie is better.’ And that is without actually having seen the movie.*Knowledge of 60’s r’n’b and soul music desirable but not essential for the enjoyment of this book.
In the grim north side of Dublin Jimmy decides to put together a band to play soul music from the 60s.
Ain't it?
And we're just scummy white kids, ain't we?
But Jimmy has a reply to that :Do you not get it, lads?
And Dubliners are the blacks of Ireland.
So say it once, say it loud: I'm black and I'm proud.
Dean, Jimmy's mate, a little uncertainly:  I'm black....
and I'm proud.Amongst many issues covered in The Commitments is how to cope with a lead singer who has a fabulous voice but who is a belligerent egomaniac with vile manners.
Se vogliamo portare il soul a Dublino,non possiamo metterci a fumare l'haschish.-Ma è solo haschish.-Ma cazzo,Billy, è la punta dell'iceberg.
Dublino è fottuta,è piena di droga.E la droga non è soul.-E quelli che bevono,allora?-È diverso,disse Jimmy-Bere va bene.
La classe lavoratrice se li è sempre fatti un paio di bicchieri.-La Guinnes è cibo soul, disse Joey the Lips,-cibo per l'anima (in questo passaggio c'è la parola più ricorrente del romanzo di R.Doyle ,almeno un centinaio :Dno,non è Billy )
brilliant! though you end up thinking in an irish accent
Fortunately for Outspan and Derek, who've decided to form And, And!, And, a syntho-pop cover band (as soon as they get the money to buy instruments, anyway), Jimmy Rabbite consents to be their manager.
Brother Joey, who's played with everyone from James Brown to the Beatles, takes over the band's musical training to great success, and is soon sampling the nonmusical talents of the Commitmentettes, much to the disgust of his frustrated younger colleagues.
We leave Jimmy, Outspan, and Derek as they realize that what Dublin really needs is a country-western band.

If the movie is at all true to the book, I know I'm going to love it.Set in working-class North Dublin, the novel begins with teens Outspan, Derek and Ray, who have formed a new band called And And And. Only in existence for three days, Outspan and Derek decide they need help with the band's direction and go to music-manager guru Jimmy Rabbitte, who"ate melody Maker and the NME every week and Hot Press every two weeks." Jimmy "knew his music...knew his stuff alright." After convincing the two that they really should be doing "Soul.
In the late 80's, Dubliners were still underemployed, and things were cheaper.
I have always loved this story of a Dublin soul band.
I'd forgotten how short-lived this group was.
Ireland and Dublin have changed dramatically in 25 years.
Ireland boomed and became a nation of new immigrants from Eastern Europe, Latin America and Africa.
I wonder what young people who never knew the "old Dublin" would make of this story of a group who describes "Irish as the n----rs of Europe and Dubliners as the n-----s of Ireland and northside Dubliners as the n-----s of Dublin".
Goodness me what a great book!
I'm not sure why it's taken me this long to read 'The Commitments' (I haven't seen the film either), but I purchased the book and decided to read it having heard many good reports about its recently released sequel, 'The Guts'.
I went off Roddy Doyle after reading 'Oh, Play That Thing', but he's won me back with this, his debut, and I now look forward to reading the next instalment, which I intent to buy on audiobook next month!

Of dreams and dreamers. Light-hearted, funny, charming. I'd even give it 4.5 compared to the other books I'm reading/have recently read. Read in 5h.

Jimmie gets things going immediately by dropping the name (especially that !) and the keyboard player.Instead, they're going to play American soul music -- and then put an Irish twist on it -- local slang, geographic references, and so on.
Just like the rag-tag musicians that come to life in its pages.
The band is nannied by a balding middle-aged man who, according to himself, has performed with James Brown, Stevie Wonder, Isaac Hayes and the likes, but now lives in suburban Dublin and wants to form part of this motley soul band.
—Soul is a double-edged sword, lads, he told them once.Joey The Lips nodded.—One edge is escapism.—What’s tha’?—Fun.
Tell us about the other side of the sword, Jimmy.They were quiet.The first side is sex, righ’, said Jimmy.
——Soul is the rhythm o’ sex.
It’s the rhythm o’ the factory too.
A quick little read; heavy on dialogue.
Irish dialogue.
I loved the movie and wanted to read the book before I watched it again.
I really liked the antics of Jimmy and the gang as they progressed from a group of wannabe musicians to small time fame in central Dublin.
There's a great group dynamic going on behind the story; everyone's in love with the backup singers, everyone hates the lead singer, Joey The Lips Fagan keeps everyone on an even keel, and Jimmy tries to keep everyone focused long enough to get a few gigs in.
Lot of humor, and a great sense of place.
The Commitments is a small band formed in Dublin by a group of young and unemployed folks.
Their one goal in life is to bring SOUL to Dublin.
The biggest problem is the leading members really don't know that much about music history, so they hire a friend to manage them and help create the image they have for themselves.There isn't a lot of story here.
Quite simply it is about music, but deeper than that is the will to be more, to bring more to the table.
Maybe I'm just not garage-band-y enough.
The cockney accent dialogue of working class Dublin is humorous once you figure it out. Do yourself a favor and view the 1991 classic film, The Commitments. Then download the CD from iTunes and sit back and enjoy the people’s sound.
Greatness is often ephemeral. Youth is fickle. It's such a brilliant story. I just love it...
This is a gem. A book that is dialogue driven with the a few songs thrown in. Jimmy wants to start a Soul Band in Barrytown but having no talent doesn't put him or the other band members off. Their just do it attitude comes across and no obstacle gets in the way. Off course they have their disagreements and all of the boys fancy Natalie. A non too serious look at Irish life which I enjoyed more than the film
A group of young Dubliners form a band to bring "Soul to the Irish Brothers and Sisters".
They are an odd assortment led by Jimmy Rabbitt: the manager and driving force of the group.
Finally they find their sound and start to play a few gigs, build a following, and then.....The style of writing and the Irish banter had me laughing from first page to last.
I have to admit it took a page or two to get my head round Dublin slang, but other than that, a great quick read.
A quick, amusing, but ultimately lightweight read. I wanted to love this one more - it's just that even though it was funny, sometimes spurt-out-loud funny, I just didn't feel there was enough substance here for a full story. But this isn't really one of those books to be fair - it feels like it's more about the color and setting, and that would resonate with me more if I was born and raised in Dublin.
A lighthearted book about some Dublin guys and gals who form a band, The Commitments, that wants to bring Soul to Ireland. They rehearse, break up, rehearse some more, go on stage, are close to signing a record deal, and break up again, before regrouping as The Brassers. The book can easily be read in a few hours, and I'd recommend to listen to the songs they're playing as you're reading along.
Not really my sort of book but thoroughly enjoyable, witty and well drawn.
Very short book. Read in three hours. Very funny
I saw the stage play two weeks ago (Awesome!), and the film years ago, so it's really time to get to the book!
