Woven around the existing plot of Robinson Crusoe, Foe is written from the perspective of Susan Barton, a castaway who landed on the same island inhabited by "Cruso" and Friday as their adventures were already underway.
Like Robinson Crusoe, it is a frame story, unfolded as Barton's narrative while in England attempting to convince the writer Daniel Foe to help transform her tale into popular fiction.
In England with Friday, Barton attempts to set her adventures on the island to paper, but she feels her efforts lack popular appeal.
"We must make Friday's silence speak, as well as the silence surrounding Friday." Daniel Defoe /Daniel Foe's novel Robinson Crusoe was Coetzee's childhood favorite novel. At first, he had thought it was a memoir of the title character. In fact, Foe published the book as an account of a real castaway. The realization that the character was fictional, this intermixing of real and fictional, had a huge impact on him. Besides this novel, Coetzee also visited the Robinson Crusoe in the short story h
The Crusoe as Coetzee presented him is not adventurous, not at all persistent in his effort to escape, doesn't try to start a civilisation, had no offers from cannibals for him to refuse and thus prove his nationalism, didn't rescue Friday, rather bought him, was pretty happy in living on an island and doesn't make half as good a story.However, the book is far more than a retelling - we have only talked one-third of the book.
In Coetzee's alternative version, it is Susan who brought Crusoe's story to Foe (who is present as a character), for him to write.
It purports to be the perspective of Susan Barton, incidentally a character from a subsequent Daniel Defoe novel ("Roxana"), who in "Foe" ends up on the island with Cruso (sic) and Friday (whose tongue has been cut out by slavers).The second is largely epistolary, being the letters written by Susan Barton to Foe, trying to get him to write her story for publication.
People extraneous, people absent... Coetzee is complicated & this short novella is one of his best... except for the ingloriously vapid ending. Hated it! But all the questions posed by J.M. Coetzee, mainly about fiction vs. Biography, & existential conundrums that arise, create a maudlin cloud... the pathos the reader deserves & craves.
She lands on an island where Cruso and Friday had been cast away years ago.
Susan wants to write their story so she contacts the author Daniel Foe to turn her narration into a book.
The theme seems to be that the oppressed and disadvantaged have been silenced, and lost the authorship of their own stories.J.M. Coetzee was writing in 1986 in South Africa where communication problems and cultural differences existed between the black Africans and white colonialists.
Coetzee has updated the tale by adding a woman narrator, an African servant, and a 20th Century outlook.
That said, I believe Coetzee is more interested in our assumption that Friday is without a speech organ, tongue-less.
Recall that the only evidence of this tonguelessness comes from the travel narrative that Crusoe gives where he imagines Friday's suffering at the hands of slave-traders and other "savages", as well, in each instance of Susan's quest to see the "stub", the remains, she turns away from what she imagines will be too physical and too evocative fleshy remnants.
Friday is tongueless because we agree to the imagining protocol that names him as such?
It is almost ridiculous to praise his style, as the way he formulates the questions and ideas of his writing is so perfectly self-contained and self-explanatory.
A light is cast upon them in his writing by most naturally granting them the position of visible characters - no slick tricks, no handy word games.
One of the most humbling of Coetzee's gifts.I will keep coming back to this book, just like I do with all of Coetzee's books, in hope to prevent myself from forgetting their questions and at the same time to grant myself relief though his unparalleled art of conveying them.
There's a woman and she is on a desert island for a while and then she's rescued and she's bogged down with Man Friday and Daniel Defoe's in it writing her story and I thought I got it.
But I couldn't help feeling now and again like:and trying to figure it all out made things worse.Frankly, in the end, I felt like I was in the middle of xkcd's google map directions (goodreads has made a hash of this, please go link: here to see it: I don't know, Mr Coetzee.
I really don't know.
It is difficult to describe. The quality of the writing is great, the characters are good and sometimes the book grips you.There are even moments that reminded me of Animal Man by Grant Morrison, but when I finished the book it was.. And???It could be a **, it could be a ****... Let's rate it with a ***.Finally, I have to say that the character of Susan Barton is probably one of the most powerful female characters that I have met.
Foe reminds me more of Robert Coover's multilayered, metafictional Spanking the Maid than of Robinson Crusoe.
So this is metafiction, and here's another mystery: why didn't Barton herself make it into Foe's novel?
And it's true, actually, although not in the way Coetzee presents it: Defoe was inspired by the story of castaway Alexander Selkirk.)Coetzee is South African, and he wrote Foe in the 80s, at the height of the controversy over a soon-to-die apartheid.
When he presents Friday as mysteriously mute - the only character unable to tell his own story - he's talking about his country.
Beautifully written. I have no idea what the hell happened in this book, though.
Give me an hour, more wine and I'll probably fill in the blanks with some kind of skewed version of Coetzee's sequel/ parallel to Daniel Defoe's Robinson Crusoe (recently read and reviewed), but I'll try to finish writing before it gets to that sloppy point.In lieu of being able to offer any new startling observations on this text I have just read two excellent reviews:Chris Holmes' http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/...and Brian's review http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/...both which are worth reading with or without the wine.
J.M. Coetzee's 1986 novel FOE is a retelling of ROBINSON CRUSOE that uses Daniel Defoe's well-known story as a basis for a bitter commentary on colonialism.
To really get anything out of Coetzee's novel, you'll need to read ROBINSON CRUSOE first.
When the trio is finally rescued, Cruso soon dies, but Barton and Friday return to England.
There Barton encounters Mr. Foe and narrates her story to him, only to find that he is not interested in the remarkable truth of her experiences, but instead bends the story to his own preconceptions.Coetzee's main message seems to be that Europeans have robbed colonized peoples of their own history.

is Mr. Foe the narrator "I" in the last section?Coetzee deliberately blurred the line that separates "fictional reality" and "fictional fictionality." According to some scholars, he was writing Foe as a "metafiction" that very self-consciously draws readers attention to the writing itself and the relation between writers and readers.
In Foe, the writer Mr. Foe kept changing Susan's stories, supplanting with details that didn't take place, or deleting moments which Susan thought was crucial but were dull to him."Friday has no command of words and therefore no defence against being re-shaped day by day in conformity with the desires of others.
The long first section of the book, in which Susan Barton washes ashore on Cruso's island, is a tour-de-force, one of the best sustained pieces of writing Coetzee's ever done.
Meanwhile, the author's refusal to resolve intriguing questions he's set up--such as the true identity of a girl who claims to be Susan's long-lost daughter--strikes me as needlessly tight-assed.
I bought this book at a recent $5 A Bag book sale at the library.
Having walked away with 4 bags of books, it seemed like a pretty successful sale in and of itself.
However, fate intervenes (dun dun DUN) and, picking it up to read tonight, I see a very familiar name scrawled in the front cover, a date/locale, and a seal imprinted on the title page.
None other than the name of my favorite teacher back in high school and the date of my graduation.
A favorite teacher that has since passed away but is sorely missed.
This review will overflow with cliché.
Such is the sum of my experience.
Fox is a meditation on silence.
Coetzee explores the natural aspects of such.
The sea and wilderness yield no ready wisdom.
Such doesn’t communicate in our jejune terms.There is also an algebra of silence by design.
It is a poetry of omissions.
It is the fruit of doubt and a coveted rank of humility.
The narrative currents of our lives are larded with the silence, we adorn them with caprice and detail.
Coetzee intervenes into what understand as a novelistic tradition, a landmark to judge our way.
Μια κυριολεκτική διαστρέβλωση του τίτλου από τον εκδότη και μια μεταφορική διαστρέβλωση του μύθου από τον συγγραφέα! Γίνονται και θαύματα.https://pepperlines.blogspot.com/2018...Υ.Γ. 4.5 *
tem, à semelhaça de outros livros de Coetzee que li, coisas francamente boas e outras fora de propósito, dispensáveis, mal acabadas. a escrita do autor é muito boa e, no fundo, aquilo que me faz insistir na sua leitura.
Coetzee's sometimes strained exercise here is to write together the narratives of Daniel Defoe's two major novels, Pamela and Robinson Crusoe.
Once again, the central undertaking is Coetzee's straining to hear the voice of the subaltern through his characters and once again concluding with the best-solution-possible as some complicated ritual of bodily compassion and performative abjection.
After my third Coetzee novel in less than as many months, the anguished to-and-froing about who owns whom, and who speaks/writes/acts whom and whether or not this is the very tension/question that we are forced to forever grapple with (it is, it seems) is starting to feel like the repetitive tongue-and-groove chafing of a masochist's wrist ties.
I assume this book would be studied in High Schools or Unis.
This book has these and more.Susan Barton is castaway on a remote island and finds herself with Friday and Cruso.
They are rescued, Cruso dies and Barton tries to get the author Daniel Foe to wrote her (or Cruso's stories).Told in four parts as a story, then as a series of letters, then a more standard narrative and lastly in a short dream-like sequence.The book covers the silence of the underclass (Cruso has no tongue), the power of the privileged, the fiction of writing fiction and what is reality.
Even more misterious and deep than the first two times I read it.
In spite of the slow reading, the following of the clues, the theories built over its passages, themes, characters, I still don't know what is really happening there.
What is this ship?
(Costello?) asks the dead body of Viernes.
Perhaps it doesn't matter.
What matters here is that this is a truly infinite book, an immortal one.
One can read it over and over again and it will never lose a bit of interest, beauty, misteriousness and a dark, serious charm.
It is a piece like no other.
This is a parallel novel to Daniel Defoe's Robinson Crusoe.
Yet the parallel lines are drawn free handed and with much liberty.
Coetzee steps boldly in the story - unafraid that we might see him.
He dares us to see him.
Dares us to question his tale.
He'll tell us the story he wants us to hear.
Yeah, so there is a "real" story.
There's got to be more to it.
You know there is something that Susan is not sharing.
And Friday ain't telling us anything.
Robinson Crusoe is dead - so what choice does he have?
Easily one of the worst books I have ever read. Simplistic, pseudo-intellectual mental masturbation. Awful.

Like his acclaimed signatures, Coetzee's Foe delivers multiple dimensions, complexities (with A LOT of questions afterwards) and lyrical prose.
All I can say from the first read is that the book challenges the new idea of writing, and authorship and the clashes between the "authorship" as the sense of colonialism.
Their voices in the book are somehow disturbing and questionable.
Many online sources say that Susan Barton is the voice of truth seeker, and the feminism recalled in the lost world of fragmented post-colonialism, but I find it hard to believe.
"You should read Defoe's Robinson Crusoe before reading Coetzee's Foe"-said anyone with the least of literary sensitivity and there is me who totally went full throttle on this book.The narrative perspective here is as slippery as a mouldy bar of soap.During the last chapter, I was basically yelling:" Who is talking, here?? Foe, Susan,Heck, is it Friday?!!" Now, I understand why it is considered as a pillar in the metafictional genre.Way to fill my soul with doubt, Coetzee.Now, I will be questioning every narrator and doubting every POV because your scope of perception was all over the place.
I enjoyed the first part of this book (set on the deserted island) much more than the rest of it (set in England), but I think I’m just in a kind of nature-mood at the moment. Overall I was underwhelmed. The metafiction was too much for me. However, I was very interested in Friday as a character, and the ideas about silence and power.
