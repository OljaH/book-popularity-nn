Good general overview of Bible periods and could be a decent workgroup book for small group Bible study. No new ground is really broken, but it is organized well and does give some good discussion questions for contemplation of the Holy Bible.
So powerful Bible study tool that can be read over and over while studying the Bible
so far i am 35% through the Period by Period Bible, it has helped me to understand so much that i did not understand. After I am completed reading this i am going to do the workbook, then I will be ready to read the KJV and hopefully have no difficulty in understanding.
Proof reader neededGood information but so many misspelled words and grammatical errors. Tiffanycrider@live.com would be a good proof reader. Sincerely,Debra McRee.
