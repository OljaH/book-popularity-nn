Written in 1919, yet as relevant today. Veblen one of best economic thinkers of 19 century in his clear and easy to understand language (even for an economic layman) explains the system which keeps the whole world in calcified inefficiency and waste.To sum it up in his own words: "Politics and investment are still allowed to decide matters of industrial policy which should plainly be left to the discretion of the general staff of production engineers driven by no commercial bias." Amen to that!
Strangely prescient early 20th century heterodox economics treatise on the engineers (aka skilled craftsmen) and the disruptions they could cause in perfect economic models since they are "workers' but are actually more akin to the entrepreneurs, and how they really will own the world and control the company. Witness: internet companies and developers. Me likey. Has a quick section on advertising economics if you happen to be writing a book on advertising and economics. BECAUSE WE ALL ARE>
Thorstein Veblen is one of the most brilliant thinkers in the dissenting institutionalist tradition. Brilliant insight into the functioning of industrial society and the foundation of the modern business and labour worlds. A hypothesis with far reaching implications re: the history of progress (or lack thereof).
Interesting discussion on the uses of sabotage, but other than that... I have no idea how this book has any relevance, or is part of any serious discussion on economics. The book focuses solely on price, while ignoring any discussion of the more relevant topics of cost, supply, demand, and especially profit. After an interesting review of management divisions, the author then supposes that the technical team can develop a more efficient system, without any method of determining demand.
Amazing book on technocracy
