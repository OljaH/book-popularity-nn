I was pleasantly surprised.Lira is a siren princess, daughter of the Sea Queen, and known amongst humans as Princes' Bane - because of all the princes whose hearts she has ripped from their chests.
Floating out on the sea with her new pair of legs, Lira is picked up by Prince Elian's ship.Elian is a siren killer and adventurer.
It's very different, and this "mermaid" definitely doesn't want to be human and bag a prince - unless by that you mean killing him.
There's lots I like here: anti-heroines, slow-burn romance, fairy tales that contain prophecies, fun banter and strong friendships.
Annnyyywayyy, Lira is unashamedly brutal and hunts with vicious intent.Elian is a prince whos pastime is piracy.
Anyway, after an event that royally pisses of the Sea Queen, she changes Lira into a human as punishment and orders her to go kill the siren-killer prince (but without her siren powers.) Elian finds Lira, who looks like an ordinary girl at this point, conveniently drowning in the ocean.
But instead of trying to kill him right off the bat, Lira has another idea - and decides to stick around for a while.That's all I'm going to say.Here's what you need to know:Elian is everything.
Just read it.Alexandra is a master of creative writing, character, and storytelling.

Lira, on the other hand, is the daughter of the Sea Queen, known as the Prince's Bane.
An unpredictable turn of events brings the Sea Queen's wrath upon Lira, and she ends up exiled, having two legs instead of a tail, and an order to rip the heart out of Elian's still warm body.
Lira begins her narration stating nonchalantly that she collects the hearts of princes, while Elian claims that he's a murderer, and that's not his worst trait.
The story of Elian and Lira was pure magic.
Hearts are at stake in To Kill a Kingdom, a mesmerizing, deeply enthralling story about power, freedom and love.
ARC provided by Macmillan in exchange for an honest review.  “I’ve made a mistake. It started with a prince, as most stories do. Once I felt the thrum of his heart beneath my fingers, I couldn’t forget it.”  You all, I buddy read this with FOUR of my closest book friends, and we all five starred this amazing story. Please, go treat yourself and preorder this book. Please. Do you like killer sirens? Angsty romance? A+ witty banter? Vivid fighting scenes with mind-blowing imagery? One of the best
But after Lira upsets her mother, the Sea Queen wants to find a new way to ridicule and humiliate her, so what better way than to force her to steal the most royal heart of all, but also forcing her to do this task as a human, and while no longer having her siren voice to lure humans towards her.And what kind of prince in waiting would Elian be if he let this damsel in distress drown in the water?
Also, my Odyssey loving heart will read any and all books about sirens luring men to their death.
I HAVE A HEART for every year I’ve been alive.There are seventeen hidden in the sand of my bedroom. Every so often, I claw through the shingle, just to check they’re still there. Buried deep and bloody. I count each of them, so I can be sure none were stolen in the night. It’s not such an odd fear to have. Hearts are power, and if there’s one thing my kind craves more than the ocean, it’s power. *insert drooling face here* I can't help it. I'm a wee bit bloodthirsty and I love these types of he
It’s been a long ass time since I reviewed a YA book because I got sick of all the crappy books, but this book caught my eyes (BECAUSE SIRENS) and holy crap, it’s good!This is kind of a Little Mermaid retelling but with sirens, and instead of the main character wanting to get forked (no pun intended), our main character sings and seduces and kills the hapless men that fall into her and her cousins' trap.
Even as I hear the familiar song that strikes my soul and makes me believe in love like it’s the first time.
A bewitchingly dark retelling of The Little Mermaid.In which both the siren princess and human prince want to cut each other’s throats if that’s the last thing they do.
My newfound love of dark fairytale retellings—caused by Lost Boy: The True Story of Captain Hook—propelled me to read this book.How could I ever go back to the innocent Disney tales I read as a child that would make me dream of a boundless future?
Especially since I found the original prince in The Little Mermaid rather one-dimensional, whereas Elian’s personality is attractive.
False advertisement that was because that’s not the tone the story carried on with (but I didn’t mind this too much since there was some introspection our characters were going through).
I’m slightly getting over happy endings, particularly in fantasy.
It felt and read like the story was being crammed in.
It didn’t flow, rather it felt too deliberate and purposely steered into a particular direction, i.e. getting the two main characters together.
I think this would’ve worked better and read more fulfilling had it been a duology possibly, where then the writing, the characters, the world and plot would’ve been given their due right.
Because then I open them in Barnes & Noble and am like “wow I should buy this” and then I do (except not immediately because I don’t have B&N levels of money honey) and then I’m disappointed and I hate it and it’s honestly bad for all of us.This law is for the good of the people, you know?https://emmareadstoomuch.wordpress.co...LISTEN TO THIS OPENING LINE YOU GUYS.
Nope, just bad writing!How do you pitch a violent siren/pirate high fantasy YA retelling of the Little Mermaid and somehow make it boring?
Plus it was super funny, and if there's something my dark little heart beats faster for: it's people who sass each other to death so lovingly.(Also, claim to fame 😂, I have been a beta-reader for Allie in the past, so I kneeeew I'd love this and ajfdksald her writing is a masterpiece.)+ The characters just stole the seawater ahhh I'm so happy!It's dual narrated by both Elian and Lira.
I also loved that Lira/Elian were sassing each other to death, but also the secondary characters were too!
3.7/5 Stars ⭐ ⭐ ⭐ ⭐“Technically, I’m a murderer, but I like to think that’s one of my better qualities.” This is a very hyped up book. You all know it. You all did it. Everyone is reading it and I just couldn't resist. Fantasy is not the genre I prefer but a book about mythology and sirens and pirates is right up my alley. I truly enjoyed this book, it was a very strong debut novel, but it contained its faults.Princess Lira is siren royalty and the most lethal of them all. With the hearts of sev
And just how many deals will Elian have to barter to eliminate mankind's greatest enemy?As I promised to some of you, I will rant about the use of my native language, Greek, in this book.
When I started reading this book and read the first Greek word, I was pretty fucking excited.
Here are some of the kingdoms with Greek names and their translations in English:Adekaros = PennilessDiavolos = HellArmonia = HarmonyPagos = IceKleftes = ThievesKalokairi = Summer (ΟΛΑ ΜΟΙΑΖΟΥΝ ΚΑΛΟΚΑΙΡΙ)Eidyllio = RomanceAgrios = RoughPolemistes = WarriorsKardia = HeartGlossa = Language (Αυτή είναι η φάση, δεν είναι αυτή η φάση.
And also I would like to say something about the other characters, except Elian and Lira.
Two kingdoms that come with responsibilities we each have trouble bearing. Him, the shackles of being pinned to one land and one life. Me, trapped in the confines of my mother’s murderous legacy. And the ocean, calling out to us both. A song of freedom and longing. I LOVE IT. Reading this book was an amazing experience, I absolutely flew through it. To me this book doesn’t feel like a standalone because I have grown to care for these characters impossibly fast, and I will miss them dearly. The
Elian is a prince, who hates the confines of his duties, and chooses to escape them by becoming a pirate and hunting sirens, with the people he trusts.Every time we are given a glimpse from Lira’s childhood, the torment she is put through because she is the heir to the Sea is truly grievous.
Without even knowing it, by protecting her cousin Lira was protecting not only a spark of innocence, but also the part of her that is human enough to choose love and kindness over the monster her mother wanted her to become.We see both of them run from the people they were forced to become because of the position they were born in, we see them resent the people they were raised to be and find them fighting their way out of the moulds society carved for them.
We got two POVs in this story: The first is from a siren princess that kills human princes.
Their paths cross and...you'll have to find out the rest for yourself ??This was one of my most anticipated reads of the year and I'm sooo glad it didn't disappoint.
However, Elian's decision at the end is kind of hard to process.
Maybe I'm just used to fantasy characters being overly complicated and I can't settle for simplicity.Best thing about this book?
I don't have much experience reading retellings but I definitely felt a Little Mermaid vibe from this.
it's what I never knew I wanted The Little Mermaid to become!Lira's a siren princess whose ruthless Sea Queen mother teaches her to steal power & the futures of kingdoms by taking the hearts of princes.
There are rumors and fairy tales of a crystal that he could use to rid the sirens of their power and kill the Sea Queen, so he takes his crew on a quest.This story was just straight up fun to read!
I loved how I could totally see the outline of The Little Mermaid and the various clever parts that pay tribute to that story, yet this was still its own totally unique plot.
well it is, but you know what, the more i think about it, the more i've realized that the ending was anticlimatic as fuck and Lira and Elian's relationship can choke on balls the size of my pEn!!!!i guess i really hyped this up and ended up giving it 4 stars in a rush because i was really enjoying it in the moment, but once the ending came and i actually used my brain to think about it, i was like hMmMmMmMmmmm NO THIS IS KIND OF A PIECE OF SHIT!!!!LET'S TALK ABOUT WHY IT'S ENJOYABLE!!!!first off, this has such an interesting plot.
“His face makes no difference.” I drop her hand. “It’s his heart I’m after.”“So many hearts.” Her voice is angelic. “You’ll soon run out of room to bury them all.”I lick my lips. “Maybe,” I say. “But a princess must have her prince.” This book is so unique and fun to read.SIRENS 🧜♀ and PIRATES, just how freaking awesome is that?!? I have an unhealthy obsession with sirens and pirates 🤪Lira and Elian are awesome, funny, sarcastic, intelligent and badass. I love the dynamic that they have and the
This book is so unique and fun to read.SIRENS 🧜‍♀️ and PIRATES, just how freaking awesome is that?!?
I have an unhealthy obsession with sirens and pirates 🤪Lira and Elian are awesome, funny, sarcastic, intelligent and badass.
The villain of the story was great and real and really after all a freaking villain to the core!!!
Which it may be hard to find in a standalone.
I was smiling so hard.
It was just an entertaining read!!
“I smile at that, because Elian of all people should know better.
He should know to have more faith in myth and fairy tale”
Can I afford to add another book to my ever growing to-be read pile?No!Am I going to add this awesome book that seems to feature not only a siren but also a handsome pirate prince?ABSO-FREAKING-LUTELY!!!! <333
is the world still spinning??” It may have stopped for a second, or two.But, in all seriousness, To Kill a Kingdom is brilliant.Don’t get me wrong, it’s not perfect by all means; in fact, I found the initial chapters that introduce us to the world of sirens, mermaids, and the Sea, as well as the world above water with its various kingdoms, a bit dull at times—and I was afraid I’d end up resenting this book.But much like an avalanche gaining speed, power, and force as it nears the bottom of the slope, I slowly came to be completely enraptured with it, as it turned more and more action-packed, volatile, and grand in every way.To Kill a Kingdom is in its essence a retelling of the fairytale The Little Mermaid, but the only elements of the story that are adopted from it are that a sea creature is turned into a human girl by an evil witch, and her fate hinges on whether or not she manages to fulfill the witch’s quest.
2.5⭐This was one of my most anticipated reads of 2018 but for some reason I still went in with some doubts, and I have to say, I was pleasantly surprised -for the most part-.If I could sum this up in one word it’d be - fun. That’s it, it was a fun and engaging read that had its ups as well as downs. It would’ve also been a sold 4-star read had it not been for the unnecessary, far fetched romance that completely ruined the entire narrative for me. Starting off with what I liked:✨The sirens:Damn,
Starting off with what I liked:✨The sirens:Damn, I loved how dark and vile they were.
All that ruthlessness, from both characters, that I was so attracted to instantly dissipated the moment they started getting all weak and sappy (I am, by no means, saying romance makes you weak but some semblance of believability makes all the difference).I was promised a ruthless siren and relentless prince on a murdering rampage - obviously, not the case here at all.
I had such a hard time believing his crusade as the saviour of humanity, as “the deadly siren hunter”.
This book disappointed me very much and it's not like I had high expectations before reading it, in fact my expectations before reading it were pretty low because I didn't know what to expect and I just wanted to read it.
It was pretty scary and interesting to read and this book was good enough if I only thought about how scary and brutal it was.
omg I really liked Madrid and Kye. They were such good characters and They were A LOT more interesting than Lira or Elian.
Madrid and Kye made me laugh or grinned several times and they were also cute and I liked them so much!
4 “An awesome debut novel” Stars ”Pirates are liars by trade and royals are liars by blood.” This is a fantasy novel in I had a blast while reading it, it was such a fun experience. And recently this has been a struggle since I am shifting my reading preferences towards the contemporary genre. I was so scared to be let down by this book, and I can gladly now say, I was not. The hype surrounding this book is crazy, but it honestly deserves it. An adventure with my lovely Monty. I was trash and ki
I am also a big fan of the dialogues in between Lira and Elian, literally, it was like looking to people in a ping-pong match.
I know this is strictly a stand-alone fantasy novel, but I would totally read other stories in this same world (*cough* Sakura and Queen Galina *cough*).
Even background stories of characters we met in this book, like Madrid.
It has been a while since I was such a fan of the main characters in a fantasy story okay maybe Penryn from angelfall, but shhhh..
And I was also sad that when Lira found love, her badass edge died quite a bit.
Let me say, first and foremost, that I am such a total sucker for books revolving around the ocean, whether it involves pirates, mermaids, sirens, sea creatures, or any mix of those things.
Every queen began as a siren, and when the crown passed to her, its magic stole her fins and left in their place mighty tentacles that held the strength of armies.→ sea lore ←I don’t think I could pick just one favorite thing about this story, but if I had to make a list of the traits that would tie for first place, the lore would absolutely make it into that tie.
Pretty damn good peeps! Mel 🖤
“Technically, I’m a murderer, but I like to think that’s one of my better qualities.” Rating: 5/5 stars Sirens. Princes. Betrayals. Oh my!Have you ever read book before that you could describe as delicious? Because that is the first word that comes to mind when I think about this book. From the very first page until the very last I was hooked.First of all, if you give me any type of Little Mermaid retelling it's pretty much guaranteed that I will be on board with it. But pair it with Alexandra
Second of all, if you give me any type of prince who could be Nikolai Lantsov's long lost brother, who also happens to be a pirate, you better believe I'm dropping everything to read it.
Lira, one of the most lethal sirens, also known as the Prince's Bane, happens to be the daughter of the evil Sea Queen.
And yet, here I am, completely head over heels over To Kill a Kingdom by Alexandra Christo.This is Alexandra's (I can call her by just her first name, right?) first book (to my knowledge), and I want you to remember her, because she is freaking fantastic and she will definitely go on to write my future favorite books.
I was captivated from the very beginning, all the way until the very end.The writing, the characters, and the story - I was just blown away by how much I loved it all.
this is my first proper review in forever yikesI am screaming into the void right now bc lately I’ve only been able to compulsively reread old favs and when I don’t I spend 16 years on A SINGLE BOOKBut damn, this book was so bingeable I literally couldn’t stop (this is my form of apologizing to myself for staying up till 2am reading and ruining the next day)Just to tell you how much I loved this book, halfway through I stopped reading so I could make an aesthetic board bc someone gotta^^this is what I do with my free time someone save me from myselfAnways, points of awesomeness:-	SIRENS, heart eyes-	A pirate prince who wears eyeliner O H M Y G O O D N E S S-	A snarky crew-	ENEMIES TO LOVERS TROPE YES PLEASE-	I mean a good portion takes place underwater, how epic is that??-	Kingdoms at war that lead to manipulation, deceit, and death-	A HELL OF A LOT OF SASS (especially the ship yes that’s my shipper heart screaming out of joy)
Buddy read with bitter✨ no one is more disappointed as I am...I was hoping for some amazing shit but tbh IT WAS BORING????LIKE IT WAS GOOD BUT IT WAS BORING?? THE PLOT IS WOW BUT THE EXECUTION IS MEHGod it was so boring. starting from page 100 something sweet lord I'm SO DISAPPOINTED. OVERALL IT WAS MEHWOW I HATE READING IM DONE I WAS SO LOOKING FORWARD TO THIS FUCK.ok fine it's boring but I still want to hop on Elian like a pogostick.
I mean, I went in with pretty high expectations, when I heard it was a re-telling of The Little Mermaid I was like okay I want to read this, I need this in my life.
The two come to meet in a way I won’t explain because spoilers… and then the story carries on, but you’ll have to read the book to find out what happens!"Any human who takes a siren’s heart will be immune to the power of their song”CharactersWe have the siren princess Lira my god.
I just love her.Do I have another leading man in my life in the form of Elian.
oh man. this was soooo dark. apparently everything disney taught me about the little mermaid is so very wrong! and honestly, i dont mind. i sped through this because i was dying to know how the story was going to play out. the only drawback was i didnt like lira. who knew it could be so difficult to relate to cold, heartless sea witch?? lol. but all the top notch banter and sarcasm made up for it!  3.5 stars
I’m an absolute sucker for mermaid/siren books and faery tale retellings, but I was initially a bit apprehensive about giving this a try, considering the mixed reviews and hype that I’ve seen circulating around GoodReads.
Keeping along the lines of the well-known Little Mermaid tale, Lira is given human legs and loses her siren song, as punishment for hunting her 18th prince before her birthday, which is tradition, and is tasked with taking the Siren Killer’s heart, in order to earn her mother’s forgiveness.
:) I highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys Greek mythology, faery tale retellings, mermaids & sirens as supernatural creatures, or under-the-sea settings!
