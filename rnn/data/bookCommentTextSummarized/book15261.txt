P. Seligman asks us to look instead at what’s good, and learn to turn good into excellent, making this a book on mental wellness, rather than mental illness.
It’s a refreshing change.Wouldn’t you rather feel more happy instead of less miserable?
And then, in a nice twist on the “So this is who you are” approach, we’re asked to identify which strengths feel natural to us, which feel enlivening.
Turn your job into something you enjoy (without necessarily changing jobs).
Find your strengths and enjoy who you are instead of trying to turn into someone else.
And enjoy this book.
Is this authentic happiness?JDN 2456177 EDT 13:59.When I started Authentic Happiness, I had the highest hopes—that this might finally be the way out of my depression. When I finished reading it, I felt even more hopeless and depressed. Now that I've had some time to reflect on it, I just feel ambivalent and disappointed. Seligman promises to offer us a fundamentally new approach to psychology, focused not on curing illness but on supporting flourishing, not on treating depression but on creating
Seligman promises to offer us a fundamentally new approach to psychology, focused not on curing illness but on supporting flourishing, not on treating depression but on creating happiness.
For Seligman, an optimist believes that good things are always personal, permanent, and pervasive, while bad things are always impersonal, temporary, and local.
In reality, both good and bad things can be either personal or not, permanent or not, pervasive or not.
If Seligman truly believes in authentic happiness, he needs to be much more careful to exclude this kind of thinking.
The Field of positive psychology is closing the gap between self-help literature and Psychology. Martin Seligman is the God father of this Science and this book is the most popular books about it. I'm studying Masters of Applied Positive Psychology after my MBA to give me the empirical evidences I need in my work as a self Development author, and it really does.In short: This is a highly recommended book for who are interested in self development based on real scientific researches.
Like, duh, just wanting to be happy isn't a good enough reason?
Dispute the bad thoughts as needed.- Enjoy pleasures that don't require a lot of effort--savor them and share them-- but more importantly seek out gratifications, things that require effort and produce a sense of accomplishment.- To make your job meaningful, find a way to use your signature strengths there.Things to rememberHow to forgive (p.
Reasons people hurt others: they feel their survival is threatened; they're afraid, worried, or hurt themselves; something about the situation; carelessness.-Altruistically give forgiveness.
Seligman believes there's more to mental good health than the mere abscence of illness or sadness, and has inspired a group of researchers to work with him on creating a new branch of psychology to figure it out.He catalogues the different ways of being happy: about the past, the future and the present.
He focuses mostly on present happiness, dividing it into two categories: pleasures and gratifications.
He gives you a way to figure out your strengths, then shows how you can find ways to apply them in your relationships and work, and how to encourage their development in children.
But I do keep coming back, so there are aspects of his work that I find interesting.This book and the test center at his website are really tie-ins to each other.
In the second half, Seligman deals with the concept of "signature strengths," which I am very interested in and was the tipping point for me to seek out the book in the first place.
Their theory is, rather than dwelling on the virtues we are weakest in, true gratification and fulfillment comes from arranging our lives in such a way that we are using our signature strengths as much as possible.This idea really appeals to me, and the last section of the book had some lovely suggestions on recognizing and supporting the strengths of our spouse and our children.
It interested me so much that I read the whole book, but always felt the injustice of being unable to dive as deeply into it as I wanted, since it was my senior year of college, and I was busy with other assignments.
Professionals have debated for years about the definition of health; does that mean absence of illness, or something more?
I would argue that it encompasses more, including an active, fulfilling lifestyle; and Seligman has written this book to help typical people find that kind of a lifestyle, and thus, true "health".But besides my admiration and support of Seligman, I just found this book to be fascinating.
The cover of this book seems pretty pathetic; I'll be the first to admit I was put off by it.
'Authentic happiness' from one little book.
Who doesn't love a good dig into Freud?
Here's a quote I liked:"Freud's philosophy, as bizarre as it sounds when laid out so starkly, finds its way into daily psychological and psychiatric practice, wherein patients scour their pasts for the negative impulses and events that have formed their identities.
Anyway, I'm looking forward to see what Seligman has to say, and I'm interested find out more about the Positive Psychology movement vs.
This book provides a detailed and insightful model of all the different contributors to happiness (fulfilment is probably a better word).
I would highly recommend this book - even if life is pretty good in general, it may provide that little extra *click* that leads to a Eureka moment.
Your signature strengths come in 24 flavours grouped into six categories that are ubiquitous through time and culture: wisdom/knowledge, courage, love/humanity, justice, temperance, spirituality/transcendence3.
Fulfilment comes from re-crafting your life domains (e.g. career, health, love, hobbies) to utilize your signature strengths on a daily basis.
I loved this book.
This book helped me to perfect the ability to "replace negative and all encompassing" thoughts with more neutral and more local thoughts.
For example, one could say, "Everyone hates me." But after reading this book, I would be able to replace that with, "Well, not everyone hates you.
And finally, I would add on, "Anyone can make everyone love them." But that is not your purpose.
Your purpose is to ensure that ..." It helped me a lot after getting wounded from poisoned arrows with great purchase.JV gave me this book, and I will always be grateful.
I’ve been meaning to read the work of Seligman for some time but just got to it now. This book seems to me a blend of research, history of Positive Psychology, and personal philosophy. It seemed like almost 3 books in one, but all of it was interesting and related in an engaging way. It includes some wonderful stories and exercises, and it made me think. For sure, I will read more Seligman.
Later I read Norman Vincent Peale.
This book mentions how Norman Vincent Peale's positive thinking grew out of early Protestantism (Methodism) in the United States and the notion of our having a free will to better ourselves (rather than being passive vessels waiting to be filled with grace).
The author asks the question as to whether the development of Positive Psychology, the program at the heart of this book, is just positive thinking "warmed over".
This book was published in 2002 and the author briefly mentions the 9/11 terrorist attacks in his End Notes, calling for prevention of future attacks rather than vengeance which he abhors.
Seligman as father of Positive Psychology is a convincing advocate for augmenting the disease model of traditional psychology and for broadening the base of those who understand the benefits of promoting authentic happiness.
While most of what he describes does not sound new, the read is worth while as it backs up all those long held beliefs buried in the self help sections of bookshops with solid emperical evidence.
Not much of his overview of traditional Psychology's history is fresh or new, but Seligman does review the history in a way reminding us of the key role of evolution in our search for personal happiness.
Seligman encourages people to focus on their strengths rather than improve their weaknesses.
The author is a capitalistic atheist who basically rejects modern psychology and wants people to work all the time to make more money for the rich.
The happiest couples look at the bright sides of the relationship, focusing on strengths rather than weaknesses, and believing that bad events that might effect other couples do not affect them.
Positive emotions about the past (contentment) can be increased with gratitude and forgiveness.
A pleasant life has positive emotions about the past, present and future.
At first, I try to sweep this under the rug, but after a decade of consistent variability, the time arrives for taking it seriously." (Page 23)"I found that teaching 10 year old children the skills of optimistic thinking and action cut their rate of depression in half when they go through puberty." (Page 27)"What progress there has been in the prevention of mental illness comes from recognizing and nurturing a set of strengths, competencies and virtues in young people - such as future-mindedness, hope, interpersonal skills, courage, the capacity for flow, faith, and work ethic.
One of Dr Selligman’s best books, disecting happiness and backing all his arguments on his scientific research.
Very interesting framework on Character Strenghts and its relationship to what he calls “the good life”, and practical “advise” on reflecting and landing these concepts to life, love, parenting and work...“Securely attached children grow up to outperform their peers in almost every way that has been tested, including persistence, problem solving, independence, exploration, and enthusiasm.
Feeling positive emotion and expressing it well is at the heart of not only the love between a mother and an infant, but of almost all love and friendship.”
This book was filled with tests. I found it valuable to think about my level of happiness and signature strengths. I thought about what virtues I have and which ones I might want to place more focus upon in the future. I wish I had read the chapter on raising children when my kids were little. I understand more about how I can achieve more lasting happiness. And what I like most about the book is its hopeful and optimistic nature. It was very inspiring and I have recommended it many people.
Seligman certainly has some good insights. I was a bit sceptical of the first few chapters. However, I learnt a lot throughout the rest of the book. I was particularly fond of the fact he referenced quizzes from his website. You could either take the quizzes straight from the book or on the website. I found the book helped me to identify my own personal strengths and overall the importance of having a more optimistic mindset.
This is a great introduction to positive psychology by one of its betterknown proponents. This book is aimed at a wider audience and is very readable. As such, for those of you with a degree in psychology, there is nothing new - merely a pleasant refresher of some of the classics and most insightful lines of research that fall under the umbrella of positive psychology.
This was another required read for a psychology class. It was easy to read with a great tone. Compared to Flow, I liked this one even better as I think any audience would be engaged and like to read it.
Про депрессии, неврозы и различные отклонения мне нравится читать куда больше))) А у Селигмана все про счастье, норму, позитив... Не впечатлило. Просто и банально.
I learned a lot about myself ... like that I'm "moderately hopeless" (ugh) and relatively high on the "revenge" scale. The good news is that I can fight these tendencies and live a more fulfilling emotional life.
Despite not being into self-help books, yet this one gets some interesting ideas about positive psychology, except the last chapters as far as I concern. Anw, it's a perfect ending to a perfect holiday ^^ So, how to be happy? Just be grateful for what we have, be mindful in our everday life, look on the bright side of everything 😉
El tema principal del autor es el de que la psicologia aplicada necesita adquirir prestigio académico, que actualmente no tiene, y que para lograr esto hay que buscar fondos que permitan hacer investigación seria y rigurosa para dar validez a las premisas en que se basa la teoria de la Psicologia Positiva.
En cierta forma es una psicologia preventiva lo que se proponen los profesionales de la Psicologia Positiva.El libro es una buena introducción a las premisas y los metodos de esta disciplina.
The author relates that in the history of psychology, much of the practice has been focused on the negative: people's social problems, delusions, irrational behavior, depression, etc.
He argues that this often ends up being counter-productive where people focusing on everything that is wrong or undesirable in their lives just leads to more negative feelings and more depression.
It seems like there's a school of thought especially prevalent in the U.S. that says people should have lives where they feel happy whenever they stop and think about it and anyone who doesn't have this kind of life has a problem (internal or external) that needs to be fixed.
Ends with a terrible whiff of putrescence?: An Existential Detective Story as he postulates an absurd theology (couched, of course, in carefully qualified language, deferential and apologetic) to justify his enterprise, acting as though the silence of not-even-an authority can be an effective stand-in for an honest-to-god fallacy of authority.And let me say, he's like "I wanted to include obedience to authority as one of the strengths even though it's unpopular." Why include it as a strength, because of its "ubiquity" in the Bible, the Qu'ran, and Confucius?
It's funny that when you study a bunch of organized codes of conduct set up by local authorities, they all emphasize obedience to authority.
When something bad happens to a pessimist, they think of it as universal and permanent.--Marriage between two pessimists is hard.--People get habituated to the good things in their lives.--Very interesting discussion of "flow" and how to get more of it in your life.--The difference between something pleasurable and something gratifying and how to optimize both things for happiness.--The study that this one professor could use to predict with 90% accuracy whether or not a couple would stay together or divorce.
--The five predictors from said study of couples who stayed together: 1)Partings: Find out one thing each is going to do that day.
Authentic Happiness is an important introduction to Positive Psychology-- the science of understanding and furthering what's right rather than what's wrong with us.
If you are disenchanted with mainstream psychology's emphasis on disorder and prescribed solutions, and if you want to enhance and make permanent the good things in life, you will find this book instructive and encouraging.
Finally, I imagine it would be very difficult to write a self-improvement book without injecting some of the author's personal life lessons or values into it; Seligman's anecdotes are relevant and illuminating and never sanctimonious.My only objection to Authentic Happiness was Dr. Seligman's attempt to unify theism with modern science.
I listened to the unabridged audio version of this book, which worked out well, as it's probably not something you need to focus 100% of your attention on.
He discusses them in the book, so it's fun to take them alongside reading or listening to his analysis and explanation.I didn't especially care for the final section with tips on raising children.
First, I've already raised my kids, so I didn't need the advice.
Second, his "tips" are based on his and his wife's experiences, not on scientific data.
