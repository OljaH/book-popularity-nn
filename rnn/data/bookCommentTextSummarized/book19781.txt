2.5 Really don't care for Phury Stars SpoilersFirst read 2014Reread 4/1/2017Oh God where do I start with the hot mess that is Phury? This book is the one I like the least of all the books in this series and that's because I really don't care for Phury. Let me just say that I like Cormia but I don't really understand how she and Phury fell in love. He totally ignored her for like 6 months. When did they spend enough time together to fall in love? Phury is a total drug addict for 85% of the book.
SpoilersFirst read 2014Reread 4/1/2017Oh God where do I start with the hot mess that is Phury?
This book is the one I like the least of all the books in this series and that's because I really don't care for Phury.
Let me just say that I like Cormia but I don't really understand how she and Phury fell in love.
I feel like Phury and Cormia didn't really have a relationship.
Little Nalla was born at the end of this book and I love Z as a father.
If I was rating this book on Phury and Cormia alone I would have gave this book 1 stars.
“You tell the others I was not worthy of her.” As the Directrix’s mouth fell open, he pointed his finger at her.
“That’s a goddamned order.
You tell them .
she is too good for me.
I want her elevated to a special rank.
. I want her fucking enshrined, do you understand me?
You do right by her or I’ll bust this place into ruins.”  I have to say that these 4 stars go to the BDB world and stories revolving around all the other characters.
I enjoyed the book even though I wasn't thrilled wi
Yep I just said that ahahahhah :D He is still in love with Bella, and is easing his suffering with red smoke and drugs, which is getting worse by the day.His drug addiction is making him think of nothing else but his next fix, and his obligations as Primale and one of the Brothers are in second place.His other favorite pass time is torturing lessers, and the Brothers are worried about him, which makes Wrath take drastic measures to force Phury to wake up and see where his life is heading.Cormia has adapted to her new life with the Brotherhood, even though she wants the closeness Phury isn't giving her.
Thanks." --PhuryYeah, I like to kick you a million times Phury and believe me, it wouldn’t be out of love.
It was rushed and by the time you finish it—or try to finish it—you wonder if maybe you missed something along the way.
Maybe you missed the TWENTY chapters of how Phury and Cormia fell in love.
Maybe you missed HOW Phury kicked the Brotherhoods’ ass and moved on with his life.
Maybe you missed Cormia STANDING UP for herself.
Maybe you missed Cormia ACTUALLY being a useful character.
Maybe you missed Phury acting like a TRUE hero that he was supposed to be.
I was quite annoyed that Phury wouldn't yield to this destiny, but understanding his Savior/Failure complex, he felt his was not worthy of her, and would only destroy her if he gave into his love for her.Cormia was not a doormat, as has been implied.
However I did like that we got to see John Matthew interact with and be attracted to Cormia and to realize that his destiny lay in another direction as far as mates, a tough, strong woman that makes his heart beat faster.
I loved their girl-bonding moments.Cormia did help Phury in ways that the other characters could not.
That was also great to experience.I loved seeing Cormia and Phury interact.
What is it about JR WARD's BDB Series that the more times I read the books, the more I love them.I loved Phury & Cormia's story ......more if that's at all possible....after my 4th read!!!!!  I think that Phury is probably one of the most underrated brothers...there's so much more to him than just being Z's twin!!!!!I am even beginning to "feel" for the Scribe Virgin...yes I am...her perfect world is just fading away..leaving her lonely and so alone!!!!AND I JUST KEEP WANTING TO READ THIS SE
I couldn’t stop reading….as soon as I finished the one I began on the next and before I got to the 4th book I had bought the entire series.What fascinates me about her books is that each one has different plot lines, different POV’S, sub-plots and there are secondary characters that we meet and continue to grow so one has a sense of getting to know a little bit more about them and kept in suspense of WHAT’S GOING TO HAPPEN NEXT!!!!This book is the 6th book in the series and it’s not really one of my favorites..I am not saying I didn’t like it it’s just that It’s Phury and Cormia’s story but it does not focus that much on them.
BUT if you want a series about a band of brothers, who are fighting for the survival of their beloved race of vampires, with gritty, captivating story lines that are filled with love entangled up in their epic trials of life then sign up immediately.
Vulnerability and strength shines through to bring our brother the ending we all craved for our beautiful hero.Phury is a loyal member of the Brotherhood, in the previous book we see our hero giving himself up as the species primale - a job given to keep the race thriving, his first chosen mate Cormia is impossibly beautiful and has lived her whole life in service to the brotherhood.
"'I love you forever' didn't always need to be spoken to be understood.” Phury and Zsadist are twins. Since Z was rescured and healed by his beloved Bella, Phury had tried to help him get past his nightmare and become a man that deserving a woman. But it was not that easy when Phury has feelings for Bella, from the last book, he cared for her too much and what happened in Lover Awakened doomed his life irrevocably. He chose to become the Primale of the Chosen.  “Among the problems with shame wa
But it was not that easy when Phury has feelings for Bella, from the last book, he cared for her too much and what happened in Lover Awakened doomed his life irrevocably.
So Lover Enshrined worked so hard to pass my expection, as I thought it was very hard that I would enjoy this book like Z's, and proved that Phury was an prominent character no less than his brother.J.R. Ward did her job very well this time.
Even though I didn't like Phury's story as much as Z's, still the book was excellent in its own way with the unique style that kept me attached to it until the end.
I did not care for his internal wizard or his drug addiction and felt the Brother's should have undertaken prevention long ago.
He should be more aware of what the Brother's are doing as well.As for Quinn's story, I fail to see how the race can be so desperate for "young" and treat one as an outcast because he has two different colored eyes.
Toss in the added Brother's are practically falling apart and what a mess.I did not care for all the details on Quinn, John Mathew, Blay.
I’m going to have to go with a 4-4.5 Stars for this one. There were a lot of things I really liked, but I guess following Vishous’ book was too tough of an act to follow.  Phury is Zsadist’s twin. He is the calm, cool brother. Always willing to sacrifice himself to help anyone out. Thats whats got him in this predicament in the first place. After being celibate for over 200 years (can you say world’s oldest virgin?) Phury takes V’s place as the Primale. This means he has to ‘bed’ and impregnate
There were a lot of things I really liked, but I guess following Vishous’ book was too tough of an act to follow.
Phury feels as though Cormia is being forced into this.
Cormia is the only good thing he has going for him.
A LOT goes on in this book, Phury and Cormia’s story takes up a little more than half, maybe?
The rest is a lot of Rehv, John Matthew, Qhuinn, Blay, Zsadist, Bella, Wrath, and of course small appearances by the rest of the BDB.
If this whole books was Phury and Cormia’s story, I don’t think I would have loved it.
3 Starsthis book was boring and I rlly don't care all that much for phury Rating: ★ ★ ★ / 5 starsLead Male Character: ★ ★ ★ / 5 starsLead Female Character: ★ ★ ★ / 5 starsPlotline: ★ ★ ★ and a half / 5 stars Genre: romance, vampires Will I recommend this book to others?: nah Will I reread this book?: nah Overall story summed up in one word: OK~ ~ ~ ~ ~ i love me some sexy vampires :)
Genre: Paranormal RomanceType: Book 6 of Black Dagger Brotherhood seriesPOV: Third Person - MultipleRating: After volunteering to take on a new role, Phury was having a hard time adjusting and accepting that things could no longer be the same.
The only way he knew how to cope was a destructive measure.Cormia's first time in their world proved to be a learning experience.
But thing were not easy when the future if their race hanged in balance.I love everything Phury ever did for this twin and the Brotherhood in general.
As a new power emerged and with chaos in the Brotherhood, they would be looking at a hard time coming ahead.
His chosen mate, Cormia, is somewhere in the next room and although they need to start producing babies, he does not feel like it.
But still Bella likes better him than Phury.Because of Zsadist, his right leg has no foot or calf.
So, it is better to talk to his wizard and then smoke some more.Well, if Phury wanted respect he was looking at the wrong girl:
Like the pool had caught fire.Cormia, on the other hand, didn’t look in his direction.
The previous books in this series were good so who would have thought this one would be a dud.
I must be a glutton for punishment!I had two major problems with Lover Enshrined.1.
Wasn't he supposed to be this book's hero?
I felt like he virtually contributed nothing to the story and I couldn't care less about him.
What was his real problem?
I became so frustrated that he continued his push-and-pull relationship with Cormia.
And he thought it was for her own good.
Almost every character in this book got their own POV.
The romance between Phury and Cormia fell completely flat.
Its Phury Time !!!!!!!!!!! here is the weekly installment of the Black dagger brotherhood eye-candy-lick-a-licious........ yes that is a wordFreaky-Friday-Phury[image error]
A clear departure from the Black Dagger Brotherhood...For better or worse...  “For fuck's sake, get off the cross. Someone else needs the wood.”    I've taken a few days to gather my thoughts before writing this review. Truth is, I did not love this book... But, I didn't hate it either... It was just different from the other books in the series and didn't live up to my own expectations. That's not the author's fault.One of the main problems: This was supposed to be Phury's moment in the spotligh
No. But we had come to expect this superlative level of achievement out of her, so our own expectations let us down.See where I'm going with this?Lover Enshrined might not have been the most awesome installment of the Black Dagger Brotherhood, but as a whole, everything fell into place.I loved the whole side-story of my boys - John, Blay, & Qhuinn.
My Other Reviews in the Black Dagger Brotherhood Series:
Lover Enshrined - You're Reading it6.5 Father Mine - My Review7.
Lover Avenged - My Review8.
Lots of excessive over the top language for no reason especially from Wrath which just didn’t fit.The only part that kept me reading was the sub plot with John, Blay and Qhuinn.
I like these three but the scene with Blay and Qhuinn was a bit too reminiscent of Butch and V.
It was as if she ran out of ideas in this book or didn’t try and just threw in a lot of stuff or repeated a lot to fill in pages especially with Z and Bella and Phury loving Bella from a distance—get on with it and get over it.
**3.75 Too Much Going On stars**LOVER ENSHRINED had so many different story lines going on that I started to lose interest in the book the further I went in it. Three main stories fought for attention in this book:♦ Phury & Cormia - frustrating ★★★♦ Rehv - interested at the beginning but as the book went on I dozed off ★★♦ JM, Blay and Qhuinn - BEST PART OF THE BOOK ★★★★★"The Wizard" came up with Top Ten Reasons, Phury, Is a Sh*thead.Here's  "Foxy's" Top 10 Reasons, Phury, Frustrated Me: 1.

Three main stories fought for attention in this book:♦ Phury & Cormia - frustrating ★★★♦ Rehv - interested at the beginning but as the book went on I dozed off ★★♦ JM, Blay and Qhuinn - BEST PART OF THE BOOK ★★★★★"The Wizard" came up with Top Ten Reasons, Phury, Is a Sh*thead.Here's 
Nicknamed "Hollywood." Lover Eternal (#2) {Rhage & Mary}Zsadist: has a twin, Phury.
Lover Enshrined (#6) {Phury & Cormia}Rehvenge: brother-in-law to Zsadist.
And when Phury finally got his act together and allowed himself to accept Cormia's love, it was a beautiful moment and brought tears to my eyes.
The plot about the future BDB brothers, John Matthew, Qhuinn, and Blay, and their close friendship, was especially interesting to me.
Obviously more will be revealed in a future book.And thankfully, a person very important from John Matthew's past makes a somewhat suprising return, brought back by a mysterious fallen angel.
It is about Phury coming of age, deciding what’s important in life, changing his perspective and safe ways.
Phury gets a realistic personal and love story and he features in a book which crossed the boundaries from PNR to UF.
Again.*spoiler alert* At the end of this book we see Phury has stepped up and has managed to change things for the better, both in his personal life as in vampire society.
I hope this will change because Phury deserves so much more.
4 "Red Smoke" Stars Where to begin....... I think this book reminds me of childbirth. All during labor you are cranky, not happy, feeling discombobulated and then you give birth and they place that baby in your arms and you forget how you felt before and all you feel is happiness!! The ending was so beautiful in my eyes that I forgot that this book did not wow me as much as I wanted it too. While this book was about Phury and Cormia, there was more BDB and Lessers stuff going on. I almost felt l
While this book was about Phury and Cormia, there was more BDB and Lessers stuff going on.
I almost felt like I needed a chart to keep all the comings and goings straight.
Their story took awhile to develop with Phury's drug addiction but in the end, I was happy and the very, very end brought tears to my eyes....it was perfect, healing and very sentimental!!I am a lover of all BDB and while this book didn't get 5 stars from me, it still delivered because I became more entrenched in the BDB world and it gave me a wanting of reading the next book and knowing all that I can where the BDB is concerned.
First you meet Phury in Zsadist’s story, Lover Awakened, and he also has a significant role in Vishous’ book, Lover Unbound.
Cormia appears first in Vishous’ book, and the insights into her offbeat, nonconformist thoughts are really impressing.Cormia and Phury are both vampires, furthermore officially mated, so theoretically there can be no obstacle between them.
Despite the fact that it is Phury and Cormia’s story,the most sensual moment is the first kiss of Blay and Qhuinn.The ending is pretty satisfying; I love the new perspectives!Lover Enshrined is not only a love story, it is also about the two main characters personal development.
Second re-read: 10.07.2017 I wasn't supposed to re-read this, but I missed Qhuinn, so I decided to fuck everything else, and read everything Qhuinn. So it goes without saying that I skipped everything but the parts of Qhuinn in the book this time around as well. I just love him. My second favorite character in this series. Behind Wrath. I think. Or he comes first. Shit, can they share first place?  See, this was the thing with Qhuinn. He could be out there and he could let his edge get away fro
Though I cannot really consider this a re-read considering I only re-read Blay and Qhuinn, and Wrath's parts of the book.
I L O V E Qhuinn and I'm gonna re-read everything that has to do with him and Blay.
- (view spoiler)[Yes, for now.
(hide spoiler)]Favorite character?
- Yes.Would I recommend this book/series?
- Yes.Will I read this again in the future?
Since V and Butch clearly aren't getting it on (you know what I mean ;)) (which I had hope so fucking much for) it seems like there might be some Blay and Qhuinn loving in future...
Having checked out what others have said at amazon I think you may have lost half of your romance readers I sure hope for your sake you can pick up enough urban fantasy readers.
I doubt you will, romance readers make up 50 percent of all books sold, and you aliennated many.
You should have given V and Phury their books, then stated you were going to try something new and made the boys the urban fantasy part, I would have been disappointed but I would have wished you well.
* * * * 3.5 BDB Stars * * * *This is the story of Phury and Cormia.
However, I didn’t enjoy this one like I have the other books.
I don’t want to rant about why the book let me down, I will just say that I expect more from my hero.
Weak.I still love this series and honestly what saved this book for me was the supporting stories.
I liked the peek we got of Rhev, and I can definitely see some kinky sex in BDB 7.
Love Buddy Reading with the girls in our little BDB Group.
3,5 starsOk I dint like it very much sometimes I was pissed with Phury...But in the end I love it!!!!I like Phury with Cormia.!!!!I like the scenes between Zsadist and Phury...Still my favourite brother is Zsadist!!!I love him and in the end with Bella....so sweet!!!!
Como mucho un 3.5Humo.
Así es como he sentido este libro.
Y aunque en cierto sentido me ha gustado y hasta he hecho las paces con Ward, reconozco que ese humo es como la historia de amor entre Phury y Cormia: una nube blanca difusa en la que se mueven los demás personajes.
Sin embargo, me he dado cuenta de que si algo hace bien la Ward, (aparte de que escribe de miedo), es que es capaz de hacer que los otros personajes, los secundarios, nos resulten atractivos, muy atractivos, hasta el punto de querer conocer su historia.
Sadly this was the book I enjoyed least so far in this series.
I found Phury to be infuriating ( I wanted to write inphuriating ).
I kept wanting to tell him to get over himself and deal with things.
And the ending did not help at all since it was just too neat and easy.
After 500 pages of angst how could everything be fixed just like that!The other parts of the book however were great.
A nice little happening at the very end guaranteed that this reader definitely has to move on to the next book and soon:)
I think J.R. Ward spent so much time interweaving the various storylines that she let the main love story lapse.
This is supposed to be Phury/Corima's story and it ended up becoming a race to see how many characters she could cram into the book.
Yes, she moved alot of different plots foward but in the end, she ended up not giving Phury/Corima the storyline that they deserve.
One reason I love her books is because she gets me invested in her characters.
She gave Corima so little personality that her pairing with Phury was lifeless and dull.
4 work-hard-for-your-story Stars   "Sometimes words didn't go far enough, the vessels of letters and the ladles of grammar incapable of holding the hearts sentiments."  This book's bloody hard work for the first 45% but oh, so worth it in the end...... worth the effort and slight boredom for the epicness of the continuation of the Black Dagger Brotherhood story....... "Phury's a good male. A great male. He loves deeply." I ♥ this series. I've fallen in love with the gorgeous hunks of the Black
worth the effort and slight boredom for the epicness of the continuation of the Black Dagger Brotherhood story.......
"He was a two-hundred-year-old clueless celibate."In reality, as per all the books in this series, J R Ward weaves and winds various other story-lines, characters, and awesomeness through this book....
I love the series so much I was ok with being bored with the first half...the second part completely made up for it.The ending still gave me that warm satisfied feeling, the fuzzies, so if you're reading this series and have heard Phury's book is not that great then, take heart, it gets there in the end.(view spoiler)[
- The author already knows where she went wrong with  Lover Enshrined  (as she stated in an interview on YouTube).I was extremely happy to be getting more of Z and Bella though; i love those two.Surprisingly i was not even once annoyed with Cormia, and found myself wondering why everyone was and didn't like her.
I was very happy with the end that's for sure, and my heart was melting on the spot (view spoiler)[ when Z came over and he told Phury about Nalla being safely born, and then he invited him over and they had this brother-ly hug.
