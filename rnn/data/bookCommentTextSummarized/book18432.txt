“You own me, Eva. Wherever I am, whatever I’m doing, I belong to you.”   Entwined With You was everything I could have wanted! I was thrilled with the story, happy with the ending and now am excited for the next books!  I LOVED IT!!! 5++ STARS! Since this is book #3 in the series, I am not going to talk about the plot at all here. This is not a standalone and should only be read after both Bared to You and Reflected in You.First you can all rest easy because there is NO RELATIONSHIP CLIFFHANG
Yes, there were still many unanswered questions for future books (mostly regarding external plot lines and milestones that Gideon and Eva still have to cross) but there was no relationship cliffhanger!There was also real no stupidity and no cheating throughout the book.
In this book, Gideon and Eva’s journey continues as they fight their inner demons and nightmares and work together at maintaining and building a functional relationship filled with intense desire, love and commitment.
Yes, in the issues external to the relationship, there are still unanswered questions but, if there weren’t any, then how would we ever have more books??Gideon and Eva were happy and together at the end.
“Sweet dreams, baby,” I whispered, wrapping my arms over his around my middle.His mouth curved against my neck. “My dreams already came true.”  I loved this book! I am SOOOOO happy I enjoyed it and it didn't disappoint me!I think keeping my expectations low after the disaster of Reflected worked ;)•It had amazing drama•Great story line•The characters felt more mature; like they didn't cling they way they did in Reflected.

I am SOOOOO happy I enjoyed it and it didn't disappoint me!I think keeping my expectations low after the disaster of Reflected worked ;)•It had amazing drama•Great story line•The characters felt more mature; like they didn't cling they way they did in Reflected.
you say stuff like that and totally make me want to throw my heart at you
See, you can't say stuff like this without giving us anything for book 4.
First only I am highly pissed because I wanted the book to end here.
You see that? That, right there?That’s me. Well, I’m slightly more feminine looking with a better rack.But yeah, that look on that face?I’m wearing the same one. And I just finished this book. Now, I know what you, “Crossfire” fanatics, are thinking.   But, HOLD ON A SEC! Okie dokie?I’m a huge fan of Miss Sylvia Day, too! Before I read this, I was counting down the days until it was released.***So remember that.***Because…   First of all… this series was planned as a trilogy, right? If I’ve rea
If I’ve read the right blog posts and articles, this series was supposed to be a *trilogy*.
As long as Gideon was in the picture, I would be stoked if she decided to make it a TWENTY-book series.
And then this one, the THIRD one… was made for a 5-book-series.So, basically, what we have is an author adding water to an AMAZING soup, trying to get it to last longer, right?
If you know spending time with an ex-boyfriend or whatever is going to piss off the love of your life… then here’s a brain-boggling idea:***Don’t spend time with the EX!*** 
And it was so much fun drooling over hot pics and complaining about Eva!And you can enjoy their AWESOMELY HAWT reviews, here:♦Debra's Review♦Joana's Review♦Kristalia's Review Keeping reading to find out my reaction to the book's delay from hell, Gideon's ownership and how we managed to pull off one hell of a buddy read.Earlier this year or better, late the PREVIOUS yearI was just browsing through my not-yet-released list, when something unexpected caught my eye...Entwined with You (Crossfire, #3)by Sylvia DayExpected publication: June 4th 2013 by Berkley COME ON!!!
** 1,5-2 "bored-out-of-my-mind" STARS ** November 15th 2014I'm enraged right now because I've just wasted a huge amount of highly valued time on this book that I will never be able to take back.And why did I have to waste my time on rereading a book I didn't even like in the first place?BECAUSE THE AUTHOR PUT 1,5 YEARS BETWEEN BOOK#3 AND BOOK#4!When I realized that I didn't remember ANYTHING about the story, I was left with no choice but to go through the same torture, again, before Book#4 came
This was the best BR EVER and...Now let's get to the real issue...This book was a MESS.I won't be nice and polite and say "It wasn't as good as one would expect."...It was one of the most BORING, most POINTLESS and my God...the EMPTIEST books ever.And I'm an Erotica reader.
Everyone is reading this damn series for Gideon, dude.
What was going right with this book?
*rubs hands*Plus, how could I ever pass the chance to BuddyRead with my awesome besties once more?FIRST THREE CHAPTERS OF "CAPTIVATED BY YOU"It annoyed the hell outta me, so read it at your own expense...
Now that I've finished my re-read, I can jump into book 4. I love me some Gideon and I'm excited to read some more of him <3  Rate the book... Not Gideon. Rate the book... Not Gideon. This is easier said than done. The book, a solid 3.5 stars... Gideon- 5+ stars, my rating= 4 Stars.Lets take a look at my Gideon...  Gideon Cross had been designed to fuck a woman right out of her mind.  And his Eva...  We were two halves of the same soul. If you haven’t read Bared to You or Reflected in You, yo
I love me some Gideon and I'm excited to read some more of him <3 
If you haven’t read Bared to You or Reflected in You, you should probably go do that asap, Gideon Cross is not someone you want to miss out on.
Wow. Gideon wants to make sure Eva knows how much she means to him.
. There are some unanswered questions, and some big things that are going to happen in the next book, you can tell, but Eva and Gideon are on solid ground so no worries there ;D I just love Gideon and Eva together.
but she can be around her buddy all she wants..grrrrr) Also there wasn't really a big storyline throughout this book,it was more about some loose ends from the previous 2 books but nonetheless I really enjoyed seeing Gideon back!
I prepared myself that this book was gonna be the end and that every little thing would be cleared out between Gideon & Eva and all the others, that it would all be peachy for them + a dazzling Epilogue...
The end of this amazing breathtaking series BUT there are gonna be 2 more books!!
After reading this I gave the rating a 3 star.
But now that I am writing my review and thinking about it, I am changing my rating to 2 stars!!!
When I received my ARC in the mail I was so excited to read this.
I been waiting a long time to finally getting back with Eva and Gideon.
But what I got was....
I left a damn good book I was in the middle of reading to start this.
I feel I should have waited.
Eva and Gideon talking more about their relationship instead of always having sex was nice.
I been waiting a long time to finally getting back with Eva and Gideon.
I left a damn good book I was in the middle of reading to start this.
I was getting tired of reading it after 30% and it didn't pick up from there.
I can give two fucks about them, I just don't get why they were in the book so damn much.
I'm not sure where else this book can take you.
The sex was fucking hot as always but with being bored in this book I was tired of reading even those parts.
If souls could be mated with wishes, ours would be inextricably entwined. The third book in the Crossfire series,  Entwined with You  continues the often tumultuous relationship between Gideon Cross, the twenty-eight year-old billionaire and one of the top twenty-five richest people in the world, and Eva Tramell.Ms Day does have a lovely writing style, if a little lavender for my tastes in contemporary romance.

Wait for a library copy.Is it worth reading?Yes, but only if you're a diehard Gideon and Eva fan.
If you're sorta interested, just wait for the library copy.
But, if you want to read it, and are reluctant to pay for it, I suggest wait for a library copy.
Español - EnglishEva, si eso es posible, adora más a Gideon por el sacrificio que hizo por ella, pero la desconciertan las actuaciones de Gideon sin contar con su aprobación. Aun así está segura que no puede vivir sin él y ella para Gideon es el aire que respira.---Eva, if that's possible, loves Gideon even more for the sacrifice he made for her, but she is disconcert with Gideon's actions without her approval. Yet she is certain that she can not live without him and she represents to Gideon the air he breathes.
Let me start by saying I loved the first 2 books of this series tremendously. I was besotted with Gideon so i chose to overlook the trivial things about both the books that irked me.Even this time i've been fairly generous. I've given 3 stars only because i'm blinded by my lust for Gideon.Why Sylvia Day?The storyline was already thin and now she's stretching it out hopelessly. She's adding silly plotlines to set the scene for the next 2 books, which i doubt many people will buy.She's butchered
Let me start by saying I loved the first 2 books of this series tremendously.
Gideon loves her unconditionally, for Christ's sake he killed a man to protect her.
I was gritting my teeth whenever Brett appeared in this book.
Why is the writer hell bent on describing the way Eva, Gideon, Cary and every freaking character is dressed and their physical attributes in every goddamn scene?
This has grated me since the first book but i'm less forgiving now.It kills me to say this but this book was just horrible and i'm done with Sylvia Day and the series.
Where will this book take this dysfunctional couple next? I can't wait.I need this book NOW!!!
DNF 23%I just couldn't get into it. I'm sorry but the story got boring and repetitive. (view spoiler)[the constant need for reassurance got old (hide spoiler)] . Gideon, I'm afraid we must go our separate ways. ["br"]>["br"]>
Wow.I loved...I mean LOVED...the first book. The second book was 'meh'. But this? Holy hot mess, Batman. The flowery, over the top descriptions and dialogue was just too much. All the needless drama and ridiculous amount of angst. Ack!!! Honestly, I'm surprised I was able to finish the book at all. Definitely one of my most disappointing reads.
You own me, Eva. Wherever I am, whatever I’m doing, I belong to you.”So this story...Its a continuation of Eva and Gideons relationship after what he did for her.He Risked it all for her..Nothing can keep them apart, not their secrets, turbulent pasts and malicious people.."Day One of my life was the day I met you"We see Gideon in a whole new light in this book- our favourite sexy billionaire is even more sexy and now that his "walls" are down he will melt your heart and wet your panties!!!"Gideon was an untamed animal behind closed doors, a lover who bared me to the soul every time he made love to me"*****SWOOOON ALERT******Eva and Gideon are scorching hot together!
Yes I've mentioned this but seriously its so fcuking HOT!I fell in Love with Gideon, possibly more with every page read- Eva wasn't too bad too."I look at you, angel, and I want you so badly.
I personally think that this is a HUGE mistake on Penguin's part.
A large portion of 50 Shades' success relied heavily on the fact that ALL THREE BOOKS WERE AVAILABLE WITHIN A MONTH OF EACH OTHER.
I know I will be dealing with a lot of ticked off customers once they realize they won't be able to read the third book until next Spring (my sister included).
Christmas is a huge selling season, and this title would have been the perfect gift for wives, daughters, sisters (hell even some men read this series).Penguin will lose readers over this choice, it's unfortunate but true.
Rating;2.5/5Yorum bilmem ne zaman gelir ama neyi anlatacağım ki? Seks bile otomatiğe vurmuş gitmiş kitapta. Üzgünüm Sylvia bundan daha iyisini beklerdim senden. (view spoiler)[ Bir tek evlendilerde ondan sonra kitap ilgi çekici olmaya başladı. Yoksa kitap boyunca entrika olsun, bir şeyler gelişsin diye bekledim. Nerede ikinci kitap, nerede bu.

★★★★★! Entwined with you (book 3). The continuation of Gideon’s and Eva’s epic, spellbinding & addictive story with suspense, challenges, self-discovery and their intense dysfunctional love!   “Gideon was a force of nature, his magnetic self-possession so powerful it put everyone around him in his shadow.”   Best experienced, The Crossfire series is Gideon’s and Eva’s epic love story, both broken, flawed and co-dependent and yet so determined and relentless for their elusive happily-ever a
The continuation of Gideon’s and Eva’s epic, spellbinding & addictive story with suspense, challenges, self-discovery and their intense dysfunctional love!
It’s their journey of self-discovery and fulfillment and about pushing all limits and surrendering it all for love.Books in the Crossfire series must be read in order:Book 1: Bared to YouBook 2: Reflected in YouBook 3: Entwined with YouBook 4: Captivated by YouBook 5: One with YouFor me the theme song for Gideon’s and Eva’s story is: ♫ Listen to Otis Redding’s soulful rendition of “My precious love” ♫.
more sex - talking - the percentage continues to climb...There is some minor interference with the other characters which go no where and add no substance to the non-existent storyline...
Ah well I'm happy you asked that question my GR's friends - my reason is three fold,1) even though there was minimal story, the sex they had that filled the majority of the book was really well written.
star 23) There is ONE EPIC FUCKING AWESOME SEX SCENE that was fan-fucking-tastic.
Seriously if book had scenes like the club one all through out my rating would have been much higher, even without a storyline!
Absolutely blown away! I love these books so much! Just fantastic.And every time I read another one I fall a little bit more in love with Gideon Cross. But oh my God, the heartache. Jeeez, can't these two catch a break? There could not be more obstacles in their way. My goodness!  "If souls could be mated with wishes, ours would be inextricably entwined."  I don't even really know what to write right now. I feel like just writing a review that goes something like...IT'S AMAZING IT'S AMAZING IT'S
Just fantastic.And every time I read another one I fall a little bit more in love with Gideon Cross.
If you've already read these books, I'm going to assume I don't need to do a whole lotta selling right now.
If you're on book #3, you must be feeling it and you'll know how fantastic and intricate this story has become.
I will readily admit that when I read the first book, I was like, 'Seriously?
A friend of mine, who hadn't read Entwined with You yet said 'Oh God, two more books?
Dang did the crap happen in this book. It was one thing after another. Wow. Just wow. The writing was amazing, kept me in-tune throughout most of this book and just when it was becoming slow, bam guess what....these two deserve such happiness. It's killing me what's happening to them. This author just doesn't cut Gideon & Eva a break.  I'm hoping the next book might ease up, but I'm highly doubting that =))Gideon you about made me smash my kindle in this book then you completely made a 360 t
Dang did the crap happen in this book.
It's killing me what's happening to them.
This author just doesn't cut Gideon & Eva a break.
I'm hoping the next book might ease up, but I'm highly doubting that =))Gideon you about made me smash my kindle in this book then you completely made a 360 turn around.
Eva, oh sweet Eva I hope you stay strong, for yourself and for Gideon.
I don't know what the next book will bring for you but dang did you remain strong during this one.
But we do get a lot of good steamy scenes from Gideon and Eva, after all, they have a lot of making up to do.
Gideon still keeps things from Eva and it drives me crazy!!
Corrine continues to be a major thorn in both Gideon and Eva's side but this time she's pulled out all the strings...and what's going on with her husband, Jean-Francois?
My favorite part was Gideon and Eva's weekend!!
I feel like my f*cking sanity depends on you, Eva, and you want me to be happy about that?”♥ “Hmm … You’re wearing the f*ck-me look,” he drawled.
The guy bares his soul to her, kills for her....and she's suddenly unsure about her feelings towards her ex...the douchy Brett....and all the sexy dancing with strange men in clubs...........Gideon, get rid of Eva please!!!!Nothing happens in this story....oh, yes....sex and more boring sex happens and nothing else!!!
”Honestly, Gideon Cross had been designed to fuck a woman right out of her mind.” You f&cking own me , Eva. I’ll be damned if I don’t own you back "I look at you, angel, and I want you so badly.
This is the most disappointing and horribilis one in the series - so far!!!Will I continue with Gideon and Eva????
I also loved reading about how Eva and Gidoens relationship develops and there were a few surprises in store for me,I'm glad I went back to it because I now have a renewed sense of eagerness to read the next book, and I know Gideon will make it all worth it in the end, I suppose I just can't help but feel duped as a reader......it just feels to me that story is being strung out a bit too much.....ad for me sometimes LESS is MORE!!!!
5 AH-MAZING ENTWINED STAR's   We start this love story where we are left after reflected in you. Eva learns what Gideon did to protect her, to keep her safe. They get back together but have secrets to keep so their relationship is kept quiet. "Just be with me" I whispered, my eyes stinging all over again. "I need you." Gideon's fingertips glided softly down my cheek. "You were with me, The whole time. There wasn't a second that passed when you weren't on my mind. You own me, Eva. Wherever I am,
Gideon is his domineering possessive self, he'll do anything to keep Eva safe and loved.
Eva's dad adds his own moments with Eva. He loves Eva and wants her happy we see more of them....
that they want them to get there HEA sooner, I am personally very happy I love this story and am happy to go through more with them, not just for Gideon but for Eva I can see how there is a lot more to come such as there nightmares, there torment, there family's, ex's.
“Honestly, Gideon Cross had been designed to fuck a woman right out of her mind.”*“…he murmured. “Of course, you’re my favorite ride.” “Aw, that’s sweet, baby. And you’re my favorite joystick.” *********************************************************This is the third book in the Crossfire series with Gideon and Eva.I LOVED the first 2 books, but this one I had a really hard time getting into it.

This man is abso-freaking-lutely AMAZING, PERFECT, GORGEOUS, LOVING, DEVOTED TO EVA, HOT, and LOOKS LIKE A SEX GOD....
I want to wake up to you like this every day forever.
Re-read with my funny ladies; Supreet, Flo & Eda ♥♥♥ Well...that's a whole load of bullcrap in one book. I'm a little abhorred that I rated this 5 stars previously (that says a lot about my book taste back then, damn you FSOG frenzy and my desperate fix of withdrawal). So this is my attempt of an unconventional review because honestly, I'd like to write a letter to this author. WARNING: Spoilers ahead for Book 3 if you haven't read. But then again...I'm pretty sure 90% of you have already r
Dear Sylvia Day,I'm not sure why you would make any reader wait a year and a half for another book in this series or why for a matter of fact, that you would not let this series end already.
Honestly I read 3 pages in and I couldn't remember for the life of me who the frak is 90% of the people in this series except Gideon and psychobitch Eva. Also her annoying bisexual roommate, Cary.
Honestly, I'm not even sure what's left to read about because Book 2 was a whole bullocks of filler and so was this one.
And the other star,for having a bit of a plot and for the authors style of writing...I know this is the part where I tell the  Crossfire series...." I'm breaking up with you "But sadly...no I won't..lol.yes I known.I love to torture myself tht way....Even though I DID NOT like Cary...or Corrine..or..anyone (except Giedon) and even Though I really dislike Eva and her selfishness..n her temper...n her ability to FORGIVE Giedon..sooooo easily for EVERYTHING..I will still be reading book 4...just to finish with the series...I mean seriously was tht even necessary ?
I even know Giedon's going to sulk his whole way to through book 2 feeling guilty over Corrine and the baby...n how it's all his fault  (hide spoiler)] and I didn't even like this book ending, even though it wasn't a cliffy !
♥ ♥ ♥"Hello, Dark and Dangerous." "He was so fragrantly, sexually, beautifully male."♥ ♥ ♥So this book as you've probably guessed is more of the same.....Gideon, Gideon, Gideon & Eva, their love, their trust, their jealousy, their story........xoxo"I want the heart inside the body." ~ Eva  
Wait for me, Eva. I waited my whole life for you."It was absolutely freaking swoonsome the whole way through, lots of hot, yummy, sexy action from our fabulous book couple.....I was melting all over the place.....it was steaming HOT!!!
Final rating: 3.5/5 stars  Buddy Read with  Georgia,  Debra ,  Joana , Ash!!
Thank you girls ♥    “I look at you, angel, and I want you so badly.
I want to be with you, listen to you, talk to you.
I want to hear you laugh and hold you when you cry.
I want to sit next to you, breathe the same air, share the same life.
I want to wake up to you like this every day forever.
I want you.”   Gideon definitely owns my body, heart and soul!!!!!!
♥ Ever since i have read first two books, i have been eage
. Because this book and story had such a great potentional, and now it feels like it was made only to fill in the time before the last 20% of the book.
I loved Eva in first two books.
His love for Eva is unparalleled, and yet, she still doubts him sometimes and it makes me feel hurt.
and this book felt like all those "
But, the good thing is, i will have opportunity to read more about Gideon (even Eva) and Cary, which makes me happy.
the other two books are from Gideon's point of view,
