There’s nothing novel; the advice is common to financial self-help books: take responsibility for your life, have an abundance mindset, set high goals, own your own business, specialize, serve others, and earn passively.The author focuses on monetary riches, not general wealth or happiness, which other self-help books do.
He’s quite harsh on the poor and middle class; although I agree that people’s financial situations are often a result of their own choices, sometimes things are beyond a person’s control.
admire, learn from, and spend time with rich people.
• Poor people trade time for money.
Rich people get paid for their results.
If you liked "Think and Grow Rich" or "Rich Dad, Poor Dad", you probably will too.Let's get past what might bother some people:-there's a good bit of promotion for Eker's seminars.-there is a very black and white view of people (rich and poor).
This book has a financial focus, but I honestly feel like the tools here could be used toward any area that you want to self-improve.
When I finished reading it, I found myself so excited that I wanted to run out and buy it for friends/family, but....nothing offends people like handing them a book on finances or self-help!

الثراء يبدأ بفكرة ..

You must acquire the habits and skills of managing a small amount of money before you can have a large amount.- The more your money works, the less you will have to work.- Author's definition of financial freedom is simple: it is the ability to live the lifestyle you desire without having to work or rely on anyone else for money.- Long-term versus short-term: poor people work to earn money to live today; rich people work to earn money to pay for their investments, which will pay for their future.- If you are willing to do only what’s easy, life will be hard.
.في الجزء المتعلق بالمخطط المالي يستعرض الكاتب أهمية الأفكار السابقة الراسخة في العقل الباطن تجاه المال وادارته وكيف يمكن اعادة صياغة تلك العلاقة لتكون ناجحة.
في رائي الكتاب يحمل شعارات اكثر من حقائق وان كان هناك فعلا بعض الاستراتيجيات الجيدة ولا انكر ذلك ولكنها اقل حيّز في الكتاب من الجانب القصصي المتخم.

I'm in a business coaching group and one of the other members was raving about it, so I figured it was worth a try.It starts out with a very interesting perspective, looking at how our thought and behavior patterns around money are formed by our childhood experiences, particularly seeing what our parents did (which we later either replicate or rebel against).
There are certainly some interesting thoughts along the way, but it gets a little tiresome to hear nothing but cheerleading for "success" in the form of nothing but money.
That's why you should read this book.The book is divided into two parts: 1) Your Money Blueprint and 2) The Wealth Files: Seventeen Ways Rick People Think AND Act Differently From Poor and Middle-Class People.
Instead, I'll list my favorite Maxim.#7: RICH PEOPLE ASSOCIATE WITH POSITIVE SUCCESSFUL PEOPLE.
POOR PEOPLE ASSOCIATE WITH NEGATIVE OR UNSUCCESSFUL PEOPLE.The real reason I chose thie Wealth File is for this thought (and for my money, it's the best line in the book): "Instead of mocking rich people, model them.
Instead of shying away from rich poeple, get to know them.
Good read for anyone who wants to become successful. I read it in a couple of days on the train. I learned quite a few things, but I wish there were more examples in the book, and a little more information about the author's career.
اعشق جدا الكتب التى تتحدث عن "كيف تصبح غنى" ليس بالطبع تلك الصورة الكوميديا ف الاذهان عن على بيه مظه
من أفضل الكتب اللي قرأتها في هذا المجال إن لم يكن أفضلها على الإطلاقالكاتب لديه إسلوب فريد ومحفز جداً الكتاب مفيد حتى للي مو مهتمين في مجال التجارة والثروة لإنه يتكلم عن مبادئي أساسية تقريباً نقدر نطبقها على جميع مجالات الحياةوتصنفيه وترتيبه للأفكار جداً رائع وإستنتاجاته مذهلةوأكثر هالأفكار تتطابق مع ما ذكرها الدكتور صلاح الراشد كـ قوانين للكون ، مثل قانون الجذب وقانون الوفرة وغيرها من القوانين اللي فصّل فيها الدكتور في برنامجه رسالة من الكونراح أكتب ملخص كامل عنه إن شاء الله في المدونة قريباً
"الأفكار تؤيد إلى مشاعر، المشاعر تؤيد إلى أفعال، الأفعال تؤيد إلى نتائج" ومن هذا المنطلق عمل على تغيير الفكر وتوجيهه، ومن مبدأ أن ما تركز عليه يتوسع ويزداد، وما يتعلق بقانون النوايا التي لها أثر السحر ..قسّم كتابه إلى شقين، الأول تحدث فيه عن كيف تكونت تلك الأفكار وبأي طريقة، والشق الثاني عبارة عن سبع عشرة طريقة خاصة يتصرف بها الاغنياء بشكل مختلف عن الفقراء وأبناء الطبقة المتوسطة، تتضمنها قواعد أساسية من ملفات الثراء وتصريحات وأفعال تدريبية ..الكتاب قيّم جداً ويستحق القراءة وبجدارة ..
I connected to this and I feel like what I'm really doing right now in IMG is my piece of the puzzle to this world.
In my company, it's really about the mission and changing people's lives for the better through financial education.Our country lacks this, and there are so many lives wasting away because people are too caught up doing the things that don't really matter, and yet they wonder why they are still in the rat race...
You may earn more when you're older but it will only be harder to save since your lifestyle also changes, you spend more.
I've read this book 3 times now, and each time I get something new out of it. Teaches you to expand your mind, how to think like a highly successful person, teaches you to eliminate previous ways of thinking and expand your horizons. Truly motivating.

Ya he leído el libro, ahora tengo que analizarlo e interiorizarlo. Ahora queda lo difícil. Es una lectura que afecta de distitna manera a cada persona, cada uno debe extraer aquello que quiera y pueda aplicar. Como todos los libros de este tipo, no se puede ni deber tomar al pie de la letra.
أن تكتسب عقلية المليونير أهم من أن تملك الملايين ! كتاب عملي وذكي عندما تطبقه تشعر بالثراء وتتجه إليه وتجذبه. شخصيًا قرءت الكتاب ثلاثة مرات في ثلاث مراحل من حياتي ، وفي المرة الثالثة تحققت نتائجه اثناء تطبيقه! إنني في طريقي للحرية المالية .
كتاب على غرار الأب الغني والأب الفقير، يحاول شرح طريقة تفكير الأغنياء من قبل شاب متوسط الدخل صنع ثرو
I read a lot of this kind of make-a-million book, and I'm not cynical, so trust me.Eker relates 19 differences in thinking between rich and poor people.
But there's a certain type of rich person who.got most of his money by making promises to starry-eyed people, and Eker is one of them.
He mixes practical though vague and tired wisdom with neurolinguistic and mystical crappola.You can have a better version of this book by listening to old Jim Rohn talks on YouTube.
For example, Rohn said "How high does a tree grow?
This is not the only example.Don't waste your time and money on this book.
(who makes this stuff up?)His premise is that a person can increase one's 'blueprint' if one thinks and acts like a wealthy person.The second part of the book is the explanation of the 17 most important differences in the way a rich person thinks compared to the way a poor person thinks.There is just enough truth in this book to make it believable and appealing to some folks.
There are some good thoughts, practical thoughts and even some Biblical thoughts about money but it's framed in such idolistic framework that it is hard to swallow and follow.I don't want to live my life centered, focused and consumed by accumulating wealth.

This book offers a wealth of knowledge, and knowledge is power. It was eye opening, accessible and smart. I appreciate the way each section is written as Eker challenges your perspectives to be more conducive to personal growth. I highly recommend it for those open to discovering more about themselves. It is for people who are tired of suffering the same with little to no results and want to change their thoughts and their relationship with wealth. This book isn't just about reading and learning, it is about taking action to succeed.
If I hear "Touch your head and say 'I have a millionaire mind'" one more time...
Sure, some self promotion is nice but I don't want to hear the same thing 50 times.** A lot of time is spend on what boils down to "growth mindset".
It goes completely against the solid advice of figuring out how much your time is worth to you and not spend it on activities that net you less (unless there is some non-financial benefit).This is just what I remember out of the top of my head.2 stars since the book does contain some actual good points, including some of which I got a slightly new perspective on.
Las acciones llevan a resultados.- Cuando el subconsciente debe elegir entre emociones produndamente arraigadas y la lógica, casi siempre ganan las primeras.- Si tu motivación para adquirir dinero o éxito procede de una raíz no productiva, como el miedo, la rabia o la necesidad de <>, el dinero nunca te reportará felicidad.- Ser consciente es observar tus pensamientos y tus acciones de modo que en el momento actual puedas vivir eligiendo verdaderamente en lugar de ser dirigido por programaciones del pasado.- Puedes adoptar las actitudes que contribuirán a tu felicidad y a tu prosperidad en lugar de caer en actitudes que no ayudan a ello.- El dinero es extremadamente importante en las áreas en las que funciona, y extremadamente poco importante en las que no.- Cuando te estás quejando te conviertes en un imán viviente para la desgracia.- No existe ninguna víctima que sea rica!- Si tu meta es estar cómodo económicamente, lo más probable es que jamás te hagas rico.
This was a nice, light read yet very thought-provoking in terms of examining my own beliefs about money and wealth.I don't mind Harv's promotion of his seminars - after all, this book is but one product of his highly successful seminar company.
It's perfectly logical to me that he underline that if one enjoys this book and wants to delve deeper into its subject matter, then the seminars are extentions of the book that allow you to go further.
He hasn't earned his fortune by sitting beside his telephone, hoping that it would ring with customers wanting to buy - yes or yes?
I highly recommend giving it a read!
El libro más importante que he encontrado sobre la abundancia, recomendado para cualquier persona.Mu
But I discovered that is a particular mindset (or money blueprint as the book calls it).
This book is all about having a positive attitude and believing that you deserve good things and learning how to draw success towards you.
I like the idea of learning to put a higher value on your own self worth, which usually involves going into business for yourself and using your talents to the fullest potential.
There is also mention of calculated risks and having the sense that you will always come out on top even if a particular venture seems to fail.
عادة مثل هذه العناوين التسويقية حول المال تدفعني للهرب، لكنني ذات ملل بدأت بتصفحه ثم وجدت نفسي منغمسة بالقراءة.
الدراسة حول سيكولوجية العقل الباطن وهي لا تتعلق فقط بتعاملاتنا مع المال بس بكل ما حولنا بقياس بسيط.
وجدت الفصل المتعلق بالخطط المالية مع شريك الحياة شيء جميل، وأنا من مؤيدي تغيير فكرة تحقيق الثراء يجب أن لا تكون للحظة عسر بل للحظة فرح أو حرية مالية.
هي مسألة إدارة فورية وذكاء وسرعة وبديهة مع الكثير من التدريب في البداية لكسر معتقدات ترسخت في الباطن.الجدير بالاهتمام أن الكاتب شخص روحاني وقد أشار إلى كونه رجل دين ولكنه يلخص مفهوم الثراء فعليا وكيف أن المال أصل كل خير وليس العكس.
