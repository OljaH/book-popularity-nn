The first few chapters are a little slow and not very exciting, but they are important and hold crucial story points that will come into play later, so to anyone reading this for the first time, I recommend sticking it out and reading on...because it quickly turns to great once the story gets going!
I could not put it down the first time I read it, which was in 6th grade.
I don't need to read the whole book front to back anymore, but I do love just getting that taste every so often.
Jack Sawyer's mom has cancer and the only thing that can save her is The Talisman, a mysterious McGuffin housed in a haunted hotel all the way over on the opposite side of the country.
Still with me?Co-written with Peter Straub at the beginning of the 1980s, The Talisman simultaneously feels like a dry-run for the Dark Tower and a collection of Stephen King's greatest hits up to that point.
Trial run of the Dark Tower or no, The Talisman is an enjoyable epic and a taste of things yet to come from Stephen King.
Everything comes back, like the moon.‚ÄùOnly the Talisman will save young Jack Sawyer‚Äôs dying mother and he must embark on a quest across America (and into another world) in order to obtain it.I had been anticipating The Talisman since forever, I can‚Äôt even put my finger on why, I just had the feeling it would be a book I would fall in love with.
I still REALLY enjoyed it and think it‚Äôs a fantastic book, but it‚Äôs not a new favourite.
I think part of the problem is that I was comparing it to the Dark Tower, and it was never gonna come close to surpassing King‚Äôs magnum opus, and my favourite book series of all time.

Sometimes a few of us will like a book or writer, but for completely different motivations and coming from different perspectives altogether.‚ÄúIt had great action‚Äù‚ÄúThere was wonderful characterization and dialogue‚Äù‚ÄúIt was a clever allegory and well written.‚ÄùEtc. etc.And so we come to Stephen King‚Äôs 1984 collaboration with Peter Straub, The Talisman.
There are horrific undertones but almost absurdist in its originality.Like The Dark Tower books, and Insomnia and It, and 11/22/63 and several others of his works, this is about a multiverse where different worlds are connected together by a thin membrane of a boundary, easily crossed.This is about a child and a journey and inspiration was taken from Mark Twain, this is a great American fantasy that may still hold attraction to any of King‚Äôs or Straub‚Äôs fans around this world.
Tricksy ReviewThere is so much that happens in this novel, that any thoughts I can cram into one review will always be woefully inadequate.Don't you sometimes think there's more to life than order?Don't you want just a little magic?It is perhaps a good thing to read this book three decades down the line, separated from the hype that so weighed it down when it was first published.
This is not Narnia.He went down the stairs on all fours, silent as oiled smoke, eyes as red as brake lights.As befits any good supernatural Horror story, there are some fearsome critters to be found here.

"The Talisman" never ceased to amaze, surprise, or excite me!
A truly breathtaking book!FULL REVIEW TO COME
Recently, a good GR friend agreed that the word 'magical' is a great way of describing The Talisman.
In Jack, for instance, we learn much about his personal character (as opposed to the superficial,) to the point that it almost feels like an invasion of his privacy.
In fact, it would be such a relief that I would probably laugh all day and most of the weekend.." " By the fourth and final section, aptly entitled The Talisman, I absolutely loved every word.
On a side note, Jack's mother, Lily Cavanaugh, felt very distant throughout most of the novel.
One of the things that I love the absolute best about Stephen King's books (most of them) is that they are immensely re-readable, and depending on where is in one's life, or how many of King's other books one has read, the experience could be completely different each time.
Jack has always been one of my favorite characters, but this time through, I felt much more empathy toward Richard.
But it was the little things, like Jack thinking that Wolf would enjoy a double-feature in a movie theater when he knows that loud noises scare him, and he's never even heard of a movie in his life.
Travelling Jack is on a quest to save his ailing mother through worlds within worlds.
He is only 12 years old and he starts to embark on experiences that are painful and heartwarming that mold him into someone unique.
This is an unforgettable tale of Jack on a quest to save one person he loves more than himself his Mother!
'Near the middle of December in the year 1981, a boy named Jack Sawyer stood where the water and the land came together, hands in the pockets of his jeans, looking out at the steady Pacific.

Este es uno de los libros m√°s dif√≠ciles de conseguir de King; s√≥lo se consigue usado, e incluso as√≠ es complicado hacerse con √©l.
Es uno de mis libros m√°s importantes.S√≠, quer√≠a presumir.
Ya que fue mi culpa, porque eran muy altas mis expectativas.El inicio es bastante lento, hasta en partes inveros√≠mil.
Tiene fragmentos que son muy tristes, y en esos mismos el estilo de narraci√≥n sello King fue extraordinario; imposible no sentir la aflicci√≥n de los protagonistas.En fin, una novela maravillosa, recomendable para todo quien le guste la aventura y la fantas√≠a.
Que te va a dejar una marca profunda en tu coraz√≥n.Un libro inolvidable.
D≈æek se nada da on krije tajnu izleƒçenja njegove majke, dok Morgan Slout, poslovni partner D≈æekovog oca, veruje da se u njemu krije neiscrpna moƒá koja ƒáe ga uƒçiniti najmoƒánijim ƒçovekom u svim svetovima.Fantastiƒçna stvar kod ove knjige je to ≈°to pru≈æa daleko bolji uvid razumevanje u to kako funkcioni≈°u svetovi u najpoznatijem Kingovom serijalu, Mraƒçna kula, dok je predstavljanje verskog fanatizma priliƒçno realistiƒçno opisano.
Jedinu zamerku imam na naƒçin na koji su pojedine celine napisane i na to kako se priƒça zavr≈°ava.
Da li su crni hotel i Crna kuƒáa povezani i ako da, na koji naƒçin, to me najvi≈°e interesuje.
I just wish it had been on something less than 670 pages.I began to stitch together a longish review pinpointing all of the things that didn't work in this book, but I decided that since 2014 hasn't yielded me much precious reading time so far, I'd much prefer to spend free hours lost in another book and not thinking any further on this one.
If so, I hope they ask him over a ham sandwich what the deal is with the recurring Magical Negro trope that appears in every novel I've read of his so far.
Classic! Epic! Timeless! Two of my all time favourite authors. üêØüëç
As I was reading this book I kept thinking about The Dark Tower series.
There were a lot of similarities.
And don't these horror writers love their old hotels and fairgrounds as settings.
I enjoyed this book very much but it was a labour of love to read it.
At times it became very wordy and occasionally even a little overdone.
The humour in their dialogue helped to lighten the horror from time to time.
The climax of the book was satisfying if a little long drawn out and left me feeling it deserved a comfortable four stars.
No.The problem I have with this book (and many of the Stephen King books I've attempted to read) is that everything in it is presented as being mean, petty, twisted, angry, cruel, etc.When I read, I'm willing to wade through sad, oppresive, heart-wrenching difficulties with the main characters if necessary, but ultimately, I read fiction in the hopes that it is going to help me feel good about life, forget my troubles, forget how awful we can be to each other.
Finally, I just couldn't stand the thought of picking the book up to be brutalized by Stephen King's and Peter Staub's writing again.
Guess who finally finished the World's Longest Buddy Read?Me. Twelve-year-old Jack Sawyer has one mighty task ahead of him.
Speedy‚Äôs got the magic juice that helps Jack flip from our world to the Territories.
The Territories is a parallel universe that somewhat mirrors our world albeit an old-fashioned version.
The most notable friend of course is sixteen-year-old werewolf, Wolf.
And his love for Jack seems to know no end.
He and Jake Chambers know an awful lot about handling things that are well beyond the capacity of others their own age; about facing horrors that no one, let alone a twelve-year-old, should be facing.
But the thing that I love the absolute most about Jack, is that he's still human and still vulnerable.
Oatley and the Sunshine Home for Wayward Boys are two of the most awful places I've read about in a YA book (which I do consider this to be), but they could both, magic aside, really exist, which makes it even worse.
I also felt that some of the more quirky-weird things were probably Straub's -- not that King has any shortage there, but it was just the feeling that I got, and one only has to read the first story in "Magic Terror" to see why.
Alrighty, well, this is going to be a short and sweet review, because I've read this book 73 times and have already reviewed it twice on Goodreads previously, and I'm feeling rather review-lazy today. If you want to check out either of those previous reviews, here are links: 2010 read: https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...2016 read: https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...That is all. :)
4.0 stars.
Stephen King knows how to tell a story and this is another good example of his talent for world-building and plotting.
Having read this, it is amazing to me that this story was not originally intended as part of the "Dark Tower" universe because the tie-ins are "in your face" for most of the story.

Jack‚Äôs Mother: The premise of Jack‚Äôs mom dying of cancer and letting him leave and travel the country seems a bit far-fetched.
Maybe I missed something in the book, I but it was unclear to me how Speedy was able to show up in all the right places at all the random times.I feel like maybe I am being a bit harsh with ‚ÄúThe Talisman‚Äù but after reading The Dark Tower series I end up comparing all of Stephen King‚Äôs work to the DT.
Jack Sawyer has had a life unlike most kids his age, and his wisdom, determination, and just all-around kick-a$$ness throughout the entire novel, show even a twelve year old boy shouldn't be underestimated.
I think one of the things I liked best about The Talisman was Jack Sawyer.
Even though this was a collaboration between King and Straub, I felt this was such a really well-written novel: The writing was superb, but also I felt loose ends were tied, my questions were answered, and I felt as though I went along with Jack on his journey.
It has been at least twenty five years since I first read it.I am happy to say the intervening years did nothing to diminish this epic story's capacity to engage and absorb me.
A boy hits the road, on a mission to cross the country and find the mystical object which has the power to heal his cancer-stricken mother.More coming of age tale than anything else, this book is epic fanasy with a healthy dose of gory horror and suspense.It is a bit overlong, but the writing is so good, it doesn't matter.
Meni se jednostavno nije dopalo.
Mnogo sam se muƒçio ƒçitajuƒái, em zbog prijevoda ( koji mi se nimalo nije dopao, previ≈°e jednodimenzionalan ) em zbog mnogih logiƒçkih gre≈°aka u priƒçi.
Nije ni ƒçudo ≈°to sam knjigu 5 puta dosad poƒçinjao, i nikad nisam pre≈°ao stotu stranicu.
Iako ima i dosta pozitivnih stvari ( odliƒçan uvod u priƒçu, simptaƒçne likove itd itd ), ova mi jednostavno nije sjela.
Da sam je ƒçitao prije nekih desetak godina, siguran sam da bi mi se tad mnogo dopalo...
Probat ƒáu i nastavak proƒçitat, jer za njega uglavnom ƒçitam dosta bolje kritike nego za Talisman.Dvojka od mene .
Usually a book isn't quite as magical on the second read, though with authors like King the rating normally stays the same as before.But here, I realize that I underestimated just what The Talisman did for me.
A Mark Twain boy's adventure even came to mind, blending with the Looking-Glass element of flipping back and forth between the pollution infested tired modern world and one of magical wonder.
And just flat out doing the right thing.Jack Sawyer grows up a lot in this book, much like Huck Finn, Frodo Baggins, and Harry Potter before him.
Yes, he goes on an adventure, like they did.
Stephen King is well-known for his work in the horror genre, but his fantasy works are even more impressive, as evident in this modern story with extraordinary themes.
All things fantasy - but this is not the book that makes you drop all inquisitions, unfortunately.Finally, the charachter of Wolf; I'm going to have to put this in (view spoiler)[I know lots of people loved this ambiguous character, I can't help but see Jar Jar Binks with large flapping ears most of the time: "Meesa Jar Jar!

When I first read "The Talisman" I was roughly the same age as, if not younger than, the 12-year-old protagonist, Jack Sawyer.
I figured, it's Stephen King AND Peter Straub, two really great writers of horror and dark fantasy, so at the very least it was going to be a good yarn.
"The Talisman" is more than just a good fantasy yarn.
It's a fantasy story that Tolkein or Lewis probably couldn't (or wouldn't) have told because it required the perspective of two writers who are used to staring into the dark and yanking the unpleasant (and slimy) things out of it.
