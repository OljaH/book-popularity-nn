I can’t remember the last time I felt this way about a book.
I’m making it sound like a sad book, aren’t I?
This is a book you want to read when you're feeling a little nostalgic and disconnected from the world.
Her characters came alive for me, they became living, breathing people with problems, quirks and a sense of humor.
Or Matt, a math geek with horrible T-shirts and a sense of humor that’s right up my alley?
Flat-Out Love completely changed my mind about self published books.I hope all of you will read it soon so we can gush about it together.
Buddy read with Kat (click to read her review), who saved my sanity (thanks for the support through this!!)But because my inner circle of doom rewards its members as they deserve, let's start with little awards, 'kay?
I'm really impressed.✘ Her conversations with Matt, the son of the family welcoming her in their house, are full of "witty" bullying and aggressive remarks the poor guy never deserved.
Well, she doesn't want to invite him to come along when she goes out because, well, duh, he's so freaking beneath her (can you please follow?) but she considers keeping an eye on his sister someday to give him the occasion to attend a party.
There was way too much yodeling in this book, but other than that, it's one of the best books I've read in this genre. I highly recommend it. I think Jessica Park is a very talented author. She writes good. Or is it well? (That's why I'm a reviewer and not an author.)
He was funny and a teaser sometimes.There is also Finn, the oldest brother.He is never around , he is always travelling through the world.Julie , adds him on facebook and they start chatting.She discovers that this guy is amazing.He is hot , adventurous , brave and smart.(view spoiler)[Who wouldnt fall for him??
(hide spoiler)]Well as the book was reaching the end I was thinking that there is nothing else that might happen.I didnt see that coming.I was kind of happy (view spoiler)[(I'm twisted I know,but no Finn means more Matt) (hide spoiler)] but mostly sad with the real story.That explained everything but they were lucky to have Julie with them .She helped them move on.["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>
When she arrives to find the apartment she thought she rented to be a total scam, her last resource is to call her mother's long lost college friend, Erin, to help her out and give her a temporary roof while she looks for a solution.This is how Julie meets the Watkins family: Erin and Roger, the academic and self-involved parents, Finn, the fascinating older brother on a backpacking tour around the world, Matt, the middle brother, a math and physics nerd with a fetish for smartass T-shirts and Celeste, the 13 year old quirky sister of the family.The Watkinses seem to be a regular enough family on the surface but Julie soon realizes that all is not well with these people's familial dynamics.
I wanted to stay with the Watkins and Julie forever, revel in their triumphs and help them to live, not just exist.
You wanted to get to the point where all was revealed, yet I wanted to the book to go on so that I could stay with the Watkins, especially Celeste and Matt.
Celeste will stay with me for a long time, I loved her as she was, through her transformation and healing.
At times I had tears running down my face and when Matthew spoke the words "Finn is dead", I knew it was coming, but all the same it took my breath away.
Nothing about this book is predictable Sniff. Just read the other glowing reviews because I’m at a loss for words. But should anyone see Ms Jessica -I’m going to break your heart then glue it back- Park, tell her readers have feelings too. Sniff.
*Original Review for the book 10/11*Flat-Out Love definitely falls more on the "girly" side, but I enjoyed it almost as much as I enjoyed Anna and the French Kiss.The story follows a girl named Julie who is swindled out of her money when she gets to Boston and finds out that the college apartment she had reserved does not exist.
Julie manages to take refuge in the emails and Facebook updates (some of which are completely funny) of the brother whose room she is staying in while he's off "traveling the globe." I don't blame her for falling for Finn, the human version of a cardboard cutout named "Flat Finn" that the little sister drags around because she's missing her brother.
Julie is the kind of person who will never be my friend if she existed in real life.Almost each chapter began with a Facebook status of each of the three leads, but more often than not these didn't even have anything to do with the story.
And they weren't even witty!And the supposed "twist" was so easy to figure out, it shouldn't even be considered as such.I don't want to waste my time finishing this book anymore.
I'm sure there are hundreds of other books out there more worthy of my time.
Why anyone would make another version of this insipid story is beyond me.
Julie is given Finn's room to stay in and she connects with him through Facebook and despite having never met him, feelings begin to develop for this charming, fun-loving and deeply caring guy that she just can't get out of her head.The characters in this book seemed so vivid.
I totally felt sucked into Julie's world - into the affection she feels for Matt and his charming yet geeky personality, to the acceptance she shows Celeste and her strong desire not to give up on helping her heal, and to the growing attraction that she feels for Finn - as she slowly falls in love with him over their online communication.
So, how do I put into words just how much I love this story and admire the talent and sheer genius of Jessica Park?I don't do plot summaries, as should be more than evident by now.
It's easy enough to read the summary and decide for yourself if this sounds like something that might interest you.
I will say, briefly, that this story is about a family's pain and absolutely essential emotional growth.
However, for all that this sounds like there could be no other option but for this story to be deep and dark and painful?
(This is an Adult-who-enjoys-reliving-the-stirrings-of-first-love-and-self-discovery-during-the-teen-years-through-YA books review ^_^)5 + Stars! Also reviewed at: Lady Jayne's Reading Den WOW. I FLAT-OUT LOVE this book by self-published author, Jessica Park!!!This quote sums up how this book made me feel, how it inspired me through my journey with it, and even after I reluctantly closed its pages... I’ve been struggling with my reading lately and I wanted a story that would really captivate me
I FLAT-OUT LOVE this book by self-published author, Jessica Park!!!This quote sums up how this book made me feel, how it inspired me through my journey with it, and even after I reluctantly closed its pages...
Thank you, Jessica Park!I loved it so much I bought the paperback.Whether you’re a reader, like me, who feels you know what’s going on from the first few chapters yet keep hoping it’s not true, or a reader who is taken by surprise, at the end, one thing is for sure, even if you think you know what’s going on, I believe you will be captivated by this story, its characters, and staying up late to finish it.
*5 Stars!*Flat Out Love was such a beautiful, touching, and heartfelt story that left me sorting out my feelings for days before I could properly sum them up.
I won't go into details over plot, as there is an extreme twist that I would hate to reveal, but I will say that I loved every little bit of this unique story!
The characters were lovable and life-like, and I fully enjoyed their witty back-and-forth banter and charming dialogue.
(I must add that this in no way hindered my love for this story.) Celeste, who is quite possibly the most unique character from any book I've ever read, was the major exception.
Never, in a million years, will I read this book.
In weniger als 24 Stunden verschlungen, das ist mir auch schon lange nicht mehr passiert und das ganze obwohl ich grad noch mitten in der Prüfungsphase in der Uni stecke.
Allein daran lässt sich schon erkennen wie gut mir das Buch gefallen hat.
Ich fand die Geschichte einfach so niedlich und auch einfach berührend.
Der Schreibstil war dem ganzen auch angemessen und lies sich flott lesen.
Auch die Charaktere mochte ich alle furchtbar gern und das Ende hat mich dann auch noch zu Tränen gerührt.
Eine wirklich empfehlenswerte Geschichte, die mehr Tiefgang hat, als es zu Anfang scheint.
★★★★★ 5 stars★★★★★"I don't want this to end.
I don't want to land and reach the real world, because I like our world up here better.” This book,is one of those many fabulous books,with story-lines that stick with you for a life time.The best thing about this book was that the characters are so  uniquely damaged.Even with all their tortured past and bizarre habits,I loved how the characters managed to pass off as fun and quirky.More like in a Alice-in-wonderland style.I loved how the author,Jessica park,actually managed to build a story around such volatile situations and craziness while managing on keeping the reader captivated and intrigued until the end.
It might just end up being a favorite :)P.S: WATCH OUT for the huge PLOT-Twist !
I’m incredibly happy about this because even though I like Julie and her sense of humor the two/three characters I liked in the book were Matt, Celeste and Flat Finn.Matt reminds me of my favorite Beta Boy ever Seth from the Georgina Kinkaid series.
Julie has an interesting first year at college and she really bonds with Celeste and is able to help her get over her attachment to Flat Finn a few baby steps at a time.
**spoiler free review**HOLY CRAP I LOVED THIS BOOK!I did not expect for this book to so thoroughly blow my mind.
I feel like this review should be very witty because the book is so smartly written.
The family consists of two absentee parents, both professors, a geeky brother (Matt) in his early 20s, an odd teenage sister (Celeste), and an even older brother (Finn) who has been traveling abroad for the past couple of years.
Julie ends up emailing and facebooking Finn to ask about Celeste's mental state and, over time, something more than online friendship ensues.
like Julie's constant comments about Matt's shirts, the facebook messages, Celeste's vocabulary, and best of all "Flat Finn".
I think the funniest was when Julie was trying to take Flat Finn grocery shopping.
Julie is intelligent, quick-witted and wants to help Celeste.
I felt like I was reading about my hubby.
There is a bittersweet ending to this story.I think everyone should give this book a chance.
It will make you believe that while nothing in life comes easy, all of your hardwork will pay off in the end.I also want to thank my goodreads friend, Lisa.
Cue Erin, an old friend of her mother’s, who stepped in, via her son Matt, to rescue Julie and gave her a roof over her head.
So at this point I was guessing this was going to be a romance about Julie and Matt, right?
Julie, this is Flat Finn.”
Julie, this is Flat Finn.”
For reasons Julie couldn’t pull from Erin, Roger or Matt, Celeste was enabled.In some ways, this had a very “Lars and the Real Girl” feel to it.
I've never had my nails painted."Julie turned around and glared at Flat Finn.
Wait for me while i catch my breath..(minutes passing, hours passing, days passing...) Ok, here we go, but I don't promise that my review will make much sense to you.So I'll start by saying that I really need to read this book again!My Thoughts:This book took me completely by surprise.It seemed like a really light read, but in fact it is the complete opposite. I guess that these days I'm really easy to trick, but I love surprises, and I love how this story turned out.Think about it this way:Imag
She offers you shelter for as long as you need it and she takes care of you.You like this family.The father is nice, but he works just too much and travels for too long.The boy (Matt) is a bit older than you, but cute, funny, and helpful.
He is spending too much time taking care of this family and you think that he needs more time for himself, his friends, even a girlfriend.
You talk to him via facebook (don't you dare rolling your eyes, I know that you keep in touch with friends and family via facebook as well.
Ugh. Honestly the book was pretty good but I just can't handle contemporaries (only rarely) and ESPECIALLY ones that deal with heartbreaking issues like these.
I'm just dealing with too many issues in my own life with health/etc and I just can't handle books like these very well.
They are too real/hit too close to home - where as fantasies are just easier for me to bear even when they have sad themes.Ignore my rating, because I really don't know what to rate this.
I went into this expecting something more 'fun' like 'The Hating Game' - and this is just down right depressing.
This is the forth book I have read from Jessica Park. It is safe to say that she is now on my favorite authors list. You can always count on her to sucker-punch you right in the feels. And you know that I'm all about that angst. She likes to take her readers on an emotional rollercoaster ride. She starts us at the very bottom so that the only other direction we can go is down. Trust me, your heart will plummet. Your stomach will drop. And tears may fall.  So we've pulled the chute, and we're dri
There were so many questions and I couldn't get the answers fast enough.I felt so connected to Julie, like I mentioned earlier, that I too fell for Finn.
She really wants to help Celeste as she feels like her family is enabling her problems.
Julie gets more than she bargains for as she ends up falling for the estranged brother.
That's when Julie started to realize that there is something going on with Finn as well.
I have read many reviews stating that they guessed the twist early on in the book.
The bad reviews are the ones that didn't finish the book.
I think the reason this book wasn't all there for me was because of the puppy type love.
Julie's charater was the type of character trying to fix other people's problems because she hasn't fixed her own.
I did feel Celeste, Matt, "Finn", and Julie were all main characters.
So Celeste wasn't a supporting character but a main one and although I liked that it was a bad thing to do In a romance book.
Finding out that Finn was dead and Matt was the one writing chats to Julie under his dead brothers facebook.
So basically Julie fell in love with Matt not Finn.
However, if you are looking for a main stream romance with more depth than average, then I think that you should give this a chance.Julie is eighteen years old, leaving her middle class Ohio life behind for the first time, and heading off to a small college in Boston.
Her mother recalls an old college roommate who lives in Boston, and within an incredibly short amount of time Julie is installed with the Watkins family.
Therapy that involves introducing Celeste to mini-skirts, Seventeen magazine, top 40 songs, and make up; ridiculing Matt for his nerdy t-shirts and online debates; and setting him up on dates with her friends, because she “wouldn’t be caught dead” with him at a party.
The writing flowed realistically throughout with brilliant character development and the, OMG, knock-you-to-your-knees lovestory was undeniable!When Julie realizes her "Craig's-List" apartment is really a burrito stand, she's desperate and as luck would have it, her mother's old college roommate, Erin Watkins, fortunately invites her to move in.
(Which are mostly HILAIROUS and sometimes quite moving and sweet.) Before long, through late-night exchanges, Julie becomes aware that her feelings for Finn are beyond a friendly "IM-ing" chat sesson.
But...something isn't "right" with this family and Julie evetually forces a buried secret to the surface, causing a dramatic confrontation that threatens to tear the fragile Watkins family apart...
Great story. I would have probably enjoyed it more if I hadn't figured out the "twist" by chapter three. If you haven't read it then stay away from reviews. I read several reviews and because of that I just KNEW what was going to happen once Flat Finn made his appearance.
Although there is romance, Jessica Park’s contemporary YA novel for me was more about the love of a family, and the lengths people will go to, to help the ones they love.If you do work out the twist from the beginning of Flat-Out Love, I promise you it won’t detract from your enjoyment of the story.
The heroine Julie is a likeable college Freshman who descends on Boston (I always wanted to go to Boston, now I’m frickin’ antsy after Park’s wonderful descriptions) and a super intelligent family to turn their lives upside down.
The best thing about Julie is her genuine likeability – she has a huge heart and an absolutely insane sense of humour that I loved.
Nobody's perfect; in fact, they're quite dysfunctional: Erica at first seems great, but then you find out that (view spoiler)[ she's very depressed and pretty much ignores all of her kids, even to a fault  (hide spoiler)] Roger, the dad, is always gone due to his job and is non-supportive because of the secret (yes it's very infuriating; you're supposed to feel that way, but it's all part of Park's grand master plan, so hang with it) Matt tries to help his sister the best he can, but his protectiveness is smothering and he's on the computer excessively, and Celeste, well, I can't even describe her on here; her character has just  so  many layers to it any description that I would try to use wouldn't do her justice; which is just another reason why you should pick up this book.
God awful, bratty BBA, who thinks "friendship" means attacking people for not liking your friend's horrendous abuse book.This author and her little friend Jamie McGuire find it fun to gang up on people who had the audacity to not like their books.
So they troll Amazon and tag team negative reviewers of their books.
Some links.Even Dear Author mentions her behavior.But that doesn't stop her.
No, to prove that Goodreads users are awful for saying that she attacks reviewers, she, well, no surprise here.
And a screeencap, because of course she deleted it.This is being deleted in a day anyway, might as well let you people know.
I feel like i'm being forced to downgrade my rating of Flat-Out Love because of this bad behavior and it's very frustrating.
My hope is that Ms. Park can change her ways because I enjoyed her book and recommended it to many friends.Original Review November 2012**Giggle like a school girl**4.5 stars...
I was hooked from page one and read this book in a day.
Even though it was a young adult book the 'smartness' shined through the pages and had me happy that nerds were proudly flying their 'nerd flag.'So, grab a copy of Flat-Out Love and join in all the fun.
I found this book boring. Nothing really happened and the mystery (?) was way too obvious. The humor and witty dialogue were really forced, and all the characters had the same personality.It's alright for a self-published book though. Just so boring.
Zwei Drittel des Buches dachte ich mir: Okay ganz nett. Aber dann, im letzten Drittel passierte auf einmal so viel und ich war unglaublich froh, dass ich dem Buch eine Chance gegeben hatte.Es gab nichts mehr, was mich gestört hätte. Ganz im Gegenteil, die letzten Seiten waren richtig toll. Für die teilweise extrem witzigen Dialoge und die Entwicklung am Schluss würde ich fünf Sterne vergeben.
My Casting: Finn, Julie & Matt4 STARSOk, I imagine this is going to be a little difficult to write without spoilers, but let's see how we go.
I have so many books on my Kindle that I haven't read, so I'm trying to make my way through some of them, rather than just reading the newest releases all the time.
And secondly, I'm so disappointed at the lack of Matt and Julie.I'm really, really struggling with what to write here, so that I can give you a feel for the book, but I don't give anything away.
It has witty, intelligent humor, quirky, lovable characters, a very swoon worthy romance, and a mystery!Julie Seagle has just moved to Boston as a freshman starting college but the apartment she rented in advance turns out to be a sham and Julie has nowhere to go.
No one will tell Julie why Celeste must take “Flat Finn” everywhere but she knows that something traumatic has happened.
Matt, or Matty also becomes an important friend to Julie, always there to pick her up when she needs help.
It totally gripped me in this really interesting way, and I hope that my descriptions can do it justice.What I really loved about this book is that it is the perfect mix of family issues and love and romance.
Julie, our main character, is lovely.
In fact, all of the main characters felt real to me.
Like I said, this is also a story about a family and their issues.
The romance was quiet but lovely, and the family drama was always there, whether it be in the foreground or background.
After having this on hold for several months, I think I can now safely say I will never finish it. I simply cannot sympathise with a heroine who thinks so lowly of others because of their style of clothing, especially if they are so very nice to her. As a lot of my friends loved this book, though, I always wanted to get back to it and try again.But franky speaking, I am not inclined to give an author who posts stuff like this on the internet a second chance.
📚”Eee... beni görmek isteyen sadece Celeste mi?”“Bütün ailen istiyor.”“Sadece bütün ailem mi?”“Seni çok özleyen kız arkadaşın da istiyordur herhalde?”“Belki.”Julie duraksadı. Bu ihtimali daha önce düşünmemişti ama nedense, Finn’in bir kız arkadaşı olması fikri hiç hoşuna gitmiyordu. Yani kıskanmaya hakkı yoktu. Ama kıskanmıştı.“Ama kız arkadaşım yok. Demek ki gelmemi sadece çılgın ailem istiyor. Hayal kırıklığına uğradığımı itiraf ediyorum.”Julie’nin ağzı kulaklarına vardı.“Ziyarete gelecek olu
beni görmek isteyen sadece Celeste mi?”“Bütün ailen istiyor.”“Sadece bütün ailem mi?”“Seni çok özleyen kız arkadaşın da istiyordur herhalde?”“Belki.”Julie duraksadı.
Bu ihtimali daha önce düşünmemişti ama nedense, Finn’in bir kız arkadaşı olması fikri hiç hoşuna gitmiyordu.
Karakterlerin yaşları 18-20 aralığında olsa da kendilerini o kadar çok sevdirdiler ki yaşlarını gözüm görmedi.Julie kısa bir süredir tanıdığı ama değer verdiği insanlara yardım etmeye çalışmasıyla, cesareti ve zekasıyla beğendiğim bir karakterdi.
Genç yaşına rağmen bir sürü sorumluluk almış olması, Celeste için yaptıkları hoşuma gitti.
Belki gözümün önündekini görmek istemedim çünkü aramızdaki bağın gerçek olmasını her şeyden çok istiyordum.
The writing is sharp and quietly quirky and the characters are really quite different to any I have come across in YA recently.It's hard for me to think of comp books for Flat-out love as it really was rather unique (not only in plot, but also in writing style).
Things like that always seem to niggle at me ~ and even though when everything finally unravels (in the last 10%) it all makes logical and perfect sense in the new context, I still spent the majority of my reading time with the book feeling slightly irked.
Bugüne dek kitabın yüzüne bile bakmayışımın tek nedeni tamamen ismi yüzündendi. Öyle ki yine nefret ettiğim vıcık vıcık hikayelerden biriyle karşılaşacağımı düşünmüştüm, yanılmışım hemde ne yanılmak!Kitapta tanıştığım insanlar; mizah anlayışı, naifliği, sevecenliğiyle en sevdiğim kitap karakterleri arasında yer edindi bile.Benim gibi düşünüp okumayı erteleyen ya da reddeden varsa şans versin derim. Gerçekten çok beğendim. :')
I know this will sound cheesy, but Flat-Out Love is the first book in a long, long time that has touched me this deeply.
I could relate to so many aspects of this book.
yes at times I wanted to knock her across the back of the head.
What I loved about her was her attitude.
Smart, adorable, annoying (in the good way), I just wanted to take her home to be my little sister.
This is a story about love and loss, family and tragedy and I loved every aspect of it.P.S.Thank you Sandy for this amazing recommendation!
Flat Out Love was smart, romantic, sweet, sad, angsty and extremely FUNNY.
I was totally sucked into Julie's world, She was sweet, smart, kind and funny.
I loved Matt and Julie’s witty back and forth banters, Celeste’s adorable yet highly intellectual nature, Finn’s flirty emails, Facebook updates, and Flat Finn!The entire story was surrounded by this big family secret that leads to a twist in the end which I did not see it coming!!
(view spoiler)[ I was always rooting for Matt and Julie to end up together so when I got know Finn was infact Matt!
I loved this book.I had rated it but not reviewed it which I didn't feel had done it justice.This book contained some of the most wonderfully crafted characters you could meet.Loved the FB status updates!
They had me giggling out loud at times.Matt was just adorable and you instantly warm to him.
I loved his quirky sense of humour.I read this in on sitting and what a great read it was.
I went through a lot of emotions from laughing to crying and enjoyed this book immensely.This author definitely has a way of delivering a story and I can't wait to read more from her.
What happened to me after reading this book? I become freaking emotional with happiness, and in my corner of my heart there was sadness too!  Matt, ooo Matty, he is such geek and nerd. Always buried himself under that computer and his research! *inhales, sounds like me too*And enters my darling Julie......Julie is stranded in Boston after being cheated by landlord for his college accommodation and her mother's mate coming to rescue...BAM, enter's Matt to rescue!

What mystery lays behind?
Well, you have read it to find out!
Happy reading!
Julie moves in with the Watkins family and it's very apparent that something had happened but no one will say anything.
There's an ongoing interesting part with Facebook status updates; Julie's, Matt's (Celeste and Finn's brother) and Finn's.
I really enjoyed the relationships Julie built with the rest of the family members, especially Matt, Finn and Celeste.
Finn and all his adventures were so interesting but I loved how he was so thoughtful with everyone.
I especially loved how he helped Julie in the elevator!I think this was a very intriguing story and you can't help but feel for this family.
