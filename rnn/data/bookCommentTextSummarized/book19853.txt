My good friend Stephanie points out that being in the middle of a war certainly adds an additional element in such meetings, but  (hide spoiler)] I would like to have seen more time given to any possible number of layers to a relationship, including admiration for how the person behaves in an extraordinary way, noticing subtle and lovely details about someone's personality, uncovering meaning in someone's words, bonding over shared situations, etc, etc.
It's lyrics go something like this:I'm a pretty little girl who knows nothing about literatureSo I sing a song about starcrossed loversWhose only problem is that Daddy doesn't approveBut it's all good because we get married anyway.Just like that cliffnote's story about Romeo and Juliet!Yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeyyyyy!We have a tendency with YA literature today, to have stories with the super duper happiest of happy endings where everything works out and true love's only real complications are external difficulties, and self-esteem issues for the girl.I'm trying to think of the perfect example here and because this review is full of cheap shots at easy targets I'm going to go with...TWILIGHT!Come on down, Bella and Edward!Now, don't get me wrong.
That's  what I like to call a true author.One night while I was reading this book, I was laying in my bed thinking about the plot, characters, and what Taylor's overall theme ( because, you know, that's what cool people do at night; think about the books that they just read) and it all of a sudden hit me: This book is everything Lauren Kate tried to do in her Fallen series, and failed.
The first thing that I'll talk about in this review that Taylor pulled off about a million times better than what Kate wrote was with Akiva; the main love interest in this story.
Once upon a time, an angel and a devil fell in love. It did not end well. Daughter of Smoke and Bone tells the age-old tale of forbidden love with a beautifully constructed mythological twist. Karou and Akiva are a Romeo and Juliet unlike any other and Laini Taylor has managed to encapture love, loneliness and desperation in a masterpiece of a novel that deserves to be read by anyone of any age who truly appreciates quality writing and story-telling.Karou is a 17 year old art student living in
Karou and Akiva are a Romeo and Juliet unlike any other and Laini Taylor has managed to encapture love, loneliness and desperation in a masterpiece of a novel that deserves to be read by anyone of any age who truly appreciates quality writing and story-telling.Karou is a 17 year old art student living in Prague.
then one day she runs into the angelic Akiva, who not only makes her question where she belongs but who and what she actually is.Laini Taylor, unlike numerous young adult authors, never patronises her readers and writes with a magical flair and sophistication that is a true rarity.
As seen on The ReadventurerWhen I first heard the details of the premise of Laini Taylor's new book, for a moment I thought Laini must have read my review of Personal Demons.
What happens next is best described by the book's own first lines:Once upon a time,an angel and a devil fell in love.It did not end well.There is nothing cliche about this story, trust me.
We all have read our measure of angel books and you will probably agree with me that the portrayal of angels in them rarely goes beyond wings, sexiness and some dark secret behind the "fall." But what if angels and demons are not what is traditionally/biblically accepted?
Ooh. OOOH! Meh... Mehhhhhhhhh...........Which basically summarizes my reaction throughout the novel. I hate it when things like this happen, when books start out so strong with an intriguing world and a growing character. But before you know it, it goes splat into a big mud puddle of Cliche and Predictability and WowThisRemindsMeOf100OtherYABooks.  The Ooh. The book started out very, very strong. The premise was very interesting: Karou, an orphaned human girl adopted by demon magicians, is sent
The premise was very interesting: Karou, an orphaned human girl adopted by demon magicians, is sent out on missions to collect teeth.
This poses a serious problem since Karou is only able to reach her demon foster parents, her only family, through those doors, and these scorch marks effectively "shut them down" so that they don't function as portals from point A to point B.
But it doesn't matter because from this point on, every single plot twist was predictable, including but not limited to:(1) Why Akiva is attracted to Karou(2) Why Karou is attracted to Akiva(3) What the teeth are for(4) What happened to Karou's foster demon parentsI expected a bit more from this novel.
Laini Taylor's writing flows across the page to the point where instead of skipping across paragraphs as I usually do, I was hanging on her every word.
Laini Taylor infuses her with a quiet inner strength, yet also a loneliness and a desire for love.
Akiva is a good character, although he isn't a strong love for me yet.
THE ROMANCEI feel like I should give this book four stars.
Or maybe it's just Laini Taylor's writing, or the strength of Akiva and Karou's characters.
Again, I can't expand upon that, because the worldbuilding isn't revealed until later in the book.
4.5/5The writing was mysterious and lovely and I really enjoyed this! Because of how mysterious it is, I'm really glad that I went into it knowing nothing. I was sufficiently confused for the better part of this book, but very intrigued, so it was more like putting together a puzzle than trying to run around blindfolded. I think the world is so original and I'm ready to see where this story goes! (Also, YAY for no insta-love!)
It did not end well.” ____________________________________________You can find the full review and more about this book on my blog!Freaking amazing book.I didn't expect this to be this good.I couldn't put the book down,like literally.Everything fits perfectly ,the characters ,the story,everything.It is so unique and different from other stories.And it's actually the first book written in third person that I enjoyed because I'm not a fan of third person books.____________________________________________“Have you ever asked yourself, do monsters make war, or does war make monsters?”____________________________________________The writing style was beyond perfect.It's uniqueness is what makes this book so special.The way words cling together...amazing.I must say I was confused at some parts because the English that is used in this book is quite difficult to understand and there were a lot of words I didn't get but that didn't stop me from truly adoring this book from page one to the last.____________________________________________“It is a condition of monsters that they do not perceive themselves as such.
Wow. Just Wow. I got an ARC of this one about a month ago, and only just now got around to reading it. I really liked Laini's first Dreamdark book, so I was eager to try this one. It was great. Really great. Read it all in a day. Wow.
4.5 stars? 4.75 stars?! It's been a while since I've started a new series and been this head over heels. My gut says I can't quite give it 5 stars for a few verrrry minor reasons but I may change my mind the more I think (*obsess*) about this book. Full review and gush to come on my channel!
This book did not piss me off! I'm ELATED. I forgot the entire story, though. So I may read it again because I want to finish the entire series.
I first stumbled across Laini Taylor when I was encouraged by several of my GoodReader friends to read Lips Touch.
Here, let me simplify it for you:Laini Taylor..........................blew.......................................my .................................................mind...............................................................
Okay, so maybe she's not so "ordinary." But one day, while running one of her "errands," she runs into a mysterious stranger named Akiva who attacks her.
As with the first time I read a Laini Taylor novel, I had to get adjusted to her unique writing style.
The first half of the book is so full of mystery it will have you begging for answers and Taylor does not disappoint.
First re-read May 2017!OMG! I loved this book so much! I am so in love with Akiva! The below picture was the best I could find that is sort of what I picture. It doesn't have his amazing black shadow fire wings or the longish black hair that I imagine, but who cares =)  Once upon a time, a little girl was raised by monsters. But angels burned the doorways to their world, and she was all alone.  I love Karou's character. She's got blue hair, she can draw, she has a best friend named, Zuzana. She'
Karou has no idea what she truly is, she just lives in her human world but was raised by chimaera.
He raised her, she does horrible things for him, and they love each other.
I didn't like some of the things that were in the book that she had to do but the author writes it in such a way that is shows these thing are NOT okay in the real world.
=) There are some other creature things that live with Brimstone and Karou, well like I said, Karou is old enough to be out on her own.
And I would really like Akiva and Karou to be in love forever!
Regardless, I greatly urge anyone who has even the slightest interest in this book to procure a copy when it's released on September 27, 2011.Seven Perfect Reasons Why You Should Read Daughter of Smoke and Bone by Laini Taylor:1.
Now, I loved Laini Taylor's first young adult offering, Lips Touch: Three Times (You've read it, haven't you?
Think again.True to form, Laini Taylor – an obvious lover of lore and mythology from all cultures, given the tales of Lips Touch – offers a fascinating new spin on angels and demons.
You know that feeling of never wanting a book to end?
never mind that isn't not going to be published for three more months (thank you to the girl with BEA access for getting this for me), it should have happened somehow.this is the most pure example of fantasy that i have seen so far.
and my only quibble - the only thing that is keeping this from being "best book ever" is so stupid, but i just felt that the pacing was a little bit skewed.
these was so much in the first half, so much slowly spooled out story of "mysterious girl in prague" and then by the end, it was so rapidly told: angels, demons, war, love, betrayal,blam blam blammo!!
ive always had the opinion that the whole paranormal urban fantasy genre is just not for me, no thank you.
reading and liking this book made me feel like im finally reaching my full potential as a person.
what i enjoyed most was probably the setting - i dont think ive ever read a book that was set in prague or marrakech, both of which are cities that i adore!
the story does end on a cliffhanger, but i actually thought it was perfectly executed and really worked in convincing me to read the next book.
4.25/5 stars  Once upon a time, an angel and a devil fell in love. It did not end well.  In case you didn't know: the greatest feeling in the world, as proven by actual scientists and not some 19-year old girl laying braless in bed, is when you reread a book you loved the first time around and love it even more the second time. That sense of euphoria that will rush over you once you realize that your memory did not deceive you and everything you think you know might possibly not be wrong is cons
In case you didn't know: the greatest feeling in the world, as proven by actual scientists and not some 19-year old girl laying braless in bed, is when you reread a book you loved the first time around and love it even more the second time.
probably give.• blue hair but, like, grows that way.
The second time, it's kinda understandable (view spoiler)[as technically they are already in love with each other but KAROU HAS NO MEMORY OF HER LIFE AS MADRIGAADSAL AND ANGEL DUDE DOESN'T KNOW IT'S HER (hide spoiler)], but not enough where I can shrug it off.
Even though a huge number of people I know seems to consider DoSaB the best thing since sliced bread, I couldn't have liked it less even it I tried.And, trust me, I tried.
Instead of making me feel something, it just left me bored and annoyed, and eager to either get drunk on cough syrup or punch someone in the teeth.
I liked the premise and all the mystery surrounding the chimaeras and the teeth affair, but something spoiled it.
But unlike all the rest, this one is the real thing.It’s times like these that I wish I was a real, honest to goodness book fairy, with little wings, a wand, a tutu, and magical powers of course.
(And after reading this book, the question really begs to be asked: what are you doing with all of those teeth, tooth fairy?
She’s a little eccentric, a little odd, but her classmates don’t ask too many questions, and Karou has perfected the art of the non-answer.
Still, Daughter of Smoke and Bone managed to captivate me and convince me to forgive its flaws by making its kickass protagonist, Karou, the girl who I hope my future (hypothetical) daughter will hang out with.I love that Daughter of Smoke and Bone avoided the easy and tempting pitfall of presenting the heroine as an ordinary unremarkable girl, a blank slate ready for readers' self-insertion, little else but a plot device to make the reader fulfill the desire of experiencing a relationship with an attractive mysterious male love interest.
I’d call it transitional urban fantasy because, while the groundwork is crafted in the very human, albeit magical in its own right, city of Prague, Laini does set up the stage for the expansion of the story to take place in an entirely other world, which I shall TRY to not spoil for you.
Rather, it’s of Romeo & Juliet-esque quality (even though I could go on a tangent as to why that isn’t a good love story, but that’s a topic for another day).
Ok, fine…The story begins with an azure-haired and tattooed, 17-year-old girl by the name of Karou.She attends an art school in Prague with her best friend, the “Rabid Faery”, Zuzana.
Well, in Daughter of Smoke & Bone, Laini Taylor treats all the myths like they’re Athena—sprung fully formed from the head of Zeus.
Daughter of Smoke & Bone hits you straight in the feels, and you love every second of it, want more of it, are devastated when it ends.So it’s a good thing Dreams of Gods & Monsters, the third (and final?) installment of this series will be released in only a few short weeks.
Dreams of Gods & Monsters (Daughter of Smoke & Bone #3)
I haven't read a book that lives up to the hype this well, actually, since Hunger Games.
And no, I'm not comparing this to Hunger Games in any way, just sayin'.This book came highly recommended to me from a number of people.
You will feel as if you have escaped to Prague and you are walking the streets and having lunch with Karou and her best friend, Zuzana.The plot was great too.
The writing is complex compared to many other YA books offered, and you will need to pay attention to keep up with it.Recommended!I really can't wait for the next one.
This is the kind of book people should be shoving in my face to read (for future reference pleeeease).Basic plot stuff: Karou is an art student who has blue hair, eye tattoos on her hands, and no idea where she's from or who she really is.
It started to feel like a bunch of smaller disjointed plot arcs when Karou's present-day story became background material in the second half.So I was more into the magical Pan's Labyrinth-type aesthetic of both worlds than the star-crossed romance, but none of these minor complaints really hurt the story in the end!
STARTING THE SECOND ONE RIGHT NOW BECAUSE THAT ENDING WAS TOO MUCH I LOVED IT
OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOH.I really liked this book, and I wasn't even expecting it!
the first piece of work I read from Laini Taylor was her short story in "My true love gave to me twelve holiday stories", and I didn't like it, at all.
The thing I loved the most about this book is the world Laini created!
I love everything about the wishes and the teeth and Brimstone's shop!
Fantastic!The one thing I didn't like was the total insta-love, I was enjoying the book so much and then BAM!
I WAS LIKE: PLEASE DON'T.
*thinks about it* No, not kind of, It REALLY explains the insta-love.
I had so many ups and downs reading this book, ranging from pages and pages and pages of complete disinterest in the beginning, to complete enjoyment in the new type of fantasy world described, to utter boredom in the flashback scenes. Yeah, I know the backstory of Madrigal's past life is a big deal in the scheme of the book. That doesn't mean I didn't find it incredibly boring.
The ending! There are already many, many in-depth and detailed reviews for Daughter of Smoke and Bone, and because no one wants to read a review where I gush on and on about how much I loved this or adored that, I'll avoid being boring and keep this short and simple.I loved:1. Karou2. Akiva. 3. The writing. 4. The setting.5. Karou.6. The book title.7. Zuzana. 8. Akiva and Karou's love. 9. Brimstone.10. The chapter titles.I disliked:1. The cover. 2. Kaz.3. Madrigal.4.

8. Akiva and Karou's love.
(view spoiler)[The fact that Karou is Madrigal.
With how little of Karou and how much of Madrigal there was at the end, I'm feeling as if the former simply isn't an individual any longer, and all along she's only been the latter.
She had a sadness that was so deep, but it still could turn to light in a second, and when I saw her smile I wondered what it would be like to make her smile.
I thought… I thought it would be like the discovery of smiling."Once upon a time, an angel and a devil fell in love.
Loved and loving these creatures that one would cringe away from made me see and admire a whole other side of her - a side I could get used to, but it's when the romantic interest made his appearance that things started going a little downhill.A part of me is quite impressed by the characters and plot.
Sure we've seen the creatures before, the romeo and Juliet styled love interest, but the author has managed to interweave all these aspects in the novel and make it all somehow completely unique and turn it into her own.
I felt like the book had so much potential that it didn't even need to make this apparent transition on solely focusing on the romance.
