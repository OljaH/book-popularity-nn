The writing was drier than a cracker in the desert...But I loved the book anyway! It definitely reads like a scientific/army report but this was such an interesting twist on the classic sci-fi (first contact?). I only recommend it if you already love sci-fi and diseases apocalyptic books.Left me wanting more... I'll definitely read more from the author!
But whereas Weir stepped it down for the rest of us with some laugh out loud humor, the good Dr. Crichton put his best bedside manner forward and patiently explained his biological horror story in a way that – made it scarier.Like a Jonathon Edwards sermon, his straight man delivery creates a technical tension that informs as it terrorizes.True, some of the overly technical sections dragged and I recalled moments from HS when I daydreamed the lecture away; but Crichton never let his lesson stray too far from the subject at hand – scaring the Heeby Jeebies out of us.Scared to death.That’s an actual line from the book and describes one of the hero scientists’ attempts to come to grips with what was going on.
liked the beginning, thought the end was unbelievably anticlimatic.

This book is a good example that sometimes the rating that one gives to one book isn't fault itself 
There's a good story in here, somewhere. If Crichton tackled this idea later in his career it would have undoubtedly been a great book. There's just far too much science and not enough thriller.
The sixth novel by Michael Crichton but the first published (in 1969) under his own name and the first in which he bent science fiction and suspense together in ways that would propel Crichton to the top of the bestseller lists and into cinemas for the next thirty years, The Andromeda Strain didn't retain many surprises for me, but in its own delightful way, reminded me of a science and technology museum exhibit and the docent giving me a tour: "And here we have a pioneering thriller of technology run amok, where mankind's hubris unleashes terror from a top secret laboratory which only white men can stop.
As with most entertainment, this book pulls you in by asking some questions.
"What is it?" "How does it work?" "What happened?" While those questions are still being asked, this book is a fairly thrilling read.If you don't like books that get too technical about things, though, this isn't the book for you.
For the most part, the book lacks a main protagonist.
Even the best candidate for main protagonist isn't given too much to do, and when he is, it's forced.
I guess this book works because of the fear of the unknown.
Last night Trish and I watched the 1971 Robert Wise movie.
And while I did like it better than the first time round, I still prefer Crichton's book.This might be due for a re-read and a proper review in 2019.In short, a returning space probe brings something with it that instantly kills almost all the people in the small town nearest to the landing site.
And why are there two survivors?A team of scientists is put into the Wildfire installation, a zero contaminant facility that's buried in the Nevada desert, and are tasked with sciencing the shit out of it.Can they do it?If you think about picking this up, be prepared for a lot of science and a lot of scary.The book: 4.5 starsThe movie: 7/10
1971 movie posterThe Andromeda Strain is a medical/techno/thriller though it is also sci-fi in the sense that it involves an organism from outer space, not to mention various gadgets that seem to be ahead of their time.
(hide spoiler)].As mentioned earlier, this is the book that put  Michael Crichton on the map, by the time he published  Jurassic Park he is practically his own continent.
For the general reader, this is an immensely readable and gripping little novel.Quotes:“These considerations lead me to believe that the first human interaction with extraterrestrial life will consist of contact with organisms similar to, if not identical to, earth bacteria or viruses.
I'm not sure if this book is a 4 or 5, but I think I liked it more on second reading. It is really engaging, heavy on the science, which for the most part, great added to the authenticity of the novel.

Perhaps I'm influenced too much by my nostalgic love of the feel of '70's and '80's sci-fi and horror, but I did enjoy this. I'd watched the old movie many years ago, so there were no surprises, but I enjoyed it anyway. It helps that I read this as a real possible event as well, as I think it's highly possible that it will happen (or has already). Great classic sci-fi, in my opinion.
3 stars.
I’m sure in 1969 this was cutting edge, but it doesn’t quite stack up in 2018, either in terms of suspense, science, or inclusivity.
This book fails the Bechdel test so hard, it reminds me of why the Bechdel test was invented.
The only women I can remember are a switchboard operator, a nurse, and a (literally, I can't make this up) recorded voice that is described as sensual, almost sexy, UNTIL the male hearer realizes it belongs to a woman in her sixties, at which point he presumably loses interest.
Ugh.Still intriguing though!
Read so I could thoroughly immerse myself in the Jurassic Park series.
This was probably one of the first science fiction books I ever read, and so far the only book by Crichton. My rating is based on my reaction over three decades ago -- I seem to recall there were some parts that felt awkward, like they were written by someone trying to leap across the so-called "generation gap". But my teen self loved the book, so it gets the five stars. I have no idea whether I'd still feel as generous if I were to re-read it, but then I seldom re-read books anyway.The movie was pretty good too.
I probably first read “The Andromeda Strain” when I was about 12 years old.
I have seen the book labeled as a “techno-thriller,” but make no mistake, “The Andromeda Strain” is pure science-fiction.
Crichton’s experience and gravitas in biology and medicine give “The Andromeda Strain” a serious air of authenticity, with solid science to propel the events of the plot along.The basic story itself is easy to summarize.
“The Andromeda Strain” is quite simply one of the best examples of what hard science-fiction can be when an author has respect for their audience.
This is a review of the audiobook.
I first read The Andromeda Strain way back when I was about 12 years old or so.
Back then the YA genre wasn't available for us precocious readers so we graduated from Nancy Drew straight to Stephen King, Micheal Crichton and the like.
There is nothing scarier than something we cannot see.
Add in some alien elements and it becomes even scarier.
Alien virus from outer space - freaky.
The audio version was not as good as the book, nor was it as good as the movie from what I recall.
At least 4.25 stars, IMO. Great story format, superb writing, lots of character developments, yet still interesting enough to keep me on the book the whole time, even the background info of each scientist. To top it off. an excellent audio performance just make the whole experience the more exciting.
The cover and use of the galaxy name Andromeda in the book draws Sci-fi readers towards it definitely.
For instance, when Leavitt was thinking about ways to look at the organism he thought of a man and a house.
He thought maybe the part of the organism they were looking at, was part of a much bigger picture.
I found the moments where thinking like this came through as very interesting and very appliable if you will to studies of foreign organisms today.This book is a very good representation of exactly how things can go wrong in what looks like to be such neat and controlled situation.
I read The Andromeda Strain back in my youth and had fond memories of it.
I'm not exactly sure from where the fond memories came.
On the positive side, there are few female characters so Crichton's misogynistic streak is mostly absent, but that's about it.Dialogue is sparse and flat.
Unfortunately, this also makes it like reading a report.
In other words, it's somewhat dry and boring.
I still found it readable, but I actually kinda like dry and boring.
Still, this was too dry and boring, even for me.The story doesn't have the usual climax.
The important thing is the journey, not the destination.
Scientists!
Making things happen!
Getting called out of their homes in the middle of the night!
Rigorously sanitizing every inch of their bodies!
Looking over ascii-image printouts!
Performing exhaustive tests!
Debating theories of exobiology!
And it's a total blast!Michael Crichton made microorganisms scary and cool for the masses with science that isn't laughable 40 years later.
Is it any wonder that when he got his hands on dinosaurs he set the entertainment industry on fire?
Worth noting that the movie is even better; with fine performances, tight direction and the wild decision to include a female scientist.
You may never look at anti-bacterial soap the same.
Having recently read a very disappointing Michael Crichton book, I decided to go back to one of my all-time favorites.
I think Crichton is at his best here; the conceit that this book is a report on a real scientific and biological crisis is fantastic, and he sticks to it so completely I remember wondering, as a teen when I first read if, if any of it were true.Crichton was not a master of characterization, but here, it doesn't matter.
(hide spoiler)]I think this may be my favorite Crichton novel.

Note to self: Next time, remember that you don't like books that involve medicine. That took a whole 2 stars off for me.Definitely fun infectious disease story, though I wish there had been more about the outbreak and less about the science behind it.
There is no movie of this one (as far as I’m aware) and I do enjoy a good space epidemiology premise.
Still, I cannot rate it beyond a solid three because at the end of the day it suffers from what I have identified as the usual Crichton pitfalls; it’s written like it knows it will be used as a screenplay and the ending is weak sauce.
Literarily, it also suffered by comparison from being read right after Heart of Darkness.
At one point a character drops a cigarette in snow and Crichton writes that it ‘sputtered’.
An unassuming start to an illustrious career of an author who was an innovator at core. Not the first book he published but the first novel where he didn't use a pseudonym. He previously published novels under the name John Lange and Odds On was MC's first novel and he would continue to write as Lange even after the success of Andromeda Strain; his SIXTH novel. Wow You know, as a med student he started his writing career to supplement his income. Nowadays it's the opposite, doctors publish books to supplement theirs. Sort of. haha.
Moksline fantastika čia, priešingai nei teigia anotacijoje, nelabai net kvepia. Nepaisant to, knyga visai nebloga. Taip, ji iš tiesų labiau primena mikrobiologijos vadovėlį, bet kažkaip šiuo atveju man tai panašiau į pliusą, o ne į minusą. Neturiu jokių priekaištų, gal nebent išskyrus tai, kad galėjo būti daugiau dramos ir/ar veiksmo. Nes dqabar realiai gavosi "atėjau, pamačiau, pasislėpiau laboratorijoj, nugalėjau". Knyga trumpa ir smagi, turėtų patikt daug kam.
Το «Στέλεχος της Ανδρομέδας» ανήκει στο είδος της επιστημονικής φαντασίας και παίζει με τους φόβους του ανθρώπου προς τους αόρατους στο γυμνό μάτι αλλά άκρως επικίνδυνους ιούς και την επίδραση που μπορεί να έχουν στην ανθρωπότητα.
Ο Michael Crichton ήταν απόφοιτος της ιατρικής σχολής του Harvard και αυτό φαίνεται μέσα από την γραφή του που μπορεί να είναι στεγνή και χωρίς ιδιαίτερη λογοτεχνική χροιά αλλά ελκυστική και εποικοδομητική.
Αν και πίστευα πως αυτό θα ήταν ένα βιβλίο γεμάτο δράση και σασπένς η ανακάλυψη πως μάλλον θα είναι ένα μυθιστόρημα με μετρίου βαθμού αγωνία (αν θέλω να είμαι τελείως ειλικρινής, θα έλεγα πως μάλλον δεν έχει ιδιαίτερα αγωνία) με μεγάλο όγκο πληροφοριών και ένα στάσιμο περιβάλλον δεν με πείραξε τόσο όσο περίμενα.
I had to think for a couple of days to give this book a proper review/rating.
I read some criticism that this book didn't developed any characters.
Well my thoughts are the same BUT Michael Crichton in the beginning of the book says that this is a report and every single chapter/day was from a report of some sorts.
Who knows -in fifty years, when there is no more cancer or other plague I will read a book and say the same thing.
Bear in mind that neither of those things happens.
A pretty gripping read.
My first Michael Crichton book and I think I'm going to read more of his works.I loved the premise, how it was developed and concluded.
Although, in my opinion, the story would have been much more thrilling if it was a narration of ongoing events instead of a recounting of the past, especially considering the ending.Nevertheless, the story had my attention locked on for most of the time.
The narration gets into scientific details quite a few times and I've read that the same is the case with most of the author's works.
In high school, I read this and everything else of Crichton's that I could get my hands on. I remembered liking it but not much else so I decided to read it again--something I rarely do. In the end, I liked it even more than the first time. For me, this is Crichton at his best, combining scientific research with an interesting plot and a well paced story. This goes along with 'The Great Train Robbery' as my favorite of his books.
