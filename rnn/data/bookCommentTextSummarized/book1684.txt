"It may not have been only the common ails of humanity with which she tried to cope; it seemed sometimes as if love and hate and jealousy and adverse winds at sea might also find their proper remedies among the curious wild-looking plants in Mrs. Todd’s garden." Mrs. Todd may have appeared a bit rough around the edges, but her hospitable heart quickly made a friend out of me.
As we looked far seaward among the outer islands, the trees seemed to march seaward still, going steadily over the heights and down to the water’s edge."Oh, how I wish I could return to the people of Dunnet Landing and to Mrs. Todd’s hearth with a cup of tea and listen to some more of these wonderfully nostalgic stories.
I love this book with its portrait of the rural towns and peoples of New England, primarily of the state of Maine and primarily of the town of Dunnet's Landing, seen through the eyes of a visitor from the city, a woman sympathetic to the people and lifestyle.Jewett, an influence for Willa Cather, another author I admire so much, writes largely unsentimentally of the daily lives and relationships of the farmers and fishermen, wives, husbands, widows and widowers, the small details that unite these people who are still in some ways close to their Puritan stock.
This chronicle of life in a Maine coastal village around the end of the 19 century was a pleassure to read.
It's a novel, but each chapter has the feel of a short story, stories of this very quaint place and the people who live there.
It's inhabitants are mostly widows, husbands lost to the sea, and aging seamen, all struggling to make a daily living off the land and sea.
But best of all, the author paints a visually stunning picture of the landscape and seascape of the setting.
I'm happy to have discovered this author and look forward to reading more of her work.
This is the 4th or 5 the time I've read this book, and once again I returned to a simpler time with gentle people in a small Maine village.
Most of the women in these tales are widows or spinsters, making the best of their lives despite disappointments and diminished circumstances, finding happiness in small things: a nice cup of tea and a warm fire on a stormy night, an unexpected visit from a neighbor, a beautiful day, or seeing relatives at a family reunion.
I read these stories at bedtime, and drifted off to sleep with a feeling of contentment.
i feel that my love for this book indicates that i am actually a 57-year-old trapped in the body of a 27-year-old.
Hated it in high school.A few words about Ms. Jewett's prose: crystalline, bell-clear, a bit chilly, totally fitting for the times, places and people being described.
I don't know who finished it or how.The first short story is "A White Heron," which I'd read before a few years ago.
This one is an observational piece, and pretty much as fun as the preceding story."Going to Shrewsbury" another happy/sad tale of life for a woman down on her luck in the 19th century.
A good man ..."Aunt Cynthy Dallett" - this story wraps up the collection and focuses hard on the theme of women getting old in varying financial circumstances.
And, as the above quote shows, her regionalism (like that of many other writers, then and now) is a justified defense of genuine diversity, a ringing statement that the cultural attitudes and practices of our ruling snobocracy are not the "right" ones to which all the rest of the world needs to be forcibly assimilated.The long title piece was, as Cather notes, actually unfinished when Jewett died, so as it stands it is more a series of prose sketches than a plotted story; but it contains some of her most vivid characterizations and richest descriptions of Maine life.

Sarah Orne Jewett was robbed by the patriarchy
1. The ReturnThere was something about the coast town of Dunnet which made it seem more attractive than other maritime villages of Eastern Maine.
Perhaps it was the simple fact of acquaintance with that neighborhood which made it so attaching...Like the unnamed narrator of The Country of Pointed Firs, I also felt a gentle happiness at my return to Dunnet Landing in my second reading of this book.
On the surface, it, like Cranford, is about a town full of dear old ladies whose greatest pleasure it is to go about visiting each other.
Their worn faces are often lighting up beautifully with affection and simple pleasure.
Recommended to me by my daughter, this book is just a literary masterpiece. I will never know why I had to read Ivanhoe in high school instead of something like this. I never knew this author existed. Jewett's use of language just sets a standard few authors have ever mastered. I just loved it.
I completed my annual re-read of Country of the Pointed Firs more in love with it and my native New England than ever.
I continued on and read the titular "Other Stories."There is something happening in Jewett's writing that borders on perfection.
Country is in perfect balance, the effect of which is utter harmony.Critics will probably say this book is too slow.
These are true statements after a fashion, but I would hazard a guess that at some point in everyone's life we each need a slow moment.

This is classically prosed dialect as spoken in a certain mid-summer place and time. It is exquisite. The locale is late nineteenth century into earliest 1900's Maine coastal town- and the web of islands that surround its rocky shores. Surroundings are detailed to form and purpose and entwined within its occupants' mood. The characterizations of these elder women, the visitor and some of the sea-faring men who visit come completely alive. Beautiful read.
A positively delightful book, lyrical and nostalgic. Highly recommended.
Entering Jewitt's world was like being cast backward into a time near the start of the 20th Century, to a place long gone, the fictional world of Dunnit's Landing, based on the author's home of South Berwick, Maine, at the time when the novel is set a declining seaport near the border with New Hampshire.
As expressed by Sarah Jewitt, there is great beauty not just in nature but in self-sufficiency and one's loyalty should be to the seasonally revealing landscapes of coastal Maine, not to one's fellow humans.
Sarah Orne Jewett was a woman profoundly admired by the young Willa Cather; and, in fact, Jewett told Cather (paraphrasing) 'to stop writing like Henry James, and just tell the story.' Cather was so affected by Jewett's influence that she dedicated her 1913 novel, "O' Pioneers" to Jewett.
This collection of Jewett's short stories is magnificent; they are a quiet, pastoral, lovely and idyllic look at a small slice of Americana in a small Maine sea-side village at the end of the 19th century, and told from the perspective of an unnamed female narrator.
Sit on a granite boulder under the fir trees overlooking the Atlantic and have a nice quiet visit with Sarah Orne Jewett.
Written in 1896 (the year after my grandmother was born, this book made me think so much of my own life and family.
It just made me think of the simpler time of my own life - back when there were noo computers, no pagers, no cellphones ringing all the time.
I think this is why the book appeals to people - the nostalgic look at the town and its residents rings true, touches our hearts, and reminds us of the early days of not only our own lives, but the lives of those precious people now gone from us.
I've been meaning to read this for years, and I'm glad I did, although it wasn't quite a good as I had hoped for.It wasn't always an easy book to read, IMO, but the character studies and sense of place were beautifully drawn by Jewett, with some real food for thought to mull over and savor.This collection of loosely woven story vignettes will likely bore a reader craving plot and action.
However, if you're in the mood to cerebrally explore a small Maine coastal village around the turn of the century, and read about some interesting and endearing characters, I recommend The Country of the Pointed Firs for a nice, gentle read.
I don't want to say this is the whitest book ever written, but it makes Little House on the Prairie look like Boyz N The Hood.It's easy enough to believe this is what life was really like in that place and time (as the blurb from Rudyard Kipling on the jacket asserts), but I'd absolutely feel like I was in an alien society if I was dropped into Dunnet Landing.Don't think I could have read this in a single shot, I read a few chapters a week as palate cleansers over the course of 2-3 months.
Really lovely. Reminded me a bit of Katherine Mansfield in its non-narrative, anecdotal nature. Left the "and Other Stories" bit for another time.
4.5 stars. The Country of the Pointed Firs itself was a solid 5 for me, but most of the short stories were more like a 4. My favorites of the short stories were "A Native of Winby," "Decoration Day," "The Flight of Betsey Lane," and "The Hiltons' Holiday."
It rewards those who appreciate well-crafted prose, and people, and love.Although some purists demur, I personally recommend that the three related short stories: A Dunnet Shepherdess, The Queen's Twin, and William's Wedding [not included in the original work but included in the edition edited by Willa Cather] be read with it.
I should think that Willa Cather's judgment in these matters may be trusted.I especially find that "William's Wedding" makes a perfect ending -- a fitting epilogue to the novella.
A fourth story "The Foreigner" {unknown to Cather} is also a Dunnet Landing piece and has been called a "mislaid treasure of American writing" by Warner Berthoff.
Her generous and open heart invites her into the lives of these isolated folks, and I like to think that she is forever changed.For example, when the narrator travels to an isolated island to meet the mother of her hostess, Mrs. Todd she writes, "Lookin' pretty well for an old lady, ain't she?" said Mrs. Todd's mother, turning away from her daughter to speak to me.
It some ways it depicted a legacy of former simpler days---yet, in other ways, it is a strong reminder of what it was like to live on the cusp of changing times while these sea-worn people held fast to their memories and their former way of life.Communities matter!
But this loosely structured novel from 1896—a collection of sketches set in a fictional coastal town—is an unsung gem and fully deserving of the label "classic." Jewett (like Miriam Colwell, author of  Contentment Cove) was a Down East lady in a Boston marriage; she dedicated her life to Annie Fields, the widow of a prominent publisher.
Field and Jewett (with their two maids) spent a month summering in Martinsville, Maine, believed to be the inspiration for Dunnet Landing.Willa Cather was an important champion of Jewett; she dedicated  O Pioneers!
One of those important books by women that were not part of the canon when I was in college.At first it feels as if each chapter is a character sketch of an inhabitant in a small town.
And the context grows from individual to family to the town community and beyond as characters become part of Dunnetts Landing, Dunnetts Landing becomes part of Maine, Maine becomes part of New England, and New England becomes part of the world as the sea provides a link with Europe.
Published in 1896, this well known novella covers the summer stay of a fictional seacoast town in Maine.
There is little plot, merely some interesting portraits of local characters and charming depictions of typical village scenes and events intended to evoke a way of life that was disappearing even then.
The visitor befriends her herbalist landlady and accompanies her on forays, including a boat trip to visit her mother and brother who live on an island.
She draws out her landlady�s story of another female relative who exiled herself to a hermit existence on a more remote island after a failed romance.
In another section, the visitor gets to participate in a joyous family reunion.
While there is not much that is truly remarkable about Jewett's stories, they are, for me, very comfortable.
I hope to do more study of her work in the future in order to understand all the reasons that they are comfortable yet unremarkable.
The most obvious is that her stories are regional and portray good stories about strong women.
It was very good to see the places she wrote about and sit alone in her garden for awhile.
She was far more popular in that region of course, but I also came to understand her influence in that area.
This is a feel-good book with none of the guilt!
It's smart, it's beautifully written--and it's got no love story (despite its being about a young, single woman on her own in a small town).
The depiction of Maine is as vivid as a photograph.
The setting is the 1800s, so a woman without a husband--and not LOOKING for a husband--is something of an oddity in the first place.
But the people she meets are interesting, and there's a restfulness to each chapter that's rare in fine literature.
I genuinely liked escaping to spend summer in Dunnet Landing with the unnamed protagonist.
This book is a masterpiece.
