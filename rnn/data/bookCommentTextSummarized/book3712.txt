The first story, The Coming of Mr. Quin, sets the tone for the whole book when Quin appears at the doorstep of the country house where Mr. Satterthwaite happens to be spending his New Year's Eve, as the first visitor of the year.
Then Quin sets out to make his presence felt by enabling the house-guests to solve the mystery of a suicide that happened in that house a year ago!
As Satterthwaite says, his friend seem to be interested in the welfare of lovers more than solving crimes.
I half expect Quin to step over the threshold every time, saying: "Damnable weather outside.
Not once does the reader feel mocked or wronged because of the peculiar air the arcane presence of Mr. Harley Quin bestows on these stories, which is, to me, another marvellous paradox, being they crime stories -and Christie's at that.
Agatha Christie, mother of the rational, precise, objective, infallible Hercule Poirot, and now she gives birth to this ghost, this wraith, this shadow of a man who appears, magically, whenever and wherever a new tragedy is about to happen or an old one needs to be put to sleep.
If Agatha were still alive, I would start a petition to have more Quin's stories.
This is the only book of Harley Quin written by Agatha Christie and it is unlike any other Christie novel.A collection of 12 short stories where the recurring characters are Mr. Harley Quin and Mr. Satterthwaite. Mr Satterthwaite is different from Christie's other side-kick (Mr.Hastings of Poirot series). He is from British Upper class, is 60+ years old and loves his comfort.Coming to Mr.Harley Quin, again very different from the famous Poirot or Miss Marple.... "This was Mr.Quin's doing. It was
In some of the stories Mr.Quin did not even need to go to the crime scene.
Just by playing on people's perception of what they have seen and how things could have happened, he is able to solve the mystery.
I liked the technique used to solve most of the mysteries but none of the stories made me bite my fingers or make my heart stop.
But I would still say that most of the stories are decent and make for a good cozy mystery read.I was a bit disappointed with the ending- (view spoiler)[What is up with a supernatural twist at the end?
Choose Your Own Adventure!You are the Mysterious Mr. Quinn. You are ever so mysterious. And yet you do not really hold a candle to Poirot or Marple or even the Tuppences. Your adventures are boring; your mysteries are trite. You are an Unfinished Book.If you decide you want some hot Belgian action, choose http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/...If you decide an older woman would be more your cuppa, choose http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/...
The result is a collection of stories with a romantic or Gothic atmosphere that ultimately (with one or two notable exceptions) resolve into a logical and clever solution.I also think that the mystery of Harley Quin himself is quite fascinating.
Satterthwaite is not usually numbered among Christie's detectives, but he manages to solve a number of mysteries with a little prodding from Mr. Quin and his messages from beyond.The tone of the stories is dreamy and romantic and the tales of love and murder stick with the reader, especially The Dead Harlequin and The Man From the Sea in my case.

One of my favorite collection of short stories, all tied together around the realm of the harlequinade as experienced by the dapper, if wizened, Mr. Satterthwaite.As others have mentioned, there's no sense of strain in these stories, no sense that the beloved by many, Agatha Christie, had problems matching Mr. Quin to his supernatural side, by bringing in the ever curious Mr. Satterthwaite to help bring walking spirits to rest, perhaps bring the guilty to justice, and even to help the lonely discover love.
I like to break enough of the spoiler-free to yes.If you want well written stories that are not mysteries in the sense of stories to be solved?
In what is a classic Harley Quin theme, Quin helps Satterthwaite to determine who the true murderer was a decade ago - and clear the name of someone who was suffering the effects of being under suspicion.
Again, true love triumphs and a man falsely accused is saved from hanging.5.) The Soul of the Croupier – Satterthwaite ends up vacationing in Corsica.
Also, the theme of preventing suicide and the triumph of true love are dominant.
There is also a suicide in this story.9.) The Dead Harlequin – A husband is murdered and it's made to look like suicide.10.) The Bird with the Broken Wing – Quin summons Satterthwaite to Laidell with a Ouija board.
If I weren't trying to read everything by Agatha Christie, I would have missed Mr. Harley Quin.
So different than Christie Poirot and Marple books.
Christie mixes mystery and near fantasy with the mysterious Mr. Quin and the elderly Mr. Satterthwaite.
Quin shows up suddenly at key moments intervening on behalf of lovers and the dead utilizing the observant Mr. Satterthwaite in this process.
Quin grew on me as I read through this book.
The stories deal with the interaction between a mysterious dark, saturnine stranger using the pseudonym of Harley Quin and a 69-year-old meek, wizened bachelor named Mr. Satterthwaite, a man sometimes sentimental and a bit of a fop but perceptive and a shrewd judge of character.
(view spoiler)[His suspicions are more than confirmed later on in “The Dead Harlequin” and “Harlequin's Lane.” (hide spoiler)]As The New York Times noted when the book first appeared in 1930, the short stories are more like fairy tales than Poirot- or Miss Marple-like detective stories.

The only reason I kept reading it to the end was to unlock the "mystery" of Mr. Quin, and to revel in Christie's spiral into the dark and supernatural.
The 12 interlocking, and often repetitive, stories featuring both Mr. Quin and Mr. Satterthwaite, are rough sketches of (potentially intriguing) mystery plot lines with both these characters superimposed and made to fit into them.
Really.Though Mr. Satterthwaite commendably solves the mystery presented in each story, no one is brought to "justice", as is stated on the book jacket.
And talk about lazy: at least every story recounts the dark, motley nature (physical and otherwise) of Mr. Quin, and Mr. Satterthwaite's feelings towards him.
What did I think?! Answer: Eww -_-I'll say just two points:-1- Christie wrote this book when she was a beginner. 2- If not so, then my copy is not the original text :p w a5tem klamy b 7asbya Allah w Ne3ma Alwakeel!
Gizemli Mr. Harley Quin gerçekten beni mest etti.
Buradaki gönderme gerçekten ilginç; çünkü adamın bir "arlöken" olduğu, arlöken lokantalarında yediği, arlöken hanlarında kaldığı anlatılıyor.
Arlöken bizim dilimizde soytarı demekmiş, sanırım orijinal hali bariz bir şekilde Harlequin.
Bu gizemli Bay Quin ne zaman ortaya çıksa Bay Satterthwaite kesinlikle bir şeylerin döneceğini anlıyor.
Senelerdir çözülemeyen gizemler, cinayetler hep Bay Quin ile bir şekilde alakalı.
Sorduğu sorular okurken herkesin ampullerini çaktırıyor gerçekten, tabi Bay Satterthwaite da tüm olayları böyle çözüyor.
Ama dediği gibi, Bay Quin olmasa o şekilde düşünemez.
Bu Harlequin karakteri gerçekten ilginç, adı da kendisi de.
The Mysterious Mr. Quin is not one of Christie's most well know books.
He is a refined old gent who knows all about the complexities of life and love but has never experienced them for his own.
Mr. Satterthwaite is haunted, not only by his barely-realised sense of regret but also by a mysterious man known as Mr. Quin, a man who "speaks for the dead" and "comes and goes" as they need him.
Mr. Quin has a skill for illuminating Mr. Satterthwaite's thought-processes, to nudge him towards details that the older man hadn't realised were important.
عبارة عن مجموعة قصص وأحداث يظهر خلالها كوين الغامض .. حقيقة كل قصة تستحق أن يفرد لها مجلد .. أجاثا مبدعة
الحياة غريبة حقّا. أنا لا يمكنني أن أتخيّل كيف يكون الأمر عندما يعيش المرء كمتفرّجٍ فقط
3.5 stars maybe? I'll have to think about that last story for a little longer...
Dame Christie, in her autobiography, speaks of Mr. Quin and Mr. Satterthwaite as two of her favourite characters and I can see why and I dearly wish that she had written more stories with them.
These are quite different from Dame Christie's other work but I recommend them highly.A few tastes:"You say your life is your own but can you dare to ignore the chance that you are taking part in a gigantic drama under the orders of a divine Producer?
And who are you to say that the same wishes, the same desires, may not operate in that other life?
This is an interesting collection of short stories connected by both Mr. Satterthwaite and Mr. Harley Quin. I never quite understood who Mr. Quin actually was. I’m not sure if I would have gotten more out of it if I had read it in print as opposed to listen to it via audiobook, where I think I may have zoned out a little more than I should have. Not my favorite Christie, but I did enjoy Hugh Fraser’s narration.
This is a little different than some of her other books. It's got a bit of a magical feel to it. That said, I enjoyed the "outside looking in," style of the main character. The stories are fairly quick reads, this would make a nice book for waiting in line or commutes.

What?!😶
The Mysterious Mr. Quin is a collection of twelve stories featuring a very interesting character, Mr Satterthwaite who observes everyone and everything.
"[Quin] has a power--an almost uncanny power--of showing you what you have seen with your own eyes, of making clear to you what you have heard with your own ears."My favorite story among these is 'The Coming of Mr. Quin', which introduces these characters in a peculiar way, by solving a murder mystery held a long time ago.
Like every collection of stories, I loved some but didn't care for others.
But like every mystery story, I fell in love with it.
The best thing that Christie ever wrote.Mr. Satterthwaite is our guide into an upper class world of murder, deceit and property.
Quin is one of the most successful modern trickster characters in that he has a darkness necessary to have the dangerous edge a 'good' trickster needs.The stories in this collection are not mysteries as such, although several do feature crimes that need to be solved.
They are more like puzzles, whose pieces need Satterthwaite and Quin to find their place.Unlike a lot of Christie's short story collections, this does not tail off towards the end.
These are all short stories which all follow the similar pattern of Mr. Satterthwaite, who with a lack of confidence solves mysteries with help from Mr. Harley Quinn who only ever appears intermittently.
Further reading tells me that Mr. Quin and Mr. Satterthwaite were two of Christie's favourite characters.
I found Mr. Quin charming and full of character but his appearances are albeit very short and I found Mr. Satterthwaite to be quite dull in character when naturally compared to Poirot and Marple..Favourite Quote: "You as you, may not matter to anyone in the world, but you as a person in a particular place may matter unimaginably"
I have always been a fan of Agatha Christie and as I have made my way through all of her books, I have begun to notice pattern between them.
I started reading with the assumption that Mr. Harley Quin would be the "detective" and the stories would be told from his point of view.
I loved the supernatural elements that were mixed into the stories and the mystery that surrounds Mr. Harley Quin.
Although this book is a little hard to get into, I would recommend it to any one who likes supernatural mysteries and any Agatha Christie fan who is willing to see another side to her writing.
I enjoyed this collection of short stories by Agatha Christie, featuring fussy little Mr. Satterthwaite and the dark and mysterious Mr. Harley Quin, who is always "just passing by," and helps Mr. Satterthwaite solve crimes and human dramas that unravel before him.Mr. Satterthwaite is an older man, a bachelor, and a connoisseur.
He has always watched life pass by, and was content to do so.
But as old age approaches, he decides to participate in the little things that have passed him by.
Harley Quin is one of my favorite Agatha Christie characters and her least known.
Along with his friend, Mr. Sattherhwaite, they solve little mysteries....or do they?
Mr. Quin suddenly appears on the scene no matter where it may be whenever Mr. Sattherwhaite is faced with a problem such as murder or theft.
He suggests solutions and leads Mr. Sattherhwaite to the solving of the crime(s).
Christie implies that he may be almost a supernatural being as he often is surrounded by an aura which resembles the colors of Harlequin's costume (hence his name).
This book contains the twelve short stories about Mr. Quin....very short and very clever.
رواية رائعة و ممتعة لم امل منها ولو للحظة كانت بالنسبة لي مسلية وغامضة بسبب السيد كوين وحبي للسيد سترثوايت العجوز العطوف تستاهل 5/5.,حيرتني القصة الاخيرة للسيد كوين ( زقاق المهرج ) فما زال وقعها علي غير زائل واتسائل هل السيد كوين شبح او ملك الموت او ؟!!!.اكتشفت انني لا احب النهايات المفتوحة بتاتاً مع انها مشوقة لكن احب كون الامور مفسرة على عكس الطابع الانجليزي الذي يحب ان ينسج حكايته من منظوره الخاص عن القصة التي تتراءى امامه و يفسرها على اهوائه بما يناسب خياله الخصب
