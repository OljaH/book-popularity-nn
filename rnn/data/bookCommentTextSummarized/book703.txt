This three act play is a very quick and humorous read. The plot involves mistaken identities and a love triangle.
For a minute there, I almost taught the same two plays for my summer school class as I did four years ago.
I toyed with several options that were interesting only to me before I finally remembered having found a play by A.A. Milne a while ago.
I fired through it and was delighted by my find.Belinda takes charge immediately as a strong female character capably handling multiple suitors in a zippy, beguiling, though (mostly) harmless manner.
It’s meant to be fun, and it is.
It’s meant to be the next play that my summer school students read?
This was pretty funny, once you got past the stage directions. I really cannot believe AA milne wrote a play that was so over played! Belinda was funny, Delia was understanding, not as unromantic as she claimed and forgiving. Tremayne was kinda intimidating, but in a way where he might not actually attack. Delish and Baxter were really the best characters in the story! Definatly commic relief! Over all not bad, but not even close to great!
Belinda is an early play by A. A. Milne. A light and escapist comedy, Milne himself called it "a purely artificial comedy whose only purpose was to amuse". It opened at the New Theatre in London on 8 April 1918, with Irene Vanbrugh playing the title role of Belinda.
Pretty light and frothy... wish it was more compelling.
