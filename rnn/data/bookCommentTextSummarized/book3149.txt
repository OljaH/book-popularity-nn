A great book by Guenon that expands on the theory of the multiple states of the being. The author approaches the subject, as usual, with utmost rigor and objectivity. This theory is indispensable in understanding the means and the end of effective realization from a purely metaphysical if not entirely practical point of view. It is a great book for those intellectuals interested in the metaphysical foundations of spiritual ascent and realization.
my goodness this is a fine book,hard to understand
