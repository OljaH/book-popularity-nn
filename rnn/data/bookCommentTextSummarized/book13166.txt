The chapter "Gifts of Depression" is phenomenal. One cannot feel true happiness until they've felt true pain. Our society today is so focused on the quick-fix in order to 'feel' happy, that we don't allow people to go through the NORMAL ups and downs of life. It is NORMAL to hurt, and cry, and feel pain. By going through those emotions we are able to move on to greater happiness. I would not give up the pain in my life for anything in this world. Nothing.
Let me share some of my favorite passages from the last chapter i read:On page 258, he just finishes a story about a nun who "lost her faith." To sum up he says something profound.
She had to learn that faith comes not only from the spiritual life and high revelations, it also comes as an emanation from the depths, a starkly impersonal reality from the most personal place...we have to arrive at that difficult point where we don't know what is going on or what we can do.
I have found myself challenged deeply towards personal and spiritual fulfillment, and have been recommending the book to everyone that I know.
Moore's ideas would resonate with spiritual wanderers and people who view life as an artistic work in progress.
Here is what I took away from the book:-When Moore was a therapist, he noticed that many clients would come to him, wanting him to remove a flaw of theirs.
He explained to her that if it were magically possible to remove this tendency, she would simply acquire an entirely new of problems that comes with being an independent person.
Moore helped me realize that jealousy is natural and even necessary in an intimate relationship.
Thomas Moore's approach seems much more compassionate to me.
It takes the reader to great depths within the realm of their soul. There are no words that may describe what this great book can offer to someone in the midst of their suffering, as it provides healing that comes with a deep understanding. Such outlook could replenish contentment and restore warmth to someone's life with a reason. Thomas Moore had valuable information to share. He also contributed significant knowledge that enriches both the mind and soul. Highly recommended!
Basically, Moore addresses what he terms our culture's overly "hygenic" approach to mental health - the idea that we need to clean up and get rid of undesirable parts of ourselves.
He does not mean that literally, in terms of accepting multiple deities, but rather uses examples and Greek myths to show that all parts of ourselves are important and deserve listening and care.
Instead of repressing undesirable parts of ourselves, Moore advocates honoring symptoms as voices of soul.
It is in caring for our multiple needs and complex, contrasting parts that we can honor different parts of soul and facilitate comprehensive care.
The most important point that this book made for me was the value of accepting contradictions, why we accept or reject certain behaviors/characteristics.
These behaviors may be opposites and they would appear to contradict each other, but we draw on these characteristics and use them as they are needed in life.
Personally I found this book useful to me.
This book if full of wisdom.
I've abandoned it because it relies heavily on mythology for analogies and I have a personal dislike of mythology, therefore I had difficulty getting through the book.
When authors use mythology within their prose, a knowledge of the myths is required.
I have very little knowledge of the myths and have very little desire to learn more about them.
AS Byatt referred to a lot of myths in her book "Possession" and I cross referenced most of them because I was determined to read her book from beginning to end.
Like I told Zanna https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...--- who recently began reading Art On My Mind --- “this book is my jam.” In her essay “The Poetics of Soul: Art for Everyone” ---hooks takes to the pulpit to speak about the sanctity of the soul as revealed in artworks created by Alison Saar.
She cites Thomas Moore’s book Care of the Soul (1992) in this essay about four times, which is what made me curious to read his book.
Care of the Soul does not read like a generic “self- help” book but offers concepts regarding the soul and its care which challenge western contemporary expectations toward solving internal and external mysteries of life.
Thomas and I had a great deal of conversations over 6 months. He introduced me to the Greek mythology, invited me to see differently the emotions I preferred to avoid, and encouraged me about imagination and mystery. What was once called hallucinations is now the soul of the world again, and this time, I am so happy to be Home.
This is the sort of book that I'll keep near my tissue box for the rest of my life, not because it made me cry.
Rather, when I cry, I'll go for a tissue, see Thomas Moore's brilliant book, and feel better, hopefully.
I'll give myself time to brood, time to weep, and time to allow my soul to grow.
There's a chapter in here for nearly every modern major problem.
It was a joy to read.The only slow part for me was the opening chapter.
He was also defining the terms in his piece, and setting up the historical precedent for the care of the soul.
I was attracted to this book because of Thomas Moore's scholastic background in mythology, musicology and theology.
In fact it is a direct challenge to the traditional religious way of thinking about spirituality.
He casts the obstacles of life in a soothing light, using the tales of Greek/Roman mythology and traditional shamanic dreamwork to add richness to our understanding of life's trials (depression, anxiety, death, narcissism, low-self esteem, envy).
Through ancient stories and archetypes Moore illustrates how we can make our bodies, our living spaces and our relationships a living testament to the beauty of life.
Admittedly, the first part of the book bored me. I went into this expecting a spiritual work and got psychology. However, in the 4th chapter when Moore really hit his stride the book began to take off. Although throughout the book, Moore uses Greek mythology to illustrate points, his Christian monastic background is evident in his understandings. Moore's writing throughout is thoughtful, eloquent, and inspiring. If you're reading it to help someone else, this book is futile. If you're reading it to examine yourself, it's a gem.
Care of the Soul addresses the problem that so many people today face: how to love one's self (yet also explaining the monumental difference between loving one's self and ego). I've never read a book that was as genuinely real as this one. Although referencing some Christian aspects, Moore remains religiously unbiased. Moore also frequently comments upon the difference between "care" and "cure." One must accept his or her human traits and appreciate them rather than try to get rid of them. The soul is not something that needs to be fixed, but rather something that needs to be loved.
This is such an amazing book that really helped me shift my perspective of the healing journey. In one of many metaphors that stuck with me, he describes the soul journey as a following the path of a labyrinth rather than a climbing up a mountain, reaching a spiritual peak. There's a place for those spiritual ascents, too, but Moore always brings our attention back to our ordinary broken humanness--which is where we can find true nourishment. I will be referencing this book again and again.
I read this book years ago but I frequently remember stories and examples from it. One of the major insights that I gained from Thomas Moore is that there is a value to depression/sadness and that the only way out of it is to really go into it. I feel that reading this book helped me to deal with many events that came afterwards in a much more present way. There's much more to be said about this book but I've have to re-read it first!
He maintains, for example, that it might be a good idea to combat depression by diving into the negative feelings, dealing with the causes, and coming out stronger on the other end.
Because the Bushmen lived, at the time he was among them, virtually without influence from the modern west, they provided a virtual tabula Rasa for testing some of Jung’s pet theories about the universality of the myth patterns and unconscious sources of dreams and archetypes.
However, my students and I had a good time exploring Jung’s theories of myth and archetypes and dream analysis.
I wasn’t prepared for his interpretation on myths and the souls that walk this earth today.
It helped me ponder more of a shade of grey than simply black and white regarding good and evil.
I believe that dreams are a glance directly at the soul but can be dangerous to interpret if you are not trained in that area.
Dreams and the written word of God might be readily accessible but should not be analyzed without a sturdy guide to help along the way.
It came across egotistical and challenging God. I will not be reading this book again.
Exactly what I needed to read to cross the bridge from self-help/psychology to the concepts I keep coming back to: the exploration of spirituality vs. soulfulness, of soulful work, of archetypal psychology, all of it. The very end doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me yet, but it probably will someday. I borrowed this book from the library and got halfway through before I knew I'd need it for real; picked up a used copy for $5 and plan to keep it forever.
I read Care of the Soul because it belonged to one of my daughters and she left it at my house.
Couple of things - Soul is not the same as ego, intellect or even spirit to the author.
The COTS point of view p.283 "To take care of the soul we will need to give up our limited ideas of what psychology is, our attempts to gain rational control over our moods and emotions, our illusion that our consciousness is the only sign of soul in the universe, and our desire for dominance over nature and fabricated things.
Here is an important book that teaches you how to accept the everyday life, to understand yourself and not be afraid to fail, to be sad, to be ordinary.
To care for your soul is to appreciate the everyday moments, to feel the sadness and happiness in small things, to know how to be quiet, to contemplate.
It is all about how we appreciate our life.
The ego works on our careers, wealth and prestige, but we have to allow the soul to be sad, even depressed and not to succeed.
I want to buy this book and read it again in a future.
While providing a lot of suggestions for treating ourselves with gentlessness and respect to better our daily lives, Thomas Moore urges readers to remember that our souls are only partly on the earth, and partly in eternity, "We might remember the part the resides in eternity when we feel despair over the part that is in life" (96).
"Formal religion, so powerful and influencial in the establishment of values, always lies on a cusp between the divine and the demonic.
Religion is never neutral .
Lots of interesting food for thought!
"Care of the soul is not a project of self-improvement nor a way of being released from the troubles and pains of human existence.
We know we are well on the way toward soul when we fell attachment to the world and the people around us and when we live as much from the heart as from the head.
We know soul is being cared for when our pleasures feel deeper than usual, when we can let go of the need to be free of complexity and confusion, and when compassion takes the place of distrust and fear.
Often, it amazes me how books find their way into our hands exactly when we need them.
The gist of this councilling book was the lesson of respecting every person's right to make choices for themselves even when those choices are hurtful and seemingly unacceptable to us.
It is what it is, only our ego thinks we could have made it happen some other way or we could maybe 'fix' it.
Who was I to think only I knew what was best for the other person, an adult who was doing what he did to salvage his own self respect?
Setting this aside for now...Moving further along ....While Moore was taking a myth and 'opening it up' I was fine. He seems to have drifted into other speculative and drier areas, also aspects of personality and personalities which don't concern me. I'm skimming more than reading....==============================================================================Think I'm 'getting' this book! Moore is taking the ancient myths and reinterpreting them for us in a new and deeply spiritual way! I LIKE! I LIKE! Now I know why my friend, Jane was so keen to get to read this!!! ==============================================================================Started this long ago... Just pulled it back off the shelf...
This book reminded me of the richness in life and that if I just slowed down to notice, I would be a happier person.Moore draws on Greek myths such as that of Echo and Narcissus and Tristan and Isolde to exemplify his ideas around Self-Love and Love.
He has a poetic way of writing that while it may not agree with everyone (at times myself included), it did remind me that we all have our own ways of expression.The biggest take away I had was his take on depression and melancholy.
While most would write it off as a disease to medicate, Moore suggests that perhaps it's a rite of passage and an opportunity for growth.
This book relies heavily on mythology to make its points.
I am not a big fan of mythology.
There is some good information in this book, for example ...
"Strangely, perhaps jealousy itself contains the seeds of fulfillment of both sex and intimacy," talks about how allowing your soul to feel its inferiority and dependence with another will help you realize the fulfillment of that relationship--rather than reject that feeling and assert your independence.Overall, some interesting information, but the presentation of it (through myth) just didn't resonate with me.
This a wonderful antidote to a world where, in our quest for efficiency, growth and constant activity, we lose touch with that part of us that makes us alive--our soul. Although the term "soul" means different things to different people, Moore's multifaceted definition that encompasses mystery, uncertainty, wonder and beauty resonated very deeply within me. At several points I stopped and realized the myriad ways, in collusion with the daily world around me, I work at cross-purposes to my soul. This is an intriguing, helpful book that I will read again.

So many thoughts to ponder and reflect on in regard to my soul and whether the life I'm living is making it thrive.Room for my soulfulness, I'd say.Moore takes us by the hand and urges us to explore our own deep waters, the hidden and obscure dimensions of our inner lives and the ebb and flow, or confinements, of our souls, individually as well as socially and culturally.I'd be happy to sometime follow Moore on another journey into the Unknown.
I absolutely loved this book. Moore as a theologian and psychologist mixes the depth of the Soul with examples from modern-day cases, scripture and mythology. I was blown away from his breath of knowledge in history, astrology, religion, the arts, etc. This book is thought provoking and, I daresay, after reading...you'll look at things differently.
