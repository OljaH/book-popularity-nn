Excellent essays from two of the foremost scholars on psychology and mythology.
Carl Jung's essay on the function of the Divine Child was enjoyable to read.
Kerenyi, on Kore was excellent.
The book gets somewhat dry, but there is plenty of good treasures hidden if your prepared to do the hard work.
The Chapter on Kore, is a good read if anyone is interested in the idea of the trinity.
The threefold functions of the Greek maiden goddesses as explained by Kerenyi was enlightening to say the least.
It was also interesting to read another view point concerning the Eleusinian Mysteries.
This is a collaborative work by C.G. Jung, the polymathic psychiatrist, and Károly Kerényi, the classical philologist, each of them having written commentaries from the perspectives of their respective disciplines.
Kerényi and Jung. This floats my boat in ways I can't describe.
I read these essays very slowly, excepting them heavily. It was worth reading them for over 1.5 years. I read them as stories about us, our humanity, with a focus on the things we have lost in the wake of our cultural development. Development is not only about shedding backward and useless elements but also about losing precious things. Humanity's mythological mindset was one of them. Jung and Kerényi do some serious mental digging to uncover some of that buried treasure.
The book contains essays which approach the subject from slightly different directions.
