Scott FitzgeraldFrancis Scott Key Fitzgerald, an American writer, published his collection of short stories, All the Sad Young Men after the fame of his most popular novel, The Great Gatsby where the author has used the same themes of flapper and Jazz age, where the rich men and women had the time of their lives without giving a care about other people around them.
If Fitzgerald's long-length novels like The Great Gatsby or This Side of Paradise have allured you with his eloquent and exquisite writing style and prose, then you must look away from his short stories collection All the Sad Young Men  where the stories no doubt reflect that unmatched flair of Fitzgerald but lacks emotions or depth from the story lines.
Great short stories, one a day in my lunch break. If you can't get enough of the Great Gatsby these are great bite size chunks for dessert.
Fitzgerald suggests: romance and beauty exist only as fleeting moments and glittering illusions; once their spell breaks, there is melancholy.
So just like last September, I found myself reading Fitzgerald short stories as summer packed its bags.
The first time I've read any of his work in one of the original selections, rather than a collection curated later, and as such a far better illustration of how patchy he could be; some of the stories here, while fundamentally sketches for Gatsby, are sublime.
But others are moralistic claptrap which would be at home in the People's Friend, the sort of maddening stuff that makes me realise why American literary short stories took against twists, and indeed plots, for so long.
Uşor melodramatică(probabil e propice pentru epoca respectivă) această incursiune - cu răzlețe metafore pentru atmosferă - în scurte dar concise povestioare a unor vremuri strălucitoare şi suflete deznădăjduite. Fitzgerald are abilitatea de a stârni un fior în sufletul cititorului avid de căutare a echilibrului, împlinirii, pe fondul unor apăsătoare idealuri care incetează să dea un suflu nou personajelor, tocmai pentru că, aceste idealuri, sunt atât de departe, dificil de atins şi pricinuiesc mai degrabă apariții fantomatice.
He was suffering from marital and financial problems and that showed a great deal upon his words.Two of the most famous tales, the beautifully elegiac ‘The Rich Boy’ and ‘Winter Dreams’, deal with wealthy protagonists – the old-money Anson Hunter and the self-made man Dexter Green – as they come to terms with lost love; while ‘Absolution’, in which a boy confesses to a priest, was initially written as a background piece to The Great Gatsby.Except one or two stories, the rest are mildly fulfilling and engaging enough to continue reading this book till the very last page.But all in all, the book was for me an extra nice bite into the world of one of the greatest American writers_ Fitzgerald's delectable slice of literature.
I just felt like reading Fitzgerald, so rather than picking up Gatsby again I thought I'd give this short story collection a go. As expected, it was full of sad, kinda whiny wealthy boys and I really enjoyed most of the stories. Not quite as dazzling or amazing as Gatsby but still had that Fitgerald flair that I love!
“I am five years.”
I enjoyed this collection of short stories.
TRE STELLE E MEZZAL’attenzione dell’autore inizia a spostarsi dai “belli e dannati” agli young men che stanno diventando uomini, che hanno un velo di tristezza, che vedono sfuggir loro il sogno dalle mani come sabbia, che hanno a che fare per la prima volta con i debiti, i figli, le difficoltà del matrimonio.[…]… una raccolta che è estremamente unitaria e pensata…[…]E la raccolta è un unico libro su una generazione, sui sogni di quella generazione e, per quanto ci riguarda, sulle molte connessioni che essi hanno coi nostri sogni e con quelli di ogni altra epoca, quando si giunge alla linea d’ombra.
His chapters of being a young man in his realest sense is better than the boys around.I love how I dealt with Fitz!To all the sad young men, which involves Mr. Bounce (he knows himself), I'll always remember you by this one.
Such a lovely tale, for the future.“He wanted to care, and he could not care.
Even the grief he could have borne was left behind in the country of youth, of illusion, of the richness of life, where his winter dreams had flourished.”“December tumbled like a dead leaf from the calendar.” Love,Taymara
3.5'Let me tell you about the very rich. They are different from you and me.'Heartbreak, money, loneliness, boredom, deception, violence, frivolity, sexism and disappointment. I didn't particularly like the first two stories (which revolved too much around a rich man or rich woman screwing over other people) but the other stories they grew on me. 'The baby party', 'Absolution', 'Rags Martin-Jones and the Pr-nce of W-les', 'Hot and Cold Blood', "The Sensible Thing" and 'Gretchen's Forty winks' were engaging, entertaining and at times alarming. Still, they did not reach the standard of 'The Great Gatsby'.
Scotty's original collection of short stories from 1922 is long out of print, but worth borrowing from your local library. A favorite story of mine is "The Baby Party".
"Ba mi-aș găsi starea dacă femeile ar fi altfel, protestă el. Dacă n-aș ști atâtea lucruri despre ele, dacă femeile nu te-ar strica de tot, ca să nu le placi și altora, dacă ar avea măcar puțină mândrie... Dacă aș putea să trag un pui de somn și să mă trezesc într-o casă care să fie cu adevarat a mea. Pentru asta sunt eu făcut, Paula, și asta au văzut în mine femeile care m-au plăcut. Atâta doar că nu mai pot trece de uvertură."
Shame the edition I read had two missing stories. My biggest issue is the way women are written to be only the possessions of men. Because of this archetype I found all the protagonists very unlikable and could not care or engage with their stories. A product of its time, perhaps. But even then most men did not actually see the world that way.
Alltid svårt att betygsätta novellsamlingar...Vissa fantastiska. Andra mer skissartadeförövningar till Gatsby...
The first two stories are very beautiful (5*), the others are less gatsby-esque and less emotionally uplifting (3*), so i'd say 4* in general.
hate the capitalist😂
My favorite is "The rich boy". One cannot be more economical with the language to describe intimate relationships. To expose human soul to love as the ultimate emotion, regardless of social status or wealth.
A friend read 'The Great Gatsby', loved it, and recommended it to me.
Yup, just as I thought.Although I found pretty much all the characters unlikeable, I did enjoy reading the book.
Fitzgerald has a very smooth style of writing that made me gobble up the stories so quickly.
But his writing style is separate from his characters.
From what I read about him, his writing is largely autobiographical; the women he writes are selfish, demanding, and cold.
Some of these stories were written as Fitzgerald was developing the plot of 'The Great Gatsby' so they carried similar themes and characters.
This is the third collection of short stories FSF published and per his usual pattern, followed shortly after the publication of his third novel, The Great Gatsby.
This particular version of All the Sad Young Men did not include Hot and Cold Blood and The Adjuster, and they unfortunately are not available in any other collection.
I would recommend the Cambridge Edition of All the Sad Young Men. I would have rated this a "5"if it would have had the other two stories in it, assuming they were up the the same standards as the 7 that were included.
This is the second Fitzgerald i've read and as a compilation of novellas it is good but not mind-blowing or anything.
He has a very distinct writing style which became a lot more apparent after reading this.
I don't know if this is written before or after The Great Gatsby but I felt like this was a pre-written and that it lead on to become that great novel.
But I liked it quite well anyhow.
But I liked it quite well anyhow.
If you have read The Great Gatsby or are planning to read it, don't bother with this one.
Sparkling short stories, brilliantly furnished, with subtle undertones of despair and boredom just lurking behind the splendid wallpaper. A few border more dangerously upon the melodramatic ("Gretchen's Forty Winks" and "Rags Martin-Jones"), but vague melodrama being Fitzgerald's flavour of work, this is forgiven. My favourites were "The Rich Boy" and "Absolution", and "The Adjuster", which is the most heartening and optimistic story of the entire collection.
"He wanted to care, and he could not care. For he had gone away and he could never come back any more. The gates were closed, the sun was down, and there was no beauty left but the gray beauty of steel that withstands all time. Even the grief he could have borne was left behind in the country of youth, of illusion, of the richness of life, where his winter dreams had flourished."ALL THE SAD YOUNG MEN
I can't even describe how much I adored this collection of short stories. They were simply amazing - that is all I can say. Laced with his later themes and characters, these stories are a nice little dabble into the world of Fitzgerald without reading a whole book. For anyone who wants to pursue reading Fitzgerald I would advise reading these first as they are simply wonderful and are an excellent introduction to his full-length novels.
Some of the short stories here were fantastic. Some were a little too moralistic. Some just fizzled a little (not a super fizzle - I don't think he ever wrote anything that was a super fizzle???). That being said, every one was beautifully written and effortlessly crafted. The way Fitzgerald uses language is amazing. Definitely five stars for the writing.
At first I didn't really like this book. The prose was nice, but the plot... no. If I grab this book once again, I must remember to skip the firs two stories, because after them everything gets better!Gretchen's Forty Winks was the best, and I also liked The Baby Party. These were unique and had a special kind of humour.
The first couple of stories were a bit too plain and didn't reach out as much as the final few stories. Some of my favourites were Rag Martins and the Pr-nce of W-les, The adjuster and Gretchen's forty winks. Not a big fan of some of the male characters though.
以年轻男女为主角的精彩单元剧。一半的故事有《了不起的盖茨比》的影子：小男孩被高枝上的漂亮小鸟吸引，顶着浪潮拼命划桨；衣着光鲜的年轻女郎明眸顾盼，束发带和尖头高跟鞋都金灿灿的晃眼睛——爱情在他们之间推来搡去，轻率得目不暇给。另一半里的年轻人要柴米油盐得多：妻子埋怨没原则的丈夫借钱给从不还钱的朋友，为妻子跟友人大打出手的丈夫，又打发妻子出门道歉。这些故事发生在乡下教堂里、游轮甲板上、舞池里，一张张面孔走马灯似的，鲜活得有种熟悉感。
The more you read Fitzgerald, the more you come to enjoy him.
