An interesting book/essay by D.H. Lawrence, which addresses human consciousness and unconsciousness from the psychoanalysis lens! The essay, though considered as a small contribution by D.H. Lawrence, shed lights on some interesting areas related to psychoanalysis, such as morality. I particularly loved the chapter addressing psychoanalysis and morality, where he indicates that psychoanalysis is “not here a matter of reform, new morality, it is the life or death of all morality.” It is interesting to read about psychoanalysis, which was considered then a new approach toward understanding human nature and the inner forces that affects his/her behavior.
This is a strange book actually, At first I thought it will be an introduction to psychoanalysis, but no , he starts with some basic ideas from freudian psychoanalysis and the following chapters he presents his views on the unconscious and its origin .Its like psychoanalysis + eastern philosophies of the mind .While I did not like all of his ideas because some of them are really odd , but in general I liked the book . ✨✨✨✨
Interesting ideas of Lawrence presented not as a scholarly text but as an intuitive process written only for fellow believers and not meant to persuade or change the non-believer at all, he said.
