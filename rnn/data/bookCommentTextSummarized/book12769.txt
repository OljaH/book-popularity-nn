The Firm, John GrishamThe Firm is a 1991 legal thriller by American writer John Grisham.
His second book, it was Grisham's first which gained wide popularity; in 1993, it was made into a film starring Tom Cruise and Gene Hackman.
Grisham's first novel, A Time to Kill, came into prominence afterwards due to this novel's success.تاریخ نخستین خوانش: روز دوم ماه اکتبر سال 1998 میلادیعنوان: شرکت؛ نویسنده: جان گریشام؛ مترجم: مرجان رزم آرا؛ تهران، سپنج، 1373؛ در 572 ص؛ چاپ دوم 1375؛ موضوع: داستانهای نویسندگان امریکایی - سده 20 معنوان: شرکت؛ نویسنده: جان گریشام؛ مترجم: فریده مهدوی دامغانی؛ تهران، البرز، 1373؛ در 631 ص؛ چاپ دوم 1376؛ چاپ دیگر: 1395؛ در 636 ص؛ شابک: 9644420594؛با اقتباس از این رمان، فیلمی به کارگردانی «سیدنی پولاک» و بازی «تام کروز» و نیز سریالی تلویزیونی در بیست و دو قسمت ساخته شده است.
Sorry to say but I found this book overly long and, at times, a bit pedantic.Mitch McDeere has an IQ that’s off the Richter scale and has just finished a law degree at Harvard Uni and managed to come in third in his class.A small, by New York standards, legal firm in Memphis woes Mitch to join the firm.
So with this carrot in front of him Mitch joins the firm.
So much for his high IQ.After a few months Mitch is approached by the FBI who tell him that the firm is a front for a ruthless Mafia family.
Grisham writes great, down-to-earth dialogue that forms characters into real people.
For example, the main character, Mitchell McDeere tells his wife she has to do all this stuff to hide from both the Mob and the FBI, run here, change this, do that.
If you don’t know the plot, or haven’t seen the movie or read the book: Mitchell McDeere comes out of law school top of his class, and he knows what he wants.
This book was fantastic!
My husband said he'd read it years ago and it was one of the best books he'd ever read.
The premise drew you in- everyone that works hard wants an offer like the one Mitch McDeere is offered by the Firm.
He is so clever, which is awesome because you think there's no way he can get out of it.The storyline is gripping.
I see why this book put Grisham on the map.
Recommend it to anyone that wants to get sucked into a book!
I loved it!!!Mitchell McDeere is a graduate from Harvard, young and having a lot of offers from ever
The choice that Mitch makes along these lines wasn't resolved satisfactorily in my view although I appreciated the fact that he wasn't able to just forget about what he had done.I found it interesting that all of these people are basically chasing money in one form or another and yet none are able to enjoy it because of the circumstances.
1 Timothy 6 vs 10.Reading this I was reminded again of the meaninglessness of life without God regardless of status, wealth, job security or anything else....Recommended for those who enjoy Grisham books.
My grandfather, a former lawyer, happened to mention it in a conversation a couple months ago, so the title was on my mind.My main impression is that this is the kind of pulp that no one will read 100 years from now (thank goodness).
I don't think John Grisham is or was especially unenlightened...I think he just faithfully represented the cultural norms and popular attitudes.(This might be a tangent, but if I really wanted to understand what life was like in a previous era, I would look first at its advertising and its advice columns.
At times seemingly very realistic.
5 starsI first read this a long time ago. 🇺🇸
On of my favorite books ever.
There is the elderly, sly, unctuous Oliver Lambert who is exposed early as a sick depraved man – also a lawyer.
As he is referred to: “he said you were a real nice man.
Great eyes.
Unforgettable eyes.
Sinister eyes…He had without a doubt, the most ominous evil presence Mitch had ever felt.
It was the eyes…”Yes, we have a gallery of assorted lawyers in this work, also including the rather pathetic Avery, who also reiterates to Mitch the sinister nature of the “legal firm” here: ‘The rules never change.
Kudos to her as she is arguably the real hero(ine) of this excellent novel.
DNF at p.64Whenever I have problems, I resort to reading fiction.
This usually seems to assuage the pain that is reality, but sometimes it doesn't work.
Sometimes the plot is so banal and unexciting that you just put your book down, stare at the ceiling, and think about every single thing that can possibly go wrong over the next sixty years.So I only started reading this because I can't handle seeing a movie first if it's based on a book.And my parents want to see the movie adaptation of this with me because apparently it's amazing.
The dialogue was sloppy and the plot was nothing great.
I read this over the course of a month and then read "A Time to Kill" at the pool that summer.
It was the first time I had ever paced myself in my reading and it was like torture.
:-)I am not sure why this wasn't in my book [glad I saw somone's review so I could add it], but it was truly one of my most favorite books for the longest time [IF you love this book, steer VERY clear of the movie - W T HECK were they thinking?] and even now I love returning to it.
It's been a while I have read a John Grisham novel.
And  The Firm  provided a good opportunity for me to get back the world of Grisham and his legal thrillers.
A young ambitious lawyer is approached by a small law firm with a fantastic job offer and perks that he could only dream of.
I really enjoyed the story line, even though at times, it was a little far fetched.
But Mitch McDeere is one of the most bold, smart and resourceful character that I have come across in a Grisham work so far.
Overall, I really liked this legal thriller by John Grisham.
Classic everyone is familiar with.
I just want to note how refreshing it was, in this day and age, to read complex legal thriller (although basic idea is very simple), without intrusion of words like cellphone, email, Internet, hacker, alias, virus and all the complications and simplifications in plot that come with it.
In this book, you have to "wait by the phone", it's absolutely crucial for things not to go bonkas.
Phone boots are little tin houses of salvation.
No phone in every pocket, or any for that matter.
So what's one left with in this book, without all the stupid gadgets and copier machine being the highest tech?
Mindgames!
Which is also kind of a mindgame, I guess.
I forgot all about Grisham when I putting in the crap books - thanks Conrad.
Summer of '92, we were staying in a cabin off Devil's Lake in Michigan near my aunt's; I finished off the books I'd read and was unable to convince anyone in my family to play "D-Day To the Rhine", the WW2 strategy game I bought in Anarbor, but luckily my aunt had stocked our cabin with a whole slew of Grisham.I think I read this in a day, and since the last paragraph was pure memoir that has nothing to do with the novel, that should tell you how much I remember of it.
Beach book extradinaire.
It was a well-written, complex legal thriller that kept me intrigued down to the last-minute.To be perfectly honest, I did think the middle part was a tad tedious and dragging.
I was expecting it to be a lot more nail-biting.Don’t get me wrong – there were a lot of thrilling scenes here and there in the book.
I would have liked a bit more intense “race against time” feels in the pursuit scene in the latter part of the book, too.
Was I asking too much?All in all, I think this is a great, solid legal thriller from John Grisham.
I don't know why I waited so long to read a John Grisham novel.
I've always liked his movies, and one of my favorites was always THE FIRM with Tom Cruise.
This is my first novel of his to read, and man, was it intense!
It was an awesome mystery.
I wouldn't be surprised if a lot of what happened in the book actually happens in real life either.
The last half of the book was so intense, my heart rate went up!
I think any adult would like this story.
I'm going to read more of his stories for sure.
Honestamente todavía no tengo claro el aporte de un escritor de Best-Sellers como John Grisham al estado del arte, sin embargo hay que reconocerle que sus obras envejecen bien y, sino fuera por la desactualización de los montos de dinero, diría que tienen se pueden leer como si fuesen escritas ayer.Mitchell McDeere es un joven y talentoso abogado que es contratado por una pequeño, pero muy generoso estudio, justo después de egresar de Harvard.
Bien para la playa, no para que le abra una visión distinta del mundo.
I just could not buy into the setup of the book, and never once identified with the main character, Mitch McDeere.
I felt like every single thing he did in the book, I would do differently.The book starts out with Mitch getting a job offer to the relatively small law firm Bendini, Lambert, and Locke.
In a book full of slimy criminal lawyers, it is not good that the main protagonist usually seems just as loathsome.Overall, this seemed like a pretty standard legal thriller book.
I was quite immersed into the ambiance the book established within the first 100 pages.
And the fact that something very shady is definitely going on with this firm.
I was flipping through the pages eager to discover where the story would lead.
After discovering that all is not what it seems, Mitch is consistently one step ahead of the antagonistic firm , outsmarting them (and later the FBI) at every turn.
It eventually became easy to predict how the book would end.However, the prose was quite competent and the novel was overall pretty enjoyable.
What a great read!
Enjoyed this one even if I am 20 years behind!
Look forward to seeing the movie as well.
I am sure everyone knows the story so I will say I almost figured I would just watch the movie but this book was my favorite Grisham since I read "A Time to Kill" when it originally came out.
It was an exciting read that kept you wanting to keep reading to see what this poor young couple would be put through next!
If you are a couple decades behind like me then definitely read and enjoy this one!

Just got the audio. I loved this story in high school and this was a very pleasant walk down memory lane. Scott Brick has a pleasant speaking voice and adds emotion to the narration in ask the right places. His accents were okay, but I wish he'd done more to differentiate the character voices. 4 stars for narration.
"The Firm" kept me wanting to know how it will end, and isn't it the purpose of a good thriller ?
Great book, probably closer to the truth than many of us would like to believe. A fast paced thriller about corruption and the evil lure of money, protected by a secrecy that is lethal. This was the book that gave Grisham the golden key to fame, when Paramount bought the film rights.Believe it or not, haven't seen the film yet, but it's on my to-do list

Страхотна. Майстор е Гришам.
The movie is much better, leaner, tighter, more realistic.
There were so many unbelievable plot points that I started taking notes (definitely spoilers though I don't think I recommend the book anyway):1.
The main character Mitch's reactions to, and interactions with, the FBI, were also completely unbelievable: he is dictating terms to them?
The whole book had a weird anti-FBI bent that felt more like the author's personal vendetta than a legit political point (i.e., that you can't trust them)4.
The whole idea that Mitch was outsmarting the FBI and taking advantage of them was stupid.That is more discussion than a Grisham book that I read in 3 days really warrants, but there you have it.
