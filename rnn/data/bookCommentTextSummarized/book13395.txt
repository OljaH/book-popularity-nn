As the first sentence of the story starts out, "I am doomed to remember a boy with a wrecked voice...", well, I am, too.***SPOILERS FROM THIS POINT ON IN THE REVEIW***I think I fell in love with book as I read one specific sentence.
At the same time I realized the purpose of "the shot", it also hit home how Owen had lived his entire life for that momemt.
Just as Owen had lived his life for one specific point and time, the power of this story was revealed to me in one perfect sentence.
“I am doomed to remember a boy with a wrecked voice. Not because of his voice, or because he was the smallest person I ever knew, or even because he was the instrument of my mother's death, but because he is the reason I believe in God.” I've opted for the 3-star approach, but you shouldn't give it much weight where this book is concerned. Some people are really hung up on ratings - does it really only deserve 1 star? you seemed to like it, why not 5 stars? - when in truth, this book is so comp
In A Prayer for Owen Meany, the narrator is John Wheelwright but he fades into the background, offering a perspective that at times feels like third-person.
John's running criticisms of America and American life manifest in ways big and small - the "big" being assassinations and the Vietnam War, the "small" being such as his mother's death by a baseball, an important American symbol.It's not the kind of book you read for enjoyment (or I personally don't think so, but then I never fully got that guy in college who refused to go to any social events because he wanted to read Marcel Proust), but it is the kind you save for when you want a clever, thoughtful read with many layers and themes to uncover.
Even if he was the only one to seem to know why things happened the way they did.He had sunk the shot in under four seconds!"YOU SEE WHAT A LITTLE FAITH CAN DO?" said Owen Meany.
Despite everything that he endures, Owen Meany never loses his faith, his knowledge that he is an INSTRUMENT OF GOD, as he reminds Johnny on many occasions.
Owen touches everyone in some small way, leading up to his grand fulfillment.A Prayer for Owen Meany is one of my favorite books, and many other's that I have lent it to have found a fondness for the story as well.
The creator of stories moves his characters to the grand finale with a purpose, and the reader knows it and cries and laughs anyway.In my adolescence, I went through a John Irving phase, reading most of his tragicomedy novels in one go, loving his sad humour, his strange plots, his social message and his unique characterisation.
I can still hear the voice of Owen, and feel his incredible determination.
The airport scene still breaks my heart, the sheer beauty of the practised sacrifice is just "l'art pour l'art" at its best.When the narrator sums up his doom, I feel with him:"I am doomed to remember a boy with a wrecked voice.
First of all, I think Irving has a habit of using his novel's narrators as a stand in for himself, which is fine, since he seems like and incredibly interesting dude, but here I felt like he was just going through the motions "Oh, ok, here's my main character, and he's different than me, uh, because we have different names and um...different parents...anyway, yeah, that's how we're different ok story time now!!!" it was a thin disguise at best and didn't work for me at all.
I read it in high school, thanks to my favorite English teacher, Mrs. B, who had written down the title on a Post-It note and said, "You need to read this." I immediately went and found a copy and had it finished it by the end of the week.
It is the story of two boys in New Hampshire in the 1950s: the narrator is Johnny Wheelwright, whose family is wealthy; and his friend, Owen Meany.
It's a laugh-out-loud disaster, and almost every year at Christmastime I'll pull out this book and reread the chapter.When the boys turn 18, the Vietnam War is escalating and Owen signs up for the Reserve Officers Training Corps, which will pay for his college tuition while he serves.
He takes upwards of four years to write these fucking things, and reading them back-to-back only highlights the little repetitive details that an author will forget about in four-plus years.
But, if you're only here to tell me how wrong I am about your favorite book, or that I should shut up and write books instead of reviewing them, I will kindly ask you right now to stay the fuck off my grass.I know I'm the enemy of some of you simply because I am an author.
If I shit on your favorite books, it's because I didn't like them, not because I think I'm better than anyone else.
I'm sure you can read a million reviews about this book.
It seems to be many people's favorite.
Let me just say that I have read 5 or 6 John Irving books, and this is the only one that is much more than a good story.
He said that A prayer for Owen Meany had more to say about the nature of God than anything he had ever read.
I am basically an atheist, without the anti-god feeling that sometimes implies, yet despite our religious differences, we took exactly the same things away from this story.
Most of the book consists of John narrating his childhood and telling the story of Owen Meany.
The Reverend Louis Merrill also seems to be a more important character than his relatively small role would suggest, and his self-admitted personal philosophy is the paradoxical "doubt as the essence of faith." In one of the more ironic passages of the book (slight spoiler warning...), Rev. Merrill's doubt is finally dispelled not through the miraculous events surrounding Owen Meany, but through a very mundane and spiteful prank.The problem is that none of the book's myriad of themes and symbols was particularly interesting to me.
It’s a while since I finished this book – I felt I just needed a little time to gather my thoughts on it; there’s a lot to take in.
The two main characters are Johnny Wheelwright (through whose voice the tale is told) and his best friend Owen Meany.
I know we all experience these things in our own way and I’ve no doubt some will be frustrated and switched-off by elements I found compelling here, but I’d urge anyone who fancies a thoughtful and possibly memorable journey through the lives of two people growing up to grab a copy of this book.
Owen Meany is coming from a blue-collar background, a dysfunctional family, yet he is assertive, determined, charismatic, despite his diminutive size and his piping loud voice.John Wheelwright is the narrator, from the perspective of an old man remembering in extensive flashbacks the events of his childhood and youth, events dominated by the personality of his friend Owen Meany.
Trough John and Owen, Irving proposes a rebirth of Christianity not by following the old dogma, but by telling new stories, better adapted to our modern culture.
I might need to come back and write a longer review after I've thought about this book for a while because there is definitely a lot to ponder.
It's a 600+ page book that I never fully loved, but I never wanted to stop reading it.
Objectively, I think this book is really smart and thoughtful and 'good' (whatever that means).
This review is not going to make a lot of sense because I don't think I've made sense of my feelings towards this one yet.
You've got to want to read it and appreciate slow, more thoughtful stories that take a long time to develop.
*** 5 ***A buddy read with the most beloved Judy!!! Owen Meany was a gift!!!
The member of Johnny’s family that launched the initial part of the plot was his mom.
Owen, who rarely got to play, and even more rarely got to try for anything but a walk, hit a foul ball that ended up killing Johnny’s mom.
(As another aside, I wonder why, in the interest of gender equality, there’s no such word as “matrician”.) Though less privileged than most, Owen became a big-shot at the private school that Johnny’s family arranged for him to attend.
So I’ll reiterate what an extraordinary character Irving gives us with Owen.
I'm so glad they released 'A Prayer for Owen Meany: A Novel' for Kindle. I would have read it eventually otherwise, but I read this in the midst of multiple flights almost back to back. There were minor things that kept me from giving this five stars, but they are typical of John Irving's writing style.All in all, I loved this book.
*3.75/5*WHAT A JOURNEY THAT WAS. I may write a longer review later, but basically this book was amazing, a bit too much focus on religion for me personally, but overall I really enjoyed it. This book has a lot of the same elements that The Goldfinch has, so I recommend giving this a try if you enjoyed that book, but some things just didn't 100% click for me. This is one of those books I feel like everybody should read though, because Owen Meany is an entirely unique character, and one that everybody needs to know about.
This was back when John Irving was at the top of his game! OWEN MEANY is in my top 20 novels of all time.
irving has a kind of roundness and soulfulness on the one hand that really brings you into the characters.
this makes the fullness of his characters so much more rich and rewarding.also, i have never met an author who can deal with death without, again, descending into the most familiar psychological, analytical, or sentimental formulae.
having read a few irving novels, i now know that death is, in his world, always potentially around the corner.
there is something unrelenting in this part of irving's world; and that makes you trust him as a reader.
This book is about faith and its opposite, doubt.
It’s about people who look for something outside themselves to give themselves faith, in a higher power, in others, in themselves.Of the John Irving books I’ve read, it’s probably the most fully realized.
At times, critics have called Irving’s writing Dickensian and for once that description holds water.
The amount of quirkiness apparent in Irving’s earlier novels has been reduced.
Likewise, Irving has written a darkly humorous novel that at times (the first half or so) is laugh out loud funny.
But then, that’s probably the point and that approach worked for Fitzgerald in The Great Gatsby (see Nick Carraway).
I unfortunately picked up this book for the first time as I was leaving for a vacation at my friend's house...
And I don't really regret it, because it marked a moment in time, a turning point for me.
I think it has something to do with the fact that wonderful fiction (for me) highlights a moment in time when extraordinary things happen to not-necessarily extraordinary people who are forced to react in extraordinary ways.
This book takes that theory and turns it on its head.
This book is about an utterly ordinary man to whom extraordinary things give the finger, passing him over for his utterly extraordinary friend.
" I am doomed to remember a boy with a wrecked voice-not because of his voice,or because he was the smallest person I ever knew,or even because he was the instrument of my mother's death,but because he is the reason I believe in God; I am a Christian because of Owen Meany."That is the opening lines of the novel,and aptly describes what the book is about.
You know that book you've had on your shelf, like forever,and you just never got around to it, for some unknown reason?
This book is no exception.I know I've read on here that some people didn't like this one....and others loved it.
With over 200,000 reviews on this modern classic I'm thinking a rating should suffice but will add my thoughts.
From my viewpoint too long-winded in sections, yet so worth the ride.
It requires patience from the reader as we follow them through their decades of love and loss on a miraculous journey to where the great unknown calls them.
But when it was all said and done, I loved most of it.
Best savored and appreciated at a slow and thoughtful reading pace.
Should I live long enough, I will read it again someday.
At the end, however, I came to think that, a) Owen had basically ruined his best friend's life, and b) God (or at least John Irving) had really messed up with his big plan for Owen.The second point first.
Irving does a great job reminding the readers how powerful a figure a high school leader can be.Then you get to the climax and we find the meaning of Owen's fate.
At any rate, what little life force the narrator has seems to be concentrated on thoughts of his friend -- he saw Owen's potential but not his own.
This friendship not only survives but becomes even closer following a tragedy, which happens right at the beginning of the novel: Owen hits a baseball that strikes Johnny's mother and kills her.
The story begins in the early 1950s, follows the two through the 1960s, and is interspersed with remarks from John written in 1987.
Much of the story meditates on faith, doubt, and religion.
The book is almost a meditation on what faith is (and what it's not).
Owen himself can be very funny.At one point, Irving quotes Hardy as saying that a storyteller is like the Ancient Mariner and must have a story worth stopping people to listen to.
But as the story progressed it became bogged down with an over abundance of details, facts and political and religious opinions and at times I found myself totally switching off and longing to get back to the story I started.I really felt so divided about whether I loved or hated this novel, I loved the humour and the sadness in the novel, I enjoyed the characters, I loved the sense of time and place that John Irving managed to create by his vivid writing.
I knew from the beginning that this was going to be a great story, and I kind of devoured its 700 pages, but at the same time, I kept wondering why that was?
This book deals with themes and a time period that I'm not very familiar with.
The time period was very vague to me, and I'm sure that an older reader would benefit more than me from reading this story.
John Irving tells this story as a coming-of-age narrative, and I think that's what impressed me the most.
That's because of Irving's writing style and way of telling a story which might not appeal to everyone.
This is quite possibly my favorite book of all time. I think that it is Irving at his best. There are events set out early on in the book that tie back in at the end beautifully. I finished this book on the bus from Mont st. Michelle and cried my eyes out. The characters were just believable enough and yet still stretched the bounds of what you would expect. I hope that someday I find a stuffed armadillo...
4.5 Stars. Although somewhat tedious at times, definitely an amazing and unforgettable story. Owen, with his unusual voice and diminutive size is a gifted, emotional, and peculiar character with a commanding presence. Highly recommend for those with the time (600+ pages and a bit of patience)
John Irving's writing was terrible and his rambling, seemingly unedited style was the death of A Prayer for Owen Meany.
Irving is good at foreshadowing and there was definitely humor in the novel, especially in the character of Grandmother Wheelwright, John's stubborn grandmother.
Irving would go out of his way to make it clear that the only purpose of the female characters in this novel was to be sexual objects (unless they were over sixty, like Grandmother Wheelwright).
Irving would spend paragraphs ranting about each female characters breasts and would go out of his way to make sexual references about the women in the story.
