Haunted read! a bit long but the storyline was scary good and very intense (paperback!)
Being a Stephen King fan is kind of like being a geek for Dragonlance or comic books - reviewing his work seems borderline pointless because non-fans will usually dismiss him out of hand and be hard to convince of any intrinsic value, and fans are already pretty hardcore about him.
Nevertheless, I wanted to add this specific Stephen King book to my "all time faves" shelf for three reasons:1.
Among King's books, this one is lesser known (hasn't been made into a movie or mini-series, isn't usually on people's Top 5 lists, etc.)3.
I am enjoying what I think is perhaps Stephen King’s best novel, ever.The opinion on Stephen King’s best work differs depending on who you talk to; but for me, it will always be Bag of Bones.It’s the one novel of Kings that I’ve read more than any other (nine times) and each time it’s just as wonderful and beautiful and engaging as it was the first time I opened up my hardcover copy ten years ago.I think it was the beginning of King moving away from horror and toward a more literary style of writing.

I was a big Stephen King fan back in the 7th grade, mainly because it was my first experience with books written for adults.
Bag of Bones really caught my interest though, and I found it to be much better than many of his other books because of the way it deals so much with plain human emotion, loss and life.
Like his novel Pet Sematary, Bag of Bones has a main theme of overwhelming grief, as the main character tries to move on from the death of a loved one, finding it impossible.
He also creates a vivid setting and very realistic characters.
That's the emotion that got to me the most during this reread.The first time I read this book I had just turned thirty and even though I was already married, the horror of losing a spouse didn't get through to me like it did this time.
But there is no question that we DO hate him, and there again, the King has manipulated our emotions and has his Constant Readers, and all other readers, in the palms of his skilled, talented hands.I loved this book.
It's not annoyingly long, but I feel a few questions could have been edited out in the beginning half of the book so that we didn't have to sit around for twenty pages reading about two men chatting over whiskey about what happened in the past 710 pages.
By clicking on "view spoiler" you agree that you've read King's entire catalogue and will not hold me responsible for things being ruined because you're too damn inquisitive.
Trust me, the shit hidden here is only interesting if you have read all of King's books.(view spoiler)[Obvious Tie-ins:Thad Beaumont (The Dark Half), oddly enough this is the novel wherein we learn of Thad's suicide.
"Grief is like a drunken house guest, always coming back for one more goodbye hug."Bag of Bones focuses on the story of Mike Noonan, a best-selling writer who's wife unexpectedly passes away.
Mike decides he must help the young mother and daughter, but other sinister forces are also at work...I truly believe that no one can depict grief like King can.
Bag of Bones opens with Mike Noonan trying to cope following the unexpected death of his wife Johanna to a brain aneurysm, and these opening scenes are just heartbreaking to read.
When I agreed to do a buddy read it was because of its connection to Moon and the Sixpence and the recommendation of my favorite and greatest of all Mah Fahs, Stepheny.
Problem is there’s a custody battle brewing for the child involving the kid’s grandfather, who’s a crazy, stone-throwing evil old coot.Plus, the summer house is haunted – brimming to the rafters with ghosts.What works here are the characterizations and the palpable love story between Mike and his long dead wife, it rises off the page and grabs you on a visceral level.
“The muses are ghosts, and sometimes they come uninvited.” A very good ghost story.Stephen King’s 1999 novel about a lonely hamlet in western Maine is told with King’s rare gift for telling these kinds of stories.
Drawing inspiration from earlier novels The Shining and Pet Sematary, King draws Noonan into a web of old mysteries tied to present day conflict.Well-crafted and told by a master, this was a page turning and entertaining book.
(view spoiler)[From my original reading, I did remember that the ghostly part of the story somehow revolved around a black woman (Sara Tidwell) who was murdered and whose child was murdered and the whole thing later hushed up by the largely white town.
And while, on the one hand, I don't think that King, in text or without, condones what happens to Sara Tidwell, her son or the rest of the Tidwells, at the same time, the story is set up so that Sara's revenant and vengeful spirit is the ultimate villain of the piece, a monster that has to be vanquished by the (white) (male) (middle-aged) hero of the piece, largely to save the life of a beautiful, blue-eyed, blonde haired little girl.

This is King's strongest novel of the new millennium. In fact, it's excellent. Good enough to join THE SHINING, SALEM'S LOT, and CHRISTINE as some of King's best work ever. Everything works to King-like perfection in BAG OF BONES. Pacing, character, story, plot flow, and horror are all masterfully handled by the master himself. It isn't overly long and in need of editing either. Highly recommended
It's a book about loss and grief, but also a suspenseful mystery with a super spooky atmosphere, set in a creepy, unincorporated and sparesely populated fading resort community with a dark historic past.
The mystery and the hauntings are linked in with a child custody battle, complete with a nefarious old villain, and a damsel in distress.
At the center of it all is Mike Noonan, a troubled best-selling writer (naturally), who is greiving the sudden loss of his deeply beloved, spunky number one fan, his wife, and, he has reason to believe, their unborn child.
Meh.
Like a 21 year old girl, the daughter of two alcoholics, who practically raised herself, and who quit highschool when she got pregnant, and now reshelves books at the library for $100/week and can barely afford to keep her trailer saying, "I apologize about calling in the first place - it's a presumption." It's just awkward.
She died on the first page of the book, and yet she had such an active place in his life, and I loved her character.
I loved this book, and despite my criticisms, I think it's right up there among King's best.
736 pages, so not King's longest book but still a doorstop. I enjoyed it very much anyway and it was certainly a page turner. This is one of his ghostly, horror type stories and at times it was very spooky and frequently very gory. In fact very Stephen King. Not the best book I have read by him but still very worthy of 4 stars.
Tiene uno de los mejores comienzos que me tocó leer.
Un excelente inicio de novela.El dolor del duelo es como un invitado borracho, cuando parece que se ha marchado vuelve a darte un último abrazo.Ya en la mitad las cosas se empiezan a poner un poco pesadas y repetitivas.
Sin embargo, el misterio que le dotó a esta historia King me hizo imposible despegarme de las páginas en ningún momento.
En mi opinión es uno de los finales más espeluznantes de King.En definición, un muy buen libro de uno de mis autores favoritos.
For the first 450 pages or so I kept thinking that it was by leaps and bounds the best Stephen King book ever.
But then things got strange in a way that only King's novels can and I was left feeling like maybe I'd been in a car accident but had blacked out and couldn't really remember the whole thing properly.
I think that you either like Stephen King's stuff or you don't.
I need to spice this up!" My only other complaint is that I didn't feel like the story was finished although the book ended.
I quit halfway through, switched to an action novel which cleared my head and allowed me to continue the laborious trudge.The best thing about this novel, aside from reaching the end (660 pages… it could have been pared back to 450 and I would have been happy), was its intricacy.
Admittedly, the distractions were significant, but there were still large gaps where Mike could have picked up the puzzle pieces and figured things out.
It neatened things up, removed him from a moral dilemma, and it did feel staged, as though SK couldn’t bring himself to allow this scenario to continue.

Ghosts, you have to love a story filled with ghosts.
3.5 StarsIn Bag of Bones, Mike Noonan, a bestselling author, simultaneously loses his wife Johanna and his ability to write much more than his name.
Soon after, the night terrors begin, involving the couple’s lake house retreat dubbed Sara Laughs after a turn-of-the-century singer, and Noonan realizes the solitary cure lies in the confrontation.
With tremendous trepidation, he faces the demons, which hold both his and Johanna’s inner peace hostage and, in the end, discovers when and why Sara thundered her last laugh.Many critics have suggested King, like Mike Noonan, suffered his own case of writer’s block during the creation of Bag of Bones, a kind of disconnect, pages of prose that imply King operated on autopilot.
Actual 3.5Reflections of Peter Straub's 'Ghost Story' ran through my thoughts as I read this one. And not only did they work together on some novels but King has mentioned how much he admires 'Ghost Story', so maybe...? This was great writing with an interesting plot being weaved to form a masterful picture, but I think it is a picture that brings nothing new to the table and it was too long in the weaving. Bag of Bones was a labor to read but overall was still good.
Probably, for me, the best Stephen King horror novel. I am not easily scared by ghosts and other paranormal entities since they mostly live within the pages of horror fiction. But this one has sections, like the ghost that shuffles the magnets stuck on a freeze, that gave me an instant on-rush of fear-hormones. A brick-sized page turner!
Er vermisst seine Jo, kann nicht mehr schreiben und sucht einen neuen Sinn im Leben, dass ihm momentan so sinnlos erscheint.Immer wieder träumt er von dem Ferienhaus am Dark Score Lake, welches er zusammen mit Jo jeden Sommer besucht hat.
King vermag es in meinen Augen wie kein anderer Schriftsteller seine Leserschaft zu Beginn eines Buches abzuholen und in einen tiefen Sumpf hineinzuziehen, den man erst viel zu spät bemerkt, weil er sich gleichzeitig so gut anfühlt.Das Buch hat drei hauptsächliche Handlungsebenen.
Abschließend bleibt noch zu sagen, dass man auch in diesem Werk Kings wieder viel von ihm selbst und seiner Liebe zu seiner Frau Tabitha spürt.
So easy to identify with, you begin to feel an alarming sense of annoyance and unfairness to some of the situations the characters go through.
Beginning the book with a description of the day his wife died, we meet Mike Noonan, our narrator.
Four years later, Mike is still haunted with guilt and grief-stricken over his loss.
Furthermore, Mike comes across an attractive young widow, Mattie, and her four-year-old daughter, Kyra.
For Mike Noonan, things are about to go from bad to worse.
Bag of Bones is a classic ghost story, allowing the horror to creep up on you.
I wanted to get to a King novel I love before the year’s end, so here we are.This was my third reread of Bag of Bones; this time it hit me deeper than ever before.
Four years after his wife’s death, author Mike Noonan moves from Derry to their summer home in TR-90.
Dealing with writer’s block and haunted by ghosts both physical and metaphorical, it is a period of intense mourning.
This has been a year of mourning, for me, so this particular narrative really hit me hard.
A gorgeous, spacious look at romance and small town life and mourning and loss, this is a King classic.
Every once in a while I need to read a good ghost story.
Whatever the case, Bag Of Bones has everything my old horror buff self needs.
Creepiness and story in the right doses.Of course, like almost every King novel that's over 500 pages, it should be a couple of hundred pages shorter.
What did bother me was the seemingly unavoidable (?) exaggeration of the finale that was far too far-fetched for my taste, as well as a few unbelievable actions of the characters which thankfully weren't enough to destroy the experience.All in all, an honest horror novel that flows smoothly and is pretty good at what it is.
It was recommended to me by my Mom, who's a big Stephen King fan!Bag of Bones is about famous bestselling novelist Mike Noonan, who lost his wife 4 years ago to a car collision.
But Bag Of Bones is written in the 1st person POV, which I don't think it would have been as good if it was in the 3rd person, and since it's written in 1st person, it's like you feel you're right there in the story.Highly recommended to fans of Stephen King!
