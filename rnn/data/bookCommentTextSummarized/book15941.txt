I can't remember if I read these as a kid, but this series is definitely a title I recognize. Even after revisiting it and reading it in one sitting, I still don't remember the story, so it's a gamble if I ever actually read it or not. Nevertheless, it was quick and fun and I'm sure I would've loved it. The story felt disjointed and like there wasn't a relevant storyline until the last few chapters, but it just brought back so much nostalgia even just having this on my bookshelf and reading something from the year 2000 was fun.
They are to make an ‘All About Me’ collage which will include everything about themselves, from their favourite pet to their hobbies, clubs they belong too and what they want to be when they grow up.Together with the help of her friend Rocky the two set out on making their collages, but there are plenty of laughs to have along the way, many down to Stink, Judy’s little brother.I have know about the Judy Moody books for years but never read any, nor have I ever bought any for my children – Big mistake – If this first book is anything to go by these books are hilarious and give you a proper laugh-out-loud experience.
اولین مجموعه داستانی که خودم خوندم؛ دوم دبستان باید اعتراف کنم انقدر جودی رو دوست دارم که هنوز هم گاها کتاباشو ورق میزنم و با دیدن عکساش کلی خاطراتم مرور میشهاین مجموعه بهترین هدیه می تونه واسه یه دختر دبستانی باشه, باشد که به شوق این کتاب ها بوک ورم شه مثل من:)
my review (the Mom's).DAUGHTER SAYS:I think Judy Moody is funny and I would be friends with her in real life.
Boys my age might also like it because Judy's friends are two boys, Rocky and Frank.
I would read the next Judy Moody books.MOM SAYS:At first, I was a bit taken aback by Judy's sassiness toward her teacher.
I think boys in the same age range may like this book as Judy is not a typical girlie-girl and her friends in the book are boys.
Judy thinks this sounds like fun but of course that doesn’t match her mood so she won’t tell anyone she’s looking forward to working on it.In Judy Moody Was in a Mood we also get to meet Judy’s parents and her younger brother Stink who became so popular he got his own spin off series.
Judy is mean to Stink and plays a trick on him in this book but overall the siblings look out for one another.I really enjoyed this reread.
I discovered Judy Moody and Stink at my local library (yay libraries!) almost a year ago and have read all of each series that my library owns.
I was OBSESSED with these books when I was younger, and Maddie found the seven books we had when we were looking through our DVDs and found them stacked behind, so we decided to pull them all out and have a read! They're ridiculously quick to get through, but the nostalgia is real! I feel like Judy Moody was the Phineas and Ferb before Phineas and Ferb. She just does whatever she wants to do, no matter what, she's got ambitions, too, which makes her a great character for young kids to read about! I can't wait to read more!
I am reading this book right now, and it's pretty funny and good.
Mi s-a părut o carte drăguță, toate răutățile, sarcasmul, poreclele și toanele copiilor fiind raportate la viața reală.Micile activități pe care personajele le au și hobby-urile sau aspirațiile lor sunt niște învățăminte bune pentru cei mici, cu toate că în unele pasaje ale cărții nu îți dai seama dacă Judy Moody te învață lucruri de bine.Dacă aș fi avut din nou 8-10 ani, probabil că Judy mi-ar fi devenit o prietenă bună și m-ar fi amuzat și mai mult sarcasmul ei și toate nebuniile pe care le face.
zise Rocky.— Stink, chiar ai găsit o piatră de Lună, zise Judy.— Acum nu mai este o piatră de Lună!
Chapter book - seriesFor 2nd-4th gradeJudy Moody starts 3rd grade and struggles to find a good mood while she deals with her little brother, school projects, and friendships in this funny chapter book.Divided into fairly episodic short chapters, this entertaining read tells the story of how Judy Moody started third grade.
Plenty of illustrations bring Judy's quirky personality to life, and the size and style of the book, combined with plenty of kid humor - make it great for readers who are just getting into chapter books.Booklist's review captures the tone and style of the book while providing enough description to help a librarian with reader's advisory.
Jadi ceritanya begini, Hari Pertama Sekolah, moodnya si Judy nih sangat jelek, pokoknya dia gak mau musim panas berlalu, gak mau nyisir rambut, gak mau mengeja dalam pelajaran bahasa Inggrisnya dan yang bikin bad-bad moodnya adalah duduk disebelah Frank Pearl si pemakan lem.
Tapi sebenernya dia naik bom-bom car dan pergi memancing dan makan ikan hiu, ikan yang dibeli dipasar bersama Ayahnya karena gak berhasil mendapatkan satu ekor ikanpun saat acara memancing.
Intinya Judy merasa liburannya tidak hebat seperti teman-temannya yang keluar kota ke tempat-tempat hebat dan menyenangkan serta bisa memamerkan kaos bergambar tempat tersebut saat hari pertama sekolah.
Jadi, mood jeleknya sedikit terobati.Judy Moody.
Kalo yang dibolongin huruf ‘d’, maka bolongannya hanya ada lima.
Untuk buku yang aku beli dengan harga tujuh ribu.
Yang pasti, ngga sampe sepuluh ribu.Judy Moody.
Tentang kegiatan yang dilakukan Judy dan teman-teman sekelasnya pada bulan-bulan pertama duduk di kelas tiga.
Proyek untuk menggambarkan diri mereka melalui kolase yang berjudul ‘Aku’.
Oh iya, di dalamnya juga ada gambar-gambar yang mendukung cerita.
Hari pertama masuk sekolah, mood-nya memang jelek.
Tapi ternyata, kelas barunya tidak sejelek yang dia bayangkan.
Malah, dari proyek yang diberikan Mr. Todd, dia membentuk sebuah klub rahasia yang bernama Kodok Kencing.
Whenever I feel the pressure of writing my novel, reading books for uni or review, I always retreat back to good old faithful Middle Grade. It makes me want to do a video one all the books I think made me a reader, because this is definitely one of them!

Frank, who eats paste and who gave her five valentines in kindergarten, cupcakes on numerous holidays in first grade, and who indeed is in the seat next to her when she arrives in her third grade classroom, and immediately passes her an invitation to his birthday party.
But there will be a cool collage project all about Judy, a new club that involves toad-holding, and a new perspective on Frank.
It turns out that the paste eating was a one-time thing done on a dare, which is not nerdy, but COOL!I enjoyed Judy and her scrappy spirit.
I like this book because it is very funI recommend this book because you can enjoy this book Judy Moody was in a mood, not in a good mood, a bad mood is about Judy Moody like to collect the pizza tables, On the 1st day of school Mr Todd told Rocky that he will get the pizza downstairs. When Rocky comes back with the pizza, Judy told Mr Todd that can she get the pizza table Mr Todd told Judy You can get the pizza table if you are in good mood tomorrow.
i think that this is going to be a good book.Because when i read this book i get deep into the book and I picture what is going on and also what i am reading.so this is why i think its going to be a good book
I listened to this on audio with my daughter.
Good points, lots of lessons learned from this book.
I expected Judy to be Moody obviously, however, I didn’t expect her to treat others badly.
Great lessons throughout this book on how not to act, how not to treat others badly, how not to care for plants/animals.
Also Judy makes a me collage in this book and my daughter wants to do that activity.
It wasn’t a horrible book, but it wasn’t good either.
My daughter told me all the things she liked and didn’t like about this book.
My students thought this book was hysterical. They laughed often and continue to take it off my shelf to read. I was a big fan as well 😊
Love it.
Judy Moody starts off third grade in a very bad mood, but the experience grows on her when her class is assigned a project to create a “me” collage.The black and white images made with watercolors, pencil, and ink appear throughout the story to supplement various scenes (such as Judy’s attendance at Frank’s birthday party and a delightfully jumbled, two-page spread of Judy’s completed “me” collage).
Though Judy manages to take situations to the extreme, her reactions are believable and her family is supportive, making the somewhat episodic story appealing to readers who want a slice of life in their fiction.
I first read all of the books about Stink before beginning my introduction to the Judy Moody series and was defiantly not disappointed.
Judy Moody was just that moody.
Written in short chapters the book details some of the events and her feelings with the beginning of third grade.
The relationship between Judy and her brother is portrayed very realistically, maybe it's because the author is one of four sisters that she can draw from her own experiences so well, but she nails how siblings interact with one another.
I'm looking forward to picking up more of the books in this series and see what antics she is up to next.
This is the second Judy Moody book we've read and we've really enjoyed both of them. Although the moodiness can get a little old, our girls can really empathize with her experiences, her joys, her anxieties, her frustrations, her collections... And the story is humorous and fast paced. We will definitely look for more Judy Moody stories.
A good book for someone about in 2nd grade or 3rd grade. WAYYY to immature for a higher grade level. But still, its a cute book anyway.
After  Penelope Perfect  , It's  Judy Moody Now :D Aww...Stink is so innocent :'P ^_^
Nice short children's story, with a girl starting third grade with low expectations, only to find that everything is not what she expected.
She starts the day in a bad mood, a very bad mood, but when her teacher sets her and her class a new project she soon learns how to be in a different mood.I didn’t really like Judy that much to begin with and it took me quite a few pages to really get into this story although reading it is easy and quick.
I’d never read a Judy Moody book before and I think it’s because it was new to me that I wasn’t sure what to expect, but as the story progresses I did get into it and actually enjoyed it quite a bit.
Although Judy seems like a moody girl at first, she’s a character that many kids can relate to and enjoy reading about.
I liked her more towards the end, as she DOES admit her mistakes about people, and is actually a pretty good friend (unlike Horrid Henry!), as well as student, when the work interests her.Very American though, with 'rare' her generation's word for 'cool' and overused a bit, with other terminology that British readers (I'm in the UK) will probably have to ask Mum or Dad about.
An easy read for a confident Primary reader, aged 9 or so, lots of short chapters and Judy will have some appeal for boys as well as girls.
"Judy Moody Was in a Mood" is another great book in this series by Megan McDonald.
Fun illustrations help emphasize the story line of a moody girl with some sass who loves to pick on her brother Stink.
She is quite a character that middle elementary aged readers will love.
I can see it motivating quite a few reluctant readers!
I would suggest this book for the 7-12 age category.
It might be a tough read for some 7 year olds, but advanced readers with may be able to handle the humor and reading.
Judy Moody is a quirky story about an adolescent tomboy who reminds me of myself when I was around her age. She is not a morning person, the weather affects her mood, and she is just a sassy third grader. She collects rocks, band-aids, and all sort of funky things all kids think are cool. She sometimes lets things get to her, but by the end of the story she has learned how to deal and not let the little messes in life get her down.
this book is my childhood ever since I started reading Judy Moody I felt a small connection between me and Judy that we were both the "same-same" I am trying to get all the books even though I am a grown up. right 😃😃
