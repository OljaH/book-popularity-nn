Re-reading this recently reminded me how much I appreciate Buber's philosophy and writings related to the essential dialogue that is so critical yet so rare in the world as we all wonder why our monologues don't bring us closer to others or our inner selves. Didn't discern the answer on how to reach this place of true dialogue but love the fact that Buber makes it come alive in a way that encourages us to strive towards it.

For those who question the coherence of “I and Thou,” Buber also provided this book. The five essays collected in “Between Man and Man” elaborate the dialogical view of man espoused in the earlier, more famous book. Buber situates his I-Thou dualism within intellectual history and attacks individualistic and collectivistic views of man. The writing gains poignancy from the personal anecdotes Buber relates and from being the thoughts of a prominent Jew trying to maintain Jewish intellectual life in Germany and Austria during the 1930s. He finally fled to Jerusalem in 1938.
I just picked this gem up yesterday. This guy was Levinas' mentor and friend and his work about friendship and others informs much of Levinas' work. I'm using this book for my seminar paper.
Requires focus. Not a casual read. However, his notion of "I-Thou" and how educators ought to interact with their students is inspiring.

I find Buber hard to read, yet worth it, akin to finishing every last bite of your hearty oatmeal/quinoa/amaranth breakfast.
The brilliance of "I and Thou" for personal interactions, whether with people, trees, or even the sky.
Buber's strongest collection of essays fleshes out the compact insights of _I and Thou_.
People are people.
