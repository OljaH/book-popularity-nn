Okay, so some of the girls asked that I do a review of the Anita Blake series because I mentioned some things that intrigued them.It's not a finished series and usually I would reserve judgment on a series until it comes to its conclusion just in case the author was going somewhere I wasn't expecting.Kind of like that scene out of Austin Powers where Austin's in the bathroom stall with a bad guy and a big Texan man is in the next stall and can only see Austin's feet.
Suddenly, you think you're going to go a little crazy if you read another freakin' sex scene.
Whatever.)The appeal for me was always Richard the werewolf and Jean-Claude the vampire, whose relationship was obviously the true love story about to happen, but in later books they don't even appear.
Why on earth would the author replace the most compelling characters with a series of beta males who Anita can control like she controls every other aspect of this world?Well, obviously, because this is Hamilton's fantasy, isn't it?
Right down to the creation of a character that is the male version of Anita, so she can make love to herself.
The book belongs to urban fantasy genre; it was written long before the term was created.
So humans did something really stupid (in my opinion formed after I finished reading) and legalized vampires despite the fact that these creatures need to kill people to exist - as everybody knows.
As the title implies Anita had some experience of dealing with annoying bloodsuckers so when they finally got on her nerves she realized it was time to quit acting stupid and start kicking some undead butts.
I also found Kate Daniels' granny: Anita.
This rating can mean "Nice, but I am not reading the next book" and also "I am mildly curious what comes next".

Anita Blake is a vampire hunter/slayer among other dealings with the undead/occult and she's only in her early twenties.
PROS (1) Fast read; (2) Vampires are similar to the legends but have enough unique differences where we are dealing with something new and enticing; (3) Anita is a nice mix of male and female which means she should appeal to both genders; (4) Well plotted; hardly any gap holes of logic; pacing is well done; and (5) Big finale climax at the end.
CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B to B plus; ACTION SCENES: B plus; STORY/PLOTTING: B; SETTING/TONE: B plus to A minus; WHEN READ: 2006 (revised review mid November 2012); OVERALL GRADE: B plus.
I loved it the first few times I read it.
I’ll stop with the annoying fragments and the non-apostrophes now as I can’t even bring myself to write them for an extended period of time, let alone force anyone to read them…unlike someone else I could mention.Okay, in all seriousness, don’t do what I did.
I really didn't like Anita this time around.
Still, I think I’m going to wait to read the next until after I successfully manage to burn the memory of Barrons from my mind.
(view spoiler)[GROUP READ!Victims Volunteers:1.
I finally got around to reading Guilty Pleasures, the first Anita Blake book, and can at least see why they're not in the Romance section: it's gory and the author doesn't seem to like vampires at all.I know Hamilton's very well established and has a huge fan base, and I know there are lots of other people who don't like her books, so I feel pretty confident I'm not going to get lynched by saying I'm glad I only spent $2 on this book.I really didn't like it.
I have never skimmed a book like I did with Guilty Pleasures.
Right, I guess it was ok.How did vampires become common knowledge?
She felt shallow...
She felt not real, but someone that simply went with the flow, with no actual starting point, or purpose.
I would like to say she felt like a character in a book, but I love books, so that would be insulting to them.And how on Earth (view spoiler)[did two humans with no spectacular powers kill a 1000 years old vampire?
The vampire must have been extremely stupid because she went down so fast.
I usually like vampires very much, but the ones in Guilty Pleasures are idiots in spite of having great power.
Here Anita Blake has a job as an animator (raising the dead for information for the police force) and isn't spending any of her time lazing in bed with her posse of wimpy beauteous men, she even has girlfriends and we are introduced to an intriguing character named Edward (I had forgotten all about him!).
The black humor lightens up the darkness and makes Anita approachable while in later books there is little, if anything, left to like about the character who is obsessed with power, sex and is often just plain mean.
Normal world, normal woman, except that vampires (and other supernatural critters) are real, some have civil rights and coexist with humans more or less peacefully, and the protagonist is a 5'2" gun toting butt kicking necromancer.
The monsters are living among the humans now, and Ms. Hamilton does a wonderful job of looking at exactly what that would entail.
What happens when the scariest thing in your world is a human, not a monster?
Before Kate Daniels it was Anita Blake.
Taking in consideration that the series will turn into a porn fest after book 6-7 I call her a hypocrite.
Kate Daniels, on the other hand is a fun, likeable, kick ass character.
Even the character Ilona Andrews copied from Guilty Pleasures, Rafael, is so much better.
I might try the next one in the series but I am in no rush to do so.
This was one of the first UF-PR books so it might wort a try if you are interested how it all began.
That has to be, to me, the least intelligent-sounding word to come out of anyone's mouth--doubly so if you're answering your own rhetorical questions, Anita, as though the reader is too stupid to realize that no, the vampire probably won't let you go.Anita's a stone cold bitch; in all three hundred pages I think the only real concern she had was for a character we barely met whose name I've forgotten.
They should all die, the monsters."This book needed less of Anita's bigotry and demeaning attitude and more explanation of vampire origins and how they came from feared monsters to nearly getting the vote.

I like this one, so far, and now I guess she will have to wait (and nag me) even longer until I get to the series she meant for me to read.
(Dark Hunter?)Also, she warned me to only read this series for around 8 books because then things take a left turn and it's all porn and no story.
*shiver*Clowns have streets named after them in HellSecondly, I liked that Anita is a smartass who makes jokes at inappropriate moments.
O_oSo, I will keep reading this series for a few books....
This was a complete waste of time.
If it hadn't been a library book, there were several occasions when I would have thrown it across the room.
("Bully...naw...dammit...goosebumps marched up my arms...") Hamilton never took the time to set up the world we're reading about, or give any sort of motivation to the characters' choices/actions.
I didn't like a single character in this book.
Was Anita Blake supposed to be endearing?
Was Jean Claude supposed to be sexy?
Was Phillip supposed evoke sympathy?
Needless to say, I will not be wasting any more time on the following books.
I never really had any intention of reading this series, but a close friend of mine insisted that I buy the first novel when we were roaming the shelves at Barnes and Noble.
They know what happened in previous novels, and they know who her main characters are.
So, why the tidious repetition?The only character that holds any interest for me is her would-be vampire lover, Jean-Claude.
Jean-Claude is what made me read the first three novels of the series.
I still continue to read this series because I want to read more about my favorite vampires (Jean-Claude and Asher) but sadly, each book continues to add more and more male characters and there is hardly any space for the old ones.
Last but not least, most of the powerful male characters are actually really good people, while most of the powerful female characters are evil monsters, all with the exception of Anita.This series is still unfinished and at this point, that doesn't really matter to me anymore but to be honest, I may continue to read it despite all my nagging and complaining simply because I really really liked this damn series at the beginning!
***2017 Summer Lovin' Reading List*** Another title in what seems to be morphing into my Summer Vampire Reading List. I liked this one and will probably read on, at least for another book or two, in the series.These are old-school vampires, susceptible to both crosses and holy water, something fairly uncommon in current urban fantasy. Anita knows that she is opposing evil, not just being prejudiced against a new segment of society.There was also, I thought, a nod to Anne Rice's vampires, specif
***2017 Summer Lovin' Reading List***
Another title in what seems to be morphing into my Summer Vampire Reading List.
Anita knows that she is opposing evil, not just being prejudiced against a new segment of society.There was also, I thought, a nod to Anne Rice's vampires, specifically Claudia.
The biggest, baddest vamp in Anita's town is actually a 1000 year old little girl!I'm not exactly sure why, but Anita reminds me of Faith Hunter's Jane Yellowrock.
She can't continue to lean on the psychopathic Edward (although I must admit that he has a treasure-trove of weapons, making him a handy kind of guy to know.
Hamilton's later Anita Blake books and reading it first.
I had to stop halfway because to be frank, it sucked.
It really, really sucked.
But many of my friends insisted that the first few books of the series were actually pretty good and not quite so wlsh fulfillment-esque.
In fact, it was a much better scale than her later books.
A bit.Vampire fiction is overdone and often overwrought.
I've skimmed the later books to get a feel of where Hamilton is going with Blake's character and it's not good.
I present to you, a haiku about Guilty Pleasures: No no no no no.What the fuck did I just read?My brain is melting.Thank you.
The second most powerful vampire, Jean-Claude, is interested in more than just Anita's professional talents, but the feisty necromancer isn't playing along--yet.
Note: foreshadowing, Louie, a wererat, is briefly mentioned; he will later play a much larger role in the seriesNotables: Jean Claude has given Anita the first two vampire marks.Bad guys: Zachary – vampire murderer, ValentineBig Bad kill ~ Anita kills Nikolaos by taking off her head with a swordReviews ~ "Guilty Pleasures" is the first of the Anita Blake series.
Angered, two of the strongest vampires in the city, Jean-Claude and Nikolaos, convince Anita to hunt down the killer.
Surrounded by monsters, dodging the manipulatice powers that continue to attempt to lure her farther into their world.Anita is an arrogant and rude character.
As the book progressed, monsters became unclear.
Jean-Claude is a master vampire, a seductive and sexy man who gets under her skin.
He owns the club, Guilty Pleasures, a vampire strip club.
A life changing and unbearably perverse relationship is formed, forced upon her friend.
The mystery kill continues to elude the police, and Anita.
She struggles to solve the crime and unveil the homocidal serial killer of vampires.Her friend’s life depends on it.
if you had to be someone in this world you could not do better then being anita blake.as cool as buffy and witty to boot.i will admit that this is one of my very own guilty pleasures
Someone one was killing vampires and Anita was assisting the police in their investigation into the murders.
The action scenes became non-stop and Anita began juggling her murder investigation with struggling to keep Nicholaos from killing her friends.
Expect a lot of twist and turns in this one!One of the things I liked about Anita was her wit.
I wished that there were more scenes with Jean-Claude in this book, but I realize that the author was probably building up her world first.
I expect their relationship will grow more and thus more of Anita & Jean Claude in book 2.
**edited 12/15/13As this is one of the trope-makers for the urban fantasy genre, it was quite interesting to read.
Hamilton's influence is visible throughout almost all of the books in our current urban fantasy genre, from the Dresden Files (Jim Butcher explicitly acknowledges his debt to Hamilton) to Kate Daniels to Rachel Morgan.
Due to my failure to sympathise with the protagonist and the story's rather unsettling fascination with rape themes, I was unable to enjoy the book on its own merits.
It is about a zombie raising/vampire hunter!
She is very tough and reminds me of Buffy the Vampire Slayer only WAY more kick butt and knowledgeable about Vamps!
DO NOT read this series if you don't like sex in your books.
At first there is no sex, but as the series goes on, there is more and more of it!
The stories are so action packed and there are so many twists and turns that you just can't put these books down!!
Now, I get the treat of a new book on WED May 27th!
Seriously, this is my all time favorite series of books!!!
1.5 stars. When I picked this book up, I was hoping I had found a new series to dive into. Unfortunately, it was not nearly as good as I was hoping and I do not see myself reading additional books in the series.
not sure what to think about this book it was very well written and the plot was great but there seams to me to be something missing though I can't put my finger on what it is so a four out of five from me
I am a die hard fan of three different series.
Jim Butcher's Harry Dresden, Patricia Briggs' Mercy Thompson, and Charlaine Harris' Sookie Stackhouse are (in no particular order) my favorite characters to read about.
I very rarely love the first book in any new series.
I tend to cut them some slack though, because I know there is a lot of background info and world building that the author has to pack in to the first one.
The whole book was action packed and totally engrossing.
I haven't been this excited by a new book in a while, and I am looking forward to reading the next one!
a good start to a series
