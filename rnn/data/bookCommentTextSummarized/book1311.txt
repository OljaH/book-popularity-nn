This is a very powerful anti-war play whose themes are very relevant today, especially regarding indifference on the part of people who profit from war, the authenticity of people who "dance or play music" against war, and the battle between the individual and the masses. This is a quick and easy read with some memorable quotes. Given what Toller saw and experienced while in prison, this is a book whose message cannot be disputed. It is a shame that it has disappeared in the mists of history. I wonder who will have to courage to resuscitate it?
A rough and mysterious ride into the troublesome years following the First World War in Germany. In this context it is, that Toller shows us a struggle over life and death by dehumanized figures, fighting over the right to define what the mass is, what the individual is and how both are to be valued. It is a deeply expressionist experience, as these dehumanized figures with their fractured language and behaviour as well as the grotesque dreamlike scenes bitingly reveal the cynism of the contemporary mechanized and capitalized mindset.
