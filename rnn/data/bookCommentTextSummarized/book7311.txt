No matter, I know now...This, along with Bonfires and Broomsticks, make up the two stories about Miss Price, three children, and a magic bed - and their adventures.
Paul has his bedknob in his pocket, and soon, his bed, takes them off on some magical adventures...
I wanted more from it, though it's a great length for a 7-9 year old reader, or for even younger children to have read to them, with short chapters and lots happening.Different to the film (where Miss Price accepts the three as evacuees), the essence is the same - she's a trainee (or novice), and adventures don't always go to plan.
I read this many years back but I still remember the details somewhat.
The bed knob's magical powers would always make me envious of the children privy to it.
While the cover yelled "fun", the pages gave a more mature picture.
So much so, that I would look at the knobs on my own bed and go on imaginary adventures in faraway islands.
It gave me hope and positivity during my early teenage years in a strange way that I am unable to explain.
It also taught me how a childish looking cover can hide valuable lessons and teach one of life's greatest skills -- imagination.
Love this book.
