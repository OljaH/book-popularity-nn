Volume 1 and Volume 2 of Collier's Junior Classics were read to my sister and me every night for several months.
Then I started reading it by myself, over and over and over.
There was a large gap of time between my last read (around 12) and when I first read it to my daughter in 2000, but that gap only helped to remind me how much I loved those stories growing up.
I'm holding onto this 10-volume set - the same set I've had all my life - so I can hand it down to my daughter to read to her kids someday.
love this anthology of old versions of fairy tales and nursery rhymes and short stories. I bought the entire set of 10 published in 1964, minus 1 book b/c I didn't realize the seller didn't have it. grr Interesting introduction shows the bias of the collectors that we're "all good by nature" and so on. :) Doesn't make the stories any less hearty.

Read this numerous times as a kid, and still enjoy it as an adult.
