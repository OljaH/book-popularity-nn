Loved Jared and Savannah <3 <3 <3
Everytime I read Savannah's family name (which is Morningstar) I was thinking about the TV series "Lucifer".
Because the main character's name in the TV series is Lucifer Morningstar.
This is the second book in the series and it's about the oldest brother in the MacKade family.
What they both have in common, is the stubbornness.
And trust me, this stubbornness made the book a little bit funnier.
I really appreciated that the idea of the dream and the hunted places was still a big part of the book.
If the first book was about the hunted inn, now it was the hunted forest.
This is what we want in a heroine, a woman who stands up to the alpha man and meets him temper to temper. What she did to his clothes in the end was classic! 🤣 I sometimes read this love stories and want to shout at the women to grow a backbone. With this book every time I thought, "If this was me I'd..." Savanah went one step farther. Yep, a girl after my own heart.
I haven't been this gleefully and emotional about a series in this genre for way too long.
And I must admit I have a huge soft spot for stories with young kids on it, I just love to get different perspectives of the story and when we read about the way a boy of 9 years old sees it how can't we love the book?
I think that I got to love this series so much after the second book because now I can say the characters in it are really different from each other and unique.
O carte frumoasa si emoționanta, desi spre final ...atat Jared cat si Savannah m-au scos din minți cu incapatanarea lor! Nu recunosc ca sunt îndrăgostiți, unul pune prea multe întrebări, alta nu vrea sa dea răspunsuri....Recenzia mea completa aici:https://justreadingmybooks.wordpress....
Savannah Morningstar;1. had a teenage pregnancy2. was kicked out of home and abandoned by the babies father.3. is a single mother.4. was poor.5. worked as stripper.Jared MacKade;6. is a local boy from wealthy family.7. has three rambunctious brothers8. is divorced.9. has a very large penis.10. was betrayed by Lando Calrissian who turned him over to Boba Fett.Of these 10 key plot points, one does not appear in this book. Can you spot which one?

Jared's usual m.o. was so well introduced that you could see the train wreck coming when he got in too deep with Savannah who was much more willing to accept her lucky breaks, because this had made her change her life for the better before.
Even though she had deep and understandable insecurities about measuring up to certain standards of class and a healthy fear of the police.Seeing it coming made Jared being a total dickhead no easier to take and while Savannah's reaction was just delightful to read (and had his brothers in stitches), I really think he didn't grovel enough for the pain he put her through.But you know I'm squarely on Savannah's side - and if she and her son want Jared MacKade even if he is stupid enough to let his pride get in the way of trust and love, well then more power to them.
The Pride of Jared MacKade3 StarsIt is a testament to Nora Roberts' writing that this story was enjoyable despite the fact that the heroine is utterly unlikable and unappealing.
Savannah Morningstar is quite simply a B*TCH and I never use that word lightly!
Not only is she rude and obnoxious, but she is prejudiced and vindictive as well.
Jared MacKade is stubborn and proud but he certainly hasn’t done anything remotely bad enough to deserve Savannah as his heroine.
The story of the civil war antagonists which bothers so many reviewers is actually one that I enjoyed.
Better than the first one.
Maybe because we have an heroine with a strong story behind.
He tries to understand her but he fails because he's a lawyer, everything should be black or white and with her he cannot figure out the good and the bad.I love Mackade family, they are caring and strong and they are ready to protect each other.
Besides there's a continuum with the first story and we cannot appreciate developments in MacKade family.
I'm already on 3rd book, which is about an abused woman and her children and a sheriff who just want to protect them.
3.5 stars. I thought Jared was understandably interested in Savannah's past but she was just a bit overly defensive.
Book two in the MacKade brother series is the story of lawyer Jared.Jared is the oldest of the brothers, and the most shrewd and realistic.
Already having being burned by a bad marriage, he keeps his eyes open.
Slowly they unravel each other and insecurities come to light.Now the positives about this book- I really enjoyed reading about Connor and Bryan- and their friendship- The strength of Savannahs characterThe negatives- The way Savannah dealt with her insecurities - The H and h had terrible communication - The way Jared keeps throwing Savannahs past at herOverall, I didn't enjoy much of it.
Savanna es la leche, poder de mujer. Jared es un abogado imponente y que...oye, lo pintan to buenorro jajajaja.Me ha gustado mucho lo de que ella tenga un hijo y LA ESCENA de ella al llegar con el coche perfecta! Risas, muchas!
Jared MacKade and Savannah Morningstar's book was absolutely unforgettable.
After finishing Rafe's story, I didnt' think this series could get any better but I was wrong.
"The Pride of Jared MacKade" took me from one end of the emotional spectrum to the other.
Reappearances by characters from the first book add so much more to this story, along with an adorable little boy you'll cheer and hope that his dreams come true.
There are so many wonderful conversations in this book that tug at your heart, make you laugh-out-loud and bring tears to your eyes.
Most of all, this book will leave you wanting more.
3.5 PROUD STARS!This series will probably be considered quite dated now, but I have to confess they have been very enjoyable to listen to.
The brothers all come across as hunky dunky which in my humble opinion is always a bonus.
The H and h's story is sweet and the paranormal story which continues is really quite interesting.
These audiobooks were given to me from my lovely Auntie and I'm very greatful to her as I wouldn't have purchased them and would have therefore missed out on a sweet if a little predictable series.
I loved all 4 MacKade Brothers books but this one's my favourite. Why?Heroine Savannah Morningstar just plain works for me. She's unapologetic about her past, lives life on her own terms and knows when she's had enough. The scene where she lets Jared know that she's finished with him (without using words)works so well(and induces extreme writer envy)! Besides, Jared does good grovel. And the relationship between the brothers... that works too.
This has always been my least favorite of this quartet and this time it was because of the wanton property destruction at the end. I'm sorry, you can be be as pissed as you want, but destroying someone's things and being glad, is not being passionate. And it does not make me want you to stay together.The kid is great, though. Her kid writing is underrated.
Men dacht immers dat er van geen van hen iets terecht zou komen, maar ook Jared heeft net als zijn broer Rafe het tegendeel bewezen.Zijn leven ziet er nu dan ook helemaal anders uit als tijdens zijn wilde jeugdjaren.
Een job die perfect bij hem lijkt te passen vermits hij niet tegen onrecht kan en opkomt voor zwakkeren.
Zijn sterke karakter helpt hem bovendien om zijn boodschap duidelijk over te brengen wanneer hij zijn dossiers bij het gerecht voorbrengt.Jared leek zijn wilde jeugd volledig achter zich te willen laten door de afgelopen jaren steeds berisploze keuzes te maken.
Hopefully it wont be as disappointing as this book.
She annoyed the crap out of me at the beginning of the book.
She had her moments throughout the book, especially her childish stunt at the end, but she did get better for the most part.
I freaking hate that term but there is no other way to describe his stupidity.
I kept hoping all three of his brothers would pound the ever-loving crap out of him.
At least he was called out on his sexism by Savannah and his brothers.
The last two books of the series were much better about that.
Most men in romance novels are basically rutting boars when it comes to that and even though he wanted her, he wanted to make sure that she understood that it meant something.
That was just one part of the book that stood out for me.Now, she had a colorful past that she wanted to keep buried and he, being a lawyer, wanted to know more and got a little testy with her when she wouldn't reveal it.
The answer to that would have totally changed the dynamics of the story.This was an easy book to read and I read it in just a matter of hours.
This one was as good as the first. A good, solid contemporary romance. Not too deep and not to shallow either. Jared MacKade has always been full of questions. He always thought everything through from both sides, so it wasnt that surprising that he became a lawyer. After a brief stunt at marrying, he now lives back at the MacKade farm after the divorce. When he gets a call from a lawyer friend that wants him to contact a client, Jared never thought that he would meet the woman of his life.Savan

He always thought everything through from both sides, so it wasn´t that surprising that he became a lawyer.
When he gets a call from a lawyer friend that wants him to contact a client, Jared never thought that he would meet the woman of his life.Savannah Morningstar and her son has had a rather ruff life.
Jared has a real problem thinking too much and Savannah with her pride.
And the man to man talk between Jared and Savannah's son in the wood was heartbreaking.
After enduring hard childhood with his father, and yet a wonderful one with his mother and three brothers, Jared is ready to face the future.
He always knew he did not want to run the ranch but is willing to help his brother out.
He is a lawyer and when he meets people, he is known as “counselor” instead of “one of those wild MacKade boys”.
He is patient and diligent in carrying out his duties as a lawyer.
She wants nothing to do with her father who had been a lost rodeo star.
*4++ Stars*I read this series many years ago and loved it!
(And I remember the other two being even better!) It surprises me that they don't feel dated too!I am a fan of Nora Roberts, she has a way of writing that works for me.
I am, and forever will be, a sucker for a man who wants to be a dad even if he isn't the father.
I was raised by such a man and he will always be my hero.
Jared's discussion with Savannah's son, Bryan, at the end was super sweet!
Almost better than his talk at the end with Savannah - almost.
The hero is a divorced lawyer who's come home to build his practice there.
Heroine is a single mom who's finally found a place to call home and raise her son.
I liked the heroine's characterization as a tough woman who's willing to try again, and I liked the hero who takes being smacked upside the head (Not so much literally) pretty well and is willing to admit that he's being a dumba$$ once he gets it.
And the more I've thought about it, the better I like it.
Liked it a lot.
I've really been enjoying this series by Nora Roberts.
I have been able to connect with the people in this series.
the chemistry between Jared and Savannah is well developed.
The relationship between Jared and Bryan was touching.
I am looking forward to reading the next book in series with Devin and Cassie.
I highly recommend this series.
this only thing that confuses me at times is Nora's writing style during love scenes.
sometimes they are overly wordy and I get confused with what's happening.
I found the first scene in the book to fall in the confusing category.
True to the title, Jared has more than his fair share of pride.
Quite the little rage-monkey, our Jared.
Savannah was okay, but protests a bit too much about how she's respectable and all, despite her past.
This being Roberts, it's probably the character).
This is more what I expect from a mid-90s Roberts so I'm willing to try the next despite being somewhat let-down by this one.A note about Steamy: This was also a bit on the high-side for Roberts.
Not all of them worked very well, for me, but mostly because I was exasperated with the characters...
Oh those Mac Kade Brothers make you love them!
Rafe Mac Kade is a lawyer with a past.
Rafe shaped up after his Mother's death and went to law school.
Now he's "Lawyer MacKade," has a past which includes an ex wife, and he's noticed the newest member of Antietam; Ms. Morningstar.
Now her is a woman with secrets and Rafe is determined to find all the facts out.
Does he ruin his chance at love by being too involved with finding out about her past?
Nora has a way of making you love a character even when you too are trying to figure that person out.
A super romance with a fascinating couple. He's a lawyer and she's an artist. He's divorced from an educated ice queen and she has never been married but has a son from a "roll in the hay" when she was 16. They are immediately attracted to each other and sparks fly. But Jared is used to over-thinking things and she thinks he's too good for her (too educated, expects too much). Nobody does it better than Nora Roberts when it comes to snappy dialogue, fully realized characters, and beautifully written love scenes.
4 STARS"He was a man who stood for something, and never turned his back on a fight. So when Jared MacKade’s work as an attorney brought him up against Savannah Morningstar, her rude behavior and strong defenses weren’t going to stop him.Savannah was the type of woman who defeated odds brutally stacked against her. And once he got to know her, Jared was determined to be the man to stand beside her in the fight." (From Amazon)I liked Savannah and Jared and together they had great sparks. I enjoyed the story and the MacKade brothers.
I love most of this book. Savannah is awesome! But Jared has moments of epic WTF assholery and issues about Savannah's past, and there is not nearly enough grovel—barely any, if fact—to make up for it so I subtract a star from the final grade. (I should probably subtract more but I still enjoy reading most of it.)
