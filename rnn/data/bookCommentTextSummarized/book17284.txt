One of the two best standalone books that I’ve ever read; this is truly historical fiction at its finest.Lancelot by Giles Kristian was an amazing standalone and now, I’ve found Gates of Fire by Steven Pressfield.
With fiery temerity, I’m not even afraid to claim these two as the best standalone books out of every genre I’ve ever read so far.I could try to tell you all the incredible building blocks that make up this book and warrant these high praises but believe me that I will fail.
The author himself is a former Marine, and draws upon his experiences to create a compellingly insightful look at the mental and psychological makeup of a soldier.
There is more philosophy in this book than one would expect from a war novel, but this is why I consider it both insightful, and at times inspiring…even after the fifth read.
This is a great book for anyone who is thinking of, or soon will be joining military service.
Anyone wishing to gain insight on how a military is supposed to function should read this book.
Anyone wishing insight to the mind of a soldier should read this book.
I didn't have a problem with the backwards and forwards through the meat of the book, but by the last third of the book, once it was time to leave for Thermopylae, and once they were there, the flow was often a bit too constricted by Pressfield jumping out of the tense rushing storyline, into other slower laid back storylines.
They went to the Hot Gates to die, and die they did.Pressfield is a man of high talent when it comes to writing and I can't believe it has taken me this long to finally read this book.
But having tried to communicate something of what I've seen and felt, I realize now just why so many who served so honorably chose to remain so silent as to their experiences.This book, Gates of Fire, says all of those things I couldn't say.As you may guess, the book centers upon the Battle of Thermopylae, the same subject as the movie 300.
The heroism on display at that time in that place makes any comic book superhero look silly by comparison; it's only natural that Leonidas & Co. should have their own line of action figures.
But if you want to know what a soldier thinks, lives, and feels, read this book.
This book is about the Battle of Thermopylae in ancient Greece, where 300 Spartans fought to the death.
The main character of the book is a slave who is captured by the Spartans.
Even though he is a slave of the Spartans, he begins to admire their bravery and courage.
During the course of the book, we see the slave’s hometown get destroyed, we find out how he becomes a slave, and why he admires the Spartans’ courage.
This was a surprising book for me.
This is also probably one of the better books on war that has ever been written.
Absolutely amazing.
Anyone interested in ancient history or military fiction simply must read "Gates of Fire." By Zeus, this is one of those books that everyone should read, regardless of what their favorite genre is.
Steven Pressfield has an amazing gift for transplanting the reader into his era of choice.I could attempt to spend hours writing a witty review, but ultimately it would not do this book justice.
So do yourself a favor and add it to your "To Read" shelf, or the gods will surely curse you and your offspring from this day until the end of time.Get your copy here: https://amzn.to/2KBFAty
Pressfield is intimately familiar with the major historical accounts of the battle and fills in the many gaps with events and conversations that could have, and possibly should have, happened.Leonidas, one of two kings of Sparta, leads 300 Spartans to Thermopylae in the attempt to delay the Persian army from reaching Greece before the Greeks have time to prepare the resistance.
Joined by allies from other Greek cities (Argos and Thespis, as I recall), the total number of fighting men was approximately 1,200 to face Xerxes mighty army, which ancient accounts number in the millions.
The convoluted process involved in the telling of the story was not really to get the reader to question the accuracy of what was being told, but rather to find a way to get many of the threads in the story to all line up.
This is interesting, as it does involve some fascinating mental gymnastics.This is a remarkable story and well told here in a way a modern audience would be much more likely to enjoy.
Υπέροχο βιβλίο. Το δανείστηκα και το διάβασα, μετά το αγόρασα για εμένα αρχικά και ακολούθως πολλές φορές για δώρο. Υπάρχουν βιβλία που με τη διήγησή τους σε κάνουν να "ζεις" τα γραφόμενα. Με αυτό το βιβλίο έπιασα τον εαυτό μου να κλαίει με ένα θάνατο.. κανονικό κλάμα, με λυγμούς. Και δεν το έχω εύκολο το κλάμα.. Αγάπησα τους Σπαρτιάτες, κόλλησα με την ιστορία τους, αλλά άλλο βιβλίο ισάξιο με αυτό (για ιστορικό μυθιστόρημα μιλάω) δεν βρήκα.
One of the best book I've read lately. With ease, I was drawn into the story of Spartans. In my head, I imagined each piece of equipment and felt the anticipation of oncoming battles that have become legends. No one can remain indifferent to the heroism of the Spartans who opposed the massive Persian army.
Then I realized that I couldn't write a coherent review of it, because I still, in spite of the intervening years, am an incandescent tower of blistering but impotent rage at the senseless loss of life and treasure which resulted from the blunderings of the George W.
Since it is not yet possible to engage in Matrix-like entry into soldiers' consciousnesses, the closest that I can get to understanding why soldiers act so completely different from me is to read books about them.
Why write a review for Goodreads that three people may read instead of, say, listening to Alma Cogan sing “Never Do a Tango With an Eskimo” on Youtube for the umptee-umpth time?
rating: 5/5 (more like 4.75 but I'll round)The story didn't really grip me (although it was still interesting)until the last 3 books (the novel is split into 8 "books" or sections), which were filled with jaw droppingly amazing battle and camp scenes from Thermopylae.
The description and details were captivating.The character development was good as well, I fell in love with Xeo and his telling of Alexandros, Dienekes, Leonidas, Suicide, Polynikes, and others.However, the story was told by Xeo, looking retroactively at the battle and the lives of the Spartans, as told to the Persian Great King Xerxes and involved jumping through time in a non-linear fashion.
I chose this book reluctantly from my library's audiobook shelf.
I always pick up books I "should" read with grudging feelings.Well.
I was foolish to have hesitated over it, because this book is excellent.
Knowing the outcome makes no difference--and even those who know nothing of Thermopylae will know the ending, because the book is told looking back in time.
The story is told my one survivor found by the Persians after the fateful battle.
It's the latter topics which take up most of the book, and which draw the reader in.
Despite knowing how it comes out, the book is suspenseful as well as dramatic and moving.
Highly recommended to me, but highly disappointing.
But the writing: trite, tedious, melodramatic, sometimes overly flowery faux archaic, and at others base sixth grade genital/excrement humor.
One of the major humor touchstones was a character whose catchphrase was "Wake up to this", which cracked everyone up because it sounded like "Weck up to thees".
Not only is that not that funny, but it doesn't really work for me because it takes me away from picturing these guys speaking Greek, and becomes a comedy of guys talking in amusingly accented English like Cheech and Chong.
Petrik just gave this an excellent review, so I had to buy it. Plus, it’s Ancient Greek history so couldn’t be more my kinda thing if it tried.... It’s only 99p on Kindle UK so grab it now!!!
Συμπαθές ανάγνωσμα, γραφή που κυλάει ευχάριστα και πλοκή που αιχμαλωτίζει τον αναγνώστη. Ένα τίμιο page-turner, αλλά μέχρι εκεί. Τίποτα περισσότερο, τίποτα λιγότερο.
The Spartans are as brutal and oppressive as they are stoic and courageous, so much so in fact that the Persians seem a relatively civilised and cultured lot in comparison.
Despite the repugnance much of Spartan life may arouse in the modern mind, it's hard not to feel some admiration for their utter refusal to accept subjugation in any form.
History lessons aside, it's in the battle scenes that this book really comes to life, the physical strain and merciless nature of close quarters fighting in the age of the hoplite has never been more vividly captured, even without the battle elephants.
I'm no lover of brothers in arms novels nor of battlefield butchery, however I thoroughly enjoyed this book.
Historical research is evident throughout the narration, I was impressed by the accuracy of the historical facts and the faithful portray of the Spartan society.
Lady Arete is my favourite character.This book is not just for the boys and deserves 5 well earned stars.
I do know that I quickly became engrossed in both the story and setting.Now I want to see the armor and weapons from the time period so I can better understand the phalanx fighting style of the Greeks.
I want to learn more about the Persian military to understand why their weapons and armor differed so greatly.
I am fascinated by the descriptions of Spartan psychology (though I certainly lack the physical attributes, perhaps mentally I might've made a good Spartan!).This being the first Steven Pressfield book I've read, I can only hope this isn't his one hit wonder.
When I first tried reading this book about the Battle of Thermopylae, after a while I just had to put it down.
I didn't know if it was because I just didn't like it, or if it was because it wasn't the right time to read it.
So I tried again.Forgive me for saying something like this, but it's clear the book is written by a man.
I think one of the reviewers captured it best when he/she commented on Pressfield's ability in writing a "military novel." Need I say more?
When I find out, I'll update my review!

Ένα βιβλίο πραγματικός θησαυρός! Στίβεν Πρέσσφιλντ, ο σύγχρονος Ομηρικός συγγραφέας.
It was fine at first, but when you're in the middle of the gripping titular battle the last thing you want is to zoom away to some other point in time.
Instead Pressfield tells a moving story of a man whose life is destroyed early in his childhood by a rival city-state and how he comes to fight in Thermopylae.You'd think that a book like this would be constant aggro manly chest-thumping and stuff like that, and there is a good deal of that kind of thing, but what surprised me is how touching the book can be.
Si pongo como floja esta novela, me lapidan.A ver, no es que sea floja, pero estoy un poco hasta el moño de la narración larga de batallas deonde nos muestran lo mala que es la guerra, los intestinos al aire, las heces, la orina, el dolor, el miedo, etc, etc, etc.Como narrador me gustan más otros autores (Posteguillo, tirando de orgullo patrio, me gusta más).Como interés en los personajes, pues el mismo Abercrombie no tiene nada que envidiarle al Presfield.
If you like your historical novels on the bloody side, this one’s for you.
(The gore begin in earnest in chapter 24.) Apparently the book is a favorite of people in the military -- although I suspect if Pressfield had covered the Spartan man/apprentice “mentoring” program in a bit more depth the military might not be as crazy about the book.
Along with battle tactics and weapons, Pressfield did a very good job describing Spartan women but, I would have liked to have seen a bit more about Diomache.
As with many historical novels, I think it’s too long.
Although I suspect most readers of historical fiction will disagree with me on this point.
Spartanci su idealizovani do te mere da čovek poželi da nastavi da čita o njima, pa i postane deo takve kulture.
Iako ovo nema bliže veze sa istorijskom realnošću, kao deo fikcije je potpuno na mestu i meni kao čitaocu koji se potpuno prepustio autoru, dalo ne uzvišen osećaj ponosa, a neki od likova ostaće mi među omiljenim likovima Antike.
Přála bych si, aby víc autorů dokázalo takhle popsat bitvy. Protože - ach - tak šíleně živé! Beznaděj proudící skrz slova, těla a krev. Ale Pressfield nevytvořil dílo jen o bitvě, jak by se mohlo zdát, to vůbec. On uchopil Spartu a v románu ji přiblížil lidem. Sparťanské způsoby, obyčeje, myšlení, bydlení, víra, odívání. Všechno tam je. Až mi zase někdo bude tvrdit, že dějepis je nuda, strčím mu pod nos Ohnivou bránu a donutím ho, aby si ji přečetl.
If you read only one macho right-wing war novel in your life -- read this book!Steven Pressfield has written a masterpiece about the ancient warrior state of Sparta.
It was a military dictatorship where all power belonged to soldiers and no one had any rights.
Slaves were routinely murdered as part of military training.
Young boys were conditioned from early childhood to brutalize each other to the point of serious injury.Yet somehow Steven Pressfield brings this strange society to life, and creates Spartan warriors who are not only admirable and powerful but at times almost lovable.
The training scenes are brutal.
5 stars - English Paperback - I have dyslexia - In an older notebook I found this lines:Much surpriced by this book. A slave who' s hometown is distroyed by the spartans, but becomes one of there worriors because he admires them so much. The fight agains the Persians. Loved it. 🌸🦋🌸
Monumental, inspiring and epic.
