Great read! a romantic storyline with a twist also heartwarming and endearing (paperback!)
This is an awesome book. It has a little bit of romance and a little mystery. It will embed images in your mind that will be hard to escape. Love and forgiveness will have a new meaning in your life. Yes, it does have a little bit of everything. A husband's love, a father's love, a cop in action, romance, mystery... FORGIVENESS! I won't tell you what it is about, because I think you should read it. REALLY!!! Go get it and read it. I never thought a man could write LOVE so well. Love in its purest form.
Más bien un tres y medio tirando a cuatro :)A veces, sencillamente, lees lo que tu alma necesita en ese momento. Es una comunión única, una lazo invisible que anhela como un suave bálsamo esas palabras escritas, que tus ojos recorren. No voy a decir que esta sea una gran novela, ni que se me ha encogido el corazón, no, pero, como he dicho al principio, una a veces solo necesita una suave ola de calor.
Surely the Danielle Steele set must rejoice whenever Sparks churns out a new book.
While this was not the worst Sparks book I've ever read (there, I've admitted it - I've read more than one), that is a pretty low bar.
I cannot even believe I read this.
Not only do I not remember why I picked this book up, I cannot remember the ending.
Suggestion: skip this book and save a few hours of your life; put it to good use gardening, playing with your children, or better yet, choosing a good author who doesn't insult your sensibilities with his writing.
Wish I had a dollar for each time a character ran their hands through their hair.
Opening Line: “On the morning of August 29, 1988, a little more than two years after his wife had passed away, Miles Ryan stood on the back porch of his house, smoking a cigarette, watching as the rising sun slowly changed the morning sky from dusky grey to orange.”Nicholas Sparks is like comfort food, I always know going in the kind of emotional love story I’m going to get and I can count on being sucked into the lives, loves and heartache of his small town characters.
I honestly didn’t know how Sparks was going to wrap things up here, his couples doesn’t always end up together and that too added to the mystery.Sheriff’s deputy Miles Ryan is still struggling to come to terms with the death of his beloved wife in a hit-and-run accident nearly two years ago.
But, this book tells the story of a man's journey through grief, and anyone who has been through the loss of a loved one knows that the pain never ends.
This aspect of the book was excellent and could not be faulted.Whilst I loved the character of Sarah I struggled to make that emotional connection to Miles.
This is however the reason I gave the book a rating of 3 (although, it would be 3 1/2 if it where possible) and not higher, I just didn't fall in love with the main character the way that I wanted to.
When Miles meets Sarah, Jonah's teacher, he starts to think he could find love again.
However, not everything is easy for Miles because he's so obsessed with trying to find his wife's killer..
which could somehow put strain on his new and developing relationship with Sarah.This book was okay.
The relationship between Sarah and Miles was okay.
or it just seemed like Miles chose Sarah to make Jonah happier in the end?
I guess I had higher expectations or just wanted more than what I got from this book.
I wonder if I can read all of his books this year??
No, jednog dana se sve mijenja.
Jednog dana se u njegovom životu pojavljuje Sarah, Jonahom učiteljica i on polako kreće dalje...
Moram reći da sam oko polovine romana znala o kome je riječ, a kada je Sparks napokon otkrio ko je to, nisam se nešto posebno iznenadila :) likovi su prilično mlaki, katakterizacija je mogla biti bolja, pa se zbog toga nisam nešto posebno zbližila sa likovima i njihovim životima.
Pozitivna strana ovog romana je pitanje koje otvara: Šta uraditi kada već kao mlad ostaneš bez voljene osobe?
Mislim da bi ovaj roman, kao i svi Sparksovi, bio odličan predložak za film.
Moram priznati da se on do sada pokazao kao odličan pisac scenarija za filmove, a romana već manje-više.
Based upon my reading of this book, nobody will be reading Nicolas Sparks 100 years from now and I refuse to waste any more of my limited time on Earth reading words slapped together by him and bound under the pretense of actually being a novel.The SECOND BEST thing about A Bend in the Road is that it was only 368 pages (with medium-large type) and it was over quickly.
The few times I did put it down, I threw it down disgusted by his formulaic writing style, predictable plot lines and pathetic dialogue.The BEST thing about A Bend in the Road is that one month - maybe even one week - from now, I won't be able to remember a damn thing about it.
typical nicholas spark novel. it could be cut 100 pages shorter. i feel like the story line and the twist were build into nonsense with so many plot holes. but again, it is nicholas spark. i enjoy it and it took me by surprise that i enjoy it. miles is a confusing character. sarah is facinating and jonah deserves a spin off.
This book was a very good book and it was sad because of what happened in the beginning.
Mijn eerste kennismaking met Nicholas Sparks en al meteen een schot in de roos.
Het boek werd me aangeraden door een vriendin, ook al ben ik meer gericht op thrillers.Het boek biedt romantiek, maar niet zo zeemzoet, wel met diepe emoties die je echt kunnen raken.
Maar toch kan je in het verhaal ook wel wat spanning terug vinden ..
dat zullen jullie dan maar zelf moeten ontdekken 😉.Het boek is zeer toegankelijk met een vlotte schrijfstijl en korte hoofdstukken.
Ik wou altijd nog net die paar extra pagina's verder lezen ...Kortom: mijn eerste boek van 2018 is een voltreffer met 5 sterren!
I personally felt that the mystery eats that typical spark’s romance element, I expected a little bit more.“Sometimes, things don’t work out the way we want them to.” Characters were well-defined, I felt for both Miles and Sarah, anyone can get easily connect with Miles and Sarah’s past stories and their struggle, I never felt angry on Miles actions, his actions were justifiable, the writing was as usual beautiful.
I've enjoyed Nicholas Sparks books in the past (even in the recent months) but this wasn't much.
You could predict so much before hand and there wasn't so much of a mystery left.
I found out half the mystery by the middle of the book but perhaps I would've liked it better if I hadn't read similar books.
Though it wasn't so bad as to be rated 1 or 2 stars, it also wasn't so good as to be 4 or 5 stars.
It's not a bad one but just not so great for me :)
A weak plot but somehow the characters kept me going. I wonder it is the choice of his books that I have read or his writing that I cannot come to like his works.
Offically dumped. My love affair is over. Whatever, Mr. Sparks.
Licht, compact en daardoor overal gemakkelijk te lezen.Niet mijn eerste Sparks boek en het zal vast ook niet mijn laatste zijn.
Miles blijft achter met zijn jonge zoon, Jonah.
Jonah heeft het lastig op school, waarop zijn juf Sarah hem besluit te helpen.
Maar is dat voldoende om elkaars wonden te helen?Laat ik beginnen met dat dit een prima roman is.
Maar..Wanneer je regelmatig iets van Sparks leest of kijkt weet je dat er op den duur een twist aan komt in het verhaal.
Ik ging dus vanaf het begin al op zoek naar die twist, waardoor ik hem al van verre voelde aankomen.
Obviously they fall in love, and obstacles, this would be where the 'bend' in the road occurs, fall in their way in this tale of forgiveness and romance.*gag*Right, so I was recommended this book by my co-worker who I made read the Hunger Games, and wanted to see what I'd think of a book she really liked.
And I don't like it.The writing, as I've mentioned, is perhaps in addition to the romance one of the worst things about this book.
Miles was easy to fall in love with until his rage took over a long three years after his wife's death and meeting the second love of his life - again difficult for me to buy into after seeing his actions begin to reflect a sense of letting go and moving on for himself and his son in the first half of the book.
But even then, I wanted to see some sort of final dialogue between these two main characters to show that Miles was able to come to the realization that as he lost his wife (Missy), Sarah too, in a way lost someone irrevocably, her brother's innocence coupled with a forever tarnished future for both her brother and herself, knowing that Miles' loss was caused by someone she deeply loved.
Sheriff Miles Ryan felt he died the night his wife Missy was fatally struck, but was determined to find her killer and spent the next two years focused on investigating every lead.While Miles immersed himself with his search, seven-year-old Jonah suffered.
Before long she realizes she is falling in love with Miles, though she knows a relationship is unlikely for he is still in love with his dead wife.
Though it was wrong, but needing to know the truth about Missy's death, Miles goes against the rules to get this information.
The books tells the story of Mile's Ryan's life after the death of his wife Missy Ryan.
It turns out that Sarah is heartbroken too and the two hit it off after Miles sweeps her off her feet with his superb elegance (not).
Nothing seems to threaten their relationship until (dun dun dun) new information about Missy's hit and run killer resurfaces.What really bothered me about this book was the utter predictability!
Because of the lack of characters you can have the "killer" pegged almost right off the bat.It bothers me that so many of Nicholas Spark's books are set in this "small town" of New Bern.
He's kinda falling behind-no not dumb-but was not pushed to doing work and stuff.And it was because his mom had died, so from pity, teachers passed him despite his lack of education.So yes.
Once again, some romance starts between the two, only Miles-Jonas's father-is feeling a bit weird, thinking that he should not be dating after the love of his life died.Blapahdiblah.Just like all of his other books, they fall in love.But when Miles tries to avenge his wife's death, he goes totally balistics, and seriously breaks practically every law.
:]But clue here: The answer is related to his new love, Sarah.I know...Oh. My.
Just how disconnected he has been is brought home when he finds out how badly his son Jonah is doing in school.
Determined to move forward and do right by his son,Miles is drawn to Jonah's teacher, Sarah.
As much a mystery as a romance,I liked that the driver in the accident had a voice.
It wasn't difficult to figure out who it was, and I was left to puzzle how the romance would fare when the perpetrator was finally revealed.
And as always, I enjoy reading books centered in my adopted home state of North Carolina.
Nicholas Sparks does it again with A Bend in the Road.
This book is about a police sheriff named Miles Ryan, who lost his wife Missy in a hit and run car accident three years ago.
He has a seven-year-old son named Jonah, who has been suffering nightmares ever since the incident.
They hit if off and soon they are falling in love.I enjoyed A Bend in the Road.
Although it was like a typical romance novel - fluffy, sweet, and has characters that are characterized entirely by their past heartbreak, it was still a good book.
This is the kind of book I wanted from Mr. Sparks!!
And yeah there is always the sparks kind of romance which is always a worth read!!
The pinch of sentiment, as usual in sparks' books, is a bit on higher note yet it is required for this subject!!This plot is a mixed narration, sometimes first person and sometimes third person!!
The relation of the third person with the leads will be revealed slowly once the plot begins to thicken!!On the whole this is a different kind of work , narration wise!!
A worth read and definitely a page turner!!
It took a while for me to finish this one. In the beginning I really liked the story and thought I would finish it quickly. It turned out to be the opposit. I don't know what it is with me but I like to do all kind of others things at the moment than read. The story was okay, not as tear-jerking as other stories I've read of Nicholas. Was surprised by the outcome eventually! All in all a nice read :-)
I found the book slow in the beginning. I was kind of bored when it was describing Miles' daily life after his wife died. It started to get more interesting when Miles meets his son's teacher. When the author described the different perspectives, like the person that did a hit-and-run on Miles' wife.
nicholas spark's writing is shallow and predictable. im ashamed i read this. boredom makes us do terrible things.
