This book is exactly what the title says it is. Spences Encyclopedia of Occultism was originally published in the 1920s (I think) so its pre-Crowley, and before new age and UFO stuff was in the mainstream. It was more or less impossible for me to read this cover to cover like I do 95% of what I review before I had to return it to the library but I can't see why anybody with an interest in Occultism wouldn't find this to be a useful resource to have around.
If you have just one occult book around for research, consider making it this one. If you can luck into the older, hardback and slip covered edition, even better. It looks quite lovely and scholarly on a bookshelf. It is exactly what it claims to be, an Encyclopedia of the Occult. You name it, it's probably got a listing in this work.
Probably the last major work of occultism not to include Crowley, mainly because Thelema was still nascent when it was released. Valuable for reference to the state of occult knowledge prior to Crowley, as the prevalence of Crowley's opinions and those who have followed has changed the landscape more than we know. Invaluable.
I highly useful resource of everything occult. I have been using mine for 25 years.
Indispensable to any student of the occult and esoteric, a real treasure-trove which has served my own studies well and often served as a spring-board to further analyses/cogitations.
Brilliant guide to the unknown.
A wonderful reference book on many aspects of psychic phenomena.
