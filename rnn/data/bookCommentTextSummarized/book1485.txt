If you're starting to get interested in collective memory, you should read this early on. I try to keep in mind that Halbwachs is mostly interested in what is now called social memory (which is a subgenre of collective memory, so I am not saying he is wrong). The field has come a long way since this text was written, and collective memory scholars owe a great deal to Halbwachs.
It's incredible, given how foundational Halbwachs' work is to the field of memory studies and how often it's cited, that this seems to be the one & only English-language version of his unfinished opus that's in print.
I'd welcome a different edition & translation, drawing from his earlier work as well as "Cadres sociaux..." (and without all the annoying typos in this one).
Halbwachs' memory theory is philosophical rather than empirical in base, and I disagree with much of it.
But it was transformative and still worth reading.
I wonder how his thinking might have changed, had he not been one of the Holocaust's staggering number of victims.
I liked this, it made me think in completely new ways. I liked his intellectual explanation of the apostasy of the Catholic Church. My collective memory class all agreed that if Halbwachs had survived the Holocaust, his views of static collective memory would have been different.
Good book on memory, history, but the stress is laid on collective groups, collective memory, the individual being defined only within groups.There are things to which I agree and things to which I STRONGLY disagree.Anyway the book helped me for my memory studies research project.
It can be read together with Durkheim's Elementary Forms of religious life.
It's simply outdated. Science proves it wrong. Nice source of inspiration nevertheless.

The edition that I read cut out some of the fractions of the book, making it essentially unreadable. So no ratings.
