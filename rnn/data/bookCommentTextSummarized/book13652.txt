This book is an excellent summary of the classic Disney movie.
Ova knjiga objašnjava kako i zašto se ne treba hvaliti. Nego biti pametan i samo reći: što imaš novo ili si dobila(o) što želiš. To je bonton tko to još nezna? 🤔🤔😂😂😂😜😜💭🗯🗨💬💌❣💟💞👗💝💗💖💕❤💓

Today's version, kissing a dormant princess, is infinitely more appropriate then the old story's act!
Alas, Norm McGary shortened his ‘Tell-A-Tale’ so much, we were left with bumbling fairies as the tone.Michael Teitelbaum and Hawaiian, lifelong, Walt Disney artist, Ron Dias cranked up the suspense and filled out the details, in this ‘Little Golden Book’ of 1986.
I gave three stars, faulting the same pointless decisions; basic story essentials with which I suppose Michael had to work.
Do the outcomes not seem easily circumvented?In this storybook, Aurora is betrothed in infancy to Phillip, who met her then.
A couple of the fairies brought good things to Princess Aurora, but one of them cast a spell on her that could have ruined her life forever.
When Princess Aurora is kissed by Prince Phillip, the spell is lifted and she is finally awake.
This story also brings back good memories of reading with my mom when I was a child, because we would read all of the Disney Princess books and Sleeping Beauty was always my favorite.
They can decide what Princess Aurora and Prince Phillip do once she’s awake.
The classic fairy tale with colourful drawings and the disney princess.
useful for all , read

This was the story of Sleeping Beauty.
Aurora who is Sleeping beauty, had a bunch of people come to the kingdom in honor of her birth.
The most honored guests were the three good fairies, Fona, Flora, and Merryweather.
FLora blest the child with beauty, Fona gave the gift of song, and before Merryweather could give her gift lightning struck and the evil witch appeared.
Merryweather raised her magic wound over the cradle and set another spell on her.
It was cleverly written though, and I know it is a popular story for young girls.
It was a good story, just not for me.
بچه بودم عاشق این کتاب وحتی کارتونش بودم !همه جمله های کتاب وهمه دیالوگای کارتونش رو حفظ بودم مامانم ضعف اعصاب گرفته بود از دستش !!!
But the story of the beautiful sleeping Briar Rose, for so the princess was named, went about the country, so that from time to time kings' sons came and tried to get through the thorny hedge into the castle.
After long, long years a king's son came again to that country, and heard an old man talking about the thorn hedge, and that a castle was said to stand behind it in which a wonderfully beautiful princess, named Briar Rose, had been asleep for a hundred years, and that the king and queen and the whole court were asleep likewise.
This classic tale is a delight to read to children and they love it! The King and Queen, their baby girl, the wicked witch, the spinning wheel, the three good fairies, the handsome prince, the vicious dragon, and, we can't forget that fateful kiss all make up for a rip-roaring tale with a happy ending!
Traditional lit- Sleeping beauty eats a bad apple that the witch gives her. The prince comes along and breksa the spell by kissing her. They then get married and live a happy life.
It was a great bed time read to my niece.
One of my favorites. Cute book for young children!
I Honestly This Book Mainly Because of the Artwork
Typical Golden Book adaptation that hits the high points of the movie.
GB 98
King Hubert tries to convince Phillip to marry the princess instead of the peasant girl, but fails.In the palace, Maleficent uses her magic to lure Aurora away from her family and to a strange room, where an enchanted spinning wheel awaits her.
Before falling asleep, King Hubert tells Stefan of his son being in love with a peasant girl, which allows the fairies to realize that Prince Phillip is the man Aurora has fallen in love with, and they search to find him, to convince him to kiss the princess and unbind the curse.
Obviously for anyone paying attention this is the Disney-fied version of this story.
The original story is more involved and provides a bit more background for the characters involved.
However, even watered down and gussied up this is still a charming tale and innocent in its "happy-ending, good wins, evil dies, ta-da!" ending.
Reading a bit more into it that is warranted, I'm sure, I enjoy the fact that the Prince loves Aurora/Sleeping Beauty without realizing she is a Princess and vice versa.
good story; and something that I love about children's stories is that in a way they are more honest in the concept that evil exists.
This book was such a cute book.
I loved the pictures in this book as well.
I also noticed that all the words from this book were in a paragraph form.
I did not see any that were single sentence lines in this book.
I thought that for such a small kid’s book that it was interesting they would be in paragraphs.
I liked the placement of the paragraphs throughout the upper and lower sections of the book.
Also I liked how the book did not have borders to the pages; there was a lot of negative space.
Overall, this book was a cute book.
So once again this was a book that I read as a young girl and growing up at Disneyland I thought I knew this story inside and out.
Apparently not because when reading this Disney book, I found things that I thought were just weird.
First of all, who has magical fairies that grant them "gifts" for being born?
Another thing, love at first sight in the woods at 15?
This book was great as a kid but I think reading it now, it just sounds way too fairy tale for me.
Sleeping Beauty has always been one of my favorite fairy tales.
One of my favorite details to this story was Sleeping Beauty's dress!
I also like how there is evil in the book but there is a happy ending!
Happy endings are my favorite, I don't like reading stories with sad endings!
I will always love the fairy tale Sleeping Beauty and pass it on to my kids when I am a mom!
I would recommend this book to any young girl who has always dreamed of being a princess and finding her prince charming!
sleeping beauty is for 3rd or 4th graders depending on the reading level they are on.
sleeping beauty was about a king and queen having a baby girl.
and they through a feast for her and the three fairies were giving her gifts when the witch came out and casted a spell on the baby.
the curse was that the girl would be dead when shes 16 years old.
but she found a prince that she fell in love with, but then the witch founded her a touched her with the spindle and she was dead.
Words cannot describe how much I love the story of Sleeping Beauty!
The story is about King Stephan and his Queen who have a beautiful baby named Aurora (we know her as sleeping beauty).
When she was born, her three fairy godmothers come to visit her named Fona, Flora, and Merryweather.
Each fairy godmother can give Aurora one gift each.
Flora gives her beauty, Fona gave her musical abilities, and Merryweather was unable to give her a gift because an evil witch came.
I would love to watch this movie again after reading this story.
My love of reading started when i was young, and it gives me immense pleasure to provide books to Spread the Word Nevada, an organization that passes them on to children in the community.
Sometimes I'll find a book I remember reading when I was young and will read it again before passing it on.I don't rate these books using my normal scale, instead I give most of them three stars.
This isn't a Criticism of the book, simply my way of rating them as good for children.
Basically the highlights of the Disney film.
I like the story but not this version of it.
There's zero character development and the prince swoops in and saves the day without even breaking a sweat.
What's the moral of the story?
The art just looks like stills from the movie and there isn't enough of it to match all of the text.
Because of this (and the violence) I would not recommend this for children under 4 years old.Of interest: So Maleficent cursed Aurora to her death just because she was not invited to a feast.
That seems a bit harsh, surely there's a bit more back story there?
The traditional tale of Sleeping Beauty is retold in Walt Disney format.
The book attempts to include all key elements of the story, including the three fairies prominent in the movie version, but does so in a haphazard manner.
The traditional tale is mostly intact regarding the spinning wheel and handsome prince, but the book relies heavily on the illustrations - again taken straight from the movie version - to tell the story of Sleeping Beauty.
While some children who enjoy the Disney movie version will too enjoy this book, in regards to traditional literature, there are far better options to choose from.
Earlier this year in school my class was reading fairytales.
And I was going through my stuff and I found this book on my bookshelf.
I think this book is a good book for bedtime stories, daily reading for kids and just for kids in general.
I think this book was somewhat entertaining, even for me.
It's good for all ages well at least 4 to 12 year olds, boys and girls.
So if you have small children this is a really good book to read to them.
And if your around my age this book is kind of entertaining, you can never beat the classics.
I remember hearing this story when I was a child and I watch the movie.
As a child, I was very afraid of Maleficent but I was fond of the three fairies.
I thought the three fairies were very funny and humorous.
Maleficent was scary looking and mean.
As I read this book aloud to myself, I started to compare the picture book to the actual movie.
The book was very start but got to its main points which were really neat.
As for the pictures in the book, I liked them because it was very colorful and it felt magical.
