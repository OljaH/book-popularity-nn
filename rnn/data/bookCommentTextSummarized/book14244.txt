Two things:1.
Lately, I really wish that Goodreads had a half star system.
This book is definitely a 3.5 for me and there is no way I could go to 4.
So, I settled on 3.2.
Seems like I find myself in the midst of a lot of books with sexual torture/rape scenes.
This is a pattern I hope to break!This book was okay.
I enjoyed parts of it, but all in all it was a bit too scattered.
With how long it is (21+ hours audio) it seemed to drag on with quite a bit of repetition.
All 3 of them are about to cross paths again, Annie, who has become unhappy in her marriage to a husband who sleeps around and has the law on his side, and Keith, who is still deeply in love with Annie, and wasn't happy with the way they left things, and Annie is still secretly in love with him, and Cliff Baxter, who, since hearing of Keith's return to town, has been watching his every move, also his wife's.Would I put Spencerville in my top favorites, no probably not, but like I said, still a good book, and I loved the Ohio/country setting, and the character developments!
Some artists can work in different styles without diminishing quality. Michelangelo's work with oils and sculpture come to mind. When it comes to action mysteries with humor, Nelson DeMille's John Corey series is at the top of my list. I gave all but Wild Fire a 5 star rating. However, Spencerville is not an action mystery with humor. It's a slow romance with an action climax. It's Michelangelo standing under a bridge holding two cans of spray paint.
However, if you are looking for a more of a straight fiction, character-driven novel, with lots of backstory, and some bits of action thrown in, then you've come to the right place.
When the action does come at the end it also seems to take way too long and it sort of loses its impact as a result.
But having said that, I very much enjoyed the read and would recommend it, as long as you're expecting more of a straight fiction book as opposed to the thrillers we are used to from DeMille.
Hands down, the silliest DeMille book.
The cold war has ended, the MC (ex-CIA) returnes home to a lost love in the heartland and is almost immediately outwitted by a stereotypical, wife-beatin', cheatin', lyin' and theivin' hick cop.No, really...I'm serious.
It's in the book, honest.Unfortunately, I read this book immediately after "Word of Honor" and was nearly crippled by story intelligence whiplash.
I'm still not sure what the moral of the story was behind this one.
Maybe it didn't have one.
DeMille is one of my fave author ever, but even he fires blanks on occasion.
It connotes an attitude and a policy of control by propaganda, surveillance, misinformation, denial of truth, and manipulation of the past, including the "unperson" — a person whose past existence is expunged from the public record and memory, practiced by modern repressive governmentsThe adjective Orwellian refers to these behaviours of State and The Party, especially when the Party is the State:Invasion of personal privacy, either directly physically or indirectly by surveillance.
The Great Black Swamp, or simply Black Swamp, was a glacially caused wetland in northwest Ohio, United States, extending into extreme northeastern Indiana, that existed from the end of the Wisconsin glaciation until the late 19th century.
Nelson Demille arrived on my favorite authors list after reading The Gatehouse, so I was anxious to read another selection and found Spencerville in the library.Keith Landry finds himself without a job after budget cuts in the federal government force him to review his life and decide what comes next.
Annie Prentis has spent the past twenty years in a loveless, abusive marriage to Spencerville's chief of police, Cliff Baxter.
When she sees her high school/college love of her life on the streets of Spencerville, there's no doubt the passion is still there between them, and the lines are drawn between Landry and the former high school bully, Baxter.
Is it just me, or does DeMille really have a problem with women?
Then I thought I'd try this one because I was on a trip and desperate for a page-turner, it wasn't one of his military titles, and it took place in small town America.
I figured it might be okay.
Instead the entire ending revolves around the abuse--pages and pages of it--of the errant wife, far more than is necessary to make the point and set up the ending.
So now I know he hasn't changed, and I have to ask--is it me, or does the author have some major issues?
I usually love anything by Nelson DeMille, but this must be an earlier work and his writing wasn't as great as it is now.
I found the story itself interesting and I would get caught up in it for a time.
Then it would switch gears and I would want to skim over parts just to get through them.
I forced myself not to skim and would have quit reading it (something I can't remember doing in forever) but I did want to know how it ended, AND I kept hoping it would improve - after all it is written by Nelson DeMille!
One of my favorite authors. How this same DeMille could write Cathedral is a critics question. I felt I was reading a very bad romance with a tiny bit of elementary evil thrown in.
Based on my own set of life experiences and what is relevant to me, this is the greatest novel I've ever read, but some of DeMille's others, like 'The Charm School' come close.I was a 'peace dividend' of the end of the Cold War just like Keith Landry, but man, did he have another mission to complete!
Spencerville is every small town American's dream of 'if I had it to do all over again.' DeMille mentioned that Ben Affleck was interested in playing the role of Keith Landry in the film adaptation, and I still think that'd be a good casting decision.
Once again, DeMille has created a book to keep me up all night.
After having read only so-so books for the last couple of weeks, what a pleasure it was to finally pick up a red-hot page-turner.
Spencerville is one of his stand-alone books (i.e., not a John Corey novel), and although it was first published in 1995, it stands the test of time well.
That along with a consistent fast pace make reading his books feel like a fun romp through a world of fascinating people ripping through a kaleidoscope of wild rides.
Very detail and could see everything he was explaining to detail. I loved this book so much that I went out and bought three more of his books.It was a very heart wrenching story and at times a little disterbing, but thrilling. He builds and builds till the end and then you can not put it down so you can get to the end. I like that he didn't use the heroin to fix all the problems, he uses tact to creat the need to finish something. I was satisfied at the end.
Read by the ubiquitous Scott BrickLet's see...Okay story, nothing new or memorable
I picked up this book as it said Nelson DeMille, I normally enjoy his book, this one I had to force myself to read to the end.A military officer, Keith Landry, who is suppose to be in intelligence and works at the White House, is put out to retire.
(sappy).Cutting to the chase, the jerk, Cliff Baxter, Chief of Police, (wife of the door mat Ann) bullies his way through town, their lives and even burns down Keith's family farm house, kidnaps Ann, his wife, kills a Vietnam Vet and tries to kill Keith.
I've enjoyed most of Nelson DeMille's books, but this one was an exception.Spencerville is a standalone story unrelated to some of the author's recurring characters. Keith Landry is an ex-CIA agent who returns home to the rural Ohio town that gives the books its title. Landry still has the hots for his high-school sweetheart, but she’s now married to the abusive and misogynistic small-town sheriff. Can you see where this is headed? Me, too.The central character is well-drawn, but there’s little else to recommend about ‘Spencerville’. Overall, I felt DeMille phoned this one in.
Spencerville was not one of Nelson DeMille's best, we didn't think...It just never got into the believable realm, which was funny, as in an abstract way the plot made lots of sense, but it just didn't ever get filled out so that it was believable.In the end, though not un-enjoyable (we didn't hate it), it just seemed ho-hum... but we continue to love his sense of humour!
Another great page-turner from DeMille. His characters and settings are very deep, very rich. You'd swear he grew up in this small town, rural atmosphere.* Couldn't finish** I had nothing else to do*** Passed the time, would be **** for genre / author fans**** Everyone could enjoy this book***** Everyone should read this book, I'll read it again
It is not the best written story, but I really enjoyed reading this. It all happens in Ohio where I grew up, so it was fun to read about Ohio State, Bowling Green State University and the area along 75.
not one of his best. more romance than fiction, with quite a violent finish. I find hard to believe that a fine, bright and civilised young woman would marry such a brute.
One of his best. Outcome is totally unpredictable. Hero saved by a savvy woman.
3 1/2 stars, DeMille's ability to write such diverse novels that never seem to become repetitive, as some other authors do, is uncanny and makes him one of today's best authors, in my opinion.
This long novel is 6 of 10 stars.
Finally got around to it.This is not one of DeMille’s most popular works, nor does it feature a character that would appear in subsequent novels.The main character, Keith Landry, is a military man retiring at a young age (in his 40s) back to the family farm in the small Ohio town where he grew up.Like many DeMille novels, there is not a whole lot to the plot, even though my edition of this book ran 639 pages.
Reminds me a little of of that old piece of crap, The Bridges of Madison County, but with other aspects.
The book turns into a "chase," with all kinds of twists and turns.
The chase aspect kept me reading, even though my suspension of disbelief was totally inoperable.
To me, this is mainstream potboiler stuff, but I must admit that the plot kept me reading--even though I wasn't buying the premise.
He's not a literary genius, but he's good at plotting.
Pretty much the definition of best selling writers nowadays.The book is also over-written, so you can flip through the pages of inane dialog and get on with the story.
Wow. This book was amazing. I am not usually a fan of cops and robbers type stuff, but this book captured the complete story. It had it all, including the no good cheating husband who just happened to me the chief of police and related to just about everyone in town. A long ago romance that still held a flame kept the romance part of the story interesting. High school sweethearts, pfff. This story was riveting in the details.
Spencerville by Nelson DeMille is the story of a cold-war warrior who leaves government service after the collapse of the Soviet Union. He returns to his hometown and connects with his childhood sweetheart who is trapped in an abusive marriage to the chief of police. Soon he faces harassment by the entire police force and she fears for her life. DeMille develops the characters well and fills the book with suspense.
A readable story cheapened by the author's fascination with profanity and crude sex. Too many pages are devoted to the syrupy descriptions of the two lovers' feelings of past activities, inserted no doubt to build up the contrast between these two 'good guys' and the malicious, evil bad guy, the local sherrif (who happens to be the husband of the female lover). An interesting portrayal of abuse of power by small-town police (one cannot help but think of Jackie Gleason in his 'boy-scout' hat).
A retired "spy" returns to his hometown. While there he realizes what drew him there, although his family has relocated. He has unfinished business with an ex-girlfriend. They parted abruptly and now she is married to the chief of police and the chief is a major ass. Through a series of events Keith, the spy, gets to revive some of his trade-craft in attempts the get his girl back. Very good!
First let me say, I like Nelson DeMille, I'm a fan of his writing. That said, I didn't care much for this book. The most interesting character, Charlie, had a very small part, and should be brought back. As for Keith? Not so much. Mr. DeMille's characters, John Corey and Paul Brenner, are so much better drawn. Maybe if John Corey had gone back to Spencerville, it would have worked.
