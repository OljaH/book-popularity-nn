Book 18 and Eve & Roarke never stops to amaze me.
I just love them so much.
I love their relationship and they are my all time favorite couple!
Not that you'll ever get the chance, but you'd also grieve.” Eve: “Wouldn't give you the satisfaction.
"Roarke: “You'd weep in the dark and call my name.”Eve: “Call your name alright.
And I'd laugh and laugh, that's how I''d call your name.”Roarke: “Christ Jesus Eve, I love you.”
I honestly don't know what to say about these books. She keeps writing stellar storylines, keeps me interested, makes me want more. You would think that after 18 books I would be rolling my eyes and saying... "give me something new" - nope, not a chance in hell. Give me something more is what I am saying. "I can't step aside on this, not even for you.""If you could step aside on this, even for me, you wouldn't be the man I fell for in the first place, would you?""Remember this moment, won't you,
I honestly don't know how Eve survived her childhood but survive it she did.
There was a major conflict of interest here between Eve and Roarke.
But in the end something has to give ....Roarke will fight for his Eve, his "darling", but it is not easy.
I love an asshole hero.
And not a fucking stereotypical Irish hero.
Eve is tough but she has her moments.
They are fucking heartbreaking.
I will end by saying that I still cannot believe that this author is the same author that wrote Irish Hearts, which I HATED!!!
Peabody, McNab, Feeney, Summerset, Whitney ...
I don’t know what to say any more. I am always repeating myself. But it is true. I absolutely love these books. J.D. Robb is an amazing author. Eighteen books in and I still crave more. Thankfully I have 26 more to go.I adore Roarke. His love for Eve is unwavering. “I love you.” His lips formed the words against her breast. “I’m lost in love with you.” Eve…..his cop. She loves Roarke endlessly. He is her rock. “You’re the love of my life. I don’t care how corny that sounds. You’re the start of i
His love for Eve is unwavering.
She loves Roarke endlessly.
I cried for both Roarke and Eve. More so for Eve because as much as she has worked at letting go of her past, it seems as though she will never be free of it.
It is heartbreaking.Love is such a complex thing for Eve. Roarke was the first person to truly love her.
The case was weighing on them both of them but Eve was strong as ever and determine close her case.
But in true Eve form she powered through it and made Mavis smile.
❤Here is one of my favorite Roarke & Eve moments.
I like every book J.D. Robb writes but this particular one is just brilliant.
Everything I like about her books is here in spades:)The story is slick and smart and Eve is in top form.
The way she handles herself under extreme pressure is brilliant.
The wicked one liners keep coming from all and sundry but especially from Peabody, Eve and Roarke.
And then there are the emotional bits when life in paradise starts to come a little unglued.
The make up scene is an absolute tear jerker.I had great difficulty putting this one down at all.
Loved every word of it:)
A cheating husband who gets killed in bed with his mistress, the wife's best friend. They are both stabbed to death. That's justice. Kind of hard to feel sorry for them. Eve makes her feelings on the subject pretty clear:Eve to Roarke:  “If you ended up naked and dead with another woman, I’d do the rumba on your corpse.”“You can’t do the rumba.”“I’d take lessons first.”He laughed, rubbed a hand over her thigh. “You might very well, not that you’ll ever get the chance.

Eve makes her feelings on the subject pretty clear:Eve to Roarke:
“If you ended up naked and dead with another woman, I’d do the rumba on your corpse.”“You can’t do the rumba.”“I’d take lessons first.”He laughed, rubbed a hand over her thigh.
“You cheating fuckwit putz.”“You’d weep inthe dark and call my name.”“Call your name all right: How are things in hell, you dickless bastard?
and I’d laugh and laugh.
It's easy to understand both of their points-of-view, but I still think Eve is way too bitchy to Roarke most of the time.Eve not only has RBF, but also RBM -Really Bitchy Mouth.
5 Stars...this is the series that keeps on giving!!
I am in awe of the fact that I am on book 18 in this series and it just keeps getting BETTER!!
The dialogue is amazing; the characters feel like old friends, there is nothing else out there like it…this series shines, but this book in particular burned just a little bit brighter…it was brilliant!Nora Roberts is hit or miss for me, but when she writes under pseudonym of J D Robb, she is spot on.
On a final note, this audio book was narrated by the incomparable Susan Ericksen!!
Suspense 4.5 stars / Romance 4 starsInteresting and twisted story.
My vicious side didn't feel sorry for the two victims at the beginning.
Can they kill cheaters in every romance book please?!Despite I suspected who was the actual murderer and what the twist was, I enjoyed the story.Romance.
Roarke and Eve had a fight.
Don't get me wrong, I like Roarke, but Eve was/is/and always will be my highest priority.
God, I love this woman!!!
This series is much more better that the most books I read, it deserves more than 5 stars!
This series is the ULT (as Mavis would say)!!!I love, love the fashion touches in all the books!!! It’s so believable! I keep seeing Ian and his crazy dresses!!!

Temporary tattoos, piercings, body art… WOW!!!
Double WOW!
And look now!!!!OK, this actually is not a review to the book, but since there’re ton of other reviews… LOL
For a large part of this book, Eve and Roarke cannot find their way to each other, they are estranged by their different reactions to some information that comes to light about Eve's past.
And the scenes of Eve on her own without his support...heartbreaking, even though she is and remains a strong woman who can take care of business on her own.
It sort of reminded me of Eve in the first book in a way that made me realize anew how far she had come.
This might be my favorite so far, but only because I'd read all the others (in order) and know and care about the characters so.
4.5 stars - Romantic Suspense/Futuristic/Crime ThrillerWhatever happened to me back in Dallas, I came out of it.
I'm standing here because of it.
Maybe I have everything that matters to me, including you, because of it.
I'd go through every minute of the hell to have you, to have my badge, to have this life.
His Eve. His miracle.I never in my life expected anyone would love me, all of me.
I'll never be able to find the words to tell you what you just gave me.You undo me, Eve. Who else would make me feel like a hero for doing nothing.
Intense book! One of my favorites in the series so far.
2017Finished reread - One of the few books I can say I love more and more each time I reread it.
Great plot line and police procedural and even better character relationship development.
Roarke & Eve struggle with an issue that is pulling them apart, causing a rift in their marriage.
The difference in what they both are, what they believe, what they can live with rises surfaces and threatens to tear them apart when an investigation leads Roarke to discover classified information about Eve as a child.
Is love really enough to hold them together?
Great emotional suspense!
A Must Read!

5 stars is never enough!****Even though I've read this countless times, it was just what I needed to reset my preferences and remember why E&R are THE couple in modern fiction. Awesomeness abounds, love conquers, characters are mature and worthy, and no one is TSTL. I used the bloody heck out of the highlight feature on my Kindle. ***Love***8/18/15 Another re-read...sometimes it's just great to go back and read the 'classics.':)
Divided in Death by J. D. Robb is the 18th book in the In Death series. Roarke asks his wife, Lieutenant Eve Dallas, to investigate a double homicide when one of his top security operatives, Reva Ewing, finds the body of her husband in bed with her friend. These books are amazing and just keep getting better and better. Reva is Roarke's secretary Caro's daughter and we find out more of her background. Fast paced and captivating, I can never seem to get enough of these books.
Divided in Death is the eighteenth book of the popular In Death Series, featuring Lt. Eve Dallas.
Former Secret Service agent, Reva Ewing, left the service to become a security specialist for Roarke Enterprises, owned by Eve's billionaire husband.
Roarke is convinced of Reva's innocence and persuades Dallas to help him prove it.
When Roarke is personally involved in one of Dallas' cases, it's always cause for trouble.
Eve can be annoying but I really love the relationship she and Roarke have.
Divided in Death was one of my favorite books in the series and I'm anxiously looking forward to the next one.
Page-turning, heart-wrenching, tough and a great ending. Another keeper for the shelf. There was suspense, twists and turns, some rough patches, emotional upheaval, revelations, some touching moments, good characters and personalities, humor, a little action, growth and everything in between. I laughed, snickered, held my breath, teared up a little, got aggravated, had a great time and am ready to go back for more. Totally Iced and Enjoy!
I suppose when your husband owns half the world that it's inevitable that most of the crimes Eve investigates involve Roarke somehow. This is a good one involving substitution, spies, and betrayal.
Not my favourite but still a solid instalment in this wonderful series. 3.5 stars.
Adoro 💜 Adoro 💜 Adoro 💜Como já por várias vezes disse, os livros desta serie são sempre os mais aguardados do ano. Foi espetacular!...Mesmo depois de 18 livros a autora ainda consegue surpreender.
Anger, fear, love, contempt, sorrow, rage and not only from who you'd expect.A colleague and friend of Roarke is suspected of killing her husband, but for Eve the pieces are falling into place too easily.
After finding data corruption on multiple computers, she suspects techno-terrorists.During the investigation, information about Eve past comes to light.
They can't come to an agreement on what to do and it's pushing them so far apart, Eve wonders if this might break them.All the books in the series I've read so far are good, but this one goes into the amazing category.
You get to see Eve and Roarke through their most difficult moments as a couple.
4.5 stars.
Eve is great!
You've just got to love her no-nonsense way of being a cop.
She is up against a lot in this book.
I'm not a big fan on the trips down memory lane with her past.
This one delved into her past more than some...
Who doesn't love a good conspiracy?
And, all the references to James Bond was great.
Also the dynamics between her and Roarke were pretty awesome.
Hey, no one is perfect!
I'm giving this 4.5 stars as I laughed, cried (Roarke is so perfect), and stressed out over who/what was going on.
It was great!
I know I've said some of the previous books were the best of the series and i'm sure I'll say the same for the subsequent books.
I just want to say that it is true, every book feels like the best one yet.
Their fights is not just made up misunderstandings or fights that can be easily resolved with "I love you's" as with other books.
They always seem like a real couple, they simmer in anger, both of them righteous but at the end they figure it out and work through it.
That's what makes them special and what makes this series special.
Liked this book, to an extent. Loved reading about Caro's background and how she came to work for Roarke.I found that Roarke and his "big balls" were a bit too big and his thinking so very narrow-minded. I guess J.D. Robb likes to confirm his violent tendencies. I know Roarke will go to any extent to protect Eve, but how could he not clue in to her feelings about the whole HSO business.Anyways, 2 thumbs up and 5 stars for Eve and Roarke!
Bol Roarke içeren bir hikayeydi, doyduk valla ilk defa. Ama ilk defa da Eve ile Roarke bu kadar çatışmış olabilir, ikisi de uzun süre perişan halde dolandılar. Eve'in küçüklüğündeki o olay ile ilgili acayip bilgiler öğreniyorlar ve sizi de bir hayli sinir ediyor, Roarke'a hak vermeden edemeyeceksiniz. Seri gayet güzel gidiyor, okunacak daha çok kitap var..
Para um livro tão fantástico, tão arrebatador creio que aquele não era o momento de terminar a historia e só por isso não consigo dar a pontuação de 5 estrelas, algo que me deixa muito triste porque o livro realmente merecia essa classificação.As nossas personagens favoritas continuam a deixar-nos sempre com vontade de conhecer mais um pouco sobre os seus passados e com este livro conhecemos mais um pouco acerca do pai de Eva e Roarke, sendo que foi interessante perceber como estas duas personagens malvadas estavam, de certa forma, envolvidas no passado.
Divided in Death4 StarsRoarke asks for Eve's help when one of his employees is implicated in a murder.
As she investigates, the lieutenant quickly realizes that there is more going on than a simple crime of passion, and the case may be an attempt to cover up an act of cyber-terrorism that will have devastating consequences.
A good installment with some intriguing revelations and excellent character developments.
Eve and Roarke's conflicting principles cause them to hit a substantial roadblock in their relationship.
The mystery is one of the more complex in the series with the inclusion of espionage, government secrets and cyber-terrorism.
Reva Ewing, security specialist for Roarke, is a prime suspect of the death of Blair Bissel, her husband, and Felicity Cade, her best friend.
Reva discovers her husband and best friend have been having an affair.
Now she is being framed for a double murder she didn't commit.I can't believe I am still not bored by this series, it just gets better.
I really missed all the characters but didn't know how much till I started reading this.
Another great exciting read.
New info on Eve's past is revealed, and Eve and Roarke have a big disagreement.
I loved it, the story was very interesting and grabbed me from the start.
Emotional....that's the one word that describes the 18th book in this wonderful series. These books just keep getting better and better. The character development is outstanding and the writing is amazing. Eve and Roarke butt heads quite a bit throughout the series but in this book it goes a little further and causes a rip in their relationship. Seeing them get through it and repair the damage makes this book one of the best out of the series.
Another great romp through New York with Eve, Roarke and others. The action built up nicely, using tension nicely. The final twist was a little telegraphed in my opinion, and I was a little disappointed at the lack of detail in the resolution, but I did quite enjoy the climax. There wasn't quite enough Peabody and McNab featured in my opinion, but I do say that about most books.
