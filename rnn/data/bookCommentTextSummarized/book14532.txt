There's nothing wrong with it, mind you, but it was still very early on in Pratchett's career, and it doesn't have the smoothness of his later work.
Granny doesn't have her friend Nanny Ogg as conversational foil and counterpoint in this book, and it's surprising how much that limits her character.
Another interesting echo is the relationship between Granny and Esk. Twenty years later, Pratchett brought a similar relationship to beautiful fruition with Tiffany Aching.
Even rough-hewn early Pratchett is better than 75% of all books out there.As a side note, this is not a bad entry point into reading Discworld.
The problem with Terry Pratchett is that you keep wanting to read the good bits out loud. In this particular case, I'd just reached the line "Her dress would have been both clinging and revealing, if it had had anything to cling to or reveal." Too late, I realized that not all the people around me were going to find this equally funny. I'm still embarrassed. Damn.
Telling the story of a young girl’s conflicting talents for wizardry and / or witchery.In the Discworld, men are wizards and women are witches – at least that is how it has been up to the point when young Eskarina Smith sort of becomes – both.
“I’m not a lady, I’m a witch,” said Granny.
I am very pleased to learn that my favorite witch will make many more appearances in Pratchett’s series – nine more to be sure.A good witching time atop Great A'Tuin, Equal Rites is one of his best.
The Great Pratchett Re-Read Continues!The third book begins the "real" development of the whole Discworld mythos, and rather than focusing on setting, it goes whole-hog (or Witch) into character and a rather deep social issue.It is, at its core, a novel about breaking down the walls that the sexes tend to put up to keep the other side out.
:) I didn't appreciate this as much the first time although I got the whole social bit perfectly...
But now that I've had the pleasure of reading every novel, I'm fine.
Isn't that odd?
Or perhaps it isn't.
BUT, of course, such things always come with time.
And yes, I can totally see Maggie Smith playing her in a movie!Esk, 8th "son" of an 8th son (on the Discworld, 8 is the most magical number), who inherits the staff of a pretty powerful wizard because - instead of listening to Granny - he is eager to pass on his wizard's staff before he dies and assumes that Esk is going to be a boy.The Unseen University, wizarding school that is not actually located on the Discworld but has a few access points there, one of which is in Ankh Morpork.The LibrarianHe used to be human, but due to a magical incident during Rincewind's adventure, he was turned into an Orang-Utan and decided to stay an ape because that was easier (and he likes the bananas).It's the first book about the witch called Granny Weatherwax.
If you saw me reading it, chances are high that you will have caught me cackling and giggling throughout most of the book.
I never thought that I would pick up any Discworld novel but the more I read of them, the more I'm inclined to pick up another Pratchett book.
They are light, fast-paced and highly entertaining.I skipped The Light Fantastic because a friend of mine recommended I read the Witches series first.
I cannot wait to read Wyrd Sisters, the second instalment of the Witches series, next.

Similar in spirit to the first two books in the Discworld series, once again we have a delightful duo on a journey, encountering many a merry mishap on the way. This book is not as funny as its predecessors, though the plot seems more cohesive and a little less meandering. Despite the distinct lack of trolls, this is probably my favorite so far. I really enjoyed the "Girl Power" theme to the book. At least I think I did. It could just be those darned witches using their "headology" on me.
This was a reread for me but it is years since my first read and I did not remember much of it!Loved that Death popped up right at the beginning and then Granny Weatherwax made her first appearance.
Of course this book is vintage Discworld and these two, along with others, appear again and again later in the series and develop into much more rounded characters.
Nevertheless Pratchett's humour is here in full force along with his wonderful descriptions and clever stories.
These early books are light reading - I polished this one off in a few hours -but they are still so good!
40'ın üzerinde kitaptan oluşan bir "Fantastik Seri" denilince "Diskdünya" bana okunması zor, birbirine bağlı, içine girdiğim zaman çıkamayacağım bir evrenmiş izlenimi vermişti.
Seve seve kaldığım bir diyar oldu.
Fikrine çok güvendiğim dostlarım (Özellikle Ozancan Demirışık ve Hazal Çamur) bazı kitapların bağımsız olduğunu, istediğimden başlayabileceğimi, muhakkak okumam gerektiğini söylediğinde Terry Pratchett ile tanışmak istedim.
Terry Pratchett fantastiğe sarmaladığı günümüz ile, inanılmaz dili, akışkanlığı, espri anlayışı ile muazzam bir adam/yazar.
Bence muhakkak okunması gereken bir yazar.
Ek ve faydalı olabileceğini düşündüğüm bir bilgi olarak; "Diskdünya" serisini hangi sırayla okumak gerektiğini merak ediyorsanız FRP.NET'in (Aynı zamanda Deli Dolu Yayınları'nın) çok güzel, bilgilendirici bir grafiği var.
[First read: 15th February, 2013. 3 stars. Second read: 7th September, 2018. 4 stars.] It was good thunderstorm country, up here in the Ramtop Mountains, a country of jagged peaks, dense forests and little river valleys so deep the daylight had no sooner reached the bottom than it was time to leave again. Up in the Ramptops, the Eighth Son of an Eighth Son is about to be born, and a Wizard is ready to hand over his staff. But it seems they've all forgotten that babies can be girls as well...I fi
But it seems they've all forgotten that babies can be girls as well...I firmly believe that Equal Rites is the best book to start with if you've never read Terry Pratchett or Discworld.Reading this after I've just finished the Tiffany Aching Discworld books makes me draw a lot of parallels.
There are quite too many our-world mentions and weak gags and occasionally the plot stutters, but altogether it is impossibly wonderful.It's a heart-warming book focusing on the Man Jobs and Women Jobs of the Discworld-and indeed our own.
Pratchett introduces her very well and keeps her grounded with her stubborn nature and inability to accept she doesn't know things.Eskarina Smith-the Disc's first ever Female Wizard-is similar to Tiffany Aching in many ways.
Executive Summary: Not as funny or as quotable as The Light Fantastic, but very enjoyable for other reasons. Full Review I had to double check the year this was written. This book still feels very relevant today.Wizards can only be men. Witches can only be women. Their magic is different and shouldn't be mixed. A women has no place learning to be a wizard. Witches "have their place". Does any of this sound familiar?As someone who works in a field that is far too lacking in women the idea that ce
This book still feels very relevant today.Wizards can only be men.
A women has no place learning to be a wizard.
Witches "have their place".
It sounds like this sort of thing is more common in later books, so I find it interesting that he changed up the style so early on in the series.And while it wasn't quite as funny to me as The Light Fantastic, there were more than a few laugh out loud moments and quotes that I highlighted for later.Plus, Granny Weatherwax is a great character.
Lacking other options Granny takes Esk to be admitted to the male-only Unseen University in the city of Ankh-Morpork and hijinks ensue.This is the Discworld's introduction to Granny Weatherwax, one of Pratchett's most beloved and enduring characters.
She is much more fully realized as herself in this book than I had recalled, but some of her best characterization won't come until she gets Nanny Ogg to bounce off of in Wyrd Sisters in a few books time.
Pratchett writing a nine year old in 2003 was a lot better than he was writing one in 1987, which is only to be expected.
For some reason I thought I wouldn't like this book all that much.
It's one of the first in the series, so for many people I talk to that's already a point against it, and I had it in my head that I will like other sets of characters better than the witches.
I'm already enjoying the series and I have some high expectations for the rest.The story is straight-forward enough, but how it gets there was far from any of my expectations.
Looking forward to more and more witches!4 out of 5 Stars (Best so far)
Celia Imrie does an amazing job here, breathing life to Pratchett's words.Equal Rites follows Esk, who is bestowed wizard power (and a very stubborn staff) at birth by mistake, which creates a whole world of trouble because of course girls cannot be wizards.
She is a brilliant character, which I hear returns often in the Discworld books, with her strengths and weaknesses, and a very particular way of seeing the world.
Pratchett delivers a great story that questions gender roles and inequality in a light and humouristic way, especially highlighting the ridicule, while throwing tons of clever play on words and cliches.
Does the pointy bit go in front?’Cutangle moaned.Granny Weatherwax who has her own sense of style...Granny wasn’t sure she approved of silk, she’d heard it came out of a caterpillar’s bottom, but black velvet had a powerful attraction.and class....Granny had the chance to become one of the very few women to learn what it really is that wizards wear under their robes, but modestly averted her eyes and followed the girl across the flagstones and down a wide flight of steps.even in the most, erm..., "romantic" of circumstances...‘Mr Wizard.’‘Hallo?’‘When I said hold on—’‘Yes?’‘I didn’t mean there.’ There was a pause.‘Oh. Yes.
So, when her ward Esk is rejected by the wizards, she steps up to console her and take on the established guild like only Granny can...She stood up.
No time to waste.’‘Um, women aren’t allowed in,’ said Esk.Granny stopped in the doorway.
The book definitely targets adult readers, so such a young protagonist doesn’t make sense.
On the other hand, Granny Weatherwax, the second protagonist and Esk’s mentor, is her usual grumpy and resourceful self, a champion of headology, which is a philosophy invented by Pratchett (I think).
I like Granny’s lectures to Esk: 
“If you give someone a bottle of red jollop for their wind it may work, right, but if you want it to work for sure then you let their mind make it work for them.
She is one of the best literary witches of the genre, and the more I read about her the more I like her.
Mixed into the slapstick silliness is a grain of philosophy and social commentary that is often highly quotable and thought provoking.The story reads like Wicca meets Harry Potter meets the theory of relativity meets The Dark Crystal.
I read the first Rincewind prior to this, and had heard the Witches storyline was better.
This is only the second discworld book I have read.
I do like the Witches story slightly better, but Rincewind was good also.
For years, I put off reading these because it didn't really seem like the type of story I would enjoy.
“Everything was a different color in those days.” “That’s true.” “It didn’t rain so much in the summer time.” “The sunsets were redder.” “There were more old people.
“Yes, I know.
And now it’s full of young people."Boy ain't that the truth.Terry Pratchett is so very quotable.
I've "met" her in some of the later Discworld books, and she's a great character.
This book looked at the issue of "women's jobs" vs.
"men's jobs".
“...it is well known that a vital ingredient of success is not knowing that what you're attempting can't be done.”
Although the third Discworld book, it is fine to start the series here.
There’s a full story arc and good characters, and it is humorous, just not as funny as the others in the series, and it started to feel long even though it isn’t.I have a few favorite lines:It’s a fact known throughout the universes that no matter how carefully the colors are chosen, institutional decor ends up as either vomit green, unmentionable brown, nicotine yellow or surgical appliance pink.The lodgings were on the top floor next to the well-guarded premises of a respectable dealer in stolen property because, as Granny had heard, good fences make good neighbours.She was opposed to books on strict moral grounds, since she had heard that many of them were written by dead people and therefore it stood to reason reading them would be as bad as necromancy.… the blow a baby gets to introduce it to the world and give it a rough idea of what to expect from life.
Como me viene pasando siempre con las novelas de Pratchett, esta es una historia que se disfruta muchísimo ya no tanto por la trama sino por la ambientación única y el estilo divertidísimo e inigualable del autor.
Por algo será que, de julio a ahora, he pasado de no haber leído ninguna novela suya a haber leído cuatro.
En Mundodisco, Pratchett se salta todas las reglas de la coherencia narrativa; hace lo que le da la gana...
Pues chapó.En concreto, de ritos iguales me llevo unas protagonistas entrañables y divertidas, y algunos conceptos de lo más interesantes, más allá de la comedia con la que están casi maquillados.

I decided that instead of writing commentaries on the Discworld books that I read a while back that I would actually give Pratchett a chance by re-reading them and I must say that I am really glad that I did.
Obviously things had changed a lot by the time that Pratchett wrote this book, but in a way he showing us how the idea that women should not do a man's job is nothing short of absurd.
Finally I would suggest that Pratchett is not necessarily doing anything new, but rather taking an old style and putting it into a fantasy novel.
By this point it seems the Pratchett had really honed and perfected his tone of voice and writing style, just the right amount of sark-y meets funny meets thoughtful.This is book 1 of the Witches series (which is a series within the overall Discworld series) and it's a wonderfully fun beginning to what no doubt promises to be a fun journey.
We get to meet Granny Weatherwax who is a Witch and is firmly set in her ways and ideas, at least until something comes along to throw a spanner right in the works - Esk. Granny is a great character with a lot of charm which more than makes up for her abrupt and somewhat dismissive attitude.
A pesar de sus peros, la bruja Yaya Ceravieja decide velar por Esk, ayudarla a convertirse en bruja y también en mago; llevándola hasta la Universidad Invisible para completar su formación.Como siempre ha sido un relato ameno, ligero, cortito, con sus aventuras absurdas y diálogos desternillantes.
La pequeña Esk me gusta cómo va cambiando y evolucionando, pero es que Yaya Ceravieja se come las paginas, cada dialogo de ella yo no podía parar de reírme, es un personaje único que le da vida a esta novela.
Mediocre, but not bad. I can definitely understand why others like Pratchett's writing so much. I'm coming to terms with the fact that I'm not a Discworld fan. I just don't appreciate Pratchett's humour as much as I would like to. Or maybe I don't like that humour takes the centre stage in his novels and I prefer a good story. Pratchett's world is charming but not for me. After 4 novels, I'm giving up on the series.
This was <3 The town's name is Bad Ass.The University's name is Unseen University. Esk has so much spunk. Granny Weatherwax makes me laugh and proud at the same time. I loved this sheer joy of a book. Looking forward to reading the entire Discworld series over a period. <3
Ne toliko očarana samom pričom. Ali genijalnost u pogledu sitnica je još istaknutija nego u prva dva dela. Veštica koja jaše na pokvarenoj metli - mislim da će mi ovo zauvek ostati slika u glavi! :) A sad, na Morta! 🤩
A brave move from Terry Pratchett as he moves away from his established characters and takes a shot at world building.I've been listening to the audiobook for the reread of this one as part of my exercise regime and it was quite the good distraction from the pain.The third in the now long running Discworld series moves away from Rincewind, The Luggage, Twoflower and the parodies of generic sword and magic fantasy epics.
My first venture into Witches series and I don't know why it took me so long. Although this book isn't on par with my favourite Discworld books (Small gods, Jingo, Hogfather, Interesting times ) it has all the charm, humor and cynicism of a proper Discworld novel. Eskarina is great character but Granny Whetherwax wasn't nowhere nearly as interesting.Anyway, I am eagerly continuing the series and I plan to do with Witches what I haven't done with any other Discworld series. Read it in order.
2.5 stars. A disappointment after really enjoying The Color of Magic and The Light Fantastic. I love the Discworld setting and will certainly read more in the series, but I did not love this installment.
Hahahahahahaha.***November 9, 2011Veronica's been feeling a little under the weather this week, and when that is the case, she likes me to read aloud.
And she couldn't locate the book we had been reading, so she decided on Pratchett instead.
They both seem to like it so far.***June 28, 2014The thing I really noticed this time is the way Pratchett makes up for his earlier omission of women at Unseen University by acknowledging how many it takes to keep the university running.
And I continue to love how Granny Weatherwax supports herself in Anhk-Morpork and how she gets around the wizards.
I'd really love to see Esk again, more grown-up, more used to being a first and only.personal copy
