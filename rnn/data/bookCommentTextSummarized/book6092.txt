The Transition of Juan Romero is an atmospheric story told retrospectively by a miner who experienced something inexplicable and dreadful in a mine years ago.
During the night the narrator and Juan Romero, a miner he works with, are awoken and compelled to investigate a terrible sound coming from the ground.
At one point Romero runs faster and disappears.
His disappearance is followed by sounds of terror and pain.
He wakes up to found out that Romero is dead and the strange new chamber gone.
So is the weird narrator's ring.The story has an undefined ending.
This story has so much potential but feels a little rushed. I would have loved if Lovecraft had expanded upon the idea and fleshed it out more, because instead what were left with is just an amuse-bouche.
Si bien la historia está bien, y me gustó que quedara en duda de lo que si le pasó a Juan Romero –de lo cual fue testigo el narrador de la historia- fue real o obra de un sueño; me generó mucho rechazo que Lovecraft escribiera con tanto racismo el origen mexicano de Romero. Hoy quizás este escritor tendría montones de quejas por xenofobia y seguramente se tomarían acciones legales sobre su persona.
Lovecraft has here succinctly captured everything I hate about his work.
We have a long exposition of not really creepy details leading up to a climax in which the horror is, well, not actually revealed, because it would be too horrible.
This is not.(Moved 2015 review to the individual work Sept.
2017 to make room to review the collection under its own entry.
Bonus points because I do actually remember this story rather well, but as you can see the bonus points aren't good for much when the story is already starting at the bottom.)
A pretty weak offering, that relies on a whole lot of implication of portentous dream shit happening, but nothing really does. But the ring is missing, so it must be real. The worst part of the story is this: One of a large herd of unkempt Mexicans attracted thither from the neighboring country, he at first commanded attention only because of his features; which though plainly of the Red Indian type, were yet remarkable for their light colour and refined conformation, being vastly unlike those o

Holy fucking shit.
I keep reading Lovecraft because I do like the mythology he created, and I genuinely like some of the stories, plus I've set myself a task to read this entire collected works, and I tend to keep at something like that, but fuck, this kind of blatantly nasty racism makes it hard to go on.
Lovecraft did not appear to really like this story. The story is vague; the location is just someplace in the American Southwest, and referenced supernatural forces are mostly just weird feelings. Lovecraft biographers also note that he does not appear to have in any way prepared it for publication. Original manuscripts have few notes or editing work. Frankly, it feels as though he simply lost interest in the story. There is potential here, certainly, but it feels a bit like a New Englander was momentarily fascinated with the American Southwest and lost interest before he could properly finish the story.
My first disappointment in Lovecraft's early works.Some early tension built up well, but the story seemed to peter out.At the end I was left wondering what I had actually digested and taken from it.There was a good story in here, it just feels poorly executed. Onwards to the next tale...
A way-too-strange Lovecraft tale. Some of his stories just can't be accurately described, I think its better when you read it yourself...
One of the moments I love most in Lovecraft's fiction is when his narrator beholds some unspeakable eldritch horror, and then, overcome with the sheer unspeakable nature of the beastie, he promptly passes out and leaves the reader guessing as to the true monstrosity of what he saw.
In the story, our narrator works manual labor at a mine and befriends Juan Romero, another miner who is seemingly taken in with the narrator's spooky Hindoo ring.
Both the narrator and Juan Romero are inexplicably drawn to the mysterious chasm....You know how it ends.
Interesting, but problematic.
As is common for Lovecraft, it would be better if written from a different POV, but Lovecraft would never deign to write from the POV of an Aztec descendant raised by Mexicans (however much he goes on about Juan being nobler and less base than his darker-skinned compatriots * gag *).
So, yeah, there's that.
Still, the idea behind the story could be done well.
A mine shaft, using explosives to get into that one last section that might still contain gold, and finding...
So many better, more interesting things could be done with that setup.
Оповідач разом з напарником Хуаном Ромеро видобувають золото в печерах. Під час прокладання нових тунелей копачі натикаються на велетенську порожнину, дна якої не видно і його неможливо дістатися. Поки наглядач вирішує, як продовжити роботу, всім оголошують вихідний. Головний герой і Хуан Ромеро, втім, залишаються в таборі. Вночі до них доноситься ритмічна пульсація з-під землі. Щось тягне їх у печеру. Всередині Хуан полишає напарника, втікаючи вперед. Коли оповідач наздоганяє його, то стає свідком немислимого.
It did have the H. P. Lovecraft language that I love, but I wish there had been more to the story. I hate spoilers, so I won't go into details, but in my mind he had the beginnings of a great story, and he just stopped. I know he likes to set up creepy scenarios and that his big thing, but he needed to take this one farther.
I'm not going to comment on every time Lovecraft looks down upon a race for its inferior breeding, because then I'd be here forever. Regardless, I did enjoy what is becoming a recurrence of events happening in a dream world will very real effects. Pretty neat idea, not that it's exclusive to Lovecraft.
Deep in a gold mine lies something unknown, tangible only by the giant subterranean hole. What follows is definitely Lovecraftian but, as often, while performant in setting the atmosphere, fails to provide a complete story.
H.P. Lovecraft - La transición de Juan Romero (1919)
Eerie and mysterious. It lacks the intensity and detail of some of Lovecraft's other stories but was enjoyable nevertheless.
6/10
Meh. Little suspense, no big reveal, no mystery. Obligatory racism.
My Rating System:* couldn't finish, ** wouldn't recommend, *** would recommend, **** would read again, ***** have read again.
Questo racconto non mi è piaciuto particolarmente.La storia non mi ha catturato e non ho sentito alcun brivido sulla pelle.
I liked this okay.
Out of all the early tales from Lovecraft, this is one of the few that are a complete miss for me.
Having not read up much on who Lovecraft was as a person, I'm getting hints of racism from Polaris and this tale as well.The story involves a narrator whom used to work at a mineshaft with a Mexican man of Aztec descent.
While Lovecraft is beautiful with his words, the story lacks any sort of momentum for me.
Apparently Lovecraft felt the same way because it was never published within his lifetime.
The narrator of this story doesn’t want to tell it.
Only now that he’s getting on in years does he feel an obligation to make a record of the extraordinary events that occurred at the Norton Mine October 18th and 19th, 1894.
Of himself, he wishes to say little, only that he’s spent some time in India and wore a gold ring as a memento of that time.
He’s assumed a common name and was working as a common laborer in the American West.
Juan Romero began working at the same mine not long after he did.Please read the rest of the review here.
Empezó bien, te describe bien a los personajes y el escenario donde se va a llevar a cabo la historia. También tenemos un misterio prometedor pero el desenlace fue una decepción total!No voy a decir nada más para no spoilear, pero cuando di la vuelta a la última página y me di cuenta que había terminado no lo podía creer u.u
Not Lovecraft`s finest work, but it succeeds in passing that feeling of mistery his world has.Probably due to its small number of pages and an objective of not showing the real horrors, the story doesn`t show anything other than the "there`s something out there".But besides that, it`s a good suspense tale.

**Leído para el Club de Lectura**Para la segunda entrega del Club de Lectura le tocó a Gloria elegir el libro, y se decidió por una selección de cuentos de Lovecraft.El final me decepcionó un poco, tengo la sensación de que no entendí el cuento xD De todas formas no estuvo mal.
The story starts when miners uncover a very deep chasm, too deep for any sounding lines to hit bottom. The night after the discovery of the abyss the narrator and one of the mine's workers, Juan Romero, venture inside the mine, drawn against their will by a mysterious rhythmical throbbing in the ground.
Unlike Polaris, which has a fantastic story to lessen the revolting racism, the Transition of Juan Romero is just a poorly constructed story dripping with xenophobia. This is the worst work by Lovecraft I've read so far.
Lovecraft is the Archie bunker of the literary world. He was an equal opportunity racist and rarely missed an opportunity to state his point of view. Nevertheless, generally his stories are worth reading but this one is not.
There isn’t much to the story or character, the real charm comes from the suffocating atmosphere and eerie sounds of the cave itself. Although, when it comes to his stories about an eldritch cave full of dark mystery, I think his earlier tale: The Beast in the Cave is much better.
