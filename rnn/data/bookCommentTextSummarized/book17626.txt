He could probably open his mouth and call me an asshole again and I'd still want to kiss the lips the insult came from. CoHo really missed the mark with this one, in my opinion. I really do like that she's moving more towards Contemporary and darker subjects - as with It Ends with Us - but this messy book took on mental illness, sexuality, suicide, abuse, even the Syrian refugee crisis, AND a romance. None of them were done very well.The book centers on Merit Voss and her family. They now live
I really do like that she's moving more towards Contemporary and darker subjects - as with It Ends with Us - but this messy book took on mental illness, sexuality, suicide, abuse, even the Syrian refugee crisis, AND a romance.
It feels like the entire Voss family spend this book being assholes and it is all wrapped up and forgiven without any consequences.
Sexuality is bad, and the heroine is considered more virtuous for having held onto her virginity like it's a prize to be won.And while people are saying Without Merit is not really a romance, I'd actually disagree.
I‚Äôm hoping to refer more to my experience while reading this book and what I learned from it than the actual plot itself, as I feel this will better direct the right reader to this particular story.
Anyone who devoured It Ends with Us last year knows that Hoover isn‚Äôt shy in dealing with tough subjects and trigger worthy issues (one of the many things I love about the woman), and I was blown away with the fictional tale shrouded in her personal family history to bring awareness to domestic violence and what can happen when the continuous cycle is broken.
Not my favorite CoHo book but it was still an enjoyable and quick read.
Full review to come!
UpdateThis was one of my most anticipated books of 2017 and somehow I have managed to put it off for a whole year smh.
I'm finally picking it up so you can expect some reading updates coming your way soon!
UpdateI HAVE IT!
---UpdateI don't want a freaking excerpt, I want the whole book!
Is that too much to ask?
---UpdateWhat am I supposed to do with my life until October 3rd?
----I don't even care what this book is about.
I would read CoHo's grocery list.
Uhhhhhhhhm...I liked some things. I hated some things.
One thing I can say about Colleen Hoover is that she never writes the same book twice.
I love that every time I pick up a book from her, it‚Äôs different than the last.
Merit Voss comes from an interesting family.
The Voss family is full of dysfunctional characters, and Merit is just as dysfunctional as the rest in a lot of ways.
There were so many secrets and parts of the story I didn‚Äôt see coming, and that‚Äôs always a good feeling while reading.
Everything is not how it seems when it comes to these characters and this family.
I have read loads and loads of books so I know a good author when I see one.
I don‚Äôt have a little sister or brother, but I could imagine her as being the annoying little sister that gets on everyones nerves.The storyline was attempting to paint Merit‚Äôs family as this crazy dysfunctional mess, but I didn‚Äôt really get that.
My family drama growing up was a crazy dysfunctional mess, her family just had too many secrets and once they were exposed everything got better within a week or maybe it was five days.
It played out more as a misunderstanding than a dysfunctional family.I don‚Äôt know you guys.
So many secrets in this house. And yet, the one secret I should have told years ago is the one I‚Äôve kept the quietest.  Colleen Hoover is one of best authors I've ever read and her books are always sitting at the top of my recommendations lists for every kind of reader!  Her books are absorbing, her characters are endearing, and each new story she writes is unique, relatable, and thought provoking. She has a very distinctive writing style that I absolutely love, I also respect and admire her a
Her books are absorbing, her characters are endearing, and each new story she writes is unique, relatable, and thought provoking.
She has a very distinctive writing style that I absolutely love, I also respect and admire her as a person -- the charity she has started is incredible, and each time she announces a new book, I count down the days until I'm able to read it.
The most important thing to keep in mind when reading this book is that perspective changes everything.
-3,5 stars-Well, it's not one of my favorite CoHo book but still I enjoyed it...
üôÇ And don't get me wrong, she is my No.1 author but I believe I'm the main problem in here because I think I was expecting something else.
Like maybe similar to her other YA books (Hopeless or maybe November9 type of story) but still this book was really interesting to read and there were a lot of things to think....
And in the end I liked this book.
I hope you give it a chance, who knows maybe you'd love it more than I did.
On the contrary, it is the ideal time to claim one another."It's just a house filled with people who are counting down the days until they don't have to live with each other anymore."It all begins when Merit meets the beautiful Sagan and in an unforeseen act and without hardly talking they kiss.
O como dice una amiga "mucho con demasiado".Como este es un libro del g√©nero YA por supuesto que Merit Voss tiene diecisiete a√±os (es tan dificil innovar y cambiar aunque sea esto?).
Los libros de Colleen Hoover han sido para m√≠ una mezcla de me gustan, no me gustan tanto y no me gustan.
üëÄüëÄüëÄ
From this stand point, I felt like since there was still so much story to come, I didn't want to think of this as the big moment that I was looking for.
And I feel like some people will come at me saying "well it's a story of Merit learning to love herself and her life!", but is it though?
I didn't like either of these characters come the end of the book.
Hell, I don't even know how much I liked Merit come the end of the book either.
Listen, it's been five months since I started reading this book and quite frankly, I lack the enthusiasm or desire to finish it; therefore, it's a DNF for me. Shame that.
4 STARSWow.Just when I thought I was done with YA, I stumble upon CoHo‚Äôs book and she pulls me back in again.Can she get any better? I doubt it.So meaningful. So deep.

Without Merit revolves around the life of a high school senior, and while this does deal with young adult characters, this book read more like an adult contemporary fiction novel.
I think there‚Äôs going to be a lot of differing opinions on this book.
I think the majority of Hoover‚Äôs fans will love this book, despite maybe not expecting what it‚Äôs about.
But what I think is even better is that this specific novel will open up a new reader base to her work and hopefully we will gain a lot of Cohorts with it.
Live amazon https://www.amazon.com/Without-Merit-...5 stars ‚ù§I loved Without Merit so much it was a 
*****FOUR STARS*****{ARC Generously Provided by ATRIA Books}No one would be able to determine from the outside of our house that our family of seven includes an atheist, a home wrecker, an ex-wife suffering from a severe case of agoraphobia, and a teenage girl whose weird obsession borders on necrophilia.Merit Voss is a seventeen-year-old girl who not only has to deal with the normal teenage angst most kids go through, but add on her strained relationships with her very eccentric family.
It was random, the family dynamic was messy and that's a fuckin understatement, but I decided to read on as usually with a Hoover book, it'll be gut-wrenching at some point.
What I've realised and learned in this book is that I 'thought' the family aspect felt unrealistic.
But then I thought to myself, what about the family made it unrealistic for me?And simply, it's because I haven't ever experienced or seen anything close to such dysfunctionality.
I mean, it's fiction, but that doesn't necessarily mean that such a mess of a family doesn't exist just because I haven't experienced it in my 27 years of living.
One thing that I admire about Colleen Hoover is her ability to write such beautiful, refreshing, and powerful novels!
Without Merit is nothing like her previous books that I have read.
Hoover will steal your heart with this one.Merit Voss comes from a very interesting and dysfunctional family (which I think most of us do have some dysfunctionality in our families whether you choose to admit it or not).
No one would be able to determine any of that from inside our house, either."Merit is a very unique and refreshing character.
All of the members in this household each had a secret of their own that Merit has kept.
4  It's all about PERSPECTIVE STARS Esta vez la conclusi√≥n es tan importante, que la pondr√© al inicio de la rese√±a:En conclusi√≥n: Without Merit es una historia de drama adolescente, que nos deja ver de una forma realista, triste y complicada lo que es vivir con una enfermedad mental. Les recomiendo que lo lean, por supuesto, pero adem√°s les recomiendo mucho que lo lean antes de leer mi rese√±a, que lo empiecen sin saber nada sobre la historia, y no porque los spoilers les arruinen la historia,
Vive en una casa que sol√≠a ser una iglesia y toda la historia sobre c√≥mo termino viviendo ah√≠ es muy peculiar y rid√≠cula, cuando le√≠ esa parte no entend√≠ porque la autora le dar√≠a tanta importancia a eso, pero por supuesto como en todo libro de CoHo, cada detalle tiene un papel importante.Merit tiene una hermana gemela, Honor, con la que no se lleva bien, es m√°s ni si quiera se tratan, cada quien lleva su vida separada de la otra, tiene un hermano mayor con el que tampoco tiene ning√∫n tipo de relaci√≥n, Utah, no se hablan, no se entienden, cada uno imagina que el otro no existe.
this book was about family, dysfunction, love, and secrets....Merit lives in a small Texas town and is certain her family is the most dysfunctional family ever....
she also made me think about the burden of family secrets....This book touched on many difficult subjects....
but it was all done very subtly using all these wonderful characters who slowly reveal their secrets to us through Merit....
this family has a ways to go, but I truly believe there is hopeThis character driven book definitely takes you on a rollercoaster of emotion and it is absolutely a ride I am thrilled I took!
Trigger warnings: suicidal thoughts or tendencies, depression, and mental illness.Without Merit is a very busy book that tries to accomplish a lot of things.
There is the set-up of how Merit is so interesting because she collects trophies and doesn't wear make up, and there is a promise of some big secrets (which there are a lot of, actually), but it feels like Colleen Hoover is really pushing this uber-quirky vibe to make her book different.
I hated how Colleen Hoover made it seem like forgive and forget was the right thing to do in that situation.

She crushed me with feels like If I could sum up this book into one word, it'd be tears.
Some people are perfectly okay with going into this book without knowing anything but other people may want to be prepared for what's in store for them.
This book demanded to move inside my heart and was like, "yo i'm just gonna live here".
I can't even label what this book made me feel like.
Now, I'm going to kindly excuse myself and go hug the book while crying because god damn these tears won't end.
‚û¶You know, sometimes while reading I keep thinking "Hey, I could totally write a story like that!" Provided that I could write.
lol‚û¶I'm not implying that it's easy to write a book.
Checklist, let's go:‚úîspend ages on learning how to write without sounding like an imbecile‚úîcome up with a somewhat decent romance story and characters‚úîhire an editor‚úîprobably re-write the damn thing 100 times‚úîpublish it anyways because I do what I want!‚û¶What's the point of all this, you ask?
I think anyone can write a book.
um? Im not really sure what I wanted from this book or what I expected but it certainly wasn‚Äôt this at all. I‚Äôm a little disappointed that it was a classic CoHo book but I still really enjoyed it. This book was a 10/10 absolute hot mess. I‚Äôve never read about such fucked up characters with completely messed up lives. I‚Äôm kinda just in shock about this book tbh??? I have no idea how to feel.
In the most simplistic form it's about Merit, a 17 year-old teenager with a twin sister.
Merit lives¬†with her family and there are issues that have not been handled well in the past.
The novel is narrated by Merit and it is heartbreaking, mesmerizing but most of all wonderful.
This book can be categorized¬†as YA, contemporary fiction and romance and is similar to books like Hopeless and It Ends with Us. Overall I enjoyed this novel and recommend it to all.

I STILL LOVE IT.This book is definitely different from CoHo's previous work but it still maintained them CoHo-styled twists which are all just A+++++.

Less than one month left ...
I repeat, LESS THAN ONE MONTH LEFT UNTIL COHO STABS ME WITH THE PINS THAT ARE ON THIS BOOK'S COVER.
‚òÖ‚òÖThere will be readers who believe this book was written just for them...and they will be right. It will speak life, laughter, and validation into their very soul. It will let them know that there is no perfect family, that there are no right or wrong feelings, that they can disclose seemingly insurmountable truths and survive, that they can forgive and give second chances, but most importantly that they must fall in love with themselves before they can fall in love with another. Without Merit
Between the character names and the over-the-top family dysfunction that was more like a PG-rated version of Shameless, I identified the various messages intended but did not feel them in my heart which saddened me to no end.
Maybe the fault lies in my present-day mood/circumstances, professional background in the field of behavioral health, my expectations about the CoHo experience, my prep for this book involving re-reading other well-loved Colleen titles, who knows.
4 solid stars. This book didn‚Äôt have the usual angst I‚Äôve come to expect from CoHo which was nice. The family dynamics in this book were somewhat unusual and yet it worked for me.
This cover alone tell you about the story!
This story was like you don‚Äôt want it ends but at the same time you can‚Äôt read it faster!I think the story wasn‚Äôt just about Merit, it was about her family, From her point of view.
He was like a great friend to Merit.
At the beginning I thought of him as a jerk but at the end I could feel his love for his kids.The writing was amazing and the story-line was just perfect!
I loved it and hope you enjoy it just like me!
