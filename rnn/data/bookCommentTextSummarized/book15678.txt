Same engaging character (Reacher,) great plot lines, wonderful supporting character development, and best of all, a nice pace to the story.After seeing the movie, I researched a little, and found out that "The Enemy" was the eighth in the Reacher series but actually was a pre-quel to the first novel Child wrote.
It really gives you a terrific insight into what makes Reacher tick and therefore gives the reader an improved perspective into the character as he is developed in the remainder of the series."The Enemy" starts off a tad slow in pace but as you read on, you realize it is all part of the development of the main character.
4.5/5 “You’re wasting your time,” I said. “And you’re making a big mistake. Because you really don’t want to make an enemy out of me.” Absolutely brilliant.You can’t go wrong with anything Lee Child has published. This is my eighth book I’ve read from him, and I can tell you that it totally exceeded my already high expectations. Such a fantastic read!In this installment, Jack Reacher, way back when he was still a Military Police, had teamed up with Lieutenant Summer to investigate the killings o
Such a fantastic read!In this installment, Jack Reacher, way back when he was still a Military Police, had teamed up with Lieutenant Summer to investigate the killings of two soldiers and one civilian.
There was so much happening that I wished I could turn the pages fast enough because I desperately wanted to find out the truth behind these murders!One of the things that impressed me about this book was that Reacher went from badass to super badass in such a strong way.
Highly recommended!**Each book in Jack Reacher series is a stand alone that can be read in any order.
I love this fast action, fast moving series. Jack Reacher is a mans man with a tough exterior and a good moral compass. I have not read this series in order but this could be the first. It is the explanation of why Jack opts out of his military career. The storyline moves along smartly with good characters who are likable and believable. I love when any of these come up as a Daily Deal. Dick Hill is not always my favorite narrator but Reacher is the perfect character for him.
This story takes place at Fort Bird in North Carolina.My TakeI just love how Reacher's mind works.
My heart raced, I cried for people like Kramer and Carbone for what they had to hide just so they could do what they loved [in the army!], and I was so angry about the lives destroyed just for jerks who want to get ahead.
Well, how would Willard understand loyalty, anyway?The CharactersMajor Jack Reacher is one of the best of the military policemen in the army and the top people know it.
I tend to read Jack Reacher (or simply Reacher as everyone calls our hero) in "batches".
You know jack travels around with no change of clothes, sometimes no money and meets extremely, unbelievably, impossibly beautiful women who all fall helplessly in love with him...oooookay.But here we get a really good addition to the series.
Jack being Jack (I mean Reacher) stumbles on to some very odd oddities and won't let it/them go...
Of course he won't, even if it means his career.But then, that's Reacher.Well told, very interesting and absorbing.
Child's best-ever writing, especially Reacher's personal life with brother Joe and his dying mother, poignant, honest and true.
For the first time, after 8 books and 8 years of Reacher, Child produces pathos and real honour.
Then your truck breaks down and your dog dies." Reacher's dying mother to him and brother Joe:"I'll be dead.
It's a part of life, missing the dead." The farewell scenes with Joe and his dying mother are superbly handled by Child, poignant and true and with death calmly presiding.
the twentieth century's signature sound is the squeal and clatter of tank tracks on a paved street.
One of the better Jack Reacher books--an interesting look at Reacher's earlier military career.
My Rating: 3.8/5The first thing I loved about enemy is the first person perspective. The story is well thought and detailed. Characters are well written in terms of how interesting they are. The prose goes down a skid in some places and you can actually guess a lot of the twists around the path but The enemy is a thrilling ride. It's a lot of fun. We even get to know a lot more about Reacher. Overall it's a good readI'm waiting to read the next book. Thank you, for reading the review.
I love the character of Jack Reacher, but sometimes the author makes the plots a little too convoluted.This isn't my favourite book in the series and at 540 pages it could have been two hundred pages shorter.It seemed that the plot was engineered to take Reacher to lots of locations, and ultimately it was getting a bit boring.This was one of the earlier novels, and I think the author has now grown into the character and spends more time with Reacher and less with contrived plots.
In this book, the bad guys are hiding and covering up things rather than planning future harm to Reacher.
That might be part of the reason it’s not as good as the prior books.Reacher wants to investigate a murder, but his incompetent bureaucratic boss orders him to write it up as a training accident and to not investigate.
That is the main threat to Reacher which is not as fun as when bad guys try to harm him.PERSONAL PREFERENCE DISLIKES:I did not like two things toward the end.
Usually I like seeing Reacher beat up and kill bad guys.
While "celebrating" the new year in the MP office he is called to a run down hotel where a 2 star general is found dead...
While visiting his mother in France with his brother, Joe. Secrets are revealed and his mother's mysterious past comes to light.I particulary like the ending and the explanation for background we have learned about Reacher in Child's other books.
This trip back introduces us to characters referenced in other books and gives a sense of how he was demoted before leaving the military...

Number 8 in the Jack Reacher series.This took me by surprise.
Number 8 in the series and it's back to 1990 and Jack is still in the army.
Jack is being threatened by his CO to do a cover up on the deaths but Jack is not buying it.
There is something very wrong going on in the US Army and Jack will break as many heads as he needs to to find out what is going on.Jack's number two, lieutenant Summer, is a young and very attractive woman.
It's full of army machismo.
The isolated relationship he has with his family - even his mother only calls him Reacher.We find Jack unexpectedly drafted to Fort Bird where on New Years Eve a General is murdered close by and things go to hell in a hand basket rather quickly.
The General's wife is also murdered and Reacher has to turn that investigation over to local police as its a civilian homicide.
Reacher also has to deal with a very upsetting personal situation and the most interesting point of the book is the history of his mother and what she did during the second world war as part of the resistance.
(Reacher page 559) 4 Stars The Enemy takes us back to Reacher's army days as an MP.
At the beginning of a new decade Reacher is suddenly transferred from Panama to Little Bird then a two star general is found dead and very much naked in a motel room.
The Enemy shows us how Reacher lived in the army; even then he still was not conventional.
(view spoiler)[ This novel shows us how Reacher got demoted from Major to Captain and shows the start of when Reacher stopped truly believing in the army.

This one just hit all the right notes.
A crime novel with an MP thumbing his nose at authority and solving multiple murders.But why was everyone 6'5" or 6'6"?
And the lone woman in it weighed 90 pounds?Okay, so a lot of it was some sort of bizarre wish fulfillment by the author but as long as you don't care about the research being top notch...Well, I'm going to shut up now and just saw that I liked this very much despite my quibbles.
It was exactly what I wanted right now and I enjoyed it immensely.But there are in fact only 206 bones in the human body.
Number 8 in the series and still going strong! Looking forward to reading number 9 - !
Prequel time. Rather than Reacher the wandering loner,  The Enemy  gives us Reacher the army man; Reacher the Major; Reacher the Military Policeman. Long before the events of the previous seven novels (and referred to obliquely in at least one of them) Reacher got involved in something while he was an MP Major and had to take a demotion as a 'punishment'. This is the story of that something.Reacher has been transferred back from Panama to a nowhere base in North Carolina. His transfer papers sig
His transfer papers signed by General Leon Garber (another name from a few of the previous novels).
The death of the General Kramer and the murder of his wife on the same day (that seems like too much of a coincidence) is the second story and the first case that Reacher finds on his plate.
There are a few 'yeah right' moments that are obviously in there to expedite the story, but the pace lets you forgive them mostly.I was left not quite sure who the titular Enemy was supposed to be though.
This is a Jack Reacher novel. He gets into trouble, he gets into more trouble, then there is a fight or something gets blown up, then everything works out, and Reacher moves on. Good stuff, but he is not Tom Cruise!
Although I figured out one clue right away, Child still managed to throw in surprises at the end.Amazing scene with Reacher and his brother taking leave of their dying mother in Paris:Then she revisited another old family ritual.
She stuggled up out of her chair and stepped over and put her hands on Joe's shoulders, from behind.
There are enough to go around." She kissed his cheek again Then she kept one hand on the back of his chair and reached out with the other and moved herself over behind me.
"What are you going to do with this strength?" she asked me.
4,25 stars - English paperback- I have dyslexia.This book takes us back to the army days of our main character.As an MP. Great plotting again. Aldo I my head I have a Jack Reacher of my own when I read the pages.
Didn't really do it for me...Weakest of all the Lee Child books I have read.
Aku suka dengan karakter Jack Reacher, Summer dan juga karakter-karakter lain seperti sang sersan yang memiliki anak laki-laki.
Yang sampai akhir bahkan ga disebutkan namanya 😆Aku suka settingnya, dunia militer digambarkan dengan cukup jelas.
Terdengar ruwet tapi ternyata penjelasannya mudah untuk dipahami bagi orang yang awam dengan dunia militer.
Tidak tertebak hingga akhir, meski kadang-kadang jd agak bingung untuk membayangkan kronologi waktu terjadinya karena imajinasi dan daya pikir serta ingatan kita benar-benar diperlukan untuk bisa membayangkan alibi waktunya.
Secara keseluruhan aku suka buku ini, meski aku sedikit menyayangkan tindakan Reacher di akhir bukunya.
Semoga kedepannya aku bisa membaca juga buku-buku seri Jack Reacher yg lainnya 💗
This particular book is a prequel to the other books in Lee Child's Jack Reacher series but he has said he thinks it will have more emotional impact if read after the first 7 and before the books that follow and he is right about that.When we first met Jack Reacher in Killing Floor , he had spent 13 years as a military cop and had retired from the Army. He was living a weird life which continued through the next books where he kept getting caught up in mysteries or being asked by some government
Reacher finds that he has been suddenly moved from Panama to a hick town in North Carolina right when 19 others are strangely moved on the same day.
Reacher can just steal some military travel vouchers and manage to travel back and forth to France, Germany, California, Washington DC , Virginia and North Carolina though the signatures are forged and stays in a luxury hotel in France.
In fact, people are constantly in North Carolina today, Germany later the same day then on their way to California tomorrow.
People don't just bop around like this in the military for no reason.
Reacher realizes that now the United State's "enemy" has dissolved, he'd better be thinking about what might happen to his job as an MP if/when the military is heavily reduced.
Death is every man's final enemy.Reacher's mom kept the fact that she had cancer a secret until it was too late to do anything about it.
But that statement is actually only half true: I console myself with the thought that unlike Reacher's brother, I know Mom still lives and I will see her again and can ask her to tell me the things I've been wondering about.
I enjoy the Jack Reacher stories yet I’m less sure about the story telling.
Whenever I have time away from the Jack Reacher books, it takes me a while to get back into Lee Child’s way of writing.
It isn’t my favourite Reacher story, but the notion of the story pulled me right in.With this one, we go back in time.
Throughout the prior books, I have been hoping to find out more about Reacher’s time in uniform.
It was an average read, even though the setting and story had such promise.
I'm going to add the same review for all of the Reacher series, so if you've read this one, you've read 'em all.
Jack seems to implicitly understand that he is a unique animal/human running around on this planet and that in spite of social conventions, cultural trappings, and whatever conventions and abstractions we allow into our mind in order to alleviate this core fact of our singularity (and aloneness)...the truth of it is not something Mr. Reacher denies.He embraces it.
Understands his philosophy implicitly, revels in his physical being,his conventions and values.
i like this book
The first Reacher book I ever read. Not long after I started it, I knew I wanted to read the whole series. Now I hunger for each new one as it comes out.
