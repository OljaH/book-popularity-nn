It's about a cute little duck who lives somewhere in China, and he's one of the many ducks that lives on some kinda boat, and every day he's supposed to get back on the boat at the end of his time hanging out in the water.
He gets picked up by a cute little boy, who then helps him get back to his boat, and he lives kinda-sorta-happily-ever-after on the boat with the evil man who occasionally beats him.
But despite the strange kinda-sorta message of the book, I LOVED it when I was a little kid because my mom read it to me all the time.
I'm sorry but we want to ban books that talk about sex and mention a cuss word but we can beat defenseless little ducks?
What the fuck is wrong with this picture?
With a little duck?
And I'll venture a guess that Ping did not like his life on the boat with his "kind master" all that much because his little feathered butt didn't go back when he knew he was about to get beat.
If little Ping would have grabbed the whip dude was holding and beat his ass with it.
The poor damn duck.
“The Story of Ping” is a Chinese story by Marjorie Flack and Kurt Wiese about how a young and beautiful duck named Ping gets lost in the Yangtze River after he tries to avoid punishment of being late.
“The Story of Ping” is a cute story about showing the consequences of disobedience and the importance of family that children cannot resist!Once there lived a beautiful young yellow duck named Ping who lived with his mother, his father, his two sisters, his three brothers, his eleven aunts, his seven uncles and his forty-two cousins in the wise-eyed boat on the Yangtze River.
Other than Russell Hoban's "Frances" series, this book is my favorite childhood memory. It foretold a life of distraction, rebellion, waywardness, all nighters, and the last duck home swat. I was fortunate enough to buy a Signed, First Edition this book at auction. It is a treasured possession.
I read this because it's on my daughter's five in a row book list for home schooling.
I'm sure it was a great children's book during the time of it's publication but it's pretty dated and insensitive by today's standards.
He runs away to escape being whacked as the last duck on the boat, then gets in danger, escapes, finds his family again and this time decides to be last and get whacked in order to reunite with his family and his boat.
My 6 year old said "He should have kept running away I bet he could have found a better home somewhere else".
I completely forgot about this book until I saw it at Goodreads. But I remember liking it a lot as a kid. It was first read to me and when I learned to read, I read it to myself as well. I was fascinated by the foreign setting. I don’t have a copy now; I assume at this point I’d hate the part about the spanking.
I think this is a product of completely sheltered city dwellers who have face no hardship in life and have no real understanding of reality.
People used to routinely suffer all kinds of injury and abuse, and often the teaching of a parent with a little whack on the butt prevented all sorts of future errancy.
These "modern" detractors who look for any excuse to shout against any corporal punishment can only be complete wimps who were never hardened by the knocks of life, and probably are destined for either a punch in the face of complete mental breakdown if the society around them ever crumbles the supports of their little world.
I instantly fell in love with the story of the duckling, the beautiful pencil crayon illustrations and the mystery if an land unknown to me.
History: What was life like on the Yangtze River when Ping would have been there?
Then, my mom got out our pencil crayons and we tried to replicate some of the images in the book - the colours in the sunset, the texture of Ping's feathers, and how the water looks.English - Of course, this is the no brainer!
I still remember the first time I heard of this book - I was watching Reading Rainbow.
Consequently, it lead to my first encounter with "The Librarian." After mustering enough courage to ask her where I might find the book, she helped me learn what a fourish-year-old needed to know about the library system.
I share all that to say that that was quite the ordeal for a four-year-old to go through if the book wasn't worth it and I remember it all vividly to this day.
These reports give a complete break-down of everything in the book, so you'll know just how clean it is or isn't.
I have especially fond memories of this book.
I just felt like I was there, on the river.Re-reading it this week brought to mind sadness at how quickly the planet can be changed by people.
The Yangtze river way of life is quite different than it was 70 years ago when this book was written.
In the 30 years since I became acquainted with the book, the Yangtze Valley has lost 140 villages, 1,600 factories and over 80,000 acres of growable land, and one species of dolphin to the Three Gorges Dam. That's unfathomable.
This was required reading as an additive for my 5 yr old's history lesson.
He enjoyed the story, and it was relatively interesting, I was just hoping for a little more Chinese culture.
So much more could have been done with this book, and so I was disappointed.
It's somewhere between a level 1 and level 2 reading level and it's a cute story about a duck's adventures after not making it on his families boat at dusk and having to spend a night on his own.
A somewhat engaging book about a duck that really has no cultural value.
Under a harsh totalitarian system, even corporal punishment is desirable compared to exclusion.
This kind of system is why North Koreans who find themselves outside of their country often try to return to the harsh rule.(view spoiler)[Ping is taught that life outside of the boat is fraught with worse fates than getting beaten for tardiness, like being eaten.
And it's not like being slow to the boat earns a duck a whack, it's being the slowest, as the punishment has a quota.
Every day, a duck is guaranteed to get beaten, so they can't get away with all being good to avoid this fate.
I love this book... Another of my childhood collection. It is a very cute story with an important message, conveyed in a way as to teach and entertain. It is a lovely small insight into the Chinese culture, as that is where it is set. My mother always thought it was important that I had diverse reading material when I was a child, and I am grateful for it, as I love this little tale about Ping, the adventurous and cheeky little duck.
The classic book, The Story about Ping, is a page turner, featuring a little yellow duck, who, in fear of receiving punishment, hides from it, only to meet something much more sinister.
The theme of the book is a combination of “the grass isn’t always greener on the other side,” “you don’t know what you have until it’s gone,” and “there’s no place like home.” Ping, who is personified with human-like feelings, is late arriving to his family’s boat one afternoon.
The theme is fully enforced at the end of the book when Ping spots his family, is the last duck across the bridge, and happily receives the spank that he so readily avoided earlier.
This story is about a duck named ping who dosen't want to be the last duck up on the plank so he doesn't go home .
He then gets lost and captured and almost becomes supper but is let go at the last minute.
He is finally reunited back with his family.
Ping a young duck with a very large family who gets lost and almost eaten and he is bright yellow.This story takes place on the Yangtze river in the 1900's on a boat.
I would recommend this book to little children.
This was a favorite of mine as a child and I read this to my own child and we both loved that naughty duck - it is all about getting the little spank and avoiding that consequence! Ping's adventures are infinitely human - we all want to avoid those nasty consequences, but in the end (literally and figuratively) we learn from the school of hard knocks or whacks in this case. The pictures and the story are equally wonderful.
I think I first heard this read on the Captain Kangaroo television show when I was three or four years old. I utterly identified with Ping as a fellow curious little person exploring the enormous world. I was hugely relieved at his safe return home, but then and every time thereafter that I heard the story, I felt that it was most unfair that the last duck in line every night got a spank!
*We had this in one of our school sets, and it was one of the stories Aunt Mary (and others) read to the girls at GmaKroeschel's often. :)
The duckling is being irresponsible by not going back to the boat with his family because he didn't want to get smacked.
I guess the message is supposed to be not to shirk your duty because you are afraid of consequences, but these don't seem like warranted consequences to me.
The guy wanted to smack a duck everyday and there was no way for all the ducks to avoid it.
It seems to me like that is a terrible way to run a duck farm.
Because seriously, the duck avoids getting eaten by the family in the book, but what did he go back to!

My children are both hooked on this book right now, but I'm ambivalent.
It's certainly engrossing and atmospheric, though I can't comment on whether its depiction of life on the Yangtze is even remotely accurate.
Much of the plot is driven by the baby duck Ping's fear of getting spanked for being last to enter the "wise-eyed boat" (sounds almost like a Homeric epithet).
"Spank" has now entered my children's vocabulary, and I was a bit taken aback to see my son pick up a stick on the playground Sunday and wave it about saying "spank." Mimesis in action, and not in a good way...
Ping was an adventurous duck who lived on a beautiful wise-eyed boat on the Yangtze River. He liked his life on the riverboat just and liked his large family and his kind master. He didn't like to be the last in line to board the boat at night, for that unlucky duck got a loud spank. This book is funny and adventure.
This book from my childhood gives a glimpse into the scariness of feeling alone, the kindness of a boy, and the security of being with family (including 42 cousins). All on the beautiful yellow water of the Yangtze River...
For those unfamiliar with the story, Ping is a duckling who lives on a boat in Yangtze River along with a flock of his relatives.
(The man’s reason for keeping the ducks in the first place is not addressed.)Immediately, many parents and teachers won’t like this element.
Ping ends up out in the world, and finds it is not a kind place for little birds.
(This is the only show of kindness from humans we encounter in the story.)Ping decides he’s had enough of the world outside and hightails it back to the boat, where he has to endure his “spanking” before reuniting with his family.
The setting is China, a place where, unlike today's transient United States, family connection is highly honored and protected, as it is in the story of Ping the spunky Peking duck.P.S. I have read several of the negative reviews from people who have probably graduated from Leftist universities and have learned to make a mountain out of a mole hill, who want to force people to think the same way as they do, and are evidently passing on this propaganda to their children.
We loved it.I distinctly remember being fascinated by the idea of the Yangtze River.
This was possibly the first book to make me realize that there were different cultures in the world beyond the American one in which I lived, and I am sure it helped to inspire my love of travel and exploration.Reading it as an adult I couldn't help but cringe a bit at the parts where Ping is afraid to be spanked, because I don't believe in using any sort of spanking as discipline and therefore it feels a bit strange to read my son a book with a threat of spanking.
Having said that, the spanking in this book doesn't strike me as abusive, or even really as punishment at all, but rather just a way of making sure every duck is herded onto the boat.
The strangest part though is that I absolutely LOVED this book as a child.
My mother hated reading it to me because she thought it was too depressing, but I would beg and beg and beg for her to read it one more time.
She said some nights I would ask for her to read it three or four times in a row.This, the strange story of Ping, is the book I learned to read with.
Why did I like this sad tale so much as a child?
And why do I still keep the exact same copy read to me as a child on my bookshelf?
I'll chalk it up to this, if you dislike the idea of spanking, skip this book.
I have never had to spank my child (we use other discipline methods that don't rule by fear of pain).
I strongly dislike spanking - do we really think our children are so mindless that they can only learn if physically subjected to pain?
And what motivation does that offer to learn proper behavior when fear of spanking is over?
Call me over sensitive, but I'd rather save books about physical abuse for when my child can understand it's fictional.
It's a short story about a little duck that takes place on the longest river in Asia. It pathetically tries to indicate the importance of family and maybe society with its leaders and lows and sometimes the punishments. I specifically didn't like the course of actions (wasn't smart at all). The main turning points of the story were baseless and idly happening to forcibly get to the goal. Or maybe I'm getting too old to enjoy such simply didactic stories!?
What a delightful story. My 4yr old and 2yr old thoroughly enjoyed this story and requested it several times as their bedtime story. It was a wonderful way to introduce the country of China in January for Chinese New Year. We visited the Forbidden Gardens and learned about some of China's history. Even my 2yr old made the connection after crossing a waterway and said "Mama where's Ping?" Needless to say, I was smiling from ear to ear!
