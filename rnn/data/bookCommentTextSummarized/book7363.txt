Young Eliot — Chris Buzelli - http://ow.ly/AfgL30aLNgZTime present and time pastAre both perhaps present in time futureAnd time future contained in time past.If all time is eternally presentAll time is unredeemable.What might have been is an abstractionRemaining a perpetual possibilityOnly in a world of speculation.What might have been and what has beenPoint to one end, which is always present.Footfalls echo in the memoryDown the passage which we did not takeTowards the door we never openedInto the rose-garden.
But to what purposeDisturbing the dust on a bowl of rose-leavesI do not know.
T.S. Eliot’s Four Quartets are as apocalyptically-sound as his more well-known The Waste Land (at least in terms of bored freshman who, in the fullness of time, will most likely only dimly remember sludging their way through the poem in some requisite English Lit courses), but whereas the latter keeps its cosmic lens rolling on the ecological, religious and human desolation brought to the early 20th century by the wonders of Imperialism and Industrialization, the FQ, on the other hand, carpet bombs the idea of consciousness and its relation with Time and Being.
I remember being at my first anatomy dissection as a demonstrator took this slim volume out of his pocket and said to me, in a room full of cadavers, "In my end is my beginning. Isn't that wonderful? TS Eliot. Do you know it? You must read it." If I'd read the scene in a novel I would have thought it contrived and overly theatrical. But I swear it actually happened.
This is the first record of my reading that I have not posted on this website in 6 and a half years.You can find my full review of the amazing experience of this book at soapboxing: http://soapboxing.net/2013/10/four-qu...* * *ORIGINAL: Well. I just... I... what I mean to say is... I think I...Holy fuck.Yeah, gimme a minute on this one, guys.
This type of poetry fills me with bewilderment of where was I till now and how it took me this much time to encounter something as brilliant as this! Seriously, where was I ?
Apparently I haven't put this into Goodreads and thought I did.
Ah well.This is really good poetry.
Don't trust me.
It's not very long, and you can probably find it in 30 seconds on Google.
Please go read it.That being said, it is rather astonishing.
Eliot has this rhythm, which survives even in Prufock, and shines here.
Themes from religion and nature and history.
It has overly religious themes, which somehow seem very universal.
History and the present moment.
Then read them again.
Then read them again.
Then read them again.
I heard not long ago a world-famous novelist decry Eliot's poetry on the ground that he was anti-semitic.
Insofar as I have just re-read them it was to appreciate again Eliot's persistent difficulty in expressing the ineffable, in using words no matter how brilliantly, to go beyond themselves.
The rest is not our business.(East Coker V)Words move, music movesOnly in time; but that which is only livingCan only die.
What particularly satisfies about the Four Quartets is that they complete Eliot's broad spiritual landscape begun with "Prufrock," "Gerontion," and The Wasteland, poems about failure in a bankrupt universe, but with the words from the Upanishads, "Datta .
In this later poem, Eliot once again includes the world of desire, fear, and death that haunted The Wasteland and other earlier efforts; but in the Quartets the importance of this darker world has been diminished, relegated to the sphere of time to form a mere backdrop to Eliot's expanded vision of life as unblemished eternity.

Eliot(Original Review, 1981-05-12)I’m always impressed by the influence of mediaeval mystical texts on 'Four Quartets'. This was the subject of a chapter in my thesis. These days, I would probably want to change some of the argument of that chapter, but I would not change the overall conviction that a primary concern of the poems was the maintenance of an almost intolerable tension between the way of affirmations
Eliot's True Masterpiece!T.S Eliot's poems are musical and spiced with sentimental preaching.
A short book of just 48 pages.
This book is a set of four parts "BURNT NORTON", "EAST COKER", "THE DRY SALVAGES", and "LITTLE GIDDING" which reflects the rigorous spiritual and philosophies that preoccupied within the poet.
I was extremely lucky to get the chance to read this book.
A gem of a book!
A true gem that should be appreciated.
I left the library in extreme awe from the great literary masterpiece I had just read.

  Review of "The Marijuana Papers"
"We can only live, only suspireConsumed by either fire or fire."

Just beautiful! This set of poems deserves many readings.
Non ho le competenze per una disanima critica di questo libro meraviglioso, vera pietra miliare della letteratura moderna: e impossibile mi è anche scegliere tra The Waste Land e questi Four Quartets.Posso solo dire che ho adorato la capacità di Eliot di cambiare tono, di arrivare a versi perfetti esteticamente per poi passare ad una scrittura totalmente intelligibile, ma sempre evocativa e visionaria.
Non ho potuto che pensare a Borges e alla sua capacità di rendere letteraria la metafisica.Dopo questa lettura credo che la poesia non abbia limiti, nè confini - anzi, forse può raggiungere territori superiori a qualunque prosa.

پس زجر را کدام کس ساخته است ؟ عشق ، عشق نام ناآشنایی ست ، پشت دستانی که پیرهن تحمل ناشدنی شعله را ببافند . پیرهنی که نیروی انسانی توان کندنش را ندارد . او باریده ی آتش یا آتش که فقط ما می زی ایم و دم می زنیم .یک کتاب خوب از الیوت با ترجمه ی نسبتا خوب .
If you read this to yourself out loud and slowly, it will echo in your head the rest of your life. I think it will last forever.
Four Quartets is one of the most astounding pieces of writing I've ever encountered. It may start off strange and esoteric, but it becomes more and more familiar through the reading, until you feel almost as if you are experiencing Eliot's journeys and musings instead of reading a poetic result of them. It builds upon itself in the most transparent yet masterful ways. An incredible experience for me as a writer and a thinker.
I think that "Four Quartets" is Eliot's masterpiece and one of the great poetic works of the twentieth century.
Of the four, my favourites are the first and the last, but all four have moments of Epiphany such as this section in "East Coker":"Love is most nearly itself When here and now cease to matter.
In my end is my beginning."The intellectuality in Eliot's use of an intricate allusive approach combined with a depth of spirituality creates a powerful meditation that one can read again and again.
I need to read this beauty again ❤️
Caution : this is a 5 stars rating ,( obviously like everybody here on Goodreads ) the rest of the stars are coming along when I understand what does this  poetry  mean , or when my mind evolve to understand such a poetry :)

Beautiful, mesmerising poetry.
There is so much to contemplate in these four poems about time, faith and spiritual belief, whether the reader is a practising Christian, or a humanist, or a follower of a philosophy such as Buddhism.
It is a meditation on the human condition.
If I knew less about European history and Christianity, I probably wouldn't get the subtle points of the writing. Eliot's rhythm and universal themes balance the rest out, but I'll probably need to come back to it.
My favorite work of Eliot's.
I said to my soul, be still, and let the dark come upon youWhich shall be the darkness of God

T.S Eliott himself, apparently, didn't like it.
The musical master of the mundane himself disparaged the wide acclaim of the piece, I presume because everyone knows that if the masses cheer you then you are doing something wrong.
But I read this with a wine glass in hand, a silly jingle like song in the background and it was midsummer.
My companion took heart in Lou Reed, and I looked forward to all four quartets: the ones of the day, the year, and who knows, maybe even lifetime.
Honestly there are still many lines that I still can't manage to decipher. guess I will need to read the commentaries as well. But these pieces were so amazing.
This quartet of longer poems is Eliot's very best and most provoking poetry. He has become a sort of Modernist monster over the years, but forget Prufrock and read this. His allusion to Beethoven's Four Quartets is apt. Eliot did not publish anymore poetry after this text, and Beethoven's quartet with four movements was his last finished work. Listen to the Beethoven quartet. Read Taking the Quantum Leap. Read about Sanskrit and Hinduism as well, appreciate this intricately layered poem even more. The quartets are steeped in canonical mystery; you can almost smell the Frankincense and lotus.
We shall not cease from explorationAnd the end of all our exploring Will be to arrive where we started And know the place for the first time.James Joyce famously accused TS Eliot of plagiarizing from Ulysses in his "Waste Land." And some have made the case that the Cad (who can be seen as a usurper) in Finnegans Wake is either or both at the same time Joyce dethroning Yeats or Eliot threatening Joyce.
I do understand that he does repeatedly tell us to live in the moment:“What might have been and what has beenPoint to one end, which is always present.”And I do love the flow of words, the images, the entreaties such as:“Descend lower, descend onlyInto the world of perpetual solitude.”But I’m most thankful for these marvellous lines:“For most of us there is only the unattendedMoment, the moment in and out of time,The distraction fit, lost in a shaft of sunlight,The wild thyme unseen, or the winter lightningOr the waterfall, or music heard so deeplyThat it is not heard at all, but you are the musicWhile the music lasts.
These are only hints and guesses,Hints followed by guesses; and the restIs prayer, observance, discipline, thought and action.The hint half guessed, the gift half understood, is Incarnation.”
A spiritual mediation on existence contemplated in shades of light and gloam, Four Quartets is beautiful, concurrently haunting and illuminating.“I said to my soul, be still, and let the dark come upon youWhich shall be the darkness of God.”
A book I'm not going to rate until I read it at least ten more times.
I don't explicitly understand 95% of it; the majority of my understanding is intuitive.
That is Eliot's great strength—leaving room for intuition.
I feel like I have been drug through a room of great mystery or as if I have skimmed a book of semiotics written by a mystic.
I feel full and empty at the same time.
Mystical and mystified.
Ugh. I'll read some commentaries shortly and hopefully gain some insight.
*Interested to look more deeply into Eliot's views on history and place through these poems.*
From BBC Radio 4 - Saturday Drama:Jeremy Irons reads Four Quartets by T.S.Eliot.Four Quartets is the culminating achievement of T.S. Eliot's career as a poet.
While containing some of the most musical and unforgettable passages in twentieth-century poetry, its four parts, 'Burnt Norton', 'East Coker', 'The Dry Salvages' and 'Little Gidding', present a rigorous meditation on the spiritual, philosophical and personal themes which preoccupied the author.
It was the way in which a private voice was heard to speak for the concerns of an entire generation, in the midst of war and doubt, that confirmed it as an enduring masterpiece.With an introduction by Michael Symmons Roberts, Lord David Alton and Gail McDonald.
Eliot could not have know how well he spoke when he wrote about “this twittering world.” 😊Here is the complete section: “Here is a place of disaffectionTime before and time afterIn a dim light: neither daylightInvesting form with lucid stillnessTurning shadow into transient beautyWith slow rotation suggesting permanenceNor darkness to purify the soul Emptying the sensual with deprivationCleansing affection from the temporal.Neither plenitude nor vacancy.
My first experience of Eliot's interlinked poems was through an old vinyl recording of Alec Guinness reading them.
I knew that some of the poems were written during the Second World War and that they were steeped in Christian mysticism, and so set out to learn more about them.
Now I see read these poems not so much as an attempt to explain (and justify) the via negativa of the Christian mystical tradition (with some Hinduism thrown in), but as reflections on the failures of old age and the evanescence of time as our expectations, hopes, and dreams gutter and die.
Eliot displays some incredible poetic craftsmanship, which was especially evident to me in The Dry Salvages, but was obviously present throughout the work.
I absolutely loved the way that images and phrases kept returning and changing across the work, adding meanings and taking on new connotations with each repetition.
I feel like that varied repetition gave the poem a very organic feel, like Eliot was thinking through things and trying to figure out the very things he was explaining.
The Four Quartets moved me with their beauty and honesty, and that is, in the end, what I value most in a work of art.
When I heard an Eliot scholar compare Four Quartets to Chartres Cathedral, I chuckled to myself and thought the man smitten. But after reading the poems repeatedly and subjecting the edifice to a thorough inspection, I think the man was right. This is the work of a poetic architect, a craftsman who joyfully builds whispering galleries in places where martyrs come to die. Eliot's theology seems cumbersome at times, but I think his theological position is less dogmatic than many think. There are many rooms in this mansion, and exploring them in detail was a singular experience.
I happened, by coincidence, to read this poem on the eve of my aunt's funeral.
It seemed to be the perfect poem for a funeral-eve.
Some lines I want to remember from "East Coker":In my beginning is my end.
In successionhouses rise and fall, crumble, are extended,are removed, destroyed, restored, or in their placeis an open field, or a factory, or a by-pass.Old stone to new building, old timber to new firesOld fires to ashes, and ashes to the earth...The only wisdom we can hope to acquireIs the wisdom of humility: humility is endless.The houses are all gone under the sea.The dancers are all gone under the hill....In my end is my beginning.
"Η περιέργεια των ανθρώπων ερευνά το παρελθόν και το μέλλονκαι προσκολλάται στη διάσταση αυτή. Αλλά η κατανόησητου σημείου διατομής του άχρονουμε το χρόνο, αυτό είναι απασχόληση για τον άγιο-ούτε απασχόληση ακριβώς, αλλά κάτι που δίνεταικαι παίρνεται, πεθαίνοντας μια ολόκληρη ζωή μες την αγάπη,ζήλο και ανιδιοτέλεια και αυτοπαράδοση."
I've been coming back to this book over and over again since my teens, and I never fail to find some new wonder within its lines, just as I sense I'll never fully grasp the astonishing wholeness of it.
Eliot's almost musical air-earth-water-fire musings have given me a fascination with Time's cyclical nature and the notions of all past and future:Time past and time futureWhat might have been and what has beenPoint to one end, which is always present.The end is always just the beginning, so “Not fare well,/But fare forward, voyagers.” The Four Quartets, really, is a book I can't read enough.
This is a lifelong (or at least adult-lifelong) favorite of mine.
I return to it every year or so.
One of the great poetic reveries on Christianity and on the nature of eternity, immortality, and ethical purpose.
As a nonbeliever, I find these four poems convincing and intelligent as regards one particular religion.
As a transient sapient being in a boundless universe, I find them breathtaking in their attempt to pierce through the here and now into the transcendant and timeless.
That ability to perceive and depict the unknowable is, for me, one of the greatest consolations, justifications, and uses of art.
