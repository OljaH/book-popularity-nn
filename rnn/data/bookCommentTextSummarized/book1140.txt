I read every Bobbsey Twins adventures I could get my hands on from the age of 9 through 11. Summers were wonderful and I could borrow from the library and read these books. I could borrow 8 books every 2 weeks. Soon, I needed more than that and had to fight the librarian for more books. Now, I can do 8 books in a day. Sigh.
Growing up in the '50's, I owned and read the first 40 of the Bobbsey Twins. These are the books that first hooked me on reading. These old editions are terribly racist, but there are new ones that have eliminated that problem. But for this reason, I am not rating the series.
