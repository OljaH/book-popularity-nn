GREEK MYTHOLOGY.
GREEK MYTHOLOGY.
So much abuse.
So much abuse.
Did I mention abuse?
Hundreds of pages of rape, beatings, prostitution, slavery...
(view spoiler)[ The hero gets beaten and raped every other page.
Seriously hundreds of pages and still no heroine.
Hades, the Greek god of death and the Underworld, stood in the center of his throne room.
Hades is not the god of death (that's the implacable Thanatos).
I take my mythology very seriously.I know most of you love this book.
I'm not really the black sheep...
more like a dark grey sheep.
It was like I suddenly saw light after being in this tunnel of darkness with Acheron.There were so many memorable characters in this story that I either hated or loved with total passion.Acheron, beautiful, broken,lonely, lost....
I adored the modern Greece parts in this story, so vividly described that made me feel that I was right there, on a Greek beach looking for Atlantis as well.I loved the connection and chemistry between Tory and Acheron.
The roll call of characters is impressive at this point; the readers of Acheron need to know their Dark-Hunter history, and reviewing a play list before picking up the book might not be a bad idea (unless, of course, you’re a geek gyrl like me, in which case these people are like fictional family members, already.)Acheron, son of Atlantean gods, born into a human body and cursed by the Fates, attracts readers like no other member of Ms. Kenyon’s cast of players.
In this book that bears his name and his emblem, we learn so much about his history, and what forged the God we know in the current timeline of the series.Ms Kenyon addresses the pressing questions surrounding the relationship between Ash and Artemis, or as Simi calls her, the Heifer Goddess.
I hated most of this book.Book 1 Acheron's torturous human life: Good stuff. Artemis was always a bitch.Book 2 Present Day: Crap shit. Did someone else write this book? I wasn't buying any of it, and I had many moments of extreme eye-rolling.I don't know what was worse, the horrible music and cheesey serenade in the club, or Acheron saying he wanted Tory on a platter. It didn't seem like those were things he would do or say at all.
The story that starts when Ryssa’s diary finishes and concludes when Acheron - as finally a God- depends completely on Artemis in order to feed.Part 4: Acheron starts training his Dark Hunters (you may have already read this story in The Beginning-Dark-Hunter #0.5)TIME PERIOD 1: PRESENT DAYPart 5: When Acheron meets SoteriaPart 6: Epilogue and happily ever afterDuring the first time period (BC); Acheron experienced hatred, abandonment, betrayal, fear, pain, humiliation, weakness, torture, rape, hunger and thirst.Acheron was the kid that his parents did not want to know.
It's one of the most emotional, gut wrenching, heartbreaking books I've ever read, but at the same time it was inspiring, uplifting and completely amazing.
And I just can't find the words to do this book justice.If you're a fan of Sherrilyn Kenyon's Dark Hunter series, (and who isn't?) Acheron is a dream come true.
We finally get the answers to so many questions and get into the heart of the true hero of the series.
The bottom line - This is one of my absolute favorite books ever, and I can't tell you how many tissues I went through by the time I was done reading it.
So of course I'm a fan!;)There are many others, Apollymi(whom I love), Lysa(for whom I don't feel neither hot nor cold), Nick(who starts to get on my nerves), the Dark Hunters and the Weres but if I list them all the review will be longer than the book!The story.The story is written in two parts, the first one is Acheron's past(11.000 years ago), and the second part is in the present.Acheron's past was painful to read and I mean it, I felt pain in every page.
I think I liked it more because Acheron finally got his HEA than I did because of the story itself.Generally the book was addictive.
This book was awful.
The first part of the book was just the same thing over and over.
Tory was weak, weak, weak,as a character and just not right for acheron at all.
Well since he turned into a wimp in this book maybe they did make a good couple?
I think maybe Acheron and Phury from J.r. wards lover enshrined, took a class together on how to become whiney wimps, and they both graduated with A's in my opinion.
In this class an A was not the grade to shoot for.
It is an emotional read, but I think some of the reviews (on here and on other boards) are over doing it a bit when reviewing the first part.
I think JR Wards books are equal in the emotional angst and tortured hero storyline, so dark-hunter fans should not hold off for fear of getting too emotional.
And the world building remained solid and true to what we learned it all her other books, but it was great to read the history of Acheron and the dark-hunters all in one book.
OMG I give this book more than 5 stars So So good!!!!!! Poor Acheron I cried at lest 4 times while reading this book and I am not a crier!!  It was so sad to see what Acheron lived through and man do I hate Artemis what a dirty BITCH she is........I love this book love that Acheron got his happy ending I loved Tory's personality.
*** 5 Agapay Achimou STARS ***   —Fui destrozado como niño y hecho a un lado, igual que un trozo de basura que nadie quiere. Pero tú no me tratas de esa manera. Ves en mí únicamente al humano y tocas cada parte de mí. Me haces sentir completo y querido.   Haber pasado por catorce libros antes de llegar a este valió la pena, Ash vale totalmente la pena. Este libro destrozó mi corazón lo machacó y lo hizo trocitos para después volverlo a unir, me hizo bajar al tártaro para después llevarme a los

I reread this this weekend,and it still brings tears to my eyes what Acheron went though at the hands of people who were suppose to love and take care of him and the sick terrible things that the gods did to him also.The first half of this book is a gut wrenched.But the second half is full of redemption and Acheron finding love and for the first time in his life knowing the touch of someone who did not want to hurt him in some way!
Soteira is determined not to be put off by Acheron's bad ass actions and soon these two very different people will both have their moment of happiness and forever!!!
Acheron has always been my favorite Kenyon character and I will always love this dark hunter!!!
I can’t say much about the book because literally everything that happens in it from start to finish is basically one giant spoiler… but it tells the story of Acheron, a deeply tortured, powerful, heart-stoppingly gorgeous and yet utterly mysterious character who we have seen over the past 14 books.The first half of the book tells his back story.
Acheron is without a doubt, THE most tortured character in the history of paranormal romance… or maybe just, ever.The second half of the book tell his present day story… and what leads to his beautiful happily-ever-after.
I finished "Acheron" by Sherrilyn Kenyon in the wee hours of the morning.
Each time I finished a chapter and thought, "Whew, now things will get better for him." But they didn't.
I liked the fact that the author warned us in her note at the beginning of the book that the story would be painful.
But by providing a happy ending for him, Kenyon really made this book a paean to all those who have experienced abuse and overcome.I won't take the time to retell any of his story.
My emotions are still reeling, hours after I finished with the happy ending.
Rating Clarification: 4.5 stars.Acheron is an incredible book, the best of this series hands down.
The book is divided in two very different parts:The first part is Ash's past, his life story.
After such an overwhelming and painful past, his present, his true love story, deserved to be much more than what he got.
I wish his love story could have been memorable,like his life was, instead of just one of many in the Dark Hunter series.
I'll keep reading the Dark Hunter series, but this book is going to be hard to top.
0.5 star a.k.a did not like it at all Frustrating and depressing. I decided to read this because it has amazing ratings. Warning: I used a lot of the word 'too'This is not for me. All of the characters were too evil, except one. Yes, Acheron. Unfortunately I didn't like him either. While others were too cruel, he was too kind. I didn't care with everything else anymore because the characterization was already a major problem with this book.Acheron was too tortured. Way too much. It was too sad.
I didn't care with everything else anymore because the characterization was already a major problem with this book.Acheron was too tortured.
Every single character in this book was too weird (view spoiler)[I liked Acheron's sister.
(hide spoiler)] especially Acheron's mother.
Whatever reason she had (to save her son, to protect him, blah, blah, blah) I just couldn't bear it.
There were also Acheron's father and his uncle.
and Acheron just accepted it all with a humble heart.
Perhaps she was too damn sexy so Acheron was totally fine with some sport like beating-kicking-punching-'till-bleeding after sex.
So, let’s start with the first part of this book which will reveal to us the truth about who he really is.Acheron was born cursed and doomed to a life of misery.
My heart broke for him and all that he endured through his entire human life.
It’s him!After all he had been through, I truly rejoice that he finally found the woman who would stand beside him, who would give him true love, loyalty, solace, and care, without expecting anything in return.
This is one of my memorable reads.I LOVE THIS BOOK.
I am giving up on this book.
I left it in my currently-reading shelf for months to force myself into picking it up again but I don’t even feel like skimming through it anymore.
I simply don’t want to waste my time when there are so many good books around.
This book was a big disappointment and I am sorry to say that I found the writing very poor and the whole story read like a very poorly written fanfiction, repetitive, predictable and stupid, with cartoonish characters that lacked any depth or humanity.
Let's move the conclusion from the end to the beginning : Acheron was my favorite book of the series so far.
If I couldn't buy into Stryker's redemption (yes, I've read ahead before coming back to review) when he had far less to be redeemed for (although, killing your own son is detestable), how am I ever going to subscribe to Styxx's story?
Tory (present day) was a rehash of several other females in this series who just wanted to love and care for their man and take away their hurt.
Postergué demasiado tiempo este libro por la nostalgia que me causaba saber que develando los misterios de Aquerón, finalizaba, al menos para mí, una de las sagas fantásticas más entretenidas que he leído.
La espera se ve recompensada, ya que es un libro simplemente maravilloso, que nos entrega con extremo detalle la vida de Aquerón, desde su nacimiento y todas las circunstancias que rodearon su crecimiento, hasta el presente.
Permite entender cabalmente como se convirtió en el líder de los Cazadores Oscuros y se nos regala al fin una historia en la que él es el protagonista.
Acheron's story was the one I had been anticipating the most of all the characters we have met over the course of the Dark-Hunters series and we finally got it with this book.
This was easily the best book in the Dark-Hunter series so far and had loads of the stuff(humour, action, romance, and bickering Gods and demons) that make the series such a fun one to read.
All in all I loved this latest Dark-Hunter book and just hope there are a few more stories in the series that are as great as this one!
Yes, I know that Ash's human life was horrible, but I had so many people warn me about how abused he was that I was ready.
Really, there are two books - Ash's human life story, and then a normal Dark Hunter, paranormal romance novel.
And, even though he had a sister who loved him, she actually brought him more abuse every time she tried to "help" him.
Ash meets Tori, who doesn't like him at first.
The awesome thing is that Tori learns to love Ash for things other than his looks.
The only problem with this romance is that I want Ash for myself, so...
The first half was seriously depressing.
I agree with a couple others that Tory lacked the substance in a heroine..especially for our beloved Ash. I just kept thinking really this chic?
Also I thought Katra would be in the second half more.
Why isn't she supporting Ash or standing up to Artimes?
This is her father after all.
I loved seeing him in the father role in Devil May Cry and then she was mostly absent from the present day part of Acheron?
I love the DH Series and this one just didn't do it for me.
It felt like an entirely different book, for a few reasons.
Also, characterization for Acheron changed so much from ancient days to current times that he felt like a different person.
Disorienting.Tory would not, should not, must NOT succumb to Ash-hole so easily, after he ripped her entire career --- her life's work -- to shreds.
Plot contrivance at the expense of consistent characterization.Acheron is supposedly the most dangerous and destructive god and Artemis is scared of him??
Again, Ash's characterization pays the plot steerage fee.Nice wedding scene.
Nice brothers-forever warrior scene, but it felt anticlimactic when Ash brought out his mighty staff.
This was the book that I HIGHLY ANTICIPATED and pined for it and yearned for it, and after all that expectations building I WAS EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED.1.
She just wasn't anything special, and kind of random in terms of fated to be for Acheron.
Plus, it's a departure from the vibe of the rest of the series to this point, so it felt kinda disjointed and out of place.Overall, I think it was my built-up expectations that made this a flop for me.
Never build up expectations, I've learned over the years!
It's also the book that turned me off the series FOREVER AFTER!
This book begins just before Acheron's birth and about 1/2 of it is dedicated to his HORRIFIC childhood and young-adult life.
Its not until halfway through that we get to the Ash that we know today in the Dark-Hunter books.
**** Slight Spoiler Below******Acheron does meet his very special someone named Soteria who will be more his savior than anyone else in his life.
We get to see his HEA, and its so much sweeter for all the sadness that he endures for all of his life prior to meeting her.
I cant wait for everyone to read this so that we can all share in Ash's HEA!
I had to grab for the tissues several times as Ash finally fell in love and found somebody to love him after 11,000 years – “I don’t feel broken when you look at me.”  *sniff sniff*.The emotion you feel while reading this book is incredible.
And then to see his amazement that Tory could overlook the horrors of his past, be completely accepting of him and love him for who he is, broke my heart all over again - but in a good way.
the first part of the book (the past) was fairly well-written and definitely interesting- giving depth to acheron's motivations throughout this series.
By the time I got to the second part, i was excited to read what kenyon had set out for acheron's present.
disappointment begins to describe how i felt while reading.
The second part felt like it was written in a rush with little thought put into the characters.
all said, I was definitely disappointed by this book which i had eagerly anticipated for months.
sadly, it seems that kenyon's writing has become a bit stale, especially when compared to the earliest books in this series.
Omg!! This is such an emotional story!! I have waited for his story. He is my favorite character of all time!!
The story of Acheron's life as a human was gut-wrenching, deeply emotional and gripping.
Acheron has to be one of top ten most mesmerizing hero's I've ever read.
Part 2 of the story was very different in emotion and feel then the first part.
I liked Troy and she was so good to Acheron, but yet in all honesty I have to say I pictured someone different for him (more charismatic, vivacious, stronger).
In the end it was all about Acheron and his HEA.I absolutely hated Artemis.
But yet understand the need to build on Acheron's story and how she had such an affect on him.
