fulfilling book riot's 2018 read harder challenge task #3: A classic of genre fiction AND #23: A book with a female protagonist over the age of 60.
i started off strong and organized - jotting down the titles of books i already owned for the individual tasks; birds & stones &etc.*it went well for a few months, i even managed to get ahead at one point, but then it all fell apart because life is the worst and suddenly here i was, four months away from the end of the year and thirteen books behind, realizing i'd have to do the old “double ‘em up” LGM just to get them all done.
Strange as it seems, Miss Marple believes her:“Mrs. McGillicuddy looked at her without comprehension and Miss Marple reaffirmed her judgment of her friend as a woman of excellent principles and no imagination.”I always forget about that brief section in 4:50 from Paddington that feels like the beginning of the dreaded story problem: “if two trains are traveling…”Luckily, Miss Marple soon discards that line of investigation in favor of looking for the body, because no one has been reported missing and no one was found dead on the train.
" Doamna McGillicuddy rămase încruntată și vag nemulțumită.
Oare conductorul avea să raporteze cele relatate de ea?
Sau spusese așa doar ca s-o liniștească?
Erau o mulțime de femei în vârstă care călătoreau prin țară, pe deplin convinse că demascaseră comploturi comuniste, că erau în pericol de a fi omorâte, că au văzut farfurii zburătoare și nave spațiale secrete și raportau crime care nu avuseseră loc niciodată.
Dacă omul o considera drept una dintre ele...
E o idee foarte deșteaptă să spui ferm că nu-ți amintești.
Foarte mulți oameni nu își amintesc ce au făcut și unde au fost acum o săptămână.
Este util îndeosebi dacă nu vrei să atragi atenția asupra felului în care ți-ai petrecut timpul."
Since the figure of the detective is one of the things I consider and value the most in a crime novel, I was disappointed.
•Another thing about detective fiction that makes me fall head over heels every single time is the long explanation that takes place at the end of the story, whodunit style, the so-called dénouement.
In Christie's novels, the dénouement is usually long and unbelievably satisfying -I always enjoy it, even when I didn't like how the investigation was carried out.
In 4:50 from Paddington, the whole thing is explained in two measly pages.
Fittingly, it's the sort of mystery quick-fix you could finish on a train, say London to York...or better yet, London to Paris!In 4.50 from Paddington an old lady witnesses what she believes is a murder on another train traveling alongside hers.
The police have nothing to go on besides her story and they're disinclined to believe her.
Scenes play out, red herrings are dropped about the reader commingled with the real story, and Marple stitches them together or assists with helpful advice from afar before arriving on the scene to deliver the decisive blow in the end.
I believe this is only my second Miss Marple and as I said, it was quite enjoyable.
An excellent Miss Marple, with her at her very best, ably assisted by Lucy Eyelesbarrow. A great story, very original, with a large cast of possible suspects or are they possible victims. Well woven as ever by the Mistress of Crime into a story with a number of red herrings and a wonderful denouement. Certainly worth a read.
Σατανικά απλό....μωρή τρέλα Μάρπλ μας έχεις πάρει το μυαλό ♥
You've just seen a woman killed, you have no idea what the murderer looks like, and you are afraid you one will believe the rambling of a silly old Scottish woman.Well, if you are Mrs. McGillicuddy (which I think we can all agree is an AMAZING name) you confide your fears to your good friend Miss Jane "I have caught so many more murderers than you" Marple.
Like most of her mysteries I had no idea who the killer was and the solution to the murder was elegant and followed logically from all the information the reader has been exposed to.Interestingly there was actually very little Miss Marple in this story.
Mrs Elspeth Gillicuddy is returning from Christmas shopping to visit her friend when a train, going in the opposite direction to the one she is travelling on, stops opposite her carriage and she witnesses a murder.
Nobody believes her story, but, of course, the friend she is visiting is Miss Marple, who is very willing – not only to believe her, but to investigate.
Having deduced the likely place for a body to be left, Miss Marple involves the super efficient Lucy Eyelesbarrow to take work at Rutherford Hall, home to the miserly invalid Mr Crackenthorpe and his his daughter, Emma.
With Miss Marple ensconced in a nearby boarding house, Lucy embarks on her investigation.
When her wagon and the one parallel to hers stop briefly, Mrs. McGillicuddy witnesses a man strangling a woman and her body falling limp to the ground.
But with no body, no suspects and no motive, this will one tough case.Another locomotive murder by Agatha Christie and I thorougly enjoyed it.
Miss Marple figures that the body had to be dumped off the train and deduces the most likely place where it could be hidden.
Miss Eyelesbarrow searches the grounds for the missing body but she finds so much more.
The connection of the murdered woman to Rutherford Manor is not apparent and remains a mystery til the very end.
I can keep on staring out of the windows of a moving train for hours, watching the landscape go by, trying to construct imaginary histories of the people glimpsed.Well, Mrs. McGillicudy saw something much more exciting - and frightening.
Now without a clue, without a location, and without even a body, Miss Marple has to solve the case - but solve it she does!This is one of the strange stories where instead of the conventional Christie whodunit, we have something more in Hitchcock's line.
The sequence of all males in one household proposing to the governess - who is Jane Marple's spy, in fact - was hilarious and could have been something out of Wodehouse.
A quick, fun easy read! I always enjoy Miss Marple and in this story she is at her sleuthing best. This book was originally published in 1957 and yet it still reads so well. In fact reading it is just the same as reading one of today's cozy mysteries set just after the war. And the best thing is I don't think I will ever have read all her books - there are just so many!
رواية جميلة ، بالرغم ان أحداثها شتتني في بعض الأمور، الا انني كنت تكهنت القاتل، وقد كان.
Oh, the mystery!
I don’t know why I haven’t read Miss Christie’s books before.
She knew how to spin a great tale!
From the intriguing characters to the twists and turns, I was hooked all the way through this one.
Yep, I moved it to my to-purchase list, despite the two dozen expletives and a handful of profanities.
The story is one that I’ll read a few more times in my life, I’m sure.
It’s gripping and interesting and one to study if one would like to learn how to write a great mystery.Content: Alcohol and pubs were mentioned.I was not compensated for my honest review.
This Miss Marple Adventure has the perfect amount of mystery and suspense with a fascinating hook that drew me in straight from the start.I got so engrossed that I read the whole novel within a day!Just as two trains are passing parallel to each other, passenger Mrs. Elspeth McGillicuddy witness a women being strangled in the other carriage.
Informing her friend Jane Marple who believes her account sparks an investigation into whodunnit and why.I love how the story starts with two mysteries, as their was no evidence on the other train.
ان ما يجعل أجاثا كريستي اعظم مؤلفة روايات بوليسية انها لا تكرر حبكاتها فلكل رواية حبكة جديدة واعتقد انه نادرا جدا من يستطيع ان يتوقع المجرم في قبل نهاية الروايةاستمتعت جدا بهذه الرواية
جد؟! 😏جد جد؟!!
خيلي موضوع جالبي داشت
She's never shocked and doesn't shy away from the motives that drive men and women to desperation and murder, relying on her bottomless store of knowledge about human nature to suss out the bad guys...This book opens as a friend of Miss Marple, Elspeth McGillicuddy, is on the train home after a busy day of shopping; she just happens to glance sideways at a train running on the parallel track and is treated to the horrific tableau of a man strangling a woman to death...As soon as she tells Jane Marple what she has seen, the two decide it must be reported to the police.
I am so enjoying reading and rereading Miss Marple's adventures in order; I think I saw BBC versions of many of these stories and as good as they were, Christie's tight plotting, excellent characters and dry humor are a real treat!
I've discovered Miss Marple's secret to solving crime!
If someone looks suspicious and/or has a clear motive for the crime, they are almost certainly innocent; the perpetrator is always the slightly vague person on the fringes who doesn't seem to have any connection at all.
If that fellow in the corner appears to be a decent chap who could have no possible reason to want the victim dead, he's almost definitely your man.
And if he's in love with a girl who, if three or four other people get dead, might possibly inherit a fortune, and then--possibly--marry him and share it...
The mystery in this one is simply okay - a little bit more fantastical than other Christie books - but Lucy Eyelesbarrow, competent domestic-for-hire, makes up for that. And Miss Marple is at the absolute top of her game. This book made me laugh out loud more than once: “Listen, darling,” said Lucy. “Are we investigating crime, or are we match-making?” Miss Marple twinkled. Also, as Claire says, the amount of people in this book who think that murder is a perfectly appropriate hobby for two boys

You only see your first murder victim once!And on the subject of Lucy, since I'm not as smart as Miss Marple: (view spoiler)[which man - Cedric or Bryan - does Lucy go for????
I still have no clue who Lucy Eyelesbarrow is supposed to marry... :)
She becomes Miss Marple's "legs" and we see much of the story from her perspective.Highly recommended as light summer reading, especially for those who last read Christie very long ago.--------FINAL THOUGHTS I was really struck at the end of this by Miss Marple's reminiscences of the wicked people she'd seen during her long life in the village.
We like to think that there were no people who might kill their children for profit or even some lesser reason (none of which happens in this book, btw), but the human tendency toward greed is always with us which is how Miss Marple sums up a basic reason to do evil.
Може, тому що відволікалася на складові: проблема сільського будинку, що волею богів урбаністики опинився серед перспективної промзони; кар'єрне зростання багатообіцяючої вченої, яка подалася заробляти гроші у "сфері домашнього затишку" (від лінії Люсі періодично ставало волосся дибки, але я заспокоювала себе: дивись, вона ж ніби задоволена...
Я ще не побігла пекти скони, але вже близька до цього.PS: те, що у видання зовні - нове оформлення тобто - дуже приємне.
Не дуже сподобалися верстка та переклад.
Оцей останній ніби рівний, рівний, ллється, а потім бац - як не дивна синтаксична конструкція а-ля "русизми покусали", так фінський сором через очевидні ляпи накриває.
Dear Agatha, she does it everytime doesn't she?! I just loved this, it's definitely one of the Marple adventures I like best!
Feeling too old and unfit to snoop around herself, Miss Marple asks Lucy Eyelesbarrow to hunt for the body and so Lucy takes a job at Rutherford Hall...This book gets a little criticism for not really having many clues or much actual detection element in it.
She gives us some nice village parallels to shed light on the characters of the suspects; she twinkles affectionately at both young Inspector Craddock and Lucy; she does a bit of gentle match-making; and she gives us some classic Delphic pronouncements that leave the reader as beautifully baffled as the other characters.For me, one of the major joys of Christie's books is that they manage the difficult feat of being full of corpses and yet free of angst – a trick the Golden Age authors excelled in and modern authors seem to have forgotten.
Sitting in the middle of an autumn thunder storm with the heat cranked up and a whodunit by the fantastic Agatha Christie really is the perfect scenario.
Something I've always loved about Agatha Christie, especially concerning Miss Marple is just how wonderfully unique it is.
This book takes us away from Miss Marple's village and to a manor, built on a snack food fortune, filled to the brim with resentment and family complexities.
Lucy is Miss Marple's younger eyes and ears in as she works to help sleuth out a dead body.
Y por supuesto no entendía nada, aunque está todo explicado, y sospechaba de todos, menos de la persona correcta.Me gustó mucho la historia del asesinato, y los personajes fueron bastante útiles (quiero decir que en muchas de sus novelas suele haber un personaje medio estúpido que no se da cuenta de nada, pero en esta si hubo uno importante no lo noté).
No se lleva una puntuación más alta por este problemita, pero lo disfruté muchísimo, como me pasó con la gran mayoría de los que he leído.
Cat. Cream.
On her way to stay with her old friend Jane Marple at St. Mary Mead for a few days before traveling to Ceylon to visit her son, Elspeth McGillicuddy glances out of her train window and sees, through the window of a train on a parallel track, a man strangling a woman.
