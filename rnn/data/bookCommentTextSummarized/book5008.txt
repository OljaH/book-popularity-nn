It’s been a long time since I’ve read any Agatha Christie and it’s easy to let one’s brain flow back into her story telling style.
It also provides an unexpected and emotional denouement.Here’s the kicker for me: I find it very quaint that the British police force let an old lady (their term: old pussy.
Here’s the way it would go down in America: Old lady wanders onto multiple murder scene, annoys American cops, American cops plant crack pipe on old lady, subject her to a strip search and interrogation, drop her 20 miles outside of town, murder, of course, remains unsolved.
Apart from Miss Marple, Inspector Neele and Pat Fortescue (view spoiler)[and look what kind of fate AC dealt her - very sad.
This she does, not with malice or morbidity, but with an irresistible, gentle irony, concentrating on the various reactions of the other people around: a bunch of secretaries and typists at a loss what to do in time of crisis and the professional satisfaction the pathologist takes in the "unusual" method of poisoning.Miss Marple does her usual stuff to satisfaction: knitting baby-things, drawing references to characters of her native village St. Mary Mead & eventually finding the murderer.
As anybody who reads the Miss Marple books knows, she often trains young housemaids, so they can go into service.
When Miss Marple reads that one of the young maids she trained, Gladys Martin, has been found strangled - a clothes peg left on her nose - in the garden of the house where she worked, she sets off at once to see who did such a wicked thing.
Murder had already visited the family, as the head of the household, Mr Rex Fortecue, was poisoned at work and, in his pocket, was a handful of rye…The crimes in this novel are all lined to the nursery rhyme, “Sing a song of sixpence…” and yet it all seems unbelievable to Detective Inspector Neele, who is sent to investigate.

It was one of the many worries that afflicted her in life.She poured out the tea and took the cups round with a couple of limp, sweet biscuits in each saucer.That quote has very little to do with the plot of A Pocket Full of Rye, but it does set the tone of this story.
Sure, there is not blood or gore, but there is darkness, thirst for revenge, and calculating human horribleness.And that's what I see in the mention of tepid tea and limp biscuits.
I can't say that I liked this story a lot, and I can't even put my finger on why this is.
Ποιος σκότωσε το Ρεξ Φόρτεσκιου; Η δεσποινίς Γκρόσβενορ, ιδιαιτέρα γραμματέας του; Η γυναίκα του Αντέλ και ο εραστής της Βίβιαν Ντυμπουά; Η κόρη του Ελάιν; Ο γιος του Πέρσιβαλ ή η γυναίκα του Τζένιφερ; Ο γιος του Λάνσελοτ; (η Παμ, η σύζυγος του Λάνσελοτ, αποκλείεται) Η οικονόμος Μαίρη Νταβ ; Η μαγείρισσα Κραμπ ή ο άντρας ο Μπάτλερ; η υπηρέτρια Γκλάντυς Μάρτιν; ή η υπηρέτρια Έλλεν; Η δεσποινίς Ραμσμπότομ, αδελφή της πρώην (πεθαμένης πια) γυναίκας του;Ο επιθεωρητής Νηλ της Σκώτλαντ Γυαρντ και ο αρχιφύλακας Χαίυ αν δεν είχαν τη βοήθεια της Μις Μαρπλ ακόμα θα έψαχναν...Είχα να το διαβάσω πολλά χρόνια.
The maid was in the garden hanging out the clothes, When there came a litte dickey bird and nipped off her nose."When Rex Fortescue suddenly falls ill after drinking his regular cup of tea at his office and dies shortly after, the police suspect foul play.
As the investigation progresses, Miss Marple inserts herself into the case and soon links the murder to a rhyme.
Inspector Neele is assigned to the case which leads him to Yewtree Lodge, the home of the the Fortecues.
Loved this - brilliantly surprising ending, and one of those ideal Christie solutions where everything turns on its head at the end and all the same facts suddenly look completely different.
I would have given it four stars, except that Miss Marple didn't really (as far as I can see) have enough clues to lead her to the truth.
She seemed to have magicked the truth out of nowhere.
I know she's a genius about human nature, but I'd have liked a couple of more concrete clues to set her on the right path.
Πολύ ωραίο! Προσπαθούσα συνέχεια να μαντέψω ποιος το έκανε, και ομολογώ πως αυτή τη φορά είχε περάσει από το μυαλό μου η λύση, αλλά το ίδιο και πολλά άλλα πιθανά σενάρια, οπότε δεν πειράζει. 4 αστεράκια γιατί ως φαν της τηλεοπτικής σειράς, θα θελα λίγο παραπάνω Μις Μαρπλ (όχι ότι ο Ντετέκτιβ Νηλ πήγαινε πίσω). 😊
Without a doubt this has been one of my favourite books in the Miss Marple challenge. It is not a novel I remembered reading and so it was wonderful to experience for the first time (maybe ?)As with a lot of the novels, Miss M is in it only fleetingly, but each appearance is worth waiting for in terms of insight and revelation, and yes I still see Joan Hickson every time.
Christie starts the book off with us following an Inspector Nettle to figure out who murdered Rex Fortescue and his second wife, Adele.
She and Nettle work well together and even though Nettle is behind Miss Marple in figuring out who is the murderer and the reasons why, it was a fun book to read and try guess who did it and why.
Without giving away the ending, I loved how Miss Marple fixates on the rightful murderer and the reasons why.
But one of the people killed, the young maid Gladys Martin happened to be Miss Marple’s former maid, and the cruel circumstances of her death bring Miss Marple to the Fortescues’ residence Yewtree Lodge, where Inspector Neele, in charge of the case, and a bit out of his depth with it, finds himself relying on her skills before long.
Miss Marple once again relies on her age, and indeed the stereotypes associated with it (gossiping) to obtain an insight into all those involved, and her skills of finding parallels for character in people she has known in St Mary Mead too come to her aid.
Although Miss Marple is always the one who finally finds the truths, too bad she's not herself a real detective. I think I must look for such character in radical science-fiction dystopian feminist novels.
A Pocket Full of Rye contains many of the very best elements of Agatha Christie: vivid and interesting characters, a great set-up, and the clever "gimmick" of three murders all being cleverly tied together by a child's nursery rhyme.
Miss Marple comes to the conclusion that, similarly to what we have read in 'And Then There Were None', they are dealing with a crime by rhyme.First, I really enjoyed the manner in which the plot is unraveled in the book.
However, if you are a Miss Marple fan, I have to disappoint you.

A Pocketful of Rye is yet another murder mystery based on a nursery rhyme, one was one of my favourite ones.
Then comes the death of the 'queen in the parlour eating bread and honey.' And finally, the 'maid in the garden hanging out the clothes'.
Even the blackbird pecking off her nose was implied by a clothes clip on her nose.
This triple murder came to Miss Marple's notice because she had trained the maid and looked out for her.
The book also doesn't anymore have surprises for me because I have read it multiple times.
Now, it's just a comfort read.
I hadn't read a Miss Marple mystery in quite a long time.
I partly worked it out by paying careful attention, but as usual Agatha Christie succeeded in befuddling me in some aspects!What I love about Miss Marple is the way she compares character traits to someone she knows/ knew personally.
She's pink and cute and fluffy and my favourite Christie sleuth!However in this case, Miss Marple makes her appearance about 40% into the book and is not a constant presence through the remaining pages, so I found it hard to believe when she reveals the name of the murderer in the end.
That apart, it is a quick read and an interesting murder mystery which I would recommend to all Christie fans.
"There are coincidences.... But they shouldn't happen too often"I've had multiple reads of this. And I have seen the films. Unfortunately, some of the films don't adhere that closely to the book. And then they can become confused in your mind. So I re-listened to a chapter or two, knowing that I had dozed off, and not knowing whether I missed something or the item I am remembering is from a movie and not from the book.It wasn't in the book. This is a multiple read for me. But always enjoyable.
Just what. I thought I had it all figured out. And I did, to some extent. But I definitely did NOT get the murder right. The one character I liked in this book (besides Miss Marple and Inspector Neele, obviously) did it??!?!?! I WAS SO WRONG. I DIDN'T BELIEVE THE WORST IN PEOPLE, WHICH I SHOULD OBVIOUSLY DO. Miss Marple says it herself. EVERYBODY is a suspect in these books. EVERY. BODY. GOT THAT??? Even that inconspicuous museum guard. He probably did it. Don't think "Oh the guard never does it" BECAUSE HE DOES IT IN THIS BOOK OK (Metaphorically)
Another enjoyable reread. I remembered who the murderer was when (view spoiler)[Gladys (hide spoiler)] was killed. However, I did not remember the entire plot or the reason for the murder. It is a good thing that Miss Marple was nosy and went to the scene of the crimes. I'm not sure the detective would have figured it out without her.
3.5* for this audiobook edition Miss Marple plays a smaller role in this book than she did in the Joan Hickson dramatization, which I found disappointing. However, Richard Grant does an excellent narration.
Not the best Miss Marple I have read.
Lucky for Neele, the sad, silly housemaid Gladys once worked for Miss Marple, who has seen the sensational news stories about the triple murder and feels compelled to come see what she can do to help.That's why I love her so - she is truly nemesis personified.
Agatha Christie loved to use nursery rhymes as a motif in her mystery novels for added creepiness.
I always love dear Miss Marple, and really enjoyed the idea of bringing her former maid Gladys in and giving her a starring role.
(I feel as though I've encountered Gladys before but can't think where.) I also really liked the character of Mary Dove, who struck me a foil for Lucy Eyelesbarrow from 4:50 From Paddington.
I wish the two had met in the course of their profession!Overall, this is not among my favorite Miss Marple mysteries--that award goes to The Body in the Library, A Murder is Announced, and Nemesis.

Πολύ μυστήριο, φόνοι απροσδόκητοι και δύσκολο να καταλάβω το σκοπό τους… με κράτησε σε αγωνία και σε περιέργεια μέχρι και την τελευταία σελίδα. Στο μυαλό μου γύριζαν ένα σωρό ύποπτοι που θα είχαν λόγους να διαπράξουν όλους αυτούς τους φόνους, αλλά έπεσα έξω σε όλους.Το μικρό μειονέκτημα μόνο… ότι η μις Μαρπλ δεν παρουσιάστηκε αρκετά μέσα στο έργο, αν και η λιγοστή παρουσία της στάθηκε ικανή για να δώσει πολλή τροφή για σκέψη στον επιθεωρητή Νηλ.Περισσότερα εδώ...
Agatha Christie liked using nursery rhymes as a unifying theme, and A Pocket Full of Rye, the only Miss Marple book to use this method, does this more strongly than in any other book. For those who do not remember both verses of the nursery rhyme “Sing a Song of Sixpence,” let me include them here:Read the rest of this review, more reviews, and other wonderful, geeky articles on FangirlNation
The way I see it, is that if the journey is good, and if there are startling revelations, and if I can put a face to a well depicted character, then the said book would have fulfilled its purpose of providing me with a roller coaster ride.
First time ever, has Miss Marple been described as tall.
She deliberately planted the word tall throughout her book.
Too much going on, I would have liked Mary Dove to remain impassive to the end.
Perhaps the author, having pitted Neele's wits against Mary's impassiveness, just had to make the Inspector put one over Mary Dove.Despite these middling things, I had great fun reading this mystery.
A Pocket Full of Rye (Miss Marple, #7), original publication year 1953Characters: Miss Jane Marple, Rex Fortescue, Percival Fortescue, Lancelot Fortescue, Adele Fortescue, Pat Fortescue, Elaine Fortescue, Jennifer Fortescue, Mary Dove, Inspector Neele, Gladys Martin, Vivian Dubois, Ellen Curtis, Miss Ramsbottom, Irene Grosvenor, Gerald Wright, Crump, Sergeant Hay.Abstract: A handful of grain is found in the pocket of a murdered businessman!
