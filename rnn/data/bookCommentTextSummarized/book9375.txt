Nahfouz has placed people within families and families within their own parts of society in Cairo during three distinct times during the first half of the 20th century.
This proved to be a wise choice as the first book, Palace Walk, sets the stage for the other two by introducing the major players, setting the stage for the unrest in Egypt and in Cairo itself, under the power of British rule early in the 20th century.
The contrast between religious and less observant Muslims becomes obvious and begins to set both family and societal stories in motion.
The past is never really gone and this trilogy shows the truth of this maxim for Cairo...
If you've ever sniffed a nineteenth century family saga, particularly one that stretched into the twentieth century flavoured by the author's progress from boy to writer then you know, emotionally, what to expect, overbearing hypocritical patriarch, meek housebound wife, youngest son en-route via teaching to become an author, add mid novel stone throwing and protests at occupying British, stir occasionally on a low heat...
Part of this relationship is observed by his youngest son, if I remember correctly.
His wife and children use different strategies to wriggle out from beneath the iron fist of their husband and father, not all of them in good ways.
They find their own ways to cope with the political, cultural and religious upheaval.
Some of the things that impressed me however, were the following.Even though some people rebel against their religion and culture, they cannot get away from them entirely because they are so steeped in them.
Even so, Mahfouz still manages to make us feel some sympathy for these people.
من أحب الأعمال لقلبي 💜
Simmering beneath is the growing political discontent and a national desire to cast off the yoke of British domination, just waiting to disrupt their lives and change their family irrevocably.Mahfouz has the gift of creating memorable characters.
She, too, has an inner strength and a selfless trait.Fahmy, his middle son, is intellectual and perhaps the most alienated in the family.Aisha, his younger daughter, is pretty and coquettish.Kamal, his youngest son, is striking in his innocence and naivety.The introduction to the culture of the time is fascinating.
سوف أبدأ أولا بعم نجيب محفوظ وعبقريته الفذة في كتابة هذه الرواية،كيف تمخض فكره و موهبته عن كتابة هذه
دعنا نتفق أنّ كتابة مراجعة سريعة لهذه الرّواية محض ظلم ، فهي بحاجة لعشرات الصّفحات حتّى تغطّي بعض النّقاط الرّئيسة فيها !
في ظنِّي هاجس الثّلاثيّة الأكبر تمثّل في محاولة الفكاك من السّلطة بكافّة أشكالها؛ الأبويّة ( المجتمعيّة ) والدّينيّة والسّياسيّة لكن فعليًّا الحرية مفهوم معقّد فرديًا ومجتمعيًا .
حاولتْ بعض الشّخوص بخطوات عاثرة أن تفهم وتتعلّم لتتجاوز همزة القطع إلى نظرية في الحرية ، منها شخصيّة كمال ( التي أحببتها جدًّا ) فقد تمثِّل الفلسفة باعتبارها خطابًا ملحًا لإعادة النّظر في كلّ شيء في كلّ شيء!
بين القصرين مركز ثقل الرّواية لكن حتّى لو أنّ الجزأين التاليين تابعان إِلا أنّ فيهما يتمركز الرّهان الجمالي للرّواية .
The children of both these couples are in their infancy as this novel proceeds, but the most compelling figure in volume 2 is Kamal, the youngest sibling of al-Sayyid Ahmad and Amina.
The arrests of both Abd al Muni'm and Ahmad bring this monumental work to a close.In its totality, Mahfouz uses the three novels of The Cairo Trilogy to chart Egypt's tumultuous history through the meditations of various family members with distinctively different perceptions on life.
ثلاثيه نوبل الرائعه ما اروعك يا اديبنا العظيم والانيق والمبدع فخر الادب العربي خلاصه ابداع وجهد ثبلاثين عاما لحال الحاره المصريه بكل احوالها وتناقضاتها
The first book in the trilogy, Palace Walk, set in the period during and immediately following World War I, introduces us to the family of el-Sayyed Ahmed Abd Gawad, a successful merchant; his wife, Amina; their two daughters, and three sons.
Yet, due to the skill with which Mahfouz drew his setting, I vicariously live her life and respect her attitude, even if I only partially understand it.Palace of Desire, the second book of the trilogy, takes place mostly in the 1920s and shows the effect of modern influences and political turmoil on the various family members.
In the translation published by the Everyman Library the Cairo Trilogy is funny, biting and tragic with precise descriptions and deeply thought out characters.
I have heard that he exaggerates the traits of Egyptians, that he is the greatest Arabic novelist of all time and that he is boring.
I can’t really speak to whether or not he exaggerates the traits of Egyptians, I imagine he does, but I do think he is one of the best novelists I have read in a long long time.
Wow. Over the half of a year that I've read these three books this family has become part of me, through their humanity and their flaws.
As I’ve been learning more about the Arab world recently, reading Mahfouz is a very pleasant way of tying together some of the details I’m learning, within a fictional framework.The Everyman’s Library all-in-one edition of The Cairo Trilogy is a beautiful book.
But also like other of my favorite novelists, Mahfouz is gifted in drawing out the distinctive characteristics of each person, so that within a very short time I feel like I’ve known and lived with these characters forever.What I love about this novel is how it reflects aspects of my own life and character—usually painfully!
Palace Walk (a reread in preparation of reading the rest of the trilogy)A quiet, yet gripping story of change, culture and tradition.
The story of the Abd al-Jawad family mirrors the changes in the country.
4-starsPalace of DesireThe story of the Abd al-Jawad family continues, as does Egypt's rise to independence.
This book, as entertainment, lags a bit behind Palace Walk because of the lamenting of lost love and the talk of politics.
An interesting quote relating to the changing times:"Do you think you can rule the young people of today in the old-fashioned way?
The story of a traditional Egyptian family in Cairo against the political and social upheavals of the late teens, 20s and 30s.
To pick a few: It's a view of a culture so different from mine as to seem another planet, yet I can relate to every character.
Just seeing into a traditional Muslim household is fascinating: the women virtually never leave the house; the respected, feared, and loved paterfamilias rules, and keeps his romantic relationships completely separate from the life of the family.
Most amazingly, almost miraculously, every character is sympathetic.
My dad really loved this book, but I'm kind of lukewarm on it, which makes me sad.
I really have a strong distaste for parts of the current arabic culture, which alternately villifies and sanctifies women, with nothing in between.
Yes, this book does kind of deal with that, but I found that the very way the author writes was equally sexist.
The women in this book were almost always cartoonish, described by their attractiveness, or their virtue, or perhaps their lack thereof, with little effort made to get into what actually made them tick.
I'd love to give this less stars, but I can't. I absolutely hated the father of the family, I think I never hated a character in a book that much. At some point I even threw the book against a wall, which just isn't me. However, that's a sign that the story has completely caught you, and that the book is great.

From Powell's website: "A student of philosophy and an avid reader, [Mahfouz] has been influenced by many Western writers, including Flaubert, Balzac, Zola, Camus, Tolstoy, Dostoevsky, and, above all, Proust." (!)

The discrepancy between the tyrannical father and husband and the bon vivant (tambourinist, generous friend, inebriated debaucher) are an alternate plot, which is eventually noticed by his son Yasin most like him in behavior.
The children grow into adults, and Amina the wife is no longer secluded at home.
The scenario of family life changes as the father cannot deny independence of choice to his adult sons.
Book II Palace of Desire:The second installment of the trilogy continues the changing mores of the al-Jawad family, as some of the children are near adults, educated, and married.
The characters of father and the eldest sons Yasin and Kamal particularly cover the second volume.

For those who track these things: The major themes are adult but a parent can be proud of such of their children attempt these 1300 pages and not concerned that they might read bad words.Published in the years 1956 and 1957, The Cairo Trilogy takes us into the household of Al-Sayyid Ahmad 'Abd al-Jawad.
If we are to focus on the universal, than is the context of observant Muslim a matter of making reader view their own lives from a different point of view?The Cairo Trilogy is a master work.
The Cairo Trilogy is not just a lot of reading it is a lot of book.
كم يشعرك الأدب بنشوة الثراء لأنك شعرت بهؤلاء الذين يعيشون في أذهان الأدباء...
كم يشعرك الأدب بحرمان الفقد أيضا...
قل لي تسعد أم تحزن...لست كمال المرتحل في مراكب الفلاسفة غرب المتوسط من سقراط لبرجسون...
لست كمال العاشق الغريب المستوعب لثقافة القرن العشرين الذي أدرك سعد زغلول وانتظر مقالات المنفلوطي والرافعي والعقاد وقصائد حافظ وشوقي والشابي وجبران وخواطر مي زيادة وشاهد مسرح رمسيس...ولست ياسين الذي يتخذ من فلسفة بشار أسلوب حياة...
وتسعد نفسه بالغوص في لذات الشبق...لست السيد احمد عبد الجواد التاجر الفاهم سوق الحياة...نعيش معهم...
وهم يبحثون عن معنى الرحلة بين القصرين.مساكين نحن...
The first novel, Palace Walk, introduces the family of Ahmad Abd al-Jawad: his wife Amina, sons Yasin, Fahmy and Kamal, and daughters Khadija and Aisha.
Desire permeates this story even as the world of Ahmad, the father, slowly begins to lose the control that seemed to be his main characteristic as the trilogy began.The novel Sugar Street ends Naguib Mahfouz's masterpiece bringing the story of Al-Sayyid Ahmad's family to a close.
There is a hopeful sign as Yasin goes out with Kamal to buy clothes for the new baby.Mahfouz's trilogy has epic sweep in its depiction of the changes to Cairo over the first half of the twentieth century mirrored in the growth and change of the Ahmad family.
I call it soap because my american view point see's it that way, and yet the story he tells is not so far fetched as that some of my own neighbors are living out very similiar dramas.I am not finished with this Magnus Opus of Mafouz's but Here are a collection of thoughts so far (stars are pending on the ending of the book)1.
الجزء الأول "بين القصرين": هي الرحلة الأولى ، بداية الحكاية التي لانهاية لها ، رجل لا حد لسطوته و تناقضاته و غرائبية طباعه و إمرأة خاضعة خانعة لا تكل الخضوع لزوجها فهذا هو ما طبعت و تربت عليه ، لقد أراد محفوظ أن تكون بين القصرين هي مرآة الحياة و الأخلاق البرجوازيين في أوج عنفوانهم و حياة المرأة في قلب تلك الأخلاق من حيث هي موضوع للذة و متعة و تسلية تارة و موضوع للحشمة و الشرف والفضيلة تارة أخرى.فكان أحمد عبد الجواد و عائلته أمينة و فهمي و ياسين و كمال و خديجة وعائشة ، أما ياسين فهو الأبن الأكبر و الأقرب و الأكثر شبها لوالده في نهمه و بهيميته اللامحدودة بحد ، فكما إشتهى زنوبة العوادة إشتهى أم حنفي الخادمة و مثلما إشتاق للزواج و هام بأيامه الأوائل اشتاق في حيوانية منقطعة النظير لخادمة زوجته !
My book club read Naguib Mahfouz's works for a whole year -- in fact,the year before 9/11. I am grateful to Mahfouz for introducing me through to literature into Arab and Muslim culture. The Palace Trilogy are the three most important books I've read in the past ten years. It sounds corny, but I could barely put them down.
