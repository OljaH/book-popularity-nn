Re-read: 11/22/18***Updated for book 17***This is the kick starter for one of my FAVORITE UF/PNR series of all time.
In this book, you are introduced to some changelings (shifters) and what I think is a truly brilliant and utterly original people (at least I had never read about anything like it before): The Psy race and the thing they call "Silence."Will it blow your PNR mind?Not only that, but in this book, we are introduced to one of my favorite book husbands of all time:Lucas Hunter.
While this book doesn't focus on any particular couple, it's a must-read for the series.
We'll have nice fresh veggies by the time the baby comes!"Mr Kennedy now has a Pavlovian upchuck reflex to any sentence that ends in, "...by the time the baby comes!" There is a certain manic way pregnant women say that, which instantly informs the rest of the world that reason and logic no longer hold any value.I then began furiously churning up the soil with one of those pick-axe-like things that you use to do this kind of work.
I honestly don't know what to say about this book that hasn't already been said numerous times other than it's easily become my FAVORITE paranormal romance thus far.
I won't go into detail about the plot, the characters, or the writing; there are plenty of fantastic reviews already written that fully express my feelings, thoughts, and sentiments about this fantastic book (series).
Now I understand why so many of my friends consider the Psy-Changeling series one of their favorite paranormal reads.
If the rest of the books are anything like this one, there's no doubt this series will become my favorite in the paranormal genre.
4 Feels for the first time stars Slave to Sensation is my first book by Nalini Singh and I really enjoyed it. I know I have had this baby on my kindle for a few years now and I sit here and wonder why I waited so long to start this series. I loved the whole world set up. The Psy being all mind with great psychic powers, and no feelings , the Changelings being shifters that feel greatly, and of course the boring humans. I do wish there would have been a bit more paranormal world development as I
I know I have had this baby on my kindle for a few years now and I sit here and wonder why I waited so long to start this series.
I do wish there would have been a bit more paranormal world development as I would have liked to known things like.....
how long do the para live, how do they know when they found their mates?
I loved Lucas and Sascha together.
Although I did wish Lucas would have figured out she was his mate a little bit sooner.
Slave to Sensation was a great start to the series.
I can't wait to start book two!

This book goes to one of the best pnr's I've ever read. The writing is phenomenal, so great that I knew just with the first book that I'll be reading all the others :)I first heard of this series a few months ago, and my reaction was like this: O.o Psychic people devoid of emotions and shape-shifters as couples   . I decided I definitely wasn't going to read something like that.I was VERY, very, very, very stupid.    The story very much remindes me of the movie "Equilibrium", in which the hero l
The writing is phenomenal, so great that I knew just with the first book that I'll be reading all the others :)I first heard of this series a few months ago, and my reaction was like this: O.o Psychic people devoid of emotions and shape-shifters as couples 
)Here the heroine is part of the Psy society, they are genetically modified humans with some amazing psychic abilities, but no notion of emotion.
I love the style of writing, the world the author created has me in it's grip and I don't think it will let go untill I reach the final book.BTW, Hawk was in this one, the alpha of the wolf pack, I sooo want to read him
So... I've heard a lot of good things about this series and since I'm already a big fan of this author's Guild Hunter series, I knew there would come a time to read this series. BUT FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, WHY DID NOBODY TELL ME IT WAS THIS FREAKING GOOD SOONER!!! It's what I've been waiting my whole life for! And now I've finally found it! Thank you, Nalini! THANK YOU!!!Annnnd on to the next book it is!!!
Sascha Duncan (Psy) and Lucas Hunter (Changeling) This was about murder… and the greatest lie that had ever been perpetuated by a race upon its own kind. This book is an impressive start to a series that I have a feeling that it will become one of my favourite PNR series.Psy-world is an interesting different new world. I haven't read anything similar before to be honest. The Psy have great psychic powers, but not feelings or desires.They basically live in two worlds: 1. The real world which also
Sascha Duncan (Psy) and Lucas Hunter (Changeling)
This book is an impressive start to a series that I have a feeling that it will become one of my favourite PNR series.Psy-world is an interesting different new world.
It is actually a place where Psy “meet” and “socialize”.Shifters are the normal shifters that we meet in most PNR books.
He will meet Psy Sascha Duncan , while he tries to find the Psy killer who keeps butchering Changeling females.
I wad satisfied with everything else.------------------------------------------(view spoiler)[2010: I think I will start this series.
And maybe a couple of books I started last December.2017: Why haven't I started this series yet?
I'm not usually a fan of romance and I'm pretty new to PNR so I didn't really know what to expect from this book.
There are so many possibilities here that I can't see how this series could ever get boring *crosses fingers* If I wasn't feeling so lazy I'd give more details about the world but I am so if you want to know more about just go read the book:p Trust me when I say that this is good.
Me tenía atrapada el universo que creó la autora, con estas razas que conviven con los humanos y me gustó como las introdujo, ya que a las pocas páginas era muy fácil entender las características e intereses de cada uno, y cómo lo anterior se transformaba en juegos de poder.
También me tenía muy interesada y expectante la relación que comenzaba a desarrollarse con la pareja que protagoniza la historia.Peeero, avanzando un poco más, la narración se vuelve bastante repetitiva: me quedó muy claro que Sascha tenía que rearmar sus protecciones mentales a cada rato y que Lucas le debía lealtad al clan (estas ideas se repiten por lo menos dos veces por página).
Friendships might be broken, chocolate could be withheld, fisticuffs might ensue.
So instead I’ll say this:If you think that Luke is “yours”, you have another thing coming.
Also, your level of crazy far exceeds mine if you have a thing for Enrique.
If your name is FREEBIRD, you may have to choose weapons and seconds to claim your right to Hawke from the above mentioned Grecian.
If your name is Sarah, you were right.
If your name is Beth, you should finish this damn book.If your name is Ellis, you’re going to love this.
If your name is Angela, I loved this book.
It is populated by Psy and Changelings, and human races, all different in their ways of life, mores and codes, things they hold dear.
If a Psy is detected to "feel", they are either "rehabilitated" for life, or killed...
It gets even worse when women from the packs of Changelings began being found dead, obviously killed by Psy, but a murderous Psy should not exist...
A Changeling (shifter) and a Psy find out about each-other and their different worlds.
But even more than a love story, this is about the human attributes we put value to and what devoting to one extreme or another can do to our way of life.
What took me so long to read this?!?!
The merging of the unfeeling, emotionless citizens of the Psy community, and the touchy feely, possessive Changeling pack members, made for a very sensual, fascinating, and extremely gratifying read.
Amazing world building, memorable characters...that got under my skin, terrific dialogue, and a detailed, yet interesting storyline, make this book a stand-out!
They pointed me in the direction of this series, and have been encouraging me to read it!
I took the plunge girls…I’m totally immersed in the Psy-Changeling world!
I can’t wait to get my hands on the next book!
4 -5 stars – Paranormal RomanceSince I’m a little late jumping on the Psy-Changeling series fan bandwagon, there probably isn’t much to add that hasn’t already been said about this fantastic series. Slave to Sensation is a fabulous debut that sets the foundation for the war between the emotionless, cold, psychically powerful Psy race and the Changelings in the year 2079.In a world where the Psy have enforced a mandatory code of Silence that denies and prohibits all emotion, Psy member Sascha Dun
Slave to Sensation is a fabulous debut that sets the foundation for the war between the emotionless, cold, psychically powerful Psy race and the Changelings in the year 2079.In a world where the Psy have enforced a mandatory code of Silence that denies and prohibits all emotion, Psy member Sascha Duncan has had to conceal her “flawed” makeup out of fear of discovery and forced ‘rehabilitation’.
It’s a great first book in a unique, erotic paranormal series about the cold Psy race ruled by the gifts of the mind and the Changeling race whose strength comes from the heart.

*grins*While Nalini Singh seduced me, with this first taste, to crave more of the books in this series, this poem was my attempt to capture how the sexy, tactile and sensually primal Changeling, Lucas Hunter, a panther who is the Alpha of the DarkRiver leopard pack, managed to overwhelm Sascha Duncan, of the cold Psy race, with sensation – something “unnatural” to the Psy, who do not touch.
And Lucas has some kind of feelings for Sascha that he doesn't understand because they all hate the Psy. As I have said, Sascha isn't like the others, she's "broken" and I hate they think of themselves that way when they are actually normal.
I felt really sorry for Sascha because she was having so much fun being away from the Psy. She didn't know what it was like to touch someone.
It would suck to be a Psy and have actual feeling like Sascha and be scared to death at all times that they will find out and kill you!
In fact, I was fully convinced before I started that I would probably give this book a 4 star rating, it just shows that I should stop making predictions - I'm usually wrong.
Particularly paranormal romance novels, it seems as if they all contain a relationship where the man completely controls the woman and her lifestyle.
Please say it's not just me who thinks these kind of relationships are stomach-turning?I get the alpha-male attraction.
The point is that Lucas (mr hero guy) started off as sexy-in-a-suit, he identified Sascha as a powerful woman from a powerful and dangerous race that should not be taken lightly.
I love how Singh created this future world where there are three types of people: Psy (completely cerebral with enhanced psychic abilities, reject emotions), Changeling (part human/part animal, embrace emotion), and Humans.
In Singh's Psy/Changeling world, race is not an issue.
I am a big fan of shapeshifter stories, and I loved the descriptions of the pack of big cats of which Lucas is the alpha.
If you are like me and typically get a little bored with hard science fiction, but want to expand your horizons, I would suggest this book and the Psy/Changeling series.
I wasn't really impressed, but I just finished the Guild Hunter series (LOVED it), so I decided to give Singh's other series another shot.I'm glad I did.I might have been in a reading slump the last time I read Slave to Sensation, or maybe I just couldn't get past the cheesy (and let's be real--it is cheesy) title and book cover.
But Psys, unlike Vulcans who as a race eventually "evolved" past emotional reactions, are born with emotions and are brainwashed out of feeling them.
Even the smell of a Psy stinks to a Changling nose.Until Lucas meets Sascha.
Now, go read it." That Jose is so freaking smart.and a cheerful mofo too!Anyhoo, the world-building in this book is fun.
She needs to keep her feels to herself or the other Psy's will kill her.
No broken Psy's allowed.But, our broken Psy girl meets a Changeling guy and all the feels break loose.
Obviously there is a murderer loose that only our broken Psy girl can find.Oh yeah, and this is all set in the future, so hovercars!!
They'll probably come out the year after I'm dead, so I'm all about the hovercars in books.
⋰⋱⋰⋱⋰⋱*Still liked it*⋰⋱⋰⋱⋰⋱  Re-read: 29.10.2018 I got curious as to why I had liked this book the first time reading as I couldn't remember a thing about it or why I stopped. The book center around ‘flawed’ Psy Sascha Duncan (26) and alpha changeling; a black panther (or a leopard?), Lucas Hunter (33). Lucas is hunting a Psy killer, and he plans to use Sascha do get an 'in', however, Sascha is not what it seems. Sascha is broken, her mind-shields are crumbling and she has little time left, ho

First read review:Simply put: I adored Sascha Duncan and I kinda loved Lucas Hunter, and together they were awesome.
- Lucas Hunter.Would I read more by this author/or of series?
Ms. Singh feeds enough to keep us sated but keeps us curious about the world that we have entered and that we want to continue reading without food, drink and going for a pee.
Sascha is a fantastic main character, she is strong, sassy but still has a certain vulnerability about her that you just can’t help but not like.
Lucas Hunter a changeling and an alpha to the DarkRiver pack, he is the youngest alpha, strong possessive and I loved all of his character.
The Psy and the Changeling are entering a business deal and Sascha is going to be Lucas associate.
This world she’s created is exciting, passionate, poignant… it’s like none I’ve ever read before.Description…Dive into a world torn apart by a powerful race with phenomenal powers of the mind—and none of the heart…In a world that denies emotions, where the ruling Psy punish any sign of desire, Sascha Duncan must conceal the feelings that brand her as flawed.
Caught between their conflicting worlds, Lucas and Sascha must remain bound to their identities—or sacrifice everything for a taste of darkest temptation…My review…I’ll start by saying that I’ve had this book sitting on my shelf for years, but never felt the pull to read it.
You can read her review here.*What I expected: 1.
Lust at first sight leading to lots of sexy times that magically develop into love overnight.2.
A nice but entirely forgettable heroine.5.
Yippee.To sum it up, I loved the beginning of the story and it only got better and better.
I have around ten more books to go before getting to know Hawke properly, but Brenna's story isn't too far off and I can't wait to read it.
But before that, I plan on reading Tammy and Nate's novella, An Enchanted Season, because I loved these two much more than Lucas and Sascha.
Ok, trash trash trash. And this cover is utterly awful, someone get the Barbie Hookah out of there, the pink smoke kills me! But actually, I really enjoyed this book. This is WAY more romance oriented than I usually read, but I was interested in the characters, the world was interesting with the Psy aspect, sci-fi angle something new (Vulcanish perhaps). Whatever, I read it in one sitting, satistfyingly indulgent! I might read another in the series. Maybe.
For me, it was a lot to take in the first time I read it so I couldn't' appreciate Lucas and Sascha's relationship as I did this time.What a complex book, I just didn't remember so many things happen in it.
They are the most powerful PSYs and they have complete power to rule as they feel like doing, so what is it to stop them from doing the wrong thing?
As if getting to know this amazing and complex species wasn't enough, we get to read about the CHANGELINGS, beings who are not completely human but are half animal.
5 Wild StarsThis is gonna be short because I have the whole series to re-read to get to the last one.Why I love this book1) Lucas is HOT!
I can't even imagine how hard it must be growing up with secrets that will get you killed when you know that your mind is intimatelly connected to those you're keeping your secrets from.3) The packs.
The packs are full of interesting people.
I can't wait to re-read their books!!That's all for now.
"I wish you'd love me.""Why?""Because then maybe you could protect me, too" Haunting sorrow whispered through her tone.”
This happens to this world seventy years or so before the start of Slave to Sensation and some of the prologues that Singh writes throughout the series describing the process and progression of Silence are some of the most chilling scenes and scenarios that I have read.The heroine of Slave to Sensation is a powerful Psy named Sasha Duncan, but she is struggling at the start of the book.
Sasha would know, because her own mother is part of that Council.The hero of the book is Lucas Hunter, the alpha of a leopard Changeling pack near San Francisco.
I think Nalini should have included these short stories at the end of Slave to Sensation, as a part of the epilogue or something, because I found the ending of the book a bit too abrupt and I was a little disappointed.
I really liked that, so, I've decided to give this book 5 emotional stars.I am not going to detail the story or anything because, I think I'm the only person on goodreads who hasn't read the Psy-Changeling series.
I really did, I want more.Lucas was a great character, completely at ease about who he is, proud of his pack and of his race.
This is a series that seems to be a favorite of many of my goodreads (and real life) friends but I’m afraid it didn’t quite live up to the amazing read I had built up in my head.
I’m just going to jump in with my random thoughts, issues and complaints.The narrator did a decent enough job, I think she got Sascha’s monotone down pat but I have to admit the entire reading was a wee bit too emotion-less and sleepy inducing.
I never felt moved by any emotion (maybe I’m just dead inside!).
