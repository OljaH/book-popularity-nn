Trolls, dragons, kingdoms, magical treasures, Harry Potter, ice cream, cookies, beer, cinnamon buns, cloud animals, Star Wars, and more.....The fairytales add to the enjoyment and depths of issues of the heart!
The issues at heart are family bonds, Family history, reflections of the past, life lessons, love, forgiveness, acceptance, laughter.
While reading this AMAZING GEM of a story...I often reflected back on my grandma Cookie!
she, too, felt as though she knew her great- grandmother through stories I shared with her.
The first person I can't wait to share this book with is my oldest daughter.
This one didn't work for me.
Too much story telling within the story.
I found myself getting irritated with all of the names of the places in the Land of Almost Asleep.
I appreciated the viewpoint of our precocious little protagonist at times, but most often found it frustrating.
All of this sleeping in wardrobes and popping out to visit faraway lands left me thinking along the lines of 'The Lion, Witch and Wardrobe.' I guess I was hoping for another sweet read having just come off 'Ove', but this was not to be.
There are more books to read!
4+ StarsAt the heart of the story is a seven year old girl without friends, an outsider in her school who is loved deeply by her cantankerous , seventy-seven year old grandmother.
I have to admit at times , I was not into the fairytale but once I got what the stories were really about , I saw it in a different light .The precocious Elsa is definitely beyond her years but it was hard at times to believe that a 7 year old would be as wise and knowing about people as she was .
I love this authors books! And there was some Britt-Marie!! I know I spelled that wrong. I listened to the audio from the library instead of reading my books as I'm trying to beat the clock. Hopefully I will come back around to all the books I'm reading at this time and do them justice!!Absolutely loved it! Happy Reading!! Mel 🖤🐾🐺
In the end, I couldn't bring myself to leave the star rating blank, but I am not sure you can trust my experience to match the experience you might have.I have loved the other Backman books I have read: A Man Called Ove and Beartown.
While Ove is a fairly straightforward story, this one ventured back and forth from reality to make believe that I found a little bit hard to stay interested in.I mention make believe, and at times this book ventures into the realm of magical realism.
If you liked other Backman books, don't go in expecting the same.
Children's characters, such as Pippi Longstocking, and Sophie of  Sophie's World by Jostein Gaarder , comes to mind, reading this book. Seven-year-old Elsa was a good combination of the two. Wild, naive, and philosophical. Precocious, brattish and different. Elsa knew very well what grown-ups meant when they described her as  'very grown-up for her age'. What they actually meant was 'she is massively annoying for her age', which they directed at her parents with strained smiles spread all over t
A retired, 77-year-old doctor, who triggered the smoke-alarms at the airports with her smoking in the ladie's room with an open door; was asked to retire after refusing to stop smoking in the operating theater; spilled Fanta on Elsa's iPhone and tried to dry it out in the toaster; climb fences at the zoo in the middle of the night; threw policemen with turds; traveled all over the world to save lives when everyone else was rushing to get out and away from dire war situations.Creating fairy tale-metaphors for little Elsa, was her grandmother's way of teaching the hard realities of life in story form to the little girl without friends.
Ok, after a good night sleep, I can tell how I feel about this book. I don't think I've ever read a book that had me feeling so many emotions AT ONE TIME. There were times I was LMAO with tears rolling down my face. Once, towards the end, I was sobbing so hard, I was afraid my husband would hear me in the next room. AWESOME AWESOME AWESOME book!!!!
It was suggested to me several times that I should go back and read this book because Brit-Marie is a secondary character here and this book is a segue into BMWH.
There are plenty poignant and emotional moments expertly woven into this humorous and whimsical story which features a precocious seven -year old girl named Elsa.
For Elsa that is her seventy-seven year old grandmother who regales her with stories that become like a secret communication between them.
Elsa’s love of Wikipedia is hilarious at times, but it’s her fondness for Harry Potter books that was so telling.
This has been on my shelf since 2017.
It's about time I read it.
There is a strong vibe of C.S. Lewis and his Wardrobe.
There are ideas copied from Roald Dahl likewise.
I still think the book is very polished.Elsa is 7 years old and her only friend is her grandmother.
What happens to them and why the title is so?
But then there have been instances where I couldn't put the book down.
In the end the author tries to distance himself from Dahl and Lewis, and succeeds in that too.
Her mother is her punch-bag over teen issues (if Elsa can be called a teen that is) and her Dad is her word collector who can stand everything except a grammatically incorrect sentence.
Its strange how close love and fear live to each other.
It appears as if Backman leaned on many a poles and watched people battle their demons in routine life - just how some transformed into the fiercest warriors under chaotic spells but were sorely defeated by the toothless, simple, predictable plateau of life.
We want to be loved; failing that, admired; failing that, feared; failing that, hated and despised.
Sure, I liked Elsa well enough, 7 going on 8, and Granny was pretty amazing, but the constant reverting to fairytale land made this such a disappointment for me, I was ready to ditch it several times.
Little Elsa, 7 going on 8, was more like 7 going on 17.
Much too smart and worldly for 7 going on 8, no matter how much she used Wikipedia.There were many little similarities with Ove's story, but copying from a previous success does not another success make.
But then looking at everyone else's ratings, there's something definitely wrong with me and most likely my hearing.2.5 stars
I seem to have ageist issues with this author's books. In A Man Called Ove the main character was in his fifties and acted like a man of 85. In this book the main character is seven and acts as if she is 17. However if I ignore that I did enjoy the story and found it to be a light, entertaining read, not quite as interesting as Ove, but still okay.
About ten percent in, I knew I was going to struggle.It's not a fantasy book, but at least 50% of the story is based on metaphors and allegories where Backman tells us about the relationships of a kooky cast of characters who share residence in a large building full of apartments.
Her grandmother created a fantasy world of people and places to help teach Elsa a different way of looking at the world both near and afar.
In this one, the fantasy took me out of the normal love I have for Backman's style and character development to the point I found myself skimming way too often.
Review to follow.
Took me some time to get past a let's say 3.2 rating.
The final chapters pushed me over 3.5.
Heartwarming story about families and people living in one house and specifically a little girl and her grandmother.
Sometimes the story dragged on a bit, the fairytaleworld stories did not really appeal to me.
Grandma is hilarious.
Thinking about this...
A man called Ove was a stronger story for me.
'Alf says it's lucky he turned out to be a boy, because the women in our family are 'so bonkers they're a safety hazard', she chuckles....
Most of this got done by me literally spending one (1) entire evening reading this book.
And I only did it because I told someone I was going to be spending my night reading, and that made me feel pressured to do so.I do not hate this book.
What do I know.Plus I normally really like reading Scandinavian-translated books (I am the worst) because I like the way it sounds when it’s English-ized.
Maybe because the little-girl-main-character speaks English a lot.
Didn’t like it.I have really pressed the boundaries of how much I can talk about this book, so…Bottom line: It’s okay.
Read it if you feel like it?
Fredrik Backman is truly a wonderful storyteller.
He creates such unique and fun characters and puts them into such endearing, heartwarming stories.
I grew to love Elsa and her grandmother, along with Alf, George, The Monster and the wurse—and Britt-Marie, who is the main character in another of his novels!This story itself was very similar to one of my favorite books,  Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close, which was a bit strange.
I didn't realize until near the end how very similar the two stories are.
But Backman's writing is so different than Foer's that this story is absolutely still worth reading.
“My Grandmother Asked Me to Tell You She’s Sorry” is a sentimental tale, with a 7 (almost 8) year old protagonist whose sardonic voice is a real joy to read.The novel suffers from a slow start.
As mentioned previously, the child protagonist Elsa is also an engaging character to read, as Backman infuses her with observations well out of a 7 year old grasp while still writing her as a believable child.“My Grandmother Asked Me to Tell You She’s Sorry” is a sentimental and beautiful story.
Bullied at school, Granny is Elsa's best and only friend, her guide to the Land-of-Almost-Awake, a dreamscape of fairy tales, magic and adventure that comforts them both when life is difficult, and her very own superhero.She shouldn't take any notice of what those muppets think, says Granny.
With each letter, offering apologies and regrets, Elsa unravels the truth about the fairy tales that form the foundation of the Land-of-Almost-Awake, and the secrets of her grandmother's exceptional life."Elsa doesn’t know if this means that Granny took all her stories from the real world and placed them in Miamas, or if the stories from Miamas became so real that the creatures came across to the real world.
I may write a full review at a later date, but this book just didn't contain the magic that A Man Called Ove had. It is narrated from the perspective of a seven year-old girl who is precocious to the point of being unbelievable. Backman's talent lies in creating witty, cynical, elderly characters, which he should stick to because there really are so few books centred around older men and women. However, after Elsa's grandmother dies (near the beginning), the book quickly lost its sparkle.
But then I learn it’s about a precocious Swedish girl at seven going on eight and some kind of fairy-tale quest guided by letters from her grandmother.
Young Elsa makes a perfect team with her grandmother to put the adult world in its place.
When her grandmother is no longer around, Elsa gets tapped to deliver a series of letters to various people in her building, and she is compelled to find out the secrets behind why there is a message of apology to all of them.
I also read his short stories and sadly didn’t enjoy them, I said it before and I repeat it; Backman is a great contemporary author but he should keep into that and not venture into fantasy.🌟 His writing is just so relatable, so close to my heart and I easily gets into his stories.
I don’t usually care about ages in stories because most characters are precocious but Elsa seemed like a prodigy and wasn’t convincing for me.🌟 Summary: This is a good book -It is written by Backman after all- which has great writing and unique characters as usual.
There was a mix between a fantasy story and a real one, I expected a more emotional read but didn’t get that.
I have finally finished all of Fredrik Backmans books! #mygrandmotheraskedmetotellyoushessorry and it was an adorable and whimsical read..It’s not my favorite of Backmans books but none the less enjoyable. Be on the lookout in a couple of weeks for a whole video about Fredrik Backmans books and my favorites!

These three live in a building shared with such occupants as Elsa’s grandmother, affectionately called Granny, as well as a number of others including a "Monster", a dog, and a drunk.
Elsa describes her perfectly: "Granny isn’t particularly good at living in the real world.
But she does tell the very best fairy tales ever, and for that Elsa can forgive quite a few character defects." In fact, the book is full of these fairy tales into "The-Land-of-Almost-Awake" cooked up by Granny herself.
I loved learning about those left to protect Elsa and how they all rallied around her during her time of need.
Which is why there are cookies.”― Fredrik Backman, My Grandmother Asked Me to Tell You She's Sorry I really loved this book!
My Grandmother Asked Me to Tell You She's Sorry is a tremendously imaginative, touching, clever story, that I already know will be among my favorites this year.
The setting of this novel is a fairly small one, but it heightens the sense of community and friendship, and it makes the characters question what it means to be a family in a traditional sense and a more abstract one.
It certainly lacks the charm of his first book.There is a large cast of characters, each with their own stories and each drawn very sharply, and most important, each is weird in their own specific manner.
In parallel, we get stories from The Land of Almost Awake, a fantasy creation of Elsa's grandmother to draw her away from her tough life and keep her entertained.
Elsa discovers that the fairy tales ultimately tied up to the stories of the other characters in the book, but this doesn't make them any more readable.
I am sure that my review of this book will go against the main stream....however....Had this been the first book I read by Backman I would have stopped there.
The absolute only redeeming quality that I felt it had was the cross over of characters from his other books.
I felt that there was way too much time and too many pages put into the fairy tales.
A bit of back story was needed, but I was tired of the non-stop fairly tale descriptions long before Granny died.
I finished this book, but it took all I had to continue to pick it back up.
Another Backman goodness. This man could do no wrong.
book #1 in my fredrick backman binge (in publication order) challenge (nOt cLicKbAiT)damn this guy knows how to build and create and craft a story that gets you so involved and invested in these characters that they feel like real humans that are a part of your lifei love this dysfunctional, mess-of-a-family, leaseholders' association i've never seen a more beautiful relationship of a grandmother and her granddaughter 😭😭😭😭 so pure, so wholesome, so preciousalso it was hilarious, like actual laugh-out-loud quality jokes despite all the sadness and tragedy 4 stars!
Grandmother enlists Elsa in her antics and Elsa is a willing henchman while Granny helps to offset the bullying Elsa experiences regularly at school.Granny has created a world through stories, a world that is both complex and simple, the Land-of-Almost-Awake.
This land has it's own structure, myths, heroes and villains and offers some rules that can help in Elsa's world.
It offers a story which centers on a child without being childish; it has elements of fantasy while ultimately being grounded in this world.
And it has some wonderfully complex characters.A copy of this book was provided by the publisher through NetGalley in return for an honest review.
