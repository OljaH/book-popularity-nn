Well, Christmas is coming very soon (I'm in the midst of final exams personally, so it doesn't feel like it), but I figured it might be nostalgic to read this old classic Christmas tale.
But does Rudolph have a hidden advantage that could save Christmas?Every kid has faced rejection/bullying from peers at least once, so this story isn't just some Christmas sing-along but also a good tale about acceptance and unity during the holiday season, or any other time.
If you like me don't have a vinyl record of the song accompanying the book, I'm sure a quick YouTube search will resurrect it.
Not me, I can't think of a word to say about the book except when I read it I was home again, in my dreams anyway.
The tree is sitting on a platform with a train around it, a train I never saw except at Christmas and have no idea where it disappeared to during the rest of the year.
Chocolate chip cookies, peanut butter, sugar, oatmeal, any kind of cookie you can think of we have in tin cans.
are gone, mom drags us out into the mountain to cut "greens" to make decorations for the porch.
These are the things I thought about as I read this book.
In combination with Gene Autry singing on the old 78 rpm, "Ru-dolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer/ Had a very shine-yy nose / And if you ever saw-wit,/ you would even say IT GLOWS..." Why I say it may be good to age eleven: the theme of course is rejection by one's peers, "They never let poor Rudolph / Play in any reindeer games." Rejection by peers is a common misgiving of kids and early adolescents--as well as, according to the adds for acne medicine and hair and skin and nail and clothes products, many adults as well.
In the Rankin/Bass movie version of Rudolph, I love Rudolph, but can't stand Santa.
When I was a kid, I used to feel guilty about not liking Santa, I mean, he was Santa!
But now that I'm an adult, I can see how rude and mean Santa was in the movie -- right up until the end when he needed something from Rudolph.
Rudolph himself, however, is still sweet and endearing, the story is a good interpretation of the classic Christmas song.
The illustrations were done by Richard Scarry -- pre-1970s Richard Scarry, which is maybe not as stylized or recognizable as post-1970s Scarry, but is softer, sweeter and more endearing than post-1970s Scarry.
I'm pretty sure we all know the story of Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer.
If you don't for some reason, Barbara recreates this classic tale of a reindeer that was basically the runt of the litter and couldn't lead Santa's sleigh or even be a part of it because of that.
The illumination on his nose as he meets the pretty little girl reindeer is the biggest thing on the entire page.
With a nose that big of course Santa would be in need on a foggy Christmas night; and Rudolph saved Christmas.
Always a good children story.
A cute clever children's book that became a classic for good reason. For a short time span the rhymes and story can speak to children and adults easily - from bullying and isolation to acceptance. A great way to capture the Christmas spirit with children.
Great story! Wonderful lesson!! Misfits find their places!!
Copyright 1958. This is a Little Golden Book. Barbara Shook Hazen takes the song & writes a complete story. She does a very good job! Illustrations by Richard Scarry are great too. Love those big eyed reindeer!
Rudolph is always being made fun of for being different from the other reindeers until the day he gets to help Santa deliver the gifts and he saves Christmas. This would be a great book to teach students everyone is different.
