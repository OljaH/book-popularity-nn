And what a great book it is!
The ultimate revenge novel!
That's the plot of this highly entertaining novel that can best be summed up as, don't get mad, get even!
With revenge that can be described as "playful" rather than mean-spirited, the book has a light-hearted tone that will leave readers upbeat.The story is so descriptive, informative, greatly entertaining and hilarious at times.
I particularly liked the scene during the wedding at the end of the book, it was highly intense and super hilarious.Have you ever wanted to get even?
I mean really even.
Then you should read this novel :)
Britanci su po ovom romanu snimili vrhunsku seriju... davno, davno...
I found the narrative voice impossibly wooden, providing a long, dull recap of the villain's life before introducing the main characters with a lot of facts and very little personality. Other than cliche French from the Frenchman, they all talked alike.It was so dull I began to skim, hoping the story would pick up. It didn't.The revenge was a drop in the bucket--I doubt the villain even noticed--and furthermore, it only came off because of a deus ex machina delivered by the narrative voice withholding certain facts. And yet it was a phenomenal best seller. Wow!
This book was among their highly recommended reads.
Realizing he's been had, he recruits three other victims (a handsome doctor, a French gallery owner, and a playboy lord of the realm) to steal back what Harvey took from them -- not a penny more, not a penny less.The cons of the con man are exciting, clever, and delightfully poetic.
The action is exciting, while comic, along the lines of "Ocean's 11." There's no violence, but there is some romance (though it too is a product of its time).All in all, a good fun read.
Jeffrey Archer's first book and a grossly over-rated one at that.
Although Archer can write well - I was not much impressed by the plot.
Four people swindled by a rich man.
But he is so rich (several hundred million rich) that the amount he swindled them out of (a quarter of a million each) hardly seems worth the effort!They make a mutual pledge to get the money back - and each must devise a scheme for doing so.
But the feckless "hero" of the book (presumably based on Archer himself) hasn't a clue how to do so.
Jeffrey Archer did, presumably, because he had contacts.
Thoroughly enjoyable. These four dudes are so clever, they'd better make sure their feet don't fall off. #BlackadderReference
"The conned: an Oxford don, a revered society physician, a chic French art dealer, and a charming English lord.
They have one thing in common.
Overnight, each novice investor lost his life's fortune to one man.
The con: Harvey Metcalfe!!A brilliant, self-made guru of deceit.
A very dangerous individual.
And now, a hunted man.With nothing left to lose four strangers are about to come together-each expert in their own field.
Their plan: find Harvey, shadow him, trap him, and penny-for-penny, destroy him.
From the luxurious casinos of Monte Carlo to the high-stakes windows at Ascot to the bustling streets of Wall Street to fashionable London galleries, their own ingenious game has begun.
Jeffrey Archer: The Truth?A brilliant, self-made guru of deceit. A very dangerous individual. And, now, a hunted man. Fiction or autobiography ("Jeffrey Archer: The Truth?"), you be the judge. And if the author doesn't like the answer, he can sue us for everything we've got, not a penny more, not a penny less.** (view spoiler)[Australia introduced decimal currency on February 14, 1966.

اولین کتابی بود که از جفری آرچر میخووندم!جفری آرچر نویسنده کتاب «کین و ایبل» یا «هابیل و قابیل» است و کتاب «پیچشی در داستان» است. «نه یک پنی بیشتر،نه یک پنی کمتر» اولین کتابش در پائیز 1974 بود که برای رهایی از ورشکستگی نوشت.و البته کتابِ جالب و حتی خاصی بود.از کتابهای آرچر،تاکنون ۳۳۰ میلیون در جهان فروخته شده!
Πουλάει κυρίως τη μοντέρνα ελληνική λογοτεχνία (?) αλλά, επειδή πιστεύω ότι πάντοτε μπορεί κάποιος να ανακαλύψει ένα ασημένιο δαχτυλίδι μέσα στην άμμο (εναλλακτικά "μέσα στο βούρκο", για να μη θίξω υπολήψεις), ρίχνω μια ματιά στα έξωθεν καλάθια πριν επιβιβαστώ στο όχημα.
Φαντάζομαι ότι είναι εξαντλημένο.Από ό,τι είδα εκ των υστέρων, είναι το πρώτο βιβλίο του συγγραφέα, τότε που ήταν άμαθος και άσημος.
Το βιβλίο είναι ψυχαγωγικό, ευχάριστο για να περνά η ώρα και να φαντάζεσαι τον εαυτό σου στην Bond street να χαζεύει βιτρίνες.Μερικά σημεία του είναι κακοστημένα και κάπως ψεύτικα αλλά είπαμε, ανήκει στα ψυχαγωγικά βιβλία και οι αβαρίες εμπεριέχονται στο easy reading και το happy end.
Masa zaman belajar dulu, kawan sekelas aku sorang ni suka collect buku Jeffrey Archer.
So bila baca buku ni mesti membayangkan suasana dan prasarana sekitar tahun2 yang begitu lah.
Harvey Metcalfe adalah businesman yang mengumpulkan kekayaan dengan cara 'mengenakan' orang.
Ada 4 orang yang sudah 'terkena' dengan Harvey Metcalfe ni decide untuk bergabung idea dan tenaga untuk mengutip kembali setiap sen yang telah dirampas oleh Metcalfe.
4 orang dengan kelebihan dan kebijaksanaan yang berbeza.
Kane And Abel ties with it for the first place :) ]Though his later day novels turned in to kind of similar concepts predictable twists and turns , his earlier works were really, really good.
This book falls in to that category.You must be feeling I am glorifying it a little too much :) When have finished reading it ,you will be saying the same.
Language is simple thus making it a easy read.Give it a try and tell me what you felt about this book
Male chauvinism at its most shameless.
Never will I read Archer again💁Edit: I get that this was published in 1976, and the kind of misogyny in here was tolerated way more back then, but I'm shocked that nobody's reviews reflect how not okay this book is.
The sexism was *not* subtle...especially the part on page 231 which seems in favour of domestic violence if it is 'called for'???
HIS BEHAVIOUR IS TAKEN AS A JOKE???That's only one example of dozens throughout this book.
I certainly hope that Archer's current novels are nothing like this one, but I won't be opening one to check.
I very much enjoyed this little romp of revenge - a shadowy businessman runs a sharemarket pump and dump scam stealing a million dollars from four investors. Upon realising they've been scammed the four people join forces to recover the exact amount, not a penny more, not a penny less, back through various schemes.The various schemes and developments in the story line keep the pages turning as you keep wondering if they're really going to pull it off or if this is the time they'll get caught making for an entertaining and captivating read.
I have come to admire Jeffrey Archer and his works.
The attention to detail he gives to his characters is something I love.
Every detail seems to serve a purpose to propel the story.
The story made me smile at the extremes some will go to in order to get what they want/need.
However improbable this story may have been, I liked that it exacted revenge in a gentlemanly way.
It was smart and not 'guns and violence'.
Don't get me wrong, I like guns and violence to some degree, but this was not the book for that.

I really enjoyed this one (on audio). It's an old book (1974) with some references to marrying the bonny Prince Charles - then a bachelor. Still, it stands the test of time with its crooks and deceit. Lots of fun on the road.
In some ways this read like an experiment by the author to test out this whole "being an author" thing, but overall, Archer was able to weave together an engaging story with a very unique style.For the majority of this book it was Archer's style that got my attention more than the narrative he was creating.
I was wholly impressed with Archer's attention to detail here but then greatly confused when, much later in the book, Harvey describes his time at Wimbledon by saying he, "got to see an American win." (paraphrased from memory) For a man of Harvey's character and given Archer's previously detailed description, it was jolting for Harvey not to have noted Ashe becoming the first black man to take a Wimbledon title, Billie Jean retiring after winning her 6th, or that Americans won every title that year.
This was Jeffrey Archer's first novel,men who are the victims of a swindle seek their revenge.Archer himself lost his money in real life and it forced him to turn to writing in a bid to improve his financial health. After having read it several years ago,I picked it up again but didn't find it particularly compelling.Still,this book helped launch Archer's bestselling career.
And there my first Jeffrey Archer is finished. And a nice one to start with. Am I impressed? Ya to some extends. For a thriller it was an easy read and a page turner. Somethings u bound to guess... And loops holes... Yup a few here and there.... May be a 4star rating will suffice
The usual fare, for this sort of novel, but familiarity does not always breed contempt, and, on this occasion, it didn’t seem to be a major, gut-churning problem.In Not a Penny More, Not a Penny Less, a group of men conned out of a great deal of money decide to band together, in the name of revenge and brotherhood, to win back A) their money, and B) their respect, and ultimately live happily ever after.Or something.
There’s no fatal blow, no crushing destruction that will end his fame and fortune forever, and no indication that while our heroes swagger off towards the sunset, the villain is left bankrupt, bereft, and miserably belligerent.
It was his suggestion to start with "Not a penny more, not a penny less", after getting exhausted with Fredrick Forsyth "The Afghan", I got myself into a state of tireless after reading 'Not a penny more, not a penny less'.
Narration to the characters, circumstances and places were very minimal thus making the total number of pages of the novel under two hundred.
My words will not be enough to praise this novel or the author, but I wanted to keep the review simple and short, hope this review helps all the future readers of ‘Not a penny more, note a penny less’ and Jeffrey Archer.
I thoroughly enjoyed reading the first piece of marvel from Jeffrey Archer.
Of all the Jeffrey Archer books I have read, I have liked this one the least.
Jeffrey Archer in his own words loves to write simple novels, simple fiction for everybody to read and understand.
Not meaning to say that this book was anything like that but it was simply uncharacteristic of Jeffrey Archer.
His works like Kane and Abel, The Prodigal Daughter and As the Crow Flies according to me are among the best literary fiction books of all time.
Kane and Abel certainly will be for me one of the top 10 fiction books of all time.
An elaborate plan to get money - in this case, to get money back, is the kind of stuff that Archer writes really well.
The book begins with a bit of background on Harvey Metclafe, and as soon as you start to feel proud of his enterprising efforts, you realize he is going to con a few innocent people of a million, and he immediately becomes the 'villain'.
But, once they decide to take their money back, 'not a penny more, not a penny less', but the million plus whatever expenses it takes to carry out their plans, there's no stopping them.
La búsqueda de una copia fue lo más interesante, desde que leí la biografía de Jeffrey Archer quise leerlo, la trama es muy boba, pero me divirtió
Am a big fan of Jeffery Archer and this book was completely enjoyable to read.Brilliant plot, humorous and a terrific climax. Its about how a team of 4 people claim their money they had deposited as shares in a fraudulent Oil Company. Also this book happens to Archer's first novel published in 1976 and was inspired by his real life experience of near-bankruptcy.
The title says the whole point of the book. A ponzie scheme that four people fall prey to and retrieval of their money from the antagonist. An exciting read just for the methods which the four protagonist adapt to retrieve the money
Not so very exciting. Decent, fast paced yet very much predictable. Definitely not the best of Jeffrey 's. Definitely an inspiration for a Grisham fan and a Bollywood thrilller
High flyer swindler Harry Metcalfe meets his match. Scammed by those he cheated and none the wiser. Extremely easy story to follow that entertained from start to finish!!Wonder if James succeed in recovering that US$1.24 for the team?
Have read years ago. Still entertaining
