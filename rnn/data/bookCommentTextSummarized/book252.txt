Ideas of the Cartesian body are fascinating and abstract. Enjoyed this with several glasses of wine.
God, a demon, some wax, oh my! Good ol' Descartes, where would we be if not for your enthusiastic fumbling in the dark?
Philosophy + mathematics. Could you wish for more?
I've never been a huge Descartes fan, but this particular edition of his writings is helpful in that it offers objections and replies, as well as a spectrum (of sorts) as to the topics he wrote about and what those topics mean in the overall scheme of early modern philosophy. This text was assigned in my PHIL580 (Modern Philosophy, Descartes to Kant) course and it set the par for the course very well.
Meditations on First Philosophy is a good introduction to modern philosophy and methodological skepticism. The CSM translates the original text clearly, and provides footnotes to further explain Descartes' argumentation. As far as philosophical texts go, Meditations is a relatively simple, personal, and entertaining read. I would recommend this to anyone with an interest in modern philosophy.
Je pense, donc je suis.

A classic! One of the key texts of the last millennium and in deed the whole of philosophy - still central to many university philosophy courses.
For a Decart fan, this one sums the best of the best, I can read it 10 times more and still enjoy it.
