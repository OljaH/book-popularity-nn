But it turns out it's about an eighteen year old woman with dark, deadly skills being chased and hunted by a terrible and deadly enemy.Sabriel has a good, clear head on her shoulder.
The characters in Sabriel are all interesting and capturing in their way.
I was actually on the edge of my seat throughout most of the book.In some parts it's really freaky and quite scary, in other parts it's sad.This is the second male author I've come across lately that has written female characters BETTER than the women have been writing them lately.
You can't even compare Sabriel to a character like Bella.
3.5 stars Death and what came after death was no great mystery to Sabriel. She just wished it was. Sabriel is of a dying breed. She and her adoptive father can communicate with the dead and the damned from the Old Kingdom.Only they can confront such creatures and send them back to the gates of death.Then, during the first semester of Sabriel's school, her father, the Abhorsen, goes missing and Sabriel is unwittingly promoted to the Abhorson. Does the walker choose the path, or the path the walke
It's kind of like if you jumped into the seventh Harry Potter book without the first few novels of magical background - it was frustratingly complex.The other thing that really bugged me was the "love" interest.
Sabriel and the "love" interest were essentially acquaintances (or perhaps pals, if you want to stretch it) but all of a sudden, before the big battle, THIS happens: 
Between the magic mayhem and the bland-to-non-existent-love, I never formed an emotional connection to any of the main characters or the plot (other than Mogget - Mogget was the shining star in the clouded night).It felt like I was being dragged on a journey rather than eagerly plunging into a new series.
Re/read on audio. Tim Curry rocks the narration 😊💕 "Yes," said Abhorsen. "I am a necromancer, but not of the common kind. where others of the art raise the dead, I lay them back to rest. And those that will not rest, I bind-or try to. I am Abhorsen . . ."He looked at the baby again, and added, almost with a note of surprise, "Father of Sabriel." Oh, what a wonderful little book. I loved Sabriel so much. She was so tough and just got things done. She received a message from her father and she kne
. ."He looked at the baby again, and added, almost with a note of surprise, "Father of Sabriel."
She received a message from her father and she knew things were not right.
This message takes Sabriel on a journey to find her father and find and kill the evil that is happening across the land.
There's a big story there but you can read it yourself.
They go on a journey to get away from the evil that is trying to kill Sabriel while trying to set things right.
I look forward to the rest of the books =)Happy Reading!
This book really should have been exciting but I actually would have had a much better time had I just blared Monster Mash from my stereo and danced around like a zombie with chicken skin pasted to my face. Jedi knight of the living dead! I feel like this was probably really cool in the 90's and if I had read it then, as my pre-Harry Potter 10 year old self. I probably would have loved it. But now, my brain has descended into different forms of oblivion and I laugh voraciously at danger. Ha-ha-h
Not to mention, I said shiznit.I'm going to give you my (bored face) half-hearted summary because the story is way to convoluted to go into much depth without lulling myself into a coma.Sabriel is told from the third person perspective of a young girl, named Sabriel (what a co-inky-dink), a necromancer whose father disappears into the realm of the dead.
Usually I can tolerate slower books in audio form but this one really left a lot to be desired.The narrator was very good at distinct voices for each character but some of them, namely the monsters, were unbearable, with gasping and hissing and gurgling.
It's up to Sabriel and her companions, a talking cat with mysterious powers and a once-sorta-dead (for 200 years) guy, to try to turn things around.This is a well-written and enjoyable fantasy, occasionally a little on the grim and gruesome side, but still within the bounds of what I'd consider YA appropriate, at least for teens who aren't too sensitive.
I haven't gotten around to reading the rest of the series, but they're on my "probably, sometime" mental list.Content notes: Frequent battles with deadly creatures who sometimes resemble zombies.
The novel is set in two neighbouring fictional countries: To the South lies Ancelstierre, which has a technology level and society similar to that of early-20th century Australia, and to the North lies the Old Kingdom, where both Free magic and Charter Magic exist — a fact officially denied by the government of Ancelstierre and disbelieved by most of Ancelstierre's inhabitants.
Near the border some magic crosses the Wall, especially on days when the wind is blowing out of the Old Kingdom.
به نقل از تایمز: داستان سابریل مملو از شخصیتهای جالب، صحنه های جذاب و هیجان است، خواندن کتاب لذت محض است.
$1.99 on Amazon Kindle: December 21, 2017I'll be honest: this is a book I never would have made it through unless I listened to it. TIM CURRY did a  fabulous and amazing  job narrating this fantasy. I suppose it's "young adult," even though the book really begins with the main character being 18. Sabriel went to an all-girl school for magic. The story picks up near the end of her education. She leaves because a messenger from her father sends her his bells and sword and she realizes he is in tro
She leaves because a messenger from her father sends her his bells and sword and she realizes he is in trouble.Most of the story is about Sabriel's journey to save her father and escape Dead creatures and the evil free magic being called Kerrigor.
One is another free magic creature called Mogget.
As long as Mogget is bound by his collar, he looks and acts like a sarcastic small white cat.
I quite liked both Mogget and Touchstone!
I plan to continue listening to the series, as Tim Curry narrates them all and my library has them all too!
It seemed like I had seen a lot of the story's elements before (like the villain who's been distorted by magic and can't be killed until his ancient body is found), but also figured that this book probably did those things first since it was published over 20 years ago.But there was just something about the story that made it SUPER hard to connect with.
Like the story was full of SO many cool action scenes and creepy creative things, but it still didn't feel action packed.
“Then Sabriel hears it - the massed grinding of Dead joints, no longer joined by gristle; the padding of Dead feet, bones like hobtails clicking through necrotic flesh.” Now, I’ll admit a book involving the dead (or zombies if you will) wouldn’t be a normal pick for me.
Despite this, Sabriel kept my attention and there was plenty of magic and world building to hook me in!Sabriel’s father is the Abhorsen - a necromancer with a difference!
I really enjoyed this, it was a quick read and though parts of the magic system were a bit tough to figure out I thought it was a great concept and I’ve never read anything else like it!

I first read Sabriel as a preteen, and while I know I loved it – I must have, as I asked my parents to buy me the second book in the series, too – I never continued the series, nor did I remember any of the details whatsoever.
I think this was definitely just a sign of inexperienced writing, because even by the end of the book, I was able to connect with her more solidly, and I hear that this particular writing issue is one that is resolved in the other books in this series.Even without feeling like Sabriel is a three-dimensional, complex character, I still soundly enjoyed who she had the potential to be.
Although the book doesn't really show Sabriel with her father, (the present Abhorsen (a person who sends the restless dead back where they belong), all that much, I loved the relationship between the two.
A rich father-daughter relationship always appeals in a story, and I think readers of a similar mind will enjoy this part of the book.For many years, I didn't read fantasy.
This book has truly lit me on fire to read more fantasy.
“Let this be my final lesson. Everyone and everything has a time to die.” I really wish I had liked Sabriel more than I actually did. It had a decent idea, however, as I kept reading I continuously kept thinking about events in my life or my plans for the next day. My mind kept drifting off because I was purely so bored. I believe merely saying a book is boring isn’t a convincing or a valid reason to conclude that the book wasn’t good. Have you ever read a book where endless things are happenin
To the south lies Ancelstierre where technology and society is comparable to the 20th century England, and to the north lies the Old Kingdom where magic and spirits wander the land.
In the Old Kingdom there is always a sorcerer with the title Abhorsen who puts the dead (spirits) to rest.
The dead are raised by Necromancers or black magicians, who roam the Old Kingdom.
Sabriel is an Abhorsen who lives in Ancelstierre and her dad lives in the Old Kingdom.
I feel an obligation to like fantasy books that have original concepts, considering fantasy is one of my favourite genres.
Possibly one of the greatest fantasy adventures of our times, Garth Nix's first novel is a lush, magical, dark-witty adventure about a young woman's battle with the hideous Dead.The story starts with a flashback in which a special necromancer named Abhorsen saves his baby daughter Sabriel from a creature called Kerrigor, in the spiritual river of death.
To do so, she must leave her relatively high-tech home for the Old Kingdom, where magic rules and evil things are stalking her.Along the way, she is accompanied by the guard Touchstone and the menacing/funny cat-spirit Mogget.
4.5 stars
But I’m sure that they would have been right up thirteen-year-old Madeline’s alley – I can’t speak for the rest of the series, but Sabriel is sort of like a blend of Tamora Pierce and Lloyd Alexander, with a heavy dash of Goth elements.
Sabriel spent the first few years of her life in the Old Kingdom with her father, a necromancer known as “the Abhorsen”, but has lived in Ancelstierre for her entire adolescence.
However, if you’re like me, you’re going to want to continue with the series, if only to find out how Sabriel continues to explore her role as a necromancer, and what other adventures Nix has planned for his heroine.
The world and magic of the Old Kingdom is unlike many magic systems I've come across, and it's great how he never once spends more than two pages to explain things away.
She proves to be a quick-witted heroine, and Garth Nix doesn't cheapen her character and throws her into some really awesome, breathtaking conflicts.As a last note, although this is the first book of a trilogy, it's a solid story all on its own so you can pick it up with no worries as to whether you should complete the series or not.
He termed this as "one of the fundamental experiences that helped me shape my philosophy on magic systems and worldbuilding." With such an endorsement from my favourite author of all time, I cannot possibly pass over this book.
The narrative then jumps ahead eighteen years where Sabriel was now in the final semester of her college studies when she discovered that her father, the Abhorsen, is in mortal danger and decided immediately to head into the Old Kingdom to rescue him.Now, let's appreciate the worldbuilding a bit.
The Old Kingdom is separated from the modern world by a Wall, which keeps the Dead who wouldn't stay dead away from Ancelstierre.
Really enjoyed this one! Although there wasn't much character development, I didn't really care because Sabriel is a total badass. I'm very excited for the sequel.
Sabriel is one hell of a kick ass character. No whinging, no feeling sorry for herself - she gets shit done! Anyone who loves ya fiction, magic and dystopian universes definitely needs to give this book a try!!
Where was this book when I needed it?5 stars!Seriously, this book was GLORIOUS. If you want fast-paced, will-keep-you-on-the-edge-of-your-seat, action-packed book, this one is for you.Mogget is hands down my favourite character in this book. He's so sassy and sarcastic and morbid and fluffy and I just love him! “It sounds like a terribly brilliant plan to me,” muttered Mogget. “The genius of simplicity…” The character development of Sabriel and Touchstone was brilliant especially Sabriel's.

If you want fast-paced, will-keep-you-on-the-edge-of-your-seat, action-packed book, this one is for you.Mogget is hands down my favourite character in this book.
“It sounds like a terribly brilliant plan to me,” muttered Mogget.
The character development of Sabriel and Touchstone was brilliant especially Sabriel's.
Don't get me wrong, you guys know I'm a sucker for romance and can ship almost every character with any living things but the romance here felt like a throwaway.
His descriptions were so clear that you could picture the world so vividly in your head.I am looking forward to read the next books in the series!
Sabriel searches for her father, the Abhorsen, a sort of necromancer, who is lost in the land of the dead.
Along the way she meets a spirit under the control of the Abhorsens for about fourteen centuries and a sailor nicknamed Touchstone.
His breath is described as having "the scent of a thousand abattoirs." I will finish this series-all Tim Curry Bahahaha Read#2- I totally forgot how directions are given in this series.
It breaks on her adventure-for her father, for her role she must assume.2017 Reading Challenge: first in a seriesSummer Fantasy Fest read #21
Wickedly amazing world building but sadly too little character portrayal, if that's even a thing? It was too adventure-driven for my taste and while the setting immediately fascinated me, I never felt like I knew the characters and thus could never rly connect with them.
This was a thoroughly enjoyable, fresh-feeling book about 18 year old Sabriel and her quest through the land of her birth.
Of course, I should point out that this book was published in 1995, well before the genre was Twilighted and, as such, there were no uber emo teenagers angsting over their melodramatic love triangles.
Instead we get a sensible and somewhat awkward young heroine who is afraid of the dark currents swirling around her, anxious about her abilities to meet the oncoming challenges, yet nevertheless determined to deal with any obstacles as they come.
I still have some questions about how that whole situation evolved and I hope that the answers will come in the rest of the trilogy.
Sabriel's father is the Abhorsen, the most powerful of necromancers who can bind the dead and stop them breaking through to the real world.Since her mother died when she was born, Sabriel is sent away to boarding school and only sees her father twice per year.
Ancelstierre, the southern kingdom, where Sabriel is sent to school is safe and people live uneventful lives without the use of magic but the northern part of the kingdom, the Old Kingdom where Abhorsen must live is full of magic, good and evil where the dead can break through more easily and come back to attack the living.
It is full of cool ideas - the standard fantasy setting here is under threat from an undead wizard and its hordes, and also happens to border (via a magical wall) a setting analogous to early 20th century Britain.
All protected by a line of hereditary necromancers.
There was also the issue of the magical solutions to the various problems all seeming to appear as required.'Friends' character the protagonist is most like:Like many YA heroines, Sabriel is Monica Geller.
Despite being a rookie necromancer raised in the fantasy equivalent of a pre-WWI English finishing school she is extremely relatable.
Possibly the greatest compliment that I could give this book is to say that it reminds me, in a non copy-cat way, of the first fantasy series to really sweep me away in my teenhood!
Sabriel is a story about a badass heroine who is charged with saving the world!
I love that shit, guys!!The world building, although at times tedious, is amazing - I love the way this world is created, how death itself is portrayed AND necromancers....
I love the idea of necromancers!!
It took nothing away from the story, for me, that I guessed it almost the minute he showed up.
I have picked it up and abandoned it quite frequently over the year, mostly because about 50 pages through the book, I would start yawning.
But, once you go through those first mind numbing 100 pages, this book is actually pretty decent.The novel is set in two neighbouring fictional countries: The Old Kingdom to the north, where magic works and dangerous spirits roam the land and the :Ancelstierre, to the south, the “muggle land” with people blissfully ignorant except for those few who live near the border between the kingdoms.
Sabriel, our protagonist, is placed with this huge responsibility of being an Abhorsen, when suddenly her father goes missing, thus, likes all fantasy heroes and heroines, she is placed with the duty of saving the world and rescuing her father.
I have read many fantasy books and I can say with certainty that this is one of those stories that stand out.
Like many other fantasy books, it takes a little time to understand what is going on and really get into the story, but when that happens, you will most likely take a deep breath, dive in and refuse to come out before the end.Sabriel is a young girl but she is an adult inside.
You just have to imagine and put yourself in Sabriel's place and you will successfully scare the hell out of yourselves.I really enjoyed reading this book.
