This is me--a huge Tim Burton fan (or so I thought):One day, while carelessly browsing the Internets, I came across a book that I had no idea existed.
Yes, this book is not available anywhere in Bulgaria.
This is where frustration got the better of me...But I said to myself: "Fear not, Tina, for you have the power of the Internets and the credit card, and have been given upon birth the gift of patience--you shall order this book online from a country where Tim Burton's books actually exist!".
This is me now, loving my book and loving Tim Burton even more:

It is written in a way that seems to be funny, and for some people, this is a book that includes some weird poems that made them laugh and that's it.
There are poems like The Girl Who Turned into a Bed, Sue and Jimmy, the Hideous Penguin Boy that made me smile with a feeling of "what a piece of rare work this guy is".
Like any other book that seems simply written but contains complex ideas, forgotten values and familiar feelings.Oct 26, 13* Also on my blog.* Photo credit: Picture from The Melancholy Death of Oyster Boy and Other Stories by Tim Burton.
A short collection of macabre poems, illustrated like a children's book, but aimed more at the YA market, and delightful for dark-thinking adults as well. There are lots of gory things about eyes, stories of non-human children (toxic, half robot, half oyster etc) and a most inappropriate present from Santa. Occasionally the rhythm doesn't quite work at the first attempt, but even so, it's great fun. It is strongly reminiscent of Hilaire Belloc's Cautionary Tales for Children (my review HERE), but VERY obviously the work of Tim Burton. His wiry, but colour, illustrations, perfectly complement his dark words.
Reading this tiny tome was sort of like taking a prolonged vacation on The Island of Really, Really Misfit Toys. The natives are strange but friendly. They take some getting used to, but after a while, you'll want to hug them...BUT be careful - many of them have sharp objects sticking out of their bellies. The Boy with Nails in His EyesThe Boy with Nails in His Eyesput up his aluminum tree.It looked pretty strangebecause he couldn't see. The above is a pretty good example of what's in this book

The above is a pretty good example of what's in this book and should tell you whether or not it's for you.
Bad things happen to stick figures and little mummy boys.
Children get eaten by their parents and a girl turns into a bed.If you have a fondness for all things misbegotten AND find that fairy tales are not quite disturbing enough, you should have room in your heart for Melonhead and maybe even Jimmy, the Hideous Penguin Boy.
This was FANTASTIC. OH MAN. SO GOOD. I don't have much to say. It's a collection of short poems and accompanying doodles by Tim Burton. It's damned creepy, freaking depressing, laugh out loud funny, and utterly awesome.
nothing but macabre, delightfully weird and absolutely nonsensical: this is why i'm a tim burton stan. i couldn't have picked a better time to reread this. halloween month without burton content???? not in this household. "The Boy with Nails in His Eyesput up his aluminum tree.It looked pretty strangebecause he couldn't really see." THIS IS THE //QUALITY CONTENT// I SIGNED UP FOR.i would marry tim burton's humor if i could. most of his art just doesn't make sense at all, and that's why i fuck wi
THIS IS THE //QUALITY CONTENT// I SIGNED UP FOR.i would marry tim burton's humor if i could.
combined with his creepy art style the melancholy death of oyster boy & other stories makes up the perfect read for this time of year.the reason why i'm not rating it any higher than three stars is purely because it's just not that deep.
after that you kinda just let it simmer in the back of your mind and quickly forget about it.however, if you stan tim burton’s humor/art style as much as i do i would definitely recommend you to check this out!
Τι τέλειο μικρούτσικο βιβλιαράκι ήταν αυτό! Γκυκούτσικες και σκοτεινούτσικες ιστοριούλες γραμμένες σε στοίχους με πολύ ωραία διακριτικά, χρωματιστά και ασπρόμαυρα σχεδιάκια, πολύ πολύ ταιριαστά με την ατμόσφαιρα του βιβλίου!!Πολύ πολύ μου άρεσε!
This collection of dark comedy poetry was at times very funny and creative, but at other times too strange for its own good. It's a good balance I guess, my favourite one being the 'Toxic Boy' poem.
I wonder what it would be like to live inside Tim Burton's head ala Being John Malkovich, such talent, such virile imaginations, to dwell within his noggin for a while, you know?
I went into this fully expecting weird quirkiness, maybe little bit of creepy Gothicness, but I found most of the stories to be very twisted darkly so, which I end up enjoying anyways.
Stick Boy and Match Girl were very sweet but in a Tim Burton fashion.
I feel like I know him a little better for it, after reading this collection.
Dream till they let you.

It's the perfect opportunity to visit Burton’s unique and unusual mind, and is not to be missed.

از تیم برتونی که این بالا نوشتم میشه حدس زد که این یه کتاب متفاوته.مجموعه ایه از داستان های خیلی کوتاه با تصویرهای فوق العاده جذاب و سوژه های عجیب غریب!سوژه های این کتاب اغلب بچه هایی هستن که به نحوی غیر طبیعی هستن و به همین دلیل تنهان و طرد شده ن.نویسنده با لحن بیخیال و بچگانه چیزایی میگه که در عین خنده دار و مسخره بودن، غم انگیزن. بر خلاف ظاهرش از نظر من این کتاب مناسب بچه ها نیست!خیلی کتاب ظریف و دوست داشتنی ایه.
The Melancholy Death of Oyster Boy & Other Stories is a collection of poems written by filmmaker Tim Burton.
A sampling of the titles in this collection yields funny-until-you-realize-they're-not eponymous characters, like The Boy with Nails in His Eyes, The Girl Who Turned Into a Bed, and Melonhead.
Aside from composing the lines that narrate their not so kid-friendly stories, Burton also illustrated the plight of Oyster Boy and his miserable company in this collection.
دوتا چیز مهم فقط: کاغذ خیلی زیادی حیف شده و خوندنش به فارسی لطفی ندارهحالا کلا متنشم عجیب غریب و غیردوستداشتنی بود برام. اما به انگلیسیش حداقل باعث میشد از شعر بودنش لذت ببرمکلا نمیدونم چرا توقعم از این کتاب انقدر بالا بود

خیلی جالب بود. ممنون از بزرگوارانی که معرفی کردن.شیوه ی کار تیم برتون توی فیلم هاش رو میشه "فانتزی سیاه" نامید. یعنی ایده های فانتزی ای که همراه با وحشت و مرگ هستن. این فانتزی ابداً برای بچه ها نیست. انیمیشن های معروف برتون توی این حال و هوا، کابوس پیش از کریسمس و عروس مرده هستش.فضای این کتاب، تلفیقی از فانتزی سیاه تیم برتون و طنز شل سیلور استاینه: ترکیب طنز و وحشت.نتیجه خوب از آب دراومده. هر چند بعضیاشون میتونستن خیلی بهتر باشن.
Damn!!! This is so dark but funny so Tim BurtonIts a collection of very short stories about very strange beings. There are no happy endings at all. You see all of those likeable people ( or matchsticks or whatever ) and you think, aww its sad what happened with them, i bet things will be good in the end.........NO.Im not proud but i laughed with the most of the stories, is it something wrong with me? should i be worried?Read this book, i don't know why or how but it will cheer you up
مدتيه كه متوجه شده ام خواهر زاده ي پنج ساله ام به كتاب علاقه داره و هر وقت كه يك كتاب كودك پر از عكس براش مي خرم، قبل از اينكه ببينمش خودم كتاب رو خيلي سريع مي خونم.بعضي وقت ها به خودم ميگم دنيارو چه ديدي شايد يك روز عضو گودريدز بشه و مثلا توي ريويوي اين كتاب بنويسه:"يادش بخير وقتي پنج سالم بود داييم اين كتاب رو برام خريد" و باد به غبغب بندازه كه از بچگي تيم برتون مي خونده
خیلی خوب بود, خیلیداستان-شعر های این کتاب دقیقا توی همون فضای انیمیشن عروس مرده یا کابوس قبل از کریسمس بودنداگر طرفدار کارهای تیم برتون هستید حتما بخونیدش اینم تصویر بعضی از شخصیتهای این کتاب:)
Llevo unos días sin ganas de leer y como hoy me he levantado contenta, he decidido coger este libro de la estaría y leérmelo.
La verdad es que me apetecía una lectura amena y en inglés (hace ya mucho tiempo que no leo nada en inglés).Es un libro lleno de historias bastante cortas y extrañas.
También me han gustado mucho robot boy (dios, es que con esta he flipado), Roy, the toxic boy y mummy boy.Creo que si os gusta Tim Burton merece la pena leer este libro.Le doy 3 estrellas.
I love Tim Burton's movies for their beautiful cinematography and sense of macabre with a pinch of dark humor.
His poetry is right up my alley, just like the stories of Edward Gorey (who is known to have influenced Burton).
Creo que no es ninguna novedad que Tim Burton es una de mis personas favoritas en la vida.
Este libro es una recopilación de poemas al estilo Gorey (que, notablemente, es una de las grandes fuentes de inspiración del director) donde nos encontraremos con muchas criaturas incomprendidas, abandonadas a su suerte, olvidadas por la vida.
Creo que es un libro que todo fan de Tim debe leer, realmente lo disfrutarán mucho, es un pedacito de él grabado en cada página.
Excelente! Toda a gente devia ler :p super super super divertido. Só queria que durasse bem mais!
However, the stories are wonderful and funny and entertaining to read and the illustrations just make this book a wonderful one to add to your collection.Although this looks like a children's book in design (verse + pictures usually = kids book) it's certainly got some more disturbing characters and the stories are all somewhat tragic and chaotic.
I wouldn't, therefore, recommend this as a book to give to or read to kids, but I would say that the ironic beauty of these stories is certainly worth a go and I loved reading through this book.I also feel like this book has great re-readability to it and I have no doubt that I will pick this up again someday to re-read and re-experience these sad little tales.
The melancholy death of the oyster boy was the creepiest one for me I think. Very short, very weird. Tim Burton I think has such a vast imagination which I thoroughly enjoy Although I’m not sure if he’s trying to tell us all that having a child to save a relationship will be the ruin of you? Interesting
“Son, are you happy?
I don't mean to pry,but do you dream of Heaven?Have you ever wanted to die?”4.5 stars because honestly it's just plain creepy and I want more!As a Tim Burton fan myself, I never heard of this until my cousin, who's probably the BIGGEST Tim Burton fan ever (she wears black and she collects EVERYTHING Tim Burton and I'm rather jealous lol) showed me the book one day when I was visiting.
It's the most wondrous and bizarre read I could ever have the pleasure of experiencing.
I picked this up on a whim and am glad I did! This short collection of stories told in verse is (as you'd expect from Tim Burton) funny, twisted, horrifying, macabre and somehow also rather poignant. The illustrations are marvellous too. Personal fave, The Pincushion Queen:Life isn't easyfor the Pin Cushion Queen.When she sits on her thronepins push through her spleen.
شعر-داستانهای بسیار خلاقانه و تصویرگری فوق العاده و دوست داشتنی،از اونهایی که هر شخصیتش برام زنده میشدند.این کتاب رو دلم میخواد برای تمام بچههای دنیا بخونم،حتی اگه بترسند و شب کابوس ببینند:دی

Tim Burton, The Melancholy Death of Oyster Boy and Other Stories (Morrow, 1997)Someone needs to explain this to me and fast, `cause I don't get it: how is it that bad poetry (and yes, folks, this is truly bad) and art that looks like a second-rate Edward Gorey ripoff (Burton is not the illustrator that he is the sculptor and animator) can be so insanely funny?
Which is not to say they're bad; they just look like Edward Gorey work.
