🖤🐾🐺
Rough at times with so many characters and everyone eager to put their two bits about Al'Thor but this story has two events that I was looking forward to since book 5. Not a great addition but not bad either.
To make a long story short, this part is painful to read.To be completely fair, that first quarter of the book I mentioned also contained a prolog which was relatively short by the series' standards.
The end of the book is up there with Dumai's Wells from book 6; it moves the overall plot forward by a long stretch and really make big power shift, especially among the Forsaken.As I mentioned Mat's parts really save this book from 2 star rating; Rand's grand finale gives it at least very strong 3 stars.
As to 4 stars, it really depends on whether you think the excitement of Rand's part overcomes Perrin's non-stop brooding.
I DID IT I DID IT I DID IT WOOOOOOOOOO
Winter's Heart gets three stars since it's the weakest Wheel of Time book I've read so far, alongside The Path of Daggers.
On the other hand, it is quite a lot better than several books I've rated four stars.The problem with this one is one you probably know about.
Still, I absodamnlutely love this world, this writing and (some of) these characters.I don't think there is any more for me to say.
This is book #9 after all.Wheel of Time reviews:#1 
The Eye of the World
The Path of Daggers
Winter's Heart
I read some reviews saying it was slow and nothing really happened until the last several chapters.
This is a book of thousands small details, each connecting with each other and the thousands of others from the beginning of the series to the end...
Trust the author - this one has never disappointed me before:-)I know this was a non-review, but the whole point is, give this magical, whimsical and smart story a chance, if you are a fan of Traditional Fantasy, Epic or High - it is a MUST READ!!!
HAPPY READING, Y'ALL!!!
I assume his library was full of self-created encyclopedias featuring nothing but random tid bits from this world he created.This was probably my least favorite book of the series though because there isn’t much action, but there is a whole lot of minutia that if this was my 2nd or 3rd read through the series I would probably appreciate it more but as is I really wanted more meat to the story and plot lines.Best parts of this book for me some of it might be mild spoilers….you’ve been warned✧ - Elayne and Avienda becoming first sisters.
This was another Wheel of Time instalment that passed with very little advancement in the majority of the ongoing story arcs.
I think I'm just so sucked into the story by this point that I'm happy and entertained by the happenings even when the characters are doing little more than chit chatting with each other.
Nynaeve: She was mostly a secondary character in Rand's tale but I did think she continued to improve as a character and she got involved in a bit of the action towards the end.
Elayne finally got separated from Nynaeve in this book but responded by firmly latching onto Aviendha.
This series aint for for the fainthearted in the page count department.
Also, with close to a 1000 pages a book there is a lot of meandering and only a little sprinting.
Actual count is 11916 pages.
This book alone mentions 602 character names.
Moving on.Even though this is a BIG book, there were only a few major things that happened in this one.
As I mentioned twice already, this is book nine and reviews are a bit hectic in such a big series.
In retrospect this should have been on the top of this list as Mat freaking disappeared for an ENTIRE book.
I thought this was excellently inserted especially towards the end and really added a feeling of danger to the story so I anticipate more of this as the story goes forward.Overall the climax of this book was really exciting and I have to say it was not far from a 5* rating, I think that this is a slow volume in places but the events which take place within are all important and certainly make me wonder about what will happen as I enter the last few books in the series.
Buddy read with the Dragon Sworn over at BB&BNine books in and this series is still going strong. There are just no words to describe this experience so I'll just say this: if you like high fantasy you MUST read The Wheel of Time.
I had to force myself to get through several of the chapters namely those involving Elayne/Nynaeve.
Unfortunately those 30 pages of action was not enough for me to raise my rating.The following sums up my major issues with this book and contains some spoilers.
Great start Elayne.Nynaeve getting upset at the seafolk for not listening when that is exactly what she and Egwene did while they were Novices.Men bashingElayne constantly calling Rand stupid and blaming everything on him.
That isn't what I've seen so far.Bonding of RandRand spends the entire series saying how he will not be put on a leash.
It's a whole problematical circle of problems, and ouroboroses eating their tails and such (a fitting image since the Wheel of Time is basically an ouroboros sailing some sort of invisible ship).Let's go through the checklist for Winter's Heart:*An inability to write women characters that betrays Jordan's sexist notion that women and men seem to be different species of human: CHECK.
*Rand as some sort of weird hero/anti-hero jerkface with a harem of women who fall over themselves with love for him, for some unknown reason I cannot fathom, because he is a jerk: CHECK CHECK CHECK.I think what makes me the most frustrated about this whole situation ↑ is that underneath all of that nonsense is the bones of a compelling story.
Executive Summary: Much like some of the other "middle books" of this series, I enjoyed it more on my reread than I did the first time. That said, it's still one of the weaker books of the series.Audiobook: Another fantastic job by Kate Reading and Micheal Kramer. I suspect part of the reason why I enjoyed this more the second time was that I was listening to it instead of reading it, and they make it so much better. Full Review After nearly 1.5 books, Mat returns! There is also a bunch of borin

And the ending nearly makes up for all the slow stuff at the start.
I think that's definitely another benefit my reread had over the first time too.I was really worried this series wouldn't hold up to my memory of it, but so far it's been as good or better than I remember.
"The Wheel of Time turns, and Ages come and pass, leaving memories that beccome legend. Legend fades to myth and even myth is long forgotten when the Age that gave it birth returns again.What was, what will be, and what is, may yet fall under the Shadow."I think this book is much better than 'The Path of Daggers'.Alhamdulillah, I am really enjoyed this book a lot.I do understand why the readers who don't enjoy this book.
Vorrei essere in grado di gestire una storia come Robert Jordan.
I think I've just invested so much time and effort into reading this massive series that I'm determined to stick it out to the bitter end and I just have to know how things turn out for all of the characters.A big highlight of this book for me was Mat's reappearance, especially since Tylin wasn't around much (if you've read my previous reviews you'll already know exactly how much I HATE her!).
I'm not even going to get started on the Aes Sedai and now the Sea Folk, it seems to me that women who access the power all turn into crazed megalomaniacs who would swear the sky is green and the grass is blue just to get one up on each other.
I'm Rand Al'Thor and I'm in love with three different women.
In a good story, I would have to make a hard choice, lose two women I loved and possibly gain one devoted lover/wife/confidant.
In a move straight out of Love Hina, I refuse to make a decision and am rewarded by not one, but all three beautiful yet exotically different women desperate to bear my children.The only instance I can think of where more than one woman is nice for any length of time to a man in the entire WoT series occurs in this book.A good plot thread would have been if Rand had made no decision and then been punished by all three women saying "the hell with this." Way more believable, and also more consistent considering that all the women in this series are horrible man-hating serpents.
Being disappointed, crushed at wondering where the hell the series was going.
Also, I have a bit of trouble believing when Rand and Elayne engage in such political struggles and then say crap such as "Moiraine/Thom has taught me well".
All the POV characters might as well just have an internal monologue the whole damn book because that is as affecting the story as much as the ability of speech, communication.
Some chapters have as much progress as ex: "Ch1, the character walked from here to here.
Because we have characters wondering shit like "The seachan are a people".
You can never know everything, and part of what you know is always wrong. Perhaps even the most important part. A portion of wisdom lies in knowing that. A portion of courage lies in going on anyway
Another great book.Στην καρδιά του χειμώνα η ιστορία μας έχει ήδη πάρει μία άσχημη τροπή καθώς ο λύκος περνάει τις δυσκολότερες στιγμές του, την ώρα που οι υπόλοιποι πρωταγωνιστές είναι βυθισμένοι στην αβεβαιότητα, έχοντας πολύ σημαντικά πράγματα να κάνουν, χωρίς να είναι σίγουροι αν οι ικανότητές τους επαρκούν για να σηκώσουν τα βάρη που έχουν στους ώμους τους.
Για αυτή του την υπομονή ο συγγραφέας θα τον ανταμείψει με ένα σύντομο συναρπαστικό τέλος.Οπότε μπορεί αυτό το βιβλίο να είναι μέσα σε αυτά για τα οποία παραπονούνται πολλοί αναγνώστες, για εμένα, όμως, είναι άλλο ένα σημαντικό μέρος αυτής της επικής σειράς και η τρίτη μου επίσκεψη σε αυτό το επιβεβαιώνει ακόμα περισσότερο καθώς καταλαβαίνω πόσα πολλά προσφέρει σε αυτήν.
That said this book interests me enough to like it for the most part.The novel has some very apparent negatives such as the (again) plodding pace and introduction of plot points/characters which serve little purpose in this section of story.
The other positives are again apparent: the magical ideas, the likeable main characters and the world-building.If you intend to read this series I'd recommend it if you are a fantasy fan.
Still, The Wheel of Time is one of those series that I love because of what it is: 'uncomplicated', Tolkienesque, epic fantasy full of imagination.
Book 9 in my long slow read of this epic series.
Slow because I only listen to the audio when I am walking my dog.
Long because these are very long books.
This one finished on a tremendous 5 star worthy high with Rand at last achieving something really worthwhile in a very exciting way.
However the book loses a full star for the awfulness of the tedious section about Perrin.
And you can't skim on an audio book!
Nevertheless book 10 is already on my Ipod and I start it tomorrow.
Not sure who is looking forward to it the most - me or my dog.
Hopefully not at the expense of Mat’s story.As I implied in my spoiler-free comments, I really loved the ending with Rand and Nynaeve cleansing (hopefully) Saidin and all the Forsaken converging on them with the Aes Sedai and Asha’man trying to protect them.
I’ve been waiting forever for a continuation of that storyline, and this is the first tiniest sliver of a hint I’ve seen since the events in book five.On the other hand, Osan’gar’s identity was revealed at the end, but I couldn’t connect the dots.
It had a lot of plot development, a new city, a lot of plot twists that had been in the process of setting up for several books, enjoyable side events, a lot of information on the Seanchan and an absolutely explosive (in a multitude of ways!) ending, I loved it.The pacing is meant to slow down again in Crossroads of Twilight, but if you've read The Path of Daggers chances are you're already invested enough in the series anyway, and you definitely won't be disappointed with Winter's Heart.
Knjiga realno za tri zvezdice. Elem posto je deo serijala te moram gledati siru sliku dao sam joj cetiri. Da ne bih spojlovao ostacu samo na oceni. To jest dodacu i to da Ovaj serijal treba da je upola kraci. Dzordan je voleo da pise i svaka mu cast na tome, to je zaista fino ali nekada je manje vise :)
4.5 stars really, because of the amazing ending.
The biggest sin committed by this book is that Mat's storyline is downright dull until its very last pages.
We get lots of Rand, and his story continues to be the most compelling by far; Elayne's political wrangling is entertaining enough, and I actually quite liked the section with the Sea Folk following Cadsuane around Far Madding.
(An aside, I do not understand the WOT-o-sphere's rabid hatred of Cadsuane...) Ultimately, yeah, I wish the rest of the book (hell, the rest of the series) had the same pacing as the finale, but this was a perfectly competent continuation of the series.
The last few books in Wheel of time series have been a test of patience for me, I have managed to endure these books as I am a part of below groups.Buddies Books and BaublesThe Not a Book Club ClubI have read the last two books sleeping half the time, and have managed to stay in touch with the books due to some awesome chapterwise summaries in both these groups.This book ends with a bang but most things which I remember from this book are1.Low neck lines2.Stripping the bottoms3.Folding arms under breasts.and this is just a major glimpse of what is the majotr part of this book.
The other drawbacks of this book are1.ForsakenThey are the worst villians in the series because intially they were fourteen in number, and at that time it was hard enough to separate one from other.The only foraken I am able to remember are Lanfear, Asmodean & Moghdien.
And I'm pleased to read books that don't seem to be easily converted to film (William Gibson and Neal Stephenson come to mind).To be honest, I doubt that "The Wheel of Time" will be converted for film.* The intrigues and internal conflicts that distinguish the early novels strike me as features that are too difficult to adapt.
However, when I read Winter's Heart, Book 9, I feel like its best parts are its most cinematic.What an opening -- Elayne and Aviendha attempt to unweave a gateway, Elayne loses control, and the gateway explodes.
