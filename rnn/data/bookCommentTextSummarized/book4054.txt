Read it over 40 years ago and I still love it!!!
This book is definitely better than Children at Willo Tree Farm.
It gets better as there is some conflict here but nowhere near the drama of the six cousins series.
Six Cousins is way more better than the last two books in the Farm series.
Again somehow I found disconnect is some aspects for example how Tammylan justifies the children's father's decision to kill the rabbits.
And this saving a horse with colic in the night has become a cliche in Enid Blyton series - happens in Six Cousins Again, in Third Term at Malory Towers and here again.
As the title implies, there are eve more adventures on Willow Farm! much to my delight when I picked it up as a child. Just as wrote in my other reviews, this series has influenced my life and I am truly grateful. Another delightful story line and happenings on the farm with still the same simple chores and day to day life, but beautiful and amazing at the same time. Absolutely loved it!
Not a bad book, just a little old fashioned. Kind of like the Brady Bunch on a farm. But as a good read for young children, it certainly checks out. The on-farm adventures are mildly exciting, innocent and usually have a basic moral for young readers.
There isn't an adventure in this one like most Enid Blyton's but a lovely description of life on a family farm in the early half of the 20th century but a lovely read, can't remember reading this as a child though.
