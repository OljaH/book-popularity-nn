My mother has owned a copy of this book since I was a child and every few years I pick it up to remind myself to run far from the rat race as soon as possible and live my life to it's full potential. If u are not a religious person but believe in the natural order of things moon cycles and being spiritually one with nature then you should read this book!!!! You'll be amazed at how dead on accurate it is about your life and personality!
Interesting complement to astrological readings and planning. The author who was the Imperator of the Rosicrucian Order, AMORC for many years is an amazing writer who writes with divine inspiration and immaculate insight. A VERY interesting read with practical application.
Terrific bookGives an insight of self Mastery through different ways that needs to be practiced to evaluate the effectiveness of these methods. Will write another review after these methods are put into practice on a later date.
It's interesting.
Really loved the Soul Cycle section.
Wonderful addition to any collection
