Mr. Graves's narrative of his three-week canoe trip down the river from Possum Kingdom dam to Barnard's Trading Post, with his 6-month-old dachshund as company, is filled with river lore and frontier stories, as well as with the people who lived there when he made his trip, before the De Cordova Bend Dam was built to impound Lake Granbury.
(The plans to build dams on the river was his rationale for the trip, his means of saying goodbye to the river he knew as a boy.) The book speaks to me, deep in my core, and I thoroughly enjoyed reading it.
It should still be on the list of those who like travel books with a relaxed, country feel, before the days that travelogues morphed into whole new beast.
He expresses his naturist ideals in a way that would appeal to the traditionalist, not in a forceful fashion.A quote on the cover compares the author to Thoreau, and I think it has some merit.
Of course, it's been a long time since I read Thoreau.
Overall, it's an enjoyable book, much more so for someone who knows the area he travels through.
But it's a great book overall for those who like travelogues and think about the world around them.
I remember swinging into the brown water from a rope with my friends in my teenage summers, I even got my first kiss along the bank of the Brazos.
If you feel this history, and you want to know more about it and the characters made by the river, this book is the place to start.Graves knew the Brazos, and he knew its personal secrets like an old friend.
This is where Graves grew up, and his recollections of the 'cedar people' and his boyhood friends are just wonderful!
i get that the pace of this book is supposed to be "slow and winding, like the river" or whatever, but it was just...hard to get into.
it gets weirdly repetitive at times, which (i think) makes the stories blur together, and not in a "deep, metaphor-rich commentary on history" way.
i really thought i would enjoy it more since i usually love solo-wilderness-adventure stories.
that said, i liked the imagery, and he has a cute little puppy traveling with him, so maybe this is closer to a 3.25(bonus: since it's so repetitive and...uh...vaguely historical, you don't have to read the whole thing to get the gist of it)
I would give it 4.5 stars if permitted. Some of the best landscape description I have ever read. Interesting history about the 1860's/1870's, Comanches, the hard-scrabble people who lived in Texas, written by a philosopher/theologian/naturalist. The arc of the book is a three-week canoe trip down the Brazos River before a string of dams were built.
I'd give it 3 1/2 stars if it allowed me to. His prose about the Texas landscape is beautiful, and I enjoyed the many stories he collected from the people he encountered along his journey. The book paces slowly, and perhaps rightfully so to expound on how a journey like that causes one to slow down and absorb the atmosphere around you. The slow pacing made his story difficult to stay with sometimes, but I enjoyed the time I spent within the page of this book.
This book is more like an epic poem of Texas than a memoir or essay or novel.
It is about a trip down the Brazos river, yes, but it treats the folks that have dotted the plains and hills of Central Texas much as it treats the river itself.John Graves writes beautifully, in a prose influenced but never overwhelmed by Ernest Hemingway.
He also hankers to tell stories about the extinct Comanche tribe - "The People" - that raided much of the land round the Brazos, for a century.Though at times the story is tedious, in the end you wouldn't want the book any shorter than it is.Highly recommended reading for any Texan or anyone wishing to visit Lone Star State or someday become a Texan himself.
John Graves journalistic piece is now regarded as a seminal work of American Conservationism. The book is a narrative of his three week canoe trip down a segment of the Brazos river in Texas in the late 1950's before a dam project would deluge his childhood stomping grounds. It is an excellent travelogue and meditation on the river and changing times and values.Further information and a map of the route can be seen on www.davidbogosian.com as well as links to his Texas Landscape books coauthored with photogrpaher Wyman Meinzer.
A true story of John Graves who with his pup Dachshund, "the passenger" canoed the Brazo's river in the 1950's. He calls it a Farewell as soon after a series of dams were built on the river. John Graves winds & weaves stories of Native American's, Texas pioneers, flora, fauna & his own life as he heads down the river. The stories flow as naturally as the river he travels. This book is keeper and one that I will re-read.
I read this ages ago and loved it. It was the only book that made me wish I was a man, so I could have the same kind of journey. Mr. Graves just passed away. He was a great Texas writer.
A beautiful homage to a seemingly insignificant piece of country but one rich with history and wildlife.
I'm new to Graves' work but I can see why he has had a following, and as a new migrant to the Fort Worth area, I'm glad to have the opportunity to experience some of the wild terrain that still exists along some sections of the Brazos.
He writes with a passionate curiosity about old legends of historical note, battles between natives and ranchers, or drunken family disputes.
But above all he writes in appreciation of each yard of the river that he rambles down in his canoe.

This book, about a last journey down a section of the Brazos soon to be dammed in the late 1950s, should replace every copy of Walden on high school shelves in America. The tone is beautifully rich, and the descriptions almost timeless. Here is a man who, like Cornelius Suttree, has overriding wish: freedom, to do what he wants, and explore the world on his terms. Graves' prose has striking spiritual and textual similarities with James Agee, John Steinbeck, Wallace Steger, and Cormac McCarthy off the top of my head -- good company, a statement about the quality here.
This book has been on my to-read list for more than a decade. Not sure why it took me so long to read it, but it was not what I expected given the “press” about the book, namely that it was written in response to plans to build reservoirs up and along the Brazos. I was expecting a diatribe; instead, this book is beautifully subtle, more about the inevitability of change, how people forget the past as one generation blindly takes the torch from the one before it. The book is part Tom Sawyer, part Jack Kerouac, and all Texas.
A pleasantly detailed story of a man revisiting a part of his life he might never have another to chance. I felt like I was on the journey with him, maybe as a grand niece listening to his mind wander with the stories of how he grew up. Such details and alliterations, I could hear and feel the cold nights and smell the campfires; stories has he remembered them being passed down, generation after generation. The book was narrated by Henry Strozier. I commend him on his welcoming and kind voice.
This was not a fast read because of the detailed old timey conversations and tales of The People and the settlers in the Brazos River area. I read a reference to this book in the new book God Save Texas and become interested in reading this book written in the late 1950s. If you are interested in Texas history and you picnicked and swam in the Brazos when you were a kid you will find it thought provoking.
Written in the late 50s, this travelogue serves up clearly the historical and cultural mix that made West Texas the way it was – and which still marks the way it is (and thinks of itself) today. It’s also beautifully written, both in the turns of phrase and a structure that meanders from tale to history to detailed descriptions of the river and its banks.
BooksGraves keeps the reader hooked with hints of stories to come e.g “First taste of beer on the river with 2 rancher’s daughters” or “the feud between the Truitts and the Mitchell’s” or in a history lesson set on a stage further down river, or whether he is actually through with “the people”; only to disclose to the reader that we may be of “the people,lost” either by fact or want.
Good, but I don't know why I couldn't finish it. I was really enjoying the simple story and the beautiful language. I had picked it up at the library and was having a hard time finding days to read, so maybe that was it. If I ever pick it up again, I will do a better review.
What a great book. I would give this six stars if possible, or maybe just the Lone Star.
i like river books and this is good one.
Had high hopes, as I usually like narratives like this from this time period. This one felt a little too repetitive and heavy on stories that had been told before.
A stream of philosophy, history, and natural wonder flowing like the Brazos. Texas classic.
Day’s absorbent busy-ness is past, and the dishes are stacked dirty, and you are confronted with yourself and confronted too with whether or not you like being where you are, by yourself.""Some days load themselves with questions whose answers have died, and maybe never mattered hugely""Nothing that happened in [Texas history], then or later, made any notable dent in human history.
That is all meant much was doubtful, and that I’d ever understand a half of what it did mean was more doubtful still, but the effort seemed worthwhile.""The rosy preindustrial time is past when the humanism of a man like Thoreau (was it humanism?) could still theorize in terms of natural harmony.
A gorgeous book and a must for all who love the Earth and language; especially for those who love Texas
He tells the stories of old settlers and in some places encounters folks whose roots to the river go back into the nineteenth century, at a time when the river was really wild.The book flows as slow as deep water, allowing the reader to savor the stories.
â€œCalvinistic fundamentalism and its joined opposite, violent wallowing in sin settled that part of the world and have flourished there since like bacteria in the yolk of an egg.â€ A little later he notes that itâ€™s a good thing there are a â€œfew Mexican Catholics aroundâ€ for they â€œdull the spines of the Baptist prickly pear.â€ Even the pious were not above the feuds as he tells the story of a Methodist Episcopal Church-South preacher named Jim Truitt, whose testimony helping convict a man.
Hale turned his blog over to his wife Babette for a formal eulogy the day after Graves' death, and it was Babette's piece that pulled me into tracking down "Goodbye to a River" from a Texas friend at work, who loaned me his signed copy:http://blog.chron.com/leonhale/2013/08/goodbye-to-a-voice/Here's an excellent obit story on Graves from the Fort-Worth Star-Telegram.
"Goodbye to a River" remains in print and is worth tracking down by any means necessary.http://www.star-telegram.com/2013/07/31/5044584/john-graves-author-of-goodbye.html?rh=1A sample of "Goodbye to a River," wherein Graves pulls ashore to meet McKee, an old farmer acquaintance, only to find him missing and to greet the man's wife:"...
Graves grew up paddling/hunting/camping along the Brazos River in Texas.
He was an adult by the 1950s when there were plans in place to dam the river he loved as a child.
He decided to take a canoe trip along the river to say goodbye to the places he knew.
His musings are a combination of direct naturalist observations with some insights about environmentalism way ahead of his time, remembrances from his childhood exploring the river, and historical accounts of people who had lived in these places before him.
I would say that this is the best natural history of Texas book I read this year, except I read The Voice of the Coyote this August.
Never-the-less, this is a book I loved and will reread at some point.
Written by one of Texas's great authors, this book is the tale of John Graves writing about a three week canoe trip down the Brazos River before its possibly imminent demise from damns proposed in the 1950's.
I read Hard Scrabble a few years back, and now I plan to read all I can from this great story-teller.
To quote my dad (who I loaned the book to immediately upon finishing it), "There are passages which stretch the limits of art."I started this book at the beginning of an extremely stressful 5-month period (not by coincidence, the same length of a school semester).
Hell, I'd like to take a whole college course on this book (and I don't doubt that exists somewhere).I'm already looking forward to re-reading it and attempting to savor it again properly (this time during an extended stretch of days in a hammock, or in a chair before a fireplace).
