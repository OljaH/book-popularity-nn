I opened this book on my Kobo and finished it with way too much time to spare before check-in, and that's factoring in my painful battle with sleep; I nearly had to pinion my eyes open and don't even bother telling me I should have set an alarm on my phone because my data cut off somewhere over Iceland and Schiphol's wifi is timed.
My phone is a fucking quitter.What I got through the veil of my bleary eyes was a so-so after school special with a nasty sexist undertone and a foolishly easy ending that completely undermines the entire point of the book.
It is my second read of this book.
And this book is about getting through that and also about friendship and finding new ones.
This book kind of amazing for me.
I think Russel, being the one telling the story has a way of getting sympathy.
There was a scene in the book where Kevin kind of said that he like boys who takes risk and Russel want to do that, for Kevin.
Here are the lines I love from this book:"If there was no such thing as forgiveness, there wouldn't be any friendships left in the world."This from Russel.
Some reviews accuse this book of being preachy, and although I agree in part I think "Geography Club" is one of the best stories in the YA GLBT genre - the kids swear, do horrible things, aren't perfect, and think about sex!
Honestly, some books make them so neutered it's hard to take them seriously.
Life isn't like that for everybody, but there is enough of a positive message in there that any gay teen will still close the book feeling optimistic.
I wish books like this had been around when I was in high school!
“Even the ugliest place in the world can be wonderful if you’re there with good friends—just like the most fabulous destination on earth is pretty boring when you’re all alone.”This was an okay read.
I've been wanting to read this for a long time but I've tried to keep my expectations low.
I've read some great LGBTQ books so far and they set the bar pretty high.So the protagonist, Russel, was plain.
It was frustrating.If you want to read this book and expect life tips on how it is to be gay, this will definitely let you down.
Audible I'm glad that I've chosen an audio edition. I don't really know, how an author makes a decision, who will narrate his/her book, but if Brent Hartinger HAD to make this decision by himself - he made the right one. My first Josh Hurley as a narrator, and he is a perfect choice for this sweet, funny and enlightening YA novel about friendship, finding yourself, about first love, and...coming out. It was better than watching a movie - I lived inside the story!Very enjoyable 5 hours!
5 STARS!! I don’t read a lot of Young Adult, but something about the description and the book cover intrigued me. It reminded me of some of the TV shows I used to watch in my younger years... Freaks and Geeks, My So Called Life, etc. And I was not disappointed, I love love loved this book! Told entirely from Russel Middlebrook’s POV, this story is full of humor, wit and important life lessons. I can’t wait to read the rest of this series!!
whatever, i'm still allowed to read YA, get off my back, jeez
Esse livro tem quase todos os clichês de high school e isso não me impediu de amar a história.É um leitura super rápida (o audiobook tem umas 6hrs), e muito divertida!
O plot tem um climinha gostoso de sessão da tarde, a narrativa é divertida e eu amei os personagens.Esse livro foi publicado em 2003.
Há 13 anos não existia a quantidade de YA LGBT que temos hoje, e dentro desse contexto, acho que Geography Club é uma história incrível, apesar de super simples.Russel Middlebrook foium protagonista que cometeu uma série de cagadas ao longo da história, mas eu adorei a maneira como o autor fez ele crescer, se desenvolver e aprender com os próprios erros.
La típica historia de instituto americano con sus dramas de popularidad mezclado con personajes que no se animan a salir del clóset. No es la gran genialidad ni aporta nada nuevo pero vaya que sirve para entretener bastante y drenar lecturas pesadas.
It's filled with two-dimensional characters and very special lessons.
It's better than most YA, which isn't saying much.
I'd recommend this for middle school students, but with all the talk about who's having sex, and who isn't having sex, I don't think they'd care.
If you're looking for something to bump of your book list, this is a quick read.
Sexist Closeted JocksFavorite Characters: Min, Brian, and RusselRating: 2.25 stars.
It kind of reminds me of a Matt Christopher book, but with gay kids.
Despite that, it's much better than Totally Joe and The Vast Fields of Ordinary.
It got so that I was expecting a quiz at the end of each chapter: "True or False: It is wrong to make fun of others for being different."I liked the writing.
I was going to give Hartinger another chance, but from what I'm reading on Amazon, Hartinger's moralizing is a recurring problem, so I think this is it for me and him.Two stars -- read this book if you like your gay people to stay in the closet, or if you don't understand why it's not OK to make fun of people for being different.
Substantially better than Totally Joe. Geography Club follows the life of several teens at a medium/large high school who discover that they're not the only gay kids in school.
Rather than tempting fate and public outing they start a gay kids club under the most unappealing club title they could possibly think of: The Geography Club.
Obviously one thing leads to another, and some people hook up, lie to their friends, fake being straight, do terrible things to other kids to fit in, and rise and fall in popularity.I read this book in three hours, and it was completely engrossing.
It was so cute and I could actually feel progression during the story, and I also really liked the writing, so that helped.I'm not saying this book has many insightful moments, but it was so much fun reading it.
Also, it's really short, so it's a pretty easy read.
I just think that as long you like this kind of stuff (you can look in the genres for yourselves because I don't remember and I hate defining stuff), it's a pretty decent book.
Well, very decent book.
This book is very interesting and I really enjoy it so much.I didn't know this book is SERIES!!!!! >,<SAID WHATTT???? I didn't know that this book is into the movie. BUT.....I like this book best than movie because movie is OK!
Geography Club is a young adult book that doesn’t feature a gay utopia but instead depicts a realistic high school with students that aren’t especially noble or inspiring.
These are the types of teenagers that exist in every high school, struggling to get through the minefield of social acceptance and rejection with the added pressure of being different.
In an already hazardous social climate of high school, being gay may be too much to deal with.GC is incredibly quick to read and fast paced so the story whips along and ends almost before you know it.
It tells the story about a closeted young male teenager who believes he is the only gay person in his smallish high school until he meets an anonymous teen in a chat room.
The book has some excellent humor to it and I liked how realistic and interesting the characters were.
One of the other main things I appreciated about this book was how it combined a coming of age story about peer pressure and climbing the high school social ladder with a coming out story about trying to stay true to your sexuality and your morals.
There's no way that could be true-- especially when he finds out that the kid with the handle GayTeen is none other than Kevin Land, star of the baseball team, one of the most popular guys in school.
So along with a few others, including Gunnar, who is straight, and Brian Bund, the loser of Goodkind High School, the boys form The Geography Club.
As events at school heat up, with Brian eventually being outed as gay even though he's not, Russel, Kevin, and their friends will have to learn what's most important in life.
Ladies and gentlemen, brace yourselves - This book is actual proof that no matter how badly written a book is, it will be made into a movie if the message is strong enough!16 year old Russell is one of the smart intellectual.
No one has any hobbies, Russell's own hobby seems to be lying in his bed at night, thinking about the fact that he is gay.
Everyone acts as if they are 11 years old, especially Gunnar, who constantly talks about how much he wants a girlfriend.
My main problem with Brent Hartinger as an author is that his writing always feels like an episode of Zoey 101 or Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide but with more gay.
Now, I loved those shows and I think it would actually be cool to have gay characters in them but that doesn't make Brent Hartinger good.
A few pages after Belinda's introduction she becomes one of the most funny and endearing characters in the book and I never really liked Ike and he didn't get any worse.
Well, besides Russel continuing to go out on double dates with Trish, even though he and Kevin had become boyfriends at that point.
He confesses that he is gay to a friend, who states that he already had knowlege of this because of the fact that he liked Disney musicals.
Should my (nonexistant) gaydar be going off every time I see a guy with a liking for Disney and a fashion sense?
Russel goes out on continuous double dates with a friend who hooks him up with Trish, both before and after he gets Kevin as a boyfriend.
I enjoyed this book quite a lot, made me rethink some of high school and what mindset a lot of the kids had.Kind of sad really how stongly we want to be popular then and how little it really matters in the now.Seems like too much work for me now!:)
I chose Hartinger's "The Geography Club" purely as a self-indulgent piece of reading, and I was pleasantly surprised with the content.
I thoroughly enjoyed the conversational rhetoric that could only be accurately replicated by someone who lived during the beginnings of the new millennium.
There were a lot of references to life in the early 2000s: the fact that they used a chat room to initiate the entire plot was oddly endearing.
The novel's age adds to its light, nostalgic charm.
Coming from someone in 2015, I'm excited to see internalised homophobia slowly becoming a concept as dated as using AOL.

After a number of grown-up books leading to a slight degree of melancholy, almost depression, I decided I needed a gay teen in my life.
Rights issues, would be my guess.)Selfs vir 'n ouer leser is Hartinger se verhaal oor Russel Middlebrook genietbaar.
Hoewel die verhaal redelik eenvoudig is, is dit nooit oorvereenvoudig nie: die emosies en optrede van die karakters bly oortuigend en lewensgetrou.
Ek sal beslis die res van die reeks (nog drie boeke) wil lees, hoewel ek hoop dat hulle (anders as die eerste boek) wel as e-boeke beskikbaar is.(Opdatering: hulle is, sowel as die drie boeke van die opvolgreeks en die eerste boek van 'n reeks oor 'n karakter in Russel se lewe.
do yourself a favour and don’t bother with this one 🆘🆘🆘🆘🆘
Sure, Geography Club is not really about the romance, even if there is a teen romance in it, it’s more about the growth of all the characters, but it’s not a dramatic story, on the contrary, it has even a somewhat light and happy mood, like the reader is able to see that everything will be find for Russel and his friends.Russel is a gay kid; for a kid living in a small town he is pretty smart, and even if he has never had any sexual experience, he lives his being gay in the net, attending chats where he is able to talk with other boys his same age and with his same trouble.
(a book about a homeless kid), by the same author, written in the same voice.Maybe it’s been a while since I read Kate DiCamillo, but I feel like this book would have been MG if not for the references to drinking and sex— not that young kids don’t know about these things, or aren’t exposed to them, and honestly, we should be honest with them about these things.Also, another reviewer pointed out that this is a very sanitized and simplistic look at bullying and being gay.
Why do authors leave skin-color so ambiguous?The only thing this book had going for it was a few clever quips, and a sometimes allegorical view of high school.
Russel doesn't suck at sport, but neither is he that good, he's not the best looking guy in school, but neither is he a dork, pretty clever but not brainy, his biggest problem is the locker room and all those naked jocks.
Russel is not Mr. Average in one way—he's the only gay kid in school.
He's only ever confessed his inclinations to himself, not even his two best friends Min and Gunnar know.
Through Russel's dry voice, we discover the strata of school society, the yin and yang of hierarchy and clique, the yearning to belong and not be an outsider; the love of true friends.
Having learned my lesson with the Twilight Saga, where I first saw the movies that later destroyed the whole Saga for me, I maturally decided to read the book first.I FINISHED IT IN A DAY!!!
And a great compliment to the book.Brent Hartinger writes an in depth first novel that leaves me on my toes for the next ones (and I saw that we get more Russel, yay!!!)This is not a romance novel.
I was so much into the book, that I didn't even mind the end.
Kevin and Russel were just the right person/wrong time...
Geography Club is a story of an isolated gay kid who never thought that there were any other gays in his town besides him, but he was wrong.
Kevin, whom Russel had no idea that he was secretly gay, was a popular kid in high school.
I also enjoyed the sub-plot and sub-characters as well, such as Min and Brian.
She is such a great friend to Russel no matter how dicked he acts.
So is Brian, who gets bullied by nearly everyone in school, but he still has a great and caring perspective.
It touched me when Brian forgave Russel for what He regretfully and shamefully did to him.
Hartinger's story has a lot of depth to it about realistic things people have to go through every day concerning relationships and friendships, high school, dealing with things that at the time are incredibly difficult but in the end being able to come out of them stronger than before, and accepting one's self for who they are.Overall I really liked it and am glad to have read it.
Thankfully I can say it's not a personal thing so much as a lot of the issues and realities in the story are things people around me have had to be dealing with personally right now.
He has a crush on Kevin, the captain of the baseball team, but Kevin and his buddies are constantly making fun of him and Kevin must strive to keep his cover by playing along with the groups gay-oriented insults.Things start to change once Russel discovers that he’s not the only gay kid at his high school.
He starts the Geography Club: "a club so boring that no one in their right mind would want to join" and place where he and his gay friends can feel like part of a group, come clean, talk, and support eachother.
(plus I tend to round up)I liked it.
I also like how thinhs/relationships were different once exposed to the light of day.
Mig's relationship) that is so often the case.
Things feel good and fun when kept a secret but when the secret is known suddenly there is too much pressure and things fall apart.
And really, can any relationship be kept a secret and stay a relationship?
I am glad it ended the way it did.
For any other ending to be written would have seemed unrealistic and trite.
This wa well written and I an glad for the everyone of digesting mr.

As most high school books are but this book was real.
It wasn't just about being gay -- which is how it'd started, it was about friendship, and misunderstandings and that kid in school you see getting bullied but you don't do anything b/c you don't wanna be bullied.
There are so many smart jokes in this book that I just died laughing.
“Why can’t there be just one place for gay kids, where we don’t have to hide who we are?
That’s a laugh!”  Also, I just LOVED Gunnar for the total dork that he was.
The best thing about this book for me was the charm and wit of the protagonist, Russell. But, being decades away from the coming out process, there was really nothing new for me. This would be a good book for adolescents struggling with their sexual identity. There are better ones out there. The book is appropriate for inclusion in school libraries.
A nice -safe- vanilla milkshake kind of YA. A bit on the plain-side..but still palatable..sort of hard to f'up a vanilla milkshake. I didn't catch the opportunity to climb inside any of the characters and so that felt a bit cafeteria-food inspired for me..when reading.
The main character of this YA title is a decent, likable fellow, but he's quite humanly flawed; which is perhaps what makes him as appealing as he is.
Despite the focus on sexuality and the sex it leads to, bullying at its most cruel, and broken hearts abounding, this novel has an innocence to it.
I have to say, though, it helped me to remember how very painful the teenage years can be, for those gay and straight.
It's clear also, however, as depicted through these characters, that many gay teens in the 21st.
should break our hearts.
I like reading YA but I usually go for more adult YA type of reading.
This book is  true   YA.
I really enjoyed reading it.
There was bullying and homophobia which are things that I usually don't like to read about because they upset me too much.
However, there was also a lightness in the reading.
Maybe because of the pacing?
There were also funny moments.
The only thing I wished is that he had not forgiven Gunnar so easily.
He needed to do some groveling for my liking.
Again, great YA book.
Can't wait to read more books by this author.
Selten hat mich ein Ende so zufrieden und selig zurückgelassen. <3
And there's absolutely no sex on page (only hinted at fooling around in fade to black scenes).
Which I am absolutely reading.This is the kind of story that all teenagers, of every gender & sexual orientation, should read...and it's times like this I wish I had gone into education because I'd freaking MAKE THEM by including it on a mandatory reading list.(27Aug2017: Slight rating change to make room for another YA title that I am already loving more...and since there's no option of 6 Stars, I had to slide this one down the scale a little without changing the star rating.)
Along with his best friend Min, he and other gay teens form the Geography Club; a safe place where no one knows that they're gay and that they can talk and feel safe but not every secret stays a secret.
Russel navigating through a high school full of minefields where his secret could be discovered is hard as well as dealing with his feelings about Kevin who reciprocates but isn't ready to let his secret be known lest he loses his social standing.
Every young gay teen should read this book and know that they are not alone.
Achei, em especial, o Gunnar um personagem muito autêntico e que fez a trama se desenrolar com mais clichês que o habitual mas com muita fluidez, sem ficar chato.
Apesar de eu saber, no fundo, que toda novela americana tem um personagem como ele, o mocinho que sempre faz o que é para ser feito no final.
(apesar de que, para Russel, os quesitos popularidade-Kevin Land-homossexualidade eram mais importantes)Talvez por isso, ou por qualquer outro motivo, o Geography Club acabou virando uma serie - e eu juro que comprei, e li, sem saber disso!
[Resenha completa em: http://www.marcadocomletras.com/2013/...]ps.: O filme não faz jus ao livro.
I would have liked more character development - sure we got a good representation of our main character Russel Middlebrook since he is the narrator, but many of the supporting players left a lot to be desired.
The parts with Russel and his love interest occur way later in the novel (vs the film had it in the beginning and had more emotionally intimate scenes) and leave you hanging for more detail.
I wanted the story to delve deeper into the budding romance of these two but it only went so far.I recommend the film version as well as there are many significant differences between that and the novel.
All the archetypes are there for compelling characters, the classic high school clique drama, and the exciting flair of a slightly controversial topic for people to rally behind (in this case, underdog queer kids and their allies).
As someone within the queer community, I read this book mostly because it's geared toward youths and it has an LGBTQ+ agenda.
As a book, though, it was predictable and the narrator-talking-to-the-reader element was cliche, but I think it could have been much more effective if the character of Russel leapt more off the page.
