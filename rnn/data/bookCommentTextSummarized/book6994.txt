I can't decide who enjoyed it more Evie (my daughter!) or me! I LOVES these books as a child and look forward to reading them to death... Again, with Evie :)
Kalo punya anak kecil, jangan kasih baca buku yang satu ini dhee..Amelia Jane is annoying, at least for me she's annoying with all her naughtiness, uugghhh..Really can't stand her!!
So funny what a bad doll haha
Read this to the children at school. They absolutely love these stories.
One of my first favourite books from one of my first favourite authors.i have read this to my children who also love Enid Blyton.timeless books
-just read a few stories-
Revisiting the books of my youth out of a feeling of nostalgia! I loved Enid Blyton when I was younger and can't wait to re-read these with my own children.
This book was very good, just like the previous book in the series. It wasn't exactly mischievous, but more curiosity behaviour. The first couple of times Amelia Jane is naughty, but the next she just gets too full of curiosity for her own good.Very good book, but I have to say, not as good Enid's first one in the series.
I don't remember a lot about this one, beyond the fact that I definitely read it as a kid.
this is a very good book. i love it so much.
one of my childhood favorites
super buper
FUNNY... such a big bad doll..
The first English novel I read when I was in grade 3 and it's just magnificent and funny. I'll thank Patricia for suggesting this book for me. I love it.
