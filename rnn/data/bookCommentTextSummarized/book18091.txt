Oh my god.Oh my god.Oh mylanta!I swear to all that is holy, that cliffhanger gave me heartburn, anxiety, and a massive case of the eye ticks. How the hell am I supposed to keep sane until OCTOBER?

Broken Prince in a nutshell.But if you are curious about spoilers and what happened with Reed, I'll take pity on you...(view spoiler)[ You sure you want to know?
5 stars   These Royals will ruin you… The saying is TRUE! These Royals will ruin you and I have been Royally Ruined, my friends. I’ve been trying to write this review for about 2-3 weeks now and every time I start it I can’t get past being ruined. After I finished Paper Princess earlier this year, I had the biggest book hangover ever. That cliffhanger about killed me and I was dying to see what happened. When Broken Prince showed up on my kindle, I couldn’t wait to read it. I had to know what ha
After book one, it was pretty obvious that Reed screwed up everything.
Things between Reed and Ella are pretty messed up.
With Ella gone, tension is at an all time high between the Royal brood.
Just know it takes a few wild and crazy turns and many things I didn’t expect to see happening did.
Reed Royal.
The first book, I didn’t know what to think about Reed.
I loved Reed.
You will love Reed Royal.
They are by far the most addictive books I have read in a long time.
This is by far one of the best series I’ve read this year.
All I can say is....Hahahahahahahahahahahahaha...Oh le giggle.
This book continues the soap opera that is this series, although with a little less...magnetism than book one possessed.
Everything about this book is geared to make us lose our soap operatic shit and do the old:Followed by the classic:With a side of this:Now, while a part of me finds all this fabricated drama silly.
And fucking hilarious, quite frankly.
I am at heart but a small child......and thus endlessly fascinated by shiny objects.
And train wrecks.
Can't forget the train wrecks....So, of COURSE I will will checking out the catastrophe that I'm sure book three with prove to be.
“My instincts had screamed at me that she was trouble. My instincts were wrong. She wasn't trouble. I was. Still am.Reed the destroyer.”  These Royals have ruined me.  “I thought, I'll just keep after him. Eventually I'll wear him down, convince him we're a beautiful fairy tale. But we're not. We’re nothing. We're smoke - insubstantial and meaningless … We aren’t even a tragedy. We’re less than nothing.”   Broken Prince is a sick fairytale. It's the story of a broken boy who met a broken girl,
“My instincts had screamed at me that she was trouble.
It's the story of a broken boy who met a broken girl, fell in love with her and then crashed her.
It was a tad dark, and the dirty secrets of the royally messed-up family that were revealed shocked and hurt me, but they made me understand better why these boys were so lost and dealt with their pain and abandonment issues using sex, alcohol and drugs.
Yes I did find some incidents extravagant and questioned my sanity for loving characters whose issues would make any therapist rich beyond imagination, but the thing is, I became attached to them.
I feel for my friends that had to live with that anxious anticipation for long.Picking up where 'Paper Princess' left off, Ella is on the run.
As angry as everyone is with him, it could never compare to the anger he feels toward himself.In comparison to the first book, 'Broken Prince' is told primarily from Reed's POV.
After everything he did in the first book, I needed validation of his feelings.While 'Paper Princess' highlighted the unity of the Royal brothers, 'Broken Prince' spotlights their decline.
His betrayal is not something that she's willing to easily forgive or forget.Like the first book, 'Broken Prince' ends with another huge cliffhanger.
Actual rating: 1.5 Buddy read with Sarah. We were planning to have a massive buddy read with humor and all, but ended up angry and tired of this book.MAJOR SPOILERS ALERTBut we’re we’re not. We’re nothing. We’re smoke—insubstantial and meaningless.We aren’t even a tragedy. We’re less than nothing.”Let me present to you: Orphan Stripper, Douche and Creepy Dad Volume two. Ta-dam.

We’re less than nothing.”Let me present to you: Orphan Stripper, Douche and Creepy Dad Volume two.
Creepy Girlfriend wants a ring on her finger or she'll tell the world she was screwing both Royal Douches.
After sticking fingers for a while (and probably breaching Orphan Stripper's brain with them), suddenly Ella the Stripper has a brilliant idea to give her inheritance to Creepy Girlfriend so she could get out of their lives for good (I still can't understand why give her money?).
Here, I have some bonus scenes for you: The older Royal Douche brother was banging Ella the Stripper's Creepy Stepmother.

Paper Princess is already one of my favorite books of 2016 and I am so happy that Broken Prince was just as amazing, it lived up to all of my expectations and more.
Never a dull moment in the life of a Royal.There are some characters in this book, I really hope they get what’s coming to them in Twisted Palace.That ending???There were some plot points I had guess at timidly, but I didn’t see that ending coming at all.
I inhaled this book!If you thought Paper Princess was amazing, you're going to be blown away by Broken Prince!
I can't even begin to explain all the awesome in this book.First of all welcome back to Astor, land of the Rich and elite members of society.
But I digress, because the most important and my favourite Royal...ahem by that I mean Reed Royal, is going to steal your heart and blow your mind.
This is on another level of book crack, addictive, emotional roller coaster level of goodness.Broken Prince, surpassed Paper Princess.
My instincts had screamed at me that she was trouble.
LIVE LIVE LIVE AMAZON http://amzn.to/2acK0Is5 BRILLIANT STARSOmg what I just read???
SERIOUSLY I haven't read a book before like this!The story is original and many things happening in this one!!!I have to calm down first and then write a little bit more about the story.But I don't want to give anything!!Love these boys they have stole my heart!!And Ella one of the best heroine I have ever read about!!All of them make the story unique!And the ending...wow omg I want the next book now!!I'm super excited for the next book!!!
*An advance reading copy was generously provided to me in exchange for an honest review.*
The ending got me like Seriously. Imagine yourself reading the last bit of a book, right before the ending. Out of nowhere, someone comes up to you and SMACKS YOU ACROSS THE FACE. Pow. Right in the kisser.Then that person says, "Oh. I'm sorry. Did that hurt?", reaches in as if comfort you, then SMACKS YOU ACROSS THE OTHER SIDE OF YOUR FACE.That is approximately how it feels to read through the end of Broken Prince.I'll say this in favor of the authors though - they sure know how to make a reader reach for the next volume.
"He told me to stay away.He told me I didn't belong.If only I'd listened to him."  5 Stars!I've been warned, but I didn't listen and now I'm royally ruined and in dire need of the third book. Hats off to these amazing authors Elle Kennedy and Jen Frederick A.K.A.

Hats off to these amazing authors Elle Kennedy and Jen Frederick A.K.A. Erin Watt for this brilliant sequel!I cannot properly formulate a thought, but this sequel was done in a very classy fashion and I absolutely loved it!Broken Prince begins when Reed Royal searched for Ella Harper after she left the Royal mansion.
Meanwhile, Ella's love-hate feelings toward Reed and her growing affection to the Royal family also confused her.
In Paper Princess, Reed was so hesitant to fight for Ella and show her how he felt, but in this book, he gave it all.
Arghhh...This is NOT a review. This is me blowing off some steam, that is all.WHAT HAVE I DONE? Nobody forced me to do it. This is on me.I could have waited for the next installment.

I said I would wait.

WHY didn’t I wait?I know WHY.

So I’m just gonna wait over here.

The book was full of slut shaming, bullying and all over ridiculous characters who seemed to think in ridiculous ways.
(hide spoiler)]So much went on during this book that I was speechless at how completely ridiculous the characters were.
I hate girls like this and I personally would have stabbed her myself, (view spoiler)[if only she'd been the one who had been stabbed.
Nothing simple was enough for Ella in this soap opera book, she had to pull a girl by her out of the school and she had to do her best to like ignore Reed (as if she even tried).
I’m gonna lose my mind… GOD DAMMIT!
Ugh I swear a God, this series will give me a heart attack!!!Everything is so messed up!
'Cause Elle & Jen are an amazing story teller and I’m amazed by their humor too.
:)So people, please stop losing time and read this series asap!
But I guess I should’ve warn you ‘cause maybe it’s safe to wait all the 3 books come out.
But if you don’t wanna wait the last book and decide to read 1st & 2nd book, I’ll tell you this!
You’ll get hurt as much as I did because I’M DYING IN HERE!!!!
It's clichéd and unoriginal, the plot seems pointless at times, there's little to no character growth..
fucking...
And it's partly because, SOMEHOW, I care about the characters.
and makes up some !fucked up!
scenario and honestly, I have to give it up to Erin Watt.
If anybody came up to me and asked me how I felt about them, my answer would probably be along the lines of "I could not give three garbanzos whether these characters were ejected from this literary earth".
Nothing happened for most of the book, it was COMPLETELY unrealistic, almost pointless at times.
This book starts off right where Paper Princess left off, and I mean right off, so thank the Lord for not having to wait for explanation to that terrible cliffhanger, but Reed’s reaction was just so lame, I’m sorry.
So please use caution before going into this book.And most importantly: This series is NOT YA!
I know many of the relationships are toxic and problematic and I completely understand that they wouldn’t be the healthiest and/or most ideal of starts for people in real life, but I love steamy reads and I rate them purely off my enjoyment, yet this still got only two stars from me, because it became the equivalent to a soap opera in every way.
Paper Princess was so phenomenally great in that addictive, can't-put-this-book-down way that I was afraid that Broken Prince wouldn't be able to live up to the hype and greatness of its predecessor.  So wrong. In many ways, Broken Prince was better than Paper Princess. For one, it was told in dual POV.Yes! We get Reed's POV in this latest installment, and oh boy, getting inside that boy's head was deliciously insightful. I'm so happy Erin Watt gave us Reed in all his broken glory. I mean, this
Paper Princess was so phenomenally great in that addictive, can't-put-this-book-down way that I was afraid that Broken Prince wouldn't be able to live up to the hype and greatness of its predecessor.
In many ways, Broken Prince was better than Paper Princess.
I mean, this was titled Broken Prince after all, right?Reed's POV gave us a much needed explanation of the event that happened in book one.
But the biggest reason why I think you should read this book, is it answers some of the questions you and I have been asking after reading Paper Princess.
Title: Broken PrinceSeries: The Royals #2Author: Erin WattRelease date:  July 25, 2016Cliffhanger: Sweet baby Jesus...YesHEA(view spoiler)[Not yet (hide spoiler)]**References to events in Paper Princess are mentioned, so if you haven't read book one, you shouldn't read my review yet.**Enslaved.
I'm one of the poor fangirls who naively started Paper Princess with the hope for simply a YA that could grab my attention.
Her instincts are telling her that she never should have laid her heart on the line for the Royal boys.
These two authors have created characters that jump right off the pages and come to vivid life in front of my eyes.
I’ll try to make this my most organized review ever just because this book was so fucking good I didn’t know what to do with myself.Reed looks like a psycho here but I loved it.
I screamed so hard on that part I probably woke up the entire neighborhood.I’m still in shock, guys.I don’t want Ella to doubt of Reed in the next book because we had a lot of that in this book and I think we’re going to have a lot of drama and stuff going on to have also Ella dwell on Reed’s innocence.When Ella said they have to get rid of Brooke and Dinah, I really thought she was going to use the excuse of the baby shower to get close to Dinah and get in her house to look for the stuff she had on Gideon.
I knew Erin Watt would want my heart pumping and my nerves to be shattered, but I honestly did not see that ending coming.
This story gets better and better and while I was desperate to see the story play out, I was already dreading The Broken Prince’s journey coming to an end.
I loved seeing below the surface of the Royals and a few more truths come out that had my eyes popping.I can’t wait for Twisted Palace.To buy Broken Prince from Amazon - http://amzn.to/29YP7IeI’m an Aussie chick who loves to read and review romance, drink coffee, be a Style Setter and stalk David Gandy.
In my mind, there are different kinds of 'whipped'. There's the adorable, squeal-inducing kind then there's mushy, annoying, eyeroll-deserving kind. Sadly or more like predictably, Reed Royal in Broken Prince was the latter kind of 'whipped'.If you thought Paper Princess was over-the-top, you haven't seen nothing yet... /// I still cannot believe this series was being marketed as YA. What is the point of having 'demographic level/rating'? If you're not going to use it?? Yeah YA my ass. ///'Uninteresting'  is a more generous description for this book but 'a waste of time' is a more accurate one.
So this review will mainly consist of cursing, non-spoilery rants, reactions, and will depict my urge to simultaneously strangle and hug the authors for DOING THIS TO ME AGAIN.We’ll start with my reactions while reading Broken Prince:3% I FUCKINGGGGGG KNEWWWWWW ITTTTTTTT!!!!!!
WHY?I feel like Erin Watt has turned me into an FBI agent.
Pretty sure the citizens of China heard me screeching and screaming “I CALLED IT!!” when I hit the last page.
I feel like I'll never get enough of this crazy family and those delectable Royal boys.
I am once again anxiously counting down the days for the next release, Twisted Palace.Broken Prince is out July 25th!
*****5 Stars***** “These Royals will ruin you….” Wow! Stunning, intense, angst-filled and thrilling. Erin Watt has done it again with their second instalment of “The Royals” series “Broken Prince.” After reading “Paper Princess” I wasn’t sure how I was going to survive having to wait after that massive cliffy for the second one. It felt like years. My advice to anyone who has not delved into this series as of yet, is to perhaps wait until October when they’re all released and then binge read the

My advice to anyone who has not delved into this series as of yet, is to perhaps wait until October when they’re all released and then binge read them.“Broken Prince” starts off where “Paper Princess” finished and thankfully it is written in Reed’s point of view also, so we were given an opportunity to go inside his head and know what makes him tick.

There's no way I'm going to be able to suspend my disbelief enough to think that they can go around doing that.Also same thing with giving them too much freedom in a way that felt jarring and out of the realm of reality with regards to Callum sending off Daniel to military school, you can't do that to someone else's kid, give me a break.
Also the whole Dinah and Gideon story line why does that even exist, it felt so pointless, is something going to happen in the future with that.
THREE DRAMA AND MORE STARS. "She was mine and I was hers. I fought it too long, but I’m giving in now. I’m all in now." This author collaboration is successfully sweeping across the path of most of my fellow romance readers and there's not many that haven't loved what these authors have produced so far. 'Paper Princess' was a debut diamond that I was super eager to get my greedy reading hands on and as soon as I got my first 'Royal' fix I was ready for more. So it comes as no surprise that my ex
So it comes as no surprise that my expectations for book two were through the roof and although I wasn't completely blown away there was still plenty to enjoy about this second book in the series.
I'm very much a lone wolf with with my less than five star feelings, but as they say no two readers, read the same book.
I had huge expectations going into this story, book one ('The Paper Princess') had it all; angst, romance and plenty of over the top 'Royal' style drama, so to say I was excited to jump into book two would be a little bit of an understatement.
omg OMG! I thought the ending of the first book was a killer. But ‘Paper Princess’ has nothing on ‘Broken Prince’! This ending sets book three, ‘Twisted Palace’, up to be the most exciting so far in the series!I ended ‘Paper Princess’ with questions, oh, so many questions and when I finished ‘Broken Prince’ my head exploded. I screamed. I stared at my Kindle. I immediately took to FB messenger and began furiously messaging my friends who had finished before me asking if I had indeed read what I
This ending sets book three, ‘Twisted Palace’, up to be the most exciting so far in the series!I ended ‘Paper Princess’ with questions, oh, so many questions and when I finished ‘Broken Prince’ my head exploded.
The Mean Girls - Dinah and Brooke, made me experience cat scratch fever, wishing I had actual claws and they were actual people and not just characters in one of my favorite series.And ladies and gents (hey, there might be some reading this series too!) the wonderful and talented Erin Watt have given us a bad boy who rivals Easton - WADE.

“She’s mine and always has been.
From before we even met, she was mine and I was hers.
I fought it too long, but I’m giving in now.
I’m all in now.”
Holy f*cking shit.
This series and that book in particular is crazy.
It's crazy good, mysterious and so damn addictive.
Bravo to the authors, you have built a brilliant series here and I'm in awe.And yes, that's all I have.
Read the damn book and see for yourself!!!!!!**ARC very kindly provided by author in exchange for an honest review.BEFORE READING:Trying very hard to keep calm.
Now, I’m wishing for it to be Fall so we can get our questions answered.Seekers of fast paced, angst-filled reading need not look any further because the mothership has landed and it contains everything you’re looking for in this series!
"When did my life become such a soap opera?" ~EllaI'm going to go out on a limb and blame my own mom for my love of these angsty books.
*runs and hides* The Royals high school is nothing like High School Musical either … it’s a tad spicier than the Disney version of high school.
Either way, I like reading about it but it makes me thankful I'm no longer a teenager.
