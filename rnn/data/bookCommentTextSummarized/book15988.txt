Anderson’s 1999 novel Dune: House Atreides.Yoda: Enjoy it I did.Mace Windu: Yes, I felt that an exploration of the earlier generation was an excellent way to further develop the storyline.Ki-Adi-Mundi: Absolutely, Herbert and Anderson’s collaboration did not try to copy or imitate the narrative style of Frank Herbert, but rather to give life and a new voice to his earlier vision.Plo Koon: And sell some copy.Kit Fisto: You are cynical Master Koon.
Frank Herbert’s great vision was one in which his legion of fans longed to read and know more.Lyn: True Master Fisto.
Whereas Frank Herbert mostly restricted himself to writing about events occurring on the planet Dune, which was kind of the point of his books, these prequels take us to Ix and Caladan, to Kaitain and Giedi Prime and to the ships journeying through space.
These books were written to be read after the original Dune novels.
I would say that everyone would be better off reading all six originals before this, that everyone should read at least the first trilogy before this, and that everyone must read at least Dune itself before reading this.House Atreides does not have the magic of the three first Dune novels.
The entire "House" series is unreadable crap and an embarrassing exploitation of the author's father's name.

The Baron sees an opportunity for large profits and begins to store up illegal spice hoards.On the Imperial Capital planet Kaitain, the young planetologist Pardot Kynes has just arrived from his homeworld of Salusa Secundus for an audience with the Padishah Emperor Elrood Corrino IX.
Shaddam decides to poison his father in order to speed up his succession to the throne.Duke Paulus Atreides of the planet Caladan is planning on sending his young son and heir Leto to the court of Earl Dominic Vernius on Ix in order to study politics with the Earl's son Rhombur.
I felt so dirty after reading this "novel" that I felt compelled to re-read the entirety of the actual Dune series.
Thirdly, you can start of with a completely unexpected plot and through Herculean loose-end-tying make it mesh in an interesting way.This is why I really wish they'd just released Frank Herbert's "mysterious notes" instead of turning them into 50 gigantic phonebooks.
Notes are interesting, you can see the different directions an author is torn in as he fleshes out plot and characterization.
All the hero characters are so gosh-darned nice, while the antagonists are pretty one-dimensionally scheming.
But there are lots and lots of sympathetic antagonists, which are completely absent here.
Although it'll probably take me at least one more of these to be completely turned off.
Well after I finished Chapterhouse Dune, I was pretty sure I was done reading anymore Dune books, but I decided I would give Herbert's son and Anderson a chance to wow me with the their writing, imaginations and notes left behind from Frank Herbert.
As I read the books, I feel like the only thing that has changed is the director.
I am excited to continue reading through these novels....Also did you think it was even possible for Duncan Idaho to be even more awesome than he allready was?

I just wrote one of the best reviews ever, one that included a lot of self-degradation and covered a lot of science fiction nerd-dom and references to Roger Zelazny and shit and freaking Goodreads made it all disappear. Things like that make me want to vomit. There will be no recreating that colossal review.Suck this, Goodreads!I'm going to go put on my stillsuit and ride a sandworm while munching on some melange. I'm going to take down Goodreads now with my mind, Bene Gesserit style. If you don't get any of that, I can't help you.
-- Read the 1st one by Frank Herbert "Dune" if you like it...2.
Its 3 books written by Frank's son Brian and a author I really like by the name of Keven J.
-- Go and read the "House Trilogy" series its also 3 books and is a prequel to the original dune series but just prior so you will learn about some of the characters in the 1st book you read "Dune".
The authors of the prequel series (his son Bryan Herbert and Keven J.
Anderson) finished the series from compiled notes from Frank, Brian's experience talking to his father about the series and both Brian and Kevin's love of the Dune universe.
Like many sci fi lovers I read Frank Herbert's Dune--a book I loved for its richness and detail with all of the subcultures, traditions and intrigue centered on the spice--the eye-blue-ing, mind-altering and space-bending drug of drugs.
It seemed that sequels were not as compelling and when Herbert died, I assumed a grand story was finally done.
Each House has its own saga leading up to Dune and then, more in prequels to the prequels with three novels detailing the machines.
House Atreides was the first Dune novel other than the original that I really liked.
These are, of course, horrifically bad. I read them one Christmas break when I was stuck in a house in the middle of Missouri with nothing to do but read these or watch ER. Last time I forgot to take a book with me to that house!
For those that have read the originals, you get a good introduction to the history behind a lot of the key players in the original Dune.Despite this, Brian Herbert doesn't recreate the same world his father did.
Certain things feel a bit predictable where as his fathers work never had that feeling.
Perhaps it has partly to do with knowing that certain things can't happen or that would have violated the continuity of his fathers work, but even taking that into account it still had that feel.But those things aside, I would still recommend reading these books.
I had to put this down after the second or third chapter. It was too painful.The audio-book as read by Tim Curry, however, was somewhat curiously entertaining. Likely because Tim Curry could make a curiously entertaining reading of a telephone directory if he really wanted to. Come to think of it, that might be a more constructive expenditure of time and money.Frankly, I'd skip the entire "House" series entirely if I were you. I rather wish I had.
Jesus, what a drubbing of his father's legacy.
Very disappointing.
Given how many holes are already in Frank Herbert's Dune books, it's easy to see how this is an impossible task.
Take the bestselling SF novel of all time and cash in -- err, I mean write -- some prequels.Frank Herbert's writing is brilliant but definitely flawed.
But the mix of the two is, apparently to lots of readers, definitely tolerable.
Messing with that is asking for trouble, and that's what this book is.
The characters are even flatter and less believable than in the original set of books, and the directions taken by the plot are not that original.
The three characters that one would hope would have the most consequence, both from being original Herbertian characters, as well as figuring as protagonists on the buildup toward their birth rite novel, the Baron Vladimir Harkonnen, Duncan Idaho and Leto Atreides are all varieties of static.
This book does little if anything to set Leto up as the eventual martyred hero, though it should be noted that for this book Jessica hasn’t been born yet—the claim could be made that her influence changes him irrevocably…Yet, these three are still given far more development than any of the female characters.
I had found an equal to my already beloved Middle Earth and Star Wars universes.So when I picked up this book, the beginning of the House Trilogy, I was more than excited.
The events of the novel such as the fall of House Vernius, the Harkonnen plot to destroy Leto, and even the death of the Old Duke Paulus all seemed like flat attempts at the imaginative flair of Frank Herbert.
I picked this book up with interest in the mystique and flavor of the Great Houses of the universe, and found myself entwined in a novel of too many "main characters," of which none were treated with enough detail and development.
The original "Dune" series, the first book of which is a sci-fi classic, was written by Frank Herbert, who died in the 1980's.
But-- and this is a big thing for me if you've read any of my sci-fi related reviews-- whereas the original books induced wonder, the Dunequels explain mercilessly.I had no choice at the time-- I was in love with the House Atreides-House Harkonnen drama.
I would recommend just sticking to ones by Frank Herbert himself.PS The prequels are OK, but the Dunequels take a turn for the blasphemous when Brian wrote a "Dune 7" that follows the original series, tying it back in with apocraphal characters that Brian had introduced himself in his own prequels.
Dune is one of my all-time favorite books, and this is a great addition to the canon.
Readers also get their first glimpse of the tech planet of Ix which will play such an important role in the series later.We are also treated to the deliciously wicked Baron Harkonnen before he became so physically detestable.
The first line of the book is, "Lean and muscular, Baron Vladimir Harkonnen hunched forward..." What?!
Lean and muscular?
I am not a big sci-fi reader and I've never read any of the original Dune series, so I went into this somewhat skeptical.
It amazes me really that sci-fi writers going way out into the future harken back to medieval times for political structures - Kingships, emperors, familial rule by birthright, all that.
I would recommend, but only if you're willing to invest the time to read all 3 books in the series in succession.
And even then, the ending is a bit of an entree into the Dune book written by Herbert Sr.
I loved the original Dune novel by Frank Herbert.
I kinda thought I might be spoiling my affection for that novel by reading a prequel not written by the man who created the Dune universe.
So, this collaboration is clearly written in a different voice and tone than Frank Herbert.
There was a dark grittiness to the writing and story in the original Dune books.
Anderson and Brian Herbert's writing seems a bit more flat, even a bit more fast-paced if you will.
But all throughout I just felt like I was reading some very well put-together Dune fan fiction.
Brian just doesn't have the skills of his father, I was clearly disappointed with this novel in comparison to my love for his father's Dune Series!
This novel doesn't stray as far from the cannon as this triilogy will.
I am enjoying the backstory of Dune - one of my favorite series.
Watching the decline of the Baron has given me a perverse pleasure - The man that embodies everything horrible about house Harkonnen.
It will be interesting to read the next book and determine how a house that started from heroes of the Jihad has declined to such a cruel, perverse bunch of psychotics.
All the pieces had to fall into place just right for the Harkonnens to be successful.
I've always wondered about Duncan's backstory and how he became so close to the Atreides.
On to House Harkonnen....
Probably the better of the prequels.
But it's also clear that the authors did try to flesh out the Dune universe in a way that would satisfy Frank Herbert.
I get the sees that the House books were written more to provide backstory for the main characters in Frank Herbert's Dune than to tell its own unique story.
And, despite the title, this book isn't exclusively, or even primarily, about House Atreides but rather covers a range of Dune characters.That said, if you take the book as general backstory to Dune, it actually works somewhat well (small contradictions aside).
In Dune: House Atreides we finally see why Fenring is such an important player.
What can I say about "Dune: House Atreides"?
The characters are easily recognisable as the classic figures from the original story, and the events—while few and far between—conjure the predictable prelude to Frank Herbert's classic original.
There was a very good reason Frank Herbert started "Dune" at the brink of disaster.
It essentially revokes Frank Herbert's privilege to us, and attempts to reintroduce the original story via the obligatory "prequel trilogy".
They take place in a time tangential to Frank Herbert's novels, and while we know the "general" outcome of these events, the real pleasure is seeing how these legendary tales unfold.
