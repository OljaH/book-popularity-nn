I mean I might be physically over this book but I think I‚Äôm spiritually still pretty much in the thick of it.This was truly a wild ride, I've had actual heart palpitations in moments where I understood a line of foreshadowing so well that I had to put down the book, stand up and walk around the room saying ‚Äúshit shit shit shit‚Äù repeatedly until I was composed enough to go back.
Consider me shook. This was one heck of a finale. Was it perfect? Not necessarily, but I'm still feeling crazy over everything that just happened. I'm definitely gonna need to let this process, but I can honestly say impressed with how this story came to a close.
Maaaaaaan this was so good I‚Äôm so sad the series is over but wow it was a wild ride.
A fantastic finale to an exhilarating series! The shock-factor wasn't quite as intense as the previous books for me, but the action never ceases. My poor heart was put under so much stress throughout this book - I was so anxious about the fate of all of these characters. I'll need some time to recover, then I'll get to doing a full review.EDITRe-read the book on audio, and it was just as fantastic.Review copy provided by authors in exchange for an honest review.
4.5
All the stars fit this fantastic book!
‚ù§I wish this wasn't the end of the trilogy!
But I have to say this was my favorite of all three books!
The Audible versions of this trilogy is amazing!
There is a full cast and sound effects.
It makes me feel closer to the characters for sure.
I'm going to re/read all three books when my physical copy gets here.
Well, I'm going to try to this year.
I just don't want them to end so I want to re visit them back to back.

She didn‚Äôt feel quite as three-dimensional as the other girls did to me, but I think that was fully to pin on the fact that this book was non-stop action and suspense with very little time for a lot of character development.
There‚Äôs nothing that I can really tell you about AIDAN without offering up a million spoilers for this finale, so I‚Äôll just say that, if you love AIDAN even half as much as I do, I don‚Äôt think a single part of you will be disappointed by this book.
Here‚Äôs Illuminae AND Gemina AND Obsidio in one go:- ragtag group of space citizens is ruthlessly attacked by corporate greed- there are some teens there- the teens are funny and edgy and heterosexual- two of these unrelentingly straight teens should not be together, because they probably have been together previously or otherwise one has been sexually harassing the other (shoutout to Nik!)- they will be together though, and flirt a lot in order to cruelly detract from the book‚Äôs waning entertainment value- the teens must do CRAZY, ORIGINAL stuff, like crawl through ventilation ducts and brush with death- like wow guys seriously they are really close to dying!!
There are so many characters already in this series, and there was a clear end goal in sight with Gemina, yet Obsidio sort of steps away from that movement in order to: introduce 2 new lead characters and a handful of secondary characters; establish another romantic connection between the leads; revisit old favorites from the previous books in the series; move forward with the war and occupation of Kerenza plot, and various other subplots along the way.It all felt a bit much, especially during the first 200 or so pages, where all this new information was being established.
"You know better than any what I am. Every story needs a monster.And this story will end soon."  And so it ends. This series has come so far. Honestly, it reminds me of the Lunar Chronicles in that it began with two characters and keeps expanding to a larger scope. With excellent plot twists, fantastic characters, and some of the most unputdownable writing in the world, this basically killed me.Here, let me just rant a little about Them Iconic Characters:‚ûΩ  Kady Grant  - this bitch is so cool a
He‚Äôs such a Good though that I can‚Äôt help but care for his relationship with Kady [so much] and his relationship with Nik [their bro relationship was what I DESERVED].‚ûΩ 
- I thought Nik was an asshole in the last book, but the more I read about him the more I love him.
why didn‚Äôt Asha and Ella become a thing or some shit, we already KNOW her and we got NO SENSE of Rhys.
- Who gives a fuck.And also, let's give a spot for these babes:"McCALL, Winifred ****!!MALIKOVA, Ella: MIGHTY ****ING ********SMALIKOV, Nik: HOLY ****ING **** *** *****MASON, Ezra: ****ING HELL??ZHUANG, Yulin: ********!?!?GRANT, Isaac: People!
A Strong 4 Stars  "You know better than any what I am. Every story needs a monster.And this story will end soon"  Holy ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà This entire ending was a W H I R L W I N D of emotions for me, but overall such a satisfying conclusion. This book brilliantly uses its unique format, just like it's predecessors. It features all the characters we know and love, as well as several new faces. I'm struggling to form a cohesive review so let me just summarize everything awesome it contains:- Kady Grant and her
It's our third book with her and she's obviously been through hell, but she still slayys- Nik and Ezra being besties- Isaac Grant becoming the entire squad-dad because it's about time someone loved and supported these kids besides me- Plot twists like whoa- Ella Malikov brightening every single scene she was in by being the powerful force of nature we all love- A lot of morally-gray villains and complex side-characters- Including everyone's favorite tortured-soul computer program, AIDAN- Who is still tortured, engrossing, and slightly murderous.- Hanna's beautiful journal entries that perfectly capture her grief and determination - The introduction of Asha (my pharmacy-tech twin) and her every-man heroism - Rhy's perfectly coiffed hair Honestly, the only reason this book isn't 5-Stars is because I wasn't sold on the Kerenza IV plot.
I‚Äôm dead inside in the best possible way.
AIDAN is a majestic wonder of murder, poetry and sass, and I couldn‚Äôt help myself...I call this piece 'Waiting For Obsidio. Painfully.'
So ummm my funerals on TuesdayRTC
this series had so many obstacles to overcome in the realm of THINGS THAT KAREN DISLIKES READING ABOUT, it‚Äôs a ¬†‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà miracle that i liked it as much as i did.
and while i am frequently unenthusiastic about gimmicky books, the very sort of gimmicks responsible for speeding up the reading pace here, in this series, i‚Äôm fully on board.
i would read one million books about aidan.
winners of my heart.SO - either i am growing up and becoming a person of broader tastes and a greater tolerance for things which used to annoy me, or this series is good enough to transcend the ‚ñà‚ñà that ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà me off.

i love AIDAN
I CANNOT EXPLAIN HOW MUCH I LOVE AIDAN.This was the perfect finish to the trilogy!! The last few pages were amazingggg. I liked this story more than the second book but I think the first one's still my favorite. And I like all of the characters buuuuut let's be honest... AIDAN wins everything. There are very few "villains" I want to actually succeed, but he's definitely toward the top of that list.
that was one HELL of a conclusionit was good. had quite a few flaws, was boring in a LOT of places, and was uh pretty unrealistic... but what can I say books that ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà with my emotions and make me sweat are really enjoyable// buddy read with my love, who I buddy-read the whole series with!!!!!!
But like only by a sliver because I love ALL the books so much.) But Kady is so incredibly smart and unstoppable.
And I love Isaac Grant who like is here, in a hospital bed with a shot wound, and sees these bunch of raggedy clever ptsd-ridden smart-mouthed teens and goes, "OK YOU ARE ALL MY CHILDREN NOW STOP SWEARING AND HERE IS YOUR CURFEW." Bless Issac Grant.We also do get a new couple: Asha and Rhys.
I didn't love them that much tho, but I think that's because nOThIng lives up to Hanna and Nik ok.
Like I love him!
‚ÄúThat is all I know how to be. Every story needs it‚Äôs villain. And it‚Äôs hero. And it‚Äôs monster.‚Äù Story ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠êWhoa, guys. This book. Phew. This book was a freakin roller coaster. Did I have several heart attack‚Äôs? Probably. Did I fall in love with (all of the) relationships and characters in here? Absolutely. This whole trilogy is not perfect, no book really is. But it‚Äôs a start and I think I‚Äôm not wrong when I say, that it‚Äôs a masterpiece of storytelling, characters and creativity. If you ever n
But all in all it‚Äôs really an amazing story with great characters and a really really special style of book.
Hannah and Kady being the typical badass lady‚Äôs we all get to know and love and our sweet handsome boys, that are a big support for those ladies (and they have a big role too).
Ella being the typical strong and intelligent nerd she is and Isaac Grant showing us and all the dads out there how to be a proper, loving and awesome dad!
But I didn‚Äôt really feel love or something like that.

Hi, my name is Melanie, and I‚Äôm the only person in the book world that doesn‚Äôt love this series the same way everyone else does.
This is the most amazing artwork from MeganJeongArt!The story did keep me invested, and these books always feel so easy and fun to read.
I completely understood and enjoyed being introduced to Hannah, Nik, and Ella (The best person in the entire series, if we are REALLY being honest here) in Gemina, but I felt like adding two brand new characters (and their completely unnecessary romance) into Obsidio was such a poor choice.
SO GOOD
some books are born great, some achieve greatness, and some have greatness thrust upon them. this book, this series, is all of the above. my mind simply cannot comprehend what i just read because its greatness transcends human understanding. what a blessed world we live in where this kind of greatness exists for us mere mortals.  5 stars
im a magnified puddle of tears. you may think im joking, but i just sobbed over a 'parachute' sowhile the audiobook was amazing, reading the actual text was a whole different experience, i cannot deal RTC~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~you guys: ". . . may, dont you think it's kinda a little too early to be rereading this book??????"me: "that's actually a good po-"me:  Buddy read  with my baby bee, üêù
I mean as readers we read a lot of books in the usual format and a change can be good once ina while.
The romance is good too!üåü Now I am stingy when it comes to 5 stars ratings but I gave all the books in this series 5 stars because I was so damn happy while reading them, were they perfect?As much as I am ranting above about how much I enjoyed almost everything, and you know how critical I can be, I can so NO!
AIDAN was my favorite character in the series!
the only thing i like or even know about asha is that she‚Äôs not white and that‚Äôs only noticeable because every other character IS white sigh i also hate how this series has so many FORCED heterosexual romances it honestly makes me cringe it‚Äôs 2018 give us a gay...or just let boys and girls be friends????UPDATE 8/3/17: THEY REVEALED THE COVER AND IT'S BLACK AND GOLD!!!
It's so far away!!!WHAT COLOUR DO YOU THINK THIS BOOK WILL BE?!
Idk why but I'm thinking it might be purple‚Ä¶or maybe green???Either way I need the cover reveal NOW
today, december 10th, is the day i oficially finished the illuminae files trilogy twice over. best hourd i ever spent in my lifefirst thoughts:I DID IT. I FINISHED OBSIDIO. I FINISHED ONE OF MY FAVORITE TRILOGIES OF ALL TIME. AND IT WAS AMAZING, INCREDIBLE, MIND BLOWING PERFECTION. THIS ID EVERYTHING I WANTED IT TO BE6/5 stars bc I‚Äôm That Bitchcover reveal:THE COVER IS HERE HOLY SHIT ITS STUNNINGI mean, I'm sure it will look fine as hell in real life
