But Bokrug will not be mocked, and eventually doom comes to Sarnath too.If Dunsany had written this story, he would have emphasized the ancientness of Sarnath and hinted at destroyed cities and moribund gods even more ancient than Ib. It would be a prophet's tale, fortelling the death of another city built ten thousand years after Sarnath, and the prophet would also speak of the destruction of cities not yet built, the death of gods not yet imagined.
I can't believe I dog-paddled through that swamp of putridly purple description just for a final paragraph of madness born of horror unendurable. Howie, you tease, you're all build up and no delivery.This is the third of the Dreamlands story cycle.The White Ship <--previous | next --> The Cats of Ulthar
A tale of how humans wiped out an advanced race of reptilian humanoids.This is more for mood than story/plot. OVERALL GRADE: B minus.
3.5Ten thousand years ago in the land of Mnar there used to be a glorious city of Sarnath.
Before humans came the land of Mnar was the home of lake creatures, the beings of Ib.
'They worshipped a sea-green stone idol chiselled in the likeness of Bokrug, the great water-lizard; before which they danced horribly when the moon was gibbous.' When humans came they killed them all and destroyed their city of Ib. As a proof of their power they took their green idol to their city.
This one was awesome!!
It is one of the better stories from Lovecraft's Dream Cycle. It reads like a dark fairy tale and the foreshadowing of the deadly curse is played out rather nicely, so 4 stars.
As with many Lovecraft stories, this one is filled with passages of purple prose like these:"Of polished desert-quarried marble were its walls, ...""The houses of Sarnath were of glazed brick and chalcedony, each having its walled garden and crystal lakelet.""And in most of the palaces the floors were mosaics of beryl and lapis lazuli and sardonyx and carbuncle and other choice materials, so disposed that the beholder might fancy himself walking over beds of the rarest flowers."As this is the third Dream Cycle story, I'm going to go back to the beginning and follow the publication order from now on.
Zagrebačka nakladaZagreb, 2012.Preveo Toni GolubJezik je tipična lofrkatiština.Sadržajno govoreći tipično Lovecraftovo djelo, sjajan primjer sadržajne aktualizacije i toposa Cthulhu mitologije koja je razvijena radi čistog larpurlartizmu u vidu toga što je u potpunosti antimimetična.Mimetična umjetnost je bila i ostala pseudoumjetnost, realizam je najbolji primjer kako je mimetična umjetnost ništa drugo doli sredstvo propagande, bila ona komunistička, feministička ili jednostavno libtardska.
Lovecraft je bio istinski fantazof, i u tom pogledu istinski umjetnik, iako je djelovao uglavnom unutar žanrovske domene.
Fantazofija (antimimetičnost, larpurlartizam, visoki esteticizam- skovah ja taj termin) je najveća spona rane moderne s romantizmom.Lovecraftov Cthulhu mitos je druga spona Lovecraftova opusa s romantizmom.
To je taj intuitivni osjećaj da polako Kali Yuga prelazi u Satya Yuga.
A fun and flowery read about the rise and fall of the doomed ancient city of Sarnath.
(The Bible-like descriptions of Sarnath itself are beautiful, the names evocative, but this is the kind of fantasy building I've been doing myself as long as I can remember, so I guess it seems like a childish way to build a story, to me.
Completely non-creepy, as (view spoiler)[I was totally cheering for the fish people from the word go (hide spoiler)].) Kind of enjoyed this one.(Moved 2015 review to the individual work Sept.
2017 to make room to review the collection under its own entry.
Another story that I remember rather vividly)
I couldn't get past the overly descriptive middle section of this story. Lovecraft has a way with engulfing a person into his enchantment. However, I think it was a bit overdone. While the Sarnath vividness was relished towards the end, perhaps it could have been been better composed? To be blunt, it got boring. It's obvious one is not supposed to know what are the geographical details of "Mnar", or "Ib"; or the personal stories of the great warriors, and many kings and nobles. But the information-attack was overwhelming at times; and it distracted from the fanciful story.
Another fantasy tale from Lovecraft. This one deals with revenge and curses. He loves to make descendants pay for the crimes of their ancestors which is pretty messed up. Apart from that though I'm just not a fantasy guy, and it's hard to get into it.
A morality tale and a vivid description of the land of Mnar and Sarnath, but not really that scary at all. The description of the city was neat, at least. More of a myth than a 'Lovecraftian" horror.
A simple story of human eradication of another species, because they are other, the slow build of magnificent empire, and then their destruction by those they thought they had wiped out. Flowery language, and a very fairy-tale feeling in the opulence of the city.
A little bit of HP Lovecraft in October is always a good idea ;)This was next on my pile of Lovecraft.
I honestly feel like this was only an intro to more.
Lots of backstory for such a short one.
This really felt like it needed more.
The creatures were creepy.
I felt bad for them.
People can suck and sorry...but KARMA!
Don't be killing things that really did nothing to you but look weird.
This wasn't spooky especially if you are like me and wanted the settlers to be punished for being evil.
Humans or these creatures?
Mmmm the humans for sure.
80% of this story is basically a tour of Sarnath itself, an ancient city which is admittedly awesome, barring the tragic and despicable thing its people did to the beings of Ib early in their history.
Of actual story there is very little, so I didn't much care for it: HP gets too carried away with the setting itself.That setting IS vivid and amazing, though, so I can't rate it lower than 3 stars.
I would say A Princess of Mars by Burroughs is a much better example of how to establish a cool setting AND tell a story at the same time.
На березі озера у древньому місті Іб жили зелені потвори. Потім перші люди прийшли сюди і заснували поруч місто Сарнат. Люди почали ненавидіти потвор, дивуючусь, як ці примітивні істоти мали нахабність дожити до цивілізованих часів. І врешті-решт люди винищили всіх жителів міста Іб. Після цього Сарнат досяг небачених вершин, отримавши контроль над всім краєм Мнар. І кожного року сарнатці святкували перемогу над зеленими потворами і проклинали їхнього ящіркоподібного бога. Але у тисячну річницю перемоги фатум спіткав місто Сарнат.
I love everything Lovecraftian. Although I have a few collections of his works. This one stands out, having north of 35 tales. Each one better than the last. The print is quite large, the binding is stunning the paper quality surprisingly elegant for such a large collection, and a great price if you get it from Amazon. "Cthulhu still lives, too, I suppose, again in that chasm of stone which has shielded him since the sun was young"
It's certainly an interesting short story with Lovecraft's signature vivid descriptions. However, most of the story is just descriptions of Sarnath and the ancient city of Ib. The plot itself is probably a cautionary tale, and I quite enjoyed it, but too much time is spent on describing a city, especially for how short the story is already.
Although I've been to the real Sarnath, which has nothing in common with this story, I absolutely love Lovecraft's world building and dreamlike dark fantasy. Read it for the the mood it sets, suspend disbelief, and have no other expectations; then it grips your attention from the beginning to the end.
Absolutely stunning work from Lovecraft. Arguably the best I have read so far. The way he builds the story and the descriptions are amazing.
Again a myth without any plot where the author only describes a faraway exotic landscape. Not the best of Lovecraft, just an additional painting to his long portfolio
This story really drags in the middle with its descriptions of how awesome the town is, but the payoff is decent. These dudes sound like real assholes and got what was coming to them.
How many times do I need to read that the stone and metal were unknown?
7/10
Meh. I was expecting better.
90% description 10% horror. Not worth it
My Rating System:* couldn't finish, ** wouldn't recommend, *** would recommend, **** would read again, ***** have read again.
It was fine, some of the description was a bit lengthy and repetitive for my liking but yeah, sure, whatever.
A lot of my affection for this story comes because I ran a Delta Green scenario based on it, where the descendants of king Nargis-Hei had fled to the waking world to avoid the wrath of Bokrug, the detestable water lizard, and that seed turned into a long scenario.
The eternal garden no matter the outside has always been one of my favorite images of decadence, like the Harkonnen's greenhouse in Dune, and while here it's mostly supposed to show how much luxury the Sarnathi lived in, the impression I get from it is mostly about how the people of Sarnath's wealth was built on that of the dead beings of Ib, who they murdered entirely merely because of their appearance.
