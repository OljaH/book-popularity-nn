They say write the book you would want to read. Well... that's what I did. I hope everyone enjoys reading it as much as I enjoyed writing it! Update: The print book releases in the U.S. on 2/26/13! And in the UK on 3/28/13!
I actually really liked Losing It! It was a fun, exciting and romantic read! Read it in a few hours!
I WANTED TO LIKE IT!Do I get points for that? ;) Here’s the thing.It was waaaahaaaay to predictable. Holy Moses, man! And I get that the cute and sweet books, for the most part, ARE predictable. But uhh… I knew what was goin’ to go down from the get go! I mean, it’s about a twenty-two year old virgin who really wants to lose her V-Card, so what does she do?She just goes to a bar with her friend to find some random guy to lose it with. Nice.  Lo and behold, the random guy she DOES find turns out

Lo and behold, the random guy she DOES find turns out to be not just random guy… but wait for it...
But there are two reasons I should warn you of why this review might be prone to even less objectivity than usual:1) I recently read a book about a teacher/student relationship that was excellent - Unteachable - and it was hard not to compare the two.2) I am British.Let's start with the second.
I'm not sure how much I would have liked it anyway if the attraction of the book's love interest hadn't been built up around the sexiness of his accent and his - ohmigosh, so cute!
But the real question is:Would you like this book?
Seriously HOT!When I look at the cover, I see: IntensityPassionLustDeliciously SinfulHeatForbidden RomanceThen I read the blurb, and was like, OH HELL YES!
So I didn't judge too much from the cover.......but I got none of that.There is no need to describe the story, the blurb takes care of it completely for me.I'm neither here nor there with this one.
What I expected was what I described when I looked at the cover and read the blurb.
But when it was said, I just didn't feel it and it surely wasn't needed, in my opinion.Bliss, the heroine, is suppose to be this awkward 21 year old virgin in college.
I absolutely loved this book. One of the few reads that have made me laugh out loud. And the steamy scenes? Yep. They were hot. But it was so much more than that. My new favorite book of the year.
Είναι ανάγκη να μας φουσκώνεις κι άλλο την ιστορία βάζοντας όλον τον κόσμο να την πέφτει στην χαμηλοβλεπούσα (γκουχ γκουχ) πρωταγωνίστρια; Της την πέφτει ο καθηγητής, για την ακρίβεια την κυνηγάει ο καθηγητής και αυτή του κάνει τη δύσκολη (κάπου εδώ χτυπάμε το κεφάλι μας στον τοίχο), της την πέφτει ο μπάρμαν, της την πέφτει ο σερβιτόρος και της κλείνει το μάτι μπροστά στον καθηγητή που έχει κολλήσει επάνω της λες και είναι έτοιμοι να το κάνουν!
Της την πέφτει ένας άσχετος στο μπαρ μόλις που πάτησε το πόδι της, την ξανά κερνάει μέρες μετά ο μπάρμαν που φυσικά θυμάται το όνομά της που άκουσε τυχαία από τη φίλης της, της την πέφτει ένας συμφοιτητής και τη φιλάει μπροστά στον καθηγητή την ώρα της πρόβας!
This is my opinion, so don't go "It wasnt really that same" or "You are so WHATEVER"How i feel about the story (view spoiler)[ It is true this book is a fun read, but lack of potential.
And it ends abruptly (hide spoiler)] The characters relationship (view spoiler)[ I want Bliss to choose Cade, because i like Cade.
Because when we read more and see their reactions and it changed our opinion (hide spoiler)]Characters Garrick Taylor I'm not going to tell you a lot about him.
A friend of mine likes to know the ending before reading the book, so yea.

Stop! Cats! Stop...  Losing it had me pretty much losing my mind through fits of giggles--courtesy of Bliss and her quirky inner dialogue!  I must admit that I headed into this book with some reservation due to the mixed reviews it had initially been receiving. However, I was pleasantly surprised to find that I very much enjoyed this book. Bliss, a character whom I won't likely forget, had a comical energy about her that snagged my attention immediately. I loved being inside her head and hearin
I must admit that I headed into this book with some reservation due to the mixed reviews it had initially been receiving.
As humorous as Bliss was, the very hot and very British professor gave her a run for her money.
I really adored the writing; it was fun, fresh, and hilarious.
The sexual tension was piled on thick and I was pretty awed by this author's ability to vividly map out a steamy scene.
▪ Romance: Charming, tension-filled, and flirty.▪	 Characters: Sexy, sweet, British hero.
Adorably hilarious heroine.
▪	 Plot: Filled with humor and sexual tension.
▪ Writing: Fun, fresh, witty, and engaging.
Probably more like 3.5 stars. This was awkward as hell, but really cute! This is pretty much how I picture Bliss: It wasn’t until I’d walked halfway across the parking lot that I realized: 1. I wasn’t wearing shoes. A. Or a shirt. 2. I didn’t bring my keys A. Or anything really. 3. I’d just left a complete stranger in my apartment. A. Naked.Whoever said one-night stands were supposed to be simple with no strings attached had clearly never met the disaster that was me. Bliss (which is such a cute
It wasn’t until I’d walked halfway across the parking lot that I realized: 1.
All of Bliss's friends were likable and I loved reading about their outings with each other.There were a few things that were just kind of left up in the air, but it's nothing I'll lose sleep over, so I will forgive and forget.Plus, there is a cute cat named Hamlet, if a book has a cat as a side character, I'm almost guaranteed to like it.I had no one, but Hamlet.
I think you will find the characters funny and engaging, even if you don't like the plot.
In fact, I immediately went back to reread a couple parts as soon as I was done last night, at like 3 am, and then again this morning.
I like that he was so normal and had to do a little "I'm Sorry" in the end.
I loved how she was so open about her virginity in the end and they kind of embraced it.
Garrick was such a gentleman.And the ending\epilogue was so good.This is a New Adult\Adult book for sure, but even though the sex was descriptive, it wasn't crude.
But it didn't, so Thank you, Cora!And after he decided he wanted Bliss no matter what could happen, he was constant and really great with her.
A confident man is a sexy man, if you ask me.What I didn't like about the book is really a short list and on top of the tiny list is Kelsey, Bliss' best friend.I'm not judging they way she is or how she fools around but how she was so ready to open Bliss' legs in the bar for the first cute guy to show.
And I get that Bliss was the one wanting to lose her virginity but with a friend like Kelsey?
So one day, a book was written....It had a boy, with a British accent mind you:It had a girl:They were in "love" AND have been through  "VERY DIFFICULT SITUATIONS" a tragedy, really.They taught the world an important message through their "problems"So I am just here like...This book bored me to death, but I didn't give up. I stayed strong, I am strong.
When Bliss’s best friend Kelsey finds this out, she’s determined to change things and drags Bliss out to a bar to do so.
Bliss runs into Garrick, sitting in the back reading Shakespeare of all things, she’s a drama student so this captures her attention.
I didn’t find this to be a big deal, because Garrick was only teacher for a semester before Bliss graduated but this added the necessary conflict to keep our attention in this story.
He had it bad for Bliss and he seems like such a sweetheart, I hope Ms. Carmack writes a story for him, so he can get his happy ending too!
This was cute. But nothing more, maybe a good book if you're in a slump.
It’s a shame that it was wasted on such a poor story about a naive little girl and a man whose only charm was his British accent.As the title says Losing It is about Bliss Edward’s quest to lose her virginity at twenty two and before she graduates from college.
That’s another thing, Kelsey, a supposed friend of Bliss’—what ever happened to her?—repeatedly calls Garrick a boy before they learn that he’s their new professor.
Garrick soon decides it’s not enough to keep him away from Bliss.
Just hot, fun sex.At least, that’s plan.She does find herself a gorgeous guy, Garrick.
In fact, it goes better than well – not only is he gorgeous but he’s British and charming and ohhhh the accent!!
I laughed out loud so many times while reading this book. "Stop! Cats! Stop!" may be my new favorite line (if you've read the book, you know what I mean ;)). It also gave me "One More Chapter" disease, because despite being tired when I picked it up, I kept reading until I was done. Very romantic and very funny.

We both got it because of that night you were pissed playing spin the bottle.Cade Why are you saying "bloody hell"?Garrick *shrugs* I'm British, explains the vampiric paleness, my use of "love" after everything, and my irresistible accent.
she freaks out, makes up a story about her cat (that she doesn't have) and runs out.
Of course he turns out to be her teacher (very original).And of course it's not right and awkward and frustrating and a lot of other things.
Their I love yous were kind of like getting a new puppy, he's cute and cuddly and makes funny noises and you love him at first.
First and second I love you was cute, but after 17th it sounded like cute puppy crapping in your shoe.You get to the Losing It par, which is nothing special.
I don't get his "One month, love.
Sex. I was going to have sex.
With a boy.
A hot boyA hot BRITISH boy.
Or maybe I was going to throw up.
What if I threw up on the hot British boy?
What if I threw up on the hot British boy DURING SEX?
5 out of 5 stars.It's reccomended for adult people but I think it's more +16.The synopsis of the book made me to want to read the book like a man who is dying from thirst wants water.What can I say?I am a sucker for this kind of setuations.
He stood and offered me his arm.“My lady?” “You don’t wan
Garrick is hot.He has british accent,blond hair and blue eyes and I wish my teachers were like that.
“I just… I get what it’s like to want something,but to try and force yourself toreally believe that you don’t.
It’s about wanting something you can’t have or something you don’t think you deserve.
It’s human nature.” "Its not that I don’t like cats.
Like in Groundhog Day when Bill Murray's character kept finding new and interesting ways to kill himself?
I wanted that to keep happening to Bliss Edwards.
Anyway, she adopts a cat because she doesn't want hot English professor to know that the real reason she freaked out about having sex with him was because she's a virgin.
If Cora Carmack wants to be taken seriously, she needs to up her game by learning basic English phrases, brushing up on comma usage, and learning how to tell a story that's even somewhat believable.
Cheesy and basically a life time movie. I have my moments, and sometimes I need a little cheese.
And it’s a touch overly dramatic what with the whole teacher/student trope (that is REALLY minor here, so if you hate that trope understand that there are MAYBE five years age difference here and he is her university ACTING teacher not, like, her Math 12 teacher or something like that which would make me puke all over the place.)The part about this book that I enjoyed the most was the general sweetness of these two together.
Yes Bliss is awkward – a la Zooey Deschanel (or preferable Rory & Dean days Rory) but it’s hilarious and cute and completely how I imagine I would have been had my life taken a different road.
Alright, I really enjoyed this. It was so addictive and entertaining. Slight cheesy, idealises the student-teacher relationship trope a bit too much, but at least they weren't young little shits and what the heck, I just inhaled it.
3.5 starstypical, but entertaining nonetheless!
I really enjoyed the author’s “voice” but the pacing the first half of the book seemed slow due to the fact that Bliss and Garrick don’t have a lot of in-depth interactions.
I’m a central Texas girl living in the country so it’s not something I’ve ever been exposed to.
Despite that, I laughed out loud so many times with Bliss and her friends.
She has some amazing friends and I’m pretty sure they’re going to get their books as well.
Once I felt the connection with Bliss and Garrick I was able to settle down and truly enjoy the story.
Suffice it to say that:1) I SERIOUSLY LOVED THIS BOOK2) It made me have feelings of the goosebumps & butterflies in stomach variety.3) I am immediately rereading this.
My fangirl love was sealed when, following a ridiculously hot scene, Bliss freaked out, yelled something about a fictitious pet cat, and ran out of her own flat into the middle of the night in her undies.
I was sucked in by the romance but I stayed because Bliss totally won me over - she actually went out and rescued a cat to try and cover up her insanity!
4. Bliss is so naïve and she gets on my nerves like 84% of the story.
9. I hate how people treat this story as a "Teacher-student" relationship because they make it sound SO SEXUAL and it made me have higher expectations for this book and when i started it i was like "........sike", like it's tagged as Chick Lit. looks sexy, sounds sexy, EVERYTHING SHOULD BE SEXY...
Why is it hard to have human-like-conversations and non-monotonous-dialogues in a story?11.
what i liked in this story!!!!1.
6. The cat was also my favorite thing in the story because she hated Bliss.
