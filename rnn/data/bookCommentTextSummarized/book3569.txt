Calendar Novella #1My son and I bought a literary pre-Christmas gift for ourselves: a calendar with prettily wrapped short novellas, one for each day from 1st until 24th of December.
So the idea is to read one each day, no matter what kind of story it is and how much other reading material is piling up.We started with a vintage Miss Marple story, and it was pleasantly nostalgic.
I hadn't read Agatha Christie in decades, and had completely forgotten that she is a brilliant observer of the human condition, not least in her ability to reveal the underlying emotions in seemingly rational people.
A science experiment. When you read it you'll see what I mean. Excellent story!
A short story by Agatha Christie via Tuesday Night Club members, A lady is cautioned by a clairvoyant of the wickedness and peril in her home. On a full moon, she should look for the signs: blue primrose implies alert, blue hollyhock is peril, and blue geranium is passing!
Min första läsning om Miss Marple och jag är helt klart sugen på att läsa mer om just henne.
1/24Älskar Agatha Christie
Underwhelming
Mysigt småputtrigt och klurigt, precis som brittiska deckare ska vara. Inget blod men däremot blommiga tapeter. Gemytligt. :)
Meh, lite för kort och lite för långsökt!
Sv: Intressant sätt att luras på.
All vidskeplighet behöver uppenbarligen inte vara sann, det räcker med att spela på känslor och rädslor och plantera bevis.
För en gångs skull var brottslingen en karaktär som redan nämnts, något som uppskattas för hur ska jag kunna gissa mig fram till den skyldige om jag inte känner till dennes existens?
Dock blöder mitt hjärta alltid lite grann när det handlar om respektive som slutat älska varandra.
Eng: Interesting way to fool someone.
All superstition obviously doesn't have to be true, it's enough playing with emotions and fears and planting evidence.
Mysig historia.
Non mais sérieusement! Où va-t-elle chercher tout ceci! Agatha, vous allez me rendre folle!
Ex-Commissioner of Scotland Yard Sir Henry Clithering is staying with friends at their home near St. Mary Mead. When asked for suggestions, he requests that Miss Marple be one of the dinner guests. He remembers the Tuesday Night Club with fondness and thinks he may have a case that will stump the elderly sleuth. Once again plying the poisonous waters of a village filled with gossip mongers, Miss Marple solves the case without batting an eye or using sal volatile. Fast-paced and fun.
Never underestimate a little old lady in lace. Another great little story with a few red herrings and an interesting twist. I had seen this story adapted for television some years ago, but it had slipped my mind. Jane Marple always makes me smile with how clever she is.
I always love a Nice Agatha Christie book. And I just love miss marple
A bit of chemistry always adds to a crime for me and for a 32 page short story, this is a perfectly packaged crime novel.
Agatha Christie went to a lot of trouble in some of these stories. It’s very scientific.
Great little mystery!
Good short read.This was a good short read. It ended rather abruptly. I always like a good Miss Marple mystery. Okay for 99¢.
The Unbreakable Alibi (Ett vattentätt alibi)I enjoyed all of them in the little snack size they came in and I will return to Agatha Christie's short stories, which make the perfect nightcap for someone like me who sometimes has trouble putting her mind to rest in the evening.
In her novels there are often hints that can help you with figuring out who committed the crime for yourself, which didn't happen in these shorts (which I guess makes sense).
The other thing was that the crimes appeared to have to be more far-fetched than usual to make the story interesting, while it's usually some interaction between the characters that make the showdowns so interesting.
Miss Marple is a fave xP Even thought she's an old lady and Christie writes a tad "old" fashioned with typical gender stereotypes, is it enjoyable and fun! Because miss Marple quickness and smartyness (can you even say that?!) is admirable without being to over the charts smart like some TV-shows, just cleaver at it's best.
Ingenious.What a surprising end. I didn't expect that ending at all. The way in which the mystery was approached and solved me thinking what a way asthma christie has with written word.

A good and light fiction readingMiss Marple is my favourite character in Agatha Christie's novels. Always love it for a light fiction reading, reread it several times.
Good short story. Classic Christie! A quick read.
A good short story with Miss Marple, one of my favourite detectives.
