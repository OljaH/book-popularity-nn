This was so great! One of the best graphic novels I've read. I wasn't expecting the dark turn it took there towards the end. I would definitely recommend this for those who are wanting to get into graphic novels.
Hilarious and charming and relatable!
I absolutely LOVED the art style and the humor--it's a beautiful book that had me laughing out loud throughout.
The dynamic between the narrator and the main character was something I'd never seen before, but it thought it was brilliant!
There were some aspects of the plot/worldbuilding that weren't fully developed, but if you can just go along with it, this is pretty close to perfect.
Great art, great story, great characters, great humor.So, to recap: THIS WAS GREAT.
READ THIS.
I haven't read anything else by Bryan Lee O'Malley yet, but I will definitely be checking out the Scott Pilgrim series ASAP.
THIS BOOK IS SOLID GOLD.The illustrations? ADORABLE!The theme? Old but done relevantly!The story? Compelling!The characters? Loveable!Sequel? Doesn't exist but I want one so bad!Everything about the story and characters had me flipping through this gorgeous graphic novel late into the night. The moment I finished it I wanted to start it again. <3
This follows Katie, a talented young chef. She runs a successful restaurant, and has big plans to open an even better one. This review contains *spoilers*.Then, all at once, progress on the new location bogs down, her charming ex-boyfriend pops up, her fling with another chef goes sour, and her best waitress (Hazel) gets badly hurt. And just like that, Katie’s life goes from pretty good to not so much. What she needs is a second chance.   Katie has been given a second chance. And it seems like s
This follows Katie, a talented young chef.
And just like that, Katie’s life goes from pretty good to not so much.
What she needs is a second chance.
Katie has been given a second chance.
And it seems like she was the only one who knew.Also, can I just comment on how utterly beautiful the colors and art style were in this graphic novel?
Also also, I really loved how the narrator and Katie “interacted”:
the colors and art and ahhh it's just so good.)

One night her ex comes into the restaurant and then her best waitress gets horribly burned.
Then that night she finds a box in her dresser left by the house elf.
Instant redo.The thing is Katie keeps wanting to change things.
Why not have that instant redo.
So easy..Just write it in the book and have a mushroom.
Lis the house elf is not happy with Katie.
Only one redo was allowed.
Katie begins to get very greedy with those little easy mushrooms.
This book is a decent little tale of working for what you want instead of just wishing for magic.
I thought this would be si-fi-ish kind of novel,but anyway it was awesome.One of the best graphic novels I have read in a while.
Find all of my reviews at: http://52bookminimum.blogspot.com/ What could possibly go wrong with eating a random mushroom left for you with those instructions? Katie should have probably asked Alice about that . . .  Actually, in Katie’s case the magic ‘shroom simply gives her a chance at a “re-do.” And boy could she use one in order to get the renovations on her dream restaurant back on track and stop just being the chef at Seconds.

Actually, in Katie’s case the magic ‘shroom simply gives her a chance at a “re-do.” And boy could she use one in order to get the renovations on her dream restaurant back on track and stop just being the chef at Seconds.
Unfortunately, when a waitress gets badly burned Katie uses her “do over” in order to prevent that from happening instead.
If changing one thing worked out fine then changing everything she doesn’t like about her life should be great, right?This was a pretty enjoyable way to spend my coffee time on Saturday morning.
Kinda shits the bed in end, its one of those books, but the two-hundred pages leading up to the reveal are nearly perfect. What struck me reading this was that the conversation about Seconds will always only ever be about its relationship with Scott Pilgrim and and not about the fact that this book does the thing all good YA* does: it gets really fucked up, really fast.When O'Malley wants it to get dark, it gets fucking  dark .

Seconds is a book about selfishness and desperation and, eventually, disorientation.
One of the most original graphic novels I've ever read!Around the Year in 52 Books Challenge Notes:- 10. A book you feel you should've read by now
This graphic novel is just cool.It's the story of Katie, a chef who wants to open her own restaurant, and she also wishes she could get back with her ex-boyfriend, Max. Katie lives in an apartment above a restaurant named Seconds, and one night she meets Lis, the spirit of the house.
But Katie can't stop trying to change things and make her life "perfect." Each morning she wakes up, she isn't sure exactly how the world will be different, and her life has changed so dramatically that she doesn't remember whole parts of it anymore, because they never really happened.And by constantly changing the universe, Katie has angered the house spirit, and she accidentally created a monster.
Seconds es una historia rarísima: Katie trabaja en un restaurante, pero su sueño es abrir uno propio, así que desde hace tiempo está trabajando en ello, aunque eso le ha costado muchísimo dinero, una que otra amistad e incluso su novio.
Cada que Katie escriba uno de sus errores en esa libreta y se coma una de las setas podrá resarcir uno de sus errores pasados...
Me gustó muchísimo la división de los capítulos en los que conocemos un poco más a cada personaje, especialmente los de Katie, por supuesto, Lis y Hazel.
3,8/5Apparently I can’t stop reading graphic novels .
It’s so much fun reading a graphic novel .
And is so much work and talent to appreciate.
Seconds was definitely good.
It reminded me so much of Anya’s Ghost, I feel like this is the 2.0 version of a similar idea: more complex , longer , a larger cast of characters , a grown-up main character ( and the child in me is the happiest with) more beautiful colors.
Not that I don’t appreciate Anya’s Ghost , I’m just happy I’ve read it first.Summing it up, this was really good.
Mais um pra lista.
Sério, foi uma leitura perfeita pro momento.
Amei os personagens, a história, a narrativa, tudo.
Ele tem um senso de humor ótimo, que não impede a seriedade ou deixa bobinho.
Também achei um quadrinho bem imersivo, os desenhos passam MUITA coisa, dentre elas, movimento e expressão.Adorei a parte mágica da história; foi o toque perfeito.
Achei bem criativo e diferente.
A utilização desses elementos pra passar a mensagem (E QUE MENSAGEM) foi simplesmente a melhor escolha.
Queria muito mais dos personagens e de tudo isso.
Cadê???Muito bem desenvolvido, e com bastante sensibilidade (do jeito que o moço aqui gosta).
WOAH! The colouring and illustrations in this graphic novel are the most beautiful that I have ever read, and unlike most graphic novels where I struggle to form any real connection with the characters, in this everyone feels so real! The plot is really quite meaningful too and is a lot darker than you think it will be at the start... I loved it!
I love this story.
It is about Katie and her restaurant.
It's also about mushrooms and I love mushrooms.
Yum. There is a house spirit, which I think is the twist that I really love.
There is a love story and there is snow!
Sounds great right?
It creates a great story.
I am a fan of the art and I loved Katie as an imperfect character.
Her restaurant 'Seconds' sounds so good and I would love to eat the food.
Of course it's good.
That's not necessarily a deal-breaker: after all, Scott Pilgrim is also incredibly shallow and unsympathetic -- but he's part of an exciting story with a vibrant ensemble cast.
SECONDS, by contrast, really is a single-hander; for me, none of the supporting cast here were developed much beyond turning up to make a bit of plot happen.O'Malley is an immensely talented cartoonist and there were some amusing bits in the story, but I think there will be a lot of pristine copies of SECONDS sitting on bookshelves next to increasingly dog-eared SCOTT PILGRIM volumes in the months and years to come.
Amazing. This was a fun, hilarious, and at times very dark graphic novel. I'll read anything Bryan Lee O'Malley writes!
I've never read anything by Bryan Lee O'Malley, but I love the Scott Pilgrim movie.
The artwork was adorable; it's like little chibi characters.
And one of my favorite things was the interactions between Katie, the main character, and the third-person narrator of the story.
It was fun to have her directly respond to the narration with snide remarks or contradictions.
I also really enjoyed the use of slang and "like" and "literally," because it made it very relatable.
I mean, she literally eats mushrooms and has the ability to alter her reality...Overall, this was a quick, really fun read.
I was reading it at 4am...) The artwork was gorgeous and the unique concept had me hooked from the first page until the last.
I absolutely loved that it followed a cast of characters in their twenties and the fact that it centred around a restaurant was so much fun.
It had a diverse cast of characters, all of which I instantly warmed too.
I thought the occasional interactions between the narrator and Katie (the main character) were so much fun and so different from any graphic novel I've read.
I had a huge amount of fun reading this and I'm certain it will be one I'll reread in the future.
THIS book hit all my buttons, to no surprise. New favorite.
Así que esta es básicamente la historia de Katie, una chica —no tan chica— que abrió junto con sus amigos un restaurante llamado "Seconds", que mas temprano que tarde obtuvo popularidad; y en el lapso, vio muchas cosas pasar.
En una serie de eventos que involucran a un adorable espíritu, Katie se ve envuelta en un misterio que le permitirá cambiar su presente.Graciosa y encantadora.
Bryan lo hizo de nuevo; con personajes bien formados, y adorables ilustraciones, Seconds, atrapa desde el comienzo, y no te permite soltarlo hasta que lo hayas finalizado.No podía evitar pensar en Scott y Ramona cada vez que veía a Katie.
Fun, funny, but also dark.
Katie messes with things she doesn't understand and ends up whizzing through different realities, making her realise what really matters and other such deep messages.Katie's one of those characters that I both like and dislike, but she did make me laugh.
Switching between standard cell work or full page illustrations to a top-down floorplan view...
it felt like a nice mix that made it fun to read.
At over 300 pages there's a lot to this graphic novel, and it's a beautiful thing to have on my shelf.
It’s been four years since the final Scott Pilgrim, though Seconds is more of a sequel to Bryan Lee O’Malley’s first book, Lost At Sea. Both feature protagonists searching for something they had all along.
This is also O’Malley’s first book that’s been published in full colour (though the Scott Pilgrim books have been recently re-released in full colour hardbacks) and, if you’re unfamiliar with his style, the art is strongly anime-influenced.
Seconds is a slightly more mature book than O’Malley’s previous publications, though it’s full of the author’s usual wit and humour.
😊Esta es la historia de Katie, una chef de 29 años que trabaja como jefa de cocina en un restaurante llamado “Seconds”.
El sueño de la protagonista es abrir un restaurante propio, y hace cuatro años que pone todo su tiempo y dinero en hacer que esto ocurra.
Pero sus esfuerzos parecen no ser suficientes, así que para lograrlo, decide tratar de corregir sus errores con ayuda de unas setas mágicas que le ha dejado un “espíritu” en su casa.
😍Espero que le den una oportunidad, se los recomiendo sobre todo a los que andan con poco tiempo para leer ya que se lee en un rato.!!
Você já imaginou o que aconteceria se o espírito de uma loira misteriosa aparecesse no seu quarto com um cogumelo mágico que te permite mudar os seus erros e te dar uma segunda chance?O Bryan Lee O'Malley imaginou e escreveu uma história incrível!Seconds tem um ritmo muito constante, um senso de humor muito divertido e me trouxe uma reflexão muito interessante sobre todas as vezes que eu tentei mudar alguma coisa pra agradar alguém, achando que aquilo seria bom pra mim e no meio disso tudo eu acabei me perdendo e esquecendo o que eu queria que fosse diferente.
Recomendadíssimo <3
This was mega cute.
What a nice story!!!!!! I just really, really enjoyed this story about second (or third or fourth or..) chances and trying to fix something whether or not it's broken. It has a magical element to it, house spirits, which I really liked. It played into the story very nicely. One thing that I loved was how the main character, Katie, could hear and interact with the narrator, I thought that was really cute. This is just a really nice story!!!!! I think you guys should read it!!!!!!!!
A fantastic morality tale; a bunch of twenty-something characters designed to be entertaining rather than believable; crisp and bright manga-esque cartooning. Nothing terribly original or deep, but competently executed and enjoyable enough.
Time travel, 29-year-old quarter-life crisis, magic mushrooms, and amazing illustrations. What more could you ask for from a graphic novel.Even I, a person who doesn't really like graphic novels, settle down for an exciting romp every time I pick up a B Lee O'Malley book.So much more I could talk about, but I don't have a copy. So I'll come back later and flesh this out.
I finally read SECONDS this weekend, and I really enjoyed it. I love the cartooning style O'Malley used in this book, and I thought the coloring was very beautiful. And the concept of house spirits -- and the world-building around them -- was fresh and interesting and drove the story along at a great clip. Very curious to see what Mal has up his sleeve for his next project.
