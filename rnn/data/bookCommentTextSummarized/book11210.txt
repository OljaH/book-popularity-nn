Set in 1970, it starts out promisingly with unambitious diplomat Sir Stafford Nye accepting a daring proposal from the beautiful and enigmatic Countess Renata in the Frankfort airport.
But then Agatha Christie totally forgets about that plot and spends another 160 pages underdeveloping a Youth riot/neo-Nazi/world domination scheme where the same characters are rarely seen in more than one chapter and the so-called mystery/murder is an afterthought in the last chapter (no clues anywhere that I can see).
It's full of rants about youth which are sadly typical of late Christie.
The only thing I can say is that an author needs to start rewrites from page 100 on with the premise.
“Does anybody care to look at history nowadays?”Passenger to Frankfurt is best known for being maybe the weirdest thing Agatha Christie ever wrote.
I think Passenger to Frankfurt won itself such unflattering epithet mostly because it comes from the mind of one of the most loved and acclaimed mystery writers of all times, an artist whom the public has learned to trust unconditionally, a pen so reliable it can do no wrong.
In my opinion, if Passenger to Frankfurt had been written by someone else, a less known writer or even an author at his first try, it wouldn’t be regarded as such a bad book.
- but being somewhat deranged and hell-bent on declaring war on all youths, because they are the root of the evil that seems to have befallen the world (seriously, in the context of the plot this is supposed to make some sense - because young people are incapable of individual thought?)."‘Riot must be put down.
I shall speak also in your name, the name of the Government, you have done your best, you have acted as well as you know how.
In particular, drugs that make people benevolent, but may also lobotomise them.Seriously, tho, where I lost it was with the seemingly endless political theorizing between the parts that actually moved the plot forward.
This act of stupidity bothered me from the first chapter only.Then comes the part where he tries to track down that woman - which was a little interesting but then the book took a major U-turn where it became all about creating another world with superhumans, swaying a crowd with words and all those Hitler concepts.
That's when I lost even the little interest I had in this book and started reading it just for the sake of finishing it.
It takes me mere hours to finish Christie's books on an average but this time it took me 2 whole days!
No Stars.I was going to write a thoughtful review about how some of the elements of this book resonated in an era of Trumpism. Things got a little shaky early on, but I struggled forward. And then, on page 159, it became entirely insane, at which point I simply couldn't do it any more. This is among the worst books I have ever read. I cannot even begin to imagine why Christie thought this was a good idea. If Atlas Shrugged and Mein Kampf sexually assaulted The Big Four in the darkest corners of

If Atlas Shrugged and Mein Kampf sexually assaulted The Big Four in the darkest corners of Christie's fevered imagination, this book would be born nine months later.Fuck this book.
You could tell based on the preface and the strange pleading to the reader that this COULD all happen and that Christie had stewed long and hard on this, but really it was her way outside her element.
The book is like an old woman's paranoid treatise, so guess mildly interesting just for that odd window to Christie's view of 1970.
Then the revelation of Juanita (who I actually suspected earlier in the book, but dismissed because the part was so small and got distracted by the all the angst and silliness) happened and I found I didn't even care that much who the murderous assasin was.
Dame Agatha, like her alter-ego Ariadne Oliver with apples, might've chewed on too many plot lines and misplaced some of the half-baked ones here.Apples everywhereThis novel started out with fun intrigue and Stafford Nye, a mischievous court jester of sorts in Britain's political circle, seemed like an interesting character.
Too bad he had to get himself involved with espionage and revolutions et al, all because of one boring character.
I can't not give this 5 stars. It was definitely one of the most puzzling books I've ever read, but I loved every minute! A riot of fabulous characters, too. (Though that's expected with AC) ;)
Woof. This is far and away my least favorite Christie. I'm still processing all the ways that this is terrible, but yeah. Not good.
Christie attempts a James Bond style story, complete with outré villains and globe trotting protagonists.
It's almost spec fic with its near-future revolutions and social engineering.
Sadly, it's overblown, vague waffle predicated on a premise of OMG YOUNG PEOPLE!
The villains may be outré but that's no substitute for actual characterisation.
Only a few scenes come to life with real personality and Christie's trademark arch humour.
The end is abrupt and muddled, and frankly throws away an interesting idea that has been explored in SF TV shows to good effect.
The text is full of repetition that does not even lead to a solid idea.

I have read some fantastic Agatha Christie books but this one was all over the map and I think tried to hard to be more than what it was. Not sure why the disconnect but I had to go back and reread parts over again because the flow of the story was just off. Not a favorite.
I feel sad giving only 1 star to an Agatha Christie novel, as I have found almost every other book I've read of hers really intriguing.
Passenger to Frankfurt is definitely of a different genre than the rest of her novels.
It is more a book about politics and social commentary than the typical whodunnit that she is known for.
The only reason I stuck it out until the end was because I'm trying to chronologically read through her entire catalog of written works.
That being said, I feel like I could have skipped this one and not missed out on anything.
What on earth is Agatha Christie's idea of an "extravaganza"?
Yes, "Benvo" is quite outlandish, but I liked seeing Christie go back to her roots (she worked in a chemist's dispensary early in her career) and after all the poisons she has fictionally unleashed on the world, I can see a nice symmetry in proposing a chemical solution that would bring world peace instead.
I found the anxiety about a new Hitler believable, even if the solution was not.Also, one can see traces of Christie's talent with characterization and human psychology here.
Christie was clearly at odds with the values and ideas of the era and it infects her book with a strange, paranoid flavor that seems very funny from a point 40 years after the novels publication.
Her writing style feels antique and she would probably have been better off writing period books at this stage of her career.
OK, it was good as a concept, but... maybe I am dumb, but I did not quite get the end game... but that is just me :/
Knjiga krene odlično, ima puno potencijala, zatim hrpa ljudi, opisa istih, međusobni odnosi...malo sam se pogubila. Neki kao zaplet koji nikako da se zahukta i, na kraju, štanga. Ne kužim gdje je nestao vrhunac? Pomalo sam se gubila u cijeloj radnji koja me nije držala pretjerano koncetriranom pri čitanju.
And then the plot thickens for some next few pages as this diplomat tries to search this girl, he even succeeded and then right in the middle of the book Mrs. Christie loses the plot and started babbling about god knows what for the next 200 pages and then in the end she again catches your attention and finish off in style like always.
To begin with, the story fails to pick up at any point of time, it was rather like reading excerpts patch together to assemble a book.
The story is little disoriented as in, the beginning and the ending are so much out of sync that it felt like they came from two different books.
Quite frustrating really, when you read and read, and JUST when you feel that you're finally seeing where things are going, a completely different subplot takes the spotlight.Another thing that I disliked, was the immense number of characters.
If only you can keep on reading till the last chapter...All in all, a very confusing book, with too many characters and too many subplots.
I wouldn't say it was a complete waste of time, but I've definitely read much better.
So if it's a choice between this, and another one of Christie's mysteries, choose the other one.P.S. I loved the character of Lady Matilda, though (Stafford's great aunt)!
Perhaps because this time I put more effort and #bacabareng gave a boost..When Sir Stafford was ushered by Mary Ann to join the meeting with Big Belinda and some of the most important people the world recognized, I could still follow.
Okay, they wanted to rule the world and ignited chaos.
Did they want money, power?
Next it was brought that indeed those people involved had money, power, drug.
Ujug-ujug lagi hepi end buat Stafford dan Mary Ann..I think, Oma AC cocoknya nulis kisah pembunuhan, detektif, crime.
Yah, saya subyektif sekali mengingat Frankfurt dan duo Tommy Tuppence didn't work for me.
Passenger to Frankfurt is not your typical Christie crime novel.
In fact it isn't a crime novel, it is a spy/thriller written in 1970.
Having looked at other reviewer's I can see that alot of readers don't love this novel, no Marple, no Poirot and no murder.
This novel deals with unknown wealthy, powerful people who encourage social unrest and violence.
The unknown people are far right, fascist extremists who harken back to the rise of the Nazi Party.
They believe they can gain power once more by supporting the young and encouraging the rise of fascism in youth culture.
This is different - this is no crime novel, it's a tale of espionage in a much darker vein than many of Christie's earlier work.
As her 80th book, written at the age of 80, it shows a different side of Christie that not as many people know about.Unfortunately, it's not the most memorable of Christie's novels, and while I've read worse, I haven't read much worse from her.
Passenger to Frankfurt is mediocre at best, worth a read if you can't get enough of Christie but otherwise now really worth your time.Instead, I suggest investigating some of her better books - Poirot in particular appears in most of her greatest works.
This is the reason Madame Christie isn't known for her political intrigue novels.
There is no suspense here.
But not because she has no plot.
But because she has no idea how international spies talk or act or think.
Their conversations do not amount to anything.
For this reason alone, the book sucks.
I got half way through before I realized that Christie was figuring out the story on the page.
None of the original details that support her best works, none of the mind boggling twists and turns that her most crafty novels showcase.
Hardly anything happens here.
Intriguing premise.
This was a strange book.
The first time I read it when I was 17 I was all like "Wow, Agatha Christie has written an alternate history story about NAZIS!" and then I read it again a couple of years ago and all of its flaws shone through.
And the solution decided upon to deal with the emergency is more extreme than the Nazi revivalists are themselves!One gets the impression Agatha Christie really didn't like the youth of the 1960s and didn't bother trying to understand them.
This book is in many ways her rant about them.
Super, super weird, even for a Christie novel.
For one: no mystery, just a bizarrely convoluted story of international 70s-style intrigue involving a well-born British guy who likes wearing capes, a nefarious plot to get students to overthrow all governments, Wagner's Ring symbolism, an evil Nazi blonde hunk, and (spoiler!) Hitler living a secret life in Argentina where I guess nobody recognizes him in even one instance over the course of 30 years.
Hint hint!)This was too crazy to even claim that Christie was just cranking it out for the check, so I'm just depressed about it.
Disappointing, preachy...she sounds like a grouchy scared old person. Also, an attempt at a spy novel which falls flat. Nothing is developed properly, characters are one-dimensional. If it did not have her name on it, I would not believe she wrote it. It was short, but felt longer. 2.5 rounded to 3 stars because she is Agatha Christie. Usually her books are treats, this one made me irritated and, ultimately, very sad.
AudiobookParanoid much? This book seeks to explain that the Vietnam war protests, drug use and student unrest during the 1960s was all the result of a hidden group trying to take over the world and bring the Nazi's back into power. And you're stupid if you didn't see it coming. I guess I'm stupid. Not my favorite. Although Hugh Fraser did a great job which raised by rating by one star.
#OneAgathaChristieBookEveryMonth April - 2018Buku Agatha keenam yang saya baca, dan sayangnya ini jadi buku yang paling tidak favorit sampai saat ini. Seperti membaca bukan cerita dari AC. Besok sudah berganti bulan dan akan melanjutkan dengan judul lainnya yang semoga lebih baik dari ini.
(Actually, I find a lot of The Big Four in it.) First of all, it is a spy thriller—but not like other and older Christie’s spy thrillers.
If you read Buchan and liked it, you will enjoy this book.
(And I wonder if this critic actually read her book...) Another critic wrote that the plot was “inconceivable,” which is surprising, considering he was old enough to have heard of Hitler’s Youth.
The same critic believed Mrs. Christie did not understand what “Third World” meant; yet it was clear she used it not with the connotation of “Third World Country,” but the (utopian) world the rebelled youths thought they were helping to create.
