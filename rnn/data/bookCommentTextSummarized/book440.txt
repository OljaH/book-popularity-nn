This book is H.G. Wells’ rewrite of the Book of Job. This book is extremely well-written, extremely philosophical and extremely dense. Job and his friends debate (or rather, orate) on the destiny and intrinsic nature of humankind and of God, and the purpose and role of education. It wasn’t that pleasant to read on the trolley, nor is it a particular page-turner, but it does offer some really beautiful and thought-provoking prose to the reader.
Can man keep faith in God?
Though there is a plot in the book, it is more a discussion, an unfolding of ideas on the nature of God and the priorities of teaching.
Mr. Job Huss, seems to be put to the timeless wager between God and Satan - will he curse or bless?
I found the prologue, the discourse between God and Satan, a charming interlude, and was disappointed when the story of Mr. Huss and his colleagues was not as enjoyable.
I will read this again in the future, but for now, I'll be sticking with Wells's sci fi.
It's not easy to pick your single favourite book. This is mine.
I did find this quote from H.G. Wells in this 1918 book, 20 years before World War II, to be fascinating:"Take some poor German boy with an ordinary sort of intelligence, an ordinary human disposition..." "Do they teach him anything of the great history of mankind?
Do they tell him anything of discovery, of exploration, of human effort and achievement?
(No such distinct race ever existed; it is a lie for the damning of men.) And these teachers incite him to suspicion and hatred and contempt of all other races.
Everything German they tell him is good and splendid.
Worst writing style i have ever read in a long time...
Beautiful and impactful retelling of the story of Job. One of Wells' best novels. Ever relevant. On the courage of your heart, all things depend.
