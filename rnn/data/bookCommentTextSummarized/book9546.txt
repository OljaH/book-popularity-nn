Pasternak packs into his novel two revolutions, two world wars and a famine.
This is true of Yuri who comes across as pompous and ineffectual at times which I’m not sure Pasternak meant.
To be honest I’m not sure how similar Yuri is to Pasternak but because they are both poets there’s often the feeling he’s writing about himself.
Pasternak means well when he writes about women but like many educated man of his generation can come across as patronising.
Komarovsky is a key character to understanding what Pasternak thought of the revolution in broad terms.
It is an epochal novel focused on the particularly turbulent, violent and uncertain but yet future-defining era in Russian history - the time frame around the Russian Revolution and the following years of brutality and confusion in the Russian Civil War. The driving forces of the story are the frequently senseless and almost always cruel historical events, a greater force against which the efforts and intentions and agency itself of the characters are pathetically, frustratingly helpless and futile.
لماذا لا يكون اسمها لارا منذ بداية الرواية لنهايتها؟ أفهم أن التقاليد الروسية تستدعي ذلك و أن أمانة الترجمة تقتضي عدم التعديل لكن و الله العظيم ما حد هيزعل لو كان الأبطال هم يوري و لارا و تونيا و روديا و باشا و كنا سنتابع الأحداث بسهولة أكثر بدلا من التركيز على حفظ خريطة الأسماء المكعبلة الثلاثية في كل الروايات الروسية علما بأنني لن أقوم بعمل توكيل رسمي لأي من الأبطال حتى أحتاج للأسم الثلاثي.المهم أن لدي طريقة لاختبار مدي استيعابك للأسماء الروسية و هي أن تقول ماساشوستس عشر مرات متتالية فإن نطقتها بدون خطأ فستتمكن عندها من قراءة الأدب الروسي.قرأت طبعة دار المدي للترجمة و النشر و كانت الترجمة مملة جدا دفعتني لترك الرواية في منتصفها و مشاهدة الفيلم مما جعل قراءة النصف الأخر من الرواية أكثر متعة و سلاسة.لا شيء عبثيا ولا منطقيا في هذه الحياة، أكثر من الحياة ذاتها.
All the signs are there for one heck of a remarkable novel, but I couldn't help feel my hands were only brushing gently over a layer of snow, rather than thrust deeper into all that coldness.The result though, after it's first outing, still remains a special one.Doctor Zhivago opens in the first years of the century, spans the revolution, civil war and terror of the thirties, and ends with an epilogue in the mid-1940s.
Zhivago's time as a family man and doctor are long gone, and thinking back to the novel's opening sections feels like it was read in another life.
Like most great Russian novels, there is a large cast of characters (all of whom go by at least three different names) and many chapters in which a whole lot of nothing happens.
If one insists of a plot synopsis then it is a story of Doctor Yuri Zhivago and his attempt to keep his life together as his country crumbles around him.Pasternak's politics are very much at play throughout the novel.
At times Zhivago does become somewhat of a mouthpiece for Pasternak, especially near the end of the novel where it becomes a brutal critique of everything from War Communism to the NEP to Collectivisation.
Here’s a short commentary from the translators:‘the accursed questions’ : Dostoevsky coined this phrase (prokliatye voprosy) for the ultimate questions of human existence – the nature of man, the existence of God, the problem of evil, the meaning of life, the riddle of death – “the great Russian questions” as Nicola Chiaromonte called them, which Pasternak raises again in Doctor Zhivago, “when it seemed that history ...
486. Доктор Живаго = Doctor Zhivago, Boris PasternakDoctor Zhivago (Russian: Доктор Живаго) is a novel by Boris Pasternak, first published in 1957 in Italy. The novel is named after its protagonist, Yuri Zhivago, a physician and poet, and takes place between the Russian Revolution of 1905 and World War II. The plot of Doctor Zhivago is long and intricate. It can be difficult to follow for two main reasons: first, Pasternak employs many characters, who interact with each other throughout the book

I guess we can interpret the whole storyline as a metaphor of that period of Russian history, in which case it all makes sense but still doesn't make it „one of the greatest love stories ever told” as advertised on the cover.The first hundred pages of the book are devoted to introducing at length, dozens of characters.
And Pasternak definitely loves his pickles.Now that we've dealt with the bad and the ugly, let me tell what was good about this book.
Alas, you can, because if it's that good and it's all taken away and your net time with each amounts to squatski (Russian for "squat"), in the scheme of your life, maybe life's a bitch after all.Dr. Zhivago brings us another Russian opus dealing with man as pawn against the great playing board of history.
Zhivago is a Renaissance man of Russia, interested in poetry, writing, philosophy, history, medicine, etc.
And she surely comes across as the wife everyman envisions but never gets (Zhivago included, though his vision at least took form for an ethereal second).Like War & Peace, the book goes back and forth between wartime scenes (a man's world) and domestic ones (man and woman) seamlessly.
This is a timeless masterpiece. While many readers are going to love this book, I think others will find themselves bogged down by its many details. Certainly those readers who enjoy primarily plot driven novels are going to be frustrated by the dreamy Doctor Zhivago.
Yet Pasternak, and by extension his creation Zhivago, makes allowances for the need for social reform in Russia, and so his later and eventual dissatisfaction with communism has greater weight and credibility.Besides Yuri Andreyivich, Pasternak describes a triumvirate of Russian characters: Pasha/Strelnikov, Kamerovski, and of course, Lara.
Lara is Mother Russia, raped by a gilded villain, obligatorily married to an ideal, and in love, hopelessly and tragically, to a poet philosopher with whom togetherness cannot be.I can understand how someone could call this their favorite work of all time, it was beautifully written and, like Tolstoy’s War and Peace, was iconoclastically both epic and intimately personal.
وكتب عن تلك الفترة قائلا: "لقد وضعت كما الوحش في زريبة، في مكان ما ومن خلفي صخب المطاردة، وليس من طريق أمامي للخروج لكنني عند حافة القبر اشعر أنه سيأتي اليوم الذي سيزول فيه كل ذلك الخوف"‎ربما كانت طيبة قلبه وسذاجته التي جعلته يعتقد أنه من الممكن نشر هذه الرواية في الاتحاد السوفييتي.
And such also is the immobility to our eyes of the eternally growing, ceaselessly changing history, the life of society moving invisibly in its incessant transformations."Doctor Zhivago is about nothing, if not about change, transformation, upheaval and survival.
(hide spoiler)]The story encompasses, in the life of its title character, all the possibilities of love and suffering open to humankind.
(hide spoiler)] Minor objection when you consider the fine quality of the book at large.If you have never seen the movie, you should see it.
A Russian song is like water in a mill pond. It seems stopped and unmoving. But in its depths it constantly flows...By all possible means, by repetitions, by parallelisms, it holds back the course of the graudally developing content...Restraining itself, mastering itself, an anguished force...it is a mad attempt to stop time with words.   Here, Pasternak's character was describing a song, but I do believe Pasternak was defining his novel. Or maybe I just want to believe it, for this book is ind
Here, Pasternak's character was describing a song, but I do believe Pasternak was defining his novel.
Or maybe I just want to believe it, for this book is indeed a Russian song.
Get past the characters with quite a few names and you get to language:Language, the homeland and receptacle of beauty and meaning itself begins to think and speak for man and turns wholly into music, not in terms of external, audible sounds, but in terms of the swiftness and power of its inner flow.
It is rare.The story is about Dr. Zhivago, an orphaned boy at the beginning of the novel, a doctor and very distraught man at the end.
Η επικράτηση του κόκκινου στρατού έφερε διώξεις στα γκουλάγκ, αναίτιες δολοφονίες, πείνα, έλλειψη τροφίμων (κάτι σαν τη βενεζουέλα σε πολύ μεγαλύτερες διαστάσεις), πυρπολήσεις ολόκληρων χωριών, εξαθλίωση του πληθυσμού, δήμευση περιουσιών, όσο για την οικονομία οι κρατικοποιήσεις και ο περιορισμός σε μηδενικό σημείο των εμπορικών συναλλαγών, έφερε ως αποτέλεσμα την μαύρη αγορά.Το δεύτερο σκέλος που θίγει ο συγγραφέας είναι οι πολιτικές μέθοδοι διώξεων των αντιφρονούντων του καθεστώτος, τις οποίες έζησε ο ίδιος και σχεδόν πλήρωσε με τη ζωή του.
Ο θάνατος του αποτέλεσε την αρχή της αμφισβήτησης και τελικά της αποκαθήλωσης του καθεστώτος στα μάτια του κόσμου.
Boulders.Centuries and years.[From "Fairy Tale" in Doctor Zhivago, poem quoted in full below]This sweeping romantic epic is set in Russia mostly during and after the 1917 (October) Revolution.
Rather, he portrayed the brutality with which a revolution’s ideals may be pursued at the expense of preserving other ideals, spiritual or personal or artistic, in a time of such violent upheaval.Doctor Zhivago returns from WWI, after the October Revolution, and finds that disease and riots have ruined Moscow.
Lara is the wife of a revolutionary named Pasha who she has not seen in years.Zhivago is soon taken by a group of Red partisans and forced to serve as their doctor during guerrilla warfare in Siberia against White partisans.
By way of simple comparison, the movie captured very well the spontaneous passion of a brief love affair between physician/poet Yuri and his lover Lara, whereas the book dealt in much greater depth the tumultuous factional warfare incidents between the First Russian Revolution (1905) and the Russian Civil War (1917 – 1922), and their deleterious impact on everyday Russian life.
In the background loom the bloodshed resulting from the fall of the monarchy and the advent of the Civil War.Part Two zooms in on the spontaneous development of the love affair between Yuri and Lara in the Siberian towns of Varykino and Yuryatin, interrupted by Yuri’s being kidnapped by the Forest Brotherhood (a branch of the Red Faction) to serve as their camp doctor.
I have researched Russian history, especially the Russian Revolution.
Russia deserved a revolution.
The serfs were mistreated slaves.
I have read many biographies of Peter the Great, Catherine the Great and Nicholas and Alexandra.
The Russian people had a love/hate relationship with the tzars.
And yet they traded those oppressors for communist oppressors.
Stalin was much worse than any Tzar.This story takes place during the revolution when everything was completely turned upside down.
Yuri and Lara's love affair was as chaotic as the world around them.Russian authors are a breed apart.
They fight injustice and bare their souls with a love of Mother Russia.
Second, did you know that the average person in Russia during the early to mid-1900s went by a minimum of five names?
The novel assumes you know all of this; it is written as though you were there.
This novel is the real deal.
It is challenging to read, but it is the real deal.
It is one of the most meaningful fictional exchanges I've ever had the pleasure to read.This was a huge novel in its time.
The average person will never pick up this novel to read.

AUGUST 2 REVIEW: After finishing the book last night, I immediately wrote my review. I always do that because I right away start reading the next book. Also, writing what I learned from the book and what I felt while reading it are easier if the story is still fresh in my mind.However, for almost the whole day, I thought that I missed the whole point of the story.

Also, writing what I learned from the book and what I felt while reading it are easier if the story is still fresh in my mind.However, for almost the whole day, I thought that I missed the whole point of the story.
My August 1 Review below definitely was too weak for a beautifully told forbidden love story of Yuri and Lara.While driving from the office, I asked the usual questions that I ask myself after reading a book: Did I learn something from it?
The way Pasternak described it is that the love between Yuri and Lara is one true beautiful love.
As far as I know, Doctor Zhivago appeals for three reasons. First, it is an epic by and about a man caught in the thick of the tumultuous period of Russian enlightenment and revolution. Second, like many epics, it follows the romance between a man and a woman (or in this books case, three women) whose love is made impossible by the political circumstances in which they live. Third, and lastly, it was bravely published in the 1950s, censored immediately by the Soviets but heralded by non-Red lite
As far as I know, Doctor Zhivago appeals for three reasons.
First, it is an epic by and about a man caught in the thick of the tumultuous period of Russian enlightenment and revolution.
Second, like many epics, it follows the romance between a man and a woman (or in this book´s case, three women) whose love is made impossible by the political circumstances in which they live.
Pasternak is a courageous writer, his Zhivago a courageous novel.
However, as an epic and romance, the book does not deliver.
And the romance?
Read the book because it´s important, but don´t expect to love it.
Hell, maybe I should write that book.Now I can finally watch the movie and see if I also have a boner for Omar Sharif, or if my love of the story was the only thing my mom passed on to me.Reading Doctor Zhivago refreshed in my memory all the reasons I love literature and books, and why I probably will never manage to have an e-reader.
It's a story she read probably at that same age and it took her away and made her love life and literature.
"نظرنا نحن إلى الحياة كأنها حملة عسكرية؛ لقد أزلنا جبالاً في سبيل الذين كنا نحب. وإذا لم نكن قد جلبنا لهم إلّا الشقاء، فإننا لم نمسّهم بأي إهانة لأنهم إذا كانوا شهداء فنحن شهداء أكثر منهم."   ثلاث سنوات وأنا أقوم بتأجيل قراءة هذه الملحمة الروائية، والتي بحثت عنها كثيراً في المكتبات. وحان وقت قرائتها في شتاء هذا العام، وقت ممتاز ويتناسب مع أجواء روسيا الباردة.-------------------دكتور جيفاكو: ليست مجرد رواية عادية، بل ملحمة بكل ما تحمله هذه الكلمة من معانٍ. لن تجد هنا الحُب فقط، وإنما ستجد الثور
لن تجد هنا الحُب فقط، وإنما ستجد الثورة، وستجد الألم، وستجد الخيانة، وستجد الفكر، وستجد الفلسفة، وستجد المرض، وستجد الشيوعية، وستجد الطبقات، وستجد الحرب، وستجد الشعب، وستجد الجوع، وستجد الدم، وستجد الشهداء، وستجد الضحايا والتضحيات، وستجد السلطة، وستجد الحزب، وستجد التاريخ، ستجد الموت، ستجد المعاناة، وستجد الأطفال، وستجد المصالح، وستجد الاستغلال، وستجد الكفاح، وستجد وجه روسيا الحقيقية.تبدأ الرواية في بداية القرن العشرين (1900)، وتتناول حياة الطبيب والشاعر والمفكّر والإنسان يوري أندرييفيتش جيفاكو من طفولته وحتى مماته، وترصد كل علاقاته، وأفكاره وتطوّر شخصيته وفكره عبر مرور الأعوام وتأثير الحرب العالمية الأولى والثورة البلشفية عليه.
The plot follows of the life of Yuri Zhivago more or less, as he witnesses historical events around him questioning the real purpose behind each political action taken.
His status as a doctor (considered a higher class where a classless system was being implemented) and member of the intelligentsia group of philosophers constantly put him at odds with the growing power of the Communist political party.Behind the political backdrop, the story also develops around Yuri's love life, or the tragedy of it, as he involves himself with at least three different female characters throughout the course of the book.
Ho letto "Il dottor Zivago": parla della RussiaIl romanzo Il dottor Živàgo ci fa entrare nel mondo di Jurij Andrèevič Živàgo e della bella Larissa Fiodorovna Antipov nei primi decenni del novecento, dove i due conducono vite parallele che lentamente si vanno a intrecciare.
Writing is awesome frequently (though not frequently enough) especially the poems in the end but it has a bunch of issues - some boring parts, repetitiveness, annoyingly large number of coincidences (like in Dickens), confusion about names - not only because of Russian three name system but also because writer doesn't make any effort at clarification.
That, annoying as it was for me (and probably for Zhivago too) seems to be intentional on part of the author - a motif to represent disturbance that had become a part of life in Russia.
