I watched Kuroshitsuji first, that's why I'm so late in reading it.
I liked it so much that's why I picked this out even though I finished both seasons.
But enough of that.Kurshitsuji introduces the young Earl Phantomhive, Ciel, who inherited his title and his job as the Queen's dog from his deceased father.
Sebastian can do and WILL do everything Ciel tells him.
Apparently, Sebastian is a demon Ciel made a contract with.
And then eat Ciel's soul of course.I LOVE Kuroshitsuji.
I URGE you to read this awesome manga.
The overarching plot seems to be that Ciel wants revenge for the death of his parents, and for help with this he has sold his soul to the demon Sebastian.
This seems to be forgotten almost instantly, as all we see Ciel actually do is bicker with his demon servant, bully people and get kidnapped.
Instead we assume he must be dwelling on his parents, because he sold his soul to avenge them, which would be fine except for the fact that he doesn't really seem to be getting on with it...Sebastian, as mentioned above, is perfect.
Or rather, with one of the paedophiles.I'm going to stop now.
I am strangely obsessed with the name Sebastian. No one in my fimily would be surprised if one day I decided to adopt a kid just so I can name him Sebastian! Maybe I should go for a cat or something smaller first. What's wrong with me?
What can I say about this first volume in the Black Butler series?
But my very favorite part was the last couple frames of the manga, in which Sebastian turns to exit, but then pauses, turns to make eye contact with the reader, and raises his finger to his lips in the 'shhh' gesture.
I have many favorite manga series, but can honestly say that I was more drawn into this one any other I've read.
It was really great, I am so excited to read the next volume!
Okay, first, no surprise, Sebastian (the Black Butler) is a sexy, sexy bitch! So I was looking forward to reading this series!It's pretty interesting! Mysterious with beautiful illustrations. The clothing, the people, they're all good looking and well dressed. And Sebastian is a stud. Nearly every picture of him made me swoon :-p I'm excited to see what other secrets will be revealed as the series goes on!  (soooooo sexy!)
Just recently I watched all of the Black Butler anime series and upon finishing the show I knew I had to read the manga.
Here are a few things I like best about Black Butler:1.) It's set in Victorian London.
Black Butler certainly has that uniqueness.Okay, so some of those may not be specifically about THIS volume but about the manga series/anime altogether.
Black Butler is perfection for fans of the paranormal, horror, demons, historical fiction about Victorian London, dark stories, and gothic reads.
The anime is fabulous...I *need* to read the manga.
Bite me, but I do have a maaaaaaaajor crush on Sebastian.
Oh wait, he's a demon?
Can we just forget that he is...ermmm...a demon?
I always wondering, wouldn't it be better if Ciel is not a boy but is a 18 years old girl.
Flawed, revengeful yet cute Ciel?
In short, it's hard not to be a fangirl when you constantly having nosebleed throughout the series.
Beware of Grell Sutcliff, even he certainly not going to cause you a nosebleed, you'll adore him...or her?
Nevermind!And I started drinking the exotic Earl Grey tea because of the series!
Wow, I think I have a crush on the Black Butler.
how did that happen?
He's not real!This was weird and quirky and took awhile to get into, but I liked it.It's about - well, a butler.
A larger than life, kick-ass butler who surely can't be human, can he?
He fought off gun-toting Italian gangsters with forks and table knives while hanging from the chandelier.
. His young master is the head of the Phantomhive family and it takes place in an alternate Victorian England that seems to be mixing up the timeline a little bit.The rest of the staff provides the comic relief but that was the only thing I found a bit distracting.Definitely reading on in this series!
وایییییییییییییییییییییییییییییییییییییی *.*من به طور کلی زیاد نمی تونم مانگا و کمیک بخونم، برای همین با انیمه راحت ترم.
انیمه ش هم خیلی قشنگ و خوش ساخت بود :)داستانش...
کلا عالیه 3> فوق العاده :)انیمه ش رو با نگین که می دیدیم هر دو دقیقه یه بار غش و ضعف می رفتیم برای اینا شخصیت هاش=)) سباستین یه نمونه ی خوب برای شیطان های بی تفاوت و خونسرده و شیل هم به عنوان یه بچه که داره نقش بزرگ تر از خودشو ایفا می کنه واقعا عالی پردازش شده.
در کل در مقایسه ها انیمه ها و مانگا های معمول ژاپنی خیلی خوبه :)
Black Butler (黒執事, Kuroshitsuji?) is a manga written and illustrated by Yana Toboso.
Since its debut on September 16, 2006, it has been serialized in Square Enix's shōnen manga magazine Monthly GFantasy.
However, at the Sono Shitsuji, Shūshō: Saigo no Bansan o Anata to Tomo ni (黒執事『その執事、終章　～最後の晩餐を貴方と共に～?, "That Butler, Last Chapter ~a last supper with you~") event on June 14, 2009, it was announced that the anime will be returning for a second series.
The series has been licensed for an English release by Yen Press and will be published in Yen Plus' August 2009 issue for the magazine's first anniversary.Contents[hide:]
My biggest gripe: The book is set up backwards and you have to read it right to left from the back to the front of the book.
The extra staff were stupid in the background and very cartoon-y.
The rest was so serious, why the stupid characters who are obviously incompetent.
The story - was good.
I actually really loved Sebastian and of course, you are supposed too.
I thought the serious characters were good.
It looks like there is a cartoon of this.
Sebastian does have me curious and wanting to know more and the book is such a mess I don't care to do so.
I've never been much of an anime/manga fan (with the exception of Akira, Vol. 1), but several people recommended that I read Black Butler so I ordered a copy.I honestly didn't get it.
Sure, I understood the story, I understood what was going on, but I didn't get the point!
Nothing made this book stand out for me; it was your run-of-the-mill manga novel.
It got rather boring, to be frank.My sister cautioned me that there's incest and pedophilia as the series goes on, and that the animated series is the same, so I don't think I'll be one of those teenage fangirls who indulge in that sort of thing.
I'm sure that there's an audience for books like this...
Meh.Meeeeeeeeeeh.I will admit, manga and comics in general are a hit or miss for me and I vastly prefer it's motion counterparts, but I have also never watched the anime of Black Butler.And it's not for lack of encouragement.
One of my close friends watches about 2 animes a day and desperately tries to bring of us (the rest of our friends) over to the dark side.
Somehow, I have a feeling that watching all the events in the manga unfold in motion in the anime would be much more interesting than just reading it.
Just a big ol' nope on this one.
Black Butler is such a beautiful manga not only in terms of drawing style and covers but also in the design and matching personalities of the characters.🖤 It is set in Victorian London (!) and follows the story of the young Earl Ciel Phantomhive and his mysterious butler on their way solving riddles, receiving missions and getting revenge. ( ᐛ )و
So maybe it gets better later (and I assume it does because I know plenty of people who LOVE this series), but Black Butler I seems kind of plotless and pointless to me.In general, Black Butler I is pretty boring: not much is going on.
As a result, after reading this volume, I still feel like I know close to nothing about what's going on in the series, which is kind of frustrating and doesn't make me want to pick up the second volume.What is more, the characters are super flat and I don't like or care about them AT ALL.To make matters worse, the humor in Black Butler I doesn't work for me.
Ehhhhh... I expected more from this because it's one of the incredibly popular mangas/animes. But it fell flat for me. Sometimes manga paneling and dialogue can be very cluttered and confusing for me and this was one of the more confusing ones. I didn't really feel that any of the characters were compelling and the lesser characters were cliché for this type of media. The plot didn't feel very original either. I may decide to watch the anime one day and see how far that goes, but this just didn't do it for me. I won't continue this series.
I just needed to find a story that caught my eye and mind.
Black Butler by Yana Toboso is dark, mysterious, action packed, and fun.
Everything I needed to lure me in.
Young Ciel Phantomhive and his ever present butler, Sebastian, made me smile, smirk and wonder.
I need more, more, more!
What is Sebastian’s story?
There is so little time for massacres and rescues, when he has dinner to prepare for his young Master.
:D I can’t wait to learn more about Ciel and Sebastian.Off to find Book 2…..
Es más un 4.5 ⭐Me pareció un poco flojo el inicio porque como que tarda un poco en entrar en acción la historia, pero al final me gusto.La trama se ve interesante , la relación entre Sebastián y Ciel es interesante y te deja con la intriga de saber cómo comenzó su historia.Yo soy de las que se ríen con las caras chibi de los personajes y en este tomo hay muchas de este tipo, así mismo la actitud "juguetona" de Sebastián me gusto.Parece ser que es una gran historia y que con el tiempo mejorará, s

Así que ....
after flicking through a friend's volume and trying to comprehend what was going on, while simultaneously falling in love with Ciel within two pages, I ended up watching both seasons of the anime within four days and buying ten volumes.
Yep. It's actually pretty good.I'm just going to start with Ciel, because have you seen him?!
I love how exposition is done gradually, with Sebastian's true nature slowly becoming clearer until the details of the contract are revealed in the final pages.
Did I mention Ciel yet?Finally, the art is just...
Everyone is well drawn, I love the Victorian settings and clothes, it looks so detailed.
The art sold me for this one, it was perfect for this particular manga.The story is about a rich young orphan named Cial who had made a pact with a demon named Sebastian who then became his magical butler than can do pretty much anything (No really, I bet if Cial wanted him to pull elephants out of his arse he would do it.).
The side characters are unique though you don't see too much of them and this volume touches upon Cials backstory, a very tragic one , that is later expanded upon.This is a good start for this series and I liked seeing where the author took it.
I don't care whether you like anime or manga but you must watch this anime or read the book ( if you're new to anime /manga , I advise to watch the anime because I think you're going to enjoy it more .
Everything is just so perfect and whenever I read this book , I look at my surroundings and think " why the hades don't I have a butler !?
" but then I remember that I can't even friggin afford buying my own books so that thought shuts me up but STILL !
Must read this book .
This garbage feels exactly like reading the fanfiction of some creepy ass sexually repressed girl in her early teens.
Seriously I have never felt so uncomfortable reading something since that one part of Sleepers (if you read that book I am sure you know exactly what part I am talking about) I tried to find something positive to say about Black Butler but honestly there is nothing.
It is one of the worst things I have ever read and I honestly wish I could sue the writer for the time back that I spent reading this crap.
¡Me pone tan feliz que hayan empezado a publicar este manga en Argentina! FAN, FAN jajajaMe gustó muchísimo, pero me guardo las 5 estrellas para cuando aparezca Grell(? (todavía no leí tantos mangas como para saber cómo reseñarlos/calificarlos... Ténganme paciencia, con el tiempo voy a ser más confiable)
Picked this up because the anime is super popular and I had to read the manga before watching the anime. I'm not very impressed by this volume. Hopefully, the next volumes will be good.
Muuuuy interesante. Aunque si al principio estaba súper perdida, porque no captaba del todo de que iba y hacia donde va pero oh Dios necesito máásss!
Second read. I'm currently obsessed with the anime and had to give the manga another chance. Basically it was me fangirling over Ciel, Sebastian and the servants this time around xD13. März: ***
Okay this was really good. Very different from the anime but I’m really interested in learning more about this agreement between Sebastian and Ciel. I can’t figure out if it’s related to his family or if it’s something else. The first part was a little difficult to follow and I think that’s because I kept the anime in mind when reading this but when I let that go I was really about to enjoy it. I’m glad I have volume 2 on hand to pick it up when I’m ready.
Volviendo al punto, si conocen la adaptación Anime pues no hay mucha novedad en el Manga, básicamente los primeros capítulos son lo mismo (creo que es a partir del 10-12 que las historias se separan y van por sus caminos) así que para los fans este primer tomo no plantea nada nuevo pero es una misteriosa y excelente introducción para aquellos que apenas se acercan a la obra, el ritmo comienza lento, con toques de humor, misterio por saber quién es en realidad Sebastián y porque le sirve a un chiquillo caprichoso como Ciel, poco a poco la historia comienza a despegar y nos muestra unas escenas de fangirleo intenso para todas las fans del demonio más guapo.
