This is a series of stories showing what happens when some people take the law into their own hands.
There are smatterings of racism, the pseudo-science of physiognomy and a lot of two older men pursuing those who have escaped the legal system.
Also published as Again the Three Just Men (which makes a lot of sense) in 1921 it shows a feeling of how justice is paramount and that there was a possibility of a great new world.
The eugenics train is not a comfortable ride but overall for the period it's interesting, the stories are snappy and bite-sized but I enjoyed it.
Although he probably does that in at least one of the remaining books as well.
<3Either way, this turned out to be a collection of chapter-long stories, so it makes sense that I did not really recall reading it before.
He’s the center of attention and he is the one who goes around killing people.
And doesn’t that just sound funny?
XD Okay, he does not kill all of them; some just receive other types of punishment.
And I will allow that the fact that the just men (or what remains of them, anyway) insist on finding proof before taking action might explain the awful delays in the previous book.
*shrug*Another funny thing?
Four just men is an example of a book that has aged very badly as unsympathetic murderous viligantes with a penchant for immoral pseudo science.
I've decided that I just don't like the Four Just Men and their notion of justice.
A (mostly) good collection of short stories. Although three of the four just men are still living only two actively take part in this volume: George Manfred and Leon Gonsalez.
