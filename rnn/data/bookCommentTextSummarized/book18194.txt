You kill off a major character in a series ender not through rebel shenanigans or anything, but HEART TROUBLE?!?!?!?!Gillian: Don't even pretend you weren't devastated when SPOILER died at the end.Gillian: Okay.
FINALLY Kiera Cass writes an interesting character, and then she has to go and ruin everything with a COMPLETELY RIDICULOUS ENDING THAT COMES OUT OF NOWHERE WHEN THOSE STUPID REBELS DO THEIR STUPID REBEL THINGS AND IT MAKES NO DAMN SENSE AND OH MY GOD.
I don't like when characters change their minds and hearts abruptly from one book to the next.
After reading.. I'm just sooo emotional over this,, the sweet sweet sweetness, adorable emotional angsty love .. i love love love love this, i love it...fangirling.. AAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!My Maxon ♥ ♥ ♥♥ ♥ ♥“Break my heart. Break it a thousand times if you like. It was only ever yours to break anyway.” "Shhh," I urged.“I'll love you until my very last breath. Every beat of my heart is yours. I don't want to die without you knowing that.”"Please don't," I choked.♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥

I want a life with you.” ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥“In those seconds, I was mourning everything I'd lost.
EDIT 21/04/2014The wait is almost over! Soon we'll find out - Maxon or Aspen, Aspen or Maxon? Maxon, Maxon, Maxon,Max.....----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------EDIT 27/09/2013Well, looks like I was right! The cover is gorgeous!Two more assumptions to go...Fingers crossed!----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Maxon and America will be together. Aspen and Lucy will fall in love with each other....And the cover will be with a girl in a white gown on it:)But the question is - Can we wait till 2014??? I'm not sure :( I want it now!
I was immensely proud of America by the end of the Elite, and couldn't have been more happy with the end of the trilogy! We all knew who she would end up with! I was crying the "I'm so lonely!" tears all through the last chapter before returning to my single life. Haha
**UPDATED JANUARY 19, 2014**AMERICA!!!??? * Maxon & America<3For America, I expect her to be plain. Many times in the book, she is not viewed as the prettiest and continuously refuses to wear too much makeup or dress too fancy. Maybe in "The One", she will change her mind in order for the public to view her as the gorgeous girl her family, Aspen, Maxon, and many people see. I hope not. I like her stubborn ways! :)Extremely excited about "The One" but having to wait   one year  ?UGH.

I AM SO READY FOR THE COVER!
OMGI AM EXPECTING TO SEE A WEDDING DRESS FOR THIS COVER;)So I can NOT wait for 2014!
America-ness was not so easy.I liked that she stood by her beliefs and values, but it drove me nuts how she flip-flopped all over the place with her feelings.
Throughout the series, I never felt like the rebels were truly threats, they never seemed very dangerous.
Things wrap up a little too nicely, and I feel like there were some things that needed to be properly sorted out between our characters.
More of the flip-flopping feelings, where the past just seems to have been unrealistically forgotten.
*pulls hair*I think that so much frustration could have been avoided if the characters had just thought things through and weren't so selfish.
Wouldn't it be awesome if Maxon turned out to be gay? And then he ends up with Aspen!
America, my love, you are sunlight falling through trees. You are laughter that breaks through sadness. You are the breeze on a too-warm day.  Cue the eye roll,  this is definitely going to be one of  those  kind of books.  Break my heart. Break it a thousand times if you like. It was only ever yours to break anyway. Picking up where we left off, Maxon Schreave (points for having the world's worst last name) has to make a crazy-hard decision. And there we were, in the background of it all, hold
America is still in the competition, but as the crown draws ever nearer, she will have to come to the ultimate decision - face her own demons and become queen or run away from it all forever.This one was definitely better than the last (honestly, Cass could've cut the entirety of book 2 and nothing would've been missed.) but I still think it was missing far too much.The world building didn't feel nearly as fleshed out as I would've hoped.
Looking forward to seeing what this series brings us readers soon :)Review:Hmm. How to feel, how to feel, how to feel...It's hard to know exactly how I'm meant to feel about this book.On one hand, I'm kinda happy that the series managed to close in such a way (unlike some series' *cough* Divergent *cough*).
And yet here we are, simplifying things in the final book.Exhibit A: the over-simplification of emotionsOne word: Maxon.For those who have read The One, only that word is needed to convey my feelings on the issue.
Yes, you read that right - Maxon has tantrums.
3.8/5 Stars ⭐ ⭐ ⭐ ⭐“Break my heart. Break it a thousand times if you like. It was only ever yours to break anyway.” I had the lowest of the low expectations for this book. I wanted to throw The Elite out of the window. I wanted to throw this one out of the window too. But I was less inclined to. I still firmly believe this trilogy could have been a duology, even one book without all the redundant political situations that weren't even portatryed right! I was satisfied with the ending, it was pre
The time has come for one winner to be crowned.When she was chosen to compete in the Selection, America never dreamed she would find herself anywhere close to the crown—or to Prince Maxon's heart.
In this book, you had a certain target, which was Maxon, and you withheld the information from him that you love him?
Also, Maxon realises, just by America being close to Aspen for God's sake, that he was her previous love.
Maxon had a cold and over the top reaction to America's past with Aspen and then...
It had some flaws, but as far as series finales go, it was actually rather satisfying!
This series is super addictive, and even though I was frustrated a lot, I was also totally invested in the story--I laughed, I cried, I gasped out loud, I shook the book (pretending it was America).
This series isn't too deep, with more focus on the romance plot than the dystopian plot, but it's still gripping and extremely entertaining, like a good reality TV show.
If you're looking for something fast-paced and fun (and can handle a frustrating protagonist) then this is definitely the series for you!
10-2-12; 10:47pm  : Team Maxon! :)9-26-13: W o w. Look at this BEAUTIFUL cover. In my review of The Elite I said I wanted the book green, but I'm COMPLETELY won over by the white. It's gorgeous. I can't wait! 03-12-15 Hey guys! So, I FINALLY got back into reading/reviewing and I'm happy to say that THE ONE is gonna be my first review back!I read THE ONE when it first came out and I've been DYING to do a review on it because I've been a fan since like... day two of THE SELECTION release. Ha!Any
I don't hate the white, I just like green better.I haven't read/looked into Kiera Cass too too much, but I believe she's written other books and I have to say- I wonder if she's ever written any ACTION scenes.
And honestly, I'm kind of weirded out by America's maids crush on Aspen.I pictures the maids older like the fairies in Sleeping Beauty, so it was kinda weird.BUT LETS JUST GET TO THE CHASE.TEAM MAXON!
I'm happy with the end results and can't WAIT to read THE HEIR, to see of their are any hints of their life together (secretly hoping Cass will do something with that).Overall, the romance side of the story was great.
Team MAXON!!!!!!!!!!! Omg the name is out and it is awesome. The c-c-c-c-COVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!! it.... is..... AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! *super happy dance*Update in the middle of book:The feeelllllsss and OMGJust finished the book, good ending but the feels, this book made me cry so much. It's killing me!
Update 10/27/13: A lot of the people in the comments seem to think that America's actions in The Elite were worse than Maxon's.
In The Selection book Maxon told America that it was fine if she had doubts, and I understand that she also told him that she was over it in The Elite, but he completely ditched her when she needed comforting and then hung out with Kriss.
Maxon had made it seem like he was so ready for his relationship with America and that he was 100% loyal to her.
Read my full review @A Perfection Called Books It's non-spoilery and gif-filled!
And to both Maxon and America I just wanted to say:The Elite - The Elite (Elise, Celeste, Kriss, and America) bonded in this book.
I want a life with you."When I read those lines I just went:To get you excited for The One: - You learn shocking & unexpected things- Maxon and America have a huge blowout fight- People die-That's all I'm saying ;)The Ending:It was a bit rushed.
That big thing that happened near the end (you know those TWO THINGS that happened to those TWO people) seemed like an easy way out.
Rating: 1.5 StarsSPOILERS. Please read on if you 1. Have no intention of ever reading this book (good for you) 2. Have read the book (my condolences)3. Just want to see me rant about sleazy men and brainless women (isn't that why we're all here?) The One.  This title can mean so many things, but let me tell you what it means to me. It is the one book in this series that got a higher rating than a 1 from me, mostly because of an ending that completely surpassed my expectations of wtfery. It is a
Have no intention of ever reading this book (good for you) 2.
In the second book, I could see his idiocy in the way he handled his situation with America.
I must say, there was more of a plot in this book than there was in the other two, and towards the end, I actually got pulled in a little, which is the reason for the .5 star.
King Clarkson, who was the only thing stopping America and Maxon from marrying?
There is no thought, no tact put into this book, its characters, its structures, or its plot.
Let's pretend this never happened...Can't believe I read the whole series but I can now move on with my life.I couldn't stand the main character nor the love triangle. At least in this book, there was less girl-hate. The whole series could have been one book!Still... I did read them all....
If you don't want to hear the rants of a hot-blooded Italian, then please do not carry on reading.I shan't be held responsible for my actions.It's a fucking shame, really, that I wasted six months of my life waiting for this shitty book to come out.
I wish I could give it ZERO stars, because this was the most unsatisfying, ridiculous, rubbish book since the last shitty YA story I read.You wanna know what the major problem for me was?America.
I'd give this book a few more stars if I didn't find the main character and most of her decisions and actions extremely annoying and stupid. Seriously, who even thought writing a heroine like America Dumbhead Singer was a good idea? The only thing I like about her, is her boyfriend (singular, not plural *cough cough*). Actually, just pretend this one solitary and miserable star is all for Maxon because he deserves the world. *mouths desperately* protect him.
man, y'all were right :(
I'm crying with JOY!!!I can't give this book less than 5 stars because I got what I wanted.
I finished this book in less than one day because it was so easy and fast to read!
It has a huge amount of drama and it had me hooked till the very end!
And Maxon was as charming as ever, I really really love that prince <3.I don't know what else to say, for me, this book was the perfect ending to the series.
The way it ended was all I ever wanted.
Y no ha sido para nada así.PARA NADA.Me han gustado muchísimas cosas, desde la evolución de America hasta los increíbles giros que da la trama.
Que la trama de los rebeldes tuviese tanta importancia me ha encantado, porque era una de mis partes favoritas de la saga.
Maldita Kiera Cass...No sé qué decir, o cómo resumir lo que he sentido, porque es el final temporal de una de mis sagas favoritas.
LA MANERA EN LA QUE LA TRAMA TE SUMERGE, EL CÓMO TE SIENTES IDENTIFICADO CON AMERICA Y CÓMO NO PUEDES DEJAR DE LEER HASTA SABER TODO LO QUE PASA EN PALACIO.
I think I may have liked this the best out of the three.
America was still obnoxious, but I've come to expect that, so maybe I got more used to it?
I liked Maxon more BUT still obnoxious.
Every character in this book is obnoxious to some degree.The ending was great, for me.
I got real emotional at one part and was NOT EXPECTING THAT because I don't really love these characters, but I guess I grew to like them?
I don't even know.I wish more had been done with the rebels and other relationships in the book, but such is life.
I am an emotional wreck after reading this book.
We had loads going on in this book though – rebel activity, secret bargains, possible moles, death, destruction, assassination attempts, lots of changing of minds, lovey-dovey scenes, angry scenes, ‘why won’t you tell him?!’ scenes, ‘What are you doing?!’ scenes, ‘You’re going to get in trouble for that!’ scenes, ‘will you hurry up and do it already?!’ scenes, and finally, finally, finally – a wedding!!Overall; I just loved it!9 out of 10.**************************************************************************************************************************************************OMG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!IT ARRIVED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!You have no idea how hard it is to stop myself from reading the epilogue first!**************************************************************************I cannot wait any longer HarperCollins!
So let's just take it SLOW but get married first because everyone needs to know who you choose.
I need people to know that you can stand up for the cause as much as they want, but at the end, I always win.
America closes her eyes and she's all, "I must choose between Aspen and Max" as if that's the major concern in her life.
In all seriousness, this is what's probably going to happen  The last three are Celeste, Kriss and America.
America is still choosing between Aspen and Maxon.
In the end, they attack and Aspen dies for America.
AFTER READ: I'm pretty content with the end of this series. Review to come.-----------WOWWW THE COVER! I am so in love.All I want is a royal wedding between Maxon and America, okay. That's it.
Changing my rating from 4 to 5 starsφφφ, μάλλον αυτή τη φορά έχασα το “ταλέντο” μου στις βρισιές. Αυτή τη φορά δεν μπορώ να γίνω διασκεδαστική. Δεν μου βγάζει τίποτα τέτοιο το συγκεκριμένο βιβλίο. Μόνο συγκίνηση. “Δεν ήξερε ο ουρανός ότι ο κόσμος είχε γίνει κομμάτια; Πώς μπορούσε να λάμπει ο ήλιος εκείνη τη μέρα;”ΥΓ: Κάποιοι έφυγαν άδικα… Αλλά το τέλος ήταν πολύ τρυφερό και γλυκό για όλους <3
What happens to Maxon and America?!
Will Aspen & Lucy get married?!
Was Celeste's funeral glamorous?!
I NEED TO KNOW.*sighs* We've been through a lot, Mrs. Cass.
Just thank you for perfectly ruining my life.From The Selection, The Elite, and now The One. I am utterly speechless.Beautiful, dazzling, enchanting, romantic, annoying, terrible, cliched, predictable, yet - PERFECT.
Simply, flawed and perfect.The One was so intense, action-packed, America's and Maxon's love growing stronger, their love being tested.
Maxon's love letters..
Your series has ruined my life and I just don't know how to cope with it anymore.
Thanks!

I am so happy that I decided to reread The Selection series and it will always be dear to me :) I love this book so much!
In all seriousness, this book really did break my heart over and over 😭 and actually brought tears to my eyes towards the end.
She was torn between her first love and the life she thought she wanted and a Prince that was nothing she could have ever expected and was afraid of the unknown.
I really like all the other girls too though I really wanted to hate Kriss for America's sake I just couldn't.
