My verdict- By the beard of Zeus, this book was even better than The Darkest Kiss. I'm making Reyes the newest addition to my harem.

I'll treat him well.Long ago, twelve immortal warriors opened Pandora's box, unleashing the demons from inside.
Violence, Pain, Death, Disease, Disaster, Misery, Doubt, Promiscuity, Defeat, Lies, Secrets, and Wrath.Reyes had once been a warrior, whose duty it was to protect the gods.
He was now a Lord of the Underworld, possessed by the spirit of pain.
Danika has lived a sheltered existence- until she takes a disastrous trip to Budapest that forever changes her world.
Besides her family, those lessons were the only thing Danika lived for anymore.
Reyes mustn't get too close to the woman he desires, for fear of hurting her.
I love love Reyes.
"He was dark, she was light. He was anguish, she was innocence. He was wrong for her in every way, and yet, when she looked at him, his entire world felt right." Another great book from the LOTU series, finally we get Reyes's story and it was awesome :)))Danika is still on the run from the Lords, and now even from Hunters who are trying to capture her.Aaeron's demon has taken over him and wants nothing else than to kill Danika's entire family, so Reyes and the other Lords have to keep him restra

Any acts of cruelty by him are entirely linked with the gain of just more pain.Danika Ford: Artist Supernatural ability: She has a secret that not even she knows about it (view spoiler)[(She is the All-seeing Eye, one of the four keys needed to find Pandora’s box.) (hide spoiler)]Demon Pain and Lord Reyes are Frenemies.
He lives for the thrill of pain: ...he jumps from high buildings, ...he cuts his flesh deeply, ...he inflicts self-mutilation, ..he bleeds and bruises and breaks his bones.
Jump, Pain said.
The only thing she wants is to save her family that somehow is tangled in the Lord’s war.Reyes will fall in love with Danika with the only way he knows:
The Darkest Pleasure takes place right after The Darkest Kiss (I didn’t re-read nor review the latter because I actually re-read that book not too long ago) and it’s book 3 in the Lord of The Underworld series.
Paris, Aeron and Sabin were the ones that developed the most in this book and it’ll be interesting to see how the author will make them grow.I’d say this book is one of the strongest of the series because it gives what it promises.
I can’t recall if they’re explored later in the series but she might as well be the most powerful of the artifacts because, if she could incapacitate a god, she could transport them to hell, right?
Συνεχίζω να λατρεύω την ιστορία αλλα το σχήμα Ρεγιες-Ντανικα δεν με ξετρελανε όσο το Λούσιεν-ΆνιαΑγάπημενος Άρχοντας μέχρι στιγμής, ο Πάρις!!!! 💖💖Ακολουθεί ο Λούσιεν 😍
That is until he meets Danika in book one.Aeron the keeper of the wrath demon has been summoned by the king to kill Danika and her family.
Hunters know Danika was captured by the Warriors and they want to know what she seen while there.
Of course Reyes is there to stop him and tells her to run.
While on the run Danika is captured by the demon hunters.
Does Danika help the hunters or does she finally admit to herself that she has feelings for Reyes?
Does Aeron break free from his chains again and succeed at killing Danika and her family?
Having said that, I was okay reading this story.
Otherwise, oh, I would have been way out of comfort zones.I loved how tender Reyes was with Danika, even when I didn't think she deserved his devotion.
So, I was on the edge of hating poor Danika.
In the end, I was okay with Danika, although I much prefer Anya and Ashlyn.
Reyes loves her so much, I can't hate the girl, after all.
And, I ended up liking the reveal when it came to what Danika truly was.This series is building nicely.
I am eager to read about the other Lords' stories.
I loved it!!!One of my favorite books!!There was a lot that I liked about this book!The plot,the characters and generally the world Genna creates.In this book, we focus on Reyes and Danika.Reyes is the keeper of the Demon of Pain and Danika is on the run from Wrath who has been commanded by the Titans to kill Danika and the rest of her family.
I loved it so much!!There was a lot of action, something that I loved in this series!!I also believe that Genna knows how to create an amazing paranormal world that captivates many people and of course me!!!

The Darkest Pleasure is the third book of the Lords of the Underworld series, the story of Reyes, Keeper of Pain, and Danika Ford, a human woman with an incomparable ability.
Danika appears at first in book one, The Darkest Night, where Cronus commands Aeron to slay her and all her family: sister, mother, and grandmother.
Though Pain reacts to Danika in a unique way, Reyes is afraid to ruin her, so he tries to resist the temptation.
Danika is mad at Reyes, being kidnapped by him and the other Lords, and the threat they caused to her family.
Κάνεις δεν ξέρει γιατί έχει δοθεί αυτήν η εντολή έτσι όταν στο δεύτερο βιβλίο ο Aaron χάνει την αυτοκυριαρχία του, οι υπόλοιποι άρχοντες θα προσπαθήσουν να προστατέψουν τον φίλο τους από ένα τραγικό λάθος και την αθώα οικογένεια της ταυτόχρονα.
Όταν ο Reyes την σώσει και την μεταφέρει στο φρούριο του στην Βουδαπέστη, θα πρέπει σύντομα να αποφασίσει με πια πλευρά είναι πραγματικά.
Είναι νευριάσμενη με τον Reyes που την απήγαγε και που απειλείτε η οικογένεια της.
But every time she peered into the dark fathomless pools of knowledge and pain that were his eyes, she experienced… something else.
Opening Line; "Reyes stood on the roof of the Budapest fortress, five stories up, his feet balanced precariously on the highest ledge."THE DARKEST PLEASURE is book 3 in the fantastic and addictive Lords Of The Underworld Series and this time it's is all about Reyes, an immortal warrior cursed after opening Pandora's box and ever since bound to the demon of pain.
We've been waiting since book 1 to see Reyes's unrequited love for Danika reach its foregone conclusion and Showalter doesn't disappoint.As in past books this is an ensemble piece, involving the continuing stories of past immortals and their now mates, as well as those Demons yet to have their stories told.
THE BACK STORY Long ago twelve immortals warriors made by Zeus, became jealous of Pandora she was chosen to guard a box. Inside that box housed some of the most dangerous demons ever known. The Immortals made a horrible mistake of killing Pandora and opening the box. As punishment for the evil they have unleashed each warrior was sentenced to carry one of those demons for all eternity. They are - Violence, Pain, Death, Disease, Disaster, Misery, Doubt, Promiscuity, Defeat, Lies, Secrets, and W
Time is now running out with the Titans have taken the throne, the Hunters are growing and one by one the Lords are learning to trust others besides themselves to help win the war.
Name – Danika Ford  Things to know-  an artist on the run from Aeron who has been demanded by Cronus to kill her and her family.
Danika has been on the run ever since the Lords kidnapped her and her family, told them that Aeron has been commanded to kill them and then they were set loose and told to run and hide.
She can’t stop thinking about Reyes and how he came to her rescue when Aeron did find her.
We learn a little more history and a little more about the scope of the battles to come.
She can't seem to come to grips with that and I disliked her intensely for almost half the book.
But I can say that she redeems herself beautifully and I think these two are a perfect pair.Neither trusts the other and each of them apparently betrays their loved ones at some point in this book.
And the ending of this book is worth missing a few hours of sleep!Now for my rant.
I'm ticked that I have to wait 16 months, yes folks that's November of freaking 2009 for book 4.
God, what to say. Guilty pleasure to the MAX? Naughty bits, interesting concept, a little too much dominating possessive male action, but...whatever. :) Tiring of the "hot immortal guys living together who start being picked off by understanding females one at a time for crazy # of sequels" books.
Well its better late than never, cause this series is fast becoming one of my favourite.This book is about Reyes, it made me realize how little I know about the warrior, I knew he was the keeper of pain and a masochist, I never knew he hated what he is, he hates that he has to cut himself to feel pleasure, not to mention throwing himself off rooftops cause that is the only way the demon will live him be.
But in the end it worked out.Anya, Lucien, Aeron,Paris, Sabin etc were also in this book, the search for the artefacts goes on, its a race against the hunters, not to mention Cronus who is on Aeron’s neck to kill Danika and her family.
Ω! Θεοί!!! Τι ιστορία ήταν αυτή???Αυτή η σειρά όσο πάει και καλυτερεύει... Η ιστορία του Πόνου ίσως είναι η πιο ωμή και σκληρή ιστορία των Αρχόντων και η πιο περιπετειώδες... Τόσο οι μάχες σώμα με σώμα όσο και το μυστήριο που τυλίγεται γύρω από την Ντανίκα κάνουν την ανάγνωση ακόμα πιο ενδιαφέρουσα.4 αστέρια χαραγμένα στο στέρνο σου Πόνε !!!!
Seride şuana kadar okuduğum en iyi kitaptı diyemem belki. Çünkü ilk kitabın yeri bende ayrı :D Ama serideki şimdiye kadar okuduğum en iyi erkek karakterdi. Tüm kitap boyunca acısı resmen acım oldu. :D Diğer karakterler açısından da iyi bir kitaptı açıkçası.Bu kitapla birlikte Paris ve Sabin'e olan merakım çok daha fazla arttı. :)Ah Paris.. Son dakikaya kadar ne yapacak diye düşünürken resmen ters köşe yaptı. iyiki de yaptı.. Ama hala daha deli gibi merak ettiğim sadece Torin.
USTAM ÇEK ORADAN 1,5 ACILI 😈😈 Tehditkar kelebek; bu iki kelime yan yana gelince ancak tek bir adamı tarif edebilirdi.
Reyes'i.
Kitap, okuduklarım içinde serinin en sevdiğim kitabı olurken Reyes boncuğum da bütün iblisler arasında 2.
Evet, birincisi TORIN 💗💗 Kim ulan bu Reyes derseniz, 'Acı'ların savaşçısı, sadık aşık ve fedakar sevgili...
Ciddi olarak birkaç çocukla çıktım.''''Onları öldürmeli miyim?''''Ah, Reyes, sanırım bu, şu ana kadar bana söylediğin en hoş şey.'' ŞU PONÇİKLİĞE BAKIN 😍😍😍😍 ''Bana dokunma,'' diye bağırdı müziği bastırarak ve geriye sıçradı.Adamın kolu yana düştü.
''Bir daha bana öyle vurursan seni buna pişman ederim.''''Sen de bana mı vuracaksın?''''Hayır her yerini öperim, dudaklarımı vücudundan ayırmayı başaramam.''
The Darkest Pleasure is the third book in the Lords of the Underworld series and it just might be my favourite one!
Reyes, Keeper of the demon Pain, has suffered immensely because of his need to constantly cut himself.
From the very beginning, I was very intrigued with Reyes because of his demon and the fact that he isn’t the friendliest of the Lords.
But in this case, the relationship between Danika and Reyes grows stronger because of Danika’s ability to love.
One of my favourite parts of the book is when Danika finds the art studio that Reyes had set up for her.
Her yere adını kazımak istiyorum REYESSSSS.Ama öyle böyle değil kanlı kanlı, acılı acılı.
Tam senin seveceğim gibi.Ya Rabbim!
Adamın o kendi kendine -Danika tarafından yakalandığı sahnede olan yok mu, işte o- yaptıklarını okurken yandım, bittim, eridim.
O nasıl sahnelerdi öyle.
Tabii ilk birleşmeleri de bir o kadar harikaydı.Kan görünce ağzının suyu akan ben bu kitaba aşık oldum.
Reyes'in kendine her zarar verişine, her kıvranışına vuruldum.
Şu ana kadar okuduğum erkekler arasında bir numara oldu.Diğer yandan seri açısından da güzel gelişmeler vardı.
kitaba attığı Paris'in nasıl acı çektiğini gördük.
Ve korkarım ki acıları kendi kitabına kadar dinmeyecek.Paris'den başka merak ettiğim erkekler elbette var.
Wow! This book blew me away. I loved Reyes and Danika (I was totally waiting for this one). I want to savor these books but they're so great, I can't help but devour them. Onto the next one.
He was anguish, she was innocence. He was wrong for her in every way, and yet, when she looked at him, his entire world felt right."This means nothing.""Less than nothing,” he lied. "I’ll hate myself later.” "I hate myself now.” She opened her mouth to reply, but he swooped in and swallowed the words. Basically .......I loved the delicious burn of this book. I want to keep binge reading this series !!!!
5 stars – Paranormal RomanceDarkest Pleasure is the third book in Showalter's scorching hot Lords of the Underworld series. This is my favorite of the series so far. Reyes, the keeper of the demon of Pain, is an extremely sexy warrior/hero. The heroine, Danika, wasn’t my favorite of the series, but I came to like her character better towards the later part of the book. Another great read in the fun, sexy, and steamy Lords of the Underworld series!
Bu seriye bayılıyorum !!!4.5
Melankolik serseri Reyes 🖤Ben sevmem öyle ajitasyonu yüksek karakter ama adamın acısına oturup saygı duydum çünkü aşırı mantıklıydı.
Hatta acısından dolayı sevdiceğine zarar vermemek uğruna yitip giden libidosunun arkasından inşaat izleyen dayı gibi baktı garibim ve banyo köşelerinde yakalandı filan ama yıkılmadı 😅Danika da güçlü ve kararlı bir karakterdi.
Gerçekten uyumlulardı ve özel gücü çok iyiydi.Kitap karakterler dışında yan karakterleri tanıtma ve okutma olarak da çok başarılıydı.
Özellikle depresif ruh hali ve RS döneminin sonunda ilaç gibi gelecek akıcı bir kitap önerisi olarak mutlaka (hala okumayan var ise) tavsiye ederim.Ayrıca Reyes dışında Gideon ilgimi çeken diğer bir karakter 😈
5 αστερακια και για το περιεχομενο και για το φοβερο εξωφυλλο...
4,3
Death "warrant" (sort of) was placed on Danika and her family by the gods in book #2 of this series.
Reyes wants her, but afraid he'll ruin her/won't let her go/but keeps her at a distance/can't wait to see her...all this turns me right off a book.
I hated the fact that Reyes had to have pain to experience pleasure.
His demon was pain.
He jumped off a building to experience the pain of shattered bones while the others joked about hiding his internal organs--like they did an earlier time.
The author did a fine job refreshing events in earlier books.
4  starsDarkest Pleasure quickly just became my favorite book of the Lords of the Underworld series thus far. While I liked the first two books and planned to finish the series sometime this year, after reading this book I will definitely read the next two books this month.Why am I now dying to finish the series? First, I felt like I got to know some of the other warriors much better. There was also more interplay between one another. With the Budapest group, you really see the bond that they sh
First, I felt like I got to know some of the other warriors much better.
Though the other warriors got good airtime, I never felt like I was missing out on the story of Danika and Reyes, which coincidently was also great.
Second, this book provided great color on the history of the Lords and the dynamics of their interactions with the Greeks/Titans.
Also, the introduction of a new enemy stirs up the pot and creates some anticipation for what will happen next.
Speaking of what will happen next, I must go get The Darkest Whisper.
