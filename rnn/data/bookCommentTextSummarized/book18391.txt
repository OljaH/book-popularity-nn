This is the first book I've really enjoyed reading after my horrid book slump and I LOVED it! I need more of Kerri's writing in my life, especially with her amazing characters like bloody Jack ;)
Two words.Thomas Cresswell.Alright, of course there will be more words, I just needed to give you a proper motivation to grab this extraordinary book, and an obnoxiously yet damnably brilliant British boy seemed like a good idea. Now that I have your attention, let's move on, shall we?  “One taste of warm blood is never enough, Miss Wadsworth.”   Jack the Ripper.The Whitechapel Murderer. Leather Apron. Whatever you call him, he's still the same; a monster that lingered in the shadows, bathed in
Kerri Maniscalco's palette contained gloomy colours, grey for the mist that covered London, black for the shadows that hid the Ripper's work, mixed with crimson red, for all the blood that was spilled.
Wadsworth and Cresswell are always bickering, driving each other crazy, and the attraction between them turns slowly into something deeper that does funny things to your stomach (which is pleasant after all the ugly things the body parts and fluids have done to said delicate stomach), while the tension sets you on fire!
Stalking Jack the Ripper is a superb debut, and I am all too eager to read the next adventures of Wadsworth and Cresswell!
What I expected:A romance heavy mystery where I would be able to tell who was the culprit after one chapter (at most).What I got:A scientific approach to the infamous whodunnit' story of Jack the Ripper, featuring a strong heroine with a deep dedication to her forensic studies, constantly challenging what society deems is proper.
They really enhanced the reading experience, making it feel like I was gathering bits of evidence alongside Audrey Rose as the story goes on.
I'm not terribly good at figuring out whodunnit' mysteries, so keep that in mind, but I felt like the twists and turns this story took were not easily anticipated.
But the deliberate visceral appeal of those types of scenes, reminiscent of THE MADMAN'S DAUGHTER, are hampered by thin romantic beginnings, mannered dialogue, and an anachronistic hammering of modern feminist attitudes.
(view spoiler)[Recycled from previous reviews, but hey, I'm tired and I'm not paid for this.
(hide spoiler)]FEMINISM: GOOD.
See MY LADY JANE, A TASTE FOR MONSTERS, The Infernal Devices series, and yes, THE MADMAN'S DAUGHTER for just a few examples of heroines who defy society without seeming like girls from the year 2016 conveniently transported to another time.
You're not like other 19th century girls.
It was fun and exciting and I was just sitting there in my mentally gem-encrusted throne, staring down at the characters while seeping from a skull shaped glass and patiently waiting for them to sherlock holmes their way to the actual murderer.
And to be honest, it was the kind of romance where “the more you roast each other the stronger the love” and let’s be real if you can’t call your otp “two dorks who are in love but also wanna murder each other…in the cute way not the jack & hyde way” then is it really your otp??I’m so excited for the next book because you know:
Audrey works with her uncle cutting up cadavers and doing gross stuff they do with trying to find out causes of death and what have you.
They both get caught up on trying to find out who Jack The Ripper was as one of the girls worked as a servant at Audrey's home.
Then it became a thing for Audrey and Thomas to find this mad man to stop the killings.
. .I liked Audrey's uncle even though he was a bit nutty.
I have read other Ripper books whose ending was a big let down.
The end of this book was sad AND morbid.
"Lord help the girl he set those eyes for good. His boyish vulnerability was a weapon, powerful and disarming. I was thankful I wasn't the the kind of girl to lose my mind over a handsome face." I originally gave this two stars, but the more I thought about it, the more pissed off I felt. Stalking Jack the Ripper is what happens if you drop a girl with 21st century "feminist" ideas in the Victorian era. Everything about Audrey Rose, from her speech to her actions, screams 2016. "I had no idea m
Audrey Rose is the only capable woman in the book.
By casting Audrey Rose against this background of intelligent useful men and unmemorable worthless women, you're basically saying, "She's not like other girls.
(It would have so cool if Audrey Rose cracked the case by interviewing prostitutes, lower-class women, etc and then using that information that's usually deemed trivial by men.)Everything happens too conveniently for her.
It's like this white girl who is 1/16 Native American going around, proudly announcing her roots and how she can't possibly be racist, and maybe wearing a Tiger Lily costume for Halloween.
Listen, I am acknowledging this is not the best book ever written. But I am also telling you that I liked reading it a lot.  It is no-holds-barred entertainment with hints of substance underneath that I’m hoping continue to develop .Audrey Rose does autopsies. On cadavers. This is obviously not generally considered acceptable for societal women in 1888. She is kind of not the most street smart person ever and keeps doing things that are completely lacking in common sense. I do not respect or lik
I honestly think my favorite Em, who also has read this book and also really likes Thomas Cresswell, put it best [as usual] - this book was so caught up in showcasing Audrey going against societal rules that it 
My first original thought is that this book could have discussed colonialism way more if it were willing to make Audrey Rose’s dad a more nuanced character.
Okay, the funny thing is that enough people said the killer was obvious “from chapter two” that I was really expecting it to be even more obvious than it was, and I ended up thinking it was the most obvious candidate instead of the actual killer for like half the book, until I finally realized that was just way too obvious.
I wouldn’t go as far as to say that I’m fascinated by the horrifying personage that was Jack the Ripper, but my curiosity (and disgust) cannot help but awake at the mention of him and his doings.Kerri Maniscalco created very ‘‘human’’ characters in this story.
And, secondly, the ‘‘stalking’’ Audrey and Thomas do, for the most part, helps little in the end, and reveals to be more reckless than courageous.
And it’s not exactly ‘‘stalking’’ either, so you know.But, all in all, I don’t regret reading this book, for I had the chance to meet memorable characters and discover a new author with talent in weaving words.

“Wield your assets like a blade, Cousin. No man has invented a corset for our brains. Let them think they rule the world. It’s a queen who sits on that throne. Never forget that. There’s no reason you can’t wear a simple frock to work, then don the finest gown and dance the night away. But only if it pleases you.”   Who else was legitimately obsessed with all 56 Nancy Drew novels, all 21 Famous Five novels, and the 4 classic Sherlock Holmes novels growing up???

All great mysteries hinge on varying degrees of subtlety, something that this book certainly lacks.Having said that, there’s this Canadian crime drama telly series, named Motive, which I love.
Since we were told the identities of the victims and the killer was fairly obvious, I spent the duration of the novel trying to determine the motive behind the killer’s actions.
3.5 Stars!
In the beginning, I absolutely adored the story but as it progressed, I frequently found myself loosing interest.
Serial killers are a huge subject of fascination for me, so I was a little disappointed I didn't enjoy the story as much as everyone else.
It's likely that my own expectations for the novel weren't fulfilled, which is why it wasn't a favorite.
Despite all that, I did still enjoy it.
I think I just would have liked a more developed, in-depth story about investigating one of the most baffling unsolved murder cases in history.
Some of the ending really rubbed me the wrong way, but you can see those details below in the spoiler tag.Aubrey Rose is basically an unconventional female in her society.
I don't feel like I missed out on much.***Minor spoilers below - don't read if you want to keep the mystery alive!***(I'll hide the big ones in the spoiler tag)As far as the ending, I definitely felt a bit of glee knowing I guessed the killer, but aside from that, it was just really sad.
(hide spoiler)]But as far as the set up for the next book, I'm super on board with that.

Murder mysteries are NOT my thing, but this was so much fun and so well written that I... still ended up really enjoying it?! The hype is definitely deserved. "Why must I either be docile and decent, or curious and wretched? I was a decent girl, even if I spent my spare time reading about science theories and dissecting the dead." I loved how sarcastic, witty, and totally capable Audrey Rose was. Sometimes I get annoyed when it feels like a fiercely feminist character from modern times is forced
I was a decent girl, even if I spent my spare time reading about science theories and dissecting the dead."
Sometimes I get annoyed when it feels like a fiercely feminist character from modern times is forced into a historical context, but it absolutely worked here.
And I actually loved all of the characters and how they were all flawed people you'd want to see succeed.
I actually wasn't expecting the plot twist at the end, even though that's who I wanted it to be.
“Pretend I am as capable as a man? Please, sir, do not value me so little!”  Story ⭐⭐⭐⭐Did you ever wonder what it would be like living at the time when Jack the Ripper was roaming the streets of London? And did you maybe think it would be awfully exciting to be part of the investigation? Well, then this is the perfect book for you. Audrey Rose was never the one for living under the rules of society. Women can’t be a medical apprentice? Women are only here to serve their husbands and be good wi
Please, sir, do not value me so little!”  Story ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️Did you ever wonder what it would be like living at the time when Jack the Ripper was roaming the streets of London?
That’s why Audrey Rose becomes an apprentice at her Uncles laboratory.She partners up with the strange but really handsome Thomas Cresswell, who’s also an apprentice of her uncle.
First of all Audrey Rose, the wonderful, strong and intelligent main character, who showed the man in this story that women are more than just beautiful objects.
She didn’t think it was inappropriate to do so.Also I loved her Indian background and the fact she was crazy about Indian foods/snacks.
THE REVIEW IS POSTED*this review fills with minor spoiler. Read at your own risk.*  "Roses have both petals and thorns, my darkflower. You needn't believe something weak because it appears deli-cate. Show the world your bravery."   Wow. I'm so freaking disappointed with this book. Look, I didn't even have high expectation toward the book, because I know my expectations toward books often don't end up well. So I might as well not to expect anything, but the things is, it's really hard not to expe
I think, I would like this book more, if the romance took longer or maybe no romance at all, because I could not feel the romance or the spark between them.
I could find out who the killer was before even reaching 100 pages and when I read the ending, I was like " HAHAHAHAHAHA IT WAS SO PREDICTABLE.
I KNEW IT ALL ALONG." Most of the time when I read the book, I was either bored or falling asleep.
I swear, I had a hard time reading this book.
Absolutely loved the dynamic between Audrey and Thomas.
Like shout out to the finale where Audrey Rose tries to calm everyone down and says "LET'S HAVE TEA AND THINK ABOUT THIS" wow I how she's literally the only sensible person in this book.
I JUST KNOW EVERYTHING I'M LIKE THE EYE OF SAURON.However it was still a downright good book and I want the next one immediately.Also can we take a moment to shout out about how feminist this is?!Obviously sexism is stampeding through the streets because it's 1800s and women are too delicate to do anything but crossstitch.
Recommended to me by this poo, ♡Ninjaflower ♡ and recommended to her (and me) by the lovely, ♡ Johanna ♡ (view spoiler)[ Happy now, guys??! (hide spoiler)]I felt like this book came out of nowhere and took everyone by surprise, I’m truly astonished.

Stalking Jack the Ripper  is narrated by Audrey Rose, a seventeen-year old girl who comes from an affluent family during the late 1880’s.
When an investigation breaks out concerning Jack the Ripper, Audrey Rose gets onto it and finds out that the theories she’s deducing are a  little  too close for comfort.
The book is mysterious, charming (I’m looking at you Thomas), and especially witty.
I absolutely adored the fact that the mystery was perplexing.
Audrey Rose is a delight of a main character.
He’s absolutely hilarious, riling up Audrey in the most charming of ways.
I  loved  the historic-ness of this book.
The family in this story is so well developed; Audrey father’s behaviour fits the time period perfectly while maintaining a perfect balance of love and protection as well as possession that so many parents had over their daughters in those times.
The ending while it didn’t exactly satisfy my need to KNOW who the real Jack the Ripper was it did break my heart by adding an interesting humanization of the ripper that left me super conflicted.
I mean Jack the Ripper was a sexist psycho, and I didn’t want to be emotional over him, but also it’s a testament to the author and her ability to draw such emotion through Audrey Rose and her humility.
I just finished reading the second book and it's making me like this book even though I had a very boring time reading this book. AKSDHSJKFBSDLVBSDFGA nope, not RAIsiNG my rating.Tbh, I would have really liked it if wasn't fucking b00ring, predictable af and just so??? idk boring. The mystery and the forensic science things didn't interest me which is probably why I was so bored. Lowkey liked it because of the teasing, charming flirt Thomas Creswell and Audrey Rose speaking up against those sexist mother fuckers. Other than that everything wAS dull and i didn't enjoy it lmao soz.
1,5* - DNF at 40ish% because this sucks.Not giving it 1 star because the idea had potential and tbh it might have gotten better if I'd continue to read.
But I don't want to.So I was pretty sure I knew who the Ripper was and I didn't want to continue so I skipped to the end and SURPRISE....
This book could've been really good if the love story wasn't this cringy and the love interest wasn't this fucking rude, unlikable and creepy.
Stupid me bought book 2 already because I was so sure I would like this.
That would've been really interesting (and hella fucked up, which I like).
Hello, my name is Jiana and I love Thomas Cresswell to bits and pieces.Now I admit the book was super slow and boring in the middle and I was annoyed by that, and it's probably one of the most predictable books I've ever read in my entire life (I called it the minute the character appeared Oh Yeah) but you know what?
I love the setting, I love the plot, I love the writing, I love the characters and I absolutely can't wait to read the next book!Honestly if anyone's contemplating reading this book, just do it for Thomas Cresswell.Buddy read with my precious Marami.
4/5 STARS!!!FULL REVIEWWhen I saw the title of this book I just knew that I needed to read it.
Books with an intriguing title and plot?
This book contains the topics I really want to delve into.Jack the Ripper.
I also love the characters in this book.
Audrey Rose and Thomas's dynamic personality was one of the reason why I liked this book a lot.
I really admire Audrey Rose because she stands up for feminism and fights for what she wants.
I really liked how he flirts and infuriate Audrey Rose most of the time.
✓ i guessed who it was from the beginning✓ i knew it✓ i fucking knew it✓ someone pls give me an award✓ i want it in the form of $$$ ok ?
nothing else ✓ my ass would make a fine detective like who is sherlock holmes?
✓ jokes, i have nothing on sherlock holmes ✓ but i feel like i was almost at sherlock holmes level though ✓ never knew i'd guess it right✓ makes me so angry that this guessing could've been really useful on tests ✓ also can i have thomas as my watson?
instead plot twist : he's my lover ✓ i ship us Review to come 😊
If you need your heart cut out or, perhaps, lobotomy - we are humbly proposing our services to you.There’s nothing better than a little danger dashed with some romance.Okay, okay, I swear, I was going to start this review with a picture of human anatomy to prove you how serious this book is, and that a knife is not a child's toy (I am referring to the cover where a heroine holds the aforementioned knife rather seductively *whispers* She's even more hotter with the scalpel.
Really interesting novel, but didnt fully grab me! I will be reading book two, because know the story and world has been explained and I have a better understanding of the characters, I think I might enjoy the following books!
"Roses have both petals and thorns, my dark flower. You needn’t believe something weak because it appears delicate. Show the world your bravery.” yeah so ,, this was incredibly disappointing for me and everyone should just go watch the buzzfeed unsolved episode instead BECAUSE SHANE AND RYAN NEVER LET ME DOWN LIKE THIS BOOK DID. this book has so many issues all of which we will be going into later but the thing is, I probably could have overlooked them to some degree if this book was at least e
this book has so many issues all of which we will be going into later but the thing is, I probably could have overlooked them to some degree if this book was at least entertaining but despite this book a murder mystery and based on true crime it was so, so boringI definitely expected this book to have more direction.
And this all leads me to talking about Audrey Rose as a character because going into this I wanted to love her.
And when you look at the actual top suspects for Jack the Ripper most of their motives are driven by gender dynamics which means this book had an interesting oppurtunity to explore that and it DIDN'T.
I really really enjoyed this book, but at times I felt like it dragged on a little bit around the halfway mark but it picked up and I was back to read it full steam ahead.The premise of the book was really interesting with a different twist on the original Jack the Ripper (I’m no expert on this matter however), we see Audrey Rose have to go through certain problems, due to the time it was set it was “un-womanly” to do the things she was interested in, and was expected to behave in a certain way.
