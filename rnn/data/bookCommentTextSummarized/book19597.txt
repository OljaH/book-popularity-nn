The best book in the series by far.
At times it took my breath away.
I'm completely content with how the series ended.
I loved this series and honestly don't think it could have ended on a better note.
I loved this book so freakin much!!!
But they made it through, now they're together, and now my life complete!!!
The whole series is just great!
I couldn't even breath half of the time!
I cannot wait for this spin off series.
I am so excited to see whose tragic love story we will all be obsessing over this time.
It was an electricity charged ride and I was desperate to know how Rose was going to get herself out of her current predicament the entire way!From the very moment Dimitri, Adrian and Eddie broke Rose outta jail, a plan orcastrated by Lissa, Christian and Abe, I might add, I was gone.....Nothing and no one could have stopped me reading.
I love Adrian, I do and it breaks my heart that his and Rose’s relationship had to end the way it did (Rose...seriously, I’d shake you for cheating if I wasn’t so happy you and Dimka are back together), but I just can’t deny that I feel like this is the right outcome.
My speculations on who kills the Queen, I think it's probably Victor Dashkov since he is free now or maybe one of the royals I bet it's Adrian's father.I'm Team Adrian, but if it's going to be like Twilight, then Rose and Dimitri would be together at the end, I'd just hope something happens like Dimitri die or whatever lol.I think if they find Lissa half-brother/sister, then she'll be the next queen for the Moroi Society.I bet Rose will be a fugitive and Abe's the one would help her.I just wish the ending would not be too much of a happy ending like what happens in Breaking Dawn, when they don't fight in the battle so no one major dies.***Thoughts after Reading This One***Note: First I'd like to say that I'm really confused on how to rate this one thus I have two ratings.
Yeah, she does do all of that.Then, of course, is Rose’s great love of public speaking which, once again, pops up in this book.Christian: Hey Rose, did you ever think it might be a good idea to tell the authorities and your friends about who the killer is first, in private, so that some of them aren't publicly humiliated and embarrassed while having their world pulled out from under them in front of hundreds of people?Rose: Er…Christian: Yeah, that’s what I thought…The girl needs to line up at the Ministry of Ridiculous Speeches (right next to the Ministry of Silly Walks) to get public funding every time the council is stupid enough to let her have free reign on a mic.
This is what you need to know.Lissa, Abe, Christian, Adrian, Eddie, Mikhail, and Dimitri break Rose out of jail.
That was a huge surprise…..not.•	Rose rescues Jill and kills Victor, and then proceeds to feel very bad about it, but only for three pages.•	Rose and Dimitri do it, while she is still with Adrian I might add, but don’t worry, it isn’t cheating, because she mentally dumped Adrian before she dropped her knickers.Meanwhile, back at court:•	Lissa has been nominated as a candidate to become queen.•	She takes a series of tests to become queen, which we are privy to via Rose’s ability to snap into her mind.
“What?" I asked uneasily. "Why are you looking at me like that?"He shook his head, the smile rueful now. "Because sometimes, a person can get so caught up in the details that they miss the whole. It's not just the dress or the hair. It's YOU. You're beautiful. So beautiful, it hurts me.”     "His warmth was all around me, as was his love, and again, I felt that completeness. I had that missing piece of my world back. The soul that complemented mine. My match. My equal. "  This was incredible!!
Not only Rose but Dimitri, Lissa and Christian as well.
They all helped Rose and Lissa because they wanted to (except Sydney :P she didn't want to but she helped her anyway) and all of them end up having trouble and broken heart(Adrian)!
She hurt my Adrian :(------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------So many things happened I don't know where to start!1)The escape!As we know Rose is charged for killing Queen Tatiana!
Rose find them and she end up killing Victor.
6)Back at Court, Lissa, Christian, Adrian and Abe try looking for Tatiana's murderer and they suspected Daniella.
They end up make love and she cheated Adrian.
But in the end, she turned out just like the rest of them: self-absorbed and as annoying as hell.
Hey, Rose, ever hear of a little thing called "humility"?
I could go on and on, really, about all the sentence that annoyed me on every page, but I have feeling this review is already tedious.In this book, Rose is kind of like a less-awesome version of Leeroy Jenkins without the chicken.
Bad form.Another thing I found annoying was the constant back-and-forth between Rose and the court.
Doesn't Rose being like the ADHD's five-year-old that she is, get a little tired of that?
omg!! the title is scaring the heck outta me!! oh richelle....please please let rose and dimitri be together, i think i will go into depression if not, i really feel for these characters!! i love them so much. i hope the spin off is adrian's story, though its probably not gonna be. *keep ur fingers crossed and hope!* i love how i wait for each of these books for a whole yr, read it in one day when i get and then the wait starts ALL OVER AGAIN!! gahhhh!! kill me!gosh...never suffered even half this much anxiety over twilight!
I dont know why everyones forgetting the most important character of allADRIAN IVASHKOVwhat will happen to him if Rose and Dimitri get back together???Will he turn gay or something???
. Cheating/adultery are no way justifiable; I don’t give a flying rat’s ass if you happen to meet your soul mate, it’s still immoral so I don’t understand why this daft author think she can get away with it- considering your book is aimed at teenagers.→ Also the digression of Tasha’s character- Tasha is supposed to be fierce, intelligent and strong yet we see her as a crazed, jealous bitch that loved Dimitri and tried to frame that goldigging slut through royal assassination because she couldn’t stand the fact that she lost to a stupid, dumbass whore?
I don't know what happened between the first time I read this book and this time but the first time I rated it 5 stars and now I can't get over the fact that Rose played Adrian and acted like a immature selfish girl.
It really bugged me this time that one minute she would go on about loving Adrian and the next she would be like Dimitri is the love of my life.
One minute she was kissing Adrian and the next she was having sex with Dimitri.
The plot was good but the Adrian, Dimitri thing bugged me so much that I had a hard time really enjoying it.
Well, that was such a pretty incredible conclusion of the Vampire Academy series!I waited for months before I read Last Sacrifice because I grew really fond of this series since I started it and I hate the separation anxiety I always get whenever I read a final book of a series that I love.
I also love the mystery involved in this book.
And did I say Lissa's character really improved here?I love everything here in this book, I just wished there was a different kind of ending between Rose and Adrian.
Actual Rating: 4.5 - rounded up for overall enjoyment level.Well, my emotions are all over the place and I don't think I'll ever be able to write a coherent review for this book because this series man.
Took me two years to finish this series, and while I had long droughts of not reading it, I was always happy to get back into the world and now I'm done and what the hell.
I just loved all the character development in this series and with a series this long, that is always what I look for.
I might eventually read Bloodlines because I know people will ask.
Book 3 was my favorite and it was just a meh series from there on out.
The main reason I dislike this series is because I think Rose is SOOOO annoying and immature.
Thinking that maybe she would develop throughout the series, I kept giving her second chances, but she's just as childish and impulsive in book 6 as she was in book 1.
This book's plot was kinda boring and I found it predictable a little bit and I really found myself not caring too much about the drama and mystery.
No. Do I think I'll pick up Bloodlines, the spin-off?
I have a feeling that Rose is going to come threw and find Lissa's sibling so that she gets her seat on the Royal Court and I also think she could potentially be the next queen.
Option one is that is is Rose's sacrifice because clearly she already has sacrificed so much and she is going to sacrifice her career has a guardian to be with Dimitri.
If this happens then I think Rose and Adrian will end up getting married and having children and they will live at court and Lissa and Christian will be there too.
No matter how many time I read these books it will always be one of my top 5 favorite series EVER!
Read the series.
So beautiful, it hurts me.” “She was right about something else too," Dimitri said after a long pause.
This one broke my 💔“I loved you!" he yelled.
You took my heart and ripped it up.” (view spoiler)[All that matters is Rose and Dimitri get there HEA♥Lissa and Christian get there HEA♥And If you wanna see Adrian get his HEA♥ (hide spoiler)]I guess you'd better start reading Bloodlines Series 😉.["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>
i definitly think abe will get her out of jail at the court because they wouldn't continuously mention the fact he is like a big bad ass and has all these connections ...
i think dimitri will finally snap out of his trance and realise that rose doesn't care about what he did and yeah he was evil but not by choice...
i also think that theres something fishy about Tasha Ozera throughout the books i kinda thought she was a pointless character but i think she could possibly come out in this book and could possibly be Rose's enemy...
why would she vote to have rose as her guardian knowing that shes Lisa's???...
Don't get me wrong I am happy for Rose and Dimitri but did they have to remain guardians.
If Lissa was not crowned queen or Rose and Dimiti leaving court that would have been fine.
I think Adrian killed Queen Tatiana because he wants to be King.
Once Rose is out of the picture, Lissa will be an easier target.
As far as his feelings for Rose, I think its a facade.
She is just another Dhampir notch on his belt.Adrian could have enter the Queen's chamber unnoticed.
Dimitri may indeed be Rose knight in shining armour.
I predicted everything.
Plus, she hit on Dimitri, which made me hate her.
NO ONE BUT ME (and, ok, maybe Rose too) CAN HIT ON DIMITRI!".
It was brutally real and totally heartbreaking in places, but it was never predictable.
I loved every minute of it, and it was definitely my favourite book in the entire series.
Dimitri and Rose in this...
even if it is just out of five!P.S I would bet my house that the spin off series will be about Adrian falling in love with Sydney.
I'm psychic, remember?Later Note: Wow. Adrian/Sydney spin off happened.
im currently going through VA withdrawal, wow this series was SPECTACULAR!! A MUST read!
(OK, I knew Lissa's sibling was going to be Jill, but that's just me and my uncanny ability at guessing endings.) Rose, Dimitri and Sonya (Sydney has been cap agetured at this point & the Brothers Dashkov have abducted Jill) then hunt down Victor, Robert and Jill.
Not. Well, it was our ever-adorable Tasha Ozera, the aunt of Lissa's beloved, Christian, who killed the queen of the vampire world just to change an age rule and frame Rose, the slutty seventeen year old who stole Dimitri (oh, sorry, Dimka -_-) from her.
;)So, this is the final instalment in the Vampire Academy series, and I was a bit disappointed, I think I kind of fell out of love with this series after or maybe even during book four.
Last Sacrifice is a good book, but not a great book, or a particularly 'amazing' end to a series, which I was holding out hope for, but never truly expected I'd get after reading books 4 and 5.
I was content with most aspects of the ending, however found the whole Lissa thing extremely predictable, though I am glad that happened.Bye, bye Vampire Academy, I'm so happy I've finished you, and I'm sorry our relationship turned a bit sour towards the end...Order from favourite to least favourite1.
Personally, I'd rather have an ending where I could ponder the characters' futures for myself than follow them for the rest of my life.This book, however, cements my desire to see the journeys ahead for a few characters -- namely, Adrian the Moroi spirit user with the vice habits and Sydney the Alchemist who aided Rose through quite a few misadventures.
(I'm also interested in an unusual Moroi by the name of Angeline; I'm certain Mead has plans for her as well.) The next VA series is set to be third-person, so chances are more likely than not that we'll see POVs from Adrian and Sydney at some points.
I can't imagine what it must be like to write a book that has to be exactly right, because let's face it, nobody wants to be the next Smeyer.
But I do know what it is like to read one and I think Richelle Mead pulled it off, more or less.
But the entire thing felt a bit like Rose was yelling "Here I come to save the daaaaaaay!" on every page.I think it was very obvious what was going to happen between Rose and Dimitri in this book.
That was not the way I wanted to say goodbye to Adrian.
Και τώρα πώς θα αντέξω να διαβάσω άλλο βιβλίο στο οποίο δεν θα πρωταγωνιστεί η Ρόουζ;Γι' αυτό και το τέλος ήταν γλυκόπικρο για μένα, αφενός επειδή οι περιπέτειες τελείωσαν και αφετέρου για λόγους που ευθύνεται η αγαπημένη Ρόουζ.
(view spoiler)[Φέρθηκε απαράδεκτα στον Άντριαν, και τον αγαπώ πολύ για να τον βλέπω στενοχωρημένο!
Ο γλυκός μου έκανε τόσες προσπάθειες και ήταν ο μόνος που δεν πήρε το χάπι εντ.
Στην ουσία ήταν αυτό που τα κορίτσια επιθυμούσαν.Γενικά μου αρέσει στο τέλος να σοκάρομαι και να πονάω.
Φυσικά και ήθελα το αγαπημένο μου χάπι εντ για Romitri αλλά ήθελα μωρέ να δω και μία θυσία της προκοπής.
I was originally going to give this three stars because of lingering fondness for this series plus the fact that despite stupid plot threads, it did jump quickly enough from point to point that it wasn't boring, per se.
When Dmitri keeps protesting that they can't be together she can't see any possible reason why they couldn't hook up, because the old problems (she was too young, he was her teacher, they had to focus on Lissa) weren't true anymore.
Was there never a good answer or after the third book Mead just got lazy and stopped trying to be coherent?
People who have read this series PLEASE DON'T ABANDON ME WITH MY FEELINGS come talk to me.I'm sobbing here, I actually thought there was something wrong with me because I've been feeling like I couldn't truly connect to characters in YA anymore, especially their romance.
But this series just showed me that the problem is not me, it's the lack of development and depth in so many other books out there.
I wish other well developed series like Vampire Academy got more recognition so I'd find out about them.My babies have been through so much already, but thank goodness for Bloodlines.
Richelle Mead wrapped up this storyline in the best way I could have anticipated and regardless of what team you’re on… if you’re Team Rose, I think you’ll be satisfied.I’ve rooted for Rose’s character from book one; and as much as Blood Promise and Spirit Bound had me doubting the development of this series, I never wavered in my allegiance to this main character.
I was happy with the conclusion and I’ll read this entire series over again to experience Rose’s journey from day one.
Αν και βιαζόμουν να ολοκληρώσω τη σειρά τώρα μετανιώνω για την ανυπομονησία μου…Αγάπησα τόσο τους χαρακτήρες και τον κόσμο που έπλασε η Richelle Mead. Θα μπορούσα να ξεκινήσω το Bloodlines αλλά δεν θα είναι η ίδια αίσθηση, δεν θα ενεδρεύω στο μυαλό της Ρόουζ.Θα ήθελα να το βαθμολογήσω με πέντε αστέρια αλλά κατεμέ αξίζει τέσσερα. Perquè? Perquè κάποια κεφάλαια ήταν ψιλοαδιάφορα (δεν με ικανοποίησε διόλου η εξήγηση της δολοφονίας), δεν περιείχε τα τρελά plot twist του τρίτου ή τέταρτου βιβλίου και
Αν και βιαζόμουν να ολοκληρώσω τη σειρά τώρα μετανιώνω για την ανυπομονησία μου…Αγάπησα τόσο τους χαρακτήρες και τον κόσμο που έπλασε η Richelle Mead.
O Ντιμίτρι Μπελίκοφ δεν φημίζεται για την εξωτερίκευση των συναισθημάτων του αλλά….όταν ρίχνει τα τείχη που έχει ορθώσει συμβαίνει κάτι μαγικό.
Είσαι όμορφη.
Τόσο όμορφη, που πονάω».
Κάθε επαφή του με την Ρόουζ ήταν μία αφύπνιση του πραγματικού εαυτού, των θαμμένων συναισθημάτων του που πάλευαν να βγουν στην επιφάνεια.
Ένιωσα δάκρυα να μαζεύονται στις βλεφαρίδες και να θέλουν να τρέξουν στα μάγουλά μου.
Όλη η σειρά ήταν ένα υπέροχο αναγνωστικό ταξίδι που θα το ξαναζήσω στο άμεσο μέλλον.
I have waited what seemed like an eternity to read Last Sacrifice.
You saved the day AND got the hottest guy in the sack *HIGH FIVES* TO ADRAIN  I thought you took your break up with Rose horribly.
Even Jake from  TWILIGHT didn't chuck that big of a tantrum when Bella ultimately went back to Edward.
I know that like Edward v Jake there are also Dimitri v Adrian fans.
But also like Twilight the story would always come down to Rose and Dimitri.
P.s Only thing that got me down was the ending with Adrian and Rose.
