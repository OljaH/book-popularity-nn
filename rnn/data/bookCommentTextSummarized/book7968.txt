I'm a huge fan of science fiction that doesn't seem too far away, something that I could imagine lingering just around the corner after a few more scientific experiments - and that's how I feel about Flowers for Algernon, I can imagine it as a possibility and that makes it all the more meaningful for me.This story is about Charlie Gordon who with an IQ of 68 can only hope to sweep the floors at the bakery...
Memories that had been forgotten come flooding back, bringing pain with them.Flowers for Algernon looks at so many different things: mental disabilities, human nature, intelligence and love.
Heartbreaking and beautiful. Required reading, as far as I am concerned.
I don't even know what to say I can't stop crying because of how things are for Charlie and I guess I just wish that they way he was treated wasnt so close to reality.
Also it's kind of painful to have to question things like intimacy vs intelligence and self actualization which are brought up so poignantly in the book.
I don't even know if anything I'm saying is making any sense but the book really got to me and now I need to be alone to cry and consolidate myself with it and the new ideas it has made me consider.
What I didn't know at the time was the people who created the text book I used felt it was okay to chop whole chapters out of the middle of the book.
When I reread the book more recently, there were more things that I realized would have been chopped out of a version intended for 8th grade students to read, and I just hadn't noticed as much the first time reading the complete copy because they were tucked in with the more mundane things towards the beginning of Charlies developments.All ranting aside, I find this book to be a fascinating look at human nature, personality and development.
I gifted this book to him last Christmas and he finally got to read it.
He was as deeply moved by this magnificent heart wrenching novel as I was and he felt the need to send me a message when he finished to tell how impressed he was.
It was the first time he sent me an emotional message about a book so with his permission, I will paste here most of his words: "Intelligence, a gift or a course?
I read it in the plane and I felt a little embarrassed when I started to weep at the end of the book.
When Charlie Gordon, a mentally disabled man, undergoes an experiment to increase his intelligence, his life changes in ways he never imagined.
But will the intelligence increase be permanent.I first became aware of Flowers for Algernon when it was mentioned in an episode of Newsradio.
As Charlie's intelligence grew, eventually surpassing even the scientists that experimented on him, his feelings of isolation increased and I felt a lot of kinship toward Charlie.
Keyes doesn't mind kicking you in the emotional junk, that's for sure.I love the way the book is written in periodic progress reports from Charlie.
There are several wonderfully memorable characters, particularly the free-living artist living next door.The journal technique is quite effective in bringing the reader into the story and conveying Charlie's intelligence level, using spelling and grammar as superficial clues and the sophistication of Charlie's observations as a deeper clue to his current intelligence level.
I liked the balance between first-person immediacy and thoughtful retrospective that the format of a journal entry at the end of each day or two provides.The reader's growing ability to understand Charlie and Charlie's attempts to understand himself touch on the exploration of alienness and human reactions to it that underpin so many great science fiction stories.
Omg!!!!! I can't even!! Mel 🖤🐾🐺
what a great read! I sort of feel like it was too simple, but still an enjoyable enough book.
These are the sort of SF books that I would recommend to those who look down on the genre.This book explores such themes as the nature of intelligence, the effects of intelligence on the way you see others and the world around you, as well as social attitudes towards people with mental problems.
This has certainly changed the way I think about people with mental problems.
Captivating and heartbreaking.Daniel Keyes 1958 novel about an intellectually disabled man who, through an experimental medical procedure, gains genius level IQ is a classic of science fiction.Charlie Gordon began attending classes at night for “retarded adults” so that he could learn to read and to “be like other people”.
With the assistance of his night school teacher, he is interviewed by scientists and is accepted into the experimental program.At the laboratory he meets Algernon, a mouse who has undergone a similar treatment and who can traverse a series of mazes faster than Charlie.
The protagonist, Charlie Gordon, has his IQ increased via a surgical procedure from that of a barely functional mentally retarded person to superhuman intelligence and writes the book in first person based on his experience.
The procedure was first tried on lab mouse Algernon who the protagonist befriends and who is a litmus test of what he experiences.
Nota bene: At WebSummit in Lisbon this week, Bryan Johnson spoke of his new venture (after the $1B sale of Braintree to PayPal some years back) about bringing this kind of cognitive enhancement into the real world, but based on Charlie's experience, this terrorized rather than excited me.
Having been cast aside by his family, most notably his mother, much of Charlie's thoughts and actions throughout the book are a result of how he was treated and rebuked as a child and his desire to be viewed as a "normal" individual.
Feeling confident in their positive results with a mouse named Algernon, the experts are prepared to make the first step with this experimental surgery in humans and agree that Charlie is an ideal candidate.
Book Review  4 out of 5 stars to Flowers for Algernon, a classic novella written in 1966 by Daniel Keyes, often read in high school as standard curriculum in America. A few shorter versions of the story exist, as well as film or TV adaptions for those who want to compare the literary art with the visual. I enjoyed this book when I read it the first time and even returned to reading the shorter version during a college English course. If you're not familiar with it, it's the story of Charlie, w
If you're not familiar with it, it's the story of Charlie, who at the time when this was written, may have been called "mentally slow." If this took place in current times, it'd be a very different approach to both telling the story and to trying to help Charlie.
So the book must be read and interpreted based on it being written nearly 50 years earlier.Charlie takes his time understanding everything around him, but at his core, you immediately see that he's a good guy.
No spoilers here, so you'll have to read it to see what happens to the mouse and to Charlie.
But I definitely think it's something people who enjoy reading should give a chance to.
I cannot control it completely, but sometimes when I'm busy reading or working on a problem, I get a feeling of intense clarity.I know it's some kind of subconsious warning system." He is surprised to find that Norma still lives with Rose, and that Norma neither hates him, nor is the vicious person he had expected her to be, but on the contrary is overjoyed to see him, having believed that Charlie had died at the Warren State Home a long time ago.
Zeki olmanın avantajlarının ve dezavantajlarının ütopik bir senaryoda ele alındığı dokunaklı, hatta dramatik denebilecek harika bir kitap. Yazar etik, bilim gibi konuları ve hatta kendi hayatımızı sorgulamaya teşvik ediyor.
Reading it again many years later, I'm not surprised that it is powerful, but I am surprised at just how complete the story is.
There were parts of the story that stuck with me all these years: Charlie's belief that his life would be better if he were somehow more intelligent and the heartache of his return to his former condition.
Wasn't Charlie able to experience a life which somehow existed beyond his abilities (sort of like Lt. Barclay in Star Trek the Next Generation's Nth Degree episode)?
من نمی‌دونم چرا ولی اون می‌گه که این برای اینکه اون‌ها بفهمند که می‌تونند من رو استفاده کنند یا نه مهمه.
اِینکم رو زدم و بعد گفتم بزار اون کارت رو دوباره ببینم، شرت می‌بندم این دفعه پیداش می‌کنم.؛من خیلی تلاش کردم ولی بازهم نتونستم اَکس‌ها رو پیدا کنم فقط لکه‌های جوهر رو دیدم.

Meaning I was surprised to realize the majority of my Goodreads friends had already read a book that I had never heard of before.
One reviewer mentioned the abridged version he read in school had trimmed all the sexual bits.
Whenever my colleagues heard he was going to apply for a certain scholarship, we would all groan, because it meant we didn’t have a chance.
(I will proudly interject that just once I won a scholarship for which he also applied.
Why, oh why, did I want to date him so badly?Keyes gave me an inside peek into how it might be for Cheddar and his fellow cheeses.
It's funny how things often come in pairs. Braveheart and Rob Roy. Armageddon and Deep Impact. Dangerous Liaisons and Valmont. And quite often, the better one of the pair isn't the one that ends up becoming famous.Flowers for Algernon's twin is Thomas Disch's  Camp Concentration . Both novels were published within a few months of each other. Both are first-person narratives, presented as a series of diary entries written by the main character. Both address the same question: suppose a medical pr
What would happen?Now given the rules of the game, how are you going to present the narrator getting smarter?
Keyes picked the obvious solution: in this book, Charlie Gordon starts off real dumb.
Charlie is given the procedure, and he starts getting smarter.
Charlie's always had a crush on the nice teacher at his evening class, but he's never been able to do a thing about it.
He meets a brilliant woman artist and starts up a new relationship with her.
He can no longer read the things he's just written.
But somehow I prefer Disch's ambitious failure to Keyes's easy success.
The women in his life are The Cruel Mother, The Whore, and The Angel.
(One of the reasons this book screams the 60s is because The Angel is ok with his relationship with The Whore.
Can we tell the author was a man and the book was written in the era of "free love"?) All of this in a book that is supposed to be about a man coming to grips with new found intelligence without turning into an intellectual jerk and divining the REAL NATURE of the women in his life.
On Intelligence Are there any qualities that should make a man consider himself superior from other humans? In medieval times, a physically strong man would consider himself superior to physically weaker one. A rich person would look down upon a poor person. And a more attractive person would consider himself to one who wasn't - and those with physical handicaps like a hunchback, blind or deaf would be made to face prejudice. A lot of it is still true but now I think at least now the best of m
A lot of it is still true but now I think at least now the best of minds don't think that physical strength, good looks or wealth don't make a person superior and that these qualities are largely things one is born with - gifts from God, chance or nature according to your belief.But it isn't so with intelligence (actually 'intelligence' as the word is popularly used - to mean logical intelligence and good memory; there are other forms of intelligence - read about them here; needless to say I am dumb in all of them) - we still think intelligence as something hard earned rather than a gift.
More than anything else, Flowers for Algernon is thought provoking. It's also sad when it needs to be, enjoyable for the most part, and often comical. Although it casts a gloomy aspect over the meaning of life, it's somehow still uplifting and motivational.It makes you think about, if you know the end--that you're going to die--is there really a point to carrying on? And even with conditions as extraordinary as Charlie Gordon's, Daniel Keyes, explores that question vividly--through this expertly written narrative.
The procedure goes well and he becomes exceptionally bright, during this brief time many lessons are learnt, although he becomes a genius in terms of I.Q he learns he is still emotionally stunted, he can't always manage his emotions in a rational way and many discoveries with regressions into his painful past come to light causing Charlie to reevaluate the decision of taking part in the experiment, just as he makes some progress forward in his personal relationships things take a downward turn and the tables reverse again.
This review is for the full novel version of Flowers for Algernon, as opposed to the original Hugo Award-winning short story, which I've reviewed in more detail here. I prefer the short story over this novel, which felt like it contained a lot of filler that, in the end, wasn't particularly memorable for me. It's still a great story, either way, but the original short story version had a lot more impact on me.Full disclosure: I read the full novel version many years ago, as a young adult, maybe even as a teen, so this is based on old memories.
"My name is Charlie Gordon I werk in Donners bakery..."Daniel Keyes' Flowers for Algernon has been a fascinating, heartbreaking, psychologically stimulating and thought provoking read.
Flowers for Algernon also provides great insights into human behavior and nature.
A must read."All I can do now is keep recording my mental state as objectively as possible, remembering that this psychological journal will be the first of its kind, and possibly the last."Flowers for Algernon is about the extraordinary and unprecedented journey of 32 year old Charlie Gordon.
Charlie narrates these experiences through his journals.
Everyone saw it, and one girl, I can’t remember her name, had a Charly protective book cover and was so obsessed with the movie that she’d write the name, with the backwards “R” on everything, including adding it as a middle name to her own name on tests and papers she would hand in.
As Charlie watches, the busboy drops some dishes and the restaurant manager comes over and begins verbally abusing the boy who cowers in terror of being hit.
Our humanity isn't a measure of our intelligence, but rather whether or not we can remember flowers for Algernon.Flowers for Algernon is a beautiful story.
His change from a retarded to a genius is beautifully conveyed by his improved spelling, grammar, sentence constructions, reflections and the way he relates and connects to his surroundings (and also how they relate to him in return).
His journey is a tragic one, filled with regrets, hopes and dreams.This is one of the most heart-breaking stories that I have ever read.
I read it first time in high school (the original short story) back in the late 80s/early 90s, and I haven't been able to let go of it since.
Why have I never read this before?
It captivated me totally.
I actually read it in one sitting because I could not bear to put it down so I am now totally sleep deprived but very happy.
What a wonderful book despite its sad but necessary ending.
I was so glad the author did not try for a fake happy solution to Charlie's problems because in real life there is none.
At the same time there is a steady theme of human kindness throughout the book which gives us hope.
Keyes cleverly chooses to write the story in the first person so we can see the change in Charlie’s intelligence through the writing which starts off with poor spelling, language and grammar until, following the surgery, it improves until it’s perfect.
I also feel like Keyes didn’t fully explore the possibilities of Charlie’s genius IQ and that this was done better in the Bradley Cooper movie Limitless which had a similar premise and was obviously inspired in part by Keyes’ novel.
