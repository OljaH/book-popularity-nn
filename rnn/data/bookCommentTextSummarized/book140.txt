A couple of weeks ago, we were discussing literary criticism in class and one of my professors said writers like Agatha Christie or Arthur Conan Doyle weren't as good as Raymond Chandler and others - whose names I don't recall now since I'm not into crime/mystery fiction that much - because they didn't focus on the psychological aspect of the mystery, so the narrative became this mechanical thing with similar problems solved by an outstanding intellect. I haven't read much but I see his point. A
A couple of weeks ago, we were discussing literary criticism in class and one of my professors said writers like Agatha Christie or Arthur Conan Doyle weren't as good as Raymond Chandler and others - whose names I don't recall now since I'm not into crime/mystery fiction that much - because they didn't focus on the psychological aspect of the mystery, so the narrative became this mechanical¹​ thing with similar problems solved by an outstanding intellect.
This first appearance of Miss Marple sets her up perfectly as an elderly lady whom others tend to overlook, yet those sharp eyes and that razor of a brain mean she doesn't miss a thing. She's always able to use someone in St. Mary Mead as an example of why she could figure something out-- which leads me to think that that little village is much wilder and woolier than Miss Marple would like anyone to know!
Here we meet Miss Marple, surrounded by bright young things and serious older ones. Almost overlooked in the sudden idea to form the Tuesday Night Club, she knits away and solves the mystery, having seen the red flag as the story was told and recognised who was the culprit and why. There is also a satisfying parallel with events in St Mary Mead. It is a beautifully paced and controlled short story with a mystery within the story. Very brief and concise story-telling and characters sketched with a few quick strokes of the pen.
This wasn't amazing, but ofc it was interesting. I find about all Agatha Christie shorts interesting, so it doesn't take much. This one just didn't have the normal wow factor that I feel like is included in most of her stories. I would read it if I wanted something quick to pick up, but otherwise it's easy to skip.
The first short story featuring Miss Marple. It's a very simple short story, but with a very good plot. Group of 6 friends, one tells a true crime story and the others try to figure out how it was done. A great introduction to the wonderful character of Miss Marple.
Miss Marple's debut! Loved it!
I have the short story collection Love Miss Marple
Interesting premise: The Tuesday Club Murders. I believe there are six stories told by six people who are currently sitting in Miss Marples living room. Story number one is average.
This was a Miss Marple that I had never read before. It was okay.
I love having more Miss Marple! I got a bit angry when everyone gather dismissed my home girl at first, but Miss Marple did not fail to make the eat their thoughts on her.
Clev Miss MarpleA fun little mystery to introduce the world to clever Miss Marple in a short story. I just love her!
Miss Maple such a smart cookie for her age.
What can I say?! I am a total sucker for a good mystery and no one supplies that (nor the solution) quite as satisfyingly as A. C.
I'm setting out to read (or in some cases reread) the Miss Marple collection and this seems like the obvious starting point; a nice, short introduction that, to the best of my recollection, sets the tone for the rest of the series.Miss Marple herself takes a backseat to the plot that invades her parlor as the eponymous Tuesday Night Club forms around her and sets out to armchair-detect their way through an, until recently, unsolved mystery. Of course, despite the abundant contemporary intelligence surrounding her, it's Miss Marple who comes up with the 'obvious' solution.
Miss Marple made her debut in this very short story. The Tuesday night club is a group of friends including Miss Marple’s egotistical, author nephew and a retired head of Scotland Yard. The after dinner talk turns to unsolved mysteries. Before the rest of the group really knows what’s hit them, Miss Marple has solved the crime and returned to her knitting. Quick and fun read!
As a story, it's... a bit threadbare. A crime is described, several people sit around and think about how it might have been done, each presents his or her theory, one of them is right. Not much there. As an introduction to a character--this is Miss Marple's first intro--it's more interesting, and definitely whets my appetite for more.
Miss Marple: the Complete Short StoriesRating System:* couldn't finish, ** wouldn't recommend, *** would recommend, **** would read again, ***** have read again
Not much good.
Pretty sure this is what I read. I found it online. Even if it was a short story IN a short story, this is the first one I actually solved!
This is a fun fast read that has Miss Marple giving us the scoop on a murder by poisoning.
Great intro to Miss Marple
I love miss marple, so there's no questioning here. id rather start with a full novel though.
