The sad thing is I believed Julian's love for Penelope as it grew in obsession more than Daniel's love for Beatriz which seemed a happy chance of lust.Themes of devils and angels are prevalent as characters save and ruin each others' lives.
Take Julian the angel child bringing life (love, novels) who turned into the devil Lain Coubert bringing death (destruction, fear).
At one point it seemed bad things happened to Julian for nothing else than this love of tragedies.
One Friday, after work, I took sanctuary in The Hotel Biron, those little tables in the dark, pages flickering with candles and drank a glass of wine in solitude, completely enthralled in the world of 1940's Barcelona.I walked home from the train at night and found myself saying the characters names beneath my umbrella, hoping no one would hear me talking to myself, but they were, quite simply, too beautiful to ignore: Julian Carax, Daniel Semepere, Beatriz...Tomas, Penelope Aldaya and Nuria Monfort.In a movie this would be too many people, but for this novel they were perfectly seamed, each point of view more entralling and taxing than the one before.Most refreshing, clearly the author wasn't poisoned with the desire to simply keep the reader in the dark: instead this story, with attention, was something you could figure out--because that's the way life is.
The fact is that I’ll never be able to write a real review for this book.
I’m not good enough.
I’m not now and I’ll never be.
It doesn’t matter how many books you have read or how smart you are, you’ll never be good enough for that.
You won’t be able to find exact words and it’s not just you.
Only person who can is the author himself, but I think he already said everything he wanted.
Don’t believe me?

The fact is that I’ll never be able to write a real review for this book.
-	“Books are mirrors - you only see in them what you already have inside you.” -	“The moment you stop to think about whether you love someone, you've already stopped loving that person forever.” -	“A story is a letter that the author writes to himself, to tell himself things that he would be unable to discover otherwise.” -	“There are few reasons for telling the truth, but for lying the number is infinite.” -	“In the shop we buy and sell them, but in truth books have no owner.
The best thing about the book, in my opinion, is Zafon's skill in artistic writing.
Ironically, one the more obvious flaws is Zafon's overuse of stylistic writing.
Zafon does a good job creating a sense of mystery early on, and there are obvious parallels between the main character Daniel Sempere, and Julian Carax, the writer whose past he is trying to uncover.
By far the most troublesome flaw is the way the mysteries are "resolved".
All too often, answers are given by having some side character or another tell his or her story for pages.

Fourth reading: May 7-17, 2017Of course I love this book soooo much.
If you haven't already read this at my suggestion, WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?!Third reading: May 14-21, 2016Second reading: May 23-25, 2015-Okay, I can confidently say, upon re-reading this, that it is one of my all-time favorite books.
You won't regret it.First read: May 12-17, 2014-Everything about this novel was captivating.
From there, the novel follows Daniel as he begins to learn more about the illusive author, Julian Carax, and about the web of lies and intrigue that he gets trapped in.The writing is absolutely gorgeous.
Welcome to The Cemetery of the Forgotten BooksChoose one book. But be aware, you may get trapped into its pages, as The Shadow of the Wind “As it unfolded, the structure of the story began to remind me of one of those Russian dolls that contain innumerable diminishing replicas of itself inside. Step by step the narrative split into a thousand stories, as if it had entered a gallery of mirrors, its identity fragmented into endless reflections.” And for me, by the end..after these long pages and s
But our protagonist and narrator, Daniel, didn't know searching for the real life story of Carax and his mystery will lead him into very tangled stories that will also get tangled with his own story.....even his own fate...It's a story about Tangled Characters and Fates..and while Daniel's searching the truth about Carax, he meet with different characters, and a new odd friend, Fermín Romero de Torres who met accidentally with him as a beggar turned out to be fugitive of Inspector Javier Fumero a corrupt and fascist police inspector as many in these hard times and upheaval that was facing Barcelona.Fermín became a good useful assistance for him and his father ,and who help Daniel searching for Carax story...but things isn't easy when Inspector Fumero is there ,and nit just for Fermín, but for bigger secret from the past of Carax himself.And it's not only one with secrets...there's Nuria Monfort with her sad life in shadows..
riveting.
mysterious.
haunting.
imaginative.
charming.
sentimental.the list of adjectives is endless.
and while this book was all of these, the one thing that i will forever remember about this book is how it made me appreciate the art of storytelling.
i didnt feel like i was reading a novel; i felt as if someone very dear was sitting next to me and telling me their favourite tale.
i was enamoured with the nuances of the language and swept up with all the action.
it was an absolute pleasure to experience such a well-told story.
truly a masterpiece in every way possible.
I can't believe someone actually published this book.
The prose is so overblown that the author uses three adjectives for every single noun.
Every character in this book speaks with exactly the same voice.
All you hear is the authors voice, not any different characterizations.
And that voice demonstrates the problems I described in my first and second points.
There is an even worse, and definitely fatal, problem with this book.Fourth.
Unfortunately, after three quarters of the book, and numerous new characters, the mystery is no clearer.
The author is such a terrible writer that he can't even solve his own mystery.
It's been a couple years since I read this book so I shouldn't and won't go into details, but the effect has lingered all this time.
There's no other book I'm quicker to recommend than this one.
It's not that it's particularly important in a lot of the ways "important" books are, it's just that it works as pure reading pleasure (and sometimes, isn't that enough?); so I find reviews from people desperate to discover structural flaws and stylistic cliches to be totally missing the point.
Buy it new, breathe in the perfume of those pages, tell your friends and family you're going to be busy for a few days and disappear into it.

Rereading the series in preparation for one of my most anticipated releases of the year, The Labyrinth of the Spirits.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<><>~~~~~~~~~~ALL THE STARS.⭐ ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐Welcome to The Cemetery of Forgotten Books.** Hauntingly beautiful.** Gothic & atmospheric.** A book about the love of books.what more could a reader ask for?** And the best part? This book was never even on my radar until I heard someone talk about it by chance. I was intrigued by what they said and bought i
So begins an incredible journey that carries Daniel through a gothic city filled with fantastic bookstores, exotic cafes, abandoned mansions and spirit-haunted graveyards.-- The book itself has two main stories: that of Julian Carax and Daniel Sempere, written in the first person by both.
The book is populated with a cast of characters filled with dark and mysterious pasts, the tortured souls, guilt-ridden lovers, doomed and solitary eccentrics and more.
His dark, mysterious character takes monumental twists and turns as his story slowly unravels to be one of tortured past and full of heartache.
For book lovers it is perfect because it revolves around the mysteries of a little known author (Julian Carax) that the main protagonist, Daniel, stumbles across in a secret stash of literature called the Cemetery of Forgotten books.
But, the payoff from getting immersed in the thick narrative is totally worth the extra time in the end.Lovers of books, lovers of historical fiction, lovers of mysteries with shocking twists, lovers of complex romance/revenge story lines, lovers of ultimate good vs evil battles - step right in to The Cemetery of Forgotten Books .
Hoy se celebra el 15 aniversario de la publicación de esta maravillosa obra de arte, que no me canso de recomendar.  Todavía recuerdo aquel amanecer en que mi padre me llevó por primera vez a visitar el Cementerio de los Libros Olvidados. Porque cinco estrellas no me alcanzan para la constelación mayor que quiero armar en este firmamento digital, porque pase las cuatro de la mañana devorando frases, párrafos, paginas, hojas y capítulos como un hombre que ha estado hambriento de arte por bastante
No podía evitar pensar que si yo, por pura casualidad, había descubierto todo un universo en un solo libro desconocido entre la infinidad de aquella necrópolis, decenas de miles más quedarían inexplorados, olvidados para siempre.
...por eso y por cuantas cosas más estoy seguro he olvidado nombrar, recomiendo este libro a todo el mundo.
That is exactly what The Shadow of The Wind did.Right off the bat the plot intrigued me, Daniel Sempere is taken to the a secret labyrinth of forgotten books - the place where books are brought for their final rest after the world has forgotten their existence - and told by his father to pick one to always care for and protect.
The writing is almost poetic yet simple to follow and enjoy, their are subplots that run alongside the major plot so the book isn't one dimensional and boring.Overall this is a fascinating read that is sure to take you on an adventure that will make you wish there were more pages to read after you turn the last page.
اما داستان بدین‌قرار است که دختر و پسری طی یک آشنایی، به یک‌دیگر دل‌باخته شده، و صاحب فرزندی می‌شوند، اما بعدها درمی‌یابند که دارای رابطه‌ ی نسبی با یکدیگر بوده‌ اند و ...؛ ا.
In the past I've read historical novels that let me furious about the way women were treated and categorized into little boxes (mother, virgin, whore, if you're asking) but in The Shadow of the Wind I never felt that the issue was handled or acknowledged, or barely (they do mention it in other men, but for me they were no better).
All the time, and I'm not sure how I'm supposed to care about characters - Fermin and Daniel, for example - who constantly objectify women, when they're not busy expressing stereotypes like, "women can't do Maths", or, "women who let you touch them the first time are whores", etc, etc.
ذلك الكتاب الذي كان يتوجب عليه أن يختاره أو يختار غيرة المهم الخروج من المكتبة مع كتاب مختار فكان (ظل الريح) الذي نال اعجاب الشاب وتعجب أكثر من عظمة الكاتب وكيف يمنع مثل هذه التحفة الإبداعية سيبدأ بعد هذا العشق مطاردات بين دانييل وبين الحقيقة يبحث عن المؤلف الحقيقي للكتاب إلا أن روح شريرة متثملة في شخصية من الكتاب يطارد هو الآخر حامل النسخة الأخيرة من الكتاب المغضوب عليه ليتلفه.يوثق المؤلف لمدينة برشلونة ما بعد الحرب العالمية..
برشلونة ذاكرة البلاد المنسية نتاج ما بعد الحرب الأهلية الإسبانية والحرب العالمية الأولى وصراعات الدكتاتور الإسباني فرانكو هذا الشبح الذي سوف يطاردنا في كل أدب إسباني نجد شيء من حقارته.
"Every book, every volume you see here, has a soul. The soul of the person who wrote it and of those who read it and lived and dreamed with it." In post-civil war Barcelona, ten-year-old birthday boy, Daniel Sempere is taken by his father to a top-secret, labyrinthine library called 'The Cemetery of Forgotten Books' and is asked to select whichever one of the dusty publications calls out to him from an exhaustive succession of shelves.He chooses an obscure novel, The Shadow of the Wind written
Daniel, himself, describes the novel thus: "It is a story of love, of hatred and of the dreams that live in the shadow of the wind."In the honeymoon period of my read, I was already thinking it to be one of the best books I've read in a very long time and, after a handful of chapters, I was wishing that Goodreads would allow 5-star-plus ratings for special books such as this.The author's character imagery is up there with Márquez and Rushdie.
Every time a book changes hands, every time someone runs his eyes down its pages, its spirit grows and strengthens.The Cemetery of Forgotten Books, hidden behind heavy bolted doors and high walls, brought voices alive of authors passed and present, who needed their story discovered and told.
It meanders trough the labyrinth of the The Cemetery of Forgotten Books as well as the lives of the people who survived to tell their stories to Daniel.
I wonder if I hadn't read this right after Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell if I would have liked it better.
They were both trying to pay homage to the gothic/Romantic era writers, except that Strange and Norrell was brilliant, and this one was..
Yes, Romantic lit is full of cliche, but the thing is to do it in an intriguing way and with enough wit to keep your audience interested.
It had the formula, it just didn't execute things well enough, in my opinion.To be fair, that could be because this book was originally in Spanish.
Here is one for those of us who absolutely adore great literature. It is almost as though The Shadow of the Wind was written for book lovers everywhere. An adrenaline laced, pulse pounding, suspense filled, dark and romantic, gothic adventure, peopled with brilliantly developed, colourful, charismatic and ultimately,unforgetable characters. It really should come with a warning as it will keep you reading late into the night and long after you should have put it down. Fantastic! A must read folks. Make room on your book shelves for this one.
"Books are mirrors: you only see in them what you already have inside you." Well, I wonder then what part of me I saw inside this book - a book I adored despite its imperfections, despite its frequent veering into melodrama, despite (or maybe because of?) its densely Gothic atmosphere. Whatever it was, it was enough to make me lose myself completely in the rich setting of mid-20th century Barcelona, in the world of seductive dangerous power of literature and perils and passions of young love, a
Whatever it was, it was enough to make me lose myself completely in the rich setting of mid-20th century Barcelona, in the world of seductive dangerous power of literature and perils and passions of young love, and the contrasts of idealistic innocence with the weariness of experience, all against the rich tapestry of the city full of beauty and secrets and vividness, all told in a lavish idiomatic language that makes you forget you're reading a translation.
Zafón: *mentions death*Me: *rolls eyes, yawns* The opening pages had me worried, because of one particular detail - one detail - that told me this would be a book I wasn't liable to get along with.
On that June morning, I woke up screaming at first light.
For the first time, I realized my father was growing old.
I ask you, when has a child ever been aware of, or concerned with, what time in the morning they've woken their parents?
I wanted to like this book, truly, but it wasn't the right fit for me.
Dire.
The writing is along Dan Brown lines, with flowery metaphors mixed until they become meaningless.
From page 1: "My father sighed, hiding behind the sad smile that followed him like a shadow all through his life." How can he be hiding behind it if it's following him?
Then on the next page someone is described as having "vulturine features", but in the following sentence he has an "aquiline gaze".
This sloppiness is everywhere.The whole thing feels like it desperately wants be seen as some kind of profound parable, but the only result is that the characters are just implausible symbols.

أي داهية كتب هذا العمل وأي ذائقية سوف ترضينا بعد ذلك الكاتب الذي سقف ابداعه السماء ...
غبطت نفسي مرارآ لأن القدر استوقفني كي أكون أحد قارئي نص ريحه العاتية ولشرف الصدفة شاكرآ لأنه ساقني لهكذا اعجاز يخلط حيث الحدث المتماهي مع العاطفة والتشويق....
شكر خاص لمترجم العمل المبدع معاوية عبدالمجيد ولدار ميسكيلاني على هذا السبق في الدقة والإخراج .....ستة نجوم لعمل سوف يسقط في ذهنك حالما يسألك شخص ما هي أهم عشر نصوص قرأتها في حياتك.....

Set in the heart of a war-ravaged Barcelona, Julian Carax is the author of extremely poor selling novels, The Shadow of the Wind, his last.
Although many of these interactions seem incidental, all of them return in his later years to form the body of the mystery that is Julian Carax.The Cemetery of Forgotten Books is an old building in Barcelona that is somewhat of a secretive club for the literary established.
Perusing the shelves, Daniel chances upon The Shadow of the Wind by Julian Carax, an author he does not know but when he reads it, he wants more of Carax's works.
