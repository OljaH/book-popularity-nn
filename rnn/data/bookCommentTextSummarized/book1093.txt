This book was recommended to me by a book-lover who enjoys reading just about everything. The story was interesting. I have never read anything by D.H. Lawrence before, so the style took some getting used to. The story was short, yet it said a lot about people at the time the story took place. It was a very interesting premise for a very odd type of love story and I am glad I took the time to read it!
'The Captain's Doll' is set in Germany right after WW I.I recently finished reading Claire Tomlin's excellent biography of Katherine Mansfield, and she tells a whole lot about Mansfield's friendship with Lawrence and his [second] wife.
Tomlin also quotes insightful passages written by Lawrence about Mansfield and her writing.
So this background made it interesting for me to read Lawrence now.
I can only think it must have been a deep and precious experience to Lawrence himself, otherwise why bother to write about the scenery in such detail.
Deep tale about relationships, patriarchy, marriage and love.
A look into pressing pause on life through a perspective of not doing so.
Scottish officer, Captain Alexander Hepburn's involvement in the war has convinced him that human life is of very little value. German aristocrat, Countess Johanna zu Rassenflow, "Hannele," is captivated by Hepburn nonetheless, and as they journey together toward their ambiguous conclusion, the dehumanizing effects of war are made clear.
There are many disturbing things about Lawrence, but damn if he isn't a great writer. He's a guilty pleasure. Loved the Rainbow and Sons and Lovers. Forget silly Lady Chatterly and the absurd Plumed Serpent. He died in 1930 before such impulses played out in fascist politics and culture. However, I'm drawn to it.
I feel shitty :/
First DH I have managed to swallow - pretty good, pretty, pretty, good.
Entretenido.
