Reading marxists is becoming really boring for me. They all use diffrent language and say the same thing. They fight each other who understands Marx correctly...
Despite the same shortcomings of all Marxist works (how on earth would such an economy function, why would anyone work, the b.s. about History), Kautsky creates a more plausible means of bringing people dedicated to that philosophy into power without a brutal dictator.
Basically, the revolution should occur with ballots rather than bullets; without the support of the people, the revolution would require an oppressive government to maintain power, which hardly benefits the people the revolution is supposedly all about.
Of course, Kautsky's version has all of the shortcomings of democracy.
Who participates directly in the democracy?
The disaster that was the U.S.S.R. was pretty well foreseen by Kautsky.
"As has already been said, if the title of Kautsky's book were properly to reflect its contents, it should have been called, not 'The Dictatorship of the Proletariat', but a 'A Rehash of Bourgeois Attacks on the Bolsheviks.'
