One of the best Dr. Seuss' stories ever!  PRICELESS TALE  I’ll just have to save him. Because, after all,  A person’s a person, no matter how small, Without a doubt, one of the crowned jewels of Dr. Seuss’ work, presenting one of his strongest messages to the human civilization.Horton, the elephant, appears again (he was introduced to the world in Horton Hatches the Egg), which is one of the most famous characters of Dr. Seuss.Horton hears a Who (as quite adequately indicates the tale’s title)
A whole town, in a speck of dust.How wonderful indeed was the mind of Dr. Seuss!What a large quantity of stories he was able to take from a tiny speck of dust!Just imagine how many more stories are in the rest of millions of specks of dust!This charming tale stands up and becomes a relevant reading for everybody to understand the respect to any kind of life,......not matter how small.
Especially since City View was in the middle of the postwar Baby Boom like everywhere else, which required her little library to be stocked with piles and piles of kids' books!And we were the first kids in our village of snug postwar bungalows to read Dr. Seuss.
In our books we can find serious, non-conforming friends like Norman!
And we can live in simpler times like he and I knew, all over again...Today my wife and I don't even have cable TV - only books.
The Big-Hearted elephant with Ears of a matching size (ears so acute they can detect a whole Microdot Civilisation of Who's) still delights us and the little kids around us.

It's really fun to read aloud and it's easy for kids to remember the lines to read parts along with you.
*I was beyond excited when I heard they were making this into a movie and let me tell you, friends, it did not disappoint!
I LOVE this movie and yes I have seen it many many times.
. .When Horton the elephant heard a small noise.ABOUT THIS BOOK: Horton the kindly elephant has his work cut out saving the tiny Whos who live on a speck of dust – no one else believes they are there!
He returned from Europe in 1927, and began working for a magazine called Judge, the leading humor magazine in America at the time, submitting both cartoons and humorous articles for them.
In 1960 Bennett Cerf bet Geisel $50 that he couldn't write an entire book using only fifty words.
Theodor Seuss Geisel died 24 September 1991.
Me crying while reading this to small-fry??? More likely than you’d think
Told in the usual charming repetitive rhyme of Dr. Seuss so often appreciated by young children. Great message about how everyone is important and everyone can make a difference. Horton is a particularly endearing character, showing kindness and persistence, and risking ridicule and being ostracized and even being the recipient of abuse in order to help others and stand up for what he believes in. And the Whos do their part as well! One of those children’s books that can become more meaningful when read as an adult.Was tempted to put this one on my animal rights shelf. :-)
whilst that may well have been in the back of Dr Seuss's mind (I understand there's a moral to all of his stories) - above all else he provides us a timeless world of the imagination, of amazing words, pictures, rhymes, stories, learning, but above all else – FUNAlong with that of 'The Lorax' (2012) - the animated adaptation of 'Horton' (2008) provides us with the only two examples where cinema has got anywhere close to capturing the wonderful world of Dr Seuss.
Not just for children, but for the child in all of us.
'A person's a person, no matter how small'.
He began to do this because when he was young, his teachers made him 'feel small'.
lies in the universality of smallness.
Everyone knows what it is like to have been or felt small at some time in his or her life.
For adults, it may be a painful memory or a desire to protect their own children.
But smallness invites protection, caring, compassion.
Smallness needs to be heard.Will you listen?><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><Not sure when I first read this, but I still love it!
Apparently there's a movie out of it now which is pretty good.'A person's a person, no matter how small.' is one of my favorite quotes
Oh, this book was incredible.I was first introduced to the story of Horton Hears a Who last year in an apologetics class.
Horton lives a fairly normal life until the day when he hears a noise.
You see, Horton is an elephant and elephants have very sensitive ears so only Horton can hear the voices coming from the speck!
In the end, it's the one small voice that makes a difference and saves the day.
If you haven't read this story yet than you absolutely must!
*****SPOILERS***** I think what Seuss misses here is that the intended moral, about sticking up for people who can't defend themselves, is rendered moot about halfway through in the 'clover patch 100 miles wide' episode.
At this point, if he could have set aside the cause he had invested himself in for a moment, Horton would have appreciated that the Whos were in the best possible situation now for them, completely hidden and safe.
But his paternalistic impulse to save the weak pushes him on to uncover their hiding-spot and as a consequence brings them to the brink of disaster, saved only by a contrived and wildly unrealistic moral awakening among the villains of the tale.
Me sorprendió bastante la cantidad de enseñanzas que tiene este librito infantil.  “Una persona es una persona por muy pequeña que sea.”
Such moralism can be either good or bad, depending on how it's communicated and what you are aiming to teach your children.
In the case of Horton Hears a Who!, I think the moral is subtly and beautifully communicated.
The book covertly teaches children to bravely stand up for the little guy in the face of bullies, even if that courage means mockery.
It's also a wonderful, rhythmic story in its own right, and one of my four-year-old daughter's all time favorites.
It was likewise a favorite of mine as a child, and I must have read it 100 times.
" I'll just have to save him. Because, after all,A person's a person, no matter how small.":)Loved it :)
Another wonderful Dr. Seuss book that will be passed through your family for generations to come. My twin 3 yr olds recognized this book immediately when I brought it home, having saw the movie version not too long ago. It didn't matter, they were still fascinated with it. From every picture to every rhyme, they were enthralled. They love yelling out "We are here!" along with the Who's. Even my 5 yr old got into it. A fun read that's for the whole family.
One of my children's favourites both at home and for reading time at school.They absolutely adore Horton. Recommended.
***Rated by my son***

I just discovered Dr. Seuss and his lovely childrens books and am absolutely hooked! :-DBeautiful drawings and gorgeous rhymes!
I cannot read a Seuss’s book and not be smiling at the end for quite a moment.
I cannot say which one is better but I believe when it comes this book Dr. Seuss was more creative and found his flow of creativity.In the sequel, Horton's baby is apparently nonexistent at all (probably roaming the jungle) and he decides to go take a bath in the river.
While Horton enjoys the company, everyone else in the forest think that Horton is nuts and one of the Kangaroos decides to take matter into her own hands and try to ruin Horton and the speck of dust.
He doesn't believe his ears (and they are big!) but eventually he is persuaded that there is somebody there.He, therefore, grabs the speck of dust and places it on a clover.
He converses with whoever is there and discovers it is a Who, the Mayor indeed, from Who-ville, a city on the speck of dust!A listening kangaroo and her young can't believe Horton is talking to a clover and then the Wickersham brothers, three monkeys, come along and snatch Horton's clover.
When Horton the elephant hears a small cry for help coming from a speck of dust, he immediately does what he can.
However, the other animals in the jungle think there is nothing there and try to destroy that speck of dust.
Can Horton prove to them that there is someone that needs to be protected?Rereading this as an adult, I was struck by how strong the themes of standing up for what you believe and those who need your help are.
But those themes never slow down the story, which features constant danger for the Whos.
Don't give up.I believe in you all.A person's a personno matter how small!   Dr Seuss serving knowledge!
This one is also probably more of a 6- to 7-year old story but I’ll freely admit that I loved the movie!
In the words of a six-year-old: "I like it when Horton jumps into the lake screaming and he makes his ears as a bathcap, then he swims on his back with his ears." A person is a person, no matter how small!
(view spoiler)[Bettie's Books (hide spoiler)]
This is Seuss’ 11th book and the second (and last) in the series featuring the lovable elephant.In the book, Horton’s huge ears, which have hearing superior to all of the other animals, hear a small voice emanating from a dust speck that floats by.
Although I’m not a big celebrator of birthdays, I thought it an appropriate day to feature a book that I knew and loved as a child.This past week, I mailed an animated video of Horton Hears a Who!
Seuss, initially conceiving the book as a response to the American occupation of Japan, instead constructed a multi-layered allegory addressing the historical pattern of the scientist/mystic at odds with a totalitarian church-state.
Thus, on one level, the representation of Horton as the seer (literally and mystically) who is called to actions by unheard voices of intuition and other-worldliness while, at the same time, embodying the scientist whose extended techno-organs perceive substratum the untutored masses merely mock in their ignorance, suggests Seuss is replicating the plight of Meister Eckhart, Galileo, Theresa of Avila, and countless others.
Horton the elephant defends the community of Whos living in small Whoville housed on a speck of dust.
To better protect the smallest of the small, Horton cushions the speck of dust on a clover.
Forever faithful Horton, though, doesn't give up and he encourages every Who down in Whoville to raise his voice so tat the other animals might hear them and understand his vow to protect them.The Whos raise a racket, but it ins't enough.
When the smallest of all voices joins the chorus, it is then that the animals hear the Whos and vow to protect them alongside Horton.I LOVE the character of Horton.
Horton hears A Who!
is one of my favorite books and movies!
Similar to How The Grinch Stole Christmas this movie takes place in a forest but what Horton hears is on a small spectacle of dusk (Whoville on a snowflake- they are both small) Horton is convinced there is something or someone on the dust.
I think this book teaches about simple things and paying attention to what is surrounding you.
It also teaches students to stand up for people especially ones who can not for themselves.
I loved all the pictures and rhymes throughout the book.
