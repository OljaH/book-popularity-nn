A man who was a suspected communist and suspected undercover FBI agent in the Communist Party of US was poisoned in a restaurant and now both FBI and the police keep the investigations under tight wraps, so only Nero Wolfe can shed some light on the murder.The ending is good and fairly unexpected.
Archie Goodwin learns they are primary suspects in the murder of a cop too late to just let them go.
Usually it takes Archie Goodwin non-too-gentle push for Nero Wolfe to take a case.
I have never read a Nero Wolfe book which I rated with less than 4 stars, and this one is not an exception.
Three Nero Wolfe novellas. "Home to Roost"--about Communists--is only so-so, "The Squirt and Monkey"--about somebody killed with Archie's gun--is too complicated yet still entertaining, but "Cop Killer"--involving undocumented refugees hiding at Wolfe's after a murder at a barbershop--is delightful.
Good but not great Stout
Usually I am not as impressed by these collections of three Nero Wolfe stories (there are many) as I am by the full-length novels, and this one is no exception. I agree with a Goodreads friend that the middle one is best of the three--it involves two undocumented aliens (not by that fact alone a threat to the fabric of our society, but rather sympathetic characters--even in 1951) whom Archie shelters in Wolfe's brownstone while he investigates a murder in a barbershop. (Wolfe regularly gets his hair cut in a barbershop?! Who knew?) Still, very satisfying entertainment overall.
Wolfe rarely takes any case unless there's a good sum of money involved, and Archie points out that they're going to get very little from this.
Come on, he's known Archie some ten years, and Wolfe twenty, and he prefers to believe a stranger over them?
One has to guess--and it's only a guess--that Koven himself figured out who must have killed Getz, and quickly changed his story in order to protect the killer.
The fact that there's no real sense of shock from him when the killer is revealed makes this likely, but it still would be nice it Stout had made it clear.
Three prime Nero Wolfe shorts including the murder at the barbershop and the interview where to the remark, "Is this a democracy or isn't it?" the wife snaps, "No! It's not a democracy, it's a republic."
Rex Stout's "Triple Jeopardy (A Nero Wolfe Mystery Book 20)" is another collection of three of his short stories ("Home to Roost" (1952), "The Cop Killer" (1951), and "The Squirt and the Monkey" (1951)).
The first two stories ("Roost" and "Cop Killer") are mostly his usual fare for short stories.
But, in each one, there's a central character whose behavior is so stupid that it just knocks the legs out from under the thing.
The very best I can rate this last story is a pretty bad 2 stars out of 5.
I assume that I’ve read this before, although I remember only one of the novellas in this triptych of Nero Wolfe adventures.
Rex Stout wrote a number of short stories and novellas for magazines that would be bound up into collections, generally three at at time.
One of these stories was originally called “Nero Wolfe and the Communist Killers,” which shows Stout’s great enmity to American communism.
The second novella, “The Cop Killer” is the best (and the one I remembered) about illegal immigrants caught up in a murder case.
The third is a farrago called “The Squirt and the Monkey”.
Another classic Nero Wolfe book, this one a threesome of Stout's novellas featuring the heavy weight cerebral detective and his sidekick, Archie Goodwin.
Written in the early fifties (about the middle of Rex Stout's illustrious career), this trio of stories are at the tail end of the Golden Age of detective fiction, started in the 20-30's.
This era of mystery novels would soon give way to the Noir of the 50's and 60's.
Rex Stout with his unique protagonist is an iconic example of the great American mystery writer and this short compendium of novellas is worthy of four stars, even after almost 70 years.
I love Nero Wolfe and Archie and have since my Dad introduced me to him in Junior High. I inherited his collection when I was just 17 and always regretted that my Dad didn't get to read Rex Stout's last Nero Wolfe novel. I only gave this 4 stars because I never liked 'The Squirt and the Monkey'. Maybe since it was a novelette he didn't have time to develop the characters as well as in others, but it is not my favorite, by far.
This set of three detective novellas now creaks, with its fear of communists and immigrants from unspecified parts of Europe. Perhaps others who have become acquainted with the protagonist Nero Wolfe in other books will have found more to commend him as a character, but such was not in evidence here.
This was a lot of fun, but I thought it was a slight notch below the period Nero Wolfe books (I am reading them in order). I still strongly recommend it, but don’t start with it- start at the beginning!!!
The second one, The Cop-Killer, I found simply hilarious on account of Wolfe & Archie's interactions with Stebbins and Cramer, and the Cramer angle was also adding a lot to the third book. Some very decent and funny mysteries.
Another great story, or three stories about Archie and his people. The last is the best in my opinion. Although the barber shop story wad a close second. The incredulity Wolfe and Archie have for not being believed buy the police was amusing.
Three interesting stories.
Beat Wolfe in a while. Three shorts with three excellent twists and three hilarious situations.Wolfe gets a haircut.Archie goes to jail.“Grab his hat and run.”
The ending is atypical, in that Wolfe leaves his home to conclude the case for which he is not getting paid, and while the conclusion makes sense it is based on things we don't really know and seems a bit of a stretch, even for Wolfe, even though reading it when knowing how it ends enables us to see a lot of the clues Stout gives us more overtly than usual.
Still, the unusual nature of the story makes it very enjoyable, especially with the very atypical maneuverings involved in the revelation of the murderer.
Of the three stories, the first and third ("Home to Roost" and "The Squirt and the Monkey") are good, but the second ("The Cop-Killer") is great. I absolutely adore Tina and Carl, and I really love how Archie and Wolfe are with them. A lovely characterization story in the Wolfe universe.
Wolfe's sense of hospitality won't allow him to turn them over to the police and Wolfe and Archie have to find out who the real killers are.This is a story with a lot of fascinating features with us seeing their Barber shop.
Despite Archie pointing out that the most Wolfe could clear after taxes and expenses was $45, he's off to the strange house that produces Dazzle Dan complete with monkey and an unusual cast of characters.Through a complex series of events, a man is murdered with Archie's gun, the client lies about why he'd hired Wolfe, and Cramer informs Wolfe that his license will be suspended.
They come to nero Wolfe for answers.The Cop-Killer - When a policeman comes asking questions at the barber shop that Archie Goodwin and Nero Wolfe patronize, it spooks an illegal immigrant couple who works there.
The policeman was after a murderer, and when he is found stabbed in the back with scissors, the couple could be headed for the hot seat and Wolfe and Goodwin may be right behind them for harboring the fugitives!The Squirt and the Monkey - A cartoonist finds his gun is missing from his desk.
In "Home to Roost," the uncle and aunt of a murdered Communist asks Nero Wolfe to look into their nephew's death; the aunt is particularly troubled because her nephew had recently told her that, rather than being a true Communist, he was actually working for the FBI after infiltrating a local Communist cell.
"The Cop-Killer" features an Eastern European couple who are illegal aliens in the US and who are wanted by the police after another police officer was found murdered at the barber shop where they both worked; they come to Nero with an offer of $50 if he will only tell them how they might safely leave New York City and get to the country.
This was a collection of three short Nero Wolfe stories all from the early 50's.In the first it appears that a man has been poisoned in a restaurant by one of his five friends.
His aunt claims it happened because he was an FBI plant and his friends were communists.In the second a police officer is murdered in the barber shop where Nero Wolfe and Archie Goodwin go for their shaves and haircuts.
They are now the top suspects for the police.In the third, a man known for his newspaper comic strip hires Wolfe to help him find his missing unlicensed gun, but he has his own plan and doesn't want to employ Wolfe's brain.
While the first two stories make this compilation worth owning, it is the third story ("The Squirt and the Monkey") that is the one that will force me to return again and again to the book.
Of the stories about Nero Wolfe and Archie Goodwin in the series so far, "The Squirt and the Monkey" felt the most immediate in its danger to Archie and moved beyond his mere recitation of an old case to a whole-hearted engagement in the tale.
How will Archie and Wolfe get out of this predicament now?
Three more novellas featuring Nero Wolfe and Archie Goodwin.
Of course Wolfe solves it, but of course he makes it clear that, like all good Americans, he hates communists.The second has great fun with Archie and Nero baiting the police (again), even telling the truth in such a way that means they won't be believed.
This baiting continues into the third story, silly though it is, with a monkey ending up with Archie's gun.
The baiting of the police and the removal of Wolfe's licence do help atone for the plot with the monkey.Fun, as usual.
It's hard to write reviews of Rex Stout's work. I've read several and plan on reading them all. They are all excellently written, the characters are brilliant and time has shown that. I keep using the same superlatives, so we'll just take it for granted that from now on they are all fabulous! The 3 shorts tories in this collection, are excellent. Without giving any story lines away, the 2nd story I found oddly touching, and the 3rd story pissed me off (in a good way). Read them and you'll find out why!
Includes three novellas--"Home to Roost," "The Cop-Killer," and "The Squirt and the Monkey." The first isn't particularly strong, though it's an interesting look at reactions to Communism in the 50s. The latter two are more fun, particularly "The Cop-Killer," which is one of those times where Archie tells plenty of the truth--but of course no one believes him! The last story has the distinction of having Archie framed for murder, which is always fun.
I wonder how long it took me to discover that all Rex Stout's books with three, triplicate, or triple indicators in the title meant that they were always three shorter books in one, not necessarily related?I don't much care to review short stories unless they are classics like "The Lottery," or "A Good Man is Hard to Find." I would comment on "A Hard Man Is Good to Find," but I haven't found it in print, yet. Not the version I would review.
"Home to Roost" - an okay story about a murdered Communist -- or is he an FBI secret agent? Odd pacing."The Cop-Killer" - Witty and amusing, although the clue should have been more obvious to the detectives, it doesn't stop the story from being a lot of fun. A&E televised this one as part of their Nero Wolfe series."The Squirt and the Monkey" - Bad pacing, flat characters, little wit. One of the worst of the canon.
Home to Roost ***the Cop Killer ***the Squirt and the Monkey ***My Rating System:* couldn't finish, ** wouldn't recommend, *** would recommend, **** would read again, ***** have read again.
#20 in the Nero Wolfe series features the stout detective in a trio of novellas.Nero Wolfe series - the book comprises three stories that first appeared in The American Magazine: "Home to Roost" (January 1952, as "Nero Wolfe and the Communist Killer") "The Cop-Killer" (February 1951, as "The Cop Killer") "The Squirt and the Monkey" (August 1951, as "See No Evil")
