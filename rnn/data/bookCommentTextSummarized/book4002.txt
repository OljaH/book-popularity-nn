The Concise Encyclopedia of Economics captures the essence of Schumpeter's thoughts quite concisely, "Schumpeter believed that capitalism would be destroyed by its successes, that it would spawn a large intellectual class that made its living by attacking the very bourgeois system of private property and freedom so necessary for the intellectual classâ€™s existence."According to Schumpeter, the process of creative destruction is an essential fact about capitalism.
It may seem strange that anyone can fail to see so obvious a fact which moreover was long ago emphasized by Karl Marx." However, due to politics and a host of other reasons, we don't always allow this natural feature of capitalism to run its course when it's needed most.Creative destruction is necessary to bring forward progress in society.
A germane question, especially in the aftermath of the 2008 global rout. Schumpeter argues that there are seeds of creation in economic collapse, which tells us that perhaps new industries are emerging from the economic meltdown of the crisis. A tour de force.
