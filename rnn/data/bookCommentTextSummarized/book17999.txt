4.25Really enjoyed it but I should have completed this series sooner!
I didn't feel as though I were reading a book, I felt as though I were being lectured by the author, and I began to really notice it.
Then repetition was introduced in that every single time that Karou and Akiva were near each other scratch that, every single time I found myself reading from their perspectives, I was subjected to their never-ending musings about each other.
Between the long-winded pining, the info-dump expositions, and the repetition, I found myself starting to skim towards the end.
How many times are you going to have your main characters almost get together before pulling them apart again?
But the ugly shadow of Thiago and his attempted brutalization of Karou hung low in the air between them, even lower than the moon outside the reader’s window.
Karou, strong and self-sufficient, said shortly, “I protected myself,” but her eyes were bright with tears.
But in the end, these things were known and buried under prose that shone unbearably purple in the starlight, growing brighter and brighter like a wounded star in the night sky until there was nothing left of the dream of god and monsters, and of the reader's patience which lay in pieces on the desolate wasteland of her bedroom floor.
In all honesty, this trilogy hands down deserves a solid five glowing stars (or more really) but I just can't help but feel a little let down by the lack of a climax in this last book.
Perhaps the second just blew me away with its epic-ness.
All in all, despite the little misgivings I had, Dreams and the entire trilogy was just an amazingly (cannot emphasize this enough) magical journey.
Now bring on that Zuzana and Mik quote book!
I DEMAND IT.COVER REVEAL!
I love the red of the second cover but THIS.
A beautiful conclusion to an epic trilogy!This series is officially one of my favorites of all time, if not my very favorite.
(view spoiler)[Most of said tears were shed for Ziri.
(hide spoiler)]And while I am very happy and satisfied with this final book in the trilogy, I still can't help but want more.
There's certainly enough story here for another book--or even a spinoff series!
If only I could get my hands on a gavriel so I could wish said series into existence...
There is also another character that has a very interesting (to put it mildly) part in the book.
BUT, she does show a sweet side when no one is looking and she gets a crush that will turn to love.
I was so happy and it was lovely how sweet they were together.
Ziri is there, another one of Karou's best friends but he was a monster like her.
♥I loved the books in this trilogy.
I loved all of the creatures and I WISH there was a graphic novel or some kind of artwork book of all the creatures.
my future wife: do you love meme: yesmy future wife: are you ever going to love me as much as you love Liraz from those books you read five years agome: ...I’ll get back to you on that⭐This series has moved so far beyond its roots in DoSaB. Dreams of Gods and Monsters is a war epic, not just the story of a demon and angel's forbidden love. Everything lovely about the first book is simply one part of a whole story. There's so much nuance to both the themes and the characters. This is a series you
my future wife: do you love meme: yesmy future wife: are you ever going to love me as much as you love Liraz from those books you read five years agome: ...I’ll get back to you on that⭐️This series has moved so far beyond its roots in DoSaB.
Everything lovely about the first book is simply one part of a whole story.
They're both compelling characters and I absolutely loved seeing them finally get together, but they didn't grow quite enough for me.
I'm going to dedicate an entire paragraph to my two favorite characters: Liraz and Ziri.
Out of nowhere, characters who I’d just met suddenly became extremely important to the plot when all I really wanted was more Karou and Akiva.
It feels more Fantasy and less PNR by the end, and I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t left craving more of that romantic spark I felt in Daughter of Smoke and Bone.
A part of me wants to read a straight PNR from Taylor just so my feels can burst into flames.
Overall, I loved this book and this series still remains a favorite.(There better be a spin-off planned, because I smell a spin-off.)======This cover...
Cynical Natalie: Since no one else in this goddamn city has the guts to say this, I will: Why the fuck is the Daughter of Smoke & Bone series so popular?Nice Natalie: Hush!
Nice Natalie: Oh, boy, here we go.Cynical Natalie: Karou and Akiva's epic romance is insta-love.
It's to create a parallel: Karou, a female chimera is with Akiva, a male angel; and Ziri, a male chimera is with Liraz, a female angel.Cynical Natalie: Blah, blah, blah.
Nice Natalie: Er, are you talking about sexy times?Cynical Natalie: Just trying to keep it clean.
Let's make it 2.5 stars and call it day.Nice Natalie: You were hooked on it!Cynical Natalie: Until the confusing ending.
3.75 stars! I still really enjoyed this book but I felt this could have been a 4 book series, so the last half in particular felt a bit disjointed. Review to come on my channel!
(view spoiler)[hamsas are a truly formidable hurdle to overcome (hide spoiler)]everything in this book feels appropriate and necessary and the tension in both love and war and the in-between is guttingly good.the only thing keeping this from the five-star is - as much as i enjoyed the stelians and eliza as characters, i just think it is less satisfying to have the third book of a trilogy be wrapped up by these fashionably-late-to-the-party characters, and that angelus ex machina situation was a little disappointing, but not unfair.
It's been a while since I read "Days of blood and starlight". If you know me you would probably know that I am an ultimate fan of the this series. It's one of my all time favorites. I have saved this one for the winter break,but before I read this I wanted a feedback from you.Have you read it and if so,what did you think?
well, this unfortunately just earned itself a place on my ‘series i tried to love as much as everyone else, but failed to’ list, right next to the raven cycle.
i mean, side plots can be a great literary device, but when they come out of nowhere this one, im just left thinking, ‘well, whats even the point of that?’ for a book as lengthy as this, it just felt very tedious and not as meaningful as i would have liked.
i just think she bit off a little more than she could chew by trying to cram too much into one book, making it 600 pages of randomness.
The perfect conclusion. This trilogy is everything.
"We haven't been introduced."What a perfect ending to this fantastic series.
"It was not a happy ending, but a happy middle - at last, after so many fraught beginnings." And so the last page is turned, and I'm feeling content. I was afraid of disappointment, but it never came.This story started strong, soared in the middle and came a conclusion that made me happy - with a slight open-endedness that is there as a gentle reminder that beyond the conclusion for the Chimaera and the Seraphim, Karou and Akiva there's more. Because no good story is truly complete just with a
I was afraid of disappointment, but it never came.This story started strong, soared in the middle and came a conclusion that made me happy - with a slight open-endedness that is there as a gentle reminder that beyond the conclusion for the Chimaera and the Seraphim, Karou and Akiva there's more.
It helped create a feeling that there's is more to the scope of this world than Karou and Akiva alone - neatly subverting the Chosen Ones trope at the same time - and creating a 'happy middle' in place of a happy ending.
Wowwee wow. Laini Taylor is one of a kind.
It was so innovative and incredibly unique, so much so that you felt yourself drifting through the pages with this sense of euphoria.
I loved the characters, the humor, the incredible setting, and the constant turmoil that sprung the book to life.
Although i do admit i was never a big fan of Akiva from the beginning, i rooted for ziri and liraz way more than i did for the main characters and their love affair.
With the mesmerizing author that is Laini taylor and her incredible sense of story telling, i expected so much more out of this book, especially that i loved the first two installments.
4.5 starsOnce upon a time, an angel and a devil pressed their hands to their hearts and started the apocalypse.The Visitors have arrived.
Jael and his army of angels have come to Earth.Though Earth's population holds conflicting views on the Visitors' intentions, Akiva and Karou know that Jael and his minions pose nothing less than a threat to both Earth and Eretz.
And why is she haunted by dreams of gods and monsters?The adventure has taken Akiva and Karou from the beginnings in Prague across cities and continents and through two worlds.Fans of the 
series will not be disappointed in this long-awaited finale.
I don't know what happened but this book just got SO boring!
The first two had a really cool world and the characters were so funny and dynamic but this just lost everything.
It focused on characters I didn't care about, and it made the plot contingent on people I couldn't care less about.
The war aspects of this book were skimmed over, and I'm just so confused.
I hate books that talk about the paranormal/fantasy world spilling over into the normal human world, because there's just no way to recover from that and it's so uncomfortable to read.
So I finished it...Pre-Review:(view spoiler)[Edit III:Officially pre-ordered ;)----------Edit II:Oh. My.
Glob.
I was guessing that it was going to be yellow, but I didn't expect it to be that beautiful.
I so expected it to be beautiful, but that just exceeded my expectations.
The only problem is that I'm more excited now than I was before.
Ah, so excited!------------20- 2014?!?!I'll be a senior by then!
No.*Sighs* I guess the only thing to do know is cry myself to sleep every night until its release...Look at what you've done to me Laini Taylor.
Look at what I've become.

I forgot to update this when I finished!!! Will write my review later :).I think it's really a 4.5. But oh, I loved this book!
I was especially disappointed in the last 15% of the book when the new stories and characters suddenly became Very Important.
I'm sad because I feel like I lost Brimstone and Karou and Akiva’s dream in the wake of all the new elements.
But a lot of them were overshadowed by the extra plots, characters I couldn't care about, and a whole new story direction.
This is one of the big reasons why I feel such disappointment.After falling in love with the first two books in the series, I'm incredibly sad about my reaction to the third.
5 STARSThis series felt like a dream. A lush and beautiful and riveting dream.  “Absence has presence, sometimes, and that was what she felt. Absence like crushed-dead grass where something has been and is no longer. Absence where a thread has been ripped, ragged, from a tapestry, leaving a gap that can never be mended. That was all she felt.” Absence. And that was what I felt after reading the final book in this series. I'm in awe. What a grand and spectacular way to end this stunning trilogy o
5 STARSThis series felt like a dream.
And that was what I felt after reading the final book in this series.
What a grand and spectacular way to end this stunning trilogy of war and magic.The story is huge in so many ways; the vast and unknowable universe, the infinity of the present, and the never-ending possibilities surrounding the world of angels, beasts, and humans.
I'm giving this book a 5-star rating because it's a very compelling read that will twist your perception of angels and demons, magic, myth, and existence.
"Happiness wasn't a mystical place to be reached or won--some bright terrain beyond the boundary of misery, a paradise waiting for them to find it--but something to carry doggedly with you through everything, as humble and ordinary as your gear and supplies."  Months of gathering courage wasn't enough preparation for this epic finale because after reading the book, I still ended up in a state I tried so hard to avoid-  an emotional mess!!!
(hide spoiler)]My heart drowned in so much emotions for Ziri, Oh, Ziri!How my heart bled for him, for his sacrifice and selflessness.
The mythology becomes a little overcomplicated, a bit of deus ex machina in the end, maybe too much of Karou/Akiva romantic tension (can't they just do "it" already?). But all in all very satisfying. I think I would enjoy a (view spoiler)[Ziri/Liraz (hide spoiler)]story a lot (I am a big time shipper of these two).

Η φλυαρία της laini όμως δεν με άφησε να την απολαύσω.
Δεν χρειαζομουν όλη αυτή την ανάλυση συναισθημάτων και σκέψεων καθε τρεις και λίγο.
Ποιος νοιάζεται για την καινούρια που ούτε το όνομα της δεν θυμάμαι;Το πρώτο βιβλίο ήταν το αγαπημένο μου.
Συνάντησα στοιχεία που δεν έχω δει σε άλλο βιβλίο μέχρι τωρα.
Μάλλον φταίει το γεγονός πως είχα τεράστιες προσδοκίες έπειτα από τον ενθουσιασμό του πρώτου.Επίσης ήθελα κάτι πιο δυνατό για το τέλος.Αγαπημένο ζευγάρι: Ζιρι-Λιραζ 💜💜

However, Taylor uses this last installment to push the breadth and depth of her worldbuilding and plotting even further, so much so that this last book feels almost equally the start of some new series as it does the ending to one already established.It's all very interesting, but it comes so late in the telling that, in many ways, the final few chapters feel rushed and far too open-ended to work well.
There were bits and pieces of this story I enjoyed, but I'm pretty neutral about it as a whole.I absolutely LOVED the first book (and now like the second book more compared to this third one).
I feel like every character was stronger in the first book and the sequels sort of disintegrated into weird apocalyptic stuff with too many characters.
But all of the characters felt like shadows of themselves here, the pacing was all over the place, I didn't really connect with anything, and the story didn't go in any direction I was interested in...My overall feeling is pretty much:
