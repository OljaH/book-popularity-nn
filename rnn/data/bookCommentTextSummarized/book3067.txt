Adolygiad un gair : diflas!This was my second attempt at reading "Monica", which is an important Welsh novel (mercifully short), first published in 1930.
The sex is largely implied, and indeed not much actually seems to happen at all (how do the characters know what is going on?
I was reading the recently published edition which is part of Gomer's "classic" series, and it has a good introduction by Simon Brooks and is really nicely produced in hard cover on decent paper, unlike most Welsh novels (flimsy paperbacks which fall apart on use).
To me it was just a short story, but after the story there was an explanation of why this book was important coming from the Welsh.
