Obviously the best way to do it would be to solve the crime before the police starts meddling.Perry Mason is very good at investigating, even if it means lying to the police hiding behind client-lawyer confidentiality, breaking into somebody’s home, finding a dead body or two, and generally put his life in danger.
Some time ago the victim was driving a car being completely intoxicated, lost the control and ran over a wife and a kid of a guy named X, used a good lawyer and avoided the jail.
Some other time the victim looked at another guy called Y the wrong way.
The story is simple.
I like the light tone and playfulness of characters.
Chemistry between Perry and Della is crackling.
Paul Drake is very supportive and hapless in front of Perry's antics.
Still a very enjoyable story.Some excerpts:That's one thing about my husband.
No matter what happens, he can sleep like a log.
He simply doesn't worry about it.
If he knew he was going to be executed tomorrow, I don't think he'd lose a minute's sleep.
He'd simply say, 'Well, if it's going to be that way and there's nothing I can do about it, there's no reason for losing any sleep over it.
**1/2.I felt that this was a most unsatisfying production from Gardner, in that he played games with the reader.
It took the first third of the book to really learn that a murder had been committed, and then we weren’t sure who the murdered person was.
Gardner, true to form, does introduce a section on the use of encryptation to excite the reader, but the solution was disappointing.
In all, this was one of Gardner’s lesser efforts.
I did learn that this episode was adapted for one of the TV programs.
It’s worth the effort to find it on DVD and see how the writers handled it.
They have a bit of a family mystery by way of an empty sealed tin (like the type you would can preserves in), and suddenly we are off into the mystery!It's a good story, with a lot of moving pieces (like most Perry Mason stories), lots of players, a few extra murders, and several clues that feel obvious after Perry explains them.
I think perhaps this book just causes me a little Perry withdrawal, as he was not the focus of every chapter.
But regardless, fun book, good mystery, and witty banter!
I found this 1941 novel more enjoyable when I started thinking of it as I would approach a wartime b&w film, such as the Charlie Chan episodes with Sidney Toler in the title role, as a period piece.Perry Mason series - A new tin can, placed among of Mrs. Gentrie's preserves, contains no food -- but it does carry a clue to a murder that took place right next door.
It takes a second murder to clear up the mystery of the missing body -- and to make Perry Mason the next prime candidate to disappear....
Another Perry Mason book I have read multiple times. I really like this one.
But I have to agree with other readers in seeing this as not one of the best, and, indeed, so different in tone and structure that it is surprising that this has the same author as the preceding eighteen volumes.The upside here is a new lightness of tone in the text, and a lot more easy bantering between Mason and his team.
It's even difficult to see exactly who is Mason's client and which services he is expected to perform in that relationship.
So this is one for buffs of the series, I expect.
Not every Perry Mason features a courtroom appearence by Perry, and this is is one of the one's that doesn't.
That's a bit of a problem here -- Mason needs a crusade to focus the story and make his ethics bending antics remotely acceptable.
In this one, one of the two huge ethical violation does not benefit his client, and frankly only makes sense in that it sets up a nice confrontation between Drake and Mason which illustrates the downside to Mason's fast and loose behavior.The attraction to this one is that it pairs Mason off against Lt. Tragg, who, like Mason, is just trying to solve a murder case, and who, with pretty good reason, cannot bring himself to trust Mason.
one cannot restrain from falling for perry mason !!! he sparkles like a diamond among other characters, his intelligence mends your heart and mind together. about the story, i didn't find any fault or the faults might have been camouflaged with the sparkle of mason.the way the story unfolds leaves the reader awestruck. to sum it up, falling for a fictional character is so damn true and i fell too hard this time !
A good fast paced mystery, though, I had a feeling that maybe it wasn't Gardner who wrote this book or maybe he decided to deviate a little from his style... There was hardly any legal angle here. More of a whodunit then the usual Perry Mason affair. He also threw in a cypher! An interesting mystery, but not exactly the stuff one expects from a Mason novel.
He isn't concerned about what happened, he just wants the whole thing to be kept quiet because he is keeping a low profile and doesn't want the publicity.Incidentally, Kaar lives next door to Mrs. Gentrie.The man, a Mr. Hocksley, who lives beneath Kaar has subsequently disappeared.What has this got to do with the empty tin?
Is there a connection between Kaar, Hocksley, and the Gentrie household?I'm not going to tell you because I don't want to ruin the story.This so far is my favorite Mason novel.
Always goodI keep reAding Perry mason cases. Full of humor and clever good thinking personalities methods good characters suspending never to know until end
Kind of ridiculous, but definitely an enjoyable read. I like the WW2 flavor to it, as well.
There are leg men and breast men, but Erle was an "efficiency man." Perry Mason's crack secretary Della Street is described as "a feminine bundle of neat efficiency" and the admirable Mrs. Arthur Gentrie around whose house the mystery centers is said to manage her household "with the meticulous attention to detail that marks any good executive." Was Mrs. Gardner valued by her husband for her efficiency or was he describing the kind of woman that he wanted, but didn't have?In 1940, WWII had started, but the U.S. was still officially neutral.
These are so much fun.
I know those buildings, those streets, those restaurants and bars.
And when Della suggests driving down to Wilmington and hopping on a seaplane over to Catalina for an hour or two on the beach and dinner, I remember that was a thing that was done.Oh, and sassy Perry.
Della Street, turning down a breakfast offer of a stack of buckwheats - No, that's too heavy.
I've got to watch my figure, you know."Mason grinned.
"Not when you're on a beach in a bathing suit, you don't, baby.
Perry Mason at his best!
Lots of curves and turns.
The mystery starts as one thing and turns into something all together different.
Mason's efforts to solve the puzzle are a bit over the top.
It's all a little too incredible as he masquerades as something that would put anyone else in reality in jail.
But it is fiction and maybe things were that different in the 1930s, when this was written.And the book is well written and good characters.
Though a seemingly short book, best to read carefully as the story gets more and more complex and stay in that trajectory.
A real mishmash of a mystery. The most interesting thing was Perry and Della, after a difficult case, taking off for Catalina and the "speed" (Perry's a fast guy) of a speedboat and laying on the sand in "swimsuits" and eating hot dogs. I'm not making this up. I was trying to see these characters in relations to the start of World War II, but I couldn't pick up anything like women working in munitions factories, lack of nylon stockings, ration cards for food or gasoline... It could still be 1929 in Perry world.
Started out really slow; I almost dumped it. Perry breaks a lot of laws (or skirts pretty close to the edge). A number of clues are never fully explained. The key couple is never clued as having any relationship at all. But I totally missed the biggest clue at the end. And Della kisses Perry! Not as bad as it started out, but you've got to be a total Perry fan to read this.
It's been a long while since I read any Perry Mason. This one wasn't exactly what I remembered, there were no dramatic court room scenes, although there was plenty of drama. I did guess who the murderer was though I hadn't worked out all the reasoning. An enjoyable read.
I liked parts of the mystery, but this wasn't my favorite Mason story. I thought some twists were quite predictable, and the way Gow was treated/written about made me uncomfortable. I was surprised by the reveal of the culprit though, which is always nice.
An empty tin does make for a good mystery. Although by the end some could guess who was the murderer, but not everyone can. The suspense and speed of story was well maintained to keep you up in night.
Perry Mason shows an extraordinary disregard for ethics in this case. This is one where I saw the pieces falling into place early. Typical for the early Perry Mason books, the racist and sexist dialogue is prevalent. And the publisher of the e-book is grossly negligent in proofreading the text.
Brilliant!!
My Rating System:* couldn't finish, ** wouldn't recommend, *** would recommend, **** would read again, ***** have read again.
Nice read..
3 stars
Perry Mason breaks the law a lot in this one. The mystery itself is pretty average for Perry Mason, requiring pages and pages of explanation (as a huge info dump) at the end to tie it all together.
Good mystery though again the limits to which mason goes to is extreme and a bit over. But good read on the whole.
