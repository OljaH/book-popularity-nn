When she realizes that the tall, gorgeous Daniel is actually a good guy, she teams up with him and proceeds to spend most of the following 400+ pages going googly-eyed every time he is in the room, or else talking about dogs or guns.Every turn the book takes is obvious in advance.
The image looks just like the guy in front of you only he swears it isn't him.
I don't care how much of a saint you are, if someone tortures you, you're not going to sit up and be like "honey, are you alright?"Don't get me wrong, I love nice guys.
A bit of a different genre for me (adult spy thriller?!) but I ended up really enjoying this!
Some of the characters and humor and felt a little reminiscent of her previous books, but all the fighting/action scenes totally upped the levels of badass-ery.Overall, this was a fun, fast, and gripping read.
Recommended if you enjoyed the humor and characters of Meyer's previous books and/or you like adult spy thrillers (which I think I do now, so hit me with some recs!)
You haters can hate all you want, I DO NOT CARE. I will read this, and I will probably love it, b/c Stephenie Meyer is an effing Rock Star as far as I'm concerned.
Please don't let the lead character be as stupid as Bella
Watch out world, Stephenie Meyer entered her Miley phase Figure 1. Left: Twilight-Stephie, We'll wait til we get married cause I luv you. Love you more. No, love you more. La-ti-da, beautiful happy life. Right: Stephie 2.0, BOOM. Sex. Drugs. Cursing. Torture. Now let's kill somebody.She's baaaaaaack and badder than ever. Gone are the peace-loving vampires and here are the half-crazed mad scientist on the run plus an equally psycho ex-agent....plus a soulful puppy-dog of a man? “This is weird, O
I… well, I almost like you right now.” “The feeling will pass.” 
Plus, right off the bat she completely trusts the evil corporation she spent the last few years running from and manages to torture the wrong person.
AND the way he completely forgave Alex for her big "oopsie" in the beginning of the book - how could you not have an ounce of hard feelings towards her after that??
is the big scary brother who doesn't trust the girl despite ample evidence.
is the more innocent, trusting brother who can see into the girl's heart and knows she's truly good.
it's unlikely that i will ever read this, but i have to at least give her a round of applause for breaking out of her mold and trying new things instead of, you know, writing the same damn book from another's character's perspective. spread those wings, girl!
Instagram || Twitter || Facebook || Amazon || PinterestI have a love-hate relationship with Stephenie Meyer's work, and I think a lot of other people feel that way, too (even if they won't admit it). I'll start by saying that, yes, I do like TWILIGHT. The book, that is. Not the movie. I read it almost ten years ago, and I was at the perfect point in my life where it actually made a lot of sense to me. Because of that, I will always have fond feelings for Bella and Edward's admittedly self-absor

(In fact, I've always said that the Souls are an awful lot like the Yeerks.) I've read it several times, and I'll be the first to admit that while the story has its problems, the writing and world-building make up for it.
If THE CHEMIST has any redeeming features, it's that it made me want to reread TWILIGHT and THE HOST, to see Meyer at her best.Hopefully her next work will be better.

And he ends up taking Daniel and Alex (Juliana) to his hidden compound where he has a partner, Arnie, that run a guard dog/house pet business.
I mean you have all of these people trying to kill you in the world and he goes off and does something stupid.
So now not only are people looking for Alex (Juliana) and Kevin but they will take out Daniel too and anyone or thing that gets in their way.
I mean yes, he's never been in situations like Alex or his brother Kevin.
Knowing it could be a trick, but wishing for some peace in her life, and moved by the threat of a biological attack that could kill hundreds of thousands, Alex takes on the job despite her suspicions.She was right to be suspicious.The job goes south in a dramatic way (which is what Alex’s handlers were counting on) but ― despite some major bruises and a couple of really beautiful black eyes ― it turns out to be a game-changer for Alex’s life.
I don't get it. It is November 10th, and NOT ONE of my 3000 goodreads friends has read this book yet? How is it possible? Has Stephenie Meyer's fame completely evaporated already?!
If I do not like a book, chances are I may not finish it or It will get a lower star rating from me, but under no circumstance do I ever read it again.
At the same time it felt like the author was just trying too hard, most especially in introducing and fleshing out the protagonist Alex.
And then there were the times that I felt like a contestant on some game show, with my hand in the air willing the host to pick me, pick me.
For those of you who may have never read a Stephenie Meyer book, please, I implore you, do not start here.
Hey at least she is trying new stories unlike Clare who only knows how to milk one skinny cow.
Como pudo la misma persona escribir la saga Twilight y este libro?Es absolutamente aburrido, le sobran 200 páginas rellenadas con banalidades sin sentido, una protagonista con delirios de persecución, un romance salido de la nada y un final ridículo.Es la historia de Juliana Fortis (usa diferentes nombres, principalmente Alex) una doctora especialista en interrogatorios especiales quien, luego de que mataran a su mentor, escapa de la empresa del gobierno para la que trabajaba.
The title of this book is an offense. What have chemists (and chemists-to-be) done to deserve such a punishment as to be in the title of a book by Stephenie Meyer of all people?!?
DNF'd on page 231 HONESTLY. This book was decent until the "romance" was introduced. Admittedly, the plot had slowed down a bit and I was beginning to lose interest, but that put it over the top. I read a few reviews and the fact that the rest of the book is full of this ridiculous excuse for a plot is enough reason for me to put the book down. NO THANKS *bye*
No thank you.The book was great for the first third and last third but it was a little wobbly in the middle due to the romance between two of the characters.
Chapter 15 (where the romance started) was just not good.
I felt like the author forced the romance instead of allowing it to happen naturally and that's never a good thing.
Luckily it gets better and that chapter was simply a speed bump in an otherwise fantastic book.The main characters in this one include Alex, who I liked for most of the book, Daniel, who I also liked for most of the book, and Kevin, who I hated at first but loved by the end.
But...but what about the sequel to The Host???
I am willing to go as high as 3.5, but probably closer to three.High points:- The characters: I liked the main characters, they are pretty interesting.- The chemistry - a unique approach to the spy-action dramaThe so-so points:- The relationships: While I liked the characters, their relationships were kinda silly- The length: For what went on, this book was much longer than it needed to be.
There were some very drug out scenes in the middle.The blah point:- The story: Most of the time I had no idea what was going on in the main story or what the character motivations were.
DNF 15%#bored
My queen is back !I'm so high.
3.5 stars!I was extremely excited to read THE CHEMIST by STEPHENIE MEYER as I absolutely loved THE HOST and was hoping that this one would be just as good.
I think I was more interested in the relationship that Kevin had with his extremely intelligent trained dogs and their special abilities especially Einstein, as it added some extra life to the storyline.I found THE CHEMIST to have an interesting plot line which was executed in incredible detail and the main characters were well developed.To wrap it up it was an interesting, slower-paced, somewhat exciting read with a satisfying ending.Would I recommend?
Screw it.
I'm calling it at 8% - DNF.
:/The writing style is weird, I can't get into the main character or plot.
It seems generic to me.
Super secret spy must save the world from biological weapon.
The details describing her tactics and survival skills was just ...
boring.
Also, it's almost all "tell" don't show, info dump.
Dictating things that came before.
Unemotional writing.
Choppy.
Her writing is not so good that it justifies extra "prose" or flowery phrases.
She has one of the most basic, simple writing styles I've ever encountered.
It was 56 years pages of infodump on how this character hides her identity and takes so many precautions to not be found, but I don't know who she is, who's trying to find her, or why anyone needs to find her.
The story hasn't even started yet at where I'm leaving off.It's rare for me to DNF an audiobook because they are so easy to just let play, but this certainly doesn't work in audiobook format.
I had no reason to care about this character or her story, so I'm moving on to things I'm more in the mood for.
Hmm. Hmm. HMMM.The blurb is lackluster. The forbidden love element terrifies the shit out of me.We shall see.
But I honestly didn’t think she could handle writing an adult spy thriller.
She’s not your average main character for a book like this.
Instead, she’s an incredibly bright chemist trying to stay ahead of the people who want to take her out for knowing too much.
I don’t want to go into the other characters in the book, but I will say that Meyer did an incredible job at creating a varied cast.
Meyer also presented dogs in a wonderful way, where they felt like fully fleshed out characters in their own right.
She’s different, and I absolutely loved her story.
As such, this "adult" book resembles Ms. Meyer's YA fiction in that it features new experiences for the heroine which results in instalove, characters who go googly eyes over kissing and hand-holding, and references to intimacy that fades-to-black.
So, I did experience some disappointment while reading The Chemist to see that her writing style appears to have changed significantly in my perspective.
There are several well-loved authors who are wildly successful with similar styles but Ms. Meyer's writing has always sucked me in and let me live a different life for a while.
Forget who the author is and just judge the book on its own value.
It turns out to be a very readable, entertaining story with likeable characters ( Daniel in particular) and some well written and amusing dialogue.
I enjoyed it and the 500+ pages just slid past.That's not to say that a little more editor's red pen could have been applied.
There were sections that went on too long, and some judicious cutting could have made the book tighter and might even have given it a greater degree of suspense.Alex is one feisty lady, Daniel as mentioned before is charming and Kevin also has a lot going for him.
I thought the subject matter was fascinating and characters like Kevin and Val were so interesting.
Though I didn't love this as much as I loved The Host, it was so much better than the mess that was Breaking Dawn.The only thing I didn't like was (view spoiler)[how the insta-love between Alex and Daniel was handled.
(hide spoiler)]I really hope Stephenie gets her groove back and starts writing and publishing more.
