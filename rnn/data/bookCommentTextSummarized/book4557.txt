For example, the characters refer to Barsoom as "Mars" in this book, and the two moons, Thuria and Cluros, are for the first time given their Earth names of Deimos and Phobos.
But at least the story of John Carter ends on a high note here, bringing to a conclusion one of the best swashbuckling fantasy series of all time.Perhaps this is as good a place as any to note that the 11 Carter books that I have just read were the Ballantine/DelRey paperbacks of the late '70s to early '80s.
It feels like what would have turned out to be the first part of another Llana of Gathol-like series of linked novellas -- early on in the proceedings, John Carter is kidnapped by the eponymous Skeleton Men of Jupiter, and spends pretty much the entire story on Jupiter escaping his captors and searching for Dejah Thoris who, of course, has also been kidnapped.
The setting is interesting -- it would've been nice to see Burroughs have a chance to develop more of Jupiter, but such was not to be.So 1 star for Giant and 3 stars for Skeleton Men, averaging to 2.
This was the last entry in ERB's Martian series, and is interesting primarily only to completists. It contains two longish short stories, "John Carter and the Giant of Mars," which is a young-adult story written in collaboration with his son, John Coleman Burroughs. It is very thin.The second story doesn't even take place on Mars but on Jupiter and is called "Skeleton Men of Jupiter." It's also very weak.
"Carter!" Kantos Kan shouted, "throw yourself to the floor." With the speed of light, Carter dropped prone.How does Carter see a finger whiten in semi-gloom, when it is probably hidden by the trigger guard and body of the ray gun?
How does Kantos Kan have time to shout a fully formed sentence between the stranger's finger whitening on the trigger and the ray-gun firing?
In fact, after he shouts that, he throws some kind of long knife at the stranger and kill him, even before the ray gun is fired.The whole book is full of passages like that, that leave you struggling to reconcile timings, facts, and motivations.
And if you need to have the awesomeness of that explained, then you are clearly in the wrong place.
Did you take a wrong turn on your way to a Nora Roberts discussion?"Skeleton Men of Jupiter" is the raw form of an incomplete new idea, possibly the beginning of a spin-off series, and after one chokes down the preposterousness of humanoid existence on the planet Jupiter (in which case, again, you've somehow gotten lost on the way to Jodi Picoult), is the idea that this huge wild planet is essentially unexplored and of a completely outrageous scale, with twenty mile mountains and vast continents.
The original John Carter of Mars series by Edgar Rice Burroughs is a true sci-fi classic. The series of several books chronicles the adventures of American John Carter, who "dies" on Earth and finds himself inexplicably awaking on Mars. It is a combination of swashbuckling adventure, sci-fi worlds, and romance. The entire series is a good- and timeless- read. BTW: The recent movie was not particularly faithful to the novel, and completely failed to capture the flavor of the hero, John Carter. The books are MUCH better!Monty Pitts
There's nothing I can say about this book that hasn't been said countless times already.It consists of two novellas.
Apparently, it started out as a children's book; all I know is it reads like a bad '80s cartoon.
Plus, it's largely inconsistent--not to mention totally incongruous--with the rest of the John Carter series.The second novella is standard John Carter fare, but Burroughs died before he could carry the story to its proper resolution.
It doesn't end the series on a cliffhanger the way, say, WALKER TEXAS RANGER did (Is Alex Cahill dead or not?!), but certainly it's a far cry from the proper send-off these characters deserve.
😩I'm so sad it's over!!!!!!!!
This eponymous volume in the series is actually two novelettes: "John Carter and the Giant of Mars", and "Skeleton Men of Jupiter".
Both were written fairly long into his career, during World War II, and I imagine that at this point he could churn out these pulp stories in his sleep.Just as in the Tarzan series, he tends to rehash a lot of his plot elements, and at this point, having Dejah Thoris kidnapped yet again has become pretty tiresome.
Likewise in "Skeleton Men Of Jupiter", John Carter and Dejah Thoris are both taken by the title creatures in a bid to gain info on the invasion of Barsoom, starting with the great nation of Helium.
John Carter the immortal, is of again to rescue his love Deja Thoris the Red Princess of one of Mars most powerful kingdoms.
John Carters ability to perform incredible feats of strength, and marshall prowess due to the lesser gravity of Mars makes him a formidable oponent.
Respected by the most warlike people on a very warlike planet.
John carter is good friends with Tars Tarkas.
One of the green men of Mars.
Green giants with six arms and two legs.
As usual John rescues his princess with the help his powerful friends.
Becoming a legend in his new home, Mars.
I thought this book turn out to be interesting. The action and adventure kept your mind wondering. I had a hard time trying to get away from the book and do other things. I would recommend this book to anyone who has an interest in science-fiction and is an adventurous person. If you don't like reading about aliens or science-fiction you might not like it. This would be a good book for young adults and older. It was a graphic detailed novel.
Earlier in the week I read John Carter of Mars by Edgar Rice Burroughs, which was absolutely hilarious. Giant three-legged rats are attacking the telepathically controlled birds used as transport! Oh no, Carter has been captured by the dreaded skeleton men of Jupiter! Classic scifi is adorable. You'll be happy to know all ended happily if fairly egocentrically with Carter consistently saving the day and being pretty cocky about it.
The only real clunker in all of this latter-day stuff is the first story here--in third person and seemingly written in a bit of haste. Fortunately though in "Skeleton Men" we get back to first person and JC's slightly tongue-in-cheeky, vigorous style.
What can I say... Edgar Rice Burroughs is one of the SF/fantasy genres undisputed masters.
I loved this whole series. It's pretty sexual and macho and they're all massive page-turners.Same review for each.
The first story is as dreadful as everyone says.
Better left forgotten.
It almost got cool with the weird rat ritual in the catacombs but other than that was laughably bad.
His son did not have the talent he did.The second story is so bittersweet to read.
It introduces a fantastic new setting which was clearly meant to be explored further and a decent story to introduce these elements.
Albeit it felt a bit rushed.
It's sad such a historic franchise ended on this note.
We'll never know the full extent of ERB vision for Jupiter but this little glimpse captures the imagination.
This final volume of ERB's Mars books was published in book form posthumously, after he died in 1950, the two stories making it up having been published separately in Amazing Stories magazine in the 1940's. In both, Dejah Thoris has been kidnapped and John Carter is off to rescue her. In the first story, he has to deal with a giant. In the second one, she has been transported to Jupiter where Carter has to deal with the Skeleton Men. Good ERB adventures.
Very well written. Loved the story and the story line. I really like the movie too, just wish it had stayed the same as this book.
Mais conhecido por ter criado a figura lendária de Tarzan, Edgar Rice Burroughs ficou nos anais da literatura fantástica pela criação deste brilhante personagem John Carter que foi posteriormente transposto para a banda desenhada e para o cinema devido à imensa fama que granjeou com a série de livros escritos pelo autor.Honestamente, e embora tenha procurado e pesquisado, não consta que por detrás destas aventuras fantásticas tivessem quaisquer metáforas ou analogias ao que quer que seja.
I am reviewing the HarperCollins Publisher Ltd First Canadian Edition omnibus of the first three Barsoom books (A Princess of Mars, The Gods of Mars, and The Warlord of Mars), confusingly titled John Carter of Mars.
I get why they went with the title John Carter of Mars, as it matches the movie adaptation.
For the books themselves, I thought A Princess of Mars was a fun, creative, silly adventure story with some mild racism and sexism.
By the time I got to The Warlord of Mars, I was a bit done with Burroughs.
Final book in the epic 11 book Martian Tales series from Edgar Rice Burroughs is actually two short stories together.
The first, "John Carter And The Giant Of Mars" is a fun tale that has Carter's love, Dejah Thoris kidnaped by Pew Mogel,one of Ras Thavas' synthetic men, who has learned his master's secrets.
Second story "Skeleton Men Of Jupiter" has a lot of potential as it features Carter being taken to Jupiter by it's war-like inhabitants where they wish to force him to reveal all Barsoom's secrets to aid in their conquest.
I started reading this series 15 years ago and I've only just finished the final entry (I would have got here sooner, but a 9 year gap of near illiteracy sort of slowed me down).On this last book I have mixed feelings.
I imagine that he could have compellingly joined the narratives of “John Carter and the Giant of Mars” with “Skeleton Men of Jupiter”.
The second tale is the good old John Carter stuff we all came here for, but it feels like the first half of a novel, unfinished.Most people are pointing out that “John Carter and the Giant of Mars” was ghost written by Burroughs son.
Needless to say from the start the magazine was deluged with complaints saying the book clearly wasn't written by ERB.Giant is something of a sequel to Synthetic men of Mars but the style and caricaturization are much poorer, it has it's moments but is only worth reading if you intend to read the whole Barsoom series.Skeleton of Jupiter (Read from 6 to 7 July 2013) ***This is a completely different affair, Burroughs is writing towards his late best.
The Skeleton Men of Jupiter though brings back to his top form.
John Carter back in action and trapped in the usual formulaic plot of rescuing Dejah Thoris.
Still, the skeleton men are awful baddies and need a good thrashing.
Unfortunately, this book was to continue Carter's adventures but Burroughs did not do anymore Carter stories after this, meaning that I will never know if Dejah Thoris gets rescued or not.
I totally would love a chance to write some of these stories.Anyways, pick up the book to see Jupiter from Burroughs' eyes but don't expect closure.
He tried that approach a few times near the end of his career (‘Tarzan and the Forbidden City’ is apparently another).The other story is ‘Skeleton Men of Jupiter,’ intended to be an episodic novel in the style of ‘Llana of Gathol.’ Unfortunately, it was never finished but it might have proven as entertaining.
What exists of it is enough to pull this book up to two stars.Burroughs was writing this in the early 40s and, as usual, threw in some social commentary on his time and world.
These were considered "planetary romances" according to one source back when this series from the creator of Tarzan, Edgar Rice Burroughs, was written.
It's a Virginian, John Carter, an immortal, who is able to pass back and forth between bodies: one on Earth, the other on Mars.I read these books because they were an inspiration to other authors, such as Conan creator, Robert E, Howard, who paid tribute to Burrough's in his novella,  Almuric.
At the heart of today's popular sci-fi there are traces of Burroughs and John Carter of Mars.I was most interested in finding traces of George Lucas's Star Wars in these books; and traces abound.
The book suffered because I'm pretty sure that rather abrupt ending wasn't what E.R.B. wanted to leave off, for he would die in a few years probably thinking he still had time for another, especially considering the possibility of Mars going to war with a race of beings from the planet Jupiter.
If anything, next time I'd prefer to read just the first part which feels more like a real adventure full of action, battle and incredible courage.
Most of the characters from the very first novels come back to fight against the creations of the mastermind of Mars, who declare war on Helium.
I don't care if the story JOHN CARTER AND THE GIANT OF MARS was written by Edgar Rice Burroughs or not.
As I understand, it was written primarily as a children's story by Edgar Rice Burroughs in collaboration with his son John Coleman Burroughs.
The SKELETON MEN OF JUPITER is another story I also enjoyed a lot.
This is the first adventure of John Carter on the planet Jupiter and is a lot of fun.
The first story reads like a bad dream about Barsoom: absurdity on top of absurdity; poorly written; random; etc.
I did like that the intelligent plants on Jupiter have slow nervous systems and 'scream' minutes after you hurt them, and the description of the ocean was nice.Here's how I'd rate the Mars books in relation to each other: 1 > 2 > 3 > 8 > 7 > 5 > 6 > 9 > 10 > 4 > 11.
Books 1-3 are an essential set that should definitely be read first before all others.
I discovered Edgar Rice Burroughs as a 9 year old boy, and have thereafter been pretty much fated to a long love affair with his works.
'John Carter of Mars' is a posthumous collection of some discarded ideals that Edgar Rice Burroughs never published, fully developed, or finished polishing.This book is so freakishly bad that even an 10 year old fanatic who had barely noticed the bountiful flaws in any of the other works found the story to be unredeemably badly written and badly concieved.
It's that bad.I don't care how much you love the 'Barsoom' stories, avoid inflicting this one on yourself.
