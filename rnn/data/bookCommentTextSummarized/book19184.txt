Not for the experimental or seasoned cook.----------pg 37: Chicken salad sandwiches -- I've never actually tried this particular recipe, but I'm going to say that since it's very close to my own, I like it!
That's the other thing: have the lemon juice ready before starting the method.pg 92: Blue cheese burgers -- (5/15/09) Without blue cheese; I don't like blue cheese.
I would've preferred more spices, a handful of oregano would be good.recipes I'll try later: Chocolate cupcakes & peanut butter icingCranberry orange scones--------We're switching to Barefoot Contessa Back to Basics How to Get Great Flavors from Simple Ingredients.
I have made the chicken salad veronique recipe many times from this book.
Aside from the potato salad and maybe the chicken piccata (though I already have a million recipes for that) there isn't anything else in the book I would really make.
I cook primarily for the immediate family and they aren't clamoring for things like duck, blue and goat cheese, cornish hens, and roasted peppers.
The family likes their lasagna with pasta not portobello mushrooms, thank you very much.
There is also more than one recipe for lobster.
As an aside I was very disappointed to find out that Ina turned down the make a wish foundation.
Authoors differ in their approaches and even provide varying recipes for the same dish.
"Coq au Vin" is one of my favorite tried and true French recipes.
Garten provides her recipe, basing it on a Beef Bourguignon.
As her producer once said, triggering the experiment, "Well, [coq au vin:] is just beef bourguignon with chicken." Boy, this sounds interesting, richer than the normal recipe that I use.
Garten lays out her views on cooking at the outset and then illustrates how to implement those views in her recipe collection.
People who want to create tasty dishes without major hassles will find this a good cookbook to add to their collection.
عذاب نفسي. مليء بالوصفات ذات المقادير سهلة التوفر و يسيرة التحضير، و مقسم لعدة أقسام تشمل الأطباق من مختلف الأصناف (حلو، رئيسي، سلطات، ...)؛ رغم أني فقط اطلعت على وصفات السلطات و الحلويات. أظنه من الكتب المفيد تواجدها في مكتبة المنزل. من الكتب التي أنوي اقتناء نسخة منه لمكتبتي.
Alfonso and I decided that we should try cooking together every week... so this is where we'll start. Alfonso is an imaginary person. He doesn't really exist. But if he did, I'm sure he'd make me a lovely sandwich.
Great cookbook with easy to make recipes! Our cookbook club made lots delicious recipes! We all found this book and the ingredients very accessible and doable.
I will be the first person to tell you that I'm not a huge fan of Ina Garten.
I almost kind of want to do a "Julia and Julia"-type thing and go through this, making every single recipe!
This is exactly the type of cookbook that I've been looking for for months, and I can't believe that I finally found it in Ina Garten!
I'm not sure why I was never interested in her before, but let me tell you — I'm definitely going to be checking out more of her cookbooks after reading this one!
Mrs. Barefoot Contessa is classy, jazzy lady that knows what she doing in the kitchen. Hats off to her Mrs. Barefoot Contessa. Lemon Squares recipe is the marvelous!
Ina Garten's Barefoot Contessa series are so much more than just the recipes.
The real stars here are the desserts; Beatty's chocolate cake with chocolate frosting was a sensation at a birthday party, peanut butter and jelly bars and chocolate cupcakes with peanut butter icing are stand outs.
But the main attraction was the coconut cake with cream cheese frosting I made for my son's 16th birthday.
This latest of the Barefoot Contessa series although not my favorite is definetly worth the investment and you will make the recipes over and over as Ina Garten promises.
Other favorites were the buttermilk mashed potatoes, peanut-butter icing, a couple of vegetarian dishes to try like fresh pea soup, stewed lentils and tomatoes, parmesan roasted cauliflower.
In fact, it feels like it was written for the rich East Hamptonites, complete with shout-outs and driving directions to all of her favorite local roadside shops.
If you have regular access and ability to purchase ingredients like duck, fresh salmon fillets, lobster, and creme fraiche, then this is the book for you!
Have fresh flowers everywhere and the cushions all fluffed when hubby gets home from work.
Contrary to its title, I am never inspired to make the Barefoot Contessa's recipes again and again. Not that I don't like her. But she seems to have such a strong following of people who love her, and I just don't like her as much as they do. How about Nigella Lawson? James Beard? Even Rachel Ray is more fun to read, though she puts together some odd combinations.

Pictures of Recipes? Yes.Commentary on Recipes? Yes.Nutrition Facts? No.Recipe style? Fancy home cooking?Any keepers? Not really. I wasn't really inspired by much in this one. I don't think every cookbook needs her chicken stock recipe.

I find her show a little on the snobby side so I thought the recipes might be too high brow for me. I was wrong. I use this cookbook so often. Unlike other photography cookbooks, the recipes are worth the fluff!
A well written book. Enjoyed reading it.
Nice cooking book.
