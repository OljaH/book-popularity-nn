The book is free-standing but it’s #2 in her 10-volume series featuring detective Patrick Hedstrom.The focus is on a crazy feuding family, descendants of a now-deceased charismatic preacher who passed his “healing ability” on to his two sons.
The immediate mystery is that the body of a young missing woman is found in a gorge in a scenic tourist area dumped off a cliff.
The plot proceeds with a lot of focus on the personal lives of the detectives as well as on the family members suspected in the recent disappearances just as they were suspected twenty years ago.
Άμα εξαιρέσω το άσχετο και κακό εξώφυλλο -ναι, πείτε με επιφανειακό άτομο αλλά δίνω σημασία στα εξώφυλλα- το οποίο δείχνει ένα παιδάκι, φτυστό η Βjork σύμφωνα με έναν φίλο μου, (μα που κολλάει αυτό το παιδάκι;) το περιεχόμενο το βρήκα πολύ πολύ καλό. Ωραίοι ήρωες, υπέροχη ατμόσφαιρα με αρκετό μυστήριο και κάποιες ευχάριστες πινελιές με χιούμορ, απο τους κεντρικούς ήρωες. Σαφώς καλύτερο απο την Παγωμένη Πριγκίπισσα και κατώτερο απο την Μάγισσα (θα μου πείτε που πήγα τώρα εφόσον την Μάγισσα την έγραψε 10 χρόνια μετά;).
This is the second book in this series by Swedish author Camilla Läckberg.
Our main characters, Patrik and Erica, are back and this time it is Patrik's turn to take centre stage as Erica sits at home heavily pregnant during a heat wave.
The story was excellent although I got a little lost at times regarding who was who and what their relationships were.
There were a lot of characters and they were all related!
The book also jumped around a lot from one person's perspective to another and occasionally I was forced to read back and work things out.
The bottom line: the novel's premise is interesting, but I did not enjoy the book because of the sloppy writing (a translation problem?), the unsympathetic characters, and the shame-on-you dirty writers' tricks Lackberg uses to keep readers from seeing or knowing what the characters see and know.I wrote a much longer version of this review for my blog, but the gist remains the same.
Characters frequently open letters or receive phone calls that change everything--and they tell us that it changes everything--but the reader doesn't get to see the letters or hear the person on the other end of the phone delivering the bombshell.
I so want to be able to give half star ratings. I would give The Preacher a 4.5, for I enjoyed it very much. I reserve 5 stars for my most favorite, fabulous, couldn't put it down books. This one was close but not quite five. :)
This is the first book I read from this author and gave me the best impressions!!!I will definately read more books of Mrs Lackberg!!
This is really more like 3.5 stars, I marked it down from 4 stars because of the lack of Erica.
Her big story was having to deal with uninvited guests!
She seemed like part of the scenery.
I also didn't like how Anna was relegated to a few pages, it seemed like the author just didn't know what to do with her after her big drama in book one.
While I am still complaining, this book could have been 100 pages shorter because there was a lot of whining about the heat and a lot of back story about the suspects that was unnecessary, we don't have to understand or feel for them.
Especially because his girlfriend, Erica, is pregnant with their baby.I must say I liked this book better than The Ice Princess.
Anna, Erica's young sister, also features, and we get to know that she still hasn't learned how to choose a good man for her and her kids.
And from the last we read about Anna, I can only predicted things will become worse.So, basically this book isn't as eye-rolling as the previous one, and we can focus more on what is important: the big mystery concerning a dead girl and two female skeletons.
I would have rated it higher, but I felt that the use of the "omniscient" narrator sometimes got in the way of the story.
I prefer to have everything necessary to the final understanding of the plot emerge from the story, rather than have the omniscient narrator come up with a lot of extra, missing material right at the end of the book.
This was the first of Camilla Lackberg's novels I have had the pleasure to read.
I will certainly read more of them.
حبكة هايلة و أسلوب عظيم, و تنظيم و تنسيق و اخراج الكتاب زي الزفت.الحقيقة مافرقش حاجة عن الكتب المضروبة رغم انه سعره فوق الـ ٢٠٠ جنية.
I enjoy reading about them more than about the main murder in the books, although these are interesting as well.
Läckberg did such a good job of setting up these characters in the first book of this series and she continued to do so in this book as well.I found the premise of this book, which centered around a charlatan evangelical circuit preacher to be an intriguing one.
Not as much as I liked her first book in this series but nonetheless, it was a good read and one I would recommend to others.
Bellissimo! anche in questo libro la Läckberg è riuscita a confondermi portandomi sulla strada sbagliata, per poi sorprendermi rivelando l'assassino/gli assassini. Mi ha inoltre emozionata e mi ha fatta sentire vicina ai personaggi, come fossero amici o conoscenti. Ho già comprato "Lo scalpellino" (il capitolo successivo) e non vedo l'ra di leggerlo.
Erica and Patrik are expecting their first child when a body is found on top of two skeletons that could be the bones after two women that disappeared twenty years ago.
Is it the same person that killed and hid the first two women?
The Preacher is a great book.
But, it was also, Johannes Hult, one of the preachers sons that was accused of kidnapping one of the women twenty years ago...Just as the Ice Princess is this book great, and I love besides the crime to get to know the characters more, and follow them through their lives.
Goed boek! De personages zijn goed uitgewerkt en het blijft tot het laatste moment spannend. Als je deel 1 goed vond, moet je dit deel ook zeker lezen.
Το δεύτερο βιβλίο της σειράς που διαβάζω (το πρώτο δεν ήταν το πρώτο) και η εντύπωση είναι άκρως θετική.
Για άλλη μια φορά μάλιστα διαβάζω βιβλίο όπου η εκκλησία και οι τρελαμένοι οπαδοί της γίνονται λίγο "ψυχοπαθείς" με τα πιστεύω τους (τι ωραία που είμαστε τελικά εμείς!!).
Επίσης, οι σχέσεις ανάμεσα στα μέλη μιας οικογένειας μπορούν να γίνουν πραγματικά παρανοϊκές, Ένα άλλο ζήτημα είναι ότι στα βιβλία που έχω διαβάσει η Ερίκα παίζει συμπληρωματικό ρόλο και ουσιαστικά δεν είναι παρά μόνο η σύντροφος του Πάτρικ, δείχνοντας περισσότερα στοιχεία για τον ίδιο.
Στο παρόν βιβλίο είναι έγκυος, περιμένει από ώρα σε ώρα να γεννήσει και έχει να τα βάλει με σπαστικούς συγγενείς και φίλους που της φορτώνονται!!!
كتابي الخامس عشر لعام 2018.في الجزء الثاني من سلسلة الروايات البوليسية (فيالباكا) للكاتبة كاميلا لاكبيرغ يتسلم الشرطي باتريك هيدشتروم قضية مقتل فتاة بطريقة وحشية مع وجود عظام تعود لجثتين وجدتا بجانبها في فجوة الملك، ليبدأ التحقيق على مستوى واسع دون التوصل إلى أي شيء...
وفجأة، يتم الاخبار عن اختفاء فتاة أخرى ومن هنا تبدأ الحقيقة بالظهور شيئاً فشيئاً.القصة جميلة والحبكة قوية ولكنني أحببت الجزء الأول أكثر من هذا...
كرهت الحشو ف 200 أو 250 صفحة كانت كافية كما أعتقد، كما أن احتشاد الكثير من الشخصيات التي لا مبرر لوجودها في الرواية أفسدت متعة القراءة😑التقييم:3نجوم🌼 وكما في الجزء الأول الكثير والكثير من الأخطاء الاملائية بالاضافة إلى تكرار لبعض الفقرات، التنسيق والتنظيم سيئان للغاية.
ليس هناك ما هو افضل لدي من كتابة تعليقي/مراجعتي عن كتاب/رواية ما الا بمجرد الانتهاء منه واقصد بهذا ب
To δεύτερο βιβλίο της Camilla Lackberg με τις περιπέτειες του Πάτρικ και της Ερίκα με γοήτευσε όσο και το πρώτο,η "Παγωμένη Πριγκίπισσα"..Ατμοσφαιρικό,άψογα δομημένο,δε σε αφήνει να το αφήσεις από τα χέρια σου. Οι εξελίξεις τρέχουν και σε κρατούν σε εγρήγορση,οι σελίδες φεύγουν χωρίς να το καταλάβεις και απλά περιμένεις να δεις τι σκέφτηκε το δαιμόνιο μυαλό της συγγραφέως για τη λύση του δράματος.Κι εκεί που νομίζεις πως έχεις βρει την άκρη,ανακαλύπτεις πως καμιά φαντασία δε φτάνει την πένα της Lackberg και πως οι εκπλήξεις δε σταματούν ώσπου να φτάσεις στην τελευταία σελίδα.
This is my 3rd book in the Patrick Hedstorm series, and the worst among rhose.A very insipid tale told of young women found dead or missing in the 70s as well as in 2004... and connection sought for these different timelines of crimes. The side story of Erica, Patrick's pregnant partner and her sister Anne who is forever attracting the wrong kind of man, too wasn't thAt convincing. Would continue with the series as I have invested in the private lives of the investigators and their respective families.
Annika is a strong person who, unlike Anna, has taken the wise precaution of having no children.
Yes, she might well make all of the points she does in convincing him to have more sympathy for Ericka’s plight, but he would hardly end up as the cowering creature he does under her criticism.Patrik’s boss, Mellberg, while still a cartoon character, is less in evidence in this book.
It is at once more clever and less likely than its predecessor.I continue to have no interest in the relationship between Ericka and Patrik, which is no doubt a reflection of me as much as the book.
Así es señores, cuando más retorcida es la trama más me llama la atención.Las novelas de Camila en cambio tienen su toque creepy pero muy escondido, hasta la resolución no terminás de darte cuenta lo sutil que era.
Patrick toma el protagonismo y es el único que lleva a cabo la investigación del crimen de turno.El resto de los personajes están muy bien desarrollados.
Seguiré leyendo la serie porque me gusta su prosa y los misterios están muy copados, pero ese machismo me tiene por las bolas.Seguime en:InstagramTwitterMi blog
This is a crazy good creepy dark Swedish crime series..
In this novel, the focus is mostly on Patrik, the police detective, rather than his partner, Erica, the writer.
Much more focus on Erica in her first novel.Most of the action takes place with Patrik's leading an investigation into crimes of tortured and murdered young girls - two cold cases from 20+ years ago that are linked to a current homicide and a missing girl they are trying desperately to find.
Highly recommend her work if you like literate, weird, creepy police detective novels with good characters and sometimes darkly humorous writing.
I'm totally hooked on this series!
AMAZING! It had me guessing till the very last chapter.... I love Lackberg!! I love the plot the twists and turns in the story... I love Erica and Patric... Best psychological thriller I've read so far..Mystery lovers, what are you waiting for??
tenemos los mismos personajes, y vamos conociendo poco a poco más su personalidad -tanto de Patrick como Erika, los otros policías y la familia de ambos, pero lo que no terminó de convencerme fue el caso criminal en sí.
We have the same characters and a very good premise -a young woman is found dead and beneath her corpse, two other bodies from women that disappeared 30 years ago are found.
We get to know more on the main characters, Patrick and Erika, and the people that surround them, which I think sets a good tone for the upcoming books, but I guess what didn’t convince me was the criminal case itself.
Khi mang xác chết đi, cảnh sát lại phát hiện ở ngay dưới đó có hai bộ xương khô – cũng của hai người phụ nữ.
Tất cả ba xác chết đều có những thương tích như nhau Người ta đã hành hạ ba người phụ nữ này một cách có hệ thống qua một thời gian dài trước khi họ bị giết chết.
Nhưng về cuối thì câu chuyện trở nên lôgíc đến mức chỉ còn một hai khả năng cho lời giải đáp.
Cuối cùng thì cảnh sát không trả lời được cho tất cả những câu hỏi đã được đặt ra.
Patrik is nu echt de hoofdpersoon, zijn chef Mellberg is sterk naar de achtergrond verdrongen ten opzichte van het eerste deel.
Het onderzoek kruipt hem behoorlijk onder de huid, wat goed beschreven wordt waardoor Patrik echt een karaktergroei krijgt.
Heb me vaak opnieuw de stamboom van de familie in het hoofd moeten prenten om het te kunnen volgen.Beetje gemeen zijn de 'tricks' om de personages iets te weten te laten komen waardoor er een andere kijk op het verhaal komt, maar dat de lezer er nog een aantal hoofdstukken op moet wachten.
"La giornata cominciò in maniera promettente. Si svegliò presto, prima del resto della famiglia, e dopo essersi vestito il più silenziosamente possibile riuscì a sgattaiolare fuori senza farsi notare. Prese anche l'elmo da cavaliere e la spada di legno, che fece oscillare felice mentre percorreva di corsa i cento metri dalla casa all'imbocco di Kungsklyftan....."
Εκτός το ότι ήταν αρκετά "σκληρό" για εμένα... θέλω να ρωτήσω, ήμουν η μοναδική που μπερδεύτηκα με τόσα πρόσωπα; Έκανα πολύ κόπο και διάβασα πολλές σελίδες μέχρι να καταφέρω να κατατοπιστώ με τόσα ονόματα και να καταλάβω τι σχέσεις είχαν μεταξύ τους...Πολύ δυνατή ιστορία, αλλά με έχασε σε πολλά σημεία... Γι' αυτό και 3 αστεράκια...Περισσότερα δείτε εδώ...
