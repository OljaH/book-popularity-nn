5 ‘Crazy Eyes’ stars! After reading Lick, I’ve been waiting for this book. For Mal’s book. I loved him in the first and I had such high hopes for his story. Let me tell you... It didn’t let me down! I love rockstar books, but these are in a different league. Not only are they hot, sweet, and full of sexy rockstars, but they are off the charts hilarious. I laughed so hard in this story! But it wasn’t just funny- there was a lot of depth in there too.Anne is in a pinch. Once again, she’s been used
Mal is the light hearted, fun loving, and a bit crazy drummer.
Anne no longer has to worry about paying her rent, and Mal has a sweet and beautiful girlfriend.
Even though Mal and Anne were in a ‘fake’ relationship, they really worked together.
I loved the way they interacted, how Anne was able to see the real side of Mal that not many do.
Full of sweet, sexy, romantic heart warming moments, and too many laugh out loud lines to count, with characters you can’t help but to love, this is a book I would highly recommend.
I must admit, however, that the plot felt a bit random to me.
Even as I closed the book, I was still unsure what this story was really about.
I LOVED Mal's character in Lick and couldn't wait to read his book.
I found it difficult to connect to his character, to Anne's character, to her easy acceptance of his crazy behavior, and to their love story.
Sadly, this book, its main characters, and the plot perplexed me more than it enchanted me.
Though this book didn't fully work for me, I believe most readers will love reading this story.
Not only did I found Play just as awesome as Lick, I think Mal and Anne made David and Eve run for their money.Anne Rollins wasn’t a very close friend of Eve , but yet after disaster of a day, Anne found herself being at the party the David Ferris and his wife were throwing.
When very funny but weird circumstances made Mal move into Anne’s apartment (without her knowing about it, of course) the things between them start to skyrocketing in hot as sin department.
"Life`s a song, Anne. Let's play."  5 Stars!You cannot just simply resist Mal Ericson.I have been so interested to read the Mal's story ever since Lick. Well who doesn't want to get to know him more? He's such a fun and goofy character and I knew that behind his playful attitude there's a different side of him that we have yet to see.Malcolm "Mal" Ericson is Stage Dive's drummer. He is known as someone who always "plays" around when it comes to women. With his happy-go-lucky lifestyle, relatio
I loved Mal and Anne's dynamic.
While Mal might be a player, his character development throughout the story-- the way he stuck to Anne and basically followed a monogamous relationship, very well pleased me.
Like most pretend relationship books, these characters fell into a real relationship together, but what I loved about this book was Mal and Anne's mutual acceptance when it comes to their weak sides.
Each conflict was immediately resolved without getting into so much drama which I really loved.What also made me embrace this book was Mal's relationship with his family, especially with his mom.
Can't decide if David or Mal is my favorite!!! Loved :))
"Life's a song,Anne.Let's play." Wow I'm a big fan of this series!!I loved Lick and I loved this one!!This book was so refreshing and funny!!I laughed so loud!!Mal is hilarious!I was really looking forward for his book!!Anne wasn't lucky in her life.She is a good person, she cares for everyone but sometimes people take advantage of her..Her roommate walk out on her and her boss use her.When her friends asked her to go with them in a party, she decides to go with them..and there she will meet the drummer of the rock band Stage Dive, Mal!!Mal is so funny also he is moody and manic!When he met Anne in the party he professes that she is his girlfriend!So they move in together!!
;DI loved Mal so much!!I liked that he is a little crazy, he wanted to live in the moment!I think he helps a lot Anne because she is the opposite of him!
Und wieder ein Buch innerhalb von 24 Stunden gelesen, das hab ich momentan irgendwie echt drauf 😎 hatte mich nach dem ersten Band sehr auf diesen gefreut weil MAL 😍😍 leider konnte es mich dann aber nicht zu 100% überzeugen bzw.
meine doch recht hohen Erwartungen nicht ganz erfüllen 😕 das Buch war zwar super witzig und spritzig aber dennoch hat mir so das Gewissen letzte etwas gefehlt um emotional vollkommen mit den beiden Protas zu gehen.
Dennoch mag ich Kylie Scotts Schreibstil sehr gerne und bis jetzt mochte ich auch jeden von ihr erschaffenen Charakter auf seine Art sehr gern 👌🏻
I loved Book one Lick.And I loved this book! Even more!Mal was so much more than he promised in Lick!Mal and Anne meet at a party, Mal decided he liked Anne, and that he needs Anne (for reasons of his own) and Anne needs him. So he moves in and convinced Anne to be a pretend Girlfriend.  "You moved in with me somehow"......."I know what you're gonna say, it's sooner than I thought too. But Davie threw me out today so I figured, why wait?"I just blinked, the rest of me being too frozen to respond
"You moved in with me somehow"......."I know what you're gonna say, it's sooner than I thought too.
Love makes you psycho, right?"......"So you moved in with me?"......"Anne, come on.
She saw down to the real Mal, behind the famous drummer.Together they were perfection, the chemistry, the banter between them was great.And seeing more of the rest of the band, and how close they all are and support each other was beautiful!It was a funny, sexy, at times a little sad, but hugely enjoyable read, that somehow manages to pass the brilliance of book one!
Mal was a hoot!!! I'm totally digging this series now.

Find all of my reviews at: http://52bookminimum.blogspot.com/I finished this book early Saturday morning, but I’m just getting around to reviewing it because every time I think about what to say I develop a pretty massive problem in my underwears .
Normally I buffer my dirty reads with another genre, but after enjoying Mal’s cameos in the first book so much I couldn’t stop thinking about him.
As I powered through this puppy without coming up for air.Alright, so the story is obviously about Mal the drummer .
When the two meet at one of David and Ev’s parties, the story comes out and Mal decides to fix things .
4.5 STARS!
★★★★☆ “We’ve broken my bed,” I said, stating the obvious.“In battle, sacrifices must be made, pumpkin.” Well holy cow!
When I first met Mal in Lick, I knew he would be a totally fun guy to read about but I didn't expect how crazy and freakin hilarious this read was!
Once I started, I couldn't put it down and I even had to sacrifice a bit of sleep just to read a little bit more of Mal!
“Make love.
I meant make love … of course.
I would never just stick my dick in you.
I would make mad,
Once I started, I couldn't put it down and I even had to sacrifice a bit of sleep just to read a little bit more of Mal!
This was exactly what I needed in my life right now and although I thought the ending was a little rushed, I'm rounding this read up to 5 stars because let's face it....Mal was damn f*cking awesome.
I'm starting to recall right now how awesome rockstar reads are.
Btw Rachel, I fluffin' love you right now for making me read these!
READ IT IF YOU LOVE EM' ROCKSTARS!!!
This is one fucking fantastic book - Even better than Lick - Hands down Malcolm is my favorite in the Stage Dive Band members....you never know if he is serious or joking around.I kinda thought the reason why he wanted Anne to be his pretend girlfriend was because of someone in his family wanting him to settle down....but for the book being so funny throughout...this is making my eyes water thinking about how sensitive and caring Malcolm really is.
5 I Don't Care, I Keep Reading Great Books Stars * * * * * Buddy Ready with my Angel Carol, Woot WootI have been on a roll...
I have read all types of books with one thing in common...
You want to be part of the story and climb through the e reader or pages and become one with the book.
What is delicious is how our male lead shows her the way.So thank you Ms. Scott for remaining true to your talent and giving me another wonderful read full of heart, life; yes, extremely steamy and sexy times and strong story.
March 14, 2014THE COVER = ♥♥♥♥♥Currently on NetGalley.August 5, 2013HELLZ YEAH!!! Bring on Mal!!! Nothing beats (pun most definitely intended!) a sexy drummer!!!
4 'I love you, Mal' stars!!!!  He spun on his heel to face me, arms out wide. “Life’s a song, Anne. Let’s play.”    After reading  Lick I was hooked but while reading 'Lick,' I fell in love with Stage Dive's drummer, Mal. So, when I found out the second book was his story I nearly died of a heart attack and couldn't wait to continue to fall for the hilarious Mal. In  Play, we have Anne.

After reading  Lick I was hooked but while reading 'Lick,' I fell in love with Stage Dive's drummer, Mal. So, when I found out the second book was his story I nearly died of a heart attack and couldn't wait to continue to fall for the hilarious Mal. In  Play, we have Anne.
my crazy lovable don't take too seriously Mal. He was the highlight in 'Lick' for me and to be completely honest I was going to rate this a '3.5', but Mal (& David) are the reason why it was bumped up to a 4.
A couple of my favorite quotes:Mal- "Hello, Anne's clitoris. It's me, Malcom, your lord and master." - "Oh, god, no." I covered my face with my hands. "Please don't." - AnneMal- "Shh. This is a private conversation...You're beautiful, Anne's pussy. Just beautiful. And I'm not mean like her. I'm on your side and I love you very much because you feel f#cking amazing wrapped around my d*ck."  "You're a friend of Ev's and Lauren's. We talked. I tackled you. We rolled around on the floor together. It

Just beautiful.
I'm on your side and I love you very much because you feel f#cking amazing wrapped around my d*ck."
I tackled you.
We rolled around on the floor together.
- Mal
- Ev referring to when Mal tackled Anne to the floor.
Describes him to a tee don't you think?I Love you Mal!!♥♥He's so funny when he nicknamed Evelyn, David's wife, "Childbride"!
After meeting Mal in the first book, Lick, I could hardly wait to get to know this sweet and funny drummer better...much better.
Mal is everything you think he is...fun, crazy, wild and your typical rock god manwhore but there's something going on with him.
It's almost like he has ADD.And right from the moment he meets Anne and wants her as a "fake" girlfriend, you just know there's something going on.
It certainly doesn't help when she decides to give Mal some of his own medicine and claim his kisses don't affect her.
Warning, this review will be told mostly in quotes because I could never replicate the awesomeness that is Ms. Scott’s writing style.Play is the story of Mal, the playful drummer of Stage Dive, and Anne, the charming and cute girl who works in a book shop.
Mal will front Anne the money and live with her, and she will pretend to be his girlfriend (for somewhat mysterious reasons).So we’ve all heard this plot before right?
Here are a series of quotes from the book to prove my point:  “We start fucking and you’ll be all ‘Oh Mal, I never dreamed such ecstasy was possible.
3.75 ~ 4 Pumpkin Stars  "Life's a song, Anne. Let's play." I was so excited to finally be able to sit and read Mal's story. I found his sense of humor completely hillarious! Anne was extremely relatable and likable character.  "Pumpkin, I'm always serious when it comes to you. Even when I'm messing around, I'm still serious as shit." Somewhere along the way, their relationship felt like it was on fast foward and the story kinda felt like the same old for me. There were several scenes that I did

Overall, Mal wasn't as sexy as I expected but the story was fun for fans of Stage Dive.
"Take a chance, Anne."  Mal caught my attention in Lick and I've been looking forward to his book. The other night my husband and I were watching an Iron Maiden concert/tour on Paladia and I got this HUGE urge for a Rock-n-Roll book. Mal is known to be the life of the party and when he overhears a personal phone conversation of Anne's, who is down on her luck...Mal proposes the idea of being in a fake relationship with him.

Loved that this book was set in Portland, Oregon.
Adding books to my Oregon shelf makes my day.
This shelf is dedicated to any book that mentions Oregon or is set in Oregon.
I really don't remember Mal from Book 1. I did like Book 1, cannot really remember it but I gave it 4 stars.Mal came across as childish, spoiled, truculent, manic, OTT. Halfway through I sort of said, c'mon, Maura, give him a shot! But, naw, I couldn't really like himI thought Ann was a bit of a doormat. Woman, grow a backbone!I am being generous giving it three stars. Kinda wondering now if I even want to read about Jimmy. "You're twenty-seven years old, honey.""And?""Isn't it time to start act

"You're twenty-seven years old, honey.""And?""Isn't it time to start acting like a grown up?"
Felt I was dealing with a three year old half the time.
Shit… This book… Seriously?  Had the total goldilocks effect on me. The right amount of Everything! Happy scenes, sad scenes, drama scenes, hilarious I’m about to pee myself scenes, sexy oh my freaking god where’s BOB scenes, serious scenes and just downright. FUCKING AWESOME SCENES!I tried to write this review for about an hour and it all just sounded idiotic.. So I’m cheating and showing you how I felt! (Fuck I love GIF’s!)    “You think it’s haunted of coitus past?”   “Hello, Anne’s clitoris
“You think it’s haunted of coitus past?”
It’s me, Malcolm, your lord and master.”“Oh, God, no.” I covered my face with my hands.
“Please don’t.”“Shh. This is a private conversation.” “If you don’t stop talking to my vagina I’m going to kill you.” “You’re beautiful Anne’s pussy.
“I’m the drummer from Stage Dive.I don’t get kept awake by other people having wild sex.
Well yeah you get my point about the awesomeness that is Mal… I loved how the end of the book had the next cover for Lead!
In fact I think I’m off to read Davie and Ev’s book again..
While it is hard to take Mal seriously and she isn’t aware of his motivations, Anne agrees to go along with his crazy plan.
Her new sexy rockstar roommate/fake boyfriend definitely makes things interesting.
Mal loves that Anne isn’t with him for fame or fortune and always knows how to handle him.
Anne loves that Mal accepts her boundaries, wants her to stand up for herself.
Anne was a great heroine, there were times I wanted her to do things differently, but I think she was more realistic then me, since I would be jumping to be with Mal Ericson.
*5 pumpkin stars*  Malcolm! Malcolm! Malcolm!You're so funnyAnd so sexyOh, and Anna? I like youBecause how can you not like someone so good, sweet and witty. Besides, she's my namesake, it's natural we clicked from the beginnig. Don't even get me started on Mal. I haven't met such lovely character for a while now. He is CAF, adoringly impulsive, funny, sexy, caring and loving boyfriend, but what impressed me the most was his sincerity.I. Loved. This. Book. It had no drama, only the good stuff.

So if you want to read something hilarious, light, sweet and heart melting, add it to your TBR asap!
5 MAL-icious StarsSo I originally thought I was going to rate this 4.5 stars (the ending felt a little rushed and off to me) but, fuck it, Mal deserves a starry sky of awesome.I can't remember the last time I loved a lead male character so much. His witty loquaciousness had me all like this:And his hotness factor?Swoon.I liked the first one, but this one totally trumped it for me. I hope Jimmy's story is as good as I want it to be. He's all damaged and angtsy, woo woo!
4 Rocker Stars!Anne is Eve’s friend (you surely remember her from the first book) and she is currently through a rough phase and is low on money.
If you’re into rock stars books, you’re really going to love this.
Character Development:  Anne is good, although annoying at some moments.
Mal is your traditional rock star: sexy, grumpy, playboy but with a hidden heart of gold.
Steam:  Hot. HEA: 	(view spoiler)[Yes.

"I am, Malcolm, Lord of the Sex!" You know, I think this is true. It's rare that someone boasts and is absolutely right, but I think in this case...Chuck Norris can spot awesomeness. He invented it.So, we have the drummer, Malcolm, who is a bit of a manwhore. But, he's a funny manwhore which just so happens to be my favorite kind. "Do I need to know her name?""I've heard it helps.""Maybe for you," Mal scoffed. "I just call out my own name during sex." He meets Anne, who is financially screwed b
"Do I need to know her name?""I've heard it helps.""Maybe for you," Mal scoffed.
"You moved in with me somehow....Um, how did you get in again, just out of interest?""Is this going to be an issue?" he asked with a long winded sigh......."Plus, I'll open jars and lift heavy shit.
He works a lot.Anne has been crushing on Mal since she was a teenage girl with posters of him and the band covering her bedroom walls.
Why does he want a fake girlfriend when he could have any girl on the planet, including slightly chubby older housewives who may be happily married?You'll find out later.Anne and Mal actually made a really cute couple.
I'm not a huge fan of this storyline....the relationship built on lies of sort.
Pretending to be boyfriend/girlfriend knowing one or both parties will start to have more feelings.
Anne will be his "pretend" girlfriend and within days he's moved in with her.
It's obvious something is going on with Mal. But both Anne and Mal are locked up tighter than a prison.
Will Anne and Mal be able to face it together or will it bring them down?
I laughed and I really did love Mal, OTT crazy and all.
I definitely recommend if you're a fan of the series.
4.5 STARS!!!!!!![image error] Kylie Scott has done it again!!!! I just LOVE these books!!! And I love the name of the band… STAGE DIVE… because that is exactly what it feels like falling for it’s fabulously flawed, talented, and gorgeous band members!!!! [image error] This one, Play, features Malcolm Ericson, the band’s drummer…life of the party…Nordic god… enigmatic man-whore. I haven’t quite come up with the right word to describe him yet. But he is definitely one of the most unique characters
Anne is a sweet girl who was eager to please..her friends, her boss Reece, who she’s had a crush on now for two years, the same boss who flaunts his womanizing ways in her face, likely knowing how she feels about him.
Lauren and Nate, at finding Anne at home in her newly vacated apartment had forced her to come along with them to a party at Ev and her new rockstar husband’s home… where she is quietly discovered by the band’s drummer…and her idol… Mal Ericson.
