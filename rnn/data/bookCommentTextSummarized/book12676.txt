A more mature one, I'll admit, and one that understands the later themes a lot better, but still, a fan all the same.Sailor Moon is one of those animes/mangas that I'd love to bash.
Because some day there will be another six-year-old girl in front of my television, watching Sailor Moon triumph over eeeeeeeevil, and I'll remember exactly why this is the one true original manga for me.
The nostalgia is so real. I'm reading the '98 English translation versions because that is what I grew up with. So as I re-read this, essentially all of them will be 5-star because 7 year old Lainey won't allow me to rate them any less.
Sailor Moon without a doubt made most of my childhood sparkle.
I also remember acting out the transformation sequences with all of the merchandise I was able purchase with my measly allowance.
Everything was just so colourful and magic; more than anything I wanted to be a badass Sailor Scout.
I'm not really able to critique Sailor Moon exactly because it became such an important piece of my childhood and self so there's nothing I can really say bad about it.
I still remain a fan and I always will; Sailor Moon is just too precious to me and it's a gem that I'll forever hold in my heart.
Safe to say, I'm a Sailor Moon freak and while I love the anime (the Japanese version of course, though they did redo the english version and took out all the censorship, their American names, etc, which I'm very happy about) I knew to be a true sailor-moon-is-my-heart-and-soul-fan I had to read the manga.
Short winded response in regards to that long winded mini rant, I feel like I'm going to get that from the manga and I'm so excited!.
***I haven't read a lot of manga so I don't really feel like I can rate this at the moment.
I'll admit, I went into this first book of the series, with kind of average expectations,but I have been rather pleasantly surprised.Sailor moon, for me, is like eating a vanilla cream cupcake.
The story was light, and kind of fluffy, but the powers the girls had, made me enjoy it more.
I mean, what girl wouldn't want to wake up finding she had those kind of powers?I didn't think Sailor Moon was in no way representing a fourteen year old.
With any Manga, the artwork is important to me, and this one didn't let me down.
I watched Sailor Moon right when I returned from Hungary to live in the post-war Bosnia.
Sailor Moon was called Bunny and it sounds OK to me even now, so many years later.
Apart from teaching me right from wrong, it was a really well done anime perfectly suitable for little girls: romance, friendship, fight against evil, cute talking kittens, prince in the..black tuxedo with a rose that seems deadly enough to pawn enemies (back then we didn't question such things!)As far as the manga goes..I didn't like it so much.
A 14-year-old girl who is most happy when she's snoozing <3" or "Sailor Mercury.
Reading Sailor Moon takes me way back! Born in the Nineties, most girls (and even some guys) in my generation was into either The Powerpuff Girls, The Winx Club or Sailor Moon. I was definitely a Sailor Moon fan, but I had no idea that there was a whole graphic novel series! It's from 1992, it's old - now I feel old because the last time I even watched Sailor Moon I was four years old, in 2001 - wow, this is nostalgic. Anyway, amazing book, I'll definitely be reading the rest in the series. :)
I always thought of Sailor Moon to be just like that but the author delivered such beautiful and logical explanations to all the events happening.
The artwork is one of the most important things for me when reading a manga and Sailor Moons is just so astonishingly beautiful.
Sailor Moon as a character was also very nice – she grows so much throughout the series and she is nowhere as annoying as she was in the anime adaption.
It is also nice how the author goes into the other characters dreams and wishes and does not only focus on Sailor Moon – another thing that many magical girl manga do.
I got all 11 Sailor Moon books in the mail on the 14th, and when i was finally able get around to reading them, I devowered them.
I loved every moment of every single book.
It was just as good, if not better than the anime.
Though, everytime I saw "In the name of the moon, you're punished," I read it as "On behalf of the moon, I will punish you!" Ah, good ol' Sailor Moon!
Plus, the theme song is one of my all time favorite theme songs.
Now, if they could coordinate playing the theme song when you open the book, I think it would then become beyond perfect.
Ya tengo 23 años pero todavìa la amo . Idola en el manga como en la serie .
Story: Who does not love/want to be a young girl that one day out of the blue discovers you have magical powers and are going to fight the forces of evil to help the world?
The multitude of different types of character personalities also gives the series a more realistic nature with clashing attitudes and emotions everyone does not always agree with one another but there is also the voice of reason to figure everything out.Overall: This family friendly, romantic comedy brings in a new element to the powers of righteousness and teaching kids what is right and wrong.Note: This review was completed after reading volumes 1-3.
People on this site seem to have a real love/hate relationship with Sailor Moon. Personally, I've always been a fan. I watched the DIC dubbed anime when I was a kid, a few years ago I picked up the English subbed one to experience it in a new manner, and now that I am introducing to my 6 year old daughter, I picked up a few volumes of the manga. For nostalgia purposes. The art is beautiful, the story is as fun as I remembered, and the characters are loveable. It's a great fast read.
Nostalgia read. I blame Sailor Moon Crystal.
so fun. exactly what i needed to read right now. i love magical girl manga/anime. makes me wanna watch madoka magica again(tuxedo mask kissed her when she was passed out tho??????)
God!! it reminds me when I was young! a little girl who's fan of Usagi . I remember watching this manga series and everytime when Usagi goes in a mission or when she fights I act like her. Moving just like her hoping my clothes will change. Ah!! I really miss those days. So that's why I decided to read this series to remember my childhood's days. to refresh my memory 😍😍 Moon Prism Power
The very best memory of my childhood. I recommend it for everyone. 5 of 5 from me.
Es el primer manga que leo.
Creo que voy a llorar de la emoción jaja De pequeña veía el anime, lo adoraba, de hecho poco a poco estoy volviendo a verlo porque me pudo la nostalgia, ¡y cómo estoy disfrutando de ello!
Este primer tomo me ha encantado, hay cosas que la serie calcó del manga, otras que son un poco distintas, pero yo estoy más que encantada.
He disfrutado como una enana, me lo he leído en un día y quiero más.
Es verdad que hay cosas que suceden más repentinamente, pero vamos, la historia me gusta mucho y no puedo estar más feliz de haber decidido leerlo por fin.
STORY SECTION: 8/10 [Once upon a time, there was a princess on the moon...] The story is basically separated into five arcs and in each we have the stereotypical tale of superpowered girls fighting demons who want to take over the world.
Also the scale of the battles escalates to encompass entire worlds and eventually the whole galaxy, making you feel like you are watching a story that is bigger than life itself.
The thing is that they are colorized a lot along the way and each one becomes a distinctive personality, despite usually being grouped together in battles as a unit.
The surprising parts are the no-nonsense, bloodless violence.Wherein the MONSTER OF THE WEEK IS BEHEADED while crumbling to dust.And like, Mars seems to straight up vaporize one of the dudes that Berryl is controlling??
At least, there seems to be conspicuous blank spots on the sides of the page.Also there's this annoying little moon symbol every time there's the worlds "Sailor Moon." The symbol is shoved between Sailor and Moon, and it bothers me.Finally, wow, Usagi is hella bi.
Her reactions when she meets Mercury, and later Mars, is "WOW SHE'S CUTE *U*".
Lektura zdecydowanie sentymentalna. Warto czasem wrócić do tytułów z dzieciństwa, nie tylko na nowo odkryć nieco już zapomniane historie ale też po prostu się zrelaksować. :)Polskie wydanie niestety nie było idealne, ale te niedociągnięcia w tłumaczeniu przywołują raczej uśmiech na twarzy i pokazują tylko, jak bardzo zmieniła się jakość wydań w naszym kraju.Bardzo boli jednak sposób wydania - pomimo, że jest to manga czyta się standardowo jak polską książkę - od lewej do prawej... :(
I reread this to avoid comfort eating while i was upset after breaking up with my boyfriend last week. I couldn't get enough of this in seventh grade, but rereading this 8 years later isn't quite the same. Its a little silly, repetitive, but enjoyable none the less. Definitely an excellent mindless read, especially when stressed (and healthier than eating a package of oreos!). :)
I read all the volumes of Sailor Moon when it was released to us in English. This series was a huge love of my life years ago, and it still makes me nostalgic and happy to return to it.忘れないわ, セーラームーン.
Desde niña vi Sailor Moon, incluso llegué a leer un par de cómics (herencia afortunada de mis hermanas mayores). Así que desde cuando tenía ganas de leer el manga.Y debo decir que me fascinó: Usagi es una chica llorona y floja que reniega de tener que pelear, pero acepta su destino. Es una niña de 14 años que siente miedo, como todos: pero pese a ello, se intenta armar de valor y luchar. Es una lectura amena, divertida y entrañable.
The time has come!
Powrót do dzieciństwa tak bardzo! Ocena nie może być inna <3Zapomniałam już, jak to jest pięknie narysowane.
Not only that but it has a place in many peoples hearts, so even if you're a fan and you only revisit the series due to nostalgic reasons, you can't ignore just what this series has managed to do in it's time for so many.While it is true that the original manga editions from the 90's aren't the best translation wise, what we must remember was how new the anime and manga industry still was outside of Japan at the time.
I really enjoyed this book, though it was hard to follow because they smushed all the panels together. I really liked the story and Luna!
I've been a Sailor Moon fan since I was four or five years old. I still am, at almost twenty five. The art is so cute and pretty, and the characters are adorable, each in their own way.
I love the art style of this manga and I really enjoyed the story. Usagi really irritated me in the first half but she got better as she got used to what she was doing. I live for Tuxedo Mask.
prima parte a mio parere un po noiosetta perché l'ho vista alla nausea nel anime 😅 dopo inizia a diventare più interessante, spero che i manga si concentrino anche sulla vita delle altre sailor e non solo su usagi.
