“In an undertone, I murmured, "This isn't over. I won't give up on you.""I've given up on you," he said back, voice also soft. "Love fades. Mine has.”  “You forget: I have an addictive personality. I'm addicted to you. Somehow I think you could do all sorts of bad things to me, and I'd still come back to you. Just keep things honest, okay? Tell me what you're feeling. If you're feeling something for Dimitri that's confusing you, tell me. We'll work it out.” This book is like magic! I loved it o
I loved the characters and I loved the action!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Let's start from the beginning:1)I loved the letters Dimitri sent to Rose!
I’d dream about the way you smell and how your dark hair feels like silk between my fingers.
2)I love Adrian but he doesn't fit with Rose.
She loves Dimitri and I accept that but I don't want her to hurt Adrian!
Poor Adrian :(5)I hate Victor but I don't know how I feel about Robert!
After we learnt what we wanted, they escaped!6)I loved Lissa's and Christian's teamwork to learn how to stub a Strigoi!
Another lives, the illegitimate child of Eric Dragomir.
Spirit Bound is a bad book and I am contemplating to remove Richelle Mead from the list of the authors whose writing I care to follow.
But just like in the latest installment of Mead's Georgina Kincaid series, these events are glossed over, everything happens without much effort, there is no tension build-up before each and every one of them, the characters don't experience too many obstacles and therefore there is no real feeling of something important happening.Also, the highest point of the book happens at about 300-page mark.
You know you've read a good book when you turn the final page so ready to start the next chapter but instead you find the acknowledgements and audibly scream "WHAT THE FUCK?!"

SpoilersSpirit Bound, the 5th book in the Vampire Academy series, was a good read, but it was a bit slow.
On top of the slow down in the book Rose was with Adrian and that bugged me.
Then there was the fact that the whole time she was with Adrian she was telling Dimitri that she loves him and wants them to be together again.
I mean I can get that Rose liked Adrian, he is sexy and sweet, but she should have stayed away from him until she was sure her and Dimitri were over.
Overall this book was good but I would have like more Rose and Dimitri time.
The good news is this: Spirit Bound is better than Blood Promises.Now let's all take a deep, satisfying breath of relief for that.But, there is bad news.
I may lean towards Adrian a little but her obsession for Dimitri makes me think that she's nowhere near good enough for him and therefor should stay with Dimitri AND DIE!How am I supposed to respect a heroine who uses her boyfriend's credit card to pay for her trip to Vegas with friends?
"But for now, i think im going to stay at the academy.""Lissa's eyes flew up with a huge grin across her face like a 5 year old on Christmas morning.
"I need to go and talk to Alberta and enroll into this hell school again."This going to just like when me and Lissa came back to St. Vladamir's before, except this time, I'm facing it alone.
Good, i thought.When i reached Alberta's, old but, again, new office, she was sitting in her desk reading something on her computer.
Since i was going to be doing things like i used to, before i left i thought i should go to church.
3.5 starsI can't believe I listened to this in one day.
500 pages has never gone by so fast.At this point in the vampire academy series, I'm kinda ready for it to be over.
I think Rose is absolutely ridiculous and annoying and i'm so tired of her childish words and actions.
The last book is sooo long but it seems like everything could've just wrapped up during this one so I have no clue what else there is to solve, which is irritating.
Regardless, I can't resist an interesting vampire story and I did enjoy this book better than the previous one.
So it took me exactly a year to read this lolol, and yet I still rate it a 4.
Technically, it would be a 5, but since it took me a year, I feel it's only fare to rate it a 4.
So this is me and the VA series: inhale read, something happens and I'm distracted, I watch the movie and that revives my need to read the rest of the books.
So here I am, finishing the 5th book and now I only have 1 more to go.
I really love this series.
This is how it all started:Once upon a time (or should I say four years ago) I was lying in my hospital bad (in a room that had no TV), unable to move, recovering from the car accident.At that time, books were the main entertaiment I had, which I didn't mind since I was a book lover.On that specific day, my friend came for a visit, bringing me a copy of Spirit Bound by Richelle Mead and a box of chocolate.I was already familiar with the fact that books can be fun, but what makes this book special to me is that it showed me the fun on a whole new level.It was like I had a key that can open the door I wasn't even aware of.

I really hope that Dimitri can be saved.
I have a feeling Adrian and Dimitri are half brothers.
Richelle mead couldn't say who the characters are because it would say who lives or dies and rose would have walk in parts.
So obviously Rose lives and I hope Adrian will use spirit to save Dimitri.
I think Adrian will end up with Mia or Victoria (given her and Dimitri have different fathers).
Hopefully Dimitri will be restored to a Moroi so, he and Rose can have children.
I hope Lissa doesn't get the spin off she is alittle boring.
Lissa and Christian should be together.
Como para los perdidos, este quinto libro de Vampire Academy empieza con Rose y Lissa a punto de graduarse del instituto y empezar a ser adultas dentro de la sociedad moroi de la Corte Real.
Si lo recuerdan por el final del cuarto libro, Abe (quien, sorpresivamente, es el padre de Rose) consigue información que apunta a que el hermano de Victor Dashkov, un moroi que puede controlar el espíritu, fue capaz de revertir la conversión de un strigoi.
Es decir, SABÍA que no todo iba a ser color de rosas entre Rose y Dimitri si aún quedaban como 250 páginas de libro.
"I've given up on you... Love fades. Mine has." This fifth installment of the Vampire Academy did surprise me. It has a boring and slow start, but when I got into the middle part of it, I was dumbstrucked with all its epicness.I could not say much about the plot since it will spoil those who haven't yet read this, but the pacing became better. There were more surprising things in the second half of it. Mostly I was stunned by the turn of events-- including that plot twist at the end!Rose was qu
This fifth installment of the Vampire Academy did surprise me.
There were more surprising things in the second half of it.
Mostly I was stunned by the turn of events-- including that plot twist at the end!Rose was quite annoying in this book.
I couldn't deny the fact that I was irritated by her immaturity here but thankfully, her character became better at the final chapters.I could never express how I love this series.
The final book will surely be a blast!Rating: 5 Stars
Rose doesn’t deserve any of the people who love her, not Lissa, not Adrian, not Christian, Eddie, or the help or respect of any of the people that assist her on her journey.
The only reason I root for her is because not rooting for her would be a betrayal to the characters I do love, namely Adrian, Lissa and Christian.Any of those who know my thoughts on this series know I am team Adrian through and through.
I can turn my back on Rose, but I could never turn my back on Adrian.Thankfully, Mead also decided to devote more page time not only to Adrian, but to Lissa and Christian as well.
“You're beautiful in battle," said Dimitri. His cold voice carried to me clearly, even above the roar of combat. "Like an avenging angel come to deliver the justice of heaven.""Funny," I said, shifting my hold on the stake. "That is kind of why I'm here.""Angels fall, Rose.”No matter how hard Rose tries, she just can't escape Dimitri.After her failed atempt at killing him, he won't leave her alone. Now he sents her weekly letters that seem like love letters but are actually threats. In all of t
Dimitri will kill her once they'll meet again.But Rose won't let that happen.
He just does what he wants and doesn't care about anything else.And when he finally get's to Rose and has a clear opportunity to kill her without any problem, he still hesitates just like her.
(Now who forgot the first lesson?)(view spoiler)[Towards the end when he finally comes back as a Dhampir and we're all excited because Now they finally can be together and be happy, he doesn't wants to see her...but he adores Lissa and she doesn't let Rose see him either??
I love Richelle Mead, her writing style just sucks you right in and the characters grow with every book.Anyways like I said, so much happens.
(view spoiler)[ At the beginning of this book Rose keep receiving threat/love letters from Dimitri.
Don't get me wrong I love Adrian but NOT with Rose.
Adrian really is a great guy but Rose will always belong with Dimitri.
In Spirit Bound, When Rose was in Russia she was told a story of a man named Robert Doru who restored a Strigoi back to its former self.
Rose wants Lissa to have no part in the staking of Dimitri.
Roses' heart gets broken by Dimitris rejection.
She IS crazy.•	Lissa has to be the best thing to happen in this book.
Where is Jill btw?•	Another thing about Rose that I hate – the whole book might be about her – but it is impossible how she gets her way ALL THE DAMN TIME.
Everything seems way too convenient for her and it’s unrealistic how EVERYTHING happens in her favor.•	Be reasonable Mead, you don’t have to go out of the way to make us like Rose.
Estoy muy sorprendida con este libro, estuve atrapada en la historia de principio a fin, mi opinión sobre Lissa mejoró enormemente en esta parte de la historia y Adrian se ha ganado mi corazón.Rose como siempre increíble, impulsiva, fuerte, decidida, terca, intensa, un poco egoísta y metida en muchísimos problemas.La trama tiene giros que te dejan sin palabras y el final... dioses, es tan impactante que quieres seguir con el sexto y último libro de la saga de una vez
4,5* Άντριαν σ' αγαπώ 💞Ντιμίτρι μου την έσπασες σε αυτό το βιβλίο, αλλά κάτι πήγες να κάνεις στο τέλος. Το έσωσες λίγο.
I believe Adrian does actually love her and his heart will break if they split.That being said, I wouldn’t be true to myself or honest if I didn’t say that even though I have a soft spot for Adrian, I’ll be cheering for Rose and Dimitri all the way to the very end.Lissa and Christian seemed to work things out, which was great to see.
How can they believe that Rose killed the Queen?
Now that Rose is going to trial it’s gonna be up to Lissa and all her friends to save her and get her out of trouble.And Lissa has a sibling!
Mead, who is clearly in love with Dimitri the same way Stephenie Meyer is in love with Edward, can't let Rose have real feelings for Adrian and move on with him.
If Rose had moved on with Adrian it would have also explained why he would stick around when her feelings began to waver since he would have had something real to miss and want to hold on to.But all of the problems with this book are common to books that star Mary Sues.
She's not punished for her selfish behavior regarding Dimitri or Adrian.
The relationship-focused parts of the story made up for that a little bit, although Rose's behaviour around Adrian made me very angry.
(view spoiler)[I really think this series could have redeemed itself had Mead had the guts to kill Dimitri off in the last book.
I think I read only two thirds of this one without skimming, and I don't feel like I missed something important at all.
Also, I always feel a little stupid as a reader when an author thinks she has to repeat everything for me.
4/5The 5th book in the series took me a little longer than I would have liked but I'm glad I was able to finish it.
There were so many things that surprised me in this book and I was very glad for it.
During the middle of the book however, I gotten a little bored.
I kept going on though because I was (and still am) so interested about learning about Dimitri and how Rose is going to fix everything.
I loved reading and learning more about the side characters such as Lissa and Christian and Adrean.
Dimitri and Rose were the two main reasons I loved Vampire Academy and half of that equation is now missing.
What Mead did to Dimitri in Blood Promise and now Spirit Bound has me wondering if I'll ever be able to redeem him as a character.I have a tough time when characters in a book either physically or emotionally hurt or injure a protagonist that I've come to like, in this case Rose, and Dimitri has flawlessly done both to her.
There was a time when I'd wave my Save Team Dimitri flag with pride and hope, but that flag is no more.
I find it very challenging to review this book because it was good in so many ways that can't be explained without spoilers.
But worry not, this review is Spirit Bound Spoilers Free.
Spirit Bound starts back at the Academy, it's finally graduation time and Rose has only one more challenge in front of her: The Trials.
Spirit Bound was action-packed, full of surprises, emotions and magic.
I think Shadow Kiss is still my favorite of the series because I'm such a romantic but Spirit Bound is very close second.
I love the dhampire Dimitri and Rose relationship dearly but sadly i dont think its gonna work out too well.
I was hoping that Dimitri would be un-happy being strigoi or that somehow his love for Rose would transcend the evil and darkness that comes with being a strigoi but it didnt and because of that i dont think their relationship will ever be the same...How ever part of me still has hope for them...in more detail i think that 2 things can happen here.
Can't wait to start reading Last Sacrifice!!
I can't believe I have only one more book left in the series!
I'm not ready for Rose's story to be over.
I liked this installment just as much as the previous ones.
Lissa and Adrian were my favourites, my two darling spirit users!
Rose annoyed me at times.
I feel like she does things to achieve her goals without thinking of the people she might hurt in the process.
But she always ends up realizing the consequences of her actions and tries to make things right.
I can't wait to see what happens in the final book especially after that ending!
Δεν θα σχολιάσω κάτι για αυτό το βιβλίο. Ένα μόνο έχω να πω....ανυπομονώ για το επόμενο !!!
