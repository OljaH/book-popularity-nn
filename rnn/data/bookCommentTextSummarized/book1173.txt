I read the Dutch translation of the book as part of the Autumn challenge 2012 of the Netherlands & Flanders group. As such, a short review in Dutch can be found at http://www.goodreads.com/topic/show/1...
This novel which describes the stories of several residents of a Norwegian sanatorium has often been compared to Thomas Mann's more famous magic mountain which it closely resembles in terms of its inordinate length and tediousness.
I loved it. He writes beautifully and although it was first published in 1976 it is still Very modern.
