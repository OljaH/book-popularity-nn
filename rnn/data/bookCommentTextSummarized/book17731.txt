I think the only way I can make sense of it is to break it down into points.1) This book is very different from The Girl on the Train.That ad that keeps flashing up saying "If you liked The Girl on the Train, you'll love Into the Water" is bullshit.
I like all the interlocking stories and histories going on within this town and how every character has some reason to seem guilty.3) It's not as suspenseful as The Girl on the Train.Or, at least, it wasn't for me.
congratulations, 2017 goodreads choice winner in best mystery & thriller!! oooh, goodreads choice awards semifinalist for best mystery! what will happen? review posted at los angeles review of books!! here:https://lareviewofbooks.org/article/a...reviewing this for L.A. review of books - and they sent me a finished book instead of an ARC! these britches! i have become too big for them!
This story is unique and its large cast of characters are bold and distinguishable.
In keeping up with the “girls gone missing/crazy/dead” theme that seems to be all-the-rage-and-staying-that-way-dammit, this plot surrounds the mystery of a series of girls (past and present) whose lifeless bodies have turned up in the infamous “Drowning Pool”.
Every character is questionable, which is typical and fun, but there are instances when *blame* can seem to spread too evenly between suspects, as was the case here for me.
It makes the focus on each character too equal and sort of dulls the opportunity for surprise.
This is not an easy book to get into.
Lots of diverse characters and you are left trying to suss out who’s who and what is happening and why so many people don't seem to like Nel and are glad she's dead.
But the book does grab you.
You only see glimpses, back and forth, but they are fascinating, shimmering glimpses, like trying to determine what's underneath the water.
Nel is the latest death in the drowning pool.
Girls and women have either been put to death or killed themselves here for centuries.
And there's plenty of blame to go around.
When I first started reading this "much-awaited" second novel by Paula Hawkins, I was so impressed by her ability to create such an eerie, chilling description of what I had hoped was a taste of what was to come--reminiscent of old, black-and-white, British movies.
I remember wondering at the time she was writing, if she might have been imagining this book becoming another movie.
After bouncing me around from one character to the next through the first half of the book, my interest quickly started to wane.
At no time did I feel any suspense building nor could I form a connection with any of the unlikable characters.
Nel was completely obsessed with stories of 'troublesome' women who had lost their lives in the 'Drowning Pool' including a 14 year old girl pronounced as a witch during the Witchfinder Trials in the seventeenth century.Nel leaves behind a daughter, (15 year old Lena) who appears to harbour secrets of her own, and she's just one of many in this small town of Beckford.
It's a small town with big secrets.The tragedy brings Nel's sister Jules back to the place she swore she'd never return to.
Ummmmmm........I wouldn't recommend listening to a book for the first time on audio with 6,695 POV's!
I may read the physical book and see if I like it.
I just can't like this book at this time.
I would never have gotten the audio if the summary would have said there are 1500 people in the book!
I don't feel like reading about rapists and a bastard that drowns a cat.
I guess The Drowning Pool is a good name for the river, lake, water.
So, I guess it's whatever you like it don't like 😊Happy Reading!
Twisted, suspenseful, spooky & eerie--mysterious to the very end--( wasn't even expecting I like this book much- so nice surprise) I found the book free in "The Little Library"...box-give-a-way-exchange in front of a neighbors house.........gorgeous descriptions and visuals created of scenery --an enthralling textured large cast of characters, ( lots of thinking about these people), and an ending that stopped me cold. Taunting exquisite prose. I might have liked this more than "The Girl On The Train"....It was more multi-layered. 4.5 rating!

Find my full review here: http://crimebythebook.com/blog/2017/4...This book was, unfortunately, a disappointment to me. Convoluted plotting, WAY too many characters to keep track of, and an overall lack of suspense made for a less than engaging read. I'm sure many readers will enjoy this one, but if you're looking for a psychological thriller with the addictive pacing & shocking plot twists of THE GIRL ON THE TRAIN, I wouldn't recommend this one.
3.5 starsThe good news: THE GIRL ON THE TRAIN was not a fluke. The not-so-great news: this book's plot and characters are less compelling, and its flaws much more obvious. Review to come of the audio edition.
I lost patience with INTO THE WATER early on. By page 32, I counted seven different POVs. Confusing! A few more POVs were added after that. Basically the story was about a place called "The Drowning Pool" where several women died, beginning in the 1600s. The latest death is a woman who was writing a book about this seemingly cursed place. Sounded promising, but turned out to be dull. Needed more suspense! I was looking forward to this book, but in the end it was just meh.
That is very, very good to know, and if you are planning on reading this book, you will be glad you were forewarned.
My point is, TGOTT was above average, and was a catalyst for many other wonderful books brought to press, but it was not THAT great, in my opinion, so my expectations were not unreasonably high to start off with, but I was still curious to see how the author responded to all that hype with the publication of her second novel.
Sometimes when a book achieves a pinnacle of success, it’s almost impossible for an author to replicate it.
Keeping characters in the grey zone is important within a suspense novel; readers need to know that they might be missing part of the picture, but in the end, it should be clearer than it was in this book.
It was clear the entire way that something wasn’t right with a certain character, yet the twist in the end doesn’t do any justice to ‘why’ certain things happened.All that said… as I kept turning the page, my interest was held and I liked many aspects of the book.
First things first, I want to point out how very rare it is for me to rate a book 1 star.
In fact, in the last 5 years, I have read a total of 1,257 books, and only rated 20 of them with a 1 star.
The writing basically deceived me into thinking this was better than it was.I'm going to break down what didn't work for me:-the beginning is extremely confusing, multiple POVs and no context of the character.
I mean, how can you write 170 pages of a book, and not have a coherent plot in place?
I really liked Girl on the Train, so maybe I was expecting too much. SO MANY characters (and way too many POVs) and kind of a tangled plot. By the end I didn't care much about who had done what.
This train is headed into a very dark tunnel.The Drowning Pool is known to its surrounding inhabitants as a draw for women who seem to end their lives quite badly.
Don't think you should get off at this stop.Nel Abbott takes to writing a history of these events.
But Hawkins stuck with her three main characters in that one who kept her storyline riveted to the tracks and delivering at the final station.
The talent oozes out of Paula Hawkins like delicious ice cream on a hot day.
This novel was one of my highly anticipated reads for 2017.
But, we tend to all do that a little bit unfortunately.This one was a little difficult for me to get into and I was pretty confused at the start of the novel.
I do have to say towards the end I was a little confused again with trying to connect the dots.
I found my attention span swaying in and out of the story due to confusion.
It definitely helps not to read reviews before you begin!
So come back and share when you have read it!!
The writing was definitely above that in TGotT, and I appreciated the variety of characters and voices in this one.
It's definitely not as thrilling or intense as her first novel.
I thought it was more of a developed story and had complexities that TGotT lacked; but it almost sacrificed that excitement I expected from Hawkins for a bit of a dragging plot to focus on the characters.
If it had balanced these two elements—plot and character development—just a bit more, I think it could've been a 4 star book for me.
I really just wasn't into this book. I was lost most of the time and not able to keep up! There were too many characters in the book to keep track of. Just not a book for me :(
Those who stayed behind after the latest death of Nel Abbott had to deal with the mysterious attraction to the Drowning Pool in the river for women committing suicide.
It was the legends surrounding these mysterious deaths that attracted Danielle(Nel) Abbott to the pool for the book she was writing about these women and their demises.
Nickie: "Some of them went into the river willingly and some didn't, and if you asked Nickie - not that anyone would, because no one ever did - Nel Abbott went in fighting.
However, I was very pleasantly surprised at just how much I truly enjoyed this entertaining book - its completely different in every aspect and although slow burning it still races along and keeps you constantly entertained.Blurb - 'In the last days before her death, Nel Abbott called her sister.
And most of all she’s afraid of the water, and the place they call The Drowning Pool.....'There are quite a few characters to get your head around initially but there's a very helpful cast at the front of the book that really helped and it all soon fell into place and I was immersed in them all.
I was one of the fans of Girl on a Train but this is something else. Beautiful writing, totally immersive narrative, multiple viewpoints and clever little twists, its like Paula Hawkins had a bit of a practice with that girl on that train and then went YEP I can do this better so gives us Into The Water. Full review nearer publication.
This novel was averagely enjoyable for me – not especially good, but not bad either.I should start by saying that I was one of the readers who liked “The Girl On The Train” but didn’t think it was overly impressive.
Hawkins developed a secretive side for almost every character which seemed a bit overkill and highly unlikely.
With that being said, I think that some of the narrators could have easily been omitted and it wouldn’t have taken anything away from the story.I liked the short chapters that kept the story fresh.
This was a tangled mess.
The story is told by numerous characters from their own perspectives.
It bounces back and forth in time.
It also includes some pages written by one of the deceased.
Sometimes this writing method overly confuses things, and this time is one of them.
I had lots of trouble keeping the characters straight.
I had to stop at one point, go back to the beginning and make notes of character names and relationships.
There were also a few times I had to go back to review certain details of the plot.Overall I enjoyed the storyline.
There's no one left to help me.She flares towards the wildly dramatic, I mean that her writing style is overwrought and sometimes laughably full of drama.However, for some unknown reason she puts a dozen or so perspectives in here.
She tells this story from so many people's points of view.
Moreover, who cares?!I also have a real problem with (view spoiler)[child rape.
o.O It's very hard for me to read about and that was really the point where I abandoned ship.
(hide spoiler)]Your tastes may vary....UPDATE: I have removed this from my DNF shelf as I have finished the book.
DNF @ 35%The writing style and mass amount of POV's is annoying me to no end.
I was highly anticipating this novel, as were a lot of us, I suspect, after Girl on the Train .
I was careful at the beginning to keep them in order and that helped with my enjoyment of this novel.I won't recap because there are fantastic reviews out there from one to five stars.
The folklore about the river at the beginning set the stage to its power and mystery.
The telling of the story about its two latest victims had me turning the pages to know their intent and draw to the river.
Part IV wrapped the novel up nicely and left me with a feeling of satisfaction.
Instagram || Twitter || Facebook || Amazon || PinterestPaula Hawkins's work falls rather easily into a category that I - yes, patronizingly - call a "best-seller book." These types of books are too "high brow" to be considered a pulpy potboiler (which I love) but too "low brow" to be considered true literary fiction (which I also love). Book clubs love them, which is pretty much the only reason I ever end up reading these types of books. As far as I can tell, "best-seller books" are basically t
As far as I can tell from INTO THE WATER and THE GIRL ON THE TRAIN, Paula Hawkins writes about irritating, whiny little stereotypes who are all equally unlikable, and it's less about finding the murderer than who shares the greatest percentage of the blame.
Pretty quickly, it turns out that a number of them had good reasons to want the Pond Woman dead, and it might just be murder and not suicide.
But if you were like me, and found yourself compelled by a book club (or morbid curiosity) to pick this up after reading and being burned by THE GIRL ON THE TRAIN and its false comparisons to GONE GIRL, let me save you the trouble - DON'T.
When Jules sister is found dead in their home town in the place known locally as The Drowning Pool, she is both horrified and yet unsurprised as Nel was always obsessed with it and the tales of witches and suicides around it. However when things start to look like Nel was pushed not only are their families secrets and fractured relationships but those of the whole town. Brilliant. If it looks like it took ages to read I had an operation in the middle. Ha.
