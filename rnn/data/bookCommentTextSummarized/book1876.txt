Fun poems and stories for kidsA nice collection of poems with a few longer stories thrown in. I particularly liked the long story about the house that was lonely when it's family went away on a trip.
NO!!! ðŸ˜ˆi have a great way to make this book a bit better.So you have to get it to be shorter ... for the little ones (like a 5 year old) it will be interesting butvery hard for them.I am not being unkind to you Estelle Rowsell ðŸ”š
Sorry storiesI really liked it. the story about the sunset is a must read it is real cute my favorite from this book.
