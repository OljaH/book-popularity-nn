SPOILER FREE - HAPPY HAPPY, JOY JOY REVIEW!The first book was good.
The second book was great.
Sorry, my mind wasn't able to comprehend real words there for a second.....
Oh yeah, Faefever.First off, let me say - Best first four words of a book ever!
And that's preeta cool!So, it got off to a great start, but KMM's answers are just never simple, are they?Barrons just oozes sensuality.
I hate her for not giving me exactly what I want.
Spoiler FREE.For the second book, Bloodfever.
Spoiler Alert!!!The fourth book, Dreamfever.
Spoiler FREE.The fifth and final book, Shadowfever.
Mac Version 3.0I start this book expecting little sweet Barbie Mac.......and this happens. Someone starts mailing Mac pages from her sister's Alina's journal and that start making her think. Then the two main guys that have been playing her still won't answer any questions. They seem to want to just use her for their own purposes. Well, Mac starts getting tired of it. She starts to realize that she is all she has on her side. She must not rely on a man to come save her! Hells yeah. She starts us

Well, Mac starts getting tired of it.
She starts to realize that she is all she has on her side.
I think the first two books were fun for me..NOW I'VE BECOME A FANATIC!!There were times when I probably would have thrown my panties at V'lane and Barrons..but then there were times I'd have smacked the shit out of them.
I'm only getting one of these books a month!
Nothing works anymore.In book 3 of the Fever series, Mac comes to realize that all the men in her life are trash and she needs to branch out; place some eggs in different baskets, if you will.
Well.KMM likes to hold on to nearly all of her cards until the end of book 5, Shadowfever.
I think you'd be hard-pressed to guess the series ending.But rereading while holding all the answers already is a whole different matter.
I mean, do you really love a book series if reading it doesn't put you through hell and back?
I’ve said before that I was always there, but reading this takes me beyond that every time, makes me want to hate-morph into the living, breathing embodiment of her vengeance, pick up her spear and stab everyone that so much as looks at her wrong.She’s just so…alone.*sob*It seems the only information she learns is that which she’s able to barter, beg, steal, or discover for herself.
Understanding the manner of their secrets as I now do, having already read the series several times, I get why they wouldn’t want to reveal them to her until they could be sure of her loyalty.
If I were to wait a year to find out what happens to Mac next, I'd be royally pissed right now, because as much as I liked the book, I think this kind of ending is unacceptable and disrespectful to the series' fans.Faefever is a very dark book and it starts out dark too.
Like the previous two books - Darkfever and Bloodfever, there is not much resolution to any big problem/mystery, but there is progress.
I am extremely attached to the series now, to Mac and Jericho, and the entire world of Fae, sidhe-seers and Rhino-boys.
“Who the fuck are you, Ms. Lane?”Rage filled me. Rage at what had been done to her. Rage at him for bringing it up. The thought that no one could see or judge me was liberating. I swelled with grief and anger.“Now tell me who you are.”“Vengeance,” I said in a cold voice. There are certain things in my life that remains comfortingly constant despite the chaos that sometimes peppers my life. For instance, the sky is blue. 70% dark chocolate is delicious. I look really good in dark green.Jericho B
The contrast and complexities in his character is particularly more notable for me today, coming off the recent reading of a particularly forgettable UF/PNR book, with forgettable characters.I still don't like Jericho that much, but I love his character.
Leaving you to wonder if that spark of humanity was ever there in the first place.That's the thing that attracts me about Jericho's character...that's what FINALLY grew on me in this book.
Her character develops beautifully in this book.The first time around, despite my contempt for the characters, I absolutely loved the setting, the writing, the darkness of it all.
hmmmmmmmmmmmm WELL...   Even with a lot of my questions still unanswered...Even though I was still waiting to fall in love with Jericho and that still didn't happen... and even with the ending being spoiled for me (THANKS GIRL WHO PUT THE FREAKING ENDING IN THE FIRST SENTENCE OF HER REVIEW WITH NO WARNING!!! SPECIAL PLACE IN HELL FOR YOU!) I still give this book a perfect five!!!  Though all questions weren't answered we learn so much more in this book. I was also happy that there was a lot mor
Even with a lot of my questions still unanswered...Even though I was still waiting to fall in love with Jericho and that still didn't happen...
and even with the ending being spoiled for me (THANKS GIRL WHO PUT THE FREAKING ENDING IN THE FIRST SENTENCE OF HER REVIEW WITH NO WARNING!!!
Though all questions weren't answered we learn so much more in this book.
so much so that I ran out and bought book four and am starting it tonight.
READ THIS REVIEW AND OTHERS OVER ON OUR BLOG SOUTHERN BRED SOUTHERN READSOUTHERN BRED SOUTHERN READSOUTHERN BRED SOUTHERN READ
Fourth Read January 2018: 4 starsThird Read October 2015: 4 stars Second Read November 2014: 5 starsFirst Read September 2014: 5 starsFour times and that ending still gets me!
New thoughts: There are favorite scenes (they all include Barrons), but parts of this made me want to start skimming.
This is the one where Mac spends a lot of time with the "other characters." Where the supporting characters and overall plot gets fleshed out more.
She's still flawed and making (beginner) mistakes which is totally understandable, in my view.New thoughts about my second read of this book: I did notice some repetitiveness in the beginning and found myself wanting to skim through the sections of Mac's longer inner dialoguing.
Plot: 5 starsCharacters: 5 starsWriting: 5 starsSexiness: 5 starsEnding: 5 starsOverall: 5 starsBy the way, did anyone else kind of wet themselves laughing at the Mac Halo incident? I cannot listen to the song 'Bad Moon Rising' without going into hysterics.
I can't remember how I felt about the whole book because the end left me hopeless. The first three books were definitely leading up to something bigger. All the events could have been put into one book, so I'm eager to read the 4th with the changes set in motion by this one. I adore all the characters, Mac is so real, and Barron's is just an ass. I hate him but he's such an enigma.
I just finished the third book and I already want to start reading it again.
I am rolling around on the floor with these books in my arms, I want to clear Amazon's entire stock of this series and shove copies at everybody who comes within a 10-mile radius, screaming "WHY AREN'T YOU READING THIS RIGHT NOW" in their faces.
mostly about Barrons pressing me up against the wall and pinning my arms above my head with one hand.I love how much Mac's character is growing, I can see, feel her changing while I'm there, watching her!
Reread: 10/31/18 Is it just me that I want to wish wholeheartedly "Happy birthday Jericho Barrons!" every year this day?
Or am I the weirdest fan of the series in GR?----------------------------------------First review:31st of October.This book has the best and the most unforgettable birthday party.
It is Halloween and it is Barron’s birthday.Mac appears to the bookstore with a big pink cake just for him.Surprise!Will he be happy and feel touched because someone remembered his birthday?
I don’t think so…Barrons does not like birthdays.
He does not like surprises.
He does not like big pink cakes."Never do that again, Ms. Lane.
I swear Karen Marie Moning is attempting to sexually frustrate me to death.Well GOOD TRY KAREN. I survived again.
Fact #3: Voice lessonsBecause JZB wants to know if Mac had sex with V'Lane.
Until next time.***********Original review (November 2014)MacHalo buddy read starting November, 17 2014.This book was a DNF waiting to happen.
The prologue was pretty good: I could have done without the recap about the previous books but I always enjoy Mac's narrative in the prologues for this series (she comes across as a much stronger character than she actually is - more on that later).
Barrons, V'Lane and Mac on the street.
When darkness falls, who will make a stand and help the city live to see another day?Mac seems to be the only one determined to make a stand.
Her lessons with Barrons, the memory of her sister, the reluctant answers from V'lane and the budding sisterhood with Dani, a fellow teenager sidhe-seer, seem to give her the strength she needs.
HOLY FREAKING HELL!Utterly heartbreaking, dream-crashing and soul-punching (I just come up with words because english fail me when I am upset..) the ending was every nightmare come true.
¿Quéeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee????????? ¿Cómo se le ocurre a la Moning hacernos esto????? Por Dios! esto no es serio.... Qué manera de hacernos sufrir.
5 THIS-SERIES-IS-MY-COMFORT-ZONE-STARS!!!!!!! What is the greater good but tyranny’s chameleon? This series is the perfect escape, and I love every single second. The Sinsar Dubh:This book continues from Bloodfever. Mac continues her search to find her sister’s murderer and seek revenge. She begins to find more people who can provide her with resources, yet she is still very much alone in her battle. We still don’t know much about Barrons. There are tiny hints here and there, but they only seem
This series is the perfect escape, and I love every single second.
Mac continues her search to find her sister’s murderer and seek revenge.
Barrons was powerful, broodingly good-looking, insanely wealthy, frighteningly intelligent, and had exquisite taste, not to mention a hard body that emitted some kind of constant low-level charge.
Chiseled from savagery by a sculptor-savant, Barrons is a throwback to a lawless time, and looks as stoically primitive as he behaves.
My Mac:
I had to find a picture of the pi cake because I loved this part!I want Barrons to Voice ME….
Re-read: 2014This is the Fever book where shit gets all crazy.The walls are coming down, bitches!It's also the one where KMM dumps you at the end with a horrifying cliffhanger.
This was a great book to end this year on.And if you haven't jumped on the Fever bandwagon, you don't know what you're missing!Original Review: 2009Oh my God!
I can't believe the ending on this one!
4.5 starsWell the first part of the fecking book was slow enough. Not enough fecking Barrons. But once I got to fecking 80% it took off like a tornado. Holy Crap, me heart was fecking beating out of me chest.Well, they say, good things will come to those who wait Who the fcuk are “they” and how the hell do they know….Yes, I was waiting, waiting and more waiting for some sex scenes…. Not happening. I was lying on the ground, beneath Barron’s wild, electric body, ripping his shirt open, and splayi

Feeling like he was inside me, or I was inside him.

4.5 fever-frenzy StarsOctober 29 ( 2 days to go)Dear Diary Hey There, I feel like I’m coming undone, like the fabric of my existence unwound.
Barrons says that it’s our fears that get us killed… but how am I supposed to not be afraid?
I want to wake up and discover that this fae congested world is just a frogging dream, but it isn’t.
I can handle the fae, I can handle the employer who is absentee at best but losing Alina: that is a reality that haunts me every day.
[4.5 Stars]
If you're looking for a story so gritty, scary, and yet real and addictive...then go RIGHT NOW and pick up all three books in this series.
There's V'lane, the death-by-sex fae who claims to want 'the Book' for his Queen to keep the walls between the worlds strong.
In Faefever, Mac finally spends some time with Christian MacKeltar--a Druid from a pretty impressive family lineage of Druids who battle to protect humanity by preserving the 'Compact' with the Fae Queen.But in the end, it all comes down to Mac. She's the only one alive who can sense the object/s they all want.
ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME?!WHAT THE FUCK KIND OF ENDING IS THAT?!?!?!No wonder you crazy lot of  MacHalo Freaks  always go straight onto book four. FARK.
Hope strengthens. Fear kills. Yes, hope does, in fact, strengthen. The hope that Barrons will save Mac’s ass (pun not intended) from this fecking ending!My exact reactions:*pause**blink**read paragraph again**blink**pause*First thing’s first. This is the second time I read Faefever. Some things get better, now that I know what’s going to happen in the next book. Some things don’t really change, aka the ending. It was cruel the first time, and it’s still cruel the second time I went through it.I
The hope that Barrons will save Mac’s ass (pun not intended) from this fecking ending!My exact reactions:*pause**blink**read paragraph again**blink**pause*First thing’s first.
It was cruel the first time, and it’s still cruel the second time I went through it.I just love how each book changes.
Mac is, in my opinion, one of the symbols of kick ass female leads in the urban fantasy genre.I think that Faefever is the best book in the Fever series so far, and trust me (I’m a doctor) the next books will be even better.
In Dreamfever, you’ll get a nice little treat to make up for this perversion.
Moning’s fans have quickly learned that the author has the ability to write some unbelievably compelling cliffhangers and this installment was no different.The things I especially liked about this particular book:--Christian MacKelter (mmm, young druid man, I hope to see him get his own book in the Highlander series.
Wow, total fangirl moment there.)--V’lane dressing Mac in sleazy bikinis (hilarious, I could totally picture it)--learning more about the Lord Master--more clues about who/what Barrons is (dun, dun, dun!)The ending killed me *sad face* and I’m OMGCAN’TWAIT for the next book and desperately wish I hadn’t discovered the series until all five had been published.
Loving.
Holy.
F.I mean...
Bloody hell!That ending!?!?Holy smokin' balls...
I would be so pissed right now if I didn't have access to the next book in this series immediately.
Mac is finally coming into her own and I'm loving that evolution.
Barrons is still an alpha-hole mystery.
(And I love that.) The tension between the two of them is so thick you can barely breathe at times.
Though I think I know where Barrons mystery identity is going, I'm not ruling anything out at this point...
I mean, the whole world was just turned upside down.
immediately on to the next one!
AMAN TANRIM!
AMAN TANRIM!
AMAN TANRIMM!O SON NEYDİ ÖYLE ?!
Çığlık çığlığa bağırasım var.
NERDESİN BARRONS NERDESİN V'LANE!
diye ortalığı ayağa bile kaldırabilirim.
Resmen okurken içimden ateş çıktı.
Kitap bittiğinde yüzüm yanıyordu.
Lanet olsun ya.
Şimdi ne olacak ?Mac ne halt yiyecek ?Dublin daha ne hale düşecek ?NEREDE BU BARRONS?!
Ayrıca BARRONSUN HALA NE OLDUĞUNU ÖĞRENEMEDİK ÇOK SİNİRLİYİM.
TAHAMMÜLÜM KALMADI.
VE HALA BAYAN LANE DEMEYE DEVAM EDİYOR.
O PEMBE PASTAYI ALIP BARRONSUN YÜZÜNE YAPIŞTIRASIM VAR.
Neyse tamam sakinleşmem lazım.
Ama sakinleşemiyorum.
Dört falan vermeyi düşünüyordum aslında ama o son sayfalar dehşetti ya.
Ayrıca serinin devamını almamak için zor tutuyorum kendimi çatlamak üzereyim.

This installment was action packed and once again added a few more players to the chess board.  "Where do your loyalties lie, Ms. Lane?"

"Where do your loyalties lie, Ms. Lane?"
The book’s true identity has been revealed, Barrons is still elusive about who and what he is, the hot prince is still gifting beach time with hot bikinis, Mac makes friends with the police as well as Dani and others like her.
”I think she’ll obey me now, he murmured.
Obey him?I’d die for him.”
I’m diving into the next book because I need answers.
I'm putting on my MacHalo and packing extra batteries.
So many things are foreshadowed and I think the 2 main reasons I had for a lower rating were that 1 Barrons and Mac didn't seem to have as much time together and I got a little focused on that since I really wanted more for their relationship and I needed to know who/what Barrons was and got no real answers this book.
When he asked questions about V'lane you could tell how jealous he was and even though they never say it how much he wants her but is restraining himself.When I finished the book this time it didn't shock me as much and I really read through the scene and I think I better understand what the author was trying to portray in the story.
While there are secrets being kept against her, I can’t fault some of the other characters for not trusting her yet more either, since she’s playing so many angles and sides that it could compromise everything.Like the first two books, this focuses on the progression of the overall story but still holds a lot of punches back.
So much still by this point I don’t know and wonder about, but that kept me glued.You finally get a little more on the personal relationship with Barrons as well, even though he is still being frustrating at times.
