though I do not wholly agree internalizing God as part of the subconscious, I do see where the idea id divine knowledge comes from.
I do like the idea of the subconscious being a conduit to the divine how many times do we have something in the back of our mind and it comes to pass exactly as we envisioned it.
Other thing like instinct and intuition also come from the subconscious.This is an great informative, easy to read and most of all helpful book.
It has made me aware of the enormously faculty we have to use our full capacity of our mind to do so many good things to become much better to start living and seeing ourselves capable of accomplishing what ever you set your mind to be or do. I would recommend this book to everyone. I rate this book as excellent to me is an awakening! I bought this book at special price from here:https://www.amazon.com/Power-Your-Sub...
كتاب عبارة عن "خرابيط " متجمعةأحيانا أشعر أن بعض الكتب تعطي من العقل الباطن حجما مبالغا فيهحتى أنك تشعر بأنه لا وجود للقضاء والقدر في حياتنا ... كل شيء يحدث بفعل العقل الباطنفإن فشلت فإن العقل الباطن هو السبب لأنك لم تواجهه وتجعله يقتنع بفكرة النجاحوحينما تحدثت مع أحد كبار المدربين المقتنعين بهذا العقل الباطنأخبرني بأن العقل الباطن هو حلقة الوصل بين الله سبحانه وتعالى والانسانوأن الله سبحانه وتعالى يأمر العقل الباطن فيتأثر الانسان بذلك....حقا لا أعلم لمتى نستمع لمثل هذه النظريات العجيبة ونحاول أسلمتها ونسلم بصحتها دون أن نرى ماذا تناقض في ديننا
This is one that needs to be re-read many times, which I will do.
Train your mind with Optimal Thinking and you won't have to settle for second best!
Some of the positive affirmations mentioned in this book, worked wonders for my life.
The power of subconscious mind is really powerful if we really believe in it.
I don't know if this is just a coincidence (I don't believe in coincidences), or is it because my subconscious mind started working for me (affirmative).
This book can help in giving a new way to look at this life, a new perspective of sorts.

قوة عقلك الباطن بالفعل كتاب رائع ..
-أفضل وقت لتجنب الطلاق هو قبل الزواج الزواج هو اتحاد رجل وامرأة ,يربط الحب بين قلبيهما يخفقان كقلب واحد يتحركان في طريق واحد الى الامام وفي اتجاه الله -ثق بنفسك وستنجح وستكون سعيدا ..
* مسح سريع للكتاب :الكتاب ٢٠ فصل في ٢٩٨ صفحة ، يبدأ متدرجاً في ماهو العقل الباطن ، تأثيره ، طريقة تلقينه ، نماذج وقصص متنوعة ، كيف تتغلب على ..... الخ ، وينتهي بالفصل المذهل ( كيف تعيش بروح الشباب إلى الأبد ) !( من وجهة نظري الخاصة للكتاب أظن بأن الكاتب أسرف قليلاً في سرد المواقف ( وهي تحتوي نفس الفكرة تقريباً ) مما أضافت بعض الملل الذي اضطرني إلى تجاهل بعضها ، لكنها قد تكون ممتعه لدى البعض
Many claims, not a sniff of evidence. Bullshit
You may have to read (or listen to) this book a few times to fully absorb it.
When it started (the audio version) I thought, this guy is talking too fast, there is no serene and calming background music, he said conscious-unconscious mind like a billion times, and the first 15-20 min I couldn't wait for it to finish so I can rate it poorly.
*grins* But something happened, I adapted to his pace and started listening and LIKING the book.
If you get a rash if you hear/read someone mentioning God, then you might wanna skip this one.
There are far too many biblical references and one begins to suspect there is a religious driver behind this.2.
Can you seriously expect to influence someone else's health with the power of your sub-conscious - come on.
Does your sub-conscious mind really heal a cut leg?
Sadly I've been dreaming of being a James Bond sort of a guy and having women flocking to me for the whole of my life and it still hasn't happened!I do believe in the power of the sub-conscious but the author makes far too many claims for its power and how the conscious mind can influence it.
I found this book about 6 months ago and it's changed my view of many things and offered a paradigm shift in how I look at and react to daily circumstances and life's challenges.
Many of Dr. Murphy's books have been compiled posthumously through Hay House and they are all very helpful and wise in the teachings, including subjects such as being successful and prosperous.It's a seminal book that has influenced millions of people and Dr. Murphy's teachings are timeless and very positive.
The affirmations and quotes are very helpful on a daily basis.
It is, of course, which is why this stuff does work, just not as spectacularly as Mr. Murphy claims in his homilies of people who thought their way to fabulous wealth or curing a cancer.
The better application is to cure a long-standing fear you have or a mental block.
You can indeed think your way to a cure of the ways in which your mind is holding you back.
But to say you can cure cancer or MS by thinking is -- implicitly -- to blame the desperately ill for their diseases, and that's just cruel.
كملته بالعافية نفس الفكرة بتتكرر في الكتاب كله وهو ان اي حاجة انت عاوزها مجرد ما تحطها في دماغك وتقن
Viena blogiausių mano skaitytų knygų. Vietoj to, kad padėtų tobulinti save, kėlė pyktį ir erzino. Vietomis buvo pasiektas aukščiausias nusišnekėjimo lygis... Pv. "pasamonė slypi tonzilėse".... taip išeina, kad tas žmogus, kuriam pašalintos tonzilės yra be pasamonės. Ir apskritai toks žmogus turėtų būti negyvas, nes, pasak autoriaus, tonzilės tai vienas iš organų, kuris valdo gyvybines funkcijas.... Ir tokių nusišnekėjimų buvo tikrai ne vienas ir ne du.Labai labai nusivyliau šita rašliava. Nerekomenduoju.
this book is MY BIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!since 1994!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I wanted to read the Secret but got the DVD instead and as a Christian and Catholic actually stopped watching it because I didn't think Bob Proctor gave God the credit He deserves in all of this.
I was still drawn to the "secret" ideas and thinking though and I was looking for something similar but with a Christian injection.
Joseph Murphy wrote the exact book I needed to read.Guard your thoughts for you are what you think about all day.
This book can help you heal physically, emotionally and spiritually.
ربما هذا التقييم العالي للكتاب مبني على اسباب ومشاكل احاطت بي في زمن قراءة الكتاب.
لكن الكتاب بالمجمل نافع جداً، وذلك لأهتمامه بالعقل كأساس للحكم على الظروف المحيطة.الكتاب يركز على الاهتمام بالقوة الباطنية العقلية كأساس لجميع الاعمال التي نقوم بها ومن اهمها:1.
فمثلاً، تعريفي للسعادة يجب ان لا ينبني على اسباب خارجية.
بل اسباب داخلية.
الايحائات الايجابية والسلبية والتي يبنى عليه العديد من القرارات الانسانيةوايضا الكثير من المعلومات المهمة صراحة، لا استطيع ذكرها كلها.الكتاب مهم وسهل القراءة في حقل التنمية الذاتية.
هناك من قيّم هذا العمل بناءً على بعض فصوله، وانا موافق على ان هناك بعض الفصول غير واقعية بالمرة.
لكن هناك العديد من الامور الصحيحة والقابلة للتطبيق.

this book is unbelievably good, it changed alot of my thinking... for me, I'm already familiar to these ideas (depending on the religious teachings) but I've never known about the scientific basics of them! interesting, and I strongly recommend this book! :)
أثناء قرائتي للكتاب تذكرت مقولة "إذا أردت شيئاً بشدة فأطلق سراحه، إن عاد فهو ملك لك.." . هنا يقول ميرفي لا، لا تطلق سراحه! بل فكر به بشدة.. قل لنفسك دائماً انا استطيع ان أقوم بذلك، هذا سهل وأنا عندي القدرة للوصول لاكثر من هذا..الفكرة الرئيسية للكتاب هي انك عندما تفكر بشيء تريد الحصول عليه في مختلف المجالات ما عليك سوى إقناع عقلك الباطن بذلك عبر تغذيته بالافكار الايجابية وهو سيتكفل بالأمر وسيحقق لك كل ما تريد..
The power of positive affirmations and optimal thinking, and how it can work wonders in practical life where one might find themselves going through hard times on more occasions than once.🌼The books present various examples of people from different walks of life, who have tapped into the power of the subconscious and found themselves a better life, some who have even cured themselves of diseases.True, if one puts their heart and soul in a task and overcome a mental block wherein one can see beyond the fear and focus on just reaching the goal, victory is sure to come.🌼The writing is easy to read but the examples seemed redundant and sometimes outright unsubstantiated.I am all for the power of the mind but propagating an idea that a disease can be cured just by constantly thinking about a healthy life over and over again, seems a bit outlandish.
I'm really not sure I'm going to finish this.
So far it's gearing up to be 300-odd pages of, as someone else here has pointed out, unsubstantiated "scientific" theories and anecdotal "evidence".
I believe in the power of the mind, NO question whatsoever.
But sometimes I think new-age types are overcomplicating the business.
What business?
The business of THINKING.
To tell the truth, I've been into this power-of-the-mind theory for at least five or six years, seeing and hearing and reading it from quite a number of different angles.
إن العالم الداخلي يخلق العالم الخارجي والعقل الواعي هو بمثابة حارس البوابهوظيفته الرئيسيه :حماية عقل
كتاب رائع مؤثر يدعو القارئ للنظر في اعماقه ...الكثير تغير منذ قرأت الكتاب ...يحتاج من يقرأ الكتاب إلى أن يكون عقله متفتحا متقبلا الأفكار التي يحتويها الكتاب ...لان البعض قد يرى فكرة "العقل الباطن وقواه" فكرة خيالية أو خرافات ..إن تمت قراءة الكتاب ورميه بعدها دون تطبيق فلن يكون لقرائته معنى !حتى وإن لم تغير قوة العقل الباطن من الواقع فهي تغير من نظرتنا تجاه الأمور .. وهو الأمر المهم !!ما لم أحببه في هذا الكتاب هو التكرار في بعض المواضع !!
Great book.I think everyone should read it once in his/her life.It would enables one to your thoughts,thinking, intellects and wisdom.The things you do on your life, as well as easy to figure it out the consequences of your actions and thoughts throughout life.Thanks Paula, I got this books in your shelf.
