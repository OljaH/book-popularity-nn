Our 17 year old heroine finds herself in midst of a medieval battle after traveling back in time and what does she do??
She falls crazy in LUST with the first guy she sets eyes on.
"I was in the middle of a real battle.
I glanced left and saw that one wasn't battling any longer; instead he stared at me as if I were a female Lazarus.
He was the most handsome guy I'd ever seen, with a model's physique and a face to match...a serious hottie!!" I mean WTF????
OMG..HE IS SUCH A HOTTIE!!
SUCKED..BIG TIME!!
For those who like a visual ~ Marcello http://irresistiblereads.blogspot.com...My Favourite Quote: We froze.
I am not usually a fan of anything that slightly resembles historical fiction and well this is time travel back to Fourteenth-Century Italy.
But I love everything about this book the setting, the characters, the history, the romance.
The secondary character are just as strong and entertaining and I admit it is hard to pick a favourite.
Gabi is a compelling character.
Gabi and Marcello has chemistry from page one.
Do not miss out on this awesome new series.
Upon entering the 13th century, Gabriella finds she is alone in this tomb, not sure where her sister Evangelia is.
Gabriella does her best to not fall for Marcello, due to an alliance needed by the betrothel of Lady Rossi and Marcello the future Lord of Castello Forelli.
Throughout the story you will find yourself at the edge of your seat and cheering on Gabriella as she deals with the longing to find her sister, the fight to not fall for the "knight in shining armor", a devious Lady Rossi, and a battle of inner strength.
His gentle teasing and quirky comments in the face of danger endeared me to this man who was so devoted to Marcello, and in turn, Gabi and Lia. While this book is published as YA fiction, I believe adults would find Gabi and Lia's adventures to be stirring and extremely satisfying.
Lisa has written a true winner with this book, and, I am confident to presume, with the next two in the series.
The perilous adventures that Gabi faces will leave you breathlessly clinging to each word as you read through the pages.
However, despite the honorable setting, I finished this book learning nothing new about medieval Italy that I didnâ€™t know before, and believe me, I donâ€™t know much.
I think by now you already know that this book is a romance, the love between Gabi and Marcello can hardly be called love, and ultimately the love story took away from what could have been an amazing historic story.
Ultimately, Waterfall is not a book I can recommend to anyone but younger readers who are just beginning to venture into YA fiction.
The time-travel twist is unrealistic, the historic setting is non-existent, the characters are un-likeable, and the romance is not truly love.
Gabi and Lia Betarrini get to spend their summer vacation in beautful Italy...Too bad it's on a hot and dusty archeological site, among the rubble of the medieval castles in rural Tuscany. Bored beyond belief, the Betarrini sisters go exploring on the site into an acient tomb. Where Gabi finds handprints inside. So when Gabi and her sister lay their hands atop of the prints. Gabi finds herself in fourteenth-century Italy., in the mist of a fierce battle of knights of two opposing forces. Oh! pl

I'm telling you, I almost fell in love with the dude myself!Plus, the action sequences book are amazing!
Bergrens descriptive writing makes you feel like your there yourself!This book was definitely a high octane adventure that will leave you looking for the "buy" button on your favorite book website for the next one in the series.
Our heroine Gabi and her sister Lia are transported from our modern times to Medieval Italy.
Almost as if she was meant to live her life this way.Not only is Gabi a great character, but we also have a fantastic supporting cast in her sister Lia, and the yummy knights Luca and Marcello.
While we donâ€™t get a whole lot of page time with Lia, what we do get is great.
They have great chemistry together.While Iâ€™m a sucker for the romance, I was glad there was more to the story than just Marcello and Gabi.
I found some of the circumstances a liiiiiittle convenient (oh, you're sent back in time to medieval Italy? Good thing your pops taught you ancient Italian and sword fighting!) and would have liked a bit more of a culture shock (no plumbing! females with opinions!) but nevertheless thought this had likeable characters and an entertaining story. Think sweeping romantic adventure. Also: Italian boys. Always relevant to my interests.
This book was on my want to read shelf for a long time.
I honestly can't think of one part that I didn't love!(This is a review of the WHOLE series)This series is seriously worth reading.
In the long list of books that I have read, this series is definitely one of my favorites!
I love this series!Waterfall, Cascade, Torrent, Bourne, Tributary, and Deluge are the books in the series.
I think I would have to say that my favorite book in the series is--all of them.
But, I am super excited to read the first book in Lisa's new series, River of Time: California.
Some of the more believable plot elements are interesting, I just couldn't get past the bad writing, awful romance, stick-figure characters, and overall poor quality.
It's completely "Ooooh, he's hot!", not "I appreciate the way he did such-and-such; he is a man of character." There is nothing inherently wrong with feeling attracted to somebody for their looks, but it has to go deeper than that before you can claim that you're in love with somebody.This girl's thought life is truly pathetic, although it does improve somewhat over the course of the book.
What was happening to me?"Well, I say words like rife, and I declare that this book is rife with idiocy.
Speaking of characters, I think Gabi might have been the main reason I finished the novel.
So while Gabi's actions might seem pragmatic and perhaps just a smidgeon cool, they do invite the reader to accord more substance to her character than one normally would.I also found all the instances of girl power to be absolutely heady stuff.
This is pure entertainment and I am sure Ms. Bergren is taking artistic license with the reactions to girl heroines but I totally loved it.
Honestly, it's Gabi who's the stronger character here and it is her relationship with her sister that resounds the most.
April buddyread with my good friend Melissa **Just Really Loves Musicals**ðŸ˜Š----2.5 overallNot bad... the writing at times felt like a first attempt at fanfiction with more telling than showing. The characters in the "past" were interesting but Gabriella got on my nerves more often than not. She got a little better later on but I never fully connected to her.Despite my issues with it, it had some good parts and was compulsively readable at times but overall it was just "okay" for me.Would probably make an interesting mini series though.
If you are in the mood for some knight in shining armor meets YA then this is the series for you. Three words to describe it...smart, surprising, & sweet.Lisa Bergren participated in the YA scavenger hunt with me and I was so excited to get her book. Looking forward to picking up the next one! My favorite part is when the two sisters picked up weapons and started fighting alongside the men. Love to see a gutsy heroine!
But when Gabi jerks her hand away, Lia is nowhere to be find and Gabriella finds herself in the middle of a deadly battle between knights.
Thankfully it's the good guys who offer her shelter and safety, but Gabi's journey is only just beginning.Desperate and determined to find her sister, Gabriella has to try fit into the Forelli's way of life.
These knights are FAR from boys.The romance that develops between Marcello and Gabriella is fantastic and very believable.
She's so easy to relate to - determined, stubborn, not to mention insanely worried about her sister, but just like everyone, the girl makes mistakes and stupid decisions in the heat of the moment.
Fourteenth-century Italy during a battle between knights.Gabi finds herself having to adjust to this strange and dated way of living.
And worst of all, she doesn't know where her sister, Lia, is - in this century, her own time, or somewhere in between.I enjoyed 'Waterfall' much more than I had anticipated.
It was that good!I liked many of the characters in 'Waterfall' especially Gabi, Lia, Marcello, and Luca.
I recommend 'Waterfall' if you enjoy reading a good romance/suspenseful book with a fantasy twist!*Many thanks to David C.
DNF at 20%I ... JUST ... CAN'T*facepalm* What I liked uum.....wait ......ok there's .....1. This book was hilarious What I did not like 1. This book was not supposed to be hilarious2. Insta-love3. Cheesy writing4. Annoying narrator5. Constant swooning over boysBut what I hate the most is that the IDEA of this story was a good one and this could have been a good book ...Alas... "could have been" does not a good story makeI wanted to transport myself into this book .... not because I was enchanted
This book was hilarious
1. This book was not supposed to be hilarious2.
Annoying narrator5.
Constant swooning over boysBut what I hate the most is that the IDEA of this story was a good one and this could have been a good book ...Alas...
"could have been" does not a good story makeI wanted to transport myself into this book ....
not because I was enchanted by the world within, but because I wanted to punch the narrator in the FACE!!
She was so g* d* irritating!I was literally not 5% into this book before the eye rolling began!
The sixteen-year-old girl in me, loved LOVED LOVED this book!!!
Once I closed my adult eyes and opened those of my youth - eyes of wonderment, softness, invincibility, and unlimited belief in all that might be possible, whether or not probable - I was totally hooked!
Pure entertainment: excitement, adventure, suspense, romance, humor, heroics, and cleanly written.
Plus, a bit of subtle (non-preachy) inspiration too:"Free choice .
We all have freedom of choice.
Over and over again, minute by minute.
How will you live your life?
For love?"FIVE ***** Fun, Daring, Adventurous, and Inspiring - Young Adult Time Travel/Romance ***** STARS
As a mother of two teens and two preteens, I found Waterfall to be a fun but clean foray into the young adult genre for Lisa T. Bergren, who handled it with a grace and style all her own. Gabriella Betarrini yanked me out of my time and into a harrowing adventure as she battled knightsâ€”and love! I heartily enjoyed Gabriellaâ€™s travel back into time,and I heartily look forward to Cascade, River of Time #2!
Here is the opening introduction of our love interest as told by Gabi herself:  "I wanted to look away from him, but I couldn't.
I've never encountered such Italian hotness outside of Roma." I regard myself a varying mix of a tomboy and a girly-girl but let me tell you if I was to suddenly time-travel and see a battle in front of me, I will not pay attention to a handsome knight.
I liked that she was brave and she never let boring love interest "Marcello" tell her what to do but sometimes she could just be a bit too much!
I'm in love with this book!! Ah!
Read the review at iLive, iLaugh, iLove Books.Okay, I admit it.
Because I want to spread the word about how wonderful this book was, and tell all of you to read it.
I was really hoping everything turned out alright with them, because Marcello had long been betrothed to another and Lia, Gabi's sister, seemed to be clinging onto her old life more than this new one.I finished off this book in two sittings, but only because the first one was in the middle of the night and I had school the next day.
AKDNHFKTJTK, This book. THIS BOOK.So, first off, I am so so so glad I finally picked this book up! Omiword, it was so good! I loved the plot. It was so original and cool! The characters were awesome, Gabriella was a little annoying at some parts, but she was transported to a different time sooo...it's kind of understandable. aksrnjt, I need Cascade now, like, his minute.final verdict: clean (some kissing and a man was going to rape the main character(he doesn't))
Bergren did a good job portraying what a teenage girl from the 21st century would feel like after being transported to the 13th century.Some of the characters felt one-dimensional to me.
I did see some major character development in her as the story progressedâ€”thank goodness!
I just kept eye-rolling each time Gabi mentioned having a bathâ€”I donâ€™t know why that annoyed me so much but it did.Despite all of its faults, I had so much fun reading it.
(There will be a review up for that one sometime soon.) Iâ€™m going to give this book 5/5 stars.
Waterfall by Lisa Tawn Bergren Gabriella is bracing herself for a boring summer with her mom and sister in the secluded hills of Italy.
I was a little nervous to pick this up, because I heard it was a rather violent and more of a romance book.
At first I was annoyed that Gabriella could wield a sword and, guess what, her sister just happened to be a professional archer that could beat any guy that came along!
VIOLENCE This book is defiantly not for the faint of heart.
It was a bit more descriptive in the violence then I was used too.
Oh my gosh I suddenly realized what this reminds me of...How have I forgotten about this show?
Insta-lust, "modern" heroines imposing their views everywhere, convenient timing, cheesy writing, reverse harem...But I did enjoy it.
I enjoyed the time travel and the fact that the heroine knowing ancient Italian made sense and wasn't some wave of the magic time travel wand.
I enjoyed the characters and the fun, bizarrely timed plot.
I think I would have really liked this one if I read it in high school.
Overall a fun, fluffy read that maybe owes more to my mood at the time than any intrinsic value...but still.
Upon re-read, still a favorite
Yeah, all those reviews I read about how much they absolutely loved this book (and series) were right!
Hee Hee!I bought the first three books over the summer for my teenagers because of all the good things said about this series.
I loved watching Gabi help him.The battles- or mini little fights if not full on battles.
So fun to read about these knights and sword fights and bows and arrows.
Can't wait to read further in the series and learn more about these characters and the peril heading their way...and maybe a little romance heading their way too.
The main character loves her guy and sees the other two as good friends (which means I can have them then, right?)Ah, theyâ€™re physically attractive, but they also have super attractive personalities.
Seriously).Can I be so lucky?Great characters are wonderful and all, but you really do need a solid plot to back them up in order to be a 5 star book, right?
There are a few lines here and there where the main character wonders if she was sent back in time by God. The guys pray sometimes, but I donâ€™t think that would be out of place in any historical fiction book because thatâ€™s what they would likely do anyway in the 1300s.
Bergrenâ€™s prose is alright, but I personally found it rather immature and while Iâ€™m not part of the target age group for this novel, I canâ€™t help feeling my sixth grade-self would have groaned over the verbiage in this piece.
Bergren exploits this detail to add humor to the piece, but I couldnâ€™t help noticing that many fourteenth century scenes felt inauthentic.
The religious aspects werenâ€™t grating or preachy and I felt the incorporation of content appropriate to both the story and situational drama.
Iâ€™m not ruling out the rest of the series, but they definitely arenâ€™t at the top of my TBR list.
Well umm I like this book but I didn't love it, through the entire 300+ pages nothing really happened xD there were some points that seemingly drag on forever. I like the protagonist but I really hate her sister. THAT SIS GOD I wanna throw a punch on her darn face. But overall it was an interesting read but not captivating.
