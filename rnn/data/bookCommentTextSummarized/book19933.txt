I'm so glad there's more to the story.*******Lisa See's new book (which I've been waiting for since her website mentioned that it was coming out months ago) does what she does best - writing about the relationships of people and the ups and downs of life long relationships.
The tension slowly grows and grows throughout the book, until the end, where if you know Lisa See books, then you know what's coming.The reason that I gave this book three stars is because I felt that after the explosion of emotions, there was no resolution.
Lisa’s See’s new novel, Shanghai Girls, provides a rich experience for its readers – taking them from the splendor, highlife, glamour and poverty of 1937 Shanghai to the struggles of Chinese immigrants to survive a virtual internment on Angel Island, off the coast of San Francisco, to the almost impossible challenges of trying to build a life in Los Angeles Chinatown in the context of an America that does not want them and treats them cruelly.But despite its rich background, Shanghai Girls is ultimately the story of two sisters – Pearl and May – who desperately strive to help each other survive and at the same time replay in their minds and actions old rivalries, jealousies, and hurts.
This reminds me of one of her other books with the father!*****TRIGGER WARNING: GANG RAPE & BEATING OF AN OLD WOMAN AND HER TEENAGE DAUGHTER**********SPOILERS*****I liked the story, it did kind of remind me of Snow Flower And The Secret Fan in ways, but I liked that book a lot better.
Pearl and May were having a good life being models until one day their father said he gambled all of his money away (including the girls money he was keeping for them) and that he sold them to the man he owed, Old Man Louie.
The plot revolves around two sisters -their privilege life breaks down - 1930's Shanghai - Their father sell them to loveless marriages --The 'history' of horrific prejudice & immigration - coming to America was no joke.After I had read this ( not light and fluffy), a front page article in our local newspaper was a true story about an Asian man - he was in his 90's living in SF...
Even though this booksI fiction -there is a lot to learn about how it really was for Chinese immigrants -- during the mid 50's and it's not a pretty picture.
I went into it eager to learn about this point in history and this should have been a good book considering the premise of the story.
Still, the tragedies never felt that compelling, and even what should have outraged me when they arrived in the US, never had the impact they would have if better written.
The book evolved into a long narrative that just seemed to state dates and facts without any depth and then finally reveals what was the obvious plot point all along.
I would like to have read this story (a good one) written by a different author.
This was the third book I've read by this author and I'm still confused as to my feelings for her writing.
The first book I read, Snow Flower and the Secret Fan, I loved.
It was an interesting enough story: two "modern" sisters escape the country into arranged marriages in the United States, but it lacked the interesting older cultural nuances that I so enjoy.
If you like to read about Chinese culture, skip this one and "Peony in Love" and go straight to Snow Flower and the Secret Fan.
I really disliked this book and I'm extra disappoined about it because I loved Snow Flower and the Secret Fan so much!It starts out OK with the depiction of Shanghai but never did anything to make me feel a connection to the characters.
the last few pages make me wonder if she's fine but grouchy Pearl made me hate her!)Most of the book is just a boring list of things that happened.
He had no purpose at all except for the stupid model boats at the end.)The only exciting thing was when May FINALLY yelled at Pearl and told her to stop being such an in sufferable bitch!
All I can say is that Lisa See has another hit on her hands with this wonderful story of two sisters who emigrate from Shanghai to America around the time of the cultural revolution in China.
As usual, See has imbued this story with a wonderful cast of characters who surround the sisters and help tell the story of the bewilderment of the Chinese population after the 1937 invasion by Japan, the assimilation of the Chinese into American society in the 1940s and 50s, and finally, the mistrust, prejudice, and panic in the US towards Chinese Americans after the rise to power in China of Mao Tse Tung.
I was, therefore, very excited to hear that Lisa See is planning to continue the story of Pearl, May, and Joy in another book.
It covers Pearl and May's lives growing up in Shanghai, where they don't have to worry about much until their father basically sells them as wives for another man's sons in order to pay off his gambling debts.
Pearl raises a daughter and is torn between bringing her up in the traditional Chinese way or the more modern American style.
Lisa See researched this excellently, and I learned so much; from Chinese culture in general to the issues immigrants had to deal with (it really parallels the problems Mexicans and Latinos are facing in America right now), and then tying it in with several big historical events.
You might say that Amy Tan puts her characters through as much drama, but somehow I find Tan convincing where See is altogether not.
Which brings me to my second (and related) point: I just can't see any Chinese woman speaking as openly as Pearl does.
Her voice just doesn't feel Chinese to me, or at least not the way the voice of someone of her generation should feel, in my opinion.
What Chinese woman (or any woman) would speak this way?
A far better recent book about Chinese immigrant experience is Jen Sookfong Lee's "The End of East."
But she's married to a teenager with developmental delays, so it's not as if her life is a nice steaming cup of Chinese tea, but it's more like a steaming cup of endless misery broken only by acting and guilting her sister into doing what she wants her to do.Read it again, it's still good, but dammit, women why don't you TALK about these things instead of just yelling them at the end of the book?
8/25/15So this book is still good but do Chinese people really harp on the Zodiac like this because I'm still like, what is a horse like?
This is the second Lisa See novel that I've read, and both times when I've finished her books I've felt vaguely duped.
There's so much historical detail in here, much of it grim, that I feel like I must be reading something sweeping and important.
These dime-store drama elements, combined with the interesting and frequently heartbreaking historical aspects, make me wonder what exactly I'm reading.See puts you through a lot with her characters in Shanghai Girls -- even after the worst of their hardships are over, they can't seem to catch a break.
We'll see what the book club thinks.
I do not believe in love but I know for sure that I would do anything for her in a heartbeat.Pearl Long resembles my sentiments or for that matter myself .Born in the Year of the Dragon, she is strong, indomitable and vulnerable yet to find her true self.
Oblivious of her parent’s love, she longs for the attention that presumably is showered on her younger sibling May.May Long born in the Year of the Sheep, is coquettish, loquacious and a stark opposite of Pearl.
Ένα καλογραμμένο ιστορικό μυθιστόρημα, για ένα θέμα που για να πω την αλήθεια δεν είχα ξαναδιαβάσει.
Τις δυσκολίες που βίωσαν οι κινέζοι από τον πόλεμο, την προσφυγιά κ.α.
Ήταν ωραία γραμμένο, με ρεαλιστική πένα.
Αυτό όμως που δεν μου άρεσε ήταν οι ήρωες, δεν μπόρεσα να συνδεθώ μαζί τους, δεν μου το επέτρεψε η ίδια η αφήγηση που δεν ήταν αρκετά συναισθηματική -αν και γραμμένη στο πρώτο προσωπο- αλλά ίσως και οι προσωπικότητες που τους έδωσε, ίσως πάλι να φταίει η πολιτισμική διαφορά που με έκανε πολλές φορές να μην μπορώ να κατανοήσω τις πράξεις τους.
Πάντως ήταν ένα καλό βιβλίο, μου άρεσε.
I understand there is a follow-up novel to this one, and that is encouraging, because I felt this one ended with just too many untied ends.
I would like to get to the next installment before the details of this one have faded.In Shanghai Girls, Lisa See follows the lives of two sisters, Pearl and May. They are caught between the modern society of 1930s Shanghai and the traditional Chinese values that are still practiced by their parents and those of their generation.
The two girls are so intertwined, one’s fate depending on the other, and they share a sisterly bond that eclipses everything else.
I'm sorry to say that I thought this book was horrible.
As a huge fan of Snowflower and the Secret Fan and of the beautiful characters, beautifully described scenery, tragedies, hardships, and the deep bonds between the characters within it, I went into this book hoping for something of the same.
I felt the character development in this book was forced, I thought the story was all over the place, and there was never and deep understanding of the people within it.
There were a few random tragedies near the end, but none of it moved me.
Wow. Lisa See absolutely never, ever disappoints. She is an amazing storyteller, and ‘Shanghai Girls’ is an amazing story. I think I forgot to breathe during the last twenty pages.What a great movie this novel would make. I’d line up to see it.Recommendation: For a stunning, compelling and captivating read, put ‘Shanghai Girls’ at the top of your to-read list.2nd best-read of 2009
There's a phrase in Chinese, chi ku (eat bitterness), which Lisa See's Shanghai Girls exemplifies perfectly.
See writes in the first person through the voice of Pearl, a girl growing up in Shanghai during the volatile Sino-Japanese war.
Writing in the first person voice, but with an omniscient view of the environment makes Pearl's thoughts feel artificial and awkward.Another thing I found difficult to overcome in the novel were the inconsistent choice of Chinese words.
See does a decent job of illuminating the difficulties women and the Chinese in general faced during that time.At the end of Shanghai Girls, I literally sighed.
Good, solid read.
She's clever to have kept mentioning that the girls' English was 'perfect' because this helped with voice authenticity.
Otherwise, the narrative would have seemed too Americanized.
On the other hand, I felt let down by the last quarter of the book, and completely nonplussed by the ending.
It all felt rushed, as if she was running to the end, and not entirely believable.
In fact, I DIDNT's believe it!
It just doesn't seem real that in the 1950s a young Chinese American girl would just run away, disappear like that, supposedly off to Communist China.
Still, a very solid read.
However, through it all, even with her parents obviously favoritism of her sister May, she takes care of her, and protects her, being her jie jie.In the first few chapters we realize their Baba (father) is a gambling man who lost everything to debtors, even his own daughters in an arranged marriage.
May is continually selfish being the almost privileged girl in life and blaming her poor sister who has done nothing but sacrificed for her.If you either understand the culture, both traditionally and the earlier to mid turn of the 20th century or are just one of those people who don’t mind being surrounded in misery from first to last page, then I have never read a better book for you.
We also learn what it took to a Chinese to get into the US and the discrimination they suffer by misconceptions, their fear, their effort to fit in a country that was not their own and most of the time how much they missed their country, their culture and relatives they had to left behind in order to survive.In order to understand the lives of others, this type of books are so important because even thought the characters are fictional there is history behind them and with that reality.I honestly think that Lisa See made a fantastic research with the story that needs to be better appreciated.Setting: Shanghai, Los Angeles
Her writing is so easy that it is not difficult to immerse myself in her stories of a culture foreign to me.
We follow their struggles to leave their country, immigrate to America and enter into a land and social standing that is so foreign to them.
I was a bit saddened to learn how difficult the US made it for these people to immigrate, and what second hand citizens they became...often living in fear.
The story dragged for me a bit about midway through but pulled me back toward the end.

A saga with well-developed characters and a strong sense of place, set In pre-world war II Shanghai.
Sisters, May and Pearl, work as beautiful girl calendar models.
They live comfortably until their father gambles away the family possessions to a Chinese American mob-like business man.
To repay his debt, he "sells" his daughters into arranged marriages with the business man's sons.
As China is invaded, Pearl and May flee for the dangerous journey to America.
They encounter brutality that a few times made it difficult to keep reading.
Overall this is a satisfying read, with what I found to be an abrupt, unsatisfying ending.
I have really mixed feelings about this book, it's almost like the book is horrible and beautiful at the same time.
The book is told from the perspective of the oldest of two beautiful Chinese sisters growing up in Shanghai during the 1930's.
That said I had a hard time putting this book down.
There are also some very beautiful passages as the sisters come to appreciate their own mother and learn how even sisters can have incredibly different perceptions about the same events and people.
I give the book three stars because the ending left me hanging.
I loved Peony in Love and got both Shanghai Girls and Snow Flower and the Secret Fan to take on a recent trip.
As usual, See gripped me from the start with Shanghai Girls, immersing me in a whole new world and surprising me with every sentence.
But about 3/4 through the book - and, as it turns out Snow Flower as well - she began to heap so many tragedies on her main characters that I sort of numbed out.
See creates such memorable and nuanced characters that we care about them by that point in the book and will keenly feel anything they go through.
Interesting from a historical perspective (China and US during WWII) but the story was too plodding for me to finish. Though the sisters had unique characterization, I couldn't feel an emotional connection to either.
Shanghai Girls#1 by Lisa LeeShanghai Girls is a Chinese American Odyssey of two sisters.
The book educates the reader about Chinese Exclusion Act throughout the story.
An important turning point in the lives of the sisters is 1949, when the Communists take over China, all Chinese are under suspicion in the United States.
Books like Shanghai Girls awaken the reader to mistakes made in the past and encourages to be thankful for present.
The book concludes with the idea that perception is thought to be reality and keeps us in a comfortable in present, but a little introspection into history can change everything.
Sad and beautiful! I need the second book now to see how everything turns out!
I love works of well-crafted historical fiction and a woman in Barnes & Noble said that I might enjoy the novel if I liked Memoirs of a Geisha (one of my absolute favorites).
There are plenty of authenticating details and the novel touches upon interesting aspects of Chinese/American history that I feel not many would know much about otherwise.
Her characters often felt more like hypothetical, crafted figures than real people.
Throughout a good portion of the novel, I was driven to finish reading the novel because of my agitation rather than feelings of suspense or emotional connections to the characters.Pearl herself, even after the novel's close, remains a mystery to me.
