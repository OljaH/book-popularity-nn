Like how nobody goes crazy when a bird learns how to read and write "catastrophe." Or like when Louis spends the night at the Ritz, he goes to take a shower and he draws the curtain.
HE DRAWS THE CURTAIN.
I'm like, LOUIS, YOU ARE A SWAN.
HOW DO YOU EVEN KNOW ABOUT CURTAIN-DRAWING.
How many of you would mutilate your own feet so that you would play an instrument?
Well, hopefully none, because humans don't use their feet to play anything except maybe footsie or foot bongo.
I have no idea how I managed to not read this as a kid. It's way more fun than Stuart Little, not nearly as sad/good as Charlotte's Web, but almost as funny. Maybe funnier, actually. Just like in Charlotte's Web, E.B. ends the book with a calm, beautiful, somewhat embarrassing paragraph that I want to fall asleep under, and this time I printed it off and taped it to my wall so that I actually can. You can too:http://tymelgren.com/trumpet%20of%20t...
One of my favorites.
I'm re-reading this with my kid.
I loved this book when I read it as a child.
An all time childhood favorite.
I really enjoy it now, especially all the literary and biblical references I didn't get when I was Nicco's age.
I love the over the top flowery sentiments of Louis' father.
It did seem much more exciting and dangerous when I was young, and I COMPLETELY missed the disturbing hipocrisy of Louis, the weak and defected cygnet among his siblings, agreeing to sell his own future weak offspring into zoo slavery to prevent his lady love from being enslaved in the zoo.
The incomparable classic children's author, E.B. White, wrote not only a delightful fantasy in Charlotte's Web but also in this book, The Trumpet of the Swan.
Yet through ingenuity and a touch of fantasy he finds ways to live a full life as well as woo the beautiful swan he falls in love with as he gets older.
This book would be a wonderful introduction to a discussion of celebrating differences and learning ways to cope with disabilities whether they be small or large.
A wonderful classic children's book that I somehow missed as a child and an elementary teacher.
My reasoning would likely have been "It's no Charlotte's Web", one of my all-time favorite children's stories.
(But this book is not nearly as heartbreaking as Charlotte's Web either.)Children reading this book will learn all about swans, that women are possessions, the word 'crepuscular', that all musicians are poor, and that math is stupid.Quick read for an adult reader, took me less than two hours.
I'll take it back to another mailbox so hopefully an actual child who hasn't read it can get some joy out of it.

I'm not sure how I escaped reading this as a child but I'm certain that I didn't because the story is unique and memorable.
Louis, a trumpeter swan born without a voice, employs determination and smarts to remedy this obstacle and win the heart of his love, all the while embarking on adventures and working to right wrongs along the way.
My 8 year old daughter said "this book teaches children to be a rightful citizen and an honest and kind friend." What could be better than that?
A story with morals, comedy and a nature lesson.
I loved this book growing up and was a little afraid to re-read it for fear that the memory would not live up to the reality. But I needn't have worried....this is such a delightful fun story! Who could not fall in love with Louis the swan as he searches for a way to communicate since he was born without a voice. I listened to the audiobook narrated by the author. I loved every minute of it - it felt like grandpa telling me a story. A 5 star experience!!!
I've loved this book ever since I was a little kid; Trumpet of the Swan, from the author who brought Charlotte's Web and Staurt Little to the world, is a classic about self-esteem, love and acceptance, with an almost fairy tale quality to it.

So the swan named Louis, he went around with a slate because he didn't have any voice.
And he tried so hard and but he couldn't talk.
He got a trumpet and a slate, a gold medal for saving someone's life, and guess what?
He got a money bag because his father stole the trumpet.
My favorite part is when he broke in the door and then the owner of the store came after him and he got the trumpet and he went away.
I know that is stealing but they are swans.
How do swans get money?
Louis knows how.
I thought it was very good. And I also thought that Louie was very funny! I liked how the story was about swans, because swans are very unusual animals to write about.👍
A story about overcoming adversity.
Your father knows to make speeches and eventually steals a trumpet for you.
This is a zany story of a swan who can talk and play the trumpet.I enjoyed the story and this was 75 pages too long.
The book should have ended long before it did.
The last scene with the father was so unnecessary and that part dragged.
There is something powerful about overcoming a handicap.
He put his energy into learning to overcome obstacles in his way to his goal.
It's also simply a fun story.
This was far better than Stuart Little in the fact it had an actually ending, but it wasn't as good as Charlotte's Web I thought. I really liked the parts with Boston and the Swan Boats (if you haven't been and need something family friendly to do...). Having ducks, I found this amusing too. Okay my ducks aren't swans, but maybe I can give them all trumpets and start a band.
Best first chapter of a book ever written.
This is a perennial favourite of mine.I've read this several times now.
It's a story of good people, animals mostly with good human qualities and both Sam and Louis are good role models, they type of person we all want to be like someday.
A lovely story, sure to be enjoyed by animal lovers.One of my goals in reading books from this random shelf is to move books out of the house that are not going to be part of my permanent collection, but this one is a keeper.
The original illustrations don't seem to be available in any currently available new editions.
The Trumpet of the Swan is an absolutely fabulous book.
Louis, a swan, was born without a voice.
Remember that the world is full of youngsters who have some sort of handicap that they must overcome.
The world is full of talkers, but it is rare to find anyone who listens.
And I assure you that you can pick up more information when you are listening than when you are talking."This is the story of how Louis finds his voice.
(overcoming hardship, finding what you really want to do in life, taking care of nature, accepting others, kindness) I recommend reading this book to your kids.
I read this for the 2016 YA/MG Book Battle.This was cute, but ultimately too self-conscious to appeal to me. I did love it when Louis, the swan who’s been accumulating possessions that hang around his neck, starts listing them off and then says “I’m beginning to look like a hippie.” But there’s no real tension in this book, Louis’s path is unhindered by serious challenges, and he even gets the girl swan of his dreams through an unrealistic weather contrivance. It’s all a little too easy. What worked for me in Stuart Little and Charlotte's Web just didn't happen here.
Somehow I missed this one growing up! Sadly, I think this is one of those times where that made a difference. I wasn't as willing to go with the implausible parts of a story that seems set in the real world. I wasn't sure I wanted to root for Louis and Serena. I am not sure I buy their love story!And I didn't like (view spoiler)[Louis promising to give the zoo some of his and Serena's cygnets. So he and Serena get to be free, but not all of their kids? That sucks. (hide spoiler)].
From my memory, this books just comes off as my favorite E.B White book, but now that I think about that, I think I'll have to ponder on that a little bit longer. This book was great, all I have to say. His works are classics for a reason.
Read at school to students.. Finished April 3rd..
Some of the images were so vivid to fifth grade me, that they remained the same despite the 20 years that have passed: the cob flying into the music store and Louis asking Sam to slit his webbed feet were two that particularly stood the test of time.
I think that's a testament to E.B. White's writing ability -- he captured my attention and imagination at age ten and never let go.The Trumpet of the Swan tells the story of a mute Trumpter Swan named Louis.
Bianca says it's a tie between Trumpet of the Swan and Charlotte's Web for her favorite book.
She "recommended" it to me after her third reading.
This is a charming, remarkable little book about a mute swan who overcomes his difficulties and perseveres.
I think it should be mandatory reading for all kids, along with Charlotte's Web of course.
As I was reading, I totally got why this is a favorite of Bianca's--with the music, the humor, the sweetness.
I recommend it to children and adults alike.Oh, and can I just mention how much I LOVED the illustrations in this version.
Absolutely adorable! Why did I never read this book as a kid? Seriously, it was so cute! What could be better than a Trumpeter swan who has a speech impediment and overcomes it by learning to read, write and, you guessed it, play the trumpet?? This is a coming-of-age story about a young swan--and it is just so much fun! The characters are fun, Louis is a treat, Louis' dad is hilarious, my kids LOVED listening to the story and couldn't wait until reading time!
This was such a beautiful story about love, friendship, justice, and bravery.And I think what it was really successful in doing was showing the reader the point of view of these swans, these animals. We see what it'd be like to be them and to live in captivity, to have our wings clipped - and us (as in humans) became the enemy.I think that's amazing.
This was a silly story, but a sweet and rather touching one as well. It's cute, but the family feels here are really strong. In most stories, a character like the swan dad would just be annoying and overblown, but here he's just a good person (animal) who wants to help his family, even if he is annoying as hell. Seriously, I did not think this story would move me this much.
I had somehow never heard of this book! It was really cute, and while it wasn't as poignant as Charlotte's Web, it still had great messages and humor. Plus, who can resist a trumpter swan that plays Gershwin?
This book used to mesmerize me as a child, and I would read it at least once a year for most of my childhood. I will definitely buy this book someday, in order to either read it to my own children, or have them read it on their own. So charming, and such a heartwarming story.
I liked this book immensely as a child, but 3 stars because swans are assholes and children should learn this from a very early age. Swans are not our friends. They are jerks.
