This was a sweet GLH. It was perfect for reading some every night, which was what I was doing. I enjoyed the plot, and surprising lack of romance. 'Watching' the family grow closer together and closer to God was really sweet.
Hill, Grace Livingston
Nothing special for a GLH.
Seemed more Christian Romance-ish than usual, maybe because there were more evangelical buzz words?
The romance certainly wasn't the focus, so it's not that.
Perfectly readable, but kind of forgettable too; no stand-out characters or situations for me.
This despite the fact that there's a kidnapping and daring escapes and a girl trapped in a house with robbers and all manner of excitement, plot wise.
Maybe I was interrupted too often while reading it, I dunno, but while it held my attention well enough when I had time for it, I never felt much urgency to get back to it when I was busy.
