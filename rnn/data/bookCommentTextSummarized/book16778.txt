This is a Weasley appreciation post.
This one is definitely my favourite of the 3 i've read so far.. :)(Watch my review here): https://youtu.be/gFZ99uPXiIU
“Don't let the muggles get you down.” Yup yup yup I love this book.
I wish so much that that scene had been in the movie.I was so into reading this book that I failed to take notes, so I don't have many specifics to add except that I love how Crookshanks was basically Sirius's secret agent spy cat friend and I LOVE THAT.Also, this book demonstrated some very REAL aspects of school.
when he realized that Harry fell off his broom during the Quidditch game and Hufflepuff won he called for a rematch, which says a lot about him, and it just makes what happens in the next book that much worse.But of course, all of the Marauders stuff made my inner fangirl go nuts because it has to be my favorite Harry Potter storyline.
Confession time: I didn't like Remus or Sirius.*Khanh ducks as rotten fruit and eggs are thrown her way*OK, OK, I'M SORRY!
I'm talking about the future deaths where Harry lost people he actually remembered, and respected, and loved.
That's what I mean when I say that this is the last book in which Harry is a child, because as hard as his life was until now, he still had his innocence.Children believe that their heroes are unerring.
I think for me, it took maturity and the experience of loss and frustration, well, life itself, in order to appreciate the hardship that Harry and Sirius and Remus went through.
I'm beginning to wonder if there will ever be a Defence Against The Dark Arts teacher who is just a teacher.
I have so much more love for this one re-reading it as an adult. Five stars of course.
It's a rainy Sunday. It's colder than it should be this time of the year, so I'm drinking a delicious cup of coffee and I'm browsing my Goodreads shelves only to realise that I haven't written a Harry Potter review. Not a single one. So, I decided to start with the first Harry Potter book I ever read, the one that took me to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, and made me believe that magic is something tangible.  “I solemnly swear that I am up to no good.”   I was 16 years old, and I ha

My teacher told me that the best way to delve into a foreign language and familiarize with it is to read books written in it, so she gave me the third instalment of Harry Potter.
(A) 85% | ExtraordinaryNotes: Separating itself from its forebears, it’s a story of greater complexity, darker tones, and a vastly expanded mythology.
ENGLISH (Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban) / ITALIANO«Harry Potter was a highly unusual boy in many ways.For one thing, he hated the summer holidays more than any other time of year.
I'm reading the saga of Harry Potter to my daughter, when in the evening she goes to bed, and in this "Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban" a little tragedy happened.
Non so se nell'immediato futuro continuerò a leggere a mia figlia la saga di Harry Potter, o se aspetterò che cresca abbastanza da essere in grado di leggerseli da sola per evitare adesso di turbarla.
Still five stars. Love this so much. Can't review. Couldn't even take notes. Watched the movie immediately after finishing. Need next book. Wish I lived in this world. Damn you, Rowling. Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Pinterest
I'm just going to add a few gifs and pictures from my book.
Harry Potter books will always be 5 star no matter how many times they are read.
Black in this book and I never looked back.I'm going to add some pictures from my book, although now, I wish I would have added more but it is what it is.
maybe later I love these big illustrated coffee table editions of the books.
It makes re-reading them an extremely fun experience.
I just wish she would put them all out at once.
Happy Reading!

JUST GOT MY COPY HECK YES I'll definitely start this soon.
“Happiness can be found, even in the darkest of times, if one only remembers to turn on the light.”When I finished Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban for the first time, it immediately became my next favourite book.
Rowling outdid herself, and wrote something even bigger and better than before.
Compared to the other books there's not a single scene that makes me uncomfortable, that I'd prefer to skip rather than experience it again.
I particularly admire Hermione, our favourite genius witch.
Hermione seriously managed her mischief.Find more of my books on Instagram
He knew the rat wasn't what it was pretending to be, but all of his attempts to alert the humans to this fact had failed.
Its scent was like nothing Crookshanks had ever smelled, and for all his time living in a magical pet shop, he'd smelled a lot.
And even Crookshanks knew what they said about cats and curiosity.
Crookshanks circled the bed a few times.
Of all the things he'd expected from this rat, this wasn't it.
He jumped off the bed and shimmied under the wardrobe, where he could see but not be seen.The human looked around, breathing heavily.
Loved it, duh. It's my favorite in the series and I'm not sure I got anything NEW out of this reread except some reminders on what a dick Snape is + how Crookshanks was MVP in getting the passwords to Sirius Black.
I don't know what to say other than I love this book. I loved learning more about Harry's parents. I loved Harry, Ron, Hermione, Fred, George, and everyone else. I loved the storyline and how every single seemingly pointless detail somehow ended up meaning something to the bigger story and how I was left completely in shock. I loved the introduction of divination and I loved Sirius. I love love love this series. Superb storytelling. I AM IN LOVE😍
Of-course, this book was EPIC! =D Its Harry Potter now. It has to be epic! *Rolling eyes but smiling widely* xD
This is my favourite book in the Harry Potter series!
She could have fell into a trap and continuously wrote books like the first two, but instead she moved her story forward and let it grow.
The entire story felt less comic and less feel-good, for the first time it seemed like Harry Potter could actually die if he didn’t find his courage and repel them with his power.
He owed much to Lupin here, a character who becomes slightly overlooked as the series progresses, but a hugely pivotal one in the development of Harry.
That was awesome. I really should have read this about ten years ago when all the cool kids did. I'm enjoying this series so much and it's great I have no idea what happens next. No spoilers, please! :) x
Yes, yes, I know...this is akin to reader sacrilege.But I just had no interest in these books when they came out.
I was too busy reading about men in kilts fucking the milkmaid.
And since my friend's 9 year old demanded that I read his copy, I now have the paperback in my possession.I also never saw any of the movies when they came out and I have been watching them now only once I polish of the corresponding book.
عندما بدأت هذا الجزء كنت متخوفا من أن اجد أحداث مشابهة للجزئين السابقين..ولكني كنت مخطئاكلب اسود غري
Prisoner of Azkaban is my favorite of the series so far which is actually a surprise since Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban was my least favorite movie growing up.But reading and watching the movie truly is a different experience.
I especially loved the fact that we actually got to learn about Remus Lupin and his backstory as a werewolf.
I never would've learned any of this if I never decided to pick up these books.This series just gets better and better, and darker and darker.
Now next up is Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, which is my favorite movie of the series growing up!
Harry Potter for me is like warm apple pie and vanilla ice cream.
The theme I can take out of this particular book especially after reading it all these times is hope.
Harry largely naive for most of the first three books, meets Sirius for the first time and his world changes.
This is usually the time of year when I reread the septology, and I am looking forward to feeling magical again as though it's my first time reading these books.
Like that slice of warm apple pie, I am comforted knowing that for a few hours I can enter Harry's world.
I guess you can tell from my rating that this wasn't my all-time favorite HP installment, but I still thoroughly enjoyed it.
I remember thinking that the movie was about a 3/5 star rating for me when I first saw it, but now that I've experienced the novel version, I can see how the ending in the book is so much more detailed and excellent than how they chose to portray the ending in the movie.
"I solemnly swear that I am up to no good!" Another fun read and another step closer to making my way through the series for the first time.
I'm really interested to get to The Goblet Of Fire, as it's my favorite movie in the series!
Up until now I’ve definitely enjoyed the books, but this had a darker side to the story which I really really enjoyed.
I loved the fact that we got SO much more in this book.
We find out more about James Potter along with; Lupin, Serius and Peter while at the school and the Marauder’s Map GIRL I LOVE IT.We get to see lots of magical aspects in this book, and learning about the Patronous, then well see Harry, Ron and Hermione grow as characters.
This is probably a very unpopular opinion, but I always disliked the 3rd movie the most and it's probably going to be the same for the books.I do love all the new characters that were introduced but I really despise this goddamn time turner shit. It doesn't make any sense! It's full of goddamn plot holes. Plus: I'm not a big fan of quidditch and there was a lot of it in this one... Qudditch bores me a lot tbh.
I cried and laughed and yelled SHIT when all of the action went down.I'm such a peasant for judging this series before I had read it.
I did not know, Mother Rowling.
Forgive my sin, and all the times when I said, "I don't think Harry Potter is really my thing".
Please.This book was incredible and this series is a classic more than any Dickens or Middle Earth or Narnia shit has any right to be.
How could I have been so blind?Forgive me, because this book changed the game.
Considered armed and dangerous- approach with caution...and Nerds- she likes Nerds.Now back to our regularly scheduled review....I don't listen to a lot of audio-books (I prefer to read) but I was kind of falling behind in my reading commitments...and I had put Ms. Stepheny off again and again for this buddy-read soooooo many times- I couldn't do it again to her (she pouts..and she gets all mopey and it is JUST heartbreaking).
I am so happy I listened to this one- Stephen Fry was just perfect.
Perfect!..and HARRY POTTER AND THE PRISONER OF AZKABAN was just the thing to put me in the Christmas Spirit.
اما او سرانجام می‌فهمد که سیریوس بلک، کسی بوده که پدر و مادرش را به ولدمورت فروخته؛ و اکنون از زندان فرار کرده، و حالا دنبال اوست و به همین دلیل وزارت برای او حکم اخراج نمی‌فرستد، تا بتواند در مدرسه هاگوارتز در امان باشد.
اما در پایان مشخص می‌شود که سیریوس بلک پدر خوانده ی اوست، و دوست صمیمی پدرش بوده و کسی که پدرش را به ولدمورت لو داده: پیتر پتی‌گرو بوده؛ که خود را به شکل موشی درآورده بوده؛ که همان موش از قضا موش خانگی رون ویزلی، بهترین دوست هری بوده‌ است.
