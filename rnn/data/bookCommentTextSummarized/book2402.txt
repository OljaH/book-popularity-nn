”’What a lot of enemies you must make, Linnet.’‘Enemies?’ Linnet looked surprised.Joanna nodded and helped herself to a cigarette.‘Enemies, my sweet. You’re so devastatingly efficient. And you’re so frightfully good at doing the right thing.’Linnet laughed.‘Why, I haven’t got an enemy in the world!’” Linnet Doyle is on her honeymoon in Egypt with the husband she recently stole from one of her best friends. Not only is Linnet filthy rich, but also gorgeous, sophisticated, and charming. Some might
Is it any great surprise that Linnet ends up murdered on the boat on the Nile, and Jacqueline is the number one suspect?
So when Poirot mentions the scarlet kimono, which makes an appearance in the new film, I felt a wave of nostalgia for a movie I had just watched a few weeks ago.
Interesting enough and why I decided to read Death on the Nile as my next Poirot, they tease us with mentioning it at the end of Murder on the Orient Express, intimating that if this movie does well, the next one will be Death on the Nile.
As in many of Poirot's cases, this mystery features a young heiress, multiple motives for murder, and criminals traveling under assumed names.
Famous detective Hercule Poirot happens to be enjoying a holiday on the same Nile cruise.
All goes smoothly until late one night Linnet Doyle nee Ridgeway is murdered in her cruise cabin.
Like the equally famous Poirot case Murder on the Orient Express, Death on the Nile features a leisurely voyage with a large cast of characters, all with intriguing pasts.
Always a pleasure to read an Agatha Christie case, I rare Death on the Nile 4 solid stars.
Book Review  4+ out of 5 stars for Death on the Nile, a Hercule Poirot mystery published in 1937 by Agatha Christie. This is one of Christie's better mysteries, not because of the complexity in the mystery but due to the characters she creates. No one is who they appear to be on this ship, and they are all trapped together. It's nearly 100 years ago, so how could anyone get on or off the boat without the Captain or the rest of the staff in the know? (No, I'm not giving away a spoiler). Poirot
Book Review
4+ out of 5 stars for Death on the Nile, a Hercule Poirot mystery published in 1937 by Agatha Christie.
Poirot is on vacation this time, and he is trying not to work.
People using different names, a killer trapped with little escape...
Poirot is at his best, which is usually his most annoying, of times.
And the film adaption does a great job at capturing the different personalities.
here's the scoop: I read A LOT.
I write A LOT.
And now I blog A LOT.
Many thanks to their original creators.[polldaddy poll=9729544][polldaddy poll=9719251]
Hopefully I am not committing any heretical thoughtcrime here, but am I the only one who thinks Hercule Poirot comes across as a bit of a doucheapotamus . Between the accent, the arrogance and the jabbing his butt into everyone’s business, he reminded of a cross between nosey neighbor Gladys Kravitz and everyone's favorite rapist, Pepe Le Pew.  Now before you get the cheese grater and the lemon juice out for me, let me say that this is my first Agatha Christie novel and my first experience with
Hopefully I am not committing any heretical thoughtcrime here, but am I the only one who thinks Hercule Poirot comes across as a bit of a doucheapotamus .
Still, I enjoyed the book and plan to read more of Christie's mysteries.
I loved the characters (except for the aforementioned Toolbag Macdouchenator) and thought the mystery was terrific.
I did suspect the final answer to the “whoduntheshit” well before the first murder had occurred, but that was just a lucky guess on my part and I don’t think it indicates that the mystery was flawed.
Another vacation in an exotic locale, another murder to be solved by Agatha Christie's detective, Hercule Poirot.
I enjoyed Christie's Death on the Nile.
I liked how Christie used the locale and focused on a smaller set of characters (at least a smaller set than in Murder on the Orient Express) to get at a deeper familiarity of our suspects.
Death on the Nile is a quick read and very accessible.
I doubt I'll come away being overwhelmed with how Christie uses language or her insight into psychology, but I liked this one.
A friend told me who the murderer was, so I was not surprized when the killer was discovered.I never talked to this friend again...
I read this book, have watched the movie hundreds of times, but now I wanted to hear the audio.
The first BBC adaptation I listened to, I did not care for it.
It feels like I'm listening to a play or movie.....without seeing anything.The most fascinating part of the one for me is Egypt.
As a child reading this one, I dreamed of visiting Egypt.
This book has intrigue, jealousy, travel, mystery, murder, a cast of characters, ...all the classic formulas in a Christie book.
A great book for those wanting to try out a Christie book.
For audio lovers, a great adaptation worth listening to for a few short hours.
I remember the sublime subterfuge of the guilty party, but thought there were only two deaths in the book.
In fact there are five deaths and the book has a quite hectic pace.Hercule Poirot refers to previous cases once or twice.
In Murder of the Orient Express he absolved the guilty completely.
In Death on the Nile, he regrets bringing the murderer to justice, but carries out this task still.The boat on the Nile houses many other characters who serve to camouflage the murderers.
Investigation is carried out by Poirot and his temporary sidekick Colonel Race.

Hercule Poirot, himself on vacation…Of course, when Colonel Race (an old friend of Poirot’s) showed up, also a passenger on the S.S. Karnak, certain events began to follow.
The beautiful Linnet was dead; Poirot and Colonel Race had investigations to conduct.
It certainly didn’t seem to be the luxurious cruise each of the passengers thought they were getting when they embarked…Death on the Nile by Agatha Christie is another brilliant mystery by this author.
He dangles so many threads in front of the reader; offers many red herrings.
Then he ties all those threads in a neat little bow – the clever little detective has struck again!
جيده جدا .. افضل مافيها شخصياتها المختلفه و المكان الي حصلت فيه الجريمه ..توقعت من بدايه الجريمه القاتل 🙄
Normalmente me pasa esto con las novelas de esta autora, ya que sus personajes son un poco impertinentes y mentirosos.
La verdad es que esto lo veo un poco sencillo, ya que se van dando algunas pistas.- También tenía la teoría de que Jackie y Simon estaban compinchados para matar a Linnet y quedarse con todo su dinero.
A raíz de esto fue cuando empecé a pensar que jackie y Simon estaban compinchados para matar a Linnet.Yo flipé en colores cuando vi que tenía razón en todo lo que había pensado.
This is a really good one from Christie. It has all the ingredients of a great story. I wish they had done this plot as a film instead of the too-many-times filmed 'Murder on the Orient Express'.
Actual rating 4.5/5 stars.This is my second time reading this infamous Christie novel. I have also seen a stage adaptation twice. However, despite my familiarity with this plot I seemed to have forgotten much of the compelling complications and conspiracies, and the captivating confusions and collusions, involved in this fascinating murder mystery. I found just as much to intrigue me, as during my first reading many years ago, even as the murderer was known to me and the central mystery already solved.
Death on the Nile has to be one of my favourite books by Agatha Christie. I've read most of her books and I never get tiered of re-reading them :)There's something specially dark about this book and I happen to like it.As usual the characters are multi-dimensional and quite weird and scandalous lol. EVERYONE has a motive and an opportunity, anyone could've done it but I can never guess the right person with Agatha :)Very enjoyable and highly recommended.
أغاثا كريستي العبقريه كنت اتوقع القاتل منذ البداية ولكن الاحداث كانت شيقه جدا الاحداث غيرت مجري تفكيري وششكتني في توقعي للقاتل أكثر من مرة ترتيب الاحداث اكثر من رائع .. جريمة قتل بتفاصيل دقيقه لا يقدر علي رؤيتها سوي المحقق الرائع هيركيول بوارو وخلاياه الرمادية الصغيرهتأخذنا هذه المره في رحلة رائعه في وادي النيل وتحديدا في اسوان مع الكثير من السياح يجمعهم مركب واحد كبير واحداث كثيرة مذهلة وممتعه جدا
I am sure I read this in the past but its plot had faded away probably replaced in my mind shanty by the theme song to the New Zoo Review which for some reason I can't get out of my head.At any rate this book begins as many of Ms. Christie's do, setting the stage by introducing us the the victims and suspects.
Hercule Poirot.
Here we begin our locked room or cruise up the Nile.
Poirot did.Vocab:defalcations Defalcation is misappropriation of funds by a person trusted with its charge; also, the act of misappropriation, or an instance thereof.
4.5*“That is why most great love stories are tragedies.” Agatha Christie mentioned in her autobiography how she had only known four completely successful, happy, marriages, which sheds some light in the matter and the focus in this book.
Death on the Nile is one of her best known stories and with reason.
Usually, I forget pretty quickly who the murderer is and the reason behind the crime, and yet, a few are carved in my mind, proof of their power.
I wondered if this would curtail my enjoyment, but no, I loved watching what Christie was doing, setting the scenes, the players, the red herrings, while knowing exactly what was going on.

I can see why people don't appreciate the Nile much equally to other famous Christie's novels: The Oriental Express or And Then There We're None, still I love the way the story unfold itself.
The crime is also humanly touching, practical and realistic.
There's also the elements such as atmosphere, the journey to the Nile, and old-fashioned who-dun-it crime scene in the transitional place (boat, and reminding of the old day's the train express) which can be variously interpreted, for such, the place of the complexities of the mind and the journey to the dark exposure of the soul and human's true feelings.
When her friend Jaqueline de Belleforte asks Linnet to give her fiance, Simon Doyle, a job Linnet does.
The couple go on their honeymoon on a cruise on the Nile, and Jaqueline is also on board the steamer.
When Linnet is found dead in her cabin, Hercule Poirot, who is supposed to be on holiday during this cruise, investigates and finds that he has no shortage of suspects or motives as Linnet made plenty of enemies along the way.
Linnet Doyle, formerly Ridgeway, is on board the steamer that is cruising the Nile with her new husband Simon.
On board is also Jaqueline, Simon's ex-fiance and Linnet's former friend.
Re-read 01.09.2017 From 3 to 4 stars.The first book I read from Christie was  The Big Four  (1927), but starting from that was a huge mistake, because it's vastly different from the usual Poirots. Luckily, Death on the Nile was next in line, and it confirmed once and for all that my time wouldn't be misspent reading Christie, just like it wasn't misspent watching the television adaptations for a long time before I moved on to her books.The plot of Death on the Nile is the only one I can remember
Luckily, Death on the Nile was next in line, and it confirmed once and for all that my time wouldn't be misspent reading Christie, just like it wasn't misspent watching the television adaptations for a long time before I moved on to her books.The plot of Death on the Nile is the only one I can remember vividly, in part because the Agatha Christie's Poirot adaptation is one of my favorites, so I've seen it several times.
For a long time I've adored the tv movies because you could actually see the lovely costumes and the stories came to life.
A typical Poirot mystery.Rich heiress, impoverished friend, a couple of suitors, acquaintances with straightened circumstances.Heiress snatches her impoverished friend's fiance and they are off on a honeymoon cruise over the Nile. The outraged jilted lady friend, Poirot, a couple old ladies, a couple of young ladies, a few mysterious men - are put together in the cruise. What follows is a medley of intrigue, quarrel, theft, murder and mayhem. Was an enjoyable read.
“That is why most great love stories are tragedies.” ― Agatha Christie, Death on the NileDeath on the Nile is one of Christie’s most popular mysteries, also made into a popular movie with Peter Ustinov as the amusingly arrogant egg-head Belgian Poirot, who apparently never gets to take a real vaca, meeting murder in every boat and train on which he travels.
Simon doesn’t like it that ex-Jacqueline, a former RWW, but still fabulously beautiful, of course, and it just so happens, Linnet’s ex-best friend, also it just so happens is on the boat, and he and Linnet are way bothered by it.
Oh ma che bello questo libro.
Divertente e intrigante.
Come al solito la Agatha ha fatto centro.
Tanti personaggi che si intrecciano tra di loro.
Per poi arrivare alla soluzione finale.
E Poirot e le si battutine mi hanno proprio divertito.
Bello e si, c’ero arrivata, ma non sapevo come.
Anche se mi ha deviato molte volte, mettendo in dubbio tutto.
Alla fine il nostro detective ha spiegato bene tutto.
Ovvio e chissà perché non c’ho pensato.
Eppure gli indizi me li ha dati propri tutti.
Sotto l’ombrellone l’ho praticamente divorato.
È uno di quei libri che deve essere letto.
Bu kitapla birlikte 2017 Reading Challenge'ımı tamamlamış oldum, buna seviniyorum ama en çok da kitapta, katili erkenden tahmin edebildiğime seviniyorum :) Bu okuduğum 2. Agatha Christie kitabıydı. Belki onun kurgularına çabuk adapte oldum, belki de bu kez şansım yaver gitti bilemiyorum; bunu ilerleyen zamanlarda daha net anlayabileceğim. Emin olduğum şey, Agatha okumaktan yine oldukça keyif aldığım. Akıllıca bir kurguydu. Sürükleyiciydi de. Tavsiye ediyorum. Mutlu Noeller,T.
She's the young lady who has everything—including the man her closest companion adores.
Linnet and her new spouse take a voyage on the Nile, where they meet the splendid investigator Hercule Poirot.“A man doesn't wasnt to feel that a woman cares more for him than he cares for her.
He doesn't want to feel owned, body and soul.
This man is mine---he belongs to me!
He wants to get away --- to get free.
He wants to own his woman; he doesn't want her to own him.(Simon Boyle)” ― Death on the Nile
Many years since I've read an Agatha Christie mystery, you tend to forget what a great writer she was. This vintage mystery features the wonderful Hercule Poirot. Loved the exotic location, most of the action takes place on board a boat travelling down the Nile. The mystery component of the novel kept you guessing right up to the end which is always a big plus. Well drawn characters and an engaging plot, time and money well spent.
I have not read all of that many HP stories, but I think this is my favorite mystery so far. I am looking forward to more of them. Although he is retired and taking a vacation cruise on the Nile, he still ends up in charge of a murder and more mystery than he could shake a stick at. Was it only a matter of time?A great cast of nice and not so nice characters, typical of Agatha Christie. The timing of events and how they played out - wonderful!
For me, Agatha Cristie is the most important author of thriller and crime novels.
Adoro perderme en sus atomosferas cargadas de misterio y sofisticación en las que cada uno de los personajes pueden ser heroes o asesinos.
Muerte en el Nilo es sin duda una de sus novelas más conocidas y la verdad es que su fama es bien merecida.
Animo a todos los lectores de novela policíaca y de suspense a que la leáis porqué es realmente una joya de la literatura y de la magia de las palabras.
