Actually, I might catch you off guard, and make you confess something you hadn't planned on telling me, just because your idea of being CAUGHT makes a certain situation in your memory stick out.
What do people do to cover their tracks or smooth over their mistakes?Henry Green, the master of dialogues, embarrassed silences and telling body language, lets a whole set of people - working at a wartime fire station in London - be CAUGHT in various situations, ranging from child abduction and secret love affairs to small mistakes without legal impact but of immense importance for the person's standing in the group.
Green does something spectacular, the song taking on a prophetic tone:As she stood there, gently telling them in music, reflecting aloud, wondering in her low, rich voice, the spot light spread a story over her body and dazzled her cheeks to bend and blend to a fabulous matching of the mood in which she told them, as she pretended to remember the south, the man who had gone, as she held all theirs with her magnificent eyes guardedly flashing, slowly turning from one couple to another, then again dropping her voice, almost sighing, motionless, while beads of sweat began to come like the base of a tiara on her forehead as she told the audience that he could see only as the less dark below her and whose clouded heads, each one, drew nearer to a companion's in this forced communion, this hyacinthine, grape dark fellowship of longing.
He wished it had all been less, as a man can search to find he knows not what behind a netted brilliant skin, the eyes of a veiled face, as he can also go with his young son parted from him by the years that are between, from her, by the web of love, or from the remembered country by the weather, in the sadness of not finding.
Do the netted skin and veiled eyes refer to his wife, the son's mother?
Re-reading Henry Green into 2017 as NYRB reissues all nine of his novels.First blog post on Henry Green as I re-read Caught, now up here.
"War, she thought, was sex." -- A book about the Auxiliary Fire Service during WWII, and people "driven to create memories to compare...hungrily seeking yet another with whom they could spend their last hours." It's a quiet book, but leaves an impression.
Not so good as expected.3* Loving2.5* Caught TR LivingTR Party GoingTR Back
Protagonist Richard Roe is a wealthy widower who joins the auxiliary service and sends his son to the country to live with his sister in law.
There is a complicated relationship between Richard and fire chief, Pye, whose sister abducts Richard���s son (the focus here is not on the actual abduction but rather the psychological consequences that this has on those involved.This was a slow and quiet book.
The majority of the time they are waiting for the bombings to start, Most of the book centers on the waiting period and relationships between members of the auxiliary force and not much happens.
A book about the auxiliary fire service during World War II in London. It is mostly about waiting for anything to happen. It is about the pickering that goes on when there is nothing to do. It is about kissing up to superiors. It is about love at desperate times. About a father who does not connect with his son.It was hard to follow what was going on in the book because sometimes the story shifted to other people/places/times without any hint of it happening. And you understand that things have changes in the middle of a paragraph.
A tour-de-force of prose artistry, a deft ear at dialogue that delineates the gradations of social stratum, a master class in constructing a novel.
With these two absorbing novels I feel that I can get as close, as I ever will do, to experiencing the London Blitz, and how my parents’ generation felt the thrill and fear of wartime London, and time spent underground taking shelter, or in cafes, restaurants, clubs and bars, life in the black-out, and the heady excitement of being alive at such a thrilling time, despite the constant danger and threat of death.
Both novels address these feelings with a wonderful directness, but Henry Green’s writing carries a stronger erotic charge.In 1938 as the prospect of European war grew ever closer so author Henry Green served with the Auxiliary Fire Service in London, believing that this experience would prove fertile ground for his writing ‘to learn about the lives of ordinary people’.
In the introduction,* James Woods describes Green's "almost Shakespearean talent for inventive spoken poetry." This is exactly right.
The poetry pops up out of nowhere, often in a phrase or two swept along by the flow.he came out into a gin-clear air pasted with blue moonlightMost of the novel unfolds in the early months of 1940 in London where Richard Roe, the narrator, apolitical and upper class like Green himself, is serving on the London Auxiliary Fire Service; the big events (Hitler's invasion of Norway, the fall of France, Dunkirk) feel far away.
Granted, Green manages to show the different experiences of men and women throughout the war and the subsequent misunderstandings and disconnections, the difficulty of expressing oneself and one's experiences intelligibly to someone who has different experiences and can, therefore, essentially never truly grasp what you mean.Read this for a seminar on WWII writing, and I can see its value within that frame, but I still feel many, many better novels have been written in this era that express the world view of people in a clearer and less male-focused way.
My eighth Henry Green novel.
As a 2016 New Yorker profile nicely put it, "The Henry Green novel—typically portraying failures of love and understanding, and noisy with the vernacular of industrialists and Cockneys, landowners and servants—was terse, intimate, full of accident and unnerving comedy, exquisite though still exuberant, sensual and whimsical, reflexively figurative yet always surprising, preoccupied with social nuance, generational discord, and sensory phenomena while maintaining an air of abstraction." I don't think anyone writes a dance or restaurant scene better than Green.
In fact, Green convinces me, at least within the confines of his novels, that life is a magnificent dance, of which you can simultaneously appreciate all its disparate parts.
Too sad and jagged to read this sad and jagged book right now. Starting something less so.
But there is a clear, short shelf of his books that are masterpieces, where the plot somehow fits perfectly into Green's idiosyncratic, descriptive technique and the act of reading becomes an all encompassing "experiencing." The majority of the novels actually don't quite "work" for me.
The plot feels totally irrelevant and we keep reading because the language is so startling and lovely.
Caught is a perfect little novel about the London blitz.
Caught beautifully brings to life the London of the blitz; on finishing there's a feeling of having lived through a little sliver of it.(This edition, published in 2016, seems to be the first time Americans have had access to the book in an uncensored edition.
Set in the months preceding the Blitz, 'Caught' deals with the lives of men and women in a London auxiliary fire station. A quick and interesting read, although the working-slang dialogue sometimes really bugged me...
Interesting book which relates the story of men and women in the auxillary fire brigade, how they relate to each other and the wait for the raids to start.
Green obviously read Woolfe but I find his interior explorations more plausible than Woolf's: dreamy, fuzzy, distracted.
(Kinky abuse is ruled out halfway into the book as the sister asks visitor Pye about "her child".)/ Green's voice is low-key throughout; whereas Simon's WW ll novel "The Georgics"' implicit philosophical didacticism and fever-pitch descriptions (nature and war akin in their violence and spectacle) have you join in on the agony and confusion, Green instead explores war's periphery and magically stands it alongside other of life's mysteries and problems.
CAUGHT, though, is a sweet, sharp, clear narrative of a man working the Auxiliary Fire Brigade during the London Blitz.
Green delivers a brilliant sense of how people communicate across great distances--whether across class lines, as strangers are jammed together in a single company for the first time because of the war, or across the distance created in a relationship when a woman is shuttled off to the countryside while her husband remains in the city, neck-deep in the Blitz.
CAUGHT is a fantastic depiction of decent people trying to reach each other across impossible distances in tortuous circumstances.
This wasn't always easy to work through, due to its embrace of certain modernist habits of delivering narrative details in budgeted and strangely chosen measures. Often stilted, often oblique, but just as often better for it. A resonant and memorable reflection on convincing characters, genuinely poetic as often as it's not.
This is normally the kind of novel I would enjoy to read for the language itself. The characters are flawed like real people and they come undone by experiences and by their own rumination. But perspective and time alternate too rapidly without warning. I'm ok with working when I read but this one just wasn't worth the effort.
While Green demonstrates experienced writing skills, this work felt flat and uninviting. Most of the work presented as scattered and lacking direction.
I hated this book. Didn't much care about any of the characters, who barely come alive. I felt some emotion at the end, when the characters' fates are revealed, but mostly it was a hard slog. The prose, particularly the dialog, is so elliptical that it's sometimes very hard to figure out.
I've had a couple of bashes at this one but unfortunately I just can't finish it.
It put me in mind of the famous book review "This is not a novel to be tossed aside lightly.
It should be thrown with great force."I'm sure I'm to blame rather than the book but to my mind this was mostly unreadable tosh, leaping around from one scene and time to another without reason and doing very little when it got there.
The characters seemed to have very little to say but took an age of dithering to say it.I think I may have to bypass Henry Green for sometime yet...
