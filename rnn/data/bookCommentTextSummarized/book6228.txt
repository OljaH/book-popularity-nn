sometimes i used to wonder,"are ghosts for real?" i mean, we always see these movies or t.v. series and read them in books.
and what about all the questions about afterlife.
these questions are somewhat successfully answered by this book.
emphasis on the word "somewhat".
because according to the author, humans or supernatural beings are incapable of answering these queries with clarity.
however the author is a spiritually learned scholar so this book will interest you.
moreover there is so much more in this book than just ghosts.

I read this book before..now want to read again..
Epic book to relax your nerves and think in a more positive light about life and the after life.
Excellent
Discusses the eternal dilemma that runs in the human mind - Is a human being being annihilated at the point of death or is there life after death? People and arguments exist in support of both. Which then is true? A systematic, structured and logical enquiry into the question. Lucid. A very good read.
This is best book to read anyone to understand the life cycle. Not necessary to be religion person to read this book. This book gives with scientific and practical example like big tree resides in small seeds, worm inside mango.. same way the soul presence in everything.. blissful reading.
