I never stopped writing poems. In them is my link with time, with the new life of my people. When I wrote them, I believed in the resounding rhythms reflected in the heroic history of my country. I am happy that I lived in these years and saw events which cannot be equalled. V. 1.0A drawing of Akhmatova by Amadeo Modigliani, pictured in this book. Akhmatova met Modigliani in Paris in 1910. Though she was recently married, it has been said (by Wiki for example) that the two had a love affair. I
There is no end to what I find fascinating about Akhmatova’s life and poetry.Therefore, tonight, the “short” part of the review which was mostly written long ago will be submitted as the entire review.
Akhmatova had six editions of her poetry published in the years 1912 – 1940.
Her poems are often connected to people she knew, admired, loved – and to events, many terrible, that she experienced in her life.
This took time – more than ten years – and at least several versions of each poem.This book was the greatest challenge I’ve ever undertaken in reading poetry.

Translating Akhmatova from Russian must be near impossible; the Russian language is structured so that, more or less, most words can rhyme with all the others by modifying the word endings...
you can hear her tendancy for rhymed couplets if you ever listen to some of her poetry being read around in the original Russian.
I partially chose Hemschemeyer because I wanted to read all of Akhmatova's poems.
what do you say about the Russian poet who changed the face of Russian poetry?
It's so hard to know how to describe her poems when I can't read them in Russian yet.
A great starting place if you’ve never read Anna Akhmatova would be Poems of Akhmatova, Selected, Translated and Introduced by Stanley Kunitz with Max Hayward.
It’s career spanning but at only 173 pages, including presenting the poems in Russian with facing page English translations, it will convince you of her genius and invest you with an interest for a deeper engagement with her work and life.
She remained dedicated to her art and to her homeland and wrote brilliantly, passionately, and tragically about it in the poems that fill this great collection.
And then sometime down the summer road will read Poem Without a Hero again.
Stunning, personally raw poetry from a pioneer of the "acme" school of Russian poetry. Was introduced to her when an 86 yo Russian emigre handed me a small worn copy of a volume of her works, in both English and Russian after we had begun an impromptu conversation about poetry. Put it in my hands, cupped his hands over mine and said "keep this, learn about her. I have no more need of it."
p. 81There is a sacred boundary between those who are close,And it cannot be crossed by passion or love - Though lips fuse in dreadful silenceAnd the heart shatters to pieces with love.Friendship is helpless here, and yearsOf exalted and ardent happiness,When the soul is free and a strangerTo the slow languor of voluptuousness.Those who strive to reach it are mad, and thoseWho reach it - stricken by grief...Now you understand why my heartDoes not beat faster under your hand.
Neither by glance nor by groanWill I touch your cursed soul,But I vow to you by the garden of angels,By the miraculous icon I vowAnd by the fiery passion of our nights -I will never return to you.
I love her poems... and I have her book with me since high school. One of the few books that I took with me when I moved overseas.There is a site with awesome translations to Enlish https://sites.google.com/site/poetrya...made me realize that my own translations of poems loose poetic sense and become pure translations ))
I haven't read the complete collection, just an edited anthology with Kunitz translating.A slow and languorous howl of a collection - Russian poetry at some of its finest. Intense emotions in sparse words.
Her poetry is breathtaking.
Since I was required to read one of Akmatova’s works in my World Literature course I found myself enthralled with her poetry.
Much of her works seems to focus more on emotion then imagery, metaphor or symbolism rather then sensory.
Hemschemeyer’s translation, I feel, brought out the true poetry in her words as Hemschemeyer not only translated it and oriented it to her era, but also created work that flowed, almost magically, from sentence to sentence, poem to poem.
My soul focus right now is poetry and since reading Akhmatova’s works I find myself striving to create the emotional appeal which she was able to create for me.
Anna Akhmatova's first husband was murdered by Lenin's secret police the Cheka.
Her next husband and her son were both sent to the Gulag by Stalin.
Most people would have a complete breakdown after enduring such tragedy.
Akhmatova, much like fellow poet Paul Celan, turned that unbelievable suffering into some of the greatest poetry of the 20th century.
Few have ever captured the suffering of their native people the way Akhmatova did.
Her most famous poem and quite possibly my favorite is "Requiem"Interesting tidbit: She was a proven descendent of Genghis Khan and had a Mongol grandmother from whom she took her pen name.
Okay, I only made it through about half of this, maybe a little more. It's a broswing book I'll learn my way into, I hope. When she's good, it's astonishing, when it's not. . .it's not. I think I expected more knock-my-sox-off work than I actually found, hence the somewhat muted rating.
It's a long collection. There's a lot of poems. But you're not in a Soviet gulag or under the surveillance of the KGB. So stop complaining. Relax. You'll get through it. And it's worth it. "Can you write about this? Yes, I can." - Anna Akhmatova
she knew
Another mammoth undertaking and I'm hardly worthy of reviewing it (is anyone?), but well worth the slog if you can hang with Akhmatova.
This fulfills the challenge for reading a collection of poetry in translation on a theme other than love.There are love poems in this anthology (and I probably should mention here that what I wrote was merely Vol. 1 of the collection), but many poems are Akhmatova's reflections on her growing up during the Russian Revolution, her distaste for Communism and her faith.
The forwards by Hemschemeyer and Reeder are definitely worth the time to read for better understanding.
I usually don't read end notes, but these, too, are worth checking out.
Exceptional!
Wow. This complete book of poems of Akhmatova was a mind-blower.
Would have like bilingual, but it would have had to be in two monstrous volumes.
Akhmatova was brilliant at the start and got even moreso as her life went on--and is simply a testimony to how a poem can condense an enormous experience into just a few lines.
Poem Without a Hero, Northern Elegies and Requiem came late in her writing life, pure tragedy, like a cello, or someone playing a piano in a huge empty hall.
The more I read about her, the more the poems unlock their secrets.

I inherited this book from my late wife, Keena, who studied Russian. Though I have never studied either the Russian language nor its literature, when I discovered this book among Keena's things I started reading it on the spot, and was immediately taken by it. Akhmatova was truly a great poet. Many thanks to my wife for posthumously introducing me to her work.
Akhmatova's poetry has a moral compass and integrity that feels almost lost. Whose words, which poet's, today would you memorize in order to preserve?! In a way, the writing of extremity forces us to read in extremity.A haunting story: Before Mandelstam was taken away by the secret police, Akhmatova offered him an egg (her entire dinner) to eat.
One of the most powerful and grounded poets i've read. It is hard not to feel the weight of desperation that so much of this was written under. I carried this around for about 3 months and am relieved to put it down for a while. I'll be back to it though. I don't know if i'll ever exhaust this work.
Some of the most interesting and well written poetry I've read. Definitely the best I've indulged in since school, and became a gateway drug to other Russian and Ukrainian poets. Strong female voice, russian sensibility. Overall, a must read for poets and appreciators.
I keep this on my bedside and read it frequently. Her verses are so beautiful. They are particularly touching when you read the story behind the poem. I'm not a huge poetry reader, but her stuff is wonderful.
As a reader who is infatuated with this era in Russian history, Akhmatova's poetry is gold. Or should I say silver given she wrote in the Silver Age. She conjures up St Petersburg/Petrograd for me and this translation is beautiful.
Favourite quote: 'We thought we were beggars, we thought we had nothing at all. But then we started to lose one thing after another, Each day became a memorial day- And then we made songs of great divine generosity & of our former riches.'
The sharp triteness and poignant terseness of Akhmatova's poetry is one that requires some getting used to, at first. But once I got through over fifty of them, I could not describe her as anything else but a brutally frank realist that lived through most of the dilemmas evoked in her poetry.
What a woman! What a mother! Man, I'm so glad I wasn't born Russian!
She's obviously a goddess
I'm very selective with poetry. These poems are dark, sad and mournful ... but beautiful, beautiful, beautiful.
