On board the train Grey meets Ruth Kettering, an American heiress leaving her unhappy marriage to meet her lover.
Ruth's father, the American millionaire Rufus Van Aldin, and his secretary, Major Knighton, persuade Poirot to take on the case.
Katherine says she saw Derek enter Ruth's compartment.
Eventually, the dancer Mirelle, who was on the train with Derek, tells Poirot she saw Derek leave Ruth's compartment around the time the murder would have taken place.

Oh so very close to 5 stars.
If only we had halves !?!?I thoroughly enjoyed this book, the settings , the characters and of course Poirot's masterful investigation into the murder and robbery.
I must admit towards the end I thought I had worked out who did it, but didn't know why.
It just goes to show how enjoyable these books are.As I said at the start it is certainly a 4.5 star read and one of the most enjoyable Poirot novels so far, and it takes me ahead of the game in this group buddy read.
3.5"Life is like a train [...].
Trust the train, Mademoiselle," murmured Poirot again.
"And trust Hercule Poirot.
So sue me.Before I begin, there's one thing I want to be clear about: I've read more than 20 of Christie's books, and I enjoyed unreservedly every single one of them.
I may have complaints about the solution of the mystery or about some other nothing, but every single time, I enjoy them.
I was slightly disappointed in the solution because the reason why I like crime novels, mostly, is that they get their strength from the great deal of strong, violent emotion they usually involve.
In many ways this is a typical Hercule Poirot type of mystery: a wealthy man's daughter is murdered on a train for a set of fabulous rubies, and only a limited number of people could have gotten on or off the train at the right times to make them suspects ...
or so one might think, but who ever knows for sure with Agatha Christie?This book was, for me, a cut above the typical Poirot mystery, and I think it's mostly because I liked the main character so much.
And Katherine (though she's not a suspect) was, during her travels, coincidentally one of the last to see the murdered woman alive.
This book reminds me that Dennis Diderot said something along the lines of "Men will never be free until the last king is strangled with the entrails of the last priest." By the time I reached about the 100th page I doubted I could wait until the entrails of the last priest were available, dried and suitably braided for that excellent task, nor was I particularly fussed whether certain people were technically kings or not, fortunately for my blood pressure I avoided Downton Abbey when it was on, so I found a novel about toss pots behaving like toss pots close to unbearable, particularly as there was only the one death (view spoiler)[ and that not caused by irritable person with convenient chair in the library  (hide spoiler)]"I can sound my h's dear, as well as anyone, but Helen is  not a suitable name for a servant.
I'd recommend starting with others starring the detective first.Christie whips out intriguing characters that have a richer background of emotion in this one compared to some of her other works - an almost saintly, now rich young woman Katherine Grey who has a quiet humor and little bit of mischief about her.
It showed in this book she was kind of tired of the detective that made her so famous.Unlike some of her other works, the crime doesn't stay in the scene.
There is the interesting setting – the murder on the luxurious train (sadly, not much of the story actually occurs on the train itself), the exotic location of the Riveria and Poirot – as ever, doing a little match-making alongside his sleuthing.
This novel also features the first mention of St Mary Mead (home, in later work, of Miss Marple) and of a character, Mr Goby, who later appears in, “After the Funeral,” and “The Third Girl.” There is, indeed, a little of the Miss Marple in the elderly ladies that Katherine Grey looks after.
Aldin asks Poirot to find Ruth’s murderer and he turns his little grey cells to the problem.
2.5/5 stars (not rounding up) I must be getting very picky, as this is the very first book by Agatha Christie that I did not enjoy.
Usually, I just generally like them - they are all nice and cozy little mysteries, but apparently not this one.
There was very little actual detective work in it.
And in the end many, many questions were left unanswered.
But still in the end - it was all just very anti-climatic.There are many GREAT mysteries by Agatha Christie, I mean she wrote over 80 books.But this is not one of them.My WEBSITEMy INSTAGRAMMy WORDPRESS BLOG
لغز القطار الأزرق كالكثيرين، لأجاثا كريستي في مخيلتي مذاق المراهقة، عندما كنت أقرؤها في عصريات صيف بعيد، محاولاً بدأب معرفة القاتل، قبل أن يتوصل إليه هرقل بوارو، وهو مالم أفلح به أبداً، لأن أجاثا لم تكن عادلة، كانت تبقي أهم الخيوط بين يديها، لهذا لم تكن أجاثا كريستي مفضلة لدي في تلكم المرحلة، بسبب شعور الغبن الذي كان يجتاحني بعد الفراغ من الرواية، كيف كان لي أن أعرف أن القاتل فلان !
I'm presently reading Agatha Christie's famous detective Hercule Poirot in the written order (skipping one or two depending on my interest and accessibility).
My view is that Agatha Christie's unrivaled popularity as a murder-mystery writer is undoubtedly rests on her brilliantly written plots.
She lays down clues; invites the reader to solve the mystery alongside her famous detective Poirot.
In an attempt to misdirect the reader and to take him by surprise at the end, Christie keeps things hidden in Poirot's mind without expressing them.
This secrecy and the vagueness of the clues made me, as a reader, to fall out a little with the story.
Update 23 JanI am sorry to say this about an Agatha Christie book, but it was MEH-MEH-MEH.
Badly structured, trying to be too many things at the same time, like Agatha Christie couldn't quite make up her mind what it was she was writing.
Update 19 JanI read this a long time ago and it did not make a big impression, because I couldn't for the life of me remember, who the murderer was or why the victim was killed (one of my benchmarks for detective fiction, though definitely not the only one) - so maybe this will be like reading the book for the first time.
“Those who have listened do not find it easy to talk; they keep their sorrows and joys to themselves and tell no one.”I will try to make this a fast non-spoilery reviewSo, Agatha's book are my guilty pleasure reads and this was my 5th book and it was good, I started reading her best and most famous books so I try to go to those less famous works without high expectations.I like Hercules Poirot, he is the most peculiar and impertinent detective ever, and I like how the character is so unique but it feels real in all her books.“You tell your lies and you think nobody knows.
Arg! How did I miss all the clues? Guess I didn’t use my “little gray cells.”  This book introduced St. Mary Mead which is where Agatha Christie has based another series featuring a sweet little old lady who solves crimes while drinking tea and knitting.  Excellent who- dunnit! 😊
What can I say? Any train mystery by Christie is a joy to read. I can't say it's one of her best books, but still much better than most of the crime fiction.
But did he do it?At first I had no idea who killed poor Ruth but I wanted some god damn revenge.
Now aside from Derek being a grade A douche bag, this book was kind of "meh" to me.
It just seemed super slow paced and that no one really wanted to solve this murder.
Like all they did was talk and talk and talk and then BAM murder was solved!
At one point I stopped caring about the murder and Ruth's revenge.
I just kind of wanted this book to be over.
Ruth's and Derek's marriage is one of convenience, not love (and for any mystery reader, the obviousness of him as possible murderer takes him out of the running pretty quickly, eh?).Then there’s someone Ruth may have been seeing on the side, the Comte de La Roche who could also use the cash.
But is the murder linked to the theft?There’s a woman, Katherine Grey, that we come to like very much, one of the best of Christie’s early characters.
Do we have enough characters for a line-up?There are many many slyly satirical comments about women throughout, such as this exchange between Miss Viner and Katherine:Ms. Viner: “Don't think you'll get married, though, my dear, because you won't.
I have always enjoyed Agatha Christie, particularly those stories featuring Hercule Poirot.
van Aldin encourages Ruth to divorce Derek at the same time that he is presenting her with some rubies.
Of course Ruth doesn't listen to her father and not only takes the rubies with her but she has her own secrets.When the train arrives in Nice the conductor attempts to wake Ruth only to discover that she has been murdered.
Of course the main suspect is Ruth's husband, Derek, but Poirot is not so sure.
On the train at the time Ruth was murdered was Katherine Grey from St. Mary Mead.
I kept expecting Poirot to run into Miss Marple, as though she had always lived there even before Christie first wrote about her!
However, there are some good twists in The Mystery of the Blue Train; I figured out the culprits rather early but she still kept me guessing--in fact, I was surprised to find I was right!
Overall, this was much better than I expected, and I think my favorite thing, really, was seeing her play around with the logistics of a murder on a train.
audio.Ruth Kettering did not marry for love.
She had money, which her impoverished husband needed, and he had a stately home to be inherited.
However, her husband has not been discreet with his dalliances, and Ruths millionaire father strongly advises her to divorce him.But is Ruth quite as innocent as she seems?
She has some rather murky shadows in her past which threaten to surface when she is found murdered in her luxury compartment on The Blue Train en-route to meet her former lover.And who has her jewels, which have disappeared?Ruth's father hires Hercule Poirot to bring his daughter's killer to justice.The twists and turns are Classic Christie!
التقييم الحقيقي :٣.٥رواية خفيفة، لا توجد فيها الكثير من التفاصيل، وسبب التقييم المتدني هو انني تمكنت من معرفة المجرم. ولكن كيف تمت الجريمة وشخصية المجرم(ماضيه) اثارت دهشتي
A typical Christie murder mystery set in the luxurious Blue train. The beginning is quite mysterious and eerie and builds up for the train journey where the action takes place. However in the second half the story loses its pace and becomes a drag. Poirot's investigations at some point becomes too boring and you actually weave a sigh once the murderer is revealed. Average plot
Agatha Christie is considered "the Queen of Crime" as she wrote many masterpieces.
This book is not one of my favourites, but the plot is well built and Hercule Poirot is a fictional and logical Belgian detective that focuses on getting people to talk and of course in the end he solves the case and discovers the crime!
I will soon read again other novels of Agatha Christie where there besides Hercule Poirot there is also Miss Marple, an old lady who has spent her life in the small village of St Mary Mead, but as she often points out she has had every opportunity to observe human nature.
Reference NotesSeries: Hercule Poirot #7 (1928)Narrator: (3rd person)Victim: Mrs. Ruth KetteringCOD: StrangulationSuspects:Hon. Derek Kettering (victim's husband)Comte Armand de la Roche (victim's lover)Mlle. Mirelle (Derek's lover)Ms. Ada Mason (victim's maid)Maj. Richard Knighton (victim's father's secretary)Fun Fact: Ms. Katherine Grey, a key witness to some events regarding the murder, is originally from St. Mary Mead, Kent. While I was reading this book, I kept wondering if she was friends with Ms. Marple. :)
This is probably the most disappointing Christie book that I have read. It wasn't terrible, it just wasn't up to her usual standards and the mystery was a little underwhelming.Possibly the most interesting part was the introduction of St Mary's Mead as a location, which seems odd in a Poirot book, but then Marple wasn't introduced with her own book until two years after this was published.
Me siento el Doctor cada vez que leo un libro de Agatha y lo adivino. Y me encanta ♡
This was one of those books that I just didn’t want to end.To my mind, it quickly unfolded as the absolutely archetypical Christie.
And the plot, as it begins to twist, seems to be woven from several distinct and intriguing strands, each with its own merit.But there was another reason I didn’t want it to end.
A psychological rather than logistical explanation would have been so much more satisfactory.It didn’t ruin the enjoyment of the journey – it’s The Mystery Of The Blue Train after all – but the final destination just lacked satisfaction for this solver of such puzzles.
I cannot judge how true these characters are, and when someone like Mirelle, or the Compte de la Roche appears, I'm at a loss to understand whether Agatha Christie is improvising or whether these creatures really walked the good Earth at some point in the lost past.
But a train, I think has more romance, especially one peopled by the sorts that the author imagined here.
And if I remember correctly, most Agatha Christie murders happen because of urgency and viral necessity.
But I did guess the murderer's identity.
In my youth I read most of the Poirot mysteries in French, in disorder.
3.5 stars Read this as part of 2018 Ultimate Reading Challenge, Category: "A book published in the 20th century".  'My name is Hercule Poirot,' he said quietly,'and I am probably the greatest detective in the world.'  If anyone else said this statement it would have sounded conceited but as it's Poirot saying this it just works.

Not that it doesn't sound boastful but we know that's Poirot for us.This book is about a murder committed on a train- somehow I expected something along the lines of Murder on the Orient Express (view spoiler)[but apart from the murder happening on the train, everything else is poles apart.
Did I guess the murderer?- Part of it but there was a part of it all that I couldn't guess!The book diverges a bit from Christie's other books as Katherine (who was also travelling on the train) gets a feeling that the spirit of the victim is pointing towards the murderer.
Objectively, this isn't one of Christie' s best but it remains a firm favourite of mine - and that's despite the snobbishness of the characters and the general air of wealth and luxury.
Christie exposes both, I think, when she makes us snigger at an old woman complaining about the 'lower orders' naming their daughter Helen - no name for a housemaid!
And by having the sensible outsider walk off with the handsome Lord (even though one wonders what would have happened if she hadn't been left a fortune...) The plot is more thriller-ish than true puzzle with jewel thieves and the ubiquitous bashed in face of the victim (an obvious clue, surely), but this remains highly readable with some lovely comic moments between Poirot and his very proper valet, Georges.
I continue to be amazed at Christie's ability to give such a specific voice and personality to each new cast of her novels. And Poirot was brilliant as usual.
