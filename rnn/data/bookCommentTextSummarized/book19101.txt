***If you have not read the book, but intend to, do not read my review.***I loved the first half of the book because of the race to correct an injustice - to do the right thing.
Donte Drumm, an innocent man, was put to death because of the need of the racists in his town to exact revenge.
The death peanlty only works for people who are alive and breathing and need to take out their hate and anger on another person.
Another thing in the book that made me very sad was that Donte was blamed for the crime primarily because of his race.
I feel so cynical, but seriously at times I felt like I was reading a political persuasion book, not a novel---"forget the story for a moment: let me persuade you to oppose the death penalty then we will go back to what happens next in the story"...Ever notice that all those on the left were painted as great protaganists with kindness, honor and glory and those on the right were made out to be selfish, stupid pigs that wouldn't lift a finger for anyone but themeselves?
Dunno why he even bothered having a plot to this book, the veil over the pontificating isn't even thin.
This book is basically a treatise on why the Death Penalty is eviller than anything man ever ever did I swear to you really, it's bad nasty evil.
Grisham is a good writer and draws you into a story, and while his books often have a ham-handed message to impart, like "help the homeless" (The Street Lawyer) or "lawyers are evil"; this book is a punch in the face with a book attached.
It's like a Kanye West tirade.
Read The Confession. As in 'red', past tense, or 'reed', you read this. I'm referring to John Grisham's  The Confession: A Nove l, published in 2010. I devoured it over a 48 hour period, fast reading for me, but it was a page turner and page burner. Totally engrossing. Only once, briefly, did I think "Oh yeah, another Grisham novel". Multiple story lines, where will they converge? Grisham is a master at this. He can weave a taut tale, getting into a character's being and making him seem very rea

The Confession: A Nove
Only once, briefly, did I think "Oh yeah, another Grisham novel".
Multiple story lines, where will they converge?
Grisham is a master at this.
It was nicely wrapped up too, IMO, completing all the story lines thoroughly.
Too many popular authors these days seem to churn out a great story, then realize they've got to conclude before it gets too long and they rush to a quick, unsatisfying conclusion.
I approve of Grisham's message 100%, but my goodness this book is repetitive and tedious.
An examination of the force of those pressures would have made a much more interesting book.
Or an examination of the Supreme Court's reasoning that innocence is not a defense?
(See Connick v Thomson.) To quote Reason Magazine: "Scalia has written in the past that there's nothing in the Constitution to prevent the government from executing an innocent person.
He also apparently believes there's no duty for the government to preserve or turn over evidence that would prove a person's innocence.
Something about Grisham novels make them my go-to books for reading on flights -- his expertise is pacing, I've decidied This is pure soapbox Grisham -- an anti death penalty diatrabe. However, I think anyone who's ever watched a few episodes of Law and Order could have done a better job keeping the accused off death row. [Later: Okay, I've added an extra star to this book since reading this article in the New Yorker from 2009 about Cameron Todd Willingham. Apparently the Texas criminal justice system can be as bad as Grisham describes.
There are mistakes in this book, as always, and as long as I continue to loathe research, while at the same time remaining perfectly content to occasionally dress up the facts, I'm afraid the mistakes will continue."Here's one small example of the sorts of mistakes he makes.
The court will grant a cert petition if there are four votes to consider the case.
Thus, its perfectly possible for the Court to grant a petition for cert, but fail to stay the execution.
And, of course, once the execution gets carried out, the case becomes moot, and is thus dropped.Grisham wrote an anti-death penalty polemic thinly disguised as a novel.
As a criminal defense attorney, I appreciated Grisham's expression of certain insights into how criminal justice actually works.
Innocent people do get arrested, convicted, even executed.
Innocent people do make false confessions.
Grisham does a fine job bringing in a many dimensions of a criminal case -- how it touches upon a great many people.
And he well understands how,the urgency of our need to have answers very easily leads to incomplete and erroneous investigations, where once a theory of the case is hatched, police and detectives often lose their self-discipline, their critical edge.
If you're in the mood to read 400+ pages of liberal preaching, then go ahead and pick this book up.
Of course, by the time the heavy preaching comes, you're more than halfway through the book and want to know what happens to the characters.Speaking of the characters, they were poorly developed (all of them), and really more of a channel through which Grisham preached his political point of views.
I found it extremely insulting to readers that Grisham thought that anyone would want to read several straight pages about various anti-death penalty groups under the guise that the "character" was "reasearching" them online.
When you pick up a Grisham book it’s like taking a big gamble.
I have to say that this book did not move slowly but fast.
Grisham goes back and forth from the present to the past and also between so many other characters, a lot of whom just felt like fillers for the book.
Reading a book like this novel, one would only hope for some suspense and drama, both of which was clearly lacking.
I have to say I don’t think I’ll read any of his books again.
An innocent man that the system failed is on death row, while Grisham's heros struggle to bring truth and justice to light.
Offensive to law enforcement and real victims of violent crimes, who appreciate the good guys in blue.
Their work to protect society from criminals is demeaned by the author's assumption that they are incompetent at best and, at worst, actively assisting in the persecution of innocent people.
And the entire justice system is also undermined by the seed the author purposely plants that there could be an innocent man on death row.
Very enjoyable and exciting thriller. I actually gasped out loud twice during this book, and I never got bored reading it. I haven't read a Grisham novel in years - - - I really liked this and found it to be an engrossing and quick read.
But his singular focus on the horror of execution in this book makes the entire message backfire, and the reader may actually depart with the opposite sentiment from the one Grisham plainly desires -- that is, the reader may conlude that it takes such a fanciful set of circumstances to cause the execution of an innocent man that the risk of it happening in the real world is exceptionally low indeed.Grisham never really connects the dots between wrongful conviction -- a very real problem -- and his opposition to capital punishment, and the result is that it often looks like he's straining to use a real problem to bootstrap opposition to a different problem.
Reading The Confession I learned, if Mr. Grisham has his facts right, and of course he does, that in Texas they will convict for murder even if there's no dead body, AND, they can and will sentence you to death even if no dead body or DNA or evidence of any kind to speak of!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Maybe I need a few more exclamation points!In Grisham's (I think) second book dedicated to slamming the death penalty, the action is all last minute.
A guy is just days away from execution in Texas when someone else confesses to a Lutheran minister that he is the real killer.
In Texas, what the officials really cared about was chalking up another successful execution, and not much more.
In the meantime, officials in Sloan arrested a young black man, Donte Drumm, a classmate of Nicole's, who confessed to the murder that Boyette claims to have committed.
For the last nine years, Flak has done everything possible to delay the execution, but all of Donte's appeals have been exhausted and he is scheduled to die within days.After his confession to Keith Schroeder, Boyette suggests that he might be willing to go to Texas and tell his story in the hope of saving Donte.
Although I am anti-death penalty and liberal and should have been Grisham's chosen choir to preach to, I couldn't finish the thing.
Example: (view spoiler)[ While the minister is driving bad guy to Texas, lawyer keeps telling him to hurry, hurry, hurry.
(hide spoiler)]The narrator in the audio version I listened to did his best to use different voices for the different characters, but even he couldn't do anything about the words.
Grisham didn't bother to give different voices to his characters.
One thing I did learn from this book is that I will not be reading any more Grisham ever again.
Sapete quando incontreremo di nuovo Mrs Aurelia e Mr Charles Cooper?
Mai.Al terzo piano del St Francis Hospital, Mrs Aurelia Lindmar si stava riprendendo da un intervento alla cistifellea e si sentiva piuttosto bene.
Al terzo piano si fermò a parlare nel corridoio con quella che tra non molto sarebbe diventata la vedova di Mr Charles Cooper, un attivo membro di St Mark il cui cuore malandato stava ormai per cedere.
La mia speranza è che siano insignificanti.Al di là dell'atteggiamento spocchioso, non capisco perché i lettori dovrebbero segnalare punti apparentemente erronei quando ce ne sono di realmente erronei.A re Grisham tutto è concesso.
This one covers the suspenseful hours potentially leading up a man's execution in East Texas during which time we see if the true murderer, the pastor escorting him and the convicted man's defense attorney can convince the authorities they have the wrong man.
Although it is darker in subject matter than most of his work (including a brutal murder, wrongful conviction and looming execution), the book is full of the typical Grisham characters including powerful villains spinning a web of conspiracy versus an spunky team of underdog heroes risking it all in the fight for justice.
"Death is death and in the end nothing else matters except your relationship with God." A truer statement would be tough to find anywhere in the world. It's sad that this isn't the focus of this book as Grisham once again uses his popularity as a platform for his anti-capital punishment views. Oh, and to highlight racist attitudes within the judicial system.This time, we have a convicted murderer on death row awaiting his fate. The victim's body has never been found, but that isn't a problem in
400 miles away in Kansas, Travis Boyette, a low-life criminal with a serious of sexual convictions, interrupts the life of a country vicar with his own confession of guilt.
There were details of murder and some sexual detail but I don't recall anything overly graphic.I guess the moral of this story is that your conscience will eat away at you if there are skeletons in your closet.
Boyette thought he had gotten away with murder, and in reality he had because another man was awaiting execution for the crime.
An innocent man is about to be executed. Only a guilty man can save him.When? Who? What?But this  never happened ! The innocent guy gets mercilessly executed while the criminal is still on the loose, hiding away. It is only when he realizes that he's got terminal brain tumor and will die soon anyway, that he thinks of THE CONFESSION, a change of his heart a little too late!! Painfully with tear-brimming eyes, I braced and watched(I could feel it) Donte getting executed, for nothing, spending eve
Painfully with tear-brimming eyes, I braced and watched(I could feel it) Donte getting executed, for nothing, spending every aching moment that someone, anyone will stop it from happening.
I waited for that one miracle which never happened.And post Donte's execution I never had the heart to continue reading the book.
The book was a real drag or maybe I was just too absorbed with Donte's execution that I saw no point in the latter part of the story.I mean, okay, we know that is what happens in real-life crime cases.
***Please note: this review contains spoilers***The subject matter of this disturbing book is the death penalty – more specifically, wrongful prosecution and the miscarriage of justice.It is a story about a serial sex offender whose life is allegedly coming to an end because of an inoperable brain tumor.
The second story carries larger implications; society is the ultimate victim, and ironically, the perpetrator, the second killer.I suppose the most disturbing part of this story is how, through legal processes and religious appropriation, something as sacred and high-minded as justice can be meted out so rationally and, with so much slight-of-hand.
Every one in the book was characterized as a bad stereotype except the self proclaimed "radical" liberal lawyer (his main character) and those who Grisham deemed worthy.
There was only one right answer in this book, and everyone else was not just wrong, but evil.
Everyone in this story was made to look bad, corrupt, and evil, except the main characters.
Nothing, and I mean nothing went into character development for any of the characters that were on Grisham's apparent hit list.
This was my first Grisham book since The Partner, which I loved.
If this is indicative of where John Grisham's writing is, count me out.
I have nothing but the truth.’Less than a week before the scheduled execution of Donté Drumm, convicted ten years ago for a murder he did not commit, the real killer steps forward.
Travis Boyette, a convicted serial rapist on parole, approaches Keith Schroeder (a Christian minister) in Topeka and confesses to the murder.
Reluctantly, Keith Schroeder agrees to drive Boyette to the town where the murder occurred in the hope that a confession will stop the scheduled execution of Drumm.
Keith Schroeder joins forces with Donté Drumm’s defence lawyer, Robbie Flak in the hope that they can at least halt the scheduled execution until Boyette’s story is checked.
I have read or listened to almost every one of John Grisham's books.
If the book is based on reality, then our legal system is seriously flawed and Texas should be removed from being one of the 50 states of the USA.
This book had me yelling at the reader to stop with what he was saying because what was happening was so egregious that it terrified me.
If this is truly fiction and not based on fact, good for you John.
If however, it is based on fact, then shame on the USA.
We need to get up in arms about the various ways that the legal system is flawed.
IMHO skip this book.It nothing but cheap cliches about anti death penalty arguments.
No nuances here: Death penalty=bad and inexcusable in all cases.Granted, many death row inmates have been later exonerated with DNA evidence, etc.There was the potential for a thoughtful anti death penalty argument here; however, this book is not it.It is painted with way too broad a brush, none of the characters are sympathetic.
Just like the 'The Chamber' by the same author, 'The Confession' too deals with the highly controversial issue of the Death Penalty.
But while the former had a plot, storyline, strong characters, this book reads a more like a political statement where the story, the characters,all have been relegated to the background.
The book feels long, the characters feel one-dimensional,the plot is convoluted and the preaching gets repetitive till the point of boredom.
Grisham uses the problem of wrongful conviction to further his opposition to capital punishment and wastes an opportunity to present a thoughtful argument against the death penalty (which you may or may not agree).Overall, A disappointing read.
This book consists of three parts, “The Confession” where a Lutheran minister, Keith, is visited by a convict, Travis Boyette and ends up listening to his shocking confession leaving just a few days until the execution of an innocent man, Donté Drumm, who was wrongly convicted and sentenced to death.The second part, “Punishment” is all about a frantic race against time to stop the looming execution.
It was done in a very objective, rather quiet manner yet the tension was definitely there, and that was one of the things that I really loved about this book.To put in a nutshell, I absolutely enjoyed reading this book.
Not bad. My first John Grisham book and I thoroughly enjoyed it. The characters were three dimensional and easy to connect to.
Decent book. A little preachy at times. Kept me interested throughout. I can say that it is a plot that definitely makes you think.
when i was a freshman in college the only thing i had in my mini-fridge was salami and white bread.
john grisham isn't my favorite author in the legal thriller genre and his novels have become increasingly formulaic in scope.
in other words, john grisham gives me mouth pleasure.
it's a book made for our times in many ways and it DOES get the brain thinking (yay) about our current societal ideals and black vs white crimes and how race is treated in the courtroom--but if you're already woke you can skip this one, i think.none the less, i like mouth pleasure.
