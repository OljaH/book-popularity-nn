This may be an unpopular opinion, but Tommy and Tuppence Beresford are my favorite of Agatha Christie's detectives. Poirot is brilliant and much appreciated, but Tommy and Tuppence are charmingly brilliant and absolutely hilarious. I love these short stories, in which the Beresfords take over a detective agency and solve a series of crimes of varying severity. Throughout, they refer to their "shelf of masters", adapting the mannerisms and techniques of various literary detectives, to hilarious effect. My favorite is Tommy's mangled violin playing as he apes Sherlock Holmes.
The Second of Tommy and Tuppence series it is a collection of 15 of their adventures, many styled after leading fictional detectives of the era including Sherlock Holmes. In one of the stories there is a delightful take on Hercule Poirot too. Not strictly in the same crime and mystery genre as Chritie's other stories, the stories here are light and fun
Loved all of Tommy and Tuppence's banter and the cleverly placed references to other famous sleuths of the 'Golden age of crime'. Some mysteries were definitely better than others, but overall this collection was just a lot of fun to read!
A collection of short stories mimicking famous literary detectives (even though some of them are practically unknown today), even Sherlock Holmes and Christie's own Hercule Poirot. Some of the stories are really fun, others utterly unremarkable. All in all, a pleasant read.
I remember not liking it much at that time: and the reread did not change my opinion.
Tommy and Tuppence Beresford, IMO, are Agatha Christie's weakest detectives even though they are an endearing couple.
The premise of this collection of short stories is really nice: the Beresfords, having helped the police to trap spies in the First World War, are asked to manage a bogus detective agency which is only a front for a Soviet espionage operation.
Except for two ("The Man in the Mist", "The Sunningdale Mystery"), none brought me the feeling of "Aha!" I usually get at the end of a Christie story.
Tommy and Tuppence are an interesting detective duo.
Not serious as Poirot and perhaps not as brilliant like him, but the duo keep the reader's interest in their detective adventures.
It was interesting to note that there were certain references made to other fictitious detectives including Sherlock Holmes and Hercule Poirot, as the duo considered which detective's method they should apply to the case at hand.
I did enjoy Tommy and Tuppence adventures.
Their gaiety and careless manner was quite a contrast to Christie's most beloved detective, Hercule Poirot.
This wish is granted by a photo fairy -- but really, by Mr Carter of Scotland Yard who have taken over a private detective agency which is under suspicion of being part of an espionage ring.
This is to be their cover story.The fun part is that to show off their cleverness and knowledge of the "Grand Masters" by taking on the detectives' methods they had read in their classics.
Christie must have had a good time tweaking her fellow crime writers and their creations -- she even included her own Poirot and the constantly bewildered Hastings.I did not recognize some of the detectives, but I hope to read some of their stories.
I think I’m addicted to Agatha Christie’s books! I love her writing style. And I love the mystery in all her cases. I decided that I’m going to buy all her books. No matter how many did she write, I want them all! 😍
I was digging out things from my shelves because I have been packing, and I have been finding these massive hardcover Agatha Christie novels that my mother bought when she was younger. And while they aren't the best, I haven't been able to stop reading these. Cosy, English mysteries are apparently really my kind of books.
The best Tommy and Tuppence I've read. It's a collection of short stories - maybe that's why. The characters get to shine without bogging down the whole thing with their antics. T&T are my least favorite Christie characters by far, I really didn't expect to like this book. It also helped that the stories were centered more on simpler, cosier mystery, not espionage.
Capital! Tommy and Tuppence mystery's are one in a million, and practically the only ones that can leave you with a warm and fuzzy feeling.  In this one, the undaunted couple take on running a detective agency, under assumed names, to ensnare a few dangerous spies for Scotland Yard. In among that though, they also solve several murders, and assorted and alternately humorous mysteries!
Härlig samling med noveller. Tommy och Tuppence är helt klart två underbara karaktärer!

And six years later they were still living together happily ever afterwards..."Tommy and Tuppence, who were first introduced in the book "The Secret Adversary",are now happily married but Tuppence is restless and bored.
Meanwhile they are to run the detective agency as their own and solve any cases that come their way.The book contains short accounts of different cases that come their way with the secret Russian angle running in the background in all the stories.Agatha Christie wrote these stories as parodies on the famous detectives of 1920s like Sherlock Holmes, John Thorndyke, Father Brown, Tommy McCarty and even Poirot.
Tuppence es impulsiva, carismática y muy intuitiva, mientras que Tommy es más práctico, con menos imaginación y por eso es capaz de ver con mayor facilidad los hechos reales.
Los demás detectives no los conozco.Es un libro entretenido pero no es nada del otro mundo, especialmente porque la mayoría de los crímenes que se investigan no tienen que ver con asesinatos y más con robos y espías, tan típicos de las novelas de la época (1929).
Sehr unterhaltsame "Krimi"-Episoden: Das liebenswerte Ehepaar Tommy und Tuppence Beresford führt eine Under-Cover-Detektei namens "Detektei Blunt". Da sie den Schein aufrecht erhalten müssen, übernehmen sie in den einen und anderen Fall. Dabei schlüpfen sie in die Rollen berühmter Detektiv-Duos aus der Literatur (Holmes-Watson, Poirot-Hastings, Thorndyke-Jervis etc). Bei ihren Ermittlungen haben die beiden allerdings mehr Glück als Verstand... Das beeinträchtigt das Lesevergnügen aber keineswegs!

Mrs Christie must have enjoyed writing these stories very much, with their bright, witty dialogue and humour.
One wonders if they might have been a partial inspiration for Nick and Nora Charles.
I certainly recognised the seeds of cosy-detective stories by much later authors, such as Kerry Greenwood.
I also heard of sensational authors of the Golden Age that I've never read (scampers off to check Gutenberg for titles).This book of short stories seems like Christie started it as a novel and then switched.
I wonder if they came out in magazines first, or were published as a collection.
Tommy and Tuppence have always reminded me of Nick and Nora Charles of The Thin Man movie series, and I mean that in the nicest way possible.
Now, Tommy and Tuppence are a little bit more restrained in their manner however which leads to a couple that I enjoy just as much as Nick and Nora but for different reasons.
They play off each other brilliantly and make up for what the other lacks in such a seamless way that I'm not even sure they truly recognize how perfect they are together.As you could tell from the synopsis, this is a collection of short stories that have two common threads running through them.
I do not normally like short story collections by mystery writers.
They seem to inevitably rely on a sudden twist ending and that is difficult thing to accomplish repeatedly in a collection of short stories while holding the readers interest or creating any real surprises.
I mean I fell in love with, "And Then There Were None", when I was young, but I have repeatedly read Christie since looking for that same magic and i have only become increasingly bored with Poirot and his little gray cells along with the constant fondling of his mustache and his smug and prissy mannerisms.
Agatha Christie's skill undoubtedly lies with the longer tale, where she can give her ingenuinity time to ripen and unfold and where the length of the narrative is such that the unlikelihood, the sheer weight of implausibility, is obscured in the telling.
Her married couple are ludicrously aping detectives of the past in a clear parallel to the Agatha Christie's own imitation of crime writiers of the past.
In my opinion if the manuscript had been sent to publishers with the name "Francis Baldrian" instead of "Agatha Christie", these stories would never have made it beyond the first editorial hurdle.
مجموعة من الالغاز والقضايا التي تتنوع بين القتل والسرقة والاختفاء،يقوم بمحاولة حلها الزوجين تومي وتوبنس،قد تجد بعضها سهل جدا في تخمين الحل والبعض الاخر اكثر تعقيدا.كتاب اخر ممتع لأجاثا كريستي.
In each chapter in this novel..Tommy and Tobins hero of the novel was live in a new adventure in "International Bureau of Investigation".. ^^Awesome novel.. ❤️‍
This is a cute collection of short stories tied loosely together by an spy arc. They also all feature Tommy and Tuppence solving their mysteries by employing the methods of various fictional detectives, including Christie's own Hercule Poirot.I enjoy Tommy and Tuppence as a couple and detectives, and I liked the "imitating fictional detectives" aspect of the stories, but none of the stories, save the last one really grabbed me. They were all enjoyable reads, though.
Kısa hikayeleri de çok iyi. Zaten bir kısmını bir Fare Kapanı’nda okumuştum. Her vakada ünlü dedektiflerin rollerini yapmaları, özellikle Poirot beni eğlendirdi. Agatha teyzemiz gözbebeğini yine bir nevi canlandırmış.
تومي وتوبنس بيرسفورد الزوجان المهووسان بالروايات البوليسية والعاشقان للتحدي والمغامرات تأتيهما الفرصة الذهبية لممارسة ما يحبانه عندما يطلب إليهما تولي وكالة بلانت الدولية للتحقيق ، فيسارعان لقبول العرض لتتوالى بعد ذلك القضايا الواحدة تلو الأخرى....الرواية عبارة عن قصص قصيرة على شكل قضايا بطلاها هما الزوجان بيرسفورد ،بعض القضايا وجدتها غاية في التشويق والبعض الآخر كان في نظري مملا و حله متوقعا منذ البداية...الرواية بشكل عام فكرتها جميلة وككل روايات أجاثا كريستي لا تخلو من الذكاء إضافة إلى المعلومات الجديدة المنثورة بشكل سلس هنا وهناك...
A fun series of vignettes as Tommy and Tuppence return to the pages of Agatha Christie.
Posing as private detectives (well, actually *a* private detective and his secretary--natch for the 1920s) in order to break up a Russian spy ring, T&T spend their time solving real cases.
I'm sure I'd have enjoyed it far more had I been familiar with the model detectives but other than the three I've listed, the rest are fairly obscure now.
I can see why Tommy and Tuppence are fan favourites with some.
And they actually *are* partners--Tuppence is treated by Tommy as an equal and she doesn't surrender to even the slightest hint of mollycoddling.
Agatha Christie's husband and wife sleuth team, Tommy and Tuppance, is back solving crimes in the late 1920s.
While there, they take a dozen or so cases showing off their skills and having madcap mysterious adventures along the way.The novel was reminiscent of ""The Big Four"", where an overarching frame allows a variety of short stories to be brought together.
This is my favorite appearance of T & T so far, although I am still looking forward to ""N or M?""Another interesting aspect of the novel is each short story is written in the style of a popular mystery writer of the day.
این کتاب دومین از مجموعه کتاب های تامی و تاپنس زوج ماجرجوست.
این زوج تنها کارآگاهان جوان و موفقی هستند که آگاتا کریستی خلق کرد و به همین خاطر داستان های شان از انرژی و تحرک بیشتری نسبت به داستان های خانم مارپل یا هرکول پوارو برخوردار است.
بنابرین روند داستان با حل جنایت های جزئی ادامه پیدا می کند تا در نهایت نوبت به مساله جاسوسی برسد و حل شود.من شخصا ان دسته از داستان های کریستی را که که کل کتاب هول یک مساله اصلی دنبال می شود بیشتر دوست دارم ولی این کتاب هم چندان بد نبود.
