Those whose only familiarity with Oz comes from the MGM film and/or the first Oz book (or even the "Wicked" series and Broadway show and the recent James Franco "Oz" movie) likely believe that the arch-enemy in the Oz series is the Wicked Witch of the West.
In this story, he is back again, this time as the title character, and Ruth Plumly Thompson has changed "Nome" to "Gnome".The Thompson stories of Oz follow a similar pattern.
If the Wicked Witch of the West ruled over the Winkies in the first book, then why does she keep referring to Winkie Land as being in the East?
I have a character named Plumly featured in future Ebooks of my children's fantasy series. I'm honoring Ruth Plumly Thompson, who carried on with the Oz books after L. Frank Baum's death. The Scraps storyline was excellent in this one.
An adequate if not a particularly great entry of the series. Much of the book is saved because the titular Gnome King is delightfully jerky.
Nowhere close to the charm, magic, and inventiveness of the originals. These books should not be considered Oz canon.
Ya know, cute and fun and fine. I'll keep reading them, but I'm a hair disillusioned on my memories of RPT.
