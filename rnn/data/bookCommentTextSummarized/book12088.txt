This was my first Robert Ludlum novel, not because it was his first but because both he and it were recommended by the owner of a used book store I once frequented.
Ludlum had evolved in the ten years between the two books.
But fair warning, also without action and without long-ranging, deep-reaching conspiracies.
This is the story of how the youngest son of an absurdly rich New York family came to be a high-ranking Nazi officer, and it follows his plan to infuse a Germany on verge of defeat with over a hundred million dollars in stolen money.
it was good but the economics bit went over my head by several milesi didn't quite expect mein fuhre
The book starts in Washington DC where Major Matthew Canfield is being sent to meet a high ranking German official with promises to divulge information to help end WWII.
Giovanni Scarlatti, a poor but ingenious Italian immigrant, marries a rich heiress, his employer's daughter, named Elizabeth who helps him take over her business in as well as many other companies to become extremely rich within a decade.
Ulster's plan to bankrupt his family and help Hitler's Third Reich is the plot which takes us, his mother and the book's hero, field accountant (not yet Major) Canfield, around the globe and into mysterious financial transactions.
The book is good. Robert Ludlum is easy to understand. I especially liked the character of the unconventional, strong, and daring Scarlatti matriarch. A very different heroine.
The Scarlatti Inheritance was recommended to be by a friend who told me that if I liked James Bond, I would like the Robert Ludlum series. The Scarlatti Inheritance tells a truely fascinating story of an American intelligence officer who is hired to determine the status of the Scarlatti fortunes and Ulster Scarlett while being financed by German Nazi's. Ludlum is a very gifted writer and has now become a favorite author that I count on for a fun filled adventure.
A Ludlum thriller, overflowing with elements encompassing Nazism, wealth, government intelligence, secrecy... At every junction death is lurking, mental confusion is paramount, suspense at the pinnacle... The reader is taken on an action filled, adventure riddled journey, and every word makes him only yearn for more.
I think every one of his novels that I've read have been spy thrillers, mostly set around World War II or the Cold War. There's plenty of mayhem, blood and gore, so if you're squeamish about that sort of thing, Ludlum is not for you.
One such man is a Scarlatti scion, and he's inherited millions, so he can fund a lot.The main character in this book is Matthew Canfield, a US government field accountant who investigates shady financial dealings of the ultra rich.
Elizabeth Scarlatti has learned that her son, the black sheep of the family, has stolen these securities from his own family.
It's the fictional account of the son of an Italian immigrant and his quest for power.
The book begins with the basic premise that Ulster Scarlett has taken the nom de guerre of Heinrich Kroeger and is an important part of Nazi Germany and Hitler's rise to power.I did read this book back in the early 1980's for a junior high school book report and just wanted to re-read it.
The closest he came to Ian Fleming was the Bourne Trilogy and even then it was a stretch to compare the two authors.
Fleming's Bond still had more emphasis on tech than Ludlum's Bourne.
Typically Ludlum, what you expectFast paced, with enough details to keep your interest. Good story with an evil protagonist central to the plot and an unlikely hero in over his head, with a sprinkling of sex.
I am am old Ludlum fan and this book was fast paced, had the twists and the compulsory Ludlum style ending (which fir once I would like to end in an unpredictable manner). A decent read.
The discussion entails the probability of the defection of Heinrich Kroger and the release of an ultra-secret document (only possible with the permission of the President of USA) demanded by Matthew Canfield (who happens to be the hero) along with the mention of a certain “April Red”.The story then goes back 52 years into the early 1890s following the establishment of the Scarlatti industries by Giovanni and Elizabeth Scarlatti and the transformation of the industries into an empire almost controlling the market.
At the time of the First World War, all the three sons entered into the army.On returning from the army, Ulster begins to plot a devious plan (under the name Heinrich Kroger), a plan which involves the funnelling of funds into the Nazi Third Reich party.

The first novel written by the late Robert Ludlum, "The Scarlatti Inheritance" is about as classic a cat-and-mouse global thriller can be, from its World War settings, to secret identities, financial machinations, and other grand subterfuge.
Any concerns I may have had about Ludlum's work being too layered and unnecessarily complex were put to rest, thankfully, as well.I am a fan of historical fiction, and this book employs it nicely.
By weaving in the Scarlatti/Scarlett family into the setting between World Wars and also developing them as a family who is self-made, "old money" once they settle into New York City, the scene is set for so much intrigue.
This is a mildly interesting book about an evil man who is attracted to an evil empire, and the mother who recognizes his evil and sets out to stop him. I give this only a 5 on my scale of 1 to 10. I may read some more of his books to see if they get any better. After all, I saw all 3 of the Jason Bourne movies and thought they were great.
I did not enjoy this book that much. It was such a slow read in the beginning that had me putting the book down for days at a time. I felt like trudging through mud at stages. The ending came quite quick and did not feel rounded off and the relationship with the son had an entry and end but no other info for in between. A bit disappointed.
Great WW2 story, intriguing and folded around basic Nazi facts... there's a dramatic ELITIST BOARD MEETING in the guts of this book that perfectly shows the sheer amorality of the Money Game and how devoid of the natural empathies these fucking banking bastards are; these monsters' motivations laid bare.Superbly depicted, Robert Ludlum, you are the master.
I got my hand on the orginal 1st edition, 1st book of Robert Ludlum....I read it about 30 years ago...I hardly remember it and after my last book I was ready to read a good one....I still enjoyed it 30 years later and am glad I re-read it, it was like reading it for the first time the twists and turns were great
Entertaining thriller. Some of the twists and turns were a bit hard to digest and some of the writing seems a bit rough, but I was entertained enough that I'll read some more Ludlum in the future, I think.
Not bad. Some of the writing is quite a bit stale for my tastes and the dialogue is just not believable at times. (Shag it all, confound you, confound it all) Nobody talks like that ever. The plot is good-just rough around the edges.
Enjoyable. Good to read a story without the technology we have today
Engrossing and intriguing.
Quite a good read. Bit naive on the financial issues but not a waste of time.
Impressive book. I wish I could write as well as Ludlum!
La situazione è un po' migliorata con l'avvicinarsi al finale.Per carità, c'è l'intrigo internazionale, c'è una specie di genio del crimine (anche se i suoi suppoters sono convinti che sia solo uno stupido fanatico) e la figura della signora Scarlatti (pardon, madame) mi è piaciuta davvero molto, ma manca completamente la tensione nel raccontare i fatti (considerando che si tratta di spionaggio).Forse, anzi, sicuramente il problema sono io, ma non sono riuscita ad appassionarmi alla vicenda; il racconto procede in maniera un po' piatta e sale un poco la suspance solo per brevissimi momenti (poi torna il piattume).Qualche passaggio della vicenda poi mi è apparso un po' troppo surreale.(view spoiler)[Complimenti al prezzolato gigante che resiste a ben tre pallottole, di cui una al fianco, e trova ancora la forza di sollevare pesi, scagliarli con irruenza, lottare e scappare via.
There were a lot of very similar characters in this book and I found it difficult to keep them straight.
One of the main characters was alternately referred to by his name or as "the field accountant", sometimes in the same sentence.
That didn't seem to have any purpose.
At one point he was talking to someone and in the very next paragraph he was talking to a different character in a completely different location with no segue.
The big meeting at the end dragged on and was a big yawn.
I think I still want to read The Bourne Identity, but I'm getting it from the library.
The only Ludlum books I have read are the Bourne series, and it's been well over 20 years.
I recently thought I'd start at the beginning of his catalogue and read through all his books (I've slowly been doing this with a handful of authors).
This book was okay.
You can definitely see the beginnings of his style.
I've definitely felt the first books of other writers were a lot better.
Some transitions felt awkward.
It was a quick read.
Still, it will be fun to watch his journey as an author as I make my way through his catalogue.
A good thriller based on high finance greed and a mentally unstable hero who becomes a Nazi sympathiser and is ultimately sacrificed by those he sought to support. Some parts a quite difficult to follow the story line but it panned out by the end. Not a thriller that has particular merit but enjoyable enough.
As a huge Ludlum fan, this one is inferior to many of his other books. The plot line is interesting, and the last hundred pages were page turners. However, much of the story is based on the world of finance, which I had difficulty following at times (and have zero interest in). Some of the dialogue is awkward and unrealistic. But the ending is satisfying. 3.5 stars.
CC1The book was written 30 yrs. ago. It still relevant to the times .Excellent read great plot and I'm sure some truth to story. Robert Ludlum has to be one of the great authors of all time. I have enjoyed reading everything he has written . As always excellent job!!!! Carl Clause
Отличный триллер. Классика жанра. Потрясающий дебют молодого писателя. Захватывающий сюжет и очень легко читается. Постоянно держит читателя в напряжении. Хочется быстрее добраться до следующих произведений Ладлэма.
