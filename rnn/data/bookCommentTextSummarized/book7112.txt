I loved this book. But then again I read it in Verona Porta Nuova station after visiting Venice, waiting for a night train to Paris, in the rain, and I think this may well be the best book to read in Verona Porta Nuova station after visiting Venice, waiting for a night train to Paris, in the rain.
Although this novel is a lesser work, there are moments of tenderness, poignancy and power crafted in his trademark miminalist style that linger.
The novel concerns a retired Army Colonel, who has fought in brutal combat, near the end of his life and is desperately in love with a much younger woman.
The Colonel looks backward in the novel to the horror and futility of war, which serves as a contrast to the extreme tenderness of his last love affair in Venice.
If you admire and have widely read Hemingway already, then this is a very fine but not great novel relative to his masterpieces.
I know Hemingway is not for everyone, but I like his writing style.
I don't read his books for plot; I read them for the lines, for his ability to express complicated things simply and for his ability to capture the inherent differences between the sexes.
There are two principle characters in this novel - Colonel Richard Cantwell and his lover Renata.
Hemingway expresses so simply what is before our eyes and that which we often don't see.
And there is humor.Either you like Hemingway or you don't.
I certainly do NOT like all his books.
Un vecchio di cinquant'anniQuesto libro, scritto da Hemingway a distanza di dieci anni da "Per chi suona la campana" e venti da "Addio alle armi", è ambientato in una Venezia invernale.Racconta una storia d'amore fra un colonnello cinquantenne, di precaria salute, e una diciannovenne ricchissima e molto aristocratica, "splendente di giovinezza e di slanciata bellezza".E' interessante sapere che il colonnello ha la stessa età dell'autore al momento della stesura dell'opera.
La vicenda qui rappresentata può pertanto essere definita un amore senile di un vecchio di cinquant'anni, gran bevitore a qualunque ora del giorno e della notte.
La condizione esistenziale del protagonista è caratterizzata anche da un ambiguo rapporto con se stesso : " 'Vecchio bastardo' disse allo specchio.
Is it possible to love a book just for the atmosphere it creates, the pictures you get when reading it? Certainly. There was, and still is, a lot of pressure and expectations to any Hemmingway novel. True, some are better ones and some are not quite up to the standard you would wish for from such an acclaimed author. But, who am I to judge how an authors life should be allowed to influence his works. In “Across the River and into the Trees” Hemmingway hits a remarkably melancholic tone, a tone I
The scenery is alike, death is at hand and you think of your life, the one you always wished you had lived and the one it turned out to be, and it is much too late to change anything.Past loves, passed pastimes, wars you fought in, friends you used to have, some gone, some just so far away, all are memories, some clear, some shadows, but memories are all they are.You want to relive it all and the heavy low hanging mist is not only obscuring your vision of the ducks you are hunting, it blocks the mirror you are trying to see your life through.I love the book for this reason, I can physically feel the mist cover everything, I can feel the pain of the colonel and I can feel Venice in the misty morning.
Haunting - old warriors who try to capture the youth they sacrificed to war - one of my favorite works of Hemingway.
La contaminación lumínica, acústica y la depresión, combinadas con un aparato llamado televisor que rezuma basura hasta altas horas de la madrugada, pueden convertir las aparentemente inofensivas noches en una oportunidad para hacerse adicto a la compra de batamantas y chorrimangueras, a las predicciones del tarot, o incluso a programas de música que no es música.Usted tiene miedo.
¡La dormidina y el ambiatol nada tienen que hacer ante un par de páginas de Al otro lado del río y entre los árboles, amigos!
sin amilanarse ante nada.Tan sólo tiene usted que proveerse de un ejemplar de este libro (da igual que sea de Planeta o genérico, lo importante es el principio activo) tumbarse en la cama y esforzarse en la lectura de tres o cuatro páginas.
'What did you do in the war, Daddy?''I was a pervy old man who wanted to sleep with young girls.'I suppose if I were a man having a midlife crisis, I might have enjoyed this book.
Jeremy Clarkson, perhaps?It's after the war.
An American soldier in his fifties checks in to a hotel in Venice.
He goes out to dinner with a nineteen-year-old girl.
He checks out of the hotel.
Oh, yes, and he keeps banging on about the war and she keeps acting as though she is interested in hearing about it.
I'm much too old to tolerate this kind of stuff.
This novel didn’t have 50 pages worth reading.You are my one and last and true love, and I love you truly.
It’s no longer layering and searching for a genuine or “true” effect; now it’s the meat of the story.
And yes, true and truly are used obsessively.The last page is probably the worst one.
It’s a style that has given up its search for a subject.
It’s Hemingway at the height of self-parody mode.I’m not sure there’s a high school senior in America who could read A Clean and Well-Lighted Place and not then write a chapter of Across the River and Through the Trees better than Hemingway did.
Yup, it’s that bad.
the worst hemingway i have ever read.
No caso deste livro, quer apenas dizer que isto não é o melhor que Hemingway tem para nos oferecer.
Se, por azar, alguém um dia decidir enveredar pelo autor tendo como ponto de partida Na Outra Margem, Entre as Árvores, estou certo de que nunca mais o quererá ler na vida.Agora, para um «cliente da casa», como é o caso, a análise é outra.
Esse é o impacto normal que Hemingway tem em mim, e isso foi coisa que não aconteceu com este livro.
E é também por isso que te leio e perdoo os dias e os livros menos bons.
It is the book’s locale—or “terrain,” in Hemingway parlance—which is so appealing. I’m talking about Venice, the Gritti Palace Hotel, and Harry’s Bar. In Across the River, Hemingway described these places referentially. As a backdrop, they are wonderful. The problem is the novel itself…the narration, the dialogue, and the story, such as it is. Across the River is Hemingway’s response to World War II and to where he found himself, half a century old, in the war’s aftermath.Source: http://takimag.com/article/across_the...
But I found more to this book within the context of what I've come to know about Hemingway, which is just enough to be a danger to my own integrity.By 1950, at the time of Across the River's publication, Hemingway had lived a hard life.
Cantwell's feelings comprise the central message of this book and they had to be addressed by Hemingway.
In The Old Man and the Sea, Hemingway kept and built upon the truths concerning the decay of his body and his usefulness, but he avoided the need for prolonged dialogue about the emotions that such realities instill.

There's something about this book.
But there's still a lot of "stuff" in this book.
Aside from the obvious portraits of May/December romance, a man's dying days, and the regretful memories of World War II, the thing that rose to me most out of this story is how people become their best selves around those they love.
The protagonist, a self-professed "rough" man, continually strives toward his gentler side in his relationship with the young Italian woman.
Granted, the constant barrage of "I love yous" gets old fast, but there's a point to them, and, in the end, it's one of the most beautiful points I've ever seen made in a Hemingway novel.

My Top 5 Hemingway BooksOffers a wonderful portrayal of post-War Venice as a place of thriving life and a symbol of death. Also, one of Hemingway's most delicate love stories. Also: sex on a moving gondola!
اولین اثری که از همینگوی خواندم.داستان مردی که اکنون که صفحه های اخر عمرش را ورق میزند عشق را یافته..اما تسلیم پایانی اجتناب ناپذیر است..فضا سازی بسیار عالی,و متن غنی..که نشانه تسلط نویسنده و زندگی سرشاری است که همینگوی پشت سر گذارده..اخرین اثر همینگوی..دوسال قبل از خودکشی او..
O Hemingway está claramente muito – demasiado – relacionado com o conflito para escrever algo que não seja realista, técnico, melindroso e, desde modo, por vezes fastidioso, em relação à dita cuja.A partir de certo momento o romance tornou-se um longo monólogo do coronel quanto aos episódios da guerra.
Compreendo as nuances do seu pensamento, o quanto luta por ser cordial quando, na sua natureza e na sua experiência, apenas adquiriu hábitos de brusquidão e aspereza.O ponto alto do livro foi, para mim, um ou dois parágrafos (máximo) em que o coronel finalmente conta dois pormenores, dois episódios, humanos sobre a guerra.
Hemingway penned this book in his usual minimalist style ……and it was panned by the critics and readers alike upon its initial release.
Heck, Dark Arena was more Hemingway than this one.
There should have been more war related scenes and their absence was conspicuous, because the few that were there were haunting.But the book did manage to portray a wounded soul, or rather souls, if you want to include the girl, even if the girl’s reasons and back story were missing.
Através do seu mundo interior ficamos a conhecer as emoções provocadas pela experiência da guerra e os seus efeitos no indivíduo.
Há uma tensão permanente entre o mundo exterior ( o da experiência de guerra) e o mundo interior ( o das memórias, que procura compreender a experiência vivida e apaziguar os traumas provocados pela mesma).
Ao colocar o personagem principal a recordar, Hemingway imprime nele uma certa sensação de solidão.
O escritor privilegia o momento em que o indivíduo é obrigado a enfrentar o seu passado, os seus demónios e consequências.
Hemingway confunde o leitor.Este livro é sobre os traumas de guerra.

Probably Hemingways's weakest novel.
Cantwell is a WWII veteran who, knowing that he has not long left to live, has made his peace with the world and tries to enjoy every one of the small things that each passing day brings.
He is fortunate to be loved by the beautiful, and much younger, Renata, which he does not question, although he does not know why she has fallen for him.
He always reminds her of how beautiful she is, and that he loves her, although she claims not to understand what this means.
To a generation haunted by war, Hemingway created a colonel who bragged of killing 122.
To a culture grappling with the experiences of blacks and Jews, he name checked a confederate general and forgot one of the most significant reasons World War II was fought.
It was one of those epic failures that scar a career, the literary equivalent of Bob Dylan’s Self Portrait or Lauryn Hill’s Unplugged, something so bad it changed the perception of artist work for the rest of his career.Even with The Old Man and The Sea, a novella IMO as good as anyone has ever written, Hemingway never regained the place in the public’s consciousness.
I read most of this fictional story about an American colonel in Venice shortly after WWII, but after a time the dialog was too boring, so I decided to read the last two pages and put it down. As it turned out upon reading the end, the story concluded on a very predictable path.I would not say that this was one of Hemingway's better novels. By the way, this book was published in 1950, not in 1920 as is shown on the goodreads resource site.
كتابي ال (26) لعام 2018.الحب لا يعرف صغيراً أو كبيراً... هكذا يقولون، وهنا هذا ما حدث بالضبط: الكولونيل البالغ من العمر واحد وخمسون عاماً يقع في حب فتاة أصغر منه بأكثر من ثلاثين سنة ليعيشا قصة غرام هادئة قصيرة على مدى 335 صفحة.لم أحب الكتاب أبداً، وكانت تجربتي الأولى مع أرنست همنغواي مخيبة الآمال فكل ما كتبه عبارة عن يوميات مفصلة ومملة لحياة الكولونيل على مدى عدة أيام.التقييم:🌟 نجمة واحدة.
The story itself centers around an old soldier named Richard Cantwell right after (or possibly during) the capitulation of Germany near the end of World War II.
This visit, however, does not revolve around military matters as Richard is only in town to spend the weekend with a young Italian girl who he’s fallen in love with.
His excessive bravado and bogus machismo are enough to make me puke after a few sentences, and it is very difficult to believe that Renata, his girl, could possibly stand to listen to him blather about old war stories for longer than a minute, much less have feelings of love for him.
"-¿Qué les ocurre a las personas que se quieren? -Supongo que tienen lo que sea que tengan, y son más afortunadas que los demás. Luego uno de ellos se queda vacía para siempre."
Philip Rahv, the America critic and essayist, noted in his 1950 review of Across the River and Into the Trees:The first thing to be said about this novel is that it is so egregiously bad as to render all comment on it positively embarrassing to anyone who esteems Hemingway as one of the more considerable prose-artists of our time and as the author of some of the finest short stories in the language.
In Across the River and Into the Trees where death is with the reader from the very first pages, Hemingway, speaking through Richard Cantwell, provides some reflections on his own familiarity with the dominance of decay:Death is a lot of shit, he thought.
