This is the copy I still own, now shelved next to Diana Hacker's Writers Reference, Strunk and White's Elements of Style, and the teacher's edition Bedford Guide - and others.
Of these, Warriner gives the firmest grounding in syntax, with explanations behind the rules.
At one point I had a complete set of the individual books for each grade level.
These offered even greater depth of understanding, a guide to exploring the great puzzle of language.
Studying these finer points of English in middle school was a great benefit when faced with Linguistics in college, and made it easier for me to grasp other languages.
This was the grammar and composition guide utilized at Maine Township High School South in Park Ridge, Illinois during my four years there. It was the first such reference book I'd ever read and it was of vital importance in helping me prepare for college by writing formal research papers while in secondary school. It's also noteworthy as being a sturdy little thing, looking and feeling about the same now as it did, lo, those many years ago.
A torture chamber for young students of the native tongue. I remember trying to understand it back in prep school freshman English. I suppose it did me some good. Not quite the correct edition we used. Ours was ten years earlier. Date read is approximate.
I will have to admit this book is excellent in its precision of explanation. Like other reviewers I have read on this book it sits by me when ever I am writing or typing. It is a must have for every home. There are other books in this series design for earlier grades.
1958 version suggested on OILF as a good grammar series (separate textbooks each year) for grades 7 - 12. Comments here: http://oilf.blogspot.com/2016/04/clas...
awsome
Essential.
Need to compare this to my Harbrace. I still pull that out, but the kids need their own copy for reference.
