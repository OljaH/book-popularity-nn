In the meantime I also picked up this little book, Metaphysical Meditations, one of many texts written by the prolific Paramahansa Yogananda, and pushed it to the front of my to-read queue.
It's a useful little book filled with meditations to help focus one's thoughts and clear the mind, some very beautifully written, with lines like "Mother Divine, draw aside Thy glittering veil of cosmic motion pictures .
In a way, perhaps George (himself a Westerner, with his influence as a Beatle) made these Eastern thoughts accessible to an even greater number than Yogananda and helped expand the consciousness of millions.
I was looking through this for something specific, and then realized I'd never actually read it all the way through, small though it is. So I did. It's really a lovely little book to carry around in your pocket and dip into throughout the day for a reminder of God. Sort of a miniature Whispers From Eternity. Mostly bite-sized prayers and affirmations, with some slightly longer passages that could work as guided meditations.
Excellent.Very good book! I plan to read it again and again. The visions brought on from reading this book are of peace and love.
a good guide into deeper meditation
This is a book that will stay by my bed. It is not something you read through and then are done.
A good daily reader
awesome
Nice collection of soothing meditations that can help calm your thought-process during stressful times.
Always referring back to this for affirmations in all areas of life.
