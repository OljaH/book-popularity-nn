This novel also depicts a young woman in the present day who struggles with her relationship with a married man and her job at a newspaper, which she is at risk of losing.I got a little lost in this novel, not because it was confusing, but because the voice changed throughout.
I really enjoyed the story of Jennifer Stirling, and I think that particular storyline could have been a good book all on its own.
The voice of the book changed dramatically when we got to Ellie's story.
But someone, years later, will take up the cold trail of Jennifer's fate, and follow it faithfully until she knows what has happened to Jennifer.I thought that Jennifer would have to be devious to cheat on her husband.
What is great is that never is it told outright that Jennifer and her lover are soulmates.But Jennifer's husband is a male chauvinistic pig, who doesn't even care to strike a friendship with his wife.
But Anthony O'Hare, Jennifer's lover, is a very sensitive guy.
I'm not a gal, yet the book made me understand Jennifer's plight.
Maybe that's why I like the book so much.
4.5 stars Jojo Moyes knows how to tell a compelling story! This was a very romantic double love story that centered around secret hand written love letters. The first two-thirds of the book was Jennifer Stirling's story taking place in the early 1960's. I'm not sure why I always think I'm not going to like a historical romance, because so far I have loved the ones I've read. This was my favorite part of the book. I felt that Ms. Moyes did a beautiful job of painting a picture of this period of t
I'm not sure why I always think I'm not going to like a historical romance, because so far I have loved the ones I've read.
The last third of the book moves forward in time to 2003, where Ellie Haworth finds some of these love letters, and they inspire her to make decisions about her own story.
I ended up liking the format of the book when I reached the end, if anyone is going to be a sucker for an epic love story it'll be me.
I was very engaged with Jennifer's story, desperate to know what happened with her, so the time jump tested my patience.
I wonder if the 400-page book could have simply started in the middle and been a lot better.Why did the first half put me off?
The characters struck me as fairly cliche and flat, and I could not figure out why either of the lovers engendered passion in the other.
(I kept envisioning her as Grace Kelly or the character January Jones portrayed in "Mad Men.") On the other, you have Anthony, a passionate, adventure-seeking international journalist.
I just don't get it.The characters do not improve that much in the second half, though Jennifer seems to have acquired some wisdom and an internal dignity rather than just elegantly refined social graces.
Una historia sin duda cautivadora!!!
Es lo primero que leo de esta escritora y me ha conquistado en mayúsculas.
Un relato exquisito.
Una pluma suave y delicada.
Y dos historias de amor a cuál más dura y tierna a la vez.
Sin embargo, no he podido darle las cinco estrellas, porque en cada capítulo me perdía y no sabía si estaba en el antes o en el antes del accidente.
Pero sí quiero remarcar que las cartas de amor son...
y más después de haber leído el final de la novela: cuando sabes que realmente alguien escribió esas cartas.
3 stars I had a really hard time getting into this.
The multiple povs, the story was all over the place in part 1 and was too confusing for me.
Also I didnt like present day heroine, Ellie and felt like the author could have left her story out.
It was a forbidden romance with a lot of missed opportunities and I started to get into the story more by part 2 but by part 3 I felt exhausted.
There was some good plot twist but by the end it didnt leave me satisfied.
Im glad I picked it up though as
3 stars

I tried to like it -- I really tried -- but honestly, it's got to be the least satisfying book I've read this year.The first section occurs in 1960, and it's dreadful.
The plot is thin and predictable, the characters melodramatic, one-dimensional and stereotypical.
The writing is terrible; not only is it over-the-top, but several times I had to re-read sentences to try to figure out what the author was trying to say (never a good sign).
The writing is less stilted and the characters better fleshed out.

This book deserves a better title. Wonderful writing and an intriguing storyline (with a kick-ass twist at the end!).
The two I’ve read were love stories at their core.
Jennifer Stirling is hospitalized, suffering from memory loss due to a severe car accident.
Then she finds a letter with an impassioned plea for her to chuck her life and meet said composer at the train station.
Who is this man and why would Jennifer consider giving up her privileged life to follow him?
The Last Letter From Your Lover evoked feelings of sadness, both hopefulness and hopelessness, nostalgia and a yearning hunger for a love letter of my own.
Aptly titled, I loved it.
I was so used to her taking on a timely topic....assisted suicide in "Me Before You:, the theft of art etc by the Nazi's in "The Girl You Left Behind" and I thought, eh, just a light love story.
Was it maybe the "last letter from your lover?" What are we missing today?
Moyes creates some similarities between Jennifer and Ellie, both loving men that are forbidden...and that bond makes the transition between both stories, past and present work.
For the fact that this "love" story left me thinking about so much more, I move the rating to 4 stars.
[2.5 Stars]
What a disappointment. This book was boring and filled with one-dimensional characters. I'm shocked that this is by the same author who wrote "Me Before You" which is one of my favorite books of all time.
When I started reading this book, I immediately got mildly irritated with all the chick-lit clichés that the first chapter had, and I thought to myself that this was going to be another one of those chick-lit books that are very relaxing to read, but that I've slowly gotten tired of over the years.
Then I turned the page, the second chapter started and I was immediately grabbed by the turn in both the story and its vibe.
This was a completely different story, and as I kept on reading, I got more and more emotionally captivated and had a hard time putting down the book.
Although she can't recall the relationship, it was obviously passionate, intense and something for which she would jeopardise her life as she knew it.
A features writer with a prominent British newspaper, Ellie's career is flailing as she spends most of her time preoccupied with her lover and their relationship.
In the newspaper's library archives, she stumbles across a letter in a file, seemingly unconnected to her task at hand.
Ellie embarks on a quest for this mysterious 'B' and the unknown recipient of the letter.
The fate of lovers of forty years ago speak across the decades in Ellie's mind and run a parallel to her own esoteric relationship.
Adding to the confusion is that every time it would switch between the years, the chapter would often start out featuring a different character you hadn't met before (like the secretary, or the lover the first time, or the lover's boss).
I actually like the idea of someone finding 40 year old love letters and trying to solve the mystery of who they were to/from, and what happened to them.
Instead, we have a mystery within a mystery, as our heroine has amnesia for every other story for the first half of the book, and then the modern-day heroine trying to solve a second mystery 40 years later involving our first mystery lead characters.
http://www.whorublog.com/?p=2847Jojo Moyes once again proves that neither time nor distance can put out the flames of true love, love that doesn't just connect bodies, but souls.
Having read ME BEFORE YOU, HONEYMOON IN PARIS, THE GIRL YOU LEFT BEHIND and now THE LAST LETTER FROM YOUR LOVER, I see the connections between themes she explores in her novels, and even the characters.
At the same time, her novels remind us that we're fragile beings, and even though we have only one life to live, what we do, what we create can be a major part of the future.
Jojo Moyes most definitely leaves a mark, one that will be read and seen for generations to come!
Lloro de emoción... M A R A V I L L O S A. ❤¡Qué placer leer a Jojo Moyes!
The book begins in 1960s London.
Thirty-two-year-old Ellie is forging a love affair of her own.
Her lover, John, is married with two young children and in no hurry to leave his wife.
Wrapped up in John, forgetting her own life, including her career as a journalist, Ellie doesn't see what's right in front of her, until she stumbles on a letter, the letter of the title: a handwritten love letter spanning decades.
Obsessed with what she reads and what it means, Ellie seeks to find out more about a story that's perversely right in front of her.
كتاب بايد تو همون بخش دوم تموم ميشد، بقيه ش واقعا خسته كننده بود🤦🏻♀
كتاب بايد تو همون بخش دوم تموم ميشد، بقيه ش واقعا خسته كننده بود🤦🏻‍♀️
A delicious read!Started this book yesterday & couldn't put it down until I finished today.Tragic & so sad, and yet hopeful...One of my favourite parts was in a letter where Anthony writes, "...to have someone out there who understands you, who desires you, who sees you as a better version of yourself, is the most astonishing gift.
But even the chance to think upon your beautiful face, your smile, and know that some part of it might belong to me is probably the single greatest thing that has happened in my life."Or another great part of a letter, "...know this at least: that somewhere in this world is a man who loves you, who understands how precious and kind and clever you are.
Nothing like a little historical hindsight to make the informed reader prick up her ears (although, I wonder, what of the generation that never had to worry about asbestos removal?) So OK, this novel was going to have a certain historical dimension, and being set in the early 60s it had that whole Mad Men double standard going—wives were expected to be decorative, good at housekeeping, eager to produce children and, above all, faithful, while men—well, if a man was playing the field, it was his wife’s fault for not keeping him interested.
Ok, I have to admit, I liked this book. Definitely chick lit. At times it was very reminiscent of Letters to Juliet and felt like I was reading that story. It did have a love story within a love story. As well as a 40 year gap in one of them. I might have shed a tear even. I've officially been baptized into Moyes' works and now look feverishly to her other stories!
I do not generally read romances but Jojo Moyes manages to write her romance with a bit more substance than most including a catchy story and reasonably realistic characters. This book also has the advantage of being set back a little in the past and the descriptions of relationships and attitudes of the sixties were very true. It was certainly a page turner for me and I especially liked the happy ending. No problem giving it four stars!
یه هزارتوی عاشقانه ی تراژیک و یه شخصیت پردازیِ یونیک! ... با اینکه یکی دو ماه پیش تمومش کردم هنوز با آنتونی اوهرم و جنیفر استرلینگ و نامه هاشون، اآلی و جان و لورانس و بقیه درگیرم ... هنوز تو روزگارشون زندگی می کنم ... :) یکی از بهترین هایی که تجربه کردم ...
In trying to reconnect to her former life Jennifer searches among her belongings and finds a love letter to her simply signed by "B".
Ellie Hawort, a young journalist, finds Jennifer's letters, some forty years later, and sets out on learning how this love affair played out.
She does not remember her name, husband or life at all.
As she is trying to piece back her life together, she comes across a love letter from a man who simply signs it as "B".
I still love Jojo Moyes and by no means do I regret picking this title.
She finds some hidden passionate letters, signed only with a B, and tries to piece together her secret life.
Ellie investigates what happened to Jennifer and her lover, and also has to make some difficult personal decisions.In addition to passion, the story also showed the problems that an affair can bring--a devastated spouse and hurt children.
Historically, the book also illustrated the difference in communication from the wonderful 1963 love letters to the quick 2003 text messages.
I've read two other books by Jojo Moyes, and found she was an engaging storyteller again.
This is another of Jojo Moyes wonderful stories, this one centering on Jennifer Stirling who wakes up in a hospital in 1960 not knowing who she is or where she is.
Searching around the house in hopes of discovering who she is, she discovers letters secreted in hiding places, love letters written so lovingly, from "B." But who is "B?"The story then goes to Ellie Haworth, in 2003, a journalist who is in a dead-end relationship with a married man.
Ellie discovers a love letter in a dusty pile of papers from the newspaper library, with such heartbreaking writing that she determines to find the lovers behind the love letter.
I've never been big on the chick-lit, romance type stuff, but this one grabbed me unexpectedly. It's such a sweet story that travels across time and weaves two stories together so seamlessly. I really loved the characters and the quest to solve the mystery of the letters, and it was just such an unexpected delight.This book is what made me fall in love with Jojo Moyes and led me to her other work, like Me Before You, so I'm really glad I decided to pick it up. Totally underrated, compared to her other work, and I highly recommend it.
Cautivada por Jojo Moyes. Qué historia... preciosa, conmovedora, complicada, intensa... me ha encantado. Y eso que al principio el estilo narrativo me resultó un poco enrevesado, más complejo que sus otras novelas, pero enseguida me enganché a la historia y la he disfrutado muchísimo.La recomiendo totalmente.
