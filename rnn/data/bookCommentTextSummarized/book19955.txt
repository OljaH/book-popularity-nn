I HATE THE BITCH SO MUCH THAT I DO NOT KNOW HOW TO EXPRESS IT AND THIS BOOK SUCKED ASS.Now I don't normally like to write negative reviews but this piece of shit deserves to be cut up and burned and I will express my anger at wasting my time and money on this book through this review.First off, the stupid bitch blushed WAY to much.
I want Keira to be murdered in the most gruesome way possible because she, like this whole book, is a piece of shit.
Is it possible to have a hesitant relationship with a love or hate book?
Parts of this book were enjoyable for me, while many others were "I want to choke a bitch right now" moments.
Both books have a male lead who is a lady- killer, able to bag any woman he wants, and often does.
I just want to bitch about Kiera's insensitivity.
After all, cheating is the cool thing to do, right?If Kiera had figured out her shit earlier in the game, I would have enthusiastically given this book at least 3 stars.
This the single most outrageous book I have ever read in my life.
This book takes the concept of Too Stupid To Live to a whole new level.
I really don't think I've felt so strongly about a literary character EVER in my life.
I wanted to murder the book.
Actually: Kiera, the only thing you deserve is to die, really.I cringed so many times.
If you want to know EXACTLY what never to do in a relationship, read this little 1000 page tome.
The story was over by the time I was 20% in.
But no I am a bad person for wanting to try the lollipop.
I am such a bad person, I am hurting both the lollipop and the ice-cream but I am so indecisive I know I will never be able to pick one.
Oh ice-cream I love you, you'll never know about my secret desires to try something else.But while licking the ice-cream, I still keep thinking about the tasty lollipop.
(hide spoiler)]PS: When a character in a book does one certain action over 150 times (in just one book!!!), that is called bad writing ;)I'm guessing the author couldn't think of any other reaction for Kiera to have on absolutely everything except for her to blush.Little diversity could've been nice.
Denny, the ever faithful and blissfully unawares boyfriend:And Kellan, the douchebag musician: I'm not sure what the hell was going on with those guys.
(view spoiler)[ Denny still keeps in touch with her even though she repeatedly cheated on him and led a double life with Kellan.
Seriously, the bitch should have ended up alone at the end.
This shit just does not happen.
(hide spoiler)] I just can't with this book.And you mean to tell me that her story continues on in further books?
Hmmm, shall I continue on to find out what happens to our lovely heroine?["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>
there is SO much romantic tension in this book, its enough to drive you insane - but totally in a good way!This book will make you want to throw your book at the wall, it'll make you laugh out loud, it'll make you swoon and grin for pages on end, it'll make you feel like your heart is ripped out, and you'll love every minute of it!Kellan is one of THOSE guys - you know the ones that make you swoony and drooly and make you wish he was real??
And I miss you, every day,” he whispered.” oh and for those, who like me, won't read a book unless they know this in advance, it has a delightfully happy ending :) Here’s how I see Kellan & Keira - both the casting pics above and the pic below.
I really enjoyed this book, but I have to say, Kiera was driving me seriously insane by the 75% mark. :)
The story took a little bit for me to get into; the writing was extremely (at times, overly) descriptive, more so at the start of book, and I initially found it quite distracting.
However, once I got into reading—I was hooked!Thoughtless is mainly focused on an intense love triangle and all the passion, jealousy, lies, and betrayal that come along with it.
(I also feel that just because I don't admire the behavior of character(s), doesn't mean I have to like the book any less.)What I absolutely loved most about this book was how passionately detailed all of the intense scenes were...And so I became to love the author for her extreme descriptions!
Kellaaaaaaan.....Kellaaaaan....I know he'd choose me over Kiera.
What rock star did she study to write this character?
Can I get a piece of him?
Creating a realistic character is not easy.
So many books are filled with stiff dialogue and cardboard characters.
With that said....Kellaaaaaan.....Kellaaaaan....Sorry, sorry.
Okay, one more time....Kellaaaaaan!Good stories are supposed to torment you.
The entire time I was reading this, I felt like someone was stuffing me full of tapioca.
(I cannot believe they did that with Denny in the next room!)I kind of want a piece of Griffin.
Anyway, Kellan Kyle, if you're reading this; CALL ME!
I will offer one piece of advise for those planning on reading this, before I spoiler tag this review: If you don't like cheating in your romance...Put the book down and follow Captain JackMajor Spoilers ahead, you have been warned.
(view spoiler)[I often get asked why I didn't like this book, which I read more than a year ago.
distaste for everything and everyone in the story - except Denny.
I mean COME ON!Kiera and Denny.Oh. My.
I wanted Kiera to end up alone after tripping over and falling into a vat of acid!
I didn't even want to waste my time and energy searching for gifs to express how disgusted I am with this book.What the fuck???The heroine is a SELFISH WHORE!!!!!I try my best to be nonviolent but if I saw her I would knee her in her vagina!The way she dragged her boyfriend through the mud, whining and complaining while he tried to freakin work at a career MEANWHILE she's fucking his best friend and their (her and her boyfriend's) roommate.I hate cheaters!I've cheated in my lifetime, in high school and once during my early twenties.
I didn' write that, mommy.""Okay." I BLUSHED.
⭐⭐⭐⭐ ! Rare epic. Major mind fuck. Addicting, spell binding, compelling. New girl Kiera is torn between loyal boyfriend Denny and sexy, local rock star Kellan Kyle.I’ve been waiting my whole life for this book. “Thoughtless” totally blew my mind away. It's easily one of the best books I've ever read if not the best. The author amazed me from page one and I couldn't for the life of me put this down. It was freaking perfection and the emotional turment...don't even get me started. A complete and u
New girl Kiera is torn between loyal boyfriend Denny and sexy, local rock star Kellan Kyle.I’ve been waiting my whole life for this book.
Around my lips, he kept telling me I didn't.” “Thoughtless” is the most realistic and best book about love triangles I've ever read.
Tell me...and it's yours.” The bright and shining star of this book is of course Kellan Kyle.
For me she was a young, immature and naive girl who made some stupid choices that in the end made her hurt two amazing men.
***groan*** Kellan POV of the 'rain scene' in Thoughtless (spoilers, so don't read if you haven't read Thoughtless yet!) http://www.fictionpress.com/s/3089151/6/It has taken me a LONG time to find some photos that represent my image of Kellan...
Alibi - 30 Seconds to Mars (how I imagine him singing at the end of Thoughtless) What I wouldn't give for a good video clip of this...http://open.spotify.com/track/0VMGkTg...6/29/2012 - how did I manage to cry even harder the second time I read this....
There were so many times I wanted to say "WTF are you thinking, Kiera!?!?" I put off reading this book because of the whole cheating aspect, but I am soooooooooooooo glad that I listened to suggestions from a few other readers.
Well, that's what disappointed me, because (with a little bit of hard brain activity) one could really explore the issue of love triangles, is it really possible to love two people at the same time, to keep it in my pants or not to keep it in my pants, to cheat or not to cheat with one of your boyriend's/girlfriend's closest friends (you know, that kind of stuff) and write a wonderful book.But nooooo, the author simply decided to create a perfect moron for her lead female character (and I'm putting this very mildly), put her in a love triangle situation, that is not even that complicated to begin with, and turn her into an armed madman on the loose.
How are we expected to have any semblance of a love life after meeting a fictional character like Goddamn Kellan Kyle?
It’s the story of a young woman, Kiera, who moves across the country, away from her family and friends, to be with the love of her life and boyfriend extraordinaire, Denny.
His attraction to Kiera is immediate but mainly because he likes the way she loves Denny, in my opinion.
Things happen, tequila is involved, and they sleep together.Kiera is then faced with more guilt than she can process, coupled with an attraction to Kellan that grows each day and which she does not know how to fight.
Kiera, supposedly over 21 yet possessing the emotional maturity of a seven year old, moves to Washington to be with her Australian boyfriend Denny, who she is completely devoted to despite not really having anything in common with him.
The relationship between Kiera and Kellan is stretched out repeatedly, with both making idiotic decisions so the story can go on another 50 pages.
I wish it was the worst thing he’d done to her in the book.I’ve seen one reviewer describe the car scene as “vaguely rapey”.
*****PERFECT TEN STARS*****February 2015 ReviewReading this series for the 4th time in preparation for the upcoming release of "Thoughtful"!!!! Most of my friends know this series is my #1 FAVE series of all time. Kellan Kyle is nothing less than PERFECT in my eyes. I have loved no other book boyfriend more than him. Some have come close, but none have been able to dethrone him.This book is beyond angsty and I know that some think I am crazy to have read this 4 times. All I can say is that Kella
I'm not expecting it to be an easy read, but I am so very happy to get to spend more time with my beautiful book boyfriend!!March 2013 review*****THIS BOOK WAS PERFECTION STARS*****Kellan Kyle will always be my #1!!
I've read this book for the third time and it truly does get better each time.I fall more in love with Kellan.
Me: Hey hey hey, Kiera. Hey look look here, I’m about to drop my hat, see? Kiera: *Eyes welling up* Me: Dropping, dropping and therrree dropped it!Kiera:   ..Like, SERIOUSLY?? How OLD are you?! Stop crying every time a guy opens his mouth!Gosh!
The review is for the part that I managed to read, between 1/3 and 1/2. I didn't finish the book. I lied. I didn't drink, but I'll tell you anywayWow, this heroine is just the stupidest and the most selfish out there. Think of a crappy woman and then multiply it by 10 and you have this chick! SPOILERS!!!!! She says she loves her boyfriend and when he took a job for 2 years in another city she flips out and dumps him. That wouldn't have been so bad if she didn't get drunk(not the bad part) and TH
That wouldn't have been so bad if she didn't get drunk(not the bad part) and THAN slept his his friend!
The idiot left his job and got home to her and the crazy bitch didn't even tell him that she cheated!
She just f*cks his brains out and the next morning asks his friend, Kellen, if they are still ok!
about 50% it is), it's just that she pretends it never happened wants to keep things like they were before the fact, and, believe it or not, keeps cheating with the guy when her boyfriend is home!
/SPOILERSBesides this the author kept repeating the words: sweet, cute, adorable...
I have to be honest, if this were true, I would have given the book a couple more stars...Really. I honestly hated the characters that much.I cannot for the life of me figure out how so many people love this book. I thought I would love this book. I at least expected to LIKE it!!! I started wondering around 30% and then when I reached the half-way mark I was fairly certain it was going to continue to suck. When Kiera got (view spoiler)[hit in head (hide spoiler)]I got my hopes up that she would

I started wondering around 30% and then when I reached the half-way mark I was fairly certain it was going to continue to suck.
Secondly,the heroine (who is also the narrator I kept wishing would die a slow and painful death) has got to be the whiniest, weakest and just plain old blah character to ever grace the page of a book!
I didn't connect with any of the characters and that makes for a really bad read for me.This is one of those books that will continue to baffle me as to why people like it.["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>
Heart-wrenching love triangle with one indecisive heroine and two beyond amazing heroes.I highly recommend that you read this series in order and as not to ruin the suspense of the love triangle in this book – it’d be best not to peek at the other two books until you have read this one.Hero 1: Denny Harris/Australian/22 years old/recent double-major college graduate-advertising intern/dark brown hair/dark brown eyesHero 2: Kellan Kyle/American/22 years old/singer, musician & songwriter for D-bags/light brown hair/navy blue eyesHeroine: Kiera Allen/American/21 years old/student/part-time waitress/dark brown hair/hazel eyesSpellbinding storytelling with excellent character development!
Don't read this review unless you have read the book, it contains a lot of the books spoilers. Also, don't read if you actually liked the book and the characters....you won't like what I have to say if you do. ^^^This picture sums up the bull shit that is this book but please, read on to find out what really pissed me off. * Warning * If you're easily offended by a foul mouthed, aggressive Irish female then DON'T read this fucking review.First off, I'm not usually this much of a bitch to slam a
* Warning * If you're easily offended by a foul mouthed, aggressive Irish female then DON'T read this fucking review.First off, I'm not usually this much of a bitch to slam a book to such an extent as I am about to do with this book but this isn't towards the author directly as a person, just the characters she created.
I fucking cheered when I reached the last page of this damn thing!!Now, it's not that rare for me to dislike a female character, everyone has a few who pissed them off but Kiera?
I’m just gonna come out and say it. I could not finish this book. Because I couldn’t finish this book. It’s not so much a review, but a list of the things I didn’t like about the book and just my general thoughts on the book. (1) Main character is an annoying, bitchy, cheating, slutty person that I wanted to kill for most of the book. I hated being inside her head.(2) Why did she cheat? Her boyfriend was perfect(3) The guy she cheated with is a douche.(4) The writing was good.(5) There were so m

(1)	Main character is an annoying, bitchy, cheating, slutty person that I wanted to kill for most of the book.

That the other man should win the girl.(12) I disliked most things about this book.Okay, well those are my general thoughts on the book.
❤❦ 4 Heart-Broken... well Hearts - Rating ❤❦Finding a perfect Kellan was hard... but on try #3 I THINK I did itMy KellanMy Kiera lolMy Kellan, Kiera & Denny ~*~*~**~~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*  Thoughless, I blurted out, "Him."  Seriously this book messed me up!!! I am not a big fan of love triangles and this book put me through a ringer, but thankfully I had my trusty Buddy-Read system. It consisted of encouraging words, dirty pictures and passing around razor blades for especial
Seriously guys if it weren't for you I would have NEVER finished it.Kiera follows Denny across country.
in a Douchebag Rock Group...
He is a bit messed up and a whole lotta of a womanizer (of course as a coping mechanism for a shitty childhood)As Denny busy with his internship, Kiera and Kellan (KK) grow close.
The more Denny is busy...
I’ll leave, and you and Denny can have your happily ever after.” He looked back at me.
Even though, this is not my type of favorite stories the characters were real and packed an emotional punch especially around %85.
If you were a Travis fan (Beautiful Disaster then I think Kellan is his long last brother!!
I gotta be honest, he could do so much better.And poor Denny, the poor guy didn't do anything wrong but love her & trust her.
I had said to myself that I wouldn't go straight into Effortless because I couldn't take anymore angst for a while & also that Thoughtless finished kinda perfect....but yet here I am 20% into it LOL.So in conclusion if, like me, you loved Beautiful Disaster or enjoyed the likes of The Vincent Boys than this is the book for you.
**4.5 I LOVE KELLAN KYLE STARS**I'll admit it, I think I'm the last person on earth to read this book.
I don't think I've ever read such an emotional story like this in my life.
She was torn between her old love and the luscious Kellan Kyle.
There were times when I wanted to slap some sense into her, but I definitely understood her angst and the position she was in even though I didn't agree with how things were handled.Thanks to my girl Patty cause if it weren't for her I don't think I ever would've read this.
It came to the point that I was actually upset with the author for expecting us to root for her because she's naive and torn between the love of 2 men.
In fact, I disliked her so much it ultimately made me dislike both the male characters too for loving her...and, let's face it, both Kellan and Denny SHOULD be desirable in any other story.Thank goodness the last few chapters were able to actually pull it together.
If this book were 300 pages shorter, I would have had less time to stew over Kiera and might have been able to enjoy it a bit more.
Things I hated about this book: its length and Kiera!!!
It was so repetitive that it felt more like a diary; "Kiera being infatuated with Kellan's looks.
Kiera flirting with Kellan and leading him on, falsely.
Kellan and Kiera say good morning.
I just wanted to slap Kiera across the face and yell at her for being so damn eccentric!
Urg!!Thing I loved about this book: Kellan Kyle, although I still never figured out what gorgeous singer like he saw in Kiera in the first place that made him endure all of the emotional torture and hurt just to be with her.
It is so unlike me to read a Young Adult/College Romance book and actually like it.
I think it brings much more drama and tension to the storyline so I liked this book a lot....but yet I didn't.This is a rather lengthy novel, coming in at over 500 pages.
It's the repetitive, drawn out relationship Kiera has with both Denny and Kellan that I started to irritate me, and don't even get me started on all that blushing!
There is a lot of fat that could be cut from this book, probably a good 100-150 pages and it would have been a 5 star read.
Gavin Degraw- Young Love http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdzH0g...
This book was so bad, it ruined the author and book's audiobook narrator for me.Soooo boring, superbly annoying character and an extremely mediocre story.This is the type of books I ask myself "why is it so popular?" Like why do people like this?I didn't even bother completing this crap. When I wasn't dozing off while reading, I was annoyed by the fucking heroine and her love interest.
