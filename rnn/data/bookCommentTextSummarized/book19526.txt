A fun graphic novel.
It's probably YA, or middle grade.
But I still enjoyed it pretty well.
My main gripe?
This first story starts out with the death of a parent.
Like, in the first four pages.
That's heavy-handed storytelling, and this book is better than that.
In the same way that you don't have someone kill a kid as a cheap way to establish a villain, you shouldn't have to kill a kid's parent to provide characterization and motivation for the young protagonist.
It says a lot that after that start, this still ranks 4 stars.
That's because the storytelling is strong.
Just as good as the first time I read it!!
I was not expecting to like this graphic novel as much as I did! It's darker than I had expected it to be. I'm pumped to continue on with this series!
This came recommended to me by a co-worker's daughter (through my co-worker who knew I wanted some recs for my kid since she will only read graphic novels or books that look like graphic novels, haha).
My daughter, who is almost 9, and I read it today while we were at the doctor (she has been sick for like, forever, not cool).Anyway....Me: "So, how do you rate this book, if five stars is awesome and ---"Kid: "Six!!!!!!"She loved it, and you know what?
Can I be one?I can't wait to read the next book!One thing for younger kids is that there are several instances where family members are either sick or (view spoiler)[die.
What a thrilling start to a series. I can see myself devouring the rest of the books like I did this one. Creative world, charming characters and engaging storyline.
The book jumps ahead 2 years and Emily's mom takes her and her brother Navin and moves to and old family home out in the middle of no where.
All kinds of things happen and Emily and Navin are on a search for their mom, which leads them to a home in the middle of another nowhere place.
They go on some adventures and then we have to find out what happens in the next book...I thought this was a great graphic novel and now I want to buy them all!
And soon, the family discovers a small door in the basement of the house leading to an alternate version of earth known as "Alledia".Emily has to decide if she wants to be the new stonekeeper after her great-grandfather passes away, and she agrees to take on her new responsibility.I found this story to be an overall exciting and exhilarating adventure, And I'm really interested to find out more about this world.I haven't been able to focus on any new books this week while waiting for The Raven King, so I'm glad that I took a leap and picked this up because the artwork within was great with relatable interactions between the mother and daughter.*Note: I'm an Amazon Affiliate.
I'll admit though, I'm a bit of a softy when it comes to moms or husbands dying, so your mileage may vary with that.The story is a familiar one; a magical object passed down in the family contains enough power to save the world, and a young girl is now tasked with making the right decisions to save those she loves.
I love the bunny robot character and I didn't find either child protagonist annoying or too whiny.
4.89676 I really really really really enjoyed this! Much darker than what I was expecting but amazing nonetheless. Also, this just reminded me so much of a Miyazaki film that I just couldn't stop smiling! I NEED THE NEXT ONES!
I discovered this series of awesome kids graphic novels almost by accident in a bookstore during a trip to the US.
And what a series!
It is for kids every bit as exciting as Saga is for us adults.
This first volume was gorgeous in terms of art and spell-binding in the text.
My kid was blown away and begged me to get all the other volumes.
This one is highly addictive so beware (or make sure your local library or bookstore has the other 5 extant volumes (of a projected 7 or 8) before you start!
I usually don't read Graphic Novels, never really have.
Not for any particular reason, I never gave it any thought, to be honest.
But this one caught my eye and paved the way for other fantastic graphic novels, like Saga, Lumberjanes or Giant Days.Also, this is the same artist that created my favourite Harry Potter covers of all time.The graphic novel is generally geared towards younger readers, so the plot was nothing unusual and a little obvious, though I still enjoyed it.
I especially loved some characters and settings.
What made this really worth reading though were the beautiful illustrations!
I loved the art and the design, the colours and the magic.Find more of my books on Instagram
This story creates a mood. It is creepy. This is crazy cool. The art is pretty amazing and the world Kazu makes up is astonishing. A family moves into a house knowing nothing about it's past. Their first night there they hear noises that eventually lead them to another world. The amulet is their guide and protector. Imagination, wow. This is some imagination. I really enjoyed this little book. I will be continuing with this series. I have to know what happens.
I picked up Amulet because it's a popular children's graphic novel and came highly recommended to me by children and adult librarians.Two years after the tragic death of her father, Emily moves with her mother and younger brother into an abandoned family home.
After discovering an amulet among the belongings, Emily's mother is abducted by a creature with tentacles and it's up to her and her brother to save her from a universe parallel to our own.I really enjoyed this book, it took me all of 30-45 minutes to read.
The introduction of the pink bunny creature just made this book a little too much for kids only.
Amulet is possibly the single most creative story I've ever read.The plot itself is a pretty typical portal-to-another-world tale.
But everything about the world is so unique.
Even simple things you take for granted, like getting from Point A to Point B -- in Amulet it's always a unique and fun experience.If the rest of the series is like book one, this may end up being my favorite series of all time.I'm pretty new to graphic novels, used to think that someone this was a lesser medium, but Amulet is changing that.
A clever graphic novel set in a parallel Earth, guaranteed to delight young readers with a sense of adventure.
On the helm in this novel are Emily and her brother Navin who survived a tragic accident and who are catapulted through circumstance into this exciting adventure after Emily finds a magical amulet in the attic of their new home.
The graphics here are beautiful as well as very colorful, which adds to the mesmerizing tale that is both touching and exciting to read.
Off to a great start into this series, I think it will delight young and old.

Next to hearing general good things, I was not sure what to expect from Amulet.
It started to endear me as I continued reading.
The start to this story, the prologue, is one that does tug at your emotional cord.
It eases you into the main story with little hints and nudges towards the prologue.
In places it feels a bit rushed, but overall it was a good introduction to this story line and world.
I think that is what interests me the most about this story and what makes me want to grab it and read it again.
Read the first four in this series years ago and decided to revisit the world. The seventh book comes out next week, so the timing is good. I'm at the bank and read this on the ComiXology app on my phone to quell my boredom. It was okay. I think I liked it more when I first read it, but tastes change. It's still a decent start. The amulet concept is reminiscent of Lord of The Rings. Will be reading more of these shortly.
This is such a fun read! The artwork is stunning.. the use of colour is so rich and everything feels really alive. And the story is really light hearted and friendly. It's quite an adventure! I think my problem comes with the shortness.. I didn't have enough time to discover the world or the characters. I really like the side characters, but I need to see more! One thing I really loved was the emphasis on family!
It's dark and beautiful. the artwork is enchanting, so is the story. highly recommend to anybody who loves graphic novels.কবে যে আমাদের দেশে এমন রঙের খেলার বই আসবে। হচছে যে না একদম তা না, কিনতু ডারক ফযানটাসির সাথে এমন কালার, আরট, গরাফিকসের কাজ দেখলে কলিজা টা জুড়ায় যায়। ই কপি পড়েই এই অবসথা। হারডকপি হাতে পাইলে ফিট খেয়ে পরে থাকতাম নিশচিত।

Everything from The Lord of the Rings to Harry Potter brings it up, and so when I saw that Amulet (Book One: Stonekeeper), a new graphic novel series by Kazu Kibuishi also worked the idea in, that was pretty cool.
It's not a bad graphic novel by any means, but if you're looking for a title about kids on a quest, there are certainly others I would recommend instead.Emily and Navin's life has taken a turn for the better, or worse, depending on whom you talk to.
Emily, for example, is not too thrilled that their mom has moved them into a new old house in some town called Norlen.
I started with a review of three stars but now that I'm about to write the review I realize that I have almost forgotten the story completely and I read it less than a week ago.
I am going to knock it down to 2.5 stars.
This is definitely a younger reader's graphic novel - it was a really fast read.
The concepts weren't difficult to grasp and there was nothing offensive in the graphic novel so I would recommend this one for anyone above the age of eight (possibly younger).
Cool!
What an enjoyable read this has been!
I loved it!
Felt like i was watching one of my favorite 90s show.
The nostalgia feels hit me hard.
Action packed, fast paced, suspenseful ride!
Such a great finale to end book 1.
We had 20% dialogue and 80% visual that is why in my opinion it is such a fast read.
I find the art pretty amazing i would just stare at it for a few mins and then move on to the next page.
I would have enjoyed it a bit more though, if there was more dialogue and interaction between the characters but nonetheless grabbed me from the very start.
I suck at reviewing graphic novels so here are my habitual dot points:- I know this is a middle-grade read but overall it missed the mark with me.- The art was cute, but I wasn’t a fan of the mother’s painfully long face.- Fast paced yet it feels like nothing is happening- Miskit is the cutest to ever cute.- Navin > Emily, which is strange because the girls are usually my fave.- Seemed to drag on despite its short 187 pages.
The kiddos on the Bookmobile were all very insistent that we order this series, so when it came in delivery I picked up the first volume to see what the hype was about. And I have to say, I'm quite impressed. The story, artwork, and characters are all fleshed out wonderfully. From the first page, I couldn't stop reading until I'd finished the whole thing. What also caught me off guard was the amount of heart in the story. Volume 2, here I come!
I adored this graphic novel! I liked the story, quite a lot. I loved the art. I can't wait to pick up volume 2!

4 🌟 Stars! Great start to an addictive and dark Graphic Novel series!!! After a family tragedy, Emily and her family move to an ancestral home to start a new life. On their first night, Emily’s mom is kidnapped by a creature. Now it’s up to Emily and her brother to figure out how to get things right and save their Mom. I wasn’t expecting to like this as much as I did. Looking forward to reading more about Emily and her brothers journey.
This starts in a very classic way. A family ( a mom with her two kids ) moves to a small town after a tragedy. The house was their grandfathers who also passed away. So far nothing newWhen a monster grabs their mother it's up to the kids to save her. They'll find themselfs in a very weird place with weird creatures in it.Besides the not so original start ( and that's why i gave 4 stars ) everything else is good.
3,5 bis 4 Sterne. Es schöner Einstieg in die Geschichte, ich freue mich darauf, mehr von der Welt zu sehen und noch ein paar Hintergründe zu erfahren. :)Alles in allem ist es etwas kindlicher, als ich erwartet hätte, aber das ist vollkommen okay. :D
