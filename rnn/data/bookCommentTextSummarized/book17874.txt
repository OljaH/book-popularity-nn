They must fall out of the sky whenever you're around.” And the ending was terrific.It made sense and it was nothing as I expected.The epilogue was one of the best parts of the book.It was funny and it ended the book perfectly.I can't tell how much I dig this series.It goes beyond the words.I highly recommend it, it's my all time favorite series and believe if I could wash up my brain to read this again I would in a breathe.I am so sure that I won't get over this one for a long long time , I mean how can I ?
One baby is enough!- In Opposition you will find out Luc and Paris’ connection- In Opposition you will find out who the girl is that Luc was protecting in Opal.- Mica will come back in Opposition- Origins will be in the next book- There will be a war in Opposition- Opposition will be the longest book in the series.- Chris (Blake’s friend) is Dead dead dead dead- JLA always planned for Matthew’s betrayal- *Spoiler* All the Origins are male, and born singles.- You will find out whether or not Katy blogs again in OppositionOMG!!
Apparently we got a quote from Opposition I think and it just makes me want to have the book even more.
I really want this book to come out faster.
5 Save the World stars! This is one of those epically awesome series. There is just no other way to describe it. When I first picked up Obsidian, I had no idea what to expect. I read paranormal ya every now and then, but it’s not my genre of choice. Still, I gave it a go. I was hooked. I loved everything about Daemon and Katy. All 5 of these books were captivating and hilarious reads full of action, humor, suspense and love. Opposition starts off right where Origin left off… Daemon, Katy and fri
I loved everything about Daemon and Katy.
All 5 of these books were captivating and hilarious reads full of action, humor, suspense and love.
Opposition starts off right where Origin left off… Daemon, Katy and friends trying to save the world thats been invaded.
Daemon and his Kitten have to be one of my favorite book couples ever.
I’m really going to miss Daemon Black and Kat. If you haven’t read this series yet, all 5 books are out so now you have no excuse.
Daemon Black is unforgettable and Katy is an awesome book nerd.
Jen nailed this series with an epic conclusion. Loved it!!!
The perfect end to a perfect series.
Daemon and Katy will always have a special place in my heart.
:)I **NEED** THIS BOOK!!!!!
I THOUGHT OPAL'S CLIFFHANGER WAS BAD, BUT IT'S GOT NOTHING ON THE STATE OF NEED AND DESPERATION THAT ORIGIN HAS LEFT ME IN!!!!
I need a freakin' time machine!!!Jennifer L.

It involved climbing up on my roof and blasting R.E.M.'s "It's the End of the World as We Know it (And I Feel Fine)" as loud as humanly possible, but real life rarely turns out that cool.It was happening-everything about the world as we knew it was ending, and it sure as hell did not feel fine.
People were being killed left and right.
Daemon, Dawson and Dee were taken away to go with the leader.
But the ending made me so happy.
“I'm game for anything with you, Daemon Black.”  That's it.The series that made me put aside my truest love after books (that would be sleep),that occupied my every thought for a week,that made me an antisocial madwoman mumbling about aliens,is over.Kat and Daemon's story is over.  “It didn't matter how many hours,days,months,or years we had stretched out in front of us;we'd always be together.This kind of love was the real deal,stronger than a whole planet full of psycho aliens and an entire
That's it.The series that made me put aside my truest love after books (that would be sleep),that occupied my every thought for a week,that made me an antisocial madwoman mumbling about aliens,is over.Kat and Daemon's story is over.
I absolutely recommend this series to everyone who enjoys romance with paranormal elements and kickass battles,and I hope you will love Lux as much as I did!
I have LOVED watching Katy's and Daemon's characters grow and mature over the course of the books.
Katy began this series as a lovable and strong character who was obstinate, and sometimes even pigheaded.
I can't end my review without expressing how grateful I am I read Obsession, an adult spinoff of this series.
Had I not read Obsession, I would have never pick up Obsidian, the first book in the Lux series, and I would have forever missed out on an amazing Young Adult read.
It's always bittersweet to say goodbye to a much loved series, especially one that will forever hold a piece of my heart.
http://www.jenniferarmentrout.com/a-s................................................................................................................5 AMAZING OUT-OF-THIS-WORLD BITTERSWEET SWOONWORTHY STARS!Such an outstanding conclusion to one of my all-time favorite series.
It was all I expected and more and I will definitely miss these characters and the amazing world Jennifer Armentrout has created.
I'm sad to see this series end but I couldn't have asked for a more perfect ending and I can guarantee that I will reread the Lux Series at least a million times.Before Reading:I.NEED.THIS.BOOK.LIKE.YESTERDAY!
The feels...When I realised there was a fifth book:Yes, that's right...I almost fell down the stairs.But it's all good, 'cause then I was likeand a little bit of this...and party and party*Squeeeeeeeee!
I helped save the planet in this book so… you’re welcome. It was my pleasure to save all of mankind alongside one of my absolute favorite book couples, Daemon Black and Katy Swartz. "They're up to something big. "Obviously." I smiled faintly. "The whole invading-Earth part kind of gave that away." I never thought I would fall as hard as I did for these characters when I gave the first book of this series a chance. I mean a book about aliens in high school? But it happened and I loved every page
I helped save the planet in this book so… you’re welcome.
I never thought I would fall as hard as I did for these characters when I gave the first book of this series a chance.
But it happened and I loved every page of this series, every sarcastic comment by Daemon, every loving word shared between Daemon and Katy and the many other characters that will be just as sorely missed.Daemon and Katy are the perfect book couple that would definitely light up the silver screen if given the opportunity.
Once again conclusion to series (that I love) written by JLA did not satisfy me.
Was it because I outgrew this series?
Was it the lack of essential "something" that was present in previous instalments but not in this one?
I enjoyed banters (it is Daemon after all) but overall I didn't like this book because it didn't reached the level of awesomeness from previous instalments.__________________________________PRE-REVIEW:I NEED THIS BOOK LIKE NOW!
JLA IS MASTER OF CLIFFHANGERS!I really hope that Daemon and Katy will get their HEA!
I desperately need some teaser or excerpt!
SO MUCH FUN! here's my booktalk https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBNkh...

❝Kat fascinated me, every aspect of her. She was beautiful, but it went so beyond that. She was so incredibly strong, and she bore the scars of her strength like a prizefighter. She was smart and stubborn, but most of all, she was kind, and she'd given me the ultimate gift when she loved me in return.❞ Thank you Jennifer L. Armentrout for letting me find a way to love one of your series and persuade me to keep going when I didn't mean to and expected to completely fall in love with it and compl
It's funny how it all went from hating each other to taking a bullet for each other and finding ways to prove their love for each other over and over, but I guess it was worth waiting and worth reading until finding out truths and all.Katy once again is a freaking badass and still that book nerd.
She accepted the person she became and wasn't a complete whining bitch, not caring about anything or anyone but instead cared about everyone, wanted to make sure everything was okay and didn't give up on finding out reasons behind her power and strength.Daemon again is the same sweet, loving, caring, yet stupid angel who cares so much about his love, Katy.
It's the End of the World as We Know It (And I Feel Fine) Yes, the world has beyond doubt changedBUTKaty does NOT feel fine.Daimon has picked a side and abandoned her.Or this is what Katy thinks.
“Kat.” He uttered my name like it was some kind of prayer, and then he pressed a kiss against the skin behind my ear.
“I broke every rule of my kind to heal you and keep you with me.
I … burned down an entire city to keep you safe.
I’ve killed for you.
Did you think I’d forget what you mean to me?
It's the End of the World as We Know It (And I Feel Fine)
Yes, the world has beyond doubt changedBUTKaty does NOT feel fine.Daimon has picked a side and abandoned her.Or this is what Katy thinks.
By the way his comparison to Loki, I thought it was just brilliant!Who are finally the bad guys?The Luxen?The humans?The Arum?And moreover:Who is human?Who is Luxen?Who is Origin?You cannot really tell.
I had such fun with this series and I would really love more books from this world.Previous books:Review Obsidian (Lux, #1)Review Onyx (Lux, #2)Review Opal (Lux, #3)Review Origin (Lux, #4)
I FINALLY finished this series! While I didn't enjoy this last book at all compared to the first one in the series, I will always love Katy and Daemon as characters. This series could been much more effective as a trilogy and I love/hate all the Twilight parallels (I really can't decide if they are genius or obnoxious). I think the story got too big for the world ultimately but I am glad I stuck with it and finished it. Jennifer's writing is addictive and hilarious as always and I'm excited to venture off into some of her other work!
I don't think that there was anything about these books that I did not like.
He would burn the world down and fight his own kind to protect Katy.
His arrogance was a little over the top in the beginning but like he said: "Luxen are naturally arrogant"By the second book I was pretty much in love with this gorgeous alien.
Her love for Daemon would not let her fail when she was fighting the Arum, Luxen or the Origins.
If you are a fan of aliens, action and some romance, then you might really like this series.
4.5 Stars "You ready to play, Kitten?" Opposition was bittersweet for me, it's the final book in the Lux series. The world is in chaos, between fighting invading aliens and secret government agencies - is there a light at the end of the tunnel for Daemon and Katy? I knew in that tiny second as we stared each other down that this was the beginning and this was also the end. The Luxen were truly invading. Katy was such a badass in this book, and of course Daemon had me constantly swooning. I reall

I knew in that tiny second as we stared each other down that this was the beginning and this was also the end.
Katy was such a badass in this book, and of course Daemon had me constantly swooning.
And I really wish Archer would get a book, love him <33
"I think you do like Archer, and you just don’t want to admit that you’re in the beginning stages of a bromance to end all bromances."
REVIEW: I’m bawling my eyes right at this very moment, because this series is over and lemme just tell you that it ended PERFECTLY. Opposition is absolutely top-notch fangirling material, set to conclude one of the most addictive stories by raising the bar on sexiness, action, heartbreak and pure, unloaded fun. It was everything I could’ve hoped for and then some – I completely loved it. “Kitten?”“Yeah?”His eyes were beautiful when they met mine, luminous and clear, and a long moment stretched o
“I had it with Daemon, but I wondered if we looked as love-struck as they did.“You do,” Archer commented softly.Ah, well, that was kind of embarrassing.“Yes, it is,” he added.
Since Daemon has to be with Katy because they're so perfect together -- not that I would say no to his alien hotness -- I have to state, loud and clear, that freaking Archer is mine to the hell and back, lol.
And seriously now, I love anyone who can make Daemon jealous over such trivial things like a hug or a candy bar.
I read this one via an audio book.
I bought the audio so I could listen to it while I worked out.
Unfortunately, the weather didn't cooperate and I had to shelf the audio until the weather improved a little.
Since I spread out my listening over a long period of time I will refrain from rehashing the plot.
I will say that I'm glad I got to experience this paranormal and I'll miss our crazy little book blogger who had an alien neighborhood.
Hard to believe I started this journey with the Lux series in 2012 and now it's over.

Read after book 3
3.5 stars “Kat whipped toward me, her eyes glowing from within. In that moment, she looked like a goddess—a goddess of vengeance.[Daemon's thoughts:] If we weren’t in the middle of a fight, I’d have you up against a tree right now.”  If I had to compare this finale to food, it would be porridge. It's satisfying, fills your stomach and you can even mix in honey or raisins to sweeten it. But you wouldn't ask for seconds. Not to mention three very angry bears that would be on you faster than you ca
Not to mention three very angry bears that would be on you faster than you can say, "Goldilocks did it!"Gimme back my porridge!Here's a basic rundown of the plot:Katy: I miss Daemon and his green eyes.
Wanna have sex?Katy: Lol, okay.Archer: I'm back if anyone cares.Daemon: I hate Archer because he hugged Katy longer than the three-second rule.
Wanna have sex, Katy?Katy: Lol, okay.Random government official: I AM GOING DESTROY A FEW STATES TO SAVE HUMANKIND.Katy, OMG, you can't do that!
Let's use the Secret Weapon.Katy: OMG, that's perfect!Daemon: I know I am.
Wanna have sex?Katy: Lol, okay.Sense a pattern?
“Did you think I’d forget what you mean to me? That anything in this world—in any world—would be stronger than my love for you?” *screams in the distance Nothing can get in the way of Daemon and Kath. The amount of development, love and passion they have is superb! I’m crying at how incredible their love is. One of the main reasons why I loved this series so much. I just love the dynamic they have, and every time they have a scene together I could feel the love and my heart just burst with so m
I just love the dynamic they have, and every time they have a scene together I could feel the love and my heart just burst with so much happiness and I wanted to cry because they are so perfect.The start of the book got me a bit confused but then everything made sense and I just got so into the story I honestly don’t know what to do now that I’m done.That’s the problem of reading the last 3 books in last then a week, I honestly have to learn how to savour the books and read slower so I don’t have to say goodbye so fast to amazing fantastic characters that I’m going to miss very much.I love all of the side characters so much, Dee, Luc, Archer.....
From there, the entire book is an emotional roller coaster ride as there’s confusion about why this person’s doing this, who’s on which side, immediate frustration with characters whom you wish you could kick in their appropriate gender genitals, and sweet, sexy romance.If there’s one thing I can guarantee you, it’s that the writing is just as good (if not better) than her previous books in the Lux series.
I’m absolutely sad to see this series over, but, as they say, all good things must come to an end.
Opposition is book number five in the Lux series by Jennifer L. Armentrout. How in the world do I ever do this book or this series justice in a review? I have loved this series from page one of book one. It’s a wonder my heart survived all the action scenes and will any other book couple ever be able to compete with Daemon and Katy? No, I don’t think so. Even though I am saddened to say goodbye to these characters, JLA did a fantastic job in this series conclusion.  “I wasn’t the same girl who

The things Daemon says to Katy, well, all I can do is “sigh.” This book will make you laugh plenty of times, cry, and sigh (a lot.) And I think there is a moral to the story.
For me, I think it is the old adage, “love conquers all.” The power of the love between Daemon and Katy, and even Dawson and Beth, is what saved them all.
******IT HAS A TITLE!*******  and that title is???????OPPOSITION!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Then I started to get a little antsy I must admit. It wasn't pretty See for yourself... Opposition? I'm assuming this means opposition between humans and Luxens maybe(of course with everyone being against each-other, it could means lots of things...As for the rest...Dameon and Katy They better get their HEA or I'm gonna be royally pissed. They are one of my ALL-TIME favorite couples(and no one better tell me th

Daemon Black is and always will be my dream guy!
Sigh..ladies(and gentleman, since even Daemon knows NO ONE can resist him) here's to hoping we all get our own Daemon Black one day, but while we're waiting for that happen we just have to BEG for Ms. Armentrout to contact a toy company and make us our very own DB that we could all cuddle with at night ;)!!!
Now that was a jaw dropping finish to a astoundingly epic series! It was a suspenseful, unpredictably, gorgeous finale. I'm pretty speechless, lol. Loved the way it ended, didn't disappoint in the least.
5 “I can’t believe this is the last one!!” Stars!!In this last installment of the LUX series we finally have what we’ve been waiting for since book 1: the war between luxen, arums and humans.
If you haven’t read this books because you believe nothing good can come from aliens, shut up, sit down, and start reading this right now!
Storyline:  I can’t say much about these books except that they probably are one of the most amazing YA series ever written.
As in the previous books, the supporting characters were great.
I don’t know why, but I believe Jennifer has something against them.
DAEMON, WHY YOU DO THIS TO ME?

same day as Ugly Love..
OMG I don't even know where to start.
I put off reading this for a week.
I wasn't ready for the end.
I knew it would break my heart to say goodbye.
I fell so hard for this series.
And it was a long year to get to this beautiful ending.
Thank you Ms Armentrout.
Thank you for giving this story life.
Thank you for sharing so much of yourself for our simple entertainment.
Reading saves all of us in different ways.
This series saved me last year when I was in a bad place.
So thank you Katy and Daemon.
