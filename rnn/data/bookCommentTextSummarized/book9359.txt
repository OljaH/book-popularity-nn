It's this last element that makes Sonny's Blues so wonderfully transcendent because Baldwin understands Jazz in a manner that I don't think anyone else in the world ever has.
And it is simply not possible to read the final passages of this story and not understand that; not feel it in the deepest reaches of your being.
Baldwin writes of the experience of listening to his brother play in a manner that leaves you feeling like you could be in a Jazz bar yourself, or at a poetry slam, or sitting in the audience of the most passionate one man show in existence.
The younger brother, Sonny, knows he has to escape Harlem to live the kind of life he wants.
Also, James feels guilty because he promised their mother he would look out for Sonny, but Sonny slips away, slips into the life he always dreamed of.Baldwin's vision of life for these two brothers is not a pretty one, and I'm sure it reflects his own struggles about family and future.
What he shows us in this story is that life's struggles can be overcome, and the bonds of family, of brotherhood, are never really lost, and that something like music can be the catalyst that brings us together, and heal the wounds of life.
James Baldwin reminds us that childhood isn't rife with happiness like everyone else paints it, that--for most--life isn't a fairy-tale, but far from it. Sonny's Blues is so real it should come with a warning label.
I can't believe I'm giving four 🌟 for a book I had to read for school.
But wonders can happen!
This story is about two brothers, a wannabe musician and a maths teacher, the first is a heroin addict, the second is in good shape.
What I liked about this book is the message it transmits, and that one should not feel guilty upon thinking that one didn't protect his loved ones well enough, because honestly?
No matter how you try you cannot completely protect them, but you can let them know you're there for them though.
Such a beautiful writing style also.
An incredibly touching piece of writing, beautifully executed
Because I've read this excerpt I want to read the whole book: "All I know about music is that not many people really hear it.
But the man who creates the music is hearing something else, is dealing with the roar rising from the void and imposing order on it as it hits the air.
While there's only so much you can do with it, the only way to find this out is to try; to try and make it do everything.He hit something in me, myself, and the music tightened and deepened, apprehension began to beat the air.
James Baldwin's ability to re-create Harlem is second only to James Joyce's ability to re-create Dublin."He hopes that there will never come a time when the old folks won't be sitting around the living room, talking about where they've come from, and what they've seen, and what's happened to them and their kinfolk.But something deep and watchful in the child knows that this is bound to end, is already ending.
The darkness outside is what the old folks have been talking about.
Three short stories about life in Harlem for young black children. Other reviewers have pointed to the 1950's which seems right with situations described - eg mention of horse and cart deliveries, motor cars, the evolved state of jazz ("Like Louis Armstrong?"... "No. I'm not talking about none of that old-time, down-home crap.")These are not happy memory stories, they are hard times. Themes include disconnection (and reconnection) of family, drugs, jazz, parental relationship / control of children, societal disconnection.Well written, realistic and atmospheric - great description in these short, easy to read stories.Four stars.
Achingly beautiful and fantastically written. What I love most about this short story is how well this can be adapted into so many lives and how painful any kind of addiction can be and how tragic and life-changing it is to overcome it. It caught me off guard, how much I felt for Sonny, and how much I truly enjoyed it.
No one writes about music and solitude as Baldwin does.
4.5/5 Stars. I really like the writing style of James Baldwin and I enjoyed the emotional journey I was transported on through this story.
I loved the story the first couple of times I read it, then fell more deeply in love with it when I taught it three or four times. At places a little over-written, at times a bit dated, but all in all it's a masterpiece.
They faced their life differently, and the story was about the conflict between the lives they chose.
In the past, Jazz and Blues are considered as “black music” (I’m not sure if I described it right or not…but…sort of.) They weren’t accept by the classical music, and ignored for a long time.
And in the story, Sonny expressed his passion for life through the music, and it met perfectly.
Besides music, as readers all know that blue also means depression and anxiety those negative emotions, and throughout the story, Sonny did suffer them all.
This well-written short story is my favorite. It is at once painful and beautiful. The final scene moves me every single time that I reread it. It is perfection.
“For while the tale of how we suffer, and how we are delighted, and how we may triumph is never new, it must always be heard. There isn’t any other tale to tell, it’s the only light we’ve got in all this darkness.”
The telling of this tale is moving, often wrenching, as we experience through the teller of the story the feelings that are common to all of us in the context of the struggles and unique trajectories of our own lives.Conversations between the two brothers explore the psychic pain common to all of us, relating it sometimes to why people use drugs, sometimes to the struggles we all experience in interacting with and understanding those closest to us.
The story works toward its climax, a jazz session at a bar where Sonny plays piano and his brother listens, listens and writes:“All I know about music is that not many people ever really hear it.
James Baldwin's "Sonny's Blues" is one of the short stories we discuss in my college class. It lends itself to the discussion of many literary terms, such as flashbacks and in medias res. More importantly, it initiates great discussions. We discuss the story in general terms, focusing our discussion on life, but we also discuss more culturally/racially-specific ideas. It's a great story, and I feel like I discover more within it during every reading.
أول مره أقرأ من الأدب الزنجي قصه جدا جميله وبالكاد تحمل معاني رائعه .. ربما لأني أعشق البيانو وأرى به تفسير الأحزان أكثر من أي آله خرى .. سوني هذا الذي يعاني ظل يكتم معاناته طوال القصه شعرت بغصه غريبه لما ياتراه لايقول لم أصغي للمعاناة بجديه الا حين كان يعزف وقتها رأيت كل هذه المعاناة ..
The book is very good in the sense of being relatable in same way to most people that have problems and real lifeThe book is basically the story of two brothers , one is a teacher(narrator) and the other is Sonny.
He explores the relationship with himself with the art of the music and its the meaning of it and by connecting to the audience listening to it.AT the end The narrator(he is brother) finally understands the suffering he is brother was going through and also understand he is own problems.I give this book a 5/5 of five because it connects so well with me.
I connect in a way with sonny because i love to listen to music that relax me and put every problem i have aside.
Yet, my words also palliate me from the sickness I call life, they assuage all the feelings I'm left with after tumultuously oscillating from eternal states of darkness into epheremal states of relief by allowing me to express what I feel in writing—just like Sonny was only able to speak truly when his digits fought and made love to those ivory white and black keys of an instrument which is a vessel of the soul of the artist playing it.
This is the second book by James Baldwin that I've read, and he is quickly becoming one of my favorite authors.
If you're a musician or a fan of blues and jazz, then you've got to check this out.
You can imagine the shock when Sonny tells his brother he wants to play jazz!
The story ends with him going to see Sonny's band play.
Baldwin's description of the performance gives a great account of what it means to be an authentic jazz musician.
"You see what I mean.""Tell me," I said at last, "why does he want to die?
You walk these streets, black and funky and cold, and there's not really a living ass to talk to, and there's nothing shaking, and there's no way of getting it out - that storm inside.
You got to find a way to listen." -pg.

The book is about two struggling African American brothers.
The narrator is the better half of the brother and Sonny is the worst half.
They struggle because Sonny wanted to become a Musician and his brother the unnamed narrator rejects the idea as to him this isn't a real profession.
The inability of Sonny to express his feeling and the inability of the narrator to listen drove he, two brothers, apart.
The art of music, however, throughout the book allows them to join together and brings many people together.
The book itself allows you to understand what art can do.
Didn't care for this story. Honestly, I don't care for his fiction at all. I understand that he wrote about that times that he lived in, but I just don't enjoy his work. As an intellectual, I have nothing but absolute respect for him. I read to escape and his fiction has too much unresolved rage for me.
Wow. What an outstanding talent. This novella was not only incredibly well written, with a magnetic rhythm into it, it also touched me deeply. This was the best short novel I've read and I definitely need to read more (or everything) by Baldwin. It's better to step into it blindly so I will only say one more thing: please read this!
This is a really powerful book in which everyone should read. The story opens with the narrator, who reads about his younger brother named Sonny who has been caught in a heroin..... its a great very short read book.
A perfectly crafted short story if I've ever read one.
A beautiful story set in the 1950s in Harlem that takes on drug addiction, economic classes among black Americans, the power of music (specifically jazz, duh), and most poignantly the relationship between two brothers who struggle to convey the love that they feel for one another.
"Sonny's Blues" is such a beautiful representation of race, poverty, addiction, family, and hope (or the lack thereof) in Harlem during the 20th century. The writing is so clear, intimate, and REAL??? I'm in love with Baldwin's writing style, his ability to seamlessly blend point-of-view from separate characters into first-person. WHAT KIND OF MAGICIAN ARE YOU JAMES? He's definitely an author that I deeply admire and I'm entirely invested in his characters, specifically Sonny in "Sonny's Blues." I believe this is a required reading for the human occupation.
