The dad has an affair with this young woman -- hardly older than a girl, a virgin, completely inexperienced in life or love.
He screams at this teenager (who was lucky not to get pregnant, btw, since they didn't use birth control) to get over it, already -- he's married and he's staying that way.If you heard about something like this -- maybe it happened to a friend of yours, maybe you read about it in a novel -- would your first sympathy really be with the poor, tormented man who has to put up with all these women acting like he owes them something?Why has no one pointed out how creepy it is that John Proctor is genuinely supposed to be a sympathetic character, and Abigail is a monster?And by the way -- contrary to what Miller says in his afterword, the only "legend" that "has it that Abigail turned up later as a prostitute in Boston" is the one he started by writing this.
What makes it even more shuttering, is the fact that it has always been relevant to any era, because it represents the fear in front of something we cannot understand, and the need to create witch-hunts in order to cover up our own faults as human beings and as members of our socities.
''I have given you my soul, leave me my name!'' is the ultimate cry for respect and understanding in a society that has lost all elements of compassion.
Are we more understanding now, more open-minded?
Do we find the respect we ask for?
This is a magnificent play about what happens when hysteria takes over a society, and evil people gain access to the levers of power; something, alas, which happens all too frequently.The focus of the story is John Proctor's struggle to redeem himself from the horrible guilt he has suffered since committing adultery with Abigail.
But, for some reason, the part I think of most often is a detail concerning one of the minor characters, Giles Corey, who dies offstage halfway through.
Giles is one of many citizens falsely accused of witchcraft by Abigail and those who are exploiting her.
The person telling the story finishes, and adds, "It was a fearsome man, Giles Corey"._______________________________________I just looked it up on Wikipedia; apparently it's all true.
Newt Gingrich has been encouraging people to read The Crucible.
We've agreed to help him.SAMUEL PARRIS: It's our duty, John.
JOHN PROCTOR: The second worst?SAMUEL PARRIS: Yes, the second worst.
After what's going to happen to Donald Trump in 2017.
But at least our case is remotely comparable, so it offers people a point of reference.JOHN PROCTOR: What's going to happen to him?
And after a while, he'll have said so many insane and self-incriminating things that a special counsel will be appointed to find out just what the hell is going on.THE WHOLE COURT: Oh, how dreadful![Pause]JOHN PROCTOR: You're right.
The Crucible: a play in four acts, Arthur Miller The Crucible is a 1953 play by American playwright Arthur Miller.

I may be a little unpopular with my 3 of 5 stars rating for The Crucible, a play by Arthur Miller, but in my world, a 3 means it's your generally good book/play/movie with some great things, some bad things, and an overall "yeah, you should probably read it."The topic: Salem Witch Trials, one of my absolute favorite time periods in American history to research.
But when this is about an episode from our history over 250 years before the play was written, I expected something a bit different / stronger.
I think what I wanted more of...
Abigail immediately shouts witchcraft, and others join in; and soon the subterfuge becomes mass hysteria.Miller has chosen John Proctor to be tragic hero of this play; haunted by guilt at his infidelity (even more so because his wife forgives it), he seeks punishment for himself, at least inside his soul.
Yes indeed: the courage to stand up for what one thinks is right is ultimately the refined product that comes out of the crucible.----------------------------------The character who impressed me most in the story was Giles Corey, an 81-year-old man who refused to confess or refute when faced with charges of witchcraft.
Estoy sin palabras... Realmente estremece ver hasta dónde es capaz de llegar la gente por estupidez, envidia y lujuria. Pero lo que más me ha gustado ha sido la fuerza moral de Proctor; impresionante.
“The Devil is precise; the marks of his presence are definite as stone...”Based on historical people and real events, The Crucible is a searing portrait of a community engulfed by hysteria.The Crucible provides such an interesting insight into the mass hysteria and paranoia brewing in Salem, Massachusetts in the seventeenth century.
obviously I can’t gripe about this too much as these are REAL character names based on REAL events, but I am complaining because it’s my review and I can!
Some of his actions/reactions just didn’t sit well with me, so the ending etc just wasn’t as impactful.However, Miller perfectly depicts the hysteria, paranoia and fear that brews in Salem in the wake of accusations of witchcraft.
"I’ll tell you what’s walking Salem—-vengeance is walking Salem. We are what we always were in Salem, but now the little crazy children are jangling the keys of the kingdom, and common vengeance writes the law!" Such is the power of those noticeable quotes in Arthur Miller's play The Crucible; the power to cause the audience to question the issues arising when vengeance is allowed to write common law.

Such is the power of those noticeable quotes in Arthur Miller's play The Crucible; the power to cause the audience to question the issues arising when vengeance is allowed to write common law.
Arthur Miller's play was created to be challenging for this very purpose.This was written at a time when the House of Un-American Activities (HUAC) was in full swing.
(view spoiler)[ What the audience come to discover is that Abigail is in love with a certain John Proctor, a fallen and married man who committed carnal sin.
I appreciated Arthur Miller bringing attention to the Salem Witch Trials and anti-communist hysteria.
Yes, Abigail's actions posed major problems - but Miller portrays John Proctor, the man who has illicit sex with her, as a martyr.
Miller grants the men in this play complexity and autonomy; he relegates women to the role of one-dimensional witches.
It may make you angry, and if it does, I encourage you to think about who to direct your anger at in this play - the oppressed women, or the men who take advantage of them.
I'll never stop thinking about this... it was incredible
" - the Devil is alive in Salem, and we dare not quail to follow wherever the accusing finger points!" Though Miller claims to have had an abiding interest in the Salem Witch Trials, we all know this play was written as a gigantic Screw You! to Senator Joseph McCarthy and his investigations into alleged Un-American activities. The amazing thing is how well the play works on its own. Even if you know nothing of McCarthyism, you will still be moved by the plight of a small Massachusetts village w
Though Miller claims to have had an abiding interest in the Salem Witch Trials, we all know this play was written as a gigantic Screw You!
"I saw Sarah Good with the Devil!
This is truly a depiction of humanity at its worst.When John Hale, a visiting reverend who has been charged with investigating Salem's little witch problem, declares: 
"No man may longer doubt the powers of the dark are gathered in monstrous attack upon this village."
It seems we are always willing to believe the worst in others; that they might be witches, or Communists or terrorists.
It was one of those rare books that are forced upon you and then when you read it, you fall. Hard. While Miller might have written it with the McCarthy Era in mind, it applies very well to the current era of singling out a group of people and labeling them as 'evil'. I reread it a few months back and it still gave me the chills. Proof of what the power of fear has. I'd recommend this to anyone and everyone, though if you're not one for symbolism and parallels, this might not work as well. ;)
“We are what we always were in Salem, but now the little crazy children are jangling the keys of the kingdom, and common vengeance writes the law!”There is a remarkably harrowing scene in Frank Darabont’s expertly executed 2007 film adaptation of Stephen King’s lovecraftian novella The Mist.
The stage for this particular drama to unfold:A group of denizens of a small rural town are holed up in a grocery store, enveloped by a mysterious, impossibly thick mist.
A portal opened up, which spewed forth the strange mist and a horde of creatures, an outcome which could very well spell doom for the entire world.
3.5😱😱Este libro…No sé ni siquiera cómo reseñarlo. Es que es increíble. No, sin palabras. Me ha dado mucha rabia todo.Es realmente interesante porque está enfocado en los aspectos sociales y políticos de la caza de brujas en Salem e increíble hasta dónde puede llegar la histeria del ser humano.
I felt greatly sympathetic toward John Proctor, who was a flawed man, but one that wanted to live and let live and anger toward multiple characters, but especially Abigail, the leader among the girls, in how she manipulated and blackmailed everyone she came across.Arthur Miller gave life to each of the characters (who were or were based on real people) in this play to the point that you are bound to feel something toward each of them and either care, cringe, or get that feeling you want to punch them in the face.
So, i had to read this book for Lit, and so i was all:So Before i bore you with my actual review, here are my reactions to the book through gifs.Abigail sentencing Elizabeth:When Danforth offered to see Mary Warren's side:Mr Putnam killing of his foes for land:Rebecca Nurse not confessing:John Ripping Up the Contract:Characters: If I had one word to describe the characters of this book, It would be deceiving.
I came to respect Proctor and his choices, even right to the end when he aimed to confess but didn’t end up doing it.
3.5ish
What a gripping story. This could be redone into a dystopian YA novel and it is set in history. It is a powerful work. How terrifying it is that people can be so brutal to each other. A very dark bit of American history. Not the best story to read during 45. I hope we don't repeat this sort of history. The story is good and it leaves me in a dark mood. I don't think I'll read this again and I'm glad of the reminder of it. I need something lighter now.
Such an upside down world must have seemed as illogical and insane in the 1600s as in the 1950s.“We are what we always were in Salem, but now the little crazy children are jangling the keys of the kingdom, and common vengeance writes the law!”Miller’s John Proctor is one of the great tragic figures in modern drama.
Tormented by his own sins, and incapable of forgiving himself, Proctor is nonetheless man enough to finally stand up to the tyrants.
The final scenes with him are high points on the stage in any era.“Because it is my name!
So I got my Book Jar off the shelf and asked my little brother to draw for me...and this is what he came up with.
You'll laugh your head off.", I would have been in serious disbelief and would probably never have read it.
I know it's not meant to be a diverting story and I'm probably pretty crazy to have even laughed at all, but some parts just came off as really amusing and I couldn't help it.
If you've read this book, you know what I mean, and if you haven't, give it a shot.
"Oh, the noose, the noose is up!"What an intense and disturbing read! The crucible is a play written by Arthur Miller in 1953, about the destructive nature of superstition, ignorance, fear, corruption, greed and vengeance. It is ostensibly based on the witch trials in Salem in the seventeenth century, but is truly inspired by the persecutions of communists and “unAmericans” by Senator McCarthy.
So creepy and chilling. So much more readable than I anticipated. I love how you just can't get out of the trap of accusation and hysteria. I also loved the evolution of John and Abigail. I learned a lot about the Salem Witch Trials, which was so cool! I didn't realize how steeped in fact this play is!
Schools often make kids read literature that is too mature for their age group, and I have come to find that even a single year's difference can make or break one's comprehension of the book.
He made an awful mistake but had the courage to confess and make a stand against his wrongdoing, even if it resulted in his paying the price for it.
That spoke novels to me.It wasn't a favorite read of mine, but Miller's message of self-confession and the precarious state of society were interesting and thought-provoking nevertheless.
Describe perfectamente el fanatismo, la estupidez general y el histerismo colectivo, sacando lo malo de toda colectividad, describiendo como se va haciendo una bola de mentiras, odios y tonterías cada vez más grande.
Como se aprovechan algunos de la situación para vengarse de los demás, con mentiras y falsos testimonios y como los demás, como borregos, se lo creen absolutamente todo como si fuera verdad o por comodidad.
Algunos personajes me han llegado a sacar completamente de quicio.Lo peor de todo es que fue verdad ^-^El personaje de John Proctor el mejor de toda la obra.
Arthur Miller's scathing indictment of 50's era McCarthyism was more interesting than I thought it would be.
Miller set the piece in Salem, MA during the infamous 1692 witch trials.
The play itself is divided into four acts and features the struggles individual villagers face as they are confronted with a hellish choice between hanging for witchcraft or falsely confessing, a choice which leads to the death of others.The action is driven by a posse of teenage girls.
The play makes the adjective puritannical take on a whole new meaning.
Es tenebrosa, explora partes de la naturaleza humana que te dejan pasmado... pero lo que más miedo da es que, a pesar de estar escrito a modo de obra de teatro, no es una obra de ficción.
It never gets old though the tragedy does especially when history seems doomed to keep repeating itself.
Another baaad Artie Miller metaphor. It doesnt take alot of deep-think to explain Why. Folklore-friendly Millersloppily sees the hysterical McCarthy Era of the 50s as a parallel to the Salem witch hunts of the 17thC. Aye, here's the rub : We know that "witches" do not exist. We know that Communists  did  exist, worked in US government. Were Russ spies. So, any matchup w Salem is cockeyed mellercuckoo. Does this understanding require intelligence?
Quizá sea un 3,5. Me ha gustado más de lo que esperaba y he echado en falta una introducción sobre el origen y sentido de la obra (poner en evidencia la caza de brujas del comité de actividades antiamericanas). La última parte engancha y angustia, por lo injusto del proceso.En general, se lee en un par de tardes y deja buen sabor de boca.
O confiesas que eres bruja o te ahorcamos... ¡Qué rabia me ha dado todo en esta historia!Ahora quiero seguir leyendo cosas sobre esta historia para conocer bien las razones de todo lo que sucedió.Abigail se ha convertido en uno de los personajes más odiosos que he leído.
Why do I love these despicable women?
Because it’s fun finding reasons they’re motivated to be awful while everyone else in the audience is busy loathing them (looking at you, Cersei Lannister and Delores Umbridge).John Proctor can call Abigail Williams a whore all the live long day, but she’s not the one who is cheating on anyone.
She also lives in a society that repressed everyone, but women in particular, while they all lived in fear of their own shadows thanks to their angry God and snooping neighbors.
Everyone spent all day, every day working and praying.
Except Sunday—then you were just praying.
Me ha parecido muy interesante esta obra ambientada en Salem en la época de la quema de brujas cuando todo un pueblo estaba bajo el influjo de la teocracia. Cualquiera era sospechoso de haber tratado con el Diablo y tanto si lo negabas como si lo admitías acababas perjudicado. Durante toda la obra vas sospechando de quien dice la verdad y quien miente, cosa que me ha mantenido enganchada y no he podido parar de leerlo hasta acabarlo.Es un 3,5 estrellas, que no está nada mal!
Me ha gustado como ha plasmado en la obra de teatro el escritor los hechos sobre la caza de brujas en Salem. Fue una época verídica, en la que sucumbieron algunas personas y se dejaron influenciar por otras en el culto al diablo, cuando realmente no era verdad. Los juicios fueron en su momento justos según el punto de vista de los jueces involucrados y los acontecimientos de la época, y nos llevó de la mano por todo el proceso que vivieron en ese tiempo.
This was a very unexpected and enjoyable read for me. Yes, every character had at least one major flaw. Yes, these idiots in Salem made my blood pressure go up more and more with every act. That being said, I did enjoy the overall plot and drama of the play and now have newfound respect for the women and men affected by the Salem Witch Trials.
I like how he writes dialect, and I love how he writes stage directions - pages of the damn things, so that a whole lot of plot happens in complete silence.On the other hand, I have never met a play performed in near-total darkness that I've thought yeah, this is fantastic, more of this.* And for me, The Crucible collapses a bit under its own weight.
It was hiding in the Act Two stage directions.Having done both, I prefer watching The Crucible to reading the script of it, and on balance I think I moderately prefer other people to Arthur Miller.
This perfectly portrays humanity's gullibility, piousness, and knack for hysteria, while at the same time demonstrating the strength of those who would rather die than provide a false confession. I am now going to buy everything Arthur Miller ever wrote.
Terrible hasta que punto puede llegar la histeria del ser humano. A medida que lo iba leyendo no podía dejar de ver paralelismos con nuestra realidad actual, a pesar de que esta obra data de 1953 y está ambientada en el siglo XVII . No hay más que darse un paseo por twitter para ver de lo que hablo. Y es que el ser humano sigue siendo ser humano, aunque ahora la quema de brujas no sea de forma literal.
En la historia del mundo hay varias partes que parecen imposibles de creer y para mi siempre a sido una de ellas la de los juicios de Salem, donde un par de niñas decide acusar de brujería a medio pueblo y el pueblo, de hecho les cree.
Por supuesto se entiende en el contexto histórico de la época como algo así llegó a suceder pero no por eso deja de ser un hecho bizarro.
En realidad no hay mucho que decir, es una lectura extremadamente rápida que te da una mirada superficial de lo que fue pero que es fácil de leer y se disfruta.
I think it’s mostly because you know which direction the play is heading towards, so you don’t expect anything.
I think this play is primarily to be judged by its analogy (and allegory) to McCarthyism.
Arthur Miller pointed out that people in the 17th century certainly believed that witches were real.
People from the 17th century alleged that if you did not believe in the supernatural existence of witches and demons then you must also the deny the supernatural existence of god.
It wasn’t quite the analogy of McCarthyism that had me thinking.
For the court to admit mistake in the present day would bring its authority into question.
I have given you my soul; leave me my name!”This was one of the most powerful stories I have ever had the pleasure of reading.
The hysteria that ensues in this novel feels almost unbelievable, and yet it is a part of American history.
The actions of the young women of the novel feels exaggerated and amplified, and it makes for a poignant reading when you know that this is not the case at all.
This is a phenomenal and accurate portrayal of historical events that really brings to life a whole generation of people and a whole era of history.
4.5/5 stars “Until an hour before the Devil fell, God thought him beautiful in Heaven.”  The Crucible is definitely one of the best plays that I have ever read. It's intense, very well written and can be related to so many points in history. The portrayal of fear and hysteria is so accurate and Arthur Miller expertly examined human reactions.

The situation is completely different but the themes carried through the play can be seen in all parts of history.
This was a phenomenal play!
Weil ich mir das Stück am kommenden Mittwoch ansehen werde. Durch die Brille des Zeitgeistes gelesen, ängstig mich dieses Stück. Schlimmer noch - dass es auf eine wahre Begebenheit verweist und das dazu erforderliche Weltbild, das diese Geschehnisse überhaupt erst möglich machte, wieder in manchen Köpfen (viel zu vielen) erstarkt ist, dreht mir regelrecht den Magen um. Ich weiß jetzt schon, dass ich das Theater ziemlich aufgebracht verlassen werde.
The beginning was incredible. So much drama introduced so quickly, with the conflicting goals of the different characters. And the stakes are pretty high, considering everyone is trapped in a life-or-death situation.The stakes started about as high as they could get, and the drama seemed to reach it's peek also in the first act. So it didn't feel like the story was growing or evolving enough.
