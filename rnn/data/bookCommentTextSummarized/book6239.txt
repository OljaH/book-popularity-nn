The exquisite irony of racism here is that Myrdal detailed how Blacks were concerned with just the opposite rank order: they wanted jobs, housing, bank loans, good schools, and *least* concerned about dating White girls (to put a point on it.) Highly recommended and I think the extreme denial of the persistance of racism among U.S. Whites in the South and Midwest still smacks of Myrdal, 70 years later.I must get to the sociologist Hochschild's Strangers in Their Own Land: Anger and Mourning on the American Right that goes to the U.S. South (that which the "southern" ideology stretches clear up through the U.S. midwest, as we know from Hillbilly Elegy: A Memoir of a Family and Culture in Crisis to study the phenomenon among the lower socio-economic demographics of "voting against one's interests", e.g., voting against Federal programs that the individuals rely upon in their lives.
This magisterial book was well worth the three weeks it took me to read it. I highly recommend it for anyone who wants to understand the significance of race in American life.
