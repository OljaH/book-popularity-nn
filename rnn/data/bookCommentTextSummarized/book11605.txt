Si The Royal Hunt of the Sun trataba de la hermandad casi a lo Caín y Abel entre Pizarro y Atahualpa, y en Amadeus son Mozart y Salieri figuras opuestas del espectro de la naturaleza humana, Equus ofrece el tema conflictivo de las ciegas pasiones individuales embridadas por una sociedad hipócrita y mezquina en las figuras de un psiquiatra y su paciente --figuras que no por ser menos espectaculares a priori que sus contrapartes en las piezas mencionadas resultan mucho menos reveladoras e iluminadoras del alma de sus espectadores/lectores.Peter Shaffer desarrolla su argumento con astucia detectivesca.
i am a little sad that the play was recast with daniel radcliffe, as i feel that everyone now associates this brilliant, brilliant work with naked harry potter and a horse.
we had so many discussions about how christianity was portrayed in the play, how this related to freud's thinking, to feuerbach and jung and kirkegaard and stoppard and woolf, and everything we had read up to that point, and it was somehow one of the most brilliant things i have ever participated in.
i could go on and on, but dysart's last monologue remains one of the most haunting and poignant things i have ever read in a play.
This is messed up. This is SERIOUSLY messed up... and I loved it for it.
آلن که شخصیت اصلی این نمایشنامه است، نوجوانی از نظر ذهنی ناپایدار است که برداشتش از زندگی دچار اختلال شده است و به اسب ها دلبستگی شدیدی دارد.
دلیل اصلی که هستر از دیزارت می خواهد که به دنبال درمان آلن باشد این است که او تصور می کند این پسر رنج می برد، و دیزارت می تواند او را از این رنج برهاند.
دیزارت برای این که بتواند آلن را درمان کند، باید در کودکی او کاوش کند تا ریشه عاملی که باعث این جنایت ها شده را به دست آورد.
Uzeh ovo da me malo drmne od dugih knjiga koje sam naredjao.
Malo je predobro uradilo posao (ili, što bi srboenglezi rekli: drmnulo me, it did).
Provlači se ovde svašta, osvrti na materijalizam (iako se duboko ne slažem da je to kritika, već samo portret jedne ličnosti), mentalnu bolest, licemerje, ali ona suštinska tema jeste religija.
Ili makar verovanje, obožavanje, obogotvorenje.
Jer ko želi da bude uplašen?
Ko želi da obožava personifikovanog konja?
Ponekad je samo lakše.
U glavi sam konstantno zamišljao jedan jedinstven amalgam pozornice i filma, sa sve upečatljivom i jezivom horskom muzikom konja u topotu.
Very early on the psychologist makes a note of Alan's reciprocity during his sessions; the unabashed effort being covert or being blatantly verbally abusive to his doctor only showed the extent of devolution of his mind.
Alan's mind warps God, horses, religion and its iconography into a garbled mush that makes his actions and reactions extreme.Shaffer doesn't hold back on the observations Alan makes during the course of the play.
Shaffer twists every possible influencing factor that aids in mental development of a child thus making Alan's final act almost an inevitable response.

all of my favorite topics explored in a really uncomfortable way, huge fan
paarden zullen nooit meer hetzelfde zijn *equus noise*
The action takes place after the event in the hospital which the courts have remanded Alan, and while the crime is central to the play, the play revolves around the character of the psychiatrist, Dysart, who is tasked with 'curing' the boy.Those who have a wider background in such things are probably well aware of this play--it won a Tony Award in 1975 for best play and best direction, and there was also a film adaptation in 1977--but I knew nothing about it before picking it up on a whim at some discard sale; the back cover description sounded interesting and I keep an eye out for unusual dramatic works.
On re-reading 12/10/18: Been teaching it for years now, but haven't actually read it cover-to-cover in a while (2016, it seems).
Just gotta say, play is still amazing!
I'd love to see it performed.On re-reading 3/20/16: I've re-read this numerous times since my junior year of high school; however, the last time was probably about a decade ago.
Now, in revising my ENG 102 class and realizing that I can assign any play I want, it seemed obvious to revisit my favorite.
Did I just happen to read this at the right time in life?
The book is amazing; it will definitely be assigned reading.
What I like most about it is that it is psychological.
I also like the part where Alan and Dysart mutually investigate the matter of each other's dreams to find out that it was the shrink's dream is more related to illnesses the dream being the doctor practicing the ritual of sacrificing hundreds of children by carving up the chests down to the navel then throw the guts and study the pattern they make up ( terrifying, really).
That's one of the critics to Freudism.There is a chunk of the dialogue between the shrink & Hesther whereby they discussed being psychologically normal.
psychologically normal!!?
Trust me: it's not just that play about Harry Potter getting (a) naked and (b) it on with a horse. It's about the construction of God and meaning in the modern waste land; and perhaps even more compellingly, about the moral dilemma of a therapist who has to convince his patient to abandon all escape routes and return to the waste land. (In that sense, it reminds me a great deal of Pat Barker's  Regeneration .) It's a play of ideas, basically, only thinly veiled by its outrageous subject matter.

Devastating. Compelling. A must read.
A child is born into a world of phenomena all equal in their power to enslave and since Dysart can’t account for this power he is forced to question his whole profession, even his whole existence.Shaffer was inspired to write Equus when he first became aware of a crime involving a 17-year-old boy who blinded six horses in a small town near Suffolk.
So what Equus argues then is that normal is not always ideal, and that madness is constructed by society.Most important however are the religious themes featured in the play, and the manner in which the character Alan Strang constructs a personal theology involving the horses and the supreme godhead, "Equus".
This hit all the beats for me: psychology, religiosity, philosophy, bizarre (and deeply unsexy) sex stuff, and horses. As a former "horse girl," I can agree that horse girls are a strange breed. Horse boys though? Whoaaaa, Nelly. 🚫
But I wasn't drawn into it because of that, didn't keep reading it nonstop for an hour because of that, wasn't utterly chilled by the past few pages wherein the doctor wonders if he is doing the right thing in rehabilitating the boy because of that.
Essentially I cannot know what I do--yet I do essential things.
[He _moves _away _from ALAN, __back to the downstage bench, and finally _sits.] I need--more desperately than my children need me--a way of seeing in the dark.
(It's a Samuel French edition, but from London; the size is all wrong and the paper is all funny.) It seemed like a good idea at the time, since coming out of high school I self-educated myself in playwriting by simply reading every play I'd heard of.
The play is getting a lot of press right now with a new production, so I wondered what it would be like.It's fine, turns out, is theatrical in the sense that it's hard to grasp the impact of several scenes without staging.
Wow, so much to think about.What do you choose, passionless sanity or ecstasy-filled worship and obsession?I wish I could've seen Daniel Radcliffe in this play. I pictured him as Alan as I read it but I bet his performance was phenomenal.And how ironic that he starred in this play at the height of the Harry Potter fandom. Mr. Radcliffe could probably tell you all about what passionate worship looks like from the perspective of the horse.
Pirmā luga manā dzīvē, kuras lasīšanu es izbaudīju, galvenokārt droši vien tāpēc, ka vide šeit nav nozīmīga, svarīga ir tikai saruna un rakšanās Alana galvā. Un dīvainā kārtā, par spīti vides otršķirīgumam, visa darbība manā galvā zīmējās ļoti spilgtā filmā.
I actually wrote an essay on this play as a favour to a girlfriend years ago.
It was part of her A Level coursework and she'd forgotten all about it!I had to read the play and write the essay in one night.
Not bad for one night's work!From what I remember, I absorbed this material effortlessly, as you always do with great writing.
I knew back then, even not being all that up on plays and the theatre and what not, that this was special.Girlfriend was very appreciative, lol!
So I'll always have a special place in my heart for this play.
Third time I've read this. A brilliant play, and one of my personal favourites. I'd pay a lot of money to see this play.
FUCKED UP IF TRUE
Someone once told me that they thought Equus was outdated. Now that I've read/experienced the play myself, I think they were wrong in saying so. The themes of blame, religion, pain, and normality found within this play all ring true still to this day. I think the person who said this to me perhaps forgot what life was like as an adolescent and doesn't do good with the sadness that comes with nostalgia. It's all there in everyday life. You just have to be aware of it.
Equus turned out so much deeper than expected. Actually reading the play and finding out exactly what it's about, cleared away my initial thought that this book is all about sex and horses. It's not. It's about freedom, and passion, and how they tie into (Or rather, are broken down by) modern society.
When I tried to read more short stories last year, I failed miserably as I really dislike the genre.
I decided to try to read more drama as I enjoyed it in high school and took a Shakespeare and another drama course in college and since then had read none.
It is deep and dark and by the end, the psychiatrist who is trying to treat the son is questioning what is "Normal".
I will definitely try to see it performed as the stage and stage directions are very unique.
My new plan is a play a month to broaden my reading away from fiction and nonfiction.
Shaffer's great play of psychological suspense.A teenage boy, caught between a religious mother and an atheist father, suffers from a unique delusion that causes him to commit a shocking act.
The task of discovering why falls to a middle aged psychiatrist who is dealing with his own midlife issues.The answer to the boy's mystery slowly unfolds during probing psychoanalysis and reenactment of key events.
Actors portray six horses, who act as a (very) Greek chorus and as objects of the boy's delusion.The play asks us to consider: what is "normal"?
Is "normal" just what's left in plodding, numbed adults after their youthful sense of myth and wonder is removed?
Is "normal" even desirable?

I became interested in this play years ago when I heard Daniel Radcliffe was starring in it, but I never got around to reading it. Recently I found it at a charity book sale and snapped it up. I was not disappointed. The antagonist's relationship with his horse and his twisted sexuality lead the reader down a trail of serious personal interpretation.
Interesting, disturbing and devastating! I rather enjoyed this play and find myself, in the end, a little heart broken. Great, quick read!
