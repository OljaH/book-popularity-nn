Crazy, right?
Whenever I read books in this series, I tune up my mind into thinking:  “Somebody’s gonna die!
Somebody’s gonna die!
I don’t care at all!
I just don’t have any idea how to review these books.
Buddy-reading with @Liz.It was definitely  the MOST EPIC book of the series  combining CRAZY ACTION scenes that explode out of nowhere and TWISTS and TURNS, which puts the characters in danger over and over and it's so intense you have to continue reading just to know if they will survive.
And you know what ?
I'm starting to think Pittacus Lore hates happy couples  and don't want any at the end of the series.
First, Eight, then this character ?
--------A Year.A fucking year to wait.After fifth Book's END, I think everyone agree that we need the last book.
“You have to know, from the moment I saw you outside Paradise High, I knew.
I knew we were going to fall in love.
And I've never regretted even a second of it.
I love you with all my heart.
it was all worth it.”  This book fucked my mind completely.
I have nothing to say, I'm just - please let me die alone.
It's too much, still too much even though I have tried to compose my thought and write this review, I can't stop my hands from shaking.
What happens in
I knew we were going to fall in love.
This book fucked my mind completely.
However, I didn't mind that because the other things added by Lore in the end compensated those mistakes and made me look over it eventually.Despite the face that The Fate of Ten has already fucked my mind, it also led me up to the highest point of my hope for the next and final book.
I love Adam, he's good to look at and I don't have other reasons for this kind of obsession.
“This is war, and people are going to die.
Friends are going to die.
There's no way it's gonna end on anything but a high note of amazeballsness.Update #1: Holy shit nugget, the title's finally here!
Now again, I'm wondering how this is not gonna be the last book at all - 'cause let's face it, one should be enough to wrap everything up at this point.Update #3: I've placed my library order - and by a sheer miracle, I'm first in line!
The apocalypse has already begun, and there's no way it can take them until Book 7 to finally take down Setrakus Ra...right?(view spoiler)[Apparently, it can.
Another one? The fifth book was supposed to be the last one. I can't take this anymore...
“I’m not putting myself before the whole world, John. I wanted to see a future where Setrákus Ra is killed, no matter the consequences.I wanted to see a future where someone has the guts to do what needs to be done.”–Ellla OHEMGEE!WHAT THE F JUST HAPPENED?SHE’S DEAD?!FOR REAL?*gasp*WOOH! YAY! *MC’s Corner* Note: Spoilers.• I mean… I’m not a big fan of her, even if she dead it’s not that big deal for me. *shrug*Well… just don’t make ‘him’ go berserk.I do feel like, in some way that she is kinda
OHEMGEE!WHAT THE F JUST HAPPENED?SHE’S DEAD?!FOR REAL?*gasp*WOOH!
Note: Spoilers.•	I mean… I’m not a big fan of her, even if she dead it’s not that big deal for me.
*shrug*Well… just don’t make ‘him’ go berserk.I do feel like, in some way that she is kinda hindrance to what the Garde’s mission.
#notreallydead•	Setrákus Ra… I’M NOT SO SURE IS HE TOO IS DEAD.DUH!
Though I wish Pittacus Lore, the author, will make it bloodier.
#BLOODTHIRSTYME•	I kinda wish that Mark had powers/Legacies too, like Sam. Lucky Sam.•	John’s Legacy–YES!
Just finished this book and I think my heart is broken....This one definitely felt like a built up for the next book but was actually really enjoyable and we definitely learn a lot about the past in this one.Also the ending killed me and I need the next book now :(
Now I have something to do this summer :PALSO, LORE announced that this WILL NOT BE THE FINAL BOOK. The series will be seven books long! This has been confirmed from several sources, including the publisher. That means more Nine!
This is one of my favorite dystopian series,and as usual..it is still fantastic! The entire series is beautifully written from the first book(I am Number Four),and definitely 'til the final book of this series(I do hope)!The ending of this book though is a total cliffhanger and shocked me completely! I just hope,I'm right with my own assumption and conclusion to what will happen next, on the next book.Thanks to my sister,for knowing what books I love best reading.^^
AUGUST FIRST NEXT YEAR?-GIVEITTOMENOW
4/5 StarsNO I’M NOT OKAY WITH THAT ENDING.
This book was definitely more enjoyable than 'The Revenge of Seven' but it wasn’t perfect.
Nine only appears around half way through the book which is a shame because he’s honestly the main reason why I read this series.
A change of narration would be nice, it would be interesting to be in the other characters heads instead of reading in John, Six and Ella point of views again.
But overall this book was great and definitely won’t be over this ending for a long time.
Also does Pittacus Lore not like happy couples!?
Cause it seems like it.
(view spoiler)[Honestamente estoy agradecida de que Sarah muriera, el romance con John se me hacia ridículo y odioso, gracias porque ya no tendremos escenas románticas con estos dos y si lo reconozco odio a Sarah, se me hace un parásito para John (hide spoiler)]Aunque sin duda se sentía como un acumulado para el siguiente libro, pero en realidad era muy agradable y las historias de acción aunque algo alargadas son increíbles, haciéndote que comas el libro rápidamente.
I feel like relatively less happened compared to the other books and all this stuff with Ella and Pittacus is super cool but super complicated at the same time, and I feel a little longing for the previous books in which things were a little easier and clearer.

"I wonder what will be left of us when this is over, Six. What we will be like""If there's anything left of us," I reply.
"Big if, at this point" So The Fate of Ten, 6th book in I am Number Four Series.
Seriously, this is one of the few books that no matter how tired I'am at waiting yearly, I still can't get enough of it.
I just have to get my hands on the new releases, every freaking year.
I started this series when I was in college and I never get the chance to move on.
Sure, I
Sure, I get disappointed along the way, but seriously, no matter rant I do, I'm sure as hell still going to read the next book, I'm sure, I'm still going to anticipate for the next release, like I know I'm going to do now that I finished Reading this book.What I learned after reading the other 5 books, is that, every book in this series is a total page turner, and this book is no different.
I think the series probably already hit rock bottom somewhere during books 3-5, so there's only one way to go now, right?
everyone complains like crazy when Hollywood splits the final book of a series into 2 movies, now the authors are doing it for them.
There are few things an author can do to make me hate them and their story more than write a book in present tense.
That first chapter was terribly and lazily written, and pretty much emphasized each and every complaint I have ever had about this series, and about the authors who write it.
That was a crazy ending! Had excitement and sadness. Now on to the series finale tomorrow! This series is exciting with amazingly written characters. I love the plots and the series does not get boring for a seven book series.
Not only do you get the insane non stop action from the previous books, but you also get back story on how it all started which I've been dying for since the first book in the series!
I also really loved getting to see the beginnings of Setrakus and seeing how he evolved and became such a despicable character!
Another aspect of this book that I really enjoyed was seeing how much the Lorics Legacies have evolved.
They really start coming into their powers in this book and it's truly a sight to behold!
Okay first of all, I love that we finally got some back story to everything that happened.
Not as much as I would have liked, but enough that I'm happy for the time being.I love the new characters that were introduced and I think the next book is going to be insanely good.
This one felt more filler-y and more of a set up for the final book, which I totally get, but it did also have a lot that happened.
I'm so happy about certain things and actually extremely sad about others.

FUCK YOU PHIRI DUN-RAFUCK YOU SETRAKUS RAFUCK YOU PITTACUS LOREFUCK EVERYTHINGDON'T YOU DARE KILL ADAM IN THE NEXT BOOK BECAUSE HE IS AMAZING AND DESERVES BETTERDON'T YOU DARE KILL ANYONE IN THE NEXT BOOK EXCEPT FOR PHIRI DUN-RA AND SETRAKUS RA IF HE'S NOT ALREADY DEADFUCK THIS BOOK
DON'T YOU FUCKING DARE KILL NINE.DON'T YOU FUCKING DAREand stop it, it was supossed to end in The Revenge of Seven and now we are going to have two more books? Are you trying to kill me?Again:DON'T TOUCH NINE JUST  DON'T.
I really enjoy the content of the series, but the space between me reading the books is making me disconnect.
This book is clearly setting up the grand finale in book 7 and therefore this was just a slower addition to the series.
I still enjoyed it, and I think it sets up the finale well, but overall I think it was a slower paced novel.
I can't say anything, because spoilers, but am I ever happy that event happened!I have been listening to the last few books on audio and I have the last one on hold so I will hopefully finish this series before the year is up!
Me encanto y ame todo de él, pero sin duda alguna los capítulos que más me emocionaban eran los de Elli y es que aunque sufría mucho por ella en sus capítulos, amo en lo que se convirtió.Me molesto mucho que 5 y 9 se la pasaran peleando entre ellos durante la mayor parte del libro (cuando obviamente había cosas más importantes que hacer y la testarudez de 6 y no poder dejar en paz a Strakus Ra cuando era obvio que tenían que alejarse.
Gracias Dios por no dejarme llegar a esta saga hasta que estuvo terminada.
NOOOO PLEASE NO. THE ENDING :O
What an emotional ride. I can't believe that's how this book ended still. Holy crap.
Something that annoyed me about him in book 2 the power of 2 was John's whining in this book it fit as battle fatigue pushing his power to the limit, and fight after fight.Since the last story the Mogadorians have revealed themselves to the world in the form of having war ships in the sky and attacking New York.
However with the Mog army already in place and the Grades (Lorien and human), spread all over the world is it too little too late?This book has it all great character development coming together, revelations, new grades, new legacies, politics and sacrifice.
She realizes that she has some powers and she is going to use it on the Mogs.Sam and John are still fighting along with some survivors they saved.
When John wakes up again he finds that the news is reporting two Garde fighting.
Sam and John go to get them.Six, Marina, and Adam exit The Sanctuary.
Adam thinks that he might be able to build them a new part.
Like a lot of people I just assumed that Eight was able to transfer his Legacies into Sam. Which is what happened with Adam.The Entity was utterly useless!
It wasn’t superb like how I found the second instalment in the series (Power of six) but it also didn’t suck as much as some of the other novels did.
Google/youtube it, it really through me off of this series for a while.Spoilers below!!I always thought Sarah was just an okay character, so her death actually was very satisfying because I know it’s going to derail John (number 4) and perhaps some new relationships will emerge (although he may just throw himself into learning new legacies and helping train the new grade).
G!Fate of Ten still shows the struggle of Garde along with their human friends, separated from each other in three different groups, against Sétrakus Ra and the Mogs.Unsurprisingly, Pittacus Lore impressed me yet again with his book.
On every page, I found myself biting my nails and eager to turn the page.Novel was in John and Six's PoV, who are both my favorite characters.
I love each and every character.
Cuz John (and rest of the Garde) is comin' for you!
*grins evilly* (hide spoiler)]The next and the final book?
Next year?!
One whole freaking year!!
