He uses quite the tricks in this book, at many points in describing his socialism it feels like his socialism is the true form of liberalism, that the rule of the law, knowledge and basic human rights are all not real in the liberal world and that only his socialism will truly have those...But in the few rare moments he speacks about the implementation of this the ugly face of totalitarianism and the contradiction with the basic human rights and liberties show up.
The entire book is based on one belief, "What if the world was under a new world order, one in which unite the everyone in the world, and at the same time cause war to war to no longer exist?"  But for peace to exist on our modern day society, it would be impossible because everyone would want more than their fair share.
For example, if there was no death, then the death rate of the average person would highly increase, and humans would only die due to natural causes;old age, smoking, cancer,etc.
Inevitably, in this story, the struggle with the acquisition of ultimate power and what is to be done about it, becomes the primary theme of the novel.I chose to read Well’s, rather short, non-fiction work “A New World Order” believing it might serve as a companion work to “Holy Terror” as it was published just a year later in 1940.
It's surprising that this book isn''t better known because it is careful to differentiate between a collective society which really works for everyone and a socialist "utopia" which is stuck in class war and fails partly because it ignores humanity's baser instincts.
Perhaps that is why, maybe people like their politics simple and this doesn't accept the right-left split.
Occasionally, the mistake changes the sense of the point, so you can work out what it's meant to say.
It's a simple case of this book being checked by program and not by a person, so "ear" is accepted, when it should be "era".
Wells considers it an offense against all mankind if capitalists amass wealth by hoarding the Earth's resources for profits.
He considers a world collectivist, socialist government the solution to these abusers.
However, what he fails to realize is that it's not the underlying system that propagates evil, it is human nature that is evil.
Evil people will amass exorbitant wealth through whatever system is given to them.
Capitalism and socialism both end up with abusers at the top taking advantage of all social classes, because people are the problem and not the solution.
This is propaganda in favor of global governance. Although I personally believe this would be a bad idea Wells is very persuasive in his arguments even though the arguments are harsh.
Public domain work...lesser known. Worth the read.
