Probably my favorite slovenian book! There is something about a father chopping of his sons pinky finger that gets my interest. The first half describes a family dynamic, while the other half focuses on a witch-trial. Both are very interesting topics and very well written.
I really like the story. This book is a work of art!
Ok, stil je pač karkšen je, ampak zgodba je pa luštna. Konec sem prebrala še precej pod vtisom gledališke uprizoritve (SNG Drama) in še toliko bolj uživala. Slovenska klasika.

It was pretty good book.
it was honestly not that bad, i'm pleasantly surprised
The witchcraft aspect of it was interesting, but for the most part it just dragged on.
I had to read it for school but it was not that bad after all. I was surprised because I had expected less from it.
