Such people can become really dangerous really fast.Luckily for Leeds he had a niece who had a rebel idea that the guy was entitled to spend his money the way he wanted, even by marrying a woman who looked like a typical gold-digger.
This time Mason really earned his money, the hard way.First he had to extract Leeds from the mental asylum where his loving relatives put him.
A private detective Paul Drake, another main character of the series who does the legwork for Mason finally was able to get to eat in style - the way high-class lawyers eat - a couple of times.
In the eighty-five books in this series, Mason's clients are virtually all very wealthy people, living in large houses with all kinds of servants and extended family members.
(It's the extended family members that are usually the problem.) Only in a handful of books does Perry ever represent someone who is genuinely poor, and even then, there's almost always a rich person lurking in the background who will write Mason a very generous check once the case is over.Which is a very good thing, because Perry's monthly nut must be enormous.
Is there a twist in a plot so complicated even Perry Mason can't solve it?
Set in 1939 or 1940 the story seems to be about an man of some wealth who is being imposed upon by grasping relatives who are trying to prevent his marriage to an 'unsuitable' woman; as well as preserve their position as heirs.
But who was killed?
And was anyone killed and who did the crime?
And now a man with three different identities is dead, but who killed him and why?
Perry does make it to the court room but only for a preliminary hearing.
***.A reader always manages to learn something by reading a Perry Mason novel.
The doctor tried to justify his actions by recording that the patient had specific mental problems.
Mason, however, did his homework, and showed that the condition cited by the doctor could not be the case because of other indications.
We learned about the presence of arcus senilis which truly indicated his real problem.
It became even more of an issue when it was learned that the judge in this case also had the presence of this symptom – and had had it for twenty-two years!
The legal aspects of courtroom drama---however overblown---are the perfect environment in which to yank the reader's chain from anxiety to anxiety, page after page, plot twist after plot twist.Yank, yank, yank.This one's a little difficult to follow because he uses the same relationship trick---a younger, poorer woman being prevented by jealous family from marrying an older, much richer man---twice.
And also I thought my solution had a great angle Gardner didn't, unfortunately, use.
Plus I like ole Ned the prospector.(The truth about Gardner is I have actually always hated courtroom drama and have, therefore, avoided him for thirty years.
I've always held the opinion that Perry Mason in his books with elements of gambling tends to go all overboard in spinning the yarn.
A 70 year old is institutionalised in a sanitarium by his distant relatives who don't want him to marry 'the woman'.
'The Woman' thinks the 70 year old is blackmailed and in walks in Perry Mason.
But then there is a body, loaded dice, lottery tickets, a 50 year old murder, lying women, missing people etcI found the book had too many characters to my liking and a couple of red herrings too along the way.
There was a spicy synopsis on the back, and a wonderfully lurid cover with a pair of dice rolling out from a dead man's hand, the snake-eyes replaced by grinning skulls.
And then the best part.
A list of all the characters with snappy descriptions (Della Street - who is not only Mason's girl Friday but all other days of the week), and best of all, the page number where the character first appears!!!!
For Olds like myself, this is perfection itself.So a quote, because Gardner may not have been at Hammett levels, but he had his moments."Well, John knew that I had spotted the dice.
Not among Gardner's better work. Convoluted plot, with too many characters and one of them with far too many aliases.
This book is an another enjoyable case which involves a wealthy 72 year old man whose relatives are trying to prevent his marriage as well as to maintain their position as his heirs. The man gets embroiled in the murder of his colleague who was blackmailing him. Perry Mason,the lawyer unwinds the mystery & proves his client innocent. One has to read carefully in order to follow the twists of this fast paced mystery. EXCITING.
A wealthy man wishes to marry, but his family assume that she's after his money. The lock him in a sanatorium, Perry Mason is asked by his niece to help. However, the case turns into murder, characters who are not who they say they are and gold.Entertaining as always, but you need to follow the plot.
I LOVE PERRY MASON.
Several of the more striking incidents from the files of Perry Mason transpire in this story. Not only "Where's the fire?" and "That's him!" but also the arcus senilus testimony scene. My note shows it was 2002 the last time I read this, but those clever little plot points, as well as the way Perry figures out how the time of death has been confused, I greeted as old friends.
Some of the logic was hard to follow, but a good story nonetheless.
Wow! Extremely complex story with too many side stories weaved together, too much to make a single timeline of past events and hence make sense of what happened when and why and how and by whome the murder was committed.But do not worry, its narrated equally extremely well, so you can keep up and guess the murderer. And its interesting how Mason manages to "kill one bird with two stones". :)Very well written whodunit mystery. Do read.
I just could not get into this one. You need to chart everything, especially the precise timing of the murder, which I did not have the patience to do. There is one character with three identities, and somehow this story was just too hard to follow. Having finished it yesterday, I can't remember "who did it" or why.
Too many aliases and too many logical solutions! It seemed like a very much over thought plot. A one sided affair, where the author kept just too many doors open for him to dodge through.The end was also very 'Poirot'ish. Looked more like a detective story than a legal-detection one.
Wickedly clever entry that plays cards with the best of them. Balances red herrings really well, and gives Mason some of his best put downs, even if the conclusion makes about as much (or as little) sense as the rest of it.
It involves the apparent situation where a man was murdered twice, once in Alaska and once in California.
The accused is a former gold miner that struck it rich with his partner in Alaska and the two of them apparently engaged in a fight to the death over the affections of a dance hall girl.
The plot moves along quickly and like so many Mason stories, his success is partially based on the incompetence of the officers of the law.
This is one of the better Mason stories, an impossible situation is resolved through a set of simple explanations of events that were designed to throw off suspicion.
There was a LOT of food in this book, but also switched identities...so much so that you just couldn't keep it all straight, which took away from the story line.
Women are "Janes." And we first learn of Paul Drakes habit of chewing two pieces of gum at the same time to burn off his pent up energy while doing desk work, and multiple telephones, finding the "clews" to the case.
I wonder if Paul cracks his gum?
The book was written in 1939, if I remember correctly, and it was also fun -- even strange -- to travel back to a different time when people called police cars "prowl cars," might say "that's mighty white of you" upon receiving an unexpected favor and thought nothing about lighting up a cigarette (even in a courtroom).
The word "cigarette" appears over 40 times in the book!I read the book in spurts, and I found it a little difficult to follow - there were many characters, some with secrets and fake identities.
It was also a little difficult to distinguish between what Perry knew, what he suspected and what he wanted others to think he knew.
An unusual aspect in this above average series entry, in that in addition to establishing his client's innocence, Perry must spring him from a sanitarium.Perry Mason series - Years ago Alden Leeds found a rich vein of gold in the Klondike.
Now his greedy relatives fear he's planning to throw his fortune away on a gold-digger, Emily Milicant.
Leeds escapes, only to end up in the company of Emily's blackmailing brother, John, a manufacturer of fixed dice.
But when John is murdered—with Leeds's fingerprints found all over the apartment—Perry Mason must crack a baffling case before his client bumps from the nut house to the jail house.
This my second Gardner book and first Perry Mason.
I was disappointed but not surprised to discover that Mason is in the mold of other cookie-cutter hotshots of the era.
Good writing, complex plot, tortured exposition.
While I tend to breeze through the mysteries I read, I cannot recall ever being as befuddled as I was with this book.
I have nothing against a complex plot, but the extraordinary obfuscation in The Case of the Rolling Bones was unwarranted.
Were it buoyed by a more interesting or valuable story, it might be worth puzzling out, but attached as it was to a professional but run-of-the-mill mystery, the murkiness of the plot was a real turn-off.
I listened to this book in audio form and I would definitely recommend against it; what with the number of switched identities and aliases, this is a book that works better in printed form. I can't even exactly describe what the book is about, except that an elderly man disappears and his family (?) is concerned that a woman is taking advantage of him, and in the past that same man was in the Klondike with a friend and greed and jealousy led to a lot of switched names and identities.
Perry Mason mysteries are my comfort read. They are not great reads nor are they great mysteries--think Twinkies in book form. This is pretty ordinary as far as the series goes. One note though(view spoiler)[If I'm not mistaken, the idea of the thrown away meal was used in a Christie Poiret story first. Who knew ESG was a bit of a plot thief? (hide spoiler)]
really good, for Erle Stanley Gardner. Like all of the earlier books, he is concerned with pointing out loopholes in CA law and unfairnesses in the legal system. and the plotting is neat with convincing clues--something that went completely out the window in his later books.
This is a really, really confusing case with many people assuming multiple aliases and two murders of the same person. It's a TV episode and, as I recall, pretty confusing that way too. The "rolling bones" have virtually nothing to do with the story.
Too many details to keep track of but as usual good.
Another great read. On to #16
My Rating System:* couldn't finish, ** wouldn't recommend, *** would recommend, **** would read again, ***** have read again.
I hadn't read a Perry Mason story for a long time. It's certainly dated but a pretty good tale.
