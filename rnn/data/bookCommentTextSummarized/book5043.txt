Ο Ξανθός ΈκμπερτΗ γυναίκα του Έκμπερτ διηγείται ένα βράδυ στον σύζυγο της και τον μοναδικό του φίλο Βάλτερ μια αλλόκοτη ιστορία.
Ο Έκμπερτ θα αντιληφθεί πως η μοίρα του έχει παίξει ένα περίεργο αλλά και σατανικό παιχνίδι...Το ΡούνενμπεργκΟ νεαρός Κρίστιαν εγκαταλείπει το σπίτι του για να περιπλανηθεί μέσα στην φύση και τα στοιχειωμένα δάση της γερμανικής επαρχίας.
Θα συνεχίσει κανονικά την ζωή του θα παντρευτεί, θα φιλιώσει με τον πατέρα του αλλά εν τέλει θα καταλάβει ότι η γνωριμία του με την μυστήρια γυναίκα εκείνο το βράδυ θα τον στοιχειώνει για πάντα...Ο Τηκ γράφει δυο εξαιρετικά διηγήματα, δυο παραμύθια που δημιουργούν μια ευχάριστη ανατριχίλα στον αναγνώστη και διεισδύουν σε περιοχές της ψυχής όπου καμιά άλλη μορφή τέχνης ή λογοτεχνίας δεν μπορεί να φτάσει.
A classic of German romantacism, in my opinion. Especially Der Blonde Eckbert...witches, mountains, incest, and birds that talk!
Regarding the first of these two, this is a tale that will first make you go "huh?" and then, when you read it a second time, you start noticing all these little details and clues which point towards how the story's going to end.
Does he really deserve to descend into madness like that?These two tales are definitely interesting reads, in particular when you try to get to the bottom of them.
And since I rate stories according to the enjoyment I had reading them, it had to be three stars.
Wunderbares Beispiel für die Erzählkunst der Romantik.
Definitiv kein typisches Volksmärchen ...Bei einem gemütlichen Beisammensein Eckberts, seiner Frau Bertha und seinem guten Freund Walther erzählte Bertha von ihrer Jugend.
Daraufhin begann Eckbert an seinem Vertrauen zu Walther zu zweifeln, denn die Geschichte ist sonderbar und er glaubte eine Veränderung im Verhalten seines Freundes ihm gegenüber zu erkennen.
Da fand er einen neuen Freund, dem er bald so viel vertraute, dass er ihm von der Jugend seiner Frau und dem Mord an seinem Freund erzählen konnte.
Ziemlich schnell verlor er auch das Vertrauen zu seinem neuen Freund und flüchtete daraufhin in den Wald.
(and i kid you not they kind of made me wonder if i might like the modern horror genre bc these are basically super disturbing fairytales and i....Love well written disturbing stuff it gives me life)the first one was my favorite.
the gradual slippage from peace and wonder to fear, mistrust and insanity, until like the main character you cant tell whats real and what isnt and feel trapped in this sort of nightmareish inescapability (the ending is so intense even though i knew what it was bc i already read a summary, so....yeah.),nature in its idyllic beauty but also as an almost demonic force that demands retribution, the haunting thought that some secrets may be better left untold.
Beide Geschichten erzählen eine Art Märchen, es versammeln sich dabei einige gruselige und schaurige Elemente.
Ideal when you're doing research and need background noises 😅
mit diesen geschichten lernt man die romantik lieben
With Der blonde Eckbert and Der Runenberg, Tieck presents two sides of the same coin; the same story told twice but each with opposing ideological views.
Der Runenberg could be seen to represent Hobbe's point of view, that people join together in a society to avoid the savagery of nature.
In Der Runenberg, it's the mysterious allures of nature that bring about the protagonists downfall, whereas in Der blonde Eckbert, the conflict arises from intimacy and confidentiality.With these two short narratives, Tieck examines the effects of society on man in a magical and imaginative style.
Just der blonde Eckbert
Ich habe nur den Runenberg für die Uni gelesen und bin noch etwas unschlüssig darüber, was ich denke.. ich glaube die Geschichte muss man mehrmals lesen um die ganzen Tiefen zu verstehen
Uni Lektüre
Absolutely adored this for some reason... German readings are getting to me
Der Runenberg was the subject of my senior thesis for my B.A. in the Honours Division Department of German, Scandinavian and Dutch, at the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities. I don't remember exactly what it was about, but I'm sure it had something to do with intrusive narrators in German Romanticism, desire and the subconscious, projection and madness, the high vs. low physical space occupied by angelic/virtuous vs. demonic/sexually desireable women, and music. It probably had a lot of Foucault, Lacan, and Barthes in the list of references. I'm sure it was fascinating....
We've only read the first story, "Der blonde Eckbert", in school and for once I thought it OK. Nothing really special but not too bad to read either.Not sure if I'll read "Der Runenberg", but I'm at least considering it for a time when I'm in a very good reading mood.
Possibly my favorite sentence ever written in the German language: "Eckbert lag wahnsinnig und verscheidend auf dem Boden; dumpf und verworren hörte er die Alte sprechen, den Hund bellen, und den Vogel sein Lied wiederholen."
I liked this book because it holds such a crazy story :))
I previously rated Der blonde Eckbert as 3 stars. Don't remember it much, but I just read the second part, Der Runenberg, and thought it was pretty interesting. May have to re-read Eckbert now.
I read this for my German class. It was pretty enjoyable. But all I can really say is that I did NOT expect it to end with incest! WOW.
This book was in a lot of ways pretty bad ass.
Reread this today, just for fun, because for some reason, I really loved the whole story. There's something catchy about it.
This time I've read "Der Runenberg"
3,5
Ahhh, German Romanticism...
