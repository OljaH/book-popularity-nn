Lol, 1st book for the Booktube-A-Thon complete!
She lives next door to the Gregg family who like to hunt for fun and this makes her very angry.
She doesn’t think it’s right for people to hunt animals for fun and when she gets angry, her finger takes control.
Her magic finger has a special lesson in store, but the big problem is not knowing exactly what will happen when she uses it.The story teaches a huge lesson to do unto others as you would have them do unto you.
It will also get you thinking about why it’s important to control your disposition because actions always have consequences.5*****
Written in 1964 Roald Dahl's 'The Magic Finger' is a lesson well taught through a little girls magical finger. This lovely children's book is illustrated throughout by Quentin Blake. This was my second Roald Dahl book and I am looking forward to reading many more. Highly recommended!
The titular "Magic Finger" is an ability she has that activates inadvertently whenever she gets intensely angry: the finger shoots out a beam of energy that apparently seeks out whoever has angered the girl, with unpredictable consequences.تاریخ نخستین خوانش: روز بیست و دوم ماه ژوئن سال 2000 میلادیعنوان: انگشت جادویی؛ اثر: رولد دال؛ تصویرگر: کوئنتین بلیک؛ برگردان: گیتا گرگانی؛ مشخصات نشر: تهران، نشر چشمه، کتاب ونوشه، 1378، در 66 ص، مصور، کتابهای کودکان و نوجوانان، شابک: 9645571324، چاپ سوم زمستان 1386، موضوع: ادبیات نوجوان، داستانهای نویسندگان انگلیسی، سده 20 مماجرای دختر هشت ساله ‌ای ست، که هرگاه از کاری یا کسی ناراحت ‌شود، به گفته ی خودش، خون جلوی چشم‌هایش را می‌گیرد، اگر انگشتش را به سوی آنها که اذیتش کرده ‌اند، بگیرد، رخداد غریبی رخ می‌دهد.
Remind me not to piss off this girlThe Girl with the Magic Finger often lashes out.
The Gregg family loves to hunt - oftentimes for sport rather than need - and the poor girl has to watch them bring in all these dead animals every week.
She witnesses the Gregg family kill bird after bird (bringing home sixteen of them one day) and in her anger, she points at them with that magic finger.
I do agree that over-hunting for fun should always be avoided but to paint the family as that bad?
There is a girl who has a magical finger.
We don't know her name.
Anyway, it doesn't matter because she is just a narrator of the book.This book is about Mr. Gregg and his family.
They hunt for pleasure.
The Girl, our narrator, forbids them but they don't listen.
And by accident, her finger magically turns them into the bird.
After that they face hardships of bird's life and get to know that how it feels to face a gun.This is a children book.
Of course it's a children book.
So it doesn't feel that bad.
Plus, you never know when your psycho neighbor is going to flip out and and punish you with her "Magic Finger" (does that sound dirty to anyone else?).
The magic isn't developed, and we don't spend enough time with the narrator to know her or care about her.
The way in which the narrator characterized her magic finger as something outside herself and not under her control, while Dahl makes it clear that her feelings direct what happens, could have led to a really interesting psychological examination of anger and action and valuable points about responsibility and self-control.
Stay out of her way - or she'll zap you! The book The Magic Finger is a wonderful story about controlling your temper from the ever-exuberant and humorous Roald Dahl. Up there in the second tier of my favourite Dahl books!
Not Roald Dahl at his finest - nevertheless a good short entertaining book with the usual great illustrations by Quentin Blake. For anyone who doesn't agree with hunting birds for 'sport'.......For anyone who ever got angry and wanted revenge.......
پایین را نگاه کنیدآن پایین، چهار اردک تفنگ ایستاده بودند و سه تای آنها تفنگ داشتند.
تفنگ ها درست لانه را نشانه رفته بودندآقا و خانم گرگ هردو باهم فریاد زدند: نه!
خواهش میکنم شلیک نکنیدیکی از اردگ ها گفت: چرا شلیک نکنیم؟ شما همیشه به ما شلیک می کنیدآقای گرگ گفت: اما فرق می کند!
ما اجازه داریم به اردک ها شلیک کنیماردک پرسید: کی این اجازه را به شما می دهد؟آقای گرگ گفت: ما به هم اجازه می دهیماردک گفت: خیلی خوب است.
و حالا ما خیال داریم به همدیگر اجازه بدهیم که به شما شلیک کنیمخانم گرگ فریاد زد: وای، خواهش می کنم!
The main character lives next door to a family that loves to hunt birds.
She doesn't like that they are hurting animals, so she tries to talk them out of it, but they only laugh at her.
Then one day the family goes too far and kills a ton of birds.
She didn't mean to turn her magic finger on the family, but when the little girl is angry her Magic Finger takes over.
It turned the family into birds!
I suggest this book to anyone that likes short stories and Roald Dahl's amazing writing :)
It's almost tradition that the first book of the year is one by Roald Dahl.
Both boys go hunting with their dad every day, which doesn't sit right with the girl since killing animals just for fun is wrong (I completely agree).But this is no normal girl because she has the titular magic finger and when she gets angry ...The story is a classic but no less wonderful tale of the value of life and how humans often think animals less.
As usual in Roald Dahl's stories, they are being taught the error of their ways - and in a pretty funny way too.
Not my favourite Roald Dahl, it wasn't quite as magical or memorable as Matilda or Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, nevertheless it was still a quick, fun story about talking ducks and a girl with a magic finger.
The reader learns of a secret power possessed by the narrator, whereby an itching feeling from the tip of the finger leads to a small white flash and then all is changed for the better.
Having learned their lesson, the Greggs try to regain some sense of normalcy in their lives, while also seeking to make a change for the better.
Perfect for a coffee break or a snuggle up with some younger ones before bed.Dahl knows how to pull on all aspects of story writing to keep children interested while also bringing forth important lessons.
I never got around to reading this one as a kid - the library didn't have a copy and it looks like I never found it in a second-hand bookstore.
No. The Magic Finger is the story of an unnamed girl.
The girl has a magic finger which blasts people for being asses.
There's a little backstory, how she got her teacher, and then it's onto the main event - a hunter and his boys who shoot ducks.
This makes the girl angry!Simple, moral, a touch of Dahl.
But, despite the title, no magic - no Dahl magic.
I just listened to this on YouTube ... another brilliant story from Roald Dahl.
The Magic Finger was another long distance buddy read with my seven year old niece, Daisy.
We both enjoyed this, but not as much as Esio Trot.
Daisy loved that Mr and Mrs Gregg changed their surname to Egg. We both thought it was a shame that Girl didn’t have a proper name of her own, so we decided to call her Maddy Finkley, as it sounds a little bit like magic finger.
I can certainly think of a few occasions in the past when a magic finger would have come in useful.
Overall, this was a 4 star read for both of us.
One of the more unknown of Dahl's stories and one I hadn't actually heard of before, but then I'm not so well versed in Roald Dahl's works as I always thought I was.It's a good storyline with a lovely moral, but still quite simplified and I think maybe more could have been made of it.
Perhaps, because of the theme of guns and hunting, it needed to be shorter for a children's book.
It was written much like his others, so there is not much to compare with, but it lacked the whimsy and grace as his others.Blog | Instagram | Twitter | Pinterest | Shop | Etsy
This funny short novel was about animal rights.
This is a book about a girl who punishes a family who hunts using her magic finger. In the end, the family vows never to hunt again. But my question still remains: plenty of people who read this book eat meat, yet agree that the hunters should be punished. But should they? What's the difference between eating meat and hunting your own meat? At least they know the animals weren't tortured or abused. Maybe I'm reading too much into this...
I finished The Magic Finger by Raold Dahl in only 28 minutes! It's great! I have whole set of Roald Dahl books! And I have seen most of the movies!👆The Magic Finger is a great juvenile fiction. These kind of short stories are the best ones! THUMBS UP👍

This is a short story which can easily be read to a child in one sitting, with lots of pictures. The story is an anti-hunting for sport story, where a family who hunt get an idea of how it must feel to be their prey. My children (aged 8 and 6) really enjoyed this story.
What goes around, comes around in this incredible story by the very talented Roald Dahl.
I think part of the magic of Roald Dahl is that you’re never too old to enjoy his stories! No matter how old you are, they’re just so fun to read and to get into. What I particularly enjoy about this story is the way things are turned around on the bad guys, they have a taste of their own medicine and realize how hard it is to swallow. But despite having a moral, the story is still so lighthearted and fun!
More bedtime reading fun to my little ones. This one a short read with an anti-gun and hunting message
In this story, the people who get punished are her neighbours, the Greggs - they hunt animals, which the narrator doesn’t agree with at all.
Compared to what I remember of Dahl favourites like Matilda and George’s Marvellous Medicine though, The Magic Finger doesn’t have a lot of depth and it was over far too quickly for the story to have much impact on me.Recommended for: people looking for a quick-to-read and fun children’s tale with a good moral.~~~~~Review also posted here.
Simplistic:This book has an agenda which is anti-gun and anti-hunting.
The affected family is taught a lesson by a young girl who cannot control either her temper or her "magic finger".
None of these have taken pleasure in harming animals and have considered their lifestyle including hunting as a necessity in feeding their families.Deeper:Is it too simplistic to think that there is only one "lesson" to be learned?
The unnamed girl seems to be taking pleasure in pointing her finger at others.
You know what they say about pointing at someone else?
There are three fingers pointing back at you!
Reread this because I actually forgot most of the book. I had this read to me in elementary school and all I remember was a girl with magic powers. I think I liked it better after a second read. I had forgotten she turned a family into ducks.
I wish I had "THe magic finger" everytime I see red! Oooh, I'll be having lots of fun!The message about hunting and killing animals just for sport is clear and I totally agree with it.
