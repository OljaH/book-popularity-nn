As much as I liked the first part I was weary that maybe this second and third part would just be repetitious. I was really pleased to find it just kept building on itself and, although a bit too outlandish for me at times, I was still drawing greater and greater insights. Really amazing series, but again, the long speeches can sometimes be a chore despite being interesting.
I enjoyed all six books of this series. The are mind expanded and I have refereed back to them on many occasions. They are a permanent members of my library and I recommend them to anyone looking for who and what they are.
Sometimes I can’t tell whether it’s the author or me, the reader, who cools down with the second book in a series. Although enlightening, this volume offers a little less in terms of story line and purpose of the protagonist other than witness. Still worth the read and has a valuable message but it’s a story of fiction all the same and this one lacks the structure needed to carry a readers interest through.
Another great storyI have learned a lot about ancient civilizations by reading this book. The story is easy to follow and understand. Highly recommended for anyone interested in the mystical.
This is a good example of early-mid 20th century spiritual writing and a prime example of an excellent spiritual grifter at work...Mr. Spalding had not been to India and was too young to have gone at the time if he had wanted to...he had doctored both his date of birth and where he was at the times.
There are some fascinating archaeological theories here too, but their dates are wildly inaccurate.
Beware: Attitudes are those of the early and mid 20th century and a benign racism crops up again and again.
this series of books are an amazing ride. so interesting, so enlightening. you MUST read them!
Same as my review of the first volume. Reviewed.
