despite being wrong in almost all of his economic theories, keynes knows how to rock out the philosophy of probability. i'm a big fan of this book.
Available to read free in public domain on Project Gutenberg here.
Deep, thoughtful approach to the logicist foundations of probability. Unconventional by current standards. Stimulating. Not a good intro for a novice.
