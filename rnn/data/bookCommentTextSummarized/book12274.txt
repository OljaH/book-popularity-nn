Meanwhile, in a time of war, the nation was beginning to view the mafia rather than Cowboys as the great American hero.
In Don Corleone, Mario Puzo has created a persona who shifts people's views of the role of the mafia.
After three sequels, including the second part which also garnered awards, Puzo's ground breaking work lead to generations of mafia and crime family movies, most recently the Sopranos.
Yet, there would be no Tony Soprano if Mario Puzo had not created Vito Corleone and his world, changing people's views of the mafia.
The Italian-American boss Vito Corleone, during the celebrations for his daughter's wedding, agrees to meet some Italian emigrants that ask for his help.
Thus begins Mario Puzo's masterpiece, whose movie adaptation made Marlon Brando's interpretation of Don Vito famous.
It comes out the best cross-section of the Italian-American subculture never done before, and probably never equaled.The wisdom of Don Vito Corleone is disarming, it arouses feelings of respect also in the readers, making the godfather one of the most charismatic characters ever.Vote: 9New York, 1945.
Inizia così il capolavoro di Mario Puzo, la cui trasposizione cinematografica ha reso celebre l'interpretazione di Marlon Brando nei panni di Don Vito.

Who's German-Irish, btw, and works as a lawyer in the "family business".Don Vito is a very powerful and respected "wise old man".
Everything he does is different from his family - he goes to college, joins an army to fight for America and plans to marry a girl who doesn't carry a drop of Italian blood in her, Kay. He starts out as a hero that night, saving his father's life by moving his bed to another room and standing guard on the hospital stairs, displaying qualities (bravery, calculative and cool head under pressure, etc.) that make him an apparent "heir to the throne".
The novel covers the years 1945 to 1955, and also provides the back story of Vito Corleone from early childhood to adulthood.تاریخ نخستین خوانش: دوازدهم ماه جولای سال 1992 میلادیعنوان: پدر خوانده؛ نوشته: ماریو پوزو؛ ترجمه: آذرمیدخت بهزادی؛ تهران، نشر علم، 1370عنوان: پدر خوانده - ویتوکورلیونه - دن ویتونه؛ نوشته: ماریو پوزو - فرانسیس فورد کاپولا؛ ترجمه: علیرضا شمیرانی؛ تهران، پارینه، 1376عنوان: پدر خوانده؛ نوشته: ماریو پوزو؛ ترجمه: حجت الله سلیمانی؛ تهران، جاده ابریشم، 1377، در 40 ص؛ شابک: 9646225322؛ عنوان: پدر خوانده؛ نوشته: ماریو پوزو؛ ترجمه: محمد پورفر؛ تهران، نشرگستر، 1388، در 465 ص؛ شابک: 9789645544896؛ عنوان: پدر خوانده؛ نوشته: ماریو پوزو؛ ترجمه: جبیب الله شهبازی؛ تهران، نشر افق، 1388، در 748 ص؛ شابک: 9789643695729؛ چاپ دیگر: 1395، در 600 ص؛عنوان: پدر خوانده؛ نوشته: ماریو پوزو؛ ترجمه: منیژه اذکایی؛ تهران، نیلوفر، 1395، در 580 ص؛ شابک: 9789644486975؛ پدر ویتو کورلئونه با شخصی در دهکده درگیر میشود و آن شخص به مافیا شکایت میبرد.

“He smelled the garden, the yellow shield of light smote his eyes, and he whispered, "Life is so beautiful."
Or Hollywood heart-throb Johnny Fontaine?
Interesting to note are: the general absence of Fredo, the omnipresence of Johnny Fontaine...
the Hollywood sex parties in detail (and how's this for risqué [and appropriate to the season]: Best Actor & Best Actress in public sex), plus invaluable insights (like the entire Book V, largely absent from the beloved film) as bizarre as sexual readjustment surgeries and as natural as mob allegiances in Vegas.
This is a classic train of portraits of a kingdom in steep decline, of its vindication and revolution, rife with those beloved Shakespearean precepts like corruption, revenge & fate.
Puzo seems to think the reader needs a reminder of plot points that occured ten pages ago, and that unnecessarily drawing out an obvious reveal by splitting it up into three points of view counts as suspense.Or I could give you a thorough cataloguing of how very poser-y The Godfather, with its bombastic ideas of masculinity and supposed gritty crime plotlines.
What other possible characteristics could any woman have that would be more important than that?Do I really need to say more?*It was this or an haiku about watching the pages burn, but I don't believe in book burning and I could never top Bradbury anyway, so this is what you get instead.
4.8 'Mario Puzo should have won a Nobel Prize for this book' stars.And aside of the Blackwood sisters from We Have Always Lived in the Castle by Shirley Jackson, I honestly hadn't met characters as seductive as the Corleone Family for a long time. In fact, this book is just so insanely good! Just like the movie! It's damn near perfection! It deserves all the stars in the night sky! "I would make my escape.... I would be rich, famous, happy." -Mario Puzo (from "Choosing A Dream") “Tell my father
4.8 'Mario Puzo should have won a Nobel Prize for this book' stars.And aside of the Blackwood sisters from We Have Always Lived in the Castle by Shirley Jackson, I honestly hadn't met characters as seductive as the Corleone Family for a long time.
I mean, their stories are still interesting, but their story lines feel a bit more like drag-ons.(2) How women had been treated: unsurprisingly, women can only be obedient housewives and daughters who don't have any say in the family business and any of the important decisions (and aside from Kate, no woman has ever questioned this even so slightly in the book).
Like they shoulda stopped Hitler at Munich, they should never let him get away with that, they were just asking for big trouble when they let him get away with that.You know that you are a Czech person when this is your favourite quote/sentence(s) from the whole book.
This is a masterpiece!But I need to say that I don't like Kay. I don't think she and Michael could function together.
And, in the beginning, I believe Michael liked Kay's progressiveness, but I wonder how he saw it after the time with Apollonia.And, there is only one man named Clemenza for me.
You’re standing at the water cooler at work, and a coworker comes up to you and says “Boy, The English Patient is an excellent movie!” And maybe you say something back like “Michael Ondaatje’s Booker-Prize winning novel is far superior.” At that point, your coworker calls you a “pretentious snob” and you respond with “sewer-dwelling ignorance peddler.” There is some cursing.
Even if you haven’t read the book or seen the movie, you probably know all the plot points, character beats, and one liners.
Actual Rating: 4.5 StarsI think this is just what I was in the mood for!
It was a very good book. Alhamdulillah. I can't wait to get 'The Family Corleone' and 'The Sicilian' books.My favourite characters are Vito Corleone/Godfather and Michael Corleone.'The Godfather and The Godfather part 2' movies were awesome. 'The Godfather part 3' was pointless! The only part I actually enjoy watched 'The Godfather part 3' was 15 minutes before at the end of the film.
*****5 PORQUE NO LE PUEDO DAR MÁS PUNTUACIÓN stars.*****    Review in my account bookstagram      Hilo en twitter de El Padrino       “Cada hombre tiene un solo destino.”  ¿Qué se puede decir además que es una obra maestra? ¿Por qué no hay más estrellas para calificar éste libro?El Padrino es un libro que nunca se me habría ocurrido leer, no es que pensara que fuera aburrido, simplemente que lo compré más por su fama, lo archive en mi librero y nunca le di tanta importancia o pensé que llenaría
A pesar de que la familia está festejando, Vito Corleone aprovecha algunos momentos para hablar de negocios con sus amigos.
Esto hace que la mafia italiana tenga una escala de valores interesante para ser un grupo criminal y que desde las primeras páginas El Padrino sea un personaje interesante con una genialidad increíble.
Contrario a lo que yo pensaba antes de iniciar este libro, en estas páginas se les da más protagonismo a tres personajes a lo largo de toda esta historia y Vito queda en segundo plano.
What really intrigues me about Puzo's presentation of the Corleone family, and something that does not translate as explicitly to the screen, is the incredible sense of moral and religious conviction that what they do is right and good.
Puzo does everything in this book; action, drama, romance, epic, humanity, pulp, and he does it all effortlessly.
One minute you're reading about a fictional mafioso and the next minute you realize you've stumbled on one of the great literary accomplishments of the century.
No single literary character is as conflicting for me as Michael Corleone.
New Brilliant Future Career Idea: mafia wife. Think about it - all you have to do is cook, have some babies, and go to Mass once a day. Sure, I might have a hard time learning to never ask questions about anything, but I could always get a hobby to occupy my time with. At the very least, being a mafia wife would give me tons of free time to finish The List. It's win-win, really.
Wounded war Vet Rocco Lampone, and the tough Luca Bracsi.The Godfather starts in a 1945 New York.
The dilema of getting into drug trade and betrayal are at the heart of this literature classic.The reason that the Godfather is so good is the depth of Mario Puzo's characters.
Puzo romanticises the mafia life and that time period altogether.He also does something perfectly what other books have tried to do and miserably failed at.

Don Vito, Sonny, Fredo, Michael, Tom, Clemenza, Tessio, Luca Brasi, the entire family, they're like the Cosbys.
Okay, maybe they're not like the Cosbys.
It's pretty common knowledge that one of the vital points in writing a successful novel is creating unforgettable characters.
And the Corleone Family, they're real hard to forget.
(Well, Fredo, not so much.) I do think that this is the book's strongest point.
These two redeem the book from the sometimes cliche lines and a little sloppy writing.
The writing's a little sloppy, maybe.
But the book is glorious nonetheless.
Real pezzonovante, .90 caliber.
A good read that demands re-read has been long time ago for now..
I’d never read The Godfather until this summer. But my lovely bride gave me an early hardcover edition for my birthday, and the whole experience was...Proustian. Almost every passage brought back a memory from my childhood, when the book and movies were omnipresent. I loved it. It’s a classic, and deservedly so.
But only the sons were needed so they were like this; his dear little successors: Yups, two were in the heavens, only one had eyes open, and he became something.
Plus, they were NEVER to ask about "work".All this Sicilian stuff is so discriminatory, even their  Consigliere  Tom Hagen had spotlights on himself for being 'Irish'.He seemed to be a pretty interesting character, I must say.Unrelated, but I must put this here:Like his Godfather said, “The lawyer with the briefcase can steal more money than the man with the gun.”So there was a character like this cat:Looking down at all others, so vicious that the-whole-world feared him, his name was the animal Luca Brasi ((Honestly, these cats are animals, and they are so cute, I doubt if Luca was a cute.
Then you forget it.”"Behind every successful fortune;There is Crime.”"The lawyer with the briefcase can steal more money than the man with the gun.”“We are all honorable men here, we do not have to give each other assurances as if we were lawyers.” "Time erodes gratitude more quickly than it does beauty!”  The novel 'The Godfather' leaves a long lasting impact on one's imagination.
It is probably still the environment that politicians, businessmen or anybody who regularly deals with lawyers still face.I personally find the beauty of its story and characterization only next to those of great Indian epics like Ramayana and Mahabharta.In all ways it is a master piece.
Having seen the movie so many, many and did I say many times before actually reading the book, the actual reading of the book has left a lot to be desired.
Chính cách nhìn, cách nghĩ, cách làm việc coi trọng tình người và sức mạnh của quần chúng nhân dân, luôn cố gắng và cam đoan giúp đỡ càng nhiều người càng tốt để tạo nên những mối thâm tình, hay ít ra là mối nợ ân nghĩa giữa Vito và các bằng hữu khác, để sau này có cần họ giúp đỡ điều gì thì họ cũng sẵn sàng thực hiện; suy tính kỹ lưỡng thiệt hơn của từng bước đi, đề ra những chiến lược cụ thể, khôn ngoan và khó đoán của Vito Corleone đã giúp cho ông trở thành một hình mẫu bố già ghê gớm, một con rắn thâm trầm và nguy hiểm, khiến kẻ thù phải kiêng nể, e dè, cùng lúc đó lại là một đấng toàn năng đầy nghĩa khí, hảo tâm đối với bạn bè, thân bằng quyến thuộc xung quanh.Thế nhưng, nếu chỉ có nhân vật bố già làm trung tâm và giành hết mọi ánh hào quang quyền lực về mình, thì có lẽ 642 trang tiểu thuyết này đã không thực sự lôi cuốn đến mức gây nghiện như thế.
But still I was in no mood to read the book until my friend Srividya recommended it to me.There are so many aspects of the book that I loved but characterization simply blew me away.
Puzo has given his characters so much depth.
Don Corleone, Michael, Tom Hagen, hot-headed Sonny and every other character was brilliant.
Corleones are always ready to help their friends.Story was not very simple, there was a mystery that unravels slowly but worth the wait.
I don't know why so much focus was given to her when her story didn't add anything to the origins story.
2017 PopSugar reading challenge #31 A book where the main character is a different ethnicity than youTenía cierto temor de que el haber visto la película me arruinara un poco la experiencia de leer el libro.
Bien, en un principio lo hizo un poco, y por eso lo dejé en pausa, para dejar correr un poco más de tiempo, y finalmente logré disfrutarlo como era debido.
Este tema a mí me emociona un poco demasiado y no sé por qué, pero la cosa es que el que esté tan bien trazado me hace pensar que no existe libro que iguale o supere a Puzo en este aspecto.
