Falling Kingdoms crushed my heart but exceeded all my expectations. SO GOOD. If you love high fantasy, do yourself a favor and read this book.
I can already tell that this is going to end up being one of my favorite series! Excellent cast of characters with a shocking and unexpected plot full of twists and turns. I can't wait to pick up the next book!
While this series begs for comparisons to Game of Thrones, I would be lying if I told you that they have nothing in common.They do.Both worlds are merciless, bloodthirsty, complex, magical and truly addictive to the reader.Some might say that it lacks originality.
How often in your life did you read about a princess wanting to escape a marriage, or a rebel who thought he could change the world, or a prince helplessly in love with the wrong girl, or magic lost but on the brink of being rediscovered?If you’re a diehard fan of fantasy, your answer would be none other than a thousand times before.
Perfect. I-read-it-in-one-sitting perfect.  Even in the darkest and most cruel person, there is still a kernel of good. And within the most perfect champion,there is darkness.The question is,will one give in to the dark or the light?  That is the most fascinating thing about Falling Kingdoms.The characters aren't pure good or pure evil (except Gaius,that hideous bastard),they make choices that lead them to one path or another,they fight hard their inner demons,they justify their actions based on
That is the most fascinating thing about Falling Kingdoms.The characters aren't pure good or pure evil (except Gaius,that hideous bastard),they make choices that lead them to one path or another,they fight hard their inner demons,they justify their actions based on their beliefs of right and wrong and their needs.
This book is being hailed as "A Game of Thrones for young adults." I have only read the first twenty pages of A Game of Thrones & I can already tell you that is like comparing a stick figure drawing to a professional painting.
The same extremely corny voice.I felt like I was reading a bad high school play with a medieval theme.Also, I don't know if I have ever experienced such an intense dislike for almost every main character the way I did with this book.
:) I'm just going to go ahead and get this out of the way, there are some characters in the book that I really liked that were killed.
I have a feeling I probably shouldn't like too many characters that have made it to the next book, or they might die as well!
The main characters are Cleo, Jonas, Lucia, and Magnus.
The way she just "let" a death happen in the beginning of the book.
And now that I think about it, her stupidity caused a death of someone I really liked later on in the book!
I liked Lucia and Magnus in the beginning.
If it asked me to witness it I’d be all like:Because who hasn’t pictured me as the megalomaniac god-figure of a desert dieselpunk cult?To be honest, I was reading this book kind of like:Things are happening but I do not relate…Things happened but it was hard to relate to anything through the cookie-cutter, 2 Dimensional characters and lacklustre plot.Consider for a moment that you have three supposedly very different kingdoms.
It’s just a theory, but I like to use models like this when I’m looking at cultural construct of fantasy novels.So little of what Rhodes wrote breached the depths of the cultural iceberg in terms of character and world building these three cultures.
I heard that Magnus Damora might or might not be my future husband. *lol*Well, at least that's what reliable sources tell me. *raises eyebrow* So yeah, I think 2018 is the perfect year to find out! ;-PLet's see if I can get my fingers on him .... erm... this book real quick! XD
See this review and more like it on my blog: www.bookbastion.net____________________________________This was not good.You know how sometimes the media latches onto trends - hint, they do this all the time - and suddenly when one specific type of story starts getting popular a whole bunch of knock offs with similar stories start appearing?
If you're going to write a story from multiple perspectives, you'd better be sure that the characters all have a unique voice and perspective on the situation, otherwise what's the point?
Sure, Cleo calls a few guys from Paelsia savages a few times, but there's really nothing shown in the story to prove her point.
OKAY.Anyways, Falling Kingdoms is such a cliched, tropey filled fantasy book with so much insta love, incest, a predictable storyline and a whole entire love-fucking-PENTAGON, BUT I STILL LIKED THIS SO MUCH, HOLY SHIT??
Anyways, there are a lot of bad things that they (the leaders) are wishing and wishing and wishing on me (Cleo, Magnus, Jonas, Lucia.) LET'S TALK ABOUT SOME STUFF.1) PRINCESS CLEO is literally the most beautiful princess and I love her so much, like how can you not, she's beautiful and she's like,,, so beautiful, wow I love her because she's SO BEAUTIFUL!!!!
The plot was crap — some young guy gets killed in one country and then that country starts a war with the murderer's country and then there's also a silly prophecy about a chosen one/Mary Sue/boring bitch.
UGH.Oh and it's so bloody obvious that that millennia old bird guy that was stalking her is going to fall in wuv with her in the next book — he seemed to half a hard on for sixteen year old girls.Jonas was a petty, bitter jealous bitch.
It's obvious that he's going to fall for Cleo in the sequel because all he did when he wasn't hating her was talk about how good looking she was.
Mediocre because: Falling Kingdoms has the feel of a teen ASOIAF/Game of Thrones, but my favorite part of the latter - the many characters' complexity and unpredictability - is completely missing in the former.
Rhodes' characters are flat and easy to grasp within a few pages of their introduction.
Whenever a character was totally knocked out by a betrayal, all I could think was That said, there were positive parts to the first installment of this series.
When I consider those things, I might think about sticking with Falling Kingdoms a while longer.
And I need to keep up with them hip book series
After a beginning I wasn't too sure about, Falling Kingdoms surprisingly became an extremely enjoyable - if somewhat unoriginal - story. Rhodes' world was a fascinating and exciting place that I am eager to explore more of in the sequel, her characters were complex individuals often torn between political and moral duty, and the tensions between the lands of this world (Limeros, Paelsia and Auranos) were highly convincing. My final opinion of this novel is such a turnaround from my first impres
My final opinion of this novel is such a turnaround from my first impressions that varied from indifference to a little disgust at Magnus' not-so-brotherly love for his younger sister (but more about that in a bit).Rhodes puts her characters through several levels of hell in this story and she doesn't shy away from unpleasant events.
Though, I will say for those of you who are put off by incest in books, so far Magnus' feelings for Lucia have been viewed as disgusting by Lucia and the other characters - hopefully, nothing will come of it.However, let's not get carried away with the negative!
“Magic will find those with pure hearts, even when all seems lost.” Let me start by saying it's really hard for me to review books i love, there is so much i want to say.I know a lot people dislike these books so i decided to read a few bad reviews before i started this. Turned out most people had similar issues; too many characters, confusing plot line, too many POVs. I read first few chapters like a textbook, paid attention to every little detail, tried to remember their names, and who belong
Let me start by saying it's really hard for me to review books i love, there is so much i want to say.I know a lot people dislike these books so i decided to read a few bad reviews before i started this.
That's one of the things i loved about it that characters are more complex rather than just being pure evil or all goodness.
^^(I fucking love this quote)Magnus.Magnus Lukas Damora, prince of blood, is a jackass.
I'm not sure i like him or not but i definitely enjoy reading about him.Cleo.Cleiona Aurora Bellos is the youngest princess of Auranos.
Do you like Game of Thrones and wish for a YA-version? Well, my friends, look no further:• Unexpected killings of significant characters?• Multiple POV’s (including possible villains) taking place in different kingdoms with royalty, assassins, and other worldly creatures/shifters• Heavy world-building• Feuding kingdoms• Even a brother-sister romance though that is a bit less Cersei-Jamie, a bit more Clary-Jace if you know what I mean=)Is this book perfect? Well, honestly, I wasn’t a huge fan of

There was so much action and drama and history that this book just flew by for me, and the crazy thing is when I finished I couldn’t believe I had only read one book –now I can’t wait to start the next (As well as A Book of Spirits and Thieves which I won at a book convention) because I want to know what happens.
Perfect book for reading in Scotland by the fire :)

3) Limeros - violent and disciplined kingdom ruled by the 'blood king'.There are 4 protagonists and each play an essential part of the story.
It seemed like EVERYONE was in love with her.
After what they have done (view spoiler)[to Auranos (hide spoiler)] i'm all like...
, Falling Kingdoms was a book that played with my feelings and took me on a fantastic rollercoaster i absolutely loved!
And by flapped it in front of my face, I mean she threatened to revoke my (PRECIOUS!) card unless I read it.She's shady.So I check it out, and the next thing you know I'm all involved in a prince with incestuous thoughts, a princess being forced to marry a drunk, a young man from a poor village who dreams of revenge, a soon to be queen who is dying from a broken heart, a palace guard that may have fallen for his charge, a man masquerading as a hawk, and another princess who might have the power to restore the balance...or destroy the world.Oh, and dead people.
The plot itself isn't really anything too special, but the scope of it all (following several characters/kingdoms instead of one main one) and the risks that the author is willing to take with characters (MANY deaths) kept me on my toes.
That's the ONLY description you could come up with?" The descriptions are just so PLAIN I really couldn't put myself in any of the characters' shoes or get engrossed in the world.
My favorite character has a weird character arc going for him, and i'm not sure if it's worth it to get invested in these books if the only person I like dies.
let's talk about characters!!!!!chloe- basic bitch, becky with the blonde hair- has "fire" within her but honestly not that impressed- she better come back with a revenge body planjona-bona- annoying, 2/10- kind of clever though and has decent insights into people's manipulations- but who cares cause he's annoyingmanga- sad boi, cries all the time, very EMOTIONAL- carries big things if u know what i mean [i'm talking about his sword, pervs]- gross, but i'm into itlucky- seriously she's just luckyseriously though, if you're not expecting something GROUND BREAKING this was pretty fcking good.
This was one of those books that didn't seem to want to go forward. It dragged especially the first half and then dragged some more.  There was potential, sure but all shattered when it was clear that everything and i mean EVERYTHING needs to be discussed to death. I only wish it was literally to their deaths so I didn't have to continue with them anymore. Really. So fucking tedious.Give me the story. Do something. Anything! Cleo, you wanna go (view spoiler)[to Paelsia? (hide spoiler)] Go then.

I actually went back and finished this!I know shocking!
So I figured 'finish it and have an option to move on to book 2 if the mood strikes'The rating remains the same for this book though.
I am truly sorry, I am. I wanted this book to be spectacular, to amaze me with its epicness. I was ready to love it heart and soul! Alas, sadly -- and very much obviously thanks to those two ugly stars -- that did not happen. I'm going to rant now, so please excuse my shouty capitals whenever they appear. You see, my average rating is somewhere around 4.4/5 and seeing that I've read almost 500 titles that means I pretty much drop them 4 and 5 star ratings like they're hot. It doesn't bother me,
It doesn't bother me, because I don't like wasting my time with books I know will bug me, so naturally that I'm choosing ones that will most likely suit me.
You know, the ones that actually have a character.
There are 4 main POVs we have to endure and I honestly liked Jonas's the most, but the fact that he's practically the brightest in the bunch doesn't excuse his demeanor set on the mantra hate royals, kill royals, get what the royals have.
But I sure as hell wouldn't recommend it, because, in the end, I don't care what happens to these characters now and that is always problematic if you want to read something memorable.
They're both fantasy series involving a large cast of characters, murder, magic, and backstabbing.
Here, however, the overarching story focuses on the intersecting lives of Cleo, Jonas, and Magnus as war blossoms between their nations.
Most didn't feel senseless and still pushed the story forward, while also adding a threat of danger that made everything more exciting.
I actually liked Cleo?
Lucia’s story is arguably the most interesting, and I appreciated how well she stood up for herself/loved ones.
Quite a lot was just unbelievable occurrences pushing the plot forward.
What a great start to a series that promises so much more! I loved pretty much all the characters and the plot was pretty well set up. I can't wait to read the next. 4.25/5 ⭐
I also love how none of the character are all good or all bad.
The choices they make determines the paths in-witch they travel and some of those choices are leading them down some pretty dark alleys :( But every story needs a good villain or two in this case.
I love reading books with multiple POVs and this book has many :D Falling Kingdoms is sure to draw you in and break your heart.
*I love this cover a lot!* “Hate is such a strong emotion.
When you hate--or love--do you do so with all your heart?
"Basically Game of Thrones for a younger audience" was my first reaction, but let me go back now and revise that to "Game of Thrones but better." This first book is average, but by the 4th book this series is just straight up awesome. I love all of the characters (even the incompetent ones) and the plot never, ever gets dull. In Game of Thrones I'm usually either skimming or else like

RTC ———— buddy read with  Jessica 🍦super excited to get into this and love it to pieces & I already know enough to guess I’m going to LOVE Magnus and Cleo !
Blog review @Scaredy Engines End of Line LibraryThere is a lot of drama and plot twists in this book.
In a way it felt like everything was explained at the end of the book regarding the intentions of the characters and the magic at stake, but with definite room for more adventures and more problems to solve.
(This is an ongoing series after all)I liked how the author managed to create a believable world and fill it with complex characters whose intentions aren't always clear at least not until the end.
Falling Kingdoms: 4.5 stars"Magic will find those with pure hearts, even when all seems lost.” This has become an instant new YA fantasy favourite!Why you need to pick it up now:• detailed characters with flaws (that you learn to accept) and vulnerabilities• twists and turns in every corner• lies, betrayal and shocking plot twists• unexpected love• that world-building• the fact that violence isn't sugar-coated• magical element that is pulled off amazingly• truly complex villains who are quite scary• THAT cliff-hanger (thank the gods I have the second book)
His character has to face such tragic situations since the beginning that I feel like hugging him.
