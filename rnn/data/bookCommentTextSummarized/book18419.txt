When I told my mom what I was reading, she thought I said "Let's Explore Dead Babies with Owls."Bravo, Mr. Sedaris. 4.5 stars
I usually like the work of David Sedaris.
Let’s Explore Diabetes with Owls has moments of that trademark understated irony, but it’s more self-absorbed than his earlier collections.
This book’s primary theme seems to be the travails of a successful author as he fulfills his tiresome obligations to accept invitations to read his work out loud in exotic locations like China, Rotterdam, and Costco.
It’s no surprise that he doesn’t allow those who stand in line to purchase an autographed book to take pictures with him.
Let’s Explore Diabetes with Owls is a disappointment because it is so much meaner and cruder--not to mention less funny--than earlier Sedaris books.
You know I'm shocked by all the high ratings for this book.
Maybe it's because I'm younger than the average David Sedaris reader, but my eyes were literally bleeding towards the end of Let's Explore Diabetes with Owls.
I don't even rate nonfiction, but I'm making an exception for this...
thing that reads like the inane, self-absorbed ramblings of a Grampa Simpson type - 'when I was young...' I killed endangered animals, never got the approval of my dad, wrote a racist rant, got my passport stolen...
is this supposed to be funny?
Well, whatever it is, it's not funny, it's humorless, bitter, and offensive.
I love David Sedaris but I HATED his last book, 'Squirrel Seeks Chipmunk'. I'm hoping he redeems himself here. UPDATE: I read this book and I was happy to find short stories and essays. I laughed out loud many times. The story about the taxidermist is my favorite out of this collection.
I love this little guy!I always listen to him read his own stuff in audiobook form, as opposed to reading it myself.
I can't do his little elfin voice justice.
Let's Explore Diabetes with Owls is more of the same Sedaris: observations skewed by his quirky worldview, which produces within me squirmy giggles with the occasional guffaw explosion.
It's just good, solid humor carpetted by light thought-bombs.
The topics this time around are mostly dominated by lots of travel stuff, obviously due to all the book tours he's done since becoming wildly famous.
Sedaris also spends a good deal of time writing about writing.
(I listened to this on audiobook.)I went into this book with little knowledge on David Sedaris's work/life, so I learned a lot about him while listening to this! Overall it was enjoyable, but it definitely didn't blow me away. I do plan to give Me Talk Pretty One Day a read, but probably not any time soon.
A fast-moving collection of humor essays, Let’s Explore Diabetes with Owls takes on subjects well known to fans of David Sedaris.
The essays center on the author's many travels, his writing, and his relationship with his father; several of the pieces rehash material he covers more effectively elsewhere, from early essay collections like Naked to his recent memoir Calypso.
A set of short stories, more disturbing than entertaining, follows the essays, but it's best skipped.
I think listening to the collection on audio made me like it more than I would have had I read it, since Sedaris’s voice always brings his writing to life, but I’d recommend more inspired collections to readers who are new to his work.
It was a fun event - Sedaris is charming and adorable in person, and was very polite to the requisite crazy people who tend to show up at every author reading I've ever attended (I remember one particularly memorable woman at a Margaret Atwood reading who started out asking Atwood's opinion about Britney Spears and her costumes throughout the years, and ended by shrieking that "What they did to Britney was A SIN!
For me, I can't help but think as I read a Sedaris essay that he's standing right there next to me, speaking word for word what is written on the page, which makes for interesting mental company.When I delved into "Let's Explore Diabetes With Owls" (a great title if ever there was one), I expected the same rat-a-tat yet subdued sarcasm that made his other works so completely hilarious.

Sometimes I love his essays and other times I hate them, so ranking a collection of his work fairly is difficult.
Actually, having read a handful of his other books, I'd recommend listening to him read his essays.
He's one of the few humorists who has literally made me laugh out loud.The high points of this collection are Understanding Understanding Owls, Laugh Kookaburra, and A Guy Walks into a Bar Car. They're unbelievably funny and have a lot of heart.
The low points were: Health-Care Freedoms and Why I want my Country Back, If I Ruled the World, and Dog Days.
What makes them interesting is David Sedaris’ voice, his wit, his irony and, occasionally, his depth.Here we have the blistering drama of the middle class dysfunctional family in 1960s U.S., the nostalgic recounting of missed chances, the joyous preparations for an author tour, the morbid fascination with the skeleton of a Pigmy girl in a taxidermy shop on Valentine’s Day, the cultural peculiarities of foreign countries, the harassment women have to deal with, Obama drama, a poem about dogs and six fiction stories in which Sedaris impersonates different types of people in order to mock their ugly traits.

While I still appreciate the story behind these stories (for those of you not in the know, Sedaris decided to start writing these for people to perform in Forensic competitions), there is ZERO chance I would ever want to sit through anything aside from “Six to Eight Black Men” if I was a parent forced to attend one of these events.Now?
It appears to be time to learn how to dress my family in corduroy and denim : )

جدیدترین اثر «دیوید سداریس» طنزنویس امریکایی است که در سال 2013 منتشر شده.
مانند بقیه‌ی کتاب‌هایش، در این کتاب نیز خاطراتش را به زبان طنز روایت می‌کند.
این کتاب شامل 21 جستار از 27 جستار کتاب اصلی است.
مثل بقیه‌ی کتاب‌هایش روان و جذاب بود.
وقتی آخرین بخش کتاب را می‌خواندم که در مورد عادت خاطره‌نویسی‌اش بود و اینکه چندین جلد دفتر خاطرات دارد، تازه می‌فهمیدم که چطور اینقدر خوب می‌تواند خاطرات را با جزییات به یاد بیاورد و اینکه این همه سوژه را از کجا می‌آورد.
کتاب‌های سداریس علاوه بر اینکه برایم جذاب و خواندنی هستند، جنبه‌ی آموزشی از لحاظ طنزنویسی هم دارد.
David's stories about his family are funny, but also a little heart-breaking.In other essays Sedaris talks about his compulsion to record everything in his diaries.....to the point he has no time to actually DO things; the people in France censuring Americans before the 2008 election, certain we wouldn't elect a black President; giving condoms and hotel shampoos to teens who come to his readings; his entire colonoscopy.....from the induced diarrhea before to the obligatory farting afterwards; 😁 and much more.David Sedaris giving a reading*****Here are snippets from some stories I found especially amusing and/or memorable: - Sedaris went to a taxidermy shop in London, looking for a stuffed owl to give his boyfriend Hugh for Valentine's Day. The store had a couple of owls, but not the one David really wanted: a barn owl with "a spooky white face like a satellite dish with eyes." David Sedaris (right) with his boyfriend Hugh HamrickBarn owlSensing an interested customer, the shop owner brought out some "odd bits and pieces": a pygmy skeleton from a victim shot for sport; a man's hairy forearm, lost during a bar fight; and the 400-year-old head of an adolescent girl from South America.
Sedaris’ books are hilarious, but to truly enjoy and to really understand the David Sedaris experience, you need to listen to him read his essays and sketches.
Sedaris has the timing of a veteran comedian and he is just too funny.Let's Explore Diabetes with Owls, his 2013 collection of essays, short stories and observations might be my favorite work from him that I have read so far.
Sedaris is also a world traveller and his wit and sharp eye for detail abroad make for some memorable and hilarious scenes.A funny, enjoyable visit with a talented man.
I enjoyed some parts of the book more than others. I kept thinking ---It would have (always would be) much more fun to 'hear' David Sedaris reading these stories -rather than read them to myself.It wasn't my 'favorite' book --yet I laughed. (and was touched)Plus, how can anyone 'not' smile just saying 'David Sedaris's name! :)
But Let’s Explore Diabetes with Owls isn’t a bad read and a few of the essays had me LOL-ing hard though it’s definitely not as consistently good as his other books.
There’s enough decent material here to make reading it worthwhile for most David Sedaris fans, and the book as a whole is well-written and easy to read, so Let’s Explore Diabetes with Owls is a decent-enough read.
Like, I'll call in to the next fund drive and they'll say "I'm sorry but our records show you gave ...Diabetes with Owls two stars.
We don't want your money." Two stars, because he's a competent writer, especially when he's not writing as himself, and he made me chuckle a few times but, wow, I haven't felt this alienated by a book in a while.
Either way, "people don't dress well at airports" or "Chinese people eat weird food" are not really compelling things to read about, and neither are his multiple stories involving dead, dying, and injured animals, or stories where he uses "Black" or "Latino" accents, or when he talks about his time in voluntary poverty.
I argue that he is specifically, painfully not funny in Let’s Explore Diabetes With Owls, his latest book of “essays, etc.” (and it’s that “etc.” that should warn you off like a double-red pennant at the yacht basin).Let’s Explore Diabetes With Owls has all the penetrating insight of your slightly tipsy Uncle Irv doing his Jerry Seinfeld impression (“So what is the deal with corn on the cob, anyway?
The food isn’t anything at all like what you’re used to from the food court at the mall, plus the Chinese have an entirely different take on personal hygiene, if you know what I mean.
نمی دونم چه صیغه ایه که همیشه صبر می کنم تا پیمان خاکسار یکی از کتاب های سداریس رو ترجمه کنه ککه بعدش من بدو بدو برم انگلیسیش رو بخونم :))به هر حال اینم خوب بود.
طبق عادت همیشگی نویسنده مجموعه ای داستان کوتاه بود با محتوای یادآوری خاطرات خود نویسنده از اتفاقات ریز و درشت زندگیش که چاشنی طنز هم بهش اضافه شده .
بد نیست وقتی غمگین هستین یا بی حوصله این یا دلتون خنده می خواد یا حوصله کتاب های سنگین رو ندارین یا مثلا موتور کتاب خوانی تون خاموش شده و می خواین با یه محرکی روشنش کنین به این کتاب رو بیارین.
تجربه مفرحی خواهد بود
You'd segue into a bit about how this made you realize that even when everyone around you makes you feel like a singular freak, you can still feel a profound connection to this man you've never met, because when he writes about his crystal meth addiction and being paddled by his father, he does it SO WELL that you actually think to yourself (contrary to all the evidence), "That's just like MY life!".
Then of course you realize that your enterprise is doomed, because David Sedaris is David Sedaris and you are just you, and no, he probably wouldn't want to hang out with you in real life because, well, obviously.
I really disliked this book.
I honestly have no idea how this book makes people laugh.
I consider myself to have a pretty dry 'British' humour and it felt like David Sedaris was attempting to do this but completely missed the mark.
I kept pushing myself through hoping the bigger joke was coming along and I was suddenly going to understand it all but it was just crude and pretty vile in places.
Sedaris successfully manages to insult so many different people in this book that I spent the whole time wondering how this managed to get published.
“And I'm here to tell you that, as long as you keep your eyes shut, it's really not that bad.” ― David Sedaris, Let's Explore Diabetes with OwlsWhile I enjoyed this collection more than Sedaris' previous book 'Squirrel Seeks Chipmunk', it just didn't rise to the levels of his great collections ('Naked' or 'Me Talk Pretty Someday'), or even his very good collections ('When You Are Engulfed in Flames' or 'Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim').
We all laughed at the appropriate parts, we all knew what we expected and David Sedaris delivered the goods -- mostly.
The audio quality wasn't great, but I walked away mostly amused that I somehow ended up parting with 1 credit at Audible, $15 bucks on Amazon, $45 for a live reading, and while mildly entertained ...
فقط دو جا از آدم، دزدي ميكنند؛ در تلويزيون و در دنياي واقعي.در تلويزيون اموال آدم پيدا ميشود ولي در دنياي واقعي، تازه اگر خوش شانس باشيد، پليسي كه به خانه تان ميايد ميپرسد: كامپيوتر دزديده شده چه جور كامپيوتري بوده؟اجازه ندهيد اين سوال، سطح توقعتان را ببرد بالا.
با همون رگه هاي طنز كه تو همه جملاتش خيلي واضح وجود داره.
با سداريس نميشه نخنديد.انگار يه دوست نشسته روبروت و داره جريان زندگيش رو برات مو به مو با لحن خاص و خنده دار خودش خيلي صادقانه تعريف ميكنه:)با اينحال، بنظرم مادربزرگتو از اينجا ببر بهتر بود از اين.
I'm continually amazed at David Sedaris' detail. The way he writes conversations and chance encounters - brilliant. "Day In, Day Out" describes his journal-writing process, and is it surprising? The man works nonstop at it - recording the minutest of details for later use. I've seen him read from one of these journals. His satire and sarcasm just get me all weepy...with laughter. I love this man.
Let's Explore Diabetes with Owls is a collection of contemplative but humorous autobiographical essays written by humorist/ comedian/ author/ radio contributor: David Sedaris.
Check it out!My favorite quote:“States vote to take away my marriage rights, and even though I don't want to get married, it tends to hurt my feelings.
It's like voting whether or not redheads should be allowed to celebrate Christmas.”David Sedaris has authored the following books as of July 2015.
They are not considered a series to my knowledge, but they are similar in regards to being collections of personal essays.
کتاب مجموعه ای 26 داستان کوتاه طنزه که توسط دیوید سداریس به نگارش درومده و این داستان ها درحقیقت خاطرات نویسنده هستن.ارتباط برقرار کردن با کتاب های طنزی که متعلق به کشورها و فرهنگ های دیگه هستن معمولا ساده نیست.
ولی این کتاب بنظرم کتاب خیلی جذابی اومد و بعضی از قسمت هاش منو وادار به خندیدن با صدای بلند کرد!
البته داستان هایی هم داشت که چندان نمیشد باهاشون ارتباط برقرار کرد.ترجمه ی این کتاب توسط نشر چشمه و با ترجمه ی پیمان خاکسار (البته با حذف 6 داستان از کتاب) منتشر شده.
صد صفحه اول رو بیشتر دوست داشتم
