Forever My Girl  is a beautiful YA rockstar romance about the heartbreak of mistakes, the power of forgiveness, and the hope of a second chance at love.
It really helped connect me very early on in the book to the characters and draw me right into the story.With Liam now being the tattooed, motorcycle riding, bad boy, rockstar that he was, I wanted to know what made him originally decide to leave his forever girl behind and never look back?
Dropped at: 51%Reason: None of the characters act their age (the adults act like immature teeangers and the kids like wise grandparents), the dialogue is contrived, Josie's mood swings are beyond annoying, and Liam is a drama queen. Also, don't get me started on the editing mistakes.I couldn't care less where this is headed.
***THIS REVIEW IS POSTED AT MY SECRET ROMANCE***http://www.mysecretromancebookreviews...4 SECOND CHANCE STARS “I know she hates me. I hate me.I ruined her life. That is what her voice message said. The one I've saved for the past ten years. The one I've transferred from phone to phone just so I could hear her voice when I’m at my lowest. I can recite every hateful word she said to me when I was too busy to answer and never found the time to call her back. Never found one second to call and expla
They say time heals old wounds but Josie has never been able to fully recover from the shattered heart that Liam left her with.
Sad and dealing with the grief from the death of Mason her long time friend and best friends’ husband, Josie is trying to keep it all together, that is until Liam shows up.
Liam’s return brings old feelings to the surface that Josie thought she had buried a long time ago and a situation Liam didn't know anything about brings them back together in a whole new way.Their first encounter with each other after ten years apart is emotional and moving.

You’ll have to excuse the side effects that are occurring thanks to my gluttony . . . .  Like I said yesterday when my turn at the library finally came around: I DON’T EVEN CARE. This was EXACTLY what it was supposed to be. Nicholas Sparks-y and whoopsie baby that dude didn’t know about and second chance romance where the female lead is all . . . . .

Like I said yesterday when my turn at the library finally came around: I DON’T EVEN CARE.
Nicholas Sparks-y and whoopsie baby that dude didn’t know about and second chance romance where the female lead is all .
And dude is a tattooed superstar musician and thanks to the aforementioned song quote was all like this in my head .
ORIGINAL "REVIEW:"Why yes, I am aware that this is some sappy sapfest which is currently being compared to a Nicholas Sparks type of story.
I may just be a wee bit biased :)

When tragedy strikes ROCK STAR Liam Page finds himself returning to his Texas hometown of Beaumont, after being gone for ten long years.
Josie.Josie was devastated when Liam broke up with her and left.
“You don’t get to come in here and demand answers, Liam.
I think it was smart of him to be patient with her allowing her to process everything that was happening by giving her space and time to heal.I loved Josie she had a good head on her shoulders, she did not let her feelings cloud her judgment...
Ugh. I did not like Liam. I did not respect or relate to Josie. The characters were not fluid and the writing was really disjointed. Also, the way things unfolded did just not ring true for me. Liam up and left the so-called love of his life without a backward glance and doesn't come back until his friend dies. And suddenly all this stuff comes back that he's been feeling all this time? And the way Josie responds? No, I'm sorry. Not a fan.
This is a highly impressive debut novel by Heidi McLaughlin.When Liam left ten years ago to pursue his dreams to become a musician, he left everyone behind, including the love of his life, without an explanation.
Liam eventually became a super rock star and Josie stayed behind in a small town with a broken heart.
She tried, time and again, to reach Liam until he changed his number, which left Josie no choice but to move on with her life.
Liam may no longer be the boy she once knew, but she still fiercely loves the changed man.
She's still in love with Liam, too.'Cause when  she touches him like this: and when  he kisses her like that: ...they just have to admit that it's all coming back to them now...And so their second chance in love begins...Okay, now, my thoughts about the book:I love: Liam Uhm sorry, but everytime I hear/see the word "ROCKSTAR", all I think about is Adam Levine so he's Liam for me.
Helllooo...guy leaves girl, guy realizes his mistake and tries to win her back while she has secret from said guy...I've read plenty of those and wanted to see how this author would take a spin on this played out "theme".
Like I said, he's a chump.JoJo, I wanted more backbone with her.
Looking forward to Katelyn and Harrison's story cause you know they have to get together.*I really hope the author doesn't make Mason turn out to be a douche...like he had a mistress or secret love child.
Yay!
:) I feel all warm and gooey inside.
I love books that do that to me.
This was such a feel good contemporary romance.
It was a little predictable and standard, but I think that's ok, because it was gorgeous!
I do have one issue, and that is Liam's reason for leaving his home town of Beaumont and the love of his life, Josie Preston...
I can see where the author was trying to go with that but it was the only weak point in the story for me.
The last thing Betty says to me that day is somethi
I do have one issue, and that is Liam's reason for leaving his home town of Beaumont and the love of his life, Josie Preston...
Liam and Josie's close friend, Mason, dies before the story begins, so the reader never meets him, but my God did his death make me cry like a baby.
Every time I tried to retire to bed, I'd end a chapter and think 'Oh, I just want to see what Josie/Liam felt about that scene, I'll read one more chapter'...
I can see how there will be more great books in this series and I can't wait to read those!And then we are left with Liam!
kitabın konusunu özet geçmek istiyorum :) Spoiler yoktur;Liam : Buralardan gitmek istiyorum , bunaldımJossie : Tamam Liam : TSK Jossie : ÖD10 yıl sonra Liam : Ben geri geldim , seni seviyorum Jossie : Tamam Liam : TSK Jossie : Ö.D Büyük bir ciddiyetle söylüyorum ki kitabimizin konusu bu :)Kısa zamanda okunacak , rock gruplarıyla ilgili bir roman isterseniz okuyabilirsiniz . Çok çok ruhsuz bir romandı bana göre -,-
Liam left town and walked out on the girl he loved ten years previous to pursue a music career and never didn’t look back.
He doesn’t seem to belong.Liam is pulled back to his hometown of Beaumont after a tragic event and prepares himself to once again meet up with the girl whose heart he broke all those years ago and who still owns a large piece of his heart to this day.Josephine Preston had to move on.
I love dual POV’s and this is told in such a way that it allows the reader the chance to get close to the characters and really feel their story.
I want to wipe away her tears.
I want to take the last ten years and erase them.
I want to start over.”I seen the movie trailer for this on t.v. and I thought, I have GOT to read this book before it comes out!!
The movie looks really good!
WOW, There are so many differences between the movie and the book.
Forever My Girl was an okay read.
I am more excited to watch the movie than I was while reading this.
My Unexpected Forever book 2 has a higher rating so we shall see :)

I don’t want to get too deep into the plot so that those yet untainted by the movie trailer and reviews with spoilers can still enjoy, but I will say that I really liked this book.
Secondary characters were used well to propel forward using conflict.Though I felt some connection between the heroes, there was something missing for me there.
All in all, I’m looking forward to watching the movie, even if there are some major differences evident from the trailer lol Safety: There were others for both during the separation.
If Liam would have tried harder to explain to Josie what he wanted and needed she would have understood and stuck by him and help him follow his dreams.
Not attractive at all if you ask me.I’m honestly surprised at how a person can be left behind like the way Josie was and yet when the boy who broke her heart to tiny little pieces comes back into the picture and she becomes nothing but a blubbering mess.
I get it, Liam wanted to live his life to the fullest.
3/5 StarsThis book was okay. Nothing great. The story was forgettable and overly used. I didn’t like the characters. They weren’t acting their age and it was annoying. Probably wouldn't read the other books in this series.
I'm lucky - I had the privilege and honour of being able to read this story as it was being developed and written and I can tell you (as cliched as this may sound) you will NOT be disappointed.
You want a determined, likeable female lead?
You've got it.
You've got it.
Yeah, you got that too.
Add to the mix a cute kid and the likeable 'other guy' and you have the recipe for a perfect read.
Welcome to the first book in The Beaumont Series and welcome to a future of lost Sundays because when you start reading this story...

5 Second Chance Stars**SPOILER FREE REVIEW**Forever My Girl is a sweet, loving, all-around adorable read. If you, like me, have a thing for musicians, and reconnections, then this read is for you.Liam and Josie were high school sweethearts, but one day in college Liam decides to leave Josie to pursue a music career. Ten years later Liam comes back into town and Josie just doesn’t know how to process any of it. Both want closure, but there are plenty of obstacles in their way from finding peace.
5 Second Chance Stars**SPOILER FREE REVIEW**Forever My Girl is a sweet, loving, all-around adorable read.
Ten years later Liam comes back into town and Josie just doesn’t know how to process any of it.
Forever My Girl isn’t your typical rocker-comes-back-home love story.
It’s hard to explain, but you will get it when you read it.Josie is a florist and she didn’t get any closure when Liam left, but it’s been ten years so she moved on.
I liked a read with a love triangle.
I didn’t want to give everything away, so you really need to read Forever My Girl.

2 stars~ Contemporary "Rock Star" Romance
I really adored this story.

He's living the rock star lifestyle.
But then something happens that makes him go home again.
And at home he'll be forced to see her and deal with the past.
You'll have to read the book to find out.
And swooning over Liam.
A great debut novel that I know readers are going to fall in love with.
I never thought I'd see the boy who stole my heart and failed to give it back.... I'm not sure I want it back. So many feels man! So many fucking feels. I didn't really think I would like this book, because I honestly hated Liam right on the first page. But when I finished... Oh god! I was tearing up... I'm so happy Josie and Liam had their happily ever after. I'm such a sucker for happy endings!!I hate guys who leave girls without any explanation. That is suck a dick move. It's the worse way y
I didn't really think I would like this book, because I honestly hated Liam right on the first page.
Even though I didn't like Nick, at least he was man enough to be there for Josie when she was down and also help her raise her son, Noah.
I mean they didn't have a relationship, Liam and Josie, at this point, but the fact that she kissed someone else (yes they did kiss) aside from her fiancee, seems a lot like cheating to me.
But I do admire Liam and Josie's love.
"Arms of a stranger, a warm blooded kiss, trying to fill the void, of the one that I miss.Perfume whispers, lashes and lace, but I can only hear your voice, I'm so out of place.All these painkillers, thats all they are.

Liam is a big rockstar living in LA.
Josie has spent the last ten years moving on with her life after Liam left her.
They lose a very close friend, Mason, which brings Liam back into town.
I love you JoJo. You're my forever girl.This was a great story about second chances, love, and forgiveness.
And so were the other characters- loved Noah, and Katelyn and her girls.
4.5 Amazing Stars!!!“Hey, Jojo?” he yells.“Yeah.” I yell back.“I’m going to marry you someday.”I loved this book!! It was so good!! Liam was amazing and hot!! I loved all the scenes with little Peyton and Noah. They made my heart melt into millions of pieces. I want my future kids to be as cute as they are. I couldn’t stand Nick!! I just felt like he wanted what Liam had and that’s why he ended up with Josie. Overall, I loved this book!! It was so sweet!! I can’t wait to read the next book.
O carte despre decizii luate în pripă, despre greșelile tinereții și consecințele lor, despre iertare și fericire. O poveste de dragoste ce trece bariera timpului, pe care nu o destramă nimic, plină de durere și regrete. La final, răsare si soarele.
no es mi tipo de lectura pero le daré la oportunidad...Liam es un chico que quería hacer su vida diferente a lo preestablecido, veia que todo era predecible y el lo que quería era hacer música, sin embargo JoJo, la protagonista, no le prestó atención en su momento y creyó simplemente que eran "cosas suyas" Eso puedo entenderlo.Genial.
Simplemente no pude soportar ver como el se hacia a todas estas el orgulloso...Más blablabla, a la final hablan con el niño y esto pasa...En el momento que Liam y Jojo le dicen al niño que este es su papá, la autora considera que el mejor momento para que ellos se besen...
“Hey, Jojo?” he yells.“Yeah.” I yell back.“I’m going to marry you someday.”  Some people find their dream early on in life, some never do, and some sacrifice everything to capture it. Liam found his dream in the first semester of college, a dream that cost him everything he cared for, including the woman he desperately loved.Growing up in a strict patriarchal family, the only child of a man who had very clear ideas about what his son’s future should look like, and of a woman who gave up her ow
But no one ever asked Liam what he dreamed of becoming one day.Josie was the girl he fell in love with in high school.
She eventually rebuilt her life, moved on, never expecting one day for her past to just walk into her shop, for the boy who stole her heart to come back and be still in love with her.
I watched for you and once I saw you, I knew I was going to end up chasing my girl, waiting for you to turn around and see… the real me and love me for who I am and not what I did to you.
