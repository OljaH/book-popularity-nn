I wanted to love this one so much, but jeez Gena,  why are you making this so hard? To channel my upcoming rant, I will focus only on: the Plot, the  Insta-Insta Love,  the Nipples and how Promiscuity is just Rape. The Plot  - aka started from the bottom, now we here...still at the bottom. The premise to this novel was amazing - Pandora's box was opened by jealous warriors and as punishment, their spirits were fused with one of the sinful demons released.  Their plan to prove their power had fai
I mean, yeah, the ancient warriors were idiots (oh, let's open the box to show how good we are at catching the evil...totally not going to backfire...).But, hey, I'm buying what you're selling...well...until we got a bit further into this one...
Seems like an awfully poor location when you literally have to f*ck or die.If Paris is really f*cking 365 different women a year...in a hundred short years, he would've banged his way through over 36,000 of the small, mountainside villagers...Maybe it's just me, but it seems like the ratio of supply to demand is a bit...off.
My Problem that I Know Will Not Actual Bother Everyone: Okay, the main ‘hero’ is an immortal warrior who is partially controlled by demon of Violence. Yes, Violence, which the heroine, Ashlyn, is dating. He spends the first 50 pages (give or take) chanting kill, murder, slice, hurt, killkillkill to himself. He acknowledges that while he tries to fight the demon, he does fail - on a nearly nightly bases. Now, I’m aware that in this genre love conquers all and that relationships and people in roma
But. If your best friend, Sally, comes to you and says that she met this really great guy who is loving and caring and good to her, but he tells her that he holds the demon of Violence in his body, not joking, you would think one of three things 1).
Because he and his friends were so pissed off that the job of guarding the box of demons was given to Pandora, a girl, that they stole the box and opened it and so released Violence, Wrath, Death, Disease, Disaster, Pain, Misery, Lies, Secrets, Doubt, and Promiscuity into the world.
Aside from the love story between Maddox and Ashlyn, which was fantastic by the way, there was a lot of plot and character development.
The townspeople speculate are angels and Ashlyn needs a miracle.Maddox is cursed, along with his friends, for opening Pandora's box.
There is also a change in immortal leadership, which is wreaking havoc on Maddox and his friends' lives.Overall, I thought this was a nice, entertaining story.
At one point, I thought Ashlyn was finally going to have sex with Maddox and the music started up.
In their pride, the immortals open Pandora's forbidden Box. They loose the worst demons on mankind: Violence, Disease, Pain, Misery, everything that plagues the world.
It's many years until they learn to control these demons, and in the meantime, the carnage they inflict on the world is terrible.This sounds like the formula for a wonderfully dramatic, angst-ridden read, but there was no drama.
It's only at the end that someone, a villain, shows evidence of the terrors inflicted by these men, and it's never explained or even verified that the horrors were actually committed by them.
Showalter wants to make sure we're aware that these heroes have muscles, numerous times.
"Every night death came, slowly, painfully, and every morning Maddox awoke in bed, knowing he'd have to die again later. That was his greatest curse and his eternal punishment."  This book is a great intro into the Lords of the Underworld series and I admit, I am completely hooked!! I will not stop until I read them all!!!Before I tell you about the story, you have to know a few facts about the Lords (all of these facts will be explained in the first 10 pages of the book so I won't be giving a

Μην κοιτάξετε καν αυτή τη χάλια περίληψη που αδικεί την ιστορίαΟ Μάντοξ, ο Ρέγιες, ο Τόριν, ο Πάρις, ο Λούσιεν και ο Έρον ήταν έξι (και όχι οι μόνοι) από τους πολεμιστές του Δία.
Οι δαίμονες ελευθερώθηκαν και ο Δίας για να τιμωρήσει τους πολεμιστές, τους καταράστηκε μετατρέποντας τα σώματά τους σε ξενιστές για κάθε έναν από αυτούς τους Δαίμονες.Η Βία Η Αρρώστια Ο Πόνος Ο Θάνατος Η Ακολασία Η Οργή έχουν στοιχειώσει τους έξι αυτούς Άρχοντες, που τώρα ζουν απομονωμένοι σε ένα κάστρο στη Βουδαπέστη, όπου προσπαθούν να αποφύγουν τους Κυνηγούς, ανθρώπους που θέλουν να σκοτώσουν τους Άρχοντες για να φυλακίσουν ξανά τους Δαίμονες πίσω στο κουτί της Πανδώρας.
I felt like scenes jumped around a lot, and some things got left out, so I had to go back and reread scenes.
It also felt like a set-up book.
I love these paranormal series, but I wish that as much energy went into the first book, so that the quality is consistent.
I loved the end of this book.
There were parts that made me sigh, and other parts that made me want to fan myself because the scenes were hot.This is a good book that will give you some enjoyable hours of entertainment, and you'll definitely want to keep reading the series.
|3.8 keeper of awesomeness stars|It is so good when things turn out positively.I was a bit afraid of finding out I didn’t like this series after reading The Darkest Touch but with re-reading this first book?
I feel like I’m back on it.The Lords of The Underworld series is so addicting and so much fun and with an interesting premise, it’s no wonder why how these books have made it this far.I find the mix between Greek mythology, urban legends and paranormal creatures pretty great and with this compelling characters, you just want to learn more and more about them.In this first story we fall in love with Maddox, keeper of the demon of Violence and Ashlyn, a young girl working for a paranormal researcher institute with an interesting gift.
THE BACK STORY Long ago twelve immortals warriors made by Zeus, became jealous of Pandora she was chosen to guard a box. Inside that box housed some of the most dangerous demons ever known. The Immortals made a horrible mistake of killing Pandora and opening the box. As punishment for the evil they have unleashed each warrior was sentenced to carry one of those demons for all eternity. They are - Violence, Pain, Death, Disease, Disaster, Misery, Doubt, Promiscuity, Defeat, Lies, Secrets, and W

Maddox – Violence, Lucien – Death, Reyes – Pain Aeron – Wrath,  Torin – Disease, Paris -  Promiscuity.Ashlyn has heard of the “Angels” that live in the castle on the top of the hill in Budapest.
Moving Pandora into a trap wasnt a smart move and warriors were bound to be possessed by these demons .In this book we are introduced Maddox .
He played a significant role in Pandora's (view spoiler)[death (hide spoiler)] and now he is still paying the price by being tortured every night.Maddox is possessed by Violence , not an easy demon to deal with.He is a ruthless and a cryptic warrior .The demon has compelled him many times to kill and we can observe that he feels guilty.His curse: AshlynAshlyn is tortured many years now .
Maddox: Demon of violenceButterfly: upper left shoulder, wrapping around to his backHis curse: He is stabbed every night only to be brought back to life the next day and then the next night he has to die again.Ashlyn Darrow: She works for the World Institute of Parapsychology.Supernatural ability: She hears voices about things that they happened in the past.In ancient time, Maddox is the warrior that killed Pandora and then the box that included all the vicious demons disappeared and all the demons possessed the responsible warriors who opened it.
Ashlyn is twenty-four years, while Maddox is a few thousands.
"I do own sexy underwear, I promise, but i'm not wearing it right now.""WTFUCK??!
OH and the funny, ironic thing is that no doubt she believes she is a strong willed, feminist and you can bet she is full of feist...however when it really comes down to the nity gritty all our MC wants is a man to domineer her like the good little wifey she is.
I actually really though this book was interesting at the start...I loved the story of Pandora's box and the curse.
I must preface this by saying that I only made it to page 200, so i probably shouldn't be reviewing this book.
However, the fact that I couldn't really be bothered to make it past page 200 makes this worthy of explaining why.I picked up this book, first because I got a rec for it and second because the cover art is so darned striking.
So much of the book was set up with a lot of exposition and a trying-too-hard feel to get me interested in the camaraderie/interactions between all these men that live together.
Maddox is a warrior and is cursed with the demon spirit violence.
He's also cursed with death and being sent to hell every night at midnight.When Ashlyn is in the fortress looking for the mens home her and Maddox come face to face.
When Maddox decides to leave her there and try to make it home before death comes to him Ashlyn has no choice but to chase after him.
Ashlyn doesn't care about any of these men she only wants to be close to Maddox.
I loved that Ashlyn felt the need to protect Maddox.
Though, to be fair, I wasn’t completely addicted to the BDB until book 2 of that series.
In reading the first LOTU book, I couldn’t help but feel some of the descriptions of the Lords were too much like the Brothers, ie.
Though as I kept reading, I did eventually see these characters as characters all their own, and I am intrigued to keep reading the series and to get to know the Lords better.The Premise:  Interesting.
I just don’t feel quite as connected to the Lords (yet?) as I am to the Brothers or the IAD series characters.

- 5★Review★This is a new to me series, and as such, for me (even though this series has been out years) it was a refreshing take on the paranormal genre.
I loved both main characters, and the entire world this is based in.At times, it felt a bit too much, like page time was taken away from the main couple , in favour of world/secondary character building, but then this is the first book in a series, and as such is sort of necessary.
But, hugely enjoyable, great start to a series, loved the main characters and the rest of the "brothers" and cannot wait to carry the series on.

Pretty good opening book of the ’Lords of the Underworld’ series.Smartly built alternative mythology, gradually measured tension and multiplying conflict.
Maddox is the least significant Lord for me, so the first book being his is really smart, because his personality doesn’t outshine the story and the characters of the other Lords.
The Darkest Night successfully keys up the readers towards the rest of the characters and the series.
With Ashlyn, Violence was not truly violent.
The Darkest Night, as an opening book of the Lords of the Underworld series, is an appealing but not flawless story.Originally posted on my blog on July 13, 2013.My favorite quotes.
What I expected:1. A too-sexy-to-be-true hero.2. A too-feminine-to-be-anything-but-Barbie heroine.3. Lust at first sight that magically transforms into true love barely 50 pages into the book.What I got:1. Lots of laugh-out-loud moments. 2. Swoon-worthy heroes. 3. A thoroughly enjoyable read.Yes, the girl's a virgin. Yes, the guy's an immortal who has existed since before time yet still hasn't ever fallen in love. But no, the girl's not a wimpy, gullible, brainless idiot. And no, the guy actually does have a personality beyond his dick. Color me surprised.
Δεν μπορεί να αντέξει αυτήν την συνεχή φλυαρία που υπάρχει μέσα στο κεφάλι της, έτσι όταν μέσα από το ερευνητικό Ινστιτούτο όπου εργάζεται ταξιδεύει στην Βουδαπέστη θα ακούσει τους ντόπιους να μιλάνε για κάποια ξεχωριστά πλάσματα άλλοι τους θεωρούν Αγγέλους και άλλοι δαίμονες τότε σκοπός της θα γίνει η αναζήτηση τους με την ελπίδα να την βοηθήσουν.
Η πρώτη γνωριμία της Ashlyn και του Maddox ήταν μια πολύ όμορφα γραμμένη σκηνή.
Οι άρχοντες του κάτω κόσμου πρέπει να αντιμετωπίσουν τους Κυνηγούς μια φατρία ανθρώπων που έχει δημιουργηθεί εδώ και χιλιάδες χρόνια από την ημέρα που οι Άρχοντες συνδέθηκαν με τους δαίμονες και έφεραν το θάνατο στην γη.
wow what a first book five out of five and i can see me reading all the series very fast
😃 Kitabı sevmeyi çok istedim ama okudukça nefret ettim.
Bir kere konu yoktu kitapta, başından sonuna okuduğum tek şey Maddox’ın nasıl tahrik olduğu ve Ashlyn’i yatağa atma isteğiydi.
Son 100 sayfaya kadar dünya yansa tek derdi yatağa girmek olan bir Maddox vardı.
Keşke o büyük elleriyle beni okşasa?!” Danika’nın iç sesini okurken çelişkilerinden yoruldum yeminle.Bir de bu kadar tutkunun?!
Ben herkesin bomboş, erotik roman dediği Karanlığın 50 Tonu’nda ağlamış insanım, bu kitapta da tutku ve tahrik olmak dışında bir duygu olsaydı kesin yakalardım diye düşünüyorum.Kitabı beğenenlerden özür diliyorum ama hayatımda bu kadar zorlanarak bitirdiğim kitap sayısı azdır gerçekten.
(Yes the Pandora's Box) As punishment the Greek gods cursed the warriors, forcing each to act as host to one of the demons, sort of like a duo personality.
(Yes the Pandora) Maddox was additionally cursed to die each night at the hands of his fellow warriors, burning in the pits of hell until morning (which can`t be fun) The Lords of the underworld now live in a secluded castle in Budapest, each struggling to coexist with their own personal demon.
For Ashlyn it's a miracle, because even though she finds this violent and bloody (he's just killed some hunters) man terrifying the voices have stopped.
This was such a boring read, it is kind of ridiculous.The Darkest Night is supposed to be a PNR book a-la-J.R. Ward - while there are many similarities, Showalter ultimately does not deliver.
The book is filled with tortured fallen angels, forced to host a demon within them.
This is the case for the entire book - we are introduced to so many characters and none of them seemed to have a personality!
The heroine, Ashlyn, was a complete bore - and what little character she did have made me roll my eyes.
A book filled with PNR tropes and zero emotional pulls.

2,5*Όχι ιδιαίτερα του γούστου μου, φλύαρο ειδικά στην αρχή, έδινε βάση στα λάθος πράγματα, ή μάλλον καλύτερα δεν έδινε βάση στα πράγματα που εγώ ήθελα να δώσει, ενώ καμιά φορά από το eye rolling κόντεψαν να μου γυρίσουν τα μάτια ανάποδα.Παρ’ όλα αυτά το διάβασα ταχύτατα και εκεί προς το τέλος απέκτησε ένα κάποιο ενδιαφέρον.Κατά πάσα πιθανότητα θα συνεχίσω και με το δεύτερο τουλάχιστον μιας και απ’ όλους εκεί μέσα πιο πολύ μου τράβηξε το ενδιαφέρον ο Λούσιεν και η Άνια όσο προλάβαμε να την δούμε φάνηκε αρκετά υποσχόμενη σαν χαρακτήρας.
The Darkest Night is the story of a group of warrior/brothers who live together outside Budapest.
There is so much that I loved about this book.
When she meets Maddox, she is instantly attracted to him, and to the sudden silence around her.
Maddox is also attracted, but remains suspicious.
The love scenes are beautiful, but a little odd as the two characters often speak like cavemen – in one word sentences.
Actually, Maddox kind of reminds me a little of a caveman, in his possessiveness over Ashlyn.
I can’t wait to read the next book.
¡Es que es incomprensible!Dejando claro este punto, voy a decir las cosas que NO ME GUSTARON DE "La noche más oscura"Primero que nada lo peor fueron los protagonistas.El "Héroe" es un ser inmortal poseído por uno de los demonios antes ocultos en la caja de Pandora, este demonio fue maldito y está condenado a tratar de luchar contra la violencia que habita en él y como si no fuera suficiente, al pobre lo condenaron también a morir cada noche y quemarse en el infierno.
The Darkest Night is a fun introduction to a new series (for me at least) that goes around demons, crazy people, violence, hot drooly (yes, I mean it as drool-y - it should be a word, it’s awesome) sex and extreme redecorating.
But we all love crazy people don’t we?
She gets a wee bit angry and then says to herself "Meh, still want him, he’s hot".
I mean how often do you find a guy who knows how to repair stuff?
The Darkest Night is a nice intro to what seems like a good series but it lacked action.
Ama MADDOX diye bir İblis var bu kitapta.Pandora'nın kutusu açılınca payına Şiddet İblisi düşmesi bir yana ikinci laneti olan iki savaşçıdan biri.Sanki Şiddet baş edilmesi kolay bir şeymiş gibi...Yahu adam Ölüm'le lanetlenmiş.
Ama öyle böyle değil.
O ölüm sahnesini ilk okuduğumda ne hale geldim, nasıl kıvrandım bir bilseniz.Ashlyn'i de sevdim, PNR'de sevdiğim kadın tiplemelerinden.
Kırılgan, her şeyden habersiz adam bir dokundun mu...
Sevdiceği için kendinden vazgeçen bir kadın.Kitabın sonlarını da zaten diken üstünde okudum.
Maddox'ın kucağındaki Ashlyn ile ileri geri sallanırken haykırışları, karşılığında her şeyden vazgeçmeye bu kadar gönüllü oluşu...
O herifte çok seksi bir şey ama, diyim size.
