Very InformativeI had just finished John Fiske's, "The War of Independence" and was left wanting on details after the war leading up to our first president. This book has filled in those blanks. Very informative on the process involved in our Constitution and the events and men involved. Would recommend both books, read in the order I read them, for every student; and for every politician, to remind them of the roots of the Constitution they swear to uphold!
Well written. Insightful.
ConstitutionLacked Bill of Rights. Interesting the ideas presented in the forerunner documents to the Constitution, especially, eventually, the false respect for Native Americans.
Good quick readall Americans should read this and other early descriptions of the creation of the USA. don't rely on today's skins bites.learn and think for yourself
