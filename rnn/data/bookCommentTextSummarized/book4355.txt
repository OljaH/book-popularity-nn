The story tells of young Belgian reporter Tintin, who travels with his dog Snowy and friend Captain Haddock aboard a scientific expedition to the Arctic Ocean on an international race to find a meteorite that has fallen to the Earth.تاریخ نخستین خوانش: اول ماه فوریه سال 2003 میلادیعنوان: ستاره اسرارآمیز - ماجراهای تن تن و میلو؛ نویسنده: هرژه؛ مترجم: خسرو سمیعی؛ ؛ تهران، یونیورسال، 1354؛ در 62 ص؛ستاره اسرار آمیز دهمین کتاب از مجموعهٔ کتابهای مصور ماجراهای تن‌ تن و میلو است.
در شبی گرم، تن‌ تن و میلو مشغول قدم زدن در خیابان‌های شهر بودند که تن‌ت ن متوجه می‌شود یک ستاره بزرگ در دب اکبر اضافی است.
But being a scientist I was groaning at the science.
I'm not going to be a neck beard and pick it apart here though.
Just swallow it down and enjoy the comedy.Tintin sees a mysterious bright light in the sky on a walk one night and calls the observatory.
So he goes to the observatory and rings the doorbell.
Stuff is going on there that is not quite explained I think, but Tintin get's lead not an adventure to the landed meteorite in the Arctic.
Please don't use it for reference material on any kind of science though.Oh yeah, it's fiction.
Herge is no Winsor McCay, but his influence can be seen in Jean Giraud's work, which means that Herge was, at a minimum, influential on today's comic arts.
The Shooting Star is a strange mix: Surreal science fiction which, at the time, must have seemed outrageous, all built on a skeletal plot that is overly predictable and must have been hackneyed, even at the time it was first published.
I kept hoping for this while reading The Shooting Star, but it came up just a little short of my hopes.
الترجمة فُلة شمعة منورة 😀😀
Having just finished The Shooting Star and from what I remember of Burns’ comics, there’s unfortunately no major connection besides the visual.
Nobody on Earth besides two organisations - a good one and a bad one - are interested in this event and, with Tintin, Snowy and Captain Haddock leading the good guys’ ship, they race each other to the crash site to claim any potential cosmic treasures laying around.
Maybe Burns’ comics will look into where the meteorite/alien eggs came from?The Shooting Star is a generic Tintin adventure tale offering little originality besides some interesting space oddity at the end.
"Dass die Rauchsprache erst nach dem Verzehr von "Psylocibinen" erlernbar wird, von Pilzen, die "aus den Tiefen des Kosmos mit Hilfe von Asteroiden auf die Erde gebracht worden (sind)" (Ich werde hier sein im Sonnenschein und im Schatten, 126), führt uns wieder zurück in das Tim und Struppi-Land, zu Hergés Album Der geheimnisvolle Stern. Auch auf dem Meteoriten, dem geheimnisvollen Stern, der wie eine "Vergrößerungsmaschine" funktioniert, spielen Pilze eine Hauptrolle: Sie vergrößern sich und lösen sich nach der Explosion in nichts auf."(Aus: Christian Kracht revisited: Irritation und Narration)
All the plot points are convenient and interchangeable, built on haphazard coincidences and luck.
So, while Tintin is always charging forward, he isn't always a particularly active character, since he's not as much planning and overcoming as much as blundering through.I know it's old and I know it's juvenile, but comparing it to Winsor McCary or Carl Barks, it's pretty tame.
Even in Barks' work, where the characters are cartoon animals, there is a greater sense of narrative unity in what we are meant to take seriously as plot and what is light fun.Another odd entry as I wait for Herge to hit his stride.
On this adventure, Tintin, Snowy, Captain Haddock and others set sail to the Arctic to find a meteorite and discover a new metal.
The story is interesting because it's different from the earlier ones that are invariably more on the nose with historical and political satire.
It shows you how ownership is priority over discovery in our world (putting the flag on the meteorite is critical to the extent that Tintin forgets the reason for even going there, until the very last moment).
All said and done, it was a welcome deviation from the other stories.
Also, I think they should rename the Tintin series Snowy!
The beginnings of these stories have been around as long as the Lord of the Rings, the illustration and environments in the Tintin books are accurate and extremely detailed.
Anyone who has spent even a little time exploring Herge (Georges Remi) can see the painstaking research and adversity he worked through to compose the world around Tintin.
His ideas were ahead of his time (Exploring the moon, Industrialization, South American political conflict, modern slave trade, extraterrestrial life) and he made certain every detail for every object would be realistic (after the third book at least).
Herge's work can certainly be cited as an influence for any modern day graphic novel or comic book.
The adventures with Captain Haddock continue - his drinking problem also continues, even though in this sea trip he is cheered as the leader of non alcoholic sailors (LOL). In the mean time, at the same time as he receives a garland of flowers for being the abstemious captain of the ship that is going to make a scientific expedition, full boxes of whiskey bottles are being crammed into his cabin !!! LOLWell, I do not tell the story: you must go and read it yourself...Maria Carmo, Lisbon 11 January 2015.

Première fois que je lis Tintin. J'ai bien aimé. Toute suite en partant, l'humour des textes m'a attiré.
This is one of the more unbelievable Tintin books, including a shooting star (as the title suggests) that plummets into the ocean, sporting red and white mushroom (as the cover suggests). xD
برعکس بچه های الان من کتاب های تن تن رو خیلی سخت پیدا کردم و خوندم. سالی یه بار میرفتیم خونه داییم و از پسرداییم هر دفعه یکی دوتاش رو قرض میگرفتم. زمان خواهرم مادرم کل مجموعه اش رو خرید!
Very funny issue. I really love the scenes with Snowy and Tintin! After the fall of a meteorite and a big earthquake Tintin with Snowy and Captain Haddock and a group of scientists sail to the Arctic to find it and discover a new metal.
Another cracking adventure with TinTin, snowy and Capt Haddock! Happily reading these in the original publications.
Anyone who grew up without Hergé - I'm terribly sorry.
Professor Foster is the first scientist to appear in Tintin books. The observatory, which is showed in the shooting star book, is inspired by a true example in Belgium. Even inside the observatory, it has similarities to its inspirational source.http://www.astro.oma.be/en/
ahoy, captain haddock!

The Shooting Star feels unique because it has a bit of a science fiction/fantastical feel to it, courtesy of the star and the almost magical island it creates - with those giant mushrooms!It's also notable for another appearance of a pre-Calculus Calculus-style professor and another nice Haddock insult ('woodlice') along with a good dose of slapstick, though what stood out this time around was the tension and fear in the opening.
Thanks to the threat of the approaching meteorite, Tintin becomes convinced that the end of the world is near and the melting streets and the general panic is shown really well.(Also extremely amusing to see that Haddock has been given an honorary position as President of the Society of Sober Sailors :D)
TinTin never disappoint!
This is a pretty big milestone for me - the very first French book I've read all on my own, from cover to cover. Sure, it has pictures, but it also has plenty of big words, and I understood enough of them to figure out what was going on. And I laughed at the funny parts, which, as any language learner will tell you, is a real triumph. Now to find more of these! I may need to place an order on amazon.fr.
Well, they can't all be masterpieces, I suppose. The premise is not good, but Herge plugs along admirably with good twists and suspense leading up to an exciting end. The art is, of course, excellent.
Great book amazing pictures.
i love tintin!!! the stories are unique and the characters are all so fun
