Millions of Cats is a short and fun story about the dangers of cat addiction, and how it's seemingly so illogical by showing the destructive side of cats, and how they're generally mean and unfriendly and awful pets.But then by showing just one good, humble cat everything changes, and we remember why the Internet was invented in the first place: to share lolcats and cat gifs.For educational and historical reasons, it's a must read.
And furthermore, because there is an element of disbelief present (the old man brings home not just too many cats, but millions of them) this probably renders the author's, Wanda Gág's presented text much less problematic for children, who often seem able to accept the often grotesque violence in fairy and folk tales, simply because it is unbelievable, or just too overly exaggerated.For me, Millions of Cats is not only an entertaining and intriguing story (albeit one with illustrations that I personally do not find all that aesthetically attractive), but also presents a cautionary tale about human responsibility, or more to the point, the lack of human responsibility.
I know people don't like jokes at the expense of the lives of animals, but it was still a joke.This book was published in 1928 - the Roaring 20s.
I don't know if Wanda meant it this way and I don't know if she foresaw the future, but it works as an allegory for the times it was published.
There were millions of cat which could be the prosperity of the people and stock market.
Wanda was quite an author and I enjoyed this funny little book.
When the cats started to fight, their eyes got real big and the little guy asked, what's going to happen.
I thought I was going to absolutely adore this story based on the charming illustrations and the idea of a man who sets out to bring home a kitty for his wife, only to find that every cat he sees is just too cute to pass up so he brings home "millions of cats." However...SPOILERI thought the end was quite dreadful!
:-/ I'm too much a cat lover to approve--no matter how adorable the sketches of the remaining kitten might be.
Creepy children's story about an old couple who long for a cat. When the old man finds the valley of cats he cannot choose the prettiest so he brings all million of them home. Where they ultimately eat each other. And the old idiots live happily ever after! WTF?
I read it only because it’s a selection of the Newbery book club for the Children's Books group, and I’m not participating until they get to 1953 or so (mostly because of reading time considerations; I do like the idea of reading every single Newberry and Newberry honor book), but this was an unusual Newbery selection: a short picture book.I’ve been reading others’ comments and thought that I’d be repulsed by this book; I am not a fan of the macabre.However, the illustrations and layout and general appearance was terrific.
I remember my grandmother sending me this book in a care package when I was young. I enjoyed this so much. I can still see the illustrations in my head. This adorable story about an old man and his cats was one of my most favorites growing up.
“Millions of Cats” may have a gruesome solution to the couple’s problem with having so many cats, but this book is still a great book for children to read for many years.Wanda Gag’s story is cute and creative as it details a very old couple’s desire to have a cat to care for and put an end to their loneliness.
The images of the very old couple were the true highlights of the book as they look a bit pudgy and yet have cheerful expressions on their faces all throughout the book.Parents should know that the solution to where the couple tries to have one cat out of all the millions of cats that the very old man brought home is a bit too disturbing for smaller children.
I had a 60 minute break between classes at school, and, to kill time, I decided to go to the library and read a book short and easy enough to be able to finish it fast.So I picked Millions of Cats.
I could tell this was a vintage/classic children's book, but I wasn't sure exactly how much vintage/classic it was.A LOT.I started reading thinking, "oh, what a cute story!
I somehow doubt it - maybe when it was published, but I don't see how children can relate to its cruelty and cattibalism (that's 'cat cannibalism') and not feel shocked by it.

Millions of Cats it's a children's classic in American literature, any cat's lover should have it in his bookshelf! It's a funny comical illustrated little story, perfect for any kids. As we know from youtube videos anything with cute fluffy cats will go viral!!Too cute!!Gosh I love them *:*4.5/5 STARS
"Hundreds of cats. Thousands of cats. Millions and billions and trillions of cats."This was a childhood favorite for me, so I couldn't be more thrilled that my own children love it now. P.S. The cats do eventually (view spoiler)[eat each other up (hide spoiler)] so if that's not your cup of tea, best to skip this book.
This book was written in 1928, won the Newbury Award in 1929 & is recognized as the first modern picture book.
This is my first time reading this classic & I was pleasantly surprise.
I guess I can see how some would call it "gruesome" towards the end by today's standards but I've noticed most old folk tales, fairy tales, or fables do have serious consequences to some extreme extent.
I don't hold that against it considering when it was written & how well the moral of the story still holds up today~ vanity is evil & can be destructive.
Can I just say the old man picking out a cat on the hill is pretty much like me tryig to pick a book in a bookstore... ?This story book is quite quaint, and cute to boot, since it's filled with cats. Great to read out loud to the little ones.
I've got mixed feelings about this book. It was engaging and drew me in, but at another level it was repulsive. It does show the disastrous impact of letting greed and vanity take over - and I think children can easily see that the old man collecting all those cats had no common sense. I liked the rhythmic style of the writing, and the overall "craziness" of the story.
One of my all time favorite picture books. Wanda Gag was so cool. Love everything she has ever done.
A simple story about an elderly couple picking out a pet cat turns into a comment about the subjectivity of beauty and value of humility.
This complaint is ludicrous.**Spoilers**An old man brings a horde of cats (millions, to be more precise) home to his wife.
They can't choose the most beautiful one, so they go inside and leave the horde outside to sort it out amongst themselves.
When the couple emerge from the house the next morning, they discover a bare hillside because the cats have eaten each other.
The story of a "very old man and a very old woman" and the way how they found their new kitten left me with a misgiving feeling.
However, I enjoyed the use of some key phrases such as “the very old lady”, “the very old man”, “and hundreds, thousands, millions, billions, and trillions of cats”, or “"Cats here, cats there, Cats and kittens everywhere", and also the irony of the whole story.
I imagine I could use this book for a reading aloud activity to pre school students because the repetition of those very catching phrases would engage students and reinforce the use of qualifying adjectives next to simple nouns.
A cautionary tale about the danger of relocating wildlife.An old man removes an entire population of cats from their native ecosystem, only to discover he lacks the knowledge and resources to care for them on his own.
"What are you doing?" the old woman he lives with cries when she sees the cats, aware, as he is not, of how unsuited the creatures are for their new environment.
Only a single small kitten survives, young enough to live on the milk the man and woman are able to provide, but it faces an uncertain future as it grows "nice and plump" and nears adulthood.
This reads like a fairy tale. I particularly liked the pages where the cats drank all of the water and ate all of the grass. This is an early introduction to the concept of carrying capacity. I didn't much care for the emphasis on being pretty ... but in the end, the 'homely' cat found a home, so that sends a message in itself.
A story of an old couple that wanted a kitten. The old man traveled miles to find a kitten then finds hundreds, thousands, millions ,billions and trillions of cats. They all follow him home plus the kitten.A classic story book, beautifully illustrated; winning the Newberry award.
3.5 starsShort yet entertaining. Absurdly funny at times. Being a cat person, it's somehow relatable how I sometimes just wanna grab and take home a random pretty kitty I happen to spot on the streets.
2.5 out of 5
We had a lot of laughs as we read this one aloud. It didn’t help that the kids read the millions part in a President Trump voice.
**** Newbery Honor (1929) ****On an early December morning in 1999, a sweet little girl named Xiana (zee-ahna) was abducted near her home while waiting for the school bus.
A large manhunt was organized in the community, at first concentrating close to the little girls home, but eventually expanding out in a 25 mile diameter.
Eight months after little Xiana disappeared, another 8-year-old girl is abducted three blocks from her home.
Later she was able identify the man who had kidnapped her, and evidence quickly connected him to the disappearance and murder of Xiana as well.
I have to say the cover didn't really appeal to me with the orange, yellow, and black.
When I started to read the story I have to say that a song popped in my head when the old man set out to get his wife a cat.
I thought the story was good.
But, it did not have that "I have to share this factor." The illustrations were black and white, not something that attracts most kids.
By repeating amounts of cats several times in the story.
I did not like the fate of the cats
Because my son was born in Wanda Gag's hometown, New Ulm, MN, and we had then a family of 15 all-indoor cats, Millions of Cats was an appropriate favourite. I had to read that dang thing regularly for about eight years before he finally tired of it. "Hundreds of cats, thousands of cats" etc gets in my head like an insistent pop song, but somehow it's still fun to say.

Please don't tell my cat about this book, she thinks she IS the most beautiful of all!
Good points about the company that a cat provides, how hard it can be to choose, and how love and attention is good for pets, but the solution for the surplus of cats is disturbing.
Did all those millions of cats really eat each other??
