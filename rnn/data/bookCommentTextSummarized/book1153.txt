The Curious Case of Benjamin Button: And Other Stories, F.
Somerset Maugham, Frank O'Connor, Susan Sontag, Haruki MurakamiThe Curious Case of Benjamin Button is a short story written by F.
It was subsequently anthologized in his book Tales of the Jazz Age, which is occasionally published as The Curious Case of Benjamin Button and Other Jazz Age Stories.تاریخ نخستین خوانش: روز بیستم ماه ژانویه سال 2011 میلادیعنوان: ماجرای عجیب بنجامین باتن و داستان‌های دیگر؛ نویسنده: اف.
Although this collection contains other short stories by F.
Scott Fitzgerald, I'm basing my rating solely on the main title short story of this anthology.
Many times, I wish short stories elaborated more because I love great character and plot development, but I feel this was more about the concept of Benjamin living his life backwards than anything else.
4.5 stars.I didn't rate the other handful of short stories on here because they varied from me really liking them to scratching my head.
Overall, they were an average 3 stars and didn't want to take the rating away from the main title.
It was interesting to see someone age in reverse but the story skipped over so much and although Button was a tragic character, he was also a dick so...you know.The Lost Decade was an interesting story about a person who (wait for it) was out of society for a decade for unknown reasons and what they missed.Bridal Party is kind of the anti-"The Graduate." A man thinks he can stop the wedding of a woman he loves.
It doesn't go well.Three Hours Between Planes is my favorite of the bunch.
This audiobook is a collection of short stories he wrote.
I've read these stories before but it's been a while so I thought it would be a good time to see if my opinions on the stories changed over the years.
Turns out they have not; I would still rate Benjamin Button 4 stars and the rest of the stories 3 stars.
The reason why this certain collection gets a 4 star rating is because of the narrators who read the stories.
They MADE this audiobook experience wonderful and more intriguing than if I had just reread the stories in print.
I'll definitely be keeping this audiobook in my collection.
I think I saw a film that I liked based on this & the love interest is what made it so good, but very different than this short story.
3 starsLost decade -- was a bit too short & didn't really make its point well for me, but now I know where Spider Robinson got the idea for his time travel story in Callahan's Crosstime Saloon.
Part of that is because I was more in tune with the times, but Robinson also did the characters better.
3 starsOverall, worth reading since it was fairly short.
Definitely worth reading if you skip the title story.
Vi la película y tenía curiosidad de leer el libro. ¿Qué harías si tu vida va al revés?
I love his prose. No one can place words together like him. Strangely enough I found Benjamin Button the least engaging, and I'm taking a star off the rating because of its inclusion. It's an interesting idea but Fitzgerald is not at his best when he attempts magical realism.The stories mostly follow Fitzgerald's well mined themes: the unattainable woman, regret about the past, and lost opportunities.

Short collection of short stories by Fitzgerald. If there's a common theme, besides dealing with the well-to-do of the time, they are about the past and how it can't be re-realized. My favorite of the bunch was "Three Hours Between Planes" because it dealt with how your memories of unrequited love might not be remembered in the same way by the object of your long-term longing. This felt the most personal of the bunch.
4,5🌟
Libro muy mal maquetado. Faltan guiones, palabras, letras, espacios...El contenido es muy bueno. Hay un par de cuentos muy chulos.
Benjamin Button was the best story of the collection, but I didn't find the rest very engaging.
You have to tell yourself often though that this is a fantasy because it's a story that manipulate time: Benjamin ages in reverse.It's such a clever way to reflect how we build social norms around "age".I can see that a lot of things have changes in a better way (e.g. we now see a 70 yr old lady attending university) but still Fitgerald's story about Benjamin Button is a classic that illustrate the way we relate to each other using age and physical appearance as a criteria.
I like that the conversation between Benjamin's father and 70 yr old new born Benjamin finally shows that you can not treat an old man the same way as you treat a baby or a child.
Dora and I listened to the first story, Benjamin Button, on our way up to Wisconsin; it's only a little more than an hour long.
We agreed it was interesting and enjoyable.
I thought it was impressive how Fitzgerald managed to make this premise work, even though it's so absurd.
I listened to the remaining three or four stories on my own.
They were interesting, too, and much more realistic.
But they seemed too short to me, like extracts from longer works.
I don't have much experience with short stories.
A great collection of shorts by one of the most amazing writers of the twentieth century."Babylon Revisited" is a story that delves into the life of a man that made the big bucks in the Jazz Age and how his life was affected by that "wealth".
A beautiful, touching, and frustrating story.
One of my favorite shorts of Fitzgerald."The Curious Case of Benjamin Button" is a fantastical short story that is an insightful view of the progress of life.
I didn't see the movie, but picked this book up the other day figuring it would be a good introduction to Fitzgerald.
While the premise is interesting, the delivery sucked.
The characters had zero depth, and the narrative bland.
It would have made an interesting Twilight Zone or Amazing Stories episode though!Unfortunately, Benjamin Button was the best story in this collection.
Just when a story begins to build, it ends abruptly.I suppose I should read The Great Gatsby to see why Fitzgerald is such a celebrated author, but after these stories, I'm certainly not in any hurry.
Short stories are interesting because so many things are unsaid. A good short story will imply a lot of depth in few words. Some of these stories were thought-provoking, and others left me thinking "that's it? !" But they all seemed to reflect on the past and how it can't be escaped nor re-lived, which I think is a lesson everyone learns the hard way.
I'll listen to a couple dozen books a year, and so far in '18, this was the worst. Not bad, but not my cup of tea. Fitz will always be a legend, but these stories aren't legendary. I won't say this often, but the movie was better. Round up 3, but right on the border

چقدر یک داستان کوتاه می تونه خوب باشه؟؟بنجامین باتن همون قدر خوب بود...عالی بود...اگر به اعتبار همین قصه بود، 5 می دادم، و همینطور خوندن داستان هولدن که فکر اولیه ی ناطور دشت بود، برام جالب بود...
What a bizarre story, it's difficult to suspend belief long enough to enjoy the story. While I didn't find it wonderful, it was amusing.
This felt like a snippet from a larger story and I don't really know how I feel about it.-Bridal party(4/5): A man gets a notice from his first love that she is getting married.
He feels like he must tell her that he still loves her just in case she feels the same way and is only marrying the other man for his money.
This story was incredibly short and didn't really seem to have a point.Overall, they were well-written but I only felt like one of these stories was really complete.
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is one of the best and thought-provoking short stories I have ever read.
At various points in this story, I wish Fitzgerald could have elaborated more on the plot and character development, but I guess there wasn't much to expand upon for a short story.
I wasn't invested in any of the characters, and some of the plots just felt like people were going through weird emotional dilemmas coming from the middle of nowhere.
Curious case of Benjamin Button, F.
The first one and the one that gives the title to the book, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, is exactly that, a curious account of a man who is born looking and behaving like he is 70, and who, instead of aging, he gets younger.
but it has, and it shows high ratings (it features Cate Blanchett and Brad Pitt.The other stories don’t have anything supernatural like Benjamin Button, they are just stories who could have happened, and in them I saw his Great Gatsby characters, and the society and atmosphere he depicts so well.
I enjoyed the film "The Curious Case of Benjamin Button" years ago when it came out and wanted to read the Fitzgerald story on which it was based.
However, that age is long gone and, while I appreciate his fiction for what is it--well-written, incisive commentary on his day--it is ever-so dated.Most of the stories in this small collection are depressing, dealing with unrequited love, much like his seminal work The Great Gatsby.I will read more Fitzgerald, as I have in the past, but not as my first choice in leisure reading.At least it got me part of the way through painting our porch.
Es curioso que esta historia fuera ideada por un escritor americano, pues el carácter me ha recordado a varias historias inglesas que he leído, donde da igual lo extraño de la situación, lo único importante es saber guardar la etiqueta y las maneras en todo momento. Si no... ¡¿Qué pensarán los vecinos?!La historia es sencilla y breve, pudiendo leerse de una sentada. La película de Brad Pitt solo coge la idea base y crea con ella su propia hsitoria más amplía, con personajes propios y aprovechando para comentar sobre la sociedad de la época.
When I read Fitzgerald's novels, they are often difficult to get through but when I'm finished, I love them. These stories were different as I enjoyed them all the way through! They were all strange but Fitzgerald wrote great interesting character interaction and that is reflected in this collection.
"Ya no recordaban porque, inevitablemente, las personas olvidan.""Todo se había esfumado un frágil sueño, pura imaginación, como si jamás hubiera existido.""No siempre me amarás a mí más que a nadie.""Ella, a la que había amado, hasta que ambos habían comenzado a abusar de su amor insensatamente, a destrozarlo."
Como siempre, Fitzgerald crea buenas tramas con buenos personajes, pero nunca las desarrolla lo suficiente.
It was a most unusual premise for a story, but very effectively carried out. The other three stories were concise and to the point, leaving the reader much to ponder.
