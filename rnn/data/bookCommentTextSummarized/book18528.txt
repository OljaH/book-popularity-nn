“I will die. You will die. We will all die and the universe will carry on without care. All that we have is that shout into the wind - how we live. How we go. And how we stand before we fall.” I *almost* didn't write a review for Golden Son. It doesn't matter how many reviews I write or how snarky I've been in the past, there is something extremely intimidating about writing a negative review for a book that all my friends loved, that critics praised, and that has an average Goodreads rating of
Even when he fails, he fails like a damn hero with fireworks going off behind his head, rushing back to rescue a damsel in distress in true, self-sacrificing perfection.Even when he fails, he doesn't fail.Even when things are awful, he has to deliver a melodramatic, rousing speech.Darrow is possibly the most self-obsessed character caricature I have ever come across.
I feel like there is literally nothing I’m reading for… I don’t care how the war ends, I don’t care if Darrow lives or dies, I don’t care about any relationships.
Did I mention that I listened to these almost exclusively as audiobooks?I did. And the narration was, to put it plainly, purely brilliant. Dude knocked it out of the park.In fact, the narrative voice was so strong that when I picked up a paper copy of the book so I could read it faster. (I read about 5 or 6 times faster off the page.) The narrator's voice stuck with me in my head, like when you read some text next to a picture of Morgan Freeman.So yeah. Not just some excellent books. But excellent audio production as well.
I love the epic scope of this story and the pacing is perfect.
But on the other hand, I love a lot of the other characters (Sevro is my favorite!) and there are so many brilliant, beautiful lines I could quote this book for days.This series so far is awesome, clever, and incredibly unexpected--I could never predict what crazy thing was going to happen next, I was just hanging on for dear life yet thoroughly enjoying the wild ride.
BOOK THREE NOW PLEASE THANK YOU.Check out my booktalk for spoilery discussion - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAyY0...
First off I love Darrow, Sevro, Ragnar, Quinn and Mustang and I swear .
Well, I love a lot of the side characters but I'm most in love right now with Sevro, Darrow and Ragnar in that order.
Let me just add some random excerpts that have to do with Darrow and Sevro and stuff!
Okay, so here is a moment that Darrow and Sevro had together after finding out a revelation.
Sevro spits in my face, right under the eye.
He knows and he came to help me.
"You are my friend," I tremble out like a child.
I call it my "false sense of urgency." It sometimes makes me impatient and unforgiving when I'm reading a book for the first time, and if the new book happens to be the latest installment of one of my favorite series, the possibility of that first read suffering the effects of my FSoU goes up exponentially.*glances sheepishly at GOLDEN SON* 1.
Maybe your kids will learn how to defy their bullies with Lego after reading this book since there are a lot of strategy and badasses involved here.Whether you’re one of those who loved (like me) or hated the previous book because of the plot, I’ll assure you that this time the plot took off in a completely different direction than before and it’s so much better.
(I’m actually typing this review after I read the first 2 chapter of Morning Star straight after finishing Golden Son, otherwise this review will consist only of me typing my foamy mouth into words “argh urgh fruha euehoqo dsuhckijk quhaorj uhjqpkco”.)Frankly, I didn’t expect myself to get attached to the characters in this book so much when I started the series but I do, I really do.
“I will die. You will die. We will all die and the universe will carry on without care. All that we have is that shout into the wind - how we live. How we go. And how we stand before we fall.”It’s been three days I finished “Golden Son” and I still don’t know how I  feel  about it, let alone what I  think  about it. >_< I’m just so confused and devastated and my heart is nothing but an empty void. There seem to be three bloodydamn good reasons why I feel that way though:1.) Pierce Brown ri
There seem to be three bloodydamn good reasons why I feel that way though:1.)	Pierce Brown ripped out my heart and gave it to the pitvipers.2.)	He broke my mind and didn’t leave any glue.3.)	His book shattered my soul and fractured it into tiny little pieces.
I mean just like Darrow he’s a product of his environment and he certainly didn’t deserve to be abused by Harmony.
And that means it’s part of who we are as people.”Sevro:”He stands quietly in his armor watching us, watching Roque hold the girl Sevro loves but has never told, the girl he could never have.
This comes out today. And you should read it because it's fucking awesome. RTC when I'm done with my re-read and can find the words to do this beast justice.
Really, I couldn't ask for more in a sequel.Fixed Issue #1: Super Slow BeginningFirst off, unlike Red Rising where I struggled with the first 100 pages, Golden Son starts off strong with plenty of action to keep the reader interested.
I'm so over that trope in books, so I was disappointed to see it in Red Rising.The good news is that Brown clearly took more care with showing us Mustang's strength.
(slight spoilers, but not really) There's one scene in Golden Son where Darrow finally has a chance to talk to Mustang after certain events have pulled them apart and she ends up close with Cassius.
But some other times, those rare moments he chose to trust, to protect the weak, to arm a terrifying giant and make love to the girl who stole his heart, he was a fiery Red. In the end, Darrow is both.
There were also a couple of scenes so powerful and raw, in their simple gestures and scarce dialogues, that make you sob and feel and want to reach for Darrow and hold his hand.
Darrow kept friends at arm's length and miscalculated people, only to pay with blood in the astounding, devastating ending that shred my soul to pieces.
Rating: 4.5 starsIt's hard to believe that there can be even more action after Red Rising, but lo and behold! My heart breaks for these characters... they have loved and lost so much, but they just keep on fighting for what they believe is right. It was great spending more time with this crew, and meeting some fantastic new characters, too! I love Darrow's brain - he comes up with the most clever, and often crazy, plans, and it was so much fun (yet stressful) seeing them unfold.
I did not want???Also Sevro is a nasty little shit and I love him to death.Also 10/10 to the audiobooks, I love this series WAY better listening because my mind actually absorbs what I'm reading because apparently my eyeballs aren't connected to my brain but my ears are.
Lovely.*** READ #1, February 2015 ***Woah...how do I even begin to talk about this book?!
I felt Red Rising was really focused on Darrow...but Golden Son was really focused on politics and war.
I feel like my non-loves of this book is very much "it's me not you".
It's a fantastic book, but I wanted more Darrow.
Two years after Red Rising left off we meet the Reaper/Darrow again. He has moved on to the Academy-He is the Golden child right? Then right as he tastes that brass ring; it gets yanked away.That's one thing about the Red Rising stories. They will twist you into a million different knots before they destroy you.If your heart beats like a drum,and your leg's a little wet,it's 'cause the Reaper's cometo collect a little debt.

Two years after Red Rising left off we meet the Reaper/Darrow again.
Then right as he tastes that brass ring; it gets yanked away.That's one thing about the Red Rising stories.
In this book I didn't love Darrow-sometimes I found him just plain whiny or inconsistent (yes, I know he was supposed to be that way-doesn't mean it didn't get on my nerves).
The star of these book as was in the last book..Sevro and the Howlers.
I received an arc copy of this book from Netgalley in exchange for an honest review.Now what am I going to read?
Destroyed for all other books at this moment.
I am never emotionally prepared for this series but I am even less emotionally prepared for that cliffhanger.
❝My son, my daughter, now that you bleed, you shall know no fear, no defeat, only victory. Your cowardice seeps from you. Your rage burns bright. Rise, warrior of Gold, and take with you your Color’s might.❞  THAT ENDING. I AM SPEECHLESS. I don't even know what to say. This book was full of surprises. Literally. I did not see any of this coming. This series just keeps getting better and better. You'd think that Golden Son would suffer the "book before the finale" syndrome but NOPE. Not even cl
❝My son, my daughter, now that you bleed, you shall know no fear, no defeat, only victory.
You'd think that Golden Son would suffer the "book before the finale" syndrome but NOPE.
I just know it.My poor Darrow.
Please protect my babies!And let me just say that I ship Darrow and Mustang 1000%.
Mustang is a goddess and I hope she finally comes to her senses soon!LASTLY, WE NEED TO PROTECT SEVRO AND RAGNAR AT ALL COST.
Nobody is worthy of them.I can't even write a proper review because that ending just destroyed me and now I have to go binge read the finale.
5/5★★★★★What a fun Buddy Read with team Howlers; Speedy eye Oppa, Whorefart Aga, Dewi, Minxy & Voldemort   'If your heart beats like a drum and your leg's a little wet, it's 'cause the Reaper's come to collect a little debt.'   that ending......

Relax. it's just the sound of my mind being blown and my brains splattering the walls.Holy balls is right folks. How the hell did the author think of such an aw
I'm happy I can't say that about this book, it felt like a proper Sci-Fi. I loved the space ships I loved the pulse weapons I actually just loved everything, the world building was fantastic, the character development (especially Darrow) was so realistic and awesome & it was so exciting the action didn't stop once.
Should be military space opera or just plain old Sci - Fi.Who I do recommend this to is everyone who loves a good blood bath, also I think just everyone on this planet should read this book it's awesome and full of so many unexpected twists.
3.75⭐After the underwhelming and super unsatisfying Red Rising (which started out well then went downhills), Golden Son turned out to be a complete surprise in every aspect but one. And it would’ve been a solid 4⭐ read, were it not for the characters. The Plot:Golden Son continues with Darrow’s quest for vengeance and retribution and right off the bat, it started out with some much needed humbling and a vicious learning experience for him, which hyped me up for the rest of the book because the c
The Plot:Golden Son continues with Darrow’s quest for vengeance and retribution and right off the bat, it started out with some much needed humbling and a vicious learning experience for him, which hyped me up for the rest of the book because the constant unstoppable successes he’d been having and the whole 'too good to lose' thing was seriously getting far too much and plain unrealistic (the boy desperately needed some lesson in humility).

And even though I knew what was going to happen at the end and I knew it was coming and I was waiting for it to get there it still affected me so deeply and hurt just as much if not more than the first time.I'm pretty sure Pierce Brown just stuck a knife through my heart all over again.The good news is that I now only have to wait 4 days to see how the rest of this bloodydamn series plays out...instead of the year I had to wait before.THE GOLDS ARE GOING DOWNOriginal Review Dec 20144.5 GLORYDAMN StarsEveryone is comparing this book/series to Hunger Games, Enders Game and Game of Thrones well I say screw that….THIS IS THE SERIES OTHERS WILL COMPARE THEIR BOOKS TO.
I finished this baby awhile ago, and loved every action packed minute. I'm anticipated Morning Star this February!!!
The story picked up where the first book ended, but not quite.
The concept of betrayal and death gives this book a shark edge, one I've only ever seen in GOT.
There is a general down to earth reality in the characters of this book that captured my attention since book one.
It lead me to feel for the characters more than I have in most books that I have read.
Overall I adored this book, and yes even though I have been giving out a lot of high stars lately, I think this one is probably my favorite book since 2015.
Reading Golden Son is arduous af.This installment shifts to a tech-heavy and space-centric sci-fi novel, which feels like a stark contrast in the wake of Red Rising.
In Golden Son, Brown continues to cultivate the heart of this narrative; an ever beating chord of sentiment, perfectly balanced with the gory realities of war.
Golden Son reads differently than Red Rising, and I believe this is one of the more notable aspects of this book.
If Darrow is the golden light of the sun, then Sevro is the velvet darkness of space, you cannot have one without the other.This is a captivatingly rare middle book that will leave you bewildered, heart broken and thirsting for more.
Epic roller coaster ride from start to finish! I'd have given it 6 stars if I could. At the end of the first book of this trilogy, Darrow Au Andromedus, after winning the Institutes barbaric challenge, kneels before his enemy and agrees to become his adopted son. The second book in the trilogy begins two years later with Darrow at the head of a fleet of warships battling a simulated war against house Bellona's oldest son Karnus for victory in the graduation test of the Academy. I won't spoil ev
The second book in the trilogy begins two years later with Darrow at the head of a fleet of warships battling a simulated war against house Bellona's oldest son Karnus for victory in the graduation test of the Academy.
I couldn't help but relate with Darrow in the first book and that continued and deepened in the second.
I think there is nothing better than reading something and going "BEEEELP!!!" There was enough of that in this book to make it easily my favorites of all time.
Seriously, I think I finally read a book that has dislodged Ender's Game as my favorite book of all time.
IT'S LIVE  "Hic sunt leones." The stakes have risen. Friends become enemies, and enemies become allies. Who can Darrow trust as his journey to destroy his corrupt society continues? Golden Son is a jaw-dropping, fast paced addition to the Red Rising Trilogy, full of intrigue, courage and fast-paced action that left my heart pounding.  For seven hundred years, my people have been enslaved without voice, without hope. Now I am their sword. Bloodydamn. This book had me on the edge of my seat. The g
Who can Darrow trust as his journey to destroy his corrupt society continues?
Golden Son is a jaw-dropping, fast paced addition to the Red Rising Trilogy, full of intrigue, courage and fast-paced action that left my heart pounding.
This book had me on the edge of my seat.
Darrow's fight for survival and the freedom of his people has just begun.
This book still has me reeling - I will have more to say, but I am still trying to wrap my head around everything that happened.
"Rise so high, in mud you lie."
In secret, he is a Red, a slave from the depths of Mars sent by the Sons of Ares to infiltrate the halls of power and prepare the revolution...From what I would consider the most overrated book I have read in quite a while to one of the best dystopian novels I have ever read, the transition from Red Rising to Golden Son is, to use a common metaphor, like the transition from night to day.
It's like Pierce Brown designed him to be the perfect knight, and mostly succeeded.The book also includes one hell of an example of astounding character development in Nero au Augustus.
EDIT: just finished this bloodydamn good book for the second time and I am completely shattered, wrecked, and in absolute overwhelming despair.
Surely a small price to pay to read a bloodydamn good book?), I wouldn't change any of it, coherent or not.
I don't have any dobut that more than the setting, it's Darrow and how he stands up against the social injustice of the Golds and their mentality that truly makes this book shine.And the twists!
THIS BOOK KILLED ME.I FEEL LIKE I JUST WATCHED A DRAMA SET IN ANCIENT ROME - FULL OF LIES, BETRAYALS, AND CONSPIRACIES.
“They say a kingdom divided against itself cannot stand. They made no mention of the heart.”   This is more of a 2 1/2 stars and I enjoyed it slightly more than the previous book. Friends please don't kill me, I tried, but I just can't find myself to love it. D:Dw, there will be no spoilers in my review. I won't be talking about the plot or anything bc then that will spoil those of you who haven't read Red Rising.I tried so hard and I had so much hope I would end up liking this bc of PEOPLE,
I won't be talking about the plot or anything bc then that will spoil those of you who haven't read Red Rising.I tried so hard and I had so much hope I would end up liking this bc of PEOPLE, PEOPLE and PEOPLE were tellesing me this gets so much better and I'm just sittin' there like when???
10/10 won't bc like if I disliked the first two books then I definitely ain't likin' the third.※As I've said so many times in my review for Red Rising, it was extremely boring for me.
"...So it's pride." "It's always pride." "Pride is just a shout into the wind." He shakes his head, voice deepening. "I will die. You will die. We will all die and the universe will carry on without care. All that we have is that shout into the wind-how we live. How we go. And how we stand before we fall." He leans forward. "So you see, pride is the only thing..."   Red Rising took me by surprise... Way way by surprise. Golden Son did the same and then some. I have no idea where Pierce Brown
Characters I don't even want to mention will have you freaking out.The plot of this story is just action, unlike the first which was a lot of info dumping and world building, Golden Son is just nonstop the whole time.
There's so much suffering, pain, and sorrow pushed into this book.This novel had me freaking out and wanted to flip tables until the ending...
Take everything you love in books, throw in a bitchin ending, gore for days, and a touch of Star Wars and you'll get Golden Son. READ THIS BOOK REVIEW AND MORE AT: http://southernbredsouthernread.blogs...http://southernbredsouthernread.blogs...http://southernbredsouthernread.blogs...
(hide spoiler)]Original posts:Edit 30 NOV 2015: Yes, I am bumping this, but only because Golden Son WON the GRs Science Fiction category for best books in 2015 (in a landslide)!
I will be re-reading this before Morning Star is released in February 2016.Original post:I have so many feelings right now about this book that it’s hard to put in words.
However, in my view, the book is brilliant.Red Rising was more dystopian meets Lord of the Flies and Golden Son has much more of a sci-fi Star Wars vibe to it.
So far, Red Rising and Golden Son have been almost flawless, in my view.
•	Browns - Servants•	Obsidians - "Monstrous race only bred for war"•	Pinks - Pleasure slaves•	Reds - The unskilled and menial laborersDarrow, that young man that was born and raised in the mines of Mars as a Red, has some pretty traumatic things happen to him in Red Rising that has lead to him being the main tool in a rebellion for equality among the colors.
I'm going to make this review just a spoiler-free gush about some of the characters, because they really are the shining light of this elaborate tale, and I feel like this book was very much just setting up for Morning Star, while continuing just to break my heart and make me cry over and over.
I heard this was better and so I had to wait till I was in the mood again so I can enjoy it to maximum levels.🌟 In those 17 months, I grew up very much as a reader and more as a reviewer, I used to focus mostly on plot twists but now that’s not as important as I used to think.
I don’t know if the pace was slow, it didn’t feel so, but at the same time I feel it could have been a bit shorter, and it looks like the books aren’t getting any smaller!🌟 This was certainly better than book 1, less dense, less confusing and more intriguing.
