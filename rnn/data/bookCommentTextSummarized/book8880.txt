"No one else is or we wouldn't be assigned more pounds than ever before in the Carter.""Maybe he's more horse than ever raced in the Carter," someone suggested.
"After all, Henry, it's the handicapper's job to try to bring all horses down to the wire together.""And it's my job and privilege to withdraw my entry from a race when I think the weight assignment is excessive!" Henry bellowed at the top of his voice..."You mean you're going to start the Black in the Carter?" Alec asked...
"Then why'd you make such a fuss?""You wouldn't want anyone to think I was satisfied with the weights, would you?" Henry asked impatiently.
Not the strongest entry in the series.
Everyone is angry in this book.
There's more shouting than usual.
Henry shouts his way from the first page to the last.
There are some races, which are wonderful.
Is it a spoiler if I say that The Black wins most of 'em?
I wish I could travel in time to one of the races Farley was basing these on- I want to see the scrum of reporters elbowing each other to get to the jockey, I want to see the trainers shutting the top stall door in their faces.
Granted, it banks on the childlike wonder about horses that all kids share to some extent, but as an adult, there were elements that I appreciated that I (I'm not sure, I don't remember for sure) don't think I did as a kid.The sense of fear of death in racing horses, the serious business end of the horse business, the sadness over getting older and thinking about lost loved ones, so on.
The book makes clear that this shouldn't happen.I enjoyed this story, but in a different way than when I was a kid.
The Black Stallion's Courage is the best of the series since The Black Stallion and Satan. In a return to what made this series great, Walter Farley brings us back to basics with Alec Ramsey and The Black Stallion set to return to racing. Memories of the race in the desert, coupled with a challenge that only The Black could meet, make this an exciting read to the finish.
An edge of your seat, hope against hope story. If ever I had a hero, The Black and Alec Ramsey are it!
The best of the bunch
So, he takes Black Minx and the Black to some big name races in the East.One of my favorite things about this particular book is that we spend a lot of time living the life of a jockey, which I am intrigued by.
The atmosphere is almost light-hearted, like a fair, but at the same time, we’re dealing with horses with a lot of spirit who, if they lose, may never want to race again.Black Minx, the Black’s daughter, is unpredictable and thus kept my attention.
When an accident burns down some of the buildings at Hopeful Farm, Alec is horrified to realize that his insurance has lapsed, and he doesn't have enough money to rebuild.
Most of the money that is made by horse owners is in stud fees and foal sales.
To my understanding, the actual racing is more or less advertising your stud or broodmare.
But hey, it's a story.
And what a great story it is!!
"Here was gold that glistened as well as whinnied!"After coming off the strangeness of The Island Stallion Races, I'm really glad to get back to the normalcy of the basic of Farley.And the Black is back on the track - which is amazing. So we've go good, old fashioned horse racing: rivalry, friendship, victory, defeat, and a trio of amazing racehorses going head to head to head!
loved every book in this series....my best friend Laura and I couldn't read them fast enough
A good read for kids.
And Farley does it well enough that when the time comes, we know why the different weights carried by the different horses is so important and we feel the tension with Alec and Henry about the weight the Black has to carry versus the rest of the field’s.
Farley is not necessarily the best writer in terms of style, but he is an effective one.Simply put, I eat up The Black Stallion’s Courage every time I read it.
To put it in perspective, I’ve read this book four or five times, whereas I’ve read the “prequel,” The Black Stallion’s Filly, maybe twice.
The Black Stallion's Sulky Colt The Island Stallion Races The Black Stallion's Courage The Black Stallion Mystery The Horse-Tamer (all by Walter Farley) I stepped away from my re-read of this series as I just knew the two books listed first were coming up.
These two (Sulky Colt and Island Stallion Races) were even worse than I remembered.
I wonder if The Island Stallion Races is what turned me off of sci-fi.
The Horse-Tamer isn't really part of the series but is about the Black's trainer Henry Dailey as a boy.
I read these years ago, then forgot most everything, and read them out of sequence this time.
I will definitely recommend if you have not yet read the prior book (The Black Stallion's Filly, you should do so first.
It sets the stage for this entire book.Alec Ramsay brings back the Black to try for more racing history in this book.
It is a fair description of the racing industry, with some jibes and some amazingly unrealistic things.
Yes, this is a children's book; let the kids enjoy it, but get them out there with a real horse if you want a real education for the kids.
If you want to know what life is like at the racetrack, pick up one of Walter Farley's books!
It is incredibly hard to find an author who captures the essence of the horse, the race, or the track the way Farley does.
To top all of that off, he is an amazing adventure writer for anyone in the mood for a quick chapter book read.
Some parts of the story are a little contrived, but that was the adventure style of the time.
I will always say that young readers who love horses should be given this book (indeed, the entire series) as a gift.
I might not have liked Courage so much if it hadn't been for a not really liking a few that came before it. It has quite a few things happen that I find pretty unlikely, but after the last few books, it was actually pretty good and helped me become reinvested in my reading of the series.Like so many others, it's really just okay, but it's more fun than some others, and I think most people will enjoy it.
I enjoyed the characters, and their world and hope I get the chance to read the story again and/or to read more within the series.My Rating System:* couldn't finish, ** wouldn't recommend, *** would recommend, **** would read again, ***** have read again.
I raced through this series as a child. Of course, "The Black Stallion" was my favorite, and I read it a few times, but I waited eagerly for any of the books to return to my branch of the library so I could snap them up.
Due to a fire at Hopeful Farm, The Black will be making a comeback! Walter Farley certainly doesn't let his love for The Black keep him from making this an exciting and suspenseful book.
So far, one of my favourites in the series.
my favorite book in the series.
This was one of my favourite Black Stallion novels. I liked the competition between the Black and Casey and enjoyed seeing numerous different horses and their racing experiences. I love Black Minx!
The first book was the story of a boy and a horse, but the series grows with books on similar themes of overcoming adversity and animal/human bonding. Loved them as a kid.
Great book, again. It did get a little monotonous with all the races having pretty much the same result...
There was not a Black Stallion book that I could ever put down. The stories are the best.
I gobbled up all of these books when I was in my horse phase.
My fave of the series
Definately a book to read.
