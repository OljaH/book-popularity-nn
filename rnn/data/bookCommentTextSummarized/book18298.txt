**short story prequel The Mermaid Girl available today!!**and as a bonus, here is a really dark and blurry picture of me with the author, who is either delighted or terrified by my drunken enthusiasm about her book: this book is for all you fans of The Night Circus or Geek Love. BUT - if you hated The Night Circus, don't run off just yet, because this is both better-written and much darker. BUT - those of you who are turned off by me saying "much darker" should know it's not too dark. there, i t
the book is a log from a traveling carnival dating back to the 1700's, and simon discovers that it contains information about his ancestors, which calls his attention to a freaky coincidence: generations of circus mermaids* related along the female line all died by drowning on july 24th.
alternating with simon's narrative is the fleshed-out story from the log, which documents the travels of peabody's; the traveling carnival where simon and enola's ancestors, amos and evangeline, meet and initiate the cycle that will affect subsequent generations.
I fell asleep at my desk, having spent the last day teaching myself about curses and searching for Ryzhkova. The National Archives were lacking in ship manifests pre-1800, but allowed me to track bibliographies that led to the New York Public Library’s archives and manifests from 1600 on... This is a book about a whiny narrator doing research. And also about tarot cards.The Book of Speculation is a strange novel and, really, that's its greatest merit. Many different - flat and lifeless - charac
Instead, it's about the boring character of Simon Watson - stealing books from the library and conducting tedious research into why the women of his family might be cursed to die on July 24.The flashback - or, more accurately, the book Simon receives - starts off in a more interesting way.
It features the story of two young lovers who are also carnival acts - Amos is a former wild boy and now reads tarot cards, Evangeline is a "mermaid" because she can hold her breath for a long time.
There is something a little fascinating about tarot cards, but this book drained every bit of excitement out of them.
The story of the Book of Speculation takes place in two time periods.
Simon is our present day main character.
All the women in it have been able to hold their breath for long periods of time but they all have died at an early age.
Simon receives a book from a collector that unlocks links to his families past.
He becomes obsessed with breaking the curse of the mermaids (carnival mermaids) that haunts his family.Then you have the rest of the story.
He falls in love with Evangeline, who shows up at the show one day distraught with a special gift of being able to hold her breath under water.
I'm bored. So much dullness and uneventfulness that I can't take it anymore. I'll just read something else and leave this to people who don't mind one dimensional characters, unending + unnecessary descriptions and a depressive atmosphere. Ugh, DNF.

which is OK, I like the unknown magic aspects, but given this was such a strong and powerful story, I wanted a little more depth to the core of "why."
Average Rating:  3 Stars•Past Chapters: 4 Stars•Present Chapters: 2 starsI felt like this book was a gyp. The blurb oversold this as more interesting than it actually was. The "mermaids" here are not the kind that transform and have a fish tail, they are just mundane people who can hold their breath. Ugh. I get that this is magical realism and everything, but that just feels cheap.The most interesting story takes place in the past and involves a fortune teller. This is the backbone of the book
Ugh. I get that this is magical realism and everything, but that just feels cheap.The most interesting story takes place in the past and involves a fortune teller.
This is the backbone of the book and the only part that's entertaining, TBH.The chapters that take place in the present are so heavily weighed down with melancholy that I started hating when the story would shift back into today.
Like a scammy fortune teller, The Book of Speculation pulls you in with an interesting premise but fails to live up to the hype it as created for itself.
Wow...
Wow...
Wow...
This book was simply amazing.
I'm not usually drawn to books of this nature but I thrive on how the author uses one book, a book that began with one man who ran a carnival with 3 people in it that change the course of the characters lives.
Swyler braids these families together in the book with nothing out of place, no "hairs" loose.
Truly a captivating story about family and love and how our roots can help us grow wings.
Read this novel it doesn't disappoint and is magical in a way that makes your heart twinkle!!
:)Also, for being a librarian, Simon doesn't act very librarian-y.Take this part when he receives the mysterious book: "The box contains a good-sized book, carefully wrapped.
I don't think so.But my biggest librarian-related beef with this book is when (view spoiler)[Simon steals books from the library.
(hide spoiler)]The fantasy/magic portions of this book are subtle and written so that one could almost believe that it was real.Take Amos' (one of the characters from the old book) ability to disappear: "People may live for a century without discovering the secret of vanishing.
(view spoiler)[He's the only male "mermaid" mentioned in here other than Simon, right?
Imagine being sent a book, with pictures of tarot cards, descriptions of traveling show acts and realizing you are reading about your own family.Told in two separate time periods, the present and the late 1700's,this is a book that has a little of everything.A mute boy who is originally a wild boy in the traveling show but than is taught to read cards.Tarot cards, and a curseLove and murder,Mysterious drownings,Strange occurrences at certain births.Family loyalFriendshipsA man who can light up bulbs with his bodyFamily secretsAll this comes together rather brilliantly in the end.
Madame Ryzkova is certain the girl, Evangeline, is a Rusalka (water nymph or mermaid), but Amos is deaf to her entreaties to leave Evangeline alone.As Simon gradually finds out more about his family history, the themes and items from the past and current day become more and more intertwined: circuses with power-filled tarot cards and mermaids.
Amos and Evangeline are more appealing and interesting, though they each have a tragic streak that tends to tip over into fatalism.Erika Swyler weaves together several intriguing elements in The Book of Speculation, with some enchanting magical realism touches: tarot cards really work, as do curses.
In the present time, Simon is a young librarian who receives a book that is believed to contain information regarding his family.
One of the problems that I had with this book is that anytime something would become interesting in either timeline the book would immediately switch to the other period of time.
With the exception of Enola and Doyle, the characters in the present time are B-O-R-I-N-G.
The only characters that I actually liked in this book were Amos and Doyle.
Doyle's role in the story is rather minor but he was my favorite character in the book.
This book consists of two stories, one present and one past.
He learns to read the Tarot from his mentor, Madame Ryzhkova, and falls in love with Evangeline, a beautiful "mermaid" who can hold her breath for many minutes, greatly impressing the crowds.
A curse seems to have followed Simon's maternal family down the centuries, and seems to be connected to the book he's been sent -- a book which mentions Amos and Madame Ryzhkova.
These characters were alive and felt real, and are what kept me reading this book.
I just wish the present story had felt more like it deserved such writing.
On the one hand the characters never really grabbed me and a few of them actually antagonised me (Enola especially).
On the other hand the story is original and I thought it was paced really well.
I found it hard to put down and ended up staying up late to finish it.
The ending is particularly clever with a nice little twist that I did not see coming.
Okay, so reading what I have written so far I think I must give it four stars.
It is actually excellent for a debut novel and I look forward to reading her future books.
Wow. Just wow.
I didn't have many expectations when I picked this novel up on a whim, yet this is by far one of the best books I've read.
It's fresh and wildly innovated, gorgeously written, intelligently plotted, and utterly captivating.
I haven't had much luck with magical realism, but this book is what I feel like the genre is missing.
It has a puzzling mystery, depths that will drown you, well-developed characters, and a touch of curious magic that is spellbinding.
I read this in doses to better appreciate the text, and I would recommend reading this in chunks as it can be a bit tedious, yet still enjoyable, to read all in one sitting.
Suddenly his sister is calling saying she is coming home, and acting strangely as the day rapidly approaches.
The content is a bit dark, and the atmosphere is very similar to the Night Circus, a comparison I have heard several times before.
That was the primary reason I decided to pick this book up.However I failed to connect with any of the characters, not for lack of trying.
But that wasn't the reason I couldn't connect.
The real reason was I found pretty much all of the characters pretty selfish, and had a hard time connecting because of it.
2 stars--it was okay.This book has everything I usually like (a narrative based around an old book, hints of the supernatural, dual narratives), but the whimsy fell flat for me. I greatly disliked the narrator as well (if he said "sorry" one more time--without taking any action to change himself or his life--I was gonna slap him) and found the other characters pretty hard to connect with as well. The book just overall was kind of a downer for me.
An audio read with the last chapter or so finished off via paperback from Old Bar library while on holiday.
This was an interesting read, given my interest in books and employment in a library.
Simon has the blood lines of circus performers, and this is the focus of our story when using his librarian research skills, and that of his industry friends, discovers a dreadful curse that has befallen many women in his family - they have begun dying at a certain date in July.
I totally understood the budgetary restraints the industry is facing and understood Simon's predicament of being uncertain of his employment within the library.
A wonderful tale of mystery, magic, carnivals, mermaids, tarot and through it all is the book of speculation linking the lives of two families.
His family has a line of mermaids and an unsolved mystery running through it.
The writing flows beautifully and is full of mystery, magic and the urgency needed for Simon to solve the riddle the book has delivered to him.
It's such a great read and I would highly recommend it.
It certainly makes for a great summer read as its set beside the sea and rivers.
He has to figure this out before July 24th this year to save his sister Enola.
Two rotating story-lines make up this book- the present day where Simon is trying to save his family and figure out the key to his family's history.
The other story-line goes back to the circus in the early 1800's- tarot card readers, the Wild Boy, the strong man, and the mermaid- all characters that are far more interesting than present day Enola, Alice, and Simon.I love reading books about books, about circuses, about magical features running throughout the book.
In Erika Swyler's gorgeous debut novel, The Book of Speculation, Simon Watson receives an old ledger that once belonged to a traveling carnival in the mail, along with a note mentioning a connection to his late mother's family.
For generations, the women of his family, all with a talent for holding their breath, including his mother, have drowned on the same date.Dual narratives reveal Simon's growing concern for his fragile sister as July 24th approaches, and the truth of the tragic curse that has haunted their family since the early 1800's beginning with Evangeline, 'The Atlantis Mermaid'.
On the one hand, I gnerally hate books about the circus.
On the other, maybe mermaids?
I did like "The Night Circus".
Maybe this is another unexpected treasure?No. It was not.
The language was utterly precious.
And the protagonist, either utterly unbelievable or someone who needed a good punch in the face.
Some female writers can write male characters that "feel" male.
Not Simon, he didn't even feel like a real human being.
He was kind of like Sadness in the Inside Out movie.
Such was my irritation with the Simon the sad librarian that I could go no farther.
As Simon leafs through the tome, trying to understand the connection between his grandmother and this book that seems to be the journal of one Mr. Hermelius Peabody, owner of a travelling circus at the end of the 18th century, another narrative thread emerges, recounting events from the distant past, when there lived a mute boy called Amos and an ethereal girl called Evangeline, who both found a home with Hermelius Peabody's circus.
Even though she doesn't seem to appreciate this too much.There were a lot of ingredients with a high potential for building mystery and suspense (circuses, tarot cards, a strange book, inexplicably deaths by drowning taking place at the same date throughout the centuries), but they were totally lost in a slow-moving narrative, with boring events and boring characters.
Simon Watson, a small town librarian in rural Long Island, knows his mother was a "mermaid", a carnival performer who could remain submerged for extended periods.
Now in his late twenties, alone in the decaying cliffside house she loved, Simon feels trapped by the past, but compelled to remain in case his sister Enola, who has followed their mother into the itinerant life of a traveling circus, decides to return.
His life seems to be spiraling downwards -- his house looks like its going to be swept into Long Island Sound sooner rather than later, his job is about to be eliminated, he's in love with a woman he's known since childhood.
I'm done. I'm bored senseless. The 2 stories are dull and so are the characters. I was spoiled by "The Church of Marvels".
For a book that relies heavily on the theme of drowning, this quirky and unusual story is far from depressing as we look through family history and a curse that continues through the ages.
When he notices descriptions of long gone female relatives in it's pages Simon want's to find out more.What he will find is highly disturbing, with all the women in his family dying of drowning on the same date, July 24th.
Quite difficult to review honestly as it is one of those novels that you would not want to spoil for others.
But if you like past/present impact stories, family drama and truly remarkable characters then you will LOVE this, I have no doubt.The historical flavour in “The Book of Speculation” is marvellous – the world of the travelling circus comes magically to life, the carnie folk authentically drawn and absolutely compelling.
**I would like to thank Netgalley and St Martin's Press for an ARC of this book.**I love the ideal of this book, but it wasn't really for me.
I think the only person I really liked in the book is Mr. Churchwarry.
After doing a lot of research he finds out generations of women in his family performed as mermaids, women who could hold their breathe a long time and did acts underwater.
But each of these women drowned on the same day of the year at different years in time.
Every time her mouth opens it's something annoying.
The Book of Speculation is told in alternating chapters of the past and the present.
The protagonist of the story, Simon, is a lonely librarian that has slowly been watching his life crumble down around him for years.
I really loved the historical aspects of this book--the chapters surrounding the carnival and it's many characters were perfect.
I personally didn't really like Simon...I cared more about the people around him, like his sister Enola or his friend Churchwarry.
This book is part historical fiction, part mystery, and part evil-magic-curses.
The Book of Speculation alternates back and forth in time from the present era in Long Island to the 1700’s travelling circus.
His mother, whom he loved dearly, was a performer in a traveling circus as a mermaid.
When Simon reads the content of the journal, he begins to investigate his ancestry which in turn leads him to shocking family secrets, and a grim discovery that his family maybe cursed, making its way through family generation to reach his sister Enola.
He must find a way to break this curse before his sister is at risk.Books, Librarians, bookstores, travelling circus, tarot cards, mermaids, gypsies, curses, floods!
Narrator: 5 starsStory itself: 5 stars----Once you've held a book and really loved it, you forever remember the feel of it, its specific weight, the way it sits in your hand.We carry our families like anchors, rooting us in storms, making sure we never drift from where and who we are.
The parties involved, were they drawn together at the right time to break the curse and let secrets unravel?So many things intertwined here and it all fits together like puzzle pieces sliding into place.
(hide spoiler)](view spoiler)[ The way the curse was broke was fitting, and Simon's theory of the cards makes sense, each person leaving something of themselves behind, their energy bleeding through to the next.
