“I have a meanness inside me, real as an organ. Slit me at my belly and it might slide out, meaty and dark, drop on the floor so you could stomp on it.” I highly recommend reading this whilst sitting in the sun with plenty of happy people around you (as I did) - that way you can avoid contracting something evil and nasty from its pages, and also avoid losing any hope you had for humanity. Okay, sorry, I make it sound so negative when actually this book is pretty fantastic if you can stomach the
Flynn certainly has a talent for dragging you into her stories and having them take you over until you find out just what the hell is going on.As much as I enjoyed its dark predecessor - Sharp Objects - I think Dark Places was, for me, a more complex and well-developed mystery.
For an author to manage to pull out something both surprising and convincingly real at the end of all this, they have to have a talent for it.Dark Places alternates between the present day and 1985 when Ben Day allegedly massacred three members of his family, his sister - Libby - being the only one to escape and testify as a witness, sending Ben to a life in prison.
I loved the writing style and the characterization so much--Gillian Flynn is a fantastic author! And I was so hooked by the mystery right away, I just flew through this book. Toward the end I did feel like we lost a little steam, but all the twists and revelations still kept things interesting, and overall I thoroughly enjoyed this! Definitely looking forward to seeing the movie, and probably picking up Gone Girl very soon here!
especially because she isn't one of those writers coasting on shock value and "can you belieeeeeve a delicate flower of a woman is writing this??" but she can really tell a story and i, for one, was completely surprised and pleased by the ending of this one.libby's mother and two older sisters were murdered when she was seven years old, apparently in some sort of satanic bloodbath masterminded by her older brother ben.
*4.5 Stars*Gillian Flynn scares me.But it’s a good scare! A keep-you-up-all-night-anxiously-reading-because-closing-the-book-is-not-an-option kinda scare. If you thought Gone Girl was twisted, make room for  Dark Places  because this suspenseful thriller takes “freaky” to a whole *nuther* level.I went in thinking I was fully prepared.I wasn’t. This book is so astoundingly  demented, it truly makes me wonder exactly how Miss Flynn thinks up such bold scenarios. The plot is so “out-there”, yet way
A keep-you-up-all-night-anxiously-reading-because-closing-the-book-is-not-an-option kinda scare.
This book is so astoundingly  demented, it truly makes me wonder exactly how Miss Flynn thinks up such bold scenarios.
Largely due to Libby’s testimony, her wallflower brother becomes tried and convicted for these satanic murders.Now Libby is a grown woman who is beginning to question the details of that fateful night long ago.
▪  Genre/Category: Mystery/Thriller▪  Graphic Nature: Racy and bold▪ Romance: Twisted▪  Characters: Unlovable but unforgettable▪  Plot: A twisty and suspenseful murder mystery▪ Writing: Flawless, poetic, bold, and edgy▪ POV: Switches between 3rd and 1st person: heroine▪  Cliffhanger: None/Standalone
Her mother and two sisters were brutally killed one winter night and, mostly thanks to Libby's testimony, the murders were attributed to Libby's older brother Ben, an alleged active Satan worshiper.
She settles on helping the Kill Club (a group of obsessed women who believe in Ben's innocence) to re-investigate the murders, for money of course.
As Libby starts talking to various people involved in the original investigation at the Kill Club's request, her strong belief in Ben's guilt starts wavering...I am fairly certain now that Gillian Flynn's "schtick" is writing about VERY BAD women.
Just like Sharp Objects, this book is absolutely not for everybody.
{BR with Scarlet} "The truly frightening flaw in humanity is our capacity for cruelty - we all have it."  I have no emotions left. This is a book that will stay with me forever. It left me speechless in different ways, with pretty intense emotions from anger and sadness coupled with hopelessness. This is not just a thriller/mystery/suspense novel but an absolute psychological roller coaster. I found myself almost too scared to keep reading, but so riveted I just HAD to find out what would happen
{BR with Scarlet} "The truly frightening flaw in humanity is our capacity for cruelty - we all have it." 
It left me speechless in different ways, with pretty intense emotions from anger and sadness coupled with hopelessness.
The book is outstanding, in the way it is written, and the issues it covers.
Libby is definitely the biggest victim in the book, but she also makes mistakes, and says some pretty harsh things.
There are all sorts of crazy characters in this novel- some of them crazier than others.
Strangely enough (once you know the story outline) Dark Places actually has a more conventional plot than Sharp Objects, and having just discussed Jodi Picoult at some length with Marie, I was totally in a place to read a book with alternating points of view which would normally exasperate me, I think.
I'm not even sure which of Flynn's two books I like better.
I am interested in reading her next book.
Normally I wouldn't give a genre book like this a 5-star review, because I'm picky and controlling about handing out major praise.
There are no loose ends, and when they tie up, they tie up so naturally, unfolding at such a realistic pace, that you feel like this could really have happened.
But even outside the mystery/crime genre, this book is a better, more skillful, funnier, more emotional and more fascinating read than most of the literary fiction I've read lately.
I can't wait to read "Sharp Objects," though I'm dreading it at the same time, because I really can't afford to let another book usurp all my time for three straight days.
I have now officially read all of Gillian Flynn's books, and I really enjoyed this one!The story and the characters were so twisted, and the last hour or so of the audiobook was insaaaane.
I know that the folks who run the various entertainment industries like to talk about getting us off our tractors long enough to sample their wares, but it seems like the only attempts to include us in the stories either mock us as morons or sentimentalize small town life to vomit inducing degrees.Gillian Flynn is originally from Kansas City, and her first book was very well received so I was excited to hear that Dark Places was set in both rural Kansas and K.C. Of course, it involved the slaughter of a family on the prairie, going back to the In Cold Blood thing, but I’ll take what I can get.
Gripping and entertained!  DAYS GO BY  You gotta believe in something, right? Everyone has their thing. This is my second novel by Gillian Flynn, and now I am realizing that I have been reading them backwards, I mean in the opposite publishing order, but this has been due mainly the order of film adaptations. However, I won’t wait until having any film adaptation of Sharp Objects, to read that one. I do hope to read it in the following months.My reading experience with Gone Girl wasn’t any good
And odd enough I enjoyed A LOT the film adaptation of that one, while I watched after reading the book and taking in account that it’s basically the same story, but I enjoyed it better in the movie format.I wasn’t sure how much I’d enjoy this book, Dark Places, but happily I can say that the reading experience with this novel was truly wonderful.
Libby’s family had just the opposite a nice day, like 25 years ago......her mother and her two other sisters were murdered and Ben, his brother was charged with the killings, getting a conviction where Libby’s testimony was a key factor for it.Now, Libby is an adult woman, and very soon she will be totally penniless.
When person or persons unknown murdered her entire family, seven year old Libby Day managed to escape and fingered her brother Ben as the killer.
Gillian Flynn, where have you been all my life?Dark Places is a mystery but it's one of those mysteries that also happens to be brutal and very well written, like Winter's Bone or something along those lines.
Not exactly your feel-good read.I love that instead of some notion of heroism, Libby gets involved in her family's murder because she's nearly run out of money and has no idea how to function as a normal adult.
Lesson learned # 1: Gillian Flynn is excellent at creating unpleasant characters and disturbing situations. “I was not a lovable child, and I'd grown into a deeply unlovable adult. Draw a picture of my soul, and it'd be a scribble with fangs.” Lesson learned # 2: Reading her books in a dark apartment at 3 am is a big making-skin-crawl mistake. Dark Places is a book capable of leaving a nasty aftertaste and vague uncomfortable feeling for days after finishing it. I strongly suspect it is its inte
Except that now Libby - adult and aimlessly floating through life in a quite unpleasantly pathetic fashion - has reasons to doubt her brother's guilt, and, shaken up from her stupor by a plot contrivance, is on a search to unearth old well-hidden ghosts and uncover what actually happened on a cold January day 25 years ago in a middle-of-nowhere town, Missouri.Yes, the murders themselves, regardless of how gruesome they may be, are not the disturbing part, not at all.
This is by far my favorite book ever!
Read this book!!!!!!
After reading Gillian Flynn's Gone Girl I knew I had to read her other novels.
Out of her three novels, Dark Places is by far my favorite.
My mother read it at the same time as I did and she kept calling me throughout the book and telling me about it.
I love books like this one, where the main character has a skewed idea of what really happened and then goes on a journey to learn the real fate of that horrible night...
and it was indeed a horrible night.
4.5 stars . *breathes deeply* What a ride! Finally a mystery that keeps its appeal intact after the first 50% and does not make me roll my eyes all duh! like in the end. Let's see why, shall we?► Highly recommended if you can stomach the depression. *whispers* In the end, I even rooted for Libby. Don't ask me why. I just did. Nobody's perfect, okay? I said that the characters made me sick, but oh, the sadness. The despair. The misunderstandings. The loneliness. My heart aches from lack of hope.

This is me being all contradictory : Once a year, Romance week is coming and finds me waving from a distance.
Try being born on February 14th and getting an indecent amount of heart shaped cards, gifts, stuff over the years.
I resist as I can, okay?
Strike one.Nb. I made my dark week banner with the free label found here from http://lilac-n-lavender.blogspot.fr/2...

Along the way, she starts to have doubts herself and the real story unfolds between her present-day sleuthing and flashbacks to her mother's and brother's point-of-view from the day of the killings.As I said, no one is likable.
Gillian Flynn is disturbingly good at creating characters who are beyond messed up and irritating, to the point where you start to wonder what sort of inner darkness she harbors (on the contrary, her Author's Notes always make her sound very well adjusted.
Nothing about the dark story that's filled with hopelessness and screw-ups made me feel good about reading it.
Not a feel-good story of the year.
Dark Places was my first Gillian Flynn book (though I have seen the Gone Girl movie) but I fully plan on picking up her other books now.It’s the kind of novel that makes you question what on earth we humans can come up with.
At first, she dismisses these theories as fanatical talk, but as more and more information is presented to her, Libby realizes that maybe things aren’t simple as she thought them to be.Dark Places is not a book I would necessarily call “enjoyable”.
Dark Places is a masterpiece, composed of troubled characters,disturbing deeds and buried secrets.Fo
She meets with them, hating the experience but is tempted to help one of the members who is intent on delving deeper into the history of the case – as long as he keeps the cash flowing.The narrative is told primarily first person, through the eyes of Libby, but is interspersed with flash back third party accounts which focus on Libby’s mother and on Ben. As we learn more about both characters the plot thickens.
It’s as if she’s lost faith in the value of the tale as she was telling it and felt she needed a big finish.
Being a Cubs fan (see: suffering), I didn't get many chances to watch the Angels since they play late at night, and for me that's prime writing time.
But my son and I got the opportunity to catch an Angels-Cubs game on July 10th, 2013, and I finally got the opportunity to watch Mike Trout play in person at Wrigley Field.
Yet as impressive as Trout's stats were, what impressed me most that night was the way he went about his business.
Gillian Flynn reminds me of Mike Trout.
In other words, Gillian Flynn is the Mike Trout of modern fiction.
But I live where this book takes place and I’m familiar with the landmarks and the vibe of certain locales that made the action so tangible to me and soon it will hit the big screen filled with A-list actors in the starring roles causing people to poke around and find my ugly blank review space.It’s also come to the attention of me (and many others) that there is an EXCESSIVE amount of spamming bumping one’s own reviews in order to remain at the top of the “most popular” chart here on Goodreads.
"I was not a lovable child, and I'd grown into a deeply unlovable adult. Draw a picture of my soul and it'd be a scribble with fangs." Flynn has a gift for creating absolutely despicable characters that you can't help but sympathize with. Everyone in this book is horrible, from the narrator's ten-year-old sister, who is a gossip-monger and blackmails people for their silence, to the deadbeat dad who physically threatens his wife for money. Even the main character, Libby, isn't spared. She's the
Even the main character, Libby, isn't spared.
She's the sole survivor of a massacre that killed her entire family when she was seven.
The time stamp on my family's massacre, and here I was looking forward to it.
Libby begins to suspect that her brother Ben may not have been the one to murder her family all those years ago and she embarks on a quest to find out the real culprit.
And like I said, all the characters are so horrible, it could be any one of them.
I feel defensive about her books, I think sometimes she gets a bad rap because her novels are so dark.
Every book I read in this genre, I cannot help but compare the writing to Flynn's.
She can craft a character out of thin air that is as real to a reader as the book they are holding.
My favorite kind of book!Libby Day, our flawed protagonist, is one carefully constructed character.
This is my least favorite of Flynn's books, mainly because the plot is too crazy and contrived even for me.
Other Reviewers mentioned they didn't like Libby!
Flynn, I bow down to you for not making this character "rise above" her past and for writing a character so perfectly, that my heart literally felt like it was broken while I read the book.
That is why I loved Libby, she is who she is, and she wasn't created to make book ratings or financial gains for the author.
I forgot to mention the other characters in the book- you will love them even if you hate them.
The author is brilliant in her character development.
Meh.Well, unfortunately this wasn't the page turner Gone Girl was for me.
The most interesting thing about this book in my opinion was Libby's character.
I do like that Gillian Flynn creates these screwed up characters and I found Libby to be somewhat entertaining.
Ms. Flynn isn't known for writing likable characters to be inspired by, but Libby was interesting.
I felt like a lot of this book was filler, so that the mystery could be drug out until the end.
This is why for some of this book I was bored out of my mind.
I randomly decided to listen to this because I wanted to watch the movie. It turned out to be a fascinating, yet disturbing mystery read. I couldn't stop listening, and came to care for these messed up characters. If you enjoy mysteries and thrillers, this is a must read. However, be warned, the content is pretty graphic.
Whilst this is nothing more than pure conjecture, it wouldn’t surprise me to learn she was a serial killer in a former life, or that she stabs bunnies and kittens and hamsters and toy poodles during her spare time (for research purposes).
If you need a recommendation, I’ll put you in touch with Kate Upton.Seriously, though, DARK PLACES dropped me in a dank forest in the middle of the night, shaved my head, punched me in the gut, stabbed me in the throat, and then kicked me in the crotch, all within the first 250 pages or so.
“The truly frightening flaw in humanity is our capacity for cruelty - we all have it.”  by the end of this book i cried like a baby while reading the letter from their mother broke my heart the movie is even better jesus !
Charlize theron did an amazing job this one is definitely on my re-reading shelf

Libby Day's entire family was slaughtered, and she fingered her brother as the murderer.
as much 'living' you can do when your father is a drugged up alcoholic, your brother a murderer and the people you love buried six feet under.It's called "Dark Places" and lives up to its name.
Nothing about it is good: Libby's afflictions are disturbing, Ben's (her brother) side of the story is even MORE disturbing.
"Well, this is like that, but it's, well, we call it a Kill Club."I took a slug of beer, sweat beads popping on my nose."It's not as weird as it sounds.""It sounds pretty fucking weird."
