(Mary Ann Caws' book might be a better introduction.) However, if the size is uninviting for an unfamiliar reader, it is the opposite for a reader who is already interested in Breton's work.The poems and sequences are here in their entirity, a rarity in the world of published translations, where shortened sequences and fragments of books are usually preferred.The trajectory of Breton's writing and the range of Breton's writing might be discussed in a full review of this book, but in these few short notes, I must be selective.What made me sit down and write about this book was my experience rereading the sequence  The Air of the Water.
These translations of Breton's surrealist poems and prose poems are fanciful emersions in the possibility of image and language. There's nothing inaccesible among these poems, just lots of fanciful surprises. Not all the translations are as strong as others, and sometimes reading one poem after another allows the poems to blur together due to their similar strategies and tones, but overall this is a delightful introduction to an early 20th century innovator.
My favorite poem, "Free Union," is in this collection. Breton's poems are sharp as glass. They penetrate deep into a reality that is so beautiful they take one's breath away. Surrender....
Great book! Great translations by Zavatsky! I have this in the Sun & Moon edition, but I assume it is much the same. Stunning.
"Au Chien qui fumeOÃ¹ venaient d'entrer le pour et le contre"
Three and a half stars. I have not read anything this magical and visual in a long time.
When I return to this book I always think of Niko and the table we played tug-of-war with. Finally we just sat down together and he told me about Breton.
What can one possibly say about Earthlight? I'd say "read it." Zavatsky is one of Breton's best translators as well.
awful translation of a beautiful book.
