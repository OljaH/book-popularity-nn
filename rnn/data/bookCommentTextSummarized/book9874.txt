What a bizarre book! I suppose every author, in the midst of a lengthy and popular series, faces the temptation at some point to break out of the well-worn groove and try something really different. This book is Walter Farley succumbing to that temptation, and the results is a quirky delight. Not perfect, but I really enjoyed the ride.
This was a pivotal book in my life. It guided my reading concentration straight from horse books to science fiction, by the clever combination of genres.
Or maybe he was having a bit of fun with a book which no editor would have taken from a first-time author.Steve Duncan has discovered an island with horses left by the Conquistadores in The Island Stallion, one of Farley's best works.
Steve just wants to have his stallion admired and to prove that Flame is a champion.
He doesn't really realise that it would be a bad idea to take Flame out of his environment when the island interior is all he has ever known.The two little men, who change into birds when nobody is looking to travel further, offer to solve Steve's problems since he has been so helpful.
I've always loved The Island Stallion, but must not have ever read all of the others with Flame and Steve in them.
The first thing I noticed when I read this was how simplistic the writing style was.
This didn't deter me from reading it because I know that it was written in the 50s and is classified as a book for younger readers.What really surprised me was the (view spoiler)[aliens.
(hide spoiler)] I didn't expect that in the story.
Still, it added an interesting twist to the story.
I did get a little bit annoyed with Steve's clinginess to his horse - Flame.
With The Island Stallion Races, Walter Farley takes a detour into sci-fi. This is much different than most of the rest of the books in the series, although the racing theme is ever-present. Steve and Flame are still the highlight of the book, however other characters are introduced, temporary though they might be. Overall it's an interesting take on Steve and Flame's relationship - young boy and wild horse with an understanding between them - as well as a way for Steve to realize his dream of racing Flame.
When I was eight and nine years old, I read everything I could get my hands on by Walter Farley. I remember, from a distance of more than fifty years, being thrilled when beings from another world showed up in this one!
I thought I had read all the available Black and Island Stallion books that were out when I was reading horse books.
I really don't think I read this one for some reason, but I might've.
Having said that, the next time I read it, I was already well into my science fiction journey.
I was pleased, to a point, with the aliens taking Flame to race in Cuba (this was pre-Castro just like Guys and Dolls.)I wish I could say I like the racing stuff, but on the second read the UFO and the aliens were my focus, and the horse, always the horse.
"Weâ€™re not the same without animals."What... did I just read?I adore horse books. I adore Walter Farley's books. I'm not quite sure what this Island Stallion book was. I mean, there were horses, yes, but.... it's a science fiction horse novel? I don't know. It's very strange. That aspect takes me out of what I love about Farley's books: they're realistic. This as aspects of realism, interspersed with aliens. I just don't know how to shelve this in my head.
Although I enjoy the story of Steve and Flame this book was too science fictional for it to be believable. One of the best aspects of the Black Stallion series is the almost factual nature of the stories. The question of the dream vs reality makes this book a little hard to lump in with one of my favorite set of books.
I always figured that Walter Farley was a fairly conservative person... but what the heck was he partaking in when he wrote this one?!
More of a sci-fi bent than most horse books!
Here's the premise:Two aliens from another planet decide to go into Thoroughbred horse racing.
They select for their one-horse stable Flame, the Island Stallion.
But in order to race Flame, they need the cooperation of the only boy who can ride him, Our Hero Steve.
Think Walter Farley was getting sick of writing about horses?On the plus side, it's about the only science fiction book with horse racing.
The only other book I can think of with this combination is Piers Anthony's Split Infinity.
The Anthony book is far more believable -- in its own way.
The Black Stallion's Sulky Colt The Island Stallion Races The Black Stallion's Courage The Black Stallion Mystery The Horse-Tamer (all by Walter Farley) I stepped away from my re-read of this series as I just knew the two books listed first were coming up.
These two (Sulky Colt and Island Stallion Races) were even worse than I remembered.
I wonder if The Island Stallion Races is what turned me off of sci-fi.
The Horse-Tamer isn't really part of the series but is about the Black's trainer Henry Dailey as a boy.
The great thing about Walter Farley was his ability to get away with writing things that otherwise wouldn't necessarily be present in an average everyday horse book. In this book, it was the presence of aliens manipulating the situation so that Flame, the island stallion, would face the Black. Pretty fascinating. The story, as always, contained the deep and epic love of boys for their horses in a way that no other author has really captured since.Enjoyable, entertaining--- Walter Farley alone is enough reason to read it.
I have no memory of this aside from the drawings. Walt, Walt, Walt, what were you thinking? Aliens? Aliens with a passion for horse racing? Aliens with a passion for horse racing so strong they are willing to transport a boy and his wild stallion from the middle of the Caribbean to Havana so they can race in the Internacional? Ludicrous, every word. The race scenes are, of course, stellar. The rest is laughable.
This book really struck a chord with me as a kid. I read this series out of order, and I think I read this one near the end. Suiting, as it has such a different tone than the others. 11 year old me thought the aliens were the coolest thing ever, and I still have dreams relating to the inside of that spaceship. Of course, this is a Walter Farley book, and there are more than enough horsey things to keep anyone who's read this far into the series interested.
(view spoiler)[Aliens. Freaking aliens. Aliens that love horse-racing, no less. (hide spoiler)]This is where Farley well and truly jumped off the cliffs of sanity. Prepare to be weirded out!If you're not wholeheartedly devoted to reading each and every book in the series, this would be the one to skip.
I enjoyed the characters, and their world and hope I get the chance to read the story again and/or to read more within the series.My Rating System:* couldn't finish, ** wouldn't recommend, *** would recommend, **** would read again, ***** have read again.
I kept waiting for the punchline because no way would Walter Farley introduce an element of science fiction into a series about horses and the race culture. And yet he did. And I thought it was pretty well-handled, considering the jump in genre.
While not as bad as "The Black Stallion Legend", this is clearly the point where either Walter Farley went completely off the rails, or just said "Aw, screw it, I'm getting paid anyway." Horserace-loving aliens. That's really all you need to know.
It was definately a good read, but I find it very odd that walter farley would write about people from another world? But the message near the end of the book is one that I will most definately teach to my son.
A bit far-fetched, but it's a good read.
aka Black Stallion and the Stranger
As a kid I read every Walter Farley book published that I could get my hands on - Island Stallion was more fun if you just loved horses. Black Stallion books got too much into horse racing.
The first book was the story of a boy and a horse, but the series grows with books on similar themes of overcoming adversity and animal/human bonding. Loved them as a kid.
my daughter's book.
There was not a Black Stallion book that I could ever put down. The stories are the best.
Horse lover book!
Found my diary from 1962 with a list of books read complete with ratings. Alas, no comments. I remember I devoured all the Farley books but preferred the Island Stallion to the Black.
One of my Fav. in the series
