Ever since I read "Red Harvest," I have been a major fan of both Dashiell Hammett and his gumshoe the Continental Op. I love the Op's confidence and sense of sarcasm; the way he gives people the kind of attitude they want while steering them in the direction that he needs them to go in; his straightforward approach to a fistfight or a shoot-out.
He is an elusive kind of hero, never named and only rarely subject to introspection that touches upon his past; and yet he is a very real kind of hero, driven by a personal ethos that separates him from the drama and squabble of urban life and crime.As Hammett's long-time companion Lillian Hellman writes, some of the stories in this collection are great, some not as much.
I can offer a few comments on several of the stories: “The Gutting of Couffignal”: Couffignal is an island in San Pablo Bay, and was populated by a select few very wealthy and influential people.
“The Big Knockover”: A huge gang of criminals gather in San Francisco and pull off the robbery of the two biggest banks in the city.
“$106,000 Blood Money”: this was a follow-up story to “The Big Knockover.” Lots of people are after the reward money for the head planner of the gambit.This is a good selection of Hammett’s work.
I finished every short story by Dashiell Hammett contained in this collection as well as Nightmare Town back in October 2014.I loved all of 'em. I read everything that featured my favorite Hammett character the Continental Op and a couple of other non-Ops tales.If you're up for reading a bit of Hammett you might want to start with these collections.
The narrator protects "wedding presents whose value would add up to something between fifty and a hundred thousand dollars." Thus, we readers know there is to be robbery, a standard crime for the genre.PACE=3: As solid as the rock upon which the island stands against the storms of the ocean.PLOT=4: Early on, Hammett telegraphs clearly to readers there is to be a robbery by gunshots and explosions in the downtown portion of the island.
Couffignal may be loaded with secrets.ChARACTERS=4:This is a plot-driven story: you'll remember nary a single name once you've turned the final page.
If you're read Hammett, you know his plots can be difficult.
The first few stories in this collection were very pulp-1920s mystery, featuring (among other things) a sex cult and an eastern European coup.
Then, the story "Tulip," an unfinished work, really changed my mind about these stories.
I really saw Hammett in the narrator, and loved the insight that give me to the rest of his work.
The story also wasn't a mystery- yet Hammett only finished the first chapter and last sentence, so you are left wondering what it was going to be about.
This is not your usual collection of short stories.
(Ok, in a the modern era where everyone seems to have posthumously published works, maybe it's not so unusual.) In the covers of this book we have:a) Lillian Helman's words about the man,b) Several gritty, pulp-style dark slices of life with our friend The Continental Op, andc) Snatches of incomplete tales, including the unfinished novel, "Tulip".Need I say any more?Even if you only care for the classic "film noir", bleak American style of hard-boiled detection the Op's appearances in this book will keep you satisfied.
Well, I read one story at a time in between many, many other books over several months, so it's hard to write a solid, accurate review.
Looking over the table of contents, I don't remember having a negative reaction to any of the stories except for Tulip, which was a hard one to figure.
It seems out of place in this collection.
Since it's so long, I'm removing one star for it.
I remember enjoying all the others, and it's fun that the Continental Op goes to so many different places and takes care of so many different problems.
Not a collection of his best The Contintenal OP stories but they still range from very good to great stories in this collection.The Gutting of Couffignal,The Big Knockover,CorkscrewThe Yellow Dead Women was the best stories in the collection.The OP style,lines,his cold-blooded professionalism, drive is a blessing,a save from romantic PI heroes that think they are good guys in a play. The OP will let criminals die if it takes to do the job. He is so refreshingly ruthless,real.
El gran golpe -o por lo menos esta edición- es una compilación de relatos que tienen como personaje central al Agente de la Continental, que será uno de los personajes emblemáticos de su obra.
Aunque no tan sorprendente como la imagen de una calle llena de policías haciéndose los despistados mientras siguen al correo que ha de entregar el dinero del rescate.Y casi al final, encontramos "El gran golpe", relato en el que una multitud de ladrones coordinados dan el mayor asalto en la historia de Estados Unidos, pero al que siguen la caza y exterminio de cada uno de los participantes, y cuyo final no deja de ser inesperado.La compilación termina con "Tulip", una ficción inconclusa que se aleja del estilo usual de Hammett -no es un policial-, pero que es el germen de la ruptura de una tradición y el surgimiento de otra, en el que se intenta adentrarse en la psiquis de los personajes mediante diálogos que parecen flotar en el vacío.
The situation with this collection appears to be that this was a kind of odds-and-ends group of short fiction that was knocking around in Hammett's possession at the time of his death.
A good society scandal story, with cult murder and runaway heiresses, is called 'The Scorched Face' : ...A night wind from the Pacific was creaking a grocer's sign down below, swaying the arc-light above.
to be avoided.) For any Hammett fan or completist, though, it's very interesting to see the kind of Alternate Takes the noir master was playing around with, and-- hard to fault him for the misfires, given that he wasn't around to do the deciding on what went into this collection.
I love Dashiell Hammett, and this is a terrific collection of some of his short stories.
They mostly star his nameless protagonist, the Continental Op, a determined and insightful detective, and they are generally based in or around San Francisco.
Almost every one is a stellar example of Hammett's hard-boiled prose and cynical sense of humor.
I found these stories to be weaker than most of the others, since the Op is such an urban character who gets by on his underworld connections and intimacy with the geographical and social/moral landscapes of San Francisco.
This collection is different from the stories in Nightmare Town.
Right off you can feel this book is more plot driven than character driven.
Luckily, there are enough all-around stories to make this a decent book.All the elements that make Hammett a master of the hardboiled detective school are present: gangsters, girls, guns, and tons of cigarette smoke.
Which makes me wonder why the hell they decided to include Tulip, a watered down Steinbeck themed chapter from an unfinished novel.Corkscrew is the odd ball of the collection.
It makes me wish Hammett would have tried his hand at a western novel.Read Nightmare Town first, which is much better collection.
this is sort of a grab bag of mostly misses from the usually stellar hammett.
the continental op takes on all sorts of new and unlikely foes, including fallen russian nobles, a balkan revolution, chinese smugglers portrayed in an unfortunately racist light, and a herd of villains with goofy names like the dis-and-dat kid.
the latter is actually an ok story close enough to the sweet spot of hammet's talent, and in fact the closing story (its sequel) is the best of the collection and quite enjoyable.there's also a long and incomplete story that's probably a little autobiographical and certainly isn't about the continental op, though it's maybe about why the op and not normal life.
even though it's normal life so kind of meta.
Contains a selection of little-known but very impactful stories. This collection is a lot of fun to read. More evidence on hand that the entire action-thriller genre stems from Hammett and no one else. You can see all the elements of 'Die Hard' right here in the titular story. A determined gang completely invades a seaside resort town and Hammet's Op has to foil their nefarious scheme working secretly from the inside. Riveting and sensational! This is where it all leads back to!
Excellent intro by long time partner, Lillian Hellman.
Confusing at times.
Stories of the Continental Op (same detective in each story, but no name given).
Story 2: Fly Paper -- Classic SF detective story.
Story 3: The Scorched Face -- Another great SF detective story.
Story 4: The King Business -- unusual setting in Eastern Europe.
Story 7: Corkscrew -- Radically different setting (Southwest cowboy town).
Unsure if it was a Continental Op/detective story at all.
Story 9: The Big Knockover -- the Main Event.
SF story.
Story 10: $106,000 Blood Money -- Sequel to the The Big K.
Esta foi minha primeira experiência lendo histórias detetivescas e adorei.
Os diálogos provocativos, apesar de usarem bastantes clichês (apesar de que provavelmente são de obras como esta que os clichês do gênero saíram) são cativantes e convidam o leitor para entrar no jogo de palavras entre os personagens.Apenas o conto "Tulip" destoa do restante das histórias.
Até tem um bom desenvolvimento, mas fiquei esperando ele chegar em algum lugar para que entrasse em harmonia com o que eu já tinha visto no livro, mas ele termina repentinamente deixando uma sensação de "ué?" para trás.Foi um ótimo pontapé inicial para o gênero e já pretendo seguir lendo outros livros com a mesma pegada!

This took me longer to read than it took Hammett to write, I'm pretty sure.
Hey, I've had a lot going on.
Besides: I was savoring each story.
This is a nice (second) collection of Hammett's short fiction featuring his nameless protagonist, The Continental Op, a hardboiled operative from the Continental Detective Agency, who I picture being played by a Spencer Tracy or a Joel McCrea, if we lived in that alternate universe.
There's also a novella where Hammett tries for a Hemingway-esque feel.
Go ahead and read it for a nice visit to a time before you walked the Earth.
Hammett's unnamed agent of the Continental Detective Agency - the Continental Op - may be the prototype for serious, literary American hard-boiled detectives, but he was also the protagonist of some nutty 1920s pulp adventure stories, gathered here.
The Op gets involved in a European royal revolution!
The Op becomes the law in a crooked Western town and rides the range!
And in most every story, he goes hand-to-hand against an army of crooks and beats up more bad guys than Bruce Lee. These aren't his deepest works, but Hammett's Black Mask stories are crisp, colorful, and a ton of fun.
I liked 4 out of the 5 stories herein, therefore, 4 stars!
I've always liked the Continental Op a lot, and the four tales of his in this book do not disappoint!
I like that we don't get his name, nor his boss', the "Old Man", he isn't in the best shape, and he isn't afraid to shoot!
The title story was fun, with lots of old timey crook nicknames and double crosses!
The story I didn't like, "Tulip", was not a Continental Op story, and honestly, I'm not sure what it really was.
Sort of a meandering tale, and one I wasn't into.
Some of these were great. Not all, mind you. Hammett's detectives don't carry too well to a setting outside of the American big city. The Big Knockover itself was probably the best of all. As a Greek myself, nice to see that some of the prime villains are Greeks too. It was getting tiring coming across another Irishman every time. Thus, Papadopoulos was absolutely marvellous and gave me a warm sense of patriotic pride
10 stories, all except the unfinished "Tulip" tales of hard bitten California vice, crime, & complications by the godfather of noir.Each story the longest no more than 60 pages evokes a time & place that thematically is timeless.Hamett's tight prose & terse characters make even the least of the stories enjoyable.
Some of the stories are in his classic style: set in SF with a rich mans daughter getting in over her head, but a couple break the mold. Some of these work, some don't. There is one that is autobiographical that I enjoyed although it was unfinished.
Along with The Dain Curse, easily Hammett's most mediocre work. As a devoted fan who's read The Maltese Falcon and Red Harvest numerous times, I enjoyed this collection but non-die hards will probably be unimpressed by much of what's here.
This was ten stories, the last two being the best. One story called Tulip... Had no idea what that was about. This was my first reading of the author
I think that Hammett must have had fun writing the title story, The Big Knockover, because it was so big that he got to make up literally dozens of colorful names for the crooks!The unfinished novel, Tulip, was interesting, and I feel a bit ambivalent about it.
Hammett also injects other stories into the narrative: the narrator relates, in his own words, a story that Tulip tells him about something that happened to him (or maybe didn't), later he reads aloud an old newspaper article that he wrote years earlier, that Tulip has saved - a very esoteric review of a book about the Rosicrucians by the mystic Waite (the man behind the Rider-Waite Tarot, I believe), and later still, the narrator relates a long account of what happened to him in several hospitals following the first World War, when he had TB.
Not all the stories here are brilliant, some are a bit bizarre and silly (like the detective who goes to a made up Eastern Europe country to start a revolution or the one where he becomes a sheriff's deputy in a cowboy town) but they are all enjoyable.
The short stories also included Tulip, which was supposed to be a new novel he was working on before he died but was left unfinished.
While the short stories don't have as much character development and diversity as the novels they are definitely still worth reading.
The collection starts with an improbable story about small island taken over by an army of thugs intent on robbing a jewelry store and bank.
Then there’s an odder story about the Continental Op going to Europe to help a young millionaire become king, and then help him escape.
It’s an autobiographical story about a guy trying to convince a writer to write about his life.
It’s a very interesting way for Hammett to write about himself and this character at the same time.
While the style is clearly Hammett, the story is anything like his.
Despite having been written nearly a century ago in a genre known for its cliches, these stories are largely free of sexism, racism and homophobia.
Some of the pieces here are prototypes for later, more important works Hammett would write, such as The Maltese Falcon, so it's interesting to see the germ of these ideas in progress.
Writing action and stories laced with dirty dealings was Hammett's forte, and these are some of his best.
The only story that fails, for me, is the lugubrious and byzantine "The Scorched Face," which deals as poorly with drug addiction as Hammett's one dud of a novel, The Dain Curse.
Questi dieci racconti, dei quali uno non giallo, ne sono un buon campione degli inizi, pubblicati in "blackmask" una rivista pulp.
E' per� roba assai datata in genere e, essendo molto caratterizzata, a rischio per il lettore non avvertito.
Contiene pure un racconto "Corkscrew" che � puro Tex. Un western fenomenale di quando gli uomini erano uomini e i cavalli, ovviamente, cavalli.
E poi nel racconto non giallo, (Tulip) chiaro autobiografismo dell'autore, c'� una frase come questa.
