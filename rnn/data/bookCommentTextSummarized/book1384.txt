But I had read enough about the content elsewhere to be able to follow the general outlines of the argument, and I will do my best to explain what I got out of it.Einstein's main goal is to show you how he arrived at the Theory of General Relativity.
In Newtonian physics, you have to use an "inertial" frame of reference, motionless or moving uniformly with respect to the fixed stars; then you can explain things like Foucault's pendulum.
But Einstein wants it also to be possible to adopt the Ptolemaic frame of reference, where the Earth stands still and the rest of the universe rotates around it.

Ancak sunumu, bilimle ilgisi olmayan okuyucular için matematiksel bir derinlik içermektedir ve bu da anlatımdaki akışın yavaşlamasına yol açabilir.
Matematikle ya da bilimle ilgisi olanlar için ise bu dersler son derece aydınlatıcı olacaktır.
Göreliliğin Anlamı, konu hakkında bugün artık iyi bilinen yaklaşımların çoğuna öncülük yapmaya ek olarak, sonradan başka araştırmacılar tarafından yeniden keşfedilen birçok düşünceyi de içermektedir."Einstein'ın görelilik kuramları büyük bir kuramsal sentez örneğidir.
Einstein fizikte birleşik kuramlar için meşaleyi yakmıştır.
Bizler bu meşaleyi yanık tutmaya devam ediyoruz."-Brian Greene, Evrenin Zarafetinin yazarı-"Göreliliğin Anlamı gelişme aşamasındaki bir devrimi belgelemekte ve dikkatli okuyucuya bu alanda başka fizik kitaplarında bulunandan daha derin gerçekler sunmaktadır."- Physics Today-
No.Well, I did understand a good deal, compared to the knowledge I already had about the complex theories and lectures discussed in the book.
However, even though this book did benefit me, I believe that it is more beneficial to those who are more knowledgeable about mathematics and physics than I am, as they would be able to get the most out of it.
But even if you are not that much of a math person or a physics prodigy, you should read it.
Why you should read it: Einstein said his goal with the book was to give an insight into the theory of relativity to interested non-experts.
I'm not a fan of Mathematics. So this book was both interesting and boring for me to read. I kinda had a hard time getting through with it.
Needs a great deal of background in vector calculus, electromagnetism and differential equations.
Whammo!
The man who couldn't get a teaching job, whom everyone who knew thought a hopeless nutcase, and a virtual nobody at the time in the world of scientific research, this man wrote a paper in the dim light of early 20th century, The Special Theory of Relativity, and changed our conception of the physical universe and our physical world forever.
No one knows what's next, but the works of his contained in this book were seminal and its seeds continue to sprout and grow every day, for good and ill.
Although I read this book fairly long ago, I do remember that it was a very advanced book.
In the beginning, he focuses on space-time.
Complicating stuff.He then goes on to discuss the theory of special relativity.
He shows how this problem is solved by assuming that time and space are absolute.
He also discusses the Lorentz transformations and Maxwell equations.After all the little introductions are done, he just goes in-depth about relativity.
Like I said, I don't remember too much, but it's not a light read, but certainly interesting.
The way that Tensors are explained in this book is very old-fashioned, and understandably so.
However, this book affected me when I first read it many years ago.
The way it affected me was that it introduced me to Einstein's way of thinking.
As you go through the book, you learn about Einstein's thought process.
You learn how he would base his theories on logical thinking instead of common beliefs at the time.
What I learned from it was that the right way of thinking and problem-solving is using logic plus Occam's Razor i.e. simplicity.
E' chiaro che le due stelline non sono il voto alla teoria della relativit� quanto piuttosto alla mia (in)capacit� di comprendere la matematica che ne sta alla base. Sar� meglio tornare a leggere libri pi� divulgativi.
when the time is not absolute it is so difficult to imagine such univers.i believe relativity theory is the begining of a new way of undrestanding of the world by mixing of experiences and deep imagination.
"Teoria relativitatii pe intelesul tuturor" (titlul real) - close enough...Nu e chiar pe intelesul tuturor (cei ca mine, care habar n-au de fizica), dar explica destul de detaliat asa incat, daca te chinui (si citesti de mai multe ori), vei intelege.
Wow
The paperback versions of this book are great. The Sony eReader edition is missing more than 70% of the actual equations and the rest are filled with typos so don't buy this book at Sony!
undoubtedly a superior mind.
A necessary reference item in the personal library for all interested in theoretical physics.
I am not a scientist, but I was curious and this book really helped. I highly recommend it. Also ... a good idea to read this or another like it before picking up quantum theory/mechanics texts.
Some insights but you need advanced mathematics to read this one and get the most out of it. Some great commentary by Einstein as he explains the theory.
More difficult to penetrate than Relativity: The Special and the General Theory, which is written for a lay audience anyways. However, an excellent companion to that book (which I now own).
This is the first book in theoretical physics which I read (translated to Polish, with another Introduction), when I was around 15 years old.
