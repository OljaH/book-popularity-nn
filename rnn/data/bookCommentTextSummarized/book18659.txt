I had a hard time staying engaged in the story, especially since there were moments that seemed to lend themselves to a bigger emotional punch (view spoiler)[such as the revelation that her mom is a Brannick, the early interactions with Cal, seeing her father again, Archer being tortured, etc (hide spoiler)] than were portrayed.
I also got a little tired of Elodie popping up again and again (view spoiler)[and possessing Sophie's body (hide spoiler)] and the way Sophie's magic came and went at pretty convenient moments.My two biggest issues with the book, however, were: 1.
(view spoiler)[Sophie kissing Cal very soon after the book begins, before she even knows if something's happened to Archer.
I will admit to anyone who wants to hear that I have pretty much been obsessively waiting for this ending since I read Hex Hall on my birthday two years ago.
I adore Sophie, Archer, Jenna, and Cal, and I so wish that my parents were as totally cute as James and Grace are.
I thought the book was going to be about Sophie learning how to kick butt via Brannick teachings, yet that didn't happen.
I just want to say that I did enjoy this book and I think everyone who is a fan of Hex Hall will like it.
Are you trying to make me insane, Ms. Hawkins? What happens if I die before this book comes out, huh? I will have been left with the cliffhanger of Demonglass as an ending. I hope you're happy with yourself.. . .Okay, okay, I am bordering on the melodramatic, I know. I just can't believe this book's release is so far away! That ending was evil. Not demon evil, but evil enough.
Maybe it also has a lot to do with my awesome big sister being Rachel too.Now, now, let’s go to the review.As much as I would like to say this is the best book in the series, I could not do that because honestly, compared to the first two, this is not as great but...there’s a BIG BUT (no pun intended.
seriously.), I am still very happy with how everything has been concluded in this finale.What I love most in this series is how each character in the books has become really endearing.
Even this character's death- I was like NOOOOOOO!
Is someone having fun conspiring against me?2012?!Is this some kind of joke?Should I be laughing?Probably I should, but no, I will kill somebody and then I'll feel better.*Thinks about killing some certain author but what if that certain author has a fourth book? Who would write it then, right? Kills a mosquito instead*No, I don't fell better.I  WANT  Spell Bound!*Starts creating a diabolic plan to, somehow (time machine?), drop in 2012 and come back with the book*
However, I need to rate this one 3,5/5⭐ for all the reasons stated below ⬇.“I think I might have seen pride in Dad’s eyes.
(hide spoiler)]The end regarding Elodie was laughable!
I want Elodie from the first book.
(view spoiler)[I love them together so much, but they actually did not have a lot of space as a couple on the page.
(hide spoiler)]I really liked this series and even this book.
It needed a hundred more pages.
I need more on Hex Hall, the Council, the Brannicks, Mercer/Cross, James/Grace, L´occhio de Dio and even more on Casnoffs!
After that ultimate cliffhanger I was like what...what.....woah...no...that couldn't have been it....I actually kept on turning the page to see if there was a secret couple of pages that I was missing.
:((( I think all of my favorite authors are conspiring against me to have totally awful cliffhangers and not publish their books for extended periods of time.
SighhhEdit: Ohhh I do like the name of the book.
All I'm saying is Sophie had better get her powers "unlocked" so she can be all badass again :)Edit #2: soo....the cover is freaking awesome; she looks like a modern day warrior with the bloody sword!
I want this like Sophie Mercer wants Archer Cross. (In my bed with me now! Because that's where I read books)The above is my pre-reading review. Liked it! I always need more Archer though. Wonder what the spin-off series is going to be about. (view spoiler)[I kinda hope the little Brannick girls. (hide spoiler)]PSA Unrelated to the book but important. ["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>
I really, really, really liked the first two, but this one just didn't do it for me - not because Sophie didn't choose the guy I was rooting for but becasue the whole book itself was pretty blah.First of all, I LOVED Sophie in the first two books.
Sorry, no love lost there.I did like Cal, though I knew Hawkins would never write Sophie ending up with him.
As if kissing him and then kissing Archer ten minutes after wasn't bad enough, Hawkins had to find SOME way to keep him romantically in the picture.
D' Epic BattlesHarry's version...Aragorn's version...Sophie's version...There are lots of reasons why I gave it two stars or what we called OK stars rather than the Liked stars.The Hex Hall has been highlighted or well known for its being fluffy, charming and funny.
Good for her.' or more like 'that’s all will happen when you visited the underworld?' Yeah in other word: why the heck its way too easy with her?As for the characters they are still likeable, especially Cal and Jenna.
Both of them I think did grow from the first to this last book though I didn’t like what happened to one of them.
"HOLY HELL WEASEL" !
Want, want, want so much!___"Holy hell weasel" perfection.
Spell Bound is faultless and a brilliant ending to the series.
Then, suddenly, Sophie finds herself back at Hex Hall and she'll need the help of Jenna, Cal, and Archer to defeat the evil demon raising Casnoffs.I fell in love with all of these characters in Hex Hall and throughout Demon Glass and to Spell Bound my love for them all just continued to grow.
I adore Jenna and think she's a fabulous best friend.
I adore Sophie's family.
I couldn't have asked for a more enjoyable and witty series.
Want it... Need it!!! I kept hitting next page on my kindle at the last page.... that's just plain old evil!!! >.< I should protest the next book, but I WANT IT!!! and for some reason, I'm rooting for Cal... Archer... I trust him as far as i can throw him.4/5/12- finished the book in one sitting.... I was suspious at first with the begining but...it all turned out beautifully besides one part....curse you Archer! Curse you! Lol (team cal always!!)
Am I the only one who thinks witty remarks are nice, but if they were spoon-fed to us in almost every single page of a novel, then I will have to say 'enough is enough'?In another words, I don't have much high hope for that third book of the series.Short Review:1.5 star.I have a feeling that Ms. Hawkins was either not being serious, or she simply had stopped caring about her own story and characters when she wrote Spell Bound.
Sophie finds herself on enemy territory. She doesn't know if Cal, her father and Archer made it out safely. She doesn't know what happend to Jenna. She doesn't know why her mother is with the Brannicks and she doesn't really know where she landed.The latter question is answered when she gets attacked by a redhead girl with green eyes.But when she finds her mother she discovers that all her life has been a lie. Her mother is one of the Brannicks, which makes her one of them as well.Her family ar
They come even up with a plan but before they manage to go into action, Sophie gets flashed back to Hex Hall with all of the other students.(view spoiler)[When she finds out what Lara and her sister plan on doing she, Archer, Jenna, Cal and Elodie come up with a plan to put an end to it all.The manage to restore her powers and to escape Hex Hall and even to steal Demon Glass from Hell, only to return to Hex Hall to kill the Casnoff sisters and to restore all the Demon kids to their normal selfs.However their death didn't come alone....
Scenes, actions and plots in this book feel overly simplified and rushed.
The underworld scene - apparently the underworld is a cavern, a small one at that, and they walk couple of hundred yards in it, then it's done.Given the amount of hardship the characters are dragged through in this book, The emotions are very superficial.
scenes, plots are brushed over and simplified.
(hide spoiler)]In the end, I feel like the book is just going through the motion for the sake of finishing it.
I've grown attached to these characters and had hoped they would have more depth and growth in the final book.
I'm not sure how long has it been since I've read Demonglass, but while reading this one, it felt like it has been too long.It's like my brain lost it's ability to remember details from previous books and at some times, I was lost.I forgot names, relationships and some pretty big events that happened before this book.However, page by page, I remebered most of it.This was an okay last book in the series.
It was not an epic finale and I can't even call it a conclusion since it left open door for a spin-off that, as far as I know, will not be happening any time soon (if ever!).The writing style is really good.
I know I should have not taken this book so personally, but I've grown to really like Cal, and it has hurt me damn much on what has happened to him.
I hate Hawkins for doing it to him, she didn't even give him a chance to be happy.
Anyway, I was also hoping that Hawkins will write a little love story between Cal and Elodie, but no!
Just a slight comment from Elodie about making Cal change his mind about her.Yeah, this whole review is all about Cal, and not about the book, but I hope you'll understand my sentiments and I'm seriously grieving right now.
This is the first major down fall.The second is the story line, it’s just kind of jumbled and rushed and doesn’t feel right.
Perfect example of this though is the Strange Angels series, same problem.The other major let down is the big impending battle in the end.
Yer it’s not a big battle at all.
That’s it; the big battle that was built up in every novel goes for 14 pages!!
So many times Hawkins could have explored and delved into deeper many of the things she introduced in the novel but she doesn’t, instead she filled the book with boring and not needed/unnecessary scenes.
I just felt a little sad when I'm done reading it because I know,I will deeply miss the characters including Elodie,who I adored here in this final sequel,Izzy,Finley,Aislinn and Torin again(glad to see them here).I never reread the books that I've already read,but this series had totally got me and I'm sure,I'm going to reopen this one day.
And so yes, now I absolutely agree with my little sister Aj that "RACHEL" indeed is a lovely and a fantastic name!lol^^So my fellow readers,don't ever miss this series!
Not a lot of points for the story cause let's face it, nothing actually ever wraps up with such a neat and pretty bow.
It was very sunshine and rainbows and HEAs which is cool, sometimes you need uncomplicated and simple to ease your mind.And that's what this book did.
I loved Soph's parents, like a lot.
Not big on her boyfriend and best friend but her parents totally made it worth it.
:pAlso, I get she saved the world and all that but who in their right mind makes a seventeen year old the leader to their race?!
I finish three books and start and finish another a couple hours later.
Solid ending to this series. I liked how it concluded.
Esta serie definitivamente y NO SÉ POR QUÉ se transformó en un guilty pleasure impresionante. Sé que es mala, sé que es cliché y sé que es olvidable, pero algo me enganchó y me encantó. Este tomo, el desenlace de la saga, fue más interesante y dinámico que el segundo y las escenas finales fueron muy emocionantes. Se la super recomiendo a chixs que estén comenzando a meterse en la lectura.
(view spoiler)[Though, happy endings are too mainstream, it seems to me that the ending of the third installment of this book, this whole trilogy was heart-warming and pure happiness.
(hide spoiler)]The story has started when Sophie enter the Itineris and came up in the Brannicks homestead and in just that particular beginning, a revelation has shocked Sophie.
I don't want to elaborate but I didn't read an epic war, just fighting.2.
Some characters were not explained who really they are.Indeed, this is still a very good book that will bring you an abundance of laughter and a bunchful of tears.
Sophie barely opens her mouth unless it's to say something humorous (or the author's version thereof).
Likewise, it doesn't seem like her relationship with Archer has matured since the other books, & I agree with another reviewer who asked why the council would give her such a position of power when she's barely 17.
Talk about brushing a significant moment under the rug.Overall, it felt as if the author dumped all her leftover plot-bunnies into a Vitamix & blended into 300-page gravy.
If I had to pick a mood-food to go with these books it would have to be a big buttery bowl of popcorn.
It just goes so nicely with the theme of entertaining and fun as hell!I'm gonna keep this brief since really all I have to say is that I freaken love this series!!It's fun and funny, it's exciting and completely consuming.
The characters are incredibly easy to love, the romance is giggly swoon-worthy and the story-line is one big heart-pound.
This book was a crazy ride, and I loved it! It was a great end to the trilogy, but I'm going to miss the series!Check out my video review! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMbHME...
Rachel Hawkins knows how to make me smile !
That's one of the things I love most about this series is it's hilarity at all times.
Another thing I love about this book (and series) is that there's never a dull moment.
Those are the best kind a of books 📚Other things I loved:Elodie, has become a surprising favorite for me.
And it was Lara who turned Nick's parents cause they were close friends  (hide spoiler)] 👿 5) Elodie's (view spoiler)[ reluctance for Sophie to untether their bond.
Hawkins knows how to write a one-sit read, and she proves it a million times over with this book!
So much happens during the span of this book — and this entire series — that causes her to continue to grow yet still remain the same fantastic girl we know and love.
I wanted closure; I wanted recognition; I wanted time to cry, damn it, because it blew me off my feet even though the rest of the end felt perfect in its own way.
These books are perfect if you want to read something fast or fun or just plain awesome.
Fresco e simpatico, questo libro mi ci voleva proprio in questo periodo!Sophie è una protagonista che sa prendersi in giro, che trasforma, grazie a delle battute mirate, le situazioni più difficili in qualcosa di molto più simpatico.
Certo, mi aspettavo un pochino di più da questo ultimo volume, e si, sono acida, ma lo pseudo triangolo tra Cal, la stessa Sophie e Archer mi è sembrato, lasciatemelo dire, INUTILE, così come il sacrificio di Cal alla fine.
Mi è dispiaciuto anche non aver potuto sapere di più sulla riconciliazione tra i genitori di Sophie… pensate un po’!L’autrice sa scrivere con leggerezza e allegria e questa serie, comunque, si è conclusa in modo molto carino!
