هؤلاء من اختاروا العزلة خلف الجدران ..البسطاء ممن يختبؤن في بيوت لا يلتفت اليها احد عنهم يحدثنا هارولد بنتر باسلوب مسرحي مكثف وبسيط و مختلف مستأجر: يعطف على شريد افاق فيؤييه في بيته مالك : طموح متحفز و نقيض شقيقه في كل شيء شريد بلا مأوى : صعلوك متعالى يكره العمل و لا يقدر المعروفيلخصون دنيا كاملة بطباعهم و اختياراتهم المستاجر استون: و يرمز للإنسان العصري المنعزل👤 نجده دائما يصلح شيء او يعيد تركيبه..طيب القلب له نفسية الشعراء ..وديع محبوب الحق دائما في جانبه .
.و يتوخى العدل باستماتة ..لم يفهمه أحد ولذلك أدخلوه المستشفى و عالجوه بالصدمات الكهربائية.
As soon as a play is called something like The Caretaker you just know that the person who gets the job of caretaker, who is referred to throughout as the caretaker, won’t be able to take care of anyone, not even himself.
All the same, Aston is the only character to really offer any care to anyone else – and everyone else, even his own mother, lets him down in ways that are beyond belief, even when it would seem just as easy to provided him with care as to deny it him.And this is a play about the fear of difference.
I know he had it coming.Aston smiles at him when he thinks he is asleep.
That Davies is in this guy's room, pretending to sleep in the bed he gave him.
He doesn't know Aston, or what he wants from him.I was disappointed in photographs of Mick from a recent production of The Caretaker.
It is something he does on sight.Davies will later suck up and tell Mick that with him he knows where he stands.
Mick plays on Davies' paranoia.
If it weren't for his brother Mick he would be worse off than Davies.
The Caretaker is the story of two brothers, Mick and Aston, and a crumbling house.
The play begins when Aston brings home Davies, a down and out who is trying to live under the assumed name of Jenkins, and offers him the spare bed (Mick's old bed).
Then Aston floats the idea of Davies staying on as caretaker.
The Caretaker isn't my favourite of his plays, and I wouldn't rate it as his best (I'd put it behind The Homecoming and No Man's Land), but it's still a masterful piece of work, particularly for the blood-is-thicker-than-water quality of what for the most part seems like a non-relationship between the brothers.
بقيت مع ذلك رتابة الأحداث هي السائده، حتى تصاعدت حدتها قبيل النهاية لكن بعد فوات الأوان في رأيي.- لدينا هنا شخصيات واضحة المعالم، ربما نستثني ميك الذي لا نعرف في صف من هو حتى النهاية، فهو يدافع عن أخيه في وقت ويشير كلامه إلا أنه يوفق ديفيز في وقت آخر دون تبرير كاف لذلك، بل دون تبرير أصلا لغضبه الشديد من ديفيز الذي أدى به لطرده بسبب اكتشافه أنه لا يفهم في "الديكورات الداخلية" وهو ما لم يصرح به العجوز طوال النص، فهل يريدنا بنتر ان نتعاطف هنا مع ظلمه الناتج عن سوء فهم؟ أم يريد أن يخبرنا أن حصد صنيعة أعماله، بعقابه لسبب لا يسأل عنه أصلا، بين كان هو طوال الوقت يسعى لطرد آستون، الشاب الطيب الذي عطف عليه وساعده؟تلك أسئلة لا يجاب عنها حتى النهاية التي أراها بديعة وفي رأيي هي التي رفعت كثيرا من مستوى النص.
a disaster.I kind of get it, though.I felt the loneliness and the absurdity.
Too much of it that it got too, well, absurd.
I get what the writer tried to convey to the audience but for me, it was a reading disaster.
And this is what we get to study?A play that makes no sense AT ALL!
It doesn't have to make sense.
Their stutters, and hesitations, every "err" and every "uh" was evidence of it.Harold Pinter was part of Theatre of Absurd for a frickin' reason!
He made the entire story absurd to prove his point.
(But then again – Davies’s constant search for excuses is understandable, given the fact that he probably knows well enough that having his documents on him wouldn’t really change a thing, but as long as he doesn’t have them, he can pretend that his failure in life is due to the missing papers.)Aston’s philosophy greatly resembles that of the old would-be caretaker: he keeps saying that he will start the renovation of the house by first building a shed in the backyard, and when it’s built, he will be able to get down to the more important tasks.
It's absurd, and I loved it!

Post-war drama is bound to a mixture of absurd, often PTSD-oriented and pessimistic dramatization of the human condition struck by destruction and chaos.
Pinter carries on in this vein and gives us this short play.As a “not” avid reader of this sort of dramas, my review should be taken with a grain of salt.I find both the structure and themes expected given the context of the play (post-war/modernist/unconventional/experimental to a degree) which is a “good” thing if one is NOT familiar with this type of plays.
However, that is enough of me complaining about the loss of the element of surprise in a shock-driven, destruction-centred play.
تاني تجربة مع المسرح العبثي، واول تجاربي مع بنتر ومش هتكون الاخيرة.اللاشئ والعبثية دي اكتر حاجة مناسبة للغم اللي احنا فيه.

"The Caretaker" is the last play I read from the Pinter's collection I now investigate.
Before reading Pinter I was already acquinted and familiar with the works of Stoppard, Beckett and Ionesco all of whom seem quite alike to Pinter.
There is no absolute absurd in Pinter's plays and Beckett is much different from Ionesco as well.
I think that the two best plays of Pinter that I read are "The Caretaker" and "The Birthday Party".
Davies adjusts his behavior to Aston and Mick and even tries to oppose them at each other.
Modern Man has three faces- Mike, Aston and Davies in The Caretaker by Harold Pinter.
Mike and Aston are brothers and Davies is a tramp.
At the beginning of Act I Mike is alone on the stage and at the end of play Davies stands alone on the stage.
Mike rejects the audience and walks away after thirty seconds without uttering a single word.
Davies stands alone rejected by both, the brothers as well as the audience.
Davies after realising that Mike is the owner of the house plays tricks to separate brothers.
Mike is using his imbecile elder brother as caretaker.- See more at: http://vipinbeharigoyal.blogspot.in/2...
This was one that grew on me.
At first it reads like a bad Beckett imitation -- it is an imitation, but I promise, it is not bad -- but Harold's style eventually creeps in.
The characters are so unfortunately fraudulent to each other that even with the best effort, they have little empathy for each other (generally.)Mick's final outburst is perhaps the best outburst I've ever seen in drama.Oh, there's a movie with the actors from the original production up on youtube.
It's good.Highly Recommended
أول قراءة لهارولد بنتر.حصلت على المسرحية من معرض تبادل حين قرأت اسم بنتر عليها، كان عليّ أن أعرف سبب شهرة هذا الرجل، كان جو المسرحية مملاً في البداية وغريباً. يدخل الرجل العجوز ديفز على حياة الشقيقين استون وميك بعد انقاذ استون له ثم تبدأ متطلباته كأي طفيلي نعرفه في حياتنا، الغموض يكمن في شخصيتي الأخوين - ميك خصوصاُ- أما استون فإنه بعد المونولوغ العظيم الطويل الذي يقوله تنكشف بعض ملامحه ومن هنا بدأت قراءتها بشغف يقول استون أنه بعد العلاج الكهربائي الذي خضع له عندما كان قاصراً صار تفكيره أبطأ!هذه الجملة كانت الأعظم في المسرحية
Definitely not Pinter's best. If you're into Absurd Theatre you'd guess that this is probably the story of someone who can't take care of himself. And you'd be correct. Dialogue is funny, but not as witty as The Birthday Party for example and comes off boring in the beginning. No plot as usual, but the play sheds the light on some of the most interesting human characteristics such as greed, ungratefulness and hypocrisy. An interesting read.
Il y'a peu de choses que j'aime autant que l'absurde, que ce soit dans l'humour ou le théatre. Dans le théatre, ce que j'aime aussi, c'est la tragédie, l'espoir étouffé et l'accablement qui l'accompagne.Et cette pièce rassemble les deux. Pour ajouter à mon bonheur, alors que je m'appretais à lire cette piece en anglais, je suis tombée sur une adaptation francaise, mise en scene par Didier Long, magnifiquement jouée par Robert Hirsch, Samuel Labarthe, et.... Cyrille Thouvenin!!
Aston and his roommate Mick give shelter an old bum and take care of him.Or do they make sport of him...? You get here some fine comedy of menace. - Robert Shaw impersonating Aston in Clive Donner's screen adaptation. Matching Soundtrack : Ful Stop - Radiohead
First Pinter play I've ever read and found it rather enjoyable. The humour come from the language and the stage directions and the characters have alot of depth to them with some rather insightful, and long, monologues occasionally. A great read for anyone studying theatre, fans of Pinter and Theatre of The Absurd will enjoy this classic play :)
The play deals with postwar era and its themes. The moods of the character reveal something very sad and displaced about them. Something almost melancholic...... i wish i can see it performed live..Davies by the way is one of the most intriguing, annoying yet memorable characters i have ever encountered.Reading this play makes me want to go through more of pinters works.
Doesn't scale the heights of "The Homecoming" or "Old Times," but the dialogue crackles throughout and a number of startling scenes are both haunting and hilarious.
Good play. Strong sense of ambiguity. Good intro to Pinter's works.
Its Funny. Yet, deep.
Read it for my Literature degree back in 1990. Read it again after so many years. Highly existential and wonderfully absurd. What? Yes, positively absurd.
So maybe I need to give Pinter another chance but, more likely, I need to see his stuff live, where justice can be done to it, rather than me speed-reading it so I can get on to a book I'm more interested in.Ah well.
Yes Pinter divides people.
I think he is one of the funniest and most influential writers who ever lived..
"You think I'm funny" almost a straight lift from The Caretaker, only in the movie it plays out what is left as subtext in the play.
It is like hearing the distant voices of people who have been condemned and don't know it yet, and possibly never will.
New Zealand playwrites I admire who none of you may have heard of wrote three great plays inspired or at least influenced by Pinter; Ken Duncum's "Horseplay." Brian Sergent's "The love of Humankind", and Stephen Sinclairs thriller, "Drawer of Knives." Under performed and under read.
This play, an early Pinter success, is a play much in the same vain as Waiting for Godot. It is a tragic comedy, structured mainly on the success of its dialogue. Two brothers welcome a homeless man into their apartment. The man appears to be ungrateful and lazy. The brothers appear to be at odds with each other, but in the end perhaps the common intruder into their lives unites them in a sort of cruel farce. See my other reviews here!
Until this play, I have not liked Harold Pinter's work - The Homecoming was the last one I read and hated it. This one concerns two low-life brothers whose lives are interrupted by another man, a total loser. It is intriguing, the characters are puzzling, and I was kept absorbed throughout wondering what was going to happen next. The trouble is, nothing does. That is my perpetual complaint with Harold Pinter.Freak Out! My Life with Frank Zappa
