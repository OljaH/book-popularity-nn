The next book in the series starts of with Henry and Alec convinced that the stallion who sired the black is somehow still alive and siring a new generation of racehorses.
From there, it is back to Arabia and to old acquaintances, who want Alec's help in running down the ghostly stallion haunting the mountains.
But as a kid's book it works - lots of action and suspense, a ghostly horse and a unknown enemy.
So putting my adult eyes away and taking up my kids rose-tinted ones, I really enjoyed this.
CHASING THE BLAKC:S ELUSIVE SIRE Devoted fans of Alec Ramsay and his famous Black horse will be delighted by the mystery lurking--with increasing literary tension and menace--in this 13th in the YA series.
Could this all be part of an elaborate ruse, even a Trap forf the supposedly trusting youth?Far from naive about the world of horseflesh Henry and Alecnevertheless become embroiled in international intrigue--lured ever deeper into unlocking the mystery of the Black's reportedly dead sire, Ziyada.
Farley reintroduces a character from an earlier BLACK STALLION novel: Arabian-born Tabari, now a young married woman.
Alec and Henry learn a lot about Arab hospitality, as well as the Arabian love for horses and the lust for generational revenge.
When I was younger I loved horses and sought out every horse story I could find. The Black Stallion series was my favorite books throughout my whole teenage years, I read them all at least twice. This book is one of my favorite because it combined The Black with a good mystery. Alec goes to Spain to track down Black's sire, whom they thought was dead, but new stock being brought to America proved otherwise. I never could put this book down, reading it cover to cover every time.
A little too much goes on here for it to be a straightforwardly good Black Stallion book. Farley was not afraid of over-reaching, which is certainly fun but does cause some eye-rollingly bad scenes. Secret passages? We got 'em! Kidnapping? Yup. Unknown location? Sure. Ghostly horses in the middle of the night? Check. There's some misogynistic stuff in here that seems reflexive rather than thought-out. Not one of my favorites, for sure.
"The Arabian horse is the only breed with the courage to face a lion."I read a lot of these books when I was young, got read of all of my horse books when I decided I was "too old" for them, and now, as I'm collecting them all again, I'm realizing I never read some of them.
This is one of those.What I like about these books, besides the horses, is that, if you've read The Black Stallion, you can really read any of the other books about the Black, in whatever order, because they are all self-contained stories.This one is full of intrigue and drama and, of course - horses.
A quick reread of a childhood favourite. Exciting, fast-paced, with lots of drama! Revenge! Wild horse chases through the mountains! Near-death experiences! The unshakeable bond of a boy and a horse! Good stuff! Aaaaaaand then a huge cup of racism, most of it concentrated in the final few pages. Such is the danger of rereading old faves.
Although in a series, the book was complete by itself, sometimes referring to previous happenings that happened in another book, it was enough for us to carry on with this book.Setting was well presented, with just enough to see the area, but not enough to grow weary of it.Boys enjoyed the mystery. Also hated to stop.
It wasn't exactly what I expected, but it was really good. My favorite part was when the Black survived the encounter on the mountain, even if his sire didn't. My least favortie part was when Ziyadah was accidentally shot by Tabari instead of the Black like she wanted.
One of the books that spurred my love of mysteries.
It's not really a mystery.
Only one I can't remember reading as a child.
The Black Stallion's Sulky Colt The Island Stallion Races The Black Stallion's Courage The Black Stallion Mystery The Horse-Tamer (all by Walter Farley) I stepped away from my re-read of this series as I just knew the two books listed first were coming up.
These two (Sulky Colt and Island Stallion Races) were even worse than I remembered.
I wonder if The Island Stallion Races is what turned me off of sci-fi.
The Horse-Tamer isn't really part of the series but is about the Black's trainer Henry Dailey as a boy.
Alec and The Black have just finished a great test in their return to horse racing, however they face an even bigger one when they are dragged into the mystery of The Black's sire.
Alec, Henry, and The Black take off for parts unknown when they learn that there are yearlings in the U.S. that can only be brothers of The Black.
Adventure awaits, and maybe danger as well, as they attempt to unravel the true origins and uncover what really happened to stallion who begat The Black.It's another great adventure from Walter Farley, and many of us Black Stallion fans will take any excuse to spend more time with this heroic trio.
The important thing to remember about the Black Stallion series is that it has always combined adventure with horses.
It doesn't matter how that combination comes about, you know that when you pick up one of the books written by Walter Farley, you'll get both of those subjects with one read.
Is anyone going to find mysterious horses after being kidnapped and while wandering down a secret tunnel in a sheikh's mountain castle?
We all know it's not reality, it's adventure.
You read the black stallion books because the adventure is so unreal that it is perfect.
The mystery is just a bonus!
At first I had a hard time getting into this book, but soon I was absorbed.
I read it pretty quickly as it isn't too long.
I didn't know that there were other books in the series until I looked it up on this website.
At first I was worried that since I hadn't read the other earlier books in the series I might have a hard time understanding it, but I was fine.
It is an easy read that helped to relax me after a long day at work.
Alec is looking for the sire of his horse The black.
Some one had told him that he was dead.
Some one told him he lived in this remote place Arabia.
Since he was so eager to find him he got his friend Henry and went.
Him and the black spend time looking for Angel Rodrigez and he found out some one had set a deadly trap and wanted to kill him.
He found out that he was kept in a room and took him out in the night.
When he saw him leave he wanted to why someone wanted to kill him.
This felt kind of pointless, too, particularly after you read Young Black Stallion and a very important piece of caring about this book is retconned. The mystery was actually a twist I didn't see coming, so that was a positive, but the ending left a sour taste in my mouth.Still, parts of it are pretty fun and engaging, although other parts drag. I suppose it's all a matter of taste, but I really just thought it was okay.
This is one of the stranger books in the series. I had a copy from childhood until I was 29 and my copy was "well loved." I read this several times while I had it -- some times I liked it more than others. I read this before reading The Black Stallion Returns which was a mistake. You really need to read the series in order. I guess in this day and age the book would be considered Islamaphobic or misogynist.
This book was really only okay. Walter Farley tries his hand at adding some mystery to his popular series, but the end result is simplistic and far too easy for me to guess (although it might be okay for a fairly young audience). It also centers on the Black's Arabian origins and some of the people involved, which has never been my favorite aspect of the series (The Black Returns was also one of my least favorite books). A little disappointing but probably okay for kids.
I raced through this series as a child. Of course, "The Black Stallion" was my favorite, and I read it a few times, but I waited eagerly for any of the books to return to my branch of the library so I could snap them up.
I enjoyed the characters, and their world and hope I get the chance to read the story again and/or to read more within the series.My Rating System:* couldn't finish, ** wouldn't recommend, *** would recommend, **** would read again, ***** have read again.
This was one of my least favourite Black Stallion books. I don't think Walter Farley is in his element when he veers away from the racing scene and engages in alternate storylines. I don't think it worked.
There was one problem that I had with this book, and that was that it did not stay true to The Black Stallion story/history. There were things mentioned in The Black Stallion Returns that in this book, they changed. Aside from that, I did enjoy it and the twists that it took.
Found this one quite memorable, as it is different from the rest of the series. Creeped me out a little as a kid, too. The parentage of the black stallion STILL strikes me as WEIRD, all these years later.
I really enjoyed the suspense and twist at the end, but I really hate the fact that Ziyadah dies at the end.
Didn't like this one as much. A little corny maybe?
Another Great Book
Fantastic, an eerie (in a good way) story with plenty of scenes that create mind pictures to go with it. Definitely on my favorite mysteries list.
I gobbled up all of these books when I was in my horse phase.
