In writing Felix Krull, I wonder if Thomas Mann was trying to prove that after all his heavy-duty works he could still turn out a romantic comedy, although not the ordinary kind.
Felix Krull takes place in 1895, a time when no one (well, no one but people like Bertha von Suttner), had any inkling of the imminent tragedies of the 20th century.
One of the jewels of the book is Krull's "letter home" to the woman who is supposed to be his mother after he switched identities with a real aristocrat who wanted to continue slumming in Paris with a show girl.
Bitte verzeihen Sie mir, wenn ich sogar soweit gehe und hier meine, zugegebenermaßen recht vage, Vermutung äußere, dass am Ende Thomas Mann selbst es war, der den endgültigen Text verfasst hat, und sich dabei lediglich auf ein von Ihnen vorgegebenes Exposé gestützt hat.
Und auch die Unternehmungen Ihres verehrten Paten Professor Schimmelpreester, Sie in die unterschiedlichsten Kostüme zu stecken, worunter ja auch – ich bitte diese scherzhaften Ausdruck zu entschuldigen – das Adamskostüm gezählt werden muss, um sie dann auf Leinwand zu verewigen, haben sicherlich viel dazu beigetragen, Ihren nachfolgenden Lebensweg in groben Zügen vorzuzeichnen.Ich bin mir nach den obigen Ausführungen nicht mehr ganz sicher, ob Sie selbst es waren, oder eben Thomas Mann, der Ihr äußeres Erscheinungsbild als so überaus anregend beschrieben hat.
It goes absolutely without saying – but I’ll say it anyways – that I am overjoyed that I returned to Mann eventually, as his oeuvre is simply stunning; I cannot imagine my literary life without him.I was worried starting this book that I would not like it as much without Woods as the translator, but Mann’s writing is as wonderful as ever here; Mann himself was too talented of a writer to overly suffer a lesser translation; so while this was not as good as the Woods’ stuff, it is an accomplished enough work that it shines through.
Know that these are three loving stars, given out of respect for what the novel accomplishes even though it's incomplete and, most of the time, aimless and wandering.Confessions of Felix Krull is Thomas Mann's attempt at the picaresque, and Krull is something of a mix between Don Quixote and Ignatius J.
I'm thinking in particular of a scene that could have been cut from Dunces where Krull (a character very much like M.
The scene is hilarious because he truly thinks she's chosen him for his social graces and charm (he's a hotel elevator operator at this point).Mann conceived of the book in 1905, published it as a short story in 1911, and attempted a novel the year before he died.
Upon reading Felix Krull I have determined that I do not know as much about nothing as I thought I did.
Clearly Thomas Mann has much more of a grasp on it than me.
After reading the last lines of this novel I was left with the distinct feeling of just having lost something valuable, but not knowing quite what.
I think that my lost feeling might be attributed to the fact that the writing of Thomas Mann is confounding, and at least in the case of Felix Krull is dumbfounding.
Decidí dejar para mas adelante pesos pesados como "La montaña Mágica" o "Los Buddenbrook", descarté "La muerte en Venecia" porque no me gustó la película (salvo la grandiosa escena final).
Al final fue esta novela elegida porque me atrajo la sinopsis y el título.
No me parece que sea un estafador como proclama el título español, no es alguien que te engaña para quedarse con tu dinero, es mas un impostor, alguien que te engaña porque no es quien aparenta ser.Lo que decía la listilla de la sinopsis es que la novela está inacabada, no tiene final, simplemente deja de haber páginas que leer.
I recently reread Confessions of Felix Krull, Confidence Man (The Early Years), Thomas Mann's last novel and a comic masterpiece.
Mann based the novel on an expanded version of a story he had written in 1911 and he managed to finish, and publish part one of the Confessions of Felix Krull, but due to his death in 1955 the saga of the morally flexible and irresistible conman, Felix, remained unfinished.
The only regret is that Mann was unable to finish the novel; yet, the "early years" of Felix Krull still amounts to a small masterpiece.
Who knew the man who wrote Magic Mountain and Death in Venice might actually have a sense of humor?
I orginally read this in college while doing a course on Hesse and Mann.
After many grueling hours pushing complex sentence structures up Magic Mountain, this came as quite a shock.
It was as if it were written by a completely different Mann.
This is probably the funniest book I've ever read out of Germany.
I don't think it will wind up on anyone's top 10 list, but it's certainly worth a read.
κριμα για τον Τομας Μαν που δεν πρόλαβε να το τελειώσει.. όσο πρόλαβε πάντως ήταν αρκετά καλό
Felix just continued to go about his life and hardly mentioned his father after his death.
The book had a lot of potential so far, but Mann let me down.After the death of Felix’s father, Felix’s life continually and quickly took positive turns.
The whole book is about how Felix EASILY went from being broke when his father died to living luxuriously in Portugal as Louis Venosta.Other than the atrocious plot, I was not satisfied with Confessions of Felix Krull because it was very wordy.
כמה סימלי, תרגומה האחרון של נילי מירסקי ז"ל לספרו האחרון (והבלתי גמור) של תומס מאן.. למרות שמאן הספיק להשלים כרך אחד מתוך שניים שתכנן לספר זה, הרי שהקריאה בו, הרבה בזכות התרגום המבריק של מירסקי, הסבה לי הנאה רבה. מאחר שהספר לא הושלם אני חושב שארבע כוכבים ישקפו נאמנה את מה שאני חושב לגביו.הערה: מי שהשפה הארכאית מהווה מכשול עבורו/ה הרי שרק אעיר כי זו אינה בעייתה של המתרגמת חלילה אלא ברצון של תומס מאן עצמו לכתוב בלשון מליצית וארכאית בשפת המקור תוך כדי רפרור לגתה שתבע את המשפט "כל מה שפרסמתי אינם אלא קטעים של וידוי גדול."
A friend's review of this is: great first half, dull second half.
There is fun to be had with the threefold perspective of young Felix, narrating Felix, and implied author Mann, but to be honest, if you haven't had your fill of unreliable narrators at this point of history, I don't know what to say.
The second half, on the other hand, is a perfectly done 18th century picaresque, but in the early 20th century--and here the threefold perspective comes into its own, since the combination of modernist narrator and picaresque tale is something I, at least, haven't seen much of before (I don't count the pomo narrators in this category).
I read this book in Tonsberg, Norway while visiting Mother's sister Babs' family there.
Babs, her second husband and their children lived in a very large nineteenth century house on the outskirts of town, a house heated by a tile fireplace extending from floor to ceiling, a house with a huge dining room very rarely used, a house they only half-occupied.Babs was my favorite aunt, having been the only one of Mother's two sisters to have visited us in the States when I was a child and being the intellectual of the distaff side of the family.
Unlike most family members, theirs' seemed a good marriage and I enjoyed the two visits with them despite days spent mostly alone while Uncle Tootan was at work.Consequently, I spent many hours doing chores, like lawn cutting, and reading.
Thanks to Horst Adler for suggesting this great book, I am no longer afraid of reading Thomas Mann!
Having just finished Confessions of Felix Krull, Confidence Man, my thoughts are still swirling; this book was certainly not what I expected, Felix Krull himself was not what I expected; in fact: It is not a book about a con man!
Certainly, Felix is a man who has a talent for moving convincingly between personas, playing different parts with great skill.
He sometimes wonders whether he has an identity of his own, and yet as I was reading the book, he always seemed like the same person on the inside.
I know Mann is very much a respected guy, I think I've chosen the wrong book of his to read first.It
Thomas Mann's "Confessions of Felix Krull, Confidence Man" is an extremely witty, funny, and entertaining novel.
In the three main characteristics that I use to judge a novel, story/plot, writing, and characters, it exceeds profusely.
The story is as imaginative as one could hope for and it's as funny as any book I have read.
It's Woody Allen to the extreme, times 10.
The characters are unforgettable, right down to the smallest and inconsequential characters.
And the character of "Felix Krull" is so remarkable and memorable that he already ranks as one of favorite literary characters of all time.
Sono sicura di averlo letto, mille anni fa. Ma non ne ricordo assolutamente nulla. Sarà meglio rileggerlo.
I've enjoyed all of Mann's books so far, he's my favorite writer at the moment and this was his final novel, so I was really curious about his approach on it.
I started to like this book and it's initial display of events from the first part, wich I still believe what they were quite boring even though they are premises for later habits of Krull.
There's something about Mann and his narrative style...it's charming.The first sentence is very similar to the first one from Doctor Faustus, my favorite book from him, and there are common themes with it approached in the last part of the novel (his "conversation" with Kuckuck).Zouzou, daughter of Kuckuck, is one of the most intriguing, wonderful portrayed characters I came across.
Felix Krull is the very self-reflective memoir of a self-confessed conman that is a great work of self-justification more than a revelation of the makings of a conman (although it is that, too).Then suddenly the novel becomes plot-oriented.
The making of a deal with a marquis is too drawn out.But when Felix goes to Lisbon and meets a mother-daughter pair, at least the story has an interesting focus.
But the dramatic monologue becomes secondary to the plot and the details, and neither, I think, is as successful.
I don't think it's a great loss that Mann did not write any more of this novel.
This is a novel Thomas Mann began when a young man and finished when an old man.
To think up such a character requires youth - to create such a being requires patience, persistence, knowledge, energy and incredible skill and competence, in short, a matured genius.This is the kind of book many great writers have within them but very few ever find the courage to produce.
Thomas Mann did his best and gave us - The Confessions of Felix Krull, Confidence Man.Though the book ends too soon and we feel cheated and bereft - none, I think, will regret having met and loved (and hated) Felix Krull.Highly Recommended.
After a lifetime spent largely in writing rather ponderous novels, Thomas Mann decided to defy expectations in his last book, which is, despite showing a certain amount of craft, essentially the sort of soft-core pornography that is usually written under pseudonyms and sold in drug stores.
Perhaps he wished to show people that he was not a snob,and he may, after finishing Doctor Faustus have found this sort of writing relaxing.
He no doubt thought, correctly, that, given his reputation, many critics would construe anything he wrote as terribly profound.
The fact is, however, that junk is junk, even when it is by Thomas Mann.
I read this book when I was 18 years old and it is still very clear on my memory. It is an amazing book for all ages. But it should be mandatory for people who are starting out their life journey.
3.5 stars. Definitely a different read than Magic Mountain, and bizarrely entertaining considering it's 400 pages of pretentious first person prattle from an insufferable jackass.
עד שאני סוף סוף מוצא ספר שלך תומאס מאן שאני מסוגל לקרוא עד הסוף, מתברר שהוא לא גמור 😐
But I was still disappointed to read a novel that felt like a fragment, that stopped before it got going properly, that did not show Felix for all he could have been, and which ended on a note that felt random, rather than necessitated by events that went before.And I am not alone in this frustration, it seems.
Hm. I dont think so.Unfortunately, Thomas Mann died before he could finish the novel.
I finished the novel with a sense of melancholy, a sense that I read something that had yet to mature into its full bloom, that the author's death had not allowed to develop its full potential.
Я боюсь представить, сколько еще бы продолжались эти "преключения", если бы не смерть автора ...
Ну зачем мне знать как сервирован стол, если это в будущем не играет вообще никакой роли?
Сам Круль тоже отдельная тема.
Не знаю, может если бы автор не умер и успел бы закончить труд всей своей жизни (видите ли, десятилетиями он работал над этим романом) то вышло бы что-то сносное, но нам этого уже не суждено узнать.
А я же осталась у разбитого корыта, так как вместо импозантного негодяя, получила эгоистичного сноба.
Тема: Книга с невероятно харизматичным злодеем
Otra obra magistral del maestro Mann. Murió antes de Acabarla y está inacabada. Aún así merece la pena su lectura. Solo los más grandes pueden permitirse una obra inacabada que sigue reeditándose con el paso de las décadas.
2,5 *
Сподобався початок і середина роману, кінець не надто припав до душі.
