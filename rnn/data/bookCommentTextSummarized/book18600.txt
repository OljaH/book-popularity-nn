But in The Witness the story was  tight, the characters interesting, the romance swoon worthy, and the suspense totally believable.
Everything tied together, just like a great story should!I never thought romance suspense was Ms Roberts best genre, but she nails it in The Witness.
Like I said, I didn’t think romance suspense was Ms Roberts best genre, but I am now eating my words.
When Abigail is in the hospital near the end of the book, I hoped her mother would come in wearing a scrub outfit and they’d reconnect.
So the book ended perfectly, and my farcical hope of a mother-daughter reunion was not to be had.
4 stars (seriously leaning towards 5 stars)Well, well, well… What a pleasant surprise!
I’m new to Nora Roberts and, to tell you the truth, I didn’t expect too much.
I mean, my neighbor was reading her books while I was crying over Bambi’s mom.Well I was wrong.Everything was kick ass good, though the heroine outshone everybody and everything.
One of my most favorite heroines ever.

When I tell people that I read romance, they often ask, "Like Nora Roberts?" I'll confess, I used to scoff at those people.
I viewed myself as way hipper or cooler than Nora Roberts...
Nora Roberts can write her ass off.This book is for fans of quirky, independent women.
The narration made an already stellar story come to life.If you like Nora Roberts or you like romantic suspense, you must try this book.
But if you are like me and are not well acquainted with either, you STILL MUST TRY THIS BOOK!
This is a must read for romance-lovers, especially audiobook lovers.
The set-up to the main plot was really really good, fascinating, but then the rest of the book never reaches that level again.
To be honest, I'm a bit mean giving this two stars, but on a comparative level to the books I would give three stars, it falls a little bit flat.I was reading, reading, reading and when I finished, all I thought was, that's it?
So many characters that weren't developed yet (the bad guys) and she didn't extend the plot any further, instead she just concentrated on the romance part.
But I feel frustrated at the potential this book has, and this potential was never reached.
“If I wanted friends, I’d join a book club.” Yeah, I like this girl. She had an extremely shitty day when she was 16.No, even shittier than this one.She witnessed a double murder and became the key to taking down a powerful organized crime family. This led to witness-protection, and more murders, and then to a life on the run until we find her living as a hermit in the Ozarks.All she ever wanted to do was fit in. But, it just wasn't meant to be.Missed it by that much.So, our heroine meets up wi
She had an extremely shitty day when she was 16.No, even shittier than this one.She witnessed a double murder and became the key to taking down a powerful organized crime family.
She's armed better than most of your small militias, has a kick-ass guard dog who speaks several languages, and has state-of-the-art security that makes the White House look like this place:She is totally not interested in starting a relationship with the cop.
“I like sex.” “See there, we just keep finding common ground.
It works every time.I really liked both characters in this story.
5 stars – Contemporary Romance/Romantic SuspenseIt’s hard to deny the talent and mass appeal of Nora Roberts considering The Witness is her 200th book.
Some of her books tend to be a little bit too generic and plain vanilla for my taste, but I occasionally enjoy their comfort like good old vanilla ice cream, even if it doesn’t make them all that memorable.The Witness is one of the better NR books that I’ve read.
Often I find that my reading enjoyment tends to hinge on my feelings about the hero, but this time it was primarily the unique, unforgettable heroine who made me like the book so much.
Twelve years later, she moves to a small town and meets and falls in love with the local sheriff, Brooks.
Elizabeth's character comes across as the stereotypical genius who would never, in a million years, be able to blend in in any gathering that didn't involve Mensa members.
Her love interest, Brooks, comes across as a paragon of virtues.
After they meet, the majority of the book revolves around their relationship and Elizabeth's caution and security interests; the alarms that alert her when intruders(or visitors) come on her property, her possession of numerous handguns, the loyal and well trained guard dog.
**********************************************Chicago some years ago...Elizabeth Fitch is a sixteen years old super intelligent girl with a very controlling mother who let loose one (..ONE single) night.
Our hero Brooks is a man who likes to protect.
I like suspense stories with a lot of romance feeling there...and some steamy hot moments.
~ I crawl to the cross, it may be more NR soon.I LIKE - surprising good (audio) stories extremely well narrated****I gifted the translated (yes there really are some romances in Swedish sometimes) paperback to my older (71) mom last xmas.
Fantastic read featuring one of the best heroines I have seen in a long time.
The hero was such a great personality, he was funny and easy going but had endless patience to get through all of Abigail/Liz's barriers (which she had very good reasons for having).
I enjoyed all of this book, parts were very suspenseful and other parts were funny and engaging.
Obviously I recommend this book if you enjoy contemporary romance or romantic suspense.I listened to this on audio and the narrator does a great job showing the heroine's personality in the reading and she even did the male parts well.
Nora Roberts has always been THAT author for me. The author that you know no matter what mood you were in, her books would be just right. But for some unexplainable reason, I have not read one of her books in such a long time. So when I received The Witness as a gift from my wonderful friend, I dove right in. And, as sure as the sun rises in the East, the book was perfect in every way. First, I want to introduce you to Elizabeth Fitch. She is the sixteen year old daughter of Dr. Susan L. Fitch.
The author that you know no matter what mood you were in, her books would be just right.
First, I want to introduce you to Elizabeth Fitch.
After Dr. Fitch leaves for a medical convention, Elizabeth goes to a mall for the first time, shops, and runs into a girl she once knew in school.
Elizabeth has become Abigail Lowery.
I loved Brooks and Abigail together.
But, Brooks knows Abigail is hiding something.
And can Abigail dare to dream of a future with Brooks, in this lovely town?
I loved this book so much.
You will fall in love with Elizabeth/Abigail and Brooks.
I loved this book! My emotions were all over the place on this one from happy, sad, scared, anticipation and profound sarrow for the heroine.  I absolutely fell in love with the strong yet venerable girl/woman and I loved that she finally found someone that she can finally count on. Brooks and liz/Abby have become my all time FAVORITE Nora Roberts H&h...my only issue is that I wish we had more of an epilogue.
The Witness 4  Stars!Very enjoyable read by Nora Roberts. Being a huge fan of her In Death series, which she writes under the pseudonym of J D Robb, I wanted to give her other books a try. I found myself totally absorbed in this compelling and intriguing novel. From the exciting beginning, when Liz becomes a witness to a brutal crime, to her transformation into Abigail, loner and security expert, I was drawn to her character and circumstances. The town where she settles is full of interesting ch
There was one other character who played a major role in the book and I feel is worth a mention, Abigail’s dog Bert.
He was as much a part of the story as Brooks and Abigail, and I found myself looking forward to the parts of the book where he was present.
When I read an epilogue, I expect and look forward to an update of the characters and what has become of them and their lives.
She is a narrator that I will be looking for in my future audio reads.
3.5-4 Stars for the story and writing.3 Stars for narration. The narrator sounded very young and that was fine when Elizabeth was sixteen, and just okay when she was twenty-eight. Her male voices were okay. The narrator's Russian accent was very good.
I have no problem reading about a group of friends or relatives in a trilogy, but it was nice to know that everyone I met in the book existed solely to enrich this book.One thing I love about this author is the way she sets up the backstory.
It wasn’t just some simple, manufactured reason, blown up to epic proportion to provide drama.I think that the heroine, Abigail (originally Elizabeth), was a great character, but she occasionally veered toward the cold end of things.
But the more I thought about it the more I realized that the book wasn’t set up to play out like the usual Suspense story.
She just wants to be left alone with her genius self, hiding from the world behind her ridiculously modern security system and faithful guard dog, Bert.
Small towns are not a good place to hide, Abigail!!She quickly catches the eye of the local police chief, Brooks Gleason.
Get a dog!The suspense is offset by the love story between Brooks and Abigail and I just loved it!
The bad guy's comeuppance is alluded to, but after reading this very long book, I needed more of an eff you that what I got.
This was highly crucial to go back to when things went pear-shaped so that we could relate to the older version of this character, who is now living as Abigail Lowery.What didn't work quite as well as the diversion that the storyline takes with the Blake family and their out-of-control son.
I could see the love between Abigail and Brooks, and I really liked how Brooks was willing to be there for her and to be whatever she needed him to be.
As for Abigail, I think loving Brooks helped her to grow in crucial ways.
The Witness is a great entertainment. There is a controlling mother, murder and a teenager-witness, corruption, betrayal, hiding under an alias and building a new life, constant fear of discovery and romance (it’s a Nora Roberts book, after all). If you are looking for some angst and thrilling moments, it might be just the pick for you.
The other woman is usually a beautiful blonde, and she is either a bitchy ex-wife, or a clinging ex-girlfriend who won't let go.
Would a woman afraid of any situation that makes her physically vulnerable just go off and have sex, a situation which makes a person more defenceless, less able to respond to a sudden attack, than almost any other circumstance?Further, it just does not make sense how Elizabeth keeps saying she wants to be normal.
Yes, she has genius IQ and was brought up by a controlling mother, and she experienced a trauma and perceives herself under threat, but since seventeen she has been in charge of her life and if she really wanted to, she could live much more normally.
Ahora que espero menos del romance de los libros de esta mujer, la disfruto más. Porque el romance n me ha gustado. Sí, ambos te conquistan, aunque hay facetas suyas que no me terminan de convencer, pero lo que seguro que no hace es convencerme de ese amor tan grande en tan poco tiempo, sobre todo, con la situación que plantea. en ese sentido me deja un poco fríaPor lo demás, el suspense está bien, engancha y aunque me hubiera gustado que fuera un poco menos predecible, la he disfrutado y me ha enganchado.
Lol. LOVE the book and the narrator!
She is a heroine extraordinaire, with class, honesty, brains, courage, and kindness.Loved the secondary characters in the small Southern town, especially Sunny, Brooks' hippie mother who paints fantastical murals on her house.
Heartwarming scenes with Abby's protective dog, Bert -- especially when he got to finally romp around with kids and dogs, after so many years of hiding in isolation.
I didn't like Tybal the drunken wife beater and didn't want him to (view spoiler)[ become almost a hero for refusing payment to kill Brooks  (hide spoiler)].
This was classic Nora Roberts.Quick summary --- Liz witnesses a double murder, gets put in protective custody, her safety is compromised and she runs for 12 years.
She finds a man (Brooks) who loves her even after he finds out what she is running from.
(view spoiler)[ This book has a great HEA where the girl gets the guy and the bad guys go down...but I was a little worried at the end...whew!
Abigail also teaches Brooks to learn to value the everyday, which is something we should all take to heart.So overall, it is a great read...the best book Nora Roberts has put out in a while!
Abagail is not sure she wants a relationship but Brooks wins her over, but will she ever tell him her secret?I really wish NR would stick to straight romance because I think she does those really well.
The first problem with The Witness is the main character Elizabeth/Liz/Abagail.
Brooks isn't a bad character but is a typical NR male: bossy, pushy and always sure he is right.
As for the mystery, it wasn't bad but the book seemed very segmented between the first section and the second.
The first is all about the mob and the murders, the second all about Abagail and Brooks falling in love.
This book was amazing
It's my new favorite NR suspense!Elizabeth has such a tragic childhood, and it's heartbreaking to see a mother treat their 'offspring' that way, but without this section of the book, I think we'd lose a lot of the quirks and ways Abigail views life.
The whole 'protect and serve' vibe from him doesn't hurt either, in fact, it goes a long ways towards making him even sexier because he does it in such a charming and non evasive way.The actual suspense part was a little fast ending for me, and we didn't get as full a description of what happens to the bad guys, but I think the focus remaining on Abigail taking them down, doing it her way, all while knowing Brooks is there for her is the main point we're suppose to get.
I kept with it and am I SO GLAD I did because this book ended up being another great read by Nora Roberts.Elizabeth is a star college student, a brainiac with big aspirations and she possesses the natural talent to achieve them.
As Elizabeth agrees to go to their home, she knows that something bad is about to happen...THE WITNESS is a great thriller.
You just want to know what happens.I am so glad I found this book because now I can recommend it to others who adore Nora and her books.
4.5 starsThe Witness is perhaps Nora Roberts’ best and most successful romantic suspense novel, which is saying something considering the dozens we have to choose from.
But Brooks is easygoing and incredibly stubborn, determined to learn the paranoid lady’s secrets.Abigail/Elizabeth is by far the most intriguing of Nora’s characters (not counting Eve Dallas and Roarke, of course).
Nora Roberts’ unparalleled storytelling and unforgettable characters would make an addict out of any reader, which is precisely what she’s been doing for over 35 years.
For those of you who are new to her writing, The Witness might just be the best place to start.
4.5 stars!Wow. This book is long but worth every minute of the reading time.
We have a smart, brave, strong heroine.
We get it meet the Hero at 21% but I didn't mind.
The Hero is kind and honorable.
I love him too but I am more into the heroine :) This could have been a 5 star read for me but I really wanted to know more about what happened to the bad guys.
You'll get what I mean once you read the book.
Overall, it was a very good read with a smart, strong woman :)
There is very little "telling" in this book, and a good deal of "showing" as Roberts uses interaction and dialogues to reveal her characters' strength and weaknesses.I enjoyed getting to know the grown-up Elizabeth/Abigail, with her socially awkward ways and her paranoid lifestyle.
Brooks has some things in common with other Robert's heroes, but I liked him and liked the way Abigail held her own with him.
Roberts, thankfully, went easy on the quirky sentence fragments that have been the hallmark of her dialogues in recent works.
This could be in part because Abigail talks like the girl genius she is, so not many sentence fragments for her!
*4,5 stars*"You're the sexiest thing, in the strangest ways."With The Witness we have a great story with great characters development. Nora Roberts at her finest.The first quarter of the book sets the plot and is told from Liz/Abigail point of vue when she was 16 and is the proof that a teenage POV can be interesting and endearing. Then we make a 12 years jump in time.  The things I loved in this book: - Liz/Abigail. I absolutely L O V E D her! She is a genius (literally). Because she's a genius

The things I loved in this book:
Because of the way her mother raised her she's socially awkward but she's also kind, loving and endearing.
He's the perfect match for Liz/Abigail.
He is strong and patient, and I L O V E the way he won Abigail over.
I didn't expect much going into it and I was pleasantly surprised.
Sixteen year old Elizabeth Fitch has an awful mother who's insensitive and controlling.
She meets someone and things are going really well until they aren't.
She witnesses a mafia murder and just barely escapes with her life.
Twelve years later, she is now Abigail living in a quiet, rural town who keeps to herself and hiding from her past.
Brooks was a wonderful character to read about.
Brooks and Abigail also reminded me a lot of Booth and Brennan from Bones.
