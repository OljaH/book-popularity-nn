The G-String Murders is one of those books that is eclipsed by the fame of its author, in this case the most famous strip-tease artiste of them all, Gypsy Rose Lee.For many years it was claimed that the book was ghost-written by successful mystery writer Craig Rice (a pseudonym used by Georgiana Ann Craig).
Gypsy Rose Lee might not have been the world’s most accomplished mystery writer but she certainly knew the world of burlesque.
The novel is set entirely within that world and she brings it vividly to life, in all its seedy but fascinating glamour.The heroine of the novel is a stripper named Gypsy Rose Lee, working in a burlesque theatre in New York.
p 87 February HouseThis wouldn't three for anyone else but meSucker for a happy ending!!
A noir/pulp novel?
And while the girls that work there are telling secrets about each other and trying to perform, the murder still lurks around them, threatening to kill even more.Now I know most books have a mistake in the printing somewhere.
A wrong letter, a misplaced quotation - it's to be expected.
However, this book had a fair number of mistakes that really did detract from the reading.
And, for the money I spent on the book, I would expect more thorough combing.All in all, it was a nice, quick read that made me smile.
Naja...
I read this in the 1980s or early 1990s and was very favourably surprised by it: I'd expected it to be a bit of a grind (geddit?), a novel published solely because of the notoriety of its author, but instead found a sprightly detective tale that was lots of fun.
Obviously I wondered if there was a Gloria Grahame connection, but so far as I can find after a full thirty seconds' research the two women didn't know each other.I feel a bit guilty giving this just two stars, because really there's nothing wrong with the book (and, if every I lay eyes on its sequel, I imagine I'll read that too), but it simply isn't for me at the moment.
Being a Stanwyck fan I had already seen the movie but had no idea it was based off a book or that it was written by Gypsy Rose Lee. I thought the movie was a bit weak and didn't expect too much from the book but I ended up really liking it.
All the other girls were written well and you got to know there personalities to the point of them saying something and you think "Alice would say that!" Since I had seen the film, I of course new who the murderer was but if this is all new to you, I think it would be a surprise.
A mystery supposedly written by the famous burlesque dancer Gypsey Rose. There is questions about whether perhaps it was ghost written, but it was released under her name in the early part of the 20th century. This is a part of a series of reprints put out by the Feminist Press.
If you are looking for a great mystery, this really is not it. However, it's a fun book to read and get a bit of what a burlesque theater was like back in the day.Give it a try.
The Runyonesque characters are terrific: Gypsy writes in the first person, and the burlesque troupe includes the mysterious Princess Nirvena (who definitely never played Toledo), shop steward Jannine, Prima Donna Lolita La Verne, and the sweetly lisping Alice who suddenly gives in her notice and explains: "Well, I'm - that ith, he - I'm going to get married and he doethn't want me to...
Oh, I don't want to hurt anyone'th feelingth or anything, but he doethn't think thripteathing ith nithe for a married woman." Sod the Purity League, these dames deserve their 21st century encore.
I love many of the mystery writers from the forties, the backgrounds alone are entertaining. This one created quite a stir when it was released. Gypsy Rose Lee, or Louise Horvick, her real name, was a character in her own right and carried it over to this book. The mystery is solid, the behind the scenes look at old fashioned burlesque troupe is worth the read. Gypsy wrote two, this and Mother Finds a Body, coming up.
Super slow moving! It took me forever to get through
As she talked, he typed her words on [an] old typewriter...."After much discussion, they decided to approach the book like a jigsaw puzzle: first write down all of Gypsy's anecdotes, character descriptions, and entertaining burlesque details, then arrange them into a rough story line."If the action threatened to slow down, Gypsy could always sprinkle a few professional terms into the dialogue, such as "pickle persuader," "grouch bag," and "gazeeka box.""[Gypsy believed] that any publicity was good publicity.
A few thoughts: In my mystery group, there was a fairly heated discussion about whether or not Craig Rice, another more established crime writer, actually wrote this novel, or if she consulted on it.
Either way, the authentic aspects of the burlesque theatre and its actors’ lives makes the novel work well, and provides solid evidence that Lee was heavily involved.
As far as mysteries go, this novel isn’t much to thrill about.
When the agent solving the crime isn’t the main character (nor is the main character involved at all, really) the story ceases to be a murder mystery in a lot of ways.
In addition to penning her memoirs that would later inspire Gypsy: A Musical Fable, she used her experiences in burlesque to pen the fictional mystery The G-String Murders: The Story of A Burlesque Girl, originally published in 1942.Casting herself as the main character, Gyspy Rose Lee is the main protagonist in The G-String Murders, a legendary stripper who is hired at the Old Opera House in New York City.
This book is enjoyable because it's a fascinating glimpse into the burlesque scene, the raids, the theatre, acts, costumes, the backstabbing and infighting, the attitudes, the parties, early attempts at cosmetic surgery...
I loved the way the strippers were presented; they weren't glamorous or beautiful but real people trying to cover their flaws.
They also weren't people to feel sorry for, while Gypsy said the only reason she joined the burlesque troupe was that it was that or starve there was no feelings of guilt or shame involved in what they were doing, they weren't there to be felt sorry for.
Who knew Gypsy Rose Lee had such a caustic wit!
Readers of her New Yorker articles back in the day about Mother, sister June Havoc, and their vaudeville years knew, as well as her front-row customers.
Coincidently, Gypsy’s old farm in upstate New York is on the market for $1.8 million.
Mother allegedly shot her girlfriend there when the gal made a move on Gypsy (resolved as a suicide by the local authorities).
Gypsy also owned an Upper East Side Mansion in New York City, subsequently owned by Jasper Johns and now Spike Lee, that probably was a great place to hang out if anything like this book.
“A mystery set in the underworld of burlesque theater, The G-String Murders was penned in 1941 by the legendary queen of the stripteasers—the witty and wisecracking Gypsy Rose Lee. Narrating a twisted tale of a backstage double murder, Lee provides a fascinating look behind the scenes of burlesque, richly populated by the likes of strippers Lolita LaVerne and Gee Gee Graham, comic Biff Brannigan and Siggy the g-string salesman.
Then, when I was reading Peggy Guggenheim's memoir she mentions Gipsy Rose as a sort of scenester from back in the day (she had a few drawings in a group show in PG's gallery).
My interest piqued, I decided to make it my summer vacation read.
It isn't Tolstoy, but it was a worthy vacation read.
Maybe it is the insights to what a burlesque house would be like, maybe because it's a pretty good story, it's an enjoyable read.
And, it led me to keep the torch alive, I just finished reading Dashell Hamitt's The Thin Man (also a good vacation read).
Gypsy Rose Lee (or Craig Rice, or whoever it ultimately responsible for this messy thing) does create a realistic view of what life in a burlesque theater was like at the time and I enjoyed the nostalgia.This book was restored by the City University of New York (CUNY) as part of their Femmes Fatales: Women Write Pulp collection.
Even though this book was not my favorite; my hats off to the University for such a great collection of Pulp Novels written by women and I will continue to read this collection that they have put together.
Believe it or not, I uncovered this book at a screening of THE LADY OF BURLESQUE starring Barbara Stanwick.
based on a book by Gypsy Rose Lee!
Published in 1941 and a best seller, it was part of a series of Pulp Fiction books written by Women.
Unlike the movie, the book stars Gypsy herself as the lead.
The book was noted for giving a look at the behind the scenes at a burlesque theater and the life of a stripper.
The movie did not do the book justice.
Gypsy wrote another in this series - "Mother Finds a Body".
The debate rages till this day exactly how much Gypsy Rose Lee (aka Louise Hovick) contributed to this quite exasperatingly wonderful little sub edge of the 'hard-boiled noir' crime genre, set in a burlesque theater in New York.
It is certainly documented through the letters to the editor in this edition (whether they be accurate or just part of a clever media campaign, as suggested here) that Hovick had help with a contributor and with the editing team but I think that, with reading 'The G-String Murders' with an open mind, I really do believe that, what with the intricate description of the burly life around this time and just the routines one does, that the main penning of this fantastic little whodunnit is from the hand of Gypsy herself.
I couldn't finish this book, and had to take it back to the library, so I sort of abandoned it.
But as a crime novel it was just too confusing, and I really was scratching my head a lot trying to figure out where it was all going.
I suppose I'll try again for historical reasons -- Gypsy is awesome, and it's worth tryna finish her book, I guess.
Basically, it was murky and confused, so, like, whatever.

This book was not written by Gypsy Rose Lee it was written by Craig Rice.
Later paperback editions even listed the writer as Craig Rice after they thought the cat was out of the bag.
The Catalog of Crime by Hartwig and Tayor list it as by Rice so does the Bibliography of Crime.
Seems unbelieveable to me that a modern publisher would issue it as by Lee without doing a least a little homework.
As a Craig Rice book it is certainly not up to her usually high form.
She could certainly write better.

This is not so much a murder mystery as a semi-autobiographical view into a personality's life and then there just happens to be a murder while the writer is describing her life and what goes on therein.
The actual detective work in the story happens with another character and off screen.
The book was interesting as a look behind the scenes in a theater but is definitely not any kind of standard mystery where you could easily uncover and muse about clues along with the protagonist.
But all in all not terrible, just not great and not what I was really looking for.
"*** I received this book for free through Goodreads First Reads ***** The Giveaway was Listed By Cary *** I received my copy on Fri Nov 9, 2012 *THANK YOU GOODREADS FIRST READS AND Cary! "An interesting story. Very nostalgic which makes it difficult to visualize in some aspects. For the most part characters are left up to your imagination as far as visualizing them which can be positive since you can decide what they look like to you. If you are not familiar with Burlesque it will be difficult to understand many of the aspects of the book.
Believe it or not, I first read this book when I was 11 years old and it remains on of my favorite quilty pleasures Not because the mystery is great, although I love it and it scares me. The book is populated with realistic, three dimensional characters who have colorful past and present lives. It opens a window to a world Gypsy Rose Lee was was well acquainted with and she portrayed it beautifully on paper. It is a detail filled blast from the past. I know this will not be the last time I read it.
Someone is murdering strippers with their own G-strings! Gypsy Rose Lee, author, stripper, and amateur detective is on the case, mostly to try to keep from being murdered herself. The cast of characters are also the cast of the theatre, as well as other employees, and they are quite the colorful bunch! I did have a hard time remembering who everyone was at the beginning, but soon caught on. The language and ambiance of the setting were evocative; I felt quite immersed. The mystery kept me guessing, even (especially?) with so many possible suspects!
Controversy abounds concerning the authorship of this book. Was it ghostwritten by Craig Rice or did Gypsy Rose Lee bash it out herself?My money is on Rice, it feels like a Craig Rice book. Lots of characters, humour, cross talk, wisecracks and a mystery that sometimes drops in importance behind all the aforementioned things.Whoever wrote it though it's a pleasing way to while away a few hours. A little light murder to pass the time between those great serious tomes you've been meaning to read.
