This is, generally speaking, the goal of any omniscient narrator, but the way that Smith goes about writing this one in particular imparts a certain sense of smugness (the parenthetical asides to the reader, the knowing winks, the jokes at the expense of easy targets) that isn't always present.The metastable personality is the natural reaction to uncomfortability with final vocabularies, but it itself is of course just as self-defining as any of them (albeit in the opposite direction).
The metastable personality knows that in order to maintain coherence it must remain stable, and that the only way to remain stable is to balance itself on the disbelief of all known final vocabularies.
Of course this is not a one-star wretched ignominous failure, this is a mighty Dickensian epic about modern Britain.
Zadie Smith's omniscient narrator, alas for me, has an air of horrible smirkiness, like a friend who just can't help pointing out all the less than pleasant attributes of everyone else, all in the name of life-affirming humour, allegedly, but gradually wearing you down.
I hear this kind of humour in current British comedy all the time.
You don't get this in big novels about modern America - "American Pastoral", "We Were the Mulvaneys" and "The Corrections" and "Freedom" spring to mind.
My head says I should like White Teeth but my heart says Zadie Smith was a literary ad-man's dream come true.
It approached greatness in many ways---the clever and often hilarious dialogue, the quirky characters, the creative family histories, the rich and convincing place descriptions, and so on.
It took me until the final pages to figure out what was missing for me: I did not genuinely care about most of the characters.
While I laughed at Joyce Chalfen, Alsana, Abdul-Mickey, Magid, Hortense, and a dozen more amusing and creative characters, I felt no emotional connection to them at all.
The only character I sincerely rooted for and felt drawn to was Irie Jones.
“...the wicked lie, that the past is always tense and the future, perfect.” ― Zadie Smith, White TeethI planned on writing my full review of this book a couple days after I read it in October of 2014.
I loved realizing the London of Pepys, Dickens and Shakespeare was now a completely different place.
Viewing Zadie Smith as an individual it is easy to see her brilliance, her potential, and her ability from her first book to play with the big boys of English fiction.
In addition, Zadie Smith succeeds in keenly evoking their history, language, cultural ethos, the stench of their festering old wounds inflicted by an undo-able past, and their bizarre hypocrisies making the leap across land and oceanic borders into alien territory, exempted from being dissected by the scalpel of 'western reason' in the name of minority rights.
Actually, even worse, the author tried to build up the characters in most cases (though doing a poor job, I'd say), but then later reduced their roles to caricatures.
So even those I was inclined to like wound up irritating me every time they opened their mouths.Further, Smith's style is all over the place.
At times I found it indulgent and pretentious, others fawningly resembling other authors, and the style would sometimes change abruptly from one paragraph to the next.I find what what often at least partially redeems books like this is an interesting plot.
I’d even hesitate to actually call this a novel; it’s more like four loosely related novellas slapped together with a very small amount of glue to bind them.
It’s more like four separate character studies.
To make this a little clearer, I feel like I need to write four seperate reviews in order to talk about his book properly and rate each section differently.
I’m not going to do that, but I hope you get my point; it’s quite a difficult book to talk about because it doesn’t feel like a normal book.
Just because everyone says it's good doesn't make it readable. Just because it has an 'ethnic' plot doesn't make it realistic. Just because it's about ordinary people doesn't make it believeable. And just because I read it only a couple of months ago doesn't make it memorable. Three stars because it might have been that good, I've forgotten all but the general gist of the book.
Oh Zadie Smith be still my beating heart! I devoured this fabulous novel. Smith is truly a master of plot and her ability to capture the voices of each individual character is inspirational. Never before have I read a novel which such a rich and diverse dramatis personae. I fear that this review is going to become a list of superlatives so I'll quell it here by saying, I loved this and I need to read more Smith now.
I'm about a decade late to Zadie Smith's White Teeth, one of those books friends recommended or I picked up at the library then put back and moved on to a different title.
The friends' children are first-generation English carrying histories and expectations; Samad and Alsana's twin boys and Archie and Clara's daughter inhabit the no man's land between tradition and the present that, really, is everyone's land.
White Teeth is a near-masterwork, the best book I've ever read about different cultures' slow, tectonic plate-like creep past, toward, and into each other.
Smorgasbord where white men get as proper a representation in the wider plain of reality as demonstrated by their worldy demographic percentages, rather than the plague of pretense sludging its way out of the past and into modern day entertainment maintaining against all odds that women are objects and people of color haven't been invented yet?
Rather, there's that periodic expounding on the smaller things in view of the bigger and vice versa, the sociopolitical/cultural/religious -isms galore in tidbits between plot and character and the standard rest, enough that I've just gone back to shove that four star up to a dazzling five because fuck it, I'd have to read ten of the classics to get the amount of true and glorious angry pointing out the lies and filth and prejudice of our world, our times.
Because the reason I'm willing to sit through the inconvenience of text-typing out this small something of a review is because this book is the shiz and I would think that anyone anywhere would find something to enjoy within the pages of this wondrous book.
Of course there are a number of negative reviews on this site and I wonder if this book suffered from the over-hype-backlash syndrome that has claimed the lives of so many modern classics.
Aren't you just hyping up this book already?" Probably.
--do you enjoy Franzian-type family dramas and narratives that stretch across multiple generations to impress upon the reader a grand feeling of complete character omniscience having learned about all of his/her familial/genetic predispositions?
Smith does a lot of meandering, but in the end, what do a fundamentalist Muslim, a Jehovah's Witness, and ardent animal rights activists have in common?
Sounds like a joke, but as it turns out, quite a lot.A few things this book had me thinking about.-How science and religion have become polarized.-How different one generation is from the next, and how this impacts both.-Many things are not at all what we expect.-What defines manhood.-How black and white thinking is so dangerous.-How one action leads to unforeseen others, and all of life seems connected.My only real problem with this read was the length of the meandering narratives.
A perfect book to re-read! This is a very funny book chronicling the lives of immigrants in the United Kingdom and focuses on issues such as children of immigrants forming new, collective identities due to identity crisis, the whole question about who is really English and problems in a multicultural community, such as which religious holidays schools should celebrate and so on. It's a very entertaining read.
I won't even attempt to summarise this sprawling, densely-plotted novel - suffice to say that it traces the history of two multicultural London families at the tail end of the 20th century.
Along the way themes such as race relations, religious extremism, immigration, and even the ethics of genetic engineering are explored, all with an intoxicating energy and a sparkling sense of humour.The aspect of the book I admired most was its focus on family.
Both the Iqbal and Jones clans are dysfunctional in their own way - obstacles such as marital infidelity and fundamentalism serve to threaten the family unit.
En White Teeth, Zadie Smith trata con agudeza temas tan sensibles y discutidos como la inmigración y el nacionalismo.
Estas familias tratan de hacerse valer a través de sus respectivos pasados en una sociedad que no coincide con sus costumbres.
Lo esencial en esto es que, a pesar de dichas diferencias, estas dos familias se relacionan entre sí sin mayores inconvenientes, hasta incluso encuentran pertenencia de forma cruzada.Resumiendo, en su primera novela Zadie Smith ha sabido desarrollar una historia estupenda, con personajes complejos y entrañables, mucho humor, emoción e inteligencia, todo esto sin ignorar la escritura, que es magistral.
Who would want to stay?
Cold, wet, miserable; terrible food, dreadful newspapers - who would want to stay?
In a place where you are never welcomed, only tolerated.
Just tolerated.
Like you are an animal finally house-trained.Despite everything subsequent in Zadie's mad output, I still regard this a jewel.
I've said for over a decade that I am confident that people will read White Teeth one hundred years from now.
Here's to aborted suicides, scooters and the marvels of our lives, whether we're bleseed with a twin, false teeth or neither.
Phew, I was exhausted after finishing this book.Faith, race, gender, history, and culture in three North London families are turned upside down, questioned, dissected and turned into a tragic comedy by Zadie Smith.Samad Iqbal and his wife Alsana, the original Benghali immigrants, who often sort their differences out in some feisty backyard wrestling matches while their two twin sons, Magid and Millat, the second generation immigrants, run haywire in their confusion about being British as their mom wish them to be, and being Muslim as their father demands them to be.
It's insane to think Zadie was practically my age when she began writing this book.
There is an air of confidence Zadie writes with which I loved.
The story overall is funny but it does deal with complex topics such as culture clash, identity crisis, immigrant experiences, parenting etc.
My only issue was the ending, it climaxed then fell into a mush of nothingness for me.
Maybe it's just me not grasping the ending, maybe it is clever in an odd way BUT I JUST DIDN'T GET IT.
If the book closed off better, this would've been a 5 star read for me.
Fifteen years ago, when I read this, I thought it was the best contemporary fiction I'd read in ages. Even though I don't remember a whole lot of the story, I'm still in accord with that memory. It's one of the contemporary novels that I can see myself reading again in the future, or at least sampling.. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .Previous review: What Uncle Sam Really Wants ChomskyNext review: Border CrossingMore recent review: ___Previous library review: Strumpet CityNext library review: Brick Lane
The Short: The only thing this book hates more than its characters is you, the reader.The long form presentation: Lets boil down the premise and get it out of the way.
Just a general Boo out to that.)Or, if the characters were anything but stereotypical one dimensional shadow puppets with two modes: Shouty and Really Shouty.The Narrator attempts to convince the reader (the hated reader) that racial stereotypes shouting at each other is funny.
I enjoyed the generational nature of how these families crossed paths and how each decision led to the most ridiculous set of events.The writing was amazing, at time the book was hilarious, sarcastic and poignant.
The research Smith must have done to find out about all these different cultures and religions and political events during the 1970s-1990s was spot on.
While there were small sections of plot, it felt like nothing happened.
The ending felt rushed and slightly disappointed.
Each time I did pick it up, I enjoyed it more than I thought.
And yet they all made it to Athabasca to meet Grandpa.Now, you may think that Danish immigrants would have felt a warm welcome in Canada in the late 1920s/early 1930s.
Still, they didn’t fit in because they didn’t yet speak English and they had some different customs.
Several generations later, and both groups of immigrants fit into Canada like they have always been here.
It’s hardest for the first two generations.So I could identify in a small way with the situation in White Teeth where people trace their heritage back to Jamaica and Bangladesh and are trying to fit into an overwhelmingly Anglo-Saxon society.
The novel that shot Zadie (née Sadie) into the literary stratosphere in 2001. A decade down the line and this is still a dazzling performance. A mordant look at first-generation Bengali immigrants and the next generation's confused Anglicization and alienation. A scalpel-sharp realist novel with teeth sharper than a puma. Plus (near the end) a witty debate on religion v. science. And so much more besides. Not head-over-heels in love with that ending. Reads more like an intellectual copout than a tightly sewn climax to me. Still, this is a clearly sublime must-read.
2.5 starsThe thing I love about these books that Kinga recommends for me in her ongoing - and so far hopelessly futile attempt - to educate me on finer literature outside my usual genre of formulaic, lowbrow romance novels, is Kinga herself.I feel like the care and guidance under her hand as akin to a big sister pointing out the wonders of a large, diverse, cosmopolitan city to the younger, countrified sister.

2.5 starsThe thing I love about these books that Kinga recommends for me in her ongoing - and so far hopelessly futile attempt - to educate me on finer literature outside my usual genre of formulaic, lowbrow romance novels, is Kinga herself.I feel like the care and guidance under her hand as akin to a big sister pointing out the wonders of a large, diverse, cosmopolitan city to the younger, countrified sister.
And of course, there's always that little delight to factor in that I take in recommending my romance novels to Kinga in return.
I loved this book, at times i was laughing out loud. There are just so many layers to her writing...she writes plainly, but intelligently, and it is full of humor and spunk. Her cultural isights are amazing...i swore she was talking about me at one point...and it was nice the way she included smidgens of dialect and superstition from 3 different cultures, with such depth! I completely recommend this book. Josh you were so right!
Dentes Brancos relata a história de três famílias que vivem em Londres, durante o período de tempo entre 1974 e 1992:Os Jones - Archie Jones é um inglês (ex-suicida) de meia idade casado com Clara, uma jovem jamaicana cuja mãe é testemunha de Jeová e que tem como único sonho manter-se viva para assistir ao fim do mundo.Os Iqbal - são um casal de emigrantes muçulmanos, oriundos do Bangladesh.
Zadie Smith cria um romance onde, com muito humor, retrata a normalidade das famílias disfuncionais e a anormalidade das perfeitas; os conflitos interiores gerados pela religião; a dificuldade dos emigrantes para manterem as suas tradições num país culturalmente oposto ao seu; e a luta dos jovens para encontrarem o seu lugar no mundo.
I wanted to give this book three stars, and then two stars. If I could give this book zero stars now, I would. I fucking loathed it. I'm sorry, but Zadie Smith is easily one of the three most pretentious writers I've read in the recent past. I literally have nothing more to say to her than that she tries too hard.
Whoosh!!! What a story! Started off well but sagged a bit in the middle, but 500-0dd pages later....wonderful! So pleased I persevered.
