The last book ended the moment a young blonde with a black eye came into a Mason's office.
As anybody knows the most deadly weapon one can bring to any fight is a sly lawyer, so the matter was quickly settled in the best interests of the woman and Mason himself who earned $500 for a couple of phone calls and a short visit (boy am I in the wrong profession, or what?) Let me remind you that the book was published in 1944, so according to inflation calculator the modern equivalent is $6,818.38.
Perry Mason novels are always good for escaping the negativity that surrounds us every day.
Same thing with Agatha Christie novels.
As for this particular case, it's the first time that the unspoken crush Mason and Della have for each other is physically shown.
In fact, this is the first of many Perry Mason novels I've read where they actually kiss!
Hubba hubba!
Maybe it's the result of them both spending a night in jail for concealing evidence.
My copy is part of a two-fer including The Case of the Singing Skirt which was also fun reading.
The school sought a warrant for his arrest and Gardner claims he “skipped town one jump ahead of the sheriff.” Gardner eventually settled in California where he studied law on his own and passed the state bar exam in 1911, qualifying him to practice law as an attorney.In 1921, a dozen years before his first Perry Mason sale, Gardner broke into print with a story he sold for fifteen dollars entitled, “Nellie’s Naughty Nighty.” His mother read the title and was so scandalized, she refused to read another word.
That, and the ingenious plots, are why I read Perry Mason.On the whole, the ones written by 1945 are the best.
She tells a story of having been out at her employer's large house the night before, where the employer, Jason Bartsler, lives with his second wife, stepson Carl, and a business associate.
Eventually Mason arrives at the house, cross-examines Carl, and convinces Jason Bartsler that Diana should be compensated for the sins of Carl.That would seem to be the end of it, but Barstsler is impressed with Mason and comes to his office the next day to tell a very different type of story.
Anyway, standard Perry Mason mystery formula here, with him having to clean up the mess left by a desperately unlucky client, a jackass woman-hitting dude, and a wealthy man with custodial issue.
The case and the characters are okay, although not exactly memorable—I just finished this book yesterday, and I already mostly forgot about the killer’s motive.
The amusing dialogue and snarkfest between these characters are pretty much the highlight of this book.
Perry and Della have gotten pretty romantic too, and it’s a pleasant treat for readers who have seen them work well together as a team.
THE CASE OF THE BLACK-EYED BLONDE.
***.To Be correct, the title of this book should have been, “The Case of the Blonde With a Black Eye.” What Gardner was trying to say was that his client had a black eye; the type you get when someone gives you a punch in the face.
Her boyfriend got to rambunctious and punched her in the eye: hence the black eye.
The next time we meet up with the blonde we find her with a dead roommate while holding a gun that was used to kill her.
Still, this was vintage Gardner, and was appreciated by his fans.

Worth reading only for the descriptions of California in the 40's---Raymond Chandler-lite. Plot, character development and relationships were lame. My first and last foray into Perry Mason.
Neither the best nor the worst of the first 25 Perry Mason books (I am reading them in order).The plot is complicated, but somewhat easier to follow than a few of tits predecessors in the series.
(Whew...it sure took them long enough!).
Sgt. Holcomb is back, and more annoying than ever.Sure, there are off-putting details.
Perry always asks Paul Drake for his best men, and Drake seems to have an enormous number of operatives.
Women forget their purses often (the women I know are not at all prone to that).But the plot is good enough, things move along well, and if you take a few notes as you read along, everything stays pretty clear.
I spent a large part of this summer at a fairly remote island research station and managed to run through all the books that I had brought with me. I found a copy of this book, tattered and pocked by honest-to-goodness bookworm, floating around one of the labs. It quite enjoyed it. It's only the second Erle Stanley Gardner I've ever tried, but already I think I can begin to grasp the formula. It made me miss working on the comedy-noir radio drama I used to write for at Oberlin.
An engaging mystery starring the one and only Perry Mason. When a beautiful blonde lady with a black eye comes to Mason for help saying she was beaten by her employer's stepson it sets in motion a whole train of events leading to murder and kidnap...A must for any mystery fan.
An action-packed, fast-paced mystery. The client though was a rank outsider to the crux of the mystery. Much more action here than in most of Perry Mason novels.
Me is reading and/or re-reading the Perry Masons. Starting to get bored. Am mostly just enjoying the details of life in the 30s/40s/40s.This particular book was not one of his best.
Loads of Perry-Della sweet moments here. <3 It would have been a 5-star but the solution simply came out of the blue.
Like Jason Bartsler, a mining tycoon who wants Perry to help him dig up his past.
And then there's all the blondes--the one with the black eye, the one with the missing Barstler grandson, and the one who winds up shot and killed.Holcomb doesn't care much for Perry Mason.
But leave it to Perry to get to the bottom of things with the help of Della and Paul Drake.
The back story about Jason Bartsler's missing grandson is interesting and I did enjoy the scenes where all Paul Drake wants is a good meal and Perry keeps telling him to munch on chocolate bars.
I would really recommend it.Diana Regis, who is the black eyed blonde in our story, comes to Mason with a black eye and wants him to take her case against her employer's stepson who have made advances on her and he and his mother threw Diana out of her room with nothing.Now, as simple as the start seems.
So Perry Mason tooks the case and went to meet Jason and cross examined Carl in front of him and so Jason got to know the truth.
But, Perry wanted to know why Jason hired Diana for such an unusal job.
I liked how in the beginning of the book, it provides some sort of a table of contents that listed all its characters with their brief introduction and placed the page where they would first show up.
It contains a great deal of suspense that for sure, a mystery lover like you would enjoy.I couldn’t say how much I truly enjoyed the story and I’m looking forward into reading more from this author.Rating: 4 out of 5 starsRead my full review blog postBuy The Case of the Black-eyed Blonde (Paperback)Buy The Case of the Black-eyed Blonde (Hardcover)To read more of my reviews, book news and updates:Main Blog: Blushing GeekFacebook PageSubscribe to mailing list
Of course, no story involving Perry Mason is ever that simple.
This involves Perry, secretary Della Street and detective Paul Drake on a hunt for vital clues as to what really happened.
Since circumstances caused Della and Perry to be at the murder scene shortly after it happened, they saw a vital clue that allows for the possibility that Diana is innocent.
Two vitals clues concerning when things happened and how much time elapsed are given.
This story has two ingredients that make a good murder mystery, discrepancies that seem impossible to resolve and an obvious suspect that turns out to be innocent.
This Perry Mason has some nail biting legal twists and turns in the courtroom, but it also is just as exciting leading up to it.
The black eye actually figures prominently throughout this Mason novel, with a blonde woman murdered, a mine, the diary, the debate of the rainstorm or the cistern water dating the time of the murder, and the unknown grandson.
Caught up in the excitement of the mystery, Perry and Sargent Holcomb try to out do each other on getting even while Lt. Tragg sets some very clever traps.
Perry dodges most of them, and through plain logic pretty much figures out who everyone is trying to protect.
#25 in the Perry Mason series.
Fast moving entry in the series.
She claims to have been struck while repelling the advances of her boss's step-son.
The son claims she came home with the shiner after leaving him for someone else at a club and her accusation is because he caught her stealing his mother's jewelry.
The mother backs him up but his step-father knows he's a bounder.
Thoroughly enjoyable.Perry Mason series - A beautiful blonde gets a fist in the eye from her employer's son, and Mason must defend her when her roommate is murdered.
Good, as all Perry Mason books are, but a few of the "clews" that Perry pieces together are more obscure than most of the other PM books that I have read.
Probably my favorite part was at the end when Perry's final play (long after the murder is solved) results in some excellent karma for one of the more unlikable characters.
Overall, a fun read.
As always, ESG creates a mystery that is compelling and entertaining--and one that does not drag on too long!
قرأت الرواية مترجمة، تحت عنوان الشقراء البريئة، وهذا كان رأيي بها: هذه الرواية قبعت في مكتبتي لوهلة من الزمن، لم أتحمس لقراءتها على الاطلاق وبدأت بالقراءة صباح اليوم فقط..
الكاتب بارع جداً يكاد يضاهي أجاثا كريستي، الرواية كانت مشوقة جداً بدأت بقصة اعتداء وانتهى بنا المطاف بوجود جثة في الباحة الخلفية!
أنهيتها في يوم واحد واستمتعت بها صراحة، أعادتني الى ذكريات قديمة جداً، حينما كنت في المرحلة الإعدادية وكانت سلسلة الروايات العالمية حينها المفضلة لديّ!
ملاحظة: اسم الرواية الأصلي باللغة الانجليزية هو (الشقراء ذات العيون السوداء)، وجدت الاسم الاصلي بعد بعض البحث.اعتقد انني سأبحث عن المزيد من مؤلفات هذا الكاتب!
There's a lot of blondes floating around this one. The only reference to WWII is how one character is too "yellow-bellied" to fight with courageous young American men, but not a world about gas rationing, food rationing, Victory gardens, lack of nylons, etc. Mason puts his arms around Della, necks with her in the car. They snuggle. A kidnapped child. Is he really the grandson, born of a dead war hero? Nothing like holding a first edition old book. How can people use Kindle and miss that pleasure?
The mystery in this particular novel is so-so. However it does have some redeaming value. Mason in the early novels runs circles around the police, especially Sergant Holcomb. Later Lieutenant Tragg is introduced who is just as smart as Mason. In this book both officers appear and pretty much foil Mason at every point, who just barely solves the case.
Personally, I thought that the plot was pretty good. There were a lot of plot twists and I was surprised a couple of times. I liked when Mason used his knowledge of the law to save his client. I was ecstatic when (MILD SPOILER!) Carl got beat up.
I have read several Perry Mason novels and liked all of them. This one was a little bit different, in that it really never entered the courtroom. I didn't guess the supsect until it was revealed at the end. A nice quick, murder mystery read!
fun fun fun , first time i read something from this author , for a pulp series that came out in 1944 , that was a nice surprise , apparently there was a tv series about perry mason , i ll make sure to check that out.
Fairly standard as Perry Mason stories go. Some intense courtroom antics but not enough. Attitudes are of the 40s. Parts of this were too confusing to follow.
Not the best of the Perry Mason series, not the worst. These things are so much fun to read!
My Rating System:* couldn't finish, ** wouldn't recommend, *** would recommend, **** would read again, ***** have read again.
