I haven't read other in the series so I found it kinda jarring. Some of the characters were so much fun, but generally meh for me.
An original stand-alone novella which ended up in Foundation #2. Pretty fun and cool!
I love Asimov with the passion of thousands suns: this one was one of my chilhood favourites.
