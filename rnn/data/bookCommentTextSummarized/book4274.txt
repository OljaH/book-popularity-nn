Depending on which of the 36 books I was reading, some of them I found to be very cerebral, and encouraging of my religious faith, even though I am not a Catholic.
Others of the works were stories- pleasure reading, and I enjoyed them as well.
It is hard to write a review while "reviewing" 36 separate books, which were quite different from one another.
Absolutely magnificent. I would whole-heartedly recommend this book to every person on the planet: it's one of those essential books. Not a single complaint with it, save that it ended and neglected his poem comparing men and women. Just great; one of the best collections of poetry I own.
Fantastic! Chesterson was never given the credit he deserved as one of the best 20th century authors. My favorite thing about him was the fact that he despised fanatics on both the left and the right. Search this guy out, you wont be dissapointed.
A lot of Chesterton's poetry is good fun. Most of it, really. The topping piece, however, is his Ballad of the White Horse.
Brilliant poetry. Ballad of the Battle of Gibeon is mandatory memorization for all Cummings children.
Simply Excellent
Wanted to like it....unreadable to me.
Some favorites: — The Mystery— A Second Childhood— To A Modern Poet — The Hunting of the Dragon— The Red Sea— Fantasia
