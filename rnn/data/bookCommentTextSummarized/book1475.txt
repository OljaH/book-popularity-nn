But this was a really good story and well told.Wells is known for speculating the future and has done that several times in novels such as “The Time Machine”, “War of the Worlds”, “The Shape of Things to Come”...
A least it sounds like satire until you realize that it is not, but rather, the way it really is (or was).
What is underlined is his comment on how absurd we, as human beings, were (or are).All this is written in the perfect form of a classic tragedy.A very overlooked novel.
I got bored of it so I didn't finish it. Hence so it's gets 2 stars as it be maybe a bit unfair giving 1.
This is the story of that life that he tells.I really enjoyed this book, with its framing narrative of the utopian future that allows Wells to comment on and criticise his own present through alien eyes.
Harry Mortimer Smith is an everyman, and through him, we, as well as Sarnac and his friends, can see the reality of life in the early 20th century.Much of Sarnac's incredulity about Smith's time would stand just as valid about the early 21st century as well.
I loved this little book about a man who dreams about a past life that takes place in early 20th c. century and follows his childhood, his move to London, and his sentimental education. Like Christina Alberta's Father, but instead of a small man dreaming of himself as a king, it is the reverse. The writing is beautiful and filled with warmth and the character of Fanny is based on Rebecca West. A minor Wells but major for me.
