Tragically the original manuscript of History of the Yorubas - countless hundreds of pages - was actually lost, a harrowing, horrific fact; but the younger (Dr) Johnson embarked upon the more than daunting task of re-writing again, using copious notes left by his brother...and after many years this wonderfully detailed book was finally published.
This is more than comprehensive, tracing the history, anthropology, mores, customs, language etc of the Yoruba people who now run into tens of millions, and are spread all over the world.
Very detailed history of the Yorubas. However, I think the writer had a little religious bias considering the fact that the author is a clergyman. He was even tacitly in support of colonialism. Regardless of this, the books is quite detailed and would make a good read.
Awesome read! Being a Yoruba woman and having grown up in the culture, I fully appreciate and enjoyed this book. Its a treasure and a joy to read.
This book is a stand alone book in the history of the Yoruba tribe of West Africa.
Read this book a while ago and intend to read it again before I can confidently review it.Though a seminal work no doubt.
Very detailed description of the Yoruba tribe, although I must admit that I only read the first half that seemed to be interesting to me.
