We do not come to write better; all that can be said to do is to keep moving, now a little in this direction, now in that, but with a circular tendency should the whole course of the track be viewed from a sufficiently lofty pinnacle.[Modern Fiction]In the essay Modern fiction, she is quite critical of the writings of Edwardian writers like Mr. Wells, Mr. Bennett and Mr. Galsworthy and labels them as materialists, describing their works as disappointing.
To drop metaphor, I think that after the creative activity of the Victorian age it was quite necessary, not only for literature but for life, that someone should write the books that Mr. Wells, Mr. Bennett, and Mr. Galsworthy have written.
I read this for my British Lit class and omg I loved it so much! I cannot wait to pick up something by Virginia Woolf, because if I already love this essay, then I can only imagine what it will be with one of her books!4.5
You may read online here.Page 3:" The foundation of good fiction is character-creating and nothing else.
But none of these counts anything like so much as the con- vincingness of the characters.
If the characters are real the novel will have a chance ; if they are not, oblivion will be its portion.
(Mr. Arnold Bennett)Page 11:Surely one reason is that the men and women who began writing novels in 1910 or thereabouts had this great difficulty to face—that there was no English novelist living from whom they could learn their business.Page 17:The writer must get into touch with his reader by putting before him some-thing which he recognises, which therefore stimulates his imagination, and makes him willing to co-operate in the far more difficult business of intimacy.

Utterly wonderful; so thoughtful, and brilliantly constructed.
Ok I really loved this. That's all
Amo Virginia Woolf come scrittrice, ma ancora di più la amo come saggista e critica letteraria, con il suo sarcasmo pungente e la forza delle sue osservazioni. In questo bellissimo volumetto, che affronta i diversi modi con cui un romanziere può costruire la propria opera, il testo a fronte mi ha anche permesso una lettura parallela tra italiano e versione originale (con annesso confronto di come io "interpreto" un termine, spesso diversamente dalla traduttrice).
Virginia Woolf is such a character, who knew she could serve so much shade! This should just be titled, 'The Roast of Arnold Bennett'. This is a great short read if you're new to the realist and modernist movements. So before you pick up 'Mrs Dalloway' or any other Virginia Woolf read, this book is really useful to help you wrap your head around Woolf's style. It's also a great analysis of different approaches to characterisation, even Jane Austen gets a mention (yay!).
Astounding. Enlightening. Amazing. Really at loss for other adjectives to better describe this incredible essay from Virginia Woolf. Absolutely loved it, from start to finish.

What a better way to kick off this year than with some Woolfian wisdom.A marvelous essay -and may I say a prophecy?- regarding the transition of English literature and its dominant mode of narration from the omniscient narrator to the stream of consciousness.I recommend these meagre pages to anyone who wants to witness an overflow in his reveries about the purpose of writing a novel.
Read for my global modernization class
Και αυτή είναι η στιγμή για να διαβάσει κανείς ποίηση, όταν είναι σχεδόν έτοιμος να τη γράψει.  Η επίδραση της ποίησης είναι τόσο ισχυρή και άμεση που για μια στιγμή δεν υπάρχει άλλη αίσθηση εκτός από αυτή του ποιήματος. Το βιβλίο περιλαμβάνει μια συλλογή δοκιμίων και άρθρων της Βιρτζίνια Γουλφ, στα οποία αναφέρεται στην τέχνη της γραφής. Μιλάει με πολύ σαρκασμό και καυστικότητα για τους διάφορους τρόπους με τους οποίους οι συγγραφείς επιλέγουν να συνθέσουν τους χαρακτήρες των μυθιστορημάτων το
Κάποιος που ενδιαφέρεται να γράψει ένα βιβλίο ή να ταξιδέψει πίσω στην Αγγλία της Γουλφ και να συγκρίνει τις συγγραφικές συνήθειες της εποχής, σίγουρα θα απολαύσει αυτή τη συλλογή δοκιμίων.Δεν μπορώ να πω ότι εγώ το απόλαυσα τόσο, κυρίως γιατί δεν μπορούσα να συμβαδίσω με τους συνειρμούς της συγγραφέως και τον έντονα (έπι)κριτικό της λόγο.
Είμαι βέβαιη ότι θα κατανοούσα περισσότερα αν είχα διαβάσει και τα βιβλία στα οποία παραπέμπει περιστασιακά η Γουλφ κατά τον σχολιασμό της, ή αν τα άρθρα αυτά διαβάζονταν στα πλαίσια του μαθήματος της Λογοτεχνίας στο σχολείο και είχα την αγαπημένη μου καθηγήτρια - φιλόλογο να μου εξηγεί τις αναφορές και τη συλλογική πορεία της Βιρτζίνια Γουλφ.
Adoro tutto di lei ma la cosa che amo di più in assoluto sono i saggi.
In questo saggio Virginia Woolf si difende dalle accuse che le sono mosse da un altro autore inglese, non saper creare dei personaggi reali.
Ho amato l’arguzia con cui Virginia vuole portare il lettore a riflettere e con cui spiega la sua concezione di personaggio di un romanzo.
La mancanza di un tono accusatorio ma la semplicità con cui confuta le accuse mosse verso di lei.
Come non si può amare una scrittrice così che da peso a tutto quello che scrive a partire da una semplice lettera, un commento, un articolo.
Come sempre fantastica 💕📚
Interesting as to comprehend Woolf-s poetic...
A lecture, delivered in 1924, arguing the necessity of "Modernism" in the novel, or as she termed it, the Georgian as opposed to the Edwardian novel.
A delight to read and an insight into the thinking of a great modernist.
It takes about an hour to read.
And when human relations change there is at the same time a change in religion, conduct, politics, and literature.
Let us agree to place one of these changes about the year 1910.”1910 is arguable, and it no doubt varied from country to country, but this is a "contribution" to the question of when the modern world began.
Woolf's criticism makes so much sense today, 90 years (or so) after she wrote this, when the "knowledgeable" author has a laptop and wifi as his/her main tool whilst crafting characters.
Everything but the character.
It amazes me how traditional modern fiction is in its pompous attempt to appear relevant and game-changing at the same time.
It only saddens me that her tragic end has been romanticized to such an extent that it casts a heavy shadow not only over her fiction, but also those witty, charming and hilarious instances in her masterfully carved essays.
Η καυστικότητα, η διορατικότητα, η ειρωνεία κι η διαύγεια του πνεύματος της Woolf αποδίδονται με εξαιρετική μεταφραστική κι υφολογική ακρίβεια στην έκδοση αυτή των δοκιμίων της. Ο κεντρικός άξονας είναι η συγγραφική τέχνη, γύρω απ' τον οποίο θίγονται ζητήματα όπως η σχέση τέχνης-πολιτικής, λογοτεχνίας-ζωγραφικής, φύλου-συγγραφικής παραγωγής και πολλά ακόμη. Για ακόμη μια φορά, η Woolf εγείρει ίσως περισσότερα ερωτήματα απ' ότι δίνει απαντήσεις, καθιστώντας τον αναγνώστη συνεχή μέτοχο των συνειρμών και της συλλογιστικής της πορείας.
Woolf's words are spectacular. If you are a reader or writer, this essay is especially for you acting as a challenge and inspiration to humanize the characters we write into being and pull from their pedestals those works and writers that we have a fear of criticizing let alone approaching.
3.5
Yes.
EXCELLENT essay.
Brilliant. I have read a lot of her works but somehow I had missed this essay until now.
Fascinating look at Modernism.
I'm finally jumping on the Woolf bandwagon. This was an insightful essay on the fiction of her time, but also of today's. Stand by Woolf, I'm not finished with you yet...
