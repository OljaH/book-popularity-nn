This audio-book was a lot of fun, the narrator was excellent and the stories were innocent and reminds one of a more innocent time while being entertaining and lots of fun. I recommend this book for children and the young at heart
Enjoyed.
I have very positive feelings about this book, but perhaps that's mainly in comparison to the utter garbage I've been reading recently. As before, I most enjoyed William's boyhood escapades with the Outlaws, particularly their half-hearted attempt to become saints.
But, I kept remembering bits of it over the years and giggling to myself.
The most abiding sentiment is of when the four friends dressed up as clergymen and one of them chooses to call himself sister so-and-so instead of brother.
Many times I have been treated to this comment by the younger sister upon a manifestation of my obstinacy typical of a middle child, and it's as funny every time I hear it.
Then of course there's Violet Elizabeth Bott, who's 'thix' years old and who, even for William, is a handful.
There is the usual ensuing of utter chaos and William emerging grubby at the end of it all.
i'm currently reading this but till now its too too good!!!!! alot of humor is stuffed inside this book. a must read for any kid who loves comedy
Was given this book as a child, this character is hard to hate...
