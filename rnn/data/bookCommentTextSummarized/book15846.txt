But, isn't Mickey's displaced mourning for his mother, his brother, his first wife and his longtime lover and last true love - isn't he just an exaggerated version of our own egos (obviously speaking to males in the audience but perhaps the fantasies of Mickey's women also strike a nerve for female readers?)?There are passages of great beauty in Sabbath's Theater - my favorite phrase was "while nonexistent to one another, unreal spectres compared to whoever sabotaged the sacred trust" - who else writes like this today?
Roth has said that Sabbath's Theater is his favorite book among all the masterpieces he wrote.RIP (1933-2018).
Mickey Sabbath is a monster with an unstoppable capacity for sex, lechery and outright molestation, plus a proclivity for sledgehammering all relationships between human beings who aspire to behave like semi-respectable grown-ups.
Instead of being locked up within five minutes for being a dangerous sexual deviant, Sabbath has reached his mid-sixties with a backlog of lovers with whom he has fulfilled all his perversions, and is currently lamenting the death of his East European fantasy lover and his sacking from professor of puppetry.
If you read it as a serious novel, you will no doubt aspire to strangle Mr. Roth.
I've had my fun with all the really dreadful barrel-scrapings I've read over the years, and now I have to move into the two-star category.
I will say that occasionally, like every 120 pages in a long long book, you get a pretty good laugh from Sabbath's Theater, always ALWAYS of the O MY GOD that's so disgusting variety or the pages-of-spewed-forth-insults variety.
I was going to say that's more than you get from The Bible.
But actually, that's exactly what you get from the Bible.
O my God that's so disgusting followed some time later by pages of hideous insults.
I storm and I roar, and I fall in a twist, And missing my whore, I bugger my fist.Grieving, Suicidal Puppeteer and Master Manipulator of WomenSwaths of this 1995 National Book Award winner pulsate with the prurient, the pornographic ponderings of Philip Roth, who vaunts his venery as a sex-tagenarian, plunging into the piercing tale of Mickey Sabbath, a 64-year-old primal puppeteer (-retired) with a penchant for prostitutes and loose women, bawdy bopping, and, generally, close encounters of the lewd kind.
ora. non che billy joel sia un mio personal guru, ma quella sua frase sul fatto che preferisce ridere con i peccatori che piangere con i santi, perché i peccatori sono molto più divertenti, la appiccico pari pari sul frontespizio di questo libro. quel vecchio dissoluto di mickey sabbath è un colosso di personaggio, e i virtuosismi delle sue perversioni e dei suoi ricordi (o erano forse i ricordi perversi dei suoi virtuosismi?) dimostrano, a chi ancora avesse dubbi a riguardo, che i grandi peccatori non creano solo grandi cattedrali. creano pure grandissimi romanzi.
After the death of his longtime mistress, disgraced former puppeteer Mickey Sabbath sinks deeper and deeper into a prison of depression...
First off, Sabbath's Theater won the National Book award in 1995.
Every time I thought it couldn't get any dirtier, Sabbath did something like masturbate on his mistress's grave.There really isn't much of a plot.
Sabbath's such a pervert that I couldn't seem to read more than fifty pages of this at a time.
Actually, I don't think there's a character in this book I liked.
I wonder if the next National Book award winner I read will have this much smut in it...
Ο κυνισμός, η μισανθρωπία και ο πεσιμισμός δεν συνιστά Τέχνη καθ’ εαυτήν, εφόσον δεν συνάδει με τη συνεπή κατανόηση του υπαρξιακού άχθους, του άλγους που συνεπιφέρει το πέρασμα του χρόνου, της ηδονής ως αντιπάλου δέους του θανάτου. Ο ήρωας του Ροθ είναι χυδαίος, υβριστής, παρεκκλίνων και ταυτόχρονα γοητευτικός, καθώς η γραφή του κορυφαίου συγγραφέα – αγχέμαχο όπλο!- τον μετουσιώνει από λογοτεχνικό μετείκασμα σε Άνθρωπο και τους αναγνώστες σε συνενόχους, συνεργούς και συνεπιβάτες σε διαδρομή μαγική.
479 pagine di capriole a luci rosse di un erotomane, ma a dar soddisfazioneè la scrittura di Roth - lui sì che non perde un colpo -, la sua capacità di racchiudere in una struttura organizzata l’infinità di cose raccontate, di creare persone fra le pagine, di raccontare la loro storia, i loro umori, rabbie, dolori, passioni, il tutto calato nel contesto in cui vivono.
Dapprima per motivi che - essendosi lui sempre comportato nel suddetto modo - rasentano l’assurdo, il colmo dei colmi, come si suol dire: soffre perché qualcuno insinua in lui il dubbio che la prima moglie non sia scomparsa in seguito alla disperazione per un suo (di Sabbath) tradimento, ma sia fuggita a sua volta con un amante perché disgustata dai suoi (di Sabbath) comportamenti.

In my opinion, this is the finest work of American fiction in the last 25 years.Mickey Sabbath goes further than any other of Roth's characters.
Each time Roth comes to an intersection in this novel, each time he has to decide whether to stop, slow down or accelerate, Roth goes faster.This novel is a work of genius, perhaps the only novel of Roth's - from one cover to another - about which that can be said.The best novels are those that entertain on multiple levels and after multiple readings.
Too much, most of the time.“He’d never lost the simple pleasure, which went way back, of making people uncomfortable, especially comfortable people.”“All I know how to do is antagonize.”Thrown out of his house finally by his drunken wife Roseanna, disgraced by audiotaped phone calls revealing a relationship (at 60) with his 20 year old student, Kathy, Sabbath is a train wreck of a man, unemployed, and angry at the world, but knows he has no one to blame but himself.
Solemnly, recklessly, blissfully serious.” Roth (RIP 1933-2018) has said that Sabbath's Theater is his favorite book, the one he had the most fun writing.
Δεν μπορεί να πατήσει πάνω σε κοινές αναφορές και ιστορίες, που μπορούν να συνδέσουν τα γεγονότα αυτά και τους ήρωες σε μια αφήγηση, εν συγκρίσει με το βαρύ πολυεπίπεδο παρελθόν και την τεράστια ιστορία των λαών της Ευρώπης που μπορείς να διαβάσεις ανάμεσα στις γραμμές.
Το αμερικανικό μυθιστόρημα είναι ένα ιδανικό αφήγημα αλλά, με ελάχιστες εξαιρέσεις, ένα βιβλίο που συνήθως καταλήγει στο ράφι με την υποψια ότι και χωρίς αυτό, η πολιτιστική σου εικόνα, γνώση και ταυτότητα δεν θα έχαναν κάτι...
(I still think this labeling applied to anyone is absurd.) I get what all the fuss is about.Or how about that recent incident where Roth told a young writer to quit, because the writing life is hell?
Roth writes better about the heart of man than any other author I’ve ever read.
I’ve got nothing on him.In short, Roth exposes the heart of human darkness in breathtaking candor, and you might want to read it.
What I do think, however, is that it’s valid for Roth to suggest that the writing life is brutal.
This is Roth's masterpiece and one of the best books I have read, morbidly funny, disturbing ,and at times deeply touching, Mickey Sabbath is one hell of a creation and has the behaviour of a complete perverted lunatic one minute and a caring, tender and quite sad person the next.
Told in flashback sequences and the present day, mainly focusing on his troubled relationship with both wife and mistress, with moments from his days as a puppeteer in New York.
The balance between the comic and the tender is spot on, Roth pulls it off so well.
Moments in the last third of reading were really heart rendering.
Part of my issue with it, I think, is that Roth hasn't really worried about form or plot in ages---his novels unfold now as dramatic monologues, episodic and without any real drive.
But when sex is Roth's entire subject, his basic thesis is that desire is the one thing we have to strike out against death with, and that point gets a little old, especially when it's so literally demonstrated that the hero Micky decides to masturbate over the grave of his dead lover.
Non-stop, rebarbative descriptions of the sex act in a graveyard. An awful slog. For me, Roth is one of those hot or cold authors. This one left me stone cold. Hey, if you're looking for masturbatory fodder, this is your novel. I happen not to be. As an alternative I would recommended any of the following: American Pastoral, The Counterlife, The Ghost Writer, or The Human Stain. Certainly the first two here are masterpieces.
One word of warning: Philip Roth's novel Sabbath Theater is NOT for everyone.
Some people will not be able to make it past the first 20 pages before they set the book down, go take a cold shower, and watch some Disney classic.
Because Mickey Sabbath -- the novel's libidinous antihero -- is quite possibly one of the most unlikeable characters created in the fiction in the past 20 years.
While the novel's sexual perversity at times is extremely distasteful, and Roth's character is a complete misogynist -- controlling women like his puppet's in his Indecent Theater -- this novel is strikingly brilliant.
Or perhaps, as Sabbath’s Theater is concerned [amongst other things] with the descent into madness of a dirty old man, and so does of course feature old[er] people talking about and engaging in sexual acts, my reaction is the understandable, yet arrogant, shudder of a young man not ready to confront the truth of, the existence of, a healthy elderly libido."You must devote yourself to fucking the way a monk devotes himself to God. Most men have to fit fucking in around the edges of what they define as more pressing concerns: the pursuit of money, power, politics, fashion, Christ knows what it might be."The stuff that generally tends to gross readers out, or offend them – Sabbath wanking over Drenka’s grave, or to a photograph of a College student while staying with her father – didn’t bother me at all; I found those parts of the novel amusing, vaudeville.
The number one complaint against anything that Philip Roth writes is his treatment of women.
I just want to put that one out there-I am not disputing that his books are not somewhat placed in a "male gaze" and that his textual treatment of women can be hard to take, but Roth is not Bret Easton Ellis's American Psycho.He has often made it his goal to depict humans no matter what group they may or may not belong to.
His other greatest criticism is that he writes badly about the Jews, to which Roth replies, "Well, can't Jews be bad too?" His treatment of both Jews and women have a few important parallels.
Sabbath's Theater is a cauldron of literary mimicry and allusion, mixed with a healthy dose of sexual perversion.
This owes not so much to a difference between the characters, but in the fact that Updike is not as adept as Roth in making us feel for Rabbit.
For readers who who want to preapre themselves for Sabbath's Theater, I would recommend reading the Rabbit books, and perhaps a mix of early Roth works such as Portnoy's Complaint or My Life as a Man in order to get used to the frank sexuality and the unsavory protagonists.
Lo vediamo in questo libro trascinarsi in una parabola di autodistruzione, cominciata a 17 anni e che lo ha portato (non si sa come) fino ai 64, quando la sua amante preferita è morta per un cancro e, per un colpo di testa, ha deciso di abbandonare la moglie, tentando infine a più riprese il suicidio.La prima parte del Teatro, non c'è scampo, è pura pornografia.
Perché alla fine è la morte la grande protagonista di questo libro.Si è combattuti, nel giudicare "Il teatro di Sabbath": alla prima parte, più per il fastidio che per lo stile di Roth, non avrei dati più di tre stelle.
Ecco dunque il Sabbath “amato puttaniere, seduttore, sodomizzatore e sfruttatore di donne, distruttore della morale, corruttore della gioventù…” L’unica cosa che il cinico manipolatore Mickey Sabbath non riesce a superare è la morte del fratello maggiore Morty, abbattuto in un combattimento aereo durante il secondo conflitto mondiale, Morty il primogenito, il figlio tanto amato dai suoi genitori che ebbero la vita distrutta dal momento della notizia della sua morte, Morty il compagno di giochi, il difensore del fratellino dai soprusi dei grandi, l’esempio di moralità e di educazione, morto come un eroe.
La trama, sulla carta, è molto semplice: il protagonista Morris "Mickey" Sabbath, ex burattinaio oltre che ex direttore del Teatro degli indecenti", erotomane impenitente, ormai vecchio, solo e con le mani devastate dall'artrite, si ritrova a fare un bilancio della sua esistenza attraverso il ricordo delle persone e dei fatti che l'hanno segnata.
Resistendo alle esagerazioni e alle grottesche trovate di Sabbath, si capisce piano piano come sotto il vecchio satiro si nasconda (anche a sè stesso) un uomo che ha conosciuto troppo presto il dolore e la sofferenza per riuscire a prendere sul serio la vita, una vita costellata di errori e fallimenti non emendabili: In quanta stupidità dobbiamo calarci per giungere alla nostra meta, quali sconfinati errori bisogna saper commettere!
Dobbiamo abbandonarci ad essi visto che nel mondo nulla ha senso come fa Sabbath, o dobbiamo, mentendo a noi stessi ed agli altri, nasconderli negando la loro esistenza e proclamandoci perfetti (come fa il Newyorkese perfetto Norman Cowan?) E' la domanda di tutto il romanzo,la domanda che ci pone un personaggio schifoso ma veramente riuscitissimo.Fa invece rabbia che in un romanzo comunque scritto benissimo (anche se davvero troppo lungo) e che riesce a sviscerare un tema così centrale, il rapporto con la sessualità femminile si riduca a pura pornografia.
Al vecchio di Newark davvero non importa nulla del tema delle donne, e di come esse vivano a loro modo il rapporto con il sesso e con la morte, un modo che gli uomini non possono capire.
Sex seems to be the only thing with which Sabbath manages to cling to his life.
Though Sabbath is desperate to give his lover’s son reason enough for killing him because he prefers being murdered to suicide, the seriousness of his actions on his lover’s grave are sufficiently serious.
For sex endows life with coherence, just like religion.
But unlike in religion, the coherence is not fake.The comedy, the type of thrifty but powerful comedy which is always there in Roth’s works to make everything just a little bit more tragic, can be seen in Sabbath’s Theater too.
He spends the next several hundred pages illustrating this point, imbuing every female character with the most weak and callow and particularly female traits: little girls in grown-up bodies, guilt-ridden, sexually repressed, attached to their victimhood and speaking incessantly in therapy language, looking for a man to blame for all their self-caused suffering.
After reading Gaitskill's essay, I was able to go back to Sabbath's Theater as more of a participant, and see it as a cultural object that I could respond to and critique.
Roth has had his moment at a protagonist and a subject, and I had fun making him an antagonist and an object for a while.
In a superficial reading of the book you see main character Mickey Sabbath, a 64-year-old former puppeteer, just as a sex addict, as a pervert: he can't get enough of his mistress, the 10-year younger nymphomaniac Drenka, of Croatian descent, and even apart from that, he dreams permanently of trios, he has phone sex with young girls, he gets a kick touching the underwear of the daughter of his best friend, and so on.
A few of them should be pulled out and taught to creative writing students, because they contain all the elements of prose rhythm in the most pedestrian sort of clause.The other Roth novels I’ve re-read — most of them from the postmodernist period — did not hold up nearly as well.
This character works because he isn’t just indecisive and lost; he acts and fantasizes boldly, even at his most crude, and there is a loss at his heart that does not ennoble him, but makes him burn out more brightly.Here's what I wrote about the novel the first time I read it, when it came out in 1995:Roth finally gave up his postmodernism, after taking it beyond its logical extreme in the second half of Operation Shylock: A Confession.
Another member came up with this to help me out:If Odysseus had to rate the Sirens' song - and he was limited to the goodreads 5 star rating scale, what would he give them?
In fact, I would argue that it just makes the reviewer look like a coward; indecisive.Yet here we are.Here is the question: Did Philip Roth have to write Mickey Sabbath as depraved as he was?
But even in my total depravity, I'm not Mickey Sabbath.This isn't a review or a recommendation.
Woah...this was majorly brilliant 😳😳😳
