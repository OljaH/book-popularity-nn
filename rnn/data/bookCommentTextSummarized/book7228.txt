Either bad things will predominate or they won't; Nock has no way of determining in advance which will happen in any given case.Beyond the "Laws," there are three other major planks of Nock's philosophy.
(Gresham's Law!) As Nock describes it, it seems to be some sort of outlook on life, running something like "the only thing that matters is material gain." Of course it is difficult to point to anyone who outright states this, and so Nock can only gesture at various people who seem too materialistic for his taste, and attribute their materialism to the pernicious rise of Economism.
For Nock, in general and in this book, is very much focused on his, and thus our, times being a “rebarbarisation,” and the futility of convincing the “mass man” of anything, or of anything good arising from the “mass man”—and certainly not the triumph of good taste and good manners.In fact, Nock repeatedly explicitly states that the “mass man” is not really human, which strikes me in light of the 20th Century a most dangerous position.
This is a book of ideas that loosely relate to the life of Albert Jay Nock, a libertarian writer, man of letters and prophet of doom. A fairly private man, his memoirs were pretty barebones. He doesn't say anything about his wife and children, nor does he mention his time as an Episcopal priest. He talks about his childhood and education, growing up at the dawn of the 20th century. He talks about his publications, books he read and his opinions on war, women's liberation and politics. There wer
This is a book of ideas that loosely relate to the life of Albert Jay Nock, a libertarian writer, man of letters and prophet of doom.
He talks about his publications, books he read and his opinions on war, women's liberation and politics.
He has brutally high expectation of his reader as far as background knowledge of ideas, books and letters.
All in all, I am glad I read this book, and would recommend it to others who are interested in libertarian and conservative thought.
A powerful book. As my dad would say "This is some heavy shit, potna, you ain't ready for this bwoh. This is grown folks reading, rookie" lol. Nook deemed himself superfluous because he did couldn't accommodate his mind to the interest of the gross national product or the purposes of the nation state. A self-educated man, raised in Brooklyn and fond of dictionaries, Nook acquired the habit of reading Greek and Latin at the age of eight. His memoir is less an account of his life than it is a history of thought. A must read!!!
Circumstances may have prevented his ever setting foot there, but it remains his country.I wonder how many such men in America would know that Communism, the New Deal, Fascism, Nazism, are merely so-many trade-names for collectivist Statism, like the trade-names for tooth-pastes which are all exactly alike except for the flavouring.The idea that there is something to live for besides the production, acquisition and distribution of wealth—this idea died a slow, hard death in France.The elementary truth which was so clear to the mind of Mr. Jefferson [is] that in proportion as you give the State power to do things for you, you give it power to do things to you; and that the State invariably makes as little as it can of the one power, and as much as it can of the other.Society’s tacit assumption is that all normal persons are qualified for matrimony, and this is not so.In a spirit of sheer conscious fraud, the State will at any time offer its people “four freedoms,” or six, or any number; but it will never let them have economic freedom.
He describes the law of diminishing returns in education: "Socrates chatting with a single protagonist meant one thing, and well did he know it.
And so we have it that unorganised Christianity was one thing, while organised Christianity has consistently been another."[return][return]Regarding the popular classical works (Caesar, Homer, Virgil, Cicero), Nock felt this was the "dullest, dreariest, most unrewarding task I ever set my hand to." Instead the "scraps" used in his learning Greek and Latin taught him affairs of ordinary life and experience which made him see "men and women of antiquity ...
Economism was the only philosophy; the "whole of human life in terms of the production, acquisition and distribution of wealth." "I sometimes thought of the rich lumbermen whom I had known so well, and on the whole had rather liked.
I guess not, but if I could, this book would merit eleven!I must thank Seth for recommending this to me last year.
He was a gadfly in his day, and, Lord, could we use the likes of him today!This is hardly an autobiography in the standard sense, but, rather personal and intellectual growth in the last quarter of the 19th century.His ability at self-deprecating (without false-modesty) understatement is absolutely refreshing.This is the only book I can remember reading, and catching myself unaware with mouth agape.********************************************************************YES!
I think an annual reading of Alfred Jay's Nock Memoirs merits the same.The more I read, the more prescient I saw Nock was.
This book should be required reading before any American is permitted to vote or run for office.
At bottom it is about human nature and the mistakes of people and governments which cannot or will not see things as they are.
Being slightly uneducated, I had never heard of the guy until last year while reading Barzun's "From Dawn to Decadence." You can look him up on Wikipedia to read his biography and a list of his writings.
All I can say is the book was great and defies traditional labels familiar to those like me who grew up getting little to no education in public schools.
Superb writing and superb criticism.

A nuanced sensibility and profound critique of education, government and society. I think I understand his pessimism and intellectual isolation. A beautiful book from the most well read person I've ever encountered.I loved this book so much that I ended up talking about it for almost three hours.

Nock's memoirs are an engagingly written series of observations of life in the early 20th century that are sure to provoke much thought. I found him a bit too pessimistic about the possibility of human improvement but I agree that human improvement is largely a matter of individual initiative. I also found his discussion of religion to be almost entirely in agreement with my own views on the subject.
Very interesting book about life, philosophy, political thought and culture in the USA from 1880 to 1943. I lived my whole live in germany and it is very interesting for me to get first hand information about the history of the USA. This makes so much more sense than the story that is told in the mainstream media (that it is a pure capitalistic country). Sometimes the book is a little tedious, but overall it is a must read.
A life-changing book. Perhaps the best thing I read in 2014.
None
A little too dry for me. Interesting views on education though.
I'm reading the Kindle version.
