Like any reading sampler, there are things I really like.
But the things I don't like as much aren't that bad by themselves, they're just not to my taste.
Not that McGuffey readers are aimed at middle aged women.
But there is some beautiful stuff in here.
This gives us some decent supplementary reading, the samples are short for the low attention span, and a young mind can learn much of the world's actual significant beauty rather than dwelling on Man-created despair and politically energized ugliness like some of our modern school texts do.
For any age.
Amazing piece of educational history. As the name suggests there are many genres included and an excellent section on elocution.
Rome took 300 years to die, and much much more.
Love that the writer was a professor once a upon a time at my alma mater. Glad I'm not a student back then, some of those readings were very dry. I think the explanations at the beginning and end of each entry are the most interesting part.
