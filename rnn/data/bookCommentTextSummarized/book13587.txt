Word comes from the small colonies in distant New England that Kin and Yance Sackett's sister-in-law, Diana, has been kidnapped.
To a Sackett blood is truly thicker than water and the two frontiersmen race up the coast, crossing nearly a thousand miles of wilderness to rescue their kinsman.The two young women who were taken did not quite fit in with the strict code of the Puritans.
And why were some of the town elders reluctant to search for the young women?
The quest to recover the young women leads from the wild New England coast to distant Jamaica.
I liked Diana even better, though, and find it a relief that L'Amour's women are capable and strong in their own right.
In this book, we have a number of African-descended warriors and Kin treats them with respect right from the start, evaluating them by their actions rather than anything so trivial as skin color.
all?) Anglo-descended white men.Anyway, this bodes well for future Sackett novels and I hope the strong story continues and that Blue Mountains proves to be a rare exception.
But stepping back into a Louis L'amour book reminded me once again why I spent much of my teen years reading these books.
Yet he manages to tell such gorgeous descriptions without cluttering up the action or weighing down the book, and that is the true mastery of it.
The main girl in this book gets captured by the bad guy twice, yet she somehow manages to be dignified and strong while she's at it (and one of the times she saves herself, the other she's ready for action when the guy arrives to give aid).
Yance has married a nice young lady from the Plymouth colony up north, somewhat against those Puritans' wishes, and its through the circumstances of his wedding that the story gets started -- though the story is really Kin-Ring's.Word comes via a dying native that Yance's 12-year-old sister-in-law, Carrie, and another woman, Diana Macklin, have been kidnapped by some bad natives and Yance's in-laws aren't satisfied with their community's half-hearted efforts to get the girls back.
The Warrior’s Path by Louis L’amour was published in 1980, and L’amour is already known for his instant success from his first published book, a Western-novel called Hondo. L’amour’s style is focused on modern Western writing, and the preservation of America’s heritage and local history. The genre of this book is Western Historical. This novel is about a family living in the Carolinas before they were even settled in by the Europeans. The younger brother’s sister-in- law was kidnapped, along wit

Once they found the kidnapped girls, the four of them, along with another slave who helped the girls escape from their captors, started on their journey back to the Carolinas.
While on the journey to find the girls, Yance was joking with Kin, that he should marry Diana after they rescue her.
This book is very easy to read, and probably would not be aimed for an advanced reader.
Sackett novels are always great. Or at least all that I have read so far. This novel features Kin Sackett. He seems most like Barnabas (the patriarch of the Sackett family). I found the pace of this novel to be ideal. It moved along without stalling out or jumping ahead. Per usual, L'Amour has a magnificent way of detailing locations and characters.I'm curious which books in the future will be about him.
Great reading. I’ve read most of the Sackett’s books growing up some 40 years ago. I’ve never read this book, nor the 2 before. Fun to read and learn the who’s, how’s and why’s of the Sackett Family.
Next to the Bible and the upbringing of my parents, L'Amour is probably the strongest influence in my life for shaping my sense of justice and fair play, my desire to be strong and to stand firm in adversity, my committment to defending the innocent and the weak at any cost, and my love of the wilderness and the wild things.I highly recommend L'Amour's books to anyone, but for men and boys, I cannot think of a better author to help shape their manhood as they immerse themselves in a great story.I hope you enjoy this book as much as I did.
The Warrior's Path by Louis L'Amour is a very good book.
They are living their everyday lives when a family member of Yance's wife asks for help.
The sister of Yance's wife and another young girl have disappeared.
The Warrior's Path is the fourth book in the Sackett series.
There is nothing in this book that I find slow or unnecessary.
In all of the Louis L’amour books I have read there was never a moment that I found slow or unnecessary.
In the book Kin goes outside of his comfort zone to help these girls.
The Sackett brothers, Yance and Kin, battle through the early American frontier in search of their sister-in-law who's been kidnapped. They're forced to split forces in their search. Fortunately, they've inherited their father's survival skills.
Very good, although not the best Sackett book.
I really like this series, probably one of my favorite series of any genre.
Another Sackett down. I thought the ending dragged on a bit to long, but I still enjoyed the book.
Listening to these on tape can be really addicting. So much wisdom in here.
Kin Sackett (yes, that is his name) is a woodsman who is hunting, farming, and fighting Indians in 1600's America.
As Kin and his brother Yance (cause why not?) investigate, they discover that it's not Indians, but rather the most powerful man in the village who takes women and sells them as slaves in the West Indies.The nice thing about L'Amour's books is that you are never in the dark.
Kin took an instant dislike to Joseph and so the audience wasn't surprised when it turns out that he's running the slave ring and kidnapping women.
Sackett heroes always spend a lot of time fighting people.
Diana is strong, intelligent and knowledgeable about the woods and speaks some of the local Indian tribes language.It isn't long before Kin and Yance realize the girls have been taken by white men for slaves.
Kin decides to go to Jamaica and find one of the other girls that has gone missing and get evidence to put a stop to the slave trade in the area.As with all of Mr. L'Amour's books there is lots of action both on the sea and around the island of Jamaica.
Another (#3) in the Sackett Family series by Louis L'Amour.
His brother Kin Sackett comes to the rescue, putting himself in danger numerous times, and taking him as far as the West Indies.Several times we wondered WHY in the world Kin let the bad guys go, when killing them would obviously have been self-defense, and even Kin knew they'd just change their names and continue their evil deeds.
However, this is part of an interesting historical adventure series, beginning back in England with the boys' father, Barnabas, who escaped both government agents and other pirates on his way to the New World.
This is the third book in L'Amour's Sackett series that chronicles a fictional family over time as they spread out and help to colonize America's frontier.
This is a western style story by a western author, but set in the past amongst the early colonies on the east coast.
The story is told from the point of view of Kin-Ring Sackett and also features his brother Yance.
This begins a journey up and down the east coast of early America and also to Port Royal to recover the missing girls.
I have this one as a western but it is really more adventure I guess.
Anyway, I consider Louis L'Amour a western writer.
I found this wonderful book at our local library, not knowing that it is one of a series set in early America ca.
There are two earlier ones; Sackett's Land 1600 and To the Far Blue Mountains 1600 - 1620; and many later ones in this series.
I like all of his books but now I have to find the rest of this series.
The Warrior's Path continues the narrative told in To The Far Blue Mountains through the eyes of Barnabas Sackett's eldest, Kin Ring.
Kin and his brother Yance receive word that friends of Yance's wife's family have been taking prisoner and thus leave Shooting Creek to help.
The story finds the brothers fighting slave traders of the worst sort, then Kin heading to Jamaica for further investigation.
Once again, L'Amour tells a vivid tale of the Sackett pioneer days, even if it is not as well told as the first two books of the series.
When Yance Sackett's sister-in-law is kidnapped, Yance and his brother Kin race north from Carolina to find her. They arrive at a superstitious town rife with rumors  and learn that someone very powerful was behind Diana's disappearance.To bring the culprit to justice, one brother must sail to the exotic West Indies.

Unlike the first two Sackett books, I listened to this one on audio book while taking a long trip.
And also unlike the other two, I loved this one!
Kin Ring is almost more heroic than his father, traveling to Port Royal to stop a man from keeping up his slave trade.
He is part pirate, part cowboy, part hero, and part savage.
Many of L'Amour's books throw in random conflicts near the end, and this definitely fits in that category.
As I write this, I'm listening to "Jubal Sackett" and it is not as interesting....oh well, there's still time to change my mind!
I think I'll give this series one more book before I'm done with it. This one just wasn't nearly as interesting or fun as other two I've read. The main character was never really developed into someone I cared about. The narrative became repetitive, often telling the exact same recounted story as earlier chapters (I miss mom. Did I mention she's in England with my sister? Yes, we get it) Not terrible, but far from my favorite.
I loved this third book in the Sackett series. The characters were great and the plot was tight. I particularly enjoyed the "excursion" that Kin took to Port Royal in Jamaica. The villains were real and hard and well, good triumphs at the end but it was a close-run thing. I love the descriptions of early settlements in the Americas too. A great book by a fine storyteller.
Early SackettsI love the Sackett stories, but this one was so so. For one, there were characters who just disappeared and I never learned what happened to them. Also, there seemed to be too many shortcuts. With that said, I still enjoyed the quick read and it pulled me into dreamland for a short time.
History mixed with suspenseAnother great book by Louis L'Amour! The amount of history that L'Amour includes in the book is fascinating and truly gives you a better understanding of the time period of the story - white slavery, pirates, Indians, and the vast emptiness of undeveloped wilderness. The story line is captivating and keeps one constantly engaged.
This was a weird one, so weird I wonder if someone helped him write it. Set in 1630, Kin Sackett travels from Carolina to Cape Anne to the Caribbean and meets pirates, and L'Amour takes a paragraph to describe his clothes. That never happens. Maybe he was experimenting. Anyway, a lot of travel over country not normally associated with the wild West.
A very insightful look into the possible thoughts an motives of the early settlers.I found Mr. L'Amour perspective on the culture and character of the Indians very interesting. This book is a thrilling read.
Great book, another enjoyable westernThis is a great western that goes from rescue to mystery. I really enjoyed it and think the Sacketts Series is a wonderful narrative of American history.
Much better than the previous book, To the Far Blue Mountains. This story about Ken has twists and turns that you don't see coming and is much harder to put down. Glad I did not stop on the previous book.
