9: The Law of the opposite: If you’re shooting for second place, your strategy is determined by the leader.
11: The Law of perspective: Marketing effects take place over an extended period of time.
14: The Law of Attributes: For every attribute, there is an opposite, effective attribute.
16: The Law of singularity: In each situation, only one move will produce substantial results.
17: The Law of unpredictability: Unless you write your competitors’ plans, you can’t predict the future.
20: The Law of hype: The situation is often the opposite of the way it appears in the press.
Marketing is a manipulation of those perceptions.Reading some books is like learning a new language, you understand things you didn't before and you see things, you didn't see before "the 22 immutable laws of marketing" is definitely one of them.
But prospects have an open mind when it comes to categories.For instance, IBM was first in computers, DEC established itself as first, in minicomputers...The law of the mindIt's better to be first in the mind than to be first in the market place.
They kind of file you away in their minds as a certain kind of person.The law of perception This is one of my favorites:It’s an illusion.
For example, they talk at length about the "Law of Extension", and how successful brands should never extend their product line to new products/markets, but in later chapters, you see a few successful examples of companies doing exactly that.
For example, the book talks about IBM being wildly profitable while they focused on one business line and then barely surviving after starting to work on multiple business lines.
As always, I saved a few of my favorite quotes from the book:"The basic issue of marketing is creating a category you can be first in.""Marketing is a battle of perceptions, not products." "Don't try to be better.
The core of the 22 laws is Identity.The authors argue that too many businesses believe they will win simply by having the best product, which isn't true.
Win the minds of the people.If you are second or worse in a category, acknowledge this.
Avis Rent-a-Car did this by admitting, "We're second place - but we try harder."Or, win a new word in the minds of your customers.
Ragu pasta sauce did this by winning the word "thicker," which differentiates them from the market leader, Prego.A very good book for understanding basic principles of how marketing needs to go beyond simply saying why your product is the best.
The usual business book....They violated their title in the first chapter...
کتاب کوتاه و بسیار حاوی نکات مهمی است. مخصوصاً تا سر قانون The Law of sacrificeکه عالیه، حتماً این کتاب را همه باید بخوانندقوانین کاملاً درست هستند، اگر کتاب 400 صفحه بود می شد یک کتاب رابرت گرینیتامل نکنید و کتاب را بخوانید تا از قوانین سرپیچی نکنید---------------------نکته ی جالب این کتاب اینه که نویسنده به شدت از دونالد ترامپ انتقاد میکنه:))))
I read this book because another business author I like recommended it and because I am currently writing a class on marketing and wanted to use it for research.I hated it.I want to be careful here.
When writing a review for a book I don't like I want to keep in mind that I am talking about something that people created.
I do NOT want to write anything that I would not say to the authors' faces if they were standing right in front of me.
Энэ бол, миний бодлоор, гайхамшиг. Бизнесийн алтан дүрэм гэдэг номтой дүйцэхүйц чамбай бүтээл болж чадсан.
I love this book. The laws are still applicable and will be applicable 25 years from now.
Dated but very interesting and thought-provoking.


The 22 Immutable Laws of Marketing is a great book.
It's very small and easy to read.
The chapters start with words of wisdom.
Some of them are counter intuitive and makes complete sense.
Few Quotes that I liked.
Hype is hype.
Real revolutions don’t arrive at high noon with marching bands and coverage on the 6 p.m. news.
Real revolutions arrive unannounced in the middle of the night and kind of speak up on you.
Capturing the imagination of the public is not the same as revolutionizing a market.
Unless you write your competitor’s plans, you can’t predict the future.
في الطبيعه تحكمنا بعض القوانين ، و أيضاً في علم التسويق هناك بعض من القوانين التى تمثل مسار واضح لمن
I realize this book was written in the early 90's but some of the things he mentioned have been proved wrong many times.
Also, he mentioned that products always sneak up on you at night and catch on in the back of the paper but never on the front page, but that's not really true all of the time (look at the unveiling of any Apple product or more recently Tesla).He also really puts down the startup and entrepreneurial spirit by saying the only way to get an idea off the ground is to find a business to sponsor you / buy the idea.
Ví dụ: IBM đứng đầu lĩnh vực máy tính, còn DEC đứng đầu trong lĩnh vực máy tính mini.Tức là sản phẩm "mới lạ" sẽ dễ vào đầu khách hàng hơn là "sản phẩm tốt hơn" trong cái chủng loại đó.Cảm giác quy luật này được suy ra từ quy luật tiên phong3.
Còn ghi nhớ nói rằng: quan trọng hơn là ông phải được NHỚ ra đầu tiên trong não của khách hàng.
dần dần chết yểu và quay lại duy nhất cocaQuan niệm cũ nói rằng mở rộng sẽ có được lượng khách hàng thêm tăng doanh thu, nhưng quy luật mở rộng thì ngược lại, mở rộng thường dẫn đến sụp đỗ.
من الكتب المميزة في هذا المجال، يقدم خلاصة جيدة لكل من يرغب في دخول عالم التسويق.
I think the biggest takeaways for me from Al Ries and Jack Trout are that 1) you should always strive to be #1 in your category in peoples' minds 2) if you're not #1, differentiate yourself completely from the #1 and occupy your niche 3) be cautious about moving into other categories of mindshare at the risk of losing hold of your currently dominated category.The key assumption I think made in this book that I'm confident has changed is the way that people learn about products.
In the world of the 90's, people learned about products through TV, print, and other forms of media where they would then have to go into a store and make a cognitive decision to purchase the product.
I found this book practical and interesting, except for the last law where authors stressed the importance of money in Marketing, I mean, what happened with new wave of startups recently proved that money doesn't matter that much in marketing.However, I again believe that this is a MUST-READ book for those who want to step in the market, either they use these rules or not
For a beginner in the marketing field, I feel so lucky to start with this book.
Some really good points made, but packed full with hindsight biases.
😍
Este libro es sensacional, sin duda una herramienta para cualquier profesión, empresa y corporación.
Es un libro compacto, fácil de leer y abarrotado con una filosofía sobresaliente.
Los escenarios que presentan hacen que el marketing convencional sea OBSOLETO.Partes de este libro son tan brillantes y densas que me encontré leyendo ciertos párrafos varias veces para captar realmente los conceptos.
Me han recomendado varios libros del autor, tengo entendido que TODOS son excelente y brindan un conocimiento necesario para el crecimiento.
Aunque este libro cumple mas de 30 años, todavía estas leyes siguen prediciendo el camino de muchas empresas hoy en día.Pienso utilizar este libro como referencia futura para cada uno de mis proyectos.
A very short book on marketing principles with a few examples. The authors need to consult their thesaurus, their laws presented are not laws nor are they immutable. This book could push to 5 stars if they put more data behind their claims. Here are my favorite principles presented: Leadership: Be first, not betterCategory: Make a new category if you do not fit in existing categories. Perception: Marketing is a battle of perceptions, not products.Duality: Every market is a two-horse race. Success: Success leads to arrogance and then failure. Acceleration: Successful programs are built on trends.
Pretty good, it was a fast listen. Prioritized is because Tim Ferriss pumped it way back.A lot of the examples were dated but that was actually kind of nice because, especially in the case of "line extension", you could actually add to their examples which only compounded the the point/law.
It's 22 steps of mind bending. The instances of real case scenarios is very well explained and would surprise the general perception of the reader.
It has some outdated information and others things didn't come true, but overall the book is solid. It gives you great insides how to approach marketing. One thing is that it says that is hard or impossible to predict the future, but the book does try that in a few occasions.
9: The Law of the opposite: If you’re shooting for second place, your strategy is determined by the leader.
11: The Law of perspective: Marketing effects take place over an extended period of time.
14: The Law of Attributes: For every attribute, there is an opposite, effective attribute.
16: The Law of singularity: In each situation, only one move will produce substantial results.
17: The Law of unpredictability: Unless you write your competitors’ plans, you can’t predict the future.
20: The Law of hype: The situation is often the opposite of the way it appears in the press.
На 4-й книге Траута с Райсом понял, что все это уже слышал, а одними кейсами IBM и Xerox сыт не будешь
