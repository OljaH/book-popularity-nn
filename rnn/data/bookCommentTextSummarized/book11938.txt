One of the oddest Nancy Drew books that you will ever read, but it still maintains its standard of excellence.
The Hardy Boys and Nancy Drew are the first series that I remember reading. I was still in elementary school, but I remember thinking I was reading more grown up books because these were long (more than 20 pages, lol) and there was more than one book you could read with the same main characters! The innocence of these mysteries and recalling my own innocence just makes me happy. All parents should give their kids Hardy Boys and Nancy Drew when they're young - only good things can come of it.
And what's with calling an electrician to re-head the decapitated robot?
And why does Nancy buy the story of the final whereabouts of Thomas Banister which seem transparently fishy when she was so skeptical of Mead and his charity for the Native American children when that turned out to be a well-executed scam?
And why did Banister leave all the money in the house if he was going on the lamb?
And how do we know that there weren't really only 2 Banister siblings and the other brother and Thomas are really just the same person with the sister in on the scam.
Exciting and fun, as usual.
I always find this an enjoyable book to read, whether I am 15, 35 or...uh, er...whatever!
The strange house, strange notes, strange robot, strange antagonist are fun.
Nancy, her chums, their special friends, her father, their clients--the gang's all here!--sleuthing at the crooked house is satisfying.
Carson and Nancy's quick flight to Arizona, horse ride across the desert and Nancy's feat of bravery there...well, you have to have a little travel thrown in these later books, and when you are as wealthy as the Drews and billing your clients, why not?!
The cover is one of the oddest thing about the book!
This one felt more gutted than the others. Did the original 1920's version contain a robot? Interesting villain, but never fleshed out.
However I didnt expect it to be this bad.After reading this book what I observed was that the authors of the Nancy Drew were stuck with a challenge to continue the Nancy Drew series with the same charm of the originals but to also think and add new plots in order to avoid repetitions and monotony.
There confusion is plainly depicted in this book.The book is written in 1971 and I am reading it in 2018 so I must be bit lenient in scrutanizing the robotic stuff added to the book.
one of the less interesting books because you know who the crooks are immediately. not only that but the character development is lacking. plus people are either very good or very bad in this book. meh. but my niece will enjoy it.
Two stars for an abrupt, lackluster ending in which the antagonist was not captured.
One of my all-time favourite Nancy Drew mysteries, this one features a wacky robot in a very wacky house. I loved following Nancy and her friends as she solved this mystery.
This was one of the stories I remember reading. Very odd, but another good one!
The Crooked Banister  is a children's story by Carolyn Keene (pseudonym) and the 48th book in the  Nancy Drew  series. Nancy and her friends spend an exciting week exploring a mysterious zigzag house with its fantastically crooked staircase, its bizarre serpent picture, and an unpredictable robot that nearly causes the young detective to lose her life.

Nancy and her friends spend an exciting week exploring a mysterious zigzag house with its fantastically crooked staircase, its bizarre serpent picture, and an unpredictable robot that nearly causes the young detective to lose her life.
But despite the threat of danger from the robot, Nancy is determined to solve the mystery of the weird house and to locate the missing owner, who is wanted by the police.
Even though I haven’t re-read any of these books since I was a child, I still think that Nancy is a great character—her courage, confidence and fierce independence, makes her an iconic source of inspiration for young girls everywhere.
A must-read children's book, 
So full disclosure: I only read this book because a nice lady on Esty makes awesome kindle covers made from old Nancy Drew hardcovers, and this was one that was available that looked good to me (see my profile picture for a look at it in action!) I figured I would read the actual book since I carry the cover around with me all the time :).
Wow. I have a feeling that this one was a weird Nancy Drew, since the main aggressor in this book was actually a robot, but still.
The main jist: a guy named Rawley Banister (the 'Crooked Banister') is swindling people out of money, and Nancy Drew has to go into is weird house to find out where he is.
I fully admit that I picked this Nancy Drew up based on the amazing cover -- pink, robots, more pink, I mean really, what else could I ask for?
The plot moves at a bizarrely slow pace, and there are some major clues at the beginning that Nancy inexplicably (and infuriatingly) doesn't pick up on.
That said, there are a few elements that are so striking that I was amazed to find I remembered them from when I first read this book -- more than 20 years ago.
No no, please take that to mean I was reading chapter books when I was very young (which is probably the more accurate interpretation anyway).
I recently decided to reread a book from one of my favorite series from when I was a kid, and the rating is based on how much I enjoyed it when I was about 9 years old.
The Native Americans on the reservations spoke like they were from another country, and this along with the other stereotypes lessened the quality of this reading.
Between the ages of eight and twelve, I read most of the book from the Nancy Drew collection, and am still a mystery lover to this day.
The series did a pretty good job of drawing in young readers, and that's a definite plus.
Criticising Nancy Drew is like criticising your own grandmother, seriously ;) I thought the Zigzag house was kinda cool, but it was confusing at times with the complex contraptions (that bookcase thing blew my mind - what the heck was going on there?). The ending was a tiny bit rushed and the mystery was solved by someone childishly sliding down a banister. Like, what? And Nancy gets credit for that? (Also, I thought when they were talking about Indian reservations, they meant INDIAN INDIAN reservations, not American Indians, and it totally confused me. LOL.)
The book "The Crooked Banister" was definitely an intriguing mystery and a good read! Carolyn Keene has written many mysteries, and so far, out of all of them I have read, this is my favorite. This book is about a case that Nancy solves with her friends Beth and George in an odd house. Her journey involves a crooked banister, a robbery, some poison, snakes, portraits, and flaming bridges. I think that Carolyn Keene did a great job making this a very mysterious story, and is one of my favorite mysteries.
I remember the first time I read Nancy Drew. It blew my mind that there were girls presented with a brain. Most of the stuff I'd read up to that time, was that girls were sugar and spice - fluffy. No brains. To also learn about George who is a tomboy was a nice validation. Carolyn Keene wrote just for me! That is how I felt. When I did more research, I was shocked to find out, Ms. Keene was actually a man ... writing under Frank Dixon. I also loved the Hardy Boys. No wonder I loved these series.
#48 out 56 Nancy Drew mysteries, this one comes quite close to the end of the series, with the relationships well developed, and the three boyfriends firmly ensconced in their roles. This is a pretty unbelievable tale and all the better for it. Loved the fakey pictures of Robby the Robot, and all the crazy drama of a burning moat and crooked banister. Can't get more contrived than this tale and that's why I read these books. They make me laugh and also give me insight into the time-period.
My mom and I used to read theses books together when i was younger and we thought that we had read them all... Apparently we hadn't so when i saw this book at my library and picked it up just for fun. This book was pretty interesting and I think it is funny how Nancy Drew was my idol when all i wanted to do was be a detective. All in all it was a sweet book that had some interesting character names.
Nancy tracks down a swindler surnamed Banister.Pro tip: if the bad guy's robot breaks, don't fix it. (Actually if you want to solve the mystery, you must.)An electrician loses consciousness when the robot he just fixed chokes him. Nancy loses consciousness in the same manner.This is the only Nancy Drew book I've read so far where the primary crook dies instead of faces justice. Unfortunately it happens off-camera, as it were.
Nancy is pulled into this mystery when a couplecomes to her dad because they've been swindled in a land deal. This leads them to Rawley Banister who always called himself the "crooked Banister" because he was the family's bad egg. He built a house that is all angles and has a wacky robot that runs around attacking people.
Ridiculous twaddle, written with all the grace and charm of an interoffice memo. With this kind of young adult literature, the marvel is that any of us ever learned to read. I like the cover, though.
readdressing the role of young girls in the 1950;s
What can I say. I enjoy the stories. Easy, fast reads with large print that are good when you are stressed or pulling an overnight. They keep your attention with their fast pace and are a lot of fun.
Nancy solves another one!
My Rating System:* couldn't finish, ** wouldn't recommend, *** would recommend, **** would read again, ***** have read again.
I enjoyed this book, it was very mysterious! Hope you read this book soon!
5 stars so really good i really love this series
This one did nothing for me. I found it boring and confusing. It took me two months to finish it because I just didn't care enough to put it ahead of other things.
