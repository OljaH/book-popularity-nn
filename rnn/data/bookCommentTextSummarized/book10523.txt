The fact that it is so accessible with very little filler or unnecessary flowery-ness is a plus for me.When deciding whether or not to read this book, you must think about how you feel about stories that conjecture about the afterlife.
If that is a touchy subject for you or you are uncomfortable reading about possibilities outside of your beliefs, this is not the book for you.
However, if you enjoy exploring possibilities, like to see what someone else speculates, or are fascinated with the "what ifs" and the "maybes", then this is a very good book worth checking out.Warning: this could be a very difficult book for someone who has recently experienced a loss.
But then he gets beamed up to a place they call Summerland, some call it Heaven (but its correct name is The Third Sphere), and wakes up in the prettiest of all country parks and meets his old dog who had died but now bounds up wagging its tail.
Heaven has countries just like Earth!
Life in Heaven is real nice but a little bit too much like Stepford Wives.
But it’s nice to know that my severe negativity towards the concept of the afterlife will not prevent me from popping up in Summerland when the time comes.
I never know whether I would have thought of the interpretation on my own without the thought having been planted, for instance, and therefore I feel as if I have been cheated out of the full experience of reading, absorbing and pondering the book.
I don't think that there is anything in this book that would physically harm anyone, and I do think that everyone should be exposed to ideas from all different walks of life, not just their own belief system, so I don't mean "irresponsible" in that way.
It's kind of comforting, right?Matheson's book is similar to this, but different in a few major ways.
As hard as I tried to make myself care about this book and its characters, I just could not.First of all, it is very tedious, with too much exposition and endless infodumps in the dialogue form.
In this book, Matheson for the most part tells instead of showing, which makes it hard for me to enjoy the story.
The characters are poorly fleshed out, and the relationships between them are one-dimensional.The afterlife world that could have had such potential to be exciting and fantastical is filled instead with arbitrary rules and regulations, and seems like a rather dry, boring, and bureaucratic place.
Also a film starring Robin Williams, this spectacular portrayal of life, death and interconnection is still as timely as ever, a classic tale that any reader can find meaning in.
If you feel compelled: Robin Williams/ I miss you/ Man of the World/ comedian/ and hero-/ your laughter died/ with you-/ But I remember Dr. Seuss-/ a beautiful man/ like you/ who told us/ to be happy/ because you came/ and don't cry/ because you left.
Matheson writes a reflection of a beautiful soul with an enormous heart, and a genius.Chris, the main character meets his dog in heaven.
I pray he'll be with us forever in heaven, like Chris's dog in the story.
I was probably not in the right mood for this book, it tired me, it was a bit verbose, a bit too dark, a bit repetitive... Still, the last few sentences made it worth reading the whole thing.
I picked this one up after I finished Barbara Gowdy's stories mainly because it was short and I wanted something quick to read and Hannibal wasn't being released for another couple of days.
The end productmakes so much sense and seems entirely believable.The story is about a man's journey beyond death to rejoin his wife.
Now, I'm hesitant to admit that this novel has changed my life, or absolutely convinced me oflife after death, but it has inspired much hope.
It really makes sense, and I challenge anyone to read it and not be affected by it.
What I can also say is that every religion is viewed upon on equal grounds and I think that the way the afterlife is represented is brilliant and thought-provoking in how I can certainly guarantee that one will be thinking about this novel beyond the text and how it can ignite really deep discussions.This book did an excellent job stirring up the discussion of death and what happens beyond it and while one may be looking for answers within this text, what this book does is present some really interesting thoughts, but yet you are left thinking even more beyond the text.
Lesson learned: action is a better means of communication to the reader than straight dialogue.I don't have a problem reading a book like this and suspending my own beliefs and knowledge in order to enjoy a fictional story based on the author's thoughts and insights, but I do have a problem when the author is pompous enough to think his limited methods of research have made him some sort of enlightened priest, and isn't creative enough to drive a story along during almost half of the book.
In What Dreams May Come, he weaves a tale which includes everlasting love along with psychological terrors including life and death.
****MINOR SPOILER**** I was particularly amazed by the part where the protagonist meets his wife in her personal Hell after having committed suicide and finds her stuck in a twisted version of their home, tormented by her guilts and refusing to believe that he is her husband and that she doesn't have to stay there if only she wills it enough.****END OF SPOILER**** I don't know about afterlife, but this is certainly something very true in real life.
Wonderful.......I was entrance by this book.A great book.....Matheson at is best!!!!Powerful written, with insight and guts.....I recommend it to everyone who feels eternity in his heart!!!!Dean:)
In addition, Matheson adds a bibliography of all the books he read before writing this work.What most find memorable and touching about the story, which is the story of the way people who love each other strongly cope with life after death, what I found more clever was the way that Matheson wove so many theories on the afterlife together to paint a harmonious picture of what life after death could be for one person as he adjusts to what has become of his spirit after his death.While this book should appeal very much to the romantic at heart, I also see the appeal to anyone interested in a fiction based on a depth of research into the afterlife phenomenon and also it should appeal to anyone who has questioned what the possibilities are in the afterlife.
This book was VERY different from the movie, though much of it was very similar.
The book shies away from the idea of a "God", where as the movie has very heavy theological tones and even goes so far as to state that there is a God. I can't really say which one I liked better.
I feel like the movie was was so...
The book is a far more intellectual endeavor, no doubt aided by the hefty reference material in the bibliography.
I do recommend this book, especially to fans of Matheson's other work.
The story is exciting, especially in the beginning, and has some gorgeous imagery (I love the "delicate purl of surf" Chris notices on the shore of the lake in Summerland).
The story grows more tedious as it progresses and is so didactic that it gets boring and seems to go on for....well...yep, an eternity.
I was completely disgusted when I finally got to the climax, his 3-page speech to Ann, full of sexist crap like this: "Thank you for keeping my clothes clean, our homes clean, yourself clean." Ugh. Really?!?
Wash your own clothes, you lazy bastard!
Richard Matheson is either a literary GENIOUS or this is the book EVERYONE has been waiting to read,yet may not know it.
A remarkable book which was meant for me to read.
It has reinstated my faith in the afterlife, helped in understanding of certain elements of what I believe to be involved with the process of the afterlife, as well as incorporated so many religious philosophies such as christianity,buddism,reincarnation and karma- all into the one beautiful manifestation of entering into life after death.It also has inspired me to research this book more so and look into certain faith based reading.Amazing.A billion Stars :)
It opened my mind completely to new ideas about life after death; I have also determined to gather and read the entire contents of the bibliography Matheson provided that includes all of his research used to provide the details within the novel.
Matheson reshapes the entire definition of the phrase "love story"; I daresay he creates a story to contest even Shakespeare's famed star-crossed lovers, for, not only is Chris unable to live without Ann, he is discontent even in HEAVEN without her.
So let me end by saying that I think this is a book that everyone should read at least once, because it could just change your life as it changed mine.
His running mantra throughout is that it is all in the mind...what we think, whether dead or alive, makes a difference to our lives and our deaths.But, this was also a love story...It was a sweet love story happening on the planes of perceived heavens and hells.
It was the first love story I have read in a long time that didn't make me roll my eyes.This book was one part information about ideas of the afterlife, one part love story and one part cautionary tale about how you think and behave in the world.
For once, the movie was much better than the book!
Ben cenneti daha seksi bi yer olarak düşünmüştüm hep.
Ben isterim ki eğer okuduğum kitap bir aşk romanıysa yazar sürekli partnerini sevdiğinden bahsetmesin.
Aşk sadece lafta olmamalı "Ben karımı seviyorum" deyip bırakılmamalı.
Tamam burda bir erkek var karısı için cennetten ceheneme kaçan, ama karını çok seviyorsun neden sevdiğini, ona bu kadar bağlı olman için karının sana ne gibi fedakarlıklar yaptığını da bilmek isterim ben.
Karımı seviyorum...Abi kusura bakma 50 kere bu lafı okuyunca insan merak ediyor bu kadın naptı da bu kadar seviliyor.
Be canım benim kusura bakma ama ben senin karın olsaydım, sen cennette olsaydın inan sırf senden kaçmak için cehennemin dibine yerleşirdim.
The most upsetting (and I suppose liberating to some) idea presented is that we, as human beings, are destined to create our own heavens and hells simply by our mental patterns.
It struck me, as a trained social worker, that it is distinctly unfair that the mentally ill who suffer throughout an entire life time with depression/self-doubt/schizophrenia/etc.
I think I need a book club to discuss this one.
Honestly though - those could come from simply watching the movie, which I think is the better use of time.
After losing my Dad I thought reading, in detail, about a man dying in a hospital, leaving his devastated family behind, and slowly moving into the afterlife would be difficult for me process.
I should have probably read it around the 3rd or 4th month of losing my Dad. As someone terrified of death, hyper-aware of the mortality of myself and loved ones, and with nearly no religious association or formal belief system, this book was exactly what I needed.
There was no hiding from the similarities between my Dad's death and Chris's in What Dreams May Come.
The novel is Matheson's attempt to look at what happens to us after death and while it's interesting, I never felt like it necessarily connected with me in the same way that other Matheson novels and short stories have.Driving home, Chris Nielsen is killed in a car accident.
And while Matheson attempts to set up the romance and deep love that Chris and Ann share, it never quite becomes as transcendent as the novel requires.
I found myself growing frustrated with the novel at points because, as I said before, Matheson has given us stories focusing on "love that transcends the bounds of time and space" before in Somewhere in Time.
However for me, the book wasn't better than the movie.
I really wanted it to be, but I found the book cerebral, while the movie was quite emotional.
I do believe we're responsible for what we do with those thoughts, but religious attitudes/overly zealous new-age attitudes that condemn and shame us for feeling natural healthy responses like anger don't serve.
My thoughts.The movie edited out the preachy factor.
We watched the movie again, right after I finished the book.
I think we have to thank Annabella Sciorra and the cinematographer for a movie that everyone and anyone who's ever lost someone they dearly loved should watch.A little more of my experience reading the book...http://heidigwrites.blogspot.com/2013...
I really liked Somewhere in Time (originally published under another title) by Matheson, so despite disliking the video of this movie, I was looking forward to reading it.
I was disappointed.The cover of the book proclaims "After life there is more...The end is just the beginning", a sentiment I firmly believe.
But I was sorely disappointed in this book.
However, I remembered I didn't like the beginning of that other novel of Matheson's, which I ended up really liking, so kept plugging along.
Maybe it's because I read the Narnia books and fell in love with them before I found a more traditional outlet for my faith.

Zanimljivo...
The story comes off as a strong examination of said issues (on several levels) -- almost as a thought experiment -- and I wouldn't be surprised that this is there case exactly because the author believed in the essence of the story.
That, to me, is a strength, not a weakness.(view spoiler)[The love and loyalty that the protagonist has for his wife even after he, unfortunately, dies in a car accident, feels "real", very credible.
And it doesn't matter if you believe in it as "real life material" or not.
I love the movie but obviously this is a different experience.
По-друге, це один із дуже небагатьох романів, у якому є список використаної літератури.
І то доволі солідний список:) Він - для тих, хто захоче пізнати тему життя-після-смерті глибше.
Хоча мене він не зацікавив - версія потойбіччя, написана самим Метисоном, мене цілком влаштовує)) Разом з тим, приємно усвідомлювати, що, конструюючи її, автор спирався на досвід/свідчення реальних людей.
Вірити їм чи ні - то вже інше питання)По-третє, роман дуже світлий.
Так,в оповіді є і темні, дуже темні сторінки.
Але він дарує надію.
Але є люди, для яких це важливо.
Але багатьох це надихне.Загалом я для себе чіткіше окресила, в яке потойбіччя я хочу вірити.
What a supremely stirring--and strange--story...Imagine that someone decided to research the most intricately detailed depictions of the afterlife from several religions, merged these ideas together into a cohesive whole, and wrote a tale about a man and his unbreakable love for his wife set in a fantastical setting utilizing said research.
Rather than leave everything to the reader's imagination, Matheson spends a great deal of time explaining the metaphysical properties of the Summerland and the spiritual spheres of reality--how humans have multiple physical and spiritual forms; how those forms interact with their surroundings; how those surroundings affect us; and so on.
