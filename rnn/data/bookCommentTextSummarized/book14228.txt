A bit long-winded and due to textual density and length thus more suitable for older children, Saint George and the Dragon gracefully and glowingly presents a tenderly descriptive and evocative old fashioned folktale type legend (and more than well deserving of the Caldecott Medal it won, as the illustrations are truly in all ways breathtaking).
Now that all being said, and as much as I truly enjoyed this retelling, I most definitely would have appreciated a bit more detailed background information than simply being told that Saint George and the Dragon is an adaptation of Spenser's The Faerie Queene.
Another lovely book for my art collection, this one with a tale of dragonslaying, chivalric adventure, true knights, epic duels, and the gorgeous art of Trina Schart Hyman. What other reasons would I need to give this the highest rating? The art alone is worth it!
This book is a really good adventure story, and it had great details.
I like when he fights the dragon.
I loved the metaphorical depictions of the princess riding on the donkey as Jesus once did on Palm Friday and how she is also carrying her lamb which represents Jesus Christ as the sacrificial lamb.
The water with healing properties is like the living waters/springs that represents the blood of Christ and the truth of his word.
The healing apple is like the fruit of life from the garden of Eden.
Both the water and apple represent eternal life.
In this retelling of a segment from Spenser's Faerie Queen, Saint George, the Red Cross Knight, is guided by the lady Una to her parents' realm, where in a mighty battle he slays a dragon who has terrorized the land.
After thus proving himself, he and Una are married.Hodges' prose distills much action and color into a fairly brief text, sprinkled with quotes from the original work.
This story of heroism and love is wonderful in its own right, but it should also whet the appetite and prepare the reader for a future experience of the full poem (original text of which is here http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/6930, and audio is here http://librivox.org/the-faerie-queene...).

Meh. The illustrations are pretty--have that old feel to them.
But the story dragged for a picture book.
Too much text.
Too much description.
This is what one would get if I wrote a picture book!
I had hoped I'd see glimpses of the legend I saw portrayed in "Lark Rise." But no.
And what was up with the pretty castle in the middle?
I suppose legends often don't make sense.
But if you're going to write or re-tell a legend in our day, I think I'd like to have some of the "Huh?" gaps filled in.
Illustrated by Trina Schart HymanThis is a retelling from Edmund Spenser’s Faerie Queene, which recounts the legend of Saint George who slew the dragon which was terrorizing the country. It’s a wonderful tale of courage, dedication, and perseverance. George is pure of heart, generous of spirit, and brave beyond measure. A lovely fable.Trina Schart Hyman was awarded the Caldecott Medal for excellence in illustration. Her paintings are rich and vibrant, and full of small details that support the storytelling. After I finished reading the story, I started again at the beginning just to pore over the pictures.
Can't do much better than a story about a hero who conquers a dragon. That's the biblical narrative, after all: "Kill the dragon, get the girl." Red Cross Knight, with his shield bearing the red cross of St. George, is revealed to be St. George in Canto 10 of Spenser's Faerie Queene. The Caldecott-winning illustrations approach the sublime.I started reading this on March 23, a month before the feast of St. George on April 23. I ordered a copy.
The artwork in this little paperback book is so astonishingly lovely and vivid, I somehow ended up with two copies of this book. I'm not complaining; I will just share one copy. The text itself retells Spenser's The Faerie Queene, so that, with the artwork, makes this book pretty darn awesome for a Second Grade History class.
I looked forward to this book.However, for me the story felt awkward and poorly written.
Farmers who are working in their fields?In conclusion, I think this story could have been better told.The illustrations by Trina Schart Hyman are lovely.
I would not buy this book for the illustration quality, because the style is muddy and a bit stiff, but I liked the composition and some scenes were gorgeous.
I also enjoyed the border designs.Illustrations would get 4/5 stars, but the story is maybe 2/5.
Therefore, together this book gets 3 stars.
Excellently adapted from Spenser's "Faerie Queene", and backed by marvelous illustrations.
Half the book is taken up by the pulse-pounding action of the duel between St George and the Dragon, but neither density nor duel has kept my very girly DD (age 3) from regarding it as one of her favorites.
On the strength of this adaptation, I've read two further depictions of Spenser's Red Cross Knight Vs Dragon rewritten for children.
Neither Jeanie Lang's "Stories from the Fairie Queen" nor Sophia Maclehose's "Tales from Spenser Chosen from the Fairie Queene" handled it as well as Margaret Hodges.
Hodges and Hyman collaborated on a few other adaptations of classic literature for children.
This book is wordy! As in, it is too wordy for a bedtime story. We read it in two parts. We are Shrek-loving family (and when I say Shrek, I mean the movie, not the William Steig book) and this book doesn't do it for us.Also, this book is good for girls IF you like passive girls who watch from the sidelines while the dude slays the dragons, and then agrees to marry the dude because he is such a great dragon killer.
The story is a bit long-winded, but the illustrations are absolutely gorgeous!!! Definitely a great "old fashioned fairy tale" sort of feel but good for boys who aren't into the princess thing.
This is a GREAT book! It refers to the Bible. Jesus (Saint George) crushed Satan (the dragon's) head. Jesus saved The Church (Una), and marries her (meaning The Church). I recommend it to all!
The problem with this book is that it is just so very wordy to tell a simple tale.
The whole time I was left thinking that they should have left more room for Trina's fantastic illustrations.
Granted, I can just do a search and find a pile of stuff on Wikipedia, but, that doesn't tell me where this author found this particular tale and why she went with this particular version.
I recommend this book for older children who like knights and dragons and otherwise for fans of Trina Schart Hyman's illustrations.
I think I would have preferred that version more.
I remember my parents reading this book to me when I was young, but even more than that I remember the dragon.
This book is largely responsible for my early love of drawing and monsters and so for that I'll be forever grateful.
Having read that book in college a few years ago the depth of myth in this book assumes a real beautiful quality.
What's truly beautiful about this book however is the way it is arranged.
This is a beautiful book and I can't wait to read it to my kids...as soon as I have kids.
أدب أطفال الكتاب خفيف جدًا و لذيذ اكيد بالنسبة للأطفال ممكن يبقي جرعة أدرينالين بالنسبة لهم كمان لو خيالهم واسعرسومات الكتاب حاجة أسطورية تتخطي قوة الكتابة و قوة القصة بكتير القصة بسيطة مفيهاش اي تعقيد لكن الرسومات جميلة جدًا و واضحة و مليئة بالحياة الديزاين نفسه بتاع الصفحات جميل جدًا
the borders are, by far, the strongest part of this book.
Margret Hodges tells a story of the Red Cross Knight slaying the dragon that brings grief and heartache to the country side.
The only thing the town wanted was to live in peace and joy with their gates open to anybody who was passing by, unfortunately there was a terrifying fire-breathing dragon who prevented the town from living happily and making them live in fear.
In this story the author brings this typical fairy tale to life with detailed illustrations by Trina Schart Hyman to compliment the story line.
This book captured my childhood imagination and brought it all together in a short story.
I think that it enhances a childhood imagination with the use of the detailed illustrations and text.
1985 Caldecott Winner. Such detailed and wonderful illustrations and a great fairy tale as well.

Here's what I LOVE about this book: the illustrations!
Artist Trina Schart Hyman does a fantastic job.
But I know from personal experience that it is difficult to retell an old story without a bit of both.
My grammar-stage son...well, his comment was, "Awww...I wanted the dragon to win!" He's a big softie when it comes to critters.
I think most kids will relate to the citizen's fearful reluctance to approach the dragon, even when dead: "'Those claws might scratch my son, or tear his tender hand.'"Great way to introduce an old story to a young audience.
Fantastic illustrations.
I love the fire and fury from the dragon and the dedication of the knight.
Also, the use of the borders on the facing page shows more of the battle.
I love the details of the spike stuck into the shield and the blood from the amputated tail dripping!This is a wordy but beautiful retelling of the tale from the Faerie Queene.
I liked the way the illustrations used the borders around to either look like a window, so the viewer was looking onto the tale, or to further share details of the story or the infamous battle betweeen dragon and man.
I'm sure I read this before, but I definitely read this while I was in high school and dreaming up stories about the middle ages, because I distinctly remember drawing the dress that Una wears at the end of the book.
I loved the illustrations in this book because there was more to them the longer you looked - they were done like illuminated manuscript pages, and all along the borders there was this allegory comparing George's quest to slay the dragon with a ship sailing across the ocean.
I didn't realize until high school that this legend of Saint George was really well-known in England and kind of a founding saint for England.
This is just such a beautiful, awesome, picture book! I love Trina Schart Hyman’s illustrations… she may be my favorite artist… So much expression in the characters, and so much beauty and detail! And this story was just so cool. Actually, the look of this book very much influenced some of the feel of one of my own stories I'm writing. Which may be one of the reasons I’m so attached to this book. But it’s just… perfect. <3
I have always loved stories of chivalry and knights and dragons. Here we have all of that, well told, and beautifully illustrated. I do like that Una has the choice of marrying the hero if she loves him, for in too many fairy tales the princess is just handed off like so much baggage. Overall this is a beautiful retelling and one well worth picking up.
I'm long past the age of picture-books, but ever now and then I find myself pulling my family's well-worn copy down to flip through. Sumptuous illustrations, enthralling story. I can still hear my older sister's voice reading this to me.
Anything illustrated by Trina Schart Hyman is sure to be stunning, and Margaret Hodges is a wonderful author. The legend of St. George and the dragon is one of my favorites. This book is a winner to me! Highly recommended!
