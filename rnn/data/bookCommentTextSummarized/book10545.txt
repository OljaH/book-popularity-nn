میخوام شروع کنم به خوندن دوبارهي تنتنها.این قسمت اولین قسمتی بود که خوندم. جدا از شوخیها و طنز محشری که داره، چنتا نکتهی سیاسی خیلی جالب هم داشت که وقتی میخوندی و متوجه میشدی از اینکه انقدر ظریف ایدههاش رو لابلای داستانِ ساده جا کرده متعجب میشدی. طنزاش و ماجراهاش قشنگ یک سر و گردن از آستریکس و اوبلیکس بالاتره. با این که اون رو هم خیلی دوست دارم و برام جذابه. اما در نهایت تنتن خیلی عمیقتر و با کیفیتتر هست از لحاظ طنازی و قصهگویی و عمقِ روایت.فقط وقتی که هادوک میفهمه که چرا نمیتونه ویسکی بخوره :))

(While Tintin's ultimate desire to join his friends is in character, it feels a bit abrupt, it must be said.)The sequence where Haddock and Calculus travel to San Theodoros must be the longest without Tintin in the canon, and allows them to shine.
(Perhaps still echoing his growing interest in comedies of manners?).There are many small things to enjoy - the comedy of Tintin and Calculus failing to eat the spicy food of the Arumbayas (themselves making a pleasant return after being the focus of The Broken Ear, and General Alcazar has never been more lively than he is here.
And the penultimate page ends with an hysterical frame: Castafiore preparing to sing, and everyone she knows looking terrified.

South American Revolutions27 February 2012 This is the last of the completed Tintin books and in a way does finally tie everything up. Granted, nobody ever lives happily ever after, but I do feel that it does round off and complete what I consider to be a ground breaking series of books that are incredibly funny and very entertaining. This album seems to follow on after the Castafiore Emerald as there are a few connections with the events in the previous album, however it appears that Flight 714
South American Revolutions27 February 2012	This is the last of the completed Tintin books and in a way does finally tie everything up.
As mentioned, Bianca Castafiore, with her entourage, are traveling through Latin America and arrive at the fictional country of San Theodoros (the same country from The Broken Ear) and she and her entourage (which includes Thompson and Thomson) are arrested immediately after the concert on the grounds of participating in a conspiracy to overthrow the leader General Tapioca.
However, the story of Alcazar and San Theodoros has been sitting in the background since The Broken Ear, and it is only resolved here, at the end.
The beginnings of these stories have been around as long as the Lord of the Rings, the illustration and environments in the Tintin books are accurate and extremely detailed.
Anyone who has spent even a little time exploring Herge (Georges Remi) can see the painstaking research and adversity he worked through to compose the world around Tintin.
His ideas were ahead of his time (Exploring the moon, Industrialization, South American political conflict, modern slave trade, extraterrestrial life) and he made certain every detail for every object would be realistic (after the third book at least).
Herge's work can certainly be cited as an influence for any modern day graphic novel or comic book.
سیاسی ترین اثر هرژه در مجموعه ی تن تن که به کودتا و انقلاب در کشورهای آمریکای جنوبی می پردازد؛ نگاه هرژه از نگاه یک استعمارگرد در کتاب های اول مجموعه مانند تن تن در کونگو یا سرزمین شوراها به یک ایدالیست در این اثر تبدیل شده به گونه ای که درجایی تن تن از آلکازار میخواهد تا بعد از پیروزی انقلاب کسی را عدام نکند؛ درسته اثر از نظر کشش مانند راز اسب شاخدار یا گنجهای راکام نیست ولی مضمونی قوی تر دارد
جذاب ترین تن تن از نظر من اینه.در سرزمین پیکارگران پر از ماجرا و اتفاق و هیجان.
His rejection of some of his earlier portrayals (he is on record as categorizing "Tintin in America" as an "error of his youth") allow a reader to see this series as a product of a specific time and place--a product created by a writer who became more politically sophisticated as he gained in years and wisdom.(re) Reading this episode directly after revisiting "The Broken Ear" is a case in point.
No discussion of the differences between reigning power and rebel is considered or addressed (Tintin's reason for aiding Alcazar's cause is explicitly to rescue his friends from excecution), and that is arguably satirical commentary in itself.
As Tintin and company fly away back to the safety of white Europe, a billboard has already been erected to promote the propaganda of their 'friend' General Alcazar.
Their swinging batons are a sobering reminder that Alcazar only promised to withhold violence and reprisals while Tintin was in the country.
One warlord has been exchanged for another; the elite detective and his caucasian entourage care only in as much as it affects their reputation and self-image.
The final Tintin story (not counting the incomplete Alph-Art) goes out on something of a anti-climax.
It's not a bad story in the Tintin canon (though not one of the best, either), but somehow I wanted something more from it.
Following Alcazar's bloodless coup, Hergé leaves us with the image of Tintin's plane whisking him back to European comfort, whilst below two armed, military police officers swagger past a shanty town.
It appears not.I've enjoyed reading the Tintin books, though I'm not entirely sure why the adoration of the stories has arisen.
Herge superbly interweaves difficult topics like alcoholism (seen through Haddock's sobriety and Alcazar's men) and unsettling political unrest while vividly capturing the local spirit seen through the climatic festival.
While unfortunate, I must capture the relevant passage from Wikipedia as it is crucial: "The second to last panel shows a final political message: as under Tapioca, the city slums are filled with wretched, starving people and patrolled by indifferent police; the writer taking the view that even if regimes change, everything else stays the same, even though Alcazar had promised improvements in the standards of living in his takeover speech."
Tintin and Captain Haddock, as well as Milu and Professor Tournesol, meet their old friend General Alcazar and help him make a revolution against the dictator General Tapioca! In the mean time, they also free Bianca Casta Fiore, who has been jailed by the Dictator as a way to attract out friends back to his country. His plan to get our heroes killed falls asunder, and they take the opportunity of Carnival to render service to Alcazar, who thus regains power!Maria Carmo,Lisbon, 20 January 2015.
The whole series of Tintin is very entertaining, thrilling and full of adventures with engaging stories and funny characters. My favorite is Captain Hadock
:)) كل شخصية في المغامرة دي محفورة في دماغي مش راضية تطلعبرجل بعبقريته ودماغه اللي مسافرة :Dوالجنرال والمغنية المزعجة والكابتن هادوك :))
Tintin and Captain Haddock read in the news that Bianca Castafiore, and the detectives Thomson and Thompson have been accused for treason and imprisoned in San Theodoros by Dictator Tapioca ! Our friends travel to the island to save their friends but Tapioca has plans! A trap to get them killed!!!
Tintin adventures have been in print approximately 40 years. The stories are fast moving in many different countries with a great cast of eccentric characters from the gruff sea captain to the hard of hearing genius and various friends along the way.Find Tintin and the Picaros at the Westminster Public Library.
As the baby of the family I torn this one into pieces, as a result, when I grew up and learned to read by my own the remaining pieces left me wonder about the ending of the story. Now I got to read it after 25 years and I have to say it's the best of the series. It shows the circle of revolution in the militarist countries in a smart fun way and make you smile when it keeps reminding you how it can really be.
Eikä Tintissä taso tippunut lopussakaan. Oikeastaan vain alkupään jutut menevät vähän harjoittelun piikkiin, mutta sen jälkeen taso oli kivenkovaa viimeiseen asti. T.haijärvellä ja siitä eteenpäin eivät enää mielestäni ole 'oikeita' Tinttialbumeja ja ne elokuvan pohjalta tehdyt saatanat saisi polttaa.
I used to read Tintin when I was in grade school. I saw the new movie and liked it a lot and decided to re-read the Tintin series. I still like like it.
Classic Tintin full of action, adventure, bandits, naughty little generals and a big bang!
تصوير هيرجيه رائع للدكتاتوريات وأنظمة الإنقلابات العسكرية، مميزة وحلوة فعلا
In Hergé’s last completed adventure featuring Belgium’s favourite reporter, we are privy to witness the convoluted and ridiculously contrived mess as General Alcazar attempts to tie off some loose ends in his home country.
Who would have guessed?Honestly, my biggest disappointment was with Captain Haddock’s sudden distaste for alcohol.
I thought it was a wonderful idea to age the character and perhaps have him turn away from the poison that has ailed him for so many years, but this very poignant character development is hand-waved as another one of Professor Calculus’s zany experiments.
Kind of disappointed, although it does suggest the result is permanent, which somewhat follows the same sort of idea.
The second but last part of my big re-read of the whole Tintin-canon after decades ...I had not read this one before, .This is - fittingly for the swansong* - the usual type of Tintin-adventure involving a journey, villains, a jailbreak and it also has at least cameos of most supporting characters from the previous books.Odd to see Tintin with brown bell-bottom jeans and a CND-sticker on his crash helmet. Also, the appearance of Tintin-colleagues Asterix and Mickey Mouse.Verdict: Not the best one, but quite okay. * unless one counts the incomplete, rough sketched 'Tim and Alph-Art' ...
3.5/4I miss reading Tintin for the first time. Still, though, my familiarity hasn't made any of them less enjoyable, by any means. The Captain is one of my very favorite characters, and I always wondered if he did stop his drinking after this, but...well, the Captain is very particular with his drink. 😂I laughed so hard at this this time reading:Captain:  "Saved by the bell, eh?" Thomson: "Oh? I didn't hear it, with the music..."
A good story this one, though not at the same level as some of his previous work. The story isn't as convoluted or suspenseful as other stories, with the humour stepping up to take it's place. While I've always enjoyed the humour, especially with Haddock, I think overall this story doesn't have quite the right balance compared to other ones. Good to see a few of the recurring characters again, and for the final complete adventure it doesn't leave any loose strings at least.
i completely forgot to update my reading status lmao. i finished the comic ages ago and i forgot i was supposed to review it. why am i lazy bum?anyways leaving the self-berating aside, i had a lot of fun reading this latest adventure. and I've discovered that the tintin experience for me is incomplete without the duo of tintin and haddock. highly reccomended
This is the last official Tintin story, and quite a way to finish it! It has a great mix of adventure and politics. While pretty much a sequel to one of Tintin first books, this works great on it's own. We also get a lot of characters and cameos from other stories.Very recommended for fans, and a worthy final book to he series.
Tintin, Captain Haddock and Professor Calculus are stuck in the fictional Latin American nation of San Theodoros and are facing charges against them. The plot of how they escape and redeem themselves makes for a great read!
Full of excitement, action and adventure, this episode is just a masterpiece! With General Alcazar starring in this part, the book is a complete creation!
