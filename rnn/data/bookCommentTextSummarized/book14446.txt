This is a book about obsession, first with the wood, then with self-creation, and finally with a woman who embodies both that wildness and creation.The synopsis: Steven returns from the war to his family home, to recover and reunite with his brother, some time after his father's death.
He soon discovers his brother has been drawn into the mystery of the wood, and its not long before he is disappearing for weeks at a time while Steven keeps house and waits.
I get the underlying mythical undertones, and that psychology about creation, determination, etc., but frankly, it's unpalatable reading about male obsession with his vision of what love is.
So despite the fact that I am going to be talking about the Huxley family a lot in this review, because they are the designated heroes of this book, I think we all know that Harry is the understated, but true hero of this tale.
Christian in an attempt to explain what IS going on to Steven has him read their father's diary which is filled with stories and observations that barely make sense.
As Christian, Steven and Harry spend more time in the woods mythagos are being formed from their own unconscious minds.
In describing my reaction to this book, the first thing I have to say is that it is ORIGINAL (something that is very hard to say when it comes to Fantasy novels these days).
When reading this book, I did not ever think, "Oh I have read this before" or "this reminds me of [insert other book title:]...." The originality of the story itself deserves high praise, but it would be wasted if the story was not well-written, with well drawn characters and memorable supporting players.
It is brilliantly (and beautifully) written with some absolutely classic characters and creatures.This is high level, adult fantasy at it best.
I'll never be able to improve on that.My Review: I have to add a few points to it, though.The mythopoetic roots of the story are clear, and the entire experience of reading the tale is one of immersion into a vivified version of The Hero's Journey: Joseph Campbell on His Life & Work.
Jung's brilliant conceptualization of "The Collective Unconscious" provides the underpinnings of Ryhope Wood, of course, but man-alive does Holdstock do the magisterial idea justice with his fabulation and his enrobement of the ideas in perfectly chosen words.I don't like that the book is called "fantasy" fiction, since it has none of the horrible cliche crapola that identifies fantasy in my mind.

Si os gusta la fantasía, tenéis que leer esta novela si o si.La historia nos narra como cuando Steven Huxley vuelve a casa tras luchar en la 2ª Guerra Mundial donde teóricamente le esperan su hermano Christian y una misteriosa joven llamada Guiwenneth; en realidad se encuentra con un persona descuidad y solitaria, aquejada por los miedos y las obsesiones que también había tenido su fallecido padre, tanto con el bosque que rodea su hogar como por la joven desaparecida.
As I get more experienced in fantasy genre I rarely have "Well this is unlike anything I have read before" moments.
Despite it's slow pace it was never a dull book because in those slow parts atmosphere is being created, characters developed and world more shaped out.I can't really find a flaw in this book but something is lacking for 5 stars.
Also I can easily see this boring some people out of their minds even if they are fantasy fans.
Despite it it this book is easy to recommend.
Ο Holdstock χρησιμοποιεί πράματα όπως την ανατριχιαστική εκδοχή πως είμαστε διαμορφωμένοι από όλα αυτά που ξέρουμε και δεν θυμόμαστε, πως κουβαλάμε χιλιετίες τώρα αρχετυπικές εικόνες μέσα μας.
Τούτο το δάσος είναι ένα από αυτά τα μυστήρια μέρη, για το οποίο μόνο ο πατέρας γνώριζε και είχε γίνει ένας εμμονικός εξερευνητής του στην προσπάθεια να ξεκλειδώσει τα αινίγματά του.Ο Holdstock έχει βασικά ατού, τα οποία γλυτώνουν το βιβλίο από τα κλισέ, τις εύκολες συγκινήσεις και την κακογουστιά των συμβάσεων που κατατρέχουν συχνά την φανταστική λογοτεχνία: προσεγγίζει την ιστορία του από την αρχή μέχρι το τέλος, με μόνη επιδίωξη να την πει όσο πιο καλά γίνεται, χωρίς ουδέποτε να χρησιμοποιεί πολυφορεμένα σχήματα genre.
In the first volume, _Mythago Wood_, we follow the story of Stephen Huxley who returns home from the war to his ancient family home in the countryside of Britain to find his brother, Christopher, a changed and haunted man.
As the story progresses we begin to discover some of the mysteries uncovered by the elder Huxley and see that the wood is much more than a simple forest...it is somehow a nexus for the mythical imagery of humanity and, when people come into close contact with it, can generate 'mythagos', or living embodiments of their mythic figures.
And when you come out, you may have been gone only half the time you spent inside Mythago Wood.The destruction of the Huxley family has been caused by the creation, out of father Huxley's mind, of Guiwenneth, the mythago of an idealized red-haired Celtic warrior princess who occasionally comes out of the woods.
During this time, Steven is figuring out what's going on in the woods and he meets and falls in love with Guiwenneth (yes, the same girl that his father and brother loved).
Steven Huxley, poco después de finalizar la Segunda Guerra Mundial, regresa a Refugio del Roble, en Inglaterra, la finca en la que pasó la mayor parte de su vida junto a su hermano Christian, su madre enferma, y su padre, obsesionado con sus investigaciones sobre el cercano Bosque de Ryhope.
Tras investigar en los escritos de este, Steven llegará a la conclusión de que algo misterioso se oculta en el bosque, un lugar donde tiempo y espacio se distorsionan.‘Bosque Mitago’ (Mythago Wood, 1984), del británico Robert Holdstock, es una maravillosa novela, en la que es mejor adentrarse sabiendo lo menos posible, dejándose envolver de su melancólica atmósfera.
La forza del mitoNel panorama fantasy è sempre più difficile trovare un'opera originale, o che non v
Steven felt abandoned by George, who left for weeks, even months, hiking and camping in the forest next to their house in Herefordshire, England.
Steven and Christian, George's sons, could not understand why or what their father was pursuing in Mythago Wood.
Two weeks after Christian hiked into the woods, Steven finds a woman's body buried under the chicken huts....'Mythago Wood' is a beautifully written homage to the traditional Celtic and Welsh fairy tales of creatures living in the deep forests (and Carl Jung's theories: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jungi...).
Many of these ancient tales are about the mythical Green Man: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green....
The plots and themes are extremely deep and thought provoking, and at times a bit mind bending too.
That classic piece of literature is a good reference to the feel of this book.
Mythago Woods is a book that explores tough questions.
It will expand your mind with the deep themes and plots.This next passage is a good feel for the book and possibly a small spoiler too:“For my part I find it continually fascinating to think that Steven has become a myth character himself!
When both brothers fall in love with a nature goddess mythago that strays from the wood, things get even weirder (and more nasty!)The writer Holdstock produces good solid prose but the very nature of the fantastical premise leads to sloppy plotting.
The principle protagonist learns of the unbelievable powers of the wood and believes it immediately.
His love for the nature goddess seems coerced by her magical animal magnetism and not a real relationship, so it was hard to care about them being together.Many pages are spent delving into the past of the father but we learn early on what has happened to him.
This is a different story and I enjoyed reading it.
I liked the Lovecraftian overtones at the start of the novel and I wish they had been sustained throughout the whole story.
The only drawback was the lack of empathy I felt for the main characters.
The love story was (in my opinion) quite phony - I could not relate to Steven falling for this 'caricature' of a woman, and knowing she is just after all a feminine ideal he created just add to the sense of distance.
If we had had a female protagonist with her own mythago creatures, I might have thought differently but this felt very 'male' to me.

Strange things go on here and its hard to talk about them without giving the storyline away just to say that the book plays on the primal fears and imaginations of what goes on in the deep dark works just over the way.There is a lot of mythological references both real and imaginary but do not let it put you off the story really is how we deal with the unknown and how we deal with it when forced to face it.
So make your own mind up if you think it should be or not but you cannot deny that there is a lot more going on in this book than what you first thought.
Lo fundamental es eso, y creo que es una de las lecturas fundamentales del género, si es que eso existe.Por otro lado, la ejecución es irregular y tengo la sensación de que pasa demasiado tiempo poniendo las piezas necesarias para resolver la tercera parte del libro, que de hecho ocupa cerca de la mitad de las páginas y es alucinante de principio a fin.
Una imagen, por otra parte, que le viene que ni pintada a Bosque Mitago.Creo que ponerle 5 estrellas es un error pero con 4 tengo la sensación de quedarme corto.

Pero el padre de Christian y Steve se interna en él, descubre la existencia de unos seres míticos y los denomina «mitagos» (mito imago) e intenta desentrañar la naturaleza de estos.Años más tarde cuando finaliza la Segunda Guerra Mundial, Steven regresa a su casa después de un periodo de convalecencia y Christian le confiesa que ha retomado la investigación sobre los mitagos y el misterioso secreto que anida en lo más profundo del bosque.
Y es que este libro además de contar con una historia ya de por si hermosa, está hermosamente bien escrita.
Por otra parte, los personajes de este libro me han gustado mucho.
After all, the dude in the helmet on the cover is cool.
And yet, they all focus on her and ignore one another.
I may not see eye to eye with my sisters all of the time, but the ties between us are strong--I just couldn't find the rivalry of Chris and Steven to be believable.
And they ignored all of the things that I found intiguing: ancient languages, lost peoples, a potential way back to the Ice Age....all of that potential ignored.
Maybe some of this will be addressed in the six sequels?
Six?) Do I dare read the next one in hopes of improvement?
I won't rehash everything in detail, I'll just hit the main objections:*There's nothing likeable about any of the characters, all of whom remain ciphers from beginning to end.*Nobody ever bloody talks to each other in the way that normal folks do when confusion exists, which makes the relationships unbelievable.*The love story isn't even remotely romantic.
I kept wanting Steven to ground us somehow with the less familiar legends, to reassure us that elements of them had indeed passed down through the collective memory of British culture, even if the stories themselves had been lost to the mists of time.

For me Mythago Wood has the vibe of Out of the Silent Planet, The Little Stranger and Roadside Picnic.
I loved how the lives of characters were entangled with mythagos, but for example the myth of Guinwenneth was too unknown (even if explained in the book) to truly grasp her character and nature.Also, I am still a little puzzled who and what exactly is a mythago.
I liked the overall idea of myth coming to live in a deep dark forest and it had a great deep dark vibe to it, but sometimes I felt lost between myth, reality, explanation, history, beliefs, superstitions and origins of the characters.
I would classify this book as high concept fantasy.
Holdstock works through a lot of interesting ideas.
The forest has an aura that interacts with the mytho-creative aspects of people's minds to produce mythagos, which are expressions of mythic archetypes.I have read this book multiple times, and if I have a criticism, it is that the book gets a little lost in its concepts to the detriment of story.
Holdstock is brilliant at character development, and the ideas he works with are certainly interesting, though pretty familiar to anyone who has read much of the fantasy published since.
Viena no manām pirmajām nopietnajām fantāzijas grāmatām, tik pat laba kā pirmo reizi lasot!Mitago mežs manas domas pilnībā nekad neatstāja pēc pirmās izlasīšanas - šad un tad piefiksēju, ka domāju par pašu mežu, tajā mītošo un tā īpašībām.
Tas spēcīgi iespiedās manā atmiņā gan kā kaut kas fantastisks gan biedējošs.
Daudz ko gan neatcerējos, bet tas pārlasīšanu padarīja tikai interesantāku.
Viens no labākajiem un maģiskākajiem fantāzijas darbiem ko jebkad esmu lasījusi.
Laikam jāķeras pie pārējām daļām.Bet tās beigas...
Es tā nosmējos par to ironiju.

This book really glued me to my seat. I remember reading it one time when I was going to Hong Kong.Going to HK from Shenzhen was an affair. You had to cross the border and take buses and trains and stand in line a lot. This book was really good, and the suspense is wonderful.If you want a good stand-alone fantasy book I recommend it. I bought the second book (can't remember it's name) but I never got around to reading it.Would I read it again? I think I would if I had to travel in HK again.
What a very satisfying read this turned out to be. Myths, magic and monsters all exist inside Ryhope wood, things that are summoned out of the mind buried legends ingrained in human psyche become terrifyingly real. This book grew on me over the first day or 2 of reading and now it's over I wish it weren't.I liked the ending of the story a few questions need answering though which I guess means I'll have to read the next book in the series. :) :)
Author's Envy! I wish I'd written this book! Here's why: http://www.mark-hodder.com/authorsenv...
This is an acclaimed book.
The basic premise is the concept of mythagos, which are images from the Jungian collective unconscious, which take corporeal form inside Ryhope Wood.
Those who go after the mythagos into the wood are permanently affected.There is a dreamlike quality to this book which I found endearing at the time of reading - however, much of the story did not stick with me.
At the time of reading, I was not much into Joseph Campbell and Jung (that came later), so I was confused with many of the mythopoetic references.So the three stars are entirely subjective.
Totally original, immersive novel. Mythago Wood started out so normal and moved sequentially to the fantastic and magical that you actually believe it. Loved this.The idea of archetypes coming alive and inhabiting a world "within" our own is very kabballistic and fascinating. I honestly didn't see the twists and turns that happened in this. What fun it was it read an unpredictable novel. It was terrifying at times and wonderful. I highly recommend this book.
