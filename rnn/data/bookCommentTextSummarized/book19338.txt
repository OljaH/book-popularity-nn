I remembered everything."Don't you love it when the second book in a series is way better than the first?
But in this installment of the series the characters have grown and the story seems a little deeper and more meaningful.I love Han's writing.
And Han writes it perfectly so that it causes your heart to ache.Belly's character is showing some maturity in this book.
If you have read the first book you will know she was a little bit selfish.
It wasn't enough to know that deep down, he loved me.
3.5/5 Belly was more obnoxious in this book and the love triangle was hit SO HARD but I still really liked it.
This didn't even feel like a real book.
It was just a continuation of the last one which ended kinda abruptly, so this series is probably meant to be read back-to-back to make it seem like all one storyline.
I definitely liked book one way more.
She's selfish and childish in a way that i'm sure some people hate, but to me, it's completely relatable.
It's her flaw, and it makes her real to me.
I'm definitely gonna be finishing the third book this summer, and i'm excited to see what these characters have in store for them, even if I wish the first book had somehow remained a standalone.
Man.... So many ups and downs. I feel so attached to everyone, and I feel like they are real people dealing with real struggles. It's a nice change.
I didn't liked it as much as the first one. Belly is starting to piss me off and don't make me talk about Conrad, I can barely stand him.Jeremiah, Laurel and Susannah are my faves <3.
Jeremiah's thought process seems to be that he wants to be the one chosen over his more accomplished and better at everything brother more than it's about him actually wanting Belly.
Like he'll feel better about himself if he gets chosen instead.Belly tells Conrad off the day of the mother's funeral, unable, she says, to stop herself.
I felt like I actually understood Conrad far less at the end of this book than I did at the end of the first one, Belly regressed a lot and Jeremiah wasn't the same person as the first book.
I finished the second book without realizing it.
The second book is a lot gloomier than the first now that the glue that supposedly holds the characters together is now gone.
*Sniffs* The second installment has become more mature than the first book.
Usually, I go for the dark, brooding, indifferent guy so I should go with Conrad but I’m starting to get annoyed at his coldness so maybe I should go for the sweet, caring and happy Jeremiah instead.
Ugh. I guess, I’ll finally get to pick my final guy come third book so third book, here I come!
Another year has come and gone and things are not quite so rosy for our summer crowd.
We knew Susannah was sick last year, and with her gone, everyone is having trouble coping.
We ended “The Summer I turned Pretty” with Conrad and Belly finally, maybe being a thing, but with Conrad’s mother passing away, of course that’s going to throw things into turmoil.
Conrad is the dark, mysterious one Belly has always loved, but you have to feel sorry for Jeremiah, the sweet neglected kid who never gets the girl and seems to fade out of the spotlight every time his brother is around.
It's Not Summer Without You by Jenny Han is the second book of the young adult contemporary Summer series.
This one picks up a year after the end of the first book as summer is beginning again.
After the event that changed all of their lives they begin to drift apart until the day Jeremiah contacts Belly looking for help finding Conrad.
It's Not Summer Without You was by far a lot more emotional than the first book of the series but in many ways still the same progression.
Re-read 8/12/17: This was super cute, but I definitely don't feel quite as enamored with this series as I did when I first read it. I'm keeping my 4 star rating because I did thoroughly enjoy this, but I definitely have some issues with how annoying Belly is and how Conrad is NOT the business. Original read 5/7/14: I loved this one so much more than the first book. Oh, my heart. I've fallen in love with Jenny Han's writing style. Also on a less serious note DAT LAST PAGE THO
4.5/5This was definitely a more somber and emotional read than The Summer I Turned Pretty, but I really liked it! I couldn't give it a full 5/5 because I still think Belly is annoying and childish at times which bothers me, but I read the whole book in about four hours! If you loved the first book like I did, definitely read this one!
☀ A splendid summer read ☀Cousins Beach was Belly's home.
Susannah, her mother's best friend had passed away and summer at Cousins Beach was no more.
Without her, it wouldn't be a perfect summer.Belly has grown in this book.
I liked Belly much better in this book.
I love the way how she's attached to Beck's Brothers.
How she keeps smiling and is always there for them, especially Conrad who was completely mean to her.Conrad seemed very moody in this book.
I guess the loss of the one you love can do that to people.
Actual rating: 3.5 starsI'm really surprised I actually liked this, Belly's still immature, but she didn't bother me as much. Plus, something actually happened in this book, I'm addicted here. (view spoiler)[Though I don't appreciate the love triangle. (hide spoiler)] It's also nice to see more of Jeremiah, since he was this really bland character in The Summer I Turned Pretty.CONRAD <3On to We'll Always Have Summer! Woohoo!
3.5* This series is the definition of a 'summery read'.
It makes me regret all the summers I didn't spend at a gorgeous beach house, eating blueberry muffins, swimming in the ocean whilst having multiple cute guys falling in love with me....
:') The ending felt very abrupt which was a bit of a shame but it left me wanting to get my hands on the third book asap!
It felt a bit like this series was written to be binge read!
Flew through this in a day, a super cute and summery read.Book one for Booktubeathon 2016 is complete!
THAT ENDING THO!!!!! AHHH
Shoot me now! 🙄 This book was even worse than the first one. Why does Belly bave to be so undecided and why does Conrad has to be such an ass?! I'm still team Jeremiah! All the way. I was so glad when I saw that some chapters were written from his point of view. 😍 But then Conrad ruined everything! Just like he always does.
I wasn't a huge fan of this one... Belly was WAY more annoying and childish, and it was a chore to read about her. However, the ending was good and I feel like the last book will be better because she seems like she's finally done lusting after Conrad, which was part of what made her so annoying.
What the f***? What just happened? How will i deal with this? Oh i know. read the next book ASAP. This book made me an emotional mess. I can't even write a proper review. Damn you Jenny Han!!
Se me ha hecho demasiado corta esta segunda parte, pero les aseguro que no le falta nada.
Y aunque el final es un poco adelantado y siento que no muy bien formulado, Jenny Han tiene el toque para dejarte en incertidumbre sobre que pueda suceder.Los personajes que más me desesperaron fueron Belly y Conrad.
Aunque debo decir que no seria el personaje que hubiera elegido para que narra, hubiera elegido a Conrad, pero Jenny Han afortunadamente a remediado su error y narrara varios capítulos en la ultima entrega.Estoy con muchas ansias de leer el ultimo libro de la trilogía espero supere a este en todos los sentidos.
She had this wonderful relationship with Susannah and this undeniable bond and connection with Conrad and Jeremiah, you get this vibe that each summer spent by these two families is almost like their own little getaway and secret hideout that is completely closed of from the real world, maybe that’s what keeps them going back each time.What does eventually grow into frustration from my part is Belly treating Conrad like a god, he can treat her like absolute crap to the point of breaking her, all he has to do is say her name and she is already running right back to him.
That last page! OMG! What?! I need the last book NOW.
I've grown up reading this series over and over again and I loved it this time around just as much as I remember. Belly is still the most annoying yet loveable character around. Conrad is still insufferable. Jeremiah still deserves better. Reading about these characters feels like being wrapped in a warm blanket. I don't care that this book is the exact opposite of my current tastes this series is like an old friend and I will never not love it. For me, It's not summer without this book series.
I know i'm boring with this "You have to read this book" .. but you really have to! :)
It's very apparent in this book that the relationship between Belly and Conrad is not a healthy one.
And the scene when Belly and Jeremiah show up at the beach house.
I feel like it's super important to keep in mind that Belly is a teenage girl and she is dealing with her long-standing crush/love.
She's dealing with feelings and emotions.
She's dealing with who she thinks her mom is.
Although super heartbreaking, I loved the theme of being supportive of people through trying times.
I think Jeremiah made a good point of, "You didn't come to see me.
Picture in your mind a summer road trip, windows down and the breeze blowing in with the radio up.
You get out of the car, walk up the steps you've walked up so many summers onto a wrap around porch.
Inside you hear people's voices.
Not just any voices but the voices of the people who have molded you into you.
You open a creaky screen door which reminds you that you are home and summer is finally here.
Tangled hair, sunburned shoulders, Judy Blume, in bed by nine thirty."This book was so so wonderful!
My word these books are so good!!
Belly is slightly more annoying and the love triangle between two brothers made me feel more uncomfortable than the first time around, maybe because I'm older now, but I seriously can't put these books down.
I know this is my second time reading, but there was a lot of things I didn't remember - like how annoying Belly is and how stupid Conrad is.
I'm 100% against love triangles in real life, but I'm soooo here for them when it comes to books.
They just make things interesting, even though deep down you know who is going to win.
Okay, so this book trilogy was recommended to me by a friend, she said this book was AMAZING. (She read it years ago)The first book was a little meh. But this one, oh god.Its too childish i think. The typical love triangle, between two brothers and the girl. The girl switches from guy to guy, and is confused. I mean, its cute and all, but i feel like its an overly used cliche.Don't get me wrong I LOVE Jenny Han, but this trilogy... is disappointing me. Still i will read the third book, because i bought it, so..
The bad news is the wait itself, Jenny Han can write thirty books and I bet I will want to read them all, her gorgeous trance inducing language and amazing story lines lool the reader better then a mermaid singing her alluring song to sailors lost at sea.This has nature you can taste in your mouth and feel on your face; the salty water and green ozone filled days and the sad lonely nights, the heartbreak and always changing teenage emotions and feelings that remind us of our own adulthood and the lasting pains of growing up.
“I will never look at you in the same way ever again. I'll never be that girl again. The girl who comes running back every time you push her away, the girl who loves you anyway.”  I feel so many things inside of me for this book, and that is incredible because when a book makes you feel that way it's because without doubt it has reached your heart.3.5 /5 StarsAlready from the beginning something very tragic and emotional happens so you feel hooked right away, broken my heart from the start, re
, And then he ruins everything and behaves like a child and I'm already very confused right now.The thing is that I'm still waiting to know what is going through Conrad's head , I really want to believe that there is a good excuse behind his behavior, even so I have to confess that I can't wait to see what will be his next move, this romance It has me addictive.Jeremiah, again, is the sun that illuminates all these silly behaviors, he's the most mature character of the book for me, he's the most sensitive and he always thinks about everything else, I really love him, I don't know how everything will end, but I really hope that will be good for him.
(2015 review)★★★★ [4.3/5]Someone please tell me why i enjoy this books? Because i have no idea and yeah im saying this cause i still don’t get it. I don’t know what was going on with me today meanwhile i was reading this book but hell i was emotional. Around page 12 or so they throw this awful thing (view spoiler)[Susannah dies (hide spoiler)] wich is funny because i was totally expecting that but my face was just like “There are moments in life that you wish with all your heart you could take b
Conrad…i still don’t know how im suppoused to feel about him because he was pretty much of an idiot around the whole book and i understand him because his going through hard times, i know that i’ll act the same fucking way or even worse but at the same time he was so mean sometimes i felt bad for Belly.
About Jeremiah he always have been very open about his emotions and that stuff so it was about time for Belly to realice she wanted to be with him but i don’t know if i felt comfrotable with that situation because even if Conrad it’s been a son of a bitch i have this feeling that he’s the one that has been loving Belly all this time is just he doesn’t know how to express it that’s all.
