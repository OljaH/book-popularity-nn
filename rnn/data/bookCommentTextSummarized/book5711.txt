is really not a good book, not if you've read any of the Island Stallion sub-series.
In those books, Steve is a good, nice kid who loves his horse, just like Alec.
Just like in The Black Stallion's Sulky Colt, any time Alec meets up with another boy who loves a horse, he becomes a saint.
This is not an enjoyable thing to read.Also, Farley doesn't really clear up the issue of whether Flame or The Black is faster.
He leaves you with the implication that The Black is a nose-bob faster, but never really comes out and definitively says (most likely trying not to make any Flame fans angry).
A far more realistic storyline than The Black Stallion and Flame, with those two facing off in a horse race. Other than the fact that Flame's owner, Steve, becomes a total pod person, I liked this one. I was, however, rather amused by the exclamation point in the title. Why?
I read this dozens of times when I owned a paperback copy and yet I still cannot decide how many stars to give it. Maybe I'll need to buy myself a replacement copy to determine star value if Goodreads demands I do. Although The Black Stallion Challenged! (don't forget that !) had many enjoyable elements (a great race -- Flame Vs The Black) it also had some cheesy elements (Steve wants to buy the island where Flame and his herd live). It's hard for me not to look back at this book without wearing the rose-tinted glasses of nostalgia.
Oh, Henry, you cranky old geezer! Oh, Steve, you hot-headed young punk! Oh, Alec, you wise-beyond-your-years paragon! Oh, Flame, you wild and unreliable stallion full of beauty and heart! Oh, Black, there aren't any words big enough for you, you are Horse Incarnate. Which is to say, yes, more of the same, but who can quibble with races like these?
Finally a horse that can give the Black Stallion a run for his money. The ending had to work out the way it did.
Yes, this is one book that isn't all about adventure, being stranded on an island, wandering the desert, or surviving another plane or boat disaster.
But this is a book by Walter Farley and I am certain that those who love horses, those who love the track, will enjoy this book from cover to cover.
Farley writes racing like no one else can, making you believe you are living the book yourself.
For those who love the sport will be a very wonderful and welcome experience to become lost in time with these two beautiful horses at historical Hialeah Park.
The main characters are Steve Duncan and Alec Ramsay.
Steve Duncan has blonde hair and rides a red horse named Flame.
Alec Ramsay rides a horse named the Black.
This book takes place at Hialeah, Fla. The problem in this book is a guy named Steve Duncan writes a letter to Alec about his horse, Flame, and how he needs "help" to buy an island for his horse.
He also puts in the letter that he thinks his horse is faster than the black.
In my opinion I think the book was perfect.
This book is awesome!
"The Black Stallion Challenged" was a book that got intense in some parts but for the most part this book was not a very good book. The book was for much younger kids and the only reason I picked this book was because I thought I would still like the series. This book had a very limited vocabulary and also had a corny ending which I did not like. Overall this book is one of the worst books I have ever read and I will not read another one in this series again.
Alec Ramsay and his faithful trainer Henry Dailey are wintering in Hialeah, Florida, where they hope to race their prize horse, the Black Stallion.
(Some details are different–the rules of horse racing have changed since the 1960s, let alone the 1940s.) The final race in particular is exciting as the outcome is in doubt until the horses pass the finish line.The Stallion series is nominally children’s books, so I should mention that there is an operation on an injured horse that may be too intense a scene for sensitive readers.
"Having a great horse could make anyone really enjoy life to the fullest."Honestly, I would give this book an entire other star if not for one reason...I HATE Steve Duncan in this. He was not obnoxious in The Island Stallion, The Island Stallion's Fury, OR The Island Stallion Races. But here he's this conceited, arrogant little... ugh! He was the worst thing about a book that could have been a great match between two literary stallions.
I enjoyed the official meeting of the Black and Flame in this book. I remember well Flames meeting with the Black on Azule Island. I would like to know more of Flame’s training and progress that made him so well mannered to run these handicap races without fighting his dominant stallion instincts.
Steve Duncan contacts Alec wanting to race Flame against the Black.
Steve has a chip on his shoulder and doesn't want to take any advice about racing.
While Alec sympathizes, he knows that his own horse is every bit as good, and this is one race that will be up to the riders.I absolutely loved this book.
I love both stallions, but I think that Alec is by far the better man of the two.
He may be young, but he is fully matured.Steve is still a boy, with the follies of youth.
In an epic and inevitable story - the Black and Flame finally meet on the track.
Steve Duncan travels to the U.S. with his horse in a bid to finally secure his future and his horse's safety.
It's an easy decision for me to root for Alec; I've never connected with Steve in the same way, and The Black Stallion is simply too much of a survivor for me to want anyone to best him.
Still, tension remains throughout the story, regardless of who you root for, because once and for all it's proven these horses are each other's equal.
I read this childhood favorite for my work challenge. It does not break the Law of Sustainability: An author's ability to write well, especially for a series, deteriorates over time. (I'm guessing someone could graph this and show a direct inverse correlation between the number of books in a series and the quality of each book.) This is the 16th book in the Black Stallion series, and it is a lame sister compared to the first book. I did learn something about the business of horse racing in the 1960's.
Have you ever been scared while being challenged in a race? The black stallion is a champion until an unproven racer with skills. Steve Duncan his owner thinks that he can beat the black. The black always wins with out a challenge. Flame proves in a workout that he can keep up with the black. Will the black have the race of his life? Read to find out if he will be defeated by the island horse Flame.-Juan Romero
I enjoyed the characters, and their world and hope I get the chance to read the story again and/or to read more within the series.My Rating System:* couldn't finish, ** wouldn't recommend, *** would recommend, **** would read again, ***** have read again.
I raced through this series as a child. Of course, "The Black Stallion" was my favorite, and I read it a few times, but I waited eagerly for any of the books to return to my branch of the library so I could snap them up.
It was an extremely good book. But what I didn't like is Steve Duncan's character was changed into an arrogant snotty kid. He was definately different in this book then all the others. I highly recommend the book still.
Extra 1/2 star.
The first book was the story of a boy and a horse, but the series grows with books on similar themes of overcoming adversity and animal/human bonding. Loved them as a kid.
See the first book in the series for a full review.
Such an amazing tale. Sadly it's the last book Flame appears in.
There was not a Black Stallion book that I could ever put down. The stories are the best.
Not the edition shown- older Random House 1964? paperback edition; correct ISBN
