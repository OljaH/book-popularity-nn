Do we really need this series to continue? Whatever, I'll still read it.
The takeaway here—some things should be left to stand on their own.Why Jojo Moyes felt compelled to take a story as emotionally charged as Me Before You and drag it out to a trilogy, I’ll never understand.
With this final installment (let's hope), Jojo Moyes captures that version of Lou readers initially fell for—the quirky clothes horse who stood out in a crowd for simply being herself—and delivers a journey of self discovery.This story lacks a bit in the emotional depth department, specifically with regards to the relationships and people Lou surrounds herself with, but it was entertaining enough to keep me engaged.
It doesn't get any better than that - which is why the two books which followed could not live up to their predecessor.In this book we see our much-loved Louisa Clarke moving to New York City to be the "assistant" to a wealthy young socialite.
A socialite who is not much liked by others in her social circles as her husband was once married to their friend.
There will be misunderstandings, new friends, broken hearts, miscommunication, deceit and mayhem.In this book, Louisa takes Will's advice from Me Before you: “You only get one life.
ABSOLUTELY.Louisa Clark is a character that will probably stay with you forever, I mean Hell, I still think about Me Before You till this day and I never regret going into this series, I love it!
I'm always delighted to know about her and her life, it's like going on an adventure to be honest, it's an amazing experience.So in this book we learn about the next stage in Louisa's new life, New York.
Following a new series of events Lou finds herself facing other challenges trying to make something out of herself and not just the plain Louisa Clark from Stortfold.
Hello again, Louisa Clark!  NEW YORK, NEW YORK  Books teach you empathy. I enjoyed a lot reading this book, since after three novels (counting this one), Louisa Clark, is already a literary character that it’s always a wonderful experience to read about.Louisa Clark goes to her next phase in her life, this time leaving her native England to go to work at New York. She has to leave her family, her friends and her boyfriend, Ambulance Sam, only Nathan is with her, since it was him who helped her

I absolutely loved Me Before You and After You so I was delighted to read the first chapter of Still Me. Reading about Louisa is like meeting an old friend. I was hooked from the first sentence and can't wait to read the rest of the book. It was lovely to find out that she is in New York starting a new job and still the same adorable character. Thank you Jojo Moyes for bringing Louisa back to us.
Few people can leave me emotionally jumbled quite like Jojo Moyes can. The first book of hers I read,  Me Before You , literally had me ugly crying, and I'll admit a healthy sob or two while reading its sequel,  After You . Even one of Moyes' standalone books,  The Girl You Left Behind , left me puffy-eyed.Now Louisa Clark returns in a third book,  Still Me . While not as sob-inducing as the first two, Moyes still knows how to play my feelings like a piano, and it was wonderful to be back with t
It takes meeting two people—an elderly woman who knows all about doing it your own way no matter the cost, and a wealthy young man who reminds her of someone she misses dearly—to show her the choices she needs to make, and the importance of remaining true to who you are.<"The key was making sure that anyone you allowed to walk beside you didn't get to decide which you were, and pin you down like a butterfly in a case.
But that didn't bother me as much as it might with other books, because these characters are so engaging, and Moyes' storytelling just draws you in and feels comfortable and familiar.
Each book she brings something along from the previous book(s), but each book also stands on its own.I will say that I think I enjoyed this one more than After You. Something about the story made it feel more like a direct sequel to Me Before You. Not that I was hoping it would be or that being like the first makes it better.
It was just nice to return to a story that felt like what I remembered from the first.For sequels, the question is often asked "do I need to read the previous books?" I think that this one offers enough background from the earlier books and doesn't lean too much on their content so that you could read this without the others if you really wanted to.
Why This Book  I enjoyed the first two books in the 'Me Before You' series, then I won the third one, Still Me, by Jojo Moyes, in a Goodreads Giveaway. I was quite excited and nervous, as I adored the first book but thought the second was just decent/good. I am very glad to say this third one is much closer to the first!  Approach & Style  I read an advance copy of this ~378 page paperback novel in about 5 hours during a two day period. It goes very quickly as the story is quite intriguing
I enjoyed the first two books in the 'Me Before You' series, then I won the third one, Still Me, by Jojo Moyes, in a Goodreads Giveaway.
I may be partial as I know a lot of the places in the book since it takes place in NYC; however, even when Lou is just wandering around with no real plot, it's brilliant writing.
It takes the reality from the second book with the emotions from the first book, then smashes them together in a final wrapper on discovering what makes Lou 'still me.'I can't say enough good things about this book...
I didn't think much of book 2, and I absolutely adored book 1 so I honestly didn't know what to expect.Lou has taken her new and exciting job in New York and moved her life over there, meanwhile her handsome boyfriend Sam remains at home in Storfold.
The parts with Sam really got to me, as I know first hand how god-awful distance can be for a relationship, and I desperately wanted things to work out for them.
NEW YORK.
NEW YORK.
NEW YORK.
For Lou however, moving to New York has brought about lots of challenges.
Lou has to leave Sam - her new boyfriend and though they agreed to try a long distance relationship - it turns out to be quite the bumpy ride, but then with Louisa, you’d expect nothing less.
While in New York, Louisa meets someone, a man who reminds her of her Will and it throws Louisa for a loop, and when Sam sees him, it throws him for one too.
New York is both everything and nothing like Louisa Clark expected.
Madre de Dios! Qué manera de escribir tiene esta mujer; aún estoy sufriendo. Y asimilando lo que queda detrás de las palabras. Sencillamente precioso! Un oda a la vida y al carpe díem...

Authentic garments & Authentic girl are both alternatives to be admired and loved.Dean Martin.....is that the best dog’s name or what for London girl living in New York for the first time?Kiss kiss kiss.......💋💋💋“Me Before You”....5 Stars “After You”....3 Stars“Still Me” 4.5 Stars
OMG she's gonna milk this cow till it bleeds it seems. I don't know what to think, to be honest. Adding it just to piss myself off.

Her selflessness is her downfall because she leaves behind her pride, and her own sense of self's value to be stomped on.'Me Before You' revolves around Louisa becoming the "companion" of Will Traynor, a man who is paralysed and permanently stuck in a cynical state.
And somewhere amongst the chaos, she begins to date a paramedic named Sam, quite possibly the least romantic and least passionate man to star as a leading hero in a book.
And only when Sam learns that she is dating Josh does he begin to write letters wanting her back.
I loved Me Before You and enjoyed After You, two books I recommend you read before you read the third book in the trilogy, Still Me. In Still Me, Louisa keeps her promise to Will, her love from book one, to say yes to new opportunities.
There are perks to her job, like going to charity balls in 3,000-dollar dress purchased by her employer, but it puts a huge strain on her relationship with Sam. Can they make the long-distance thing work, or is this going to be the end of them?I laughed and teared up at this book.
I decided to reread Me Before You and After You which are the first two books in the series again to remind me of Louisa's story so far.
Reading about Louisa is like visiting an old friend.
I loved this book and read it in two days because I did not want to put it down.
I was hooked from the first sentence and absolutely loved being able to read about Louisa's adventure in New York and all the ups and downs she encountered.
I hope there will be another book about Louisa and her family in the near future.
Oh, Louisa Clark, what did you get yourself into?Prior to reading this book, I watched the movie adaptation of Me Before You. I told myself I wasn’t going to, because there’s just no way the movie is going to do the incredible book justice, but I couldn’t help myself.
But Lou is there to help, and the dedicated friend she always is, she sacrifices a lot for Agnes—her time, her relationships and even her honesty.
Nothing is as it seems and sometimes you realize that even perfectly polished people have problems, so this book sure opens your mind and encourages you to not believe everything you see or are told.Lou learns a lot working for Agnes and discovering a new city—New York.
***SPOILER ALERT!! NO!! Just no!! Ugh, I feel cheated and duped!!! The ending was CRAP!!!! I’m so angry at this book, ANGRY!!!

★★★★I have to admit I didn't have high expectations for this third and again unnecessary continuation of Me Before You. I hadn't planned to read it but a very favorable review from trusted goodreads friend: Myrna convinced me that it was worth the read. And yes, it is very worth the read. In my opinion, Still Me may be more accepted by apprehensive readers as it reads very much like a standalone novel. Yes, there are flashbacks and mentions of characters from the first two books, but it feels fa
★★★★½I have to admit I didn't have high expectations for this third and again unnecessary continuation of Me Before You. I hadn't planned to read it but a very favorable review from trusted goodreads friend: Myrna convinced me that it was worth the read.
And yes, it is very worth the read.
Yes, there are flashbacks and mentions of characters from the first two books, but it feels far from a "continuation".
The characters she meets along the way are easy to invest in whether you hate them or love them.
Louisa has finally found herself and I for one love her.
4.5*I will admit I cried during this book.
I know it was not needed to write three books, like a lot of reviewers are saying, but I love, love Lou!
I said it in my After You review that she is one of my favorite literary characters.
I felt some closure on her story by having three books.
I found this book to be an intriguing story and beautifully written.
I love books that make you feel an array of emotions.
I went from anger, sadness, to content from chapter to chapter.
How a book makes you feel is the definition of a good book.
Why did Moyes decide to write another book in this series? Not sure. Is this the last one in the series? I have no idea. Regardless, Jojo is an excellent writer and a good storyteller and those qualities shine through in this one. I enjoyed reading Lou’s ups and downs and NYC adventures. Lou is charming and endearing! I wouldn’t mind a 4th book.
Makes me so sad that I’ve seen so many comments like, “she shouldn’t of made a second/third book” “she’s just milking it now.”I for one have loved every single of of the books and I would gladly read a 4th filling us in on what life has in store for Lou and Sam.
Esto es demasiado para mí pobre corazón.Lo que es querer sacar más dinero. A mí, este libro me sobra... igual que El Segundo pero es MI OPINIÓN 🤷🏻♀

Después de leer: Sinceramente me ha encantado! He visto a la Lou que amo; divertida, extravagante, con todas esas locuras... tan valiente y atrevida. Lanzándose al mundo, dando siempre lo mejor de sí misma. SIENDO ELLA MISMA. Es la protagonista que me conquistó en el primer libro. Jojo Moyes tiene un don para escribir, es maravillosa. ¡Qué historia tan preciosa!   "La clave consistía en asegurarse de que nadie a quien permitieras caminar a tu lado decidiera quién eras y te etiquetara, como a una
Por primera vez siento que las palabras correctas no llegan a mí aunque me pase horas y horas pensándolas, que simplemente no podré describir este libro.
ahora, con lo que la autora nos ha regalado, pienso que la historia de Lou sigue siendo maravillosa.
Que cada libro es una luz de esperanza, y te deja con ganas de vivir al máximo...Vive con osadía, Clark.Antes de leer:¿Han visto que portada más bonita?♡Sí, no pega con los otros dos libros, pero está preciosa!
Necesito saber cómo continúa y espero, de verdad espero que la autora de por terminada esta historia.
¿Por qué tus personajes son tan hermosos?
"I think at some point, dear, you're going to have to work out who Louisa Clark really is."Louisa Clark arrives in New York to become the personal assistant to Agnes Gopnik, the second (and younger) wife of Mr. Gopnik.
More than anything, I love Lou and reading about her journey.
And Lou, well, she has to forget quite a bit.
Moyes knows how to draw in an audience and keep them invested.There was no shortage of the Clark family antics in this work and I thoroughly enjoyed them.
Find all of my reviews at: http://52bookminimum.blogspot.com/Because if anyone deserves a happy ending, it’s Lou . . . .  No actual review. The fact that I - reader of never more than one book in a series - saw this one through to the finish (especially after HATING After You) should speak volumes. ARC provided by NetGalley in exchange for an honest review. Thank you, NetGalley!
Jojo Moyes has done it again! I’ve been waiting and waiting for this 3rd book to come out by this author. The first “Me Before You” and the 2nd book “After You” were fabulous!! I was a little worried I wouldn’t remember the 2 prior books since I read them so long ago. But it was fine. This 3rd book is TERRIFIC!!! I loved everything about this book. I’d give this book 10 stars if I could!! If you liked the other 2 as I did, then you need to read this one too!!!
