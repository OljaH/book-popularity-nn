This is much more accessible to a twenty-first century reader than John Reedâ€™s book and offers valuable characterizations of prominent women and men from the time. It carries the reader along on the revolutionary wave from the perspective of an American journalist sympathetic to the Bolsheviks. Disappointingly, Bryant shows no skepticism of the show the Bolsheviks put on for her of treating their prisoners well.
Though lacking the political clarity of her husband John Reed's book "Ten Days that Shook the World", Bryant's book covers a larger amount of time and material. Another difference from John Reed's book is that she strives much more for neutrality (despite her obvious sympathy for the Bolshevik cause)than John Reed ever did. In many ways this book is a perfect companion to Ten Days That Shook the world, and it may be useful for people to read the books together.
Oh Louise!
