When I found an opportunity to fit a Poirot mystery into my schedule, I selected Dead Man's Folly in order to exercise my little gray cells.Crime writer Ariadne Oliver has invited Hercule Poirot to Lassecombe to assist her in judging a murder scavenger hunt.
I found Dead Man's Folly to be typical of a Poirot case, but, as Hercule Poirot is still one of my favorite detectives, typical does its role in having my exercise my own little gray cells in reading a mystery rather than taking a reading break.
There's something to be said about red herrings and clues.
When an author of the crime genre renders it impossible to distinguish between the two, it means that the book one is reading is worth praise.Praise Dame Christie with great praise.
Indeed, the queen of crime is also the first cozy mystery writer.
This is a claim I make without delving into the history of cozies but I found this fact often online.Hercule Poirot nabs the criminal.
But how wonderful it was that the criminal is not on scene being undone by the Belgian detective.
When Christie wants to write, she can write.
We found the body in the kitchen area with a tea bag stuffed into his mouth and a plane ticket for Tangiers in his right breast pocket.”“I am not French, Monsieur, I am Belgian.” Pointing to his forehead, “The little gray cells have never let me down and if it is how you say, then who is buried under the magnolia bush?”“I wouldn’t know, you twit, we’re on an ocean liner.”Kids, sadly, the Scooby Gang and the Harlem Globetrotters were not available to bail Poirot out on this one.A real review: Although this one isn’t top tier Poirot, it’s a good one, with Christie’s trademark wit and a mystery that left me guessing up until the last chapter.
4.5 "I almost had it this time!" stars #6 in my Agatha Christie Challenge. Well, I tell you that it is a secret desire of mine to go a mystery dinner theatre. But certainly not this particular fete! In Dead Man's Folly(which does sound like a pirate book) two Christie characters- Ariadne Oliver and the greatest Belgian(besides Jean Claude Van Damme), Hercule Poiriot meet up and try to solve the baffling case of the murder of a teenage girl and disappearance of a rich man's wife. It makes for a great page turning mystery.
I read somewhere that detective novels, particularly the ones from the Golden Age, can in fact be considered 'fantasies' since the culprit(s) is always found out and the 'order' restored.
As for the Belgian detective, he behaved in a much more reserved manner (to his usual arrogance), which suited him best.
An entertaining read to restore myself, which was just what I needed :0)P.S. listened to the audiobook, beautifully voiced by David Suchet, who will always be The Poirot for me ;0)
That's all."Christie gets a chance through Oliver to fictionally respond to criticism of her writing mainly about rich people (which is true!), so she makes everyone go out of their way to disdain George and Hattie Stubbs as vain and shallow rich people.
Christie is also consistently criticized for being ethnocentric, possibly racist, so she goes out of her way to comment through Oliver and other characters on racism in this volume, finally.The Plot: Oliver is contacted by these two (rich!) people who want to stage a murder mystery (a kind of interactive play) at their estate, so they hire Oliver to plan the event.
But – as ever – his little grey cells keep working – and in time he begins to pick up the threads of the case.There is one whopping-great clue in this book – and I really ought to have homed in upon the fact that it received a couple of subtle mentions.
There were a fair share of flapping red herrings, and also – I felt – a little bit of sneakiness on the part of the author (aspects one could not reasonably guess) – but overall, plenty to work out whodunit.However, I have read enough Agatha Christies now to realise this doesn’t very often happen.
Ας πουμε πως διαβαζω Agatha Christie για συναισθηματικους λογους και οχι γιατι ειναι πολυ καλη συγγραφεας,οχι οτι δεν εχει δειξει υπεροχα δειγματα γραφης, αλλα στην περιπτωση αυτη συνεχισα την αναγνωση μονο και μονο γιατι ηθελα να δω που θα το παει.Ας ξεκινησω με το να σας πω δυο λογακια για την υποθεση.
Η εκκεντρικη συγγραφεας μυστηριου Miss Oliver καλει εσπευσμενα τον Hercule Poirot στο σπιτι στο οποιο την εχουν καλεσει διοτι αισθανεται οτι κατι δεν παει καλα.
Εφριξα!Η λυση του μυστηριου ηταν περιπλοκη χωρις λογο.Ηταν φανερο πως πλεον η συγγραφεας ειχε βαρεθει να γραφει για τον Πουαρο,αφου ακομα και ο χαρακτηρας δεν ηταν σε φορμα.https://cherrybookreviews.wordpress.c...
A murder mystery role play (to put it in modern terms) turns into a real murder which for all practical purposes does not make any sense as the victim is a harmless girl.
I dare anybody to solve this one without waiting for Poirot to explain everything in the end of the book; all the clues are there, none of them is hidden.
The plot is so complicated you will have my greatest respect if you do.
I was lost somewhere in the middle of the book, until this time I was able to follow Poirot.
5 stars to one of the greatest mystery puzzle.
After reading a few so-and-so novels from Agatha Christie, The Queen of Murder finally worked her magic in this book! I'm quite satisfied with the murder mystery this time! The explanation is superb and the sense of humor is great! XD
One thing is for sure: I am never disappointed by the Queen of mystery.
The other significant factor was that this is one of the seven Christie novels to feature the eccentric crime fiction novelist, Mrs Ariadne Oliver, surely an alter ego of the eminent author herself that allows her the opportunity to poke fun at a somewhat ditzy character whose mind races ahead and consequently renders her thought processes almost incomprehensible to others.
Μπορεί να μην είναι στην καλύτερη της φόρμα αλλα αυτο το folly ήταν τοσο creepy που θα μου μείνει όπως μου μενει καθε φορα κάποιο στοιχείο απο τα βιβλία της λες και κάνω συλλογή.
This one has a perfect setting for a murder mystery : Starts with a "Murder Hunt" (A treasure hunt with a twist) and things start going wrong.
The murder seems without a motive at all & the victim has no known enemies And the mystery keeps deepening.
Looking back,the finer clues were very carefully placed right before you, like missing pieces of a jigsaw puzzle.
The characters, the setting & the story all are great.
The only complain is that Poirot's part in entire investigation is very limited.
Overall not Poirot's greatest case but the mystery part keeps you hooked & the ending is satisfying.
I enjoyed Dead Man's Folly whilst reading it but felt afterwards that there were too many elements Dame Agatha used better elsewhere, despite it being from arguably the strongest part of her long career.
I love Nemesis and think it's undervalued by critics because it was late in her career and repeated certain elements like this one.
I thought Hattie was probably Mrs. Folliat's daughter and her marriage was engineered to keep the manor in the family, and I still think that makes more sense than the dead son NOT being dead and also secretly a homicideal bigamist (with no clues to let us know any of that!).
I thought the characters of Sir George and Lady Stubbs were puzzling and was intrigued by them both.
Reading about how Poirot feels about things was funny (he was horrified by how the women dressed and wondered how did they think they would attract the opposite sex dressed the way that they did) and you can definitely feel a divide between the old England and the new.The writing reminded me of classic Christie (The Murder of Roger Ackroyd) days.
The flow was pitch perfect in this book, and I actually found myself reading faster to get to the ending.The setting of the home of George and Lady Stubbs felt haunted to me in a way.
★★★★☆ (This is a review of the audiobook.) What can I say about a talented actor such as David Suchet narrating a classic Agatha Christie mystery?
The same actor who has not only won awards for his audiobook narrations, but actually played Dame Christie’s iconic fictional Belgian detective, Poirot?
If you haven’t listened to him before, give yourself a treat and do so.
Or introduce your children to the wonderful world of Ms. Christie, while you listen along.
Such fun, and Mr. Suchet does the different accents so delightfully; his infections spot-on; and his diction perfect.
داستان جالب داشت و خواننده همزمان باید به دنبال قاتل و مقتول و انگیزه قاتل می گشت مجهول زیاد داشتن و غیر قابل پیشبینی داستان سبب شد کتاب رو بپسندم
“Du ee want the ferry, sir?” There is, fortunately, a list of characters at the front of the book in case you get lost.
Christie fans will spot many of the characters and plot points from previous stories, almost to excess.
Ariadne Oliver, befuddled mystery storywriter and Agatha Christie alter ego, is at her most eccentric.
In addition, late in the book, an anonymous old woman makes a brief appearance.
Surely, Christie has taken a walk-on part in her own novel after Poirot asks if anybody solved the fête murder hunt.
I’ve been rereading a lot of Stephen King lately, but I thought it might be time for a quick Agatha Christie palate cleanser…..so it was that I decided on “Dead Man’s Folly,” a late-model Hercule Poirot joint that went down fairly smooth, although not without a nagging issue that almost served to ruin the whole thing for me.
Christie inserts herself as a character into a number of the later Poirot novels and stories in the form of one Ariadne Oliver, a female mystery author whose appearance and general air appear to be deliciously reminiscent of the Great Dame herself.
Yes, Hattie Stubbs was murdered, but really she wasn't.It all makes sense in the end, I promise.Mrs. Oliver, bless her, gets Poirot involved in a crime that hasn't been committed yet by getting him to the scene to help her figure out what's wrong at Nasse.
Just la commedia è finita and thanks for your shekels, dear Kindle consumer.The Agatha Christie's Poirot version adds a deeply satisfying ending, chops out a deal of deadwood character-wise, and leaves one maddening itchy collar-tag of an irritant: Mrs. Amy Folliatt.MRS.

She does not elaborate but Poirot is curious enough to make the trip to Nasse House where Ms. Oliver is preparing a Murder Game for the village fair.
Although she cannot seem to explain what "isn't quite right", it soon turns out that, indeed, something is wrong as a young girl participating in the game is found strangled and the lady of the house has gone missing.Poirot does not participate much in the story until the end and Ms. Oliver's role is minimal.
The curious thing about Christie in the later books is her tendency to break her own mysteries.
The odd Mrs. Oliver again makes her appearance, trying to arrange a pageant of murder within a book that does the same thing.
Once again we have her saying she doesn't know why people like her books and having difficulty explaining how she writes them.
The attempted inclusion of political elements to the plot doesn't really work either -- it seems too tacked on.So, in other words, she breaks her own mystery by not playing fair.
Sure, I'd seen DMF twice adapted for the small screen (with David Suchet and Peter Ustinov delegated the Belgian detective) but it seems I've completely forgotten because the deliciously far-fetched ending came out of nowhere.
Overall, I sped through this and had such a fun time guessing, though I thought I knew which way it was going.
If you're going to give Christie (and more specifically Poirot) a chance than this later entry is just as good an entry point as any other.
Brilliant. One of the best murder mysteries I've read in a long, long time. Quite compelling as well as puzzling. Also: I PARTIALLY SOLVED IT!!!!!!! (Yes, I know; I didn't *really* solve it. Hush. Don't spoil my fun ;-) )
Η συγγραφέας βιβλίων μυστηρίου και φίλη του Ηρακλή Πουαρό, Αριάδνη Όλιβερ, καλείται από τον σερ Τζωρτζ Σταμπς στο κτήμα του στο Νέισκομπ του Ντέβον για να οργανώσει ένα κυνήγι θησαυρού-μυστηρίου στο πλαίσιο μιας φιλανθρωπικής εκδήλωσης που θα γίνει εκεί.
Στο μυθιστόρημα η συγγραφέας παίζει άλλη μια φορά με την οπτική γωνία με την οποία βλέπει κανείς τα πράγματα, ρίχνοντας εσκεμμένα το φως σε άλλο σημείο, στήνει έναν πανέξυπνο καμβά γύρω από τον οποίο υφαίνεται το κίνητρο του φόνου και με συγκίνησε με τον ρόλο που παίζει ένας άνθρωπος διωγμένος από τα αλλοτινά μεγαλεία της ζωής του και πόσο τον κούρασε όλη αυτή η περιπέτεια!
poirot zor durumda kalır. az kalsın bir cinayetin katilini bulamayacaktır. ama ona boşuna poirot deniyorlar😍😍
Totally enjoyed this book by the great Agatha Christie
How can this be? I know I must have read this before but nothing seems familiar. So I have the delightful feeling of a fresh, new Agatha Christie. The premise is delightful. Mystery author Ariadne Oliver has been hired to organize a Murder Hunt game for a small village fete. She asks Hercule Poirot to join her because her intuition tells her something is off.And, of course, that pretty much guarantees murder is going to be one of the events.
