3.5 Stars. "It's a summer afternoon in Wentworth, Ohio, and on Poplar Street everything's normal. The paperboy is making his rounds; the Carver kids are bickering at the corner convenience store; a Frisbee is flying on the Reed's lawn; Gary Soderson is firing up the backyard barbeque. The only thing that doesn't quite fit is the red van idling just up the hill." Oh boy, what a perfect book cover....and shocking beginning. There is much to like and fear in THE REGULATORS....the summertime atmosph
There is much to like and fear in THE REGULATORS....the summertime atmosphere is so nice....the trip to the open-pit mine in DESPERATION so creepy....young Seth (and his drawings) such a joy, and we have a wonderfully 'spirited' ending, BUT.......(For Me), the silly dialogue and asinine behavior of some of the characters during times of death and destruction disrupted the flow of the true horror of the story....the convoy of bad dudes with guns....burning houses....power outages....creatures that materialize out of the mist....and all in the middle of a thunderstorm....It just kind of diminished the fear factor.
Sort of, cause these two places don’t really exist – until you open the pages of this book, where the weird becomes scary, the scary gets weird, and an ancient evil entity by the name of Tak takes over a once ordinary residential street.)But what I like most about reading Stephen King is the thing that was semi-missing here - my complete investment in the characters he creates ---- by the way (and I think most know this), Richard Bachman and Stephen King are the same person.
The parts linking this book to Desperation.
First, I'm having real troubles understanding the idea with a Bachman tie-in to a King book at this late date.
After the initial kind of cool feeling of unreality and trying to grasp an understanding that lurks just out of reach, pretty soon the re-use of characters and the 'parallel' story line boils down to just making you wonder why.Still, I found this to be a better (and certainly more fun) read than Desperation, enough depth are given to the characters to make them interesting to follow and the explanation for the incredibly violent "Regulators", wrecking havoc on a calm neighborhood is quite tickling of the imagination.
Anyway, having read Desperation prior to The Regulators, I was not able to enjoy this book nearly as much.
We're pretty much dealing with the same bad-guy, and the same characters, only told from a different place and from a different perspective.
It's not that I don't like cross-overs or stories that tie in together; I actually love it, and King is a master at it.
My problem was the actions and dialogue among some of the characters during the course of the story.
This unrealistic actions distracted me from the seriousness of the moments that had built up.All in all this was still a pretty good book.
I do like it when books incorporate different types of reads such as articles, journal entries, drawings, etc and this one definitely does that, giving us a bigger picture of how everything evolves.
I feel like King/Bachman has a tendency to like things that lay dormant and come out with a vengeance.It's not until the last few scenes where things go up a factor of craziness and we get an idea of what finally is going on and why that it really pulls me in and ups my feelings for the book.
Love.Now on to read Desperation and see if I still feel the same about that one too.
Desperation has a kind of gritty, realistic feel, with fantastic elements regarding what Tak is and is capable of, and the divine intervention of God to help the group.
There will be spoilers for both The Regulators and the last Dark Tower book, so stop reading now if you don't want to be spoiled.
So, with the alternate plane reference, and the characters dying and coming back to a different time and place, and the letter's date, we have definite links to the world of the Dark Tower.
I remember the beginnings of almost all of his novels surpassing the endings as far as my interest in King's writing goes.
Especially, the earlier stories which, from what I recall, he wrote in his drug addled college days.
I don't know why I'm writing about this right now.Unfortunately, I spent a majority of my grade school days reading only Stephen King.
I'm thankful to my mother in many ways because when I would see her with one of this things in her hand, my curiosity usually got the best of me.
This one was a miss, in my opinion but there is still enough here to make it worth the read.I had already read Desperation, the companion book to this volume, and came away with the feeling that I had just experienced a pretty good King novel.
Really, they are two seperate books.In this novel, King definitely displays his famous talent for scene setting.
The opening chapter is one of the best I've read, setting the stage for the coming horror.
King uses a great mechanism to deliver the horror this time.
I guess I was expecting the same characters to survive.Overall, a middle-of the road King entry.
Read by Frank Muller Muller gives this so much energy.
As Gabby says in her review, this is a compliment/companion to Desperation so that must mean we have to revisit the music I chose for that read.4* The Shining (The Shining #1) 3* The Stand4* It5* Misery3* Carrie5* The Ginslinger3* Pet Sematary4* 11/22/633* 'Salem's Lot3* The Green Mile3* Needful Things3* Cujo4* Different Seasons3* Christine5* The Drawing of the Three (The Dark Tower, #2) TR The Dead Zone3* Firestarter5* The Waste Lands (The Dark Tower, #3) 3* Wizard and Glass (The Dark Tower, #4) 2* Dreamcatcher4* InsomniaTR Wolves of the Calla (The Dark Tower, #5) 4* Doctor Sleep (The Shining #2) 3* Desperation TR The Talisman (The Talisman, #1) 4* Four Past Midnight 2* The Tommyknockers 2* The Mist3* Mr. Mercedes (Bill Hodges Trilogy, #1) 4* Hearts in Atlantis3* Rose Madder3* Joyland4* Full Dark, No Stars 4* Nightmares And Dreamscapes 2* Lisey's StoryTR Black House (The Talisman, #2)3* From a Buick 8 3* Revival3* Just After Sunset 3* Storm of the Century: An Original Screenplay 1* UR3* Blood and Smoke 3* Children of the Corn 3* A Death
There's no Stalky Little Boy. Never was. There's a THING inside of Seth--not an id, not another manifestation of his personality, not a hitchhiker, but something like a tapeworm. It can think. And talk. It talked to me today--it calls itself Tak.  This novel is a companion novel to Desperation which I read earlier this year, and I have to say, I enjoyed this one so much more. The story in this one was more linear and easier to follow, and the characters are all more real, less caricatured vers
Tak uses these fictions and ideas in Seth's mind to create a very real horror on the streets of Wentworth, Ohio in order to terrorize, control, and eliminate all who stand in its way.
The mining town of Desperation is still mentioned here, and it is exactly the place where Seth comes into contact with Tak, just like the men in Desperation.The thing about these books that are so completely filled with mindfuckery is that they each lie on a different plane of existence.
Every character in this novel acts out of fear, and Tak grows stronger.
Fear is the mind-killer.And so is Tak.
Excellent. While this was the third time I've read The Regulators, it's the first time I read it immediately after Desperation.It's fun to compare the two while reading, to see what scenes are similar and what characters change roles.But this book is more enjoyable to me than Desperation, as it has a much quicker edge-of-your-seat pace.
Not a bad story, but not very memorable, either. The Regulators is typical Stephen King, with a small town setting and things that aren't always as they seem.
The Regulators and Desperation are also quite deep but, excellent read from the master Stephen King.🐯👍
I read this many years ago and absolutely loved it, I would not re-read books but I'd make an exception for this one.
Veoma mi je drago i velika je sreća da sam prvo pročitao Očajavanje od Kinga, pa tek onda ovu knjigu, jer sve te reference i paralele su tako brilijantno urađene.
Sad ko je od koga kopirao ideje, necemo saznati, jer je Bachman ipak dugo mrtav :)Ono što je kod ove knjige prednost je to da akcija odma počinje,kao i obično kod Bachmana, već nakon par stranica.
Još jedan veliki plus je toliko orginalnih i otkačenih ideja, da se zaista pitam da li je Bachman bio dobar u glavi.Nadajmo se da jos negdje ima koja knjiga od Bachmana, u nekim kutijama kao i ovu.
As I was reading, I almost wished i could stop because it was just too scary.
I'm really scared of being in a situation where it doesn't seem like there's a way out.What Stephen King/ Richard Bachman does in this book is explore the unnatural beings in the Dark Tower universe and the imagination of a child.
The story has the feeling of a juggernaut, it grows and grows and grows, unable to stop until its destroyed everything.
The description at the beginning of summer and the neighborhood is, seriously, a thing of beauty.
The storm in the book (literal) plays this key role, but very subtly.
Disfrute mucho este libro de King y aunque no es lo mejor de este autor es delirante, sangriento y muy muy entretenido. Libro espejo de Desesperación el cual leí hace mucho tiempo pero estoy segura que me gusto mucho menos que este, donde no dire mucho para no hacer spoilers pero es imposible imaginar algo más extraño y quizás por lo mismo aterrador.
VERY cool to read upon finishing the companion book, 'Desperation'; although this one is not quite as...deep or as layered as 'Desperation', which, frankly, had much more story and better character development.
I think that of these 2 novels, 'Regulators' is the weaker book, and maybe this is why Stephen King relegated *this* title to his pseudonym instead of to 'himself'!
The entire sequence of events in this novel occur over the span a mere two hours and in the same setting of just one street, and that is all.
Not much for setting and really fast pacing/timing.
There is not enough TIME for character development, dammit!
Sinceramente es una novela que está muy simplemente escrita.
No tiene una narración compleja y de calidad sino más bien pobre y con carácter aficionado.
Con esto quiero decir que no se esperen la misma calidad literaria de otros libros de este autor, porque de eso mismo carece.
Con respecto a la historia tengo que decir que es muy buena.
Creo que ésta es la novela -junto con su par Desesperación- más cruel y desalmada de King.
King no tiene piedad.
Este relato posee escenas que te van a romper el corazón y vas a decir ¿En serio, King, en serio?
Leggi la mia....InstaRecensione!Metti mi piace e aggiungimi se ti fa piacere!Come prima lettura di questo Halloween come non buttarsi sul re?
Avendo già letto in tenera età l’attualissimo IT ho deciso di scoprire la famosa duologia che mi ero lasciato indietro da tempo.
Tuttavia non credo che leggerò Desperation in tempi brevi.
Non mi ha certo deluso ma questo libro è un accozzaglia di caos frenetico e violenza gratuita che mi ha fatto ripiombare nel cinema horror di serie B degli anni 80.
Consiglio di non perdersi dietro ogni singolo personaggio tra i millemila che si presentano perché...
va beh dire perché sarebbe spoiler...
I’ve tried a half a dozen times to re-read this book and I just can’t get into it.
Even the audio, narrated by Frank Muller (one of my favorite narrators), couldn't hold my attention.I remember not liking it the first time I read it in the nineties, but at least I managed to finish it.
Not this time.
It goes against the grain to give up on a King novel but honestly, it's just aggravating the crap out of me and giving me a headache.Although I've marked it DNF I hope to come back to it at a later date…maybe.
Ο βασιλιάς παίζει την πραγματικότητα με την φαντασία, με την τηλεόραση και τους ήρωες της ως μπάλα. Δυσνόητο στις πρώτες σελίδες με πολλά ονόματα και χαρακτήρες, πλην όμως ένας πραγματικός Στήβεν Κινγκ που σίγουρα θα ικανοποιήσει τους φίλους του
I’m torn with this one.
So I’m going with 3.5.
I like the story; I only wish that King would have used different characters from Desperation.
My guess this could have been George Stark’s version of the same characters.
On the plus side; this format works, as the pace is fast for me as I’m a slow reader but at least I read.
Also this was a perfect read for this hot summer we just went through since the elements were easily identifiable.
I do like incorporating the seasons with my reads and King does a nice job of capturing the heat of summer.
This is the companion book to Desperation, and although it's listed here as being written by Stephen King, it was actually Richard Bachman.
As a testament to his skill, after that point, I was able to keep them straight, and even their faces slowly changed from what I had pictured to who they were in this book.The story is about Seth Garin, an 8 year old autistic who has been spiritually invaded by "Tak".
I know this is fiction, and only King's idea of what could be behind an autistic face, it was just so sad.
I have a feeling Desperation will be the better book though I'm going to like this one more due to my affinity for old westerns, and this features some of my favorite characters from those.
One or two characters behaving that way would be fine, but there were several, and it interrupted the tension, though I also appreciated the quips.I wasn't sure how much I'd like this after the first chapter because almost all of the characters in the book are dumped right in your lap from the git-go, and I felt like I was watching Our Town...
I've been studying all damn day and believe me The Regulators and Food Sanitation doesn't mix well.
Overall The Regulators was a good novel flaws and all.
I just killed me a large ass turkey.” The guys slightly smarter friend goes, “That's a vulture, a carrion bird.” The guy who shot it would go, “Yeah it'll carry itself right onto my damn dinner table.” Just imagine the bird laying out on the hot Ohio asphalt.
If you though this review was strange, the book is even more so and King, Bachman rather, probably had his mind in the right place at the time he wrote this book.
Likely my least favorite King book.
Weak all around.Writing: 2Typical King fare.
Decent writing, but nothing to go nuts about.Story: 1I...I have no idea what this book was about.
A demon-possessed kid who could project his imagination onto the real world...?
Ummm...yea, I have no idea what the heck was going on.Characters: 2Surprisingly weak for a King story.
No one I could relate to.
Too many cookie cutter suburbanites who weren't fleshed out enough for me to remember who was who.Other Factors: 2Tied to Desperation, which was a better book I think.
Hey, at least it took place in Ohio and not CASTLE FREAKING ROCK.Final Score: 1.75/5
This was my first Stephen King and he hooked me.
"Non sei più solo agli sgoccioli, il tempo è scaduto, punto e basta! Scappa, Aud! Scappa! Corri! Scappa!"."I vendicatori" è, in un certo senso, una versione alternativa del precedente libro "Desperation"; e, non a caso, i due libri condividono anche gran parte dei personaggi. Tuttavia, questo è uno dei peggiori libri di Stephen King (anche se, in realtà, è firmato con il solito pseudonimo di Richard Bachman) ad aver mai letto.Un madornale caos dall'inizio alla fine, troppi sbalzi temporali e lungaggini varie e troppi personaggi che interagiscono contemporaneamente. Da dimenticare...![http://rosatoeu.blogspot.it/2018/04/r...]
