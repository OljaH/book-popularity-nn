We were having a discussion about safety at NASA in another thread and I thought of this book, about half of which consists of an account of Feynman's role in the investigation following the Challenger disaster.
As Feynman said, he was forced to make this dramatic gesture because he felt that the people in charge didn't actually want him to uncover the reason for the crash.
Several technical people back down and say, no, of course not, the real figure is probably more like one in a hundred.
“His most valuable contribution to physics is as a sustainer of morale; when he bursts into the room with his latest brain-wave and proceeds to expound on it with the most lavish sound effects and waving about of the arms, life at least is not dull.”—Physicist Freeman Dyson on Richard Feynman, November 1947While this (never dull) volume isn’t quite as consistently interesting and entertaining as Surely You’re Joking, Mr. Feynman!, I can’t really give it any less than 4 stars because, hey, it’s

It is too late for them to get the spirit when they are in our universities, so we must attempt to explain these ideas to children.”“We are at the very beginning of time for the human race.
But what I am far more certain about is whether there are natural born leaders; I’m sure there are, and I’m sure Feynman was one of them.Something about Feynman’s voice, about his way of seeing and thinking about the world, makes me respond quite automatically.
I’m not sure this says more about me or about Feynman.
For there is something quasi-religious about Feynman’s combination of naïveté, simplicity, and keen wonder at the natural world; there is something indeed mystical about his way of cutting through everything distracting and irrelevant, of putting aside all unhelpful conventions, and getting to the core of the issue.Well, on to the book.
Preface, by Ralph Leighton--"What do You Care What Other People Think?" Further Adventures of a Curious CharacterIndex
Not as good as Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!: Adventures of a Curious Character, but it is still a gem.
Part 1 of the book (A Curious Character) contains roughly 9 essays spanning Feynman's life.
Part 2 (Mr. Feynman Goes to Washington) details Dr. Feynman's time on the Roger's Commission investigating the Challenger accident.
While not the Manhattan Project, Feynman's work on the Roger's Commission provides an amazing vehicle for looking at Feynman's unique way of tackling a project.
At the end of the book, Feynman includes a beautiful essay on "The Value of Science".
My husband passed away in June of 2012 and he had very much in common with Richard Feynman.
So when I came across the audio version of Feynman's WHAT DO YOU CARE WHAT OTHER PEOPLE THINK I really wished I had found that before my husband's passing.
I think my husband would very much enjoyed the short autobiography.
On the first CD, Richard Feynman speaks of his very first love and his very first wife that was cut short with her passing.
My husband and I had only been married 14 1/2 years when he passed away unexpectedly.
هذا الكتاب هو عبارة عن مجموعة من القصص والرسائل التي كتبها عالم الفيزياء الأمريكي ريتشارد فاينمان.
هناك ذكر سريع لانجازات فايمان العلمية ولكن التركيز الأساسي هو على حياته الشخصية.القسم الثاني من الكتاب يتحدث عن كارثة المكوك تشالينجر الذي النفجر بعد انطلاقه بقليل ومات رواده السبعة.
يلعب فاينمان دوراً أساسياً في اللجنة التي شكلها الرئيس الأمريكي ريجان للتحقيق في أسباب الحادثة.
ويروي لنا فاينمان هذه التجربة ببعض التفصيل.في النهاية هناك كلمة لفاينمان ألقاها حول أهمية العلم وهي من الكلمات التي تكرر له بشكل كثير حيث يشرح فيها طبيعة العلم ولماذا هو مهم بالنسبة للبشرية.
He also emplasises something I believe, but have never seen written about explicitly before - that one huge contribution of science is the realisation that it's entirely possible to live your life and make decisions while not being sure, even about fundamental things.
This essay is essential reading for young scientists (what are your responsibilities to wider society?), and anyone interested in philosophy (without the jargon).Also really interesting is his account of being on the committee that investigated the Challenger disaster - a cautionary insight into how bureacracy can go badly wrong in even well-meaning organisations.I'm unsure how much of his autobiographical stuff is exaggerated, and I am not sure how easy he would have been to live with!
Solo las cartas familiares me aburrieron un poquitín.La segunda parte también me gustó, pero quizá sea un poco árida para los que no son tan fan ni de la ciencia ni de las políticas relativas.
Es sobre por qué falló el Challenger y cómo Feynman colaboró en la comisión de "arreglo" y, al estilo de Asimov, mezcla lo humano con lo divino, porque habla tanto de los métodos descubrimientos duros, como de las personas y cosas cotidianas.
Y con gracia.La tercera también habla de ciencia, y es una preciosidad.
Feynman refuted the notion that scientific quest deprives life of poetry, as many used to argue in the past (fortunately, things are less so nowadays):” Poets say science takes away from the beauty of the stars — mere globs of gas atoms.
The vastness of the heavens stretches my imagination — stuck on this carousel my little eye can catch one-million-year-old light.
The book is divided into two parts "A Curious Character" which deals with the people who influenced Feynman the most; his father and his wife Arline.
It's not all sad though Arline very much enjoyed seeing Richard succeed but made sure he stayed grounded and they both knew how to make what little time they had together count.
Sixteen months after her death Feynman wrote this touching letter to Arline.
Feynman's father was not from a scientific background but ignited a love for the subject in his son.The second part of the book which I didn't enjoy so much concerned the investigation of the shuttle Challenger disaster.
Even Feynman's investigation was frustrated by the same problems.
This book, like the one preceding it, Surely You’re Joking Mr. Feynman, is a transcription of recordings made by Feynman’s drumming partner, Ralph Leighton.
I was afraid the book would end on a bad note with the somewhat vapid speech at the end, but there were some quite deep insights in there as well, and his closing remarks about not suppressing discussion and criticism was a perfect way to end it.Overall, not as meaty as some other books of this genre, but it was a quick entertaining read, and left me with many lessons I will carry with me.
Loved every bit of the words <3What a curious character he was. It was total fun learning from his delightful, hilarious, flamboyant experiences. However the epilogue touched my mind very profoundly regarding hia contemplations on the value of Science! It was an unfathomable feeling occupied with his ideas. "We are at the very beginning of time for the human race. It is not unreasonable that we grapple with problems. But there are tens of thousands of years in the future. Our responsibility is to do what we can, learn what we can, improve the solutions, and pass them on."

"Wonderful anecdotes from a brilliant mind "A mixed bag of fascinating stories that fill in any of the gaps from Fyenman's life that weren't covered in Surely You're Joking Mr Feynman. Insightful and touching. Albeit very scattered and not particularly chronological
Ilgi svārstījos starp 3 un 4, bet beigās sapratu, ka tik labi jau arī nebija. Bet bija labi. Grāmata kā krāsains personības nospiedums, bet mazliet par īsu un random, lai izvilktu līdz pavisam labai biogrāfijai.
Starting now as 1st of Feb 2016 and go backward:- Finished the book, the large emphasis is placed on Feyman's ''suicidal journey'' with Washington investigation of Challenger disaster 1986.
I do enjoy them but not as much as his life journey and the end where he philosophized about life and science.-A few months ago,Moving Bodies provided me a glimpse into Feyman's life.
The story of a brilliant scientist who loved his wife so much that they both knew she was gonna die from tuberculosis but still got married and had their contented mortal time together..
17 Nov. 2017 - I read this about 30-35 years ago and loved it, just after reading the earlier autobiography by Feynman "Surely you're joking, Mr. Feynman."Both books were a pure joy to experience.
He was so good at seeing, then demonstrating clearly, some basic truths that needed telling.
You will be amazed at how simple and effective good creative communication can be.I recommend this book, and it's earlier companion: "Surely you are joking, Mr. Feynman?" to everyone, especially young people, who need a boost in reasoned self-confidence.Thank you Ross Overbeek, for investing in me with the earlier book.

To every man is given the key to Heaven. The same key opens the gates of Hell.
very soothing.
It’s Feynman. There’s nothing more to say.
It was an amazing read. Richard Feynman is seriously goals for me 😂
A big part of this success comes from his persona which combined incredible brilliance with the irreverent and down-to-earth attitude to most problems in life, be they "big" ones like working on the atomic bomb, or the everyday ones that almost all of us are familiar with.
His earlier book "Surely You're Joking Mr. Feynman" was a classic and an inspiration to generations of young scientists who were shown that you can have lots of fun while pursuing a life in science.
Some of these had been told by others over the years, but in this book they all come together in a single volume as told by Feynman himself.
We played with them, my father setting them up vertically on my highchair like dominoes, and I would push one end so they would all go down."Part 1 involved mainly of the scientist in the making with travel experiences during various conferences around the globe.
When young, Feynman interest in Science took its root because of his father.
As Feynman has said, if his father brought science in his life then his mother taught him compassion and laughter.
Being a renowned professor and scientists of that time, he suggested to questions the big shots at higher levels in NASA like the management at the lower levels.
It is our responsibility to leave the people of the future a free hand.
If we suppress all discussion, all criticism, proclaiming “This is the answer, my friends; man is saved!” we will doom humanity for a long time to the chains of authority, confined to the limits of our present imagination.
It is our responsibility as scientists, knowing the great progress which comes from a satisfactory philosophy of ignorance, the great progress which is the fruit of freedom of thought, to proclaim the value of this freedom; to teach how doubt is not to be feared but welcomed and discussed; and to demand this freedom as our duty to all coming generations."
He's known for being able to explain complex ideas in layman's' terms without resorting to technical terms or vague explanations.
Not as lists of facts and vocabulary words.And yes, I did enjoy the second part of the book about Feynman's participation in the Commission that investigated the shuttle disaster.
Sometimes, it's omitted altogether, while at other times a list of brainstormed ideas is generated, but it's never used appropriately, which is what seems to have frustrated Feynman.
Ah well, I'm in good company.Now I want to read "Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman." (I think I'm reading these books in the wrong sequence.)
Even in such a trying situation, Richard and Arlene's positive and pragmatic personalities shine through and inspire.The second half of the book contains stories from his time on the Rogers Commission, investigating the causes of the Challenger space shuttle explosion.
What really sticks out for me in this book is Feynman's curiosity in all aspects of life around him and his energy to pursue this curiosity.
His enjoyment of science and of learning in general is inspiring.Reading Feynman's tales, it's easy to start believing that anyone with the desire and energy to pursue their passion can have extraordinary experiences.
