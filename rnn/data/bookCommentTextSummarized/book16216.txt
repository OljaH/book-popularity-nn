This is a hard book to read - not because the language or ideas are lofty (just the opposite, the ideas have been made extremely accessible) -- the reason this book was hard to read, is because it nearly forces you to take a hard look at the way you live, the way you treat others, and the way you navigate through business, personal, and other situations.
The biggest take aways from this book, in my humble opinion, are that we often are at least part of the cause of the problems that we *blame* on others.
You come away from this book not self-condemning, but enlightened, and with a renewed vigor in trying to mend personal relationships, and thence professional ones.
Good principles, a good teaching tool for organizations, but painful to get through.I assume the story format is aimed to make the read easier to get through and understand, but instead it felt like a local TV commercial with a bad script.
The box metaphor and story format will hopefully be condusive to a group discussion among team members of an organization, but if you are reading on your own to improve your relationship skills at work, there must be something better.
I know a lot of people who really love this book. It takes complex ideas and presents them in an easy-to-follow format. Which is fine if you're 10 years old. I felt like it was dumbed-down and assumed the reader is less than intelligent. Despite its big print, simple sentences, and few pages, it was a struggle to make it to the end. Want the same ideas presented to competent adults? Check out "Bonds that Make Us Free" by C. Terry Warner.
long-winded (pages-long) pseudo-explanations of new concepts and jargon that only muddy the waters more, like this excerpt:“By blaming, I invite others to get in the box, and they then blame me for blaming them unjustly.
But because, while I’m in the box, I feel justified in blaming them, I feel that their blame is unjust and blame them even more.
So, by being in the box, I invite others to be in the box in response.
And others, be being in the box in response, invite me to stay in the box.”
I read this book in one day...I just couldn't put it down.
An excellent book on how to be a better person and leader.
I think I will buy this book for each of my adult children to read.
It is also a MUST read for leaders in business, especially if you are involved in Network Marketing.
Really it is a must read for anyone who wants to make quantum leaps in reaching results in attaining their goals.I want to thank my son-in-law Brett Taylor who loaned me the book to read.
Thank you for thinking so good of me.
Last year I read Anatomy of Peace and figured it made sense to close the circle on the "box" and read the book that started the whole Arbinger/Self-Deception/Leadership thing.
Terry Warner's name while reading this book.
The book isn't written by one person, but rather by an organization (Arbinger Institute) that was founded by Dr. Warner.
Terry Warner's ideas of self-deception, human emotions, and organizational performance.
I do, however, have a soft spot for the Arbinger books, and do find them to be a bit more useful than most.
READ THIS BOOK RIGHT NOW.I'm serious.I'm not really into management books, but this one was recommended to me by a friend and mentor who I respect immensely.
The concepts the book present are unveiled slowly, through a fictional story.
Tons of real-life examples are used, and the story just makes you wanna keep reading to find out the next step in getting out of the box.
I flew through this book in a couple of days.I won't try to explain the concepts presented in this book; you really need to read it.
I look forward to putting the concepts presented in this book into practice.
The basic premise of the book can be summed up in the following sequence of activities that take place when we make an incorrect decision or act in an incorrect way which essentially doesn’t feel right to us: 1.
2.	When I betray myself I begin to see the world in a way that justifies my self-betrayal.
If people act in ways that challenge the claim made by a self-justifying image we see them as threats.”•	“In the box every change I can think of is just a change in my style of being in the box.
A book that teaches powerful principles that I have already begun implementing to great effect in my own life.
The principles we already know for the most part, and the general truths don't surprise, but The Arbinger Institute has blended and crafted them in such a way as to help us really put it all together.
My favorite and most meaningful insight is that when we are "in the box" it doesn't matter what we do, how helpful or good we try to be, we will end up defeating ourselves.
Anyway, lot's of great stuff.
Bravo Arbinger!
Excellent extended business-oriented parable on what happens when you ignore the instinctual feeling to help those around you.
You either honor that feeling or you betray it.
What happens when you betray it?
It ain’t good according to the book.
It’s self-betrayal that sets off a chain of events that leaves you feeling justified and others looking contemptible.
You wind up calling that your character and living in a warped version of reality with warped results in all your actions.
It has a dated Sunday School feel to it for a book published in 2002 but I won't knock points for that.
I don't know if there's some kind of sub-genre for covertly religious business books, but I feel like there should be.
There's also all the religious subtext of books like The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People: Powerful Lessons in Personal Change.
What it does is reformulate some basic concepts of spiritual / ethical living in totally secular language, and in so doing it actually does a pretty amazing job of conveying some really first-rate, post-modern Christianity in simple terms.I say "post-modern" because the central idea of the book is that we are capable of self-deception.
I would never in one thousand years have picked it up if my dearly beloved husband hadn't read it first and told me that it changed his life.
This book will make you feel like a weasel on one hand, recognizing that so much of our interactions with others are the results of our own decisions to do or not do what we know is the "right" thing to do.
I want to see myself as I really am and I want to openly see those I love as they really are: as people (not objects) with thoughts and feelings and desires just like I have and which are just as valid as my own.
I came into work one day, and this book was on my desk with no note attached.
Was this some passive-aggressive attempt at telling me I'm a bear to work with?
I hid the book under my purse and tried to check my email, but I just couldn't concentrate.[return][return]I peeked into my neighbor's cube and said in just-barely-above-a-whisper, "Hey, I had some book on my desk when I came in.
She wants us to read them before our group meeting in 2 weeks."[return][return]My heart sprung back up to its rightful position in my chest cavity.
No secret message from a disgruntled co-worker, hooray![return][return]But...assigned reading for work?
So I read this back in college because Terry Warner (the author of Bonds That Make Us Free on whose ideas this book is based) was my freshman year philosophy professor.
I've read Bonds that Make us Free like 10 times.
I hated this when I first read it college, but then I just re-read it again because it's short and I wanted a reminder.
And it's like reading beautiful ideas of philosophy (rooted in Buber's concept of I and Thou) and then speaking them through corporate speech.
The book is also so cheesy.
Like taking out the trash?
Why am I always the one taking out the garbage?
In an instant, you conjure up a reality where your inaction is wholly justified: They need to pull their share of the responsibilities and take out the trash more often.
In this new reality you've created, the resentment feeds on itself as you wait for them to do it.
Because they can't read your thoughts.This book is about these moments of self-deception, big and small.
It's honestly a lot more work to reproach someone for not taking out the garbage than just doing it (or talking about it).
The best leadership and business books weave the concepts into a story rather than disseminate them in dry abstract paragraphs.
This is where new leadership concepts are born and revealed.
Getting out of the Box is only possible when we know well the problem with being in the box.If you read only one business book, this would be among my top recommendations.
The core ideas in the book -- what the authors call getting "in the box" toward others and how to get out of the box -- are helpful.
However, two things keep me from giving this book a higher rating.First, the story the authors use to introduce these core ideas to the reader could have been much shorter with higher impact.
Second, two key terms in the book -- "in the box" and "self-betrayal" -- are not good fits for what the authors are describing.
"Self-focus" or "defensive" or a term that was more about betraying others would have been more fitting.
People should read the book.
It gives a new way of looking at our behaviors.
It gives you an option to look at your acting.
By knowing them, you can gradually live a better life, run organizations better.
The book does not give you answers for your problems.
It gives you the truth.I love the "Box" concept and the drawing.
The drawing delivered a big impact on my memory.While reading the book, I reflected, I got so many ah-ha moments.
The book is my environment to open the other sides of the box.
We all have many boxes.
Life changing way to look at the people around us and our influence on them.I have just gone through this book with another student and it has changed his life.
He just apologized to his father for some serious stuff that he would not admit to in the past.
He said he does not like his dad still but needs to treat him as a person because that is more fair.What better endorsement for a book?This is the fourth student I have gone through this book with and it is a great intervention in therapy.
I had better keep track.M. M.
A guidebook for life! This excellent book uses a fictional example to get you thinking "out of the box" in how you interact with others, both in business and in your personal life. This should be mandatory reading for every employee and family member. You find yourself in the shoes of the characters as they go through problems in their lives, realizing that we all have these same problems in our relationships with people. I'll be having my kids all read this! This book will help you, and everyone in any type of organization work better together.
Read for my Professional Development Book Club. Quick read, as much as for personal growth as for professional. Excellent if you are aiming to be a good person and improve the lives of those with whom you live and work, although you could be financially successful without doing any of this...and apparently even become President of the United States.
Good ideas, and a clever way of communicating the ideas while keeping the reader engaged. A little hokey in parts, but it worked good for the subject I thought.
Sự tự phản bội là nguyên nhân đẩy con người vào trạng thái "nhốt mình trong hộp"Sau khi tự phản bội, tôi nhìn nhận bản thân dưới góc độ tự đánh giá5.
Hãy xin lỗi và cố gắng tiến về phái trước, cố gắng trở nên hữu dụng hơn trong tương lại.- Đừng tập trung vào điều người khác đang làm sai.
Hãy tập trung vào điều đúng đắn bạn có thể làm để giúp đỡ họ.- Đừng bận tâm xem người khác có giúp đỡ mình hay không.
It’s not written like a standard work of non-fiction; instead it’s like a novel with one boring cardboard character giving another boring cardboard character a lesson about “thinking outside the box.” Apparently, this is the book that popularized that now extremely cliched phrase.
Now that I’ve actually read the book, I realize I’ve misunderstood the cliche for years.Despite it’s cardboard prose, Leadership and Self-Deception teaches a lot of sound principles of leadership and interpersonal relationships.
It teaches them with clarity, and although it’s not exactly beautifully written, it goes down pretty quick.
Quite an incredible read. Requires introspection while encouraging growth in a reader. Though I picked it up initially hoping to continue my pursuits of being a capable and quality leader, I found the lessons in the book to be applicable to every aspect of my relationships with others. Seems like a good book to reference in moments where I am stuck or frustrated in my relationships.
کتاب در مورد یک مشکل صحبت میکند. مشکل همه آدمها، هر روز. موضوع واقعاً مهم است.با اندکی فکر و مطالعه میتوان به این نتیجه رسید که انسان، دنیا را طوری میبیند که رفتارهایش را توجیه میکند. حرف نوی کتاب این نیست. کتاب میگوید که چطور، اینطور میشود و پاسخ بسیار کاربردی و غیرمنتظره است. اگرچه مطمئن نیستم که درست و یا حداقل کامل باشد.خیلی خلاصهاش این میشود که ما گاهی نسبت به دیگران احساس وظیفه میکنیم، بعد به این وظیفه عمل نمیکنیم و در این هنگام، دنیا را طوری میبینیم که رفتار درست، همان عمل نکردن به وظیفه
موضوع واقعاً مهم است.با اندکی فکر و مطالعه می‌توان به این نتیجه رسید که انسان، دنیا را طوری می‌بیند که رفتارهایش را توجیه می‌کند.
اگرچه مطمئن نیستم که درست و یا حداقل کامل باشد.خیلی خلاصه‌اش این می‌شود که ما گاهی نسبت به دیگران احساس وظیفه می‌کنیم، بعد به این وظیفه عمل نمی‌کنیم و در این هنگام، دنیا را طوری می‌بینیم که رفتار درست، همان عمل نکردن به وظیفه باشد.کتاب واقعاً ارزش خواندن دارد؛ ولی متأسفانه خواندنی نیست.
یعنی در هنگام مطالعه گاهی احساس حماقت به آدم دست می‌دهد و فکر می‌کند که اگر کتاب را ورق‌ورق در آب کله‌پاچه ترید کنند، مغز پخته گوسفند مطالب را یاد می‌گیرد.
I read this for Book Club. It was insightful and I've thought about "the box" a lot since then. Every person in a leadership position would benefit from reading this.
This book gave me a lot to think about in terms of both personal relationships, work relationships, and my day-to-day interactions with others. It is a helpful tool for identifying problems and moving forward with solutions.
A must read book for everyone who thinks he is right all the time and the other person is wrong. A book which serves as a compendium in resolving every troubled relationship in your life.
رائع كرسالة، كان بالإمكان حذف ربع الكتاب على الأقل
