I'm think I liked it because I'm into this kind of thing. I like to see connections throughout the ages. This points out a few of the similarities that are held among the creation stories and even shows some of the connections of poetry style from this babylonian text and hebrew texts.
Interesting,But requires a good deal of knowledge of the literature in order to be really useful. Not for the beginner
The Babylonian Legends of Creation (1921) was an awesome follow-up to E.A. Wallis Budge's previous short book on the subject of the Great Flood and the Epic of Gilgamish called The Babylonian Story of the Deluge(1920).
I don't know if somehow my disgruntlement with the lack of maps and illustrations made it back in time to 1921 or if someone re-edited the book, but happily, my edition of Legends of Creation did include both a map and illustrations of different gods and demons.
What the book is about is several interpretations from different times and regions of the Babylonian story of creation.
Marduk kills Tiamat and fashions the world out of her body that keeps the primordial waters out.
He also created Babylon and the gods of the Anunnaki (which figure in some of the theories that the Anunnaki were beings from another planet that really were responsible for the human race, and someday they will return.) A goddess named Aruru helped Marduk create 'the seed of man.Even cities were part of this version of the creation.A later account (250 B.C.E.) held that everything was dark and there was an abyss and water.
The Seven Tablets of Creation hold that there was a watery deep at the beginning; then demons and Gods came about.
Creation stories are always interesting. There is a lot that can be learnt from history. Shame that parts of the narrative have been lost over the years. Worth reading.
Formatting was bad, but interesting.
