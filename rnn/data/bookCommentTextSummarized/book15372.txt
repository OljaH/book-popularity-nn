The hunt for the Vampaneze Lord continues. Darren and his team of Vampaneze hunters return to Larten Crepsley's home town when they learn that murder victims with all the blood drained from them are piling up. Suddenly, an inspector shows up at their hotel wondering why, after they had enrolled Darren in school, he is not attending and that if he does not begin at once the police would have to get involved. So not only does Darren have to hunt vampaneze, he's got to finish his homework first. T
The hunt for the Vampaneze Lord continues.
Darren and his team of Vampaneze hunters return to Larten Crepsley's home town when they learn that murder victims with all the blood drained from them are piling up.
So not only does Darren have to hunt vampaneze, he's got to finish his homework first.
Even though this book ended with the dreaded "TO BE CONTINUED," it still had a great build to it's own climax.
So in the end it left me with a satisfied feeling.

Zase super díl!!! Moje teorie se sice s tímhle dílem rozplynula, ale nevadí, jdeme dál...
While Darren, Mr. Crepsley, and Harkat are still searching for the Lord of the Vampaneze, mysterious killings bring them back to Mr. Crepsley's home town.
Shan’s writing has always been good, except when there’s no action going on.
This book revolved a lot around Darren so I don’t really have an opinion on the other characters.Things I Didn't LikeThe whole school thing was pretty pointless in my opinion and I didn’t like it.
OverallThis entire book was boring.
You can’t have the action happen at the end while making the reader to struggle through three-fourths of the book and expect them to be happy about it.
THIS BOOK DOES NOT have the same feel as the previous threeThe last few books were so mentally and physically grueling Darren that I couldn't wait for book 8.
This one has a somewhat similar feel for  Tunnels of Blood - a bit of mystery, a bit of whodunit combined with Darren (the character, not the writer) having to deal with (dun dun dunnnn) high school.
I honestly wish more of the series had this feel to it.On a side note, anyone else bugged by his age?
Every book, I keep trying to place his age but there's never enough clues to get it exactly...Blog | Instagram | Twitter
This book contains the reappearance of many past characters, all of whom develop much more. Some of which you will fall in love with and others who you will grow to hate or at least dislike for their motives (yet I am not going to say which characters).Continuing on with their mission against the Vampaneze, more twists occur which leave you wanting more. Another action packed book in the series, leaving you on the edge of your seat and unable to put the book down.
The adventure continues and little by little we get closer to its outcome.
The books are getting more and more interesting, especially given that the odds are getting against them with each instalment.
What I really liked about this book is the return of many old characters and the plot twists regarding them.
I have to say that I’m not a big fan of the “romance” going on, but it serves a purpose for the plot so I’m letting that slide.
I can’t wait to read the next book since I have so many theories about the identity of the main enemy.
So this is the eighth book in the series and I really did like this book so it starts off with Darre
People were killed at night and Crepsley and Darren investigated.
Steve joins Darren for the hunt of the Vampaneze.
Darren later reveals himself as a vampire to Debbie.
Debbie joins Darren and Steve for the fight.
Crepsley comes back later and help Darren pursue the Vampaneze but doesn't trust Steve with him.
Steve show his true side later betraying Darren and his friends.
Darren and his friends took a Vampet and Steve as their hostage and was given a warning by Gannen to leave the tunnels immediately or he'll send Vampaneze to finish them off.
Darren Shan now has to go to a school, he is a man now, but looks like a kid because of his vampire blood.
He wanted to go to the city so he can kill the Vampaneze lord, since Mr.Tiny told them to follow their heart, so they went to Mr.Crepsley old town.
So, Darren went to school while Mr.Crepsley went searching for the Vampaneze.
Then, Darren heard about the Vampaneze in the TV and it killed someone in the same school as Darren.
Darren then knows its the Vampaneze, he went to guard his friends house and caught the Vampaneze.
Darren Shan, a part of an Elite Vampire Squad meant to kill off the Vampaneze, is confronted with a pressing issue: school. While setting up base in a city where the Vampaneze have been known to be active, Darren Shan is noticed by the police and is forced to attend school. But there are other problems, and as bad as it seems, school is only a hinderance…  This was one of my two least favorite books in the series. While it tried to return to the old theme of not fitting in while keeping the fee

While setting up base in a city where the Vampaneze have been known to be active, Darren Shan is noticed by the police and is forced to attend school.
But there are other problems, and as bad as it seems, school is only a hinderance… 	This was one of my two least favorite books in the series.
Other than that, the book was very similar to the last one, so much so it felt like a continuation of the previous one, which I was not very fond of.
The name of this book should be Deja vu'.Darren Shan, Mr. Crepsley, and Harket Mulds travel to Crepsely's home town where they hope to find the Lord of the Vampaneze.
Finally, Darren is saved from the hooked vampaneze by none other than Steve "Leopard" Leonard, his former best friend, who vowed to one day become a vampire hunter and kill him...I love how everything from the first trilogy was tied in here.
I loved that he had to go back to school; I love that Steve; Debbie; and R.V.
So we learn who the Lord of the Vampaneze is, but that's pretty much all. :/I just don't think anything happened in most of this book. Darren wasted so much time in school. What was the point of that, even? Who cares? He's in the middle of a war for his species! He's their prince! And he has to sit through school? What? That's just dumb. And Debbie. Groan. I never liked her. She's a waste of time. And she just butted into their attack then ruined it for them because she was too weak. Never going to like her.
ok so ill be the first to admit that the start of this book didnt have me hooked, out of all things to happen on this quest i doubted very much it would begin with young Darren Shan having to enrol in high school and go to classes, this was a twist that i really didnt think the series needed.
However, as it managed to progress the story line, ill be the first to admit that it worked, not as exciting as a vampire prince travelling the world and seeing new things but given how the story line panned out, it works.
Darren is a half-vampire traveling with Mr. Crepesley. (Mr. Crepesley is a full-vampire) and a little person named Harkat Mulds. They are trying to complete their task of killing the Vampanese lord, that ends up being Darren's friend from when he was human, Steve. When they face off against Steve, he gets away.I think it is a great fantasy book.I recommend it. I also recommend the other parts of the series.
I think this one is by far my favorite book from the series. Darren Shan runs into a vampaneeze named Hooky, Debbie his ex girlfriend, and Steve his ex best friend. I instantly figured out that Hooky was RV, also known as Reggie Veggie. And I had a very bad feeling that either Debbie or Steve would betray him...i should've went with the ladder lol!
¡Y se empiezan a complicar las cosas! Aparecen personajes de los libros anteriores y toman más relevacia en este y los próximos libros, jugando así con mis emociones. Cada vez más cerca del final y ni Darren ni los demás saben lo que les espera :O
I truly adore this series! Try as I might, I continue to make predictions as I read and by the end of the book I realize my wildest guesses cannot come close to the plot twists Shan writes. If you haven't started this series yet, you need to!
I think working together in this book is great, They are following their hearts to defeat the lord of vampaneze with some reasons........
Steve Leonard is Back! Yay! Better and better...
OHMYGOD SO MANY GOOD PLOT TWISTS IN THIS! My love for this series still hasn't changed. Probably one of the best Vampire series I've ever read! I AM SO PISSED BECAUSE OF THE ENDING THOUGH!!!!
Great book. Great character. Great villain. Great plot twist. Dam that vegetarian turn meat eating vamapaneze wannabe Reggie Veggie! BTW, cover scares the crap out of me.
داستان در این کتاب کند پیش میره و خیلی رو اعصاب خواننده هست .
In a way I saw the plot twist coming but it still surprised me! AND WHY THE CLIFFHANGER???
I feel like now, especially since she knows everything, the only clean option is to kill her off which I’m mainly concerned about because I don’t want to see Darren turn into Mr Depressed because his love interest was killed.
Who knows 🤷🏻‍♀️Also I ALMOST BOUGHT INTO STEVE’S ACT MAN I mean I was always suspicious of him but I was starting to think I’d made the wrong guess about him being the Vampanese Lord but now I’m 100% sure.
The second half was interesting with a potential turning point for the rest of the saga, though (knowing enough of what's supposed to happen) only a minor twist if you can even call it that.
Now it's a book about a 30-something half-vampire with the body of a 15 year old who hasn't been in school since he was 13, and the struggles...not to mention the struggles of meeting your old love interest who has aged in real time.
This reminds me of Mockingjay, where the author took a fine two books of a trilogy and then put the main character completely out of the action for 80% of the book.
The story continues from past books, and brings the reader along with Darren as he searches for the Vampaneze Lord.
Throughout the book, you wonder who the Vampaneze Lord is and why Darren seems to be given special attention by him.
This book takes the reader back to a location and characters that have been mentioned before.
His looks also get him in trouble when he does not appear to be going to school, even though there is an application for him.Many mysteries are brought up throughout the book, with very few of them being resolved.
This is a VERY important book in the Cirque du Freak series. Because there are three major characters that make their return, from the first three books. So we haven’t seen them in a long time.Also, Darren is getting the height of the human experience in this book, and it is one of the few things he does *not* miss about being human at all– school . Poor kid. It’s been a little while since I’ve read it, but I think him and Crepsley stay at a hotel somewhere and the paperwork they turn in lets th
It’s been a little while since I’ve read it, but I think him and Crepsley stay at a hotel somewhere and the paperwork they turn in lets the city or county know that there’s a kid, and that he’s not in school…so they must enroll him in school.I absolutely love the part where he has to wear the school uniform, Crepsley and Harkat laugh at him, and he takes his shoe off and throws it at them.
XDDThis book does get a little darker again though, a reminder of what kind of world we’re dealing with here.
I really thought that at least Mr Crepsley would be able to figure out that Steve really was up to no good.
I get that Darren thought that he was his friend but for everybody to just let him just tag along just because he saved Darren's life, that doesn't make any sense to me.
Hopefully in the next book they'll be able to get her back alive but this is the second time they've let the vampaneze Lord go.
They have one more time and then they are doomed.Hopefully they'll use some of their ancient vampire sense to at least try to be more perceptive to what's coming before it happens.
