This classic geography book, by the beloved Charlotte Mason, is also on the Ambleside Online booklist.
(I'm a partner in Blue Sky Daisies, which publishes this reprint--we think it's a very nice paperback.
Be sure to look for the Blue Sky Daisies edition.) Elementary Geography is a collection of very brief lessons, or chapters, that are perfect for reading aloud.
One chapter can probably be read in about 10-15 minutes or less.
Charlotte Mason writes in a very conversational way about the geography of Earth, the solar systems and the seasons, the compass and navigation (latitude and longitude), and the topographical features of our world.
