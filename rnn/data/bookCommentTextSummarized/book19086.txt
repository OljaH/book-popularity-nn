5 Swoon Z Stars First read 2014Reread 4/2/2017Spoilers“You’re like your mahmen,” he whispered. “You make the world go away for me”-ZOMG I can't take all the yumminess of Z. I've melted into a big puddle of goofy fangirl happy goo. To say this little bitty Novella was epic seems weak for the way it made me feel. This story was beautiful, moving, and totally nailed me in the feels. I loved every single minute of it. To read about Z and Bella having their problems after Nalla was born and work thro
To read about Z and Bella having their problems after Nalla was born and work through them coming out stronger on the other side.....OMG it was heartwarming.
Z was having a lot of problems with his pasts and Nalla and I loved how he turned it around and became a amazing father.
I also loved him and Bella who had been having their own issues being able to be alone as a couple since the baby was born come together.
I want more Z, Bella, and Nalla, and I wish this one was longer!"Have you missed my kisses, darling mate?
This was such a beautiful if rather short story.Zsadista & Bella having found each other and now so much more with with their baby Nalla.  Touching and uplifting. It's that feeling of total love and devotion that just gets me about this couple. I absolutely adore them and their baby.

FATHER LOVE..........“Sorry to bother you,” Bella said over the wailing.
“But she wants her daddy.” “Hey, what are you doing, little one?
You want more?
oh, no.” Nalla let out a giggle.
You want more, and you know you’re going to get what you want because of The Lip. Jeez, you’ve got your father wrapped around your little finger, don’t you.
A beautiful novella about Z and Bella having difficulties in their marriage, and finally we see some closure for Z.I cried about 3-4 times and absolutely loved the ending.Simply amazing, not to be missed!
Zsadist and Nalla

I didn’t think I could love Z more than I did in Lover Awakened, but Z finding his place as a father and as a hellren was even better.
He is unbelievably strong as a male but so damn fragile at the same time.
My heart went out to Bella, how hard it must have been to sit back and watch the two most important people in your life act like strangers.
And Nalla, she was a sweet

There was a lot of emotion packed into this novella.
5++ stars - Vampire RomanceI read this story in the BDB Insider's Guide and it is such a beautiful story of what happens after the HEA. I (like so many other BDB series fans) love Zsadist and Bella and their against all odds love story. This is J.R. Ward at her best!
We know Zsadist has demons from his past; will they impact on his role as a Father and a husband?Bella and Zsadist are still dynamite together, with their passion and their fierce love of one another.Is that enough to keep them together...???To see this big strong man with so much fear and emotion was truly touching and very beautiful.
A cherry on the top of an already wonderfully epic love story.If you want the answer to my question then take a peak...(view spoiler)["The male had come back to them ....

Typically I have a hard time jumping around in a series, but there was no way I could pass up more Zsadist and Bella.
The struggles of adjusting to their new family, Z's apprehension and fear of dirtying his beautifully pure daughter, all his demons coming back full force with the realization that she'll have questions about his appearance when she gets older.
She knows he loves her, but she's been through so much emotionally and physically.
I loved watching these two work through their issues.
This is a must read if you loved Lover Awakened. Z and Bella are still my favorite couple to date. They have issues and struggles. It makes them more relatable, more realistic. To me, their story will never end. Ward could write three more books about them and I guarantee that they would be just as touching and beautifully written as the first.Speaking of the writing, it was wonderful. I could quote the whole book. Every line was filled with emotion. It was perfect. I’m so sorry. I love you. Ple

I also loved seeing the shellans play a role in this book.
Mary and Doc Jane were just as wonderful as Bella and Z.
Seeing them help Z was heartwarming.
I loved Jane's tough love.
YOU TELL HIM JANE!5 stars!
Their love had seemed like it would be enough to get them through everything. Maybe it wasn’t. After marriage and a baby, life isn’t always a happily ever after. This was such a beautiful novella about Zsadist and Bella. A quick read, but a powerful read. I think I cried almost the whole time I was reading this... sad tears, happy tears... there will be tears.  ‘I love you... Please don’t leave me.’ Z is one of my favorite brothers, and I love his shellan, Bella. A must read novella for all BDB

* * * * * 5 Z-antastic Stars * * * * *This little jewel tells the story of Zadist and Bella after Nalla is born.
Zadist has become completely wrapped up in taking care of Bella and her baby.Her baby?
I know what your thinking, it takes two to make a thing go right…Well, Z is having some issues coming to terms with Nalla and being a father.
Don’t worry we do not have another Phury situation, Z actually works through his issues and communicates with Bella.
"Their love had seemed like it would be enough to get them through everything.
Maybe it wasn’t." Father Mine is a beautifully crafted novella following the aftermath of the birth of Nalla (Bella and Zsadist's baby girl).
Bella is struggling with being a new mom.
Overall, things seem to be a mess.
Bella has tried everything to bring Z back from the dark.
Despite her best efforts, things aren't getting any better.
“I love you .
“Please don’t leave me.” Bella and Z are by far my favorite BDB couple.
I only wish I could read more of Bella and Z!
This a very sweet story about Z, Nalla and Bella.Zsadist, maybe the most favourite brother, is trying to remove his slave bands and comes in terms with his past life as a slave and his present life as a beloved husband and father.
A sweet little story about Zsadist coming to terms with fatherhood. Ward did an excellent job of portraying both Zsadist's and Bella's insecurities about their new roles in life. Bella is like we've come to know (and love) her: both understanding and tough, while trying to guide Zsadist. The secondary characters -Doc Jane, Mary and Dr Franklin- played small but very important roles in helping Zsadist realize his past doesn't have to influence his future. An excellent addition to the Black Dagger Brotherhood series.
A short story about Zsadist and Bella right after they had Nalla. I like that we see Z still struggling with his past. It isn't realistic to think that someone can immediately heal after so many years of abuse and then reactive self-protection. You can also see both sides of their story really well. Bella is going through a lot with a new baby and a broken husband. She wins a lot of points for her strength.
Aaaaw! I've missed Bella and Zsadist so much! I loved this one, I'm so glad J.R. Ward wrote a short book about my favorite couple and Brother. After finishing Lover Awakened I just couldn't get enough of them. I don't know why I haven't read this before, how could I ignore Zsadist as a father? By the way, that was SO cute and heartwarming! God, I'm so obsessed with the Black Dagger Brotherhood series, I'll probably read the next book now. Once you start with this series, there's no going back.

(hide spoiler)]
BDB Fans this novella is not to be skipped! Father Mine  is less than ninety pages and held so much heart break, love and hope. This female cried sad tears and happy tears as my favorite couple of the brotherhood struggled with the scars of their past and the beauty of their present. ”Of all the places she’d ever been, this was the best one. Right here. With the two of them.”  ”Yes he felt exactly the same. This was his favorite place, too.” SWOON.... I JUST LOVED IT!!!
Zsadist and Bella have a hell of a time trying to achieve happiness but somehow they do.
I could go on and on but chances are if you read this amazing little short story you are well aware of the talented Ward, and this galacticly amazing couple she created.
However, Ward's Zsadist and Bella's life is like watching a blu ray movie on a Digital High Definition Flat Plasma Screan TV.
It sucks though, Ward has created the only Romance Couple that I want to have a never ending series.
I could read about the small nuances of Zsadist and Bella's life forever.
Not much to say about this. It was a decent novella. Pretty short, easy to read, nothing to surprising. I did like the story of Bella and Z which is why I decided to read it, but I probably wouldn’t have read it had it been anyone else.
Happily Ever After is not finished after marriage, and I absolutely agree with this!!Note : Must read Lover Awakened first, so you will understand Father Mine.I really love this story.
In Father Mine, J.R.Ward tell Zsadist's worry on his daughter Nalla and Bella's feeling.
Bella feel Zsadist was so distant from her.Zsadist still have his trauma because his past with Mistress.
He doesn't want Nalla to know his cruel past,and he think he can't be a good father to her.
He can't touch Nalla, and always have nightmares.
And finally Zsadist try to become good father to NallaJ.R.Ward is great (eventhough I dissapointed with Lover Enshrined).
Father Mine takes place after the last chapter of Lover Awakened, but before the epiloge.
This is the story of how Z continues to grew as a person now that Bella has given birth to their daughter.
He goes through the same issues of self doubt in being a good and caring father.
So much so that he avoids his daughter, thinking it would be better that she didn't know his past and how "damaged" he is.
Bella helps him again in finding peace with himself.
This is a short story, but ends on such a high note, it will warm your heart.
J.R Ward managed to get me emotional in less than 100 pages.
Brava!It goes without saying that Zsadist has been my favorite character since the beginning so I was really excited to read this.
But I'm not going to lie, I have never wanted to slap the hell out of Z as much as I did at the beginning of this story.
Bella is a trooper and such an amazing character.
Kudos to her for sticking it out cause I would've lost my mind.Then of course in typical Ward fashion, she flipped it around and fixed it and even managed to make me cry in the end.
Um, hell yes absolutely!
Wonderfull little addition about Z and Bella...my favorite couple ;)
I've actually read this from the which I'm currently reading right now but I'd already finished the Father Mine story.I'd like to say that if you'd love Zsadist you'd definitely love this. I don't know if I'm weird or I'm just really weird that when it came to Z I felt that my heart was melting every time I've read about his struggles and how he's so tortured on the inside. And honestly I did cry on this book, really what's wrong with me? o.O I'm not really a usual crier so that's really is some
o.O I'm not really a usual crier so that's really is something.I'd also want to say that the conflict and the struggles between Bella and Z are really realistic, it's not over the top and I think even if it's fictional, it's something that is also could translate in our world.
I also love Nalla, she's just so cute and cuddly, just want to like cuddle her in my arms.
I just hope that we can get a story/ book where Nalla is all grown up and finding a guy that she love or something like that.All in all it's a good story and highly recommended.
Since the birth of his daughter, Nalla, Zsadist has been regressing further and further into the life he led before he met Bella he is not feeding he won't hold his daughter or talk to her about what's going and to make matter's worse they haven't had sex in months.
When he gets home they talk and he tells her that he is having dreams of his time as a slave and when he is afraid of holding his daughter.
These two has some really hot sex and I thought that it was really sweet how he held Nalla and read to her.
