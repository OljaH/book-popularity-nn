As a genre it would go on to live a fairly short life, plateauing in the late eighties, followed by a handful of peak post-cyberpunk moments in the nineties (Snow Crash, Ghost in the Shell) culminating in The Matrix and then almost immediately fading into relative obscurity.Burning Chrome collects Gibson’s short fiction, mostly published in OMNI magazine in the early eighties.
Our technology makes us chrome and neon and dark inside, but externally we’re living it up on social media while we collectively experience a sort of soul-death alone behind our screens, our modern day mirrorshades.It’s a weird ass world, and these stories give us a glimpse into a stranger one that could’ve been, had just a few things played out differently.
If you're into stuff like this, you can read the full review.Future Technologies: "Burning Chrome" by William GibsonHippies have known about these dangerous technologies for a long time, and the state cracks down hard on them, and not entirely without good reason either.
The world cannot run (for long anyway) on raves and drugs and loud music, any fool can see that.
There is also a false economy in these supposedly 'efficient' economies, because if you run a sustainable event and people attend your event in a car, you can wave goodbye to any benefits you might have yielded from the technology itself.
All the Gibson tropes are there just waiting to bud and bloom.
Gibson's cyberpunk, dark and messy near-future; his obsession with technology, music, clothing; his uncanny ability to describe and name the bleeding edge where culture and technology blend; his noirish tribalism; his satire; his slick style; his curvy asians.
The book is an uneven group of stories that approximate a pimply and adolescent Gibson sitting confidently on a couch ready to hack your future and steal your dated sci-fi pulp.
Is it okay, do you think, to say I find William Gibson's cycle of short stories, Burning Chrome, to be a work of profound beauty?
Probably not, but I'm going to say it anyway: Burning Chrome is beautiful.But how can it be?
How can something like the Sprawl, Gibson's pollution choked mega-city, and our shared technological-future-nightmare be beautiful?
My description suggests it can't, yet I find much beauty in Gibson's future.
And if those aren't beautiful enough for you, consider this: Burning Chrome coins the word "cyberspace." William Gibson imagined it, and computer geeks made it.
Can you beat that for beautiful?
I jacked into the Toronto construct matrix and downloaded Gibson’s Burning Chrome onto my deck, plugged the simstim recorder on and zoned out.Gibson’s Sprawl collection from eighty-six was as lethal as black ice, but my neural implants would keep me dosing through all ten shorts.
Gibson is at his best in the short medium and I wanted to catch it all.Some stories shine on BAMA and others are stand-alones, but all good.
A Tessier-Ashpool goon smashes the deck under his jack boot but I was already done, Gibson’s smooth prose gliding through the pages like chrome.Now it’s off to Chiba City where I think I can find Molly.
Sus historias están repletas de detalles y descripciones que te obligan a permanecer atento en todo momento a lo que te está contando, y su prosa contiene un cierto lirismo a la hora de acercarnos a sus personajes.Estos son los diez relatos incluidos en ’Quemando Cromo’, escritos entre 1977 y 1985, algunos ellos en colaboración con Bruce Sterling, John Shirley y Michael Swanwick:Johnny Mnemónico (*****).
He infused them with ideas and conflicts that continue to grip readers even as the futures these stories depict turn into alternative versions of history.Burning Chrome is a wonderful treasure trove of Gibson's genius.
From recorded personalities lurking just off stage to a man slowly discovering he might not be human after all, Burning Chrome delivers stories that demonstrate Gibson's grasp on the breadth of what science fiction can accomplish.I'm not sure how to describe "The Winter Market." I could say a recording engineer discovers an artist who, encumbered by an exoskeleton and suffering from a terminal illness, uploads herself to a computer.

You can watch William Gibson building the world of the Sprawl ("of cities and smoke"), cyberspace and the characters who would later be explored in the three novels.Equally importantly, you can observe him developing a unique style of writing suited to this world.It's data- and sensory-rich, almost exhausting in its detail, which is revealed without information dumps or definitions.

I seen the error of my ways. William Gibson isn't an easy author to get into and my mistake was jumping directly into Neuromancer without any prior knowledge of his writing. So from now on when somebody asks me if they should get into Gibson I will advise them to start from this anthology. It shows the themes he likes to tackle, his writing style and the worlds he likes to create and is an excellent way to ease new readers into his works.Now, onward to rest of his works!
The stories in this volume pre-date Neuromancer by date of composition, but were published slightly after as a set.
I had no idea that Molly in Neuromancer was also Molly Millions in Johnny Mnemonic (I also didn't know William Gibson wrote that story!
Time to watch the movie....)Burning Chrome is the most significant story in this volume, because it contains most of the ideas and atmosphere that would later become Neuromancer - the cybercowboy, ICE, and the idea of viruses.
The other stories contain similar elements - cyberpunk societies full of commercialized technology, AIs taking the place of humans on multiple levels, and altering brain function in ways we don't currently do (and, of course, more drugs!).
I already knew that Gibson's a writer who really divides readers, and even though I generally prefer the New Wave/cyberpunk school of science-fiction over the genre's "golden age" (for reasons related to writing style rather than political ideology might I add) there were still several surprises.One thing that struck me very much was how unlike the cyberpunk stereotypes the stories found in "Burning Chrome" actually are.
Since that's the angle I read Gibson's work from, I find the so-called flaws many readers find to be my favourite things about his writing style.
Executive Summary: An anthology of 10 short stories mostly related to or set in Mr. Gibson's Sprawl world. I enjoyed some, but not all of the stories. Only worth picking up if you really like the Sprawl books in my opinion.Audio book: 10 stories. 10 different narrators. None of them stand out one way or another. Nobody was excellent and nobody was terrible. A few did occasional voices or accents, but none of them struck as particularly memorable.  Full Review Neuromancer is one of those books th
My favorite story, Dogfight seems like it could be set in the Sprawl, but could just as easily be set in a completely different sci-fi setting.Some of the stories are "near-future" which when read 30 years later don't feel very futuristic at all any more.The other story I really enjoyed was Johnny Nuemonic.
From a literary point of view, this anthology is interesting to read and see how Mr. Gibson was putting together elements of his previous works to come out with Neuromancer, but in my opinion most of these stories can be skipped.3 Stars overall.
Distopia del capitalismo, la raccolta descrive un mondo dominato da una globalizzazione tecnocratica e biomedicale, abitata da fantasmi semiotici e pirati informatici.
Sono bari cinici e variopinti che affollano la metafora di un mondo post-industriale sovrappopolato e angosciante: il corpo incontra la macchina, il sistema nervoso dell’uomo entra in rete, la droga catalizza tutte le esperienze.
E al cuore di questi racconti troviamo sempre la stessa preoccupazione ecologista affiancata alla disillusione nei confronti del nostro sistema economico-sociale.
I film Johnny Mnemonic e New Rose Hotel sono tratti da questa raccolta.
In 2005 my husband and I rented Johnny Mnemonic; it was one of the stupidest films we had ever seen.
Curious to see if it was a problem with the translation to film or the source material, I decided to get a copy of the book: Burning Chrome, the first story being "Johnny Mnemonic." Having now suffered through the entire collection of stories, I can say that both the filmmakers and the author can share the blame equally.I know that there are many fans of William Gibson's books but he doesn't do much for me.
The worst of the stories in Burning Chrome bored me.
This is the fist time I have read anything by William Gibson and I have to say since I have already purchased each book in the Sprawl Trilogy I am really excited to read some more by him, especially Neuromancer; being next on the William Gibson list! "Source Code" ***** "Johnny Mnemonic" ***** "The Gernsback Continuum" ***** "Fragments of a Hologram Rose" *** "The Belonging Kind," with John Shirley ***** "Hinterlands" **** "Red Star, Winter Orbit," with Bruce Sterling ***** "New Rose Hotel" ****

I first read them in the early 90's when they were cutting edge sci-fi and the inspiration for all the cyberpunk and (in my honest opinion) so very much of the new waves of science fiction, space opera and dystopia that have resurrected one of my favourite genera from the slightly fusty reputation they were acquiring.These stories demonstrate the very best of science-fiction, the thing that draws be back and back again to the genera; 'what if' Asks the best science fiction writer, whereupon the reader finds their mind unfolding like origami in reverse as they think in dimensions they had never known were there before...In each one of these stories there is a premise that makes you think about humanity in a way that really is not available in mainstream fiction.
Vat grown assassins, criminal underground trafficking in information, razor girls, heroin addicted militarized dolphins; and that’s just the first story.
There is also hints of a Gibson that could have been, with the perfect Waldrop meets Borges of “The Gernsback Continuum” and “The Belonging Kind” co-written with John Shirley, a stark parable of addiction, social satire, and a surreal horror story worthy of Kobo Abe and Thomas Ligotti.
Some stories are incomprehensible and others have dated elements(tapes and Soviets in space).
But the sprawl stories, the ones I’ve mentioned, and the nasty “Dogfight” make it a good collection.
This is the year of rereading William Gibson, though I read Neuromancer at the same time as a friend last year. Burning Chrome is a collection of stories, some loosely connected to Neuromancer (and the Sprawl setting). I quite enjoyed Burning Chrome and Johnny Mnemonic, both in the Sprawl. I didn't like the Gernsback Continuum. As a collection, I found this uneven.It is perhaps telling that this anthology doesn't make it into the top half of anthologies I have read in the last ten years.
disclaimer: science fiction is one of my least favorite genresOne of the most difficult books I read as most stories were more about the mood and the setting than character development. and I found it difficult to be interested. I could not bring myself to care about any of the characters nor his Japan fetish.
Many of the stories in Burning Chrome are very recognizably Gibson, and many take place in one of the worlds that he explores more fully in his novels.
As he captures these images on film, before they’re gone forever, he begins to hallucinate and, eventually, he wonders if we really would have been happy living in the type of world we envisioned back then.- “Fragments of a Hologram Rose” (1977) is the first story Gibson published and it introduces us to his near-future dystopian America and the “SimStim” technology that’s a major part of his SPRAWL trilogy.
Gibsonovo písanie so mnou nie je najkompatibilnejšie, ale rada ten boj podstupujem :) Viac kyberpunku do môjho čitateľského denníčka!Tešila som sa hlavne na najsprawlovskejší kúsok Jak vypálit Chrome, ktorý predznačil Neuromancera, lenže ten bol zaradený ako posledný, ja som bola disciplinovaná a nepreskakovala, takže som sa dočkala až včera po skoro 5 mesiacoch.Najviac sa mi páčilo Gernsbackovo kontinuum, Zapadákov a Zimní tržiště.
Úlomky, které mohou být posbírány, zvýrazněny…"--- Johnny Mnemonic, 1981(!)(Citát je z Neffovho prekladu, knihu som čítala v Rauvolfovom preklade.)Kniha verzus ekniha:Najprv som mala elektronickú verziu, ale bola tak zle naformátovaná, že sa nezobrazovali odseky, čo u Gibsona znamená, že je prakticky nečitateľný.
Did not finish. Giving up due to the book being too confusing. I didn't understand anything; perhaps I've just been too tired when trying to read it, perhaps I just don't get it.
Gibson appears at the top of his game, showcasing with silky smooth prose his wonderfully creative, gritty slices of a future where the long slippery tentacles of technology seem to create as many problems as they solve. His focus, like usual, tends to society's fringes, the castoffs, the have-nots and their quest through cyberspace for glory and/or riches, and maybe a little bit of righteous justice too.

Recenzja.
I liked The Gernsback Continuum as it was different to Gibson's other stories.
It made more sense, less jardon and is the first non-tech story I've read of his.Fragments of a Hologram Rose had some interesting concepts but I didn't exactly understand what happened at the end.
Mainly because there were a couple stories I didn't enjoy so much or understand what was happening (which is often the case with me and short stories).I do like Gibson's writing style so I am looking forward to reading more of his work as this book and Neuromancer are the only ones I've got to so far.
I remember heading out to get this book after reading Neuromancer, solely on the strength of one story, Johnny Mnemonic (don't waste your time watching the movie - it's awful).
While there's a lot of good work in the book, Johnny Mnemonic is really the show stopper, the tale of a 'mnemonic courrier' who can store data in wetware implants in his skull, and never know a scrap about what he's carrying.
But, reading William Gibson can be compared to sex - it's all good, just some of it is better than others.
A mixed bag, as early-short-story collections often are, and it took me a while to get through the first few - I kept picking up other things to read in the meantime. However, it's worth reading for "Hinterlands" alone, which was totally fascinating and creepy and left me dying to know more. "The Winter Market" was a close second.
Re-read. I liked this volume, but not as much as I did many moons ago when I first read it. After the passage of many years, Gibson's stories seemed less revolutionary than they did before. Not because the WERE less revolutionary, but because the world and literature has changed in the intervening time. All-in-all, still a worthy collection of historical cyberpunk stories.
Story about hacking in cyberpunk genre, but it’s long gone idea of Communists in space in future was most amazing plot twist in that book for me. The thing that it’s published in 1982 makes it very interesting indeed. Its fantasy of the real history past wasn’t too bad, as with drags and espionage in background.
