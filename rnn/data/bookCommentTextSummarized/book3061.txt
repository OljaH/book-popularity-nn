A fresh international perspective of French Revolution
Lefebvre assumes some knowledge of both the Revolution itself and the the late 18th century in Europe more generally, and if you either have no knowledge or aren't quick on your feet when dealing with names and politics - well, this will be a hard book to read.
Me, I'm pretty good on the French side of things, and that's the only way I managed to read this without feeling like a complete idiot.
or wasn't explained at all and you're just meant to understand it, but maybe don't.One of the most awesome aspects of the book is the very fact that it places the Revolution in its broader European context.
The second revolution - of 1792 - was led by those who represented the lower classes, the Girondists and the Jacobins, who represented the sans-culottes (the mob composed of petit-bourgeoisie, aritsans, proletarians).
For Lefebvre, this is not so much an analysis as a series of facts immanent in events.
It's not so much an interpretation as the only way to read the revolution, not so much born out as inscribed in the facts themselves, such as when the National Assembly stated its aim was to destroy the feudal regime in its entirety.
This beats GR. Pretty fucking abstruse. Another too-dense-for-the-tube disappointment.
Part One is particularly interesting, giving a wide-spectrum summary of the European world as it looked just before the events of 1789 - highlighting trends in European philosophy, economics, social structures and foreign policy that contributed to the upheaval that was the Revolution.Unfortunately though, much of Lefebvre's work went over my head as the meat of the book is dry and dense.
I don't know much about the French Revolution and I've had difficulty finding a popular introduction to this time period.
I hoped this would be the introduction I've been looking for, but sadly not.
