To get lost in her poetry is to spend time in paradise. Dame La Mano, what love poems should be.
So good!
Mistral is a magnificent poet but very difficult to translate into English. Le Guin has done an amazing job of compiling such a diverse assortment of Mistral's poems, and should be commended for making them available in the one place. But the translations themselves don't always work, and I found myself shocked at times by Le Guin's flat interpretations of Mistral's short, condensed lines. The decision to cram both Spanish and English versions on the same page was also unfortunate.
I fell in love with a translation of "She with a Missing Finger" when I stumbled upon it in the 1962 volume of the Hudson Review. I had to read more. Gabriela Mistral was a wonderful talent, underappreciated and undertranslated.
loved this poet - I wish that I could have read Spanish to be able to appreciate the original text. Able to to convey such depth of feeling and also able to paint an entire landscape.definitely added to my list of favorite poets!
Ursula is fiercely independent in her translations, what I can make of it, most easily identified for me is the removal of exclamation.
She (according to Le Guin herself and my view of a small sample on poetry foundation) favors a more quiet, weird interpretation which I like a lot, in contrast to other translators who forced meter and/or rhyme and disproportionately accentuated the motherly tone on the work.
Le Guin has no problems removing "recalcitrant" poems from completed collections, a hatchet job on Desolaci√≥n.
She includes the originals which is wonderful, and useful to understand the meter and rhyme if you have enough sense of Spanish to attempt pronunciation if not comprehension.
Ja se smorila.
