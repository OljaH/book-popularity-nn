As always much of the book wasn't put into the movie, but it was understandable because I imagine it would be hard to piece together a movie with all the components this story has.To really grasp and understand the book I would suggest that it be read twice I think.
Since I did watch the movie I wasn't as shocked at things, but I was so impressed about how the author intertwined all the strands of the story together.
The author did an impeccable job of piecing things together to get a wham-bam of an ending.Ok quick summary: Our main character is Sophie.
This book is completely magical and this is how I know:On the fourth of July, we crammed ourselves into our car (my husband, mother in law, two girls, and I) and drove for over an hour to go see some fireworks.
I loved seeing a nineteen year old Sophie, frightened and secluded, throw off all of her fears and embrace being a ninety year old woman, ready to take on anything that got in her way.
I read this to my daughter, Celyn (10 at the time), who is too disabled to read books by herself.I had seen some of the anime film version years ago but remembered basically nothing of it.I found the whole thing original and refreshing.
The story moves along at a good pace and the whole moving castle / multiple doors thing is a great idea and used well.The Welsh connection is well-played, and the continuing reveals keep everything interesting.My only complaint is that the end seemed rather tortured with so many story-lines converging in ways that felt rather unsatisfying / hard to believe.
I have to say I love Hayao Miyazaki's movie better because come on, it's an awesome movie. (Although, Spirited Away is my favorite movie) There were some differences in the book but the movie was based off the book and it's not going to be the same. All that matters is they both were awesome and the author loved the movie too. I absolutely love fantasy worlds that are way out there. Happy Reading! Mel 🖤🐾🐺
For some reason I've been reading a lot of really great books lately.
However, Howl's Moving Castle didn't provide me with that opportunity.It is an amazing and fantastic book.
The characters are so very different, funny, quirky and lovable that I was sucked in right away.
The movie, whilst I really enjoyed it, to the original premise and basic character traits and made its own story from there.Sophie is hilarious.
Howl is funny and sweet as the brilliant yet vain, thoughtless, mysterious wizard.
The whole story is great and I highly, highly recommend it.
This was such an enchanting story!
Howl's Moving Castle, for whatever reason, failed to engage me the first time I read it several years ago, but it worked much better the second time around.
She leaves her dead-end job in the village and, for lack of a better option, moves herself (without bothering to ask for permission) into the oddly mobile castle of the Wizard Howl, where magic and cobwebs fill the air.
Original review: On paper I should love this book, but it just didn't grab me when I tried to read it about 10 years ago,* and I ended up skimming half of it.
HOW IS THIS SO DIFFERENT FROM THE MOVIE?!!? I picked this up on a whim because I adore the Miyazaki film, but this is like a totally different story. And I can't believe I'm saying this about one of my favorite movies, but I like this book waaaaay more.
Before Hayao Miyazaki made "Howl's Moving Castle" into a feature length animated film in 2006 (2004 if you saw it in Japan), it was a book written by Diana Wynne Jones in 1986.
Except that this is not a traditional fairy tale and events soon intervene to set Sophie on a very unexpected course indeed for an eldest daughter.It all starts in the hat shop after some interesting things begin to happen when Sophie talks to the hats she trims.
I just want to say that I do not usually enjoy Middle Grade Fantasy.There is normally an odd quality to the writing style of Middle Grade.
It's crammed full of ridiculous scenarios that end up feeling like it's just a competition of who can be the weirdest.I can see why others enjoy this, but it's generally not my style.
I just couldn't get into that book to save my life, so I generally stay away from this genre except on recommendation.
I loved watching her deal with the craziness in this book!
Howl's Moving Castle is the first novel in the series of books called the Howl Series.
A young woman named Sophie Hatter is the eldest of three sisters living in the town of Market Chipping in the magical kingdom of Ingary, where many fairytale tropes are accepted ways of life, including that the eldest of three will never be successful.
Sophie leaves the shop and finds work as a cleaning lady for the notorious Wizard Howl.
سوفی بخاطر طلسم، به دنبال سرنوشتش میرود، سرنوشتی که او را به قلعه متحرک و عجیب هارو، هدایت میکند.
در قلعه، سوفی با دیو آتش هارو، کاریشیفا آشنا میشود.
After finishing Howl's Moving Castle I immediately Googled “Diana Wynne Jones” to see how many more books in this series I can look forward to.
Howl's Moving Castle is whimsical and charming in the way that reminds me of  Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell.
There is a steampunk styling to the eponymous castle that is not in the book, and the main characters behave somewhat differently from their book counterparts, especially the antagonist “The Witch of The Waste”.Also, Miyazaki's Howl is much less flamboyant than Ms. Wynne Jones', and has a tendency to brood.
Howl’s Moving Castle has been one of my top five favorite movies for years, and I put off reading the book out of fear that it wouldn’t hold up.
But, by the end of the story, Sophie wouldn’t have traded her altered life for anything.The characters in this tiny book are so well developed that they now feel like old friends.
If you love the movie, you should read the book.
Do you see why I waited so long to read it?)Buddy read of the book that inspired my favorite (non-Disney) animated movie with the lovely Mary.
But sadly the characters were flat and I felt nothing for any of them, though I think Howl was the most wonderfully developed of the lot.
No spoilers, but I was expecting a lot more than what I felt we were given, particular since the thing is in the title.
There didn't seem enough given to link all the places together and they invariably ended up becoming just the one place after a while.Despite not quite enjoying this particular book, I do want to read everything else Diana has written, because you can clearly see her amazing imagination and clever storytelling prowess from this book.
Not knowing what to do or who to go to, she continues heading outside of town and ends up walking to Howl's moving castle.Howl's known for stealing little girls away, but she figures that's no longer her problem, she's old now...and who better to help her out than a wizard.This really is such an endearing tale, I enjoyed the characters so much and I'm excited to have also found out that there are two more books to follow.
I read  Howl's Moving Castle at the most perfect time.
All the jokes people send me on Goodreads, I do laugh, and repeat them to my husband when I can.
Thanks to all who send me a joke!
Sometimes I did feel confused reading the novel, but I think 1) we were just as confused as the main character, Sophie, and 2) magic can solve any puzzle.
Howl's Moving Castle is delightful, fun, magical book that should be a must read.
I hope you all to have a good time reading her novel, or watching the film.
Irrationally frightened, Sophie flees the young man’s advances, only to irritate a mysterious old woman—and suddenly Sophie herself is transformed into an infirm old hag.Unable to explain her metamorphosis and afraid to approach her family in this altered form, Sophie decides to leave town in pursuit of the one person who can help her: the great wizard Howl, whose moving castle recently appeared as an ominous blot on the horizon.
She spends most of the book trying to piece together the nature of her own curse, and the secret that Calcifer cannot fully reveal.At first Howl, a handsome but rather foppish young man, appears to enjoy a carefree existence of fine clothes, using magic for fun, breaking the heart of every girl he meets, and shirking the responsibilities that come with his accomplished wizard status.
Toda decidida, coge sus pertenencias y emprende su propio camino en busca de fortuna y una nueva vida, topándose con el Castillo ambulante del peligroso mago Howl.La novela está narrada en tercera persona a través de un narrador omnisciente, presentando un lenguaje sencillo y ligero, donde cada capítulo nos cuenta una escena en la vida de Sophie.
Me encanto además la naturalidad con la que se presenta la magia o los hechizos en el mundo de la novela.Lo mejor de la novela son sus personajes, Sophie y el mago Howl se comen las hojas, aunque el carisma de Calcifer o la ternura que desprende Michael también son notables.
Howl's lingers with me because of the humor, because of the perfectly executed twisting plot, because of the snapping dialog. Diana is possibly the best writer of her generation but because she wrote mainly YA in a time before HP she was disregarded. You want to know what I think a book should be like? Read this one.
I wouldn't be able to come up with a list of all the things that I wanted in a book (if I could I'd write better stuff than I do to amuse myself).
(The sequels to Howl's are not special in any way, to me.) How to write a good ending?
I believe this kinda shit can happen, just like she did.I hated that the Miyazaki anime made the point of the story that Sophie thinks of herself as being beautiful (as an image).
Don't waste your own story time on making bitter jabs at other people.
Quite different from the movie but no less fantastic.Needless to say, I loved it.
And I profoundly thank Sveta for sharing with me one of her favorite books, as it is now one of my favorites, too.Even "happy ever after" carries the truest ring of reality, in that we are all flawed specimens.
That there is someone out there who has stolen your heart as you have stolen theirs and it might be a wild and crazy adventure just to be together, but hey, who wants life to be boring, anyway?Recommended for everyone, especially lovers of fairytales.Now I must see the film!Buddy read with the wonderful Sveta.
Delightful a'f, I don't know what more you could want in a whimsical fantasy-This book will appeal to every age group and gender. -It's simple yet extremely well plotted-You can read it in one sitting!-Doesn't rely on tropes at all, it's its own original story-You will feel joy throughout the entire bookI highly recommend this.

You won't find here a passionate romance or gruesome deaths, but this book will mend your grown-up heart and put some believe in wonders, kindness and love in it.Can't say the same about the cartoon which I've seen only today.
Sorry, the book is a million times better.Okay, let's talk about the story...We have a mysterious mage who, if you believe in rumors, eats the girls' hearts.
Haulov pokretni zamak je izuzetno kreativna i šarena bajka koja čitaoce ne ostavlja ravnodušnim. Glavni likovi su izuzetno maštoviti i trodimenzionalni, a pejzaži kojima lutamo zajedno sa njima poprilično živopisni.Čitaoci na momente mogu predvideti neke stvari, ali to ni u kom slučaju ne može da naruži lepotu ovog romana. Dajem čistu peticu Haulovom pokretnom zamku, a na listu stavljam nastavak.Šteta je što roman nije nešto naročito promovisan i popularizovan u Srbiji i što je tek nekih dvadeset godina nakon nastanka dobio svoj prevod.
Sencillamente mágico!
Un libro catalogado como infantil o juvenil pero que gustará sin importar la edad del lector.El castillo que crea la autora es increíble, con sus puertas que dan a lugares diferentes a tiempos diferentes e incluso a dimensiones diferentes.
Siempre pensamos que tenemos mucho tiempo, que podremos hacer lo que verdaderamente nos gusta en algún momento en el futuro, dando por hecho que vamos a disponer de ese futuro cuando, lamentablemente, esto no siempre es así.
El libro tiene una profundidad que la película, que tiene que cuidar su extensión, no tiene.Sabemos mucho más de la familia de Sophie y de Howl.
وای وای وای.. من از قبل اینکه برم سراغش هم میدونستم خیلی خوبه. ولی نه دیگه درین حد! :O-oروایت بینهایت ساده، روراست و واضحه. اینقد که تا وسطای داستان، فک نمیکنی اینروایت سهل و ساده بخواد بهیهشاهکار ختم بشه. ولی در نهایت، میبینی تمام چیزهای کوچیک و ساده، بذرهای نهال بزرگی بودن که آخر داستان بهش میرسی. بعد هم شخصیتپردازی معرکهی نویسنده که جداً اگه کسی میخواد شخصیتپردازی یاد بگیره، اینکتاب یکی از بهترین نمونههاشه. بهقدری شخصیتها واقعی و باورپذیر و دوستداشتنین که نمیتونی تصور کنی همه اینا یهداستانه!
ولی در نهایت، می‌بینی تمام چیزهای کوچیک و ساده، بذرهای نهال بزرگی بودن که آخر داستان بهش می‌رسی.
بعد هم شخصیت‌پردازی معرکه‌ی نویسنده که جداً اگه کسی می‌خواد شخصیت‌پردازی یاد بگیره، این‌کتاب یکی از بهترین نمونه‌هاشه.
فقط یه‌داستانه!و بعد هم دیالوگ‌ها.
من چقد تحت تأثیر دیالوگ‌نویسی نویسنده قرار گرفتم ینی؛ بارها و بارها بعضی دیالوگ‌ها رو می‌خوندم یا حتی بر می‌گشتم عقب که فلان‌دیالوگـو یه‌بار دیگه هم بخونم.
اصلاً انگار نویسنده تو یه‌دنیای دیگه زندگی می‌کنه که همه این‌اتفاقا می‌افتن و این‌قد قشنگ تونسته درشون بیاره.
نکنه همچین دنیا- بهتر بگم، دنیاها!- یی هس؟ برام الهام‌بخش بود.
دنیا به‌چنین دنیاهایی احتیاج داره!
One of the best fantasies, and a clever mystery besides. Read it, for probably the 10th time, but this time I read it aloud to my 7yo. He loved it, though I did have to explain a few things. I would love a Calcifer of my own.
This is the first book that I read to my daughter.
She may not be a captive audience...actually, scrap that.
STOP TORTURING ME!" I'm assuming it was the former.This book was chosen because it is one of my wife's favourites.
And what better book to read to your child than my wife's favourite.
And my wife enjoyed my reading "to the baby".
And I enjoyed reading "to the baby" too.The story is a fantasy, not a simple fantasy, but many familiar fantasy tropes turned around, viewed from a skewed angle and reinvented.
This is a book you'd want to read to your daughter.
