Half the people that come to "investigator" Parker Pyne for help are just bored.
So, his clients are often people with money who want someone else to make life interesting again for them...That is difficult for me to swallow.
I tend to loath people who say, "I'm bored" and I feel "killing time" deserves capital punishment.
In these short stories, Pyne sets up thrilling adventures and minor mysteries to put a little pep in his client's lives.
Pyne is no Poirot, other than his girth, but occasionally Christie can't help but mix in some of that crafty Belgium's cleverness.
Parker Pyne is a different specimen from the Christie universe.
He is not your conventional detective, but a person who provides "happiness"; his ad in the paper says: "Are you happy?
If not, consult Mr. Parker Pyne." Having worked in the Statistical Bureau his whole life, Mr. Pyne knows that unhappiness can be classified under six heads - no more, no less.
That said, apart from the first six stories, the others are all conventional stories of detection.
I think Dame Agatha ran out of ideas for unhappy clients and returned to what she was good at.I loved most of the stories in this collection.
As I’m trying to read every Christie book, I wasn’t exactly keen to start read a whole collection of just this character.But I was pleasantly surprised on how much I enjoyed the first few stories.
Advertising himself as a person who can make people happy again, the stories set in England has a certain ‘221b Baker Street’ vibe about them.Various members of the public respond to he’s newspaper ad and he uses logic to find a way to improve their lives.The rest of the stories focus on he’s travels aboard, these were more typically the mysteries you’d expect.
Thought I wasn’t massively keen on these ones.Overall it was quite enjoyable, maybe one for the completists.

But after the first seven story, we see that she again comes back to her conventional writing story and makes a detective from Parker Pyne also.The psychological stories can be divided into following categories:1-	A middle-aged woman who is not satisfied with her marital life; her husband betrays her and he thinks his wife is jealous of him,2-	A man whose wife does not like him anymore and she wants to get married with another man,3-	A man whose life’s become boring and he doesn’t feel any excitement,4-	A wealthy widow whose rich life does not attracts her anymore and life becomes monotonous for her.I found the approaches that Agatha suggests to the characters in the form of Parker Pyne, natural and reasonable.
Parker Pyne is the most emotional of Christie's detectives, preferring matters of the heart to pure puzzles.
As it happens, I prefer the stories in this collection that *are* mysteries.
I found myself thinking, "what about all the people with real problems, Agatha?" However, she published this collection in 1934, which gives some insight into the fantasy at work here: most likely her mid-Depression readers simply wanted to *imagine* having such easy problems and tidy solutions.Even so, I like the stories that do involve murder and crime, as Christie proves herself quite adept at packing her famous twists into even a few pages.
خانه ای در شیراز ماجراهای کاآگاهی ب نام پارکرپاین هستش .
این کارآگاه ک در قالب دلالی برای خوشبخت کردن معرفی میشه نوعی جهانگرد هم محسوب میشه ک برای تفریحات ب سمت مشرق زمین سفر میکنه .
در قسمت های انتهایی کتاب ب تهران میاد و هیچ از حالت مدرن اون خوشش نمیاد ولی وقتی ب شیراز میره میتونه اونجا روح شرقی رو بیشتر حس کنه و مسلما داستانی و شخصی ناراضی اونجا زندگی میکنه ک ب وسیله پارکرپاین خوشبخت میشه .
اگر تم اصلی ک پارکرپاین رو مددگر معرفی کرده بود حفظ میشد خیلی بهتر از حالت کاآگاهی جواب میداد.در کل دیدن ایران از نگاه آگاتاریستی حس خوبی میده ولی.
خانه ای در شیراز اولین کتابی بود که از آگاتا کریستی خوندم. عنوان اصلی کتاب "ماجراهای پارک پاین" بود که احتمالا مترجم برای فروش بیشتر کتاب رو به نام "خانه ای در شیراز" منتشر کرده.چند داستان اولش خوب بود و آقای پاین سعی میکرد خودش داستانی رو بسازه اما از یه جایی به بعد داستان ها بیشتر به سمت کارآگاهی میره و آقای پاین بیشتر سعی میکنه کارآگاه بازی دربیاره و خودش داستان ها رو کشف کنه.در کل سه چهارتا از داستان هاشو دوست داشتم، و داستان خانه ای در شیرازش از همه لوستر بود به نظرم.

I'm putting that right now, all these decades later, revisiting Christie favorites of the past and discovering new-to-me offerings by the queen of mystery writers.Parker Pyne is a private investigator, but not of the usual sort.
Pyne hones in on the one thing that is preventing his client from being happy/fulfilled and then puts a plan into action to make it happen.This series of short stories was a great introduction to this character and his unusual pursuits in the name of client satisfaction.
Pyne is an interesting and imaginative character; understanding of human nature, ethical and not easily manipulated.
"MUTSUZ MUSUNUZ? EĞER ÖYLEYSENİZ BAY PARKER PYNE’A BAŞVURUN - Richmond Caddesi -17 Numara. "Her ne kadar kendini dedektif olarak değil de gönül uzmanı olarak tanıtsa da bence bir Poirot kadar yetenekli bir dedektif. İlk öyküler canı sıkılan insanların sıradan öyküleriyken kitap ilerledikçe Parker Pyne'a bir türlü istediği tatili yaşatmayan olaylar okuyorsunuz. Özellikle en sondaki cidden ilginçti. Zaten Agatha Christie'nin yarattığı hangi karakter sizi etkilemez ki.
12 verhaaltjes over Mijnheer Parker Pyne, de man die beweert dat hij mensen gelukkig kan maken.1.De vrouw van middelbare leeftijd.2.De ontevreden majoor.3.Vrouw in nood.4.De ontevreden echtgenoot.5.De kantoorbediende.6.De rijke vrouw.7.Heeft u niets meer te wensen?8.De poort van Bagdad.9.Het huis in Shiraz.10.De parel van grote waarde.11.de moord op de Nijlboot.12.Het orakel van Delphi.
This work feels odd in many ways: 1) the titular detective is completely flat and sometimes unnoticed by other characters, but perhaps this allows Pyne to travel incognito and was an intentional characteristic drawn that way by Christie; 2) as another reviewer noted, this book feels like a set of episodes from the 1970's monster TV hit show, Fantasy Island, but let's not forget Christie wrote this in 1932 so, if anything, she ingeniously inspired that TV show (which was and is a guilty pleasure for millions); 3) Christie was a knowledgeable world traveler and at one point the red rock city of Petra is described as 'preposterous' in one of these stories but Christie's huge fan base (of her books and of Christie herself) know she would never label a world famous landmark as such, thus there must be more to this description than meets the eye (was she emphasizing the vapidity of Pyne or of his rich and bored characters?) At first glance, to me, this was a weak 1-star work, then after thinking about it I realized "Mr.Parker Pyne, Detective" is more of an odd 2-star work than weak.
ENGLISH: Mr. Parker Pyne is an atypical detective, who advertises himself as someone who can solve the problems of unhappy people, and he does so in quite a personal way.
The book contains 12 short stories, of which six present Mr. Parker Pyne solving his clients problems, while in the other six he is on vacation, but cannot avoid cases arising to his right and left.
The story I liked most is "The case of the discontented soldier." In "The Regatta mystery" there are two additional stories performed by Mr. Parker Pyne.ESPAÑOL: Mr. Parker Pyne es un detective atípico, que se anuncia como alguien que puede resolver los problemas de las personas que se sienten infelices, y lo hace de manera muy personal.
Mr. Parker Pyne is my favorite character of the Christie lot.
I love the idea of a place people can go when unhappy, to come out happy again.
Not through booze or drugs, but do to actions made to right the sinking ship.The first half of the short stories in this anthology are the best.
The second half involve Pyne trying to take a vacation and constantly getting to another case, which becomes trying.
Especially in the complexity in so few pages.
The writing is great, especially the first half.
Same split involving the characters.Bottom line: i recommend this book.
كانت رحلة عودة ممتعة جدًا لعالم أجاثا كريستي، ووجب الأعتراف إن مستر باركر باين من أمتع التحريين اللي قرأت عنهم في حياتي.
The first six stories, all titled The Case of…  (The Distressed Lady, The Discontented Soldier etc), show Parker Pyne mostly as a problem solver (a sort of Jeeves, actually) who takes on commissions that involve creativity to solve problems such as a soldier’s sense of ennui on returning to England after a long career in Africa; a wife’s unhappiness over her husband’s infatuation with his secretary; and so on.
Pyne is terribly bland, and other than the fact that his hands are beautifully manicured, and that he believes everything can be tackled with statistics, I came away with no real impression of who Parker Pyne is.If you’re looking for a really good Agatha Christie book, this isn’t it.
Some books are timeless and some get outdated both in essence and ideas.
Agatha Christie's novels mostly stand the tests of time, even if everything is outdated, it's essence is not lost, sadly that could not be said for Parker Pyne Investigates.
The character Parker Pyne is not very remarkable.
This book has a collection of short stories which starts with Parker putting up an advertisement in papers where he invites unhappy people to come to him and he helps themInteresting idea but every story was outdated and not enjoyable.
Styeriotypical characters and dullness in execution.Its only in this novel that I am so disappointed.I won't give up Christie, she's my guilty pleasure.Ok read.
This was my first time reading a short story collection from Agatha Christie.
While I do prefer her longer mysteries, this was a fun read.
There were some short stories that were so so, but I really enjoyed most of them.
Agatha Christie was still able to weave in some unexpected twists in a short period of time.
My favorites were: The Case of the Distressed Lady, The Case of the Rich Woman, The Gate of Baghdad, Death on the Nile, The Oracle at Delphi, Problem at Pollensa Bay, and The Regatta Mystery.
I especially enjoyed the short stories that were part of Parker Pyne's vacation tour.
I like to re-read a Christie now and then, it's great comfort food. Some of these stories are repetitive and at least one seems to presage a plot later used for Poirot, but they're all quite tidy and satisfying taken on their own. I do prefer the ones where Pyne does not have an actual crime to deal with but is just sorting out someone's life with a bit of stage management.
4.5/5 ⭐s. I loved this collection of short stories!

Mr. Parker Pyne is identified as a detective or "investigator," but he's really a retired civil servant who's now a private consultant in the all-important business of happiness.
Love, hate, greed, fear, and boredom.Christie was a successful crime writer because people crave excitement.
PARKER PYNE, DETECTIVE and the last two were printed in Christie's short story collections.
Don't we all?I think these stories are touching because they represent the knowledge of human nature that Christie gained (sometimes painfully) over her life and which she couldn't fully explore in her crime novels.
I haven’t even finished it, only read the first two of the book’s 12 stories, but I know the rest will be just as delightful.
Then I picked up this little book in a thrift store (for 0.99), and I don’s feel jaded anymore.
If not, consult Mr. Parker Pyne.” So I consulted him, and you know what: I’m happy.
Last night, when I closed the book after the first two stories, I smiled.
Can’t wait to get back to the book and read all the stories.
هو محقق و إن صح التعبير أكثر فهو مساعد نفسي 😉، الكتاب عبارة عن مجموعة قصصية مع بطل رئيسي في كل القصص ، و في كل قصة نرى أفراد يبحثون عن حلول لمشاكلهم و تعاستهم و جرائمهم و بالطبع المنقذ يكون السيد باركر باين 😉،القصص جميلة ممتعة و خفيفه و سريعه و هنا تقسيمتي للقصص 😌1.
و مع هذا فأنا لا أكرهه بالعكس جداً متقبله للشخصية و لكنه لم يكن بمستوى ابطال روايات اجاثا (بوارو و ماربل) 🧐.مقدمة الكتاب جميلة في البداية و جيدة لتعريفنا بالدار و لكن تم إطالتها بشكل ممل ، ..
The first few stories take place in England, and mostly involve Pyne creating elaborate adventures for his clients, that they think are happening naturally.
In the second half of the book, Pyne goes on holiday to the Middle East, Egypt, and Greece, and finds himself in the role of detective, solving murders and thefts.I remember reading this as a teenager, and enjoying the first stories more; I liked the idea of creating real-life stories for people to live.
For the rest, I wasn't particularly interested in the parts of the world that Pyne visited, and the stories were more straight detection, like a Poirot story.
Nos restantes, a sua intervenção já é mais direta, na medida em que é abordado, pelos países em que passa, por pessoas desesperadas que esperam que este resolva os seus problemas.Tenho que confessar que esta personagem, apesar de diferente e ousado, não é das minhas preferidas no universo Christie.
Não me cativou comparativamente com os outros livros da autora e as estórias presentes nesta obra não são tão aliciantes como com o que Christie já nos acostumou.
Contudo, é um tipo de policial invulgar, que poderá agradar a quem quiser adquirir uma perspetiva diferente sobre o mundo literário de Christie.
يك مجموعه ديگه از داستان كوتاه هاي اگاتا كريستي كه در ايران با عنوان خانه اي در شيراز به چاپ رسيدهاي
I was very disappointed by this. It certainly isn't Agatha Christie's typical whodunit mystery. Instead, it is about a man who makes life interesting for people by throwing around some money. I did not finish it because it was boring and poorly written. The short stories all (by all I mean those I read) followed the same plot. Certainly not one of Christie's best. If you're looking for one of her better novels, go read And Then There Were None or Murder on the Orient Express
کتاب اصلی اسمش ماجرا های پارکر پاینه یکی از شخصیت های خلق شده توسط نویسنده مشهور" آگاتا کریستی" که ب
I must confess I was slightly disappointed by this one. I rather expected Parker Pyne to be an energetic, quirky detective, but was presented with a virtually office-bound self-styled "love expert" that solved people's problems through money and deception rather than any of his own genius. Most of the stories were rather dull, too, and it makes you wonder what was the whole point of it.
