but it's not good enough to brainwash people in that "oh, james franco, you want to write books now??
because i know shit from poundcake about poetry, really, but to me, this is a love poem:from The Bridge: Southern CrossBY HART CRANEI wanted you, nameless Woman of the South,No wraith, but utterly—as still more aloneThe Southern Cross takes nightAnd lifts her girdles from her, one by one—High, cool,               wide from the slowly smoldering fireOf lower heavens,—                               vaporous scars!Eve!
I've been reading this off and on for the longest time, but I finally made my way through the collection! I'll admit, I don't really know how to review poetry. I enjoyed this collection immensely and I definitely have the desire to pick up more works by Lang Leav. I think she depicted love in an excellent way, showcasing the good, the bad, & the straight up ugly.
Back when I was with my gamer ex-boyfriend, we would give each other cards containing stupid geeky poetry for Valentine's Day: Roses are redViolets are blueAll my baseAre belong to you. As painfully silly as it is, that little snippet is still significantly better than the poetry in this book. At least it wasn't meant to be taken seriously. Unless I've missed something and this book is meant to be some grand satire of the artistic sort. In which case, carry on!If you think this is good poetry: T

And you still think it is good poetry beyond the age of 9, we seriously need to have a talk.
It's easy to relate to because it writes about feelings and emotions that we have all probably had at times, and it does so in small little bites with enough melodrama that it feels like something most people have probably thought when they are wallowing in their own joy / self-pity.
Rhyming in poetry gives a work structure and lyricism, something lacking in these poems.
I try not to be a snob about things but fuck it, any negative reviews of this book are up against an army of people out to make it look like Lang Leav does no wrong.
Prose that comes from these feelings shouldn't need any gimmicks to impact the human heart.
Leav has the ability to string together simple words and strike the human heart, and that's why her book holds so much appeal.PS: I'm sorry if I offend anyone when I say this, but to be honest, I think it's a bit pretentious to look for stylistic sophistication from a genre or type of prose that is supposed to speak the words your heart could never say.
In that case, you may be missing the point of prose altogether.
Oh my god, I dislike it a lot,and I don't give a damn if it rhymes or not.Dear Byron, Plath and Baudelaire,Oh, Pizarnik, Rimbaud and Verlaine,What the heck is this? I'm cursing like hell.It was a painful experience; I need some air.** The end **Oh, yes. I dared.Well. I am so mad because I had high hopes for this book.

Sure, I was more intrigued by the misadventure part, but still I thought I would like it.However, I found this:(view spoiler)[
(hide spoiler)]Like Care Bears vomiting sugary rainbows on Valentine's Day.And the prose poetry doesn't get any better (Sad Songs, Dead Butterflies, Soul Mates, Angels...).Anyway, when I was 12 or 13 years old, I had this diary filled with little poems about love and unrequited love, sighs, love, prince charming, love and more pinky pink love with a pinch of girl-pining-for-guy-ready-to-leave-everything-to-be-with-him.
Leav's poems are the kind of thing I (emphasis on word “I”) would have loved when I was 12.
lucky to hit against things and images, people and twin souls that change and mark my life, make it somehow better, richer.this book was and still is my friend.a collection of emotions in a form of words which are with me, always.
i loved it, but then, my blood is of the colour of the book, the thoughts in my head are as beautiful and as ornamental as the letters on the front side of the book.
nothing in me is real or life-like, nothing serves its functions.
everything serves beauty and love and emotions.
just like this collection of poems.
I took some time to peruse this at the library because everyone's been getting excited about it on Tumblr.I don't really know what I expected.. Love & Misadventure just wasn't for me. Given the hype, I guess I expected to read some really insightful and profound stuff, but instead what I got was this:"I deplore, being ignored. For— I am not a bore!"What.It's not my cup of tea.
I wanted to like this poetry collection because a dear former student let me borrow it.
I will tell her that I was mainly reminded of greeting cards when I read this collection.
This is just an instance of my being an English snob, I suppose.The one poem I really like in this collection, "Rogue Planets," is a prose poem with some actual development.
But one good poem in a deluge of Hallmark ones is not enough to raise this book out of its 1/5 rating.*Note: In typing Leav's poems, I did not recreate her line breaks for speed's sake.
I really enjoy reading modern poetry, especially by poets my age and poets that start their careers with an online following, and so I was really curious to see what Lang Leav had to offer! This collection had a few poems that I dog eared, and I found some of the ideas cute or interesting, but overall it wasn't my style of poetry. I don't think I'll be picking up anything else by Lang Leav, but that's okay! Life goes on! This is probably more like a 2.5 stars for me!
"One day you meet someone and for some inexplicable reason, you feel more connected to this stranger than anyone else--closer to them than your closest family.
Perhaps this person carries within them an angel--one sent to you for some higher purpose; to teach you an important lesson or to keep you safe during a perilous time.
What you must do is trust in them--even if they come hand in hand with pain or suffering--the reason for their presence will become clear in due time."Though here is a word of warning--you may grow to love this person but remember they are not yours to keep.
They will be a stranger to you once more.READ THIS BOOK
This poetry is so terrible that at first I thought it was a joke, but apparently that is not the case.
What strikes me about Lang Leav's poetry is that I could have written a fair amount of it when I was in primary/high school. He makes me turn,he makes me toss;his words mean mineare at a loss.He makes me blush!He makes me wantto brush and floss. *stares at floss in my bathroom* *thinks romantic thoughts* *NOT*I like poetry. I like reading it; I like writing it; it's something I wish more people were into, though I can certainly understand why they aren't. Maybe Love & Misadventure is a ton m

*stares at floss in my bathroom* *thinks romantic thoughts* *NOT*I like poetry.
I've written poems like these myself, but I certainly expect a lot more profound stuff from a book as celebrated as this is.
There are some I like (most of which have turned up in one form or another on Tumblr), but ultimately it didn't resonate with me.
It is one of the highest user-rated books of poetry on all of Goodreads, right up there alongside Emily Dickinson and William Shakespeare (whose poems I’ve also enjoyed, by the way) and so I thought maybe I should check it out.I played it smart, though, by searching online for her material which, thank god I did because I would have been massively irritated if I had wasted $7.69 on this crap (the price of a Kindle edition), let alone on one of the first-edition signed copies which are going for over $300 on Amazon.So here’s some Lang Leav for ya...decide for yourself if you think I’m being unfair:
The bee, buzzing buzzing buzzing like a chansaw, stings me in the eye-- OW!I've created a tumblr page for my poems about my owwies. Please follow!Poetry should make us feel. This poetry made me feel tired and kind of itchy and pretty fucking grumpy. SUCCESS.That's a five-star book, right? Minus four for the goddamn ampersand. Plus four for feeling so feely about your feelings, and getting so many others to feel. Minus four for being so cranky about what feelings people have, and pissing on other people's reviews.Can't wait to read this!**again!****not really!

We watched as our faces grew younger and realized the Earth was spinning in reverse, moving us backwards in time.Then we reached a point where I no longer knew who you were and I was grasping the hands of a stranger.
They only know it feels right to be with one another.This is the reason why you miss someone so much when they are not there—even if they are only in the very next room.
Good lawdddd, have mercy! What did I just read? This is perfectly, absolutely a recipe for poetry disaster! I'm not a poetry expert by all means, but I've read several poems that is immensely evocative when read, but this one, this one takes the cake for poems gone horribly wrong! Goodness gracious!First and foremost, I would like to quote Leonardo da Vinci: “Painting is poetry that is seen rather than felt, and poetry is painting that is felt rather than seen.” That was a terse description of w
That was a terse description of what poetry and painting are.
However, instead of letting me feel something, I am officially devoid of any emotions after reading Leav's poems.
Imagine describing the feelings rather than letting readers interpret the poems by themselves!
Secondly, poems are very personal in nature and subject to various interpretations (I do respect why others loved this), but what is there to interpret?
Somebody says this.History throws its shadow over the beginning, over the desktop,over the sock drawer with its socks, its hidden letters.History is a little man in a brown suittrying to define a room he is outside of.I know history.
She writes about pain and suffering and love,I've probably felt more emotion for a sock or a glove.I'm sorry if you thing I'm pretentious and elitist,Diluted literature is something I can't deal with.Ms. Leav represents everything I hate,In literature in today's day and age.I thank you for listening to my incoherent ramblings,(I am definitely not a poet in the making)It's just that this collection was really bad,I wanted to make fun, but it just made me sad.My poetry, here I conclude,Because examples of Ms. Leav's work, I shall include.

These are the poems that I like on this book: Just Friends, Afraid to Love, A Way Out, The Keeper, and Jealousy. Is it me or it is just that some of the poems included here are either lack in depth or feelings?But despite of that, I really like  Lost Things and  Dead Butterflies  especially the latter. I might have enjoyed these books of Lang Leav if I am either in love or heartbroken at the moment.
It looks like someone threw up adjectives, metaphors, and cliched phrases and smashed them all into one book.I think this is Tahereh Mafi's long-lost twin. Just a theory.
But I wanted this very much after seeing it beat out Mary Oliver, which means Love & Misadventure HAS to be impressive, right?
If he inspires me to keep up on my dental hygiene would not be a personal sign for me.All of the poems in this collection are simplistic (and excessively rhyme-y) but while only a couple were beautifully written, I found the rest of them to be juvenile, immature and lacking any sort of emotional depth which is exactly what I would expect with a collection of love poetry.
It’s a collection of childish rhymes.
Surely, a lot of people can’t be wrong all at the same time and that Leav’s poetry would merit such a magnitude of fame.
In you, everything sank!For me, Neruda used the perfect metaphors in that stanza alone and the whole poem itself is a good example in the use of figurative language in poetry.
Neruda published Twenty Love Poems and A Song of Despair at the age of 20 and it was already Neruda’s second collection of poetry.
The result of Leav’s excessive comma use has made the poem very unwieldy and painful to read.Metaphor and punctuation use are the most pervasive faults that I have found in the book.
So that's why when I heard that this is a book being comprised of poems, I was really beyond excited to get my hands on this paperback.
Some arent even relevant (Again, I'm sorry, I really feel awful every time I diss a poet).
Though some captured my attention (especially the poems Sad Songs and Wallflower), most of the poems felt off, and I really didn't get that feeling that I get, whatever that may be, every time I indulge myself into poetry.
Some of these verses were cute, but completely shallow. I finished this book feeling exactly the same as when I started, which is not how I wish poetry to affect me. Good poetry leaves a mark
Fuck no!!!TimeTime we have too much ofTime we didn't dare to care ofTime we were spillingTime we were killingTime we started losing Time we started choosingTime we began chasingTime we dare to care ofTime we have to little ofBy Miss Leavs skill level I should have been an accomplished poet when I was 15. Curse you maturity and intellectual reasoning.You all should be honored. No one has ever clapped their eyes on this masterpiece before.
I haven't read this, but I was looking at some of the quotes and this caught my attention. “We may be just two different clocks, that do not tock in unison.” This has to be like the worst break-up line ever.
