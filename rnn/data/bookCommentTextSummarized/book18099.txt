simply inspiring.
(B+) 78% | GoodNotes: Her advice isn't especially deep or revelatory or new, but it's presented well and reading it just makes you feel better.
Beautiful. This is going right next to Neil Gaiman's Make Good Art on my bookshelf.
It speaks to the nature of its audience, gives good advice both on how to profit from adversity and also how to discern what is valuable, and—as a bonus—it illustrates its points with revealing glimpses into the heart of one of the most successful writers of our times.Rowling breaks the ice with these practically life-long Harry Potter fans (seven years old when the first book came out) with jokes about Gryffindor and gay wizards, but she soon begins to speak of fear of failure, making it clear she realizes these particular Potter fans are very privileged Potter fans indeed.
قد تعتقد أن تقييمي للكتاب بسبب شغفي بالمؤلفة فحسبفدعونا نتفق أن تقرأ 'خطبة' من تلك الخطب التي تلقي علي الطلبة يوم تخرجهم هو أمر ليس مشجعا علي اﻷطلاق..حتي إن كان الكتاب شكله جذابابل والخطبة هي عن أهمية وفوائد الفشل....تخيل؟وبالفعل تعترف جوان رولينج في بداية خطبتها أنها نفسها لم تعد تتذكر الخطبة التي سمعتها يوم تخرجها بعد أيام قليلة من التخرج، بالرغم من اهمية وقوة من ألقت هذه الخطبة..بالرغم من أهمية يوم التخرج نفسه، تخرجنا للحياة الحقيقية,الواسعةولكن أعتقد أن بقراءتي للخطبة ، وبهذا التصميم الجذاب المريح للعين سيجعلني أفكر فيما قرأت لوقت طويل..وأعتقد أني قد أتذكرها لعشرون عاما أيضاهي ليست خطبة تنمية بشرية تقليدية فارغة ولا شغل كيف تخرج من الفشل للنجاح أو جمال الفقر والنبل الذي بهوبالتأكيد ليست -كما أكدت المؤلفة- حافز لك لتحاول تغيير مسار مهنتك وحياتك لتصبح ساحر غريب اﻷطوار
“We do not need magic to change the world, we carry all the power we need inside ourselves already: we have the power to imagine better.” This genius woman. J. K. Rowling you're my favourite author. You forever will be.Find more of my books on Instagram
"It is impossible to live without failing at something, unless you live so cautiously that you might as well not have lived at all- in which case, you fail by default."
The reason I gave this book 4.5 stars instead of 5 is because it was so short. This is the published form of J K Rowling's commencement address to Harvard graduates in 2008. Her words of wisdom ring true to all, and she even managed to sneak in a few Potter references. I finished in about 15 minutes, and am wishful to think that J K can publish a longer book of essays, which I am sure many of us would be happy to read.
“As is a tale, so is life: not how long it is, but how good it is, is what matters.”  Very inspiring! JK Rowling has a magical way with words. Love it!
“So why do I talk about the benefits of failure?
Simply because failure meant a stripping away of the inessential.
I was set free, because my greatest fear had been realised, and I was still alive, and I still had a daughter whom I adored, and I had an old typewriter and a big idea.
It is impossible to live without failing at something, unless you live so cautiously that you might as well not have lived at all - in which case, you fail by default.” “There is an expiry date on blaming your parents for steering you in the wrong direction; the moment you are old enough to take the wheel, responsibility lies with you.”The Queen has spoken!
:D i adored this book so much.
Life's good.You know, that life is 90 percent what happens to you and 10 percent how you react to it.Rightly so, we are all defined by the choices that we make. JKR amalgamates humor with emotions exhibiting the knowledge that accrues with time.There's a quote from this book that found its place onto my bedroom wall.Poverty is romanticized only by the fools.Richness comes in various currencies. Friends, money, career, society. Make sure you are #1 in each and every one of them.
Never was a more true word spoken. A gifted speech from a gifted author. Definitely worth then 20 minutes to finish it!
"And rock bottom became the solid foundation on which I rebuilt my life." All the people in J.K Rowling's life must feel so incredibly blessed. I would.As a die-hard Harry Potter fan, I have read a lot about J.K and her fascinating life before all the Harry Potter craziness. Very Good Lives does a great job of showing some of the wisdom she gained from this time.

Reading it was amazing, but I highly suggest watching her speech or reading the comic version, which I adore.
Amazing. Inspirational. Wonderful. Read it!
While we wait, it's worth checking out this other adaptation of her speech by ZEN PENCILS: (The rest is linked in the image)Oh, and here, have a link to the video of the full speech.
Vorab das Buch ist wunderschön aufgemacht, es sind viele süße Illustrationen drin und auch das Buch selbst (ohne Schutzumschlag) ist super schön.Die Rede die Rowling hier gehalten hat, war auch sehr schön und inspirierend, nur bin ich mir nicht sicher, ob es wirklich notwenig war, diese zu drucken. Kriege den Gedanken der puren Geldmacherei nicht ganz aus meinem Kopf 😜
ABSOLUTAMENTE TODO EL MUNDO NECESITA ESTE LIBRO EN SU VIDA.Es curioso, todo el mundo cree que odio a J.K. Rowling porque nunca he leído (o visto) nada de Harry Potter y decidí no hacerlo por lo menos en unos 10 años más (gracias al algunos fans que no me dejan en paz con el tema y me hicieron cogerle fobia); pero la realidad es que conocía la historia de vida de J.K. Rowling y siempre admiré su carrera: salir del fondo no es fácil y ella no solo lo superó, si no que brilló al final...
In 2008, J.K. Rowling delivered a commencement speech at Harvard University.
The sales of Very Good Lives will benefit Lumos, a non-profit international children’s organization founded by J.K. Rowling, which works to end the institutionalization of children around the world.J.K. Rowling said about the charity:“Lumos is a spell I created in Harry Potter that brings light to a desperately dark and frightening place.
At Lumos this is just what we do: we reveal the hidden children locked away behind closed doors in institutions and forgotten by the world, so that everyone first of all understands the problem and then works together to fix it.
Well worth the fifteen (okay, ten) minutes it takes to read.In addition, if you want a starting point to have a conversation with your middle or high school age kid, read this together. Listen to what your kid says. Rinse. Lather. Repeat. Just an idea.
“As is a tale, so is life: not how long it is, but how good it is, is what matters.I wish you all very good lives.” ― J.K. Rowling, Very Good Lives: The Fringe Benefits of Failure and the Importance of ImaginationWell written, as anything by this author would be, I found the ideas presented very valuable and well put, but her speech wasn't that inspirational to me.
“We do not need magic to change the world, we carry all the power we need inside ourselves already: we have the power to imagine better.” Gran discurso de Rowling. Me gustó mucho. Algunas ideas tratadas ya estaban sobreexplotadas hasta el punto de ser casi tópicos, pero recato las partes del rol de la imaginación y su relación con la empatía y cómo el fracaso nos revela lo que realmente debemos seguir, como una especie de filtro. Perfecto para ocupar unos minutos libres, puesto que es breve y vale muchísimo la pena. Cada vez admiro más a esta mujer.
Rowling consigue emocionar narrando experiencias de su pasado que le han formado como personas, tratando de transmitirle al lector que la vida es mucho más que un trabajo.
La vida es una experiencia continua que hay que vivir, y la cual hay que afrontar con inteligencia e imaginación.
Hay pasajes de su vida complicados, duros y llenos de tristeza, pero ella consigue resumirlos en algo similar a las cenizas del ave Fénix: destruido momentáneamente para ser más tarde un grito de esperanza.
Te llena con sus palabras y enseña mucho en muy poco.Gracias, Rowling, por hacernos pensar.
Es justo lo que esperas al saber de que trata; un discurso motivacional sobre ser empáticos, aprender de nuestros fracasos y creer en aquello que nos apasiona.Las ilustraciones son muy lindas, es el tipo de libro que puede ser gran obsequio para fanáticos de la autora o recién graduados. No es mi discurso de graduación favorito (para eso prefiero el de Neil Gaiman que he visto el video original más no lo he leído en texto) pero el mensaje es lindo y acertado.
JK parla dritta al mio cuore oggi come 20 anni fa, quando lessi il primo capitolo di Harry Potter.
"Tal vez nunca fracaséis de una forma tan estrepitosa como yo, pero en la vida es inevitable fracasar alguna vez.
Es imposible vivir sin fracasar en algo, a menos que seas tan prudente que no se pueda decir que hayas vivido, y en ese caso fracasas por omisión".Sólo a Queen J.
K. Rowling le permito que me dé un discurso sobre la importancia del fracaso en la vida, de levantarse y aprender de los errores y, sobre todo, de usar la creatividad para imaginarnos soluciones y ponernos en la piel del otro, pues sólo así, dice, nos convertimos en mejores personas.
In Very Good Lives, J.K. Rowling shares the benefits of failure in one's life and why it is a necessity to overcome fears.I was browsing JKR's interview videos and stumbled upon this.
This speech proved to be a turning point in my life and how I looked and faced every situation.All in all, I can say is that I'm grateful to J.K. Rowling that she decided to become a writer and shared her wisdom and experiences through such a strong and everlasting technique.Thank You, Archit, for reading such books with me.
I may be in the minority here, but I had never heard or read Very Good Lived before now. It is JK Rowling's commencement speech at Harvard in 2008. I picked up the book because the proceeds of its sales go to JK's Lumos charity and also because it's JK Freaking Rowling. The book is small, as it is a speech, but it is beautifully written and put together. Alongside JK's inspiring and thought-provoking words there are illustrations and doodles that add so much to the reading experience. I absolutely recommend picking this one up!
Rowling talks us through her life experiences and the best way to move forward with baggage that every one of us has to some extent.
"It is impossible to live without failing at something, unless you live so cautiously that you might as well have not lived at all- in which case, you fail by default." I would recommend this to anybody who has been through or is going through a rough patch or just needs a little nudge from our favorite author for the inspiration needed to get going.
They can refuse to hear screams or to peer inside cages; they can close their minds and hearts to any suffering that does not touch them personally; they can refuse to know.” I can tell you right now that this is the only graduation speech I will ever read.
Unless J.K.Rowling will have another one then I would read that one as well.
“I would like to make it clear, in parenthesis, that I do not blame my parents for their point of view.
There is an expiration date on blaming your parents for steering you in the wrong direction; the moment you are old enough to take the wheel, responsibility lies with you.”
K. Rowling is my Writer-Queen not because she made magic wands look cool, or because she wrote a great and incomparable fantasy saga.
She is my and many others Writer-Queen because of things like this:"...but poverty itself is romanticised only by fools.
Of course, this is a power, like my brand of fictional magic, that is morally neutral.
I wish you all very good lives."If you can't buy the book itself, then read the speech.
