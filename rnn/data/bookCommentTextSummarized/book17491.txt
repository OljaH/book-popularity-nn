Because she knew a secret: there were two kinds of monsters, the kind that hunted the streets and the kind that lived in your head. She could fight the first, but the second was more dangerous. It was always, always, always a step ahead. Oh shiiiiit. Schwab was not playing nice with our feelings when she wrote this book. I suspect she might be a bit evil, but, you know, in a good way.Our Dark Duet picks up several months after the events of This Savage Song. August is busy fulfilling his monstr
August is busy fulfilling his monstrous duty in Verity - reaping the souls of those who have committed violent acts - and Kate is now part of a monster-fighting gang in Prosperity.
I'll let you find out the details for yourself, but this monster is unlike anything Kate or August have seen before.
Kate trails it back to the place that has been calling her for months - Verity.When I started the book I didn't have a clear memory of This Savage Song and wondered if I would have to do a reread, but a couple of chapters in and it all came flooding back to me.
wow, what a ride! this was a fantastic conclusion to the duology! there was laughter and pain and explosions and it made for a very satisfying finale to august & kate's story....but we're not done with the world yet, are we?? it's just SO COOL and i still have so many questions. like i definitely need more books set in this world please thank you.
Now that this book is written and edited and out in 2 months, I guess it's time to finally mark it as read <3
If you read This Savage Song and was like "it's good but not my favorite"  which, shame on you for ever saying that about a Victoria novel  then you are gonna die even more than I did because this book wasn't even on the same level as TSS.
(view spoiler)[ My favorite scene in the entire book is when he reaps the soul of that mother.
The Monsters of Verity series is very much a book about the main characters.
Both Victoria Schwab series ended this year and now I don't know what I am going to do with my life until her next book comes out.
I WILL NEVER RECOVER
This random plot point thing is actually a general problem - as this book begins, we’re thrown into a lot of really cool new plot points, including a larger world context, a hunting team for Kate, an attack team for August, a character shift for Ilsa, a major character shift for August, a character shift for Kate, a new reign in Verity, a new big bad Malchai, a brand new automatic supersonic hypnotic funky fresh new Sunai, and a brand new automatic supersonic hypnotic funky fresh monster.
So, here I am reading through the book with this music and it's so perfect and the things that broke my heart with that music playing made it ten fold.
August Flynn lives in Verity with his own crew and they are fighting monsters as well and reaping them.
Kate and August didn't think they would see each other again but there is a new monster on the loose they need to eradicate because it's a big baddie.
I love you Victoria Schwab for writing awesome books and breaking my heart ♥Play on August Flynn .
I wish I could write like this amazing and very talented woman.
She keeps taking my breath away with her words and I'm so glad for every story she creates.This is one of my favourite quotes from the book:"There would always be cracks in the surface, shadows in the light, a hundred degrees of grey between black and white."I still have so many questions about the Chaos Eater, though.
Even though it might hurt, I think Kate's death was the only way to end this right.
(hide spoiler)]In a nutshell: A spectacular and nearly perfect conclusion to this amazing series.
It was a good and perfect book.I don't want calm feelings anyway.I also don't want this to be over because August and Kate are two very very very precious characters to me.
It just made the story so much richer and bursting with feeling• AUGUST <3 <3 <3• there are battles and scars and death and darkness and honestly this duology is just magnificent and I love how it asks questions about sinners and right vs wrong and what truly makes a monsterAN ABSOLUTELY DARKLY INCREDIBLE TALE.
fun fact: victoria schwab herself liked my pre-review, which looked somewhat like this:____________see you in hell, victoriahonestly i'm mainly mad at myself for not being prepared for the abysmal pain and endless suffering schwab's books tend to bring upon me, like @ past me why you always do this to yourself??? STAY WOKE BITCH[something about me crying into my pillow] satan is a woman and her name is victoria schwab ____________so basically the ONE TIME my favorite author notices me is when i
[every time august flynn walked into the room i felt an emotion that can only be described as the equivalent to smelling freshly picked flowers, my heart is so full of love for my emo son]final thoughts:just accept the fact that you sign up for pain and suffering every time you buy a book by victoria schwab.
(Did I read the same book as everyone else???)Before you throw things at me, let me explain the problems I had.Starting with the abysmal inconsistent pacing.
They aren’t particularly bad characters, and in the right circumstances, I could have enjoyed them, but this is a sequel and a conclusion—I don’t want to waste time learning about and trying to care about new characters, I just want to see what happens to the ones I already love.
It’s like everyone got so hung up on the 'one-big-thing-that-happens, they forget there’s only kinda development for everyone else?
Schwab has a way of making me feel numb with the ending of her books.
You've left me completely devoid of feeling any emotion.One thing I will mention though is the interesting take on what killing human beings can do to ones soul.
Yet they're unable to stop committing such acts, because it returns some sense of familiarity back to them.
“…monsters acts make monsters.” And that the spirit of those that have been killed by the perpetrator still lives on, in them.
I absolutely love stories that delve deep into the psyche of the human mind and Schwab did an phenomenal job showcasing it in this duology.
5 stars!::UPDATE JULY 14, 2017::IM STILL NOT FUCKING OVER IT! OMG!KILL ME NOW I'M IN TOO MUCH PAIN!(view spoiler)[I am literally still bursting into spontaneous tears over this book ... like in public ... it's a problem (hide spoiler)]::JULY 10, 2017::IAMWRECKED
i loved my soft little monster, august, way too much to stay away.
<3on a different note, i didnt think this was as good as the first book (only in the slightest).
i definitely think this could have been shortened without compromising the story, but i didnt mind too much because of VSs writing.
as with the first book, the writing was the highlight for me.
that doesnt mean it didnt hurt me any less, but wow, im impressed (if you know, you know).
such a great first impression of victoria schwab and i am very eager to pick up her other books!
hate is a strong word I TRUSTED her with my being and SHE FRICKEN PUNCHED ME IN THE THROAT ~metaphorically ofc~When I was reading reviews for Our Dark Duet, a lot of reviewers were crying and screaming and dying in front of me and I was like pshhhh you just are being sooooo dRaMaTiCLittle did I know.
(s) Now a list of people who can choke: -	Sloan-	Alice-	Sloan-	Alice-	SLOAN-	A L I C E -	S L O A NI just wanted to make sure that was clear.Now I hope to never have to relive that ending again bc it was so painful and I’ve tried to block it out many times but it keeps haunting me and my tears keep running and I’m blaming Schwab for dehydrating me.
"It wasn't easy. The world was complicated. Life was hard. And so often, living hurt. So make it worth the pain." // I think I died a little inside. I loved it so much yet hate that it's all over now. 🙁
how fucking dare you play with my emotions like that.*sighs**cries**screams**wipes tear**gets self back together*okay, okay, I'm done ranting.
They are so flawed and they are so real, it's impossible to not care about them.I can now say without doubt that Victoria Schwab is the best author of our generation.This book messed with me, made me question my choices and it made me question why the fuck I put myself through this suffering that is reading books, especially Victoria's.(view spoiler)[okay so I need to scream a little bit about a certain scene in this book, and it will be spoilery.
You know when you want to absolutely devour a book, but it's the last book in a series you love, so you're torn between reading it in practically one sitting and savoring it for as long as you can? That's the way I felt about Victoria Schwab's Our Dark Duet, the second and apparently final book in Schwab's Monsters of Verity series. (The first book, This Savage Song, was pretty fantastic, too. See my original review.)"There were two kinds of monsters, the kind that hunted the streets and the ki
Meanwhile, August has assumed his rightful place as heir apparent to his father's task force, but he is still conflicted between what is expected of him and what he wants from his life."And here in Prosperity, Kate had found a purpose, a point, and now when she met her gaze in the mirror, she didn't see a girl who was sad or lonely or lost.
I'd love to see how August and Kate, their family and friends, and those monsters translate onto the screen.
•An instance could be towards the end, when Kate (view spoiler)[leaves the Compound to chase after Alice when she knows it's a trap, the whole crew goes after her, Henry is captured during the action, and three minutes later, they all (minus Henry) are home again (hide spoiler)].
Like I'm not supposed to notice the whole sequence is just an excuse to (view spoiler)[get Henry into Sloan's hands (hide spoiler)]?This is only the clearest example I can think of, but I perceived this effect more or less throughout the whole book.
(Leigh, Bardugo, just so you know, this is how you (view spoiler)[kill a main character in the last pages (hide spoiler)].
Book one is still my fave, but I really liked this one! It took me a while to get into this book since Kate and August were separated for so long. Kate's snark was the best, and that ending was so good!!!! Full review on my blog https://literarydust.wordpress.com/20...
95% of the book: *dies of feelsfeelsallthefeels but pretty sure that since haven't really cried yet then probably not going to*Last 5% of the book: *cries nonstop*COULDN'T HAVE ENDED BETTER, REALLY. Like just all the things that this series is about always guts me and this book definitely intensified that by a lot, a lot

This book was amazing!!If I am honest with you, I wasn't expecting it to be.
I read This Savage Song last year and while I really enjoyed it, I just didn't love it so when this book came along I was expecting those same feelings.I am so happy to be proved wrong.
I loved the second book!
This book isn't happy.
It's a dark, gritty book about monsters and fighting and wrong vs.
right but my goodness was it freaking good!Please let me know if you would like me to do a series review on both of the books!
The book wasn't bad--it was a grey finale and I think if you liked This Savage Song, you'll like this one too.
The reason it fell a little from my expectations is that it felt a bit slow at times?
The book is over 500 pages and it feels like it.
Somewhere around the middle, I wasn't eagerly awaiting what was going to happen next; I just wanted things to pick up the pace.
Like I said, it's a really good finale.
---I LOVE THIS COVER A LOT MORE THAN I LOVE MYSELF ARE YOU GUYS SEEING THIS OH MY LORD---i love this title a little more than i love myself :)
I finished this book the other day but I forgot to update you guys because I was ... you know... sobbing.
5000/5 starsObviously...“Mourning was its own kind of music—the sound of so many hearts, of so many breaths, of so many standing together.”Hey Victoria Schwab, is it okay if I refer you as Sloan for now on?
Out of everyone, I feel like she takes the cake in character development.If I wasn't convinced throughout the book, that ending alone as made it so clear.I'm not going to delve into the plot of the book, because honestly, you should just read it for yourself and find out.hahahahaha good luckNever reading a Victoria Shwab book again.Ever.Jokes baby, I love you.
well, isn't that an unexpected amount of pain
Am I actually supposed to carry on with my life after what I just read? I hope my soul tasted delicious, @Schwab, and you didn’t choke on it ! I can’t. stop. thinking. about. this. series. If I don’t find out what happens next and how it all ends right now I might cry. Love is pain.
“People were messy. They were defined not only by what they’d done, but by what they would have done, under different circumstances…” That was one dark, intense book. So much better than the first and what an ending 😭. I’m going to miss my soft, violin playing, monster 💕
The real Sunai here is Victoria Schwab, she just uses words instead of music to steal (and destroy) our souls
