Each of the stories all share the same universal laws and truths, have numerous recurring characters and all spring up Athena like from the head of great Zeus Pratchett.Mort is an inquisitive, gangly lad, all elbows and knees, who becomes the apprentice to Death.
Two parts Douglas Adams and One part Monty Python, but all fun, this will most certainly NOT be my last Discworld novel.** 2015 - Sir Terry died a few days ago and we are all the lesser at having lost him, but better at having known him at all.
Being one of the first and the latest of all the Pratchett reads, I'm really surprised just how much I loved this one.
I'm upping the star count to a full five just because I think I liked Mort, the character, even better this time around.DEATH on DISCWORLD.
:) Seriously, there's nothing quite like it.
Death is the mewling cat at the party of life.
:)The story is a bit more interesting, I must say, than the ones immediately preceding it, and of all the books, I think it captures the essential spirit of all the ones to come after.
This has been my first encounter with the Discworld universe and the many writings of Terry Pratchett, and voicing my opinion on it makes me feel like a blundering fool stumbling into a world that was meant for his younger and perhaps wiser self, a world of which he has only caught a glimpse.
The book contains the kind of humour that shows the common sense of absurdity and showcases the author's very refreshing look on things.
I think a young reader's mind will appreciate it much more, even though there's something in there for all ages, which I'll try to show, in closing, with my favorite quotes of the book:
Mort (the lad in question) is an outsider since he always wants to help his family (farmers) but is very clumsy and good intentions only get you so far.
In this case: mortality, justice/compassion, death in all kinds of incarnations (depending on the culture), but also - importantly - life and that existing doesn't necessarily equal LIVING (that we need to make it count)!This was the very first Discworld novel I've ever read and even the German translation back then was fantastically funny.
It became instantly dear to me, prompting me to immediately buy the English original and reading it once again, but I had almost forgotten just HOW GOOD this was.
Bez iznenadjenja: čitati Pračeta po prvi put je nalik na upoznavanje starog, dragog prijatelja. Prijateljstvo je već tu, veliko je i puno obećava, samo eto, igrom slučaja nijedan ni drugi niste o tome bili obavešteni.p.s. izdanje koje imam je toliko divno da je teško gledati ga bez lekova za smirenje.4+
Death is looking for an apprentice to eventually replace him and decides on a young man called Mort.
“You are looking for an apprentice?” he said.The eyesockets turned towards him, their actinic pinpoints flaring.OF COURSE.Death waved a bony hand.
It had been starting to prey on his mind.“If Father says it’s all right,” he said.They looked at Lezek, who was scratching his beard.“How do you feel about this, Mort?” he said, with the brittle brightness of a fever victim.
WHEN THE LAST LIFE CRAWLS UNDER FREEZING STARS, THERE WILL I BE.“Ah,” said Lezek, “you get about a bit, then.” He looked puzzled, like a man struggling to remember something important, and then obviously gave up.
"I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU, BUT I COULD MURDER A CURRY.”With those simple words Terry Pratchett introduces the complicated fact that on The Disc Death is as much a person as anyone else, only more so.The fourth Discworld novel is right up there with my favourites, the story of how Death came to take an apprentice and how one gangly, awkward young boy became a strong, confident man is filled with humour and tells the kind of coming of age tale other authors only dream of.It may not be the best written or contain the most interesting observations of humanity from the entire series but there's a real charm to this early Discworld novel that makes it hard to notice any of the faults in any depth.
I thought the book really hit its stride when Mort's unrequited love of Keli and Ysabell's growing fondness of Mort lead to a few uncomfortable moments.
But Ysabell's sudden switch from being annoyed by Mort's very presence to her fawning on Mort, with no real indication of why she changed, left me feeling just a little cheated.I'll admit it - I like Pratchett best when he's off-subject.
But it's the little ideas that I love and that make this a book worth reading, like valuable gems in a rather ordinary diadem.
I'll search out another Discworld book, maybe two, looking for those same gems.
I "made a mistake" in my life by reading later works of Discworld (DW) first.
By the time I read earliest Discworld stories, the universe feels not fully developed.
Mort is the fourth DW novel, and I see the DW universe, the jokes, and the characters are better developed than the 3 earlier novels (but still not as sophisticated as DW later works).
But, there are some good moments: the awkwardness of young people in this novel, and the Death's learning of life.People including Mort as the first in Death series, and indeed Death has big role in this novel.
Mort (Discworld, #4; Death, #1), Terry PratchettMort is a fantasy novel by British writer Terry Pratchett.
The title is the name of its main character and also a play on words: in French, mort means "death".
Just before the last stroke of midnight, Death arrives and takes Mort on as an apprentice (though his father thinks he has been apprenticed to an undertaker).
Death takes Mort to his domain, where he meets Death's elderly manservant Albert, and his adopted daughter Ysabell.
After Mort unsuccessfully tries to prevent the assassination, Death warns him that all deaths are predetermined, and that he cannot interfere with fate.
I loved this one!
I think Death is automatically a favorite character in the Discworld world, and he finally gets his own book.
Meanwhile, Mort sort of kind of accidentally-maybe seriously disturbs the fabric of reality.There are so many funny scenes and lines.
I loved all the characters.
Rincewind makes a brief appearance near the end.Here are some funny bits:He felt as if he had been shipwrecked on the Titanic, but in the nick of time had been rescued.
he said.“No, sir,” said Mort.FAMOUSE SHIPWRECK THERE.“Was there?”THERE WILL BE, said Death, IF I CAN FIND THE DAMN PLACE.
*2.5/5*I wanted to like this book so much more than I did and I’m mad!
I soon became tired of the whole schtick unfortunately and then the book seemed to drag on endlessly.
I’ve heard this book is one of Pratchett’s most popular works, so I’m worried I might just not enjoy his writing style (although I definitely thought it was clever and downright hilarious at times!
Maybe there’s hope.) I’m willing to give him another try though, so if anybody can give me a recommendation of which book/series to try next I’m all ears!
Executive Summary: Another great entry in the Discworld series as different from Equal Rites as that book was from the first two. Full Review I never expected to marathon the discworld books, but this now makes the third in a row I've read.This book is the first of the Death books. Death plays a much larger role than he has in the previous books, but for the most part it focuses on his apprentice, Mort.I found it started a bit slow, and I was pretty indifferent towards Mort. He grew on me by the
Executive Summary: Another great entry in the Discworld series as different from Equal Rites as that book was from the first two.
I never expected to marathon the discworld books, but this now makes the third in a row I've read.This book is the first of the Death books.
If you want a light, fun and fast read, you really can't go wrong with a discworld book.And the other thing I'm coming to love is the variety.
But as I've had a witches book and now a Death book, I'm ready for another Rincewind book.I've seen a few recommendations that this is a decent starting point for the new reader, and that's probably true.
This world is so vivid and imaginative, I was completely transported into this weird and wonderful universe with all its characters, including wizards, princesses, Death's daughter and of course Mort and Death himself.
Naturally Mort is clumsy, and mistake-prone, he spends a good portion of the story attempting to fix his mistake of saving the life of a princess who was supposed to die, therefore knocking all reality out of sync.
The story itself is simple to follow, what makes this book so incredible is the fantastic descriptions of the way this universe works and the different realities and places and people, which are so complex it's absolutely astounding!
Como toda historia de Terry Pratchett (al menos las tres anteriores que he leído) presenta una trama disparatada, desbordando imaginación por los cuatro costados y con un humor que hacen que sus historias sean de lo más divertidas.
Me he encontrado con la hasta ahora mi mejor lectura dentro de esta saga, parece que Pratchett encuentra el equilibrio narrativo y mayor cohesión, no meras escenas o gags como me habían parecido en las tres anteriores.
Otra de las cualidades que hay que destacar en cuanto a la edición del texto, es que la Muerte habla siempre en mayúsculas, lo cual, al menos en mi caso, aporta una voz diferente y profunda durante la lectura a su personaje.
Discworld Book 4 “Oh. I see.
Although Death appeared in the previous books, this is the one where this rather uncommon character gets more screen time to great effect.
Once more, we get a crazy tale of adventure, this time following Mort, gangly, awkward boy, who becomes Death's apprentice.
Queue all the jokes and play on words that are the staple in Discworld, but also a compelling story.
"Have you thought of going into teaching?” Personally, I preferred the previous novel Equal Rites - please don't kill me all you fans of Mort - just because the story itself caught my interest more.
Το Mort είναι ένα από τα αγαπημένα μου βιβλία και, κατά τη γνώμη μου, ένα από τα διασκεδαστικότερα, αστειότερα λογοτεχνικά έργα όλων των εποχών. Πριν λίγο καιρό έγραψα 1863 λέξεις για το βιβλίο στο PopCode, αλλά περίμενα μέχρι σήμερα, στην επέτειο των 3 χρόνων από το θάνατο του Terry Pratchett για να τις μοιραστώ κι εδώ στο Goodreads.Λείπεις, sir. #GNUTerryPratchett #SpeakHisNameMort: ★★★★★
Death has always been my favourite character in the Discworld series.
Along with Ford Prefect, maybe Jo March, definitely Dennis the Dragon, Jane Eyre & Mr Rochester (every dinner party needs some awkward marital tension!!) and Mr Darcy Mr Collins Who could resist being complimented on ones boiled potatoes?!?!?Honestly this review is pretty useless and mostly irrelevant regarding the occurrences of the book because I don't know what to say about it!!
I'm hoping to read all the books in the Death series: Mort (this one), Reaper Man, Soul Music, Hogfather and Thief of Time...
Some people do say that it's best to read the books in order to fully get all the nuances of character and plot etc but I've never found the need to do that.
Because the characters remain caricatures as the humor takes center stage.
And I actually find it kind of boring.It's not until late in each book that I started to be interested in what was actually happening.
So I think that I can enjoy Pratchett's humor on a certain level, but I'm always a bit bored until the plot and characters actually start moving and doing something.
Once that happens, I end up liking the books overall, and look forward to reading another one - only to be bored at first, wondering why I enjoyed the ones I read before.
I've stopped counting the number of times I might have read this particular bookReading any Pratchett is like meeting old childhood buddies. You might not have been in touch with each other for a long time yet even if you meet them after a decade or more, you feel hardly any time has elapsed....and always left with a bit of melancholy, thinking of the goodtimes you had...
When death comes it with his scythe brings the end of life but this time, it came to for his apprentices. His apprentice becomes Mortimer whom everyone calls Mort. Although he is a young man thought it was a great job for him will soon realize that this is not such a simple matter. Apprenticeships at Death is not such an easy task that he expected. The writer and this book make us laugh with silly stories and adventures of Discworld. Very fun book for all fans of weird and funny fantasy world.
This review contains major spoilers for the movie Pusher 3The central joke in Mort is that Death is basically, you know, just a guy doing a job. The other day, I thought of Terry Pratchett's novel for the first time in ages when we saw  I'm The Angel of Death , Nicolas Winding Refn's brilliant conclusion to the Pusher trilogy. In the first two movies, we've had several brief encounters with the terrifying Milo, a Serbian kingpin in Copenhagen's underworld. The first film ends with him and his as
This review contains major spoilers for the movie Pusher 3The central joke in Mort is that Death is basically, you know, just a guy doing a job.
He's promised to fix good Serbian food for his spoiled, arrogant daughter's 25th birthday party, and it's making him seriously tense - even though Milo's day job is running a cheap restaurant, everyone keeps joshing him about his unreliable cooking skills.
The shipment he received, which was supposed to be coke, turns out to be some pills which everyone says are ecstasy - but Milo's an old-fashioned drug lord, and he doesn't know shit about ecstasy.
I really enjoyed this Discworld novel which is about a boy called Mort who becomes Death's apprentice and things going a little bit cray-cray.
I felt like this had more of a story than the other books, though Equal Rites does have a good plot as well, and i just really enjoyed all the crazy characters as usual but in particular Death.
I loved how weird and wonderful he was and how undeath like he was I guess - I will never get the picture of Death in a kitchen with an apron and a whole family of cats out of head for..well forever!
Of all 4 Discworld novels I've read, this one is my favourite. It's a cute story and Death is definitely a funny and interesting guy. It didn't fully keep my interest though, as the story lags a bit in the middle. The writing style is clever, but the characters feel stilted at times. I've decided to stop reading the Discworld series. I just don't feel the enthusiasm I was hoping I would.
Sort of.Mort has a hard time filling in for Death when he needs a day off.
Apparently, not completing the job Death is meant to do has some pretty serious consequences that even a cameo appearance by Rincewind may not solve.One of the things I like about this series is the variety of characters and stories.
Usually I can only read a couple of books by an author and I need a break that involves at least a change of author if not a genre switch.
The stories vary so widely in this series, however, I find myself looking forward to more after each book.
Death takes on an apprentice14 August 2012 Well, while I suggested that Equal Rites must have been Pratchett's make or break book, I did not expect the brilliance of this book. After picking myself off the floor after laughing so much at some of the absolutely off the wall humour, I must say that, to put it bluntly, Terry Pratchett attempted to send the fantasy genre into a completely different direction, and succeeded. Basically Death has become board, and lonely, with his job, and wants to fin
Anyway, as mentioned, Pratchett takes the fantasy genre and pretty much turns it on its head, and that is what I actually really like about these books.
In fact, the characters in his books are unlikely heroes, and more so, that are pretty much the people that destiny not only forgets, but goes out of his way to completely ignore.
Okay, the first two books, and Equal Rites do have the great evil rising up, however the heroes that confront this evil, as mentioned, are not the people we expect would do it.
As always, Pratchett's Discworld novels are unfailingly entertaining.
In Mort, Pratchett introduces his personification of Death.
However, the familiar hooded, skeletal figure with a sickle is getting kind of bored with rushing about from deathbed to murder scene...
Mort is an awkward, clumsy farmer's son, whose inconvenient habit of asking questions has made him more in-the-way than not at home – and he's had no luck finding a position elsewhere.
So when Death shows up and offers him the job, he thinks it might be interesting.
However, when his very first job involves the destined assassination of a beautiful princess, his humanity (and love at first sight) could have disastrous consequences...
“He was determined to discover the underlying logic behind the universe. Which was going to be hard, because there wasn't one.” Parts of the story got a little muddled somewhere between the ending and the middle, but as usual the humour and the absurd characters are what brought everything around. Mort and Death are a duo that are quite enjoyable, of course with the addition of Death's noble steed, Binky. Death being the serious, completely terrifying guy who asks questions like "WHY IS THERE A

Ono kad se smeješ i pored dosadne zubobolje. To može samo Pračet.
Maštovito, duhovito, lucidno, višeslojno, inteligentno. Jednom rečju fantastično! 🤩
