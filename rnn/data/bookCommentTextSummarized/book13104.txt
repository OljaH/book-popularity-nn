I happily ‘discovered’ Rosamunde Pilcher less than two years ago when I read The Shell Seekers.
I immediately added nearly all of her novels to my list of must-read books.
Pilcher draws you into a story by the skillful introduction of her characters.
I never wanted to set this book down; never considered abandoning it.
There was a mystery surrounding the return of one character that had exited the scene twenty years ago.
Here we spend most of our time in the beautiful country of Scotland, with a couple of detours to places like London and the picturesque island of Majorca.
I have varied thoughts about “September”......my first book by Rosamunde Pilcher.There is nothing particularly extraordinary about the plot: A big party - dance - is going to take place in September for Katy on her 21st birthday.
I ‘did’ enjoy this novel - but not without a little kicking and screaming from my inner voice.My inner voice speaking: [WHEN NOT READING THIS BOOK]…”Oh, must I really get back to it?” .......”It’s slow ....and I forget the names of all the characters”.
“I’m engaged with the characters - this town - the local drama - and I’m having fun connecting with my reading group - picking apart the ‘happenings’ with the other ladies.
I enjoyed The Shell Seekers so much I jumped to read another on of her books. Pilcher's novels are full of description and character and the countryside of Scotland. At first I was not sure about her, as I was pretty sure she was on my mom's nightstand back in the day... but she's got It. Instead of a quick spicy snack, her books are a long comforting meal best eaten slowly and with a nice glass of wine. :)
Another satisfying Rosamunde Pilcher novel. I am so glad my mum told me all about her, now I seek at least one to read over the summer break - it's just that kind of wholesome soulful reading. September was a touch long, but still with that feeling of warmth, of coming home. This is the way I feel when I read Maeve Binchy, also. I like feeling this way. This is so sweet, I feel we don't think of the simple stuff anymore.  He had his supper and his bath, and was now in bed reading his library boo
September was a touch long, but still with that feeling of warmth, of coming home.
This is the way I feel when I read Maeve Binchy, also.
I like feeling this way.
These women run farms and households, help their friends and think nothing of driving 10 miles up the road to lend out their tablecloths and vases.
September is the best time of year, and an entire family are coming home, first loves and long absences are being discovered in Scotland.
The thought of boarding school to an only son who’ll dreadfully miss his mum.
I think I'd like to re-visit that cast of characters.
I like Rosamunde Pilcher. Her novels manage to give home-making the importance and satisfaction it deserves. I always want to tidy up my home and put out some fresh flowers after finishing one of her books. She has strong, older female characters who seem so real. This is a great read for . . . what else, September! :)
I finished this book last week again for maybe the 10th time. Everytime I read it, I love it more and more. It's a book that pulls you into the beautiful world of Scotland and weaves you through the lives of well-rounded, fascinating characters.
It has that warm, Pilcher feel and the complicated twists and turns, and glamorous characters and settings, but it lacks meaning and cohesiveness and in the end seems much ado about nothing.I read it back in the early 90s when it was released, and I remembered absolutely nothing about it.
I imagine it left me confused and cold the first time around as well.I did enjoy the first half of the book and felt the requisite curiosity about how these relationships were going to develop.
That is how this one left me feeling.So, if you want to read a lovely, warm Pilcher that hangs together and makes sense, please read Coming Home.
In this beautifully told tale, we meet wonderful characters, the Airds, the the Ishaks, The Lord and Lady Balmerino, and so many others.
This novel was ever so beautifully done.
It was cozy and warm and filled this reader with the sense that one really was able to know the characters.
They became real and were people one longed to know as friends and neighbors.
How nice to be able to read a novel where family and friends were the focus and life was dependent on the goodness and acceptance of others.
The only thing I wish is that we had a chance to follow up with all of these characters in a later book.
Instead we follow Edmund and Virginia Aird and their family (their son Henry and his daughter, Alexa, along with his mother Vi).
We follow some other characters who will impact the characters above, one named Noel who appears to have a loose connection to the Aird family.
Also a long-time servant/nanny whose creepy cousin seems hell-bent on destroying the Aird family.
She does such a great job that you may want to run out and book a trip to Scotland right away.The ending was messy, but it worked.
Totul rămâne exact aşa cum a fost.
Eu sunt eu şi tu eşti tu, iar viaţa de demult, trăită împreună şi pe care am iubit-o din toate puterile e neatinsă, neschimbată.
Spune-mi pe nume, ca şi până acum.
Vorbeşte cu sinceritate despre mine, ca şi până acum.
Încearcă să râzi, aşa cum râdeam împreună de glumele care ni se păreau la fel de bune.
Fie ca numele meu să fie rostit în familie, la fel ca şi până acum.
Ce este oare moartea, decât un accident neglijabil?
De ce să fiu uitată, numai pentru că am dispărut?

Rosamunde Pilcher writes very “readable” stories. I enjoy all of her books, but some more than others. Please note that I have rated this book compared to the author’s other novels. It was good, but she has written better.I had no idea that the Noel in this book was the same Noel from “The Shell Seekers”. To tell you the truth, I didn’t recognize him at all and was pretty surprised when it finally dawned on me  of the way into the book. It presented a bit of a dilemma for me since I HATED Noel i
To tell you the truth, I didn’t recognize him at all and was pretty surprised when it finally dawned on me ¾ of the way into the book.
It presented a bit of a dilemma for me since I HATED Noel in “The Shell Seekers”, and had liked him in this book – right up until I realized who he was.
2 of the main characters are named:Mrs. Violet Aird (frequently referred to as “Vi”)Mrs. Virginia AirdWhy?
But couldn’t the author have named one of these characters Mary?

4 stars - English novel - I have dyslexia -In my notebook : beautiful scenes with beautiful painted characters. 😁🦋😁
A huge saga that looks at the lives of two main families and their friends over a 4 month period. A large cast of characters that resulted in me having to write the names on a list. A slow moving story - it never boring - covers a few different countries - a few dramas - and a huge secret revealed. As per usual with a Pilcher novel every aspect of human lives - feuds, love, illness and friendship, was an easy read.
I had a really hard time getting through this book. I thought that there was too many characters that were hard to keep track of. I had a hard time keeping all of the relationships straight. It was very descriptive--to the point of being to descriptive. I started skipping over a lot of the description. I really enjoyed the last 100 pages, but for the 600 before that I thought numerous times about quitting.
3/4....jedan vrlo ugodan stil pisanja.
Really hard to keep the names straight. There is Violet, Virginia, Verena, Vi and seems like there is one I’m forgetting. Really!
Ως προς το Σεπτέμβρη παρακολουθούμε δυο φιλικές οικογένειες σε ένα χωριό της Σκοτίας που ετοιμάζονται για τον Σεπτεμβριάτικο χορό.
Από παντού ξεχύνεται ο Σεπτέμβρης και η μελαγχολία που τον συνοδεύει ενόψει του μακριού, ατέλειωτου χειμώνα, ειδικά στη Σκοτία, όπου τα σπίτια αλλά και γενικά τα χωριά είναι απομακρυσμένα και οι καιρικές συνθήκες δύσκολες.
Θα σταθώ στην Παντόρα, μία από τις ηρωίδες του βιβλίου, την πιο τραγική.
Που είχε ξελογιάσει έναν παντρεμένο κι εκείνος της είχε υποσχεθεί πράγματα αλλά αφοσιώθηκε στον γάμο του τελικά και την ξέχασε.
Μετά από 20 χρόνια την καλούν στο πάρτι του Σεπτέμβρη.
It took me some time to get into the book, which is quite long. Had to keep track of a lot of characters all in different places and make sense of their relationships. Once that was acquired, it became one of those great Rosamunde Pilcher novels. With, in fact, some characters that were also in The Shellseekers. I wish I had more Pilcher to read, besides her short stories, which I will probably never read as I am not a short story lover.A good read all in all.
I vividly remember the first time I read this book: I was just starting graduate school, and I had arrived in Houston, Texas, exhausted and strung out from a long summer of working nights and having too many romances.
Edmund wants to send their 8 year old son Henry away to boarding school, while Virginia is very much against this plan.
Another major story-line revolves around the 'glamorous' character of Pandora Balmerino, who is a sort of prodigal daughter.
I love Rosamunde Pilcher, really, I do.
The scenic landscape of Scotland alone could almost take me happily through half a book.
This starts off okay, but I feel like this just went flat.
Oh, I still sing the praises of Rosamunde Pilcher and I still have so many of her novels yet to enjoy.
This great lady has written two of my favorite novels of all time, The Shell Seekers and Coming Home.
Yet, I came away from this offering feeling as though the bloom of romance had faded and I was left with an empty ache inside.
Two and a half stars rounded up to three.
What a lovely, languid, comfortable book!
I adore these books by Pilcher, where you sink into comfortable surroundings and spend time pottering about with people.
Not very much too grand or dramatic happens for much of the story.
You just read it as if you were vacationing in these people's steadfast, amiable lives.
There are a few less than stellar reviews which have dunned the story for a particular plot point.
After reading the reviews I was dreading the event.
But I must say it is very organic to the story.
That said, I think this is a wonderful book.
However there are several characters invited to the dance who come from a variety of backgrounds and life experiences, and who make choices that affect not only themselves but their loved ones.Edmund and Virginia Aird must decide whether sending their young son Henri to boarding school is a tradition they want to keep.
Historical novels to immerse myself in another time period), I like to once in a while, read ‘escapist’ fiction; light, cosy, fireside books that I can lose myself in for just a few hours.
O carte deosebita, cu multe personaje, cu foarte multe descrieri, cu povesti de viata interesante. Chiar o recomand. Recenzia completa curand pe site!Recenzia completa pe blog:http://stildescriitor.ro/blog/2018/11...
Rosamunde Pilcher is a delightful writer, a WONDERFUL story-teller and the queen of descriptive writing. The book is perfectly detailed just enough that it doesn't become daunting. This is a family saga that follows the lives of 2 families; the Aird's and the Balmerino's. So many beautifully developed characters that became a part of my life. Perfect read for Autumn!
Rosamunde Pilcher is one of those authors I return to, again and again.
Pilcher characters grow with you, there is a depth to them that is often found lacking in popular novels.
An Army veteran comes to terms with his experiences and Violet Aird watches over them all.Pilcher's descriptions of Scotland are beautiful.
It's a story that warms your heart and one that you can return to over and over again, like a favorite sweater or a good friend.
While not a sequel to The Shell Seekers, it does continue the story of Noel Keeling, Penelope's son, as he is involved with Alexa Aird.
Divna topla priča sa predivnim opisima škotskih pejzaža i divnim stilom pisanja....<3
I thought I knew what this book was about...nope! Once again, Rosamunde Pilcher completely wrapped me up in her beautifully written book. I cannot wait to get my hands on more!!!
First book this year to make me ugly cry...and I loved it. Pilcher knows how to write about complicated and flawed characters that you love so much. She's even better at complicated family dynamics. This book was lovely.
