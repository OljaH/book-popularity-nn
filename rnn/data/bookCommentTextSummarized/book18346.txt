No. He was not here to wreak revenge.For revenge was trifling and hollow.No. He was not here to retrieve his wife.For his wife was not a thing to be retrieved.No. He was not here to negotiate a truce.For a truce suggested he wished to compromise.He was here to burn something to the ground. A very worthy sequel and conclusion to this magical, romantic story.I said in my review of The Wrath & the Dawn that I'm just not much of a romantic person. I hate instalove, most love triangles, and gene
That being said, there is something about this world, its curses and its magic, that completely melts my heart.The Rose & the Dagger has the same evocative, beautiful writing as the first installment, but it is less about the romance.
It is infinitely more impressive to see a woman overcome her fears and decide to be strong, rather than simply being born that way.Perhaps most of all, I love the final rise of "girl power" at the novel's climax.
1,001 Nights is a sexist story at its heart, and I was a little concerned about the way The Wrath & the Dawn simply turned it into a lusty romance.
This book is everything I wanted in a sequel. EVERYTHING. I don't know how Renee Ahdieh managed to make it even more amazing than the already amazing WRATH AND THE DAWN. Black magic, perhaps? Or maybe she's just insanely talented. Whatever the case, I adore this book. It's suspenseful, thoughtful, beautiful and sexy, a perfect follow-up to WRATH.  In fact, I think I'm going to go reread it.
“I denied myself what I wanted once out of principle, and not a day goes by that I don’t regret that decision with every fiber of my being!”Every word and touch of his was nearly unbearable to read.I mean even he agreed towards the end that he was a fool.“Tariq knew then—as he’d known when he’d read the letter Shahrzad kept tucked in her cloak—that this was not an ordinary love born of a passing fancy.In truth, Tariq had known even then that he could not win.
4:50 AM, just finished. WHAT IS SLEEP.Actual rating: 4.5 stars, for minor issues. I really loved this book <3.
4.5 Stars  The rose’s rarest essence lives in the thorns. The Rose and The Dagger is an exquisite, superb, satisfying and clever finale. It will render you speechless with its intensity. Crush your heart a bit every few pages. Transform you into an addict of its gorgeous prose. But its true beauty lies in the fact that, somehow, you welcome it all with open arms.  If you don't get along with romance, shy away. Seriously, shoo. I'm just putting it like it is -- the romance and love story are what
First, there's the fact that, thanks to the multiple POVs, it's not just Khalid and Shazi's dreamy love that has readers all hot and bothered and ethereally happy.
There were so many instances were women had a role in the novels, starting with Khalid's mother's death that changed him forever, then the cruel curse unraveled because of a woman, 100 women doomed to die and a freaking war started because of a woman (insert Shazi here), the plot evolved thanks to these glorious characters and so they became the axis of the world and girls continued to omen the legacy in TRaTD.
But Khalid and Shahrzad, the Caliph and Calipha of Khorasan, found the purest and most powerful magic of all.
But it also healed my wounded heart, which blossomed like a rose, and filled me with hope, peace, and, most importantly, love.
It is true that the first chapters were a little underwhelming, which was the effect of Khalid and Shahrzad's separation, but when their paths were aligned once more, everything fell back into place.I was once more ensnared.
The relationship between Khalid and Shahrzad was beautiful.
That's how much I loved The Rose & the Dagger.From the stars, to the stars.
4.5* SPOILER FREE REVIEW: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUv30...I did really enjoy this one, not quite as much as the first one but I think it was overall a really great duology!

Some chapters were paced a bit slow, but I was NOT bored at all during any part of this book.It was great to see our characters finally find peace with themselves and others.
And if you thought Khalid was swoon-worthy in The Wrath and the Dawn, wait until you see him in The Rose and the Dagger.I found that the ending felt a little rushed but it was still bittersweet nonetheless.
The Rose & the Dagger  was definitely a satisfying sequel to one of my favorite reads of 2015!
I do prefer  The Wrath & the Dawn  but I'm happy with the conclusion to this duology!I chose to listen to the audiobook of this novel, which I think was a mistake on my part.
I felt there should have been another few chapters before the epilogue, or at least an expansion of the scenes leading up to the end.I really enjoyed this read and will continue to recommend > The Wrath & the Dawn  duology!
THE REVIEW IS POSTED   Love gave life to the lifeless. It was the greatest of all living powers.  I honestly don't know what to talk about because this book  fucking ruined  me and left me without any words to utter from my mouth. I'm not complaining though. It's such a best feeling when books destroy me and hurt me emotionally and this book also lived up to my expectations. I swear I was so terrified when I started reading this book because I liked the first book but I nearly did not finish th
I loved all the characters in this book, well except some people though because they got on my nerves and they made me wish bad things upon them.
I rarely cry these days but Ms. Ahdieh's books always make cry and just like I said that I loved all the characters in this book.
I will surely miss all of these characters and I even felt sad when I finished reading this book because I enjoyed reading it and I still wanted to be with my friends and the people that I really liked but I was also happy when I finished it.
I would be the listener, enraptured by her words, nodding my head every two seconds, my body still and my eyes fixed on her.Except that would not be a conversation exactly, now would it?
Even the few stories told are done so orally.Since I oh so enjoyed listening to what the characters had to say—and by extension the author herself—I couldn’t have been happier reading this book.
And now that I think about it, most books I end up disliking have little or tedious discourse between characters.Character and conversation-driven story.
❝It was because they were two parts of a whole. He did not belong to her. And she did not belong to him. It was never about belonging to someone. It was about belonging together.❞ Rating: ★★★★**THIS REVIEW CONTAINS ONE SPOILER FROM BOOK 1 AND ONE OR TWO FROM THIS BOOK**This was the kind of book that left me asking myself What do I do with my life now?  and also Why hadn't I started the 1st book before?The ending was a beautiful and magical ending. But this book had all those swinging moments -
Oh gosh okay I just need to read more of Renée Ahdie.I love you Renée.
And also, just to say this once and for all, I’ve disliked Tariq since the beginning.• I didn’t ship him with Shazi.• He turned into a rude ass in this book.• There were moments where I felt like he betrayed her in some way, wanting to find out.• He is part of the reason why Khalid and Shazi were separated for a while although Jalal was part of it as well.
Like, I’m actually glad we all have different opinions on books and characters and plots and everything you know?
while i saw ‘the wrath and the dawn’ as a clever love story intertwined with nuances of folklore legend and mystery, ‘the rose and the dagger’ is a daring tale of adventure and reckless abandonment.
she has mastered the art of duologies - by not stretching out a story past its limits, but also delivering enough so the reader doesnt feel cheated.
this book (and series) delivered on all fronts.
and it has definitely made me interested in looking into the tales of a thousand and one nights and experiencing the magic at its source.so sad, and yet so satisfied, this story is over.
4.5 stars. Trying to decide if I want to round up or down, so I'll round down for now. VERY worthy sequel/conclusion novel. ***Review posted on The Eater of Books! blog***The Rose & The Dagger by Renee AhdiehBook Two of The Wrath & The Dawn seriesPublisher: G.P. Putnam's Sons Books for Young ReadersPublication Date: April 26, 2016Rating: 4 starsSource: Preordered copySummary (from Goodreads):I am surrounded on all sides by a desert. A guest, in a prison of sand and sun. My family is here
With the help of a tattered old carpet and a tempestuous but sage young man, Shahrzad will attempt to break the curse and reunite with her one true love.What I Liked:I already know that I have no idea how to review this book.
So don't mind too much if this review is short or vague or a bunch of fangirling!At the end of The Wrath & The Dawn, Shahrzad left Khorasan - and Khalid - and went to the desert, where her family had taken refuge.
And you know how much I love a good HEA!What I Did Not Like:Khalid and Jalal have a sort of, um, disagreement, in this book.
*4.5 STARS*
It is everything a devoted fan could ask of a series conclusion.My problem was -is- that Shahrzad and Khalid's relationship never spoke to me; actually, I think my appreciation of the above-mentioned couple is fundamentally undermined by 1) the insta-love (don't try to deny it; seriously, don't) and 2) the fact that, in The Wrath and the Dawn, (view spoiler)[their first intercourse, if you think of it, happens under the banner of "I'm your husband, we're supposed to do this, we will do this" and, as if that were not enough, when it is openly specified that Khalid never touched his wives before they were sent to die.
Arabian Nights are fast thrilling epic stories mixing with a passionate love story, that really takes you a whole new world...And this different retelling still one of the kind that worth your time..complete with Love, curse, Black Magic...BUT it didn't live up to the epic that start building up in book one and its grand ending..For a duology it could've been faster, more focused.
Though it picks up right after the epic finale of book one… the first half of the book lacks thriller or any new "important" events.Some good drama scenes was here but lost in many filler ones.The story mainly about Shahrazad searching for a way to stop the curse on her Beloved Khaled..and the spell of the dark book with her father..
A fitting conclusion for a book filled with cautionary tales. Full review to come.
Soooo Shahrzad is beautiful. Like really beautiful. Did you know Shahrzad is beautiful?Everyone thinks about Shahrzad's beauty when they see her... She also has a temper but it's okay because she's pretty. Pretty. PRETTY!!!So yeah... this wasn't for me.
Possibly more of a 4.5/5 starsI AM REALLY EMOTIONAL RIGHT NOW OKAY?I really loved this, but I don't think I loved it as much as TWATD.The world building and plot and characters were still ON POINT and FAB, but things felt like they moved a little too fast and jumped around a bit too much.Regardless, I thought this was a really solid sequel and I enjoyed it so much.
Definitely cried a few times.
The writing was as beautiful as ever, SO GORG.
I want to take quotes from this book and write them and frame them everYWHERE.Solid solid duology - 10/10 would recommend.
I just found out this is a duology. Good! My heart can't take another cliffhanger like that.I NEED THE BOOK NOW. NOT IN A FREAKING YEAR.
this book gave me aladdin feels10/10 would recommendbut seriously SUCH AN AMAZING CONCLUSION HOLY CRAP. I think this is my absolute favorite duology ever.
This was absolutely stunning. It is different from Wrath, but I loved it just as much. It's filled with swoons and action and heartbreak and twists and I loved every single page of it. Perhaps I'll write a coherent review when release gets closer.
It didn’t take long for me to be once again trapped in a flurry of emotions for these characters that captivated me from the very start.
*sniffs* (hide spoiler)] I do not usually approve of love triangles but in this story, it’s not only beautiful but it also seems necessary as it is the plot’s very core uniting the two heroes in their mission because of their love for the same, strong-spirited woman who is not only beautiful (I admit I was a bit annoyed at the countless times her beauty was mentioned) but brilliant, smart, snarky and selfless as well.
It’s true some wars can be won before they even get started just like this series winning my heart over without a fight.
LOVED THIS BOOK! SUCH AN AMAZING DUOLOGY! IM SO SAD ITS OVER BUT I SO ENJOYED THE RIDE! DO YOU GUYS WANT A REVIEW VIDEO ON THIS?!
Stunning cover is stunning. I think I love it more than the first one.
I loved Shazi and Khalid, serious heart eyes.
And there were the characters I still don't like.
Shazi's father (also very effing stubborn.), basically every other character.
As a conclusion to a duology, I did not like it.
The revelations and plot twists did surprise me and the ending was heart eyes and heart throbs and rainbow stained tears but overall I simply wish this hadn't been a duology, I wish more events had gotten in the way of the characters, and for that, I personally like to have that all build up between a book or two.
"Where is your heart, Sharzad al-Khayzuran?" His voice was course in its insistence.In an alley by the souk. In a night of oblivion.In the promise of tomorrow."  Initial reaction: Well, I finally finished this after weeks of reading slump. I'm giving this a generous four stars because I had some problems with it, but really really wanted to love it the way I loved the first book. Renee Ahdieh is an amazing romance writer, but a not so amazing fantasy writer, in my opinion. Nevertheless, this bo
I'm giving this a generous four stars because I had some problems with it, but really really wanted to love it the way I loved the first book.
I wrote my review in list format, it seemed the best way to convey my thoughts:Things I Loved About The First Book:1.
No world-building, no explanation of magic, messy and pointless elements of plot, everything resolved waaaaaaay too easily (view spoiler)[ like okay, we have to destroy this book to break the curse.
(hide spoiler)] Honestly, this book made me question Khalid a little.
I love these characters, I love Renee Ahdieh's writing, and I was happy with the way the story ended.
3.5 StarsOverview:  “It was because they were two parts of a whole. He did not belong to her. And she did not belong to him. It was never about belonging to someone. It was about belonging together.”  Just like the first book, I’m conflicted. There were parts I loved and parts I thought were very unnecessary. Pros:Surprisingly, I really loved the relationship between Shazi and Khalid. In the first book, I had a lot of issues with it ethically, and while those issues are still kind of there, the
In the first book, I had a lot of issues with it ethically, and while those issues are still kind of there, their relationship as a whole seems much more mature.
They both love with this intensity and it was kind of beautiful how fiercely protective they both were.The fantasy element was explored in more depth here, and was a lot of fun!Familial relationships are often one of my favorites, and I loved the focus on Shazi’s sister, Irsa.
Though I liked it more this round, I still feel there are some weird undertones in Shazi/Khalid’s whole relationship (which are addressed) and I often wondered why they fell for each other in the first place.
“Give me a meaningful love or a beautiful death!”Simply exquisite. A book of dreams,struggleswishescorruptionfullfillmentheartachelovesacraficemagic  This book utterly takes my breath away. The writing is beautiful and the story has depth. Characters are developped, there is sadness and despair, there is tragedy. There is also love, magic and hope. This is a tale as old as time that will always be timeless.  “It was because they were two parts of a whole. He did not belong to her. And she did no
If you are like me and read the wrath and the dawn but neglected to pick up the rose & the dagger for a long time, stop neglecting it.
I knew Jahandar was killing himself in the end of that chapter but I didn’t know that he did that while saving Khalid.
Until they mentioned his scar, then I was like OHHHHH I SEE WHAT HE DID.I thought the last chapter/epilogue was really cute and pleased me to see how the characters were living.
I SHIP IT!I also loved when Yasmine, Despina and Shazi worked together because that was one of things I wanted to see comign out of the first book.
