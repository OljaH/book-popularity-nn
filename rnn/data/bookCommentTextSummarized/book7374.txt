Completing an arc begun in The Secret of the Unicorn, the story tells of young reporter Tintin and his friend Captain Haddock as they launch an expedition to the Caribbean to locate the treasure of the pirate Red Rackham.تاریخ نخستین خوانش: روز نخست ماه دسامبر سال 2002 میلادیعنوان: گنج‌های راكام؛ نویسنده: هرژه؛ مترجم: خسرو سمیعی؛ تهران، یونیورسال، 1354، در 62 ص؛ موضوع: داستانهای فکاهی مصور از نویسندگان بلژیکی - سده 20 مگنجهای راکهام دوازدهمین کتاب از مجموعه ی کتابهای مصور ماجراهای تن‌ تن و میلو است.
این کتاب دنباله‌ ای بر راز اسب شاخدار است، و برای نخستین بار، در سال 1944 میلادی، توسط: هرژه نوشته، طراحی، و به چاپ رسیده است.
Tintin and Captain Haddock found all the clues to where the treasure is, now they just have to get there and recover it.
It really pisses Captain Haddock off.Thompson and Thomson are along for the ride.
For entertainment purposes there's monkeys with a loaded gun, a population of parrots that has passed down Haddock swearing for generations and Tintin fighting a shark.
But that's part of the charm.So definitely core Tintin.
It couples well with the story before it and both would make the logical introductory Tintin's for a new reader.
Το "Ο θησαυρός του Κόκκινου Ράκαμ" αποτελεί άμεση συνέχεια του τόμου "Το μυστικό του Μονόκερου", οπότε καλύτερα να διαβάσετε πρώτα εκείνο και μετά αυτό.
Δεν χρειάζεται να πω και πολλά για την ιστορία ή το σχέδιο, πάνω-κάτω ισχύουν τα ίδια για όλους (ή σχεδόν όλους, έστω!) τους τόμους της εξαιρετικής αυτής σειράς: Τραγελαφικές καταστάσεις, υπερβολές, ωραίες περιπέτειες σε εξωτικά μέρη, ευχάριστο χιούμορ...
Τώρα μπορώ να δω επιτέλους και την ταινία κινουμένων σχεδίων "The Adventures of Tintin" (2011), που βασίζεται σε τρία κόμικς της σειράς: "Ο κάβουρας με τις χρυσές δαγκάνες", "Το μυστικό του Μονόκερου" και "Ο θησαυρός του Κόκκινου Ράκαμ".

Blistering Barnacles! That was repeated way too often. I love treasure hunting stories and Tintin... so it worked out! :)Calculus was hilarious. I love British humour.
Red Rackham's Treasure is the second part of an adventure begun in The Secret of the Unicorn, rendered in highly realistic comic book/graphic novel style by the Belgian artist/writer Herge in the mid-1940s.
This story of a hunt for lost pirate treasure takes Tintin, his dog Snowy, the ill-tempered Captain Haddock, and the comically inept detectives Thompson and Thomson on a long sea journey on a freighter, to a tropical island, and on an adventure under the sea.
Another wonderful book!!
I don't know what to say, I may repeat what I said in my earlier reviews as I am out of words to describe how best are THE ADVENTURES OF TINTIN!!The film inspired me to read all the books, though I have seen cartoons, it always gives a good feeling if u read the books!
Many people, who read the comics first, said that the film has not done justice to the books, but I donot agree!!
Both book and the film are equally wonderful and being a fan of films, I take one step towards the film!!
This is by far the funniest adventure of this ever enlarging group composed now by Tintin and Milu, Captain Haddock, The brothers Dupond and Dupont, Nestor and M. Tournesol... the incredibly deaf and funny character, the typical "crazy scientist and inventor"!They set on a journey to find Rackham's treasure and they succeed, but through so many funny inuendos and changes to their plans that you will enjoy it totally!Maria Carmo,Lisbon 14 January 2015.

"گنج راکهام سرخ پوش" در کنار "راز اسب تک شاخ" از شاهکارهای هرژه محسوب می شود. یکپارچگی این دو کتاب در کل کارهای هرژه بی نظیر است.
I fucking love Tintin.
I feel like this and the previous volume are where this series really came into its own.I appreciated that there were no enemies in this one. The only antagonist is the mystery, and Tintin and Co.’s ability to work together.In general the panels take up more space, the dialogue is a bit more sparse... just more breathing room overall. And a few absolutely gorgeous panels showing the ocean, the jungle and the sunken ship. Some of my major complaints with Tintin (too much dialogue and text, too many coincidences and near escapes) are addressed in this book.
I remember listening to these over and over again when I was a smaller human being. Still holds up.
I must confess if Calculus wasn't in this story, it would be dull. Loved those parts when he got on Haddock's nerves. 😂 I love treasure hunting tales and this book tickled me to death. ⚓🚢
The Cast is Complete7 February 2012 I would suggest that this is the last of the war novels, though by the time that this was released the war was almost over (I believe Belgium had been at least partially liberated, and Hitler and the Japanese were on the back foot, though there was still a lot of war to fight at this stage). Most of the album takes place at sea (which is similar to the other war albums) and it noticeably has no antagonist - it is purely a treasure hunt. While the threat of the
This album also brings in the last of the major Tintin characters: Professor Cuthbert Calculus.
Up until this point most of the scientists that Tintin had encountered have been eccentric, however Calculus, becoming a major character, becomes the eccentric scientist and all of the scientists that appear afterwards tend to be much more level headed.
This in a way sets the scene for the later books, indicating the characters that will end up playing major roles in the stories.
In a way it can be suggested that Red Rackham's Treasure marks the completion of the Tintin world, and now we move on to the other adventures.
"Red Rackham's Treasure" is the second TinTin book, and my understanding is that it is sort of attached to the first adventure "The Secret of the Unicorn" which I will read next.
And that alone is worth the attention, and seeing how Hergé works and thinks, this has to be an important aspect to the aesthetic of TinTin. This book as well as the others I will read shortly are young reader's edition's, which is exactly (at least I have been told that) the same as the original, except the images are bigger, and each title has an additional 20 pages of bonus material, which is quite interesting.
One of the best childhood memories..inget dulu sempet baca beberapa buku punya papa..=))Dari dulu, tiap kali baca Tintin aku selalu sampe ke pertanyaan " ya ampun dia koq ga mati-mati sih?" emang sih dia ga mungkin mati karna secara dia tokoh utamanya.
dalam satu buku tu aku itung-itung dia bisa ampir mati sepuluh kali dan ada aja yang nyelamatin dia.ketembak?
tenang, pasti dia punya lencana di balik bajunya yang nahan peluru.
tenang, pasti deket situ bakal ada tabib yang nganggur dan langsung nolong dia.
buku anak-anak itu emang karakter tokohnya kuat banget ya..seneng deh bisa punya satu kata atau julukan yang bisa ngegambarin tokoh-tokohnya.
La suite directe du Secret de la Licorne, et le plus drôle des Tintin jusqu'ici. 5/5 rien que pour les interactions hilarantes entre le professeur Tournesol (fraichement débarqué : voilà enfin l'équipe au complet !) et le capitaine Haddock. L'intrigue en elle-même n'est pas d'une complexité extrême : il s'agit de retrouver le fameux trésor en mer, qu'on finit après de nombreuses tentatives infructueuses, par découvrir ailleurs : à Moulinsart bien sûr ! Un album très plaisant, on est vraiment entré depuis quelques titres dans la grande période de Tintin.
Follow-up to The Secret of the Unicorn is Red Rackham's Treasure and it's not quite as enjoyable in terms of the central mystery but it's still fun. Notable especially for the introduction of Professor Calculus, the culmination of all of Herge's previous absent-minded, elderly-inventor-characters.Great to see how frustrated Haddock gets with Calculus too :)For those who may have only seen the Spielberg/Jackson movie version of this and the preceding comic, definitely worth a look to see how and where the two have combined or dropped elements of the original plot.
calculus getting on haddock's nerves is just hilarious;check out the parrots!
4/5Now this is what I'm talking about! Adventure, intrigue, humor, and wit. This is one of the books that inspired the 2011 movie. I wish there were more of this in the animation, or at least some in the second movie Spielberg says they're still doing (fingers crossed!).   "Me, afraid?...Afraid of what?...Afraid of whom?...Afraid of you, perhaps? Captain Haddock fears nothing! You understand? We weigh anchor at dawn tomorrow, no matter what anyone says!" It is in this volume that we meet Profess
I wish there were more of this in the animation, or at least some in the second movie Spielberg says they're still doing (fingers crossed!).
Captain Haddock fears nothing!
It is in this volume that we meet Professor Cuthbert Calculus.
He volunteers a submarine-like contraption for the team to use in aid to find the treasure of Red Rackham, the pirate whom Captain Haddock's ancestor killed aboard the Unicorn.
We also get a fair share of the Thompson twins and their silliness, as well as a bit of humor with Snowy and the pendant Calculus is always twirling around...
Ah, all such peculiar characters on board together :D
Le gag con il Professor Girasole e coi due detective sono impagabili.
You can't go wrong with Tin Tin! Loved this one ^_^
its ok
I was very sceptical about seeing the recent movie version, but a French friend said she thought it was well done and faithful to the books (it is an amalgam of three of the stories).
I highly recommend this particular format/edition for the wonderful section at the end about the real life inspiration for Tintin's adventures.
for example, Herge bases the sunken ship The Unicorn on the sunken Swedish ship the Vasa.The Herge archives contain thousands of pictures and clippings that the author used for ideas and drawings.
If you are not already a Tintin fan, these are great adventures to start with.
This is probably the most famous story of the Tintin series, made popular in the 2011 movie (which deviates significantly from the books).
These two books not only have a gripping and fast-paced storyline, but are also brilliant because we are finally introduced to Nestor and, more importantly, Professor Calculus.
'Red Rackham's Treasure' was better than 'Secret of the Unicorn' only for the fact that it's the first time we have all our favourite characters (Tintin, Snowy, Captain Haddock, Thomson and Thompson, and Professor Calculus) together.
It is in this book Tintin meets Professor Cuthbert Calculus for the first time.
His underwater machine turns out to be invaluable, even though Tintin and Captain Haddock at first reject it.This book is faster paced and more interesting than the first of the two and contains a lot of enjoyable humor.
Professor Calculus is hard of hearing (almost deaf), and the book is filled with a lot of comic situations arising from the Professors condition.
Overall a very good comic book, but not among the better of the Tintin adventures.
My second Tintin story.
I am a newcomer to the "fun" of reading comics and graphic novels.
I picked a couple of these up at the library and sat them on the coffee table wondering if there would be any interest from my family, particularly my 13 year-old son.
There are two more stories in this book but I don't know if I will read them or not.
I don't find the graphics very artistic and the format necessarily leaves much of the detail to be filled in by the reader's imagination.
Furthermore, I'm not sure if it's supposed to be funny.
