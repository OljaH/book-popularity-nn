She loves him a lot but is way to inexpressive to tell him about her love for him.So,he misses the beloved - kind nature of Sarmila, which she’s unable to explain it to him through words,but he reveres her for deep caring nature of hers.
Rabindranath Tagore whose known as myriad minded person,has compiled a story of truly great class,in simple and authentic words which falls in line with the Title,I loved the story for its plot and the way the story was carved out of it and the climax was also very special as it turned out to be an unexpected one.
"The life of two sisters, the understanding between the minds of sisters in marvelous, how does a woman mind think for life, and every other life-story is easily understandable. Tagore sir is a lucid thinker"
Woman....WOO-MAN (Man representing our human species) is a symbol of submission, adoration, affection, idolatry, fervor, zeal, lust and LOVE.Love can be the intoxication, an ardent flame of overwhelming lava that blinds you to the morals of this world OR it can be an unnoticed godly worship, calm and silent in nature whose sudden absence can make life toxic.
Its a contrast of two sisters, the chadrma (moon) and the suryama (sun)....
of day and night, of spring and winter.No matter which one you fall for, its an inevitable phenomena for its an attribute of God and can not left unreflected in His supreme creation.
Nice simple book. Shows the dilemma in comprehending love: a momentary obsession, or an unnoticed everyday necessity?
Tagore was speaking and writing about love, lust and incest 72 years ago. Otherwise an easy quick story about 2 sisters - the beloved and the mother kind.
