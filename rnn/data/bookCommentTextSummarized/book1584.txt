I loved this book. It is great for undersatnding the importance of our behavior. I recommend it to anyone interested in psychology and human behavior in general.
This book will make you mad, but want to read more.
The essentials on understanding behavior, NOT "the mind". Originally from the 1920's or 30's, a majority of modern psychology is based on it.
