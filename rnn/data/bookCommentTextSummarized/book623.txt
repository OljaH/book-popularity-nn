This was my first exposure to the concept of self-hypnosis (I was 12.) I wouldn't understand its power for another 15 years, but now that I do, I recommend this book to everyone.
This is the first book I read. I was 15 years old and since then I have not stopped reading. Today, I write personal development books.
Chapter 4 is the only chapter about hypnosis.
It's hard for me to rate this book.
On the one hand, it taught me how to self-hypnotize, which on its own is a very nice thing.
Self-hypnotism is something I have tried in the past, and had not yet succeeded at.
Now that I have experienced it, I can really understand the value of self-hypnotism as a tool to better understand yourself, and to heal yourself.
So for that I am grateful to have found this book.
But I suspect I could have easily found a better and more modern treatment of the subject.
This book is pretty outdated in a lot of ways.
Interesting concepts, but outdated, misogynistic and superficial.
This was my dad's book.
