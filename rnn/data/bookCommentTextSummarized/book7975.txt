Leave it to Trixie Belden to discover a mystery while cleaning the attic at Crabapple Farm!
The Bob Whites of the Glen are helping the Beldens clear out their attic and barn.
Trixie Belden was my favorite teenage sleuth when I was a kid.
I had the entire series of books and read them over and over again.
I had a great time re-visiting the story.
:) The Mystery of the Emeralds is the 14th Trixie Belden book.
The Trixie Belden series has 39 books and was written from 1948-1986.
I really wish I knew which authors wrote which books in the series!
This...was actually a pretty good adventure, though not much of a mystery aside from Trixie and Honey's detective work to find the emerald necklace.
Aside from a moment of misdirection about who the villain was, it played out smoothly, and whoever the syndicate writer was did some good research.
There's always a point in a Trixie Belden mystery where the story goes off into Wholesome Educational Material, in this case Colonial reenactment history, but this is less obnoxious than most.
My lone memory of this one is Trixie nearly suffocating in the secret stairwell, but that beats not remembering anything.
Bland compared to other Trixie books I've read, but Jim is still the best.
THIS is my other "most favorite" of the series. I am not sure why I love this one so much, but I do. It was such thrill for me two summers ago to finally get to go to Williamsburg and see it "up close and personal". I would love to go back and really do the tours and have a full day of it. The good that the Bob-Whites do in this book is another reason I love this read!!!~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Plus, it is a mystery based on cursed jewels, or 'jool' as Mart would say, and a letter dating back to the Civil War. This type of mystery, versus criminal activity, appeals to me more.But, that being said, the Trixie series is wonderful about mixing up different types of mystery: criminal activity, personal mysteries, historical mysteries, and puzzle mysteries.
This is one thing I love about the series.In the Mystery of the Emeralds, Trixie and the gang are off to find cursed emeralds lost since the Civil War times, and long-distance family members connected to the necklace have long given up any thought to the story even being real.
Though this wasn't very fast-paced, there was an actual mystery mixed in with some history of the Civil War so that was good. Dan didn't go on this trip and that's why the rating isn't higher.(Yes, I love Trixie but Dan is my fave. I make no apology for that.)Recommended 10+ for scary situations.
This is one of my absolute favorites in the series!
This book takes the Bob-Whites (minus Dan...of course) to Virginia, with a stop in Washington D.C. along the way, for a decades old mystery discovered in the Belden's Sleepyside attic.
Loved the connection to the Underground Railroad that sparked the mystery.
Loved the old house with its secret tunnel.2012 Review:Like Cobbett's Island before it, The Mystery of the Emeralds is a treasure hunt mystery, easily my favorite kind of mystery.
I like that the story starts so firmly in Sleepyside and that Crabapple Farm appears to have been a stop on the Underground Railroad.
I love the treasure hunt and especially the underground tunnel!
– Most of a day’s read.Characters?
– Memorable, several characters.Setting?
– 1965.Does the story leave questions in the readers mind?
Also, the absence of computers, cell phones, and air conditioning in homes, especially the mansion.Short storyline: Trixie Belden finds a link the Civil War past of her own home.
She, Honey, and her brothers work to find the living descendants of the people mentioned in the letter, and return a set of rare family jewels to their rightful owners.Notes for the reader: A great mystery!
For Christmas one year, my parents grabbed me the entire Trixie Belden set and I couldn't put them down.
After I finished with them, they continued to purchase them as quickly as I could read them.
Even with a learning disability, I devoured the books.
I look back now and I find that Trixie Belden was much more age related to young girls, particularly to me, reading the books than Nancy Drew.
There was something in these books that I found to be a greater escape than I did ND, too.
I found that they weren't so "over the top" or dated.
This and Cobbett's Island are definitely a step up, in terms of the writing, over the other Kathryn Kenny books so far. The writing is not as good as Julie Campbell's, mostly because it dips into "Nancy Drewisms" ("Trixie, you're so wonderful!" kind of stuff in particular), and the author has a slightly different view of the characters, but still a pleasure. The next one is supposedly by the lady who wrote #s7-12, alas.
My husband thinks I have too many books. While I don't think there is such a thing, I am trying to purge. I have been rereading my childhood books. I don't usually put them in here, but this book was my favorite Trixie Belden book so far, so I thought I'd put it in here as a reminder of these classic books. A bit old-fashioned at this point, but enjoyable.
I slowly amassed the whole series as first editions (it seemed so glamourous as a kid owning precious books that were older than me!) by saving all my pocket money to buy them from the local secondhand store.
They sat in a back corner of the store, thankfully ignored by everyone else, as I slowly acquired them through pocket money and then in a mass swoop for Christmas.
Trixie Belden is such a fun heroine!
What age would enjoy this book?
It is written to a YA audience, and I loved the books as a young teenager, but I also enjoyed this book as an adult, as a light summer read.
Like the Harry Potter books, Trixie Belden kept me on the edge of my seat (while sneaking in a fat SAT word every page or two), but unlike Harry Potter, the kids had better character (no rude name calling or unrepentant attitude problems).
So I am planning to read to my 6 year old daughter, too.
I've forgotten how much I loved reading mysteries when I was a kid. This was one of my favorites, along with all the Nancy Drews!
(With Laurel)
This is odd, of course, because they were MEANT for teen and pre-teen girls, but I was a young boy that read everything he could get his hands on and when I first stumbled on my first TRIXIE BELDON book I was instantly hooked!
Trixie is the star, or "lead" character, followed by Jim and Honey (who quickly became the love of my young life, I had a total crush on a fictional character that only existed in ink) and this brave trio was constantly getting into trouble, solving mysteries and murders; that sort of thing.
I lost all of my Trixie books years ago, lending them to friends and that sort of thing.
This is one of my favorites in the series ...
partly because I love old houses, partly because I have a soft spot for elderly people AND disabled people, partly because I am intrigued by secret passages in old houses ...
Although it's quite "coincidental" that Di's parents just happen to be going where the mystery leads, AND are willing to take them all ...
still, they don't get into any real serious trouble with hardened criminals, etc.
And all the nice people they meet and are willing to help ..
it's just a real feel good story.Sept 2013 ...
again one of my favorites.
Funny book!
How come I never understood before that Dan's presence in the series is solely to add socioeconomic diversity to the Bob-Whites?
(Trixie keeps getting pale and sick and desperate when the smallest roadblock comes up in the mystery that she's just GOT to solve.) Trixie keeps drooling over the paralyzed guy who is oh-so-handsome, and that's pretty funny.
Did someone on the editorial staff eventually have a sit-down and say "do you guys realize how long it's been since we had a book where the Bob-Whites stayed at home?
One of my favorite Trixie volumes.
Trixie and her mother are cleaning out the attic of their very old New York state farmhouse.
Trixie finds a hidden room and discovers her house was once part of the underground railroad.
She finds a letter mentioning some lost emeralds.
Unfortunately, the emerald appear to be lost in Virginia, and she is in New York.
Then there are hidden passages!
Clues hidden in family masoleums!
And a cake made in the shape of a giant hat covered in flowers!
The cake was one of my favorite parts of the book.
I love frosting flowers.)
It was a BIT of a history lesson, but not overly bad.
It was about 60% mystery this time and 40% lesson.
The endings always get to me and this one (well, the reveal which comes a little before the very end) was one of the good ones because Trixie did have heart.Oh, but one bad bad bad thing in the beginning.
It says Bob-Whites were formed by JIM.
It was all Trixie/Honey, though Jim did come up with the WHISTLE, but HE did not form it all on his own.
Definetly not my favorite Trixie Belden book.
Again, the entire treasure hunt type of mystery bores me.
But this one was better than the Cobbett's Island one, which was literally a map-in-a-bottle treasure hunt.
This is the book where Mart officially makes the transition to very cliche food-crazy brother who rarely thinks about his sister's feelings when teasing her.
Neil was really nice once you got to know him.
I felt bad for him when I learned his story and that he was genuinely nice.
But I think Mr. Lynch might have asked him to maybe get in contact with his parents?
I used to read these a lot when I was younger, so picked one up for nostalgic sake. Haha, so my review as an adult is that it's is very childish and very predictable! You can figure out what they are going to do next ages before it happens. However, the classic American English and usage is interesting and the interaction between the characters is just as good as I thought it was 15 yrs ago :).
While cleaning out the attic Trixie stumbles into a secret are where she finds a letter from civil war times. The letter indicated that a cursed emerald necklace has been hidden somewhere on the grounds of an old house in Virginia. Trixie is determined to search for the necklace, but how will she get there and where would they start to look?
The fourteenth book in the Trixie Belden series. This one reminded me a lot of one of the earlier books where they found the diamond. This one was half at home and half out of town, and really quite enjoyable.I thought there was a good little mystery with the story, and a good amount of drama and excitement. Interesting how they tied in some of the historical stuff to the story as well.
When Trixie finds a letter in a hidden part of the attic, she concludes that there are hidden emeralds near Williamsburg. Will the Bob-Whites get to go and find them? A great trip and a fun mystery filled with the series characters at their best.Read my full review at Carstairs Considers.
I remember in this book Trixie saying to stare at something for a short amount of time and then try to remember everything you saw. That intrigued me so I played that mind game. Also, there was a secret passage in the house! I still want a house of my own with at least one secret passage.
Although I loved all of the Trixie Belden Books, the mystery of the emeralds was truly the jewel in Kathryn Kenny's crown. This is also where i learned the word "dungaree." I wish i used it more often.
These are such fun books! They were written in the 60's and I read them all in the 70's. When my son had to read a mystery book for a school report, I picked a few of these up from the library. Loved them again!
Trixie Belden was one of my earliest great media obsessions. I absolutely adored all of the books and desperately wanted to be Trixie.
