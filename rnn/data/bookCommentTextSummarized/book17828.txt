There are some books you read that make you feel very inadequate as an author. This would be one of them.

"We lose control- quickly, so fast we've broken beyond floating to flying. I inhale and all I smell is Ryan: the sweet smell of summer rain. I'm so giddy I could almost laugh- I'm finally high. Higher than I've ever been without drugs, higher than I've ever been with other guys, higher than..."  Thoughts   BEFORE  book:Wow. What is going on here. It's BETH AND ISAIAH- NOT this Ryan guy whoever the hell HE is. I'm sorry I'm team Isaiah all the way. I mean c'mon he's such a good guy. He's took ca
If I forget about PTL completely and just think of this book as a separate one I could honestly say that Katie McGarry has once again written a fabulous and just as emotional novel full of twists unexpected surprises and secrets.
But when I got this book and like PTL was split into Echo and Noah's POV to show their love, DTY was split into Beth and Ryan's.
Like I as made to fall in love with Isaiah in PTL only for me to feel pained by his pain, I wanted to comfort him and tell him he deserved someone better than Beth.
There are times when you stand on the cusp of moments so huge, you know you’ll remember them forever.  It all started at a Taco Bell... It was just a dare... Ryan and his friends never back away from a dare. He and his friend Chris are getting girls numbers... and Chris dares Ryan to get Beth’s. He has no idea what he is in for. She turns him down, but she is still on his mind- We all remember Noah’s friend Beth from Pushing the Limits... Beth is a bad ass. The tough girl that no one messes wit
Ryan and his friends never back away from a dare.
She turns him down, but she is still on his mind- We all remember Noah’s friend Beth from Pushing the Limits...
The only people in her life she can truly count on are her best friends Isaiah and Noah.
Beth loves Isaiah, but only as a friend.
Isaiah and Noah want Beth to move in with them, but she can’t.
Ryan wants to be her friend.
As their relationship grows and changes, Beth is starting to realize how much Ryan means to her and its scary.
Ryan knows how much he cares for Beth.
I figured this could get interesting.But then...the story started reading like every bad teen movie I'd ever encountered.
I appreciate what the author is trying to do by exposing the readers to more than a basic 'boy meets girl' story, but I wasn't quite buying the authenticity of it all.
YET...this story wasn't so bad.
Before you get ready to eye-roll your way on out of here, let me give you this : he told the girl about the bet before the halfway point of the book!
This author has delivered a novel that i'm sure will capture the attention of most lovers of this genre.There are so many positives about this book I'm not sure how to write it all coherently in one review, but here are my thoughts ...As with most books I read with an Alternative point of view, I felt the bonus of having the opportunity to experience the story from both sides and believe me I loved both Ryan and Beth in equal measure.
Don't miss out on this story of Beth and Ryan and what happens when love doesn't make sense and dares to become reality.This is a gorgeously written story that I loved from beginning to end.
In Pushing The Limits, it really felt like the the characters and their relationships with each other, with the world, with their flawed perceptions were all part of an intricate dance in a wonderful universe where everything made sense.
Ultimately, I could imagine Beth deciding she didn’t love Isaiah.
Of course, it doesn’t help that Beth had to change a lot in ways that I felt were unnecessary.
I guess I just felt it was hard to watch Beth change to other people’s expectations when a lot of those were a result of needs that didn’t seem to be met.“I need to be there for my mother!
I was a little bit hesitant to start Dare You To because it was Beth's story and I never really liked her character in the book.
And well, you probably just guessed what happened!Like I mentioned above, Beth was never really a character that I enjoyed.
I must say that although I thought it was outrageous that Beth continued to help her mom out, at the same time, I appreciated her bravery and devotion to her.
Like Pushing the Limits, this book was told in dual POVs and I thought Katie McGarry handled it splendidly once again.
Well, they can but they also know their dreams won't come true and this was Beth's situation.
So can she or can't she change that and dare to dream of a new life?People like Beth build walls and never let them down but what happens when someone is attempting to let your walls down over and over and over again?
People who make me feel are worse.
Ryan is one of those guys who apparently has a perfect life.
Have you ever think about the meaning of perfection???
What will happen when perfect Ryan and imperfect Beth collide?
Well, Katie McGarry just wowed me again! Dare to You was just as  AMAZING  if not more that Pushing the Limits!! I was full of intense emotions, and on the edge of my seat the entire read, completely immersed in Beth and Ryan’s story!! I knew Beth’s story would be something else, because she was such a hard and troubled character in Pushing the Limits, and now we finally see why. Beth is living with her aunt after having the crap beat out of her by her mother’s boyfriend, Trent (what a gem!). He
I was full of intense emotions, and on the edge of my seat the entire read, completely immersed in Beth and Ryan’s story!!
I knew Beth’s story would be something else, because she was such a hard and troubled character in Pushing the Limits, and now we finally see why.
For so long he goes along with his parent’s expectations and desires, but is this what will make him happy?When a dare brings Beth and Ryan together their worlds collide.
The way he treated Beth is what finally made her walls come down and begin to trust.
Dare You To is a perfect example of a great YA story. I adored Beth and Ryan. She is rough around the edges but vulnerable, and he is a charming, virginal baseball player. Their love story is sweet, emotional and heartbreaking at times, and it all begins with a dare.I really enjoyed Beth and Ryan's story. Experiencing them falling in love while struggling to deal with some difficult personal issues, I was constantly pulling for them. This was a wonderful, young adult romance.
I received this ARC in exchange for an honest review  This book was very clearly NOT FOR ME. It was so NOT FOR ME that I refuse to even finish or review it. Here are my reading notes: Two perspectives, guy and girl, love that. Ew. Chris, Mr. MC's bestie? Has an “awesome” girlfriend yet is playing the “lemme get your number” game? Total skeeze move."All girls are the same...All girls want the same thing. A guy who shows interest." Really, Mr. MC who I’m supposed to like? Really? Hmmm, Beth’s ba
A guy who shows interest." Really, Mr. MC who I’m supposed to like?
Hey, Mr. MC who I’m supposed to like, FUCK YOU.
Yuck?She can’t move in with Isaiah and Noah because she needs to live two blocks from her mom to clean up her shit?
Beth's mom busts out the windows of her boyfriend’s car because he cheated.
Beth picks up the baseball bat to defend her mom and that’s when the cops show up.
And how much STOOPID???*Snap to Ryan*Mr. MC who I’m supposed to like is pitching in a baseball game.
Beth wonders how the cops know she doesn’t live with her mom.
*** EDIT 12/6/2012***Cover & Blurb: Beth is very pretty, and so much unlike what I had in mind.
is it okay if I like Ryan a little as in a whole damn lot?
Gee, that hunk!I'm certain it's gonna be a trilogy now, unless Isaiah finds his own HEA in Dare You To, which I sincerely doubt.
But then I noticed it's about Beth and...
Isaiah?!
So I was all like "Hell yeah!
Slightly intimidated, awed and irritated by Beth judging from the preview chapter I read.
WHY ISN'T IT 2013 ALREADY???P.S. Isaiah will have a book of his own, right?
OH WOW! What a gorgeous cover!! Can't wait for this!
I really don't know how to start...In Echo and Noah's story, we met Isaiah and Beth...
All her life she was trying to take care of her mother who was alcoholic and drug addict and she was having a boyfriend that loved to hit her and especially he was enjoying to hit Beth a lot!!!Her only shelter was Noah and Isaiah...
His perfect life wasn't so perfect after all, but he was trying to remain strong and to keep up with the plan...
But when everything changed in Beth's life and she had to move in with her uncle, Ryan was having one more chance of winning....
Dare You To  is the sequel to  Pushing The Limits  and follows the story of Beth (who we previously met) and Ryan.
Beth now has to combat a new aunt, a new school, and new classmates, specifically golden-baseball-star, Ryan Stone.
The characters took some time to accept whereas I felt an immediate likeness towards Echo (and Noah) in Pushing the Limits.
This book was enjoyable to read, don’t get me wrong, but I felt that it was too drawn out.
I have to say, I quite enjoyed the character development in this book.
But, but, but, but - Beth's not with Isaiah - but, but, but, but - Katie McGarry is a genius, I must trust - but, but, but, but - ALL THE FEELINGS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Screw what Mom and Dad think. Screw the rest of the town. Screw perfection. This girl is mine. ~Ryan REACTION AFTER READING THE BOOKTotally happy and a little bit teary-eyed.*clap. clap. clap*Oh and I have a playlist for this book:Ryan to Beth:  Kiss Me Slowly by ParachuteIsaiah to Beth:  What I know by ParachuteFor Beth: Broken Angel by Boyce AvenueBeth to Ryan: Who Knew by Pink or Terrified by Katharine McPheeThis book wasn't perfect. There were stuff here and there that made me want to throw
He'll say...Everyone thinks his life was perfect but what they didn't know was what was happening behind closed doors.
He felt dependent on them too as to what he thinks he wants to do with his life.
I know a lot of you would have and have loved Isaiah but I don't like him for Beth.
It's one of those stories that will stick to your brain and will remember and smile because it was good.I liked Beth and Ryan's love story but what I really liked the most was the way it shows how life is never as it seems.
Sept 25 2012*SCREAMSAnother book? Am i dreaming?  oh my, oh my  I'm in heaven! I'm so happy. Oh great lord~ This is why my life worth livin' for Just wait for my review. Coming soon~Noah<3 December 1, 2012 OH HOLY! The COVER, it is so..so..DEEP! OMG! Is that Beth? PERFECTION! And as for the guy hmmm.. Why does he remind me of someone from The Walking Dead?
As it stands I've been reading a string of similarly plotted books lately so my patience for certain elements of the book has been worn thin.Unlike with Pushing the Limits, I had a difficult time with the characters and romance in this sequel.
I liked the characters okay, and the chemistry is definitely not missing between them, but the back and forth, hot and cold romance they develop went on a little too long for me until I became utterly exhausted with it.
Beth being so cautious makes it extremely difficult for Ryan to get her to let him in.

From time to time I like to read love stories.I like to read stories that make me smile, stories about first love and hope and innocence. I like to read stories about opposite people, from very different backgrounds, that discover that there is something that can bind their worlds.From time to time I like to forget about work and day to day duties, and instead curl up in my bed with a cup of tea and a cute book that can make giggle and sigh and keep my fingers crossed for a happy ending..When I
They throw them in our faces until we forget that there is something else that we need: someone that cares, someone to treat us right, someone to tell us beautiful things, someone to make us laugh, someone to really "get" us, to understand us like no one else, someone to make our hearts flutter with just a smile or a soft touch.Maybe this is another reason I loved this book so much, because it proves that a 'good' guy can be such a cutie.
4.5 STARS TO A HEART-POUNDING READ!!!Dare You To is a companion novel to Pushing The Limits, which i really enjoyed. I think this was a tiny bit better and i loved it. At times i couldn't put it down!  Isaiah is my safe. He has always been. He's that place where i fall when the world turns into chaos.  Isaiah is Beth's Risk only true friend that she trusts with her life. He know her secrets. He knows her mother is an addict and alcoholic living with an abusive asshole of a boyfriend, and that Be
Isaiah is Beth's Risk only true friend that she trusts with her life.
When he get's dared to get Beth's phone number and then go out with her on a date in public, he knows one thing - he doesn't like loosing and he will not fail.
But Ryan get's to know Beth better, and he sees that she's more than dark hair and bad attitude.
As i said before, i think this is better from Pushing The Limits, mainly because the ending didn't confuse the heck out of me and i felt a deeper connection to the characters.

4 STARS I wasn't the biggest fan of Noah and Echo's book, mostly because I felt it was bogged down by the heaviness of the theme without succeeding at making me actually care for the characters (especially Echo) enough to sympathize. I didn't even care much for Beth and was certainly not raring to know her story. She came across as a whiny, pessimistic, emo, wannabe.So this was a pleasant curve ball for me.This is a girl book. You know, the kind that your boyfriend will never admit to his frien
Because that's exactly what I did in the closeted silence of my heart (I'm a closet squee-er).The key to enjoying this book is to reading it like you're watching a John Hughes movie: don't resist the charm.
Whenever I come back to reading this after setting it aside for a while, it wasn't hard to be immersed again and pick up where I left off my sympathy for the characters.While it is a teeny-bop love story, I was glad to see it deal at depth with Ryan and Beth's issues outside of each other.

Katie McGarry sure has teenage angst down pat!I really liked this book despite a few issues that I had with it.
You know we were dying for Beth and Isaiah to have their happy ending!
I spent a good amount of time mourning my preconceived notion that this book would be about Beth and Isaiah.
if this whole book was going to be about a dare followed by Beth finding out about the dare and getting pissed at the end...
I actually would have preferred if Katie McGarry went all out and made Beth really experienced.
I hope Isaiah gets his own book next- he deserves it.
RATING: 4.5 HEARTS!!! <3<3I fell in love with Katie McGarry's writing with Pushing the Limits, and now with Dare You To, I am ecstatic to say that Katie continues to wow me with her beautiful storytelling and gut wrenching emotions, and such realistic characters. I loved Beth and Ryan! :DFull Review to Come....
“That must be love: when everything else in the world could implode and you wouldn't care as long as you had that one person standing beside you.” Dare You To is a publication I had high prospects for. I unquestioningly FALL FOR Pushing the Limits, and now I can candidly declare that Dare You To did not disappoint.♫♥♫♥♫♥♫♥♫♥♫♥♫♥♫♥♫♥♫♥♫♥♫♥♫♥♫♥♫♥♫♥♫♥♫♥♫♥♫♥♫♥“I won't let you go."

We succinctly contacted Beth in Pushing the Limits since Echo started going out with Noah.At her novel educational institution, she meets old associates...that where she met town's golden boy.....
, We`ve been acquainted with Isaiah in the earlier journal, and is a total horrid male offspring but the best acquaintance of Beth` who she ran to every time she's about to mislay her ground.Second love onvolvement is Ryan, the baseball jock at Beth’s new school.
The spark of erotic love Ryan and Beth has is hard to etell in just few lines.
And can she really re-start her life over - one where she leaves everyone she loves behind or will she die trying to protect her mother?I haven't had this feeling for ages, you know the one, where you feel compelled to stay up late into the night to finish a book and when you do finish, you can't form a coherent sentence.
But hey, I can not wait!All in all, Katie McGarry's Dare You To oozes with sexual tension, swoon worthy quotes and a love story that leaves a mark on your heart.
