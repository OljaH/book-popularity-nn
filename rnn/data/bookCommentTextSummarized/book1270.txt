There are essays here on pretty much anything that struck Huxley's interest - which is, in itself, inspiring and admirable - but the unspoken theme running through much of the book is an effort to reconcile humanism with the colder truths of the 20th century (i.e. the long view of history, the long view of the cosmos, the long view of homo sapiens, and the capacity for technology to tamper with all of them)...
An interesting intellectual self-portrait of a mind striving to see above and beyond the mid-20th century, but that's all.
Pure genius
It was very clear when Huxley was on LSD when writing these.
It's useful to look into the mind of the man who wrote Brave New World.
The excerpts from "Tomorrow, Tomorrow and Tomorrow" are really good.
