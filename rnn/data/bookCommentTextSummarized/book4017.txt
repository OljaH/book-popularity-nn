The best translation I've found of the Tao te Ching.
"IT'S GOOD TO BE HEADLESS" (From Luyichi, Ninth Century) In the time of Han Wuti (B.C. 140-87), Chia Yung of Ts'angwu was serving as magistrate of Yuchang.
Yung mounted his horse and returned to the camp.
The soldiers and people of the camp all came to look at him, and Yung spoke from his chest, "I was defeated by the bandits and they cut off my head.
Tell me, in your opinion, does it look better to have a head or be without a head?" The officers wept and said, "It's better to have a head." And Yung replied, "I don't think so.
It's just as good to be without a head."
Read it last week, while I was in Nanjing amongst the Chinese. It was brilliant. Modern China is so far from its great tradition, however there are still many psychological and social threads which can be related to history of their tradition. A must read for any one who wants to have a peep into breadth of Chinese poetry, prose, spiritualism and life.
This very old book was on my parent's shelves, and I ignored it for years. Then picked it up when I became interested in eastern religions. It is fascinating! Descriptions and excerpts from the east's major religions.
I feel I can hear the voice from the Hymna
Was interested in reading since I saw it in my father's hand in 1970. Finally read in 80's. All Hindu religious books nicely translated.
