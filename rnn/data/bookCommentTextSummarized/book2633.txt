Not my favorite Agatha Christie novella.
This is short story featuring Agatha Christie's characters, Tommy and Tuppence.
This story was very short--took less than an hour to read.Tommy works undercover in a detective agency with Tuppence as his secretary.
One morning a girl walk in to seek their help locating a pink pearl that is missing from a pendant.
Tommy and Tuppence arrive at the house and start interviewing guest, family members and servants.
Tommy is determined to check the rooms in the house and locate the pearl.
I will read more of Tommy ànd Tuppence stories but I hope they are more entertaining than this one and not as rushed.
"The Affair of the Pink Pearl" reminded me of several other Agatha Christie mysteries - she did have a habit of using some recurring themes, including kleptomaniacs and jewel thieves. The audiobook kept my attention but the story was rather predictable, especially as I've read other Christie books with similar plots. Some of the characters were intriguing, although Tommy and Tuppence never seem to be on the same page.
They receive a case from an upper crust family and off they go....I was pleased to see I figured out part of the answer, but another part escaped me, so it was in effect, a brand new was of solving a crime for me, and a good story, to boot.
It was still rather basic in description of character, or scene, but I believe Ms. Christie was still getting her "land legs," with mysteries during this time.
Later on she developed tremendous skill in setting stages, developing characters and weaving plots.
Still, this is a nice little period gem, especially for those who like to read one of the masters of crime fiction.
another lovely and a might be called (a short story ) tommy and tuppence in a new adventure and it as simple as it may seem but there is that little idea that makes you think.. i liked it and enjoyed it ..
The whole scheme was obvious yet the sweet nice humor of the couple make-up for the rest.
Listened during a commute traffic situation and my daughter fell asleep to the narration and I needed to give it another listen when I wasn’t so focused on driving. The gentle banter of Tommy and Tuppence is entertaining (I have read one other with them as the sleiths) and enjoyed that as well. Not the best of Agatha Christie, but a nice way to spend part of an hour.

Love Tommy and Tuppence, but this isn't my fav of their short stories.
I think I overrated this story. It’s quick. And that’s okay. I bet if I knew less of the genre and Christie it would be delightful.
Short story - but filled with good stuff. Just like a pearl.
Super fast read. Light and refreshing.
A pink pearl has gone missing and Tommy and Tuppence are on the case! Clever and quick, I didn't have any idea who'd done what until Tommy ran in with the policeman and unfolded the plot.
I really do love these two, especially for how Christie uses them to poke fun at detective novels, her own included. I think that really speaks to her humility, sense of humor, and broad view of life. I will freely admit that I got it all wrong. I reeled in that red herring right from the start. It was such a twist when the truth of it all came out. Bravo!
Actual Rating: ***1/2After discovering the wealth of Agatha Christie eBooks available for download from the Boston Public Library, I have a long list lined up. I need to read more background about her writing and characters, but this title sort of called out to me, "start here." Loved the story, but felt I had been dropped into the middle of something bigger.
Good little short read, perfect for a road trip
Tommy and Tuppense story
Meh.
Half hour short story that filled the time well.
