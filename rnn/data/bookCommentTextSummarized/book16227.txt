Of course lots of police work goes on before that to discover who dunnit and all our favourite characters are there including McNab, Feeney, Morris and even Trueheart who gets some important scenes of his own this time.And then of course there is all the stuff we read these books for - the constant laugh out loud banter, the romance, the little things we know and love like the candy thief and Galahad, and of course the major moments between Eve and Roarke.
Book ten in this series and I feel I'm well and truly settled into it to the point where the characters have become old friends.
Roarke and Eve are still feeling their way in their lives together producing a few sparks and a lot of passion and romance.
There is a lot of humour in their relationship and both are learning to give and take from each other.
Fun to see Roarke giving out dating tips to McNab during their not quite legal incursions into police and locked files.
Always an enjoyable light read with great characters and fun plots.
In the midst of it, Eve stood in an alarm-red dress that left her arms and shoulders bare as it skimmed down her long, slim body like an avid lover’s hungry hands.
Eve needed to give something back to Roarke because she felt he always said the right things, showed her how much he loved her and for her these things didn’t come as easily.
You’re all there is.”  “I love your body,” she murmured, slowly working open the buttons of his shirt.
Eve. I need you.” “I know.” Tenderness washed into her, balm over a burn.
I cannot give these books less than 4 stars.

I could do with a bit more Roarke and Eve time....When a celebrity is killed right before her eyes, New York detective Eve Dallas takes a new place in crime—as both officer and witness to murder...
Eve is thawing a bit in her relationship with Roarke.
She is beginning to accept that she is all that he needs and wants.Roarke is just perfect.
You know me, I love an alpha asshole.
Roarke is alpha alright but he is no asshole.
Whether the past was his or Eve's, it solved nothing.

Suspense 5+ stars / Romance 4.5 starsI freaking loved this book.Excellent story, like an “old-fashioned” classically written detective novel by Agatha Christie.
Murder out of love, hate, revenge – the whole kaleidoscope of feelings and emotions.
As a huge fan of Agatha Christie, who read all her books approx.
20 times (but who counts *lol*), I know to enjoy a good suspense with a deep and creative background.Big plus *excuse my heartlessness* - the 1st victim deserved to be murdered – the world didn’t lose, but gained.
Romance.
Well, with small steps, but I have further 36 instalments *lol*, so… who knows… *wink*
"Peabody, am I an ass-kicker?""Are you asking to see my scars or is that a trick question?""Shut up, Peabody." Okay, I admit it, Eve's grouchy, rude personality is growing on me. She kind of cracks me up. "Great sweater, by the way. Is it cashmere?"Baffled, Eve looked down at her navy turtleneck. "I don't know. It's blue." Yeah, I can relate to not giving a damn about shopping. She's lucky to have a husband who buys her nice things that she can't appreciate.So, in this book we have a murder tha
Also, they are all actors, so the characters are all narcissistic liars which only complicates things.But, more importantly than that, Eve has to figure out who is stealing her candy stash from her desk.
She's great at closing her murder cases, but this candy thief is too elusive for her.
There is no way I ate all of those Reeses myself.Along with all of the laughs (there is a great scene where Eve wants to kill her old computer in a painful way), I love how all of the characters are relating to each other at this point.
Mix some J. D. Robb with some Agatha Christie and you get genius! In the way of Christie, the murderer is obvious but hard to see.Reread July 2018 — “The plays the thing.” In this case the thing is murder. Eve and Roarke have a night out at the theater. Its an Agatha Christie mystery that quickly becomes too real. Great book!
Nadine Furst, the channel 75 news reporter, becomes more of a central character in this book due to her relationship with the deceased.
Just a great book.The lead actor, Richard Draco, is murdered opening night and Eve is an eyewitness.
The play "Witness for the Prosecution" is the first for Roarke's new theater.
Eve soon zeros in on the cast and crew, especially after a second body is found hanging in the theater.Draco gives the word "sleaze" a bad connotation and this case hits to close to home for Eve when the deceased makes it really hard for her to "stand for the dead."
Review to come!

More Roarke and Eve re-read awesomeness! The seduction scene...omg!...no need to say more(; And then the ending: "You can't go back. Can't fix what broke. But you can go forward. And every step matters. Every one makes a difference." She cupped his face in her hands. "From where I'm standing, you're the best step I ever took." Sweeeeet!Re-read in preparation for Echoes...Feb 2017:)
Still love Roarke.Re-readJuly 5-8,2017What can I say. I love me some Roadie time.
4 1/2 to 5 stars
The fabulous Marlene Dietrich in Agatha Christie’s wonderful “Witness for the Prosecution,” the play Roarke and Eve go to see.
(This is a review of the audiobook.) Susan Ericksen narrates these characters as if she wrote them instead of J.D. Robb, she knows them that well.
Her narration lets us know them better, too!Loved this one.
I think it is one of the best in the series.
The homage to Agatha Christie was spot-on; especially Roarke’s thinking how much Dame Christie would love Lieutenant Eve Dallas.
We get to see deeper into these characters.
I've said this in my other reviews with the previous books and I am afraid I have to say it again here.
Sometimes I think Eve is too much or her methods are a bit much.
She comes out hard, cold, detached and emotionless but readers of this series knows better.
Her relationship with Roarke makes her more human.
I couldn't for the life of me guess who done it.
I guessed a few but turned out wrong.
😆And we have an adorable scene with Eve and Roarke.
She planned her first intimate dinner.
How hard can it be to prepare dinner.
Many times I tried to place this edition, the one I actually OWN, as my edition of this book.I even took time to write a review for this book, the one I actually read, but Goodread's kept switching me over to the other one, which was a lie. GR says I shelved the other edition, and I did, once. Every time I switched GR moved back to other.I won't repeat my review again, after this mess. Just know if you're a fan, you'll enjoy.
4.5 starsEve & Roarke are such a wonderful couple and even though this is their tenth book, their relationship is still growing and changing. Eve really stretched herself in proving her love for Roarke. It was very sweet & endearing. Two words I never thought I'd associate with Eve. I loved it. On the flipside, Roake had an "insert foot in mouth" moment, which made this entire book worth the read. The man does have faults!   Praise Jesus!  Oh Peabody. The real star of the show.  Thank he
4.5 starsEve & Roarke are such a wonderful couple and even though this is their tenth book, their relationship is still growing and changing.
Eve really stretched herself in proving her love for Roarke.
Two words I never thought I'd associate with Eve. I loved it.
It was quite enjoyable seeing him get all gooey-eyed over Peabody & asking for love advice.
She's smart and kickass, but still manages to be thoughtful and sweet.
Plus, she puts up with all of Eve's crap.
Gotta love a strong secondary character.
So yeah, I loved it.
4,5 Stars. I really liked it but it was a little predictable for me. I just loved the last scene with Eve and the murderer. Eve has such a big heart!
Seeming to think that both homicides are linked, Eve uses that smart brain of hers and plays a game of who-did-it?Witness in Death gripped me from the very first page and I devoured this book!
Again, Robb never fails to make me fall in love again and again with Roarke and Eve. It seems that in this book, Roarke had more of a presence.
It makes for a perfect balance between all that death and more sensitive subjects that Witness in Death covers.All in all, this book goes down as one of my favourites.
Another great addition to the series. Didn't feel as intrigued as I did the others but I was entertained by the theatrical bit.
Witness in Death4 StarsIn her newest case, homicide lieutenant Eve Dallas finds herself in uncharted territory when she, along with the entire audience, witnesses the murder of an actor during a performance.
Reading this book brought back fond memories of watching the film with my father.
It must be said that this is definitely the first time in the series that the murder is 100% justified as the victim is a vile excuse for a human being.
In terms of the character development, readers are provided with additional insights into Eve's personality as the case demonstrates that she is still struggling with the horrific memories that have only recently risen to the surface.
Every time I read this book, I like it more if that's possible. The whole world is a stage - basically sums up this book. Lies, deceit, and more lies - gotta love thespians!Love the scene with Eve preparing for a seductive evening with Roarke - too funny, poor girl!Still wondering about that cone-shaped thing that tinkles - have no idea how that works ;)5 stars and 2 thumbs up!
Is there anything trickier than interviewing actors, than trying to find the truth in those whose profession is to embody a lie? This is a hard boiled tribute piece to Agatha Christy and an emotionally trying case for Eve Dallas.Never fear, you can count on Lieutenant Dallas not only to find the guilty but also, more importantly, justice.
I loved all the different Dynamics in this one. It's fun to get to know the side characters better. Eve and Peabody had some really funny banter. And I liked the case. It was an interesting one for Eve.
But at the end of the day, we'll never stop loving them.
Especially McNab. If you don't worship McNab, you don't deserve to have the privilege to read this series.However, what changes from book to book is the plot.
But what I loved was the fact that I didn't trust anyone.
Which, let's be honest, more often than not let us know who the killer is pretty early on.Another plus was both Charles as an individual as with Peabody.
Especially since Charles is still waiting for his bae.All in all, one of my favorites.
Witness in Death by J.D.Robb is the 10th book in the In Death series. Lieutenant Eve Dallas is accompanying her husband to the opening of a production of Agatha Christies Witness for the Prosecution when the actor playing Leonard Vole is murdered on stage for real. This is probably my most favourite of the series mainly due to the Agatha Christie references and parallels. Plenty of action, lots of twists and hot sizzling romance culminating in a dramatic revelation. Another amazing book.
Agatha Christie and Eve and Roarke all in one book.
Eve has to head down dark paths that remind her of her past, but Roarke is there beside her.
Eve butting into Peabody's personal life and getting her nose flicked.
This was definitely one that challenged Eve's moral compass.And again, we have another abso-fab entry in the series and I now need to go dive into Christie's Witness for the Prosecution and hope my turn on the library wait list for the next book comes soon.
