I absolutely love the Stephanie Plum series. It is a brainless, fun read that literally makes me laugh out loud. Pretty much every book has the same story line, but the characters are hysterical. Luna and Grandma Mazur are my favorites! I wouldn't mind "meeting" Morelli and Ranger and when I have read a lot of heavy books, these are great "quick reads" to lighten my spirits and enjoy.
I have friends who have read only one Stephanie Plum book, hated it and wouldn't consider picking up another. I don't understand this; I mean seriously, nothing was funny? I love these books, I laugh until I hurt, and then I laugh some more. Read a chapter, if it’s not funny, so be it. Not for everybody I guess. But please read a chapter…you may thank me.
big fan. read all the books aa they came out..even read some twice...hope there is more to come
I think Evanovich is one of the funniest writers ever and I've read just about everything she's written. I've even had to watch where I'm reading her books because I tend to laugh out loud in some parts and then people start to look at me rather strangely.
I read every one of these as soon as they come out. A few were a bit predictable, but still entertaining. Light beach reads - fun.
Fun books!!! You cant read these and not laugh or smile. They are very enjoyable stories and fun reads. Silly plots, interesting characters, and hot guys, I don't need much more :-)
I LOVE the Stephanie Plum series!
I thoroughly enjoy the Stephanie Plum series. Books 10 and beyond started getting a little monotonous for me (my personal opinion) but otherwise I find Janet Evanovich's books to be very light and entertaining reads.

have read these two books 3 or 4 times. read pre-e-book times and wore out 2 paperback copies has several funny scenes....if you read books 1 and 2 you will love 3 and 4. One for the money and Two for the Dough just introduces you to the wild cast of characters in these two books. only change is skip trace Stephanie is after and the wild accidents Stephanie and sidekick Lulu find themselves in. Side splitting roll on floor laughs in the books
