In Blues for a black cat, Boris Vian's literary genius shines with rare intensity impossible to find in modern works.
Without getting into any plot or revealing too much about this compilation of short stories, Blues for a black cat, is an insane, entertaining, humorous, profound, powerful avant-garde literary rarity.
Humanity, with its faults, seems to be a common thread throughout Vian's works (at least those I had the chance to read).
While not pure surrealism, his approach to reality, to make the most mundane breathe with a new life, is fascinating.Julia Older's excellent translation finally brings this important piece to the English speaking audiences.Blues for a black cat would be a great sample of Vian's work for those not familiar with this author.
I do like Boris Vian. I just read the line, It was raining octopi. But I don't know whether that means it's raining heavy or literally octopi are falling out of the sky. But does it really matter. His is a world where metaphors come true. (That's why he died at the cinema.)
Understand, the stories are in no way connected, there's no world-building going on here, instead it seems as if The Major jumped over the page break following "Blue Fairy Tale", to invade the ending of "The Fog" and throw the lead from a bridge (for those who need a solid, internal reason, the shell-shocked man is crazy as a loon and is believed to have committed suicide).
In Boris Vian's collection of short stories, the surrealism comes abruptly, without warning: in the middle of a normal set of events, strange things begin to happen, not strange in the sense of ghost stories, but in an unpredictable manner, orchestrated by the author's abundant imagination. I played along and followed the winding paths of dreamlike happenings, enjoying most of the stories. In a smaller or larger degree, they were all filled with violence, but Vian's black humour makes it way more bearable. My favorite stories? Journey to Khonostrov, Good Students, The Plumber and Blues for a Black Cat.
no... never again... I shall leave surrealism to the ones who feel it, it did nothing for me besides torture my little soul. Such a tiny book, such great torment.
Ce recueil illustre tout à fait sa capacité à faire de la langue sa matière personnelle.Le thème de la mort est abordé dans les trois dernières nouvelles (L’Écrevisse, Le Rappel et Les Chiens, le désir et la mort) de façon non conventionnelle, originale voire loufoque.
Parfois cruel, parfois d’une fraîcheur singulière, Vian oscille entre les sensations au fil de chaque nouvelle.Ce recueil (éd.
Le Livre de Poche, Libretti) inclut les nouvelles suivantes : * Blues pour un chat noir * Martin m’a téléphoné… (1945) * L’Écrevisse * Le Rappel (1948) * Les Chiens, le désir et la mort (1947)
There was a time I would have been much more interested in these stories.
The author of the introduction labels them of the surreal school and also throws references to Alfred Jarry in.
I found very few pieces of literature in translation that were tied to the various schools (a few plays, a few poems, references to novels and writers I could not locate).
There is also reference to the writers in the College of Pataphysique and Absurdism.
The stories are fun.
They do read like the enthusiastic writing of an immature twenty year old.
It that sense I liked Pins and Needles and Blue Fairy Tale.
Zamanında üniversite kütüphanesinde ancak ingilizcesini bulmuş ve okuyup çok beğenmiştim. Dün bir kitapevinde rastlayınca hemen diğer vian kitaplarımın arasına eklemek için aldım, zaten ilk baskıymış. Kendi dilimde okuyunca ÖLÜ BALIKLAR'ın en en en etkileyici Vian hikayesi olduğunu düşündüm, hepsi çok güzel ama ölü balıklar şahanee.
The one Boris Vian title I didn't publish and wished I did! Vian was a great short story writer - all of them absurd yet touching. He has that master's touch in combining a lot of elements and making a great dish or some sort of magic.
crazy
Not my cup of tea
Sarcasm în simbolism ce distorsionează realul pentru a forma o idee centrală ce se finalizează sub impresia că tot ceea ce s-a citit a fost o simplă iluzie.
Dacă ai răbdare pentru ele.Atunci luă un cuțit mare și își tăie capul.
Poate că este timpul să vă fac portretul lui Jasmin; dar în întuneric- fiindcă ferestrele nu se deschid niciodată, de vreme ce Jasmin nu există și, prin urmare, nu poate avea mamă, ceea ce este incontestabil, după cum vă va dovedi urmarea acestei povești- în întuneric, deci, descrierea nu ar fi exactă.Fragmente de genul acest sunt mai rarefiate, dar în mare parte texte în stilul ăsta compun întregul mănunchi de nuvele.
Boris Vian este acel tip de autor care transformă o simplă istorisire într-un altceva, dar un altceva de un stil întunecat.
Când spui Boris Vian gândul trebuie să te ducă automat la familia Addams.
Scurtele nuvele, unsprezece la numar, ce completează volumul Blues pentru o pisică neagră sunt scrise sub penelul unui umor negru, uşor macabru chiar; e ca şi cum i-ai avea pe George Bacovia şi Edgar Allan Poe într-un “duet”.Boris Vian creionează o lume cu susu-n jos, cu o doză de ironie dusă la extrem.
I’m counting it as completely read because I suffered through it for over three months despite finding it almost unreadable.
As with any book, I’m sure there is an audience out there.
The least “out there” story in the book may be the titular “Blues for a Black Cat” - in which a talking cat drinks himself to death in a bar.Why, you may ask, would I stick with a book for so long when I wasn't enjoying it?
But this book was short, it was a souvenir from Paris, and it has a black cat on it.
2.5. Definitely feel like "early" stories, surreal flairs and pleasingly unique turns of phrase minus the feeling and substance that I got from the other two books of his I read. "Dead Fish" was the closest to leaving a mark, and yet it's so toxically dreary I can't say I liked it.
This is so wonderfully weird, absolutely loved it! A bit hard to read in a second language though.
4/5
One star because I love Boris Vian... but I hate this book. really🙇
Nu chiar pe placul meu. O carte greu de inteles, in afara de povestea principala "Blues pentru o pisică neagră", celelalte povestiri nu prea au fost pe intelesul meu.
Refreshingly weird
Forse molti lo conoscono perché ha scritto (fra gli altri) la canzone "Le déserteur", che poi è stata rifatta e rivista in versione italiana da Tenco (per chi ne vuole sapere di più sulla versione di Tenco: http://auro.bookcrossing.com/journal/...
Dieu n'a d'intérêt que pour les pasteurs et pour les gens qui ont peur de mourir, pas pour ceux qui ont peur de vivre, pas pour ceux qui ont peur d'autres hommes en coustume foncé, qui viennent frapper à votre porte et vous faire croire que c'est la negresse ou vous empêchent de terminer una boutelle de Paul Jones entamée.
Die ne sert à rien quand c'est des hommes que l'on a peur.

A collection of surrealist short fiction, well-written and just as eccentric and riotous as jazz, the music of choice of its erstwhile author, once was.
And it was fine, since they were rooted in the collective consciousness of a community, but their twentieth-century progeny became self-serving and pointless, not to mention nihilistic, using black comedy as and end in itself - patches of genuine joy here and there could have illuminated the tales, but sadly, it didn't happen.
I simply couldn't connect to any of them, save for a borderline obsessive urge for burning through the bunch, wondering what madcap invention will be thrown at me in the next paragraph, which is, for me, the sole redeeming feature of Vian's fiction.
The style of this collection of short novels is not entirely on my liking. I liked something about this book but I cannot put my finger on it and name it right now.My copy of this book is in romanian.

Dark humour and absurd fiction make for a nice read, but some of the short stories feel too short.
începută prin vara...neterminată(dar vreau să ajung la finalul paginilor curând )
Interesting - but a little too dark for me these days.
8,5/10
Joyously bonkers, platinum-cast claptrap.
It wasn't a good time for this book for me, it annoyed me, although I admit it's a pretty good brain-twister.
