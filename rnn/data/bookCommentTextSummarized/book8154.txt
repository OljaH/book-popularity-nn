This was a rare book left behind by the overweight and greasy lead singer of a band I booked once when I used to do that.
I read it immediately and furiously like a masturbating teenager adopting Bruce's jargon as my own and made many decisions based on what I thought Lenny Bruce would do.
When those decisions went up in flames I thought to myself; "well, fuck, it could be worse, I coulda been Lenny Bruce".
Reading this book at times made feel overwhelmingly dirty, disgusted and guilty (like porn and Bukowski) and I can't wait to read it again.
Someone dies and the comet appears a little quicker ("X lived in the shadow of Y who had paved the way for X to do their most famous bits ...").Lenny Bruce's comet comes every 5 or ten years, it seems.
Just a couple of weeks ago, another website was looking at Comedians who had forced society to move forward and started their discussion with Bruce and Mort Sahl (a contemporary whose humor was a bit more political).
This book is what needs to be discussed every time Lenny's comet rolls on through the comedy ether.
This book is about why Lenny Bruce was important in the 1950's and 1960's and why we should still care about him now.
I love Lenny Bruce and I respect what he was able to accomplish, regarding free speech and the position of the satirist in the modern world.
one.- who has come after is in some sense trailing in his wake.I got really into reading this in high school.
I relished noticing that other people got into it, too, and saw what happened when the American legal structure decided to try and take him down.
A landmark case for defenders of free speech and dissent.Only trouble is: a lot of his work, this book included, seems too dated to stand up to today's reader.
Page for page, line for line, semi-colon for semi-colon, the funniest book I've ever read.
For anyone who believes this, or who believes that this “Politically Correct Society” is the reason our future as a nation looks more Orwellian with each passing day, I invite you to read How to Talk Dirty and Influence People.Lenny Bruce was a comedian and entertainer, perhaps the most notorious of his day, whose acts were hilarious, but were also constantly under attack thanks to Obscenity Laws.
You have no right to free speech if the words you speak are deemed OFFENSIVE.Of course Bruce probably could’ve gotten away with saying certain four-letter words.
In this politically correct version of the world Lenny Bruce is just as offensive as he was back when he was being busted by the fuzz for being obscene.
This isn't the first time I read this book I read it back when I was eighteen and I hadn't really seen Lenny perform, and I didn't really know all that much about him.
I fell in love with the book and read it about ten, or eleven times.
This was at the time, the definitive book on Bruce and still is.
This book starts off well but toward the end slips into a mess of legal rhetoric that became dull so I'm giving it a 3 star rating. But there are valuable lessons to be derived here; such as what it is to be a jew vs. a gentile, the power of words both written and spoken under those people in power who are in charge of censorship, how sticking your neck out in society does not always go over well, and why it is important to remain stoic and objective in a climate of religion vs. politics.
An entertaining book for anyone already kindly disposed towards Lenny though the only moment that it really teeters into (his usual) greatness is when he, disguised as a priest in order to collect money for a fake charity (fun guy), passes a Rabbi, who nods at him and he is forced to wonder whether they are always doing this, like bus drivers.
However, some of the material is dated, but valuable historically to show how times change.
He provides court records that show him caught in a kind of theatre of the absurd over what one could or couldn't legally say.
The memoir portion of the book is rich with stories of his time in the Merchant Marine and his love with Honey Harlowe.
(This reminded me of Elmore Leonard's novel, "Pagan Babies", which was about the exact same kind of scheme.) Though at times dated, he was also prescient, declaring marijuana would some day be legal.
Il resistibile successo di Lenny fra gli anni 50 e 60 si bas� sullo scandalizzare a oltranza.
Se poi teniamo conto dell'America profonda tutta torte di mele, Doris Day e zii che violentano nipotine nel capanno degli attrezzi possiamo comprendere come un tipo come Lenny Bruce - un classico, one-liner da battaglia, facesse sbellicare dalla risa gli hip urbani.
Stupisce che il medesimo errore l'abbia commesso trent'anni dopo un uomo che spesso appare acuto e intelligente come Luttazzi.
Lenny Bruce is a cultural icon, and like most cultural icons, I knew nothing about him before picking up this book.
The books meanders through stories about his life and larger cultural issues, which makes it an interesting read.
Lenny shows how the moral compass of society doesn't really get any stronger or weaker, it just changes course.
He points out that his parent's generation had "freak shows" at the circus, yet they consider his humor, to be offensive.
This makes it a good nighttime or airplane read, where you can let your subconscious process most of it.
I consider myself well read and in touch with comedy and the entertainment world past and present, yet I had no clue who LB was.
When I asked my mother if she knew who he was she said matter of fact, "He was a comedian/entertainer in the 50's and 60's and was a druggy." Ok...sounds like a fun read...NOT.
But, I did appreciate how Lenny broke the June and Ward pristine barriers of the 50's and spoke his truth about the hypocrisies of the world with potty mouth flare.
He ultimately paved the way for George Carlin, Eddie Murphy, Chris Rock and the like and I dig that!
Reading this book is just like watching a history of Lenny Bruce's standup act. It's funny and interesting in the beginning and then becomes bogged down in boring legal issues towards the end. Was he victimised by people in power? Sure, I can see that. But I don't need to read a verbatim account of the many trials. That stuff just doesn't interest me. My opinion - read the first half of the book and then give it to a Lenny Bruce fan.
This new edition of Lenny Bruce's autobiography still bites, shocks, and provokes some nervous laughter and some belly laughs. I hadn't read it before, although I was a fan and saw one of his live performances many years ago. Much of the hypocrisy he pokes fun at is still around, and many of his lines are still hilarious. He changed comedy forever, and paid a high price for doing so.
This book strongly influenced me. Lenny Bruce is an American icon who died for free speech. Read his own (hysterically funny) words and know his story in this age of political correctness. "When you take away the right to say "fuck," you take away the right to say "fuck the government."
2018 review:I abandoned this because I read it already when I was going through my Lenny Bruce phase. I'm sure I enjoyed it then, so why repeat my reading? My reading list this year is way too long for repeats I'm not sure I want to repeat.
Kinda meh. Celebrities writing books is kind of hit or miss, I think.
Not as funny as I would have liked. Dry read, despite the fact that Lenny Bruce lead a fascinating life.
good book!
Then, in an apparent attempt to pad this out to book length--and just barely at that--the narrative pace slows down to a crawl as Bruce describes the granular details of his legal battles over profanity and narcotics, complete with court transcripts.
This is far more interesting to the narrator than it is to me, especially since much of the material is similar--sometimes almost word for word--to Bruce's monologues during the sad, later period of his career when he was so obsessed with his legal battles that he couldn't talk about anything else on stage either.
It's sad to think that the lessons Lenny Bruce taught have been forgotten so quickly.
It's fear-I think-who knows who's next?
Gotta keep the finger away from you, no matter how many people you have to throw under the bus.
Friends yesterday, monster's today.
Something that was funny yesterday, ain't so funny today.
You gotta be fast to keep up, light on your toes, but even then, the Internet never forgets.
We do the thinking, not the dumb words.
It is not aware; it is a dumb toilet; it cannot be obscene; it’s impossible.
This is a dirty toilet here." - Lenny Bruce

i respect the hell out of lenny bruce, and parts of this book made me laugh out loud, but others were rambling and confusing and probably required you to have lived through the 1950s to catch all the references.
Admittedly read this one due to my newfound fascination with Lenny Bruce thanks to "The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel." This was a funny, sometimes jaw-dropping read. And OK, maybe left me a little less inclined to 'ship Midge and Lenny.
A great read until chapter 20. Too much quoting from the obscenity trial transcripts.
This reads like one of his monologues.....for the most part a good read.
Part voyeuristic education - part howling autobiography.
Now I know where my Dad got all his jokes.
One of the best books I ever read.
Un livre cru et audacieux qui fait du bien par son opposition à la bien-pensance.
