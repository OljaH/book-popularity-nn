شخصیت کاپیتان آرچیبالد هادوک نیز، از همین جلد نهم مجموعه آغاز می‌شود.
در سال 1943 میلادی نسخه ی رنگی کتاب منتشر شد.
نکته جالب درباره ی نسخه رنگی کتاب، حذف شدن صحنه‌ هایی ست، که هادوک مستقیماً از بطری می‌خورد.
It was called “The Adventures of Tintin” in the USA, and named after the middle book of the series, “Tintin: The Secret of the Unicorn” elsewhere:Watching this proved entertaining enough for me to search out the original books, which are still in print, and I started at the beginning with The Crab with the Golden Claws.What a treat it proved to be!
Although The Crab With the Golden Claws was published in book form shortly afterwards, it was not published in the USA until the 1960s, as the first Tintin story.
Is there a greater character in children's fiction than Captain Haddock?Does anyone in Seuss compare to a violent, swearing, alcoholic sea captain who constantly endangers the lives of his friends with his insatiable lust for booze?
(In retrospect this is a pretty booze-soaked story, but as a child I lapped it up- it was so different from the other stuff I was reading!)I loved this book as a child and It holds up pretty damn well as an adult.
If you haven’t read any Tintin, you could do worse than starting with The Crab With the Golden Claws.
My first Comic book that I've "read"! Of course I didn't understand a word of it, I was 4-5 years old and could not read yet.Oh, don't ask logic to my little-self. If I read it as and adult, I think Tintin is one lucky bastard lives in a nice universe where the criminals are mostly polite (except when they lost temper), and ordinary people are kind-hearted. Except Captain Haddock, he is a prodigy in Tintin universe. And this comic is the first appearance of Haddock.
كان كريما جدا فهو يبادلني وأخي الأصغر الكتب والمجلات القليلة التي لدينا ونتبادل الستيكرز المكررة وربما أعارني مرة او اثنتين مجلات تان تان لكن لفترة قصيرة جدا لا تسمح لي بمطالعتها فأعيدها كما كانت وقد أصابني منها الإحباط ..
لا أستطيع قرائتها في هذا الوقت القصير كبرنا ووجدت زملاء وزميلات دراسة آخرين تبادلت معهم كتبا أخرى ونسيت تان تان لفترة وإن ظل في قلبي شيء تجاهه لكن لا تصادفني اعداد هذه المجلة عرفت أنها يعاد طبعا الآن وطبعا طبعا تتوافر في مكتبتي المفضلة بيت الكتب فاشتريت أعدادها كاملة لعلها تشد انتباه اولادي حيث شاهد الولدين الكبار حلقات كارتون تان تان على قناة ج لكنني أعلم أنني سأقرأها كلها قريبا قبلهما بكثير 😅😅 الموضوع يتعلق بحلم طفولة يتحقق عدد غريب ...
This is really becoming a Tintin countdown to Christmas for me.
'The Crab With the Golden Claws' is, I think, one of the most famous Tintin adventures.
It introduces Captain Haddock, the salty sailor with unique swearing abilities that is rather fond of alcohol.
Opium, and Tintin recognises it instantly by sight.
Thompson and Thomson are here and a little bit more slapstick than usual, but the joke of mis-repeating each other is gone.
Now they just repeat each other.
It is another rollicking fun adventure that I remember fondly as a child.I just want to leave you with Captain Haddock swearing:
A series of clues, including a mysterious tin of crab, and the possessions of a drowned sailor leads
Another great Tintin adventure! Very timely as far as the different ways drugs are transported around the world.
I think Tintin was the coolest person to ever exist.
So, finally in this adventure, Tin-tin meets for the first time Le Capitaine Haddock!!!!! And what a state he is in, during this first adventure together! As Captain of a cargo ship, he has been tricked by his immediate to drink too much and stay away from managing what is going on in his ship - while the Lieutenant is trafficking Opium! Of course Tin-tin and Milu come to the rescue...Funny and adventurous, as all of Hergé's books.Maria Carmo,Lisbon 9 January 2015.
This is one of the books on which the latest Tintin film is based. Again, Tintin is up against the problem of drug trafficking. This book is also memorable for it is where Captain Haddock makes his first appearance, as the ship captain with an alcohol addiction who is saved and eventually helped reformed by Tintin.
This is one of the better mysteries of the Tintin series. Really enjoyed it. :)
Viinasieppo kapteeni Haddockin ensiesiintyminen Pohjois-Afrikkaan sijoittuvassa rikosseikkailussa. Mukana myös slapstic(?)-henkiset Dupond ja Dupont. Hauskaa häslinkiä ja sujuvaa toimintaseikkailua.
Este álbum es fundamental ya que Tintín conoce en él al Capitán Haddock, un personaje que será muy importante en sus próximas aventuras.
En esta nueva investigación, Tintín llega tras una serie de pistas hasta un barco llamado Karaboudjan, donde es secuestrado por un grupo de delincuentes que trafican con opio en las latas de cangrejo."El cangrejo de las pinzas de oro" es mucho más corto que "Tintín en el país de los Soviets", concretamente casi la mitad.
En él se nota una gran evolución respecto al primero y un estilo mucho más definido.
Captain Haddock makes his first appearance6 February 2012 Okay, not only is this one of my favourite albums, it is also the album in which we have one of the major characters, Captain Haddock, first appears. At this stage we now have the two police officers (the Thompson twins), the opera singer (Bianca Castafiore), some reoccurring villains (Rastapopolous and Mr Alan Mate), and now Tintin's travelling companion, the drunk ship captain Captain Haddock. It is funny that some have noted that none
At this stage we now have the two police officers (the Thompson twins), the opera singer (Bianca Castafiore), some reoccurring villains (Rastapopolous and Mr Alan Mate), and now Tintin's travelling companion, the drunk ship captain Captain Haddock.
All we know about Tintin is that he is a reporter that works for a Belgian newspaper, and all we know about the Thompson Twins is that they are police officers.
A number of times he does make mistakes, however it is his determination to see that the villains do not get away with their villainy that makes Tintin who he is.
The beginnings of these stories have been around as long as the Lord of the Rings, the illustration and environments in the Tintin books are accurate and extremely detailed.
Anyone who has spent even a little time exploring Herge (Georges Remi) can see the painstaking research and adversity he worked through to compose the world around Tintin.
His ideas were ahead of his time (Exploring the moon, Industrialization, South American political conflict, modern slave trade, extraterrestrial life) and he made certain every detail for every object would be realistic (after the third book at least).
Herge's work can certainly be cited as an influence for any modern day graphic novel or comic book.

the names captain haddock spouts!
Hurray for Haddock!!The Captain finally makes his drunken appearance in a liver-bursting whirlwind of whisky-quaffing, profanity, loutishness, maudlin self-pity and violent assault! The perfect foil for Tintin's often beige-bland earnestness.While certainly played for laughs, Captain Haddock's alcoholism is also clearly shown as being a bad thing - he frequently endangers Tintin's life and several times almost scuppers the investigation - and so we can take a moral lesson from that.Other reviewers have said what happens, so I won't bother. Suffice to say it's really rather good. To be precise, very good.
Admito que as 4 estrelas são, principalmente, pela intervenção do Capitão e dos seus ataques quando estava sob o efeito de álcool, mas foi sobretudo a sua reação a beber um copo de água que teve mais piada.A história é interessante é segue a linha habitual das aventuras de Tintin, valendo sempre a pena dar mais uma vista de olhos por uma das suas aventuras.
First appearance of Captain Haddock!
Ich habe nur diesen Tim und Struppi Fall gelesen, weil mir noch ein Adventure Buch für die 52biay challenge fehlte und ich gerade im Urlaub in Marrakesch verbringe (und der Fall handelt zum Teil im Lande Marokko).Schon viel Zufälle verhelfen Tim beim Krabben Fall und auch wenn natürlich das erste Treffen mit Handdock schon Klassikermaterial ist, hat mir sonst der Comic nicht so gefallen.
Finalmente compare il capitano Haddock!
A true Tintin classic and an important volume of the series for this is the first volume where Captain Haddock appears and becomes Tintin's sidekick besides Snowy (as a side note I would like to add that I've noticed that Snowy has much less dialogue and virtually no exchanges of dialogue with Tintin which was just comical in the earlier editions).
Just as I mentioned in the previous volume, I liked how Herge started doing larger panels for the comic and in this one I think he took further advantage of that and made full page panels of Tintin and the Captain on top of the capsized boat as the plane swoops down attacking them.
Particularly notable are the full-page drawings added to the final version.Of course, one of the story's biggest contributions to the series was the introduction of Captain Haddock, an expletive-spewing but loveable alcoholic who would become Tintin's closest human friend.
Captain Haddock has perhaps the best introduction of any character throughout the series.
The opening pages are enjoyable to read, but give no sign of the overarching plot that never really materialises.Herge has certainly come a long way from the days of "chase-capture-escape-chase" that prevailed in Tintin in America, and this is evident in his characters, and in the appearance of a driving plot.
Herzlich willkommen, Capitaine!In diesem Band passiert etwas, was Auswirkungen auf alle nachfolgenden Tintin-Geschichten hat: Kapitän Haddock betritt die Bühne! Eine wertvolle Ergänzung für die Tintin-Comics. Milou tritt immer mehr in den Hintergrund als Ansprechpartner für Tintin und wird mehr zum echten Hund (auch wenn er noch ab und an denkt), und die Dialoge entstehen mehr zwischen Haddock und Tintin.Auch hier, wie in den meisten Tintin-Bänden, wird spaßige, intelligente und spannende Unterhaltung auf hohem Niveau geboten. Dieser Band ist sogar einen Tick besser als die meisten. Uneingeschränkt empfehlenswert.
This time Tintin gets in trouble while walking with Snowy on the street.
Snowy stuck his head in a can and Tintin helps him out.
Some minutes after Tintin runs in the street with the duet Thomson and Thompson following him, in the search of the garbage for the particular can!
We meet first time the captain Haddock and his bad hobbit of drinking a little to much!
Tintin go around half the world seeking cans of crab meat that turn out to be a cover for drug sales, opium!In this novel Captain, Tintin and Snowy get drunk while they are corned by the drug dealers in a stock room full of barrels and bottles of wine.
One of my favorites, like many this was the first one I read as a boy. The artwork is superb especially in terms of bringing Captain Haddock to life. Would highly recommend this as the first Tintin to give to your child. They will love the pictures and it's got all the staple characters in place.
اللقاء الاول بالكابتن هادوك
#33 for 2018Genre: Children ComicDisini Kapten Haddock pertama kali muncul. Temanya masih tentang penyelundupan opium yang dilakukan oleh seorang mualim kapal yang merupakan anak buah Kapten Haddock. Seperti kita tahu Kapten Haddock merupakan seorang pemabuk, sehingga tidak tahu kalau dimanfaatkan anak buahnya untuk menyelundupkan opium di kapalnya.
