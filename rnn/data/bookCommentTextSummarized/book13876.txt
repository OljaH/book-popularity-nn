What a fantastic ending.
This book was amazing and what a cast of characters set in the WWII time era.
I was so happy for the ending, it almost made me cry.
The book takes the reader all over Europe and of course the United States and what it might have been like for lieutenants in the U.S. Army during WWII and after the war while still in the military.
I'd love to see this as a movie or miniseries if the rest of the books in this series are this good.
I'm looking forward to reading the rest in this series.
When Joe recommended this book, I didn't want to read it because I thought it was another historical fiction book about war.
This book is not about war at all, but about the characters Griffin masterfully creates.
This book made me laugh nightly because of how it pokes fun of the military.
My favorite character is Lowell, a snot-nosed rich kid who gets kicked out of West Point only to get himself commissioned as an officer because a General wants him on his polo team!
Griffin's descriptions of Lowell at Officer functions, and interacting with "desk officers" is classic.
Captivating-- This book -the first in the series- grabbed me like a narcotic--I knew I was hooked in
However, the farther I got into the book I found that Griffin's characters were so multifaceted and deep that I got wrapped up in the story, technical jargon just enhancing the story.The story begins in World War II and takes you through the post years of German occupation, but also the Greek Civil War. But the tidbits of History aside, what I liked most of Griffin's style is his use of humor through out the story - reminding of great military movies and books like, The Dirty Dozen, M*A*S*H and Kelly's Heroes.I'm excited to read the next in the series!
This is the very first book that I've read by W.E.B. Griffin and I think it's the best one. I actually like the characters of Craig and Sandy and how they bonded. After this book, all the other books of Griffin has almost exactly the same romance theme. It felt as though the main protagonists always seemed to be adored or followed around by virgins, prostitutes, young widows, or cougars.
While I'm not big on books that concentrate on the "emotional" and "personal" lives of the characters (who loved who, how did they meet, what problems did they overcome, etc.) But in this case it doesn't ruin the book for me (and I know some of you will actually like this part of the extended story best) as it is so well balanced.
We start here with the Lieutenants who are the central players of the story and follow them.
The story begins here, at the end of World War 2.I picked up a book that takes place later in the series The Berets (The Berets) first as it takes place more in my own time period.
This story begins in the North African theater of operations and soon concentrates on a post-war army.
When five thousand Polish officers and cadets are discovered massacred and dumped into a mass grave, the German high command seeks international confirmation that the atrocities were committed by the Russian and not the German army.
We are soon introduced to the West Point cadet Stanford T.
Cadet Feller, convinced that the war would be over before his graduation and commission, resigns his appointment in order to enlist.
***Spoilers***When he thinks he has lost her after being sent to Greece and then ends up back in the military hospital and she ends up calling his name.
She wasn't just looking for a US soldier to get her into the PX.
***End Spoilers***All the other stories were entertaining, and to some degree weave into the subplot about Craig and Isle, but while I liked them, I didn't find them to have the same power.Well worth the read in any event.
It brought back memories of walking through Munich and Nuerenberg, looking at the pock marks on the stone buildings and wondering who was shooting at who.
This entire series allows the reader to live through such telling events in american history in way that few books can deliver, as it is seen through the eyes of characters that (though fictional) live those events.
It starts in World War II, then to the communist attempt to take over Greece, the Belgian Congo, Korea, Vietnam and beyond.
Actual history mixed with plausible character interaction make for an incredible journey for the reader.The series follows the same characters through their lives during all the periods of history and breathes life into that history.
You will learn as well as be entertained.
Loved it and the whole series (1 through 8 so far). Does the Army really operate this way? It's a combination of "M-A-S-H", "Blacksheep Squadron", and "Winds of War" for a visual analogy. The series follows a group of soldiers from World War II to Vietnam. Their heroics and their failures in their military and personal lives. A West Point graduate, a clerk who is promoted to lieutenant because he can play polo, an enlisted Medal of Honor awardee who gets a battlefield promotion, and others. Excellent read.
Read like a glorified version of the West Point Stepford Wives. Polo playing Academy grads is what we all think of in the years following the end of WWII, right? My most favorite was the complete dismissal of Airborne forces in favor of Armor. Clearly, the author is envious. Legs: So dirty. So nasty.
This was a reread for me. First read this back in the early 80's. The series, The Brotherhood of War, is more about the brotherhood than it is about war. While some of the novel does take place during WW II and immediately after, it really is more about the developing relationships between the warriors.
One of the best books I have read!One of the biggest contributors to this is the character development. Yes, there may be a handful but their relationships and connections to each other all lead to an ending I could not have been happier with.
Excellent book! The characters were unique and believable. The plot had several surprising twists. And despite the serious nature of most situations in the book, it was really funny. The only negative is that there was a lot of military abbreviations, which you had to get used to.
This is a below average soap opera. The author has written oodles of books in at least two series, and they have high ratings so i thought I would try it. Felt strung along because the book ends as a chapter would, not a novel. Equivalent to an average romance novel, but for boys.
This series is like a gateway drug to the reading sloth in the middle of a cold winter.
Instead, he gives us just enough detail (even though there is quite a lot) to help us understand a bit of the background, and then quickly moves on with the story and the characters.Speaking of characters, this really is a ‘character’ book.
(remember there are 8 more books to follow.) As the title implies, the story focuses on characters that are, or become, Lieutenants.
Again, though, this was how a lot of people talked during the particular time.So, yes, heavy on the technical descriptions, but still a great story.
This book is absolute jingoist propaganda trash.
This would be a good book if you managed to rewrite it and take out all of the racism, sexism, anti-semitism, and homophobia.
But even then, it wouldn't change the fact that this series is just conservative anti-communist propaganda from the 1980s.
This is the kind of book that makes white people think that they can use racist terms with their POC friends, and that it's okay because they're friends.
I've never read Griffin's books about cops, but I wouldn't be surprised if they primarily consist of cops murdering POC and pinning it on the victims.
From the late days of World War II to the height of the Vietnam conflict a quarter century later, the novels aim to portray the development of fighting men and the armed service they are part of.The group of characters includes Lowell, the reluctant young scion of an influential Wall Street investment bank; MacMillan, a working-class man eager to be accepted for his talent and skill at logistics and command yet not having the usual cache of a career officer; Bellman and Parker, two men who come from long family traditions of distinguished military service; and Felter, son of Polish-Russian immigrants who wants to be a soldier rather than his family's dream of American success--a doctor, lawyer, or banker.This is the "Wings of War" treatment for the U.S. Army, and it provides clear-eyed accounts of the mixture of bureaucratic misguidedness, battle-honed camaraderie, polished ceremony, and back-channel deal-making that epitomizes the American military institution.The story-telling is well-paced and humane, with a minimum of fluff.
Griffin and, for some reason, Bob Dole's humor books.
I didn't try Dole's books.The book description isn't that descriptive.
It could be on any book set during any war, well no there's mention of Nazi's.
All I really recall is people playing polo and this vague idea that this might have actually been set after the war with a Lieutenant making his way on a USA army base in Germany.
I see that the next book is set during the Korean War, so this series probably did start right at the end of WWII.
Reading it again I've forgotten how good of a storyteller Griffin was before writing with his son in his last few books.
While this one sets the stage for each of his other series (i.e., Corps, Vigilantes, Philadelphia police series) with a rich guy who always bucks the system to beat up the bad guy, with this one you have good character developmet and dialogue, and get a history of the Army from WWII through Vietnam - Korea, tank development, army aviation, Green Berets, you name it.I always liked rooting for Lowell, and each of us has a very tight stickler to the rules Bellmon in our lives - Griffin portrays his characters similar to people ni each of our lives.Reading each book in this series is well worth it - wish I could say the same about his latest books with Butterworth the IV!
Mediocre book Beginning and end are great with lots of action.
However the middle is almost all filler.
The middle of the book is just the soldiers at base playing polo.
A positive is the novel uses great detail and uses this detail to build suspense.
The one thing I love about this novel is the historical accuracy.
The timeline along with details of alliances at that time were flawless.
The items used by each character is historically accurate too.
Overall the book is great for those who love history and terrible for those who love a good plot.
It is a bit surprising that in the early part of the book there is not one single lieutenant but a bunch of senior officers and some with a questionable behaviour like the general and his polo matches. Afterwards the book focuses on 2 lieutenants who are a bit extreme in their behaviour but if they were not the book would be boring
I liked the overall story...how all the characters lives were intertwined. A lot of the military descriptions and terms were unfamiliar to me and dragged the book down a bit. Lowell’s persona was a little over the top. I wanted to like him but was somewhat turned off by his attitude. Felter was an interesting character. I liked how he seemed to achieve far above the expectations for him.
Adventure in Post WWII us ArmyGriffin took something boring and bland, duty in the post WWII drawdown US Army, and made it fresh and interesting. If for no other reason, you should read this first novel of the series.
Very boring book. I thought I'd be reading a historical fiction book about a company of men and their experience of war and conflict. What I found was a boring book about guys hanging out once the war was pretty much over. I didn't finish the book because I was so bored.
This novel is chock-full of interesting characters making important, life changing decisions and having a minute amount of fun in the process. I've never been in the military, but this detailed account of these men from WWII allowed me a peek into what it may have been like. Great stuff.
Story line is simple. Nothing much there. But it is a well written tale of US Army life against the backdrop of World War II last days and thereafter.
Exciting.
Am embarassed I ever read this.
