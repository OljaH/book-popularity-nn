This book is just what I needed. Even though I purchased it a few years ago, I’ve only just got round to reading it. Better late than never, right?Susan Elizabeth Phillips is the queen of romantic comedy. Her stories always manage to cheer me up. They're pure magic. Match Me If You Can is a delightful book that is full charm, wit and hilariousness. What did I like most about this book? The answer is simple- the characters. Heath. Let me quote Salt-N-Pepa: What a man, what a man, what a man, wha
Better late than never, right?Susan Elizabeth Phillips is the queen of romantic comedy.
What did I like most about this book?
Let me quote Salt-N-Pepa: What a man, what a man, what a man, what a mighty good man.
Heath is indeed a mighty good man.
Literature heroines are mostly annoying to me.
There are some heroines who are really incredible, but they are very, very few and far between.
I liked Annabelle.
Everything was Susan Elizabeth Phillips and nothing hurt.
Go read the book, peeps!
Here are a few SEP books I'd hand to someone who says they don't like romance.
She needed deserved the whole package and not the scraps Heath was willing to give at 1st, so kudos to her for sticking to her principles until he finally proved to be worthy of her.This was only my 2nd book by SEP, but I've been told she likes to make her heroes do some serious groveling before conquering their heroines back.
A straight contemporary novel with neither sudden plot twists nor emotionally-draining angst, a lovely heroine, a nice (but emotional slow) hero and a bunch of secondary characters that didn't feel like fillers.
Enjoyed it just as much as reading it!!================================================================l loved it just as much, if not more, the second time around.Annabelle.
She knows what she wants to do and she goes for it.Heath.
But he's made a name for himself and is now a smart, confident, rich guy.Great to catch up with Phoebe, Dan, Molly, Kevin and the gang.I know, Heath's description in the book is nothing like this guy but who cares....
I know what I like so I will just go with what I like!!Pippi, what a cutie she was.And we had a secondary story going with Heath's friend, Bodie.

And the magic continues. Though I have to admit, I wasn’t sure if I was going to love this one as much as the other. I wondered how SEP would pull it off since these two characters were not part of the immediate Chicago Stars family but she did it. I. LOVED.

Though I have to admit, I wasn’t sure if I was going to love this one as much as the other.
IT.I’m going to try to keep this one short and sweet.In  Match Me If You Can we meet Heath.
Annabelle will do what’s needed to keep Heath as her client with her match making company.
Like I said, I wasn’t sure if I was going to love this one as much as the others.
Their story was just as sweet and sexy too.This is such an amazing series and I will highly recommend it to anyone who already loves Susan Elizabeth Phillips writing or to anyone who has yet to read anything from her.
I loved Annabelle's sassy wit.
Basically I loved everything about it.Heath Champion aka The Python, is Chicago's sexiest bachelor, who needs a "perfect" wife by his 35th birthday.
All she has to do is find Heath a wife.I loved watching their relationship progressing.
If Annabelle Granger were a few inches taller, a hell of a lot more sophisticated, better organized, less bossy, and more inclined to worship at his feet, she'd have made a perfect wife.”But Heath finds there is a difference between what he thinks he wants, to what he really needs.Overall, it was an amazing read.
Damn, I found a winner!!!I freaking loved book 1 in the series and now book 6  Match me if you can  totally overthrew book 1 from the pedestal...It's all you seek in a romance, I don't wanna dwell on that, and neither should you...and just like the line in the book goes:  Hey, this is supposed to be like in Jerry Maguire. Remember? 'You had me at hello.  Maybe, it didnt quite happened that way for Annabelle Granger aka Tinker Bell and Heath Champion, in this hilariously spontanious, funny, sweet
totally overthrew book 1 from the pedestal...It's all you seek in a romance, I don't wanna dwell on that, and neither should you...and just like the line in the book goes:
Hey, this is supposed to be like in Jerry Maguire.
"Because you're perfect." "No, I'm not," she laughed.
"But I'm perfect for you."
Amen.Hook, line & sinkerOne of my fave books as of now!
Written May 5, 2015 4.4 Stars - Amusing, romantic, great high quality m/f romance as always from SEPI just finished the 11:15 hrs audiobook edition amazingly well narrated by always delivering Anna Fields.
“I can take care of that all by myself.”From the book blurb:« Why does the wealthy, driven, and gorgeous sports agent Heath Champion need a matchmaker, especially a red-haired screw-up like Annabelle Granger?

but don't tell Heath this last one!).Romantic comedy doesn't get much better than this.Buddy-read with Jill :)
Match Me If You Can is about Heath, the wealthy sports agent, who wants the perfect wife.
Of course, he's too busy to look for this perfect woman and instead has two different match making agencies in search of her.
Annabelle is the owner of one of those agencies and she's determined to find him the perfect woman.
Heath's demands on Annabelle created a lot of fun banter.
Don't let the series numbers stop you from giving it a try.
My kids thought it was funny the only place I ended up with paint was on my ear (from pulling out my headphones).SERIES:
I'm totally reading the books in this series out of order, but hey, real life is so hectic right now and listening to audiobooks is the only way I can get any reading done.
In order to find the right woman, he's hired a matchmaking service to help.
Heath insists that Annabelle be present for every introduction to a new woman.
It takes a while too, but eventually Heath finally catches on..."Annabelle Granger was his perfect match."This was such a fun, sassy read.
I loved how Annabelle didn't hold anything back when talking to Heath.

5 STARSAnother stunner from Susan Elizabeth Phillips! I can’t seem to get enough of these books. Match Me if You Can is Book 5 in the Chicago Stars series, and it features Kevin Tucker’s sports agent... Heath Champion, who has enlisted the aid of a matchmaking firm to find him the perfect wife… before his upcoming deadline for marriage, his thirty-fifth birthday.   “I’m looking for someone extraordinary.” It seems Heath has his life planned to the “T.” After surviving his disaster of a childhood
Unfortunately Heath know’s he’ll never find the woman of his dreams in the company he’s forced to keep, so in order to find his perfect bride he’s hiring out the most prestigious match making firm in Chicago.Annabelle Granger is Molly Tucker’s thirty-one year-old friend from college, and she has recently inherited a matchmaking company from her grandmother.
And she’s determined to make a success of it, since everything else in her life is turning to shit.She just needs a big name… a high profile client to get her the recognition she needs to get her company off the ground.
When she inherits her grandmother’s matchmaking business, Matches by Myrna, she changes the name to “Perfect For You”, and through one of her contacts, she lands Chicago’s ultimate bachelor - aggressive, talented, and devilishly handsome sports agent Heath Champion – aka The Python – as a Perfect For You client.
If Annabelle can match Heath, the success of her matchmaking business would be insured.
Annabelle is so torn as she has to set up dates for the man she’s falling in love with!
Why am I not materialistic enough for chick-lit??But I digress.Annabelle Granger, jack of all trades - master of none, has inherited her late grandmother's matchmaking service.
She's able to throw beautiful, intelligent, successful women at Heath, because they also have problems finding men and need a matchmaker.
I'm beginning to feel sorry for them.) Portia and another side character, Bodie, have their own relationship problems, but they're not really in the book enough for me to come to care about them and their hill of beans.
Frankly, I didn't care about Annabelle and Heath, and they're the stars of this story.Negatives: There was no real connection between the h/h.
4.5 This is one of the best romances I've ever read!I admit, I don't think that a lot of romances deserve more than 3 stars.
Don't get me wrong, I love reading contemporary, but I rarely find a great one.
So, how can a romance get more than 3 stars from me?
Well, there are a few "feelings" I need to have, for it to deserve more.
Any good romance has to make me laugh, anxious, happy, sad, giddy, and, if I'm lucky, it makes me a bit teary as well.
It made me laugh out loud a few times, it was awesome !
Guau uauuuuuu, de verdad lo mío con SEP, es enfermizo. ...maravillosa....divertida y fabulosa....termino por ahora toda la serie de los Chicago Star. ...hasta febrero que sale el siguiente. ...y éste junto con el 4...es el mejor....ME HA ENCANTADO. ....
We have a desperate, down-on-her-luck heroine, Annabelle, who takes over her grandmothers matchmaking business.
Annabelle is one of the loveliest, most courageous and strong heroines I've encountered in this genre, and other than her quirkiness and laugh-out-loud quotes, she has something that makes me sympathize with her and be on her side when she slowly establishes a new life and eventually gets her love.
These two have so much chemistry, it's really tangible and one squirms until the end because yes, this isn't a CR where the hero and heroine jump into bed the first time they see each other.
I've read Match Me If You Can four times now - without a doubt my favorite SEP book in the Chicago Stars series! - so I couldn't help picking up the audio version after reading several rave reviews about it. Anna Fields was very talented and her voice was most definitely a perfect match for the scatterbrained Annabelle Granger. (Sort of reminds me of actress Zooey Deschanel.) It saddens me to hear that Anna Fields passed away. I will be snatching up as many of her audio books as possible before they become collector items. =)
3 starI liked how the couple transitioned from friends to a relationship as opposed to insta love. I didn't feel like this made much of an impact on me though. In fact I'm pretty sure it will be forgotten next week. Overall it was a nice light fluffy book to pass the time.
Nisam očekivala puno od ove knjige, ali mi se zaista svidela.Heath me je totalno osvojio. :)
This is romantic comedy at its most magnificent, fantastic from all angles. I cannot recommend this author enough, she's the best of that contemporary romance has to offer at this point.
I really need to get myself a permanent paperback copy.June 17, 2009 Review----------------------------------2nd Time through (and a year later), I feel like I was crazy when I first read this.
I actually like Annabelle (and her faults - she reminds me of myself) and Heath has become a lot more sexy.Annabelle is reinventing her grandmother's matchmaking business and her first big client is going to be Heath Champion, aka The Python - if she can convince him and keep an upper hand.
le doy las 5 otra vez, lo adorooooooooooooooooo
Annabelle HeathSEP never disappoint. The story is the typical romance but have a great characters. It was nice that the Chicago stars members is back is complete with additional Pippi, who won my heart.
Match me if you can is a sassy, fun, light hearted romantic comedy about finding love. It wasn't as dazzling as It Had To Be You, but it was definitely entertaining. I enjoyed it!
Me fascina la capacidad que tiene esta mujer de crear historias parecidas pero únicas, tan divertidas y entretenidas que es imposible no disfrutarlas. Annabelle y Heath son otra pareja para recordar, con SEP una sabe a que atenerse y la verdad, nunca decepciona.
Nuestra reseña en A la cama con... un libro
Both Annabelle and Heath are fun to spend time with and their banter is outstanding.
I loved even more that her doing her honest best let him know her well enough to fall for her in return.Seriously, I can't think of any aspects of the novel that had me even pause a little bit in my enjoyment.
And neither (view spoiler)[Annabelle's withdrawal after they go too far nor Heath's inability to say the right words at the right time (hide spoiler)] changed that (and both normally would have at least had me pause a little bit).
It made me smile, laugh and sad.Also, imo, it's the rare book of SEP that hero's presence was so much prepotent and I loved that fact very much.Heroine is a sweet heart.
I think, I can say that she's one of my favorite heroines in all of book piles that I read so far.I loved the romance, their banter, their friendship and enthusiasm.
Just, at the end of the book where after hero confessed his love, she still didn't believe it and what happened afterward was not solid for my taste or it suis the plot's general progress.
