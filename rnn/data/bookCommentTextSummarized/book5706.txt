I read this book in my summer holidays, and I wanted to be there, in Peterswood, because their summers are so much more amazing, what with lemonade, and macroons, and that little tea shop, and disguises, and of course, the lovable Mr. Goon.
In this particular book, our five friends kind of get into a sticky situation when they disguise themselves as relatives of one, Prince Bongawah, who ends up kidnapped.
With 'pomes' like "The pore old gardener" and "There was a coff that carried him off", delectable dishes a la classic Enid Blyton style, disguises including Princess Bongawee and old John Smith, the humour in this book is on point.
I think this book deserves five stars for this poem (or pome) alone ...A pore old gardener said, Ah me!My days is almost done,I've got rheumatics in my knee,And now its hard to run.I've got a measle in my foot,And chilblains on my nose,And bless me if I haven't gotPneumonia in my toes.All my hair has fallen out,My teeth have fallen in,I'm really getting rather stout,Although I'm much too thin.My nose is deaf, my ears are dumb,My tongue is tied in knots,And now my barrow and my spadeHave all come

They decide to solve the mystery and pass the information on to Mr Goon to make up for what they‚Äôve done.
But whether or not Goon believes them, nothing can deter the Findouters from solving ‚Äúa nice juicy mystery‚Äù and that‚Äôs what they go on to do in this one.This findouters mystery wasn‚Äôt very PC, particularly the sections on their disguises and some of the children‚Äôs observations on the Prince.
In fact, while I had read this book before, I had forgotten that the solution was not very straightforward‚Äïeven once they‚Äôve solved part of it, there is another surprise reveal.
had a good laugh at The Five Find Outers's joke at Mr. Goon at always üòÇ

Ill-conceived, xenophobic nonsense. The number of ridiculous assumptions and coincidences in the Find-Outers' investigation is far too high for me to engage with this story on any level.
Another classic Blyton I remember reading in my childhood, now available on Kindle!
The kids decided to take a break on the case and went to a fair ground but only to find the Prince's PJs hanging on a washing line.
Fatty met a boy and said that he was a friend of the little boys parents, Fatty ask him if he could tell him how his family got the Prince's PJs. So the boy told Fatty everything, it turns out that when the Prince was on the way to the camp ground that was when he got kidnapped.
In the first night at the camp grounds the little boys parents toke their son and made it look like it was a kidnapping.
saya tumbuh dengan buku-buku beliau, dan ini adalah salah satu dari sekian banyak karya enid blyton yang saya sukai.oke, saya akan mereview sedikit.
Pasukan mau tahu yang terdiri dari Fatty, Bets, Pip, Larry dan Daisy dan pelengkap adalah anjing Fatty, Buster kali ini memulai misteri mereka dengan pura-pura menyamar sebagai anak-anak bangsawan saudara dari Pangeran Asing dari Negara Tetarua yang kebetulan sedang ikut berkemah di Peterswood.
Pak Goon yang terheran-heran terlibat adu cekcok dengan Bets yang menyamar sebagai adik dari Pangeran Tetarua.Singkat cerita setelah insiden ini, tiba-tiba Pangeran Tetarua menghilang dari kemahnya.
I only found the last part of the book anywhere near interesting although i cant complain since the 
No Find-Outers book is perfect, and this one shows up Enid Blyton's xenophobia at times, though you don't see anything like the full extent of it here.
Fatty doesn't really give the others much to do in this one, and I did miss Bets' brainwaves - she only has one, very quick one.
Fatty's behaviour towards Mr Goon is pretty disgraceful, especially when he has his bike confiscated whilst riding it in disguise, and then reports it stolen five minutes later.
Even so, I have to give this one three stars, because for the first time since book one I didn't once want to slap a healthy dollop of sense into the Find-Outers.
The Mystery of the Vanished Prince by Enid Blyton was a good mystery. The Find-Outers did a credible job in their sleuthing. However, the book borders on being offensive in the description and treatment of the 'foreign' prince, the 'gypsies', and the working class boys Ern, Perce and Sid. I don't know if the text in this edition has been modified from the original. If so, it hasn't been modified enough. You don't have to be very sensitive to find a lot of cringe-worthy moments. Probably one of the better examples of Blyton at her worst.
It's funny what you remember from a book you read years ago as a child and read again. I remember the toffee eater and the camp site and elements of the vanished prince mystery. Other parts I had forgotten, and I never had picked up on the whole importance of Bets and her differing relationships with people. That's nine of the fifteen mysteries done and dusted, and we are now in the home stretch. Can we get to 100 Blyton's by Christmas?
Well here's a mystery. A kidnapping, but it looks as if the boy went willingly with his captors? Was he tricked, or something else. Every clue matters, and it's a small one that will help the Find Outers solve the case this time! Five cheers for Enid Blyton, Five stars as well!
Hey Enid Blyton, your xenophobia and racism is showing. As far that kid Fatty, I wholeheartedly agree with Goon there. What a toad of a boy! But of course everyone thinks that sun shines out of his every orifice. Just reading about him makes me want to smack away his sense of entitlement. Gah!
mah first famous five book...will never forget ya!!!
A nostalgic tale that takes me back to my childhood.
It is a very nice book! I like it.
where do you go to read the book
This book in awsome!!!!!
this book was full of mystery ,just as suggested by the name of this book.i know that many others would have enjoyed such a nice book.it was really useful for my school hols .
It was a excellent story.
Memory lane read.
Fatty excels at the end and surprises everyone with his brilliance
Nice plot! :D
I loved the last part most I agree with you Linn but it was a great story though
Notable for the author's magnificent use of the word 'asinine' on page 74. No one can accuse Blyton of talking down to her young readers.
very very nice!
Well, this was a jolly good read. Very English. There were times when things were "too convenient" to be a real detective novel, if you know what I mean. But overall a fun and exciting page turner.
enid blyton is an europe author and she is one of my favorites... all her books are a must read... this one is a mystery by the five-find outers...
