'In truth we do not go to Faery, we become faery, and in the beating of a pulse we may live for a year or a thousand years.' A good collection, very funny and with that uniquely Irish feel to it. And I should say that this is not so much a collection of Irish fairy tales as a collection of Irish sagas, interactions with the daoine sídhe woven through them.A few of the tales are beautifully told, in particular The Story of Tuan Mac Cairill, 'The green tides of ocean rose over me and my dream, so
'The green tides of ocean rose over me and my dream, so that I drowned in the sea and did not die, for I awoke in deep waters, and I was that which I dreamed.I had been a man, a stag, a boar, a bird, and now I was a fish.In all my changes I had joy and fulness of life.
But in the water joy lay deeper, life pulsed deeper.For on land or air there is always something excessive and hindering, as arms that swing at the sides of a man, and which the mind must remember.

I picked this up because everyone is using Faery in their stories and I wanted to have a better understanding of the mythology that people are (loosely) pulling from.
It is in the voice of the author, minds of the people and their view of the other.
They would reference people they loved as “O’ my soul” and “O’ my pulse.” These are very unique and they apply to men and women equally.
Imagery: These tales use the most unique and effective imagery and description I have ever read.
I loved these tales.
They were fun and easy to read.
This is well worth downloading and reading for fun.
So apparently the stars were aligned for this one, all five of them.When I started reading these Irish Fairy Tales I realized that I was completely ignorant when it comes to Irish folklore, and Celtic folklore in general.
So the way I understood it was that fairies are from Faery, and people can pass through from one universe to the others.Anyway, it became quite clear to me as I was reading these tales just how much this folklore has impacted modern Fantasy.
It was mostly tales mixed with Christian beliefs (which looks weird), and mostly about the amazing Fionn.They don't seem to be together, even though they reccount the life and adventures of Fionn, but every now and then there are stories who have nothing to do with him and that seem disjointed, because I can't put them in.And then...
It works far better like that, it got funny, it was hilarious and boy I had a laugh.I particularly like the last story, and the killer sheep.
Boy those Irish sheep are sure dangerous.
"Indeed, Fionn loved Saeve as he had not loved a woman before and would never love one again.
He loved her as he had never loved anything before.
The belling of a stag had been music to Fionn but when Saeve spoke, that was sound enough for him....his wife's voice was sweeter to Fionn than the singing of a lark.
Her slender foot set his heart beating; and whatever way her head moved, there came a new shape of beauty to her face.
'She is always new,' said Fionn.
'She is always better than any other woman; she is always better than herself.'"--James Stephens
A collection of short Irish fairy tales, mostly centred around Fionn and the Fianna.
its good to begin an ireland's adventure!
Horrendously slow.
awesome stories. some my grams told me.
This was an enjoyable collection to read. Stephens' writing was much better than I was expecting -- for some reason I thought it would be a very flowery, wordy, forced-archaic style, but it turned out to be clean and lively. The tales are broken down weirdly, in that each "chapter" of a tale is short and hardly worth the page break. And in some of the tales the author wedges in some kind of "old gods vs new christianity" motif that contributes little to the overall story. But those are minor gr

I'm not that familiar with Irish tales or mythology, so I can't say how close the author sticks with the tradition, but it did inspire me to dig further into that area, as well as make me interested to read more of Stephens' work.
These aren't even the sort of fairy tales I was looking for, being mostly about Finn and the Fianna, but actually, there's a good deal of fairy stuff in here, so I think it was worthwhile from that point of view.So it opens with the story of a man here since the first people came to Ireland after the flood and follows on down through mythical settlements and invasions, with the man transforming into a beast at each juncture and enjoying a long exuberant life as king of that species, until finally he becomes king of the salmon, gets caught by a fisherman of the King of Ulster, is eaten by the queen and born to her as a son.
3.5La storia di Tuan mac Cairill: ***La fanciullezza di Fionn: ****La nascita di Bran: ****La madre di Oisin: ***Il corteggiamento di Becfola: ***La piccola rissa ad Allen: ***Lo zotico dalla palandrana stinta: **** 1/2L’antro incantato di Cesh Corran: *** 1/2Becuma dalla bianca pelle: ** 1/2La follia di Mongan: ** 1/2
Fionn loves his wife as no man has ever loved another and she is turned into a deer and Fionn searches and never finds her, but in his search eventually he finds a young boy who looks like his beloved who tells a story of being raised by a deer.The Wooing of Becfola- the king meets a woman who is in love with his son but he convinces her to marry him, and still she loves the prince.
Becuma does not win.Mongan's Frenzy-Mongan falls in love with cows and trades away his perfect wife for them(and her handmaid in the process) then decides he has to have her back.
I understand that it's old-time Faerie tales but it was delivered in an old time, dull way. Could have modernised it even slightly and it would have been a less 'heavy' read.
The family then singlehandedly yet collectively made their stead to the dead grandfather's burial location via the rented bus, AKA 'a metaphor,' for the final burial rights.
Fictitious, lighthearted family hugging did also seem to occur, if memory serves correctly.The Red Badge of Discourage was a disjointed, poorly-written debut novel, written hastily in the pre-Internet days, mind you, and I'm glad that I lost the lawsuit in a most embarrassing fashion.
Discourage has never and will never see the light of day and I wish never to return in my mind to the fictitious rural community of Follidaze Heights.
Walton proudly expressed her loyalty to her source material, saying that she did not cut anything from the original Welsh tales, but only fleshed out what was there.
What Walton would go on to do for The Mabinogi, Stephens does here for several stories from the Fenian Cycle of Irish mythology.
Walton leaves one curious to peruse the original myths, because one has seen the enticing fruits it has borne when planted in a fertile imagination.
One thirsts for the actual sources after reading Stephens because there is greatness hinted at, but not realized.
there are some beautifully written passages here, and the better stories are well worth reading.
Those of you that read Stephens' The Crock of Gold and loved it as much as I did should read this book as well.
But more than all of this, Stephens' love of his culture and his heritage shines through on every single page.I am haampered somewhat by not having encountered these tales told in a more standard form, but it really doesn't matter.
I intend to read it many more times, just for the fun of it!(P.S. This version of the book was digitized from the original book by volunteers who loved it as much or even more than I did.
This was a fascinating collection of fairy tales, if a bit uneven.
I didn't expect the stories to be paced according to modern sensibilities, but neither did I expect them to be so witty.
Most of the stories were from the Fionn Cycle and referenced Fionn often.
Sometimes these tales dragged for me, especially when focusing on battle prowess.
However, there were enough tales involving the lords and ladies of Faerie and the humans who outwitted them to balance things for me."The Birth of Bran" was my favorite by far, and "The Little Brawl at Allen" was my least, though "The Boyhood of Fionn" ran a very close second.
1 Tuan McCairillAbbot Finnian fasts on the doorstep to convert Tuan, who then admits he landed with Noah's Ark, but when population grew from 24 couples to 5K overall, a sickness took all but Tuan.
After 22 years alone, he looked like a wild beast when Nemed landed 34 barques with 30 couples each.
He was "hairy and tufty and bristled as a savage boar ..
lean as a stripped bush ..
greyer than a badger; withered and wrinkled like an empty sack; naked as a fish; wretched as a starving ..
to continue ..

This book started out being a continuous narrative of Irish folk lore.
I thought the attempt was interesting, but then he gave it up and said yeah these next stories were just told by Finn's son because he spent a lot of time in faery and that's how he knows them, okay?
As far as the stories I know go, they were told faithfully to the originals.
One of the other problems with the book, is that it does not tell you what the sources are for the stories, so that if you are interested in the originals of these stories you will have to find some other means of tracking them down.
Fairy Tales are never meant for children, for only true adults-- that is to say-- they who have the capacity to respect and admire the amount of work that was put into writing a really good story can also grasp what it is inside fairy tales and other fantasy works that, even now, in the wake of technologies and smartphone wars, people all over the world still fell in love with fantasy genre.This book's strength lies in the author's voice, and I have to say, it's a really good voice that reminds me of The Griffin and the Minor Canon by Frank R.
Stockton.Ever feel tired and bored by the declining numbers of worthwhile contemporary fantasy books?
This one would put your hope back on fantasy writers.
I'm sure this is a very good book, but unfortunately i read the Bahasa version, i got really confused with the sentence (maybe because of the way in translating from English to Bahasa). I need to be very very very focused in reading this book to get understand the story (I believe this book is not that hard to understand).Well if I got the English version, I would really glad to "re-read" this book :)
Those were some bizarre tales, with Norsemen, Saxons, Welsh, Scottish and Britons involved. So if you’re expecting a fairy you better look somewhere else, in here it’s a whole kingdom apart. I did enjoy the Weapons of Mass Destruction, in the form of killer sheep. Christian mythos revolving and forcing their way in the old Celtic ones felt really forced, trying to put a date was really hard, when you have actual facts, fairy and corn around.
Not exactly what I hoped of this book, I was thinking it wold be more a collection of shot stories of various Irish Fairy tales, but it was an interesting read none the less. The entire book deals with Fionn, an Irish King, or his family. A love for folklore is the best reason to pick this up, as the writing nor the story telling is much to speak of.
There are quite a few really great tales in this collection, most of them following Fionn or his relatives. I found most of these stories enchanting and whimsical. They made me feel like a child again. Some of them do get rather boring, however, and it seems that all of them end very abruptly, leaving the reader feeling jarred.
Mairtin O Cadhain, the great Irish (Gaelic) novelist, once commented that Stephens' writing embodied more of the Irish (Gaelic) language than the Irish (Gaelic) language itself--an overstatement, of course, but Stephens sure was good.These are retellings of medieval manuscript tales, and, all I can say is that it would be nice if there were more of them. A good book.
Loved this book. Great Arthur Rackham illustrations and wonderful storytelling. The tales were rewritten with humor and genuine warmth, and the characters aren't flat, the way that they are in so many folk and fairy tales.
Reading this as an E-Book I found the format a little confusing. It seemed like several separate multi-chaptered stories but then many of them were actually continuations of others. It was sometimes confusing keeping track of whom was from Ireland and whom from Faerie etc. but worth reading.
