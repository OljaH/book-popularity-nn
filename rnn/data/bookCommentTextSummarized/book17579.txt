My kids go to an International School with a lot of Americans and the fuss they make about Homecoming - Jeez!
And I love looking at the Cheerleaders - seriously, who would let their daughter be a cheerleader - no offense meant to anyone.I was the fat kid in school, I didn’t have a boyfriend.
I am now happily married to Tate Jackson - being the fat kid makes you kind of delusional.As I said, I am not American and don’t follow football.
But I have read about jocks.
Anna thinks Drew is a typical JOCK - cocky, full of himself, loves the ladies, puts out for the ladies.
4.5 stars  The Hook Up is one of those books that has been on my TBR for FOREVER!
All my friends loved it, and here I am, picking it up well over a year after it’s release.
This, my friends, is a fail moment for me.
I seem to be having a lot of those in the book world.
Too many books and not enough time I say.
My point- if you are a NA fan and are in the same boat as me, READ THIS BOOK!
It was swoony, sweet, and sexy.
Everything I love in a romance.
When Drew Baylor, the hottest guy on campus and star quarterback, starts showing her attention, she doesn’t know what to think.
Anna is different than any girl Drew’s met and he’s enamored with her from the start.
How it starts as just a hook up (because that’s all Anna is willing to give) and turns into so much more (due to Drew’s unwillingness to back down and declare he wants more from her).
Both Drew and Anna were great characters.
Besides Anna and Drew, I loved Drew’s friend Gray.
Anna and Drew’s love story wasn’t easy.
The Hook Up is one of the better NA books I’ve read this year.
*****4.5 BATTLE BUTT BAYLOR LOVIN' STARS*****{BR with Alice, Dee, Sophie, and Stephanie}"You shine so brightly, Drew. And it's beautiful to me, but I didn't know how to live under your light.""What people see? That is only gloss. But, Anna, you light  me  up. I don't have a light anymore unless you're there." Now this is what I call NA at its best!!I'm asking myself why in the hell did I wait so long to read this book??!! I was told that this was similar to "The Deal". Yes, there were a couple s
*****4.5 BATTLE BUTT BAYLOR LOVIN' STARS*****{BR with Alice, Dee, Sophie, and Stephanie}"You shine so brightly, Drew.
Anna tries to keep things strictly physical and for most of the story she doesn't allow Drew to kiss her on the lips, as she feels that it would lead to intimacy and so much more.
Anna ends up becoming fiercely protective over Drew and eventually will find the strength to battle her inner demons in order to save their relationship.The angst that develops in the story at times became unbearably painful but I actually live for the angst, so it only made this book that much better for me!!
Re-read:  Continuing my book/life slump re-read extravaganza... Re-read: 5/22/15 What a satisfying read! I really enjoyed this one. Drew and Anna were both great characters and I really enjoyed their story. They had a lot of chemistry and a lot of passion. I liked Anna a lot. She was pretty level-headed and didn't act like a dumbass and do dumbass things. And I always consider not hating or being irritated to death by the heroine to be a win.The writing was also very good and you could really t
So many times you read college sports romances and the athlete seems to have all this free time broken only by the occasional "big game," which is definitely not the case.
And if you're on scholarship, you are being paid to play your sport, not attend toga parties and haze freshman.So, like I said, college athletes being depicted as dual athlete/frat peeps?As much as it kinda worked in books like Sweet Homes, which I LOVED?S.T.U.P.I.D.Here the author mentions Drew's early morning weight/conditioning sessions, afternoon classes, game film study sessions, and heavy class load.
4.5 Stars  Love, when it came for me, did not creep. No, it walked up to me, bold as you please, you know, just in case I wasn't paying attention. It did, however, slap me upside my head.  If you're looking for your next NA Romance that's guaranteed to make you swoon, make you sweat, and make you smile, then you have definitely found your next read.

Kristen Callihan is a new to me author, but will now be gracing my auto-buy shelf because she weaved a story that technically should have been 'been there, read that', yet managed to suck me in so thoroughly that I couldn't bring myself to put it down.Now if you're a half-assed blurb reader and occasionally make assumptions like me, you probably read this:
So when the school's football golden child and resident playboy starts sending her the lusty eyes, she wants none of it...or so she tells herself.Meet Drew BaylorStar quarterback, and the hot commodity on campus that can have any girl he wants without even trying...except Anna.
This is a girl that due to her dysfunctional family dynamic avoids relationships as a rule...especially with guys like Drew.
"You'll see Drew. One day, love will creep up and smack you upside the head. Then you'll understand."    "Never force something, Drew. A bolt, a pass, a game, whatever. Force it and you'll lose. Patience and persistence is how you win in life. Take your time, look for the solution, and if it doesn't come to you, fall back, reassess, and try again."  I was rereading this one to prepare myself for Glamour Gray and got a little ashamed that I haven't written my review earlier because, clearly, I
Boyfriend.Oh yes, he was a popular, hot jock, but a smart one to that.
Why won't you let me kiss you, Anna?It's too much.Not when I want everything.
But, Anna, you light me up.
She was such a likeable heroine, every girl's best friend material for sure.
She wasn't annoying though, when she finally got her shit together, she fought for Drew and helped him through rough times, she was there for him when he needed her most.
No, it was more like oh, hell-yes-please, I'll have that.
"You're it for me, Anna Marie.You're my home Drew."
The Hook Up begins with an opening scene where it seems to be ‘lust-at-first-sight’ but we quickly find out that our heroine, Anna, is a sassy girl who doesn’t take any crap from cocky football players.
It would be when I fell in love.’Well, Drew’s first words to Anna proved his mom’s point:“Hey there, Big Red.” I actually laughed when I read that because I knew this boy was in trouble when those words fell out of his mouth.
This story is a well done entertaining read. I have read this plot of the hot quarterback falling for the non-Barbie type of girl with issues many times over. However, the author brings her own flare and incorporates great banter and hot sex scenes to the tale. When Anna is hit on in her college classroom by the star quaterback of the school's football team she tries to resist. Finally she caves to Drew's charms and attempts to keep him in a hook up category. "If she thinks she can hide behind s
I have read this plot of the hot quarterback falling for the non-Barbie type of girl with issues many times over.
However, the author brings her own flare and incorporates great banter and hot sex scenes to the tale.
His pov was well done and his feelings for Anna were butterfly inducing.
I also found myself feeling very protective of him for the majority of the story he was such a sweetheart.
"Though I think want is too weak a word here.
I will definitely be picking up the next book in the series about Gray the hot jock who can cook.
One of my all-time faves. Love this hero so much!
I'm not a fan of hook ups, sex-only relationships or new-adult reads.
reads pretty much par-for-the-course for a new-adult novel - first person pov, college-age protags, heavy doses of heartache and angst, traumatic childhood/teen years, the lightning bolts when their eyes first meet, and lots of sex.
What starts as just hook-up sex, becomes more as the development of their romance also brings a true intimacy into their love scenes.Both Anna and Drew are likable main characters.
But an unreserved recommendation though for readers of new-adult, and for readers who enjoy sports romances with college-age protags.
4.5--It Was Never Just a Hook Up--Stars!!This book! Gah! It made me feel so much! Butterflies, angst, fear, love, hope, pain! I loved every minute of Anna and Drew's love story. The good, the bad and the ugly!!! Anna:The girl who holds on to the insecurities of her past...Drew: The larger than life football star...A love story that starts as a hook-up because the girl can't ever imagine that the boy would choose her.

I loved every minute of Anna and Drew's love story.
Anna:The girl who holds on to the insecurities of her past...Drew: The larger than life football star...A love story that starts as a hook-up because the girl can't ever imagine that the boy would choose her.
A love story where the girl makes the boy feel whole, feel alive for the first time since the death of his parents.
A love story filled with fear and insecurity.
A stubborn love story, filled with mistakes and wrong choices.
A perfect love story of the girl no one sees and the boy who only sees the girl.
But then I read this book and it changed my perspective completely because sometimes...sometimes you read something so wonderful it reaffirms your faith in an otherwise tired sub genre.
The way Drew's and Anna's relationship developed and evolved was tender, realistic and had my heart doing backflips.
Drew has to be one of the most lovely and excruciatingly beautiful characters I've read in a long time.
The secondary characters were fantastic and the second book is about one of Drew's best friends, which I really look forward to.

Although she's written several books, they are in the historical/paranormal/steampunk genres and I don't dabble much in those.

The characters weren't perfect, but showed real human emotions and even when I wanted to break out something really hard and smack Anna upside her stubborn little head, I was rooting for them all way.

4.5 Battle Butt Baylor stars  "You've destroyed me, Anna Jones."   Anna is a regular girl who doesn't know what she wants to do in her life. She is in college now, trying to stay as unnoticed as possible, but this seems impossible, especially when the quarterback from the football team, Drew Baylor, sets his eyes on her.

His character was so flawless that had me drooling all over him, thinking 'I wish there were guys like him in real life.' Maybe there are, I just hadn't been lucky enough to find my personal flavor of Drew ;)Anyway, thanks to Kristen Callihan now I have another book boyfriend to add to my list.

The sensation is so unnerving that I can only sit there, my hand fluttering to my chest where my heart struggles to break free(...)

Anna:
The second our gazes connect, hot tingles zap through me, making my breath catch and my nipples harden.
It was like a hot finger stroking down my spine.
My head snapped up.
And there she was, so fucking pretty that I couldn’t think straight(...) One word was playing a loop in my head: mine.
Just NO.And then every time she sees him her nipples get hard, her thighs clench, gets hot and achy, can't breathe right, her pulse skyrockets...And I just can't...Why you ask?

I'm a 34 wife/mum so its not something I read all the time just occasionally saying that, please don't judge this book by its cover which I kind of of did a few months back when I first cast my eyes on it but hey I was in the need of a sports romance themed story and bam here I am blown away by this book, the words and thoughts of these characters were just so mature I honestly was hooked from page one.
OMG Why the hell I wait to read this book?
Ahhhh I'm so in love with Drew.
:) Drew & Anna were so sweet and funny together.
My God, this book was pure perfection.
xoxoPs. I'm definetly gonna read the other books very soon.
:-D You're so beautiful to me," he says against my mouth.I pull back to look him in the eyes.
"To you?"He often says that, and part of me wonders if others have said something contrary to him."To me." His fingers trace the curve of my shoulder, brushing a lock of hair over it.
Drew Baylor is the star quarterback on a winning football team.
The star football player on a winning football team is everything here, and Battle Baylor is everything there too.Naturally Anna assumes Drew is just like every other jock, perhaps even worse since he is the star quarterback.
To her surprise, Drew proved to be anything, but typical and I fell in love with him.
I didn’t love Anna as much, she was much more frustrating since I was so in love with Drew, sigh.
I loved that it had both, so few books do.
This book grabbed my attention with characters that have goals and work bloody hard to reach them and feel satisfaction when their hard work pays off.Big Red...what was Drew thinking?
Anna, is not afraid to put Drew in his place when he assumes she'd jump at the chance to be with him.
Neither of them can deny their overwhelming attraction to each other, but while Drew is keen, Anna is friggin petrified.
Both Anna and Drew have reasons for their eagerness and hesitations.
Both of them are not as confident as they would have everyone believe.I loved the characters in this story, especially with Anna and Drew's friends playing pivotal roles.

Why, Anna?""It's too much," I rasp."Not when I want everything." He says it so deep and strong, a staking of a claim.
Drew has other plans, and won't give up until he makes Anna his.
What I loved the most was seeing him try to sway Anna into being in a relationship with him the was more than just sex.
She has gone through some things that make her quite insecure about why on earth a guy like Drew could want her.
It was so beautiful watching these too interact, especially during those sweet moments that melted my heart.
Especially to those who love the New Adult genre.

Find all of my reviews at: http://52bookminimum.blogspot.com/Drew Baylor is the star quarterback for the football team who has a reputation for being a player both on and off the field. Anna Jones is a curvy girl-next-door type who has zero interest being another notch on Baylor’s bedpost. You know what that means, right? I noticed Mrs. Joseph reading another book in this series and it peaked my interest because of . . .  Mmmmmmmm, beard. Unfortunately the porny liburry did not have that one ava
You have two options – abtastic with an “accessory” (a football, motorcycle, tattoos, beard, whatevs) or “I wanna bang that tiger in the hoodie” like such .
While Drew (did I call him Caleb somewhere because I seriously keep wanting to type Caleb and I’m not even gonna go check myself) and Anna quickly realize that much like the Usher song, they got it they got it bad .
The Game Plan could have earned 4 Stars, but I’m sticking with three because seriously enough is e-mothereffing-nuff with the drama llama and this could have easily been a hundred pages shorter and wrapped up without me getting stabby.
3.5 starsMeh. Typical angsty NA . . . but not so angsty that I got fed up with it, so I count it a win.
** 5++ "My world lives in your palm, Anna" STARS **   "You've destroyed me, Anna Jones."~ DREW  Such a beautiful story...GOD, I'm so glad I picked this one up after resisting it for so damn long. Once again, I am reminded of the stupidity of prejudice. I normally try to refrain from NA Romance, because they're mostly...well, the same sh*t with slight subject differences.But this one was  GOLDEN .

. Somehow I felt totally sucked into the story and had to abandon all my earthly responsibilities to see how this messy little love story wraps up, anxious to get to the next page.When Anna Jones hurried to take her seat in the classroom after being a bit late, how could she have known that the king of college football and the boy coloring every damn girl’s dreams on campus, Drew Baylor, would sit right next to her?
And that’s not even the good part: After the minute their eyes meet, Drew never takes his away from her, staring at her with lusty eyes and acting all awestruck and sh*t!Anna feels a pull like she has never experienced before.
In a world of stories with predictable plot twists, characters with haunted pasts, and unnecessary shock value thrown in for good measure, I personally have found it SO HARD to find a light read that isn’t beyond cheesy or just….well, boring.So when one comes along with one of the most fantastic heroes I have read about, I want to scream “YES FINALLY!!!!!” from the top of my lungs.Basic plot - Drew is Mr. Popular Star Quarterback of his college, and Anna catches his eye on their first day of class.
There are some funny moments, some hot sexy times, some sad scenes...and they get a HFN ending.POV: This alternated between Anna and Drew's POV.Overall Pace of Story:  Good.
It takes a while for the h to develop stronger feelings, but the H feels strongly right away (doesn't express love or anything until way later).H rating: 4 stars.
(hide spoiler)]Heat level: Hot. They have some hot tension, chemistry, and scenes -- but not so much it takes away from the story.Descriptive sex: YesOW/OM drama: Yes, but when separated (view spoiler)[Both of them see each other out on dates with other people when separated, and this causes jealousy for both of them.
“I’ve just experienced the hottest, most erotic, life-changing sex of my life, and I don’t think I’m going to get a repeat. Tonight was obviously an ill-advised hook up for her. And I’m so screwed because it was the best thing that has ever happened to me.”  I think I’m too old for college-themed stories. Or at least I like to tell myself that I am. The truth is that they rarely have the emotional complexity and substance that I now, as someone who is no longer of college age, seek in my reads
Drew Baylor is the popular jock, the football superstar that everyone wants to know or be, but under his perfect exterior hides a lonely young man, the untimely death of his parents having left him alone in the world and craving a true connection with someone.
Unfortunately, their willingness to embrace that happiness differs from the very beginning—while Drew sees what his life would be with someone like Anna in it and wishes to capture it forever, Anna remains emotionally distant, her growing need and feelings for him overwhelming her and making her want to run in the other direction.
4.5 StarsI really enjoyed this one.
I loved Drew and his ability to be one of the best collegiate athletes in the country and still retain a douche free existence.
Anna was all kinds of awesome and, even though she did not go willingly into this relationship and that fact tired the fuck out of me, I loved her snark.
I can't wait for Glamour Gray' s story next!edited to add: I originally rated this 4 stars, even though I have a 4.5 rating.
I'm bumping that up to 5 stars.
I keep going back to this one for all kinds of reread situations and that alone deserves some proper respect.
The rules: no kissing on the mouth, no staying the night, no telling anyone, and above all… No falling in love.
