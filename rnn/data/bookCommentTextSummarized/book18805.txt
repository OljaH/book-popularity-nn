I've picked Nine Rules, and here's why...It's because if I could choose to be any heroine from a historical romance, I'd want to be Lady Calpurnia Hartwell, and here's why...I find I’m at a loss for words when trying to describe the wide range of emotions this book evoked in me, except to say that it made me laugh, cry, sigh, gasp, and hope for a happily ever after for the hero and heroine more than I have in any other book I’ve read in a very long time.
We're told she's a pragmatic girl who has dreams of marriage, house, home, and children, but she's turned everyone away because they're not the same as that handsome guy she once talked to for a couple minutes a decade ago about how her quaintly Classical name isn't really cause for eternal shame and contemplated suicide.So in the meantime, she's beaten herself up emotionally about how she'll die the same fat and lonely sow she's always been.

I loved the "on the shelf" heroine who decides to do all the things ladies aren't supposed to do (smoke a cheroot, gamble, attend a duel...), and the scandalous hero who gets caught up in her rule-breaking (until he actually helps her do some of the things on her list). Totally recommended!
Callie was tired of being trapped by society's expectations, and the box she'd been put into, and decided to claim some happiness for herself.
She became the one woman he couldn't resist, and it wasn't hard for me to believe that was the case as I read this story.
The chemistry between Gabriel and Callie felt authentic.
Those love scenes really kept me on the edge as I read.I liked Gabriel a lot.
It wasn't a particularly dark romance (which is my favorite), but it was nuanced and had an intensity between Callie and Gabriel that made it a fairly compelling read.
Spinster on the shelf: Make sure your heroine is never the belle of the ball.
Alternatively, it could involve abduction by the evil dandy, but it's more fun to see the hero and heroine make an ass of themselves.
Also, Regency romances are the perfect illustration of Big Stick in Little Hole syndrome, since the heroine is always a virgin, the man is always well-hung and yet the first time they have sex is magical, with only some minor, fast-vanishing pain.

I love your extravagant name and your beautiful face and your brilliant mind and your ridiculous list and your taste for adventure, which I imagine is very likely going to be the actual cause (view spoiler)[of my death.
It's another winner and delightfully penned by the very talented Ms. MacLean.London, England April 1823Gabriel St. John, Marquess of Ralston and a rake of the highest caliber, is in for a surprise.
Again, beauty lies in the eye of the beholder and I loved to see our hero falling for Callie.
Throughout the story, Ralston's feelings changed and he really saw her as beautiful.
This was absolutely enchanting, lovely, witty, funny, emotional, and a billion similar epithets :) I really loved it <3The style of writing is great, much to my liking, the dialogue is witty and funny, and the characters believable and loveable <3 I only wish Sarah MacLean had more books so I could enjoy her writing some more :)The first chapter had me giggling and squealing all over hahah Callie is trying to hide in the bushes during a ball because her mother forced her to wear the ugliest dress ever made in mankind XD and of course there she meets Ralston <3 It was lovely and funny :) The second chapter is 10 years after that (yes, 10!!).
Seeing her young sister fall in love brings Callie to the realization that she wants more out of life that sitting in the spinster section of the ballroom.
Callie is still working on her list so she is always landing on situations where Gabriel needs to help save her reputation.
I loved the charming story and characters.
The writing pulled me into the story and kept me on the edge of my seat as I watched Callie spread her wings and find the life and love she wanted, while Gabriel fell harder for Callie every time they were together.
once again, don't take my word for it. ;)
(you've always been beautiful, Callie)I don't want to give away too much of the plot, except to say that Callie (with Gabriel's help) goes about breaking some rules and having some daring adventures, falls for Gabriel and wishes that he could love her as much as she loves him, but something in his past stands in his way.
I hope that we see a lot more of Callie and Gabriel (they may be my favorite couple this year) in the next book, Ten Ways to Be Adored When Landing a Lord.
Sometimes you just NEED a book like this, and I was definitely in the mood for some mind candy of the genre!
The hero was totally yummy, and that gets me through.
There was nothing dark or nasty about his rakedom, there was actually something sweet about it.
Eloisa James is my total kryptonite in this area, so the fact she front blurbed it really sold me, and I'm glad I did!
I think this is a first novel, so I'll definitely be picking up the next by the author!
With a heroine Lady Calpurnia Hartwell or Callie being front and center, a wallflower and now a spinster, Callie was a great lead as she made a list to do, something wild , something that breaks her out of the mold she’s been placed in.
It was at times hard to really feel for Gabriel, but as the story goes on you can see how unsure he is about his feelings, finding out he has a sister he didn’t know about and his new found love for Callie.
Enjoyed this one. I do love the books where these Rakes suddenly find themselves "in love". Something they promised they would never do!! I liked that Callie was normal. She wasn't super slim. She wasn't overtly beautiful. She was normal. “Love isn't one-sided and selfish. It is full and generous and life-altering in the best of ways. Love does not destroy, Gabriel.It creates.”   It was a terrifying feeling. And if it was love, he wanted none of it.”

*********************************************************** London 1823Lady Calpurnia Hartwell is the 27 years old spinster sister who always has followed the rules.
I love to think about all these good romance-books I still have to enjoy.
So does Carolyn Morris.***********************************************************9 Rules to Break When Romancing a Duke had it all.Funny, romantic and steaming smexy with a good dialogue, easy to like MC's and a big amusing cast of second characters.
Loved it!The title of this book had me pondering what a "rake" means.
I wonder if the slang word- 'ho' comes from men being called, rakes?Callie is a total rule follower.
Her younger sister is newly engaged and going to live the life that Callie has always dreamed of.
To introduce Julianna into the society properly they will need a society woman to teach her the proper way of doing things.Callie and Gabriel strike a deal that starts with her getting to cross off #1 on her list in exchange for her help in getting Julianna ready to be introduce into society.
Book 1- Gabriel.
Toplumun baskısından dolayı kendini yalnız hissetmesi ve 10 yıldır Gabriel’i hayran hayran uzaktan izlemesi çok hüzünlü ve romantikti.Gabriel ise ufak tefek bocalamalarıyla bile gönlümün efendisi ♥️♥️ Aşık olduğunu geç anlasa bile karşısındakine çok değer verdiğini, kaybetmek istemediğini anlaması bana yetti.
Erkek karakterin gereksiz ezikliği ya da aşkını kabullenmemek için kıza yaptığı eziyetler, kız karakterin gereğinden uzun inadı ya da saçma sapan kıskançlık oyunları yoktu.Historical okumayı seven herkesin kesin okuması gereken, sevmeyenlerin de bir şans vermesini tavsiye ettiğim bir kitap.
Benim için tek kötü yanı, bundan sonra kitap beğenmez oldum.
Onu tek taraflı sürdüremeyecek kadar çok seviyordum.”📚”Ah Callie, ağlama.
Those nine things have nothing to do with ‘romancing a rake’ so the title is a total misnomer.After a promising beginning when the heroine realizes she wants to be passive no more, the book becomes very predictable and it falters in the other two areas (characters and consistency.) The characters are likeable but they are cookie cutter historical romance, people you’ve seen over and over in similar stories: the plain but voluptuous wallflower, the rake, the fortune hunter, the badly dressed Mama, the gorgeous mistress, a couple of beautiful and lively sisters (one of the hero’s, one the heroine’s), etc.
Finally a good new release, a wonderful new author, and a fantastic shy-wallflower-heroine (4.5 stars)Summary"Plain" and spinsterish 28-year-old Lady Calpurnia "Callie" Hartwell is sick of being seen as an old spinster, on-the-shelf, passive, and uninteresting - and thus THE LIST is born.
We also have Gabriel's sister's and Callie's brother's books to look forward to!Similar BooksI'm a big fan of the shy-wallflower-intelligent-plain heroines - I know, unlike almost every other historical romance reader out there ;-).
I love the inside cover of this book!
La lista es una buena manera de engancharnos en la lectura y en el afán de Callie por lograr sus objetivos y qué es lo que le depara cada uno.Gabriel es una buena pareja y la autora crea situaciones de lo más divertidas y otras emocionantes que te hacen pasar páginas como cohetes.El resto de los personajes también tienen su parte tanto Nick, Juliana y Leighton (que aparece en contadas ocasiones) me dejan con ganas para leer su novela correspondiente.En conclusión esta primera novela de la serie ha sido muy buena, demasiado entretenida diría yo, así que voy a por la siguiente.

★★★★★ Five full stars! I loved both the hero and heroine in this one, with the author bringing a depth of character I appreciated. It also had great secondary character development. There are a lot of situations that have been done before in other books, but they are done so much better here, with much better dialogue. I enjoyed doing it as a "buddy read," too. Thanks, ladies of Happily Ever After Café for the great discussion!
***** 5 Muy enamorada del Libertino STARS ***** - Creo que te he amado durante toda mi vida.Los ojos azules de Gabriel brillaron bajo la luz plateada de la luna-Y yo te amaré durante el resto de mi vida emperatriz.  Verdadera y Locamente enamorada de GabrielComencé esta lectura por recomendación y me dijeron que me iba a encantar y a enamorar de Gabriel, Gracias Viri eres una vidente porque así sucedió desde las primeras páginas ya estaba encantada con este libro, me hizo reír, llorar, suspirar

If I am an empress, he is the only man worthy of being my emperor.- Sarah MacLean, Nine Rules to Break When Romancing a RakeWhile reading this book, I have frequently thought that I am reading one of the Historical Romance novels of Julia Quinn.Both of the authors possess the quality to mix humor in a grave situation.
She has found herself in a hopeless situation and done something about it, even if her method is really dangerous.The character of Gabriel is to some extent like the typical rakes of the romance books.He is a good brother.
2012 Reread - I still love this book, I wish I could give it more then 5 stars!2015 Reread - See above, I can't help but love this bookI really loved this book! I loved the idea of the list of forbidden activities, the lovable rake and the unconventional heroine.It all starts when 27 year old spinster Callie hears her younger sister having a romantic liaison with her fiancee at their betrothal dinner and hears herself described as passive.

I loved the idea of the list of forbidden activities, the lovable rake and the unconventional heroine.It all starts when 27 year old spinster Callie hears her younger sister having a romantic liaison with her fiancee at their betrothal dinner and hears herself described as passive.
And who better to kiss then Ralston, the man she has been in love with for 10 years, but who has never noticed her.
The first thing I love about Callie was that she was going to act on her list, she was going to seek out adventure after ten years of waiting for it to come to her.
5 shining stars!!!I think that I wasn't expecting to like this book as much as I did, but it is far and above my absolute favorite book this year.
While Callie is busy trying to discover life, and who she is, (she tries whiskey in a public tavern!), Gabriel is trying to keep tabs on her so that his sister's entrance into the ton isn't compromised.
I bawled like a baby over the heartbreak Callie felt, over the betrayal...and Gabriel was so wonderful.
::sigh::There was a duel at the end of this book.
If I could rate it above 5 stars, I would.
Her younger sister is engaged to be married to a duke , no less, while she’s been put away on the shelf, doomed to be alone and unloved forever.Tired of sitting around the perimeter edges at all the balls, Callie decides to take a more adventurous route in life.
The list includes some of these: To kiss someone--passionately I loved this scene!
*winks* To gamble at a gentleman's clubPossibly one of my favourite scenes in the entire book!
The chemistry between Callie and Ralston is fantastic!I thought Nine Rules to Break was such a brilliant book!
I loved Ralston!
Together, he makes the perfect hero for Callie.Already my fingers are itching for Nick’s story!
Aunque empecé a leer el libro sin tener una expectativa alta, termine adorandolo (Sí esto influyó en mí puntaje). Me ha gustado mucho como ha ido desarrollandose la historia de los dos personajes principales, sus encuentros y sí.. también las partes negativas. Pero ante todo le tome un cariño especial a Calpurnia y su valentía de llevar adelante la lista, realizando lo que en ese tiempo estaba prohibido para las mujeres. Además de que me pegado unas cuantas carcajadas ante distintas situaciones.Qué decir. Me llevo un lindo recuerdo de este libro.
