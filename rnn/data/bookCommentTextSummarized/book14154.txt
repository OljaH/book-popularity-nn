I didn't think I should write a review owing to the fact that more than 1000s of reviews were written as to how awesome this book is but I had to point out and pour my heart out about so many things that I couldn't resist myself.In the present day context, where women are being treated better than in the past, we come across books with female protagonists being entirely SPINELESS, super weak and helpless.But this book, written around 1985, was able to really highlight the fact that women are not effing dumb little birds.
That's why it's surprises me how a book written by MAN in the 80's could make such a beautiful iron hearted woman when these days women writers still write their female characters in a weak vulnerable way.I am not saying all women need be strong or anything like that.

A true masterpiece from the master story teller Sidney Sheldon.
I bet many book lovers would have this one in their favorite list.
Undoubtedly If tomorrow comes is my new favorite of Sheldon.
One thing I loved about Sidney Sheldon is that , he establishes the characters firmly to the story line (that is far different even from the imagination) so that you wouldn’t stop admiring them.
Such are the characters of Tracy Whitney , Jeff Stevens , Ernestine , Cooper , Reynolds, and so on… Perhaps he makes oneself keep betting to guess what’s next exciting thing going to happen in the story.
The novel was adapted into a three-part TV miniseries with the same name in 1986, starring Madolyn Smith and Tom Berenger.تاریخ نخستین خوانش: هفتم ماه ژانویه سال 2002 میلادیعنوان: اگر فردا بيايد؛ نویسنده: سیدنی شلدون؛ مترجم: محمد قصاع؛ مشخصات نشر: تهران، پیکان، 1381، در 466 ص، موضوع: داستانهای نویسندگان آمریکایی قرن 20 ماگر فردا بیاید ماجرای زندگی زنی به اسم تریسی ست که به اشتباه زندانی و آنگاه که آزاد میشود دیگر آن زن ساده نیست، و پایش به دنیای خلاف باز شده است.
ایده های ذهنی تریسی برای دزدیهایش موضوع اصلی داستان اگر فردا بیاید است.
اعتراف اولم اینکه تا همین چندروز پیش سمت سیدنی شلدون نرفته بودم. اعتراف دومم اینکه فکر میکردم باید حداقل برای آشنایی باهاش یه کتاب ازش بخونم تا بفهمم با شنیدن اسمش باید چه حسی داشته باشم و این کتاب رو انتخاب کردم. و اعتراف آخر اینکه حالا که خوندمش، فکر میکنم اگه هیچوقت نمیخوندم هم هیچ اتفاق خاصی نمی افتاد و چیزی رو از دست نمیدادم.طی اکثر صفحات و با خوندن خیلی از جملات، مدام سوال "شوخی میکنی؟" رو از نویسنده میپرسیدم؛ گاهی سر تکون میدادم از سطحی بودن و غیر واقعی بودن خیلی از روایات، گاهی خنده م می
و اعتراف آخر اینکه حالا که خوندمش، فکر میکنم اگه هیچوقت نمیخوندم هم هیچ اتفاق خاصی نمی افتاد و چیزی رو از دست نمیدادم.طی اکثر صفحات و با خوندن خیلی از جملات، مدام سوال "شوخی میکنی؟" رو از نویسنده می‌پرسیدم؛ گاهی سر تکون میدادم از سطحی بودن و غیر واقعی بودن خیلی از روایات، گاهی خنده م میگرفت از خوندن مکالمات ساده و به اصطلاح آبکی کتاب، و گاهی سرمو به دیوار میکوبیدم که بلد نیستم کتابی رو نصفه رها کنم و دارم به خوندنش ادامه میدم!باید بگم تنها نکته ی جالب کتاب برام، خوندن ایده های "تریسی" برای دزدی ها و کلاهبرداری هاش بود، ایده هایی که گاهی برام جذاب میشدن.شاید همه ی این تنفر ناخودآگاهم از این کتاب، برمیگرده به حسم به سوپرمن های تخیلی با قدرت های عجیبشون.
I've seen the miniseries If Tomorrow Comes several times and I have read this book many years ago.
I much prefer how they first met in the miniseries, it feels more like fate than the one in the book.
There are things like that in the book, like more heists, more dialog, and a different ending.
It's just great fun to read this book, well the prison part is not so fun.In Swedish, the title is Tracy's Hämnd, Tracy's revenge, but I kind of prefer the English title since there is a point towards the end when the title get's its explanation.
this is what thief-ish book should be!
I love reading the book with thief characters, but I have never read the book that have A LOT of clever robbering plans.
The robberies are complicated and very-well planned.
I really admire Sheldon of how he can think and create them.
Tracy and Jeff are such intelligent, smart, and sly characters and I love them!
It's that cute!!This book remind me so much of Catspaw by Anne Stuart which the character is also the burglar.
I think if you love Catspaw or thief-ish plot, you might also love this book and vice versa.
من واقعاً بازم بعد شیشسال، دوسش دارم. وختی خوندمش که خیلی کوچیکتر از الآن بودم. کارهای اینجوری رو نمیپسندیدم و همچنانم نمیپسندم. ولی سیدنی شلدون سبک خودشو داره. نه سعی میکنه فاجر بنویسه، نه تکنیکی و نه عامّهپسند. از زندگی مینویسه. آدما. دوستیها. خیانتها. پول. لذّت. قدرت. شهوت. طرز نگاهش بهدنیا واقعاً جالب توجّه ـه. بهخصوص تو اینکتاب. اگر فردا بیاید.. ایناسم چقد با آدم بازی میکنه در تمام صحنههای داستان.. امّا خب، من مثل قدیما دیگه شیفتگی ندارم. خصوصاً که حرکات ژانگولری و غیرمنطقی هم توش کم نبود.

نه سعی می‌کنه فاجر بنویسه، نه تکنیکی و نه عامّه‌پسند.
از زندگی می‌نویسه.
آدما.
دوستی‌ها.

شهوت.
طرز نگاهش به‌دنیا واقعاً جالب توجّه ـه.
به‌خصوص تو این‌کتاب.

ولی نمی‌شه خیلی از تردستی‌های نویسنده هم نادیده گرفت.
و من باید یه‌اعترافی هم بکنم؛ شیش‌سال پیش واقعاً عاشق جف شده بودم.
:)) حالا می‌بینم اصلاً کِیس مناسبی برای زندگی نیست.
For what it is, it's brilliant. I read this book AGES ago, sometime in my teens. It was the first, and the best, of any Sidney Sheldon books I ever read. And though it is not a literary masterpiece, it is great. Revenge, heists, drama, romance, thrills...I still think it would be a box office hit if it was ever made into a Hollywood movie!If you want a light, entertaining, read that will keep you on the edge of your seat and take you back to the 80's, this is your book. Perfect vacation reading!
Captivating and fast-paced.I wish they make a new movie with Jennifer Lawrence playing Tracy.
اولین کتابی که از سیدنی شلدون می خونم فکر کنم ایشون ابتدا سناریو نویس بوده بخاطر همین من با خوندن این رمان خب احساس کردم که سینمایی رمانش و شروع کرده تلفیقی از سناریو و رمان...اگر کسی برای تفنن کتاب بخونه، کتاب های سیدنی شلدون براش معرکه خواهد بود تو این داستان دختری به اسم تریسی ویتنی نقش اصلی رمان بود ، یک دختر ساده و کارمند بانک که یهو و بصورت کاملا اتفاقی تبدیل به تبهکارترین خلافکار دنیا میشه!
It is a story about an ordinary woman who is ruthlessly framed by a mafia, her quest for vengeance towards them and then her struggles for a better life as a con artist.This novel is definitely a thrilling and enjoyable read.
Your mind will be blown away exactly how Tracy Whitney's life is drastically revolutionized in the course of twenty-four (24) hours.
And unexpectedly, after you reached the last page, you would wish for more...:3Another MASTERPIECE from my love, Sidney Sheldon ♥Who run the world?
Tracy Whitney!Beyonce's 'Who run the world' song kept playing inside my head while reading this.
Lovely, idealistic Tracy Whitney is framed into a fifteen year sentence in an escape-proof penitentiary. With dazzling ingenuity she fights back to destroy the untouchable crime lords who put her there. With her intelligence and beauty as her only weapons, Tracy embarks on a series of extraordinary escapades that sweep her across the globe. In an explosive confrontation Tracy meets her equal in irresistible Jeff Stevens, whose past is as colorful as Tracy's. You would love this story, I bet.
Truly an oldie but a goodie! I read this years ago for the very first time & just reread it a few weeks ago. I remember being obsessed with the series that followed ... Madolyn Smith (as Tracy) and Tom Berenger (as Jeff) in the 80s ... OMG!!! I feel OLD!!!I still own the series on VHS (!!!) from all those years ago and recently purchased it on DVD as well. Awesome characters! Great story! Both [the book and the series] are a must for any Sidney Sheldon fan!
There are people I know irl who swear by this. For whom this is the best book they've ever read. I'm just really sorry they haven't ever experienced a Leigh Bardugo level book
OMG!!!I remember reading this book years ago!!!!
This book right here is what opened me up to the thrilling rush of angst, crime and deception!!
When i saw this book laying around, literally covered in dusk, i took it up, read the first page n didnt pick it back up for months!!
and who doesn't love it when a woman gets revenge on people who did her wrong??
Well, Sidney Sheldon's style is not exactly my favorite but I thought it was passable, since it was the first Sheldon novel I read. At 16, I was new to this type of novels. 3 years later I read another book by Sheldon and didn't like it. I realized everything was so smooth, so predictable: the woman and the man were beautiful and successful and nothing went wrong for them. Happy ending for the criminals.In short, there's nothing noticeable, the plots were so boring that the next thing you know is waking up.
UTTER NONSENSESheldon tried to create a plot consisting of a string of unrelated scams pulled by his heroine Tracy White, succeeding in all of them, certainly, this is very difficult to believe by a serious reader.
The main character and heroine, Tracy White working for a man named Gunther, becomes a modern Robin Hood ripping off cardboard characters of unsavory reputations with no logical reason at all, just for the sake of doing.
The so called story goes superbly fast and the scores of situations popping up get solved in a couple of pages one after another with an abuse of twist and turns but there is no plot after all.
I had so much fun reading this, what a ride it has been. The ending made laugh, I have not expected such a clever ending.
Tracy - a pretty, innocent young thing - tries to recover stolen property on the behalf of her mother (who killed herself in shame at letting herself be swindled out of her life savings).
And that's when the fun begins, because the rest of the book is about Tracy's schemes to recover her life, get revenge on the ones who betrayed her, and start her new life as a professional thief.
Lots of fun, several clever schemes, some sex, plenty of intrigue, and MANY people getting what's coming to them.
Nhưng nếu trong sâu thẳm tâm hồn đó vẫn khao khát một cuộc sống trong sạch, bình dị, hạnh phúc cùng với sự quyết tâm vượt qua tội lỗi thì một ngày, ánh sáng cuộc đời sẽ chiếu sáng con đường họ đi.Cuốn tiểu thuyết cuốn hút đến mức khi đã cầm trên tay thì sẽ muốn đọc một mạch tới trang cuối cùng.
Đặc biệt là sự kết hợp tài tình các kiến thức này vào các tình huống của câu truyện để tạo nên những bất ngờ khiến người đọc sững sờ trước các tình huống đó.
I was reminded of Sheldon's books through my "feed" here and thought I must add them!
As I remember, these were the "50 shades" of their time.
Not due to sexual content, even if these is some, but rather the ones you didn't mention reading, or the "guilty pleasures".
Also known as: I read this even though I know it's trash" I'm exaggerating of course, I would never read "50 shades".
But I was quite shocked realizing what amazing average ratings a lot of these books have!
I should read them again.
And I do remember good enough to put this rating ("ok", since it's certainly readable).
I found this book on my mother's book shelf and, already knowing the film, was very interested in also reading the book itself.
The characters were well-developed, the plot was convincing, and the way the protagonist was turned into a criminal had her still left so likeable.I know this book already has hundreds of reviews about how wonderful it is, but I can nothing but support those opinions.
If anyone looks for an interesting new book about a strong female protagonist, I can only recommend it to him.
This book is so worth its read.
از كتاب هاى شديدا مورد علاقه ام در دوران نوجوانى
A lot of bad things happen to Tracy in jail.
I was disappointed with the stupid things she did that landed her in jail.
But after she got out of jail, the book really took off and was enjoyable.
My favorite part was the way Tracy got revenge against mafia guys.
After that I enjoyed watching her plan and pull off con jobs and thefts.The audiobook narrator Nancy LaScala was good in parts, but not good in some ways.
Sometimes her general narration voice was too wooden, not engaging and interesting.
Setting: around 1985 various locations in U.S. and Europe.
Book copyright: 1985.
Setting: fiction.
This would be a good book in itself if it was just about how Tracy extracted her revenge from the mafia, persecutor and judge who worked together to throw her into prison and from her ex-fiancee who refused to help her and left their unborn baby dead.
And the fact that I read this thick book in approximately 24-hour while simultaneously re-watching Shawshank Redemption meant I did not waste time enjoying the style of Sidney Sheldon's writing.Yep, did not like the style of writing.
And Sheldon wrote for television and whatnot before he started writing novels, didn't he?Not to mention that apart from Tracy Whitney, there were no particular characters that I really liked.
I was oblivious to Sidney Sheldon's remarkable intelligence before reading this book.I loved the protagonist's transformation from an innocent naïve woman to a pro-theif. This was such a thrilling novel. Truly a masterpiece.
This is one of Sidney Sheldon's most exciting works; the story of the lovely female protagonist (as usual!), Tracy Whitney who bounces back against all conceivable odds to become a very successful...thief.
Her life is exciting earlier on, even though she only has an average job, and is about to get married to a respectable, comfortable man.
Tracy's successes essentially hinge on the idiocy and fatuity of others including international police who believe she is a one-woman global gang of thieves...how she outwits the museum to garner a prized painting can never happen in real life, and what self-respecting crooks would entrust a multi-million diamond to a homing pigeon???
Have I mentioned that she is fantastically attractive ?
Because she is, as the narrator likes to remind us every time Tracy does anything.
Tracy meets Jeff, who happens to be — guess what?— fantastically attractive.
Here, the plot stops completely to give us every single detail of Jeff's life, because he's a handsome con man so of course he has to be important.The cons are imaginative enough but soon get old, especially as the plot seems to become an endless description of the different schemes Tracy comes up with.
Still, as brainless entertainment this book isn't so bad.
Definitely an enjoyable read, if Tomorrow Comes tells us the story of Tracey Whitney; how her life changed drastically in the course of 24 hours, and how she went from a simple young girl to a diabolical con artist.Spanning over America and Europe, Tracey's life is a memoir worth reading, of love, lust, despair and finally an unshakable will. And it is this strength of character, and her unflinching attitude in the face of life's 'lemons' that endears her to the readers.If not one of Sheldon's best works, it definitely comes close.
