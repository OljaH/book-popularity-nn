I had heard many good things about this book and found it very insightful and an excellent read.
Thus I moved on to another book of his The Spirit Of Catholicism.This was unbelievably good with a unique viewpoint.
If I hadn't read the ebook version I could have saved myself time by just dipping the book in highlighter yellow.
Just such a rich book with much to reflect on.If you want an ebook version of this book you can find it on my blog http://www.splendoroftruth.com/curtje...
Tour de force.
I can see why this is on so many lists of Catholic books to read.
This reads like a standard, although not of beliefs like the Catechism, but as the title plainly says, of the spirit of Catholicism, that is, how and why to live as a disciple of Christ.
This is a book I should buy.Recommended by James Schall in Another Sort of Learning, Bibliography.Included in the "Catholicism Explained/Theology" section of Fr. John McCloskey's 100-book Catholic Lifetime Reading Plan.Listed by Patrick Madrid in the Reading Plan of Search and Rescue in Phase 3 (Advanced).
("superb book for explaining the mystique of Catholicism")
Excellent explanation and exploration of the Catholic faith. Adam is charitable to other faiths without capitulating in matters of doctrine. Very highly recommended.
Definitely not a light read, but so worth every page. It made me inspired and proud to be a Catholic!
Super good read. It moves through grasping a view of Catholic Christianity. It helps the reader to see Catholicity from within, as one should view stained glass windows. I'll be re-reading this soon. A classic for understanding Catholic Christianity.
Excellent resource for apologetics.
It is dated now.
A worthwhile discussion of Catholic faith. It explains what the Church is, and who Catholics are. Great for Catholics looking to grow in the faith and for Protestants wanting to understand Catholics.
