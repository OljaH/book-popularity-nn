It's not bad, but it's not great eitherAll the tales can be found elsewhere; such as the multi-colored fairy books of Andrew Lang. The prose isn't superior. I hope the illustrations (which we kindle folks can't see.) make up for it all. But I doubt it.
The book contains fifteen different children's stories from around the world; each story stands completely on it's own.
Some of the stories were just regurgitated fairy tales that have been told and told in numerous editions by various authors and others were less familiar.
They were decent stories and although they were probably meant for children, adults will certainly enjoy them as well.

This would have been a four-star review, but the stories began to get repetitive in theme in the middle. Finished strong with a story about fairies, though. The edition I have was downloaded free as it's in the public domain. I'd definitely recommend it for anyone who wants to read some folk tales on the cheap.
