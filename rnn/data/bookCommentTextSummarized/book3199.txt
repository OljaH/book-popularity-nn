For those young enough not to remember the show, this is what Perry Mason - the main hero of the series - looks like according to the show named after him:Basically he is the guy a good lawyer should be: he always sticks to his client no matter what, even if the client in question lies to him, or even tries to frame the lawyer (it did happen quite often).
I mentioned about Perry Mason's investigations always being very complicated with a lot of unexpected plot twists; this time is not an exception.
2.5★Perry Mason as a thug.I really didn't like this one much, even making allowances for it only being number 3 in this series.
I didn't like any of the cast other than secondary character Mamie - and that includes Paul Drake and Perry himself!
(Della Street I was neutral on.) All the characters motivations seemed weird and far fetched.I have about half a dozen Perry Masons still to read from various stages of ESG's writing career.
I know there is an improvement - I just hope it is soon!I found ESG's biography on Wikipedia fascinating if anyone is interested about reading more about this complex man.
"You open that door without a search warrant," he said, "and I'll break your Jaw." Perry Mason to two cops who want to search his office. Perry is still in his tough guy bag in the third book of the series. 1934 publication date on this one. No courtroom scenes, no Hamilton Burger, no Lieutenant Tragg. Perry doesn't need a courtroom. He cross examines everyone anyway. and solves the mystery doing it.I love it.
Review to come!
**.This was an early Perry Mason adventure from Gardner in which it was obvious that the author was experimenting with Mason’s persona.
A man swoops into a town and sets about forming a community competition where the girl or woman from the community who has the best set of legs wins a chance to get a screen test.
The plot gets truly confusing as Gardner brings in more and more likely candidates for the murderer – although those among us who are paying attention can guess the right culprit early on.
And when Mason whips out a skeleton key not once but twice to make his way through the locked and unlocked doors of apartment buildings and hotels, I'm glad Gardner included the introduction to the 1950s edition saying, "Yeah, things were a little different in the old days."Also, when young women are determined "beautiful" solely on the basis of their legs, it really illuminates just how far we've come since a peek at an ankle under a full-length skirt was some wild sort of hotcha-cha (not so much the distant past in the 1930s).I love that Perry Mason knows he can lie to the cops so long as he doesn't do it on the witness stand or as accessory to a crime, and I love that he gets a young woman to pretend to chew gum to show she's easy.
Hmm ... tricky one to review. I absolutely loved the first two. This one I found slightly different. It was much more complicated for one thing – but ironically that made it easier to solve. By about half way through I had a very strong hunch as to the murder and it was often confirmed … But it is a Perry Mason, and very enjoyable. I truly hope the next – when I get to it - is a return to form.A fair 3.75
Perry Mason canoutwit the best andleave them wondering,what just happened??Listened with TTSClean withMild Foul Language.
This Perry Mason happens to be the 3rd of the series.
It is almost like its not the same Perry Mason at all!I guess Gardner still hadn't found the rythm or the pattern that his later works reflect.
Still trying to find themselves.What were thankfully same here as in the other books of the series, were Mason's grit, determination and cunning, and his habit to stick his neck all out for his clients.
For the 1st time (at least to my eyes), another private detective was hired to keep a watch on Drake!
I really liked this Perry Mason, in this one Perry really steps over the line on multiple occasions. As always of the period, entertaining and will keep you turning the pages.
That, and the ingenious plots, are why I read Perry Mason.On the whole, the ones written by 1954 are the best.
This one was written in 1935, from Gardner's early "hard boiled" period, and is very good.
The plot thickens as we learn that a young dentist named Dr. Doray is in love with Marjorie Clune, and is also in LA trying to get even with Pollard.
Bradbury is footing the bill, but is an unusal client: he is a strong, assertive, smart personality who says he will stop at nothing to clear Marjorie Clune.
In this novel Perry Mason solves 'The Case of the Lucky Legs' without any courtroom histrionics. This novel being one of the earliest works by the author, the book is without the usual characters of Prosecuting Attorney Hamilton Burger & Lieutenant Tragg. Though I successfully predicted the villain, it is still fun to read how Perry Mason always takes risks to prove his client innocent. AMAZING.
This is either number three or number four of the Perry Mason series.
Not just stretch the interpretation of the law to its limits; but outright smash it to pieces with a sledge hammer if in protecting his client, he has to.And Perry can be rough with both clients and witnesses.
Drake says he is loyal to Mason.
But there are times in the book Mason seems to be having his doubts about Drake.
And Drake sometimes acts like a weasel-in-waiting to turn on Mason.Can't say I'd recommend this book to anyone.
This is the third book in the Perry Mason series, and a significant improvement over its predecessor. The plot is a lot more complicated, and there is a classic mystery puzzle here concerning the precise timing of the events surrounding the murder. Once again, the book is replete with young women who seem out of a Vargas calendar, but that is part of the era in which it was written. A fun read.
This story was a little boring and maybe that's why it took so long for me to finish it.
This was a good one, Perry was given a run for his money.
There is no formal trial on-screen, but the book still ends in a flashy manner.One of my favorite points of this story by the way is how the characters do point out and question Perry's tendency to get too deep in his cases.
It really highlights how nontraditional a lawyer Perry Mason is, and I am glad that the books don't just brush this detail off, and engage with it instead.
Perry even gets incredibly close to the line in this story because of his personality; maybe future books will get him in worse waters.Great read overall.
Went to the library today, and found Perry Mason and the Case of the Lucky Legs: A Radio Dramatization (Audio CD) by Erle Stanley Gardner.After seeing several of you write on Erle Stanley under the name A.A. Somebody, I couldn't find any of those, but found this and we listened to it tonight.
We have all of Season three at our home and this episode above just happen to be in this dramatization.
It stars Jerry Robbins as Perry Mason and the Colonial Radio Players.
Not exactly like Perry shows with Raymond Burr, but it was still entertaining to watch.
I needed a light mystery book to unwind each night before bed. Perry Mason always does that for me. Erle Stanley Gardner has a straightforward, journalistic style of writing that I find restful and enjoyable. Yes, there's always a bloody plot, and is extremely racist/sexist by today's standards (1934), but the chemistry between the ever-efficient Della Street and Perry Mason is refreshing. Only Perry Mason can bribe a bell-hop with a twenty dollar bill! As usual, the plot twists and turns and Mason deftly exposes motive, opportunity and murderer in the last few pages. Easy to read, and always enjoyable.
A classic whodunit story. Fast paced and loaded with all kinds of suspicion. In the end, Mason made reference to a story given by one of the players, however, the only thing the reader knew was that Mason read newspapers, it came across as a cheap shot to keep the reader from all the facts. The story worked, but the author's manipulation of the reader was a distraction. No court room drama in this one.
A fun Perry Mason, in which Perry skirts really close to the edge and almost falls over. As a mystery, it's fairly obvious who the killer is early on, but it's still fun to see Perry run all around and try to stay ahead of the cops. And he never makes it to a courtroom in this one - his client never really gets arrested. One of the Warren Williams Perry Mason films is based on this book.
Great book. Complex plot and brilliant summation at the conclusion of the story. Great book.. Complex plot with a brilliant summation at the conclusion of the story. The best Perry Mason that I have read. So far!
Still early in the series. Gardner is not yet doing his best work.
there was a lot going on in this book. I'm not sure I like it as much as I like the others I've read so far.
without courtroom dram, it's good to read
Not bad mystery.
A Perry Mason mystery with no courtroom drama?
With no dramatic evidence to catch-up the real perpetrator under Perry's cross-examination in the last chapter?
This 1930s entry in the series is more of a detective story.
Perry and Della find the con man's body with a butter knife in his chest.
Interesting - the early Mason is not above tampering with evidence.
Parts of the formula are missing but others are front row centre, such as Paul Drake's detective work, the usual confusing little twists, and Mason's telling us missing details at the end that helped wrap-up the case.
Just as enjoyable as later entries.
My Rating System:* couldn't finish, ** wouldn't recommend, *** would recommend, **** would read again, ***** have read again.
I was struck by the differences between this early Perry Mason adventure and the middle novels I read dozens of as a youth, and the later years TV movies I remembered from the 80's. Perry Mason going to rough someone up like a thug? Paul Drake kind of working against him (a little)? Hmmmmmm . . . A fine work, but definitely not one of the best stories from the canon featuring this wily master of the law.
The 3rd novel down my "journey into time" (started in 2015) to discover old treasures like the Perry Mason Series, is a complete page-turner."The Case Of The Lucky Legs" continues to be a superb whodunnit which leave me ecstatic in this journey.
Perry Mason is referred in this story as a "Risk Taker", more a sleuth than a lawyer, who uses the fold of the legal system to hunt for the truth AND utilizes his devious mind to uncover pure evidence that would solve the case.
