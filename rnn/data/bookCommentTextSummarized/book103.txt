Read for my History and Appreciation of Art II class. I am interested in Art, so whatever I learned from this book I will remember. If you love to read about Art trends and evolution of the modern art and architecture, this is the right book for you. With me being an architect major it helps me some even though this was an elective course/book for my culinary arts major.
