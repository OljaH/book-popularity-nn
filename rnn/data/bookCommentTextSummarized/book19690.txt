I have to say I've heard mixed reviews about this book series, many saying the writing and characters are feeble attempts at creating a good story and whatnot.
Cassandra Clare places twists into the story that you wouldn't have ever thought of no matter how much you ponder, and I very much enjoyed the sarcasm and humour throughout all the books.
All the major events are well woven together in a way where you really don't know what will happen and Cassandra Clare is very creative with her ideas of the several different supernatural races in the story as well as her own principles of Shadowhunters and their world.
🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟5 stelle a tutti e tre i libri della prima trilogia 😍😍Ho adorato il mondo Shadowhunters da subito, e mi pento di non aver iniziato a leggere questi libri prima (colpa della serie TV che fa veramente schifo)😓 Non vedo l'ora di andare avanti 😍😍 #Clary&Jace ❤❤

where to begin with this book?Jace Wayland is supposed to be a hot, snarky bad boy with a heart of gold, and hair of gold.
we're supposed to believe that Clary changed Jace and made him a good person.
this idea is shoved down your throat and paraded through the whole series.but there is never an instance when Jace is more than just a whiny little bitch.he has the air of someone who wears Ed Hardy tee-shirts and purposely messes up their hair and has strategically untied shoelaces, and talks about how hard it is living on the streets when they live in their parents Beverly Hills mansion.
This has got to be one of the most overrated series of all time.I have individual reviews somewhere but safe to say that overall I was pretty underwhelmed.It was all a bit ridiculous and angsty and I just am not a huge fan of supernatural monsters being turned into heart throbs.
This is a book series I would love to live in!
The world that Cassandra Clare has created is one where the reader will find themselves immersed in fantasy and adventure.
Clary, Jace, Isabelle, Alec, Simon, and all the other characters within the series will keep you mesmerized and intrigued.
I know that all series must come to an end eventually, but until then I am anxiously awaiting each page of the books to come.
Cassandra Clare is an amazingly talented author, and I know when I see her name on a book that I am going to fall in love with it.
Too many favorite things...(view spoiler)[I mean, this series has angsty messed-up unworthiness-feeling guys (He totally always blames himself for everything because he believes he destroys those he loves, everything is his fault, etc etc - clearly being brought up by Evil Overlord is bad for you) with deadly combat skills willing to do anything to protect their smart, magically gifted younger sisters who they are madly and mututally in forbidden love with.
Even Evil Overlord fathers aside, the angst Jace and Clary have because they believe they are siblings is like a really really yummy TIRAMISU.
It's surprising to me how prevalent this stuff is in YA literature.I think what really kept me from truly enjoying these books was the writing style.
The author had some great ideas, if not completely original, but the first half of all three books dragged.
I found myself just skimming a lot of the descriptive stuff.
I got tired of reading descriptions of Jace's golden eyes and angel face.
There was decent tension between Clary and Jace, but after the first book, you feel torn between wanting them together and being completely disgusted by the whole incest angle.
I love the way Cassandra Clare writes about her charecters.
I love the passion and fire clare writes with.
I've never been so impressed with a series in my life and believe me i have read MANY.
I love how she brings the Fey, the vamps, the weres, the demons, the wizards, and the mundanes all togetherin a series that has blown my mind.
Anyways I could go on and on about how wonderful this series is.
I have read a lot of other series since and nonecompare, not even a little.
If you have never read this series you are truly missing out.
Much like the aforementioned forms of media the Mortal Instruments trilogy is highly predictable, there are no twists that you won't see coming chapters even books in advance.
At its core the Mortal Instruments trilogy is a love story.
The weight given to these topics is barely felt which in turn makes the reader feeling somewhat empty at the end when all conflicts are wrapped up neatly.
There are many other complaints I had with this series, but in the end I enjoyed the opportunity to turn off my brain and just read the books and enjoy them for what they were.
And now? What am I supposed to do with my life?
Are you looking for adventure, romance, fantasy, and some kick butt action scenes? Well, The Mortal Instruments series by Cassandra Clare has it all. The plot will keep you on your toes, and unable to put the book down. It personally took me a little under three days to finish all currently published books. They aren’t that quick a read, having a few hundred pages each, which most leisurely readers find pleasant. The Mortal Instruments currently has three books in circulation, the fourth of whic
Cassandra is one of the few authors I have cast my rule away for, having started to read her work a short while after City of Ashes, the second of her series was published.
The Mortal Instruments really has a lot of the characteristics I look for in the YA (Young Adult) books I read.
I don’t know about you, but I always like to read the book before the movie, and while doing a little bit of refresher stuff on the official website I found that a movie is in the works.
There are still 2 books left to read but I felt like all the major issues were solved with the 3rd book.
However, and here's where the spoilers come in, I was so uncomfortable with the whole Jace and Clary as brother and sister thing.
Everyone reading the books figures out that they aren't brother and sister pretty early on, but THEY don't know that!!
I felt like this was dragged out for WAY too long.
I will read the next 2 books because now that this particular issue has been resolved I might enjoy them more.
Unlike most readers of Cassandra Clare's THE MORTAL INSTRUMENTS series, I came to the books after reading the prequel INFERNAL DEVICES trilogy.
New York City is so well-wrought that it becomes a character in its own right.
I shared Clary's dislocation and her struggle to orient herself in an unfamiliar land.
The author gives the same careful attention to building her characters.
Also, the twists taken with the Jace-Clary relationship are risky and filled with suspense.
She gives us engaging characters and puts them through hell.
The only reason I took away a star is because as good as this series is, INFERNAL DEVICES is better.
I enjoyed the heck out of this series. Twice. And I have no doubt that at some point I'll read it again. I adore these characters, and am not ashamed to admit that certain parts made me cry all over again. Also, I am a sucker for good vs. evil stories. Plus, the dark humor. It's just a good time.
GOGOGOGOGO!Anyway I'll just review in great depth City of Fallen Angels and then next two after that to make myself happy and you too =)But here is the synopsis for City of Bones, the first in The Mortal Instruments:When fifteen-year-old Clary Fray heads out to the Pandemonium Club in New York City, she hardly expects to witness a murder - much less a murder committed by three teenagers covered with strange tattoos and brandishing bizarre weapons.
Or was he a boy?This is Clary's first meeting with the Shadowhunters, warriors dedicated to ridding the earth of demons.
Too many similes, too much teenage angst (but that's probably why so many teens read it, right?) too many witty repartees in life-threatening situations that don't even begin to help me suspend my disbelief.
And yet I keep reading the series because I'm a glutton for punishment and there's a glimmer of romance.
The second and third books continue to flog the dead horse of Jace + Clary drama and I got bored but I HAD TO KEEP READING in spite of all of that.
I think it also didn't help that I listened to the whole 3 books and listening takes a lot longer than reading.
I think if not for the need to feed and sleep, I could have been finished with the three books in less than three days.
All I can say is that there are three book series that I love (that if God will allow me to live in either one of the stories these are my choices): Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter series, and the Mortal Instruments.If they will make a movie out of this story (which I pray that they won’t) the studio better make it as GOOD as HP and LOTR, because the book doesn’t deserve any less.
è come se tutto quello che già sappia sulla saga, mi venisse cancellato istantaneamente, come se il libro in se, contenesse una sorta di Runa.Non c'è niente, e dico niente, che io non ami di questa Saga, di questa Storia.
Non esiste niente di più bello che vedere come i personaggi crescano, maturino, durante i soli primi 3 libri.
Jace è il cuore di questa saga.
Ho bisogno di un Jace tutto mio!
Per coloro che ancora non avessero letto questa saga, consiglio di rimediare al più presto e catapultarsi nel mondo degli Shadowhunters.
Un mondo meraviglioso, bellissimo ma al contempo pieno di pericoli...
My favorite part is the forbidden love, and how they cant be together but they really want to, it was compelling the first time I read it.
Everyone really wants to know what happens with Jace and ClaryCity of Glass:Oh my gosh she soo could have finished the series with this book, but it is one of those decisions that I am not completely against because I do love the series.
This whole book is just really exciting and when Sebastian and Jace fight your on the edge of your seat the whole time!
The writing of the trilogy vastly improves as you go along, but if you can ignore the flat writing then you can easily get swept up in the almost soap opera-like affect of the interwoven stories of the Shadowhunters and Downworlders.
My main problem is the Clary is often oblivious to what is happening around her, though I feel this is because she is supposed to act as if she were the reader who is new to the world of Shadowhunters, but strangely she sometimes forgets her role.
This makes Clary come off as a naive and ignorant protagonist.
Fun, fun, fun- that is what these books are!
Great for a fun, easy read.
I love fantasy world the author has created of shadowhunters, demons, werewolves and vampires.
I loved the plot twists and bit of romance.
The last book (City of glass), was so exciting and was like a constant stream of climaxes for different aspects of the story- - it was truly hard to put down.
It's one of those "guilty" pleasure kind of books (Twilight is like that for me).
Read this for a great escape from reality!
I liked this series a great deal more than the Twilight books. It had all the action I was hoping for in the vampire books - and a little romance. It was an exciting read clear to the end of the 3rd book. No disappointments. I was frustrated with the relationship between Clary and Jace. Simon grew on me and he became a favorite by the end of The City of Glass.
Loved the story and fell in love with many of the characters. This set made me wish the story would never end. Read the entire set within a week because I couldn't put the books down! Highly recommend!
The story reads as one big book.
Not every character survived to the end of the story.
Added in 2013: I think it's finally that I wrote that in my initial review because I did end up re-reading this set plus I've read all the additional books in the series and the prequel series.
We're reading this set for my book club.
I challenged everyone to see if they've only read the set of 3 before the book club meeting or if they've read all of the series that is available.
Clary, a pesar que en el primero me gusto por ser diferente de alguna manera, después esas diferencias se vuelven en su contra, es demasiado sosa, hace solo lo que a ella se le da la gana, sin pensar apenas en los demás y, cuándo lo hace, es porque hay alguna razón egoísta.
The first time I read through Mortal Instruments, I wanted to skip ahead as much as possible to know what was going on with main character's Clary and Jace but slowly, the whole world Clare has created pulled me in to stay.
His personality shines through in it's complexity.
Brave, brash, and modest, Clary comes in as a fascinating strong female lead in the Mortal Instruments series.
It's complex, expansive, and solid which is a MUST in magical realism.
I want to experience everything Clare has written because I've fallen in love with her well-crafted world, intelligently hilarious characters, and style of expression.
是這樣的，The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones的原著小說我去年已經全套看過了，基本上內容跟看日本動作冒險漫畫沒太大分別，文筆不特出、人物不討喜、「搵戲來做」、劇情一味只有冒險而沒有內涵和深意也不算是死罪，但內文情節而太多東抄西抄的部份，又竟然有出版社厚顏出書，才令人大開眼界。我看得出作者「致敬」的對象包括《哈利波特》(雷同的地方多不勝數…)、《星戰》等，有其他人更數出了《吸血鬼殺手芭菲》等小說和電影電視劇…另外，故事中的獵人對血統不純正的巫師和半人半妖族類的歧視態度、女主角無故擁有比獵人更厲害的神奇力量，又無故得到青梅竹馬的好友和靚仔獵人垂青這種少女懷春式的wish-fulfillment(大家有注意到連女主角的名字跟作者本人的名字幾乎是一樣的嗎?太荒謬了。)，也真是很令人倒胃口。不過，如果你要我在Twilight和The Mortal Instruments中選擇，我還是會選後者。
Ho letteralmente amato questi libri, la saga mi ha appassionato tantissimo. Amo tutti personaggi e non vedo l'ora di continuare per sapere come finirà 😍
Lets keep this short and sweet.Book one:City of Shock!Book two:City of What the FuckBook three:City of Shitsimple and to the point.
Love this world so so much. One of my top 5 fave series ever!!!!!
