And the worst kind of darkness.”And boy was this book dark because all the main characters tried to ignore their feelings and actually hoped they could live without the love of their life.
*lol* This book was so heavy in so many different ways (yes even in the sense of actual weight ;-P) that it took me about 2 ½ months to read it and if I’m entirely honest I still don’t know how I feel about it.
No matter how many days he might let me spend with my Elane, as long as he can spend his with Mare.”I don’t even dare to say it but I think I love her?!
In this story we get Mare (duh), Evangeline, Iris, Cal, and Maven.Mare- I had saw reviews for the previous books stating that they didn't like Mare and that she was annoying and stuff.
I think it was her chapter where there was a Silver duel out on the Harbor that was so intense and one of my favorite scenes from the book.Iris- MY FAVORITE.
His was also a POV I adored, but like Cal's, we only got about 3 chapters from him.
I would be super happy if the book ends like this: Cal is my Silver King.
Wow. This one was bad. It's the kind of bad that makes you set down the book and stare off into the middle distance, and reevaluate the life choices that brought this book into your world.In an effort to channel my undoubtedly unorganized and enraged rant, I will limit my review to the Premise, Mare, the World Building and the Page Count The Premise  I will not be a red queen. Are. You. F*cking. Kidding. Me. What the point then? After four over-hyped and under-edited books our Little Miss Perfec
It's the kind of bad that makes you set down the book and stare off into the middle distance, and reevaluate the life choices that brought this book into your world.In an effort to channel my undoubtedly unorganized and enraged rant, I will limit my review to the Premise, Mare, the World Building and the Page Count
She's not even a good figurehead (like Katniss) and she doesn't really do anything throughout this entire book.Sure she was the first red "discovered" who had powers but there are plenty that are older than her, who've had their powers far longer and are actually important to the plot.This whole book has Mare constantly thrown into these political situations solely because she's the Main Character (TM).
For this wonderful literary journey I must thank Victoria Aveyard – thank you for sharing your characters and world and words.Looking back at what the previous three books built, War Storm is a satisfying conclusion.
It might have been me, it might have been the general writing, but once pages passed by I was able to immerse myself so much better and I re-found the atmosphere I adored in the previous instalments.Another aspect to consider is the fact that War Storm does offer what it promises – war – and this affects the pace, setting a quite tedious rhythm to events, especially when combined with back-and-forth games of politics.
As with every previous book in this series, the Cal-Mare-Maven triangle that no longer resembles a triangle beyond the psychological spectrum is central to the plot.
Actually this dragged on way more than necessary, I thought it was something in me so I asked my reading buddies and they were not enjoying it so much too!The fact that almost nothing important happens till chapter 20 made me consider DNFing this many times, I pushed my way through it but the final result was still complete disappointment!Here is a non-spoilery summary of what this book is like (Skip it if you haven't read King's cage):Maven: Mare and Cal, I love you both and I want to kill you both :DMare: Maven ❤️...
It should have been a trilogy What I did not like: - The whole premise of this series is the inequality between reds and silvers, yet we are not told the history of this.
I enjoyed Evangeline’s POV but it got repetitive after awhile plus they were sometimes irrelevant to the main plot (view spoiler)[ she spent the whole book talking about how she wants to be free from her father but she runs away after she knew her dad was going to be killed, when she actually did not have to run.
(hide spoiler)]- Everything in this book was anticlimactic, including the end.
EDIT 14/09: WE GOT THE TITLE!! 'WAR STORM' sounds so badass tbh.WHEN DID THIS HAPPEN OMFGFOUR BOOKSF-O-U-R BOOKS THIS SERIES IS GOING TO KILL ME
What do you expect from a book called War Storm? Heart-pounding battles? Jaw-dropping showdowns? Mind-boggling alliance shifts? Devastating losses? I know I expected all those things, and some more. Sadly, that was not the case with the last instalment of the Red Queen series. “I will not be a red queen.”  The kingdom of Norta is divided, surrounded by vultures ready to devour her dying body. The forces of the coalition, the unlikely united front of Silver nobles, Red rebels and Newbloods are co
What do you expect from a book called War Storm?
Mare chose a better future for the oppressed, and she is not willing to give it up, even if it means betraying the boy she loves.
I reall wanted to love this book.
I found myself skimming the pages, waiting for the sparkle that would turn my world ablaze, that would made me cheer and scream and clap and live in the story, fight next to the coalition, ravage and burn and destroy, eager for the final confrontation that would steal my breath, but everything, even the ending, was underwhelming.
meh.My thoughts on this book?I knew from the start that I would not enjoy War Storm based on so many flaws I had with the series.
The ending was so disappointing, especially since we had to read four books to get where we are now in the finale.This "War Storm" was nothing more than a light drizzle that lasted for 5 minutes.If you've seen my previous reviews on the Red Queen series, you would know that I lean more on the meh to downright hating the series.
Rise. And rise alone.  Red Queen was the book that fully immersed me into the YA book world. Taking me from an occasional reader to a full-on bookaholic. For that, it will always have a special place in my heart. Let's start with saying this book is monstrous in size compared to its predecessors. But fortunately, it never feels excessive and it doesn't needlessly drag on. This series has been a tumultuous journey and this book is no exception. CharactersMare  She did it. Mare did exactly what I
Honestly, it almost felt like a bit of a regression in terms of his character development.
However, in this book, despite the addition of Maven's POV, rather than further establish or understand his brokenness.
I never cared for Evangeline in the first book, but as the series went on her actually become one of my favorite characters.
But by books end, I think they did have a mutual respect for one another and how similar they really were.
But it also doesn't truly feel like an ending?
It feels like the sort of end that actually marks a beginning.
however i WILL MOST DEFINITELY TALK ABOUT EVERYTHING ELSE THAT I DIDN’T LIKE● unrestrained pining: mare and cal spend the first 40% of the book going off about how they CAN’T be with each other despite the fact that they’re ~~ so in love ~~ because???/??????

Omg, this series has 4 books!!!!! That means (view spoiler)[Maven (hide spoiler)] can be redeem, right? Nahhh... he cannot be bad all 4 books. I still have my hope!
I expected an absolute shitty ending, and was still disappointed.
The story is told from the POVs of Mare, Maven, Cal, Iris, and Evangeline, aaaaaand they more or less feel the same.
There was also a big focus in the plot with whether Evangeline would stop being a puppet and act to create the future she wants with the woman she loves, so it was fun to see how much she has changed since the first book.
I mean this is the fourth book - at this point I want to be so familiar with the characters that they're like old friends I can predict or laugh with.
maybe its the fact that i turned 27 today and im just getting too old and cynical for this type of book or maybe the book/story/writing/plot is to blame.
my old age aside, this left me feeling very… unsatisfied.
i appreciate the effort that went into telling/writing this story, but i felt like this often dragged (which was frustrating because of its length), i wish i would have gotten more cal and maven (did we really even need iris’ perspective??), and i just didnt feel like this was the ending this series (or cal) deserved.
Gonna tag it(view spoiler)[I am gonna say that if you have hope for Maven then dont bother to read this book because it will only hurt you and leave you depressed.The chapters from his view was the saddest.
As a ya book authors should try to portray that people can change nd ppl will say that not everyone changes but Mare spent so much time thinking about and obsessing over Maven that i would have taught she would have accomplished something positive.
And if you were wondering how it ended then Mare kills Maven and she leaves and tells Cal that they need time to heal and not to wait for her.
GUYS. This cover is gorgeous.And I hope this story will be too.Yup, I know you people out there. The previous books weren't the best for me either.But hey, everyone deserves a second chance!DON'T DISAPPOINTMENT ME AVEYARD.
War Storm is the FINAL book in the Red Queen series and I must say I'm a bit disappointed and a little upset right now.
I was really excited for this, I mean it's been one of my favorite series and this is what I get?
Also, I was really disappointed in Maven's POV.
I love the cover and the title but sadly whats inside didn't live up!
But I would never call loving someone else a weakness.
I think living without love at all, any kind of love, is weakness.
And the worst kind of darkness.”
But I'm pretty sure that no matter who you're rooting for (though I don't honestly understand why people care about anyone other than Cal, Mare, Cameron, Gisa or Evangeline) I think that there's something in there for you.
The spoilery bit starts now: (view spoiler)[Just want to start by saying that EVANGELINE TRYING TO GET CAL AND MAVEN BACK TOGETHER IS ACTUALLY MY FAVOURITE THING IN THE UNIVERSE I WANT TO THANK VICTORIA AVEYARD SO MUCH FOR WRITING THIS I WILL READ IT ON REPEAT.
2018...Uhm... WHAT?
If this book doesn't end happy I've got to swear off all series until they're all published and I know for certain if it's worth reading. My heart cannot handle being so invested in characters to have them turn out miserable/sad/or broken! (thanks for nothing Tearling, Hunger Games, and Divergent)CAL BETTER FIGURE HIS SHIT OUT.
4.5 Shame and pride, sorrow and relief  STARS   "The guns will quiet, the smoke will clear, and the soldiers, Red and Silver both, will come home."  Hay muchas cosas negativas que les puedo decir de este libro. Pero si ya han llegado a este punto de la serie, creo que ya no tiene caso mencionar todas aquellas críticas que ya discutimos con anterioridad. Aquí la gran verdad de este libro, la razón por la que le estoy dando las 5 ESTRELLAS, es porque Victoria Aveyard de alguna manera, logro hacer
Pero lo logro, que es más de lo que puedo decir de otras historias, que, aunque quizá sean mejor, nunca han mantenido mi interés.Especialmente en este momento de mi vida en el que estoy tan metida en las novelas gráficas, que regresar a leer una novela me cuesta el doble de trabajo, así que si, solo por eso, War Storm se merece un aplauso de pie.
Hablemos de los personajes:➦MareMare no es un personaje que me fascine, pero si la respeto, desde el primer libro se ha mantenido fiel a sus convicciones, a pesar de amar a Cal y Maven, nunca ha dejado que sus sentimientos por ellos opaquen sus ideales y su búsqueda por la igualdad entre silvers y reds.
(5/16/18) actually started reading the book and it's horrible. (Original rating) There's no reason to drag this into four books. There's probably going to be a book for every character as well....*Sigh* thank god for free ebooks.*I rated this book two years ago. Before you comment that I shouldn't have rated it please understand I don't give a fuck. 🤷🏻♀

I'm glad that there is going to be a fourth book released because if there's more time for Maven redeeming himself, I'm satisfied. I am a hardcore Mareven shipper and I like him a lot more than Cal. (view spoiler)[After reading King's Cage and the part where Mare and Cal were talking about how perhaps a newblood healer could fix the part of Maven's mind that was damaged by Elara, I held onto my hope for Maven redeeming himself. Fingers crossed. (hide spoiler)]Still Team Maven, Victoria, Cal ain't gonna draw me in like Maven can.Don't judge me.My Blog["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>

I sort of jumped off of this series when Aveyard started attacking her own fandom and calling them out for criticising her work. Like—yeah—it’s our fault somehow. I just refer authors like this to my new favourite author on twitter Jay Cole’s response: And how she couldn’t understand how so many people preferred Maven when Mare was “such a strong female character”. Not that she wasn’t the most annoying character that walked planet Earth. But I started this series so I guess I’ll see this book ne

Review #1: 10/21/2015so... there's going to be ANOTHER book in this series???alrighty then...
How did we go from Red Queen to this??When this book first got published, and many of my goodreads friends rated it quite low, a part of me hoped that it wasn't as bad as they said.
We don't even find out what happens to half the characters!!Also (view spoiler)[killing Maven and NOT EVEN SHOWING HIS DEATH SCENE???
(hide spoiler)] That was almost as bad as building up to the war but everyone just talking it out instead of fighting in Breaking Dawn.Kudos to Davidson, Farley and Maven; who were the only reason I bothered finishing this book.
I’m not sure what I think about this. All I know is that it’s 1am and I shed a couple tears, but I’m going to have a think and sleep on it first and maybe change my rating. Full review to come soon. -there’s no law that says i have to ignore all my responsibilities to read this on release date.... but i’m gonna do it anyway
