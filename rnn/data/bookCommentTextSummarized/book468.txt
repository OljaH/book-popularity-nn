Schmitt's idiosyncratic approach is brilliant as always, and in fact very, very few works have more to offer in understanding modern liberal and especially post-modern neoliberal politics from a conservative point of view.
Thus what today is understood by conservatives as the post-modern tyranny of subjectivity, emotional judgement, and non-stop demand for rights (often for constructed minorities) can be explained via Schmitt not as a reaction to a past of romanticism in the West, but as a new romantic fashion of pointless, hollow revolts against the air we breathe, in a society that is totally out of touch with the antagonistic and irrationalistic/existentialistic nature of the political.
even tho I hardly ever agree with him, Schmitt is a brilliant thonker and always a fun read.
Well constructed and argued, but the topic is his most specific that I've encountered. Recommend for those who want to know about how romanticism (really German idealism in philosophy) related to politics in Schmitt's view. Fichte, Schelling, Hegel versus Cortes, Bonald and de Maistre.
A strange polemic against mostly Adam MÃ¼ller - a 19th C german romantic political writer.
