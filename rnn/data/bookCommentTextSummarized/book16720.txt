Gabe can't wait to explore the Great Pyramid with his Uncle Ben, but once he gets inside to search for mummies and treasure, Gabe discovers he may never get out.Uncle Ben woke us up early the next morning and drove to the pyramids outside al-Jizah.
There are several instances where this book reads more an action-adventure in the vein of Indiana Jones rather than a horror novel, thanks to the ever-present sense of exploration and discovery: Once again, the sour smell invaded my nose.
Where most Goosebumps books leave the reader with a chilling sense that monsters may yet be hiding under the bed, The Curse of the Mummy's Tomb reaches a conclusion that's a little too buttoned up.
#5 "What will wake the dead?"Gabe is stuck with his annoying cousin and his uncle in Egypt. His uncle is an archaeologist working on a new chamber inside the Great Pyramid. When Gabe and his cousin go exploring things they learn a terrible secret. But when Gabe gets lost inside the pyramid chambers, things take a dangerous turn. Is the curse of the Mummy real? Is Gabe being pursued by something supernatural?Was okay but it was a little too cloak-and-dagger for me.
Όχι το καλύτερο σημείο για να βρεθεί κάποιος... έλα όμως που ο Γκέιμπ με την ξαφέρφη του τη Σάρι όλο βρίσκονται σε μέρη που δεν θα έπρεπε, ώστε να καταλήξουν ακριβώς εκεί.... Α, και τα κορδόνια των παπουτσιών μπορεί να αποβούν μοιραία κάποιες φορές, και πιο επικίνδυνο το να σταματήσετε να τα δέσετε παρά να ρισκάρετε να περπατήσετε μαζί τους!!!
Both of these unlikable characters are in Egypt - Gabe is on vacation and Sari lives there with her dad, Ben the archeologist.At first, Gabe is really excited to spend time with his cool Uncle Ben. He loves the idea of exploring a new tomb and takes great delight in telling Sari exactly how mummies are made - in gruesome detail.But then things get a little strange.
The Egyptian man - Ahmed - who works for Ben, is convinced that there is a curse on the tomb.
Gabe ends up using it to raise the mummies in the chamber from the dead and they come to his aid.
I really enjoyed this book. I actually learnt things about pyramids and mummies that I didn't know. The book had a lot of suspense in it, which made me happy.
The Curse of the Mummy was the fifth book in the Goosebumps book series.This was an alright story because the concept is very common.
I've seen stories similar like this from various sources.Well, this is how story goes: Gabe Hassard is spending Christmas vacation in Egypt with his parents.
Gabe's parents own a company, so they are in Egypt for business.
However, Gave's Uncle Ben is working at the pyramids and so they take the opportunity to see him.
They visited Uncle Ben in Giza and then the story goes on and a mummy appeared to take them all out.
3.5 out of 5. full review to come!
Αρκετά συνηθισμένο story, εξού και δεν είναι από τα αγαπημένα μου, αφού το βρήκα κάπως μονότονο και προβλέψιμο, σύμφωνα πάντα με τα δικά μου γούστα. Μπορεί να φταίνε οι ήρωες, μπορεί η εξέλιξη της ιστορίας που δεν κρύβει κάποια ιδιαίτερη έκπληξη, ωστόσο δεν μπορώ να μην παραδεχτώ πως διαβάζεται εύκολα και σχετικά ευχάριστα.
Something dead has been here... I remember reading one of these mummy Goosebumps installments when I was a child. I remember that it wasn't the first one, and that's what made me go on the hunt for all of the books in the series, so I could find the first part of it. I'm so sad that I finally found it.Unlike the other titles that I've read so far, this came off as more of a suspensey adventure book rather than a horror one. All of the other novels in the serial have something magical and supern

That's an entire 122 pages of waiting for the scariness to pop up and go "BOO!" So, unfortunately, only two mummies outta five.
Currently rereading my original Goosebumps collectionThis isn't my favourite book in the series so far but I was definitely entertained while reading it.
There are quite a few chuckles to be had in this book and I found myself constantly wondering what was going to happen next.It follows the same Stine formula as the rest of the series (i.e. cliffhangers at the end of every chapter), but that's not a bad thing at all.
My girlfriend and I are expecting a child soon, and I can't wait to read them these books as my parents did with me.
+Annoying story. Haha Meh. Couldn't determine if this a joke?! Hate the characters. Gabe is okay. But the father and daughter team up!? Bah! DUMB WAYS TO SURVIVE. *rollingeyes* 😕
Докато тиквените фенери все още светят и атмосферата на Хелоуин продължава да витае наоколо като призрак, време е и за едно тематично ревю – детски хорър от майстора на жанра, Р. Л. Стайн! Тъкмо навреме, в края на октомври, се появи шестата книга от поредицата „Goosebumps” на изд. „Хермес”, носеща страховитото заглавие „В гробницата на мумията”. Прочцетете ревюто на "Книжни Криле": https://knijnikrile.wordpress.com/201...
His Uncle scares Gabe like the little nerd he is, and his uber annoying cousin Sari shows up as well (Astute readers will notice that Stine simply dropped the "h" from the previous book's Shari for his female character this time around).
Truly destroys any credibility this franchise had.So because they can't hang out in a hotel all day, Gabe and Sari get to go to the pyramid where Uncle Ben (not the rice guy) is excavating some old tombs.
Gabe and Sari are the luckiest twelve year olds alive when their Uncle Ben decides to take them into an Egyptian pyramid dig.
While Uncle Ben is trying to figure out exactly what is going on, Gabe gets separated from his uncle and Sari, and stumbles into a mummy making chamber that has been in use more recently than 4000 years ago.
Gabe saves the day with a magical artefact that he bought at an American garage sale, and no one, including Uncle Ben the scientist, seems to have a problem with this.
I'm willing to handwave it, though, on account of it being a kids' book, and because Stine generally tends to keep things short and sweet, and he was probably trying to wrap things up in a timely manner.Other things worth noting: The story being set in an exotic foreign locale, and the descriptions of the different culture--the way people dress, the food, etc.--should be interesting to most kids, and may be enticing even for reluctant readers.
at the back of the book, depending on what edition you read) may inspire kids to learn more about Ancient Egypt.
And this book may just make your kids think twice about running off on their own the next time you go out of town on vacation.
I'll grant that the writing is not superb by any means and having read R.L. Stine's adult work, I believe the children's writing to be much more enjoyable.
I missed out on a lot by not having read these when they were more relevant to me.This particular book follows Gabe and Sari, two cousins on an Egyptian adventure for their Christmas holidays who get trapped inside the great pyramid whilst being chased and promised mummification by a crazed descendant of the Priestess Khala who will stop at nothing to stop the violation (or lack thereof) of his ancestors tomb and chambers.
I just found out that there is a tv show for Goosebumps!
Just sharing cause I find it amazingSo this is a story about a kid who have a rich parents with/the most cliche catch, they are always busy so he is taken care by his uncle who is somewhat nice and have a really cool job but have a very ANNOYING daughter.
And by annoying I mean really really really annoying that I wished that she dies.
What a bummer!The plot is interesting but it's not that scary and I hated the characters stupidty because it's off the level that I can handle.
The Curse of the Mummy's Tomb was an okay read.
It starts off with Gabe and his family on vacation in Egypt for Christmas break.
While there his parents get called away to a business trip and Gabe stays with his uncle, who works in the pyramid, and his cousin Sari.
The day after his parents live for there trip his uncle takes them to the pyramid, and they learn about the curse of Kahla.The character development in this book was not the best in my opinion.
Sari was a stuck up brat, and her dad let her get away with it.
This one is different from the others I've read so far. First off, though it is a decent enough thriller concerning a crazy madman for the most part. Unlike the other Goosebumps I've read this is hardly "horror" and has only a brief moment of the supernatural in it. It's also the first I've read to give actual useful information about the topic, here being pyramids and the mummifying process. Disappointing ending as well which lacks the cue for creepy twilight zone music.
The one familiar element is the inclusion of a native Egyptian character warning the archaeologist of a deadly curse that would fall upon him if he were to open a sacred tomb.
The immediate difference is that the main characters of the story are two twelve year old cousins who are constantly trying to one-up each other.
In the end though, Gabe and his little mummy hand relic save the day.
Additionally, all of the characters are Egyptian, which is great, but I do wish that Stine had included some Egyptian terms, so that readers could have learned a little about Egyptian culture.
The Egyptian locale of Cairo and the Great Pyramid are used well.
This is one of those Goosebumps books that I never got the chance to read as a kid so I had no idea what to expect from this particular story.
It was neat to see one of the books focus more on the human side of things instead of just putting everything up to a paranormal entity.
I really enjoy the way R.L. Stine plays on the human aspect of fear and the campy quality of the jump scares and cliffhangers at the end of every chapter.
I cannot wait until my children are old enough to read Goosebumps.
This book was a nice surprise, because I actually enjoyed it a lot more than some of the other Goosebumps books.
I’ve been reading a bunch of them as an adult, because I just happen to have them, and most of them have been mediocre at best, and nowhere near as good as I remembered them.This one, though, was a lot of fun, and that might be because I’m already interested in the Ancient Egyptians to begin with.
But the chapters were also longer – as was the book as a whole – and I also liked the way that the twist at the end was sort of not a twist.
Voto: 3,5Ho trovato i personaggi troppo irritanti, con dei comportamenti troppi improbabili, come ad esempio quello dei genitori di Gabe nel primo capitolo. Quale genitore si comporterebbe così?La protagonista l'ho trovata troppo irritante, stupida, fifona e credulona, decisamente troppo abbindolabile. La cugina l'ho trovata troppo stronzetta e fin troppo prima donna.Insomma, mi hanno esasperata un po', rovinandomi di conseguenza il piacere della lettura.
Disappointed there wasn't more about the mummy, which is what I expected. The end was pretty cool though. Wonder if Ahmed was crazy or if there really was a curse? The Summoner worked, so maybe? That is probably what the next book is about. I don't blame Gabe and Sari for always taking off. If I got to go to Egypt I wouldn't want to stay in the hotel either. Uncle Ben wasn't the best adult either. He didn't even try to keep track of them.
I'll admit that I groaned when I saw this was next on the list, but I ended up enjoying it way more than I did as a child! One thing that really baffled me though, was how scared a 12 year old was about being left alone in a hotel with no parental supervision - it's basically every kid's dream!
I’m not even gonna sugar coat it, I hated this story. I have never seen stupider kids in a book in my whole life! I was screaming at them every moment, they were so disobedient and I honestly was rooting for them to die lol Also there was hardly any mummy’s, so yea this was a fail!
J’ai aimé beaucoup cet livre même si je ne suis pas une ado :) c’est facilement de lire et très divertissant ainsi je veux lire plusieurs livres de cette série. Je le recommande pour quelqu’un qui veut apprendre français facilement.
La historia es interesante se desarrolla rápido y es divertido el libro en general. Además hay asesinatos y... ¡Salen momias de verdad!
And the best news of all is that both Gabe and Sari get to accompany him into the tombs.Uncle Ben treats the children to dinner in the hotel lobby.
Uncle Ben introduces this quiet pony-tailed figure as Ahmed, a man from "university" there to serve as a consultant on ancient curses.Uncle Ben turns his attention to his workers and Gabe directs Sari's attention to the dirt inside the pyramid.
He reveals that the dozens of mummies inside the tomb consist mostly of recent violators of Princess Khala's chamber-- and they were mummified alive.Ahmed draws a dagger and makes his way towards the children.
Fun and original take of the mummy mythos by master storytellet R.L. Stine. I dock one star because of Sari, who is a terribly annoying character, but the main protagonist Gabe was likeable - and the villain was chilling!Review in Bulgarian here:http://citadelata.com/%D0%B2-%D0%B3%D...
