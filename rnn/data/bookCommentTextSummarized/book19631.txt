(B) 75% | More than SatisfactoryNotes: New characters are winning and the atmosphere is fun, but the story is too simple and it can't stand on charm alone.
Randomly, (and I say randomly because it’s been sitting in my house for about two years now and since I really don’t like anthologies, had very little desire to even crack the cover) so I spent the extra 15 minutes reading the ultra-short “One Word Answer” before starting Definitely Dead and saved myself some confusion—granted, not major confusion, but enough that had I not read the short story first, I’d have been scratching my head.
Okay, officially they're spoilers, but I'm not going to give away whodunnit, so they're probably spoilers-lite, mm-kay?***spoilers past this point***Here are some important facts:--The new bartender at Fangtasia is a lesbian vampire.--Vampire Bill sucks.--Quinn the weretiger has purple eyes and he’s packing heat (and I'm not talking about a gun).
Somehow Sookie's cousin, who has been turned into a vampire by her lover, the Queen of Louisiana, is murdered, but all this happens before the book starts, leaving me a bit confused.
(Give me Eric's liveliness any day!) One thing I really enjoyed about this book is when Sookie starts meeting some of the vampires who work for the Queen of Louisiana and how they tell her a bit of their history.
And I enjoyed the part where the Queen tells Sookie all about her past and how she became a vampire.
It’s my own fault!At first glimpse Harris’ love interests always seem like a good idea, and the hinting descriptions of Quinn in book #5 had me panting, begging for more.
I mean he sounds like a taller Vin Diesel (ugh, curse you google I did not want to know he was only 5’9”.
Unfortunately once any hot guy in Harris’ books becomes Sookie Stackhouse’s love interest of the moment he not only loses points for intelligence in my eyes, he also gets more page time.
And more page time with Harris usually means gets boring fast.
I am so pleased to see Harris getting back on track! I particularly liked Eric socially assassinating Bill at the hospital! Say goodbye to your dating life, Bill...Yes, I am firmly in the Eric camp.
I'd learned that the Weres were prone to fertility problems, and I assumed that the Pelts had given up on having their own little Were, and had adopted a baby that was at least some kind of shape-shifter, if not their own kind.
Although to be fair most males in Sookie’s world are guilty or sexual assault and/or rape, so maybe she has a point.Least Helpful Response to a Sexual AssaultQuinn’s descent into a massive sulk because he was unable to stop Sookie being kidnapped and once more molested, and instead had to be rescued by her even though it’s embarrassing being rescued by a woman.
My favorite episode is "The Fifth Man in the Fire" which has Sookie thinking her bf is dead, just as her grandmother.
Too many bodies piling up has Tara (who makes cameos in the books, but is not a true comrade as she is on the HBO series) thinking that Sookie is trying to commit suicide by inhaling gas fumes, when in reality all she is doing is cleaning the house her grandmother always kept neat.
Season 2 better be faithful to "Living Dead in Dallas", a strange sequel to a fiery start.
Let me just say, right off the bat, that I had a love/hate relationship with this installment of Sookie's life.
We're steadily learning more and more about Sookie, and her life and love(s), and not all of those things are good.
**Possible spoilers** After a heartbreaking revelation about Bill and the origin of their relationship, Sookie now feels completely betrayed and duped.
It is insanely frustrating to me that this story is told in first person, so we only get Sookie's lopsided and biased view of everyone around her.
Perhaps there are people out there who will disagree with my saying these things about Sookie, and I can understand that.
The range of suspects runs from the Rogue Weres who reject Sookie as a friend of the Pack to the Vampire Queen herself, who could be working through a particularly vulnerable subject—Sookie’s first love, Bill.Whoever it is, they’re definitely dangerous—and Sookie’s life is definitely on the line…My Review: A bump in my rating for this entry in the series because I love Quinn, the weretiger we've just met in the last book, as Sookie's new suitor.
So cool.Hadley, Sookie's cousin, dies the True Death and Sookie now needs to (what a surprise) clean up the loose ends of her worldly estate.
This is a book I've read a couple times in the past and realized I never actually wrote a review for it.
If I'm remembering correctly, this is the Quinn book.
Of course, he's not as hot as Eric Northman, but I did like him more than book Alcide.
I remember enjoying this one, but not enough Eric.
I do like the Queen.
I don't remember too many specifics from this honestly, so this is just a generic review.
After the next couple, they aren't even worth reading anymore, in my view.
Was the imp of hell trying to bring you under his spell? . Since he was a man with a powerful protective urge, he stepped ahead of me, in front of me.So of course, we were attacked from behind. . -Do you like what you see?-You look better than a Happy Meal to a three-year-old.

she got beaten up again like fifty times and somehow she is still alive, probably covered in scars.also Bill is shit.somehow he got worse.stop bringing his dumb ass back
Okay, so I am reading a book a day.
I really need to get a life.
So, I loved Bill, I am now pretty much over Bill--so 5 minutes ago.
Eric can be the biggest ass and still make me swoon.
In this book, we finally find out the secret behind Sookie's allure.

I did not enjoy this book quite as much as the others in the series. I don't like the path that Sookie and Bill's relationship has taken, I don't think she should be so angry. I like Quinn some but even he does not seem to be the guy for Sookie and I hate the habit he has of calling her 'Babe'. The storyline was okay although it just barely touched upon some unanswered questions from previous books. It did leave us with some interesting new people for future books. I still look forward to more in this series.
After the previous book, it was kind of a no-brainer that Quinn would become the next addition to Sookie's growing parade of suitors.
Well into the 100s, we were still getting briefed by Sookie on her past with such and such character.
It's probably a result of the series growing in scope and characters still sticking around, but it was a tad tiresome and resulted in the book not holding my attention as well as the previous ones did.Bill's revelation was raw and painful, and I think Harris did a good job with Sookie's reaction.
Definitely Dead is the sixth book in the Sookie Stackhouse series by popular American author, Charlaine Harris.
As Sookie waits for word she can claim the legacy from her now definitely dead cousin Hadley, she encounters a surfeit of happy couples, including some of her exes, and there are several weddings being planned.
In this instalment, Sookie’s telepathy is put to use to save a life; Sookie has occasion to call a paranormal doctor, aid the Queen of Louisiana, escape from pursuit through a swamp, attend a Royal Vampire Ball, and confess to murder.
The whole set-up is ridiculous, but it is so much fun.No one ever gives Sookie credit for her ideas, but she comes up with more solutions than all of the supposedly ancient vampires put together.
Sookie is getting better at having her ideas acknowledged though.Another positive development—she seems to be developing some female friends, some back-up for when all the men in her life become difficult.
Because let’s face it, lovers come and go, but friends are there through thick and thin.I just hit the jackpot in my local used book store—apparently someone was cleaning off their bookshelf and turned in a whole whack of Sookie books, so I have the next several novels queued up and ready to go.
That said, Southern Vampire Mysteries really is my favorite series of all times.
Quinn is far from my favorite character in the series, he actually goes right in the basket with Tanya and Arlene.
At first I couldn't figure out why, I tought I was just blinded by Eric and my never ending adoration for him, but no, Quinn is obnoxious all by himself.
Apart from that, the book just ties some loose ends from the previous ones.
Nothing new happens, and Eric is not around for the most part.
How irritating is it when you read the next book in a series, and then you realize that the story was dependent upon some short story that came in-between and you didn't read it?? No, I don't want to read the crappy short story that came before this! You're not the boss of me!Plus, Sookie is now getting involved with Quinn, whom she met once and then is thinking about sleeping with him. It's weird. She was a nice girl, virgin, until the age of 26, and now she's sleeping around with every superna
You're not the boss of me!Plus, Sookie is now getting involved with Quinn, whom she met once and then is thinking about sleeping with him.
She was a nice girl, virgin, until the age of 26, and now she's sleeping around with every supernatural being in the state of Louisiana (which is a lot with New Orleans and all).
Sookie gets involved with the court politics of the queen.
Well, thank you for giving us an explanation as to why every single supernatural being is following Sookie around like a lost puppy.
❤ 4 Definitely Dead Stars ❤I thought I would like this book more.
:(I guess I am not very sympathetic to Hadley, Sookie’s cousin and ok it was a nice change of scenery being as this was set in New Orleans.
But I don’t know I just didn’t love it thought that one scene with Quinn..
I did like the interaction that Sookie had with the Vampire Queen.
And I love the Erik came to save the day.
:) But overall still gotta say book 4 is my favorite.*You don't have to like my review but its 100% my opinion, and I am allowed to have it.*
But someone doesn't want her arriving in one piece, and the suspects range from rogue weres to treacherous vampires to Sookie's former lover, Bill Compton.
Can Sookie stay alive long enough to find out what's going on?Series note: Hadley's demise is recounted in the very short novella One Word Answer, but it is not necessary to read it to follow the events in this installment.
In addition to a group of newly turned weres who want to turn her into kibble, Sookie finds a severed corpse in her garden and a rabid vampire in a closet.
You may also remember this book as -- the one in which Sookie gets her period which will probably play a small role in the climax of the book.And I think there's a plot in there somewhere.
And just because a vampire has lived for hundreds and hundreds of years is no reason they should keep on living with Sookie around!Oh yea, and Bill is more horrible than we thought.
Because there's only one reason to keep a human girl around in a vampire book, and that's if she smells and/or tastes extra good.And, oh yea, Bill and Eric both sparkle.(Okay, I made that last part up.)
[Quoted from this book:] “Ask him why he came back to Bon Temps, Sookie,” Eric said very quietly.“Well, old Mr. Compton died, and he wanted to reclaim his …” I couldn’t describe the expression on Bill’s face. My heart began to beat faster. Dread gathered in a knot in my stomach. “Bill?”Eric turned to face away from me, but not before I saw a shade of pity cross his face. Nothing could have scared me more. I might not be able to read a vampire’s mind, but in this case his body language said it a
“Ask him why he came back to Bon Temps, Sookie,” Eric said very quietly.“Well, old Mr. Compton died, and he wanted to reclaim his …” I couldn’t describe the expression on Bill’s face.
Eric was turning away because he didn’t want to watch the knife sliding in.“Sookie, you would find out when you saw the queen …Maybe I could have kept it from you, because you won’t understand … but Eric has taken care of that.” Bill gave Eric’s back a look that could have drilled a hole through Eric’s heart.
And the queen knew I was originally from Bon Temps.
Never come across a book series that makes me hate reading so much until this one.
The book is full of people telling Sookie she's wonderful, special, they love her, no less than three men/vamps/weres/whatever go all macho and protect her, and she's thrilled with that.
The author feels the need to tell the reader every single piece of information about a person's clothing (which if she's female generally ends with the conclusion that Sookie hates her), or life even if they're only in the book for one page or two.
Jason's girlfriend is suffering a miscarriage, so he comes to Sookie and tells her.

What I like about these books is that they are always reliable-- still funny, sexy and an all around good read.
3.5Me ha gustado algo más que el anterior, aunque ha estado lejos de fascinarme como los primeros libros.
Sé que estos libros no son perfectos, pero entretienen y tienen personajes muy buenos..
Todo lo que sucede es una locura y hay momentos muy incoherentes, pero luego hay otros capítulos que te sacan una sonrisa y te hacen desear estar al lado de Sookie.
Quinn, el cambiante tigre (personaje que se nos introduce en el libro anterior), me ha parecido súper encantador.
Si sigue luciéndose como lo ha hecho en este libro, es muy posible que iguale a Eric.No hace falta decir que Bill es un lastre.
I think I may have enjoyed this book the most so far.
Sookie is finally beginning to figure out that she doesn't need a man around to be happy.
Sookie has to go to New Orleans to go through her cousin Hadley's stuff that was left to Sookie after her death.
Quinn is back in this book and I just adore him.
And it took me awhile, but I figured out who was behind the attacks against Sookie.
The author once again introduces many new characters who are all great pieces to the puzzle.
There is alot going on in this book!Jason (Sookie's bother) is experiencing a trying time, Sookie has to help in a missing persons' case with the local police, and, well, lots more...Sookies' cousin Hadley, has passed away and Sookie is named her beneficiary.Sookie is summoned to sort through and collect what she wants of Hadley's personal and financial assets.She goes to New Orleans and meets some very interesting new character's while she's in town to sort through Hadley's things.While Sookie is in New Orleans...many (and I mean many) issue's arise that require her assistance and attention.Sookie makes many discovery's -some that are scary and others that are just heartbreaking- that all seem to intertwine some how.She finds more than tacky clothes in her cousin's house and must deal with a few issue's from her past.Also, she finds out some things in regurad to herself that she didn't even know about!
If you want a little mystery, a lot of supes, drama, cheesy things, and a total love octagon thing then these are your books.
If you haven't already read the previous books in this series *cough*slackers*cough* then you know the drill.
SPOILER ALERT!!!)In this fun installment we find our dear Sookie being sought after by Quin (Oh la la) , politically hijacked by the queen of Louisiana from Eric (Snicker!
Plus I don't want to inadvertently ruin anything for any future readers of the series.
She really needs to work on putting her powers to good use instead of helping the vamps all the time.
I love Amelia's character.
I like Quinn but I think there is something up - the fact he told Sookie Alcidie was behind them getting kidnapped and attacked and everything - yeah right!
Sookie is finally putting her “powers” to good use.
To be honest I don’t know why more people don’t listen to Sookie, she is smart as hell and has some great ideas.
And Bill finally gets part of what he deserves.
How the hell does Sookie always get herself into so much trouble!
