A sort of supplement to "New Revelation". Doyle's overview of and argumentation for what he calls modern Spiritualism, concluding with some particular case studies and, before them, a Spirtualistic method of interpreting the Christian gospels. Interesting to those who are willing to consider the possibility that "nature" is not wholly materialistic.
There is a section at the start of the book about the futility of war. If only this common sense mood had continued. Yet another work of Conan Doyle where all rigour of thought has been banished.
I thought this was going to be a Sherlock Holmes mystery, instead I find that the book is an essay written with passion by Doyle.
The essay is very boring in the beginning and only shows a bit of an edge when Doyle is discussing the psychic phenomenons.
whether he writes Sherlock Holmes mystery or the Lost World or this essay...
the force of his words makes you read on even though you want to just close the book and forget all about it.
His ideas lingers in your mind, making you question things and you do forcefully end up reading the book just to see what all the fuss was about...
Doyle was a brilliant man, which makes it hard to reconcile his passionate belief in spiritualism towards the end of his life with his firm grasp of logic and science as shown in his Holmes stories. This is a rambling, tedious polemic of an essay that was interesting as a perspective on Edwardian spiritualism as a whole and on Doyle as a person, but otherwise is utter garbage.
I had it in my bookshelf, saw how slim the book is and decided I'm going to read it that day...I don't know what to say about this, I wasn't left with any vital message after I read it that's for sure.Although I like to read about paranormal events/studies and while expecting a mistery, thankfully it's short because the essay bored me tremendously.
