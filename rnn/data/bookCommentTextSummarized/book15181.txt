Those wanting more of the same should be pretty happy with the manga, as it follows the anime almost to-the-letter so far, plus there is the certainty of new material that goes beyond where the anime series finished.Ouran High School Host Club is basically reverse-harem shoujo crack at its finest: a normal teenage girl is mistaken for a boy, knocks over an expensive vase by accident and somehow winds up paying off her debt by masquerading as a boy and becoming part of the school's Host Club - where filthy rich pretty boys with too much time on their hands entertain filthy rich pretty girls with too much time on their hands.So the series is about a normal (albiet quite sharp and cynical) girl, who spends her time surrounded by a doting group of various beautiful boys: what's not for a teenage female reader to like?
Read the manga, watch the anime, watch the drama, and die laughing hysterically.LOVE THE HITACHIIN BROTHERS!!!!!! XD
All the characters are just wonderful.I laughed a lot too.
I'm just going to quote it here for my own sake:Tamaki: Eh, what's this?Haruhi: Coffee.
And a strange brand...Haruhi: Not ground - instant.Tamaki: Instant ...
Poor people have NO TIME to GRIND THEIR BEANS!Hunny: I've always wanted to try it!
Let's brew some up!(Girls in background) Commoners folk coffee!
<3 It's how common folk cope!Haruhi: OKAY, I GET THE POINT!
I'll go get the expensive stuff!---Haruhi: Did you like it?Tamaki: Quite!
Lacks taste, but leaves an amazing afterburn!And then when they go on to try instant ramen?
I couldn't stop laughing.
Haruhi is a girl, but she got gum put in her hair so she cut it short, and wears boys clothes.
This wouldn't be terribly important, but one day she stumbles across the school's Host Club.
After reading the description for the series, I knew I would love Ouran High School Host Club.
I read the first volume last night, and kept bothering my girlfriend by giggling while she was trying to work.
He insists that everyone call him the king of the host club (even though no one does), and sulks in the corner if anyone is mean to him (which happens a lot).
so fun!
'Ouran High School Host Club' is one of those manga that I had previously avoided on the basis of its being too flamboyantly shojo--that is, intensely fascinated with lovely bishuonen and the charming sparkles that seem to swirl about them when they're at their most heart-meltingly beautiful.
(For the uninitiated, it is not hard in manga for a character to effortlessly appear to be a member of the opposite sex, even when it's not intended.) Haruhi is the voice of reason amidst all the outrageous absurdity that goes on within the host club, the person that all the anti-bishies like me can relate to when the host club's hijinks reach epic levels of stupid.
I am sure part of it may be that I am not the right demographic for this; the book is part of the Shojo Beat series, which is meant for teen girls.
But for me, the main issue is that this light school comedy is a bit difficult to read and follow.
Two, the plot is light, and to be honest, not handled the best way.
But I think this particular series tries to jam a bit too much in.
While I can see the appeal factors, this is not a series I would continue reading.
Cute, quirky, funny, that's the Ouran High School Host Club for you! Personally, I thought the anime was better; the manga was kinda boring and the artwork wasn't the BEST. But still a good manga, and an awesome anime! Now that I've read through the whole manga, I can definitely tell you that it gets better. The artwork improves significantly, the story builds and the characters develop very well. It's a fantastic manga and remains to be one of my favorites.
How I love these guys
(: At first I was really slow in understanding what was going on, especially since this was my first manga chapter I've ever read(and I've been told the formatting is not suited for beginners in this chapter); however, after ten pages, I got the hang of it!
It's so cool how manga books go from right to left.
I even have a suspicion that manga books are both fun and educational.
Anyways, I decided not to write a full-on review like I do with non-manga books.
I've always been an appreciator of manga artists, it takes a lot of skills to even draw out one person!-The comedy and characters.
It's like talking to the author herself!
I saw the anime series which was very well done so decided to check out the manga. Volume 1 was pretty good so can't wait to check out the next volume in the future. It's about a girl named Haruhi Fujioaka who is mistaken for a guy at a host club and must repay her debt to them after breaking an expensive vase. I read this at http://www.mangareader.net/ouran-high... so def check it out if you'd like to read it.
I watched the show and loved it ( one season?! :'( not cool) so I had to buy the first in the manga series. I just laughed all throughout the book like I did with the show. Amazing satire. I really enjoyed it and I can't wait to get the next in the series. I also can't wait to see if Tamaki and Haruhi ever get together. <3
I loved revisiting this - it was so fun and energetic, just as I remembered! I can't wait to get familiar with the characters and relationships again and finally see how this ends! Haruhi is the best. :)
I find it amazing that I read the last quarter of this when I was brushing my teeth.
Tamaki you are so adorable ❤❤❤❤Also move over Fred and George Weasley...Karou and Hikaru are here 😍😍
Tamaki you are so adorable ❤️❤️❤️❤️Also move over Fred and George Weasley...Karou and Hikaru are here 😍😍
Just like the anime - so cute!!
I have to say that I prefer the art of the anime, but the manga is just as funny. And I kinda have to read the manga anyways, since they pulled the plug so early on the anime and I can’t get enough of Haruhi and Tamaki!!!! (And Hunny too, cause he’s just so adorable!!!! 😍)
I probably would have gotten a bigger laugh out of it if I hadn't known ahead of time that Haruhi was a girl.
I loved how all the girls loved Haruhi and thought she was a guy.
The fact that then Tamaki becomes obsessed with seeing Haruhi as a girl, but at the same time he needs to keep her looking like a guy, so that she can work off the money she owes for the vase.
It was really funny.They authors side notes were really fun to read to, and I loved some of the extras at the end.
This comic is one that I learned about after watching the show and I decided to read the series as well.
Haruhi is an average teenage girl who, after studying very hard, gets into a prestigious private school full of rich people.
I find this series absolutely hilarious.
The main character is having to deal with quite a lot and yet she remains a strong character, though her mother died and she's taken the responsibility of all the chores and shopping.
It's really inspiring in a way and it honestly makes me want to work harder to be more understanding of people, rich or poor, snobby or humble.
YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY!!!!!'Omg I'm FANGIRLING!' say most of the comments on the popular anime of THE OURAN HIGH SCHOOL HOST CLUB.I really enjoyed the anime on YouTube (those of you reading this that have not seen the anime should go check it out.
At first when I started it, it was slightly hard accumulating to the back-to-front Japanese comic book style, and it was my first manga (making it even harder) but you get the hang of it super fast.
Wether it's the manga or the anime series on YouTube, the series will pull you in (even if you won't admit it)
به طرز غیرقابل باوری بد بود. همین :|
Now the question is, will she appreciate it, and will they?As payment for this costly trinket, Haruhi finds herself impressed into service at the Host Club as their dogsbody, and she becomes acquainted with each of the members: Tamaki is the president/king - arrogant, self-centered, incredibly vain and incredibly good looking; Kyoyo, the vice-president, is bespectacled and studious; Kaoru and Hikaru are twins and very devoted to one another; and Hunny and Mori complete the group - Hunny, although 18 looks like a young child, and is often treated as such, with his naps and his bun-bun, and Mori is his long time friend/companion of the heart.
While trying to find a quiet classroom to study in she happens to open the doors to the music room, where she was presented with the appearance of 6 handsome male students that used the room for their club Ouran High School Host Club.
The president soon sees her without glasses and with a few changes to her hair and wardrobe she is quickly added to the host club members.In the first volume they find out that she really is a girl but they decided not to tell anyone because she wanted to work off her debt.Her being a girl changes the way the club members act around her.
Combined with her large glasses and tousled short hair, Haruhi's look causes her to be confused for a boy.Looking for a quiet place to study, Haruhi stumbles upon the Third Music Room, the working place of the Ouran Host Club, a group of six extremely attractive male students (Takashi Morinozuka, called "Mori"; Mitsukuni Haninozuka, called "Hunny"; twins Kaoru and Hikaru Hitachiin; Tamaki Suoh, and Kyoya Ootori) who spend their time charming and entertaining the school's girls for profit.
Even after the truth comes out in the Club, Haruhi continues the charade and is allowed to pay off the rest of her debt working as a host; in order to accomplish this, Haruhi conceals her true identity/gender from the customers and the school.
Ahahahahah!I was recommended this series due to my love of the bizarre, and a love of satire.
Good call, unnamed friend.
Good call.I laughed so hard reading this first book that tears _actually_ streamed down my face.
This first book has done a great job at setting the tone for the series - a massive satire of glamour and glitz that plays the associated tropes straight most of the time - but to extremes.One defining moment for me is when the protagonist is retrieving their lost items from a pond, looking rather bedraggled and put-upon.
Honestly, I just love all the members of the Ouran High School Host Club so darn much! It probably helps that I've already watched the anime and formed attachments to them all. Even if I know exactly how the plot plays out, I don't even care because I love being around this gang.
*4.5 starsI've already binge watched this entire anime on Netflix oops
The first manga I read and also the first anime I watched.I absolutely enjoy it,I fall in love with all the characters, I was laughing so hard that make me cry.
3.5 starsAs a big fan of Ouran High School Host Club, I was excited to read the manga and for the most part I liked it too.This manga isn’t as bright, colorful and vibrant as the anime, which is only natural because animation is dynamic and in color.
I didn’t quite like the art style though.
I’m used volume 1 having not so stellar artwork so it’s fine.The story is very familiar to me but it was great to read it in this media format.My big complain is that we didn’t get the full panel of Haruhi’s first kiss.
It had everything a good manga needs!!So I knew from the beginning that Tamaki love Haruhi.
I think it would be interesting to see Tamaki and how he acts toward Haruhi and Hikaru's relationship(if they had one).
To show how calm she is, let us compare her reaction to Tamaki's.
He tends to mourn by himself when somethng he doesn't like happens to Haruhi.
It is actually quite entertaining.-Every time something bad happens to Haruhi Tamaki mourns.
Or freaks out.-Whenever someone(a guy) gets close to Haruhi Tamaki, Hikaru or Kaoru get jealous-When the entire host club picks someone up and just runs off.
