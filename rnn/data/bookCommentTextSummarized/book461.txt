I'm in no way going to write long about this - stuff has come up that is stealing my attention but I have the memory of a goldfish nowadays and I need to put something down before it all escapes via my sieve-like-mind.I'm not 100% sure how much time the novel as a whole covers - if I had to guess I'd go with 20 years, but that seems long to me.
Finally a sense of when Pilgrimage is set, there was mention of the Boer war earlier but as something which had already happened.Clear HorizonMiriam's journey continues, she attends lectures with friends, visits a friend who has been arrested, and ends a friendship by sending back an insulting letter with the message that she doesn't possess a wastepaper basket.
Must remember to use that one day.Dimple HillNamed after the farm where the book is set, and where Miriam goes for a rest.
The farm is owned by quakers a way of life which attracts Miriam.
There are new characters who quickly become important to Miriam.March MoonlightThe final installment, Miriam's still a young woman, she's faced disappointment and rejection through the series, but this does end on a high note.
Of course she talks lengthily about classical music and how Wagner through your ears makes you see so hugely humanity pouring itself into space.Beethoven worked at his themes washing and rewashing his hands....
FINALLY FINISHED PILGRIMAGE YEAH 'everyone lets u down,' i guess?
Wonderful...lets face it though, if you made it to Volume 4 you really are not going to need any encouragement from me by way of a review...
