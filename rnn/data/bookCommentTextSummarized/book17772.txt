The sea is a fickle witch. She is just as likely to bestow a kiss as to steal the breath from your lips. 3 1/2 stars. I gave myself a bit of a headache trying to rate this book. Parts of it were 2 stars, other parts 4/4.5, so in the end I've settled on this. But I will say one thing: this book is probably not what you are expecting. I hope it can find the right readers.It's really a question of how much patience you have. And how easily you can sit through maritime chapters without falling asle
It's a very slowly-paced book, especially during the first two thirds of the story.
In the present of the story, Nik's near-drowning results in him being saved by a mysterious girl who looks like Anna.
She is the beautiful Annemette and Evie quickly befriends her, feeling drawn towards this stranger who looks so like her friend.
It's not a thrills and romance kind of book - it's a gentle wander through history, class divides and the unwarranted fear of witches.
The occasional third person chapters also slow down the book.
I decided to make my own painted edges. They are not great, but I love them! I used purple to go with the purple in her eyes! Book & Poster BelowA million stars for the cover and the poster I got in one of my book boxes and got laminated! I liked the story! I didn't love it to death as I'm not a big fan of The Little Mermaid. But who cares, it was good enough for now and I'm glad plenty love it üòäHappy Reading! Mel üñ§üê∫üêæ
I wasn‚Äôt sure about this when I first started reading it, but I‚Äôm so glad I carried on! Around the 40pg mark, I became hooked on the plot. It ended up being hard to put down. Very unique take on the classic story of The Little Mermaid. I think people are going to enjoy this one!
You get the back story of a specific day in the past and it goes backwards and forwards in time.As previously mentioned, the build up for me was glorious, it had me second guessing everything, trying to dissect certain things, now I'm not saying that I didn't see some things coming, because I did however in the last few chapters it was just blindside after blindside it was incredible.
It was really interesting to see Evie learn certain things and she always tries to do things to help the people she cares for.
Evie has a tough time with the place she lives and this is where Nik comes in.
I am lying if I say that I didn‚Äôt raise up the bar a bit!üåü I recently read To kill a kingdom and that book was very good, it is getting much attention and for The little mermaid fans, it is actually a very good retelling!
Once again, nothing too special and by that I mean I didn‚Äôt add them to a favorite list or any list in mind, I believe they are the kind that is good but won‚Äôt stick with me for a long time.üåü Summary: There are many Mermaids stories now and they are increasing too.
Sea witch is not the best one of them, but it is a good story if you wait enough.
this was just....not good.reasons why this book did not work for me:-there was no plot up until the last 50ish pages -the characters were flat with zero development-the two male characters were completely interchangeable -the romances were the worst cases of insta love I've ever seen-when the plot finally picked up all the characters became different people out of nowhereoverall this book was just flat out boring
‚ÄúMagic was barter‚Äîthe right words, actions, potions for the right result.‚Äù Well, that was... unexpected.Sea Witch is marketed as a villain origin story, namely the sea witch from The Little Mermaid. Being the weird kid in the murder corner, I eagerly requested on Edelweiss, thinking it'd be a dark and transgressive retelling along the lines of Marissa Meyer's Heartless or Fairest. What I got instead was a quiet, rather literary novel about friendship and social class. The story does largely unf
The story does largely unfold the same way as the original tale: a mermaid saves a prince, then goes on land to try to win his heart in four days.
A human witch called Evelyn narrates the novel, with third-person chapters recounting the past.
Most of the novel has a small-town atmosphere, focusing on Evelyn's struggle with her low birth and her friendship with the prince Nik. There are also lots of insights into Danish history and culture, the country The Little Mermaid originated from.
Sea Witch will appeal to a certain kind of reader, but it failed to hook me in.
‚ô¶  Video Review  ‚ô¶Sea Witch is one of those books that grew on me more and more with every page that I read.I started it with excitement because I love The Little Mermaid and Ursula as a villain but also some hesitation because villain origin stories can be repetitive and unoriginal. But what I got out of Sea Witch was incredibly special!  "I could tell her that it's like the tang of summer wine and the sound of arrival bells as a new ship docks. Like the scent of salt and limes and the tinkle o
‚ô¶Sea Witch is one of those books that grew on me more and more with every page that I read.I started it with excitement because I love The Little Mermaid and Ursula as a villain but also some hesitation because villain origin stories can be repetitive and unoriginal.
As I said, I was impressed by this because I thought it went a different route than one might expect from an origin story like this.
It was thoroughly not what I expected and the beginning had me slowly drowning...but that ending.
Like I went in expecting a sea witch origin story, but we get Evie, who is the actual sweetest Hufflepuff witch...she's a mistrusted outcast, but also BFF with the crown prince.
but apparently a player), and lastly Annamette who is a mermaid turned human and must win Nik's love or pERISH...she also resembles their dead friend Anna who drowned 4 years ago, but Annamette is a mermaid.Like dude, I ship them all with each other though.
That being said, my expectations were very high considering I haven‚Äôt actually read a mermaid book that I loved and The Little Mermaid deserved a retelling nothing short of perfection.
Though Sea Witch didn‚Äôt reach those expectations, I did find myself enjoying this origin story of the infamous Ursula.The overall story itself moved a bit slow and I never really connected with the characters.
To be completely honest, I didn‚Äôt really like the book at all until we got to the last hundred pages because that‚Äôs where everything started to click together.
üòåAll in all, I didn‚Äôt love this book too much but it was definitely a creative retelling of Ursula‚Äôs origins.
Otherwise this would have taken me weeks to get through because I just was not invested in the story plot-wise and it just became too redundant for me until the action started picking up.As far as characters go, they were forgettable at best and that's mainly because we weren't given any real reasons to like them.
The love interests in the story just felt like a filler more than anything else.
I would have been much happier if the book ended the way it was going to before we had one more plot twist thrown our way.Favorite Quotes
Thank you Edelweiss and Katherine Tegen books for sending me a review copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.  "The sea is a fickle witch. She is just as likely to bestow a kiss as to steal the breath from your lips."

Urusla is possibly one of my favorite villains, and finding out that this was a Little Mermaid/Ursula retelling just got me extra excited to get my hands on this book.The start of this book seemed interesting.
There were ofcourse interesting bits in between, but it felt quite dragged.I felt like the excitement showed up after going through 70% of the book.
I guessed a few things while reading, and being right actually made me a bit upset because I really wanted to love the book.
I thought that would be the end of the plot twists, but I was happy to find out that I hadn't guessed them all.
Overall, I really liked this book.
We follow Evie on her journey from girl to young woman, wrapped up in the exploits of her two love interests, as she meets a mysterious young woman by the shore who looks just like her former best friend, and becomes determined to make amends for the past.
If I went in beforehand knowing this, I might have enjoyed it more as generally I do like historical novels, and usually don‚Äôt mind a slower pace if things develop well over time.
I just wish she wasn‚Äôt so infatuated with Iker and Nik. I also found the writing style a little convoluted at times, with too many descriptions that made the story hard to follow easily.
I really liked this! I don't read many retellings anymore, and especially not many about mermaids so I don't have much to compare this to though. It did take me a few chapters to get into - until we actually meet a mermaid. A lot of it did feel predictable, especially considering the title, but it played well with elements from the original Hans Christian Andersen tale and the Disney movie, and overall I did enjoy myself.TW: drowning/near drowning
pre read: wait- you mean a story about my fAVORITE VILLAIN ON THIS EARTH, URSULA? someone find a pen and sign me the fuck uP (pleasepleaseplease let this be everything I'm hoping for rn)aug.19: okay, im here. we‚Äôre about to read this. It sounds extremely soul crushing, so I‚Äôve been delaying this read, but we‚Äôre finally going to do it.post-read: wow. Someone please remind me to never read a retelling of a fairy tale if the ending ends up sad. I never want to deal with this pain again
Anyway..the name Ursula isn‚Äôt actually present in the story, but it is her origin story.At times the story feels soooo slow, while at others it‚Äôs enchanting.
The second I realized what was happening, I had google up and couldn‚Äôt stop.Evie, Nik, and Anna are best friends.
Evie is poor, while Nik is prince and Anna is a baron‚Äôs daughter.
One day, a girl rescues Nik from drowning after he falls off his boat.
It works in this plot up to a certain point.This one could‚Äôve been better, but it was a solid origin story for the sea witch.
Wow this book, I'm trying to form more words to express my love for this book but I'm just at awe that I can't form any at the moment. I highly recommend this one. And I'll most definitely reread it soon.
When I saw that this was Ursula's story before The Little Mermaid, I knew I had to request it (I also ordered a book box with it).
Evie has a hard time after Anna's death, but she finally starts enjoying life again.
Annemette has powerful magic and admits to Evie that she's a mermaid, but not her lost friend, Anna.
These are the parts that we learn more about what happened to Anna and also how Annemette came to land.This story did have the mermaid and magic, but it really focused on friendship, love, and revenge.
Being a fan of retellings and new takes on the stories I love this take on the origins of Ursula was right up my alley.Evie is the daughter of a fisherman but not just any fisherman but the fisherman for the royal family.
Unable to help her best friend distraught Evie gets the boat to shore and begins the search for Nik where she finds him with a mermaid who looks just like Anna.While I did enjoy reading Sea Witch and the authors take on Ursula and The Little Mermaid I did think this one had a few issues.
RATING: 2/5e-ARC provided by Edelweiss in exchange for an honest reviewDNF-ed at 37% :(Ever since her best friend, Anna, died, Evie has been an outcast in her small fishing town.
But when Evie reaches deep into the power of her magic to save her friend‚Äôs humanity‚Äîand her prince‚Äôs heart‚Äîshe discovers, too late, what she‚Äôs bargained away.I detest DNF-ing books but sometimes it is the only way to go.
I didn't care enough to pull through, so I decided to quit.It seems pointless to try to review only a third part of the book.
First I have to mention that this is the most beautiful and mesmerizing cover ever!!! I really loved this, it was just the right book at just the right time and I couldn't seem to put it down!Full review can be found on my blog, here. Blog | Bookstagram | Instagram | Twitter
Buddy Read with the loveliest Hamad.-----------------------------------------DNF @ 39%Thanks to Edelweiss and the publisher for providing an advanced reader's copy of Sea Witch by Sarah Henning.
I found there were little-to-no evolving characters right at this point and if it kept going I could swear there is no evolution in them.
One of the really few things that I actually like was the writing style, I feel like it wrapped around you.
But it wasn't enough to get me into the magic of the actual plot and book.All in all, I wouldn't really recommend this book going with too many expectations, especially if you think you're getting into a Little Mermaid retelling.
So this is from Ursula's POV, but who cares?! Villains are so much more interesting than heroes anyway.. Kidding :P
What a great read! I really enjoyed this.
3.5 Stars. There were parts that were really beautifully written, but they were so good they seemed to highlight how unhappy I was with the parts that dragged on.
Borrowed a copy from my local library!I'm not going to lie, I was left feeling quite disappointed by the end of Sea witch.
But ultimately, the constant switching back and forth between the past and the present day left me confused and a lack of connection with Evie and Anna as characters.
In this novel, the main character Evie is a witch but must hide her true identity, which is tricky since she is friends with Nik, the heir to the throne.
In a twist of fate, a mermaid arrives out of the sea and Evie senses that she needs help.
OMG A VILLAIN ORIGIN STORY ABOUT URSULA!!
**I received an ARC from HarperCollins Canada in exchange for honest review**First things first, Ursula is one of my fave Disney villains so I knew I needed this book in my life!
I am a big fan of morally grey characters and that is one of the reasons I love villain origin stories so much and I thought it was very interesting to see how this normal, level-headed girl could become the villain of the story!
I have a video review up on my Booktube channel for those interested !
"That little witch will be the death of you if you're not careful." First 2/3: 1.5 starsLast 1/3: 4 starsA very, VERY slow start to what is eventually a good book.Sea Witch was not what I was expecting. And chances are it's not what you're expecting either. The synopsis promises an Ursula retelling / origin story / mermaid tale, and it's not wrong. But at the same time it's a rich historical tale, focusing on love, friendship, secrets, the ocean, and some magic. You'll technically get mermaids,
First 2/3: 1.5 starsLast 1/3: 4 starsA very, VERY slow start to what is eventually a good book.Sea Witch was not what I was expecting.
You'll technically get mermaids, but if you are expecting to spend 100% of the book under the sea, you'll be bummed for sure.So, speaking of history I'd argue that one of Sea Witch's strongest attributes is the great job it does with Danish history!
You have the shy prince Nik, the mysterious mermaid Annemette, the playboy Iker, and the outcast witch Evie.
The first 2/3 of Sea Witch is desperately slow.
OMFG, that synopsis!!! I haven't even read the book yet and I can already feel the heartbreak to come. And though I am never a fan of cover/character models, I don't terribly mind this one. I think it fits well. But anyways back to the synopsis, I'm crying already.  ---October 2017 --> May 2018 --> July 2018 Ugh...---Wait, this went from October 2017 to May 2018? OMG why!!!?---While I am happy the title is no longer Heartless (so as not to be confused with the Marissa Meyer book coming out
