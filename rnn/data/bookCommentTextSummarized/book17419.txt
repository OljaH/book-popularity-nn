At first, I thought she was running away with Dune but, given the subsequent events, I think she was just leaving to become a soldier as planned (right?).Then there's some kind of terrorist attack that Roselle gets caught up in, but suddenly she's being snatched up by a hunky soldier and taken to her new life.
We get a lot of filler in the form of Roselle adjusting to her new life as a soldier, shaving her legs (more about that later!) and the developing romance with Hawthorne.â€¢ Characters come and go, never to be seen again.
Does Bartol really think Roselle's worth as a character depended on her hair not being cut?
I picked a good one this time =) ****SOME SPOILERS****This is actually the first book I have read from this author.
I do know she has some other popular books out there that I plan on reading at some point.
This book is about Roselle.
And even though Gabriel would have liked to be in the military so to speak, it's Roselle that has to go and she is fine with this as she has been training since she was a child.
Actually, Hawthorne has been watching Roselle since she was little.
If you read the book you will know what I mean.
The secondborn goes through a Transition, where he or she leaves his family and life to go into a type of job, like being a soldier, nurse, scientist, or if they are lucky, an assistant to a firstborn.Once the secondborn transitions, they are treated as basically servants or slaves, make very little money (most goes to their firstborn sibling or parents), are not allowed to have relationships or children, and in the case of Swords, live communally in barracks.This is about a secondborn named Roselle St. Sismode.
Though none of the characters (especially Roselle) stood out to me there was something about the world that made me want to at least finish this book.Unfortunately, this book did fall flat in some regards.
What mattered was proving to the reader that Roselle was a worthy leader so in the following books the rebellion would make sense.
Unfortunately, I don't think this book did a good job proving Roselle was a leader.
I do want to finish this on a positive so I will say Clifton Salloway was an interesting character.
So I did an audiobook reread of this before starting Traitor Born because when trying to remember all the important details I couldn't for the life of me and I hate going into a book in a series without the previous one fresh on my mind.
I really had a hard time in the beginning getting into the book, it seemed like there were so many different terms, and characters and places and descriptions just thrown at you and it was really difficult to keep up with it all.
Loved it!Secondborn is set in a dystopian world where there are only two tiers of society â€“ the firstborns who rule and the secondborns who serve the firstborns.
The romance was sweet, though it did not dominate the story, which was more focused on Roselle trying to survive being a secondborn and seeking a way to improve the lives of other secondborns.
There are firstborns who want to use her for their political advantage, other firstborns who see her as a threat and wish to kill her.
Then there are the rebels that are trying to destroy the two-tiered society and would love to use Roselle to further their cause.
I had to reread this before I started book two and it was even better the second time.
Secondborn is a dystopian where parents give their second born child to the government.
Our main character Roselle is a second born.
Due to her mother's high ranking, Roselle is a very famous second born.
There is room for expansion on the relationships with Roselle and her brother Gabriel, her boyfriend Hawthorne, boss Clifton, mysterious Winterstrom, and villain agent Crow.
I wish there were more female characters in her story for Roselle to interact with.
Well that and she never takes selfies naked or notâ€¦ All Roselle has ever wanted was to be loved and cherished but it wasnâ€™t in the book of her very powerful and frigid family.
Roselle may have been seen by millions she was utterly lonely.Roselle loves her big bro Gabriel, Firstborn of the family.
Hawthorne has admired Roselle as a fighter for years and when they train with their laser swords everyone wants their toys!The plot has also earned a special mention as itâ€™s filled with twists and turns.
In summary, it read somewhat more like a rough draft of a book than the finished product.
I liked that Roselle was tactical and strong, even if she cried a little much for my taste.THE BAD:The pacing and the characters go together here.
Things were only revealed through dialogue, so although Roselle is narrating, you don't find out she thinks something until she says it to someone else, then puts in a sentence after that she's known this all along.
Just kind of like, two people thrown together and you're pretty sure where things are going, but before you really give a crap or are invested in it at all, declarations and make-outs.
This was a great start to a new Dystopia series and I had a really hard time putting this down.
I am limited to when I can listen and if I had the time, I would have listened straight through to the end.
I'm a fan of this kind of series and I especially love a female warrior.
The unfairness to her situation and all Second Born situations makes you root hard for her to succeed.
I also liked that I couldn't predict what needed to happen for her to cause change.
By the end of this book, I'm still not sure how she is going to succeed.
dnf @20%The main character has a personality of a goldfish.
Select people get all the privileges, and the rest are basically slaves in need of a savior/hero.Naturally, our protagonist is blessed with incredible fighting skills, she is reluctant to fill the hero position, and she doesn't have any choice.Neither, apparently, does she have any choice but to fall madly in lust with the ubiquitous insanely handsome guy.
The technology was pretty intriguing, going easily from futuristic buildings to cyborg dogs to advanced weaponry and flying machines.Overall, I give this 3.5 stars, rounding up for good pacing and genre standards.
14.05I'm putting this back on my TBR until I get a physical copy, I think there's a lot going on and I can't keep up properly.Hopefully I can get around to this sooner rather than later, because what I DID get I'm kind of intrigued!--------
Kindle First book. I was so proud when I saw Amy's book on there!This is a unique dystopian. I liked it, but some parts seemed drawn out. Looking back at other Amy Bartol series, she usually starts out a little slow to build up to the juicy part so I bet book 2 and 3 will be awesome. I will definitely continue the series and I can't wait for the next to come out!
Fast paced.
Bartol takes all of these attributes and weaves them together with a delicious sci-fi/dystopian that produces Roselle, a secondborn child whose life no longer belongs to herself in a world where firstborns are revered.
Conscripted into the military by her ruling mother, Roselle quickly learns that there is a power struggle afoot within the Fates hierarchy and that she just might be one of the pawns at the center of it.
Rather than stand back and allow herself to be used, though, Roselle discovers that, just because she's a secondborn, it doesn't mean she's lost herself or her future.
DNF @50%I have tried repeatedly with this book, returning to it to read a bit more and unfortunately I cannot cope with the slow pace and lack of connection with the MC. I have been bored to this point. I truly am disappointed considering my love of the kricket series. I have decided that rather than continue to labour, DNF it is with a rather heavy heart.
RTC ðŸ˜Š
ETA 4/18/18: Re-read so I could start Traitorborn, now that it's released.
And good thing, too, because I forgot soooo much!
:P****There is just something about a book by Amy A.
Bartol.
I loved her KRICKET series and I'm still hoping there's another book forthcoming, but I may have enjoyed this book even more.
I loved the world -- despite being a dystopian, which I kinda swore off for the longest -- and the characters were so intriguing.
I can't wait to read more, but in the meantime, I'm definitely going to check out her PREMONITION series.
MANY THANKS TO 47NORTH FOR PROVIDING ME WITH THIS REVIEW COPY IN EXCHANGE FOR AN HONEST REVIEWFINAL RATING: 4.25   Now I know that it was only a fantasy. Iâ€™ll never be one of them. Iâ€™ll always be just a secondborn, a shadow, soon to fade from their lives.  Secondborn is a pleasant surprise! When I requested this book on Netgalley, I thought the synopsis sounded great, ratings on Goodreads were high, so what could go wrong, right?Despite the intriguing synopsis, I wasn't expecting much from this
I didn't expect to love this as much as I did.Everything about this book was a huge surprise: the characters, the setting, the world, and of course, the numerous plot and character twist.
You don't even want to know what they do they kids they have after their secondborns - they have it much worse.Anyways, Roselle is being sent to this Sword camp to be trained as a soldier.
It is what secondborns from the Fate of Swords do, they become living weapons to protect the firstborn assholesRoselle wasn't new to fighting.
She's smart, good with weapons, great at combat fighting, also, she's pretty, I think.
Everyone: Roselle no.Roselle: Roselle yes.
Many of the moves or weapons she has in her books are things my second degree black belt children have or are learning.I love that Mrs. Bartol puts a glossary at the end of the book.
I think it helps you get a clear idea of what each new word is.What didn't work for me:Everyone wants/loves/needs Roselle.
That being said, there were many parts of the book that seemed like Mrs. Bartol was telling you vs.
I think Amy Bartol fans would notice the character similarity in our main female heroine to her other books.
World building is a part of every PNR/Fantasy/Dystopian story, personally I tend to get impatient with it especially when a great story is looming in the background.
Due to the brilliance of Amy Bartol I fell head over hills with her world and the story of Secondborn.
I have so many unanswered questions and loved every character introduced to us.
Each character represents a purpose and a future - immediate or further down the road.
I like to savor great reads and Secondborn is no exception.
I can not wait to see what unfolds for Roselle and the MenofSecondbornReykin Hawthorne Crow CliftonGabriel Great job Amy!!
Young Adult Dystopian Science Fiction. Who'd have thought it. I tend to like books that stand on their own. I want to be able to read a series out of order without it mattering. I want resolution. I hate open endings and cliffhangers. There are a few reasons this book should annoy me but it's saved by likeable characters.
It felt a bit like hunger games at times (and I have a feeling the next one really will), but still there was lots of action, good political manipulation, a touch of romance (although seriously everyone is in love with her and we have at least 3 potential love interests - and I see the good & bad of all 3)Okay but first let me address the big white elephant in the room and talk about the general concept.
Our main character Roselle is the second born of the Clarity of Swords (military).
Bartol does a really good job of setting up her dystopian society (though a poor job of explaining why society is that way but I can overlook this miss) and helping us to understand the hierarchy of firstborn, secondborn and (god forbid) third or less born.
This first book in the series should have ended with the major event that happens shortly after the year break.
I'm sorry to give this book only 4 stars but the gap in time just killed the momentum for me and makes all the relationship things that happen after it difficult to believe because I felt like it just skipped ahead and nothing felt genuine.
***** 4.5 Stars *****"Never, ever trust the pack."Although Roselle is from a powerful family, she has no rights because she isn't the firstborn child.
Her mentor trains her from a young age so that she could fight in the military.
When Roselle finally leaves her unloving family for the military, she makes new friends and also new enemies.
Her life gets pulled apart as she captures everyone's attention with her fighting skills and big heart.
This isn't a young adult book.
It's more of a new adult due to the heated sexual tension.
Book 2 here I come!
The story is fast-paced and had several crucial plot twists that I did not see coming but really enjoyed.
Its easy to see why some individuals in this world may choose the paths they do and why some may choose to jump at any opportunity to raise their standings in society.Overall, this is one of my favorite new releases of 2017 to have read.
I have a few theories on where this story is going and will absolutely be continuing this series when the next one is released.
I L.O.V.E.D this book.
It might not be for everyone, but Amy Bartolâ€™s The Premonition series is one of my favorites because of how she writes and she carried her wonderful writing into this book.The story building is so great...
even reading the glossary at the ending shows you how invested and creative Amy is as a writer.
I got major Hunger Games vibes from this book but it was original enough to not make me care.
The other characters are so well thought out and complete the story-line perfectly.I will be reading the second book when itâ€™s out April 2018!
4.5 starsThere are two things wrong with Amy Bartol's books. 1.) They end. 2.) There is a finite amount of them. She always creates such rich worlds and characters, and they always leave you wanting more, more, more. Just be forewarned that you will experience a book hangover immediately after finishing this one. I can't wait for the next book in this series--so excited to see where Roselle's story will lead next!
The story was good enough to stop you from choking on the flaws. I like it enough to read another.Update: The flaws that were bothering me were assuaged in the preview of the third book, available June 2019. If you despise waiting 9 months on a cliffhanger, then wait awhile to start the trilogy.
