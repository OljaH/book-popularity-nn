" Întrucât cărțile și oamenii se schimbau, Serena nu se plictisea niciodată. Alesese slujba ca să întâlnească oameni - nu oamenii croiți din aceeași stofă pe care îi întâlnise în facultate, ci oameni diverși. În privința asta, își atinsese scopul."" Și era neputincios. Cum putea el să explice că hotelul însemna mai mult decât doar beton și piatră pentru el? Fusese primul lucru pe care îl obținuse, prima lui casă după ce îi muriseră părinții. Simboliza independența lui, succesul, moștenirea. Acum nu putea decât să stea deoparte și să aștepte să fie​ aruncat în aer."
Hotel owner and gambler Justin Blade takes a Caribbean cruise after his friend Daniel MacGregor persuades him to take a vacation. Unknown to Justin, Daniel's lovely daughter Serena (whom Justin has never met) is working in the gambling casino on the ship and Daniel hopes the two will meet on board. They do and sparks fly!I loved the scenic locations in this book--a Caribbean cruise, Justin's hotel and casino in Atlantic City. This book also had a little bit of suspense thrown in towards the end. This was a great older Nora Roberts Silhouette Special Edition!
*I gave this audiobook an A- for Angela Dawe's Narration and B for the story at AudioGals*Lovers of Nora Roberts’ traditional contemporary romances will not want to miss the opportunity to listen to Playing the Odds, Book 1 in Ms. Robert’s long running series, The MacGregors, which was originally published in print in the 1980s.
Narrated by Angela Dawe, this tale centers around the theme of “Betting on Love” and is a great representation of why publishers should consider bringing favorite backlist titles to life through the creation of an audiobook with a good narrator.
This was reread and boy, was it fun to revisit these characters. A Nora Roberts classic.
super je; radujem se nastavku :)
Such a lovely book!When Justin is sent to a cruise for a vacation by his partner Daniel- he never kn
Hate the male protagonist, don't you know "no" means "no"? But the girl is slightly better. O well. This is a classic story denoting when a girl says no, she prolly means maybe. Ack.
En múltiples (y lo digo en serio, ni las he contado pero ahí están) ocasiones ella le dice que no.
Parece que las mujeres con un beso y una caricia nos derretimos y no podemos pensar de forma coherente y se nos evapora la voluntad.
A lo último igual sí, pero cuando ni llevan una semana (y dos días sin verse).
De vez en cuando te cola frases que, se supone, están curradas pero que las ha metido con calzador.
Y cuando llega a las escenas de cama hay tantos eufemismos que casi me pierdo y de repente pam!
Zabavna i interesantna, jedna od boljih knjiga Nore Roberts. Iskrena preporuka. 💗 💗
As much as I love Nora Roberts books I prefer her longer ones and the later ones over the category romances. Those are generally too short and not enough developed.That is why I generally liked Playing the Odds, it is good for category romance. The main characters Serena and Justin are likeable and the plot is interesting with a small suspense part. But I would rather read some longer book from Roberts.I've got still some books in this series to read.
Started off good , but went nowhere.... Cliche after cliche... And kidnapping at the end?! Really?! NOT that kind of story... Otherwise - good chemistry between characters, but everything was slow-paced except the insta-love!Procitano na srpskom - zadovoljavajuci prevod...
DNFRe-readI am really questioning myself on how I gave this book a 3 star rating.
But I guess I am reading it after a long time and now times have changed.As soon as I read In some sane portion of her brain she realized he would always take without regard for willingness.It turned me off from the book.
Hated the hero.
He did not understand the meaning of "no" and the author justified that my showing that heroine's "no" was actually an indirect yes.In today's time the hero would have been labelled a stalker and would have been languishing in prison.
This is the second romance novel I had read when I first started reading romances at the age of 14. These books are what got me hooked on romance, Ive read each book about 20 times they never get old to me. The MacGragors are a wonderful timeless family that will always be my number one absolute faorite series of all time.
I loved this story about Serena and Justin even as a re-read. I loved the passion that flared between them and that they were brought together by Serenas matchmaking dad, Daniel. With a bomb threat and kidnapping it became a great book that i struggled to put down. Cannot wait to continue into the series, to find out what happens to the rest of the family. Xxx
I loved the MacGregor series of books. I am reading a little backward. Read about the grandchildren and now reading g a out the children. But I love th e patriarch in the book so I keep reading them.
Mi-a placut cartea, dar parca prea repede s-a sfarsit...Recenzia mea o găsiți aici: https://justreadingmybooks.wordpress....
Jednostavno obožavam Noru.. pogoovo ovakve njezine knjige gdje nema paranormale
LOVELY LOVELY STORY even so the second time around. I love Serena and Justin Blade. :D Blade is gorgeous and well hot. Serena is just such an awesome heroine. I love the MacGregors... :D
İlk beyaz dizi, ilk Nora Roberts!...Mükemmeldi, kısaydı ama mükemmeldii...
"People in love belong together." - Serena MacGregorAfter having read my fair share of NR's trilogies and series so far, I figured it was about time I returned to one of her most famous ones.
The use of gambling terms throughout the book puts a nice touch to it, and fits the way Serena and Justin live their lives, business attributes or not.
Things like that need time to settle, I believe.I don't know how the rest of the series will progress, save for Caine's story, but I suspect Daniel is bound to be my favorite character in all of it.
I just didn't feel any chemistry and didn't really care that much. Plus some of the lines didn't sit well with me such as her always saying how the male love interest would take despite willingness since he doesn't take no for an answer. That isn't something in interested in a man.

Well, what to say? It was okay.This is the 3rd contemporary romance novel I read in my whole life and, I hope, the last one. It is the 1st that Ive picked knowing its contemporary romance. One of my Goodreads groups voted for this one as a book at the month and it won. I was sure that Ill not read it, but since some people said Im narrow-minded for not reading "outside my genre" (which I do not have), I gave it a try. Unfortunately.Most of the time, I just thought its too long for ... the "novel
It was okay.This is the 3rd contemporary romance novel I read in my whole life and, I hope, the last one.
It is the 1st that I´ve picked knowing it´s contemporary romance.
I was sure that I´ll not read it, but since some people said I´m narrow-minded for not reading "outside my genre" (which I do not have), I gave it a try.
The book just went on and on and then the author thought it might be wise to include the bomb and enemies, so our characters could have some dramatic conversations and blabla and I got bored.

Eğer buda zevkime hitap etmezse Nora Roberts defterini ebediyete kadar kapatıyorum.Okumadan sonraki tepkim;Sanırım bu yazarın hiç bir zaman sırf aşk yazdığını göremeyeceğim.
Tarzı böyle tabii ama ben yazarı o kadarda zevkle okuyan biri değilim.
Bu kitabı diğer okuduklarıma göre bir nebze daha aşk önde olanlarındandı.
Özellikle kızın babasının olduğu sahneler evlere şenlikti ama kitabı karakterleri dışında sevemedim o kadarda.
Sanki duruma oturmadığını veyahut pot durduğunu düşünüyorum.Konumuza gelirsek Serena MacGregor o kadar gördüğü eğitimde sonra bir cruz gemisinde çalışıp insanları tanımak istiyordur.
Zira Serena'nın son yolculuğuna katılması için genç bir arkadaşını kandırır.
Justin ile Serena kumarhanede ilk karşılaştıklarında bir çekim oluşmuştur.
I don't think I've ever put a Roberts book down unfinished. This book was not what I expected from her, though, & I have better things to do with my time than finish this drivel. First & foremost, the domineering "take what I want" male protagonist and the simpering, loving it female protagonist are dated & offensive. Yes, I know Serena considers herself strong & independent, but her actions prove otherwise. Add in a dearth of character development & a very thin plot, & you've just lost me as a reader.
I stumbled abroad the MacGregor books in the basement and I'm giving them a reread. While some of the elements mark the book as from another era (Justin's heavy handed approach to pursuing Serena for one) the hallmarks of what makes Nora Roberts the pillar of American romance are present. Fun, if a but outdated.
Probably somewhere around 3.5 stars.Definitely a little dated and I had some minor pursuit issues that can mostly be attributed to the fact that this was written in 1985, but it was overall a pretty fun read once I got into it. I started this in August but didn't really get into it past the first 30 pages until this week.
A Great Read!!I enjoyed this book very much. I loved the characters and their families. I recommend it to all. I can't wait to get started on the next one in this series. Nora rarely disappoints me.
I love that Nora Roberts never writes about a female character who isn't strong and feisty. I love the passionate nature of the characters and how they always seem to argue. It makes them more realistic
LameCheesy, ridiculous. Least favorite Nora Roberts I've ever read. I skipped ahead to finish it...I never do that. Pretty terrible.
