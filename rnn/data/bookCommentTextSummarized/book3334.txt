First written in 1928, this is a good read with a nice little plot involving the highest and the lowest of Harlem Black society (and it is plenty aware of class distinctions, fascinatingly so), plenty of social commentary incidental to the story which is just how I like it, and some great dialogue. I really loved the tongue in cheek glossary at the back, I'd start with boogy.
