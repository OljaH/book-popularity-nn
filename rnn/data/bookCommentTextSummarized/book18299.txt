First of all, I think it's obvious that I absolutely loved it!
But there were also really beautiful, tender moments between Daemon & Katy.
*sigh* I absolutely love me some Daemon Black.
And I absolutely loved every single page of this book!
Jennifer- you are a freakin' genius (kind of evil.....), but still a literary genius!
There you go."**DIES**UPDATE: IT HAS A TITLE!!!DOUBLE UPDATE: I just finished Opal and I all I can think is this: "NEED ORIGIN....
NEED ORIGIN....
NEED ORIGIN....
REALLY NEED ORIGIN....."TRIPLE UPDATE: It has a release date!
AND I REALLY *NEED* THIS BOOK, LIKE, RIGHT NOW!!!!!!!!
Warning: this contains foul language and also tiny spoilers!!! For those of you who don't know what this book is about: this book is about rubbing and also groping.There were literally 3 chapter about them (ahem) enjoying each-other! 3 CHAPTERS noting happened except them lying in bed! and then there were 2 more of them walking through Vegas and thinking about FEELINGS.There might have been some descent action scenes somewhere around the end, but I was so fed up of this book by then, i skip-re
and then there were 2 more of them walking through Vegas and thinking about FEELINGS.There might have been some descent action scenes somewhere around the end, but I was so fed up of this book by then, i skip-read through most of them.The thing is, this series starts off well.
This would have been decent enough series if it was only 3 books.Third the so-called LOVE they feel for each-other its noting more then hormones and hornyness (that's not a word - i don't care).
(hide spoiler)]And this Book is the result.I read through all of this book waiting for the love i felt for its predecessors to come back.

5 FULLY FREAKING STARS!!!I was so thrilled to read this one because we waited a lot for this one.And when I got it in my heads I couldn't leave it.It was such a cool book and the ending was mind blowing, that great. Me while reading the book : “As close as you’re riding me, man, I feel like I need to take you out to dinner or something. At least, I should get your name.” He punched in a floor number, smirking.“People call me Archer.”[image error]“Oh shit. ET just phoned home.” “Me and Katy look

“As close as you’re riding me, man, I feel like I need to take you out to dinner or something.
At least, I should get your name.” He punched in a floor number, smirking.“People call me Archer.”[image error]“Oh shit.
ET just phoned home.” “Me and Katy look adorkable in extraterrestrialhighway shirts.
You would just look stupid.
Amazing book.Highly recommended.
It’s always after the fact, when it’s too late, that you realize what you should’ve said or done.”“I want a years-worth of seconds and minutes with you.
Jennifer Armentrout is…a big fucking deal.You know it.I know it.This woman has a manic talent with words! And plot twists. And dialogue. And skyscraper-sized cliff-hangers. And heart-splintering moments. And her characters… LAWD! Her characters…***Daemon Black is everything that has ever been my favorite thing.***And she does all of this is such an effortless way. It’s almost like she’s having a conversation with each and every one of her readers when she writes a book. Because she makes sure
And her characters… LAWD!
Her characters…***Daemon Black is everything that has ever been my favorite thing.***And she does all of this is such an effortless way.
It’s almost like she’s having a conversation with each and every one of her readers when she writes a book.
Because she makes sure you’re a part of everything she writes.
And I get that that’s what every author tries to do… The difference is that Jennifer actually does it.And she does it fucking well.
Random Tidbits.Pine needles must hurt like a bitch.Blake isn’t wall-resistant.Someone gets married.Creepy-ass ten-year-olds.We find out what Luc really is.
Full of action, Origin is the best part in series so far!My Daemon:My Katy:I loved dual POV.
In this book, Daemon is in his best confident-self.
I absolutely loved how badass Daemon was in this instalment, he is definitely one of my all time favourite bookish heroes, if not the best!I was shocked and speecheles once I found out what "origin" truly means.
I could not put it down, Origin was pure perfection.And Katy's and Daemon's relationship?
I wish I had final instalment already!***********************************************************My pre-review after reading Opal:I HAVE NEVER EVER WANTED ANY BOOK SO MUCH AS I WANT THIS ONE.
I NEED TO KNOW WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO DAEMON AND KATY!!!
"I will also confirm this: The last two books in the series that are currently untitled are in dual POVs (Daemon and Katy). There you go." - Jennifer L. ArmentroutAHHHHHH, YIPPIIIIIIiiiiiiiii !!!!!!!!!!i can't breath..
OMGosh!!!!!!!I am so in love with this series - this book in particular. I feel so many emotions for it right now. This story world just keeps getting better and better, and I keep loving Daemon and Katy more and more. So amazingly awesome. Jen's writing is spectacular. So much yum.Oh, and don't get me started on how cool it is to have a literary reference to my book in this novel!!!!! How freaking surreal is that??? EEEK!!!I give this book off-the-charts stars. Can't wait to see what Jen has in store for us next. :-)
EDIT: The story finally progresses and there's something different happening. The last book seemed pointless but this does not. Can't wait for the end " There are two more books after Opal and like I said on release day, those two books (yet untitled) will be in dual POVs-- Daemon and Katy. " OFFICIALLY FROM JEN'S BLOG LINK: http://jenniferarmentrout.blogspot.in...DID I READ DUAL POV?That means there are going to be scenes from Daemon's POV!DAEMON'S POV The Third book hasn't even come out yet but I'm dying to read this...
Oh fudgemonkeys,I feel like I just read a combination of X-Men,Star Wars and Richelle Mead's Bloodlines with a hint of dystopia (experiments on humans and all) and scorching romance!Yet Jennifer L. Armentrout created something unique and utterly hers.The woman is brilliant!Brilliant.   “I'd take out an army,burn down an entire city,and throw the world into chaos if I had to in order to keep Kat out of that place.”  And he did it.If you hurt Kat,you hurt Daemon,not because of their bond but due t
“I'd take out an army,burn down an entire city,and throw the world into chaos if I had to in order to keep Kat out of that place.”
And he did it.If you hurt Kat,you hurt Daemon,not because of their bond but due to his devasting,wonderful and all-consuming love for her.Surrender to the enemy?Done.Participate in horrible experiments?Done.Cause mayhem?Done.Turn your back to your own kind?Done.And he didn't stop there.
EDITFirst things first.1. We have a cover and a synopsis (don't know how I feel about the cover, though)2. "... which side will Daemon and Katy be standing on? And will they even be together?"WHAT. THE. WHATI seriously hope that doesn't mean what I think I means, Mrs. Armentrout. I don't know if my heart can survive a cliffhanger just like Opal's. END OF EDITUPDATEYou can't seriously expect me to live without even a synopsis after that cliffhanger.Reaction when I saw this: Just like that.
3.5 stars
“There’s only one thing I want.”“And that is?”“I want to see Kat.”“And what are you willing to do to accomplish that?”“Anything,” I said without hesitation, and I meant it. “I will do anything, but I want to see Kat first, and I want to see her now.”   OKAY, OKAY, OKAY! Picking it up this series again after so much time was an INCREDIBLE DECISION that I am so happy that I made. ♥ (me the entire time reading this book).This book was everything I was hoping for and more. The action, the writing,
The action, the writing, the flawed real awesome strong characters (who I love so much) and the story is just so GOOD!
They are all in they one way unique and badass.And I have a feeling of a new couple rising and I couldn’t be more excited to see it happening.I can’t wait to read the final book and have my heart melt of happiness because of my babies, but at the same time I’m so sad that is going to end!
5 I wanna make some alien babies with Daemon stars!!!  After the crazy cliffhanger in Opal, we’ve all been (not so) patiently waiting to find out what happens with Daemon and Katy... one of my favorite fictional couples! I’ve been anxious to see how this one would turn out... if it would stack up to the rest of the series. It did! Amazing! Daemon Black is on a mission to save the woman he loves and nothing and no one can stop him. He will do ANYTHING he has to do to be with Kat.  “There's only o
After the crazy cliffhanger in Opal, we’ve all been (not so) patiently waiting to find out what happens with Daemon and Katy...
Daemon Black is on a mission to save the woman he loves and nothing and no one can stop him.
It’s one of those books you want to be shocked while reading.
I just love Daemon Black more than ever!!!
No one else can have me swoon, get me hot and bothered, and have me laughing my ass off all at the same time like Daemon!
This was just as wonderful as the first three books in the series!
Damn.This was SO.DAMN.GOOD!!And I my nerves almost killed me, and I don’t know how it will possibly go from here, and I’m really afraid of what will happen with the next book because of its title and (view spoiler)[after that end and that strange “Luxen calling” I think Daemon and Katy will be in opposite sides of the war (hide spoiler)] and yeah… I’m rambling.
(I’m really not that sorry!)Okay, this picks up right after that horrible CH in the third book, with Katy stuck God knows where with the Deadalus and Daemon turning everything and everyone around trying to save her.
Reviewed By Inna @ Inna's Little BookshelvesSo I basically had an aneurysm while waiting for this book to come out.
I mean come on we got to be in Daemon's Black head, that itself could have made the book a winner for me.
Armentrout did not stop there she gave us amazing, tender moments between the perfect, sexy, dirty mouthed, sweetheart Daemon and Katy, she raised the stakes, she introduced some amazing new characters, Archer I'm looking at you, and she killed a lot of people.
THIS CANNOT BE HAPPENING I JUST WANT MY BOOK AND ALL THE TEASERS?
I need Daemon I mean come on dual point of view?!?!
Okay, we got everything we usually want by the third book: -villain dead-Katy+Daemon did..."something" we were dying for-Dawson and Beth back together-Dee talking to Katy again-Daemon said something we were dying to hear in english(anyone else feel like he told Katy he loved her in his language?)But Daemon, too little too late, don't you think, buddy?UPDATE-24/04/13Ffffing shit!
--> meant to be in caps lock but my keyboard thought otherwise ;)This is serious torture...I don't like Daemon to be all alone on the cover but he looks so determined to get Katy!!
Watch out Katy, Daemon's coming to get you!UPDATE - REVIEW AFTER READINGOkay, it’s no secret that I was dying for this book to come out.
Rounding down to 3.5 stars because of the end.This is me at the end of Origin... That was such a stupid way to end the book. For some of the readers it was a 'cliffhanger', but in my opinion it was (like i said) stupid and therefore i didn't like it. So i was like...   And I’m not going to let you do this by yourself You’re my – everything, Kat Origin starts off with a very pissed, sad, and heartbroken Daemon. Right were we left off in Opal (view spoiler)[where Kat gets captured by the Daedalus
(hide spoiler)]So obviously Daemon goes and rescues her (by doing a very reckless and not though-out thing that i didn't really approve of.
Let me start by saying why i didn't give Origin 5 stars.One of my biggest issues was probably not liking at all where the book was going.
(view spoiler)[Who else is gonna get pregnant except either Beth and Katy?
That screamed 'Katy and Daemon' from the second i read it.
Looking forwards to reading book 5 (Opposition - coming out 2014) 
I know that the guy still looks like our old, good Daemon.
Well, this story blew me to Pluto.
Dang, I really didn't think a writer could snatch all of your emotions with words on a page and drag it anyway they choose, but JLA has done exactly that.
Every book in the Lux series is better than the last one.
There's just no limit to how awesome and intriguing these stories are!
I loved the part of their new identities how JLA incorporated the two main characters of the Sweet Evil trilogy, and used their names as Kat and Daemon's new ones, that was really awesome!
Fantastic story, but what was really 'WOW' was the that ending!
No no no no, this just cannot end like that. So many deaths and I'm hurting for all of them -even the ones I never thought I'd feel-.Beth's pregnancy is a wreck train. I so can't forgive Matthew for doing that shit no matter what. Damn book! Jennifer, you can't do this to us!
I feel like in a really near future we will be out of characters...
She was pushed in every direction possible and had no choice but to defend herself, even if it means doing things she doesn't want to do.In the mean time, Daemon is literally going crazy knowing Katy is out there, maybe hurt, maybe dead and he can't do a thing to help her.
Considering all that she lost in this book, I believe that she is literally ready to face anything.Daemon was amazing as usual, and I really wanted to see how he would react when Katy was abducted.
We all know that Katy was his weak spot, but I just didn't know the extend of his love for her until reading this book and being blow away by its intensity.
❝Her stare burned me from the inside. I wanted to worship her. I needed to. Every inch.❞ I can finally and officially say that Katy and Daemon are one of my favorite couples! Even when Daemon was a douche and jerk to her in the beginning, he was actually like that for a reason and there were always reasons behind it. Even when he felt something for her and liked her in some way just didn't want to admit it or express it, it was sticking with him the whole time, he just had trouble showing it. J
Even when I thought I would hate Katy a little and would end up always hating Daemon, I really didn't expect any of this.
JLA has made me love this series and even though I had to wait until the 3rd book to grow a love for Daemon, love Katy again, and finally be able to see them together, I think it was worth it.
I actually finished Obsidian and ordered Onyx right away because I wanted to see if anything new would happen and if my thoughts about the series would change.
;)BUT NOW?To all you readers, don’t worry, Daemon didn’t lose his hotness.BUT THE PLOT WAS A COMPLETE UTTER FAIL.JLA’s amazing, mind me, but in this series, she just kept on adding more and more problems to the story, but never actually solved any of them.IT’S THE FOURTH FREAKING BOOK.There needs to be a few solutions happening about now right??WAKE.
PEOPLE.And second of all...what the heck is going on between Katy and Daemon?!There’s just so much f*cking distrust and problems between the two of them, but once they have a good kiss, they’re all freaking back together again.WTF.DNF at page I-don’t-even-know-where-but-somewhere-around-the-middle.
Not really feeling the cover...
I'll burn the world down to save her. EPIC! Truly impressive.From where can I start telling you about this book?First of all if you compare the first book of the series Obsidian with Origin, you will notice that the story has evolved exponentially:1.The high school children are not children any more. They are young adults now. They hold their future in their hands, they take painful decisions, they proceed in life-changing actions.2. The action will move from the little town and the school to s
Truly impressive.From where can I start telling you about this book?First of all if you compare the first book of the series Obsidian with Origin, you will notice that the story has evolved exponentially:1.The high school children are not children any more.
The action will move from the little town and the school to secret military underground bases where humans try to be The God.3.
Humans play a vital part in this book.
Everyone can become a casualty: human or alien, main or secondary character.
After a while, you get used to it.One thing is certain, the world will NOT be the same after this book.
So , because I like express my felings through gifs , I will do exactly that!The most memorable moments :1.
When I read what was happening to Kat 3.
When Deamon surrendered 4.When Blake return (view spoiler)[ and she did !
(hide spoiler)]5.
What Daedalus were doing6.What Kat and Deamon did in Vegas 7.
And Beth with Dawson(view spoiler)[ (hide spoiler)]8.
Oh and finally MatthewAnd there was so many great moments just that I would add and add gif after gif...
I won't say anything else 'cause it would be to much!Just READ IT!
READ IT!AND Jennifer L.
BEST IN THE SERIES SO FAR. Here's my booktalk: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37FNG...
And the O's continue!ObsidianOnyxOpaland now Origin!I'm really surprised that it took me so long to notice this...EDIT (AFTER READING OPAL):*shakes fist angrily*DARN YOU CLIFFHANGERS!!!!EDITING AGAIN:I don't like this cover...1. it looks so different from the other covers.2. It's one of those covers that make me embarrassed to buy the book...
