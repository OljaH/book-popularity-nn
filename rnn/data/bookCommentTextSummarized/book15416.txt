Aline reminded me of Elizabeth Bennet and Livia reminded me of Jane Bennet.
So yea I was feeling Jane Austen all over this book.
Which is fine because I love me some Jane Austen.
I did take a stars off because Aline drove me crazy the way she kept pushing the hero away and hurt him instead of just being honest!
Still overall a good read!
5+ stars – Historical RomanceI really enjoyed (loved!) this touching, emotional read of two childhood best friends turned sweethearts of opposing social classes whose love is torn apart by unfair prejudices, society rules and expectations, secrets, lies, mistrust, pride, and vanity.
You’re apart from the man you love for 12 years and then you finally have a miraculous, magical second chance, only you’re too chicken, distrusting, insecure, and vain to admit the truth and put your feelings out there?!?
Still, I was rooting for McKenna to soften his ways and for Aline to finally come to her senses and admit her “big” secret before it was too late because those two definitely needed and deserved a HEA!
While I’ve never seen it listed as a numbered book in the series, the characters in Again the Magic are featured heavily in It Happened One Autumn, book 2 of the Wallflowers, as well as in the other Wallflower novels.There are so many good things to say about this book that I don’t know where to start.
The reactions of the characters were more in keeping with what I would have expected given the depth of their feelings for one another and their lack of control over certain situations.
Again the Magic is an edgy historical romance that offers a double dose of taboo love during a time where venturing outside of one's social class was not only unheard of, but inarguably forbidden.
Our main couple, Aline and McKenna, are childhood friends who gradually and helplessly fall in love.
But McKenna eventually returns with bitterness on his tongue and revenge against Aline in his heart...Alongside Aline's and McKenna's romance runs a secondary love story, which is a little less forbidden but also holds a healthy level of "taboo".
▪	 Plot: Showcases a main forbidden love story, and a secondary character romance.▪ Writing: Eloquent, fluid, graceful, steamy.
But when she finally got McKenna to get over his revenge plan and declare his true feelings again, I thought this is it, this is what she was waiting for, to see if he still cared.
I thought the other love story between Aline's younger (and wiser) sister Livia and uppercrust New Yorker Gideon Shaw was almost as exciting as the McKenna/Aline storyline.
I did like how Livia handled his problem (I swear she had way more sense than her sister Aline)!There were so many moments in this book that had me tearing up.
Fundamentally, the secondary love story takes up way too much of this book.
I believe that McKenna and Aline's beautiful love story deserves more time than was spent on it in this story.
Instead, we see them go from strangers to lovers to in love (in my opinion in a manner that is much more convincing than the main couple's story).
He thinks that Aline didn't love him and easily forgot about him, so he has driven himself to get revenge against her by making himself into a very rich, powerful man, no matter what the cost is.
I'm just going to point out what I liked/disliked in this book, since I seem to be in the minority for not loving it as "everyone else".Likes:- McKenna, Gideon, Livia, Westclif...
;)Dislikes:- Aline and her ridiculous excuses for sending McKenna away (the 2nd time; I was OK with her reason for sending him away the 1st time.)- Two romances crammed into one book: I wish LK had written Aline's and Livia's stories separately.
I liked it, but I didn't love it.Interesting tidbit: During their business visit to London, McKenna and Gideon stay at the Rutledge Hotel.
5 TAKE ME AS I AM ~ stars !!Since the day that John McKenna had been brought to the estate at the age of 8, he and Aline had been constant companions for ten years, climbing trees, swimming in the river, and running around barefoot.
No healthy young man could fail to be stirred and set off-kilter by Aline, who at the age of 17, had become the loveliest girl on God's green earth.Lady Aline MarsdenWarm, high-spirited, and beautiful in all ways.
You're the only man I'll ever want, McKenna.""No one will ever look at me the way you do.
Shortly after McKenna's departure, Aline is injured in a terrible accident, which almost claims her life and leaves her badly scarred.Twelve years have passed and Aline is still living at Stony Cross Park with her brother, Marcus, now the Earl of Westcliff, and Olivia (Livia), her younger sister.
I want to see you in the final hour of my life.....to lie in your arms as I take my last breath."I like the way in which the secondary romance between Livia and Gideon Shaw is interwoven and find it every bit as satisfying as Aline and McKenna's.
"I’ll marry no man but you McKenna. And if you ever leave me, I’ll be alone for the rest of my life.""Aline …. I would never leave unless you told me to go …"  Aline was his curse, his fate, his consuming desire. He would never stop wanting her, no matter what she did, no matter how many oceans and continents he managed to put between them.  "No man on earth has ever hated sunrise as much as I do."  "You sleep too," she said groggily, her hand creeping to the center of his chest."No." McKenna s
"I’ll marry no man but you McKenna.
And if you ever leave me, I’ll be alone for the rest of my life.""Aline ….
"You sleep too," she said groggily, her hand creeping to the center of his chest."No." McKenna smiled and pressed a soft kiss against her temple.
When I finish a book such as this I always say to myself, “Why do you read Historicals only now and again?” I must make sure I dip into them more often.
A Wonderful read.
I know I said in one status update that I did not want McKenna to be mean to her but I thought he could have been a bit more of an ass!
“Perhaps only those who had loved and lost could appreciate this magic.”  I think I say this in all of my historical romance reviews, but it's not really a genre I enjoy reading most of the time unless it is done well.
I was easily able to take a step back and enjoy this angsty romance for what is was: a great second chance romance.When Aline and McKenna were kids, they fell in love.
Aline strikes a deal with him, and McKenna is sent away with prospects, but never to return.Twelve years later McKenna returns a changed man, a wealthy one.
I loved seeing the changes in them over the years and the whys and hows.
No man on earth has ever hated sunrise as much as I do.”I would give this 10+ stars if I could, because Again the Magic is one of the best romance stories I've ever read.What made this so impressive was the fact that almost all the characters were so beautifully written and well-developed.
And when he finally did, I couldn't help but give a small victory dance.Livia and Gideon's honest and open relationship was a good contrast to McKenna and Aline's romance, which was filled with secrets.
. He loved her the way a man should love a woman.As for Aline, I have to admit that I found her hard to like.
The reason I consistently recommend Kleypas to friends of mine who don't read historical romance is because many of her books have it all : good story, steamy romance, and plenty of moments which will make you laugh.That said, this is still probably my favorite Kleypas to date.
The reward of seeing Aline and her love find a sweet reunion made everything better.
In the case of this couple, they were one of the better matched pairings I've read in a book.
I love seeing two people become become such a perfect fit together.There was also a side story of Aline's sister finding her own happiness.
While Aline and McKenna definitely take the primary position, I actually liked Gideon and Livia better.
I wouldn't say I disliked the book, because I definitely enjoyed some parts, but I also didn't love it or think it'll be all that memorable in the long run -- so I'm going to go with a middle of the road 3 star rating here.Brief Summary of the Storyline:  This is Aline, McKenna, Livia, and Gideon's story.
Both couples have some good tension, chemistry, and scenes -- but not so much it takes away from the story.Descriptive sex: Yes for both couplesOW/OM drama: Yes, but mild (view spoiler)[ The h1 has a close friend that ends up proposing marriage and makes the H1 jealous.

Again The Magic is an enjoyable book and I look forward to more books by this author.My observations about Historical Romances versus NA, YA, erotica and contemporary genres.
Historical Romances have: cougars, gay best friend, scandal, parties, sex, revenge, etc...
Give historical romance a try you might discover you like this genre.SERIES:
Can be read as standalones but it's recommended reading the series in order.Prequel:
Can be read as standalones but it's recommended reading the series in order.Novella:
I definitely had some issues with this one, including my most hated trope of all time happening not once, but TWICE in this novel *facepalm*.
I also had issues with the language regarding males 'posessing' and 'owning' women and consent (COZ Y'ALL.
I grew really attached to the characters even though I wanted to hit them over the head multiple times.
If you're wondering what the trope is(view spoiler)[it's when two characters are in love and yet one of them breaks it off and lies about their feelings in order to 'save' the other person from hurt.
As they become young adults and more mature feelings arise, they both know that Aline, as an upper class lady, has no chance of marrying the hired hand.
I want your tears, your smiles, your kisses...the smell of your hair, the taste of your skin, the touch of your breath on my face.
I want to see you in the final hour of my life...to lie in your arms as I take my last breath."I realize that this is a very quote-y review, and I apologize.
If you want a HR recommendation, read the Wallflowers series, starting with this book.
5 Stars -  Also reviewed at: Lady Jayne's Reading Den  “The worst thing you can do for love is deny it; so when you find that special someone, don't let anyone or anything to get in your way.” ~ Author Unknown“It hurts to love someone and not be loved in return, but what is the most painful is to love someone and never find the courage to let the person know how you feel.” ~ Author Unknown Lisa Kleypas is one of my absolute favourite authors. Most of her books are keepers for me. I devoured her
It’s considered a prequel to the Wallflowers series because it happens chronologically before it and has Marcus, Lord Westcliff, a much beloved character from Wallflowers in it - I ADORE Marcus!The story begins with Lady Aline Marsden, daughter of the unbending and intolerant Earl of Westcliff, and her childhood friend, a servant at Stony Cross Manor, John McKenna, falling in love.
Sure, if they had been separated out into two separate books, we definitely would have gotten more development of both relationships, but like I said, this really didn’t bother me.The secondary romance between Livia (Marcus' and Aline's youngest sister) and Gideon really touched me, too.
“I want morning and noon and nightfall with you. I want your tears, your smiles, your kisses...the smell of your hair, the taste of your skin, the touch of your breath on my face. I want to see you in the final hour of my life...to lie in your arms as I take my last breath.” This is my second historical romance this year and I've added it to my favourite reads of 2016. Lisa Kleypas where have you been all my life?! A few friends have recommended this series to me and I kept thinking..."Nah, it
Our main characters Aline Marsden and John McKenna (also known as just McKenna) grew up together, they were inseparable despite their different stations in life.
She lives a life of regret and loneliness until McKenna comes back and she decides that although they can never be together she will allow herself just one night with the only man she's ever loved.
But Lisa Kleypas takes the reader on a journey full of tension, sensuality and love that makes you hurt right along with the characters.Apart from McKenna and Aline's story there is a subplot with Aline's sister and McKenna's good friend and business associate it was absolutely charming.
Being a hypocritical bastard, like Harry, and manipulating, publically compromising and then just forcing a woman into marriage (during a time when divorce wasn't a viable option for a woman)...or being a misogynistic bastard, like McKenna, who's out for vengeance against an Ex and decides he's owed sex, entertains the thoughts of a mistress arrangement rather than marriage, and is hoping to get a bastard child off her for good measure?The only reason I've decided not to rate this a one star is because I actually enjoyed the beginning and all the parts with Gideon and Livia.
Well, that is what had happened in Lisa Kleypas’ historical romance novel, “Again the Magic.” “Again the Magic” has drama, romance, lies, secrets and excitement that outshines from most romance novels ever written and it will have you waiting in anticipation as you read this book!Years ago, Lady Aline Marsden fell in love with a servant on her father’s estate named John McKenna and their love knew no bounds.
The characters I loved the most in this book were John McKenna and Aline Marsden as they were the most intense couple I have ever read in any romance novel since they have so many issues to work through!
His deep-seated hatred for Aline as an adult just simmers throughout the story –you can feel that this guy is going to blow!--but he’s fighting between love and hate for her and he doesn’t know what to do or how to act.
The father is truly evil and though he's only in the book for a few pages you just want to kill this sob :-oThere are parts in this story that will just have you sobbing “why!!!” in total frustration and I knew the ending already so that shouldn’t even happen, but that goes to show what an amazing author Kleypas is.
::sigh:: McKennaI loved Aline and McKenna, and how we got to see them before the betrayal.I thought the way McKenna came back to hurt Aline was soo well done.
I'm sure I've mentioned it before, but I am a sucker for the betrayal and redemption plot...but only if it works.
I also loved when Aline told Livia that she wasn't willing to accept Gideon and his faults (his binge drinking), so how dare her suggest that McKenna would take Aline with her flaws-I won't spoil what they are.The way McKenna finally laid his heart out for Aline was just heartbreaking, and when he wept on Mrs. Faircloth's shoulder I wept with him.
“I’ll marry no one but you, McKenna,” she whispered. “And if you ever leave me, I’ll be alone for the rest of my life.”His dark head lowered over hers. “Aline,” he said in the hushed voice that he might have used in prayer. “I would never leave unless you told me to go.”   Now this is how a second-chance romance is supposed to be written. I ADORE this book!  Lady Aline Marsden and John McKenna grew up together. She’s nobility and he’s a mere servant on their estate, but that never mattered to
They loved each other as friends and over time it grew to something more powerful and more forbidden, something McKenna tried to ignore but Aline was determined to pursue.
Does Aline have the courage to tell McKenna the real truth of why she sent him away all those years ago, and trust in McKenna’s love enough to realise he would accept her as she was?
My heart just broke for Aline and how much she loved McKenna, how hard it was to send him away.
I also loved the secondary romance between Aline’s sister Olivia and McKenna’s business partner Gideon.
THIS.I don't think I'm capable of writing a review that would even skim the surface of how good this book was.
I was either tearing up or revered by the writing, it was insane!Add to that a very poignant and heartbreaking friends-to-lovers story and we have a winner.
He was strong yet vulnerable, forever in love with Aline, even when he had his reasons not to be.
INCREDIBLE.Aline finally found her bravery and told him her secrets, but almost too late.
And McKenna's reaction to them was passioned beyond reason.
But these were gushing, happy tears!
The whole damn book was amazing!
LOVED IT BEYOND REASON!
Two. I’ve read two HR books before.
I’m gonna start reading more of them, cuz this book has shown me how into it I can be!
(view spoiler)[That scene by the river, when McKenna pours his heart out to her and she pushes him away AGAIN.
She’s so damn lucky I’m not McKenna, cuz I would’ve stayed pissed at her for much much MUCH longer than he was when he found out the truth.
Marcus did such a good job in helping her see her fault in it, and McKenna’s rage at her for thinking so little of him was awesome.
4.5 magical stars!I thought I had outgrown pure historical romance without a supernatural or magical twist of some kind to keep things interesting, but Lisa Kleypas reawakened my love for HR with Again the Magic. And now I'm addicted to this series, I even went ahead and read the next two books of the Wallflowers series!. ***RTC***
Twelve years later McKenna comes back to Stony Cross much changed with revenge on his mind, unaware of the secrets that Aline holds.This is definately one of my favourite LK books, Aline and McKenna are just a fabulous couple, you could feel the pull they have for eachother right through the pages of the book.
The only thing that niggled me with this book was Aline's stubborn refusal to tell McKenna the truth, ofcourse that would have made this a very short book and I understand her reluctance intially but after a while I think it was just silly.
We also get a secondary romance through Livia, Aline and Westcliff's sister and Gideon Shaw, a friend of McKenna's.
This read makes me feel again the magic which only Lisa Kleypas, herself, can ever deliver.To prove a point, I utterly feel like a little girl, who had a taste of sweet and irrisistable candy, which takes almost a day to finish.
And unfortunately, coming out of the trance, realizing that the candy is all gone, I feel disappointment.
To further prove a point, before finishing the book, these were my thoughts:I've done a terribly horrendous mistake.
I made a mistake of reading the book in the wee hours of the morning.
3.5 (Qué rabia que no se pueda puntuar mejor) La novela es entretenida, como todas las de esta autora, pero la historia secundaria me entorpecía un poco la lectura y admito que algunos trozos los leía en diagonal. En cambio, la relación entre Aline y McKenna es muy bonita y con algunas escenas muy emotivas (está claro que siento una gran debilidad por los protagonistas que se conocen desde niños).
