This is more of a reminder for myself than anything. Memory is a snippet of an encounter between the Genie and the Daemon who are talking about the builders who left the stones and the ruins near the river Than.
An oddly effective, tiny little story, evoking the ephemeral nature of human works.
Lovecraft's fourth published work. This flash short story evokes his interest in nameless relics and forgotten history, which over time become regular staples of his mythos. This one-page story describes the deteriorating and horrific condition of the mysterious "valley of Nis," and observes a conversation between the "Genie that haunts the moonbeams" and the "Daemon of the Valley." The two briefly converse about the beings that built the valley's crumbling monoliths, and the Daemon, named "Memory," recalls that the beings were called "Man."
This little vignette on the passing mankind is very reminiscent of Ambrose Bierce's "An Inhabitant of Carcosa." Shelley's Ozymandias is essentially the same sentiment but better, albeit restricted to one king instead of the whole of us.(Moved 2015 review to the individual work Sept. 2017 to make room to review the collection under its own entry.)
В долині річки ростуть небезпечні рослини і повзають жахливі гади. Також тут живуть маленькі мавпочки. На схилах долини розкидане каміння - руїни старих споруд. Джин, який спустився з місяця, запитав у духа долини, ким був цей будівельник. Дух відповідає, що нічого не може згадати про нього, тільки те, що його звали людиною і він був схожий на цих мавпочок.
One of Lovecraft's very early works and indicative of the talent that he will become later on. In this one-page story, Genie and Daemon recall the memory of Man. I'd only recommend this for fans of Lovecraft who are interested in reading all of his works. Otherwise, it's a pass.
খুবই ছোট একটা গলপ ... কিনতু আর বাকি দশটা ছোট গলপের মতো না ... বিভীষিকাময় এক উপতযকার বরণনা দিয়ে শুরু হওয়া গলপটি শেষ হয়েছে মানুষের পরিণতি নিয়ে কিছু কথামালার মাধযমে । পড়ে দেখতে পারেন এক পাতার এই গলপটি । ভালো লাগবে আশা করা যায় :)

My Rating System:* couldn't finish, ** wouldn't recommend, *** would recommend, **** would read again, ***** have read again.
A short page story about a daemon contemplating the deceased human race and a genie who haunts the night. Not one of Lovecrafts's more ambitious works, but fine nonetheless.
It's so short I feel a bit strange reviewing it. For me, it just wasn't long enough for its message to be effective.
A short, interesting piece that shows the fleating nature of mankind.
6/10
Short, simple and amazing - 3 words of how to desribe it.
It's less than a page, and at that poitn I had never read Silence: A Fable, or really much of any Poe other than the mandatory-in-school "The Tell-Tale Heart," so I mostly found it confusing and strange.
I tried to create the same feel as with the performance of "Silence: A Fable" that I like, turning on Allicorn's "The Upper House" and reading it aloud to myself, but it's just not as powerful.
Poe's story I can immediately relate to, as someone who by preference spends a lot of time alone and is well aware of the dangers of too much solitude, whereas "Memory" isn't about any aspect of human psychology in the same way.
I love this one-page prose poem. It is a perfectly formed, if brief, discussion between the Genie of the Moon and the Daemon of the Valley of Nis regarding the sad little apes living in trees. Very reminiscent of Poe. It is a comment on the brevity of human life and humanity in general. It is morose and beautiful.
Al parecer un poema en prosa, del cual no sentí el ritmo en español traducido. :(Un cuento postapocalíptico, en donde la humanidad dejó de existir. Entabla conversación el Genio con el Demonio del valle, para recordar aquellos seres que moraban y construían edificaciones en tiempos pasados.
This is a surprisingly good story, despite its very short length. A reflection on the position of the man in the universe, a short limited presence on a remote speck of dust, at the edge of one of almost infinite number of galaxies.
Me parecía raro la prosa de Lovecraft en este relato, hasta que me dí cuenta que intentó hacer un poema
Didn't seem to do anything. I may have missed something. Will give it another go later sometime.
Wow, okay, that was astonishingly short.
I"m thinking I like lovecraft best when he's short and too the point. This one is almost a poem, so it did nicely.
¿Quien diría que en las últimas dos o tres líneas Lovecraft podría generar un final tan inesperado...?
Short, short story. Nice if you want a little taste of Lovecraft's language.
Basically a prose retelling of Ozymandias, and just as brief - still, the images of the forgotten and ruined valley were enjoyable.
Feels like a puzzle piece from a bigger story
Discussão entre um gênio e um demônio sobre uma curiosa raça de seres parecidos com macacos.
"Recuerdo débilmente su aspecto, ya que era parecido al de los pequeños monos arbóreos. Sí recuerdo con claridad su nombre, ya que rimaba con el del río. Esos seres pretéritos se llamaban Humanidad."
Ha! This was actually pretty good. Well, I don't mean that it was awesome, but it was a great description of a landscape with a poetic type feel to it.
Makes you wonder, how would the gods of old perceive humans after observing so many years of bizarre and chaotic events caused by us?
