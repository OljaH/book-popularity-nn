I really like that the adult characters like Poe and Aunt Josephine are flawed, I think it's important for kids to know that adults aren't automatically right, they can be selfish and scared and make bad decisions.
He seems to be shifting from well-intentioned but kinda dumb to this patronizing antagonistic character and I'm not sure how I feel about that, BUT WE SHALL SEE.Also, one last thing that I want to briefly note -- a lot of the language describing/referring to the person "that looks neither like a man nor woman" had me cringing, and the villainizing of gender ambiguity could be very hurtful to some readers.
*I'm not going to rate this, because I've already read this book & stand by my first rating of it. I know towards the beginning of this series that the books tend to follow a similar story structure, but I love that Lemony Snicket still finds fresh ways of telling the Baudelaire story!
It seems sort of insensitive to say this was fun but gee was this fun. I love reading middle grade because it's simply just fun. It always reminds me why I love reading so much
Mr. Poe is an idiot but it wouldn't work any other way!
I love how in this book, like the last, we get to see the Baudelaires growing into more intelligent and self-reliant people.
Obviously they are still very naive in a lot of ways, being so young, but I love the way their relationship with each other develops over time so much within the series as a whole and it is fun to see that from closer to the beginning of the books.
But I love it.
And I really like the fact that this book starts to show the more angry, bitter side of these kids at times.
I’m having so much fun reading this series for the first time!
By the third book of Snicket's series the formula is fully established and it is exercised here in full.
Mr Poe dumps the kids on another kookie relative, Count Olaaf turns up in disguise and they recognize him instantly.
Olaaf nearly gets his hands on the children.
Through use of their singular defining skills the children thwart Olaaf and the henchman selected to back him up this book.
The relative's obsession with grammar is dry stuff and the subtle grammatical clues the children solve are hard to convey in an audiobook (which is what she's getting when I read to her) - it's/its and their/there ...
I like this lil village (shoutout to the Anxious Clown) and Lake Lachrymose and the harbor a lot.Also, Uncle Monty > Aunt Josephine, but Stephano < Captain Sham.
I still wrote a lot.Shocker.Bottom line: In, like, my bottom five books of the thirteen that make up my favorite series.
it's definitely the fault of these books for being so short and fun and addictive and not my fault for poor time management.so yet again, i shall say I LOVE THIS SERIES SO MUCH, followed by that even more common phrase:review to come

She recently lost her husband and lives alone atop a hill in a rickety house overlooking Lake Lachrymose. What is it with Aunt Josephine? She seems kind and the children feel safe, but she’s afraid of everything you could imagine and she’s absolutely obsessed with grammar. Life is quite boring there and the childre
You can also read this review @ https://readrantrockandroll.com/2018/...The children have managed to avoid capture by Count Olaf again and now meet their new guardian, Aunt Josephine.
Right away Violet recognizes the man as Count Olaf and he’s already in the process of wooing Aunt Josephine who is completely oblivious as to what’s going on.
He introduces himself as Captain Sham, but the children know better and will have to find a way to free themselves from Count Olaf once again.I really love the use of vocabulary in these books.
The one mistake I did make was allow my kids to start the Netflix series.
Obviously not.I also have a soft spot for this one because it's particularly bizarre.
And I think I could've felt bad for Aunt Josephine's extreme anxiety disorder...but she kept cooking bad meals (unacceptable, food is life) and correcting people's grammar and I actually get why Count Olaf wanted to murder her for that.
STOP NOW PLEASE.(But I still feel 100% bad for Josephine.)(And please would someone throw Count Olaf off a cliff??)(WHY AM I SO VIOLENT I THOUGHT I WAS A NICE PERSON.) <-- biggest lie I ever told myself tbhAnd I love that Sunny saves the day in this one.
Because she's obviously my favourite.HOLD ME I LOVE THIS SERIOUSLY BIZARRE AND MESSED UP AND DARK SERIES.
Those super unfortunate orphans get stuck with another ineffectual guardian, who can't keep them safe from the dastardly Count Olaf.
Count OlafThe The Wide Window has some colorful characters, wonderful settings and enough action to keep this one entertaining through out.
I doubt I would've read even this far in Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events if it weren't that the man behind that preposterous pseudonym, Daniel Handler, played accordion on my favorite band, The Magnetic Fields fantastic triple cd album 69 Love Songs.
Here's a somber song he played on, if you care to listen: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReTxR...
What happens in The Wide Window, the third book in A Series of Unfortunate Events?
The EXACT SAME STORY THAT HAPPENED IN THE FIRST TWO BOOKS!
I’ve read the same story for three books now and I can’t takes the formulaic repetition no more!
Daniel Handler/Lemony Snicket unimaginatively recycles the same dreary guff in yet another jaw-droppingly cheeky and lazy effort.
The Wide Window is such a thoroughly unfunny and uninteresting reading experience that I’m abandoning the series now rather than suffer through reading the same story for another TEN books!
4.1 Ok this series is getting kinda inappropriate for children. I'm not even sure if it's a children's book anymore, since this one has a lot of dark, scary, and sensitive content in it. Nevertheless, it was still a fun and quick read just like the previous books. I really find it funny when Aunt Josephine keeps correcting everyone's grammatical errors. The kids always find a way to get out of their misfortunes, so there's really nothing to worry about them. But still, you can't help but sympat

I'm enjoying this series so far and I'm off to read the 4th book, which is "The Miserable Mill".
3.75* ~ WHY ARE ALL THE ADULTS IN THIS SERIES SO INCOMPETENT?! It's exhausting... (But equally kind of addictive?) Once again this was such a fun read!! Although? I don't think I enjoyed it quite as much as the first two books, simply because it felt a little too similar and repetitive. I'm intrigued to see what the rest of the series has in store. I'm hoping that the storyline will start to differ slightly to the first three, as so far the basic underlying plot has had pretty much the same structure!
After watching the first 4 episodes of the new ASOUE series on Netflix, I decided to pause while I re-read books #3-4.
I'm so glad I did, because I remembered very little in terms of details past book two, having read these book over a decade ago.I'm happy to see they still hold up and are tons of fun to revisit.
And I'm loving the new series, so well done NPH and crew!
Times change.
That's a little cringey, and I'm embarrassed for the series each time it comes up.However.
I love these books.
Can't wait to read the Miserable Mill next.
UPDATE: 19/Jan/2017The review from before is invalid because I like this more than I did before. 30/Nov/2016This book was okay but I think didn't like it as much because it is a children's book. One thing I really don’t like it when the narrator of the book spoils it. He’s telling and story and then says what's going to happen much later in the book and it kind of ruins it.
I think Meryl Streep portrayed her PERFECTLY in the movie and I had fun imagining her as Aunt Josephine in the book.
Count Olaf is such an asshole, I really want the children to turn the tables and come up with plan to exact some Kill Bill revenge on his ass and get rid of him but the series goes onto 13 books so I guess we'll see how it pans out.
I'll still imagine Violet, Klaus, Sunny, Mr. Poe, and Count Olaf as the actors who portrayed them in the film though because I think they pulled off the characters amazingly and I don't think anyone, not even the Netflix series could top them.
I'm also getting kind of tired of pretty much the same thing happening in each book.
I'm sure it's going to keep that format for the foreseeable future but I'm getting kind of bored of what feels like an endless loop to me.
It would be nice to see something different so I'm not reading 13 versions of the same book just with different guardians and different morals to each story.
Snicket only really grazed the surface though in comparison to the lessons I learned in book 1 & 2 though.
I would recommend this series & I would read more by Lemony Snicket.
I really do enjoy these books. I will have to watch the Netflix series again.
"Violet fell against one of the bedposts and banged her knee. Klaus fell against the cold radiator and banged his foot. And Sunny fell into the pile of tin cans and banged everything."  First, the trio had a greedy guardian, followed by a cool herpetologist as an uncle and now they have a grammar obsessed aunty. Geez, I don't whether to be glad that they evaded Count Olaf or pity these children for their misfortunes in life. LolThis series is hilarious and I just can't stop reading it.
I really enjoyed this book in the A Series of Unfortunate Events series. The plot did feel like it was repeated from The Reptile Room.
I am just flying through these books!
Despite being dark and gloomy, they are so fun and enjoyable to read.
I think a big part of the reason for that is that as I get older I can appreciate things about these stories that I didn't when I was younger and I noticed that a lot in this particular book.
I found myself actually chuckling out loud at the subtle but clever humour that's woven throughout this story!
Snicket has truly written a series that stands the test of time and is as enjoyable when you're a child as when you're an adult!
4/5 "In most stories, as you know, the villain would be defeated, there would be a happy ending, and everybody would go home knowing the moral of the story. But in the case of the Baudelaires, everything was wrong." These books are so much fun to read.Every time I'm so curious to see what's going to happen to those children.In this book we are introduced to Aunt Josephine and the Count is always there to try to put his hands on the children. So I'm starting thinking that maybe all the books have

(?)The book is set in a short period of time, so we have a pretty detailed experience.
These books are not my favorites or anything, but I think I enjoyed this one the most out of the three I've read :)
زندگی بچهها با سرپرست جدیدشون ماجراهای جدیدی به دنبال داره.تو کتاب سوم شخصیتپردازیها عمیقتر میشه. شخصیت سانی رو خیلی دوست دارم واقعا بامزه ست.----------یادگاری از کتاب:وقتی کسی سر میز شام حرف نمیزند، به نظر میرسد که غذا خوردن ساعتها طول میکشد....همدیگر را داشتن در جریان زندگی تاسفبارشان درست مثل داشتن قایقی بادبانی در وسط طوفانی شدید بود.

Such a fun and easy read! I read this aloud to my 6 year old and this is his review:“Klaus is my favorite. I thought the leeches sounded scary but also funny. I like Reptile Room better but I also like this one.”- Ryder, first grader 😊
I guess I will have to take a short break from this series at some point soon - don't get me wrong the stories are fun and well executed but I guess there is a pattern forming here.
Now this premise could become boring very quickly however the stories hold your attention through a series of weird and wonderful characters and places and the strange situations they find themselves in.
I didn't like The Wide Window as much as the first two books, but it's still a great story, really worth reading, full of dark fantasy and humor and fantastically gothic imagery.
These books are super fast reads and take me back to when I read them for the first time. I honestly just love these stories, despite the fact the tone of the narrator is a tad condescending as an older person. That being said, these books are targeted towards a younger audience and I found the definitions of words to be helpful when I was 10 and reading them.
Mr Poe (in my opinion, a useless main caretaker), a family friend who took care for the orphans fortune until Violet came to an age, brought them to live with another family member, name Mrs. Josephine Anwhistle, who lived in a house, in the edge of a hill (literally) above Lake Lachrymose, that is infested with Lachrymose Leeches, who would eat a human if they smellt food on them.
but we all knew who exactly Captain Sham was, of course Aunt Josephine wasn't very keen to believe the children.
