Although, there was a major downfall for me:The first 100 pages were really good!The next 100 pages were slowing down and getting draggy The next 219 pages went at a frustrating snails pace until FINALLY the last page had what the whole book was leading up to.I am disappointed by Love, Rosie because it could've been SO MUCH better if it wasn't so slow and draggy.
The movie on the other hand was how the book should've been written, slowly paced enough so you could fall for the characters but not so slow that you lost interest.
This is definitely a case where I like the movie better than the book.
I know, I know, I'm a sucker for HEAs and it makes me insane when I don't get them or when it takes too long for the main characters to achieve it.
I'm all about making the main character suffer a bit, but I think this was too much.Still, I think this book will make an amazing movie one day.
Probably because it's easier to suffer a couple of hours than 2 days of frustrating long reading, lol.
This took me a while to get into because at times I felt like it was difficult to understand how much time had passed since the last section and sometimes I felt that I couldn't fully connect to the characters.
However, I eventually got used to the writing and it actually made it a quicker read than if it was just plain narrative prose.
Also, the epilogue wrapped the story up so well!I had so much fun reading this book and I can't wait to watch the movie with Lily Collins and Sam Claflin (even though I hear it is pretty much nothing like the book).
El libro me gustó muchísimo y el final me sacó lágrimas de felicidad, PEEEERO le quité una estrellita porque la mayor parte del tiempo me la pasé MUY frustrada con los personajes, ¡fue demasiado tiempo, DEMASIADO!
Desde hace tiempo que quería leer este libro porque supe que habría película y que los protagonistas serían Lily Collins & Sam Claflin pero lo pospuse mucho tiempo, en fin, hoy (técnicamente son las 2:00 am así que creo fue ayer...) lo empecé y bueno, horas después lo acabé y así estoy ahora mismo: Me devoré el libro porque esas cartas/emails/postales... eran tan enganchantes (a pesar que al principio me estresó por lo mismo) y más que nada porque me moría por saber cuándo demonios Rosie &am
eran tan enganchantes (a pesar que al principio me estresó por lo mismo) y más que nada porque me moría por saber cuándo demonios Rosie & Alex iban a empezar por decirse sus verdades y afrontar ese amor que tan condenadamente obvio era.Desde el principio intuí que me iban a hacer sufrir éstos dos, y sip, (view spoiler)[ acabé decepcionada y enojada porque tuvieron que tener 50 años (¡50 JODIDOS AÑOS!) para estar juntos (joooder Cecelia, mínimo hubieras puesto un epilogo más largo) (hide spoiler)] pero ahora me pongo a pensar que así es la vida, pasan tantas cosas inesperadas, por una decisión que tomas se desencadenan diversos acontecimientos que pueden terminan haciendo que nada pasé como esperabas (view spoiler)[(maaaldita sea Alex, por qué no le dijiste todo en persona a Rosie en vez de escribirle UNA PUÑETERA CARTA) (hide spoiler)] Creo que estoy extrañamente conforme y feliz (view spoiler)[porque hubiera sido peor que alguno de ellos hubiera seguido sin saber nada, sin haber experimentado de nuevo ese silencio...(necesito más pañuelos).
You really get to dig deep into the main character's emotions and feelings this way and I really enjoyed it.
On the other hand, at times I did feel like the characters all aged too fast but I guess that's symbolic to life because times just goes by so fast!I think this book is leaning towards a definite 4.5 starts, I absolutely loved and devoured it!I am extremely excited to get round to watching the film as I feel like it will work really well!
Find all of my reviews at: http://52bookminimum.blogspot.com/2.5 StarsOnce again it appears I’m the solo gal who didn’t absolutely fall in love with this book. Shaddup and let me ‘splain myself. But first, let’s cover the synopsis for those who aren’t familiar with the story (which could easily be the case since this book has been published under THREE different titles).

But first, let’s cover the synopsis for those who aren’t familiar with the story (which could easily be the case since this book has been published under THREE different titles).
They’ve managed to remain friends despite of the best efforts of Ms. Big Nose Smelly Breath Casey to keep them apart in elementary school, through the trials and tribulations of puberty, and even when Alex moved across the pond to America.
Even through that little mishap, Alex and Rosie managed to remain friends.
Rather than having Rosie and Alex experience one bad marriage/failed relationship/whathaveyou each, Cecilia Ahern had them experience multiple failures and waste more than half their lives wondering “what could have been” .
This was my first book from Cecelia Ahern and after hearing so many amazing things about her, I had to crack the ice and see for myself.Meet Rosie and Alex, 2 best friends that share with us their funny and sad moments.
It was such an interesting thing in reading the story using this instruments and I was very excited to understand how Cecelia managed to make the reader understand the plot.
Rosie and Alex, 2 best friends since childhood, with a lot in common, who dream of a future together, as friends of course.
"Life is funny isn’t it? Just when you think you’ve got it all figured out, just when you finally begin to plan something, get excited about something, and feel like you know what direction you’re heading in, the paths change, the signs change, the wind blows the other way, north is suddenly south, and east is west, and you’re lost. It is so easy to lose your way, to lose direction. And that’s with following all the signposts”   This book... gave me so many damn feellllssss... so many fucking
Just when you think you’ve got it all figured out, just when you finally begin to plan something, get excited about something, and feel like you know what direction you’re heading in, the paths change, the signs change, the wind blows the other way, north is suddenly south, and east is west, and you’re lost.
there were times I was swooning over Alex and Rosie..Oh my goodness!
They hade their fair share of happy, sad, and mostly embarassing moments at school, even arguments actually (Rosie got really upset when Alex didn't invite her to his birthday..

I liked the letters and emails thing, it was something I have never read before.
But my God, does Cecelia Ahern know how to drag a story out.
And then things kept separating Alex and Rosie and it just got really tedious.
I don't care.
I don't fricking care anymore!!!
I didn't ship them together once they got to about 23.
It was simple and easy to read but it was too much.
I think Cecelia Ahern could have slashed the story in half to be honest.
Cecelia Ahern is now in my bad books.
I would not recommend this book to anyone!!!!
Y hoy, justo en este momento cuando debería estar estudiando, de pronto me dan ganas de hacerlo.Siempre tuve cierta debilidad por las historias de amor entre mejores amigos, así que cuando vi este libro, lo agarré y leí la sinopsis, supe que tenía que ser mío.
Y lloraba.Hace poco me di cuenta (síp, me llevó su tiempo) es que este libro no tiene mucho romance.
Este libro es sobre la caótica vida de Rosie Dunne y su mejor amigo Alex; de sus idas y vueltas, sus altibajos.
Sobre las cosas que no decimos y que cuando queremos, termina siendo muy tarde para decir.Odié este libro tanto como lo amé.
I won't give anything away.I thought it was adorable that Rosie's daughter Katie had a relationship with a boy named Toby that completed mirrored Rosie and Alex's relationship except that Katie was always able to follow her dreams whereas the world kept slamming the door in Rosie's face over and over AND OVER again.
It was sad, really, because Rosie was a great person - full of life, love, and humor.I loved the secondary characters, especially Stephanie (Rosie's sister)and Toby.
There were parts of this book that were equally heartbreaking as humorous, but it came together in a way that made my heart swell.I really loved this book and highly recommend it to fans of chick lit and romantic comedy.
*AKA LOVE, ROSIE IN THE UNITED STATES* I have REALLY mixed feelings about this one.
I loved the writing style and the way it was written (in letters, emails and IM's), but it was so FRUSTRATING and it literally took (view spoiler)[50 YEARS (hide spoiler)] for them to finally USE THEIR BRAINS AND JUST TELL EACH OTHER HOW THEY FEEL!
It was SO ANNOYING.
And then at the end, (view spoiler)[you didn't even get to see them be together, which is what I was waiting for!
I NEEDED SOMETHING, EVEN JUST A KISS, BUT NOOOOOOOOO.
(hide spoiler)] I don't know.

3.5/5LOVE, ROSIE made me feel nostalgic about the future.i generally don't read books that follow the characters into their adult life, but this novel really changed my perspective on that.
life is short and people grow apart very easily.even though the entire book is told solely through IMs, emails, and letters, i could truly see rosie grow and change as a character.
towards the end, i wasn't even all the invested into the relationship of the novel, but more on rosie's character and life.as i mentioned before, the entire book is told through letters.
Until its the end and you wish it'll continue because you don't want to let go of the characters you've come to know and understand, most of all to love.
Rosie Dunne is a wonderful woman, she has dreams even though she keeps facing the treacherous twists and turns of life.
And Alex Stewart who succeeds to follow his dreams but keeps making the stupidest mistakes when it comes to love.
Best friends since childhood we see them grow up and face life in their own way while preserving there friendship.Cecelia Ahern keeps you hanging wondering and even cursing these two for making the wrong decisions time and time again.
Me encantó y debo admitir que sufrí como una condenada con los desencuentros de Rosie y Alex, en serio estos dos no podían estar más desincronizados!!!!
Hablar de los personajes tomaría años porque de cada uno de ellos hay cosas para destacar pero es gracioso ver como la historia de Rosie y Alex tiene coincidencias con la historia de Katie y Toby, Ruby es la mejor amiga que toda mujer debe tener y la mejor amiga que uno debe ser para su mejor amiga.
I’m a man of fifty years of age coming to you, feeling like a teenager in love, asking you to give me a chance and love me back.
It was different and gave a different kind of depth to the characters.We weren't getting to know them through how they spoke, what they looked like, what their habbits were.
I could barely bring myself to finish it.It was as though I had finished the book and began reading it again.I found that a huge disappointment.It was torture getting to the final chapter where everything worked out how I wanted it to but I was left feeling unfilfilled.The characters were fifty odd by the time they finally got together.
I wasn't to fazed by the fact the story of Where Rainbows End is completely written as a correspondence, mostly between the two main characters, family and friends.
By the end of the book I really pitied both Alex and Rosie for all the time lost and wasted.Though you might enjoy the development and drama of the main characters, their friends and family, it might take you a while you get through this book as there is only so much repetitive/depressing events you can take in a space of time.
This was such an heartbreaking book!!
The relationship between Rosie and Alex was so beautiful and it just wrecked me!!
I love the fact that this book was really letters and cards,post-cards,emails,invitations.
And omg dont even get me started on the 'silence'!!!
the silence..when you don't have to say anything.you only have to feel!!
I've never read a 'cecelia ahern' book before,but i've seen p.s: i love you, the movie, and i knew i was going to love this book,so reading 'love,rosie' just motivated me to read ,not just 'ps: i love you',but ALL of her books!!
This book is hands down the most perfect romance-fiction i've ever read!!
PERFECT.PERFECT BOOK!!!

[I HAVE TO write this book review but it's gonna be so hard! I have billions of notes on my e-reader I think I'll end up not writing it at all. OH MY GOD, THIS IS MUCH MORE FRUSTRATING THAN THE WHOLE BOOK WAS.]_____________-- SPOILERS --E-book copy kindly provided by NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.

But seriously, how many years of mistakes did it take them to even realize they were perfect together???F I F T Y .THAT'S HOW MANY!But I guess I can go by that since I unexpectedly enjoyed the exchange letters!
Their letters/postcards/whatever were so funny and sweet, all their grammatical errors made me laugh my lungs out!Katie and Toby were the spitting images of Rosie and Alex...
Luckily, Katie and Toby didn't spend ALL THEIR LIFE making mistakes in choosing their partners but found their silence, their perfect moment of quietness, in each other.
GOD I LOVE IRELAND!
I will admit, the letter format took me some time to get used to, but only about 30 pages and I was used to it and hooked.Rosie and Alex are the most complex and irritatingly loveable characters I've ever read.
Rosie is a great mother in that she sacrifices LITERALLY her entire life for her daughter, but I don't have it in me for that.The side characters were so cute and I loved them all.
It was a little hard to follow the time at points but it didn't seem to take away from the story.Where I have a hard time rating the book is the love story.
I lost interest almost in the book entirely by that point.
Proper review may or may not come. ^^This is one of those romantic novels that is not at all cheesy and this is why I liked this book. It teaches you so many things about love such as it should not be rushed and that two people can stay in love with each other despite distance and living different lives.
"I've learned that home isn't a place, it's a feeling."  This is one of those rare instances where the movie is better than the book. I don’t mean to be rude, but this is just a bunch of clusterfucked notes and emails from two people who are too scared to tell what they feel for each other, so they ended up losing decades of their lives. Ready Player One movie adaptation is a shitfest.The Lightning Thief movie adaptation was butchered.Love, Rosie movie adaptation turned out to be a lot better
Suffice it to say that I did not like the novel, but I liked the audiobook and I freaking adored the movie so much that I watched it 11 times now!This is one of those rare instances where the movie is better than the book.

Un libro increíble, que me ha dejado con muchas cosas que decir...
fue frustrante, sé lo que es estar en esa situación llamada "oh estoy enamorada de mi mejor amigo" pero como sabes que no tienes una oportunidad si NUNCA LO INTENTAS!!!Es mejor arriesgarte que quedarte siempre con la duda de lo que pudo ser.!!!"Te mereces a alguien que te amé con todo su corazón, Alguien que piense en ti constantemente, Alguien que pase cada minuto de cada día preguntándose,“Qué estás haciendo” “Dónde estás” “Con quién estás” O si estás bien.
Alguien que no tendría que haber dejado escapar la oportunidad de estar contigo años atrás en lugar de asustarse y dejarse dominar por el miedo a intentarlo.
Para todos aquellos que no lo leyeron ni se gasten y vean la pelicula es de esos casos raros donde en realidad la pelicula es mucho mejor que el libro. Las actuaciones son geniales, el soundtrack, la ambientaciòn, todo ES GENIAL. Ademàs es muy divertida y optimista, los personajes se toman todo con humor en cambio en el libro parecía una telenovela mexicana.
Massive no no. La palabra perfecta para describir a este libro es: exasperante.Reseña completa en Gracias a los Libros.
