There is something unusual in the fact that, whenever the amassed evidence of his plot, characters, and arguments point to a world of confusion in which man is utterly lost, Lewis always arrives at the conclusion that we are fundamentally culpable, despite the fact that he always depicts us as acting without recognition.The really frightening thing about Lewis' worldview is that we can never seem to know whether we are naively following good or naively following evil, but that the difference between the two is vital and eternal.
It's mildly embarrassing that I've lived almost 32 years and I've only read one book from the Narnia series.
However, my very scientific thorough analysis also concluded that this book can be read later and no one really cares and it doesn't really matter in the grand scheme of things.
It was neat to read about the origins of Narnia.
I don't have any reason to believe he is an Asian lion, but I again haven't read the entire series yet so that could be explored in future novels where Aslan spends his childhood as a small lion cub in Beijing before creating Narnia later in life.
“No great wisdom can be reached without sacrifice.”  I loved the narration of The Magician's Nephew, it's clear, imaginative, and addicting. This book took me book to the time when I was sitting and listening to my grandma's tales. She always told me about folklores. I can still remember the story about there's a ghost hiding in the closet, it made me so scared and never ever wanted to open the closet alone again.This book literally made me feel like that. I kept wondering why I did and figured

Besides the fun I get from this book, The Magician's Nephew is alike a doctrine as if I was reading the Bible.
“What you see and what you hear depends a great deal on where you are standing.
The Magician's Nephew should be read before The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe for you to get full knowledge about this world.https://goo.gl/qk8zDx
Uncle Andrew tricks Polly into touching a yellow magic ring, causing her to vanish.
Then he explains to Digory that he has been dabbling in magic, and that the rings allow travel between one world and another.
They decide to explore a different world before returning to England, and jump into one of the nearby pools.
Despite protests from Polly, Digory rings the bell.
در این داستان «پالی» به همراه «دیگوری» خواهر زاده ی «دایی اندرو»، وارد دنیایی جنگلی میشوند، که همانند یک تونل، آنها را به دنیاهای دیگر میرساند.
She is a little like Auntie Medusa in The Rescuers, another of Jonathan's favorite films, and she's also a little like the Sea Witch in The Little Mermaid, Madame Mim in The Sword in the Stone, and, of course, the Wicked Witch of the West.
The White Witch, however, is genuinely beautiful, not just using magic to cast an illusion of beauty as Madame Mim and the Sea Witch do on occasion.
Nothing personal, just business.In general, it seems to me, the White Witch is motivated entirely by love of power, and she hates Aslan because he is stronger than she is.
This is one of those books that make you feel good on a bad day. It just puts a smile on your face, whether you read it for the first time as an adult or you relive some of the moments of you childhood through it. And no, I am not that old, even if here I sound like I am ancient hahaha :)
After reading this spellbinding first installment I am so mad at myself that I have missed out on entering this world for so long.I decided to begin reading this series in chronological rather than publication order (as per the numbers on my books) and I am so glad I did.
The particulars of the plot for The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe are well known to me, as I have seen the movie adaptation numerous times, and it made reading this so special and exciting as facets from the second book were incorporated into the first.Regardless of the order, this is one series I believe has universal appeal, regardless of age, and is one that everyone must read at some point in their lifetime!
It's so much more exciting!” Another patient pause, then, “Mom, I think you should read them in order.” (He's, like, so much more mature than I am).I was still hesitant, even as I started to read it to my daughters, but within just a few pages, I remembered why it's important not to skip it.I could intuitively sense, within the first few chapters, that this book influenced not only J.R.R. Tolkien, but Robert Jordan and J.K. Rowling, as well.
Despite the fact that The Magicians Nephew is the first book in the Chronicles of Narnia, strangely, it is frequently overlooked.
People skip straight ahead to The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe, and then, at a later date come back to this book.Personally, I like this book just as well as any others in the series.
I haven't read any of the Chronicles of Narnia in six years, and now have very little opinion on the debate of what order to read these good books in.
Of course this was AFTER my initial reading of the series, most likely in publication order.
Oh gosh, how many years must it be since I last read this book, 30 ?
Probably one of the lesser known Narnia books but the start of the series none the less and our first introduction to Aslan, and a delight to read.
I had no intention of starting this series this year or even anytime soon, but I saw the boxed set on the shelf and thought why not.
If you’ve never read a Narnia book, you have to try it, if you have read them, never forget them and re-read as soon as you can, you will not regret it.
El sobrino del mago es un libro maravilloso, lleno de magia, de valores, de reflejos de una realidad actual, que me sorprende que se haya escrito hace años.
Es una saga especial y confió a los padres estos libros para que se los lean a sus hijos, porque es de suma importancia que entiendan el mensaje, y los símbolos que tiene, además que el estilo es muy fresco y sencillo de ser interpretado.
Este libro es como una biblia para los niños, realmente me encanta volver a conocer a Aslan y la creación que hizo.
Ahora de verdad espero tener algún tío con magia que me haga ser sobrino del mago.
I really enjoyed reading this one. Fun and fast read, and I also loved reading about how it all started. And even though I noticed a lot of connections with Christianity, I didn't pay a lot of attention to it. I just enjoyed the story in general.I think this is probably my favorite, right after Lion, Witch and the Wardrobe.
REVIEW TO COME! 😁😁
A wonderful read, full of magic, wit, adventure, and hope.Next, Spoiler alert.I noticed that CS Lewis seemed to point out similarites between Uncle Andrew and his nephew, Digory.
You should know that Digory left behind a Mother who is deathly ill.
Aslan sent Digory on a mission, to make up for awakening the queen, and thus bringing her to Narnia.
[and that is where I cried for the first time in the book] "My son, my son," said Aslan.
Go. Pluck [your Mother] an apple from the Tree." For a second Digory could hardly understand.
Just a lovely book series for children and adults alike!The Chronicles of Narnia is included in the list of 100 books and series for The Great American Read.
I'm currently on my library's waiting list for the next audio book: The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe.
The wait means that others are reading this lovely series, and that makes me happy!
I totally support The Chronicles of Narnia being included in The Great American Read.
While I wait for The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe to come available at the library, I will move on and read other books from the list.
Once in Andrew’s study, Polly is tricked by Digory’s almost evil uncle into touching a magic yellow ring which causes her to vanish.
In order to save Polly, Digory is blackmailed by his uncle into testing another magic ring so as to follow Polly; our young hero also takes two green ones just in case they can actually try to return home.
When Digory touches his yellow ring it transports him to a wood between the worlds where he finds Polly alive and well.
Instantaneously, Digory and Polly find themselves in a desolate, abandoned city of some strange, ancient world, which they later learn is Charn.
I've gotten so used to always having a new Narnia book to read when I feel in the mood and now I only have one more book to read.
Then I'm finished!
It's kinda sad actually lol But I really had a good time reading this one!
Definitely another favorite!
But who am I kidding?
I've LOVED every Narnia book I've read thus far xD I would love to see this as a movie along with some of the others.
I hope they continue making them!
Anyone else feel the same?
:P Great book all-in-all.
Loved getting to see how Narnia got started!
Just finished reading this to hubby. He is now, officially, a Narnian.
Even though The Magician’s Nephew was written as the sixth book of the Narnia series, the story predates The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe.
Also, with the festive season looming, it seemed like a good time to get this one off my BBC Big Read reading list (which I only sometimes remember I am supposed to be completing!)Now, I am familiar with the story of Narnia and Aslan from the movies, but there is something to be said about reading one that strains beyond that knowledge to inspire the imagination.
I'm not really a fantasy fan, but I have always wanted to read the Chronicles of Narnia, especially after watching the movies.
The Magician's Nephew, although 6th in the publication order, chronologically it is the first in the series.
Although written way later than the Lion Witch and the Wardrobe, I can understand why the author wanted the readers to start his Chronicles with Magician's Nephew.
Here the readers are introduced to the world of Narnia and the great Lion - Aslan.
Looking forward to read the rest of the chronicles in their chronological order.
That is what happens to those who pluck and eat fruits at the wrong time and in the wrong way.
The day would have come when both of you would have looked back and said it would have been better to die in that illness.'And Digory could say nothing, for tears had choked him and he gave up all hopes of saving his Mother's life; but at the same time he knew that the Lion knew what would have happened, and that there might be things more terrible even then losing someone you love by death.
It was a very serious question for a moment, by I decided with The Magician's Nephew, because I like to do things in order.
While reading I somewhat felt like you needed some information about the series, to spot the important aspects, for instance the wardrobe.
I never read the series, but I did watch the movie, so I felt like I could question how things started.
The Magician's Nephew is a charming, adventurous, and brightly imaginative children's novel.
You could find this book on Hoopla.The Magician's Nephew is a charming, adventurous novel, that I plan to re-read.
¡Narnia, Narnia, Narnia, despierta, ama, piensa, habla!Me gustó mucho, el libro se me hizo super rápido de leer y la historia de cómo se formó Narnia es simplemente maravillosa. Polly y Digory son geniales, los ame muchísimo juntos, tan chicos y lindos descubriendo juntos sus aventuras y sus peleas debes en cuando, me encantaron.(view spoiler)[ Una estafa que no quedaran juntos para el final, los shippeo aunque sean unos niños apenas. (hide spoiler)]Muy entretenido, fácil de leer y que te va adentrando muy bien a la saga, realmente me gustó mucho.
Wow this was a really great reread! I noticed so many things I didn't when reading this as a kid, mainly the religious symbolisms of Aslan, the Witch, uncle Andrew etc. A short but very enjoyable story :)
this one should really be read before the others.it's a wonderful book to read to your children and give them a love for books for life.
I somehow missed out on reading the Chronicles of Narnia when I was a child and recently my roommate bought a box set of the entire series so I figured what better time to amend my ways?
I honestly didn't know anything about Narnia when I started The Magician's Nephew because I haven't seen the movies or read the books before and I didn't expect to like it as much as I did.
I'm a little angry with myself for never having read this as a child because little Loran would have loved these stories so much.
I loved the Chronicles of Narnia as a child and was excited to read this with my 8 year old son.
As a child, I thought it was so magical and amazing that these children got to escape to different worlds.
As an adult, I now see the parallels to the bible, and the messages it is intending to teach.
The end of the book becomes a retelling of sorts of the story of the creation story from the bible.
I must say my remembrance of the book was that of a 5 star read, but in re-reading it, I can only give 4 stars.
What is the shape-shifting of the moon or the sound of fresh snow fallen upon the earth?You might just say it's Creation.Or you might say it’s magic.So I say, as a writer and a man who will forever be bound to the incessant need to communicate what I see (imaginary or otherwise) through the use of written words, that it is the magic of creation; that beautiful moment of spontaneous freedom so cleverly architected by a master craftsman it appears to be as natural as breathing air and yet as exciting as that special relationship between author and reader can possibly be.The first book in C.S. Lewis’ indelible gift to humanity, The Chronicles of Narnia, The Magician’s Nephew resonates with the ambient tones of an awakening world that readers of any age will never want to leave, as Lewis takes us, through the eyes of two unreasonably adorable companions, on a remarkably rich and profound journey despite its scant fifteen chapters, promising only the grandest of voyages, battles, characters, and ideals to come.
S. Lewis imagined how those things that he earlier introduced in The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe came into existence: the kingdom of Narnia, the professor, the witch, the wardrobe and the lamp-post.
It gave me the chance to imagine and admire the efforts Lewis carefully put in coming up with a prequel to sufficiently explain to the readers who liked The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe on how things came into being.
Reading the books in chronological order would have taken away the suspense of already knowing how those things came into existence in The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe.The book's allusions to the Book of Genesis are subtle yet endearing in my opinion.
Instagram || Twitter || Facebook || Amazon || PinterestMy mom used to read me THE LION, THE WITCH, AND THE WARDROBE when I was a little kid. I had always assumed that that was where the story began and it wasn't until fairly recently that I'd learned there was a different order to the books apart from publication order, where you could read them chronologically, in the order that the events within happen in the Narnia universe.THE MAGICIAN'S NEPHEW was the second to last book published but is t
I actually think that THE MAGICIAN'S NEPHEW is a really cool place to start if you don't mind a few minor spoilers because it's in this book that you learn about the origin of not just the Witch but also Narnia herself.This book stars two Victorian-era children named Polly and Digory, who despite their different sets of circumstances, go from being neighbors to being friends and exploring, as children like to do.
