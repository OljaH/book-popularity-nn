So even though Quentin had his ups-and-downs, even though he was kind of a sad sack, even if he never quite rose to the level of being what his potential suggested he might become, he stepped up for one (albeit time-lapsed millennium-long) brief moment and saved the day before humbly giving up power and stepping aside, George Washington-style (I’m a sucker for that, too).
There will be extensive, immersive world-building (Grossman is at his best when he is taking genuine joy from creating his own Narnia- or Hogwarts-like world, rather than trying to smugly point out all of their respective flaws), Quentin will stay just on the bearable side of utterly insufferable, there will be at least one character who I wish had an entire book of their own, and the last hundred pages of the novel will be so brutally unrelenting that it'll make me want to go back to bed and re-read the Narnia books to remind myself that fantasy stories that are more pretty than painful still exist.But The Magician's Land is different.
Meanwhile, Eliot and Janet find that the magic sustaining Fillory is failing and its up to them to stop it...I got this from Netgalley.Well, Goodreads ate the review I spent 20 minutes writing so you're all getting shorter, probably angrier, version.
When I got approved for it on Netgalley, I pushed everything aside like vegetables at Chris Farley's house and dove in head first.The Magician's Land exemplifies what the final book in a trilogy should be.
Things don't converge until around the 70% mark.One of the things I love about this trilogy is the magic system and Grossman pushes it to its full potential.
I mean, none of the books in this trilogy are told in the same way, which just gave it a little extra sumpin-sumpin, in my opinion.In the first one, everything plods along in this somewhat linear way with Quentin first discovering magic is real, moving through his education at the magical Brakebills, then finding out Fillory is real, which leads to losing everything and giving up magic, and finally (in a cliffhanger twist) becoming a king in that magical land.
Quite a few things happened that caught me off guard (in a good way!), the addition of Plum was a nice bonus, and getting a peek into some of the other characters' psyche was a lot of fun!But one of the best things about this last book was seeing how much Quentin had grown up.
This final installment came out a nose head of the others because the conclusion was lovely & terrible & extremely fitting.It's so weird to me that I actually came to love & appreciate all of these characters to this extent.
On top of that, not everyone is excited by the prospect of their ideals about magic torn up by the roots.It feels like one of those situations in high school where everyone is forced to read a literary classic, and by the end half the class is head over heels in love while the other half is wondering why such a book even exists.
most surprisingly, Janet's tale of her sojourn into the desert and what she found there completely revitalized a character who spent the last two books being a cardboard female version of Grossman himself.
all of those things made me love the book.
fortunately that tendency doesn't rear its ugly head too often.and all of this angst does actually lead to a place that felt shockingly sweet and uplifting: (view spoiler)[a happy ending!
one that revels in the power of the human imagination and the potential for humans to connect in a meaningful, emotional way!
good job, Grossman.
Especially when you graduate, only to have to study for the hardest test of your life (bar exam) and still have zero job prospects.This is all to say that what I'm comparing is Lewis' Chronicles of Narnia to Grossman's Magicians trilogy.
What if that person isn't strong enough to deal with it?And yet somehow, Grossman doesn't make this trilogy as dark and depressing a slog as I'm making it sound like.
(view spoiler)[ I had a hard time with there being no gods at all in the world in the end.
(hide spoiler)]The Magicians trilogy is quite possibly my favorite series of recent years.
He is the High King of Fillory, a magical world that he and a handful of other followers discovered.
Fillory, like the books that inspired it, is about quests.
The Prodigal Son Quentin will have to return.Meanwhile, back on Earth, or really at Brakebills College resides our hapless hero from the first two books...
Well they were on the outs when she perished in the great fight in book one, but still nothing like dying young and having people pining for what would have been.I have one, well maybe two, demon ex-girlfriends, but unlike Quentin I’m not willing to expend any amount of energy, magic, in trying to humanize them.
I had problems with him, too, particularly in the first half of the second book where it seemed that Quentin had regressed, and I would dearly have loved to give him a slap to the back of the head.However, I always had the feeling that Lev Grossman was taking us somewhere with Quentin, and that I couldn’t really know the guy until I knew how he turned out in the end.
Grossman also shifts perspective to several other supporting characters in a variety of circumstances from an attempt to steal a magically protected object to witnessing a final apocalyptic battle in a world tearing itself apart.
Ultimately I think my dissatisfaction came from the fact that Grossman seems to have pulled his punches…and I also noticed some less than satisfactory things from the story as a whole as written in all three books that started to become apparent to me.First off: I really don’t mind that these characters are in many ways ‘unsympathetic’.
I guess I just liked the idea of what Grossman was doing so much that I really wanted a bit more than I feel he delivered.

However, this last book in the series managed to at least end on a hopeful note, if not with a promise of eternal happiness.
After almost ditching the series half way through the first book, I am glad I stuck with it.
Now I wish you all Happy Reading and many more wonderful books to come!!!
Sure he can cast some wicked magic (view spoiler)[and briefly becomes a god (hide spoiler)], but that doesn't change the fact that there is something missing in his humanity.
Not that it was bad, but I'm just disappointed that (view spoiler)[Quentin and Alice got back together and had sort of a happy ending (hide spoiler)].
Maybe I wanted something more cynical than saccharine, more original and gritty as I have come to expect from this writer.PS: I guess I have this tradition of finding a quote from Lev Grossman's books that I think would be extra hilarious if read by Maya Angelou, and here is my choice for this novel:(view spoiler)[ (hide spoiler)]["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>
In fact, I think this book may well have helped me heal a little bit of the pure burning hatred and rage that I have for The Last Battle (of the Narnia series).
In the world of the Magician's those other worlds happen to be real but I don't think Grossman considers the worlds of Harry Potter or Narnia to be any less real or have any less of an affect on our lives as Fillory has on those of the characters in these books.
This story takes us back to places from both of the first two novels, among them Brakebills, the magical college that Quentin Coldwater (the main character) attended, the college that started it all.
This truly is a story of finding one’s way, thus giving the reader a feeling of uncertainty and wonder.This novel takes place around six months after the events in The Magician’s Land.
I don't think I have read a series that has as much character development as in The Magicians trilogy.
It was such a pleasure going on this journey with Quentin and his friends through these three books.
Seeing Quentin grow up in these three books has come at the perfect time in my life.
The themes of this book, and its predecessors, are so relevant to my life.
This is definitely one of my favorite series of all times, and one of my favorite final books in a series.
Strangely enough, I worked through all of my reservations from the previous two books, having liked the first book well enough, and on reflection liking the second one much less, I discovered that passing the hump of the heist in the third allowed me to finally relax into the story after finally realizing that Quentin wasn't going to remain a douchebag forever.The heist was fine, as far as that went, and his just going along with everything and sliding along with his life was par for course.
5 starsbrilliant and witty writing the dark side of all your childhood favorite fantasy storiesA wonderful conclusion to this really fantastic series
Which is a funny thing to say about a book written as well as this one, and that made me as happy as this one did at certain points (really, I would read hundreds of pages about the magic in this universe and how it works and doesn't, no plot required).The thing is, this book doubled down.
Like, this book actually thinks Quentin is interesting (he is, in flashes, but come on, not really).
I really would read Grossman on magic for books and books.
I thought that was quite an unusual and telling comment; I kept thinking about it, because the first book in this trilogy did get a lot of criticism about its sexual politics, some of it deserved (the character arcs) and some not (Quentin's teenage personality).
But it's interesting to me what happens here and how it relates to the first book, in which Quentin behaved extremely badly in his relationship with Alice – behaviour that I thought was clearly intended by the author to be reprehensible but which nevertheless bothered a lot of reviewers.
"He'd been right about the world, but he was wrong about himself. The world was a desert, but he was a magician, and to be a magician was to be a secret spring - a moving oasis. He wasn't desolate, and he wasn't empty. He was full of emotion, full of feelings, bursting with them, and when it came down to it, that's what being a magician was. They weren't ordinary feelings - they weren't the tame, domesticated kind. Magic was wild feelings, the kind that escaped out of you and into the world and
There was a lot of skill to it, and a lot of learning, and a lot of work, but that was where the power began: the power to enchant the world."“This is a feeling that you had, Quentin, she said.
Quentin has been kicked out of Fillory, and he's actually trying to make a go of it in the real world instead of moping around and feeling sorry for himself about how awful everything is.
Like Quentin does with magic, Grossman creates worlds with his emotions, with flicks of his fingers, and I'm so glad that he does.[4.5 stars]
This was the best book in the series and had some of the most entertaining episodes particularly the briefcase.
What I liked was the solid transformation of Quentin from the first book to the last and the episode between him and Alice.
Grossman had a chance to make Janet a truly exciting part of the series but after one anecdote her relevance died.
There wasn't much of a struggle everything just sort of fell into place and once Quentin saved the world the group didn't seem to even acknowledge it.
I mean he just saved the world they gave up on and they couldn't even thank him?
I'm not sure if Lev was trying to deconstruct the fantasy genre or life itself, but he accomplished to do both.
After reading the first novel in Grossman's trilogy, The Magicians, I was hooked.
(Seriously, one of the most disturbing scenes I have ever read.) It left a bad taste, and I was honestly concerned that we were in for round two in The Magician's Land (view spoiler)[(Don't worry, nothing as nearly as upsetting.) (hide spoiler)]Thoughts:- Mid-way through the book I paused, and couldn't help but question- does Grossman hate women?
In fact, I would argue that they're all pretty horrible people, and maybe that's why I struggle with this series: really liked the first novel, but had no affection for any of the characters past that.
***NO SPOILERS***Grossman's third and final installment in The Magicians trilogy brings back all the beloved key players from the previous books, plus a few new ones, but probably won't enthrall fans quite as much as they're expecting.
The previous two books in this trilogy have a much smoother narrative, and they're stronger because of it.Grossman's style is all his own, and the very thing that's great about it is also its downfall at times.
The Magician's Land is told in the third person but shifts very awkwardly when the focus is on a specific character.
Executive Summary: An excellent, but not perfect end to what ended up being a rather enjoyable series. Just a few minor complaints keep me from giving it a 5 star rating. 4.5 stars.Audio book: Mark Bramhall again does an excellent job that makes this a series I think is best done in audio. I will have to be on the lookout for other books he reads for in the future. Full Review This book almost made it to the end to secure one of my rare 5-star ratings.

4.5 stars.Audio book: Mark Bramhall again does an excellent job that makes this a series I think is best done in audio.
It's no wonder to me why so many people are turned away from the series by the first book.The world building and the story is what kept me going until suddenly I realized I had actually become fond of these characters.
I think this keeps in line with Mr. Grossman's frequent injections of "reality" into the series.I don't need all the loose ends to be tied up to find an ending satisfying, and this was definitely that for me.
First read: 2014: Exiled from Fillory, Quentin finds himself searching for purpose.
We see a much more mature Quentin here, one who has definitely come into his own.
Truly exciting to see the maturation.The message of disillusionment in childish things, of putting your past behind you and moving forward, of being your own source of strength is strong in this volume, all hard won lessons for Quentin.
Reread 2016: Audiobook, swirling the story in my head three-fold now.
Book, tv and audiobook have combined into one glorious lump of story.
But the story really got to me here and there and as these young, sometimes nerdy smart misfits grow, and their personalities unfold over 12 or so years, a very real and sometimes harsh coming of age story is told.
Compelling and excellent story that I will always love.I’d go to five stars, but the last book sometimes seemed too edited down, the storylines weren’t always told well enough and there was a little too much kidding around here and there that sometimes took me out of the story into the office of the author who is obviously a clever jokester.
With waiting so long for something I loved so much, I was foolishly prepared for the worst, and happily handed something satisfying and beautiful and far less dark than I was hoping for, but it was for the best.
Quentin has daddy issues, and tries to fix things, and learns his discipline, and saves a life with bacon.
Quentin clings to the past and lets the past go, and though I didn't want it to end, The Magicians trilogy wrapped up as satisfactorily as I could have hoped for, full of snarky Harry Potter references and page-turning set pieces.Second book is still my favorite, though.
I certainly don’t take back my thoughts in my review of The Magicians – I liked the book but I also had some very real issues with it and those still stand – but by God, it’s hard to believe how The Magician King and now The Magician’s Land have managed to completely revive this series for me.We’re at the third and final book at this point, so it’s going to be hard to summarize it without giving away spoilers.
But I felt a lot more positive towards the series with The Magician King, and as the last book of the trilogy, The Magician’s Land was a solid finale.
Despite some seriously cool magical elements, the first two books in the Magicians trilogy seemed more of a dissertation on disillusionment than fantasy fiction.After having finally read the concluding installment in the Magicians trilogy, I have truly fallen in love with Grossman’s work.
Magicians Land preserves that tiny part of childhood that resides in all lovers of fantasy, and it presents itself to the reader in a novel that is extremely hard to put down.Magicians Land is the conclusion to Quentin Coldwater’s story, and it starts where The Magician King, the second book in the series, left off.
