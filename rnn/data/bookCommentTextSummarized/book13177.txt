Its a quite dense tome, and my copy had very tiny type-script lettering but I remember thinking that R.L. must be really smart to have written something like this, I was so impressed by his depth of imagination and flair for the dramatic ( what can I say, I was 13).
Now years later, I'm still impressed, by his flamboyance and blatant over-the-top hero!I keep returning to this book every couple of years, and its like its new again..and I can't help but cast the characters I think should play it because it reads like a movie - albeit an old, Hollywood, CIA-Espionage movie.
A caucasian US Congressman dons dark makeup to pass for an Arab, infilrates a terrorist organization in Oman, convinces them he is a fellow terrorist, and somehow foils their plot.
He then keeps the entire caper a secret until one covert agent recognizes him from a photograph.The only interesting plot involves a secret star chamber-like organization scheming to select the next US President.
Once again logic holds no sway in this universe because the secret organization is apparently risking their lives and reputations for entirely altruistic reasons, with no personal benefit expected or desired from the new administration.Please stay away unless you enjoy smacking your forehead with the palm of your hand every 20 pages.
The first half left me wondering how well the author portrayed the Arab world, but it moved quickly.
The last half was so intriguing and thought provoking that I couldn't put the book down, and it's a very long book!
So often we believe what we read in the news, or possibly WANT to believe, that we miss the disturbing manipulations of hidden people in control.
I see our own government being manipulated by the rich and powerful and feel hopeless in any good resolution.This was a very, very good read.
I'm re-reading Ludlum. He's often copied, borrowed from, outright stolen from, but nobody comes close. He crams more ideas in one book, than any other writer out there. Story unbelievable? Who cares! It is a fun, well written wild ride of a book, and at 770+ pages over all too soon. Nobody does (did) it better. Highy recommended.
a tenth of book).
The writing is static, the characters are asinine (the protagonist is a Caucasian US Congressmen who 1.
speaks a foreign language, 2.
speaks Arabic fluently, and 3.
represents a rural Colorado district -- because you know rural Colorado districts always elect junior politicians that are fluent in Arabic.
And to top it off, the protagonist literally dons skin coloring to look like an Arab and then infiltrates the country of Oman -- ridiculous).
The characterization of the Arab World is appalling.
Don't read this book.
I haven't read all of Ludlum's output, only four (this, the Chancellor manuscript, Trevayne and The Road to Gandolpho).
Interestingly, the only other one that I've read that he wrote under his own name (the Chancellor Manuscript) was also about Inver Brass, that shady organization of high-minded people who intervene when necessary to make the world right.I read this some time ago (it was published in 1988) and the only thing I remember is that was incredibly fast-paced from the get-go - so fast in fact that in ruined other books for me, including those of Ludlum!
Picked up this oldie but goodie on the cheap at a yard sale or something.As I was reading this I thought, "Hmmm, this could make a good movie.
Maybe two movies given the depth." When I finished it I looked around to see if there was a sequel.
What I found was the prequel, currently in production as a movie!
Kept me up well into the night after my plane trip :)* Couldn't finish** I had nothing else to do*** Passed the time, would be **** for genre / author fans**** Everyone could enjoy this book***** Everyone should read this book, I'll read it again
Amazingly convoluted plot, and so loo-o-ong.
By the time I reached page 400, I was crawling on the floor from sheer exhaustion, checking every 30 minutes how many pages I still have to battle through.
(The total in this edition is 678.) More than once, I considered dropping the book, but that would probably have put a hole in the floor (just kidding).
By the time I finished, I was seeing double and my tongue was hanging out of my mouth.Not that it's not a good story with a credible plot and totally believable characters.
But it should really be two separate books.
I keep forgetting that I need to concentrate if I'm planning to read a book by Robert Ludlum. Seem to spend half my time confused about what is going on.Enjoyable book in 2 halves - 1st half concentrates on a crisis in the Middle East and then the 2nd on the repercussions when the hero returns home and is catapulted to the top of political life.
So much for the suspension of disbelief. An unbelievable character in an unbelievable plot doing unbelievable things. I could only get through this novel by treating it as satire, and laughing with the author and publishers who conspired to make the critics believe it was a thriller.
the past's brutal vengeance ......
kendrick sold his business that had made millions in the middle east after an enemy, known only by name, destroyed one of his buildings and withing it over 70 of his employees and their children whom he considered his family remaining anonymous, with the knowledge of the american govt.
however an undercover group have other ideas and he finds that his past is being manipulated into the limelighttgis has devastating effect on those he knows and is close to and also opens a way for him to correct the corruption being caused bu greedy people and arms dealers.
Good read.
Has to be one of the most idiotic books I've ever read.It twists historic events, antisemetic at some points, the dialogues are not natural, the sotry line is not believable, it's not funny when it tries to be and fails to create even for a second.I abondened it the moment I got my hands on a different book.This book is comparable to reality TV. It's THAT stupid.
Mom got me an autographed copy a number of years ago -- well before I appreciated the value of reading.
12/26 I wouldn't have recognized the names of most of the places in this book 30 years ago, when it was written, but with the new world order, I'm becoming too sadly familiar with terrorism and its locales.
Even 20 years later, terrorism hasn't changed much!1/11 This is a long book!
I hope to finish by the end of January!
Good though!1/27 Finished!
Great story about international terrorism that is even more relevant today than it was 30 years ago.
My first Ludlum, which at 900+ pages, was a meaty start (in fact I read a few other books while reading this one).
I was a little nervous there'd be a jingoistic undertone to the story but nope, there is a lot of exploration of all sides, particularly with regards to character development.
Like a few other reviewers I was fairly ho-hum that the blue-eyed lead character, US Congressman Evan Kendrick, would've made a convincing Arab, but I ran with it and I'm glad I did.
Take out the romance angle and there's a good story here. (Please note that this is coming from a romance author so...)
A good, entertaining book and sadly the plot close to what the world is experiencing because of terrorism.
BOOK TWO:In the US, there exist 5 of the most important power brokers that have tapped congressman Evan Kendrick pluck him from obscurity to become a VP candidate in order to assassinate the popular President and make the VP President, Even though Evan wants to just pass time in Congress in obscurity, Inver Brass is pushing him into the spot light.
If you like conspiracy theories, you will like the main story line of this book. Reading reviews before starting this book I was a bit concerned as many people did not like the methods used to advance the story. Yes, there is a lot of improbable and down right impossible things going on, but hey, its fiction. I usually find Ludlum's books hard to get into and while this one was very long (677 pages) it moved right along and most of the dialog was good. I have had problems with his stilted dialog in the past.
Ludlum and Brick!Outstanding. This even lives up to the first three books of the Bourne series. I have yet to listen to the fourth written by another author. Fast paced collection of three books excellently tied together to weave a troubling yarn about the USA. If one is bothered by conspiracy theories one must remember this is fiction. Yet truth is stranger than fiction.Even if one has read the physical book one owes it to oneself to give this a listen. You will not regret it!
Entertaining... not as over the top as a Matthew Reilly story but certainly along the lines of a Raiders of the Lost Ark.. lots of action and twist in the 900+ page book.A great holiday read but don't look for anything to deep.Although written some time ago, current political events make it still relevant.
It's a mystery... not the genre, the writing. Pretty well developed characters, not a multitude of similar ones, good pacing, plenty of action in varied locales, intrigue but not so convoluted it's impenetrable, logical dialogue... why did it take me a month to read this? Heard the same thing from the person who told me about it.
Very good book - thoroughly enjoyed. Didn't read quite to the end as the resolution I sought was before the very end of the book, and I wasn't so enthused to get to the very end (short attention span/impatience). Defs recommend for a quick and enthralling read.
A little long, but a good book.
