A travelogue of Lane's first trip to Albania in 1921 -- before there were any automobiles in the country -- a walking tour into the formidable mountains with two lady friends, a twelve-year old interpreter, two mountain guides, and the undercover Secretary of the Interior for the brand-new government.
Putting aside Lane's Libertarian politicking and the thoughtless arrogance of the time, this was a pretty fascinating read and certainly a unique portrait of Albania at that time.
- Alexander the Great was Albanian, as were most of the Greek myths!
- Albanians hate Serbs.
The Peaks of Shala; by Rose Wilder Lane; profusely illustrated by photographs taken on a special expedition to Albania.
