This book is F-A-N-T-A-S-T-I-C !!! Maybe you haven't recognized the name of the author, but this Hugh Laurie is THE Hugh Laurie who was the star on the TV series House, M.D..Sure, maybe some of you would say "So what? He is an actor but can he write?" Oh, yes! He CAN write! Pain is an event. It happens to you, and you deal with it in whatever way you can. If you ever watched some episode of House, M.D. you can be familiarized with the personality of the character that Laurie portraited there, a
The novel has a lot of combined genres, since you will find a detective novel merging into a espionage story, with a lot of military and politics stuff.Each character, main or minor, has a purpose and one of the best things is that at some moments you will meet a really main character without realizing it, until the story would develop more, it will be when you would know it.In my opinion, this book is the ones that when one is reading it, one thinks "Geez!
I picked up this book BECAUSE I love Hugh Laurie, but I didn't really have high expectations.
I was not prepared for this book to blow my socks off and make me read it in dribs and drabs, as my friend would say, because I just didn't want it to end.
And it's quite a ride, be sure of that.It's been a long time since I've read about a character that I loved as much as Thomas Lang.
This book is funny and smart and all that, but it really straddles the line between that and uncomfortable - because Laurie uses humor and satire and parody extremely well to showcase quite a few things about our world and ourselves that are uncomfortable, unsettling, and in the end, not as much funny as disturbing.
His humor serves as a defense mechanism in this book that should not be funny, but is using humor and parody as a weapon."Because what does it mean, to say that things aren't going well?
This book restored my faith in celebrity novels.
I already knew he was a brilliant actor (I'm midway through The Night Manager, and his performance is sending shivers down my spine), a comic genius and a super blues musician, so he is way more multi-talented than most of us.
This book is an action thriller, which is not my usual fare.
I suspect he has a great comic novel in him, in which case I'll be at the head of the readers queuing up.
But if he writes another action novel I'll still be jostling for a good position.
Thanks to Chris for turning me on to this fun romp. Every now & then I'd just bust out laughing & it kept me up past my bed time to finish it. Random, odd, & meandering as it seems at times, the humor was a constant thread & I found that everything really was spot on. If the story occasionally took the long way around the barn, it was only so we'd sneak up on something unexpected.It's at least a 3 star thriller & is written so perfectly in Laurie's voice that I could hear &am
If the story occasionally took the long way around the barn, it was only so we'd sneak up on something unexpected.It's at least a 3 star thriller & is written so perfectly in Laurie's voice that I could hear & see him the entire time, which easily gains it another star in my book.
This is mostly written in his comedic voice - snarky & not so dark as his House character.
About half way through, I wondered how there could still be so much to read - I thought I was closing in on an obvious, if not great ending - but I wasn't.
I didn't pay any attention to the author's name...and I'm glad I didn't because I likely wouldn't have read it.
The statistician prodded a calculator and informed the man that the odds against there being a bomb on board the next flight he took were half a million to one.
So the statistician said ‘the odds against there being two, separate, unrelated bombs on board your next flight are exactly ten million to one against.’ The man looked puzzled, and said ‘that’s all well and good, but how does it help me?’ The statistician replied: ‘It’s very simple.
A lot of comedians were publishing novels back then – Hugh's friend Stephen Fry had already done The Liar in 1991 (which was great – the book, that is, not the year), and before that I think it all started with Ben Elton's Stark in 1989, which I never got around to.
Comedian-lit was a weird genre and not one, to be honest, that has produced many great writers; David Baddiel is probably the most talented.
Not sure why that stuck in my head, but I think of it all the time when I'm in the car.
Some of my favorites included his observation that hiding behind the warehouse walls was not a good idea "since the walls were no more than an inch of Gyproc plaster board, and probably couldn't have stopped a cherry-stone squeezed from the fingers of a tired three-year-old." Also, his philosophical thoughts on the use of the term bird strike: "This, rather unfairly in my view, made it sound as if it was the bird's fault; as if the little feathered chap had deliberately tried to head-butt twenty tons of metal travelling in the opposite direction at just under the speed of sound, out of spite." Amusing and sometimes laugh out loud funny, it's worth the read and will probably most appreciated by people familiar with the spy genre.
Hugh Laurie has only written one novel, but I hope there are more to come after his near perfect debut, The Gun Seller.Laurie takes a fairly standard "dirty CIA" story (ala Jason Bourne), tosses in some Wodehousian humour, takes the p*ss out of modern politics and democracy, builds suspense with some cracking chases, gun fights and 007-style violence, philosophizes about how the genitalia of modern men and women resemble and behave like FIATs and Volvos (respectively), offers thorough walking tours of London and Prague, and manages to come out the other end with a bang-on modern entertainment that bridges genres and expectations.It isn't Booker Prize material, and thank God for that.
The Gun Seller is a strange book, in a way.
About a quarter of the way in though, it seems like it occurs to Laurie that he actually has some storytelling to do, and sets about doing it.
I suppose this may have been intentional on Laurie's part, but that doesn't make it less frustrating.
The last chapter pretty much ties everything together, to my relief; it felt for a while that Laurie didn't know himself where all of this was going.
Overall it was an enjoyable and satisfying read, and definitely one of the funniest books I've ever read.
Laurie is obviously one talented guy.
Prošlo je skoro četiri mjeseca od pročitane knjige, no osjećam se isto kao i onda kada je se sjetim. - JES, pročitala sam je! :-) No, kako sam ju zatvorila, tako sam ju zaboravila. Ono što je u knjizi dobro, je naslovnica i to što sam pametnoga doznala o talentiranom Dr. House-u, gospodin Hugh Laurie! Tip genijalac, ali ovo mu definitivno nije trebalo. Naporno, dosadno, zbrkano, nebitno.. Za preskakanje savršeno!
8/10"House" dizisinin baş oyuncusu, "House"u "House" yapan o karizmatik oyuncu Hugh Laurie'nin ilk kurgu kitabı Silah Tüccarı.Son sayfasına dek, heyecanla ve yüzümde kocaman bir gülümsemeyle okudum.
Çok iyi bir çeviri okuyacağınıza garanti veriyorum: Övgü İçten'in zihni dert bulmasın harika bir çeviri yapmış.Çevirinin niteliğine küçük bir kanıt:Özgün metin:"The other passers-by were almost certainly hearing ‘Reeded In Silly Shut Up’, but I hardly had to glance at the poster to know that he meant ‘Three Dead In City Shoot-Up.’ I bought a copy and read as I walked."Çeviri:"Yoldan geçenler büyük ihtimalle 'Şehriyenin Çatısı Göçürüldü' diye anlıyorlardı, ama ben gazetenin ana sayfasına baktığımda başlığın 'Şehir Çatışmasında Üç Ölü' olduğunu gördüm."

Audiobook review: the book started out strong, but got very tedious by the 2/3 point. Imagine watching a Mr. Bean marathon. Funny at first, but by the sixth hour, it's driving you up the wall. I think it's probably the format, and I might go back and read (not listen) this one someday.
Really good book, very dark and funny. Like if PG Wodehouse wrote political thrillers.
Hugh Laurie is a talented guy. I read this because I loved House MD and I wanted to know what he can do more. The book was ok but the action dragged at some points.
The Gun Seller isn’t like that: from the very first page, Laurie makes it clear that this is a tongue-in-cheek, semi-absurd story that leverages the best of the dry humour I appreciate in my British comedy.Thomas Lang is a hired gun—though for what, Laurie never bothers to make clear.
And there are both British and American antagonists, and Laurie does a good job differentiating between the two in terms of attitude, behaviour, and dialogue.Thomas Lang’s voice is an even more compelling component than the characters.
The Gun Seller avoids this pitfall—this isn’t really a love story, despite the appearance to the contrary at the first.Indeed, what most impressed me about this book was its unpredictability.
Cynical, wry freelance soldier of fortune Thomas Lang is hired to kill a man, but being a nice chap, refuses the money and goes to warn the intended victim.
His discovery that the victim, an American industrialist, is also the man who hired him is only the beginning of a series of bizarre surprises and twists in store for Lang, as he is reluctantly involved in a plot to instigate a terrorist act so that a new attack helicopter can be tested out in actual combat.
It’s a very funny book in places, and the plot is wonderfully convoluted, with real drama near the end.
I had to stop reading The Gun Seller around 1am, halfway through it, and believe me, the ONLY thing stopping me from reading to the end was an unfortunate dearth of eyelids propper-uppers, a la A Clockwork Orange.It is LITERALLY laugh-out-loud funny.
Apparently it was immediately optioned as a screenplay; that never went anywhere, but I bet you dollars to doughnuts (WHAT does that phrase MEAN???) he could not only get it made today, but nab the leading role to boot (and what does THAT phrase mean?).
This was a clever send up of the spy genre, but if Hugh Laurie were not working so hard to be clever
ΜΗΝ ΠΑΣ ΠΟΤΕ ΣΤΗΝ ΚΑΖΑΜΠΛΑΝΚΑ, του Χίου ΛόριΔεν ξέρω γιατί μας αποτρέπει ο συγγραφέας να πάμε στην Καζαμπλάνκα.
Είναι αστυνομικό, είναι κατασκοπικό, είναι περιπέτεια, αλλά πάνω και πριν απ' όλα, είναι κωμικό, χωρίς να είναι κωμωδία!Κι αν ο Φίτσεκ διχάζει, νομίζω ότι ο Λόρι θα διχοτομήσει!Ο Χιού Λόρι είναι ένας απίθανος story teller, που με το βιβλίο του με κράτησε 2 μερόνυχτα άυπνη.
Κάθε λέξη, κάθε φράση είναι αμείλικτα κοφτερή και σου αφήνει στο στόμα την αψάδα του καυτερού τσίλι.
Αυτό που ξέρω όμως είναι ότι, προτίθεμαι να την ξεκινήσω πάραυτα!Για να κλείσω, θα πω ότι είναι ένα βιβλίο που ή θα λατρέψετε ή θα σιχαθείτε.
Laurie has taken plot elements from spy novels and, discarding Flemming's often wooden prose (have you ever read a Bond book?
There's a reason there's not a huge market for them) he infects the whole thing with the humor and energy of a Wodehouse book, and keeps a lovely dark underbelly to the whole thing, because he is a comedian and the one thing comedians do better than anyone else is look at the downside of things.Thomas Lang, once of the British Military Complex but now a sort of free spirit muscle-for-hire, is offered quite a bit of cash to assassinate an American businessman.
I wasn't particularly interested in the story, though it did intrigue me.
In all honesty, I picked it up because Hugh Laurie wrote it and I love him.
(More specifically, I love Robert Sean Leonard who stars with Hugh Laurie on 'House', but has not actually written a book so this was the best I could do...) This, I have discovered, is the wrong reason to read a book.
Perhaps it's my scatterbrained disposition at the moment, but I just had a hard time following the story and in the end, I just didn't care.
I do, however, still love Robert Sean Leonard and, by association, Hugh Laurie.
***2018 Summer of Spies*** May I say that I am pleasantly surprised at the quality of Mr. Laurie’s novel? One hopes that a famous name doesn’t get a mediocre book published. Laurie may be well known from his stint on TV as Dr. House, but this book was published on its own merit.The author takes the spy genre and turns it inside out. Neither a tough guy nor a super-smart guy, the hero is an everyman with persistence and a sense of humour. Like Bond, he can fall in love with a woman with one meet
***2018 Summer of Spies***
May I say that I am pleasantly surprised at the quality of Mr. Laurie’s novel?
One hopes that a famous name doesn’t get a mediocre book published.
Laurie may be well known from his stint on TV as Dr. House, but this book was published on its own merit.The author takes the spy genre and turns it inside out.
Like Bond, he can fall in love with a woman with one meeting of the eyes, but he is much more realistic about his chances of her returning the feeling.Laurie’s love of Wooster and Jeeves shines through the narrative.
Aside from the bits of humor, it read like a pretty standard 'guy gets in over his head, people think he knows more than he does, so he tries to find the bad guys both for his self-preservation and the hot thang he 'falls in love with' after 5 minutes of staring at her legs'.
I know it's meant to be a parody, so the over-the-top aspects of the story are meant to be a send-up of the genre, but I didn't find it funny so much as tedious.
📕📕📕 Η άποψη μου 📕📕📕Τίτλος : Μην πας ποτέ στην Καζαμπλάνκα Εγώ πήγα και έχω να σας πω ότι είχα ένα ταξίδι γεμάτο ίντριγκες,δράση,και περίπλοκες καταστάσεις .Ο Χιου Λόρι ο γνωστός σε όλους μας τηλεοπτικός χαρακτήρας από την τηλεοπτική σειρά House MD είναι ο συγγραφέας του βιβλίου και διαβάζοντας το ένιωθα ότι ο ήρωας,ήταν ο ίδιος χαρακτήρας.
Μια πένα ξεχωριστή ένα βιβλίο που κατάφερε να δημιουργήσει την δικιά του μοναδική κατηγορία !Σας το συστήνω ανεπιφύλακτα και σας λέω πολύ απλά ότι θα το λατρέψετε !Του βάζω 5/5⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️Σύνοψη του βιβλίου "Μην πας ποτέ στην Καζαμπλάνκα"Ο Τόμας Λανγκ είναι ένας παλιός στρατιωτικός που φυτοζωεί στο Λονδίνο καταναλώνοντας ουίσκι και τριγυρνώντας με την αγαπημένη του μοτοσικλέτα.
Laurie also finds time to pepper the book with his protagonists charming philosophizing, like this when he's discussing why it is he thinks he is isn't in a relationship:"[Men and women] want different things.
Men want to have sex with a woman.
Then they want to have sex with another woman.
Women," and I thought I'd better pick my words a little more carefully when describing a gender I didn't belong to, "want a relationship.
They may not get it, or they may sleep with a lot of men before they do get it, but ultimately that's what they want.
“Death and disaster are at our shoulders every second of our lives, trying to get at us.”I will try to prevent my adoration of the brilliant Hugh Laurie affect my review of his first (and, to date, only) published novel, but I will admit that it was the only reason I was initially interested in reading The Gun Seller.
I can’t say I’m an expert on spy novels (or their spoofs), but I do think this offering from Laurie is worthy of a read for fans of the genre, or for those appreciative of intelligent, dry humor.
I have a piece of advice for you if you decide to read this book (which you should):Do not read it in an elevator, on a bus, in a hotel lobby, in a hospital waiting room, in the car when you're a passenger (or when you're the driver, for a more obvious reason), while standing in line at the bank/grocery store/customer service desk, while standing round waiting for the mechanics to finish with your oil change, at school, at work, or any other public arena where people can observe you.Why, you may ask?
The author is that Hugh Laurie.If you've been reading these reviews of mine, you know I'm pretty tight with a buck when it comes to Kindle books.
I love to troll through kinlib.com looking for promising freebies and I rarely buy a Kindle book priced higher than $4.99.
And this book is priced pretty steepishly at $8.25.
if you download the free sample, as I did, and read it, as I did, I'll bet you end up parting with that $8.25, as I did.What a terrific book.
Разбира се, има доста хумор в него, но в същото време натоварва по някакъв начин, с всичките тези негови мисли.
А книгата е в първо лице, така че мислите му са навсякъде.Същевременно действието върви по някакъв начин мъчително бавно и интересът се губи някъде след първите 60 страници.
Началото си го бива иначе, но после удоволствието бавно започва да се свива, докато всичко не ти стане някак еднообразно.Нещо като плюс е, че не можеш да разграничиш героя от реалния Хю Лори.
Лошото е, че не можеш да си представиш Лори от добрите, особено ако си го гледал вече в онзи сериал по романа на Каре...
