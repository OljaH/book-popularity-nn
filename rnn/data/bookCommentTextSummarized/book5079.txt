First published in Fantastic Universe (January, 1954), this strange little story about a bad marriage, an adulterous liaison, and a little birdie who lives in a cuckoo clock and just may have a mind of its own, is just—for want of a better term—kinda “dumb”.
Taken as a whole, it feels like a third-rate episode from a half hour 50’s anthology TV show: Alfred Hitchcock Presents, or maybe The Twilight Zone.Still, I have to admit I enjoyed it.
Dick—who sometimes sincerely believed household objects were conspiring against him—gives this story a genuinely paranoid atmosphere.
Quite qUiRkY!
I got this short story for free in my e-book reader application. I think even short stories are ought to be well written. This one failed to satisfy my taste. The language is poor, the end is predictable, and the characters are lame (well, except for the cuckoo in the clock which had a more interesting character). However, I've read worse before.
For Doris the clock is an experience tied to memory ("like my mother had") and to desire.
Larry sees his wife, Bob, and the clock as forming a triangle of desire: "They would be quite happy together, Bob and Doris and the cuckoo".
Doris may be following a law of her nature even more stifling and imperious than Larry's mechanical routine, and more dangerous;Doris feels her reactions are fair self-defence against Larry's patriarchal monologue: "After all, she couldn't keep listening to him forever without defending herself; you had to blow your own trumpet in the world".
The strangeness of ordinary. Things.
It is based on a tongue-in-cheek idea when Larry gives his wife Doris a German cuckoo clock as a present to patch up the fissures showing on the veneer of their relationship, and when we later find out that Larry is actually a cuckold.
Which leaves Larry clueless because after all, Doris got what she wanted, and shouldn’t she be happy?You already see that the characters may be drawn from real life and that their problems are such as every reader might have experienced themselves, to a stronger or lesser degree.

I piss on these reviews. This was a fun, creepy, and interesting short story about a possessed cuckoo clock.
قرأتها باللغة الصينية على تطبيق يتيح معرفةمعنى الكلمة ونطقها بمجرد الضغط عليها وهو ما سهل قراءتها كثيرا بالمقارنة مع ما كنت أضطر إليه من نسخ الكلمة والبحث عن معناها في القاموس وما يتبعه من الانتقال من نافذة إلى أخرى...انتقال حعلني أعزف مؤخرا عن متابعة التعلموكانت هذه السهولة هي الميزة الوحيدة في القصة أما غير هذا فلم أجد لها أي قيمةمن المؤسف أنها كانت القصة الوحيدة في التطبيق
Truly and simply remarkable!
সায়েনস ফিকশানের পরতি কখনোই তেমন আগরহ ছিলো না। "বিজঞানযাতরা"- নামক ফেসবুক পেইজে সায়েনস ফিকশন লেখক হিসেবে ফিলিপ কে. ডিক কে পরিচয় করিয়ে দেওয়ার পর তাঁর লেখা নিয়ে আগরহী হয়ে উঠি।তাঁর লেখা পরথম পড়া গলপ, "Beyond the doors"। লযারি তার সতরীর জনয কিনে আনে এক পাখির এলারম দেওয়া ঘড়ি, ঘনটা পড়লেই কাঠের পাখি দরজা খুলে বেরিয়ে এসে গান শুনিয়ে যায়। কখনো কি ভেবে দেখেছেন, এই কাঠের পাখির ও থাকতে পারে মানুষের মতো অনুভূতি, নিবিড়ভাবে পরযবেকষণ করতে পারে মানুষের নিতযদিনের সংসার?অনতত আমি ভাবিনি। আর এখানেই লেখকের সারথকতা। এমন

I do wish a few things had been flushed out a little more but over all I found this to be an enjoyably creepy tale. The use of the cuckoo clock was superb and I definitely look forward to reading more work by Philip K. Dick.
I'm quite torn between appreciating the story but not really liking it.I sympathize with Larry, who was a bit the antagonist in the story (or was he not?). But then I decided to simply tribute my torn feeling as a Philip K. Dick thing.
one is a psychopath and the other is a sociopath. or is it vice versa? or are they both a combination of the two?
It is 'low fantasy' in which a cuckoo clock intrudes into a troubled marriage and becomes an actor in a drama that is essentially about a male bully.Once again we see Dick's 'simpatico' attitude towards women but, although the characterisation is good, the plot hangs on a thread because Dick is not good at the atmosphere, required in a fantasy story, that would permit the suspension of belief necessary to allow a wilful cuckoo clock to exist.
Good science fiction requires plot and characterisation and above all 'ideas'.
Fantasy needs atmosphere which science fiction does not.
I think all you can do after reading this is very carefully set down your cup of tea, sit quietly for a bit, and then tidy the hell out of your house.Reads like something he wrote for a magazine when he was broke; a great example of an unsettling low-fantasy short story, but nothing mind-blowing. Save it for a bus ride where you have to actually pay attention to the stops.
Short story about a cuckoo clock - actually a great example of storytelling, in cramming a lot into just a few pages. Doesn't really compare to Electric Sheep but it does have a questionable mechanical bird.
As short as it is poignant. Another fine short story from Mr. K. Dick. It's nice to have such good science fiction to read, though I imagine I can thank my less than thorough exploration of the genre for that.
A Strange Science Fiction. Short Story!Philip K. Dick scores again with a short story that is bound to leave you more than a little shaken. Do we really have nothing to fear from little hand made machines?
Nothing really special, would've given 2.5.
Clever short story account a malignant cuckoo clock
Hope his books are better ))
Heh Heh Heh, brilliant short story
Curioso relato, alejado de la obra de Dick. Sin mucho más que decir de él.
Quirky and captivating.
It's a pretty horrible story about a husband and wife with martial problems and a cuckoo clock with a mind of its own.
Another horror-type story. Reminded me of Stephen King. About an under-appreciated cuckoo-clock. :)
Reminded me of the twilight zone more than sci fi, but PKD has always skirted the line between the genres. Fucked up ending.
My first audio short story.Perfect for ironing companion. 😆
What a creepy little story. I loved it! It had the feel of one of Grimm's fairy tales, though set in the modern USA.
