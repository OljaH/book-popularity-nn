My four year old loved it!
Especially the bits where the croc is going to eat and munch all those sweet juicy children.
:) NOM NOM NOM NOM NOM.I think this is just one of those things natural to all children who already feel like prey with all these nasty adults hanging around.
It's NATURAL!That being said, this croc plays lots of nasty and cruel tricks in order to fill his belly, but fortunately, he happens to piss off most of the jungle creatures on his way to his playground meal ticket.Alas!
Poor stupid croc!
Right-On!I love BBQ.
Also, I have quite some catching up to do since I missed out on them when I was a child.The story is the titular enormous crocodile who is a very nasty and evil croc that likes to eat children.
The animal-lover in me doesn't like that very much because crocs, much like sharks, have far too bad a reputation which is why many are endangered.
My year of Roald Dahl is still going!The Enormous Crocodile loves to eat plump, juicy little child, and he wants to eat as many as he can. But when the other animals in the jungle join together to put an end to this, the Enormous Crocodile learns a lesson he won't soon forget.
Off goes the Enormous Crocodile, into the African jungles, where he encounters many other animals and tells them of his fiendish plan.
Armed with the knowledge of the Enormous Crocodile's plan, the jungle animals do all they can to foil it, but will they be too late?!
A wonderfully amusing read for children and adults alike that keeps the reader on their toes throughout.Dahl is a wonderful storyteller, even if the tales can sometimes flirt with the edge of the macabre.
I hope to keep reading a collection of your work and finding new gems about which I can be proud.Like/hate the review?
I love Roald DahlHis imagination is just out of this world!
بامزه اما سطحی بود.
This big crocodile is hungry for some children and has the perfect plan to get them - or does he? He makes several other jungle animals very angry with him and they attempt to thwart his child-eating ways. This just goes to show, if you are planning something evil, do  not  monologue!Blog | Instagram | Twitter
You mash it and munch it,You chew it and crunch it!It’s lovely to hear it go squish!”[image error]The Enormous Crocodile is on a mission… to find some children to munch.
The Enormous Crocodile gets more and more frustrated as he gets more and more hungry.
(view spoiler)[Warning: No children were actually eaten in this book.
(hide spoiler)]So, I’ve been on a Roald Dahl kick lately so one random Saturday morning I decided I wanted to read it.
It’s definitely not my favorite of his that I’ve read so far, but it was still funny and the pictures were enjoyable.
That was a funny one, the enormous crocodile isn't as clever as he thought he was :D he should've kept his mouth shut instead of bragging about his plans, so he ended up barbecued :D
Fun, classic Dahl and good to teach river/jungle animals.
So funny! I laughed out loud - sorry fellow library dwellers 😊I’d adore reading this to a Year 1 class and making them all giggle.
The Enormous Croc is not as smart as he thinks he is.
He has all kinds of clever plans to catch a juicy child or two for his lunch.
So when he tries all his ruses to fool the children, Humpy-Rumpy the Hippo and Trunky the Elephant and Muggle-Wump the Monkey and the Roly-Poly Bird rush to the rescue and foil his plans before he can snatch any kids.
Finally, Trunky winds him up and sends him rocketing off into space, where he crashes into the sun and gets sizzled up like a sausage.
No more Enormous Crocodile.
I don't think I've ever read anything by Roald Dahl that I didn't like. I am thrilled that my soon to be 4 year old daughter is now old enough to hear his stories at bedtime. We started with the Enormous Crocodile because it was short, illustrated, and new to us (the parents). It was a great read-aloud book! Our daughter wanted to know what would happen next and really enjoyed the story of the wicked crocodile on the hunt to eat up small children. A solid introduction to quirky stories and great writing!
My middle daughter recommended I read this book, and I can see why. The jumble of entertaining adjectives makes this great fun for an imaginative 7-year-old – and a less imaginative 35-year-old. The end was a little abrupt, but overall this is classic Dahl: fun, witty and a little dangerous.

The story grew repetitive after awhile as the crocodile's plans and tricks always get thwarted at the last minute, and that last scene is a real killer (literally!), but Stephen Fry's exuberant narration definitely made it worth sitting through.
what a lovely story. when i am reading this i can imagine children eyes wide open with excitement. and how clever trick from enormous crocodile indeed.
The story was the usual greedy animal, using tricks to fill its stomach. The various animals at the beginning added some fun, but after that I found the tricks too much unrealistic to be really pleasant. Blake's art was fun to follow, however there were too many white children pictured for a book set in Africa.
Roald Dahl's 'The Enormous Crocodile' is scary, funny, and moral; three very important ingredients for a good children's book.
He began to dribble with excitement." Onomatopoeic words such as "squish", "crunch" and "gollop" make this book perfect for reading aloud to a class, whilst encouraging children to really annunciate.
The underlying message of good triumphing over evil makes this an untimely tale, which can be read generation after generation.The contextual world of the book is kindly and protective.
Each of the creatures the crocodile discomforts, elephant, monkey and bird, intercede to protect the children and thwart this evil intent.
I will never forget the picture of the crocodile dressing up as a palm tree. It had me laughing for hours!
Η πάλη του καλού και του κακού και η αντίθεση δύναμης-πονηριάς αποτελούν τον κεντρικό άξονα αυτού του εξωτικού παραμυθιού του 'μάγου' Νταλ.Βαθμολογία: 4,2/5 ή 8,4/10.
One of my most beloved books as a child. The one I made my parents read over and over again. Must have the Quentin Blake illustrations, too!
B.R.A.CE. 2017 ένα βιβλίο που θα έπρεπε να έχεις διαβάσει στο σχολείο  Καθώς το διάβαζα σκεφτόμουν πόσο καλογραμμένο είναι και πόσο γνήσια παιδικό και εκπαιδευτικό.
Dan ia pun menjalankan rencana-rencananya.Rencana pertama adalah dengan berpura-pura menjadi pohon kelapa, berdiri dengan ekornya, terus kaki depan memegang buah kelapa dan mulutnya penuh dengan dahan kelapa yang berhasil diambilnya...demi untuk menjebak anak-anak kecil yang memang sangat tertarik melihat pohon kelapa yang aneh, tapi rencananya yang ini digagalkan oleh teman Kudanilnya si Humpy-Rumpy yang menabraknya hingga jatuh, maka berlarian kaburlah anak-anak kecil tersebut.Rencana kedua adalah berpura-pura menjadi jungkat-jungkit disebuah taman bermain dengan meletakkan tubuhnya melintang pada sebuah batang pohon.
Dan seorang anak kecil bernama Jill sangat tertarik menaiki komedi putar yang berbentuk buaya tersebut, tapi saat hendak manaikinya datanglah Burung Roly-Poly yang berteriak pada Jill untuk tidak naik ke buaya karena itu buaya betulan.
This book appears to be aimed at a slightly younger age group than his other bestselling stories.
It’s fairly short at sixty pages and the story arc is rather simplistic.
I think that this would be a great book for introducing adjectives early on in key stage two.
All of the animal characters really come to life due to Dahl’s vivid descriptions and the repetitive story structure would help to retain the adjectives in the child’s mind.
Quentin Blake’s illustrations of the crocodile in various states of disguise are particularly beguiling and the menacing nature of the story should ensure an enraptured audience.

Another one of my Dahl collection. Read this to both boys and they were in love. Téo has already had me read it again and both boys acted out the Enormous Crocodile and his clever tricks immediately following the book. Hilarious. A little disconcerting to read out loud the crocodile dying at the end to a 2 and 6 year old. Dahl certainly his dark streak.
Its scary for little kids, especially for girls
Well it wasn't as funny as Dahl's other books.. Didn't like it much..
One of my all time favorite children's authors. I love Roald Dahl and I loved this book. It, along with his other books, turned my reluctant third grade read into an avid reader.
