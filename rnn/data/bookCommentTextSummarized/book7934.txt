I have heard of this classic previously but have not had the opportunity to read it until now. Having thus finished the book, there were parts of the book that was profitable for me spiritually.Among the thing that convicted me was the chapter on â€œThe Leader and His Timeâ€, particularly this quote: â€œWe have each been entrusted with sufficient time to do the whole will of God and to fill out His perfect plan for our livesâ€ (114). The author Oswald Sanders gave examples of Godly men whose gre
Christians who doubt this should read some of the benefits of reading that Sanders listed.Sanders also discussed the importance for Christian leaders to be continiously improving their leadership in chapter fourteen.
The book ends with a short chapter on the Christian example of leadership found in the character of Nehemiah.
This is a fitting devotional to end the book with, with an example of someone to emulate from the Bible, and Sanders touches on various aspects of his leadership that ought to be modeled in the life of contemporary Christian leaders as well.
An excellent book on principles that every Christian should strive for, not just those wanting to be leaders.
So if you're looking for guidance as a Christian, searching for an answer, or even just entertaining the idea of being a leader, this book will help.
Sanders gives each chapter a clear cut quality and how to obtain it and what to look for.
No excessive preaching or chapters overladen so heavily with verse that you'd be better off reading the bible in this book.
I highly encourage all Christians to read this book.
I think that the things in here are generally ok in terms of what's said - it's a collection of 1-2 page "observations" or "meditations" on small leadership principles.
If you're looking for a sort of devotional book or a vague book about how to apply some generally true (regardless of religious affiliation) ideas with biblical language behind them, this book is fine.But it's precisely that vagueness that kills me.
The context or setting of that scripture is irrelevant.
There's no attempt to put the scriptures in their original context.
It's the worst kind of biblical study - the kind that just uses the bible to support what we already think of.
Spiritual leadership is an amazing book with tremendous insight on what a Spiritual Leader is.
As you work thru the book you start with how being a Spiritual Leader is an honorable ambition and work thru qualifications and then lifestyle choices and imperatives that should be the ear mark of a Spiritual Leader.
This book would be great for anyone who is seeking a place of leadership, has been acting in a leadership position, runs a company built on the principles of God or even desires to know more about the life a Spiritual Leader genuinely comes to.
One of my favorite short paragraphs of this book: “Leadership training cannot be done on a mass scale. It requires patient, careful instruction and prayerful, personal guidance over considerable time. “Disciples are not manufactured wholesale. They are produced one by one, because someone has taken the pains to discipline, to instruct and enlighten, to nurture and train one that is younger.””
Excellent book.
ExcepcionalMe encanta la practicidad y profundidad del libro así como la riqueza de su contenido y referencias bibliográficas. Recomendado 100%
I believe in the value of study and I think the biblical character named Nehemiah is a phenomenal model for good leadership—better in many ways than Moses or David, though those two paradigms had their own strengths (and weaknesses) during a particular time in the history of God’s people.
Sanders really began to get my attention when, instead of the one verse I continually used to talk about Nehemiah’s role in raising morale, he cited four different mottos, prayers, or praise songs that Nehemiah used (2:20; 4:14; 4:20; and 8:10).
I am really enjoying going through this book with my Pastor as a type of discpileship training, but the one thing that I really do not like is that Moody Publishers take the liberty to add, subtract, and even completely change the content.
They preface the changes with the hope of making the book more understandable via modernazation, but in some cases they just completely change what was said.
I love the book, but would love to have access to the original, unedited version.
The newer the version of this book you have, the more alterations you will find.
One of my favorite books of the year I’ve read! As I’m training to be a missionary this book was a capsulized version of every missionary leadership quality I’ve been taught elsewhere, so wise and helpful. Biggest part that I love is how practical and spiritual it is, the emphasis on missions is wonderful and finally pushing being a servant and not just a manager when you lead.
should read again....and again and again
A leadership classic. I had never read it before, and it is fantastic. Anyone in ministry or business leadership would benefit from this book.
This was one of the most helpful and insightful reads on leadership I've found to date!
I LOVE THIS BOOK~ This book is an excellent resource for leadership. Every serious Christian should read this. This was a library book. But I am going to buy it.
But, I do think that is the way this book is supposed to be read.
For anyone who has done other reading on Christian leadership many of the concepts covered will not be new.
However, I think one of the distinctive features of this book is the intensity of Christian leadership.
As Sanders says in the final word, it is easy to feel overwhelming by the call to leadership, but that is because if it was easy everybody would be doing it.
It is meant to be read repeatedly and I plan to do so.
Oswald Sanders on the topic of leadership from a Christian perspective.
This is the kind of book that needs to be read slowly, preferably not more than 1 chapter a day, as the topics within each chapter are quite varied and require personal reflection in order to get the most benefit out of them.
This book is great for believers who are either going into ministry or seeking a christian perspective on genuine leadership skills.
Because each chapter was originally a talk Sanders gave, sometimes the chapters end rather abruptly, and it occasionally almost appears to ramble on certain topics, as can occasionally happen when giving a live speech.
This classic further pinpoints the goal of christian living, which is missions and soul-winning; it does this by revealing the passion and motivations of great christian leaders of the past; men and women who invested their lives for the cause of Jesus Christ and his Kingdom.
We must therefore in this age be focused on what has always made the great leaders of the past out of ordinary men and women- a heart for God and the expansion of his kingdom.Personally speaking, though I have been living by many of the truths highlighted in this book, I am more determined to make my life count for God and his many purposes on the earth.
Less successful as a book than as a patchwork of aphorisms, quotations, nuggets of wisdom, anecdotes, and whatnot.
Came from a series of addresses, and indeed reads as such.
Sometimes Sanders' use of the biblical text is rather arbitrary and decontextualised, but his heart is definitely in the right place.
Through Sanders' extensive mining of pious biographies of Christian leaders (most often nonconformists of the the 19th and 20th centuries) one gets a glimpse of a more sober, more self-effacing series of worlds than one is used to today.
This book was recommended to me by my Bible Study Fellowship Teaching Leader, Lisa Bate, and it was very beneficial!
Even though it was originally published 50 years ago, the principles shared are timeless and very relevant.
A key message is that while leadership is challenging, spiritual leadership is even more demanding.
I especially appreciated the biblical references to inspirational leaders: Moses, Nehemiah, and Paul.
Oswald Sanders provides great questions for reflection at the end of each chapter as well as a guide at the end of the book that would be beneficial for group study.
I thought this was a very good, clear and readable book on Christian Leadership.
The author takes various topics and spends a few pages delving into each.
I would say that it is only introductory.
There is a wide range of topics covered in this book, but the price of a wide scope is a shallow depth.
However, what you will find in the pages is encouragement in leadership, rebuke in wrongdoing, and writing that tantalizes the tastebuds of your mind causing you to want to delve deeper and seek more information about the highs and lows of leadership in the Church
I took my time reading this book - a chapter a week over a pot of tea when I was in early enough for the office to be empty.
At times I found it to based on a quite old-fashioned view of ministry, but that rarely impacted negatively on my reading - in fact, sometimes it was quite the opposite!
The book was rich in scriptural references, and quotes from significant Christian figures, and I found it so inspiring that I suspect I will turn around and read it again before too long.
A Good Intro & OverviewAll the chapters are short and sweet. This is a good introduction and overview of the differences between a leader in the eyes of the world and a leader in the eyes of God. Each chapter is a brief mediation on a passage of scripture that has profound implications on leadership. It is a clear, easy to read and pretty straightforward book. It could be a useful tool for discipling young people in leadership and in many areas they may have not considered.
Insightful and helpful book which describes characteristics of spiritual leaders with a lot of Scripture references to cast strong vision for leading God's people. Just over halfway through, I had difficulty finishing as chapters grew longer and I began to wonder whether any could aspire to such lofty standards pulled from all Scripture. I finished the book, by the grace of God with which I rely upon while leading others!
This is a book to be invested in. Not only in long, focused, hours of study and attention, but also in spiritual and emotional attentiveness. It is rich in wisdom and deeply challenging. If heeded, it will revolutionize your influence on those around you and on yourself. Everyone is a leader because everyone has influence. Therefore, everyone should read this book.
Excellent book on leadership. It's most applicable to ministry or church contexts but would be helpful to any Christian in any position of leadership. I most appreciated Sanders' working through the qualifications for leadership found in the Pauline epistles. This book was challenging, convicting, and encouraging.
Good book, Biblical and ton of examples of leaders spiritual and not to bring out his points. Good to read in bite sized portions as there is much to pray over in seeking God to make us fitting for the type of leadership he sets out. Some points here and there might disagree with but overall well written, manageable and an inspiring view of biblical leadership
This was a very good book. At the end of the day, spiritual leadership is all about serving others. This book explores how that plays itself out in many categories, including my motives, during prayer, obstacles faced as a leader, and how to delegate and train others to lead. Produced some good discussion in our small group.
This is a great read on spiritual leadership. I enjoyed the theological/philosophical angles Sanders uses throughout. It's a little scattered, which makes it hard to digest the book as a whole, and gain clear/actionable application to life. Over all, though, I will re-reading this many times and plan to lead a small group on it. Definitely recommend!
I had to restrain myself from underlining entire chapters throughout this book. I’ve heard this book is a classic, stands-the-test-of-time book on spiritual leadership and it lived up to that reputation!
I listened to the audio book! Great book! I plan on buying a paper copy when I get the chance. It is packed with quotes. A lot of research went into this book, it is loaded with examples and information from Christian historical leaders.
