Since I was free to choose the book, I picked this one, simply because it is short.It turns out the story was not as bad as I initially feared.
One can read the book without curling one’s toenails all the time, the factor “Fremdschämen” has its limits, schmaltz and kitsch are kept down to a bearable level.
Nonetheless I think it would be quite possible to turn this into a nice little novella after the image of women is revised, the scenes are stripped down, repetitions erased, and perhaps two or three characters eliminated.

Πολύ επιφανειακό, περιληπτικό θα μπορούσα να πω. Ίσως εφηβικό. Δεν με έπεισε καθόλου, θα μπορούσα να πω πολλά αλλά πιθανόν αν είστε σε εφηβική ηλικία να σας αρέσει, δεν ξέρω. Απλοϊκό, δεν υπάρχουν σχεδόν καθόλου περιγραφές σε τοπία και χώρους που θα μπορούσε να γράφει ατελείωτες σελίδες. Οι χαρακτήρες ήταν επιφανειακοί και οι διάλογοι απλοϊκοί. Ευτυχώς ήταν αραιογραμμένο, αλλιώς δεν ξέρω αν θα το τελείωνα.
I needed a calm non-thinking stress-less book and Rosamunde Pilcher always fills the bill.
Άρκετα χλιαρό. Μόνο στις τελευταίες σελίδες υπήρξε μια ένταση. Η κορύφωση όμως δεν ήρθε ποτέ. Βέβαια, διαβάζεται ευχάριστα κ γρήγορα.
Nothing wrong with the writing but this particular story just felt a little too dull and depressing (our little downtrodden urchin heroine soaked to the skin in unforgiving storms etc) and I feel like a more cheerful read at this time. I will come back to this author at some point.
Pilcher's short novels are comfort food for the reader.
I am seeing that they are a bit formulaic.
Young woman struggles in quaint English seaside town or country village.
Young woman encounters quirky English characters.
Young woman discovers family secrets.
Young woman learns about herself.
Young woman falls in love with cad and is rescued by good guy.
The story usually comes to an abrupt and happy ending.
At least I know what I am getting and completely enjoy her writing style and imagery.
When I can't decide what to read I read Pilcher these days which seems to be often.
My expectations are so much greater after having read Pilcher's longer novels, I am let down with her shorter novels which are undeveloped and sketchy.
My first book of the year. Perfect for reading on a cold winter day.
Rosamunde Pilcher has a beautiful way of putting words together, and has a knack for drawing one in as a close observer to a different culture, climate and year.
Занадто передбачувано, трохи наївно, герої плоскі. З Пілчер я на цьому прощаюся.
Very nice writing! This book was interesting, bittersweet and beautiful. There are a couple things I would have liked to be a bit different but, nevertheless, it was a nice story with interesting characters and amazing scenery. I always appreciate writers that manage to actually transfer me to a place with their writing, and make me wish to go visit the places they describe. The coast of Cornwall is now imprinted in my mind's eye, and I crave to see it up close.
Thanks, Rosamunde Pilcher!Also, I did a book report on this book in middle school.
We usually had to choose book report books off an approved list, but sometimes we were allowed to do one on a book we liked, and I chose this one.
Thanks, Rosamunde Pilcher!It's definitely one of the better short Pilcher books, but suffers a bit, as all the short ones do, because of its length.
I used to count the number of times a couple had been in each other's presence in the short Pilcher novels before suddenly being mad in love with each other, and it was always, like, four.
Even for an airport book it was awful. I did finish it because it was what I brought for a 16 hour travel day, but it looks like Pilcher wrote a couple of good long novels (the shell seekers) that probably took some serious time and effort to produce, and a bunch of short crap to make a living otherwise.
This is the story of a girl who goes to the bedside of her dying mother and discovers who her father is. Of all the Rosamunde Pilcher's I have read, I would say this is probably my least favourite.
This is an early work of the author, in relation to her most well known works, but not actually in terms of her total output.It is a short novel at 200 pages and crams a lot into these pages.
It’s like a trip down memory lane to a more simple time, but with all the usual human frailties and strengths exposed.Rosamund Pilcher’s descriptive powers are especially strong, whether relating to people or landscape and her knowledge of people give her characters multi dimensional personalities.
I believe some of her writing will become classic over time.
This was an enchanting story. Written in an older type of English, what a delight! A simple story of a girl finding her family. Told with a charming tone and good command of the English language. Such a pleasure to read. I shall certainly read more. Novels published in 1975 had a different tone. Using words like record player, 50p for the pictures, lugubrious , amongst other lovely words.I think its time I started going back in time and reading books that had been written from that age...It was a Joy!
Like a lot of other Rosamunde Pilcher novels, this is set in Cornwall and involves a painter. But you can tell it is one of her earlier works, it is not as fleshed out as, say, The Shell-Seekers, and the ending was very abrupt, much like this review. 😀
1,5*
I really loved this book right up until the last page--- and then?
It ended so abruptly I was shocked.
So many questions left unanswered, so many loose threads.
I have since learned that apparently the hardback was over 500 pages, whereas this -- the digital copy I read as well as new ditions of paperback and hardback -- have been abridged.
If this is true it's a really bad abridgement.
It ends on a very basic happy-ever-after note -- everything wound up in a page or two.
I advise readers to look for an older hardback and read the whole thing.
Her mother lived a Bohemian lifestyle with frequent changes of boyfriends and addresses so Rebecca never grew up with roots.
Her mother finally shares family information with Rebecca, telling her her grandfather is a famous artist living in Cornwall.
Rebecca feels pulled to Cornwall, she wants to meet her grandfather.
She finds her grandfather is thrilled to see her, and has a grandson and daughter-in-law living with him.
He also has opened his home to a young man who restores old furniture and antiques.
Who really loves the old artist, and who loves the possibility of inheriting his money and home?
The Empty House has been my favourite ever since I was 16-17, but this one had a hero just as awesome and I twist that I thought I had guessed at but hadn't.Rebecca is 21 and her mother has died.
Before she died she finally revealed details about her family and Rebecca is now going to meet them for the first time: her famous painter grandfather, her aunt and her cousin down in Cornwall at a house called Boscarva.
There's also the quirky, handsome Joss who frequents the house and Rebecca takes an instant dislike to.
2.5 stars.
Like, if you wanted a Hallmark movie in a book, this is it.
A lot of typical tropes - the whole "I'm so uncomfortable with this guy who's obviously going to end up being my love interest" thing, for a start.
Also, it was so obvious that Eliot was not a savory character, so why did she just let him come onto her like that?
And I can accept that first cousins was a thing in the nineteenth century, but the mid 20th century?
I didn't hate it, but I didn't love it.
I give this a 3.5 or a 4. I love Pilcher's longer books, and I also enjoy the shorter ones for quick low-stress reading. The only problem with the short ones are that the endings seem a little too rushed and it's over before you really get a sense of what's happening. I did enjoy this nice light read about Rebecca and her artist grandfather. Pilcher seems quite fond of the "non-mothering" mothers in her books, and this has some of the same. Definitely check it out if you are a fan.
On the day of her mother's death, Rebecca discovers that she has family that she has never met living in Cornwall. She sets out to meet her grandfather and cousin. Her new family greets her very lovingly but only Joss Gardner, the outsider who seems to be the apple of her grandfather's eye, can help her understand the dark currents behind their reception of her. I liked this story and give it an A+!
I like the way Pilcher writes, its smooth "comfort" read for me. This book had an interesting story, with vivid likeable characters. The ending left me a little put off, it seemed rushed and abrupt.

- the book was written in 1975).Rebecca Bayliss lives in London, works in a bookstore, and has just acquired a flat of her own which she can call home.
Things like who her father was, why she left home at an early age and became estranged from her family, that her grandfather was the famous painter Grenville Bayliss, and that the family home is named Boscarva in Porthkerris, Cornwall.
After her mother dies during the night, Rebecca returns to her home in London, and her boss encourages her to visit the family she knew nothing about.
After reading a number of crime fiction novels, I was looking for something from a different genre for a change and came across a New English Library edition of Rosamunde Pilcher’s The Day of the Storm on the shelves of our village Book Share Library.
Having not been been inspired to read further (too much dithering, in my opinion), it could have been enough to put me off this one, but I should have known that Rosamunde Pilcher’s writing would pull me in.
So it is in this novel, which starts with a young girl furnishing a flat in London.
For the first time, our heroine hears about her maternal grandfather, who lives in a house called Boscarva in Cornwall.
So she decides to go meet this unknown grandfather, and while she is immediately welcomed by him, there are unpleasant undercurrents in the house.
Most of all, a young furniture restorer, whom our heroine had briefly met in London, is flitting in and out of the house and around the town, always popping up when she either needs his help or particularly doesn't want to see him.
