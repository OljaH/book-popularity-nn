It gives an insight into how the Japanese way of doing business, along with a burning passion to conquer the marketplace and the vision of producing the highest quality products in the world grew Sony into the most respected multinational corporation in Japan and worldwide, and allowed it to become the first real Japanese company which cut across regional and international barriers and vanquished foreign competition.Akio Morita's style of writing is conversation style.
The moment you pick up the book, whatever page it may be, you feel instantly teleported to a seat in front of the legendary Akio Morita narrating his and Sony's life to you.Finally- a good, exciting lecture on the Japanese way of doing business, on business ethics, and on Japan.
And yet this small item has literally changed the music-listening habits of millions of people all around the world."4- "It was this kind of innovation that Ibuka had in mind when we wrote a kind of prospectus and philosophical statement for our company in the very beginning: "If it were possible to establish conditions where persons could become united with a firm spirit of teamwork and exercise to their hearts' desire their technological capacity," he wrote, "then such an organization could bring untold pleasure and untold benefits." He was thinking about industrial creativity, something that is done with teamwork to create new and worthwhile products.
کتاب خیلی پراکنده است و نویسنده مدام از این شاخه به اون شاخه میرهخوندنش خسته کننده س و پیشنهاد نمیکنم
With that known, the book is actually an enjoyable, simple read on how Japanese business models worked in those days.Morita makes little embellishments on his texts and cuts right through his early days during the war.
Born from a prominent Nagoya family making cottage industries for nearly a hundred years, his interest in Physics enabled him to branch away from his family’s tried-and-tested business concerns and instead worked his way in creating one of the biggest electronic companies today.
Made in Japan: Akio Morita and Sony covers the main aspects of what this book is about.
It is, in fact, less an autobiography of Morita (unless, of course, you take into account the fact that his personality and beliefs are reflected in the issues he discusses in the book) and more about Japan, commerce, technology, and related fields.Made in Japan begins dramatically: at the point where, Hiroshima having been bombed, 24 year old Akio Morita, then a naval officer involved in research, realized that the war was effectively over for Japan.
Akio morita was probably a bigger deal than Steve jobs of apple in the post World War II era where Japan had a task to build their reputation on the national and international levels.
The book is like a narrative about the problems he (akio)faced across his life establishing Sony, first in Japan and then overseas.
And how the mindset and rules of doing business differ across border but are still the same deep within.I would highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to know what it would have been like to establish a business so big that operates in 100+ countries 50 years back.
.An absolute delight!
Akio played a role in pushing for the development of some of these technologies even when their success was doubtful.The book is also a historical record showing the stages Japan had to go through after the war.
It shows how Sony moved into the international market: how they set up offices and factories in other countries and how they had to study the laws and cultures of these countries.I highly recommend this book to anyone with an interest in the "Japanese way" of doing business or in the history of post-war Japan.
Одна из лучших книг


This is one of the best book, I have ever read. People who are interested in History, Management or to understand the cultural difference between East and West, will all enjoy the book. Engineers would find it quite inspiring. Highly recommended.
good book,inspiring and informative.must read for management guys and technos .
A view into the culture and processes, way of working from different part of the world i.e. JAPAN which has always been a fascinating country for many of us.
In Japan employees are treated like member of a family and efforts are put to retain them even in the bad times of company instead of hire-fire policy followed by many MNC's.
It also tells how in a very short span of time after WWII they reached prosperity and became developed country with good work ethics.
It also tells us how important is the role of politicians in changing the fate of the people and country.
Cảm tưởng như sau, vào đầu thế kỷ 20 bạn cầm 20 ngàn đô mỹ từ Nhật sang Mỹ và mua công nghệ trợ thính và về vọc, công ty Sony tiền thân là thế đó.
Rồi sau đó phát triển máy Radio, máy nghe nhạc, tivi, và bạn biết chứ?
Sony phát triển như vũ bão sang các thị trường khác lập nhà máy và bê công nghệ sang.
Từ Mỹ, Nam Mỹ, Sony còn được Hoàng Gia Anh mời đầu tư vào Anh, và bạn biết không Vua Anh dự lễ khai trương nhà máy.

i read this book On and Off. its a great entrepreneurial journey of an Idea transformed into the world's leading business. i called entrepreneurial journey of an "IDEA" rather than an entrepreneurial journey of "Man" because its the vision and goal that a group of people started with made the people transform and learn while they do business. People who do the business change but the idea behind doing it and the business itself doesnt. it evolves but never dies.. Thats SONY. it know what people likes. Made in Japan is a great read.
Author has touched upon topics like world trade, management and innovation in a manner which makes the reader dive into think deeper on each topics. For one who doesn't have much knowledge about Japan this book speaks diversely about it. It was a realisation for me to know what it meant to be affluent and industrialist as the author was couple decades ago. Everything makes it a morethan a decent read. I also like to mention that book is not so well written.
I read this so long ago that I can't fully remember the details of my impressions, but at a young age, it was sufficiently interesting to keep me engaged. The story of how they built Sony in the ruins of Post-war Tokyo was truly inspirational.
Akio Morita,Japonya'nın savaş öncesi ve sonrasını yaşamış,işine aşkla bağlı bir japon.Onun gözünden,japonların dünyaya nasıl baktığını çok güzel görebiliyorsunuz bu kitapta.Sony şirketi özelinde dünyadaki elektronik devrimini ve ülkeler arasındaki rekabeti,şirket özelinde performans yönetimi,motivasyon,risk almak gibi konuları okuyucuyu sıkmayan bir dille aktarmış.
A fascinating insight into Japanese business and culture in the post-war years. Still just as relevant today as when it was written in the late '80s.I was amazed at how similar the discussion of trade conflict between Japan and the US was to the current disagreements between China and the US.
Akio Morita's Made in Japan is compelling story on how he co-founded one of the biggest corporations in the world. Today, Sony is a global leader in electronics but only a handful know that it was a Pressure Cooker manufacturer in the post-world war era!!
An interesting read on how SONY was build after WWII by inventing new technologies and products. I expected a biography, but was pleasantly surprised on how Akio Morita discussed business and cultural differences between Japan and USA.
Worth reading 📖
An excellent autobiography - Morita pulls no punches.
Very good
Good business book with nice approaches to growth of a company. Too much praises of Japan but profound comparison with American industry with Japan industry.
the author is a confident lad. Sony did make lots of amazing things, it is Apple before Apple.
I think it was detailed and very laconic, I was in awe of it all the time!Very knowledgeable for all young generations.
very much interesting
Simple , comprehensive covering important cultural, work related , business related and historical aspects of Japan from around the time of the world wars . Walks you through the efforts of creating Sony and introduces you to thinking Win Win. Anecdotes make it so interesting and facts stickier. The author is proud and yet balanced and pragmatic . Enjoyed it all the way. Interesting also is Summary of world trends esp in the US wrt business and policies over trade wrt Japan. Overview it gives is brilliant.
