I was admittedly a hater and felt that although I am a huge fan of Kevin Hart's stand-up, he did not deserve a book deal.
I really appreciated how honest and genuine the entire book felt.
He was upfront about having a writer, and I think Hart and Strauss collaborated perfectly.
You can just see the Hart shining through the entire memoir.This book is not at all what I expected it would be.
Instead of it being a written version of a comedy special (like I thought it would be), it read like an inspirational story that absolutely anyone would love.
Every experience is a potential life lesson. Even if you don’t appreciate it at the time, each struggle in the present is preparing you for something else in the future. Almost everyone knows Kevin Hart's name by now, but that wasn't always the case. In his memoir, he tells the story of how he became an "overnight success that was only sixteen years in the making"–from a shoe salesman whose biggest dream was to become a Nike rep to a world-famous comedian. It wasn't always a smooth, upward traj
I don't follow Kevin Hart's career closely, but he's one of those comedians that makes me start laughing the moment they appear because I know it's about to get hilarious!
This book will be most interesting for Kevin Hart fans and those who are interested in the lives of stand-up comedians, but his insightful advice is relevant to anyone seeking success.
Kevin admits that his comedy material wasn't always ready for the big-time.
After reading his memoir, I would describe Kevin Hart has a hard worker with a positive attitude.
I have to end this review with one of my favorite Kevin Hart bits: Ostriches.
Find all of my reviews at: http://52bookminimum.blogspot.com/ “You can’t control the events that happen to you, but you can control your interpretation of them. So why not choose the story that serves your life best?” Let me begin this by saying I’m not what you’d call a big Kevin Hart fan. I have a couple or so young(ish) children who already will have a proclivity to swear words due to the simple fact that I am their mother, so when Hart’s stand up specials started to hit the cable channels se
My old lady brain is failing me and I can’t recall what we ended up seeing in 2015, but I do remember having multiple arguments about how my massive psychic abilities were assuring me The Wedding Ringer (starring none other than Kevin Hart) was not going to be okay for young humans even though the name was very similar to The Wedding Singer.
In reality, I Can’t Make This Up is about exactly what Kevin Hart says it’s about .
After about 3 hours of the audiobook, I realized that as Kevin narrates the audiobook, he throws in a TON of aside information and goes off on a bunch of tangents that's not written in the book.
The audiobook is literally a completely different story and experience than the actual book.
I almost put this down at the beginning because there was so many jokes about living in the hood and having black parents that I just couldn't relate to, so nothing was funny, and that's all he talked about for literally like 2 or 3 hours.
This book really made me appreciate Kevin Hart and his story is very eye opening. I'm not sure why I never realized how long he's been around. From the consumer standpoint, it seems that he just exploded onto the scene, seemingly out of nowhere. His hilarious autobiography shows that he's been busting his ass for years to get where he's at today. This was a great listen. If you're a fan of his standup, you'll definitely enjoy the audio.
Yes, it was inspiring to read about how he overcame a challenging childhood to become the only comedian in history to sell out an NFL stadium, but it was also jam-packed with motivational passages for anyone who is working toward a dream.
Also, because of my sister, I know more than the average nonperformer about the world of stand-up, sketch, and improv comedy and what it takes to make it in these careers.
I already knew some of Hart’s biography from his own stand-up specials and from reading an article in Rolling Stone magazine.
Hart’s brother briefly veered into selling street drugs before joining the Army and cleaning up his act.
I went into reading “I Can't Make This Up” thinking I was going to just laugh, but I didn’t expect to get hooked on the story itself as well.
Kevin Hart's story is not a new one, but it is powerful and inspiring.
The book started off strong with hilarious, endearing, and sometimes bitter sweet childhood and coming of age stories that incorporated life lessons.
The combination of life stories tied in to the pearls of wisdom that peppered this book made it quite entertaining and motivating -- and I do believe that Mr. Hart can't make any of these up!
Kevin Hart is an award-winning comedian and actor, and it took him only 16 years to become an 'overnight success.' In this inspirational and entertaining memoir - written with Neil Strauss - Hart talks about his life, career, family, and friends - and it's clear that he's a loving son, loyal friend, devoted father, and exceptionally hard worker.
Kevin would often entertain his colleagues and customers with funny stories and jokes, and eventually started doing stand-up at 'The Laff House Comedy Club'.....using the stage name 'Lil Kev the Bastard.' This was the start of Hart's professional career.
I Can’t Make This Up is a memoir by Kevin Hart, detailing his life from childhood through his slow rise to fame, to where he is today - widely considered to be a well-known comedian and actor, and the lessons he’s learned along the way.
Kevin has great respect for his mom and I admired his ability to forgive his dad for Many mistakes and move forward with him.
I honestly don’t think I would be as forgiving.In both personal and professional aspects, I really admired Kevin’s relentless determination and optimism.
As I said before Kevin spent years in an unhappy marriage.
I've read quite a few articles and reviews for this book and I know a lot of women think Kevin's portrayal of his first wife was harsh and made her out to look terrible and bitter.
I don't know if this book is for everyone if you're not a fan of Kevin's standup this book may not be for you, but if you love his standup you will definitely recognize a lot of the stories and people in this book.
I Can't Make This Up: Life Lessons by Kevin Hart is inspired by his life and rise to fame. He goes into great detail on how he sculpted and improved his comedy through friends, family, idols, and old pros. His absolute best comedy performances are when he speaks of real life events and situations that he’s been through; likewise these are the best parts of this book! As usual I always recommend listening to memoirs when they’re read by the author because they always put a personal twist on it. Kevin Hart is absolutely hilarious.
Charming.I liked this audiobook about as much as I expected to, which is to say, a lot. Kevin Hart is a funny, charismatic comedian, and I found his life story to be interesting and his delivery engaging. However, it was his side stories and little anecdotes that I enjoyed the most. Highly recommend readers to listen to this one on audio because Hart's reading makes his story so much more enjoyable.
At the start of Kevin Hart's teenage life, he was working in a shoe store and earning just enough money to pay his rent and food.
However, he soon found another job for being a host at a comedy club that was going to pay him 175 dollars a week.
I also learned that when Kevin Hart was small, he dreamed of working for Nike, and even though he didn't get a job at Nike, he was still part of it.
About once every 4 or 6 weeks, I drive 4 hours to visit my sister, brother in law, baby niece, and fur-nephew.
The drive is boring as hell.
Literally over an hour and a half of it is a straight stretch of road in cornfield hell.
I peed in a cornfield.
Far from the worst place I've peed really.)So if you have a boring drive to survive, or need a book to listen to while cleaning, jogging, or laying on the couch like a half eaten bag of chips, this could be the one for you.
I knew I would laugh, and I did - a lot! But more than that you learn that this funny guy isn't just some clown. He's worked and continues to work his ass off for his craft. The life lessons he shares are not revolutionary, however, when stated with his simplicity and humor you rewarded with some gems to live by. Awesome job Kevin Hart.
I listened to the audio version by Kevin Hart and loved it! Initially and over time, Kevin grew on me like a fine wine. His humor, work ethic, television and films continue to grow because of his burning desire to excel and expand. I especially enjoyed the beginning and last chapter of the audio. I recommend to all. 10 of 10 stars
He has apologizes to his new wife and kids but what about the readers of his book/audio.
So really what are the life lessons did Hart really learn since openly apologizes to pregnant wife and kids ...
Kevin Hart's "I Can't Make This Up: Life Lessons" was a stand up read!
With an awe inspiring attitude, Hart acknowledged his life wasn't perfect...
There is also a lot of wisdom Hart gives his readers and that really was what made this book a 5 star read for me.
During the telling of how he got to the level of success he has obtained, there were some real life struggles unfolding across every page.
It didn't read like a hyped version of his life but a look back of on how funny, crazy, sad and tumultuous a life can be.
There was good advice on these pages as well as some things that seemed so personal it was hard to read but he wrote them, so the least I could do was oblige.
I was surprised by how much I liked it and by how much I needed to hear some of his advice.

HILARIOUS!!!! Authentic Kevin Hart!!! Life stories told only the way he can tell them! I listened to the Audible audiobook, that was narrated by him and the story was AWESOME! Hours of listening to K. Hart was a treat! I It was also nice to hear the background story about his 1st marriage as well as how he got in to comedy! I can't count how many times I laughed out loud and was wiping tears from my eyes! ENJOY
He was just sharing his story and offering readers advice that goes beyond the standard work hard and you'll succeed.It was great to read a story that was so transparent.
And, while the book is a little long compared to most celebrity memoirs it goes into a lot of detail about his life and the decisions he made to get to where he is now.
If you’re someone that wants to know every detail about Kevin Hart, understand his childhood, and delve deeper into his early career this book is well worth reading.Some of the humor did feel a little overdone, but I think that some comedy just doesn't translate well in written word.
Even the Library of Congress and acknowledgments pages are funny.
3.5/5 stars Prior to reading this book, I obviously knew who Kevin Hart was, but I didn’t  know know  him if you get what I’m saying.
I loved Born a Crime: Stories From a South African Childhood by Trevor Noah, who also happens to a comedian, so I expected to like this book too, and I did.
If you enjoy Kevin Hart's other works, I 100% guarantee you will like this book.
I found it to be insightful without being too cliche, and unlike other self-help books, the fact that Kevin Hart is a comedian as opposed to an academic scholar or something made it feel like he was talking to me not at me.
Funny man Kevin Hart has much to draw on as he shares tales from his upbringing in an entertaining, inspirational and always humorous fashion making this book a big ball of fun.
He uses the life lessons to dispense advice and to explore what he has learned and his not always successful way of handling what life throws at you.
If you are in a rut while trying to achieve something, it doesn’t have to be a comedy career, it could be anything, I feel adequately safe in saying you will find inspiration in Kevin’s life lessons, which qualifies this book as a success.
3.5 stars rounded upFunny and meaningful at times but Hart goes off on too many asides/ tangents in the audiobook
A very entertaining book.
Every chapter is a different story into Kevin's life.
Lots of amazing stories of where he came from and his relationship with his Mom, Dad, brother and even his relationships with women.
There were times where I just wanted to yell with frustration with the screw ups he did but then as you keep reading you see how he grew, matured, learned from his mistakes and became a good man and good father.
He has many life lessons in this book that everyone can get something out of.
Great read.
I listened to this on audiobook and absolutely loved it!! Both hilarious and inspiring!
I had to finish it. This is an excellent read. I'm proud to be a Philadelphian!!!
Because he wouldn't have gone on to do the other things he went on to do, and maybe that would have been the peak of his career?I have a lot of respect for Kevin's mother, and she seems like an amazing woman that I would have loved to have met.
Only a mother who loves as fiercely as she did will parent the way she did.
Good book; just a bit long.
Love me some Kevin Hart though for real <3
