This book is strangely anachronistic in a "I-can't-seem-to-get-my-sealegs" kind of way.
Sometimes, I'd forget its discussion of WWII and think it was much older, and sometimes it was so prescient as to sound modern.
Nonetheless, and as brilliant a linguist as Korzybski may have been, he overstepped the bounds of his knowledge here as he spends the majority of the book praising mathematics, a language in which he was not expert.
must
Have to admit - in the beginning i didn't like it, but in the end - loved it.
The main premise of author is that humans are still living like animals even though they are time binding organisms rather than space binding (as animals).
Basically, humans have higher intellectual abilities that are passed from generation to generation and allow humans to progress.
Author condemns the premise of Capitalism (survival of the fittest) as fit for animal society but not for human one.
The outdated thinking and ideas are keeping humanity in the lower levels of development.
For me, life changing
Good mathematical explanation of live and the progress of time-binding creatures(human-beings)
