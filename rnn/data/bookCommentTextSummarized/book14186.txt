I love the film, but hate this dang book!  RUN, READER, RUN! There are very few books that I really hate, and definitely this is one of those few books that I truly hate and even I regret the time invested to read it.There are several books that I didn't enjoy to read them or I thought that they could be better, etc...However to reach the level of hating the book that's something that it's not usual for me.So, you're being warned! Run, reader, run! PLAYING DEVIL'S ADVOCATE  Maybe (juuuuuuuust m
I love the film, but hate this dang book!
I comment that, not in a negative light, but that it's crutial for many following things in the book.Since Forrest in the book isn't an innocent sweet guy but a dirty minded creature.OK, Forrest and Jenny weren't friends in their childhood and so, there isn't a scene of them hiding in the corn field escaping from Jenny's dad.In the book, they barely met for a few days on first grade and...BAM!, no more relationship.
The title character retells adventures ranging from shrimp boating and ping pong championships, to thinking about his childhood love, as he bumbles his way through American history, with everything from the Vietnam War to college football becoming part of the story.تاریخ نخستین خوانش: روز نخست از ماه اکتبر سال 1999 میلادیعنوان: فارست گامپ؛ نویسنده: وینستون گروم؛ مترجم: امیر چرخکار؛ کامبیز نمازی؛ مشهد، نشر سیاوش؛ 1374؛ در 205 ص؛ چاپ دیگر: نشر آویژه، در 1375؛ در 285 ص؛ شابک: 9649094024؛ چاپ چهارم، 1394؛ شابک: 9789649094021؛ موضوع: داستانهای نویسندگان امریکایی - قرن 20 معنوان: فارست گامپ؛ نویسنده: وینستون گروم؛ مترجم: سمانه فلاح؛ تهران، طاهریان، 1390؛ در 240 ص؛ شابک: 9786006235226؛عنوان: فارست گامپ: دنیای یک ساده دل؛ نویسنده: وینستون گروم؛ مترجم: بابک ریاحی پور؛ تهران، نشر زرین؛ 1374؛ در 260 ص؛دنیای یک ساده دل، داستان طنز تلخ، داستان انسان، انسان تنها، که گروهی از مردمان به او عقب‌ مانده ی ذهنی، عقب افتاده، کند ذهن یا احمق می­گویند، هنگامی که در یک ایستگاه اتوبوس به انتظار نشسته، خاطرات خویش از دوران کودکی تا به همانروز را، نزدیک به نیم سده از تاریخ معاصر امریکا را دوره می‌کند.

I read an article once that said that the only reason there wasn't a film sequel to 'Forrest Gump' was because the author didn't get enough credit for writing the book- well, I now have a new appreciation for Hollywood screenwriters, because the one who scribed the movie did a monumental job.
The supporting characters and their interactions with Forrest are poorly drawn- it's also a very perverse book, which I don't mind, if placed properly, but the author obviously doesn't know how to control a genre.
I might get a lot of hate from people who loved the movie and stand by the book but never even read it.
He would play university football, get conscripted to fight in the Vietnam war, hobnob with US Presidents and Chairman Mao himself, try to join Hollywood, try to be a chess player, become a NASA astronaut, live with cannibals, join professional wrestling, start his own business and what not.Forrest had versatile talents but his bad luck prevented him from realizing his true potential.He would make a few good friends, be helped by some kind-hearted people and of course, there was Sue, a male orangutan.
Learnt from a friend that Sue and the adventure around the NASA mission were not included in the movie.
Rarely do I go to a movie and say that the movie was definitely better than the book, but this was one time that was true.
I really liked the movie with the great soundtrack setting the scenes throughout the 60's and 70's, and of course, Tom Hanks played a GREAT Forrest.
I did enjoy how the book portrayed Forrest landing in even more incredible situations, such as being an astronaut, almost being cannibals lunch, and even rescuing Raquel Welch.
I would give the movie 4 out of 5 stars, but I can only give the book 2 out of 5...
Packed full of laughs, poor Forest just can't do anything right. Quite different from the film, which in this rare instance IS, in my opinion, better than the book. The storyline in the film flows a lot better, but the book is still worth a read. The only thing which I had to become accustomed to, is slowing my reading speed so that the phonetically written dialogue had an authentic slow drawl.
I recently vacationed in Savannah, Georgia and happened to walk by the famous Forest Gump bench.
It didn’t mean a whole lot to me since I’ve never seen the movie, but ever since I outed myself of this fact, all my friends and family are insisting I watch it.
Of course, I’m reading first!
...and plan to watch sometime this summer.
I really don’t enjoy reading accents so I opted for the audiobook which I thought was well-done with an appropriately Southern accented narrator.
Overall, I enjoyed Forrest Gump and look forward to comparing it to the film adaptation.My favorite quote:“Bullets an stuff be flying all over.
Saw the movie several times. Loved it. Here's to placing decency over dishonor, to rising up to stand up for our daughters and mothers and sisters, and saying to #METOO, #I2STAND4UCongratulations, Alabama's new senator-elect Doug Jones:Oh, my JUBILATION and huge sigh of relief that my state of Alabama did NOT elect the backwards pederast Roy Moore as United States senator.
But a special idiot, apparently, one whose exploits include, but are not limited to •	Winning a football scholarship to the University of Alabama, becoming an All-American and meeting JFK in the White House •	Graduating college in 5 years (unclear how, exactly) •	Enlisting in the army, going to Vietnam and winning a Medal of Freedom, getting to show his wounded buttock to LBJ.
Throughout the malodorous mulligatawny of muddle-headed, meandering misadventures that constitute the “plot” of this mess of a movie, we are expected to believe that our slow-witted friend, by obeying orders and never questioning authority, passes through the 60's and 70's going from one success to the next, meeting with world leaders and presidents, leaving his Gump-stain on all the major milestones of the age.
I read this book after watching the movie, and learned how vastly different it was from the cinematic version. Despite the differences and the fact I enjoyed the movie a great deal, I discovered the old adage remained true: the book was indeed better. It led me to the sequel and a couple of Groom's other books. His Southern flair is a lot of fun. I'd recommend this book to fans of the movie and most literature fans despite the differences. Both have their own charms. Very readable stuff if you ask me.
Forrest Gump is about how we people have to overcome all the bad things that happen to them, as shown through the eyes of the most innocent, gullible, and abused man ever.
I think a lot of people today pick up this book expecting a spiritual pick-me-up, only to find its a spiritual kick in the gut.
That said, I think people need more spiritual kicks to the gut these days.
I think Forrest Gump -the novel- had a lot to do with how much I've tried to be empathetic towards people as I've grown up.
That being said, I loved this book so much that I probably will never watch the movie.Forrest Gump is an idiot, but an idiot who has had more adventures than I could dream of.
He did manage to get into a few scrapes along the way, but always had a friend or a new government program to bail him out.I don't think I laughed as much with any other book as I did with Forrest Gump.
And I think where he ends up in the end couldn't be any more perfect.I really recommend this book to everyone.

3.5*I have very mixed feelings about this one. I heard the movie is very good. Before watching the movie I decided to read the book like I always do. And when I started it, it was magical. Plain, simple description but it grabbed me from the beginning. But at some point, it got really unrealistic and after that the magic kind of died. But overall it’s a good story. Sometimes it gave a poke deep down my mind with some lines.
Let me start off that I LOVE THIS MOVIE! I can quote mostly the whole movie. My father and I always exchange quotes randomly. I can watch this movie all the time. With that said, I was soo disappointed with the book. I am pretty sure the writer or director of the movie read the book and said I could make a better movie. Curiosity persuaded me to read it, but again sadly disappointed.
I loved the movie with Tom Hanks, so thought the book would be excellent.
The book opens with "LET ME SAY THIS: BEIN A IDIOT IS NO BOX OF CHOCOLATES.
Second, they is not tryin to murder me.Forrest's opinion of the Vietnam War: "Look, I am jus a idiot, see.
But if you want my real opinion, I think it was a bunch of shit."And, of course, "I got to pee." Never have 4 words wreaked so much havoc, generally for good as they cut through the crap.
They're a punchline throughout the book.Definitely worth reading, highly recommended.
It turns out, the book has very little in common with the movie, and it really stands on its own as a unique story.I loved the movie, but, after reading the book, I see now that the author, Winston Groom, was going for more of a modern retelling of Gulliver's Travels.
He's also a large man, like Gulliver, and an "idiot savant" rather than just "slow."The story is completely outlandish; it's a tall tale, and it lacks the great nod to Americana that the movie gives, but it's consistent in its Voice, and, though conveyed to the reader through a strong dialect, it is often funny, and, sometimes, heartbreakingly sad.I can't imagine having unleashed such a popular icon as Forrest Gump.
Tự nhiên nằm ngửa nhìn lên trần nhà và Forrest Gump như một mũi lao xuyên thẳng qua đầu.
Bao nhiêu bùng nhùng trong đầu như tan hết tan như lá bánh tráng mỏng bọc kẹo đặt vào lưỡi.
Muốn làm hết làm mọi thứ không quan tâm kết quả thế nào.
Thấy đầu nhẹ như thinh không và thanh thản nhắm mắt với một cú đả thông dữ dội.Thế mà sáng dậy đã lại như cũ.
Lần đầu tiên trong đời mới hiểu sao Forrest Gump lại vĩ đại đến thế.
Reducing women to bitches with tits at times, fuck everything else.Is there good in this book?
I am so done.I will watch the movie seeing as talking about it with my hubby it sounds like the crap I had issues with in this book aren't in the movie, like the are very different.
I don't know yet (i'll come back and update after i've seen the movie) but it sounds like the movie will be better.Update: I'VE WATCHED THE MOVIE...AND IT WAS AWESOME.
*Squeals with happiness and sadness because it's a sad movie but it's sooo good!*Whoever turned this trash-fire of a book into such an amazing movie is a freaking genius!...that is all
هنوز کتابشو نخوندمچیزی که در فیلمش بیشتر از قسمت های دیگر فیلم،فکرم رو مشغول کرد،اول فیلم و آخر فیلم
Forrest Gump the movie is excellent and a very entertaining film, it should not have beat Pulp Fiction for best picture but that's another story.
I liked that the book was different as you didn't know the story, Forrest still makes a fantastical journey but it involves wrestling, space, chess and a monkey.
I'm actually shocked how different the lead character was, I actually think if I read this book before the movie, I might have been really annoyed.
Worth checking out but if you think Forrest Gump is the greatest movie, stay away and don't give a book a bad review, the movie did come out after the book.

Social satire. Parts are clever and parts hit you over the head with the world's largest plot mallet.
Od mene velika i pozitivna petica jer sam se često smijala čitajući knjigu, smijeh na sve što se događa glavnom liku, jer on to prihvata sa toliko pozitivnih misli, i kao što i sam često kaže; "Samo sam mislio sa činim nešto dobro." Nisam pravila poređenja; knjiga i film, jer je i sam sadržaj drugačiji.
I tako mislim: bez obzira na to što se dogodilo, možem se uvijek prisjetiti prošlosti i reć: barem nisam imao dosadan život.Jel shvaćate što vam oću reć?" ❤👍
O Forrest do livro é muito distante do Forrest do filme, e tudo bem. A visão mais crítica com relação a política e a vida é muito interessante e foi bem suavizada na adaptação do cinema. A edição maravilhosa que a Aleph publicou no Brasil traz um texto complementar sobre essas diferenças entre filme e livro que vai muito, muito, muito além do mimimi habitual. Valeu a leitura. :)
So, no comparisons to the movie here.To sum things up, this book follows the life of Forrest Gump, a lovable idiot with a few remarkable skills.
My favorite thing about this book is that Winston Groom gives every character a unique voice, especially Forrest himself, which is probably one of the reasons that this book is so popular.
It's difficult not to love the dumb oaf by the end of the book, so I know I have to pick up copies of the sequel and movie soon to get my Forrest fix.
This is an entirely different experience than the movie.
You can pick out the occasional event, but the movie is only a skeleton if the book's plot.
Just a few small difference - Forrest never mentions leg braces, only plays one year of college football, goes on to be an astronaut, cohabitant of cannibal cotton-farmers, creature from the black lagoon, and a chess champion.
The famous cross-country run that takes up a large part of the movie never even occurs in the book.
Most everything else does, but it's best to just take both of them in and enjoy them separately, because they're almost different stories.
HIM not Jenny.- He smokes pot in the book.- Goes to space in the book.- Befriends an orangutan in book.- Jenny does not get sick and die.- She gets married to someone else while pregnant with Forrest's baby.- He met Bubba in college on football team.- Forrest never says "Stupid is as Stupid does." - Never says "Life is a box of chocolates...."- Does say "I got to pee." 9320532095 times in the book.- Plays chess in book.- Football got him into school, not his mom whoring herself out.- Jenny does not get molested by her father.
