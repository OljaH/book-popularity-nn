However, you wouldn't really expect there to be, given that it's a tale of the French and Indian War, set in the wilderness around New York State's Lake George, and ending in the battle of Ticonderoga.
I loved his descriptions of the wilderness, and I liked the close friendship of the three main characters in the story.
Highly recommended for those who like a good historical novel, war story, or adventure story, or who are interested in the early history of New York State.
Superheroes of the wilderness This is thrilling adventure of 18th century scouts using their sensory skills to survive in the early American wilderness.I was captivated by their narrow escapes,due mostly to the super acute hearing of the Native American.And I enjoyed the writing style of the author,thus a 4 star rating.
Highly recommended for those who like a good historical novel, war story, or adventure story, or who are interested in the early history of New York State. You will enjoy the adventure, as young Robert Lennox, along with his Onondaga friend Tayoga, and hunter David Willett, try to escape capture by the French and their Indian allies, making their way south along Lake George in the wilds of New York State to warn the British forces of impending attack.
A switch to a historical fiction was just what my tired brain needed. It reminded me of the love of American History that Jolly Ollie instilled in me. I find it amazing that so little of our history is even taught in schools today and of what is taught so little is factual.
I really enjoy all of this author's books. Early America, Civil War, and WWI. All action packed and easy to read.
