The Witness for the Prosecution alone deserves a thousand stars.
Absolutely brilliant, one of the best short stories I've ever read, of any genre.
I also loved The Fourth Man, a little atypical and utterly creepy as it is, and Philomel Cottage, which made me happy with its references to the Bluebeard legend and One Thousand and One Nights.
in short, I just found two or three stories just below average (Christie's average, which is not the same as that of the rest of the world) but the collection in general is stellar.
And I said, the title story is a little masterpiece.
أحد أعظم مشاهد المسلسل الأمريكى "breaking bad" حين يقرر مستر والت أن يصارح زوجته سكايلر متخلصاً من تبريره المستمر لأفعاله وتصرفاته؛ ليعلن للمرة الأولى عن الدوافع الحقيقية لتصرفاته، والتي ليست أبدا مصلحة عائلته أو تأمين مستقبل أولاده، وإنما وفقط هذا السبب: نفسه، أنه وجد حياته في ذلك، وأنه وجد فيما يفعله قيمة ترضي غروره وكبرياءه.
هذا بالضبط ما فعله مستر مايهيو ..
كان أكبر تركيزه على تبرئة ليونارد فول بغض النظر عن بعض التفاصيل البسيطة التى لم ينتبه لها.حقيقةً حبكة ليونارد فول وزوجته كانت فى غاية التعقيد لكن مايهيو شأنه شأن الكثير من التقنيين (كمحامى) الباحثين عن الانتصار الذاتى وإرضاء غرورهم وكبرياءهم.القصة فى نسختها هذه تبدو مبتورة قليلاً ومنقوصة وكان لا بد من إضافة بعض التفاصيل إليها.لن أحرق أحداث القصة لمن لم يقرأها وأُذكر أن هذه هى أول قراءاتى لأجاثا كريستى ونجحت فى العصف بى وسأكرر القراءة لها.

The title story is one of Dame Agatha's best - the twist at the end is absolutely breathtaking.
In the famous play based on this story, she added another twist so that she would not have to deceive the viewers about the characters: read the story first, then read or watch the play.
You will understand and salute her mastery."Philomel Cottage" was one story I really loved - I wonder why Hitchcock did not make a movie out of it!
"The Mystery of the Blue Jar" and "Mr. Eastwood's Adventure" are tales cast in the same mould.
The astute reader will guess the mystery easily, but enjoyable all the same.I don't remember much of the others.
I really did like the ending to this one since it reminds me of a type of ending that the show Tales from the Crypt would have done."The Mystery of the Blue Jar" (3 stars)-I thought the main character in this one was not that smart.
I just laughed at the ending to this."The Mystery of the Spanish Shawl" (3 stars)-A man receives a phone call telling him he has to go and save a woman's life.
I also found an online link to this story if you care to read it: https://www.shortstoryproject.com/phi..."Accident" (5 stars)-This one had a really surprising ending.
For the most part I was not able to solve the crimes (though, in my defense, I was driving while listening so my mind was a bit divided).
The stories were long enough to develop the characters and set up interesting mysteries or twists but no so long as to make me lose the thread of the story.
They were one and all unique stories with a wide range of crimes, motives, and types of characters.
If you are looking for a good set of mysteries for a road trip or commute you could do worse than this collection but I am not sure you could do much better.
Нуууу, ні. Все ж люблю і сприймаю пані Агату у лонгрідах/повноцінних самостійних історіях. Або ж конкретно ці короткі загадки не припали мені до душі. Деякі історії відверто не викликали ні захоплення, ні бажання швидше дізнатися, чим там всьо закінчиться. Тому, все ж рекомендую почати знайомство з іншої книги.
I listened to the audio book narrated by Christopher Lee and really enjoyed his performance.
In fact, you could say I wasn't expecting it both ways!
And I believe there is a movie coming out next year?Cleanliness: d*mn was used once.*Note: I listened to the audio version of this book so this Cleanliness Report is not as thoroughly detailed as other reports are.
I also have hundreds of detailed reports that I offer too.
These reports give a complete break-down of everything in the book, so you'll know just how clean it is or isn't.

Quite a fun collection but not quite at the level I have come to expect from Christie. There are some very clever stories, though, and 'The Witness For The Prosecution' was wonderful.
” 'But this is England, where I thought you never arrest, let alone convict, people for crimes they have not committed.''We try not to make a habit of it.'” My first Agatha Christie short story collection, cause I gotta read the title story before the mini-series comes out. In addition, I think it’s so nice that she’s coming back into the spotlight right now. Her works deserve the attention (though my favorite so far, and probably will be, And Then There Were None). However, with the exception
The fourth man wakes up and starts telling the other men a story of a woman named Annette, and how she, Felice and himself knew each other from childhood and the twisted, toxic relationships that ran between them.
While this story was completely predictable and I knew what was eventually going to happen towards the very beginning of the story, it still was a very enjoyable read.
However, what this story fails to do is set up a backstory and describe how in the world they knew about the blue jar and how they picked the man in the first place.
Çoğunu okumuşum malesef. Neyse ki sonlarını haırlayamadım. Sanırım hiç okumadığım bir öykü vardı ama bunlara rağmen güzel vakit geçirdim.
Over the past few years, I've been exploring Agatha Christie's mysteries and enjoying them once again.
I've just completed one of her short story collections (I have read others before), The Witness for the Prosecution: And Other Stories, which has two Poirot short stories, but the rest are standalones.
I purchased it mainly for The Witness for the Prosecution as I've enjoyed the original movie based on the story very much.
Agatha Christie is also an excellent short story writer.
My wife is enjoying a collection of Miss Marple stories, ie, Marple is listening to stories or telling them and solving them, but not necessarily participating in the actual mystery.
Others are probably short stories because she had one clever idea but not enough material to support a book, so they feel more like an O'Henry story than legitimate mysteries.
I really like Ariadne Oliver, Christie's mystery writer character, who gives us a humorous look at the life of a writer, and this story did that, too.
NB - I really don't like Christopher Lee as a narrator for Christie.
His deep voice and over-dramatized delivery work against what I like about Christie.
These were very entertaining - they weren't really murder mysteries as such, they were more small studies of human psychology, and because they were I could normally see the plot denouement coming a mile away.
I'm hopeless as a detective for murder mysteries but when it comes to how people think I seem to be fairly much right on the money in these sorts of stories.
I love Agatha Christie's short stories - she does a terrific job packing mysteries with real punches into short chapters.
Some of the stories in this volume, "Witness for the Prosecution," "The Blue Jar," and others, do a great job of providing red herrings and misdirection to keep the reader guessing.
One of my favorite stories is "Philomel Cottage" - I like the way the narrator (also named Alex!) develops over the course of the story.I enjoyed the audiobook narration.
Listening to Christopher Lee's sonorous voice for hours is not a bad way to spend a car trip!
Fantastic, Fantastic, Fantastic, Fantastic, Fantastic, Fantastic, Fantastic, Fantastic, Fantastic, Fantastic, Fantastic, Fantastic, Fantastic, Fantastic, Fantastic, Fantastic, Fantastic, Fantastic, Fantastic, Fantastic...
I know I'm a hopeless fan girl, but just about anything Dame Agatha wrote gets 5 stars from me 😍
Nice collection of stories!! Christie really writes perfect mystery :)
I know it's blasphemy - but these mid20s short stories are the best I've read of her work. Reminds me of Sanxay-Holding a bit. Lots of tension. 4.5 stars
الترجمة كانت ركيكة لم استطع فهم بعض الجمل
قصص مسلية لكن أفضلهم على الإطلاق قصة: شاهد الإدعاءتظل السيدة كريستي قادرة على إمتاعك بأقل الحبكات جودة أو تعقيدًا :)تقييمي: 3,5 نجمة
10/10
3.5/5More or less decent set of shorts, most of them new to me. I like the sometimes abstract and eerie aspect to Christies short stories.
Although I didn't like every single story, she imbued them with such an atmosphere, that most of the time psychology, powers of the mind and some outlandish plots that she usuallyWitness for the Prosecution: 4 stars - A bit hard to believe these days but a great psychological study.Red Signal: 3.5 starsFourth Man: 3 stars - A little too out there.SOS: 3.5 stars - Great atmosphere!Wireless: 4 stars - I would have loved to see the villain's face at the end!!Mystery of the Blue Jar: 3 starsSing a Song of Sixpence: 3 stars[image error]Mr. Eastwood's Adventure: 3 starsPhilomel Cottage: 4.5 stars - What an ending!
احيانا بيكون تقييمي للراوية من حيث نجاحها او فشلها معتمد ع قدرة الكاتب/ة انها تصدمني او تدهشني او ان تكون الرواية لها بعد فلسفي زي مثلا انه يكون فيه نوع من الاسقاط ع الواقع سواءشخيصات او احداث و انه تكون كل شخصية في الرواية رمز لشيئ معين في الواقع ...
مش الحدث هوا الي صدمني قد ما الرواية فعلا صدمتني بالواقع في مرحلة ما من عمري ما كنتش متخيلة انه ممكن يكون فيه انسان بالشر ده و مش مجرد شر ده شر مصحوب بدهاء شديد ....
It most probably is my favorite collection of mystery short stories to date.
Each story was captivating, intriguing, and kept me on the edge of my seat.
And almost each one of them ended with a plot twist that made me go:Here's my ratings for the individual stories contained in this book:The Witness for the Prosecution 5 starsThe Red Signal 3 starsThe Fourth Man 3 starsS.O.S. 3 starsWhere There’s A Will  5 starsThe Mystery of the Blue Jar 4 starsSing A Song of Sixpence 2 starsThe Mystery of the Spanish Shawl 3 starsPhilomel Cottage 5 starsAccident 3 starsThe Second Gong 2 starsSo that gives an average of 3.5 stars and I rounded it up to 4 for overall enjoyment ^_^
