Everyone in Britain knows Banksy, but I'm often surprised to find that my US friends haven't heard of him.
The paintings and installations just turn up, in the most unlikely places.
Erase an original Banksy?He's incredibly good at outwitting security.
One of his greatest coups was the following exhibit, which turned up in the British Museum.
The thing I like most about him is his complete refusal to take himself seriously: what a contrast with Damien Hirst and the other pretentious idiots currently getting absurd sums for stuff that isn't any better than the pieces Banksy does for free.
After seeing this next post on Tumblr, I simply had to add this book to my TBR. “A wall has always been the best place to publish your work.”I was looking for something to lift my spirits a bit, and thank the stars for sending this piece of art in my direction. Wall and Piece is guaranteed to brighten even your bleakest day.Banksy, Britain's now-legendary "guerilla" street artist, has painted the walls, streets, and bridges of towns and cities throughout the world.Wall and Piece sets the mood wi
“A wall has always been the best place to publish your work.”I was looking for something to lift my spirits a bit, and thank the stars for sending this piece of art in my direction.
And thankfully that wasn't the only written part because we then smoothly move onto the works of Banksy, where he occasionally attaches a piece text to describe the art.Here are a few of my favorites:
Overall, I was incredibly amazed with Wall and Piece, especially getting to know that some of the works took only minutes to get done.

A couple years ago when he first started doing those gallery stunts where he sneaked his own work in major museums (Brooklyn, MoMA etc) in that masked Sherlock Holmes outfit, I thought 'why, this guy is not a popular artist, what he's doing is clearly conceptual and bravo to someone who is expanding the boundary of performance art!'.
There is a trend in the rising street artists where the stereotypical persona of the rough, I'm-from-the-hood attitude is discarded for a safe, white bourgeoisie irony of look-I'm-fiddling-with-something-cool-and-dangerous-but-remember-drugs-and-alcohol-are-bad-for-you-kids!
(excluding ironic Che references)What Banksy does is arguably beneficial to the art community, in a way that he exposes the traditional obscure and anonymous operation of street artists to a wider audience.
In 2003, Banksy donated one of his artworks to the Tate Gallery in London.
The thing is, the Tate Gallery hadn't actually asked for anything of his.
This is just the kind of appalling disrespect that I think the world needs more of.Over the next couple of years, he made similar donations to the Louvre, the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, the Brooklyn Museum, MoMA, the Natural History Museum in New York and the one in London, and the British Museum.
too bad he would face 12 years in prison if he actually distributed them.It's a shame that Batman and Wonder Woman aren't real, but at least we have Banksy.
“Imagine a city where graffiti wasn't illegal, a city where everybody could draw whatever they liked. Where every street was awash with a million colours and little phrases. Where standing at a bus stop was never boring. A city that felt like a party where everyone was invited, not just the estate agents and barons of big business. Imagine a city like that and stop leaning against the wall - it's wet.”
There are two kinds of people in this world: those who know the work of Banksy, and those who should. I recommend this book to both.I think this quote from the back cover says a lot about Banksy:  "There's no way you're going to get a quote   from us on your book cover"   Metropolitan Police spokesperson________________Update 6 October 2018Banksy artwork 'doubles in value' after being shredded in front of stunned onlookers moments after it was sold for over £1m at Sotheby's auction.Wie gewonnen

I loved this. Particularly this

I do have to admit that I don't like him spraying live animals, but him sneaking into zoos was amusing.
As many are no doubt now gone, this is a good way of seeing them now."Some people become cops because they want to make the world a better place.
Thought provoking and powerful - a tour de force of the absurdity that has become institutionalized in our modern world.
Like many people, I just find the story of Banksy -- a sort of artist Robin Hood -- incredibly compelling.
In my head this most elusive of graffiti artists looks like Sean Bean and drives a Lotus Elan or something like that.
This book spares the words and lavishes the photographs, letting Banksy's political statements, hastily and secretly sprayed onto walls, speak for themselves.
If Banksy was just an anarchist, rustling with discontent, this book, and his art, would be unimpressive.
But Banksy's art speaks with an edgy, wry, stylish accent.
His spray-painted creations are no defacement.
Added later: I found it quite moving, his description of being drawn to graffiti the outside of the walls imprisoning the Palestinians and being told off in no uncertain terms by the inhabitants. To beautify the walls is to insult them. Of course. Obvious when you think of it.----------------------------------------I'm loving this, of course. And it's not that I disagree, exactly, with his messages, but a dominant one is this idea that  The people who truly deface our neighbourhoods are the comp
There is lots of really clever, funny, aesthetically pleasing advertising out there and lots of crap graffiti.I like the following pictures, taken recently near where I live.
In fact, I don't understand why I'm supposed to find the graffiti pleasing either absolutely or relatively.
Banksy's stuff is pictures which either contain words or read like words.
A small group create, promote, purchase, exhibit and decide the success fo Art. Only a few hundred people in the world have any real say.
People do that, they buy pictures being sold on the side of the road and they love them.
They think they have purchased art.
This book is a collection of Graffitis that “Banksy” - one of the world’s most famous street artists - has painted on walls, streets, bridges and many other open places throughout the world.
Quite amazing and artistic.
(To know what graffiti is, the following lines give the best explanation of it as a piece of art):“Graffiti is not the lowest from of art.
There is no elitism or hype, it exhibits on some of the best walls a town has to offer, and nobody is put off by the price of admission.A wall has always been the best place to publish your work.”
I noticed this yesterday in the window of a bookshop on the Route de Carouge. The translator has found quite a clever way of rendering the title: War and Peace in French is Guerre et paix, and "paix" sounds similar to "spray". The odd thing is that he's done it by moving the pun from "War" to "Peace"!
I read this book after watching the video "Make the wall" that I had already found excellent.It's amazing.I don't like artists who are content with a work of form, aesthetics.
For me the art must also be social, I like the sentence of René Char "what comes to the world so as not to disturb anything deserves neither respect nor patience".Frankly contemporary art, for what I know, deserves neither ...
according to the criterion given above.Banksy is clearly an exception.It's disturbing, both in form and substance, and always right.
We say to each page "it's great" and I rarely use this word.What a freshness!
Provocative and clever, but I would argue ultimately vapid.
Something like an underground cultural icon for urban youth today.
This either leads to people hating the content and calling it a bastardization of art, or people loving it because they're in on the joke and they "get it." There's basically no message except, "What's the message?"Commentary on political decadence.
He's full of talent (he wouldn't get this much attention if his art and stencils were ugly and untrained) and potential but ultimately has nothing to say and no real method of causing significant change.
Thought provoking....
A few quotes of his I enjoyed were:Some people represent authority without ever possessing any of their own.The greatest crimes in the world are not committed by people breaking the rules but by people following the rules--it's people who follow orders that drop bombs and massacre villages.A recent survey of North American males found 42% were overweight, 34% were critically obese, and 8% ate the survey.We can't do anything to change the world until capitalism crumbles.
In the meantime we should all go shopping to console ourselves.We don't need anymore heroes, we just need someone to take out the recycling.
However, the two french djs used to mix at parties with uncovered faces, whereas Banksy has never painted or appeared in public.Well, anonymous unless the recent surprising revelation by an investigative journalist turns out to be true.Craig Williams has published in the Daily Mail an article with a surprising revelation that is based on a long investigation.
Street artists sometimes present socially relevant content infused with esthetic value, to attract attention to a cause or as a form of "art provocation”.- [Wikipedia]In 2015 Banksy has created a huge dystopian park called Dismaland (obviously lampooning Disneyland) in which he has installed huge creepy artworks https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wruE....
Some people enjoy hating on him because he makes loads of money out of stencilling these days and his messages are sometimes vaguely anti-establishment.
From what I've read and seen over the years political stencils have always been vague because they're supposed to be provocative; they're not supposed to be academic essays with footnotes and bibliographies.
There are better books on graffiti and stencilling out there, but this is a worthy read if you appreciate what this fella does - either technically or through his vague anti-establishment messages.
I had never heard of Banksy, but his highly successful, clandestine, guerilla marketing intrigued me.
I did a Google search on him and was even more impressed with the images of his work.
A live elephant, elaborately painted in pink, in a staged living room.
His words are just as effective.Banksy ends this book, “People either love me or they hate me, or they don’t really care.” I’m part of the first category, and I honestly don’t know how anyone can go through this book and not have an opinion.
He's against the global soulless corporate machine, but his art is by nature a quick hit, the artistic equivalent of a Big Mac. It's incredibly refreshing and accessible and it's art that actually means something.
Banksy as an artist is a reaction to the high brow direction of art over the last hundred years - he makes art that's relevant to, accessable to, and understandable by the average person.Also, his work is damn entertaining, usually showing a great cheeky sense of humor.This book is, if nothing else, a great introduction to the man and his work.
This is art at its most emotional and provocative, and it's in book form (which I assume pisses him off to no end).Anti-establishment, anti-consumer, anti-intelligencia, and pretty much any other "anti-fill-in-the-blank" you can throw at him, his works are unfathomably creative, carry an array of emotions, and are unrivaled.
Let's face it...this man's work makes us all want to pick up a can of spraypaint and make a little magic on the walls.
Trying to learn how he does the cut-ups for his stencils, and man...they're more difficult than they look.
They should hang the cardboard cut outs of these things in museums.
Damn difficult or I am doing something seriously wrong.
Of note:"There's no way you're going to get a quote from us to use on your book cover" --Metropolitan Police spokesperson, quoted on back cover"Copyright is for losers" --copyright page"Despite what they say graffiti is not the lowest form of art.
What the human race needs is a lot more streakers.""Art is not like other culture because its success is not made by its audience.
A small group create, promote, purchase, exhibit and decide the success of Art. Only a few hundred people in the world have any real say.
Even if, for some reason, you strongly disapprove of graffiti, you gotta admit Banksy's stuff is pretty cool (I think you do anyway, but who am I to tell you what to think).
do you really think that whole heaving crowd of baseball cap wearing humanity in audience at Lollapalooza is cognizant of the plight of indiginous people in Mexico?
Or do they hear the band on the hard rock station, like the ripping guitars and thumping bass and anger and only think of Señor Frog's and illegal immigrants when you mention Mexico?
This is an art book, but here some of my favorite quotes:"Despite what they say graffitti is not the
This was a coffee table-esque book. It was primarily pictures of Banksy's pieces. Some I had seen before, some I hadn't.Still, I love the work Banksy does and thoroughly enjoyed this book. I ended up reading it while sitting next to my Mom and she kept looking over my shoulder when I'd laugh or shake my head. It's one thing to show someone an image you like online it's another thing to show them a picture in a book and have them want to read it after you're done.Update: Mom read and loved it =P
I'm not always on board with Banksy's peaceful anarchy philosophy. I was a bit horrified to find he defaced actual paintings in museums. Still, I find most of his work brilliant and provocative, and I love his sense of humor and whimsy as he artfully conveys his messages. I thoroughly enjoyed this volume of his work along with his commentary.
I gathered from the summary and people's reviews that, more or less, HE was worth the read, if not the book itself.
So really, this book makes me think that he is a scatterbrained person, as most artists are, who do not work well with organization but rather impulse, which I happen to like...it's easier but at the same time quite difficult.
I don't know for sure if he cares to have respect for graffiti art, but if he does, he's going from the angle that other art disrespects his art, instead of their artists, in this book.I read/interpreted it, carefully and with perspective.
To the point that I was getting sick and tired of hearing people say his name with that knowing tone that seems to say 'yeah, I'm hip too'.
Some because they used it for inspiration (amongst other books) and some because they wanted to display it and tell everyone that came over that they were a little bit 'in the know' and had kept up with trends.Thankfully the words in this book say a lot about the philosophy of the artist and the point/pointless nature of his work.
Have a few minutes with this book and you'll be reminded why he actually is a great artist who matters...
