I haven’t read many Linda Howard books but for the ones that I have I did enjoy then.
Daisy Minor was a 34 year old Librarian who was about to find her inner tiger that would finally snag a guy of husband material.
There is also something sexy about a guy who appeared to be enamored with said Librarian from day one.The banter between Daisy and Jack was perfect.
It bugged me a bit but I was enjoying everything else about the story that in the end it didn’t matter.This one gets thumbs up and I'm looking forward to reading more from Linda Howard!
Cute story, granted not very original but it still had a little of everything. I very much enjoyed the banter between the 2 main characters.
Daisy needs some protection.★★★★ (This is a review of the audiobook.) Oh, I had to be bad and get this one! I know I only gave the hardcover of this one four stars, but it has some of my favorite themes along with one of my favorite authors, so I splurged and got the audiobook. I’m so glad I did, as Deborah Hazlett does a great job narrating. She handles this fast-paced Romantic Suspense with ease and perfect diction, while her pace, volume, and tone do not fluctuate. The male voices aren’t quit
Daisy needs some protection.★★★★½ (This is a review of the audiobook.) Oh, I had to be bad and get this one!
The characters are fun together; I can so easily picture them.Daisy Minor, small town librarian, and Jack Russo, Chief of Police, make an enjoyable and charming couple - though you wouldn’t know they are a perfect match at first.
Daisy decides it is time for a major make-over, and she gets in a little too deep with her sexy new look.
Despite the topic, there is plenty of humor mixed in with the justice.
A good mix of suspense, romance and humor.Very likable heroine. Decent hero.Overall very enjoyable! 🤓
Tis' the (Open) Season. There isn't much more to say than what this picture will cover because the word "condom" was used a couple dozen times in this book.There were seventy-two condoms purchased in the production of this story.  Maybe she needed to warn Chief Russo to keep a close eye on aisle five at Clud's Pharmacy, because judging by the variety offered here, there were some hinky things going on in Hillsoboro.  No, hinky was not a typo. I swore it was kinky the first time I read it, which
I swore it was kinky the first time I read it, which would have been even more appropriate.You might want me to mention something other than the copious condom usage, perhaps?My thoughts about the success of the story itself : Open Season was a fun little small-town romance.
The suspense element is almost an afterthought, when Daisy ends up witnessing a murder and is dropped into the middle of finding out about an organized sexual slavery trade.But really, I should have just stuck to my game plan of showing off a wall of condom quotes because that's about all I'm going to remember from Open Season.
So she gives herself a makeover--she starts using make-up, she buys new clothes, she colors her hair blonde.
He visited the library she works in once for help with his computer--I really enjoyed the banter between these two throughout the book!This was a really enjoyable and fun read and it also had some suspense.
I liked Daisy and Jack, I thought they had great chemistry.
I liked how Jack liked Daisy even before her makeover--he thought she was cute, he liked her old-fashioned ways and her openness.
I also liked Daisy's cute dog Midas.
A very entertaining romantic suspense!
I think this might have been even better as an audiobook, as the narrator had a great voice for both male and female characters, she captured the humor, and made me believe I was really listening to these characters.
Daisy and Jack were a great romance H/h pair, the suspense was really good but never over-the-top, the humor was a great surprise (their conversations around a 'party pack' of condoms was a crack up!), and the heat nice and steamy.
If you are in the mood for a romance suspense that isn't overly dark, has a nice dose of humor, and a very likable H/h, this is a must read.
4.5 Party Pack Stars! Daisy Minor wakes up on her 34th birthday and has an epiphany. Daisy decides she wants to meet a man! Not just any man, she wants to find a husband and have children before it's to late.Daisy is a small town librarian who leads a pretty boring life. She lives with her widowed mother and Aunt in the house she grew up in, hasn't had a date in a very long time, dresses drab, wears no make-up, and is basically mousey....and she's a very proper southern lady who's a bit naive.
She finally moves out of her childhood home and begins prowling local bars for that special someone....little does she know she's being used as a pawn by a "friend" who is looking for someone who is praying on women.Jack Russo is Hillsboro's Chief of Police, he's a former Chicago SWAT officer who spent his boyhood summers with his great aunt in Hillsboro AL.
Now someone wants Daisy dead and it's up to Jack to keep her safe.....and convince her he's the man for her!I loved this book!
Updated for audio: 4.5 stars (half-point lost due to major quibble with the ending, as noted below).
No matter how many times I "read" it, I always laugh.
Plus, an audiobook makes cabinet polishing go faster.This is one of Howard's best (even though the make-over fashion scenes went on too long).
Some reviewers question that Daisy is still almost a pure virgin at 34 years old, but I lived in a small town in Alabama for some years and had little trouble believing it.I loved *LOVED* Jack.
:) Major Quibble:  I didn't care for the ending at all, when one of the villains knocks on a certain door.
- Hopefully a great (with a lot of high ratings) m/f CR to be experienced in a 9 hrs audiobook edition.Glad and smiling as usual - Ms H gives me what I like..
Yet another excellent quality romance with a good thrilling suspense plot and two very lovely, or actually amusing funny, main characters from Linda Howard.
— Nothing.It's good to know there are a lot of books by writers like Linda Howard to pick up when you need something you know you will enjoy every single time.
This book so lived up to its hype, the heroine was a stereotypical librarian, with her nose in books, living with her aunt and mother when she got up on her 34th birthday and realized her life was passing her by, she was mousy, her hair, her clothes everything sucked and that if she didn't do anything she would never have the family she wanted, so she slowly starts working on it and her aunt and mom help.
This was a very fun book to read! I enjoy the interaction between Daisy and Jack. I was rooting for Daisy to get the life she wanted and for Jack to win her over. Daisy was very funny, I loved the condomn scene and her rational for buying them (so people would know she was on the look out for a man). I loved the small southern town atmosphere and the characterizations the author used. Great story and enjoyable romance!
5 stars – Contemporary Romance/Romantic SuspenseI loved this! It's a funny, sexy, and entertaining read about quirky, prudish librarian Daisy, whose makeover and clubbing misadventures get her into trouble when she becomes an unknowing witness to a criminal operation, and HOT, protective alpha cop hero Jack Russo who comes to her rescue (in and out of the bedroom!). It's lots of fun and the romance is steamy!
~~~ 4 stars~~~When in doubt read Linda Howard!
That's my new motto.
I loved it.This book was funnier and cuter than the previous ones I've read by this author.
I loved both MCs, they had awesome chemistry and their dialogue was funny.
No OW/OM drama.Daisy is a 34 year old virgin.
I loved her a lot.
Hot AF Chief Russo!I adore Linda's heroes.
Protective, determined, alpha, bossy and badass.I didn't like the ending.
The villains (who are not ant-heroes) should not have a happy ending.
Especially the ones that are involved in sex trafficking.
Overall, I loved this book.
It was mainly very adorable.
On her 34th birthday Daisy had an ephipany.  She had to make some major changes in her life (makeover) to avoid being a spinster.  She's  prim and proper.  A poster child for a responsible citizen.  She wants to men to notice her.  Get married and have babies.  And so the transformation begins.Jack Russo is the chief of police.  He is fairly new Hillsboro and thought Daisy is cute even before the makeover.  When Daisy's safety is threatened, he's very protective of her.I love the evolvement of Daisy and Jack's relationship.  Their witty banter was also a bonus.
Another fav LH book come and gone again... I loved this one as much this time as I have the other several times I've read it. First time was in paperback years ago. As I've been saying all week on my LH re-read tour..no one does rom suspense like her. This one didn't have the creepy villain factor like most of her others do, and the suspense was kept to a minimal... he H/h still had the awesome chemistry going on as they smoked out the bad guys.
For fans of Sandra Hill this is certainly a book to consider in terms of belly aching hilarity!The love story between Daisy and Jack develops so well throughout the story you just love how they grow to love each other.
She's like a genteel lady from the regency period at times but she can hold her own against Jack.The steamy scenes are great and there's just enough to be satisfied.Some minor things I didn't like: the slow build up at the beginning, but maybe it was necessary to get a feel for Daisy.
I really liked this story.Jack and Daisy are amazing together.The writing, characters, and story are great. All I can say is.... I'm glad Daisy won't have to buy a "Party Pack" ever again:))
"Oh, this is bad," she said distractedly. The man was positively narcotic, and she had never suspected.   On her thirty-fourth birthday Daisy Minor, small-town librarian, realised that she has one nothing meaningful with her life and she decided it was time to change that because she wanted a husband and kids and it was time to make men notice her. Only the man whose attention she keeps on getting is the one man who isn’t her type, the bossy and sexy Jack Russo, who is also the Chief of Police
Only the man whose attention she keeps on getting is the one man who isn’t her type, the bossy and sexy Jack Russo, who is also the Chief of Police and who keeps on getting under her skin, irritating and flustering her, until he starts melting her.
"I'm surprised at you, Miss Daisy.""I didn't know about the watermelon," she blurted, suddenly afraid there was a green-striped condom in the PartyPak box."If I were you, I'd worry more about the bubble gum," he said absently, still reading.She blinked, taken aback.
Loved it! One of my favorites by Linda Howard. Definitely a keeper to reread over and over again. Daisy Minor is 34 years old and its time for a change. The librarian is ready to break out of her shell and live. Enter the small town chief of police, Jack Russo. 'Nuff said.
I'm sure the story picks up once Daisy has been made over but having already read the book twice, not that I remember the details, I had no inclination to wait for the good parts to come on.I ran off to listen to an MM.Nov 2008 REVIEW:Still a four-star read the second time around!
The only thing I did not like and think it's the oddest addition to a book's ending is Sykes looking up Mrs Nolan.
The heroine, Daisy, is the most sensible yet unboring heroine I've read about in a LONG time.
I really loved this book and it was so different from the other Linda Howard book I read several months ago.
"MacKenzie's Mountain" was very good, but this was fun!
Daisy was such an adorable character and Jack was the perfect boyfriend for her (even when she did not know it).
Now, I cannot wait to read Linda Howard's other books!
The hard part will be finding my next book to top this one.
Thank-you, MelissaB for talking about this book a couple of weeks ago because I probably would not have read it had it not been for your comments!
Loved it! This was fast paced, emotionally charging, yet extremely fun to read. The characters were delightful and I found myself actually laughing out loud. I so rarely get the chance to do that with a book, so when it happens, I am tickled pink!Daisy is sweet, smart, sexy and oh so fun. Chief Jack Russo, epitomizes the word "hunk"....and the party pak scene was a hoot.This was entertainment!

With those goals in mind, she goes to the town's gay man with idea he can help her with finding the right style.Before she can implement her plan, though, she runs afoul of the town sheriff, Jack Russo, who decides that teasing Miss Daisy is the highlight of his life.
Can Jack keep her safe while she tries to shed her good girl persona.While the book dealt with some dark issues, including white slavery, the overall tone was light and in some places laugh out loud funny.
The humor is delightful and this is overall one of the best books by an incredible author.
When I picked up this book, I certainly wasn't expecting the story I ended up getting - but I really enjoyed this!
Granted it's not as pent up with angst and danger as Shades Of Twilight and After the Night were but this story holds its own.
This is probably the most light-hearted Linda Howard book I've read.
The suspense was certainly there but it wasn't the kind that tore my nerves to pieces.
I kind of liked how she toned down the elements of danger and mystery.
Still a solid five stars for Linda Howard!
le he puesto 4⭐ porque el final con los malos no me ha gustado mucho, ha sido muy precipitado. Por la relación de los personajes me ha encantado. Me ha hecho reír y no me ha dejado parar de leer. Hacia tiempo que un libro no me enganchaba tanto.
Very funny book!
All these books tend to be a little dated now, having been written in the 90's and early 2000's, but this one read more so.
This book had a lot of similarities to Mr. Perfect, the heroine being stalked by a dangerous 'person', and the police officer/sheriff falling in love with the heroine while protecting them.
This book just had a little too much going on, and I never felt much between the two main characters.
Small town librarian Daisy Minor and Chief Jack Russo were rather flat characters, predictable in nature and a little boring.
