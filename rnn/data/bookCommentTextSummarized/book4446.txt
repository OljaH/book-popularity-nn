Slim stepped back, leaving the black hilt of the knife growing out of Riley like a horrible malformation.
His weight on the ropes pushed the knife handle up so that the blade slowly cut deeper inside him.Slim sat on the grass a few feet away and gave himself a cigarette.
With the help of an American slang dictionary and books on the criminal world of America he wrote his first novel, No Orchids for Miss Blandish, over six weekends.
Ultimately only one motive is at work throughout the whole story: the pursuit of power.For those of you interested in more about what Orwell had to say about this book here is a link to the essay.
Its probably the best book by James Hadley Chase. A very well written book; unputdownable, and one of the best crime thriller novels of all time. Villain is unforgettable, and so does Miss Blandish. Its one of the Le Monde's 100 Books of the Century.
with gangster and all, the sort you might find in Pulp Fiction - no character has any morals whatsoever and there is a lot of sex and violence (You remember Ezekiel's biblical verses?
This one is worth reading if only for Orwell's essay on same, in which he analyses the book and genre and argues that it is all about power-struggle and realism (big fish eats small fish, survival of the fittest kind of realism) without make-believe game of morality.
And So take it from expert, unless you have drugs or chemicals handy, it is easier to kill a person than make him/her lose consciousness.
No Orchids For Miss Blandish: James Hadley Chase's First Novel "I'm ashamed of myself. I'm a person without any background, any character or any faith. Some people could cope with this because they believe in God. I haven't believed in anything except having a good time.” She clenched and unclenched her fists, then she looked up; her fixed smile made Fenner feel bad." Miss Blandish to Dave Fenner  I'm quite sure that my rating might have been a bit higher had I actually been reading No Orchids F
Once again, the television enters the picture with law enforcement having the networks to broadcast the facts of Slim's escape and a request that anyone with information call in to aid in his apprehension.For a comparison between the various editions of "No Orchids for Miss Blandish," I highly recommend http://www.jottings.ca/john/kelly/sba...
But one cannot discount how prolific an author Chase became.The Story"No Orchids for Miss Blandish" appears to be a blend of Ma Barker and her gang of sons, and the very basic plot line of Sanctuary by William Faulkner.
This is a superb crime thriller about a jewelry heist that becomes a murder and kidnapping.I'm not going to give away any more of the plot other than to say it is action-packed and completely involving. I made the mistake of reading this while having lunch, and looked down in horror to see that I had indeed eaten an entire sleeve of Townhouse crackers while caught up in the story. If you like a raw, gritty, no-frills, down and dirty thrill ride...I'm out of cliches - just read the damned thing.

The total lack of mystery (we always know exactly who’s done what to who, why that guy got knocked off, what this cop is thinking) doesn’t matter.The casual sexism (One of the important facts of life that Paula had learned the hard way was not to keep any man waiting.
There was Woppy, a clever safe expert…Slim Grissom’s background was typical of a pathological killer) don’t matter.The beyond-cliché dialogueAnyone who touches her has me to reckon with.I don’t know nothing about nothing!You’ve got nothing on me.I don’t know what you’re talking about, copperYour only hope is to come cleanLet’s make it quick and gory.You’re surrounded!

هیچوقت خیلی اهل خوندن رمان‌های پلیسی نبودم،در واقع فکر کنم تنها رمان پلیسی که جز این کتاب خوندم قاضی
Highest Recommendation!A relentlessly brutal page-turner.At the end of the novel my heart was pounding and threatening to jump up into my throat.One of the best of the classic era hardboiled thrillers, up there with the very best of Hammett and Cain.A "must-read" for all fans of the noir genre.Best described by George Orwell: "...
not, as one might expect, the product of an illiterate hack, but a brilliant piece of writing, with hardly a wasted word or jarring note anywhere."The above quote is from Cult Fiction which I found quoted in Paperback Confidential: Crime Writers of the Paperback Era
Come and get me!' "
The closer Fenner gets the more horrifying the situations appears; in No Orchids for Miss Blandish.James Hadley Chase has a written a very raw book with No Orchids for Miss Blandish and you can see the obvious James M Cain influence though out this book.
Dave Fenner has the makings of a good protagonist and I can’t wait to see where Chase takes him.
There are actually two versions of No Orchids for Miss Blandish, the 1938 version which I was lucky to have read and the 1962 revision, because James Hadley Chase thought the world of 1939 too distant for a new generation of readers.
It was quick nice read. Purple entries in this fleshly chiller by the creator of Twelve Chinks and A Woman. This one includes the beneficiary of a few pearls and a fortune, who is the butt of a group war between two crowds and is seized - doped - assaulted because of Slim Grisson. Private dick Fanner discovers her, with a decent arrangement of discharge in the going. Nice shots all around ! 👌
The main man, as far as the slaughter goes, is a horribly vicious psychpath called Slim Grissom whose description was so powerful, whose bestial joy in killing anyone who happened to catch him on an off moment, was so evident that i could not have stopped to give a lift to a stranger if my cat's life had depended upon it.
Hadley Chase creates a monster and I know that is an overused term in literature but i think Grissom was so foul he qualifies murderous hands down.The story is of the eponymous Miss Blandish, the wealthy socialite daughter of one of the richest men in Kansas.
NO ORCHIDS FOR MISS BLANDISH is a treasure trove of criminal stylings written in a timeless quality.
The tale of kidnapping, jewel heist, murder, and gang rivalry is engrossing and utterly captivating.
Ma Grisson and her son Slim are the catalysts in turning a snatch and grab into mass murder and a show of force in taking complete control of the criminal underworld.
I couldn’t get through NO ORCHIDS FOR MISS BLANDHISH fast enough – one of the best noirs ever written and a true classic of crime fiction – 5 stars.
Vaya sorpresa!!Me he sentido envuelta en una película de gangsters de las buenas. Que bien me lo he pasado.Lo que hace la codicia humana. Lo mejor el final, impactante, no me lo esperaba.Intentaré leer más cosas del autorMuy bueno.
I almost forgave Chase for his overt mysoginy  (hide spoiler)].The novel has an extremely high body count, an unrelenting presence of danger and death for all characters involved.
Chase strongpoint here for me was in the introduction and description of minor characters, often appearing for only a couple of pages ( a cabaret owner, a dumb hat-check girl, a fashion reporter with shady connections, a getaway driver, and alcoholic mob doctor, a murderous psychopat, a bolt hole owner, etc).
I've read a little on wikipedia about Ma Barker and Bonnie Parker, famous tough ladies that probably inspired Chase, and about how their crimes may have been fabricated in order to justify their deaths.

This is a dark book.
Full of violence this book is as grim as they come.
Not as explicit as other writers I think it's actually made worse by the fact that everything is hinted at, kept just off-screen, so your mind has to fill in the horrible blanks.
I started this book late last night and as soon as I picked it up this morning I had to keep reading til it was over.
Told in 3 parts the book switches between viewpoints as the story progresses.
I wasn't expecting the book to suddenly go the angle it went.
A quick, thrilling read.
Though the ending was a bit predictable it's still worth reading.
Foster mentioned that the plot of this 1939 noir in his book How to Read Novels Like a Professor: A Jaunty Exploration of the World's Favorite Literary Form (3 stars) is an excellent example of a well-written plot so I ordered this from Book Depository.
No Orchids for Miss Blandish is a crime novel.
One of the things I found different in this crime novel compared to the others that I've read is that the reader already knows who committed the crime of kidnapping Miss Blandish and yet one has the interest of finding out what will happen until the very last page.
4.5 StarsAfter reading the fierce first chapter, I was totally surprised to discover that this book was written in 1938!
So I paused my reading to track down the only edition that I could find with the original text, and that was this one:
My jaw definitely dropped a few times at the horror of the story and the situation that Miss Blandish was in, being a rich girl that has always been protected by the terrors of the world, being suddenly thrust into something that might ruin her innocence completely.
O tempo todo a polícia investiga os bandidos errados, até que entra em cena o detetive particular Fenner que fora contratado pelo pai da moça para fazer uma investigação particular .A partir disso o livro se torna espetacular , envolvente , sem parar, num ritmo alucinante até seu desfecho final.
Um dos melhores livros que li esse ano.Bandidos frios ,sanguinários, mãe e filho diabólicos , um pai desesperado, uma moça abusada física e psicologicamente uma corrida contra o tempo um livro eletrizante..!
Abaixo uma pequena biografia de um dos piores bandidos do grupo""Slim Grisson era un asesino nato.

My guess is they have never read anything like it.But as George Orwell explains, James Hadley Chase wrote crime novels set in America for Brits who had been accustomed to buying remaindered pulps which had been used as ballast in cargo ships, and sold, damaged, for 3 p.
I can't imagine any American woman, then or now, getting kidnapped and not trying her best to escape, get help, shiv her captors, or at least chew their ears off, with her tongue if not with her teeth.If everyone who thought this book was great read Fast One instead (although there's no accounting for taste), James Hadley Chase would soon be eclipsed.
Another great pulp classic. Some controversy surrounding this book when it was published and the author came back several decades later to update story for a modern audience. All that aside, I found the book very enjoyable for the cast of characters involved and the varied plot twists. Plenty of strong arming, back stabbing and thugs turning on each other. I really liked the way this story ended and although I saw it coming, I didn't really think Chase would go through with the fairly dark ending.
Can't Help Lovin' Dat Man ...Messo nello scaffale tra “Il Grande Sonno” e “Il Falcone Maltese”. E non sfigura proprio per niente …«Aveva l’aria di uno che non ha niente da fare e un mucchio di tempo a disposizione per farlo».E adesso ... il film di Aldrich![anobii, May 2015]
My guess would be that this novel must have caused a lot of controversy when it was published; it wouldn't surprise me if it was one of those books covered by the old phrase "banned in Boston," although my other guess is that many Bostonians probably kept it hidden away from prying eyes while reading it.
I will say that I certainly wasn't expecting what I got when I started reading this novel -- considering that I've read tons of mystery/crime novels published about the same time, this one has to be the most raw, the most tell-it-like-it-is kind of book with pretty much nothing else to compare it to, at least among books I've read from the time.
He lived in England all of his life and chose his settings in this country using guide books and detailed maps.
He was inspired by reading “The Postman Always Rings Twice,” and decided to try his hand in the genre.
The story goes like this: Miss Blandish – innocent, exquisite, vulnerable heiress – is kidnapped by a gang of ruthless hoods who’ve never tried big time crime before.
It was turned into a film twice, the last time in 1971, titled “The Grissom Gang.
Of the eighty or so books Chase wrote, this is the only one I ever see in print.
Published early enough that it interesting almost by definition to anyone interested in the history of genre, No Orchids for Miss Blandish has the additional historical significance of having plagiarized from William Faulkner’s Sanctuary (1931) and of having drawn the attention of George Orwell in his 1944 essay “The Ethics of the Detective Story from Raffles to Miss Blandish” (a.k.a.
“Raffles and Miss Blandish”).
The novel is about as brutal as a novel could be in 1939, but also a wee bit comedic for the occasional false notes of a Brit trying to write hardboiled American dialogue.
Generally considered his best work, this his first novel, was a massive hit when it first arrived in the late thirties.
This once best-seller is the kind of book any would be crime writer must read.
The hero is introduced late in the novel, a private eye has to find the girl and return her to her father.This is an excellent novel especially considering that Chase sets the book in the states, without having been there.
Whether he gets the setting right I don't know and I don't care this book sits alongside Raymond Chandler's The Long Goodbye and Hammet's Thin Man.
Il mio istinto non fallisce mai direi, anche questa volta ha colpito a segno.
L'ho letto tutto d'un fiato, anche accecandomi nel crepuscolo pur di non staccare gli occhi dal libro e accendere la luce.
Scritto molto bene, non ha il classico schema da thriller, o meglio, si ce l'ha ma alla fine....lascio leggerlo a voi.Non ho molto da dire a riguardo.
Scritto bene, scorrevole, dinamico, empatico a volte, insomma un libro giallo scritto seguendo le regole e aggiungendo quel qualcosa in più.
Il titolo rimane il mio preferito, fantastico...ancora mi chiedo il perchè delle orchidee, ma il titolo continua a piacermi lo stesso.
James Hadley Chase is, for me, the undisputed king of pulp fiction, and this book is one of his best. It has a promising plot which has been developed into an unputdownable novel of non stop action. The writing is top notch; the characters, the dialogues, the action sequences, everything is just perfect. I loved it!The only problem is that the edition I could get my hands on has a lot of spelling mistakes which somewhat spoiled the fun...I would say, it's a swell yarn, alright!
