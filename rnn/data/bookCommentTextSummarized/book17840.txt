Our Boundless Interview & ARC Giveaway with Cynthia Hand is up!This review is spoiler-free, and safe even if you haven't read the first two books in the series.
Clara still feels the absence of those she loves, even though Angela and Christian are both there at school with her--and though her relationship with Tucker changed after Hallowed, she just can't stop thinking about him.
There is so much love in these books in its many different forms, and I feel the glow of it long after I turn the last page.Without a doubt, this is one of the best paranormal romance series ever written.
Cynthia Hand really showed little mercy for most of the book with her plot twists, which always seemed to bring Clara nothing but grief.Things I liked:-As usual, I love Hand's writing style.
Also, Clara is a smartass and I love it.-I think this book has the best plot out of the series.
His scenes gave me SERIOUS FEELS like this one:I received very strange looks from Mr. Sinclair while reading Boundless.Things I'm not too sure about:I was really hoping that Boundless would tie up a bunch of loose threads, but it seemed to just leave more questions than answers.-I was surprised to find out how big of a part Angela had in the storyline.
*** EDIT:  OHMYGOD. WHAT GORGEOUSNESS. GIVE IT TO ME.NOW! ***End of Edit.***Oh Tucker! GO BACK, CLARA! GET YOUR SKINNY ANGEL BUTT TO HIM RIGHT NOW. OR I WILL KILL YOU. And now, I'm going to faint from the rollercoaster ride that was book two. Oh and Christian?
I know it’s unfair to judge and rate it on who Clara ended up with.
But overall, the story was fascinating, while yes, I would’ve changed few [major] details about it but I sincerely enjoyed majority of it.Now let me start with my Christian Prescott centric review and please if you haven’t read 
It’s like all facts headed straight to point A (Christian) the suddenly it went to point B (Tucker).
Because darn right, that will crush my already itsy bitsy hope.Anyway, I loved the story, while I think 
I don’t like Christian just because of Clara, I loved him for who he is.
I knew before I started so I understand needing to know.(view spoiler)[I loved the ending.
It was always Tucker and I do think Clara gave Christian a fair shot.
I think he took his purpose the wrong way and also thought he had to be with Clara when hey had the purpose wrong all along.
As for Christian, Clara told him in book 1 I AM IN LOVE WITH TUCKER AVERY so everything after that was his fault for pushing her when he knew it wasn't ever going to happen.
****EDIT****Yes, Josh, you are right. That cover is gorgeous. ****EDIT****My, God, it has a title now?! Excuse me while I weep in impatience... ***Oh, the agony!!! Why must it be so long?! *sobs*[image error]
*sniff, sniff* I can't believe it's over. :(__________________________Tucker. Christian. Tucker. Christian. Tucker. Christian. Tucker. Christian...oh, who am I kidding? Michael ftw!
"TEAM TUCKER" ALL THE WAY!Tucker honey, pick me pick me! lol :D
So. Here we are at last.I don't know why good-byes are called good-byes, and I don't want to say it to this series. I don't want to. I don't.In the desolate, barren land of YA angel fiction, the Unearthly series is like a beacon of light. A clara lux in obscuro, better yet. It is beautiful. It is heartwarming. And it may just be one of the paranormal series' I've read that I am extremely, emotionally invested on.That's the main thing I love about this series, really, is that it's so real. The w
Cynthia Hand seems to know exactly how to hit me in the feels, and splatter my emotions all over the walls.Clara is one of my most favorite heroines.
Cynthia Hand knows how to make a love triangle the right way, because usually I'd pick one guy and stick with him, or sometimes I'd pick neither.
And of course, undying and unconditional love.I really wish Cynthia Hand would possibly write a prequel, telling of Clara's mother's story.
For the fact that I don't want this series to end, and also because I genuinely want to know more about her, and what her life was like.
There was pain. There was amazing romantic moments. There was more pain. But in the end, it was an AMAZING and beautiful conclusion to this trilogy.
Dear God,I don't want to die. Not now.Sincerely,Clara Gardner  This is a fairly spoiler-free review (outside of the tags), but there are some spoilers in the comments, so avoid the comments if you havent' read this.That ending! If only I could tell you my thoughts about the ending! For the most part, I think Ms. Hand did alright. I shamefully admit to being something of a whiny brat about the early direction of Boundless. There's such a thing as a comfort zone and I was not in it for the first
It's the same thing I did with book 2, and I ended up dealing with everything just fine.
If you haven't tried out this series (trilogy, really), and love for your angel stories to be more on the sweet romance-y side with an extra dash of mystery and adventure, check these books out.
If you want to read something darker, well...you're out of luck with this particular set of books.
I think I can support this woman.Totally random, but I really want to know what a whiff of cloud smells like.
(I mean, compare it to a book like Halo where the main character is an angel with healing powers, yet all she does is make out with her boyfriend and whine about how she doesn't like watching the news because it "makes her depressed." Oy vey.) I also thought that, unlike in a lot of paranormal romance books, the whole romance & love triangle thing was actually handled quite well.
I've read several YA books where characters had unprotected sex like it was no big deal, and nothing happened to them ...
After Reading: It's difficult to say what I think about this book.I made it quite obvious that I am on Team Tucker.So if I start ranting and bursting into tears (view spoiler)[Although I did burst into tears when Cynthia Hand almost pulled an Andrea Cremer (you probably have no idea what that is...) (hide spoiler)] you might assume that Clara chose Christian.If I get all bubbly and happy, you might assume that Clara chose Tucker.Let's just say that this book gave me all the feels.There were tim
OH MY!That cover!It's so beautiful!!I'm actually having tears of joy from seeing this cover!!It's just so amazing!!and we're getting one step closer to the release!!ANOTHER EDIT:FALSE ALARM!!!The world didn't end!Come to me January!!!!!!!EDIT NUMBER 3:Okay..okay...okay...I was going to buy this THE DAY IT CAME OUT BUT...Now i'm having seconds thoughts.I'm so so so scared of what might happen in this book!WHAT IF CLARA ENDS UP WITH CHRISTIAN?!!!!I'M SERIOUS!!!I.
*shrugs* I'm Team Christian myself, but since I like Clara so much, I know she wouldn't make a stupid decision (whether she chooses Christian OR Tucker).
For once, I'm not going to let the love triangle thing bother me, and I'm sure I will enjoy this book just as much as I enjoyed Unearthly and Hallowed, because Cynthia Hand is a great writer, and even though it will break my heart and crush my soul, I'll try to get over it.
And also because they're both really hawt great guys.
Tucker all you need to do is forget about Clara and find yourself a nice girlfriend and everything will be OK.
This book was such an emotional roller coaster.
It made me tear up a couple of times.
I can't explain how much I loved it.
There won't be anymore Tucker and Clara barn and fishing scenes, Christian acting like a knight in shining armour, Jeffrey going on my nerves and being a watchdog, Angela's big mouth, broody goth we call Samjeeza and scenes from the past with Clara's mum and dad.
You wrapped it up all so nicely.
Everything would have been clearer and, when I was surprised to discover a new angel character, I shouldn’t have since he technically is presented in that novella with an alternative point of view of Clara and Angela.The Unearthly series is a GEM in its category.
The only thing she knows is that she still cares for Tucker (which we will still se in this book) but she can’t be with him in order to keep him save.
Angela and Clara are ‘friends’ but, to me, it’s like the only reason they are close is because of the whole angel situation which keeps bringing them together.
Not to mention female half-angels' purpose in life are to hook up with guys so they can make babies together!(4) The slut shaming: As mentioned above, wearing revealing clothes makes you a bad female.(5) The Love Triangle:  Oh yes the love triangle......and this time Love Interest No. 2 Tucker is out of the picture for most time.(6) The lack of explanation: Why would the arch villain (view spoiler)[wants Angela's baby so much and go into such length to catch him?
SniffI really liked this ending.
Though I found the beginning to be really really slow, it started to pick up in the middle and things finally moved along.
Clara finally decides who she wants and it's no surprise who she picks.
I did like the fact that she knew who she really wanted even though she tried giving the other one a chance.
This is one of those better love triangle romances that I didn't mind who she ended up with.
Also, the ending had some twists and turns and I was really scared when one part ended.So many feels, this trilogy is written well and I can't wait to read Cynthia's next project.
I'm crying happy, fat and semi-ugly tears right now because I can't believe this beautiful series is over.See this? That's me pretty much the whole way through the book.And this?  At ALL some parts.I can't count how many times this book has brought me to a near heart attack. My anxiety level just went all over the place. It was so erratic, I just want to roll around in the floor like a dog and never stop. Yeah, that's one pretty picture.I honestly don't know how I'll review this book without spo
I'm crying happy, fat and semi-ugly tears right now because I can't believe this beautiful series is over.See this?
Yeah, that's one pretty picture.I honestly don't know how I'll review this book without spoiling itbecause I'm pretty sure that I will.So I'll just leave you with teeny tiny tidbits about it that you can look forward to.1.
(Your EQ will be greatly tested...and improved after you survive this book)5.
I know, I'm just totally obsessed about him like that.
Updated 06/24/12IT HAS A COVER AND A TITLE!!!!!!!!!!
SOMEONE HOLD ME!!!I seriously can't handle all my feels for this Tucker interview!
He's totally putting on an act and you, Clara - you fell for it hook, line and sinker.Actually, about Clara for a sec, and her constantly mentioned 'women's liberation' attitude...Uh, where is it exactly?Christian mentions that he's 'paying' for dinner and a movie and for her to let him even though he knows she wants to be an 'independent woman'.Clara is mulling over her relationships (note the plural, because she is so, so CLINGY) and then berates herself for not being more 'women's lib' on the issue.Clara likes to badmouth 'men' (as a whole) with her friend who (view spoiler)[basically hooked up with a BAD ANGEL, got knocked up, hides the truth about the kid's real parent and yet even after hooking up with the BAD ANGEL goes and hooks up with a different dude (hide spoiler)], so she's totally one to lay the blame of stupidity on the opposite gender.Clara's daddy teaches her to swordfight.
*Tears streaming down face*Why is this taking so long...? :(
I came into this book with neutral feelings about the triangle, and I thought that I would be fine with whoever Clara ended up choosing (view spoiler)[I was almost certain after Hallowed that it would be Tucker, so it wasn't a huge surprise (hide spoiler)].
As stated in my reviews of the previous books, I liked both love interests and I thought Clara had amazing chemistry with both of them.
(view spoiler)[Clara only thinks of Tucker (and dreams only of him) and shows no romantic feelings for Christian.
(hide spoiler)] As for the resolution itself, I thought things ended a bit too neatly for Clara and (view spoiler)[Tucker.
However as much I loved almost everything about it there is this one aspect, a pretty big aspect in this book that I think Hand wasn't able to completely handle very well: the romance.
What's worse was that she actually made a great job with it, it was very convincing that personally I think even the Tucker fans could accept the idea of Clara and Christian.
He was a great and wonderful character too, it was just that I wish Hand put a lot of more effort in him, in making me see that he had greater connection to Clara and that he was indeed her "home" so at least my heart, my poor, fragile heart wouldn't have been too hopeful and confident.
“We think of happiness as something we can take. But usually it comes from being content with what we have, and accepting ourselves.”  I'm a little disappointed right now, as usual a book is not finished as I wanted haha and that leaves me a little bit lost about how I feel for it. But here we go...Although that I could change the ending for a thousand ways to make it so wonderful for me, I think that ending was really sweet, I'm filled with moments of love, struggle and discovery, especially
But here we go...Although that I could change the ending for a thousand ways to make it so wonderful for me, I think that ending was really sweet, I'm filled with moments of love, struggle and discovery, especially friendship, I think is the main word for describe it, FRIENDSHIP.I can say that the main characters in this story, love each other like a family and that's been lovely to read, Clara grew a lot in this last book, we see a more powerful Clara, always hesitant but more warrior than in previous books
Now, it's a book I found myself cringing at the idea of even recognising I read - my sincere apologies to the author considering I once did adore these characters and stories.
I didn't enjoy it so I didn't want to read it like I would another book, so I don't remember a whole lot from it.
Christian may have been better in this book but doesn't mean I didn't want to punch him in the nose like eighty times throughout this book.
Sooo...I felt only so-so about Unearthly.And I just couldn't get into Hallowed.So I'm not actually going to read this but...Can someone please spoiler tag me who Clara ends up with? I'm still curious how this ends.
Fantastic end to a fantastic series and I'm quite satisfied with how everything wrapped up! Clara finally chooses between Tucker and Christian, and while I was kinda hoping she'd end up with the other one, both love interests were awesome in their own ways and I'm happy with who she picked. This is a great paranormal romance trilogy, well written with strong characters and a love triangle that works! Totally recommended!
Part of it, Clara's vision starting out the prologue and the rest of the book being her trying to figure out her purpose and the end revealing how her initial vision worked out, well, that I get is the hook of the series and have no problems with, but it seems to me like Hand enjoys revealing things with basically the writing equivalent of 'see, see, here's a detail that's going to be important later, so I'm going to make it so obvious you HAVE to notice it' - there was the color of Jeffrey's wings the last two books, and this time around, all the stuff about how something is going on with Angela.
I liked the emphasis on choosing your own destiny.
I like these characters and was really invested in them throughout the series.
I mean, it's a huge deal for the main character because it's about the people she loves, but I thought this was gearing up for something bigger.
Although, I have to be honest, most trilogies that I've read that do try to take on something HUGE fail spectacularly.
So maybe it was for the best?Anyway - not a fave and not without flaws, but I did enjoy this series!
I binge read all 3 books in just a few days.
WHY CHRISTIAN? WHHHYYYYY?YOU HAD ME!YOU DON'T NEED CLARA.YOU BROKEDEDEDED MY HEART :'(Oh, and Tucker. GET OFF YOUR ASS AND CHASE AFTER HER.
