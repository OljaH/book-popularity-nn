Rather annoying.What I did like: Morgan writes about female desire, not as directly as I might wish, but still at some length, and with attention to the physical, and from the woman's own experience of it rather than from the male gaze, which is quite something for 1932.
(view spoiler)[ Lewis wishes to live the life contemplative, but he re-meets Julie, and they very slowly realise that they are in love, but Julie, alas, is married to a man at the front (this is WWI), but they decide to have an affair regardless.
(hide spoiler)]How could Morgan, after 1918, write such a thing?
Good evocation of the unreality of a life of parole for officer prisoners in the first world war in Belgium, interlaced with the journey towards spiritual peace of the main character (in spite of fleshly temptation).
The reconciliation between German and British competitors is very well done, and reminiscent of the unusual relationships in The Heaven Tree (qv, by a different author), though ultimately less destructive.
I would have rated the book higher except for a certain slowness of the narrative, that is not required by the story of contemplation - so the pace is ultimately a bit too even, in spite of some points of high drama.
'Most popular book of 1932'With advocation I could be persuaded to make this a 4. :) A rather race-y story for 1932 in my limited awareness of 1932? Post script. I found this interesting referral to Dutch skates a foreshadowing to the Dutch speed skating dominance in the Olympics:"Have you ever used Dutch skates -- a very fine knife-edge and loose under the heel. You get a swing and rhythm you don't get any other way. It's like playing music on the air."
