Request to Readers of This Review who LOVED the book Please stop NOW & do not read this review. Based on the ridiculous & repetitive comments left by lovers of this trilogy, many of you cannot handle opinions that do not conform to your own & feel the need to call me stupid, tell me I have no right to read this book, & other nonsense. If you feel that way, FINE. Just stop telling me! I don't care! I don't troll lovers of this trilogy & tell them they are morons for liking th
Thus, it is already obvious to me that this sequel is following the same path as the first book: lots of extraneous details about clothes, Diana's writing practice, food and the idiotic conversations between the characters which I'm guessing the author thinks are amusing (they aren't); Diana is still the most awesome-ist witch ever...who can do nothing practical; when trouble finds them, they change location; and now apparently Matthew isn't just a highly intelligent vampire, he is also friends with anyone who matters and a member of two (at page 97) powerful secret organizations AND a spy.
I have to say the long commentary on here of them moaning and groaning and being annoyed by an author makes me want to go stick a pencil in my eye.That being said apparently many people believe that the cosummation section of the book should have been in detail.
Fifty shades of grey is SMUT and to go into graphic detail in SON would have made me want to hurl.
So thank you Deborah for not being super graphic.I love historical based fiction and that is exactly what this book's structure tends to follow.
"You gave your life to me Diana Bishop. It's time to make use of it." This is a hard review to write. How do I sum up all the intense emotions and thoughts that this book conjured in me? So please forgive me if this review is not worthy of the book for this was truly an incredible story and like the first book, one I will have to read again and again. The book starts off exactly where A Discovery of Witches ended, Matthew and Diana have traveled back to Oxford 1591 in search of a witch powerful
The aspect of time and how every little action affects the future left me feeling unsettled because I was looking back on my past actions and questioning what would my life have been like had I changed even one thing.
Watching how the book affected those it came in contact with, including Diana and Matthew brought all those old ideas and questions of mine to the surface and left me feeling a little uncomfortable, but this was also the section that Diana and Matthew truly become one and after everything that has come before it, I felt that they had finally evolved as a solid and unbreakable couple.
I loved Discovery of Witches and couldn't wait to dive into the sequel, particularly now that they have traveled back in time to Elizabethan England.
Harkness punishes readers with endless dialogue between Matthew's incredibly boring friends, who there are, like six of and all six of them are interchangeable and awful.
Seriously, this guy had no redeeming qualities and I really started to question Matthew's love for Diana-- the Matthew of Discovery of Witches would have killed Marlowe after the first time he risked Diana's life at the beginning of the book.
My rating: 2.5 of 5 starsShadow of Night picks up  immediately after A Discovery of Witches ends (and I do mean immediately with little to no refresher. This was my second attempt at reading and I attribute my success at completing it solely because of this recap I found online which was an immense help.) with Matthew and Diana traveling back into the past to search for Ashmole 782 and to seek Diana help with her powers. For those that don’t remember: Ashmole 782: the bewitched alchemical manusc
I can appreciate the obvious extent of the research the author conducted but including every interesting person from the time period felt a little like ‘everything but the kitchen sink’ and should have been scaled back a little to focus more on Matthew and Diana.Shadow of Night definitely had a case of middle book syndrome.
Going back in time only resulted in throwing them into chaos and the slight control she did have over them dissipated but discovering the full extent of her powers was truly shocking.Shadow of Night was definitely my least favorite of the trilogy so far but I’m looking forward to some resolution and seeing how everything turns out.
- Oddly, the fathers are the best new characters in the book, which is sad because they are both dead in the present time.
He is larger than life in a way I think Harkness meant Matthew to be in the first book, but didn't quite attain.
I'm sad he won't reappear in the third book (at least, it's unlikely unless somehow Diana and Matthew changed time enough to save his life...hmm...not impossible).
But if you're a stickler for things like pretty prose, stable character development, and sensible time-travel writing, this may not be the book for you.
Have you read the same book I just suffered through??
should have been my first warning) I don't even want to read the 3rd book I'm so turned off by this LONG, confusing sequel.
I suggest reading some of the other 1 star reviews for a more accurate description of this book's flaws.
I have no idea what the 4-5 star reviewers read, maybe they got a condensed readers digest version.
To end on a positive note, the actress who read the story did very well considering what she had to work with.Anyway, if you are insistent on reading it, good luck.
So imagine you’ve written a story about vampires and witches who hunt for a mysterious book full of power and life.
The two appear dangerously close to achieving their aims and the plot feels like it is actually moving forward in a steady direction.
There was little suggestion that such a thing was even possible in the first book and the reasoning for it here, though painstakingly explained with caution and consideration, felt more like a justification than an actual logical reason.
For me, it was a massive case of telling us how powerful and dangerous her characters were without actually showing it to us.
The way things were described became slightly repetitive after awhile, if I have to read "and my witch's third eye opened" again I will cringe lol and I always pictured a literal eyeball opening up in the middle of her forhead...weirdness!!
I understand that it was maybe a way to write something different that no one has really written before in regards to vampires/witches/time travel etc, but it came across as more funny than effective.
and kudos to the author as it did hold my interest long enough to want to know ultimately what happened and read through to the ending.
Matthew also becomes immensely annoying with his constant desire to keep secrets and treat her like she is incapable of understanding him.If a character is annoying the author will make sure they appear often.The treatment of time travel is so illogical that I can't look past it no matter how much I wanted to like this book.
Instead, they proceed to do a massive number of unnecessary things that could have been avoided if any character in the story had simply been smart enough to remember that the main character can time travel whenever she wants to.Furthermore, the book doesn't stay true to the characters.
Following is my review of the book.This story begins at the same point where A Discovery of Witches left off, with Diana & Matthew landing safely in Elizabethan England.
This provides for some drama-filled scenes of major mis-communication, but also allows for the relationship between the two of them to grow and mature, ultimately bringing them closer.I will admit, I found it difficult to immediately delve into the story, as the first several chapters introduce new characters based on historical figures some of whom I am only dimly aware, but who I felt I should know better based on how they were presented.
What a wonderful, vibrant, rich exciting thriller/mystery/love story this is.Loved how the supernatural is woven through the story as Diana and Matthew journey through Elizabethan Europe. A cracking read, and a worthy sequel to DoW. Can't wait for the next one.
It was a long wait, but completely worth it.
Harkness' view of Elizabethan London and Europe is just awesome, and the trip to Prague was an added bonus that I had not expected.
Not only did the plot line get more compelling, but Harkness was also able to weave in the difficulties of the newly wed.
I savored every minute of this novel, and I can hardly wait to get it on audio.Audio was just outstanding and I think I will be a freak and listen to it again sooner rather than later :)
I'm bored out of my mind and just can't read another page.
I've been reading this book for over a week, hundreds and hundreds of pages, and virtually nothing has happened.
There has been so little forward progress, it's astonishing.
Too many boring, insignificant characters have been introduced.
The amount of historical information and intricate detail is remarkable, but also mind-numbing.
So many times I wanted to scream "Just get on with the story already!".
I hope you get your happily ever after.Update: It's two days later and I'm even more angry about not being able to finish this book.
Indeed, knowing what's going to occur in the next novel actually improved the overall plot for me.
I originally came to the conclusion that most of the historical plots were relatively inconsequential.
The plots and the carry-through with a large cast of characters both vampire and other feels entirely justified on the re-read.
Of course, magic is fun while the stormclouds slowly encroach upon the sunny day, but we can feel the raindrops forming and the time for preparation is slipping away.I'm a big fan of this novel.
I wrote in my review of ADoW how I fell in love with all the characters in the first book, yet I’m equally invested in all the new characters in Shadow of Night, both historical and fictional.
It’s heartbroken to realize that these characters live in another space and time, and the only way I could reconnect with them is through the re-reading of this book.If you loved A Discovery of Witches because of Harkness’ extensive and detailed descriptions of everything, you’re in for another treat.
My Diana and Matthew:Wow, what a sophisticated and remarkable story! Shadow of Night was like nothing I have ever read before and it surpassed all my expectations. This book offers the most amazing mixture of romance, history, paranormal and action. It was equally good (if not better) as first book and I enjoyed reading this book immensely.  Shadow of Night is that kind of book which you cannot put down because you need to know how things are going to end up. Simultaneously, you are trying to re
Shadow of Night was like nothing I have ever read before and it surpassed all my expectations.
Shadow of Night is that kind of book which you cannot put down because you need to know how things are going to end up.
Shadow of Night is eventful book, there is no single boring part since something is happening all the time.
And the bond that Diana and Matthew developed in this book was so beautiful and it made their relationship perfect in my eyes.Shadow of Night answered plenty of questions about Diana's magical powers, Ashmole 782 manuscript and de Clairmont family.
Historical detail & slow pace drags down sequel Though I had a rocky experience with Harkness' first novel, A Discovery of Witches, I began reading Shadow of Night with hopes that its setting in the past would add intrigue and excitement to the unfolding story.

As she wraps up her story, I hope that Harkness provides readers with faster pacing, clearer world building, and more character development.Note: This review refers to an advance review copy.
On that note, I did love a lot of the book.
I enjoyed meeting Diana and Matthew's fathers in this book.
That was a mild spoiler, but your going back to the past so what do you expect :) Diana learns some different things about herself and Matthew for that matter.
I loved that Diana didn't really put up with much of anyone's crap in the book.
I'm not sure if it was the time, his father, or what, but he came to his senses as the book got closer to the end.
It makes me feel like I'm letting Diana and Matthew down.
I FINALLY finished this darn book - thank heavens.
I'm sure I'll read the last one, but not with any of the excitement that I had while waiting for #2.
When I turned over the last page I was furious to find that while I was struggling to keep all of the characters straight in my mind...they were all LISTED by section and described.
Who looks at the end of a book for such helpful aides?
I sure didn't!
Grrrrr.Recommendation: Before you get too deeply ionvolved, check out the list of characters in the end of the book before you get as confused as I was!
Diana and Matthew find themselves landing back in Elizabethan London.
The tale that unfolds is absolutely breathtaking, filled with suspense, romance, danger and iconic characters throughout Elizabethan history.The characters in the All Souls Trilogy are flawed, fleshed out and I absolutely adore them.
In this novel we get to see tremendous growth in Diana.
This provides insight into how Matthew and Diana are changing the future.
The fear of discovery and the atmosphere of the times, especially towards witches made this tale very suspenseful.
The romance between Diana and Matthew was genuine and beautifully portrayed.
This is the second book in the All Souls trilogy and mostly takes place in 1590/1591 after Diana and Matthew have time-walked there to be safe from the congregation, find the manuscript of Ashmole 782, as well as a witch capable of teaching Diana about her strange magic.It is thus that we meet characters like Walter Raleigh, Christopher Marlowe, Elizabeth I and even Matthew's father Philippe, who has quickly become my favourite character (along with Matt's nephew Gallowglass).The book takes pl
This is the second book in the All Souls trilogy and mostly takes place in 1590/1591 after Diana and Matthew have time-walked there to be safe from the congregation, find the manuscript of Ashmole 782, as well as a witch capable of teaching Diana about her strange magic.It is thus that we meet characters like Walter Raleigh, Christopher Marlowe, Elizabeth I and even Matthew's father Philippe, who has quickly become my favourite character (along with Matt's nephew Gallowglass).The book takes place in London (Blackfriars), France (Sept-Tours), and Prague - as well as some modern places few and far between.Once again, it is remarkable how much research has gone into the authenticity of the settings and Deborah Harkness has brought all the places to life in an uncanny way.
Diana is shocked when she learns that Matthew, who goes by Matthew Roydon in this time period, was a player in the elusive School of Night (Marlow, Raleigh, Chapman, Harriott) as well as friend to Shakespeare.
Diana has quite a time trying to learn the speech patterns and vocabulary of the time as well as getting used to the itchy clothing.
More fascinating than that is that Matthew Roydon indeed was a real historical figure who was rumored to have been a spy for the Queen and indeed was in many of the locations that Matthew and Diana visit during that time in history.
Luckily, that fear was incorrect.Shadow of Night starts immediately where Discovery left off and begins to weave in various historical figures throughout the book right up until the end.
In the first book there were many descriptions about the food and wine with great detail, in this one the detail is in the historical aspects.
I have no doubt I will be reading about Christopher Marlowe and Walter Raleigh due to this book.The relationship between Matthew and Diana also did not disappoint.
There was enough suspense and action to keep my interest and balance out the romance.I loved this book, just as much as the first one.
While the Twilight veins have disappeared here, Shadow of Night not only capitalises on the worst frustrations of the first book, but adds its own as well.Where we left off in The Discovery of Witches was Diana and Matthew heading to the past to find a witchy tutor for her powers, and to uncover the Ashmore 982 manuscript.But when you pick up Shadow of Night, its best you forget where we were, the time travel elements, segregated world of witches, vampires and daemons, witch powers, and that snobby and possessive Matthew that you know (in other words, everything that was good about the novel).
The story more interesting.Characters: Well writtenPlot: A step back in time to hopeful help the future.Page Turner: Yes Series Cont.?
Yes Recommend:  YesBook Boyfriend: MatthewSUMMARY (50 words or less)Again the story was long but length wasn’t the issue here.
The story wasn’t as predictable as the last.
However, there were a few plot holes that I found too big to give the book five stars.To see my full review and yummy pic, check out my blog post below.http://mybookboyfriend.blogspot.com/2...Audio ReviewJenniger Ikeda again did a stellar job.
She made the book bearable when it was slow and swept me away into this world the whole time.
October 2017: Changing my rating to 5 stars. When settling in to reread this one, all I could remember is that they were going to the past. There were so many things I was delighted to be surprised with, so many characters I loved, and a few I wanted to junk punch. I will definitely be starting book 3 right away.

👰🏼🧛🏻♂🌙☀🏰(‼Serinin 2. kitabı olduğu için, İLK KİTABIN SONUYLA İLGİLİ ÖNEMLİ SPOILER İÇERİR.) 📚“Kendine gel, Walter,” diye uyardı Matthew parlayarak.“Kendime mi geleyim! Bir cadıyla birlikte olan birisi mi soyluyor bana bunu?”“O benim karım,” diye karsılık verdi Matthew. “Cadı olmasına gelince bu odadaki herkes gercek ya da hayali, bir bicimde karalanmadı mı?”“Ama onunla evlenmek... Ne dusunuyordun?” diye sordu Walter duygusuzca.“Onu sevdigimi.”♥♥📚“Matthew Fransa’ya gidiyorsa ben de onunla birlikt
Bir cadıyla birlikte olan birisi mi söylüyor bana bunu?”“O benim karım,” diye karşılık verdi Matthew.
Ne ara onun hizmetlerini bağlamayı başardın?”“Sevgiyi bu kadar çabuk harcaman olağanüstü, Kit.” Matthew ağır ağır konuşmuştu ama sesinde uyaran bir ton vardı.“Diana gerçek adı mı yoksa müşteriler arasında cazibesini artırmak için takma ad mı kullanıyor?
Bir vampirle evlenmeyi gerçekten istiyorsan emin olmak zorundasın.”“Tekrar tekrar beni seçiyorsun ama ben aynısını istediğimde aklım başımda olmuyor, öyle mi?”“Ne istediğimi bilmek için bolca fırsatım oldu.
Daha önce bir gölgeydim, Alsop Nine’nin gölgesi gibi.”📚Elizabeth ayağa kalkarken bana, “Peruğum düz duruyor mu?” diye sordu.“Evet, Majesteleri,” dedim.
His relationship with his father, Phillippe, was difficult to read at times, because I would forget that vampire families aren't like human families.
It was interesting to read about some of Matthew's siblings/relatives and see Diana interacting with them, learning to love them in her own way.
I had thought that maybe I had missed something, when almost half way through the book, nothing was hinted at or mentioned about Diana and Matthew's physical relationship.
I was pretty disappointed with this book. I LOVED the first one. Sadly, I spent the entirety of this one wondering where the hell the main character's voice had gone. It felt like she just sat aside and let all the men around her do her talking for her. They even talked about her and insulted her in FRONT of her and she never stood up for herself. Not only that but there was almost no internal monologue. You didn't even know if she was insulted by their words.And the end was a total non-end. Hope the third is better.
In Shadow of Night, the newly married Diana and Matthew time-travel to 1590 England to learn more about Diana’s uncontrollable magical powers and to try to locate the mysterious manuscript Ashmole 782.
Diana’s understanding of her husband deepens as he interacts with old friends such as Christopher Marlowe and Sir Walter Raleigh and deals with the political events of the time, including the persecution of witches.
Matthew is forced to deal with a 21st-century wife at a time when men are accustomed to obedience.
Try not to get snarled up in theories of time travel, or think you ought to know more about the historical figures that weave in and out.
The story starts off with Matthew and Diana traveling to the 1500s to find a witch to help Diana learn how to use her powers and to find Ashmole 782.
alot of suff happens in this book and at times i felt it was too much to keep track of.
My main criticism is that there was just too much going on at times that made the story a bit confusing and i had to re-read some parts.
Mathew and Diana learn alot about each other in the past that brings them closer.
Overall great read.

I definitely think I liked this book more than the first one, but same deal, it could easily have been about 150-200 pages shorter. Plus characters were being pretty moody and whiney all the time and I get that's common for a vamp, but I wish Diana was written better. I also tend to forget that these characters are in their 30's and not teenagers...
Deborah packs so many 'Easter Eggs" into her books, we will probably never find them all, but we are sure up to the challenge of trying!
I am in the process, just like I did for A Discovery of Witches, of building a pinterest board of many of the hidden eggs that I and others have found, and I'm also including many other links to places and objects that are found in the book - just because I wanted to actually see what, for example, a farthingale bum roll was, or what the streets of Elizabethan London looked like in 1590...
The pace was once again super slow and the writing was just tiresome.
It took me hours to progress through this book at the annoyingly, slow writing pace.That said, I can usually keep up even with tiring dialogues and my desire to know the end of the story kept me trudging on through the quicksand.
Their lack of cunning was a disappointment.However, the story is a good one and I enjoyed the revelations regarding Diana’s power but the book could have been so much better without all the annoyances—unnecessary scenes, slow pace and draggy writing.Posted on Blog
The characters were well-developed and there was action and romance.
It wasn't perfect...but it was a great first book.
I had high hopes for the second book in the series....and I was very disappointed.
Too many characters and very few of them developed enough for me to care about them or want to know them better.
Their chemistry was a major factor in my enjoyment of the first book.
Please Deborah.....resist the urge to dive so deeply into the details of research and political intrigue and give us more Matthew and Diana!
I just want to lose myself in a fantasy world without the detailed history lessons.
As with A Discovery of Witches, this book is overlong and studded with references to famous people and events.
For example, the scenes with Queen Elizabeth (the first, not the current Queen) required much set-up, yet it seemed their only purpose was to continue to impress on us how important Matthew's life had been in the 1590s.
Having griped about that, I wasn't annoyed enough to stop reading - with less filler, the story of Matthew, Diana, their families and the search for Ashmole 782 would have been even better.
Still loving this series:)Woot!!!Guess what?Apparently BBC will made this trilogy into TV series! Yay:)))Ah bummer!! Not on BBC but Sky 😡😫😤But I’ll make sure I can watch it 😬Btw, I love this Diana and Matthew too:)https://deborahharkness.com/discovery...
MÜ-KEM-MEL-Dİ!Gerçekten çok severek, heyecanla, merakla ve büyük bir iştahla okuduğum bir kitap oldu.Yorumlara baktığımda genelde ikinci kitabı biraz sıkıcı bulan ya da beğenilmeyen noktaları olduğunu görmüştüm ancak ben çok beğendim.
Diana veda edebildiği insanlar düşünüldüğünde çok güçlü bir kadın olduğunu kanıtladı.Ayrıca Matthew'un vampir yeğeni Gallowglass!
(view spoiler)[ En sevdiğim kısım kesinlikle Gallowglass'ın gelecekteki kısmını okumaktı, onun hala yaşıyor olduğunu okuyunca acayip mutlu oldum :D Hele de bütün o zaman boyunca Diana'yı takip ettiğini, bir şekilde gölgelerden koruyucu meleği gibi onu koruduğunu, başarılarıyla gururlandığını ve onlarla yeniden karşılaşmak için deli gibi beklediğini okuyunca.
(view spoiler)[ Babası yaaa :'(  (hide spoiler)]Kesinlikle okunması gereken çok güzel bir kitap.
I think I'm giving up on you... I'm not sure if this is the case of its not you, it's me, but I'm just bored. I cared before about the outcome of the story, and maybe my intrigue will peak again and I'll decide to finish this trilogy, but for now, I honestly don't care. I feel like I could be using my oh so precious time to read something more worthy. Goodbye for now....
Kendi fikirleri ve söyleyecek sözü olduğu sürece, Annie'nin sadece kendisine ait olan bir şeyi olacaktır."  Cadıların Keşfi'ni hatta az daha açarsam Matthew'u ne kadar çok severek okuduğumu bilmeyen kaldı mı?
her bir satır bilgi ve tarih kokuyor.(view spoiler)[ kitap boyunca en ama en sevdiğim kısım -ki bu kısımlarda hunharca göz yaşlarına boğulmuştum- Matt'in babası ile samanlıkta yaptığı eskrim sahnesiydi.
(hide spoiler)]kitap güzeldi, hoştu fakat 1 puanı kırmamın da sebebi olan, Diana'nın güçlerini geliştirmesi için başka bir cadı arama çalışmalarının olduğu sahnelerin çok uzadığını düşünüyorum.
okurken kesinlikle sıkılmadım ama dediğim gibi o süreç çok uzamıştı bana göre.
Ms Harkness writes with such depth of character and scenic detail, that I often feel like I am in the book.
Then, I look up to discover it is 2012 and I am in the Midwest, USA!We meet many interesting characters in book #2, not the least of which is Matthew’s father, Phillipe.
You’ll need to read the books, as I feel like I’ve already told too much.My dream vacation will occur when book #3 is published.
This is what story telling is all about!I bow in gratitude to Netgalley and Penguin Group (USA) for allowing me to read this ARC in exchange for my unbiased review.Publish date: July 10, 2012
I don't know what to rate this because I was really frustrated with a lot of things that happened, but I enjoyed the story and I absolutely love Diana. I guess 3 stars \_(ツ)_/Diana and Matthew work on their relationship in this book. It got quite heavy at times.

I don't know what to rate this because I was really frustrated with a lot of things that happened, but I enjoyed the story and I absolutely love Diana.
I guess 3 stars ¯\_(ツ)_/¯Diana and Matthew work on their relationship in this book.
Matthew irritated me for about half the book.
The plot in this was similar to book one.
I did like meeting cool historical figures of the past, but everything was so drawn out and at times very tedious.
Ashmole 782 is barely even talked about until the second half of the book.
There is no jumping on the bandwagon in the middle with this one.***Warning: beyond this point there are a few spoilers.***One of my biggest peeves with a lot of time travel fiction is when the primary characters are constantly meeting historically famous people to an unrealistic point.
It seemed like everything that had me excited about "A Discovery of Witches" was non-existent or stunted in "Shadow of Night." The character development throughout was pretty poor, the story would drag impossibly slow through some times and then suddenly skip quickly over others, and the plot seemed to lose its way sometimes.
