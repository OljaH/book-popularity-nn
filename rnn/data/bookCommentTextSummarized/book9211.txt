No One Writes to the Colonel is a prototypical nothing-happens short story in which the reader is swept up in the gorgeous writing and is more than willing to overlook the nothingness. It's the same kind of beautiful nothingness as the Grand Canyon. You walk up to the edge of this magnificent hole and marvel at the void and all its intricacies, the jagged edges, the visible layers of time, and the certainty that although all you see right now is inertia, you know that at one time something of great importance flowed through here.
This book, first published in 1961, is about an unnamed colonel who fought during the Thousand Days War (1899-1902).
He and his wife are now old, sickly and have just lost their only son.
But I love my wife and she always makes sure that there is something to eat on the table ha ha.The title refers to the waiting that the colonel is doing.
Maybe because we share a lot of things, e.g., names, religion, words, culture, beliefs, etc with them.
Philippines was of course under Spanish occupation for 300 years.My second book by G.G. Marquez and he is still to disappoint.
The colonel desperately tries to sell their inheritance from their only son who is now dead and eventually the only reminder of his existence is a rooster that the colonel trains to take part in a cockfight.Garcia Marquez has said in interviews that his characteristic storytelling style is the style of his grandmother, and that some of his best characters are patterned after his grandfather, whom he calls the most important figure in his life.
He is a metaphysical and poetic writer, not a propagandist or a social realist.Garcia Marquez, primarily because of the popular and critical reception of "One Hundred Years of Solitude", is perhaps the best-known writer in the Latin American explosion of talent that has taken place since the 1960’s.
And no good thing ever die.'This story is all about hope and whenever I think of hope,these are the lines that come into my head.
I do not know whether the author has a first-hand experience of poverty..
The same was the case when I read the previous book..
His words seems to bring out lost and forgotten things,creating a mood of passivity.
I just remember them and think that such things had happened a long while ago.
I don't think I'll recommend this book to everyone.
But I'll be selective in recommending this book.
Once you've read enough of Gabriel García Márquez, you'll realise, deep down, it's all the same story.
And when you've reached that point, it doesn't matter if the story had 6 pages or 600.
Because what Márquez presents, that others cannot, isn't bound by the limits of a story or the length of it.
Words, were not the point.
Márquez can make the reader's heart swell with joy or squeeze in pain by his whims.
It's in the whiteness of the pages, the pauses.
We can master the words, even beat them, but we are all equally defenceless against the pauses.
This books seems to say 'well you got what you said you wanted, how's it going?'.
And the answer is: Not very well at all.The bleak reality shown in these stories show a country suffering from so many wounds and disappointments it's hard to believe that it still functions.
In all of these stories it fairly much doesn't but I guess the country itself is managing to hold itself together.
I didn't much like the stories themselves, even the title one (No One Writes to the Colonel).
They don't really go anywhere and just seem to be vehicles for Marquez to complain fairly endlessly about how crap Columbia is now.
კუჭის თავში რომ გარტყამენ სუნთქვა გეკვრება და საკმაოდ მტკივნეულიცაა. ამას გარდა კიდევ ერთი პლუსი აქვს; აშკარა კვალი არ რჩება, სახეში დარტყმისგან განსხვავებით. მარკესს ოდესმე თუ უჩხუბია, ალბათ სგავაგან არც დაარტყმდა მოწინააღმდეგეს. პროჭი ეგ
But they are separate stories, and some just don't feel complete.No One Writes to the Colonel: two and a half starsTuesday Siesta: two and a half starsOne of These Days: three and a half starsThere Are No Thieves in This Town: four starsBalthazar's Marvelous Afternoon: four starsMontiel's Widow: two and a half starsOne Day After Saturday: two and a half starsArtificial Roses: two and a half starsBig Mama's Funeral: three starsThe ones with two and a half stars are well-written and have interesting characters, but I didn't feel like I was reading them for a purpose.
იმედი მაგარი რამეა, შეიძლება ყველაზე მაგარიც კი."სიღარიბის ყველაზე ცუდი თვისება ის არის, რომ ადამიანს აიძულებს იცრუოს".
As usual, once you pick it up and you stop when its done. Like all other short stories, this also engulfs you and pushes you to think the expected and understand the reality as is.
I listen to this book in the audible format. I have read some of the reviews of others here on Goodreads and recommend that you do likewise. It seems that this author has a lot to say but I have to admit that I must've missed it. This is the story about poverty and hope. The old couple is still waiting for the man's pension after 15 years. He fought for his country and now has been forgotten. Poverty and the battle against it is a main focus in my intellectual and political life.

Pasakojimai apie Kolumbijos kaimo žmonių gyvenimo akimirkas, susijusias su egzistenciniais klausimais (gyvenimo prasmės, vertybių, rutinos įveikimo ir kt.) bei komiškais ir mistiniais įvykiais (dvasiomis, angelu ir kt.). Perskaičius trumposios prozos kūrinius, galima susimąstyti apie Markeso romano “Šimtas metų vienatvės” herojus vėl pasirodančius siužete, Lotynų Amerikos žmonių pasaulėjautą.
After studying Crónica de una muerte anunciada (Chronicle of a Death Foretold) the year before, I thought that this was a waste of my time and absolutely hated this book because Chronicle of a Death Foretold was a sublime read and to me, at that time, No One Writes to the Colonel seemed like a bore.
The situation of the colonel and his wife is something that constantly distresses me every time I read it (I still can't believe that after so much years, he still waits for the pension).
Sharper stories then you might think, since GGM is mostly known for his epics and sprawling narratives.You do get a sense that he's sort of warming up for the bigger stuff gestating in his subconscious.
Not too noticeably but still since you know the reputations of what's yet to come (I haven't read his huge works yet, just give me time!) you get a feeling that he's hampered by the condensed quality of what he's come up with."There Are No Theives In This Town" is one of my favorite stories ever.
The title story is excellent, too.
Повесть «Полковнику никто не пишет» наверное одна из лучших книг Габриэля Гарсии Маркеса.Столь длительные надежды и ожидания, боль главной потери, и главное надежда, которая порой выходит за рамки разумного…Данное произведение должно понравиться большинству читателей. А вот само окончание я бы немного изменил, всё же автор переборщил немного в самом финале…
Much like the Southern Gothic writers, he has the ability to create a unique and dizzying sense of place (albeit not as inhabitable and intimidating as the worlds of Faulkner and McCarthy!)No One Writes To the Colonel is a collection of nine stories – the mention of which also brings to mind another collection of short stories that are among my favourites, written by J.D. Salinger - that are centered on life in Macondo, the village that came to prominence in his masterful 100 Years of Solitude.
Escrito antes mesmo de Cem anos de solidão, ele já conta com uma pequena aparição de Aureliano Buendía e Macondo também é citada.Como sempre, a forma como ele descreve qualquer coisa vai além de apenas palavras e é possível sentir na pele o nível de pobreza, saudade, ansiedade e leve desespero em que vivem o Coronel e sua esposa.
Além, é claro, de traduzir em realidade o que a burocracia pode causar na vida de algumas pessoas.
A espera por uma ajuda, por uma resposta, por um caminho pode condenar muitas pessoas a mais desespero do que podemos imaginar.Conto intenso, escrito por um dos maiores escritores que já existiu.

Spend some time with the Colonel, a man who spends his days waiting for his retirement pension from the government to finally begin to arrive, hoping against hope that the mad bureaucracy of the government will pull it together before he runs out of money.
But the man just can't bring himself to give it away.
The actions surges and drains, characters give gifts they can't afford to give, people die, dynasties fall apart, but the world moves on.
While Marquez's writing isn't what I would call spellbinding, his efforts demonstrate the love he has for this little province, Macondo, and all the people in it.
Beautiful prose even in translation. The choice of details results in a remarkably rich setting expressed in few words. One Hundred Years of Solitude should be read first if you want to catch the references.
One of those book that you can't wait to finish, but once you do, you feel empty and sad knowing that you'll never read anything like it.
მავანნმა სთქვეს მარკესი კარგიაო, აი ვცადე მეც.
Excellent short stories by the magical realism master himself. One of the best things about Marquez' stories is his ability to capture the essence of reality through abstraction. This book is a series of wonderful stories that everyone should read.
Excellent nothingness! 😃
It is a lovely place to start.Señor Márquez often remarked that "No One Writes to the Colonel" was his best work.
These works of short fiction offer a ticket to another world, and a journey to another time.If you have not read the work of Gabriel García Márquez, I cannot think of a better place to start.
If you are already a veteran reader of the Señor, perhaps you have missed this volume of short fiction.
He always meets expectations and exceeds them, and No One Writes to the Colonel is no exception.This story takes place within the same time line as Hundred Years of Solitude and My Melancholy Whores, during the Thousand Days' War. The fact that we never found out the names of the main characters of the story is proof of how insignificant human life was during those times in Colombia.
The Colonel has been waiting for his pension payment to arrive for fifteen years.
Of course they weren't good times for those who were living it, but with Marquez'a beautiful story telling I found myself wanting to go and see it for myself.I suggest you read this book on a hot, lazy day and then take a good long nap.
The story follows the life of a retired colonel who is slowly starving to death as he waits in tandem for a check from the government (for his years of service in the military) and for the cock fight that he is sure his prize-winning bird will win.I found this story charming and sad; and impregnated with the realities I have come to know in many years living all around Latin America.
So many people around the region face similar struggles; getting their constipated bureaucratized governments to honor their commitments; fighting to make ends meet after they are too old for others to have use of them; desperately seeking an unlikely providential solution that will lead to prosperity.Gabo captures the suffering naturally, telling a story about which he knows a great deal.
His "No One Writes to the Colonel and Other Stories" is certainly not of the same caliber, although - to me - one of the stories is a gem that redeems the whole collection.The plot of the title novella takes place during troubled times in Colombia - the 1950's La Violencia that claimed lives of more than 100,000 people.
The novella presents a grim and extremely sad story about an elderly couple: the colonel has been waiting for over 15 years for the pension that is due to him because of his participation in the Thousand Days' War almost 60 years ago (1899 - 1902).
Sì, direi che questo è il modo più sintetico per definire questa raccolta di racconti.
E Macondo è, come la gabbia di fil di ferro creata da Baltazar in uno di questi racconti, “un’avventura della fantasia”, uno di quei miracoli della letteratura che non si ripetono tanto spesso.Il più articolato e compiuto scritto è, senza dubbio, quello da cui la raccolta prende il nome: Nessuno scrive al colonnello.
