Of all the discworld 'themes' I like the City Watch the best. This one introduces some great new characters who stick around for several more books. Good story, good jokes
very funThe book came well recommended and it was very fun. Lots of laughs and I had a very good time reading it.
Unique writing style. Story flows rather effortlessly but it does little good to try to anticipate the flow of events. A good read especially if you want to avoid any reference to modern day events.

I love the watch series more than Amy of the discworld themes. This one doesn’t disappoint! Carrot is such a great character. I can’t wait for the next one.

Probably the best of "The Night Watch" Disc World books I have read thus far.
The best so far. Funny and touching as always, but also a great mystery.

This is just one of Terry Pratchett's many Discworld novels, the entire series is terrific.
I am partial to the ones that focus on Ankh Morpork's City Watch and the always entertaining and clever Commander Vimes.
It's easy to become overwhelmed when approaching this series for the first time as there are well over 40 of them, so my advice is start at the beginning and if you don't like the subject or storyline, go on to the next.
I find the ones focusing on the Wizards to be slow but be sure to check out the witches(The Wyrd Sisters)and anything set in Ankh Morpork.
I am actually disappointed!
It is a little lethargic, and you really need to cajole yourself to get into main story.
And, when things become interesting, Mr. Pratchett, does not give details, which keeps you pondering through the pages to look for answers.
This really makes it a toil.The political sarcasm exists but it failed to lure me.
It could have been better with more things happening, but the story lacks adrenalin!Its a comic-crime novel.
But, the comedy stops, as soon as you start to grin and the crime scenes does not give you a vivid picture!
Hope, I don't come across the same with other stories!
'Personal isn't the same as important' Carrot does it for me in this book. He is, I think, one of my most beloved characters. He and Gaspode constantly tugged at my heartstrings. Poor Detritus, to loose Cuddy so soon after finding him. I wonder what Vetinari's end game is? I simply loved this book. Thoroughly enjoyed it too.Terry Pratchett had a brilliant, brilliant mind. Witty, wickedly funny and smart. I almost wish I'd discovered his work a little sooner, but I guess, some books only find you when you are ready.
Pretty entertaining book. Some of the same issues I typically have with Pratchett: sometimes too silly and not really fantasy. In Men at Arms, he introduces some very likable characters who deal with circumstances that actually raise some thought-provoking questions, including race relations, gun control, and capital punishment. The murder mystery is a little hard to follow, at times, and it seemed like a lot of running around with nowhere to go for much of the book. Overall, reasonably fun, sometimes funny, but not great literature.
Well, I was re-reading this until my 10 month old puppy chewed it to shreds... Luckily it was my own personal copy and not a library book. I have moved onto another City Watch Discworld book: Feet of Clay.
Incredibly well abridged to maintain the story words flow and feel of Pratchett's novel, while making it possible to perform on stage. Impressed by the feel of wholeness despite being less than half the length.
Any one of the discword novels with the "city watch" are an instant five stars for me!Pratchett did to fantasy what Douglas Adams did to science fiction!
Love all of Terry Pratchett's Books - But especially fond of the Men at Arms series.
If you read only one Pratchett series, read the watch series.
a hilarious story about disc world and the nights watch...
I love Terry Pratchett. Every work is witty, silly, and entertaining. Occasionally he makes you think about a thing or two as well :)
Funny,witty and a berry good read
This is an excellent example of Terry Pratchett's engaging, hilarious style. I personally love the characters in the Watch, especially Carrot.
Never fails to entertain
