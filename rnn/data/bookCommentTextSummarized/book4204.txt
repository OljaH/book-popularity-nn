I read this earlier As freebie online, for Batman 75th Anniversary. I love that it is issue 27...that's my number! Also nice to see Bill Finger get credit instead of Bob Kane.For what it created, this book is invaluable.
PUM 💥 PUNCH 👊crack
The very first original comic of the "Bat-man"! It was a funny, short comic strip that made me appreciate the comics I am reading now and thanking whoever it was that decided to upgrade the drawings of Batman (and the name change). I liked reading this comic. (Short review but it was a short comic).
3.5Es muy básica y simple la historia, además de bastante cortita, pero es la primer aparición de Batman, y me gustó.
Wow, the original 1939 Batman was quite a dark, unattractive character, especially compared with the 1938 Superman.
The victims he saves or avenges are his fellow wealthy chums; he has no interest in exposing the criminals to public justice; and no regrets when he kills a bad guy ("A fitting end for his kind.").
Whereas 1938 Superman's battles are to expose and bring to justice villains whose victims are the public and the traditionally oppressed - the corrupt Senator, the wife-beating husband, the lynch mob, the exploitative landlord.
The two original Superheroes really are completely different characters who stand for very different values.
I thought it a good idea to look at how this story began more than 75 years ago.
Though this story is very dated, it is quite an original idea that has stood the test of time.
A lot of the dated things about it have to do with the nascence of the medium as to anything else.
The way they do exposition in the background has changed a lot over the years, and the art styles can paneling have become much more dynamic, so it is really hard to compare to current day comics.
Qué mal han envejecido los cómics, incluso los que tienen 30-40 años, pero estos aún más. Sorprende, y más en comparación a la novela, que algunas de milenios siguen siendo obras maestras a día de hoy. Todas las historias son planas y repetitivas, como hechas por una plantilla. Lo único destacable, el inicio de Batman y ver otras creaciones de los padres de Superman como Spy o Slam Bradley, que no son gran cosa.
Batman fans will love thisThe Caped Crusader at his beginnings. Takes me back to my childhood, not that I'm that old, it's just one of the first comics I ever read. It was great rereading this old favorite again. A should read for any Batman fan, or any comic book fan, for that matter.
Wow. Hard to believe that this kicked off a kajillion dollar franchise. Nothing is developed in any coherent way, nor is this especially different from any other comic in the era. It seems like the climax of the story is the reveal that "The Bat-man" (always in quotes) is Bruce Wayne. But even in the context of this story, why does it matter?
The original "Batman" is such a pulp hero that it's hard to recognize how he became a key part of the superhero mythos. Reading this is a flashback to a different era and genre, where the rich socialite gets invited to come along with the police commissioner; it'd be interesting if Batman were remembered as a Castle-like procedural than anything else.
It's free ...a nice investmentNice to see the origins of the Bat Man. The story is very simple and the artwork is primitive but therein lies the charm of these early issues. I like the casual manner Batman treats the death of a character and shows that he was not timid about killing a villain if circumstances presented themselves. A good free download.
Batman's first appearance in the world of comics. A quick mystery solved and the plot twist...Bruce Wayne is Batman. The story was awful but it was written in 1937 and I don't know how much one should expect. It is interesting to see the true origins of Batman and to be reading history which is why it is 3 stars.
Batman begins in mysteryThe story starts put not knowing who Batman is. I love some of the nostalgia with the action words. A really interesting start to the classic hero.
I loved itIt was action and chemicals i just loved it thank youYou should make more comic's rated 4 star 🌟
Different stylesIt is interesting the way that the style of Batman has changed over the years.. And the storylines tones have changed also.
A goodstartIt's a good place to start. It's fun to read Bat man as an actual detective. I'm looking forward to reading future ones.
A great quick read of the story that introduced The Bat-Man.
First Batman sort of surprisingMore like a detective than a superhero, deals with mundane white collar crime than street brawling. Probably responsible for killing a guy too.
For Batman's 75th Anniversary this year, I had the opportunity to read this very first story about Bruce Wayne, the brave, courageous man who fights evil by stopping bad guys and protecting the innocent as The Batman.
Very cool checking out the graphics of the people, clothes, cars, etc., from 1939.
Batman is mysterious and cool.
The intensity of the story and how bad those Batman was trying to stop is clearly shown in the story.
Thankfully, there are brave people willing to risk their lives to save others.
This is a must-read comic for all Batman fans, without a doubt.
Classic!Just a nice classic from the Golden Age of comics. I remember a long time ago when I was a kid, my grandfather (God rest his soul) told me how characters like Batman and Superman had been around ever since he was young... But I digress. Reading this takes me back to that memory and how I wondered what it was like to be a kid in the late 30s... Reading about Batman for the first time ever. Great stuff.
This comic is a classicI mean this is a great comic book. I'm not saying it's the best comic book ever. But the reason I say this is because it is the first batman series I mean some of the comic BOB Kane wrote in his time were better,BUT,this is just the showcase of the beginning of great comics.
I read a 75th anniversary special edition of this story. It had the original version of Dectective Comics #27 and then a newer "updated" version. I loved seeing the two side by side and seeing how Batman has evolved. Batman has always been my favorite comic book hero so it was really neat to see his first appearance.
Nothing more to say that others haven't, but it was really cool seeing the start of Batman. He isn't the Batman pop culture has come to know here, and in some ways he's so much cooler in this story than in the over-the-top tv and film versions.
The very first appearance of the Bat-Man in the six-page story .ما ينفعش تتقيم بمعايير تقييم رسومات وكتب الكوميك دلوقتى ..لكنها عبقريتها إن من الفكرة دى والعدد دا بدأ كل شئ له علاقة ببات مان
Pretty cool, been along time since I read a Batman comic and this one was a nice change of pace from a traditional reading. Liked the graphics, decent storyline and will have to read more of these.
This was a refreshing read, because I was having trouble finding good comics. It was neat seeing how different comics were back then. I thoroughly enjoyed reading this comic.
The Bat-Man!
Fun readIt was fun to go back and read the original story. Very different than the modern depictions seen in movies, etc.
Fun look at one of the first Batman comics.
