I have read this book annually or biannually since I was 10, and each time it has new meaning. Contrary to popular belief, this is not a "chick read"; it's historical, social, and political as well as sexual. The depth of character development and plot and the lyricism of Mitchell's writing never ceases to engage and amaze me. Highly recommended for everyone.
"Tebi treba neko da te ljubi i to neko ko zna znanje"...
I have really been enjoying this book.
I am so disappointed in the movie.
They should have made it at least three more hours and added all the important things they left out.
I enjoyed the movie but was surprised how much they left out.
The book, on the other hand, has been very enjoyable.
The movie can not begin to capture the extent of their personalities.
I highly recommend this book to anyone who loves a messed up romance, times of chivalry, or the old South.
This book would have gotten five stars if it weren't for the uncomfortable language.
Defenantly one of my all time favorites!! I'm OBSESSED with this book! It's exactly what I was looking for! Romance, war, and characters so real! I would recommend it !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Read this 3 times and breathed, slept and dreamed Scarlett O'Hara for years. I was 11 or 12, so we are talking a long time ago. I still recall scenes in my mind from the book and lines between Brett and Scarlett.
I read first part of this book. Sometimes i didn't understand what and why main character does, but i really liked it.
Best book ever!
I love Scarlett and Rhet a long time. I read this book many times. The film is so good as the book. I love charismatic Clark Gable and Vivien Leigh is so beautiful...
Scarlett is a bad mother. I am so lucky to have never lived through a war on my soil.
It was one of my favorite books during my early teens. This rating is based on my opinion at the time of reading it. Probably I would give it a lower rating if I was to reread it now, but it has lost its attraction for me a long time ago, so a rereading is out of question.From what I recall the title itself was the perfect summary of the book and it contained interesting historical and cultural information about America.
Читала очень давно, но до сих пор помню имена главных героев (что обычно бывает редко) Скарлетт и Ретт Батлер.
Какая любовь..Очень нравилось читать моменты вместе с ними.
Я думала, что не осилю, но вскоре они были прочитаны не за такой уж большой промежуток времени.
Автор не дает нам конечного итога романа, читатели должны его сами додумывать, что произойдет с героями, и у меня в мыслях только хороший конец.
Часто видела, что начали выпускать другие книги (якобы продолжение), но никто ещё не отзывался о них с восторгом.
Цитаты: "Я не буду думать об этом сегодня.
Подумаю об этом завтра"
Gone With the Wind has been on my list of favorite books for a long time.
I started re-reading it on my nook and then halfway through my nook froze and died.
And for weeks all I could think about was reading this book.
Reading quickly to gobble it up but also trying to slow down so it wouldn't.
The book is just so intricately woven.
It's one of those that is going to send me into a depression now that it's over.
I'm going to have to re-watch the movie to live in the world a little longer.
Ohromně mě bavilo zjišťovat jak probíhat život v 19.století, postoj "Jižanů" k válce a nakonec objevit zcela nový postoj k americké občanské válce. Scarlett má spoustu chyb, stejně jako každý jiný člověk, ale hlavně ke konci byla zcela pochopitelnou mladou ženou, která už neměla na výběr. Což si její setry ani její služebnictvo neuvědomovalo. Scarlett mi byla blízká, stejně jako Melanie, Ashley a další postavy. Příběh je krásný a rozhodně promyšlený a klade důraz na samostatný lidský život a jeho změnu ve válce. Pokud někdo má jakékoliv otázky ohledně války Severu proti jihu, kniha vám je snad všechny zodpoví.
I first read this book in high school.
It was a struggle but well worth it.
I read it again a few years later in college, much easier to read.
The last time I read it, I could appricate the book as a well written story based on actual events.
Each time I've read this novel, I have always have felt I learned something.
I can also understand why the movie had so many directors (three?
four?)there are just too many story lines to work with!
So I have ONE book of Gone With the Wind, not parts 1 & 2.
DUMB. DUMB. DUMB. SO DUMB IT HURTS.JUST SHUT UP. YOU'RE STUPID.NO MORE PLEASE! YOU DUMB B*******SNORE**** BORING *****
I read this book when I was 10. I barely broke for food and trips to the ladies...in fact, I think I took it with me to the ladies....anyway. It took about a day and a half. When I was done, I had a miserable crick in my neck, but I wanted to read it again--immediately.If you get bogged down in the section that's all battles and stuff, give yourself permission to skip it. You'll get through it when you re-read this novel.
I really hate Scarlett because she is stupid. she leaves someone who loves her for someone who doesnt care about her and he is going to marry from someone else. Scarlett waits for the moment to be alone with ashely to ask him if he loves her or not. Also when she got married she didnt changed and loved her husband the whole thing she wanted from the world is "ASHELY". And I think Ashely will never tell her what she wants to hear it from him(less)
I'm sorry. I forgot to write review on this application last week.1.level 42.Oct.26.40min, 27.50min,29.40min3.love,war,men,women,sad,father,atlanta4.a) there is a woman who is Scarlett o'hara. she is loved many men. But she was loving Ashley...b) Scarlett was loving Ashley. but he married with another woman. But she was continuing to love him.. But he became missing during a war. ..5.War robed many love from many people. This is part one of this story. So I will continue to read part 2
Every summer, as I adjust my sunglasses and lean back with an iced tea on the beach, I revisit this grand story of southern mystique, a splash of civil war history, and one woman's journey from naive debutant to full-blooded vixen. All women ask themselves, at some point in their lives, "Is he an Ashley or is he a Rhett?"...
i read this when i was 11 or 12 and was surprised to absolute love it. no idea how much i would like it now. i read a 500-page hard bound copy i found on my mother's shelves. i watched the movie afterward, and it's actually shocking how much depth and grit is removed in the film version. the film is the cheesiest of cheese.
It was...different.This was something that caught me by surprise in my teens. It was one of the first english novels I ever attempted to read and to be honest, I am completely satisfied. I believe that Gone with the Wind is indeed one of a kind. I spent a good part of my life reading books and watching films & series but I still haven't gotten around something similar to it.A classic indeed.
My quintessential love-hate book. we all have one like this. I cannot help loving the characters in their imperfections. Margaret Mitchell is a spectacular story-teller. You cannot forget Tara. or Rhett Butler. and most of all Scarlett O'Hara. I carry this book in my heart.
I admit it! I was nervous to start the Tome that is GWtW and this was a nice little intro. I dont think many people would choose to do it this way and I'd probably recommend going straight for the original novel!
the beautiful Scarlett learns that Ashley,the man she loves in secret,is going to marry another woman.even the terrible American Civil War is nothing compared to her broken heart.but one man knows her secret ,the handsome and dangerous Rhett Butler..
:)دوست دارم کتابشودلم می خواد یه بار دیگه بخونمشموقع خوندنش دوست داشتم قسمت هایی که درباره تاریخ و جنگ صحبت می شه زود تموم بشه و زندگی اسکارلت رو توضیح بده :Dهنوز نمی دونم چجوری حدس زدی من این جور کتاب ها رو دوست دارم!!
I really enjoyed it! I rediscovered characters I thought I knew very well, and discovered one I really like, even if he has not been there very long. My favorite thing was to understand better how the bond between Scarlett and Melly was formed...
Autant en emporte le vent en français.Film culte... Roman culte aussi.Fait partie de la bibliothèque idéale. Le dosage fresque historique, intrigue et personnages attachants est parfait.À lire avant de voir le film pour ne pas être influencée par l'interprétation des acteurs.5/5
i read it thousands time, each time i think about the end. hoping she is back to Rhatt
ahh...luv scarlett
Favourite book during my teens, along with To kill a mockingbird.
