No, GoodReads. NO.How about NO FUCKING STARS?Quick, someone get me chocolate. Lots and lots of chocolate! I should have known that when Lauren Kate blurbed this book I wouldn't like it. No, wait, that doesn't fully express my hatred for Starcrossed. How about this:After reading this shit storm of a book I feel like I should go straight to my book shelf and give "Catastrophe": Hush, Hush,  "My Eyes, They Bleed!": House of Night, "Kill it with Fire!": Twilight, and even, yes,  "Are You Fuckin' Kid
How about this:After reading this shit storm of a book I feel like I should go straight to my book shelf and give "Catastrophe": Hush, Hush,  "My Eyes, They Bleed!": House of Night, "Kill it with Fire!": Twilight, and even, yes,  "Are You Fuckin' Kidding Me?!": Carrier of the Mark all 5 glorious stars.This is the worst book I have ever read.Why, oh, why did I read it?
Helen is so damn useless powerful and horny that she pretty much starts playing Lady GaGa's Love Game, trying to take off Lucas' clothes at every opportunity she gets.Let's have some fun this beat is sick.
Starcrossed is the story of a teenage school girl, Helen, who meets new boy, Lucas, and tries to murder him with her bare hands for no reason.
Lucas, also, wishes to kill Helen in a horrifically violent way because they’re both demigods on the opposite side of a war.I really thought this book was going to kill me – either with hypertension or an aneurysm for all the times it had me almost screaming in frustration.
Lucas and Helen don’t really hate each other and nobody in this story actually has a reason to hate anyone else.
Y didn’t I know abt this?Fangirl 2: No silly, it’s tht nu buk by Josephine Angelini, cald Starcrossed.
*random Twilight factoid*)Anyway, moving on, boy and girl do, of course, fall in love, but they can NEVER be together!
Like the fact that Helen’s dad is a single father who spends most of the book watching sports on TV and being away on work at all the crucial times.
Also there are several points in the book where Angelini seems to be trying too hard to refute the fact that she is writing Twilight fanfic.
I'm going to talk about the two main freaks of the book.Helen Hamilton:Grams is a Mary Sue. She's so damn perfect and untouchable that it's difficult for me to relate to her.
Everytime Jerry tries to talk to her or ask her anything, she completely disregards him and flees.Lucas:Did he even exist in the book?
Lucas makes Edward Cullen look like the most complex character in the world.
She didn't even seem like she knew what she was talking about.I do not know what happens in the next 200 and something pages I decided to not read.
--->WHAT THE HOLY GRENADE WAS THAT?! <---A damn good book, that’s what that was. ;)I am officially a Josephine Angelini fan, that’s for sure. She’s one intelligent, story-choreographic, badass woman! She definitely wrote a book that, from the very first page, has it all:Romance.Suspense.Intrigue. Action.Mythology. And it has Lucas Delos.*eyebrow waggle*  ____________________________________________♦   Helen   ♦ Helen Hamilton has always been different.She’s workin’ her way up to being 5’11
<---A damn good book, that’s what that was.
And when the Delos family comes into town, and has very similar abilities… she gets a LOT curious.Especially when Lucas Delos, who she can’t decide if she wants to kiss or kill, tells her she’s a demigod.
Lucas introduces Helen to his greek tragedy of a world.He and his family alone teach her how to fight, to defend, and to reach her full potential.But he can’t touch her.He can’t hold her.He can’t kiss her.He can’t love her.And he desperately wants to.
“If I kiss you, I won’t stop,” he said in a desperate whisper.
As a little backstory to why Paris even found Helen in the first place was, one day, the three main goddesses (Aphrodite, Hera, and Athena) appeared to Paris while he was tending his sheep, for he was thought to be the most beautiful man in the world (and also the son of king Priam although he didn't know that yet) and asked him to tell them who was the most beautiful.
Paris, being the  exceptional  man whore that he his, said Aphrodite was the most beautiful, and she promised him the then Helen of Sparta, then married to Menelaus and already with one child, Hermione.
This is a story of an impossible love and two people destined to repeat history...Wanna know who I loved most in the book?I was never a fan of Helen and Paris, dunno why, and in this book the main couple certainly didn't change my mind.I liked Hector the best, he is an amazing character and I wish HE was the main one instead of Paris, but oh well, can't have everything :(The world buildingWell, like I said, the main story here is the Trojan war about to repeat itself, and Paris+Helen's tragic love story happening all over again.What's different here is that all the main characters are descendants of Greek gods.They have special powers (when I say special powers I mean every damn possible power you can think of and then some you can't).A bit too perfect for a half-god, didn't like that part.There are pages and pages of rehashing Greek history (unfortunately for me, I know Greek history/mythology very well so I got bored at that part but oh well :D).Still, it was interesting, it really was :DDThe storyHelen is the most beautiful woman ever.
And here's why.Starcrossed is set on Nantucket island and features the shy, willowy Helen as she gears up for the first day of her junior year of high school.
I can't help but feel that Angelini decided to smash two popular things together to try to make something new and failed miserably.I see that she loves Meyers.
The problem is that no matter how much I (and everyone) loved Twilight (and the subsequent books) upon the initial reading there seems to be a universally agreed upon fact.
I didn't like the voice of the main character, the smashed together plot line (which I feel I've read before) and the direction it was going.
I love anything to do with retellings and/or Greek mythology, so this book was really fun.
No matter what way I try to describe this book it keeps sounding cheesy so...
fine, maybe it is kind of silly BUT I STILL LOVE IT.Helen is a Nantucket teen who has the face of Helen of Troy and demigod powers, but doesn't know what's going on.
The younger son Lucas has the same face as Paris, aaaand the star-crossed lovers story from Troy starts to unfold all over again.
The worldbuilding, creative blending of Greek myths, strong characters, solid relationships, and execution definitely turned what could have been a cheesy plot into something genuinely entertaining.
I can say overall that I have very few complaints with the characters besides the intrinsically perfect quality of the main character, Helen, and her equally perfect star-crossed love, Lucas.The plot is fairly confusing, but essentially the Delos family moves onto the Nantucket island where Helen and her single father has lived their whole life.
No wonder Hector hated her." Helen learns from her mistakes.The rest of the characters in the book were very well done.
I ended up liking them all immensely.I love the fact that the girls in the Delos family are beautiful, stunning, smart, but also kind and never jealous of Helen.
Sowas a la Twighlight-Teenager-Highschool-Lovestory 🙄 aber ich mochte die Richtung in die die Geschichte ging und obwohl ich dachte, dass es durchaus viele Parallelen zu Percy Jackson - griechische Mythologie halt - geben könnte, war das absolut nicht der Fall.
Allerdings sind mir hier manche noch nicht so ganz klar/logisch, aber das kommt vielleicht mit dem nächsten Band.
Also für den Plot gibt es auf jeden Fall einen Daumen hoch 👍🏻 die Charaktere fand ich eigentlich auch alle ganz gut, auch wenn mir unsere Protagonistin Helen manchmal ein wenig suspekt war.
Aber alles in allem wurde ich hier nicht enttäuscht.
I just finished this book and I don’t know if I want to scream or cry!
You know it’s going to lead to heartbreak, and yet you keep reading regardless--I love that!This book had a great cast of characters, Helen and Lucas obviously, but Hector, Jason, Arianne, Cassandra, Claire were all big draws for me.
First I have to say that he reminded me of a certain vampire we all know *cough* Edward Cullen *cough* but not in a way that occasionally annoys me like in other books.
It’s a story you start and don’t want to stop.
I was left thinking about it long after I finished this enthralling story that entwines Greek mythology and modern day times so flawlessly and with such vivid accuracy I almost question if Ms. Angelini had witnessed the Gods-and all that that entails-herself.Helen has lived her entire life on Nantucket Island, she’s always known she was different so she tries very hard to ‘fly under the radar’.
The entire Delos family is a mystery to Helen; at first she hates the very sound of their name, it’s only when she sees Lucas Delos the first time and tries to kill him that she begins to come to terms with who or what she is.
And so, Helen discovers she actually has special unbelievable abilities, as flying and that she’s not the only one!I didn’t really like the main character, Helen, because I truly couldn’t connect with her!
Lucas clearly liked to give orders and, if he ever gave one to me, I would not have obeyed!
Just for the mythology, I would certainly be reading the sequels.I though the writing wasn’t impressive, actually simple but good enough.
I embarked in the story but felt no connection with Helen and Lucas, and their love for each other.
I read these 400 some pages in one afternoon, because I simply could not stop.I don't know it if was because I found the story so addicting or if it was because I was enchanted by the cast of characters.
This wasn't a story where the character is completely surprised that they are a little different, yet at the same time Helen still discovers what exactly she is and what exactly it mean to be her.
she really did!After that ending, and the history that we learn about in the story, I am dying to read the next book.
I love characters whose personalities aren't clear-cut black or white - ones who are motivated by both good and evil.
We are left hanging at the end, but I don't mind it in this case because I still have so much to mull over in this book.
(And a year to re-read the Iliad so that I'll be up to par on all of the back-stories.) That is not to say I won't be doing everything I can to wrangle an advance copy of Book 2!I am proud to say that Josie and I will be traveling together on the Dark Days of Summer tour.
Check.A strong, real, wonderful heroine who seemed like an actual person instead of a reader/author insert?
She's aware that she's a little stronger and faster than the people around her, but she wants to get on with her normal, human life, so she pushes that away too.When she first meets the gorgeous new boy in town (Lucas) and his gorgeous family, is she instantly smitten by how beautiful they are, and fancying herself in love?
I love it when I feel as if each and every person in a story is nuanced and interesting enough to probably carry a book of her own, and STARCROSSED pulls that off and more.
On one hand this book is without a doubt a direct rip off of Twilight.
The only thing different was the characters' names.On the other hand it was still a very entertaining book with many likable characters and a fun, interesting story very loosely based on Greek mythology.
The beautiful people are descendants of the Greek gods instead of vampires but they are still super strong and fast and can do things like see into the future or fly or heal others.
All a bit silly really but so much fun to read that I am still going to give it four stars:)
Zu meiner Rezension: https://youtu.be/X-gkWJiT1JM
WOW. Nemůžu. Uvěřit. Že. Jsem. To. Opravdu. DOČETLA! Zasloužím si medaili, protože Proroctví mě stálo hodně pevné nervy a tunu zmrzliny navrch. :DVzkaz pro osobu, která mi TOHLETOTO doporučila:Milá Maťo, jestli se my dvě někdy potkáme... domů se vrátíš skrz poštu .. a bude to spousta balíčků. Poštovné mi za to stojí! :*Vzkaz pro ty, co TOHLETOTO přirovnávají k Percymu Jacksonovi:
Σε αυτό το βιβλίο δίνονται στον αναγνώστη πολλές πληροφορίες (υπερβολικά πολλές) και ολίγον τι μπερδεμένες, ενώ η πλοκή είναι σχετικά αργή.
Να κάνω μια παρατήρηση κάπου εδώ για την πρωταγωνίστρια η οποία και ο κόσμος να γκρεμιζόταν αυτή θα σκεφτόταν "Γιατί δεν με φιλάει ο Λούκας;" Αυτο στη αρχή με εκνέυριζε και μου φαινόταν ξεκάρφωτο.
συν και ότι υπό την επήρεια ισχυρών σοκ το μυαλό ψάχνει έναν καλό και δυνατό αντιπερισπασμό.Η ιστορία μου φάνηκε πολύ ενδιαφέρουσα, με κράτησε από την αρχή έως το τέλος.
Η απόδειξη; Είναι η δεύτερη φορά που το διαβάζω και πάω βουρ για το δεύτερο βιβλίο της σειράς.
Then the love interest made his entrance, and the tension was so engaging because Helen wanted to kill him, she was going to weird places in her dreams and I was like YES here for it.
Then she started to fall in love with Lucas and that's where my enjoyment completely dropped off.
There was some very uncomfortable conversations about virginity where Lucas was all like 'it's fine if you're not one' yet everything he said afterwards suggested otherwise.
If I wasn't already like 300 pages through this thing I probably would've DNF'd there.
BO-RING.This is easily on Parr with Twilight, Fallen and the Selection.
Utter tripe.
It was a good idea but the execution was painful and uninspiring.I wanted to grab Helen and shake her by the shoulders screaming "GO BACK TO NURSERY YOU SPOILT, PETULANT LITTLE CHILD!" She was so immature it was infuriating.
Now let me go puke...The characters, all of them, were very flat.
They feel as though they've been given only just enough to be classified as a character rather then a name on some paper, but no more.
This makes the story even more flat and shallow and DULL.
Die Story ist super aber irgendwie hat die Perspektive mich oft verwirrt. Hat auch eine Zeit gedauert bis ich reingekommen bin. Werde bald aber auch weiterlesen.
No?Then she looks exactly like Helen of Troy, but she thinks she’s ugly.
Every page I read I was rolling my eyes like I never did in my entire life.The first time Helen and Lucas meet they try to kill each other, but then after only 50 pages they already are so in love that they want to marry.
And they met like one week before they have this great idea.I actually thought I was reading about 3 year-olds that play at being wife and husband.
No.Fuck no!I think rating it 1 star is being extremely generous in this case.What the hell was this?I was warned several times that this book wasn't good, but, like always, I don't listen.I guess I like torture way too much.Oh, boy.
(hide spoiler)] Saying that this book has a plot is like saying that The Last Airbender wasn't bad!!Here's what I got so far:Helen lives in Nantucket.
Because it is so cute when guys make you fear for your life for their enjoyment.In other words, Lucas attitude toward Helen is like this:"I know we can't be together, but I'm still going to order you around.
Very very good. I was unsure when I started it, having received a proof to read before publication, but a few chapters in and I was hooked! Angelini's use of Greek mythology adds a new spin to the relatively saturated 'Supernatural Romance' Genre that has suddenly exploded in teenage fiction. Helen and Lucas' cursed love story is touching and worth the read.

Questo libro è stato  orribile  e per rendere l'idea mi sono recata velocemente sul sito dei sinonimi e contrari.
E non voglio continuare perché il mio repertorio di aggettivi negativi risulta essere abbastanza limitato dopo che il mio cervello ha subito una bella spremuta per sopportare le ultime pagine di questo libro.
Pagine che ho saltato senza sentirmi minimamente in colpa!La trovata mitologica poteva essere straordinaria, ma questa autrice non è riuscita nel suo intento.
Tu non sei altro che il risultato di una penna un po'scarica o di una tastiera malridotta, come la mia.
ecco che tutto si trasforma in amore a seconda vista.
I'm getting this out of the library first, because I'm iffy about it. It seems like it could be interesting or just more angsty teen romance fair which I've honestly had enough of. But I'm holding out because it involves the Trojan War. Please dear god Josephine, don't do to greek mythology what Stephenie Meyer did to vampires. I love Homer, so if this is just the Hot Topic/CW Network/Gossip Girl/Twilight version of the Iliad, I will honestly slit my stuffed animal's throat.
Josephine Angelini has created an exciting and dangerous world full of demigods and forbidden love that you can't get enough of.Are you tired of reading about Vampires, Wolves, Fairies, Witches and Angels?
Soon, Helen is sucked into the world of Demigods and mysterious powers that have been with her all her life.
Helen's attraction to Lucas is becoming more and more visible to everyone, and too soon, they fall in love.
For Lucas is in the House of Thebes and Helen is not, if they are together....The gods will fall and declare war on them all.Sounds pretty amazing right?
It's available in most countries.Overall, Starcrossed is a book that everyone should read and experience.
