After about page 200 I realised this was like eating Turkish Delight morning noon and night and my spiritual teeth were beginning to dissolve under a tide of sickliness which didn't ever let up. All these characters are so unbearably cute, even the less-nice ones. If post-independent India was crossed with Bambi, it would be Vikram Seth's endless gurgling prose. So I stopped reading and drove several three inch nails into my head, and I've been all right since then.
This is a magnificent saga, which left me breathless and awaiting the next word, set in India at the beginning of the fifties."Suitable Boy" by Vikram Seth's “epic love story set in India.
I get the same pleasure reading this book as when I’m eating lobster or tasting a superb Burgundy wine or whatever sublime other pleasures that we have in life…My…I must confess that I had never heard of Seth before and I wouldn’t if it hadn’t been for Goodreads.
I love this book.
It’s got the same melding of personal lives seen in amidst great national events.
Instead of the romance of Natasha and Pierre, it’s that of Lata and her three suitors.
Instead of the war with France, we have the post-Independence and post-Partition politics of a nation searching for an identity.
And it works in tandem with several great stories of love and passion, and what these mean, both at the level of family, romance, and nation.
Word has it that Seth is working on a follow up (not sure if it’s a sequel as such) to be called “A Suitable Girl”.
I was angry because I am afraid that her reasoning resonated with the coward in everyone, especially south asian girls who have had to, or will have to, at least discuss the concept of arranged marriage at some point in their lives.Ironically, her mother later suffered a number of qualms herself about whether Haresh would be the right boy for her daughter.
His was the real arranged marriage, in the true sense of the word, and yet you cannot dislike him or his wife Savita because they are both so lovable people, that you just know that they were destined to be together, no matter how they got together.For those of you who haven’t read it, do.
I finished Vikram Seth’s tome A Suitable Boy this Sunday morning while enjoying my coffee and a white chocolate, coconut Christmas cookie that my daughter had baked just last night.
All right, all right, I confess it was actually two white chocolate, coconut Christmas cookies.
The story immerses you into the daily details of these families’ lives and indeed of India at that time and place.
It is unfortunate, I believe that the editors did not cut some of that detail away, allowing the story to blossom in its own right as my daughter did with the sugar in her cookie recipe.
A Suitable Boy describes a year in the life of the fledgling Indian democracy, indirectly told through the experiences of four connected families and a litany of supporting characters, who, due to the diversity of their occupations and social positions, are able to explore various facets – political, legal, social, cultural, religious, artistic – of the India of this period, and the clash of its opposing cultural forces: traditional versus modern values, religion versus secularism, Hinduism versus Islam, Eastern versus Western culture, and democracy versus serfdom, to name a few.
Remek-delo Vikrama Seta! MUST READ... Odličan prevod Brane Radević... Još jedna indijska priča koja je postala savremeni klasik...
I was never entirely sure who belonged to what family in this book, but it never really bothered me. I mean, after we switched back to a different group of characters, I was able to reconstruct who they were related to fairly easily, but I never could hold the genealogies in my mind.Note: The rest of this review has been withdrawn due to the changes in Goodreads policy and enforcement. You can read why I came to this decision here.In the meantime, you can read the entire review at Smorgasbook
I call it a soap opera, because fundamentally, the plot is a family drama, revolving around the wooers of its principal character, Lata Mehra.
As one reviewer notes, "he writes with the omniscience and authority of a large, orderly committee of experts on Indian politics, law, medicine, crowd psychology, urban and rural social customs, dress, cuisine, horticulture, funerary rites, cricket and even the technicalities of shoe manufacture."A Suitable Boy is undoubtedly one of the biggest achievements of world literature and will remain one of my all-time favourites.
Vikram Seth's A Suitable Boy is one of the best books I've ever read in my entire life.
It's a long book.
To my chagrin I had completed it before my flight, and when it finished I didn't want the book to be over, I wanted to go back and re-read it from the beginning.
It is one of the best books about life in India I've ever read, it is the anti-Kite Runner book.
Writing this up I think I should go get it and read it again.
Like most of my favorite books I gave it away a long time ago.
It is a patch work story of many characters' lives; by the end of the story, you see how they all intersect.
The story is set in post-independence India and explores a number of social/political issues of the time (i.e. land reform, muslim-hindu relations, women's rights, arranged marriage, the caste system), but the political commentary doesn't hit you over the head, and the characters really drive the story.
Despite my enthusiastic recommendations, I've had a hard time finding anyone to read this book!
However I found it to be a total page turner.
Through the stories of some of the major families of Brahmpur, we observe and participate in not only the day to day activities of individuals but the workings of government, developing industry--some quite primitive, the existence of caste--though outlawed, religious hatred, and the search for love and marriage.
It is a very full year.At the center is Lata, searching for that "suitable" boy, the man she will marry.That quest is not finalized until the end of the novel and is worth reading about but so much more is happening.
The suitors include ambitious Haresh, who reads pessimistic Hardy; the poet and Seth stand-in Amit Chatterji, who (along with Lata herself) reads Austen; and the Muslim Kabir, who is in no way suitable and does not read novels (but he does act in Shakespeare's Twelfth Night).The other major plotline involves the growing up of Lata's brother-in-law Maan Kapoor, who has an affair with musical courtesan Saeeda Bai. These two families, the Mehras and the Kapoors, twine together throughout the book, along with the Chatterjis and the Muslim Khans.
Compared to Barbara Kingsolver and Yung Chang, Vikram Seth needed twice as much pages to tell similar stories as these two authors.So yes, it was a long-winded journey: a story of India after Partition, that was told through the eyes of four extended families with each member profiled to the last red spot of paan on the teeth.
I often wanted to just run away, and I did, since it is the end of the financial year (February) and what is normally a quiet relaxed month turned out to be one of the craziest in recent history.
But I cannot leave out one of the most outstanding moments in the book, for me: it was the passing of a mother and it had me crying like losing my own.
Have to remove this one.
I know I liked it, but at over 1300 pages, and occupying almost 2 inches of shelf space, it must go.I have to admit I remember little about the novel, except enjoying the story very much when I read it.
(Given that, it could be argued that a 3 rating would make more sense?

Boy, was that a mistake.But then it so happened that I wasn't able to finish this book when I had anticipated (which was about a month ago), so it wound up getting to be close to Thanksgiving.
A Suitable Boy is another whopper of a book, but even the parts I didn't necessarily understand still made more sense to me than most parts of Infinite Jest.
I started out reading this alongside Freedom at Midnight, hoping that book would help me understand some of the politics I didn't know much about going into it.
By the time I got to the end, I wanted to throw this book across the room, but by then I was exhausted.
It’s the world’s 17th longest novel.
The thing is, if I read a whole book only to have the heroine choose the easy, boring choice, that is not a story.
I stuck with this story for 1500 pages because I wanted to see how the girl would end up with the perfect but tragically unsuitable boy.
(hide spoiler)]I was all set to give this book four stars.
That cost the book two more stars.
It’s only a story.
Moreover the novel successfully includes all aspects of Indian life and nationality from the caste system to religious differences between Hindus and Muslims to the impact of changes in business and government life on the four families at the center of the novel.
The thematic development of the clash between Hindu and Muslim cultures is particularly well portrayed with the impact of historical events on the national level mirrored by dramatic events among the main families whose lives fill the plot and subplots of the novel.
The way i could picture so many of my aunts acting like Rupa Mehra was hilarious....!That is one fictional Character i could literally relate someone to :) I don't want to get into too much details and spoil a mammoth book for anyone of you who might be interested in giving away at least a month of your reading time...But i really wish people would read such books to give them not just a great reading experience but a lifetime experience about how life has always been complicated, not just for us but our parents and theirs...
Well, by the you finish reading one of the longest English novels ever written and the longest English Novel written by an Indian and that Indian is Vikram Seth, you're kind of used to the story, the characters, the way their life goes on.
So, when you turn the last page of something that has sprained your wrists for days, you certainly feel the sense of accomplishment which matches in effort if not in pain, to delivering a baby but at the same time you're depressed you'd NEVER be able to read this book again for the first time, that its time with you in that unique one to one bond, though cherished, will never be intimate in the same sense as before.Having expressed my feelings, thus, I will now proceed to review one of my favourite author's biggest masterpiece.
Personally, I think the best here would be a tie between the love stories and Vikram Seth's wicked, humorous turn of phrase and the witty conversations between his characters which made me smile so many times.Even the heftiness of this book did not escape the author's humor.
I read 'Cymbeline' in just that way on the train here; and I never would have otherwise.'"Vikram Seth may not be aversed to the idea of his book being torn up for easy reading like what his character Amit did to his 'Shakespeares'.
Reading this book felt like lifting the Wimbledon trophy, the most coveted prize in tennis.
This book too is something like that.
I am still amazed.The strength of the book lies in the simplicity of the narration and in the humble decoration of the characters.
Many a times, I was yelling into a book, almost talking to the characters when I knew that I was being ridiculous (or was I?).
I am not sad that book got over, but I am glad that I read this one.
dopo più di sei mesi di lettura inizio la 19a e ultima parte ☺🙁
I’ve been daunted by this 3” of book for years but finally I can now look the paper doorstep in the eye/spine and smile.
Time there certainly didn’t drag!The British have been gone 3 or 4 years at the outset of the book.
Lata is very special and will always have a place in my heart.Reading this I was reminded of that deliciously camp Bollywood movie, Bride and Prejudice (?)loosely based on Miss Austen’s novel.
The story lines in A Suitable Boy are strong, the characters brilliantly drawn, worthy of Jane with even a nod at times to an Indian version of Charlie Dickens.
Please read this book if you haven’t done so already.
I finally read it and now at 37 years old and 13 years plus married life, I thoroughly empathize with the protagonist, Lata.
Maybe because she speaks for the large mass of girls who would rather their lives be a smooth ride of mediocrity than the brilliance of quicksilver.
Lata disturbed me and I know it’s going to take some time to get back to my mediocrely safe choices.
But all in all it was a brilliant read and Vikrem Seth is a graceful writer.
He is too elaborative at times and hopefully forgive me for skipping a few pages on parliamentary politics.
Its worth your time.
تاريخ القراءة الأصلي : ٢٠١٤تشعر وكأنك تقرأ تولستوي وتشارلز ديكنز ولكن بلسان وروح هندية. هذه الرواية الضخمة (١٤٠٠ صفحة) تسجل كل ما حصل في المجتمع الهندي والدولة الهندية منذ الاستقلال، عمل يجمع بين أطياف أدبية عديدة ولا يمل أبدا رغم ضخامته..
(sigh) (hide spoiler)] However, I thoroughly enjoyed this book, cover-to-cover and would love to see a sequel, A Suitable Girl, all about Varun and his quest for love!This book is an excellent companion to the other wonderful (chunkster-size)India-reading that I have done the last couple of years: A Fine Balance and The Toss of a Lemon.
Seth does a wonderful job with his characters - the manipulative, but loveable Mrs. Mehra to the liberated Malati to the arrogant, insecure Arun to the lovely Lata to the ambitious Haresh.Speaking of the search for the "Suitable Boy", the chase was a fun one.
I have an in-built horror of books that stray on longer than 300 pages. Anything longer and I always find the story sagging somewhere towards the middle and losing me by the end. Except with A Suitable Boy. It's over 1000 (tightly written) pages and I only wish it could have gone on and on. This sprawling saga takes you all over India in the 50s, into the lives of a dozen or so interconnected characters. And yet Seth masterfully manages to keep each story bubbling on the stove with delicious results!
I had been waiting for over two years to read this book and I only managed to find a copy now.
Vikram Seth is par excellence in the way that he sketches his characters- each character is deep, layered and volatile in his/her unique way.
He manages, in his 1400 pages, to capture every single human emotion possible.
In that respect, VS wins hands down.
Waiting earnestly for A Suitable Girl!
I was a bit disappointed though, with Lata's ultimate choice of husband.
I was campaigning desperately for A to win her heart but I guess for the kind of person she is, H is probably the right choice!
A Suitable boy is a very sutiable book for both boys & girls..
When I borrowed this book from the library I found it surprisingly huge and scary, everyone who saw me carrying it was equally astounded.
'Buy me before good sense insists,You’ll strain your purse and sprain your wrists.'he is not right but not also wrong..
though I didn spend money on it and though heavy & huge - I could manage without straining my wrists..
But you know what - this book is collecter's item so buy it and save it..
sutiable for your library.To read more:http://storywala.blogspot.in/2011/12/...
