This is one of my favourite of my beloved Billabong books, as it was my Nanna;s, and I've read and reread it so many times since I was a child that I've practically memorised it.In post-war London, Anglo-French Cecilia ("Tommy") lives a life of soul-crushing dull servitude and emotional abuse, being a kind of unpaid servant and governess to her stepfamily.
When I was a kid, Tommy's flight from her family home was almost unbearably exciting, and I have a loving place in my heart for this book always.
Tommy (otherwise known as Cecilia) and her brother Bob spend half the book fleeing horrid relatives, and the rest of the book relegated to the background as events happen around them on an Australian farm.Maybe because I've started on book 7 of a series, but I was rather confused by the whole thing.
The second half seemed to focus on a bunch of characters who I had no connection or interest in and who seemed very two dimensional.
I read the first half in a few days, and it took me about 3 weeks to finish the rest because I was that apathetic towards the story/characters/everything.
