Incredibly detailed insight into things of God and Satan.I strongly recommend this for a deeper understanding of the world we live in. Our current events demonstrate that we are closer to the end times prophesied centuries ago.
Regardless of your theological and denominational stance, this book serves as a foundational understanding of who Satan is, his desire for Christians and our part in his plan to make him famous at any cost. There are many sections and quotes to wrestle with and ask the thoughts of others. There are a few grammatical errors, but that is to be expected of a free version of a book. The format and all other things worked well on Kindle. Definitely a book everyone should read. Ill leave the theological agreements and disagreements for another time.
A Dispensational View of SatanDr. Chafer takes a dispensational view of Satan in this book and even though I am not a dispensationalist I enjoyed the book. Therefore whatever your eschatology I believe you will enjoy the book. I really liked the section on how Satan works today.Yours in Christ,Alex
Solid, entertaining piece. Although most of the best writing was from "previous" works. Jesus exorcising the evil spirits was always one of my favorites. It does do a decent job of the "end of days" scenario.
A bad one. Author very freely points out an obvious things without bringing any proof of his statements. "This is Bible. This verse says that and that and only that, cause I says so" kinda book. Avoid.
Do not let the title fool you. This book was excellent by going through the Bible and in depth to expose this individual as to how he functions while quoting scripture throughout. I would highly recommend this to any Bible student.
Interesting
