(view spoiler)[I love Tahereh Mafi, but it is clear that world-building and action-writing are not her strong suits.
What happens to Juliette after she killed Anderson?
In Destroy me Warner said: "That this girl would know exactly how to shatter me." Then he went on and said in Unravel Me: "You destroy me." In addition to that, Juliette, also in Unravel Me, related to the term when thinking about Warner: "I want to unravel him." So....is it delusional to hope for the seemingly impossible?["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>
It was all so underwhelming and poorly executed.-I'm not even Team Adam or Team Warner but the way Mafi twisted things and made 180 character changes so that Warner was the perfect love interest and Adam was the abusive, jealous, bitter psycho ex was beyond infuriating.
It was sick.-This whole book was manipulative in how it twisted things to make Warner seem like a good guy and the perfect match for Juliette whilst making Adam come across as a douche who never understood Juliette.
After reading this book, I have one thousand and one thoughts running inside, trying to escape out of my head. And I think it took a while before I processed everything that I have just absorbed. And they were plenty. So many. As a forewarn though Ignite Me was different from what I expected it to be but in some ways all the same. I’m still reeling everything in to be quite honest. But here I go; I’m going to spill my guts right about now:The  Shatter Me  series is for me not really a dystopia n
It’s not about the result but it was how she got there.I really loved reading Juliette’s journey; from this timid little girl who only had pen and paper as an emotional outlet to being this brave girl leading a rebellion.
He was so raw in here, so exposed, that I get to glimpse the real Adam amidst this big brouhaha between him, Juliette and Warner.Is that my cue to tackle my most favorite part of this book?
To anyone who doubt if Warner loves Juliette, Ms. Mafi even wrote it in my copy:*winks*Pre-Reading Comment #1:This is going to be a long wait.
Unravel Me#2.5 "Fracture Me"#3 Ignite Me#4 Restore Me O.M.G.I can't even.I've lost the ability to can.This book didn't go anywhere that I thought it would, but wow, did I like it!
I devoured this book in a day, and now I don't know what to feel because the series is over.I don't want to say too much, for fear of spoiling something.
Wow. I don't think I've read a YA book that surprised me this much in terms of the love triangle.
That's all I'm saying.*le sigh* (hide spoiler)]Basically, all the mad love to Tahereh Mafi.This is an epic conclusion.All I have left for this review is:["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>
I think this reread really just solidified how much I fucking love this book for Juliette's character growth.
It makes me want to cry every time I reread the scene that she talks about, "I was locked up in an asylum for 264 days because I made myself a prisoner to my own thoughts and suffering, but I never even contemplated that my own strength could have broken me out of there with my bare hands." It's so sad, but so revolutionary for Juliette's character development.
”Words, I think, are such unpredictable creatures.No gun, no sword, no army or king will ever be more powerful than a sentence. Swords may cut and kill, but words will stab and stay, burying themselves in our bones to become corpses we carry into the future, all the time digging and failing to rip their skeletons from our flesh.”Do you still remember my review of “Unravel me”? Yes?! Okay! Then let me tell you something: “Ignite me” was so much better than the last book!!!! I don’t know how Taher
Gosh, that book left me reeling and laughing and gasping and crying and swooning and drooling and I had absolutely no idea what to do with all those feels!!!I bit my nails, I was desperate, I was hopeful, I wanted to smash the book against a wall - which would have been pretty bad because I read it on my e-reader and I’m quite certain it wouldn’t have survived this special kind of treatment *lol* - I wanted to shake some of the characters, wanted to yell at them, I wanted to laugh with them, I wanted to punch some sense into their heads.
I am so sad this series has ended. BUT IT WAS SO GOOOOODODODODODODOODODODODOD. It's impossible to write anything without spoilers, so please just read the series if you haven't.I want a certain character to have a spin off series... just sayin.
Every single word he spoke was beautiful and REALLY, every time he was in the pages of this book I was grinning like an idiot, because that is the effect Aaron Warner Anderson has in me.
Warner have just made it to the TOP 3 of my book boyfriends, and I have to tell you, is really hard to earn a spot there (yeah I know I'm crazy).I also really loved the whole development in Juliette's character.
I want an epilogue and I just want more Warner please.OH GOD I'm so in love with this book.
Not only we're getting a Vampire Academy movie in February 2014 but we'll get to read about King Warner slaying all the competition around Juliette.
I want to be free to express my thoughts since I can't explain how much my life is ruined by fictional character to my family or friends.
Readers didn't like Juliette in Shatter Me and Unravel Me but I was one of those who loved her manic ass right from the start.
People were demanding another Warner novella while I was the only one in there asking for more Kenji.
[Updated 11/28] [Updated 11/03] So I was able to see a few snippets from The Mafi Mafia's website (Tahereh gave them an 8-chaptered excerpt of Ignite Me) and here are the current snippets we have so far!
And it is beautiful!!!Another reminder: In one of Tahereh's interview, she said that there will be a conclusion on who she ends up with...and we will find that out on the beginning portion of the third book~ So what I'm trying to say is: Juliette will be having sexy times with only one of these boys in the third book and I am hoping that it is Warner <3 [Updated 6/29]Hey guys!
(more of a 3.5) While I was satisfied with the ending of this book, I still had a few issues with it. I'll talk more about it in my monthly wrap up video. :)
‘‘Ignite, my love. Ignite.’’ Shatter Me is the kind of series I wish had more books. A trilogy is not enough. I want more.More Juliette& Warner& Adam& Kenji I had been shackled, a prisoner of my own mind.  But finally, finally, I have learned to break free. I’m truly delightfully surprised at how I couldn’t stop reading this emotion-filled book, because the plot is actually very poorly developed and there is sincerely maybe three or four events happening in the whole book. But, if y
I’m grateful for the character development that Juliette has, because I was not entirely sure, having read the first and second when I was not reviewing books yet and so did not feel like being so severe and annalistic, if I’d enjoy this protagonist, today, in 2014.
I’m okay with characterization that is different from one book to another, because of situations that happened and changed a person, but Adam always felt like an angel and the sweet and perfect boyfriend to me.
That is one of the reasons why book two is the one I loved least of the series.
Sooo, I just saw the release date for this.
February 2014, huh?
8/8/2013And the title's Ignite Me...Please excuse me while I go stab myself.---That's me waiting for the book.That's me regarding this stupid shit you people call "Team Warner."That's me if Juliette doesn't end up with Adam and/or ends up with Warner instead.
English - EspañolWith Omega Point destroyed, Juliette does not know if the rebels, her friends, and even Adam, are alive.
The same one that saved her life.I LOVE this series and I know I will love the new series Restore Me too because Warner is in it too.---Con Omega Point destruida, Juliette no sabe si los rebeldes, sus amigos, e incluso Adam, están vivos.
Pero eso no hará que deje de tratar de acabar con El Reestablecimiento de una vez por todas.
La misma que le salvó la vida.
Yo ADORO este serie y se que amaré también a la nueva serie Restore Me porque Warner esta en ella.
“Words, I think, are such unpredictable creatures. No gun, no sword, no army or king will ever be more powerful than a sentence. Swords may cut and kill, but words will stab and stay, burying themselves in our bones to become corpses we carry into the future, all the time digging and falling to rip their skeletons from our flesh.”  Story ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐Stories end when you’re shot in the heart. It’s over. There’s no story left to be told. Except the person is not dead. And now she finally found her rage,
Never stop at the first book, because the third one is the absolute best - a wonderful way to write a finale.
She was crying so much, but then she finally had the character development we all needed (and wanted) from her.
He’s caring, full of love and makes my heart jump every time he smiles.
Relationships ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️Oh, my heart ♥️Finally, finally I get what I craved from the moment I started the first book.
I got a happy, strong female character with a love interest that knows that she’s in no need of a hero.
Re-read (01/03/2018): This book is everything, I LOVE it so much !. No doubt, as I said before, I think it's the best book of the series, is the most solid and is where most of the important things happen. I loved the Julliette & Warner scenes , I can't help it, they're my babies and I'm so proud of them and of theirs growth as characters, but above all I'm so happy to have read about Kenji again, he's one of the best characters I've ever read, it's so fun and such a great friend. I can't wa
I loved the Julliette & Warner scenes , I can't help it, they're my babies and I'm so proud of them and of theirs growth as characters, but above all I'm so happy to have read about Kenji again, he's one of the best characters I've ever read, it's so fun and such a great friend.
:(.Speaking about the serie in general, I think it's one of those that I'll remember forever, it has made me so happy and has made me feel in love with the characters, it is a book I would recommend without doubt ever .
[3.5]What a ride, jesus. I'm so glad there's more coming out now. I need more of Aaron and Juliette. More growth. More character development. I want to see them conquer the world, now that they're a powerful couple and all. This was definitely my favourite book in the series. ---------------------------Initial thoughts:This had better include countless amount of heart-wrenching and hot scenes between Juliette and fuckin Aaron, because I do not care for the plot. Seriously, why is his name so yum though?!
I swear Juliette has developed so much as a character, it is inspiring to see what a marvelous person she has become. Simply beautiful.Full review to come.
what in the wattpad hell did i just fcking readthis is a CALL OUT to everyone that loves these books.
she didn't like this: "you think you know me just because you've read my journal- you stupid, prying, privacy-stealing asshole"in short: regardless of whether he ate mad pussy near the end of this book, he's kind of a fucking psychopath.
oh yeah and stop stalking women, thank you.--------------------------------then we have the lovely adam:i'll keep this short.
and making adam into some incel asshole was just cheap.
Re-read 5/25/18: Okay again 2014 chels was a lil dramatic down there bc I’m gonna be honest with you guys- I couldn’t care less about the actual plot of these books.
But the SEXUAL TENSION?!
Have mercy.
Warner is the human embodiment of the 🤤 emoji.
“Lift your hips for me, love”?
I AM DEAD.
Plot: 2/5.
Warner: 11/10 would recommendOriginal review 2/9/14: Hands down the most perfectly satisfying book I have ever read.
This story, these characters, will all remain so very near and dear to my heart for years to come.
I want to hug this book and never let it go.
I think it was all written out very clearly why there was supposedly love between Adam and Juliette.
It wasn't really love, but you have to read the book to find out!
I'm glad him and Juliette are best friends, we all need someone like that.
"Your suite looks just like mine." Kenji frowns.
Or a yellow suit-""Because we're not the freaking Power Rangers," Winston says, rolling his eyes.
Was he a friend of yours?""You know what," he says, "just stop.
And even though there isn't a lot of action in the book, the parts that were, I loved!
Not as good and energising as the first time but it still was fun. Also, why is Kenji so underrated? Rereading this series made me realise that he’s THE best thing in it.
I was continually impressed throughout the series with the effort the author put in to make the story about Juliette's journey (instead of just the guys) and to address any issues in her relationship with Warner so it wasn't problematic.
Juliette's character growth is pretty impressive.
The story keeps moving at a quick pace, yet there are still a lot of great insights and deeper moments.The end was a little abrupt, but I had so much fun with the rest of the book that I didn't even care.
I love the writing, pacing, characters, everything...
“Ignite, my love. Ignite.”  I feel so ashamed for giving this book just three stars. In fact, I've been thinking that this series has the potentials to climb up to the top of this genre easily, at least for me. It has the abilities to push those characters further and the relationship is great even if it's overly sweet but acceptable for me, but sadly the ending ruined it all. After two books, Juliette and Warner are my only focus, they're so outstanding I can't think less of them. Besides, the
After two books, Juliette and Warner are my only focus, they're so outstanding I can't think less of them.
Warner is a charming character, he pushes and motivates the whole book towards the ending pretty well, and when it finally comes, this skyscraper helplessly falls down.
So this is what I felt toward the ending ...
Despite the disappointing ending, this series is worth reading and I enjoyed almost every part of it.
The gargantuan development of the girl who has nothing except herself and power.Highly recommend !(view spoiler)[For Adam, I wanna kick your ass so badly.
THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS I think I read chapter 55, like 100 times.
Warner and Juliette finally got together (It's about time).
I was extremely disappointed with the ending of this book as I think Tahereh got lazy in the last 20 chapters and just rushed everything!
I was also disappointed that Kenji didn't get with either Sonya and Sara (as I said the ending was brief).
Juliette certainly took her sweet time deciding if she loved Warner or not and that certainly annoyed me but thank God we got there in the end.
I had been shackled, a prisoner in my own mind.But finally, finally, I have learned to break free.”“I promise myself then, in that moment, that I will hold him forever, just like this, until all the pain and torture and suffering is gone, until he's given a chance to live the kind of life where no one can wound him this deeply ever again.”Reread <3Bloody hell, I love "Ignite Me" so freaking much!!
SO GOOD.
I absolutely loved this book. I talk about all its wonderful glorious plot points in my booktalk here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgjx2... =)
