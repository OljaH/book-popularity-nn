“Unfortunately it's an incontrovertible fact that sound common sense flies out of the window as soon as love comes in through the door.”Even better than Ruby Red. Because of Xemerius(why didn't she introduce him in the first book?)and because of that hilarious ball where Gwyneth/Gwendolyn (which is her actual name in the German and original version of this book) is getting incredibly drunk and does...things she definitely wouldn't do when sober.I rarely have this much fun when reading a book but this series brought tears to my eyes several times from laughing too hard.Find more of my books on Instagram
“True love knows no constrains, no locks or bars. Past every obstacle it makes its way.It spreads its wings to soar toward the stars, No earthly power will make it stop or stay.”  I literally fly through this book in 1 day, and I have no regrets!

There is really nothing ''WOW'' about these books so I really don't know why I like this series so much.
Saphire Blue was much more better than Ruby Red. Gwen was really funny and sweet in this book.
I love how she tries to help Gwen with all that's going on.
Everything happened so fast and it kinda feels like insta-love, and I really wish that Gwen could less swoon over Gideon, but it's still not a big problem.
The biggest flaw in this series is Charlotte though, can she somehow vanish already?(I loved drunk Gwen btw, she was so cute)
Oh my gosh, do I really have to wait for OCTOBER for this book to be translated into English????
That brings me to my main problem with Gideon....His awful, awful declaration of love.
He's barely known this girl a few days and he's "declaring his love"...which, apparently, translates to "when I see you, all I want to do is makeout so obviously I'm head over heels." There is no real conception of what love is in this book.
I'm looking forward to the next book being translated, and I will read it.
Ruby Red, the first book, brought to us an adventure that included time-traveling, secrets, carriages, evil barons, and a little bit of romance.
His relationship with Gwen was just starting to be kindled at the end of book 1, and almost as quickly as it began, it progressed to the point where they were acting like they've been together forever.
All I have to say, is that the romance in this book is very confusing because I can't tell when Gwen and Gideon are secretly thinking up evil ways to kill each other, or secretly thinking up romantic ways to surprise each other.
The heroine, Gwen, could have been a decent character had it not been for the ghastly romance and the vile love interest (the douche dick Gideon).
He treated her like utter shit and the dumb bitch let him, she would be mad and upset when he acted like bastard but as soon as she saw him again she would forgive and forget and let him treat her like shit again.
Gideon didn't trust Gwen once in that week 3.
It was fucking ridiculous.The story line could have been mildly interesting, if Gwen hadn't been so focused on her pathetic love life.
I've had a few days to compose my thoughts, and because it's late I will be posting the full review tomorrow. As for now... My Thoughts, Compiled as Neatly and Efficiently as Possible at 11 PM on Finals Week: - This book was not as good as Ruby Red in my opinion, even though I still enjoyed it. Really hoping Emerald Green is better.- I! Love! Gideon! He is my baby!!!- I'm still in love with the time travel. (view spoiler)[The party scene was just so accurate for that time period. I especially lo
He is my baby!!!- I'm still in love with the time travel.
(view spoiler)[The party scene was just so accurate for that time period.
(hide spoiler)]- (view spoiler)[The most interesting parts of the time travel were the scenes in which Gwyneth got to meet and talk to a younger, alive version of her grandfather.
POSSIBLE SPOILER: I'm really glad we didn't have to see much of Charlotte, Aunt Glenda, or Lady Arista in this book and how we got to see more of Gwyneth's mother and siblings.- And drunk Gwyneth is and will always be my favourite Gwyneth.
Sapphire Blue picks up right after Ruby Red. it’s been a few days since Gwen Shephard discovered that she, not her cousin Charlotte, inherited the “time-travel gene” that manifests in one girl of each generation in their family.
She has no idea what he’s talking about and is highly distraught by the accusation.Gideon also gets in a sword-fight (not shown) in the eighteenth century and shows up splattered with someone else’s blood.Sex: A lot more innuendo than was in book one.
In present-day London, Gwen is also followed about by a little gargoyle-demon calling himself Xemerius.
Really enjoyed the book but, I have so many questions! Just posted my full book discussion: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaZuuI... ! So excited for book 3!
Arghh.I like this series, I do. WIth a few complaints. My biggest complaint is that it is a series, instead of a single book. Not much happened it the first and frankly not a whole lot happens in the second. I got SO (in all caps!) tired of no one telling Gwen anything. Eventually some things are revealed. Ish. But you shouldn't have to read 2 books in the series to start getting answers. Yes, I'll read the next. As long as my complaints are duly noted.
I. Need.
Now.We get more time travels than in the first book, that one was definitely the introductory book to this world...Also finally we discover the meaning of something that has been mentioned in the prophecy, which I believe it was pretty obvious since the first time it was mentioned but ...
We will get some answers and more questions too.
I suspect that many explanations are being saved for the third and last part.
Overall, the plot is quite simple.
This instalment is funny, entertaining and very well written as the first part.I'm in love with this series!!
Wie toll 😍Nachdem ich Band 1 ja innerhalb von wenigen Stunden gelesen hatte, habe ich natürlich kurz darauf mit Band 2 begonnen.Für diesen habe ich ein wenig länger gebraucht, aber das liegt hauptsächlich daran, dass ich viel zu tun hatte.Die Handlung schreitet hier genauso schnell voran und seit Beginn von Rubinrot bis zum Ende von Saphirblau vergeht gerade mal eine Woche.Deswegen haben die Charaktere kaum Zeit sich weiter zu entwickeln, aber die Protagonstin Gwendolyn passt sich erstaunlich schnell an, auch wenn ihr natürlich hin und wieder Fehler unterlaufen 😉.Mit Gideon habe ich hin und wieder meine Probleme.
4,5
:O *forever crying* This book was just as great as the first one!!!
So funny!!!
At the end though..well he does love her.
I want to read it,but at the same time i just don't want this to end!!
I love these books so much and i read them so fast,and the problem is, i can't re-read them for the first time.
:D Oh and Xemerius is so funny and useful!!
So,i loved this book.
i just need Gideon to get his shit together and treat Gwen a bit better,clear things up,trust her..and show her he loves her!!
Es que cada vez me gusta más esta trilogía.En Saphirblau,la segunda parte de la trilogía Rubí,nos encontramos con una historia que comienza siendo algo predecible y pasa a ser absolutamente entretenida.
Ya me encariñé tanto con todos que se me va a hacer difícil dejarlos ir.Gwen A pesar de que es una protagonista bastante entretenida debo decir que en este libro se volvió algo… “tonta” ¿Qué quiero decir con esto?” Que...¿Por qué antes de precipitarse sacando conclusiones no averigua por fuentes confiables lo que de verdad pasa?
So maybe I was a bit less engrossed in the overall plot with Sapphire Blue than I was with Ruby Red. It's a good thing there was a lot of relationship drama in that book as it kept me focused on the story :) I loved the addition of the gargoyle, Xemerius, Gwen's new companion that helps her spy on people and cheat at tests :P And Gideon is still swoon worthy, even though I can't say that I agreed with all of his actions in this book.The ending was heartbreaking.
I still love these books - I'm so happy! Maybe part of it is nostalgia, but I haven't been this entertained in a while. I read quite a bit of this on my rides to and from university and I must've been quite the sight to the people on the train. I constantly had to force myself not to laugh out loud, but couldn't stop myself from grinning every other page. Gwen's thoughts and comments made my day. The sass! Rereading this, it turns out, has been one of my smarter decisions.
3.5 starsThis series is so fun to read! It's fast-paced and humorous, with witty characters and the cutest romance. I'm having a blast reading it! I would write something more articulate, but you know, book three is already waiting for me...
Wow. Ich hätte ja nie gedacht, dass das möglich war, aber Saphirblau ist definitiv noch besser als Rubinrot.
Ich finde Kerstin Gier hat es auch einfach klasse gelöst, traurige oder gar dramatische Szenen durch Xemerius' lustige Kommentare zu entschärfen.
Ich weiß gar nicht, ob sie auch ein Buch schreiben könnte, das kein bisschen lustig ist...
Ich bezweifle es, aber das ist ja auch kein Makel, sondern eher ein Talent.Was die Gideon-Gwen-Sache angeht (Sie hat ja schon eine gewisse Vorliebe für Namen mit G...
Es gibt ja noch genug Dinge, die WIRKLICH überraschend sind.Mein einziger Kritikpunkt wäre, dass man Rubinrot und Saphirblau eigentlich auch als ein Buch hätte veröffentlichen können.
Whoa that escalated quickly... I can't wait to see the end of it.
Χαλαρο, ξενοιαστο, περιπετειωδες και καλογραμμενο. Μα πάνω απο ολα εχει τόση φρεσκάδα, τόσες ατάκες και ευχάριστο χιουμορ που όσες φορές και να το διαβάσω πάντα καταφέρνει να μου φτιάξει την διάθεση.
STILL SUPER FUN
This book just set up for a great conclusion. I can already tell! Now if the person who has the third book of this series at my library will finally return it I could finish the series! I love time travel books because of the added element of history. I generally am not too big into historical fiction so when it is added to fantasy I actually eat it up. This series has great blend of fantasy, history, and romance. I seriously cannot wait for book 3 from my library!
Ciddi bir aksiyon eksikliği olduğu gerçeği inkar edilemez ama ben karakterleri ve yazarın mizahını çok seviyorum*-*
As usually I finished this book quite long ago (the next day that I finished Ruby Red book and movie) buuut i forgot to put it on my read shelf and because i wanted to finish a review first but i had mixed thoughts (and events) since as soon i finished Sapphire Blue I watched the movie which was so good (im going to admit it now: i liked it better than the book) Gwendolyn as always was so fun to read I absolutely love her character and with the companion of Xemerius: hell yes.
The time traveling scenarios are so pretty and wonderful.
"The illimitable, silent, never-resting thing called Time, rolling, rushing on, swift, silent, like an all-embracing ocean-tide, on which we and all the Universe swim like exhalations, like apparitions which are and then are not: this is forever very literally a miracle; a thing to strike us dumb - for we have no word to speak about it."- Thomas Carlye Warning: May contain mild spoilers, taking into account that this is the second book in the series.Gwyneth Sheppard has recently found out that she has inherited her family's time-travel gene instead of her crazy bitch of a cousin, Charlotte.
Wel pakte de bijzondere wereld van Gwendolyn me weer en heb ik genoten van de onderdompeling in de wereld.Ik vind Gideon een ongelooflijke eikel, nog steeds.
Ik vind het wel tof hoe Gwendolyn daar mee omgaat, als mensen in haar bijzijn over haar praten in de derde persoon bijvoorbeeld, alsof ze er niet is en niets te zeggen heeft, dat ze dan in de derde persoon iets over zichzelf zegt, dat sarcasme mag ik wel.En de sfeer van alle kleding en kapsels..
En eigenlijk ben ik wel benieuwd naar Gideon hoor dan ;)Leuk trouwens de puzzel op het einde!Behalve dat het verhaal lekker vlot is en goed wegleest, vind ik ook dat de boeken mooi zijn.
*Actually 4.5 stars*This book was so much better than the first one in my opinion. I found myself way more gripped from beginning to end. I think a huge part of it is to do with Xemerius, as his character is funny as hell. I did find Gwen to be a bit annoying sometimes though. I also seem to find myself more intrigued by what happens in the prologue and epilogue of these books (they are told from a different character's POV). I'm actually quite looking forward to Emerald Green now... didnt think I'd say that after Ruby Red!
This was better than I remember Ruby Red, if I hadn't seen my review. I read it so long ago. And as I said in that review, this is better read back to back, so I am on to book 3 now.
Gideon's bipolarness just freaks me out.
Sice se její sestřenice učila všechno možné, aby mohla cestovat časem a pouze čekala, až se u ní konečně projeví časocestovací gen, její tetička s babičkou a vlastně velká část rodiny je mírně šílená a každý má nějaké to tajemství, ale pro Gwendolyn vskutku normál.
Gwendolyn totiž zjistila, že to ona má gen, který jí umožňuje cestovat časem.
Pokud jste četli Rudou jako rubín, a alespoň trochu se vám líbila, rozhodně neváhejte sáhnout po Modré, protože opravdu stojí za to.
A pokud jste ani jednu knihu ještě nečetli a zní vám to alespoň trochu zajímavě… tak na co ještě čekáte?
