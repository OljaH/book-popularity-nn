The best self help book I have read so far and it will stay close to my heart forever. The thoughts on the word "I" , the concept of MIND and the comparison of the seed to mind were awesome. A must read.
MUST READ for anyone who is committed to creating the fullest life possible.
One of my favorite books
One of good book, i have ever read. Its a very small book that anyone can finish this book in one reading. But its content or theme is so high that it would touch your heart and prompt you to think again upon the way of life you are living, help you track down the reason of failure in your life.I would suggest its a good book to read and change the way of life we are living to achieve success.
The Message of a MasterI am so glad that I found this book in ebook form, because I kept losing my printed copy. I really love this book as the message is simple but all so powerful.
Remarkable little book. Read it slowly.
If I knew it was a "Law of Attraction" sort of book I wouldn't have ordered it at the first place. Didn't get any new ideas from it...
This book is so tiny, and yet absolutely profound. If you follow the wisdom inside I have no doubt success will be the result. I practically want to get some of the best quotes tattooed on my arm. Perhaps I won't go to such extremes, but that's how I feel about this book. It contains a few of the essential lessons of Think and Grow Rich, but in a much shorter format. Power-pack-super-combo: Think and Grow Rich, Message of a Master, Slight Edge. Read and apply all three, and your life will be amazing.
