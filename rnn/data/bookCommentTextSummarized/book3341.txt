The best or all I could do and I did, is that I bought the book right away.
The best feeling a reader can go through is read excerpts from the life of the person you admire, feel inspired from and I was so delighted if not overly astonished to learn about Tolstoy's life, given he's been my literary inspiration since childhood.
There is only so many people who might like to read this diary of Tolstoy others can suffice it to know that if you are about to read this book, do not expect to come out with immensely heartrending experience.
It is just about the regular life of a man who is not the Tolstoy the world knows.
I love the book. Children shouldn't read it.
Profound, as you'd expect, and personal of course reminding you to live your life now and with great reverence.
