I have to say that now I understand the great influence Ernst Mayr I have read on Diamond's publications, specially the role that geography plays on speciation.In my opinion, this is a fascinating book that will lead you from the biogeographically, molecular and embryological evidence there is on evolution and explain the basic concepts you will need to understand how and why evolution takes place.
I am guessing most of the science text-books borrowed from this masterpiece to convey these ideas effectively.
But that also means that when someone goes back and reads the original it sounds too text-book-ey, in presentation and content.
Not many ideas here which you wouldn't have been exposed to, but still a valuable book to turn to if you are coming to the field for the first time, or after a long break.
However, it is a well presented, coherent summation of the most important scientific discovery of the age.
Worth a read.
Worth assigning to any class of young students.
Gimana ga bagus, om Mayr nyeritain tentang evolusi sehalus itu dan kebantu banget sama terjemahannya KPG yang bagus banget.KPG TERBAEQ 👏Oh iyah, jadi sebenernya buku ini menurut om Jared Diamond (di bagian Pengantar) emang ditulis untuk orang-orang dari kalangan umum -yang ga mempelajari biologi secara khusus-.Manfaatnya apa buku ini?
Yah bisa tahu evolusi secara garis besar, kalo udah tahu yah barulah boleh nghina-hina Darwin kalo dirasa teorinya agak kurang cocok di hati dan jiwa yah pemirsa.Yang paling aku suka dari buku ini, penjelasan yang detail tapi tetap menyenangkan.
The evolution description in this book is comprehensive, with various perspectives from philosophical point of view to biological or religious, but sometimes I had the impression of fast-forward or lack of depth.
I, a non-specialized reader, hopelessly stumbled toward the middle of the book in unnecessary biological terms and enumerations of species names.On the bright side, through this book I discovered fascinating subjects, like evolutionary psychology, abiogenesis or comparative embryology.Overall, I like the motivation of the book and its representation of this wonderful subject, the evolution, but I honestly recommend other books to begin with.
Gould calls that something else "punctuated equilibrium", and "The Structure of Evolutionary Theory" is an extended argument for his theory and its implications.One of the implications is that evolution occurs at multiple conceptual levels.
But when Mayr discusses peripatric speciation - an idea of Mayr's that contributed directly to the theory of punctuated equilibrium - he brings up many of the same concerns Gould addresses, but labels them as difficult problems for further investigation.I came away from "What Evolution Is" feeling that Mayr and Gould were actually on the same page, but Mayr - for reasons of his own - didn't want to admit it.
biyolojiyle ve evrimle ilgili ön bilgi olmadan okunduğunda anlaşılması zor diye düşünüyorum o yüzden not for beginners, insan evrimi kısmı dışında
This is a wonderfully easy-to-read book that explains evolution in good accessible English and contrasts the theory of evolution with other theories and philosophies such as creationism. My daughter had borrowed it as background reading for her Biology undergraduate course but I felt that it was geared to intelligent laymen too. Due to hectic time pressures, I only had a few hours. However, I managed to skim through the book in only a couple of hours, as it was laid out in such a manner one could easily pinpoint the most important points.
Darwin's theories featured a change in thinking from organism types to populations of individuals with variation of genetic material - Population Thinking.Earlier theories of evolution included:1.
This can lead to convergence where unrelated organisms develop similar characteristics to utilize a particular niche.Chapter 8 - The Units of Diversity: SpeciesWhile species were earlier based upon taxonomic differences, the Biological Species Concept (BSC) is now generally adhered to: "Species are groups of interbreeding natural populations that are reproductively isolated from other such groups".
اين كتاب با زبان نسبتا ساده به توضيح نظريه ي تكامل داروين و موافقان و مخالفان بعدي پرداخته است. ظهور جهان زنده، پيدايش و انقراض تبارها، منشا حيوانات و گياهان پيچيده تر براساس يافته هاي فسيلي و مطالعات ملكولي و سلولي توضيح داده شده است. در فصل اخر كتاب نيز تكامل انسان از دودمان شامپانزه و پيدايش هومو و تكامل اخلاقي انسان پرداخته شده است.
I greatly enjoyed this book, and learned many new things, about biology in general and the process of evolution in particular. It was a bit more technical than I was expecting in terms of scientific vocabulary, but in the Kindle version I was able to simply highlight words I didn't know, and definitions would pop up. It's great to be able to learn new words so quickly and easily!
What is interesting about this science book is that while it provides a good explanation of evolution as a scientific theory, there is also a good defending against Creationism and intelligent design.See: What Evolution Is by Mayr
Kitabın bir kısmında geçen teknik terimler yüzünden zorlansam da ufkum açıldı. Özellikle seçilimi ve insanın evrimini çok iyi anlatıyor. Bence lise düzeyi biyoloji bilgisi olan herkesin okuması gerekli, özellikle de "evrim çürütülmüş bir teoridir" diyen dangalak siyasetçiler. Kitaptan bir alıntı: "Evrim göz önünde tutulmadıkça biyolojide hiçbir şey bir anlam ifade etmez."
So if you're someone who's somewhat curious about evolution, I'd suggest starting with something a little lighter (Your Body: The Fish that Evolved, for instance).
He also starts the book with a beautiful discussion on the evidence of evolution (one of my favourite chapters of all, honestly.
This allows you, the reader, to come to the conclusion yourself that today's explanations make the most sense, rather than being passively fed a lot of information.To be fair though, some chapters get a little too technical, even for me.
Ernst Mayr is one of the key figures in the development of the synthetic theory of evolution, by which Mendelian genetics was wed to Darwinian natural selection.
Later on, I was given the opportunity to co-edit a volume (The Dynamics of Evolution) on the implications of Stephen Jay Gould's and Niles Eldredge's "punctuated equilibrium" theory in the natural and social sciences.
To my astonishment, he agreed; further, I was overjoyed that major figures such as Gould, Eldredge, Kenneth Boulding, and Steven Stanley, among others, also agreed to write chapters.
Mayr's chapter was one of the very strongest in this volume, even as he was in his 80s.
The other day I got dragooned into seeing that bland new Star Wars movie.
I was most entertained though by the ridiculously stupid trailer for the new "Planet of the Apes" movie which ends with Woody Harrelson (you can tease out the irony yourself) actually saying the words "Planet of the Apes".I found the irony chilling, as I settled back into my plush theatre chair, opposable thumbs mandating popcorn kernel after popcorn kernel into my short, flat moral-bearing jaw, that Mayr's book was precisely about that we DO have a Planet of the Apes and that anyone who thinks differently is just, as Mayr bluntly puts it: batshit fucking insane (pg.
By comparing them to the basic principles (which he states very clearly) of evolution and the processes through which it occurs, he refutes misconceptions, and thus develops for the reader a clear understanding of what evolution is NOT.
The book begins, then, with an overview of the history of evolutionary science, examining carefully how each of the historical debates regarding evolution were resolved in favor of the view we have now.
I have read no other 'intro to evolution' books to compare it to, but it seems like he did a good job, and so if you are interested in this (and you should be) this is worth considering.
As one of the leading evolutionary biologists of the 20th century, Ernst Mayr's work was integral in the modern evolutionary synthesis between natural selection and genetics.
No one would mistake Mayr for a novelist, but his prose is clear and straightforward, especially for someone whose English is their second language.
My only criticism would be the infrequent use of common names for taxons above species.
For example, Mayr makes frequent reference to corvids when discussing tool-use and the evolution of humans.
However, that is a minor criticism and I would strongly recommend this book to anyone curious about the world around them.
Ernst Mayr is a reknown evolutionary biologist who has been writing since(at least) the late fifties.
2nd, the book starts by stating explicitly that it is not 'defending' biological evolution via natural selection.
In Appendix A, he states: "The claims of creationists have been refuted so frequently and so thoroughly that there is no need to cover this subject once more."Mayr's book takes the latest data and information concerning biological evolution and 'fills in the blanks' so to speak.
In short, this book is of interest for anyone who would want to take an honest look at both biological evolution and their ignorance about it.
Here at last is a great book explaining the essential facts about evolutionary biology to everyone -novices and afficionados alike.
There's a lot of introductory books on the topic, but this one stands out for at least two reasons.First, Ernst Mayr is not taking side when dealing with arguable issues.
There's a lot to learn, that's what we are here for.Besides, the plan is well structured and organised: proofs that evolution is a fact, how it works and accounts for biodiversity and, finally, a closing chapter about human evolution.
I found it to be a written at a somewhat odd level – I think that it is ideally suited for well-educated, highly motivated readers who are seriously delving into evolution for the first time, or for readers who have had undergraduate-level biology and evolution courses and want a refresher.
The book moves too quickly over basic concepts to be accessible to a more general reader, but the lacks the mathematical aspects of evolution that would interest someone entering the field professionally.
Though the book was clearly-written, I did notice a number of factual errors that suggest a lack of proofreading by a biologist.
The author claims to be writing a book about "what evolution is" for the common man.
First, the book is not really about evolution.
However, much of his text has little to do with evolution itself, and the author completely ignores applications of evolution to non-biological topics.
Second, this book is definitely not written for the "common man." I'm no dummy (I have a PhD) but even I quickly got lost in the terminology he was throwing around.
While intended for the non-biologist, this book still makes some pretty strong demands of the reader.
It's worth sticking with though as it gives the best description of the mechanisms and processes of evolution that I've read.In particular I've always wondered about the process of speciation and while this book doesn't provide all the answers (largely because we haven't discovered them all yet) it does a good job of defining the various ways speciation occurs.
And it does it in fairly clear, easy to follow language.
Written by a highly notable figure, the book is an authoritative tome of information of what evolution is, and more importantly, what it isn't. But I must say that it would have been a good read at the time it appeared. Matter is much better organized in today's popular science books and the flow is good enough to keep most people going.If you want an intro to Evolution, there are many more books available today than was at the time this came out. If you want a text with historical significance, this may be one.
This is a great book, even if you are religious or not, this book will certainly answer any queries you have on evolution.why i chose to read this- my father recommended this book to me because of my fascination with natural history and biology.who would i recomend this to- anyone who is wondering how evolution works.i loved this book it is probably the best book i have read since the origin of species.
Well, it was certainly an introduction to evolution, but unless you have a solid science (biology) background, or love using a dictionary/Wikipedia, I wouldn't bother starting it just yet. It really does seem to be written for some one that is more than passively familiar with biological terms and processes. If you want an introduction for the layperson, try something else. If you are currently taking or remember your biology courses, give it a go.
Evolution is fact not theory and Mayr supports this statement with facts. I'm not a scientist and I found some of the scientific language overwhelming but I made myself get through it and was surprised at how much I do understand. He filled in a lot of gaps for me especially about the evolution of species. I'm glad I read it.
It's not that it's not informative, but it's rather too technical to be an introductory book, which, with a title like that is what you expect it to be. You actually do have to already have a background in biology (or biological anthropology) to really understand what he's talking about, which makes it exactly the wrong book to give to a layperson.
Exactly what you would expect to be written by a leading expert in his field at the age of 97: hugely informative, largely adamant, and slightly rambling.
tema evolusi adalah tema yang menjadi akar dalam biologi. buku ini berhasil membuat sedikit rangkuman tentang evolusi sebagai point of view namun buku yang tidak dimaksudkan untuk menjawab banyak keraguan tentang evolusi.
Ernst Mayr es posiblemente el biólogo evolutivo más importante desde Darwin. Este es un libro tan básico para comprender la evolución como "El origen de las especies", y un buen punto de partida para no tener que empezar en 1859 y, sobre todo, no quedarse allí.
