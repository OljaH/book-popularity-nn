ILLUMINAE is the classic tale of Girl Meets Boy:Girl Loses Boy:And Parents:And Planet: and Ends Up on a Crippled Spaceship: with a Mad Computer:and a Deadly Virus Outbreak:in the Middle of an Interstellar War:It's without a doubt the coolest book I've ever written. I'm pretty sure you've never read a book like it.So . . . enjoy!
THIS WAS THE COOLEST!
The unique format is what really makes this book stand out, but even without that aspect, it's still a fantastic read!
Going into it I didn't know a whole lot, but I'd only heard praise, and after reading it, I GET IT.
So many awesome elements and surprises--I had no idea where the story would end up, but I loved getting there.
Awesome world, great characters, intense moments.
It was funny and creepy, and again, just plain COOL.One of my faves of the year!
Definitely recommended, especially if you're looking for something different or you love a good sci-fi story!
ILLUMINAE WAS SUCH A SPECTACULAR RIDE. FANTASTICALLY UNIQUE STORY TELLING TECHNIQUE, CAPTIVATING STORY. LOVED IT! Here's my full discussion/review https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zgtey...
HOLY CRAP.
WOW. THIS WAS GOOD. It took me quite some time to really get into the story, but after around the 200 page mark I was hooked!
Maybe it was because the lovers at the centre of the novel were boring caricatures of teenagers.Maybe it was because of the detailed scientific descriptions and diagrams of spaceships:Maybe it was the tiresome and dull "Unipedia" pages that made me feel like I was studying for an essay:But mostly I think it was because of the teens in love.
Her entire characterization is built around badass girl power and I almost want to love that fact, but she never felt like a person.
She felt like a cardboard cutout delivering snarky toughness.The conversations between her and Ezra feel forced, like someone reading off a script:It's the kind of book that looks way better from far away.Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube
There is no way in hell that I could possibly describe what's going through my head right now. I don't think I'll be functional for a little while.I'll get back to you on this, but just know it blew me away. Far, far away.Review coming closer to August, MWAHAHAHH! Wait, October now? Sucks for you that publication was pushed back :P)
DNF at 30%This book is written in epistolary format, and it has the honor of being the most annoying book I've read this year.
Some people love that stuff.
Star Trek (I loved Enterprise and I don't care who knows it).
After what seems like 10000000 pages of interviews, all of a sudden we're at war (still no idea where we are, what year it is, how we got here, etc.) and then young people are getting conscripted for the military.
I got a headache instead.By 30%, I still have no idea what the fuck is going on.
RE-READ REVIEW:Yes yes I am officially 100% Illuminae trash and I COULD CRY BECAUSE I LOVE THIS BOOK SO MUCH.
So like it was reading a completely new book almost????• And I'm quite the auditory learning, so I absorbed a LOT more this time.
So that's awkward teenage love for you.• YES the book is entirely told in pictures, files, instant-message conversations, and a few chapters of description from, like, a security camera sort of thing.• And it's also told from the POV of an evil computer named AIDEN who is wonderful.
not to be ungrateful but I feel like I've just went through 9 different emotions within the last two minutes and at any given moment now, I'm going to explode and become an entire fucking solar system fdjh;jgskanyway, I'm sorry this review is a mess but since I can't even write bad poetry in an attempt to get my feelings outside of myself and until the universe sends me my next favorite person so I can unload all my emotional baggage on them... this hellsite will have to do “The universe owes yo
● ah yes, the arrogant mass-murdering psychopathic part time tortured poet giant calculator… how I’ve missed it● so arrogant in fact that he would give julius caesar a run for his money● you know julius caesar…the same dude who was kidnapped by the cicilian pirates and when they demanded a ransom of 620 kgs of silver, he got really angry because he thought he was worth more than that and actually made them raise it to 1550 kg??● u-huh● so hey, @scientists who are actively trying to make computers learn human behavior and generally scream in existential horror… this is why you need to Stop● I mean as appealing as it is to have an artificial intelligence software in the form of like, a really smooth orb for company, or even… saaay uploading your consciousness into a computer…that shit is too dangerous to mess with (refer to the ‘mass-murdering’ part)● now back to fiction, AIDAN is the kind of character you love to hate but also…hate that you…lowkey…love them● you know they’re Bad, and even if sometimes that little light escapes the darkness of their heart…they catch it again● meaning: god is he messed up● but you know what?
UPDATED THOUGHTS:Ok, so I've calmed down a bit and am feeling better about this.
Amazing how it could feel so hindering yet unique at the same time.
I'm glad I put this one off until I already had Gemina on hand, as I didn't realize these were more of companion novels than a linear series, as time really can't be trusted in these books.
Also, I now understand the emotions previous readers feel while seeing the new readers status updates along the way...
My words aren't working right now, but this started out as one book and then turned into another?
I'll think on this and try to write a real review with words and thoughts and things.
I picked said book up, took of the plastic over because I thought, "I can't read it with this on!" Then...
And look at the inside, well one page at least...Obviously you can read on the book that Kady and Ezra were living on a little planet with their parents.
Kady had broken up with Ezra and then all hell breaks loose on the planet!
Kady ends up saving Ezra, but they end up on different ships when they take off.
Kady is on the Hypatia and Ezra is on the Alexander.
I love Kady and Ezra!
i don't want to give too much away, so all you need to know is that this is primarily an actiony romance that takes place in outer space told through a series of found footage, emails, schematics, internal memos, and other reports, including some pages that look like this:
and here's the kicker - i do not like outer space books or romance, and i am wary of ephemera-based books, having been burned too many times before.
Mind boggled.
1: due to confusion.
2: it was damn good!This’ll take a while for me to process.
For now what I can say though as much as I loved the format, it made a little difficult for me to completely connect with it.
It would through me off at times as there wasn’t your typically well-known flow and I had to try and grasp the story each time.
I mean, I loved it since everything was so fascinating, but some things I just couldn’t grasp.
——————————————Pre-reading thoughts.I’m hella late to the party, but I’m expecting greatness.
And greatness had better be what I get.
My video review is up! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cs109...I have not been having much luck with YA books lately.My main problem with this book was that the format and the nature of the story caused me to feel detached from the characters and everything that happened to them. I never felt anything for them, so I was very unaffected by any "bad things" that happened. I feel like the plot was good, and the format was really cool, but the combination of the two just didn't work for me.
Holy shit. That was a wild ride.

Actual final rating: 4.5/5 starsBuddy (re)read with my girls:Jenn, Luna, Em (Kazzexual), Sana, and Mayflower "AM I NOT MERCIFUL?" This book was epic. Epic, I tell you!I'm a huge sci-fi fan. As I've mentioned a hundred times over, that stuff is my shit. (Which is why I have filled this review with completely irrelevant Doctor Who gifs, and only Doctor Who gifs. You're welcome.)I think you know the drill by now: I warn the reader of the sheer multitude of gifs and fangirling coming their way, stat
You're welcome.)I think you know the drill by now: I warn the reader of the sheer multitude of gifs and fangirling coming their way, state more than once that "this is not a review, but more of a mess of my thoughts", et cetera, et cetera.Illuminae had everything I loved: brilliant storytelling, lovable characters, and a chilling, captivating plot.
(hide spoiler)]Now, you may be thinking, "Ryan, if you loved this book so much, why'd you give it 4 stars instead of 5?" Here comes the not-so-fangirly part of the review: There was an extreme lack of world building, and I almost lost interest towards the middle.
I absolutely love the way it was written and all the cool page designs and the way that the world is established is very immersive and you feel like you're a hacker reading into life on this spaceship.
I love how the authors were able to write such a variety of different scenes and voices, for example how the Artificial Intelligence unit of the spaceship having a completely unique and separate tone than that of the sassy main character.
The only reason I took off a half star from this book is that because of the POV, I felt like you lost a little bit of the character descriptions and explanation of the plot.
Wow is all I can really say
This book was so unexpectedly addictive.This story starts off in a much further progressed world, in both years and technology, than ours, on a hidden and secluded planet far, far away.
It is action packed, and the format is so easy to read, that these 600 pages will feel like 300 pages.
His points of view made this book for me, and once we got to those points of view, I couldn't stop turning the pages.
I also feel like this book would be pretty universally liked, if you don't mind the format.

my heart.is going to. E X P L O D E. Since my brain is still a cacophony of 1's and 0's and !!!!!!'s and fUCK's, I thought I'd walk you through it in gif form:And that about sums up what Illuminae will do to you. Are you ready? Probably not. It's a motherfucking zombie apocalypse in outer space.Do it anyway.Even if the wikipedia-like texts and dossier narrative style turns you off. Especially if they do, because believe me you, I was in that same boat as you and now my mind's been blown in two.

This is the story of a teenage girl named Kady, and a boy named Ezra who, along with the rest of their planet, are forced to flee their home on Kerenza IV when a mega corporation comes along and tries to get their hands on what is being illegally mined on the tiny little planet.
Okay, so that was a really shitty summary BUT IT DOESN'T MATTER BECAUSE THE CHARACTERS AND THE ATMOSPHERE YOU GET FROM THIS BOOK ARE WHAT MATTERS.I was unsure if I'd like Kady, I mean, the teenager who is SOMEHOW a super genius hacker???
wow wow wow wow wow wow wow. My brain can't keep up with my emotions!There are very few times when I actually wish I could give a book more than 5 stars. VERY FEW. And yet, this is one of those times. I am blown away. Amazing, amazing, amazing, amazing, amazing. Review to come.
I actually ended up liking this a lot more than I expected!
It’s true what they say.
You don’t need to be a fan of science fiction to love this book.
I, for one, am not and I could reread the hell out of this book.
The rumours are true.
This is as much a romance as it is a science fiction story.
Kady and Ezra’s flirting is so eye-roll-worthy, but a kind of eye-roll-worthy that makes you smile at the same time.
So is this a perfect book?
I could complain about other little elements, like unimportant files that could have been cut, but I don’t really want to right now.
Epic motherfucker of a book, excuse the language.
Click at your own risk.**(view spoiler)[The Romance:While individually I enjoy Kady & Ezra as characters, I am not much a fan of their romance.
Well I didn't.I don't know what this thing is with Young Adult books where we can't have a story without a damn romance.
Kady & Ezra aren't the worst couple I've ever read, I'm just exhausted with this genre forcing a romance in every single book.I think I would've invested more if Kady & Erza were brother & sister.
Even if you're not a fan of Young Adult fiction, this story isn't plagued by many of the flaws of that genre.
“Am I not merciful?”  ^^ This was a real HOLLY-MOTHER-NO-FUCKING-WAY moment. <3AIDAN, Winifred, Byron, James and Dorian were great!! Unfortunately, i DID NOT like Kady, she was a little too overdone. Ezra on the other hand was hilarious, but too cheesy for my taste. "IF I BREATH, I WOULD SIGH. I WOULD SCREAM, I WOULD CRY.___《RESTART COMPLETE》_____________I___________________AM__________AIDAN AIDAN AIDAN AIDAN AIDAN AIDAN AIDAN AIDAN AIDAN AIDAN AIDAN AIDAN AIDAN AIDAN AIDAN AIDAN AIDAN AIDAN

Très sexy." < Lmao!This romance crap between Kady and Ezra isn't working for me.
