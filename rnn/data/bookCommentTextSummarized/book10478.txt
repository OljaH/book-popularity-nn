“We all do what we can, and it has to be good enough, and if it isn't good enough, it has to do.”  Who else but Christopher Walken could play Johnny Smith in the highly praised David Cronenberg film?Johnny Smith is a rookie teacher with $8 in his pocket, just enough money to take his best girl Sarah, also a new teacher, to the local county fair. Sarah is coming off a couple of recent relationships that were exciting with aggressive, unpredictable men. Johnny is a step in a new direction, maybe a
The Wheel of Fortune guy running a crude version of the roulette wheel tempts Johnny over to try his luck with his last few remaining dollars.
When Johnny comes out of his coma, he has the ability/curse of being able to touch someone or something owned by that person (psychometry) and see pieces of their future.
It is only logical of course that if Johnny knows about a fire before it happens that he must have been involved in setting that fire.
While working in the book business, I have always puzzled over why Stephen King was read by so many people.
A new audio version with James Franco narrating and doing a pretty good job of it got me motivated, and I’m pleased to find that it mostly lives up to my memory of it.The elephant in the room on this one is that even though it was published in 1979 the Stillson plot is about a populist demagogue who manages to rise in politics despite being a crazy and corrupt piece of shit just because he has talent for making rubes think that he’s a maverick who tells it like it is even as they willfully ignore the obvious warning signs.
He wakes up a pauper in material terms, but endowed with the full-fledged version of his latent childhood gift.And thus begins the career of John Smith, the clairvoyant.As he moves from discovery to horrific discovery, the amount of darkness he unearths in human souls pushes John further and further down into a sort of spiritual abyss.
Yes, Greg Stillson is the boogeyman in this story.One must pay homage to Stephen King's gift of seeing into the future.
At the time the novel was written, people would have laughed at the idea that a secular democracy would elect a blackguard like Stillson into office.
Fantastic book.
Great film too starring Christopher Walken.🐯👍Loved the scene in the film when Christopher Walken is talking to Herbert Lom, his doctor.He asks him, being that he is a Jew, if he could go back in time and get close to Adolf Hitler...Would he kill him?Herbert Lom replies that he is a doctor and his job is to save lives...And finished by saying he would kill the son of a bitch!
Imagine if you could go back in time like, 11:22:63 his other book, and take out a despot, or foil an assassination.
Ripples in the pond of time.
.بها الكثير و الكثير من الشخصيات الثانوية ولكن يظل جون سميث المدرس البسيط مثالا للرجل العادي عندما تلقى عليه مسئولية غير عادية ..و قد أقتبس كينج شخصيته من الواقع لرجل كانت الشرطة تستعين به بسبب قدراته سالفة الذكر ..لغة كينج كانت اكثر سلاسة وشاعرية..لم اتعاطف كثيرا مع علاقة جوني وسارة ولكني تعاطفت مع مبدأ جوني و مثاليته و تضحياته..حتى صار بطل ذو معدن أصيل "We all do what we can and it has to be good enough..nothing is ever lost.."johnny choose good for others ..and finally knew that everything thing happens for a reason ..A novel about faith.
And what's the deal with this Greg Stillson character that's swiftly becoming a heavy hitter in the political realm?Sometime in early 2013, I resolved to read some of the Stephen King books I missed during my binge around the turn of the century.
Things to ponder...The Dead Zone is a good early Stephen King book and probably the best book I've ever read that was turned into a movie starring Christopher Walken.
In fact, it was more entertaining than the ultimate climax of the text, which dealt with the question of "if you could stop Hitler before he rose to power would ya?" John felt an inordinate amount of pressure from his gift, which I thought serviced this book well.
Rather than making him a superhero, his gift became more a question of mankind and morality.
Just another lovely King book that makes him the legendary author he is.
I chose The Dead Zone for my next King novel simply because of the recently released audiobook.
I have always enjoyed the books I have read by King but I have never felt as invested in a main character until The Dead Zone.
If you like King, Franco, the existing adaptations of this book, or just want to see what all the buzz is about (politically speaking), I strongly recommend checking out The Dead Zone!Note: If interested, you can listen to an online interview clip with James Franco about the audiobook experience HERE.My favorite quote:“Ninety-five percent of people who walk the earth are simply inert.
Amazing really enjoyed 💕'
For Goodreads: 2.5 stars.I think I dislike this book a little more every time I read it.
But I think what I dislike the most about this book is all the political mumbo jumbo.
I simply don't give a shit about politics, and this book is full of it.
This is purely subjective, of course, because if you dig your stories dredged in government, battered in legislature, and fried in policy then this book is definitely for you.
It's funny, because the book feels more like a collection of interconnected short stories than it does a novel.Notes on the film and television adaptations: I love Christopher Walken.
THE DEAD ZONE was my very first Stephen King book, and I would like to thank David Cronenberg, Christopher Walken, and one of my high school best friends- Natalie Kowalski- for introducing me to the world of John Smith, and in turn the world of Stephen King.[image error]After watching and falling for the character John Smith- in the 1983 movie THE DEAD ZONE, I decided to search out the book that it was based on.
As is often the case in King's books, the characters have supernatural powers, but something about John Smith's abilities stand out high above those of Charlie McGee's pyrokinesis.
King focuses less on shady people who want to use this power for evil, and more on John Smith himself and what his own conscience is telling him to do.I can definitely see why David Cronenberg, who brought us the amazing works Scanners and The Fly, would want to adapt The Dead Zone.
King injects his own brand of subtle humor into the characters and dialogue throughout, and there's also some time for a bit of drama.
The rest of the book walks through events where this psychic ability becomes useful in a number of ways, ultimately leading up to a thrilling, larger-than-life climax that puts ole Johnny in a precarious situation with huge stakes, really unbelievable stakes, but, man, when you get there, who even cares anymore?
This guys is magical and he’s saving the world!Having multiple plots building on each other was a little awkward at times.
It was cool to read a King book and get myself all mixed up in a wild story, but I also came away thinking about life just a smidge.
Other times it’s dead zones and saving people.
Este es justamente el Stephen King que no me gusta...Quienes me conocen saben que soy fan de este autor, muchos de sus libros son increíbles, lamentablemente este no es el caso.
Sólo déjenme explicarles un poco de mi problema con este en particular.Para empezar leemos bien claro en la sinopsis que se trata de un tipo que comienza a tener unas especies de visiones acerca del futuro luego de salir de un coma y que pronto descubre que debe asesinar a alguien que provocará una especie de fin de mundo.Stephen king quiso hacer de esta historia una especie de crónica, profundizando en los detalles para mi superfluos de la historia, quiero decir, cae en el coma en un tercio del libro, su primera vision fue mas adelante de la mitad y cuando comienza la acción para matar al señor que va a destruir el mundo es en las ultimas 100 páginas...
Συγκλονιστικό βιβλίο. Ο Τζόνι Σμιθ ξυπνά από ένα βαθύ κώμα που κράτησε τέσσερα και κάτι έτη, έχοντας αποκτήσει τη δύναμη να βλέπει το μέλλον. Από τα καλύτερα του King. Ά... και απίστευτα μελαγχολικό (χωρίς να είμαι σίγουρος καθώς τελευταία συγκινούμαι και με κατάλογο από τα πράκτικερ).
His new stuff wraps the art of storytelling neatly into a bundle, with gripping characterization and plots that leave you hanging on for more.The Dead Zone sort of explores Stephen King’s development as a skilled author, in this book he shows that his characters are becoming more deeply fleshed out than previous works but in my opinion he loses his way with the story a little, concentrating more on one aspect of the story and dropping the ball in others.I did enjoy the story of Jonny Smith, he is a character that is easy to invest everything in but my problem lay with the bad guys.
Oscura, fascinante y enigmática. Conocía esta historia por su serie pero me ha sorprendido bastante. Con aire irreverente King en estado puro y con un final de infarto.
What comes from knowing things? Nothing. What is the purpose of knowing the future? So you can change it? But wouldn't what you knew about the future and the change you were going to bring to the future, be the way it was supposed to be anyways? Just think about it...I think in the case of Johnny Smith and  The Dead Zone , I would have to say what happened to Johnny and the events surrounding him, happened for a reason. This is not a horror novel, in my opinion. This is more of a sci-fi novel do
This is more of a sci-fi novel done in King-style.
About halfway through the novel, I felt like something else was going on, and it turns out I was quite wrong: (view spoiler)[ I thought the killings were Johnny while he was in the dead zone, because he seemed to not really know what was happening to him while he was there.
(hide spoiler)] I'm glad King made me think one way, and had it turn out to be something else.
. I'm really happy King penned this novel, and didn't take it to certain lengths I thought it might go.
Espectacular libro de King. Es uno de mis favoritos de él. Muy humano, conmovedor, profundo y, aunque sea un poco pesado en algunas partes, adictivo. En La zona muerta, King toca temas como la religión, el desencuentro, la soledad y el poder de forma madura y concisa. Una obra maestra.
2.5 Stars: Not bad, not great, but still entertaining.“Tears streamed down her face, sliding over the smooth hard surface of the nightpack like rain on chrome.” (Blade Runner, anyone?)This audiobook is excellent, and I would definitely recommend it to someone who is a fan of James Franco (he reads it with such vervre!
The end reminded me of the last 1/3-ish of 11/22/63 — which happens to be one of my all time favorite Stephen King books to date, even though the ending is a tad weak / deus ex machina-y.
Dobri, stari King.
All we need to do is watch carefully should he drag an innocent in front to save his bacon - it will happen.I pretty much overdosed on this book, it worked so well as an audio whilst I curled up on the settee with my sudoku book.A month of Halloween 2015 reads:#1: 3* Nobody True by James Herbert: fraudio#2: TR The Horror Stories of Robert E.

Johnny is left with a horrifying decision of whether to stop this future outcome or hope it doesn’t happen… Thoughts and Reflections – First of all, this book asks one of the most ultimate questions – would you have killed Hitler if you knew ahead of time that he would become an evil despot killing millions?
The idea of going back to a root of something and fixing the issue before it has a chance to manifest into something deadly is a strong theme that King addresses again in later novels like 11/22/63 (one of my personal favorites).Not having read this book in a long time, I had completely forgotten how under-rated I think it is.
4.5 stars. Johnny has become one of my favourite King characters. This book was so moving, I absolutely loved it.
¡Último libro del 2015!  “Johnny deseó estar muerto. Si su talento era un don divino, Dios era un lunático peligroso al que había que apagarle el carro.”  La Zona Muerta es mi tercer libro de Stephen King y aún me sigue asombrando su habilidad de mezclar religión, política, hechos paranormales y psicología en una única trama... ¡y hacer que funcione! Su talento si que es un don divino. La historia resulta un poco predecible, casi desde el comienzo ya puedes adivinar como va a terminar todo: no h
La Zona Muerta es mi tercer libro de Stephen King y aún me sigue asombrando su habilidad de mezclar religión, política, hechos paranormales y psicología en una única trama...
GR clasifica esto como terror y thriller, pero nada más alejado de la realidad.
De hecho, como dato curioso, todos los villanos de este libro siempre son descritos por los demás personajes como las personas más encantadoras, mientras que destacan que el protagonista tiene "un aire de maldad" y "ojos de psicópata".
In The Dead Zone he conjures up Greg Stillson, a maverick politician who doesn’t play by the rules and who, with his poking the establishment in the eye stance, wins himself a huge following.
His colourful, controversial personality seemed to stir only amused admiration from the national press, and he seemed to make no one – except maybe Johnny Smith – nervous.” Johnny Smith is of course the hero of The Dead Zone.
It’s not just that the stakes are so high, it’s that in this small locale King brings together pain, hope, faith and anger to give us a hero whose journey is huge even though he doesn’t travel far.
"Some things were better lost than found."3.5⭐ - I liked most of The Dead Zone.
I feel like it ended up going in a strange direction.
I listened to the audiobook, and I got confused at some times - that may just be because I was listening instead of reading.
I think I enjoyed the first half of the book more than the second.
Johnny's story is quite tragic, and it's sad that everything got so messed up for him when he didn't even really do anything wrong.
It's not a bad book at all, though; it's just not a favorite.
Deciding which books to read first was the main thing.
Anyway, the point of this is that he happened to mention that his style of writing lends itself to character and situation writing rather than plot construction, and that The Dead Zone was one of the few exceptions for him.Actually, the book The Dead Zone reminds me most of is 11/22/63.
Many of the themes and occurrences here feel like the initial incarnations of events and characters and types that occur in that book (and of course I ended up loving them both).
seriously, so many likenesses between these books.
Clearly, King had things to say about American politics as he saw them in his present - and in a frightening projected future.The supernatural element in this story isn't a new one.
And besides, the supernatural here ends up acting as deus ex machina: Johnny has an episode, and both he and reader get a huge dose of foreshadowing, and all of the character development and drama now has precise direction, which is over here, says the narrator, this way this way, look at this here: a ha, the plot thickens.I wonder: did this device allow King to circumvent any evidence to support his take on contemporary politics?
