It's totally and utterly ridiculous  but I still laughed like crazy through most of it  The sad part is, those scenes weren't funny I don't know what's worse, the writing or the story.
His obsession with her panties..The ending was overly sentimental and sweet and I just wanted to get it over withSo, even though I found this absolutely ridiculous, I still had a great time laughing at almost everything in the book  It didn't kill me dead, it made my evening  And the question is, how to rate something stupid that you enjoyed reading?You don't.
Thoughts before reading this book: "I wonder what this book is about?"Thoughts while reading this book: "Holy hell, Batman!"Thoughts after reading this book: "#J@$QIOFAIFJDSLK%$UQ#*"* This review was not paid for nor endorsed by the authors. In fact, they'd probably rather it not exist at all.
Instead of sexy t.v. fan-fiction, we get repetitive, boring, office sex with this book's version of Edward and Bella doing the "how many pairs of underwear can we ruin?" dance.
Hey, I'm more than okay with PWP (porn without plot) erotica, but if we're gonna go that route, either the story needs to be about half the length (a quickie just to get you going), or it has to be written by an author who writes the best damn sex you've ever read, to the point where you forget to look for a story.
This book is UNRATABLE!!!!Honestly in the beginning i wanted to give it 5 stars only because i can't remember when was the last time I actually cried from all the laughing while reading a book!
After some time of reading such a ridiculous dialogue between main characters, or should I say lack of normal conversation, i honestly wanted to go to the nearest store and buy myself a gun and a bullet with my name on it!The sad part is, actually it is also very funny, that this book is not written to be funny!
Ahhhhh! I have been waiting for this book for so long! I am so excited!!!My official blurb for this book:"The perfect blend of sex, sass and heart, Beautiful Bastard is a steamy battle of wills that will get your blood pumping!"-- S.C. Stephens, bestselling author of Thoughtless
Since fanfiction is based on already created characters, settings, worldbuilding and the like, if you try to just substitute the names and don't build the work from the ground up (and I mean the ENTIRE work - provided you didn't already do it as you were going along), it's going to underscore the story you're trying to offer, because people aren't going to know what you're discussing or have a foot to step onto the platform of your work.
But I’d actually written fanfiction for a number of years without even realizing it – the way I termed it was thinking “If I were a writer of a certain TV series or movie or novel I enjoyed, what directions would I take that particular story or those characters?
It seems everyone felt strongly about this story, whether they loved or hated it, and I was somewhere in the middle.
While I ended up enjoying the story, I think my main issue was that I had trouble connecting with Bennett and Chloe; we don't get any characterization until so far into the story that I had to question multiple times whether I cared.
I am, however, really excited to continue on with the series once I found out that Beautiful Stranger features Chloe's co-worker Sara, as I connected more with her.
Middle of the road for me but I can see why so many people love this!Buddy Read with Sam @ Clues and Reviews!
I read Beautiful Player first and then Beautiful Bastard. BECAUSE I've heard so many negative opinions about this book. But I was completely surprised about this book. And I actually really loved this story!!! And yes Chloe and Bennett's story was steamy but it also was funny, sweet and romantic. I adored Miss Mills and Mr. Ryan so much, and I loved their sarcasm and their fights and their romantic moments. Beautiful Bastard and Beautiful Bitch!“Je ne regrette rien“ – Bennett Ryan
1 StarI can't be a person who doesn't tell the truth about a book, about my experience reading a particular story.
I don't hesitate to get effusive with my praise and love and sickening adoration;-) If I don't like a book, I try my best to not be a total raving witch about it, and I hope that comes across when people read my reviews.
You can tell, at this point, I was still trying desperately to find some reason, any reason, this story originally attracted so many people that it *had to be* published.
The publisher saw a fan-fiction, paid for it and put the writers to work fixing it up a bit.
I’ve skimmed through a PDF of the original fan-fiction and can confirm that the work has gone through some editing, certainly more than the search-and-replace hack-job “50 Shades” went through.
The truth is that the work just isn’t good enough and that is partly because of its previous fan-fiction state.
When you write fan-fiction, you take characters that already exist and you use them as you please.
If you’re intrigued by this story, get the original fan-fiction PDF from Google.
4.5 ENTICING BENNETT RYAN STARSWell...well...well, this turned out to be a really good book.
It started out roughly and crazy to say the least and my first thoughts were ...There’s no denying it’s really hot and steamy but I felt somehow disconnected from the story in the beginning.
Mr. Ryan and Chloe start out in the beginning of the book H.A.T.I.N.G each other.
The insanity begins when he makes a move on her in the conference room one evening he’s asked her to work late, and the next thing you know they're literally screwing like crazy and holy crap was it HOTHOTHOTI mean WOWOWOWOWOW… so flipping good.
I mean, okay, maybe a LITTLE, obviously, I mean I did care for the characters, but nothing that made the story ‘stay’ with me or make me overly attached to them.I’m still giving the book a 3.5 – 4 star rating because while nothing jumped out at me that I just fell in love with, it also wasn’t bad either and nothing ever rang any of my alarm bells, it just didn’t really make my heart race… which I usually want.I’ve seen a lot of mixed reviews for this book and I guess I can honestly say that I can truly understand both the really low and the really high ratings… I mean, I guess its about your mood of the moment maybe?
I haven't read the fanfic yet, but apparently nothing much was altered to publish.Fucking plagiarism.The story is about Isabella Swan and Edward Cullen--Oops, my bad!--Chloe Mills and Bennett Ryan.
Bennett actually blames Chloe for not being able to keep his dick in his pants.
In fact, Bennett called Chloe a "tease" because she happened to wear a dress he liked.
HUH?And this is proof that the authors didn't altered their fanfic that much.Well, now I told you anything you needed to know about Bennett Ryan, I think I'm done now.Oh, my!
After every sex scene, Bennett rips Chloe's panties off and he keeps them in a case.
***Calling all ye SMUT FANS***I have a new book boyfriend to add to my list. Meet Bennet Ryna, a beautiful bastard who will make your panties drop if he doesn't rip them off first! He's cocky, a stud in the bedroom and absolutely divine! What more could a girl ask for then? Did I mention the fact that he's gorgeous too? I grudgingly admit One of the few heroines that I loved reading it about. She an alpha female, but she and Ryan make it work! I could harp on about what else I like about her but
She an alpha female, but she and Ryan make it work!
I was looking for a smutty read, and that's what I got!
I haven't mentioned how funny this book was, it was hilarious and I'm not a huge fan of humour it tends to dim the alphaness (yes, I just made that word up) of the male character.
I don't want to read about a comedic alpha male.
And trust me Bennett Ryan is most definitely an alpha male!I'm quite impressed with this series so I will definitely continue the rest!
The book most certainly was a romp FEST, I'm not sure a chapter went by that didn't include some sort of bodily fluid exchange , and yes maybe the authors could have included a bit more story telling, but I enjoyed the book from beginning to end.So, for some readers you may think this book is ALL about the alpha male, and while this may be partly true it's not the whole picture, this book includes a heroine who knows what she wants and when, and I loved it.Mr Bennett Ryan, ruthless business man known for his straight forward ways and as the book title suggests, he has been given the label of 'beautiful bastard'.
Find all of my reviews at: http://52bookminimum.blogspot.com/I have no words to describe this horrible thing, so I’ll do what I do best and use pictures . . . .    There’s simply nothing good to say about this whore of a book.I decided to take a break from Mystic River being that it was Valentine’s Day and maybe a selection that makes a person want to stick their head in the oven wasn’t the best choice if my husband was looking to score. I had downloaded this one a week or so ago when it popped
There’s simply nothing good to say about this whore of a book.I decided to take a break from Mystic River being that it was Valentine’s Day and maybe a selection that makes a person want to stick their head in the oven wasn’t the best choice if my husband was looking to score.
Basically the “story” – and believe me that is a S.T.R.E.T.C.H. because this sumbitch has zero plot is that Chloe is Bennett’s assistant.
You get zero, zilch, nada of any type of character building or storyline before these two start banging on like page two.

Discover the story that garnered more than two million reads online.Whip-smart, hardworking, and on her way to an MBA, Chloe Mills has only one problem: her boss, Bennett Ryan.
Originally only available online as The Office by tby789—and garnering over two million reads on fan fiction sites—Beautiful Bastard has been extensively updated for re-release.Page Count: 320 pagesImmediate Post-Read Reaction:SMH...This book was literally porn on paper.
There is never a moment in the story when I think, "Hmm, these two actually love each other." Oh yeah, they say it and Bennett even gets to the point where he calls Chloe "baby" but I never believe it or feel any love from them because of their actions.
She still hates his guts and she's pretty sure he hates hers, but they can't seem to get enough of what they're doing.I enjoyed it well enough, but I have to admit this book had too much sex in it that I couldn't really fully see where hate turned into love.
So much that I already bought the next books.WHAT DID YOU LIKE ABOUT THE AUDIOBOOK?I usually don't enjoy an audiobook with only one narrator when a story is told in two POVs, but Grace Grant might be the exception to the rule.
2.5 - 3 starsPretty standard romance/erotica. But jeez, the idea of all that LaPerla getting ripped every single time annoys the shit out me--especially for sex that doesn't really seem to be worth it.
LOVED LOVED LOVED LOVED LOVED LOVED LOVED LOVED LOVED LOVED LOVED IT!!!!!!!! Review to come...My Bastard:My Chloe:
*** 3,5 stars ***
If this is their worst book, I'm going to love this series.
After glancing through friend reviews, which was very entertaining, my expectations were set very low.
My experience with these authors is from their other series, Sweet Filthy Boy. My friend reviews are mixed on the Sweet Filthy boy as well, even my closest, most compatible friend doesn't understand my love of Ansel.
It was hot, but you know, once they've done it on a desk, in a stairwell, in a bathroom, in her car, at his parents house, in a hotel......,
Primero, no suelo leer novela erótica y puede que por eso sean las dos estrellitas. Segundo, algo que me ha molestado bastante, es que nos vendan una idea y que está se voratelice a la segunda página. En serio, no puedes decir que él es un bastardo, que lo odias, que llevas siete o nueve meses aguantando su malhumor, y a la siguiente página dejes que te meta mano; por muy novela erótica que sea.
Chloe has worked for Bennett for about 9 months.
If only he would keep his mouth shut, he’d be perfect.The first half of the book is a ton of this....Followed by even more of this...and this....and more of this...Chloe and Bennett would fight, and screw, and fight, and screw...
Luckily, after the first half, I started to really like the characters, especially Bennett.
I have a thing for hot jerks and that’s exactly what he was!
I really liked Bennett so I’m sure I will be reading book 2- as long as there is more Bennett!
Maybe this reviewer is just a perv who enjoys the boardroom table, cafe bathroom, elevator, parking garage, office desk, anywhere-but-a-bedroom sex.
Amidst all the balls-deep wall banging, I was drawn to the beautiful bitch, Chloe.
Chloe made this pretentious bastard look like a kitten...a kitten you'll want to stroke and fondle.
While reading, you don't have to suffer an addle-brained heroine, ulcer-inducing jealousy, or soul-bleeding torment.
In all the ways a book can torture you, this one doesn't try.
One that is panty-sniffingly creepy, stupefyingly shallow, and boldly sex-charged in a tawdry yet unable-to-put-the-book-down way.
Attempt #1: 1 star.So I got these 13 NA audiobooks for free and since I don't really sit and listen to audiobooks but rather while surfing the net/writing/or whatever, there's no harm in listening to a genre I no longer enjoy. My only wish it to give at least 1 book 3 stars. Beautiful Bastard was boring and offered nothing new. *Moving on to the next one*
Holy hot as hell  how do you review a book like this ?!?
Answer: nice visuals measured in panty ripping waves of epic hotness Meet my  Bennett Ryan  He had a face that any male model would kill for and the most incredible hair I've ever seen on a man.
Freshly fucked hairHmmmm he is beautiful.....even if he's a lady panties hoarder in a non-creepy wayDelishhhhhhh...
"I need another night" Love in this book was measured in pure panty ripping waves ❤ and I lost count!
how many panties can one guy rip You get the picture.....
When will we realize that these stories are using the success of another writer to make more money without giving these authors any of what they've earned by creating these characters and creating the popularity that these fanfic stories are capitalizing on?I have no problem with fan fiction.
What I do have a problem with, though, is capitalizing on another author's work and using it to make money for someone other than the author.
Let's support new and original worlds, new and original characters, new and original things that don't have to rest on the laurels of TWILIGHT to be popular.More on this book here
I really liked the cover of this book.
Alas, things descended into a rambling, panty-ripping mess.
It is gross and not sexy in the least.
Herpes and syphilis are NOT SEXY.
The book is just a strange back and forth with La Perla panties being ripped and hoarded and lots of repetitive sex scenes.
My big question is, why do they like each other?
They never talk, they don't really do much during the book...
Like creating a story as a first step...**This book was provided by the publisher in exchange for an honest review**
WORST - I didn't even know I had it until I tried to download it from the library a few days ago - true story!!!!So, let's get to this review.I love, let's change that into ADORE office romances.
I have a weakness for witty and smart characters that are not afraid to take what is offered and go after what they want and Bennett and Chloe fit that bill to perfection.So if you love office romances, as well as sexy times on the desk, at the window, in the car and stairwell, and you love your hero to be a lovable jerk - this book is for you.Beautiful Bastard was sexy, steamy and utterly addicting.
