Lenin's analysis here is dead-on , but his view of the state, like that of Engels before him, is a crude instrumentalism.
"The state is nothing but a machine for the suppression of one class by another," and other expositions of the Tsarist state and the one that emerged out of the February revolution are generic and fails to delimit the feudal aristocracy elements in the Russian state from that of more advanced bourgeois forms.
Essentially, Lenin is right to say that the bourgeois state cannot be transformed into a proletarian one and needs to be "smashed" at some point in the revolution struggle and, needless to say, his crude instrumentalism is of a lot more use than Kautsky's opportunism.
In Lenin's view, Kautsky's misplaced concerns with formal, "pure democracy" devoid of class content and class character, where the amorphous category of "people" is substituted for the concrete class content, and his accusation that the Soviets betrayed democracy, mistakingly seized state power, and made too many concessions to the small land-holding peasants, reveal the latter to be a bankrupt marxist, barely being a "marxist" in theory, while in practice he beholdens to the thought and practice of mensheviks and right socialist revolutionaries who wanted to prevent the bourgeosie-peasant revolution from being carried out all the way through to its conclusion.
A vile screed against a man who pointed out holes in the Soviet system and mainstream Marxist thought.
Kautsky asked how a violent revolution could be prevented from collapsing into an oligarchical dictatorship, rather than the rule of the people.
Lenin does not address that problem but rather accuses Kautsky of betraying Marxist thought.
Marx is basically treated like prophets in the Old Testament, infallible.
Ironically enough, the all mighty History has proven Lenin wrong.
The larger the group of people, the more necessary it is.
Marx never described the post revolution time in any detail for a reason: it ain't possible.
Lenin notes at the end of the last chapter, that his last few lines were written on the same night that news reached Russia of the seizure of power in numerous German towns, including the capital by Soviets of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies. For Lenin this in itself was the final rebuttal of Kautsky's politics and offered new hope for the Russia Revolution itself. Sadly this was a false dawn, but this neglected book of Lenin's remains a powerful declaration of the hopes of the revolution and a defence of the revolution itself.Full review: http://resolutereader.blogspot.co.uk/...
Hiç eskimeyen ve eskimeyecek bir kitap. Gunümüzde Türkiye'de yapılan soyut, sınıfsız demokrasi tartışmalarına dair de söyleyecek çok şeyi var. Lenin genel bir demokrasi sorunundan bahsetmenin yanlış olduğunu, bir sınıfın demokrasi olarak uyguladığı rejimin diğer bir sınıf için diktatörlük anlamına geldiğini ve burjuvaziye karşı şiddet uygulamanın zorunluluğunu açıkça ortaya koymuş. Bir siyasal tip olarak Kautskyleri anlamak için elzem.

🔥🔥🔥🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻Lenin is so salty in this, it's incredible.
Muy interesante y con una polémica perfectamente transportable a hoy en día.
No sé si tener fiebre es lo mejor para leer este tipo de libros: por una parte no te concentras de la misma forma (y mi concentración ya es mala de por sí) y, por la otra, se te pueden ocurrir cosas raras y hacer ciertas interpretaciones equivocadas.Este libro es una contestación a un escrito de Kautsky, ideólogo de la II Internacional, en el que Lenin critica su paso desde el marxismo a posturas burguesas, abandonando la revolución proletaria armada en pro del reformismo de la Asamblea Constituyente y resto de órganos del estado liberal clásico.
Great work by Lenin! through criticism of Karl Kautsky the reader will not only learn about Marxist political strategy but also about various contexts, events, circumstances, and structures in relation to the German left and the early soviet union (i.e. despite "State Capitalism" getting thrown around a lot there was a national economic council whose officials were workers elected by trade unions). Recommended.
3 stars for enterteinment value.
