*****4.5 STARS***** There are many things I love about the books I read, but one of my faves is when the male MC is a sexier than hell Brit!! Also when the setting takes place in New York City, the city I grew up in, well then I'm in heaven. Had I known that Max Stella was waiting for me in this book, I DEFINITELY would have read this one a lot sooner!!! I am kicking myself for waiting so long to read this book!Sara Dillon has just moved to NYC and has been given the Director of Finance position
She thinks she just wants to have casual sex and after running into Max a few times, since he is friends with Bennett Ryan, she asks Max to enter into an arrangement with her.
He's also a well known player whose conquests are repeatedly gossiped about on Page Six of the Post.So he too, wasn't looking for anything serious.Max and Sara get very adventurous all over NYC, but I have to say my favorite part was when they got a bit kinky in the famous New York Public Library.
This book also has the enjoyment factor of a novel that deserves 4 Lisa stars.So here's the plot, meet Max Stella a British business man ~ successful, enjoying his wealth and infamous title as woman loving playboy.
The story follows the journey of a ~ what happens when a 'friends with benefits' agreement doesn't seem quite enough.The series for me is packed with likeable characters and 'beautiful stranger' hosts a very amenable and easy on the eyes Max Stella.
Read for yourself, if you enjoyed 'beautiful bastard' then you will adore this second in the series.Sexy.
3 StarsMy friends who have read this series told me after I finished Beautiful Bastard that Beautiful Stranger is much better but...So this book began when Sara Dillon met the rich and sexy British executive Max Stella at a club.
Sara and Max's first encounter immediately led to sex.
(which kinda weirded me out.)I actually did have a great time when I was at the first few chapters because as usual, Christina Lauren's writing was fabulous and Max Stella was a character beyond perfection!
I enjoyed Beautiful Bastard when I read it last year so I really had high hopes in this book.
Loved the banter between Max and Sara....and the whole gang really!
Loved that there was very little drama between Max and Sara!
Initial Review4.5 Stars.....Max you are one sexy Brit!!!*fans self* *fans self* Wow, this book was so smokin' hot!
It was all kinds of HOT!In BS we meet Max and Sara.
We discover our little innocent Sara has a thing for having sex in public places and being photographed (by Max)....where others could potential see them.
Throughout the book Sara tries to keep Max at arms length...tries to keep their relationship about sex only.
Oh, and did I mention the sex was HOT!
4.5 Max Stars ”You give good innuendo.” I should start off saying that I didn't finish book 1 of this series, it was a DNF for me. After enjoying the first two books of the Wild Season series I wanted more and decided to give book two of this series a try. Sara Dillion leaves her long term relationship and home behind in Chicago for a fresh new start in the Big Apple. On her first night out with her girlfriends she meets a beautiful stranger. Max Stella is WONDERFUL. He is super sexy, funny, kin
Sara does a great job of keeping Max, the Post’s Page Six playboy, millionaire venture capitalist, to a schedule of sex once a week even though he truly wants more from her.
Sara learns from her first meeting with Max that she’s an exhibitionist.
Max wants so much more and with time Sara realizes that he isn’t the playboy that he appears to be unlike Andy, her ex.
The sex scenes were truly steamy but what I loved about this story is Max’s patience, his attraction to Sara, his wit and that damn accent.
It is very witty, sexy and has Max Stella, a book boyfriend you must meet!
These books are entertaining, and I really did love Max and Stella's relationship and interactions much more than Chloe and Bennett's, but there is something about this series that feels very forgettable to me.
Maybe I've read too many books, or maybe it's just a case of my not becoming involved in this series as it was ongoing, but I have found both books I've read, so far, to be pleasant while reading, but able to be put down for multiple days at a time without the urge to pick them up.
Maybe it's just the wrong time and I should put the series aside until my interest seems back in full gear?Buddy read with Sam @CluesandReviews.
I know that Max "Beautiful Stranger" doesn't have super dark hair, but I am going with the British accent and I am just going to state for the record that I replaced Max with David Gandy (Sara who?).
I imagine that a shot like this could be found on his camera if Sara got her hands on it.Before I actually touch the story...Who cares if these authors started out with fan-fiction.
Chloe, Sara and their friend Julia hit the clubs.
I liked Chloe and Bennett - but I was more in lust with them thank in love with them.
this series follows the romance of the most sexy, bachelors in New York City.
In this one, Sara Dillon move to New York in order to get a new start, new life, and a new saraThen she meets her sexy stranger in a club.
The sexy British playboy is now living in New york.
My thoughts i LOVED this one more than Beautiful bastard.
Loved the beginning, and the end.
the Characters Max Stella: Can i have him for my birthday?Sara Dillon :  liked her!Chloe and Bennett: i kind of miss them.
I mean I love you.
Sara Dillon
Hello Max. My name is Jessica and you can take me anywhere.
And do mean ANYWHERE!Well holy moley.
That Sara girl is one lucky chick with Max.This book starts off GREAT.
You guys know how much I love a good sex up against the wall scene.
And boy does it deliver.
There are quite a few smexy scenes in this book.
Max was quite creative too.
The man took her, and when I mean took her, I mean TOOK HER, in the NEW YORK FRIGGIN PUBLIC LIBRARY!
Books AND sex with an outrageously hot guy.
My day is set.Book #2 was fabulous.

That girl who didn't want to fall but fell anyways for a Beautiful Stranger.The story of Max and Sara is a wickedly wonderful story.
Sara just broke off a long engagement and is wanting to find herself but meeting a Beautiful Stranger at a club changes everything.
No one is looking for forever but Max and Sara meet and start a just sex and nothing more relationship.
As Sara and Chloe are best friends and Max and Bennett were roommates in college.
So, if you want a wonderful sexy love story- look no further cause Beautiful Stranger is your ticket!!BR with one of my Besties!!!
Fun.Our characters are Max Stellar a British businessman and Sara Dillon, she works in finances but really she's a woman who's been burned in a previous relationship.
All those plans go out the window when she meets Max Stella, and they begin steamy but secret affair.Max, has been branded the cities heart breaker, he's rumoured to have a different woman in his bed every night.
Who better than Max Stella to help her act out all her fantasies.
But even with a set of rules in place these two still manage to touch each others hearts.
THIS BOOK IS EVERYTHING!
The Bastard Series blesses us with yet another fun read!Beautiful Bastard moves on from Bennett, Chloe, & Chicago…to Sara Dillon, Max Stella, & New York City!But no worries, the newly engaged Bennett and Chloe are still featured in the story!Also prominently featured…Lots and LOTS of Panty-scorching sex in public!I'm a big fan of this series… All of these books (so far) are great little reads.
I knew this was a game, but fuck if I ever wanted to stop playing.He gave me a smile that made me fear for a beat that I’d handed a slice of my soul to the devil.“You put the seat down to piss, don’t you?” I asked, grinning.“Nah. Don’t like getting my dick wet.”“Will.
"You could break my heart. Just know that, yeah?"I listened to this in audio, and I have to say the narrator for Max's voice was dreamy, especially when he was talking dirty! I actually could have listened to him read anything, and I loved Max's character... "I know you're saying something profound, but it's hard to focus when your tits are out."Actually the female narrator did a great job too. It was really entertaining when she would lower her voice and add his accent when she was reading his

It was really entertaining when she would lower her voice and add his accent when she was reading his parts in her chapters.
:)Anyway, I enjoyed the book about the same as Beautiful Bastard, but I'm rounding up for Max and his narrator.
Beautiful Bastard was I think a 100 times better in every way possible.I didn't like Sara..
She isn't the kind of a girl I like.
I hate it when one guy pays for the mistakes of another because the girl is just plain stupid.
I mean wake up and smell the fucking coffee Sara!!She wasn't half the woman Chloe was.
;)but he wasn't Bennett :PThe last scene of the book was stupid; It wasn't needed, the twist was quite bad..And in the middle, the book was highly dragged..
I enjoyed the book from 60% to 90%Although I liked the kink of this book, that way hot..
Sara's made some big changes in her life recently and when she sees a gorgeous Brit that obviously wants her, she thinks why not?
Whether it was his experience or just being able to figure Sara out, I loved how he knew exactly what she wanted.
I do think that Sara handled things really well except for not letting him explain but that has to add to the drama.
You told her that?” “Of course I did.” She waved him off with an impatient hand, and beside her, Max laughed.♥ “Jesus Christ, Sara,” I said, my head falling back against the pillows and my eyes closed tight.
Alas, I'll have to keep checking, but this writing duo has made the ultra short-list of authors I'll insta-buy no matter the price.
It's solidly written, smexy contemporary romance with the usual bells and whistles -- glamorous New York City backdrop, fabulous c-level jobs that magically leave time for loads of hot sex, a ridiculously attractive man with *drool* a British accent, etc.
A) I seriously doubt that the cleaned-up, tightly edited version in the published book is exactly what was floating around on the internet, and B) even if I'm wrong about (A), I am so happy to be paying these ladies for their work.
'Beautiful Stranger' follows the story of Sara, Chloe's friend who leaves Chicago behind for a new life in NYC.
The chemistry between these two is clearly there in the pages and you can't help but root for Max to help Sara mend her broken heart.
Joining us from 'Beautiful Bastard' are Chloe and Bennett, who make a few appearances here and there but the story mainly focuses on Sara and Max. Overall, I was thrilled and pleasantly happy with how this novel turned out and hopefully they will continue with a third book, maybe surrounding Will (another friend of Bennett and Max).
Gah!!!! MAX!!!!! I love you!!!! I loved it!!! Review to come!!!My Max:My Sara:
Wanting to start a new life, she moves to NY and starts to working in her best-friend fiancé company.
They are supposed to be strangers and not see each other again, but turns out Max is one of Bennett’s best-friends and guess what?
Sara wants more either, so what started as a one-time-thing turns into a no-strings-attached-totally-secret-and-only-physical relationship (it’s kind of complicated) and even that soon turns into something more, when feelings start to get involved.
Max wants Sara and makes no secret about it, but how can she trust that her heart will not be broken again?
If you've read Beautiful Bastard then you already know about Sara, but getting to see this new side of her was amazing.
The thing I love about Christina Lauren's guys are how they know what they want and they go for it.As far as the plot goes, it ran so smooth.
I was never once bored or annoyed by the way things played out.
I LOVE THAT too.And the guys in these books.....
Christina and Lauren have definitely found their way on to my favorite authors list.
My "Same shit different day" list: billionaire✓gorgeous✓Big cock ✓orgasm donor ✓never been in love ✓got hubby laid ✓Geesh, now that we got that covered let's move on to what Max isn't......
Max's is by far the most charming English bloke I've had the honor of fantasizing about.
If you're in search of a lighthearted read, I highly suggest the series(although it isn't necessary as they're each a standalone novel)........
Oh' yeah, Max isn't fucking his hand the entire time.
But come on, I don't read books to hear about how the heroin's day is going, I read to...........Exactly!!!

I think I might've liked this one better than BB. I don't know...I really loved Sara and Max. But I loved Chloe and Bennett too. Fine, I can't decide. I love them all equally. :)

New love.
3.5 Stars... Liked it  Updated review......4/25/2013 Well...if you read my 1st review written below you will see that I originally cut this book off and moved it to my DNF pile at 54%. I woke up this morning wanting to give it one more shot.. hoping that the book would give me more of what I was looking for. Well.. if I had stayed with the book to begin with, by 60% I would have felt more connected to it.. and today I did. I finally got the emotional connection I was looking for. Max and Sara
Max and Sara came together on an emotional level and it became more than just sex.
It's hard to rate a book that you stop reading midway through due to being so annoyed but then pick it back up and really like it.
If their emotional connection had happend sooner in the book this would have easliy been 4 stars.
The first book in this series was much better but this one did end up being good.
Did they see each other in between the sex days??
Look, I love a book with lots of hot sex..
2.25 It-was-just-another-erotica-to-me-star Enjoyed getting to know  Max Stella  ;) But other than that,the story overall didn't wholly work out for me..I saw the ending coming pages ahead.So I wasn't really surprised with the way things finished up.Plus with the heroine's all I can't trust him because of my past !  issue..their romance was a tad to predictable,got my taste.They had a great time together true...But out of bed there chemistry was more of a two star worthy.Sorry :(
4.5 Stranger Lovin Stars!!Oh Max, you are a dirty Birtish, sexy man!Sara has just arrived to New York after calling it quits with her cheating ex.
She runs into Max at a club where things definitely get a little hot!
They figure out they have friends in common but Sara wants to keep their "encounters" casual and only once a week.
She wants just sex so Max sets out to give her something she will never forget.
Sara wasn't a pushover and Max's dirty British mouth is definitely swoon worthy!
I totally offered up my boobs for a chance to read this early.
And these girls killed me.Now...
I won't go into the whole fanfiction blah blah crap again, because really, the first book might have come from it, but this one isn't fanfiction sweeties.
So, let's talk about the book instead, okay?
(Sorry girls, I'm totally sticking with that).
A great, (mostly) non-whiny female lead, a hot male lead who had my heart clenched and my panties...okay I won't go there.
I won't go into the details, since it's still early and I'm not about to spoil the surprises, but oh, they're good.
I was in this blissful state of feeling.I felt for Sara...
a man unworthy of this innocent, believing woman, robbing her of the joy and trust love brings.I felt for Sara ...
Eyeopening not in ways you may think with all of the public sexual escapades, but with the intensity, desire and pure beauty in the essence of how these two characters felt about each other.
knowing what was happening was special for both of them.So I felt ...
