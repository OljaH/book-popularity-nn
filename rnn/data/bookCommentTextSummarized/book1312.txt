Veronica, the other, is virtuous and hard-working, yet sorrow is never far from her thoughts.
So they both have their lessons to learn, and as is the case with most books written in this time, they eventually find their way and come together again.After reading the author's far superior and better known work, Heidi, I was disappointed in this short novel.
Whereas Heidi felt very contemporary and timeless, this story is heavily dated in its Christian moralism.
The characters were very flat, which surprised me given the depth of many of the characters in Heidi.
Published in 1886, this novel encompasses a small community wherein Veronica, having lost her own mother, is “adopted” by a neighbour, Gertrude, who has a son of her own.
From the mother they now share, and two other matronly neighbours, Dietrich and Veronica learn valuable lessons about life.
As the years pass, Dietrich and Veronica encounter trouble due to the mischief of two peers, and Dietrich more so as he is often tempted to frequent, along with others, the new tavern nearby.It has similar naughty and nice characters, with the Spyri tendency of hardship and tragedy.
I listened to this on Librivox for November Bookish Reading Bingo for the challenge of reading a book where the character is adopted or adopting. I didn’t really like this book very much. I found it to be slow and the characters were flat.
A classic tale of loss and childhood from the author of Heidi.
