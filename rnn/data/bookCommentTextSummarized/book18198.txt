Lara Jean has been in love with Josh for a long time.
He wants to make his ex-girlfriend jealous, Lara Jean needs to pretend that Josh means nothing to her.
Her maturity at the end of the book equates to "I can order pizza for my dad and sister while my older sister is out of the country now!" She has the sort of wide-eyed innocence that makes me think, "Child, the real world is going to chew you up and spit you out one day." I want a certain toughness in my main characters, not a starry-eyed fluff of an overprotected, privileged upper-middle-class girl.
If I wrote this book it would go a little something like this:  To all the boys I've loved before... Fuck You.
<3• Kitty is absolutely fantastic and also Slytherin• Lara Jean is like the Hufflepuff amongst all these Slytherins it is good• Lara Jean's life is like "is this aesthetic because that's what matters" and that is such quality I can get behind• get this girl onto Pinterest• did I mention how hungry i am• ALSO MY SHIP IS LARA AND PETER SO BADLY I CAN'T STAND MYSELF PLS LET IT SAIL ARTHGGHAGH• omg fan**READ #1: Sept 2016I actually love this book FAR TOO MUCH.
The Blurb: Lara Jean's love life goes from imaginary to out of control in this heartfelt novel from the New York Times bestselling author of The Summer I Turned Pretty series.The Reality: Privileged, boring, 16-year-old girl (whose "voice" sounds closer to 12) feels sorry for herself because her sister's boyfriend doesn't want her.
Now I have to wonder: has the "genre" finally ran out of steam?To All the Boys I've Loved Before is about a girl called Lara Jean who's been crushing on her sister's boyfriend since before they were together.
That was disappointing.I absolutely could not stand Lara Jean's voice.
She sounded like a child, even though she's 16 years old.
STOP.
I wasn't rooting for either of them at all.ALSO, the letters, which I thought would be a big part of the story, were really only used as something to spice up the plot near the beginning, and once they had served their purpose, they stopped mattering.
Lara Jean didn't even seem to care who sent them out, or why, and that really bothered me.
Who would just be like OH WELL.
Though I still have some of the problems with the book that I had the first time I read it (basically, it just annoyed me that she called her dad Daddy - though I did the same thing up until I was like 13?
I always need more Lara Jean in my life <3Original review (June 2014)I really enjoyed this book and how it wasn't really what I was expecting.
In this book, I only really liked Lara Jean, Kitty, Josh (sometimes), Peter, and her dad.
I quickly got used to this writing, though, and it made for a quick and enjoyable read!
I read this in a day.
Follows a girl called Lara Jean and through her life she has written letters to all the boys she has loved in her past, she keeps these letters safely tucked away from the word.
However, one day she finds they are gone, her letters have been sent out, and everyone she has ever loved now knows.
This story follows Lara Jean as she struggles with her relationship with her older sister and her past loves.
It had so many levels, yes it was a "love story" but it also focused on the relationship between sisters and family.
(3.75?) With the movie coming out soon, I decided to finally pick this book up.
It's a YA contemporary with a romance so really it's not my usual genre but I've been a bit in a slump and needed a pick me up.This was perfect for it!
Lara Jean has loved 5 boys in her life and has written to each of a them a love letter that she hid before moving on.
It wasn't cringy and yes there's a love triangle but I enjoyed the book.I'm continuing the series.
UPDATE: After reading the second book, I'm reducing my rating to 3 stars.
4/5 Stars ⭐ ⭐ ⭐ ⭐“When someone's been gone a long time, at first you save up all the things you want to tell them.
You try to keep track of everything in your head.
But it's like trying to hold on to a fistful of sand: all the little bits slip out of your hands, and then you're just clutching air and grit.” I need to talk about something here.
By the time I'm writing this review, I have read the entire trilogy.
I finished it under three days because, you know, I had nothing better to do these da
Doesn't mean I loved this series so much (especially the last book), it was just extremely easy to read and a nice companion for these three days.
Until the day her secret letters are mailed, and suddenly, Lara Jean’s love life goes from imaginary to out of control.As I mentioned earlier, I read this book very fast.
Like The Selection Series Collection, I will choose to not judge this book harshly, because its purpose it to entertain and not be taken seriously.
I was in a high from the first book when I watched the movie and I fucking loved it!
The intention was to read the first paragraph and if I didn’t feel like it I would pick another book.
I loved everything about this book, the characters, the story, the relationships.
The relationships, let it be family, friends, or something unrealised all have so much emotional weight to them I couldn’t help but love them.The characters are very well thought out.
The story was written from the heart and I wouldn't have it any other way.
Love emanates from this book and I couldn’t help but reciprocate.
MOVIE REVIEW:I loved it!!!
(Hello, Peter!
😍)It was just the goddamn cutest.
They captured the feel of the book so perfectly and now I want to reread them again.
I really hope there’s an adaptation for the other two books.Netflix did good.
Highly recommend.
Book review:This is a great book if you're in the mood for something light and fluffy or in my case, you're trying to get out of a slump.
The voice and tone of the book is young, which does at times, come across as really immature and childish.
But there's a great family dynamic that I loved.
AHHHHHHHHHHHH.

Re-read 8/20/18: Okay so it has to be said: movie Peter > book Peter, and book Josh > movie Josh.
However we all know that John Ambrose McClaren >>>>>>>> everyone and that’s the tea Re-read 4/27/17: I cannot even begin to tell you guys how much joy re-reading this book brought me.
I love the Song girls so much.
So so so so so so so cute.
Original read 4/26/14: Hands down, my favorite Jenny Han book.
I loved the writing and the fashion and the boys and the FOOD hahahahah it was just so cute!
I need the sequel in my life
Returning To the Starting Point: My (Book)Spoilery Review of To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before “You'd rather make up a fantasy version of somebody in your head than be with a real person.” Knowing this book would be waiting for me upon completing Always and Forever, Lara Jean made it a bittersweet reading experience, revisiting where it all started.*slowly turns into a fan-page for the TATBILB series.*I took a bit of an odd journey with this series, what with watching the Netflix adaption first
She must've been right about how bomb that jacket is because it's pretty much what stirred all the following events to fall into domino-like place.All this leads to me finally taking notice of the titles for the series, which all add up to read like a letter: Book 1 is the opening line: To All The Boys I’ve Loved Before.
I mouth, I’m kidding!”• The film succeeds in granting book Lara Jean her wish during the horror revelation of Peter Kavinsky's letter::“It came in the mail?
For the six Goodreads users who haven’t read this book, we follow Lara Jean, a very cutesy lil thing who wears ribbons in her hair and calls her father and dead mother “Daddy” and “Mommy.” She has two sisters, Margot, the replacement mother who leaves for college at the beginning of the book, and Kitty, who is nine and my absolute life force.
That’s not you, Lara Jean.”Also, there are like, no healthy girl friendships in this book.
He just seemed kind of skeevy, even manipulative - a couple times Lara Jean says things like, “Peter always has a way of getting me to do things I don’t want to do.” Give me the nerdy type any day, man.More good stuff: This book is real descriptive and I loved it.
i wish could take the all of the warm fluffy feels of this book and fashion them into a cosy jumper to comfort my soul for the rest of my days. this was just too adorable for its own good. definitely cheesy, but its the kind of cheesy that makes your stomach flutter. how i wish my teenage years had been a YA contemporary novel - i would have died to have my own peter. oh, be still my swooning heart. <3↠ 4 stars
Reread in June 2015 for my Goodreads group readalong! Loved it just as much the second time! 1st read:SO CUTE. I loved the Song sister's relationship! Can't wait for book two! I didn't realize at first that there were going to be more and I was so sad that this book was over :(Keep watching for my full review! PLUS a giveaway is coming soon near you soon!! *wink wink*
all i have to say is: let me warn you about peter kavinsky. he's the kind of boy who's sarcastic and witty and amused all the time and who is actually the tiniest cinnamon roll on the planet. also his smile is dangerously cute and you will swoon and you will want to have his babies but you will be in for a huge disappointment. because he is mine.
My original 3-star review can be found below.Let's kick off this review with a little music:Look at me, I'm Lara Jean!Lousy at figuring out mysteriesWon't drive a car unless I absolutely have toI can't!
But since he's Margot's, she bundles up her feelings, only expressing them through a letter and hides that letter away along with others dedicated to the boys she's loved over the years.
It was sweet and Lara Jean's gradual feelings for one boy made me smile multiple times while I was reading.
(view spoiler)[We've already established that Josh is off-limits and Lara Jean is in love with Peter.
This book was so dramatic and childish that I just could not enjoy it.
Lara Jean's plan was so foolish and the love triangle in this was so irritating that I found myself craving the scenes that focused on family rather than relationships.
I gave this book some stars though because I listened to it on audiobook in two sittings and it was rather addicting, even though I hated Peter and the ending was a bit of a let-down.
You might like this if you're into dramatic, cheesy YA books about jealousy and angst and love triangles, but it was not my cup of tea.
3.5 Stars  ”It's not like in the movies. It's better, because it's real.” Does this need introduction at this point??Pros:- Asian FMC! And she’s allowed to be soft and tough and everything in between! - Lucas is precious and deserves all the ascots he wants. - Peter Kavinsky comes over and helps Lara Jean bake cupcakes while she’s in her sweats. Need me a freak like that.- It’s actually an inventive take on the fake dating trope. - There’s this whole thing about growing up and learning to say g
Need me a freak like that.- It’s actually an inventive take on the fake dating trope.
Sis has a level head on her shoulders.- Lara Jean starts seemed really immature, but it becomes apparent that she’s just never had to do things for herself because Margot and her dad protected her and Kitty?
Love me a flirty, confident boy who’s actually all soft and notices the little stuff.- Like that freaking yogurt y’all.
Lara Jean just like instantly believed every bad rumor and I’m still not sure why she was mad or why Peter was mad and maybe I’m just old.
This sounds adorable!And looks pretty adorable too!
My letters are for when I don't want to be in love anymore.
But when Margot goes to Scotland for college, Lara Jean suddenly must start taking more responsibility for helping her dad and her younger sister, while buckling down for the all-important junior year of school.But everything changes in a split second when somehow, Lara Jean's love letters get sent to their intended recipients.
This is one of those books with a lot of heart, one you want to keep reading even though you pretty much know how the plot will unfold, and you don't really care.Jenny Han is a really engaging writer, and she evoked a lot of nostalgic feelings for me about crushes and jealousy and being afraid to share your true feelings.
This book was actually super engaging. I loved the main character, her navigation through her crushes and past loves, and her family!Full review to come.Old Update:I love this title. Like, really love it. It's just, we all have boys we have loved before so it resonates. Plus it sounds like quite a beginning to an awesome letter to all your past loves about why it didn't quite work out. We can only hope for a very juicy/scandalous explanation.
4.25⭐If you've read my review of  Geekerella by Ashley Poston then you probably already know that I was never a huge fan of contemporary novels. In fact I used to despise the genre as a whole and to be honest I don't know why. After reading this book I kind of grasped at the reason why people enjoy this genre so much because, much to my surprise, I have too.  “It's not like in the movies. It's better, because it's real.”  This book follows Lara Jean who, as your average high school teenager, ten
After reading this book I kind of grasped at the reason why people enjoy this genre so much because, much to my surprise, I have too.
One day, she finds out all her letters have been mailed and her life spirals out of control.Ok so first of all I didn't plan on reading this book.
What I actually didn't like as much in this book were the relationships.
Sure, they were fun to read about but I feel like I wasn't as emotionally invested in them as I wanted to be.
I liked Peter Kavinsky as person and sure he and Lara Jean would probably be great friends but beyond that?
Still just as cute and lovely as the first time I read it (back in 2015). I love these characters so much. These books just make me want to spend time with my family. Love!
update: the movie is cute as hell though and i..... kinda love it???--i hate lara jean more than i hate people who hate lila bard and that's all you need to know about this book
Aquí todo empieza con Lara Jean, una chica de ascendencia coreana que vive en Estados Unidos con su padre y sus dos hermanas, pues su madre murió en un accidente.
Lara Jean le escribe cartas de amor a los chicos que le gustaron para cerrar ese ciclo, para desahogarse y dejar todos sus sentimientos en una carta que nunca se enviará y quedará guardada para siempre en una caja de sombreros que ella esconde en su armario.
Lara Jean es una chica que toda su vida ha preferido vivir el amor a través de los libros y las películas, pues la vida real es bastante aterradora cuando se trata de poner tu corazón en juego.
I am glad I stuck with it because by the end I was feeling like I was back in high going through the same things Lara Jean was going through.It wasn’t the best written book by any means.
I want you to understand that I’m not giving it 4 STARS because it was well written or anything like that.
I’m giving it 4 STARS because it was super fucking cute and I had fun reading it.Do I recommend this book?
