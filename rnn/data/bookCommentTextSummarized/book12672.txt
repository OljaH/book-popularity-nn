I loved this one so much.
Judith and Frances Catherine were just so damn cute.
Their friendship was like icing on the cake for me.
I loved Iain.
He just had so much more charm than other JG heroes I have read.
I also really loved Judith.
I loved that she was sassy, outspoken and brave.
I thought Judith and Iain had a sweet relationship filled with passion.
I also really liked the secondary characters a lot too.
I laughed a lot while reading this book.
It's one of those sweet feel good reads.
What a nice way to start a book!Judith and Frances Catherine met as children and formed an unlikely friendship.
Iain was the laird of the Maitland clan and Frances Catherine's brother-in-law, and the idea of having an Englishwoman as a guest in his lands didn't particularly sit well with him but he agreed to fulfill his sister-in-law's request - after all, he was an honorable man and he always put his family first, no matter what.
No wonder everyone always ended up agreeing with her.Iain and Judith's love story was funny and sigh-worthy at the same time.
They grew up seeing each other once a year and had that kind of loyalty that only comes with being best girlfriends.When our heroine's bestie, Frances Catherine, becomes pregnant, she calls upon our girl, Judith, to fulfill a promise she made to be there when the baby is born.
This may seem like no big deal, but Judith is English and Frances Catherine is Scottish and in a clan of some very anti-English warriors.
Men. They try, don't they?Frances Catherine reacts to Judith's marriage with the perfect best-friend question:
But, after seeing the friendship of these two, things start to change.
This book was amazing!I loved how possessive the hero was towards the heroine. He would not let he ride with anyone else during their trip to the keep. Omg he was just so sweet and he was loving. Their chemistry was off the charts and the whole birthing rights and rituals was just great to read. I had to look up everything. Wow have we come a long way from these dark days.The whole sin of eve thing was pissing me off. It was those times I guess. Still loved it.
I was easily swept into Julie Garwood’s world of witty dialogue, enchanting characters, and feel good romance.I did, however, find it difficult to feel the connection and chemistry between Iain's and Judith's characters during the first half of the book.
Fortunately, by the end of the story I was a firm believer in Judith's and Iain's relationship.There is a reason I gave this book a higher rating than I normally would have, considering I was less than enchanted with the romantic element between the two main characters.
By far the best written wedding scene I've read to date!Over all, I enjoyed The Secret and would recommend it.
*** 4 ***A very sweet and pleasant Highlander Historical Romance!
I enjoyed it exactly for what it was - a romance in a very difficult for women time.
I know most of my GR friends get upset over the almost none existing female rights of those times and want all heroines to be strong, bold and independent, which would be absolutely absurd for their environment.
And I am sure that every woman who has ever read a romance novel knows, the Scottish man, being from the highlands, lowlands or the border region, is the hottest, most virulent man in the world!!!
5 bloody brilliant, hot Highland Laird stars! Audio/Kindle/Paperback ReviewVery rarely do I have the opportunity to read a book that isn't a review required read, but I needed something familiar, something comforting this past week, and so I chose to re-read/listen to this story. I am so, so very glad I did!I had read The Secret (paperback) years ago and never reviewed because I was on a Julie Garwood binge. Book after book, I didn't have time to stop and write down my thoughts because I couldn
Audio/Kindle/Paperback ReviewVery rarely do I have the opportunity to read a book that isn't a review required read, but I needed something familiar, something comforting this past week, and so I chose to re-read/listen to this story.
It's amazing!Description...New York Times best-selling author Julie Garwood captures the Highland splendor of medieval Scotland in this breathtaking love story.
Surely nothing would wrench her from the affection and trust of Iain and his clan...not even the truth about her father, a devastating secret that could shatter the boldest alliance, and the most glorious of loves!My review...Julie Garwood was my first venture into Historical Romance, and the genre became an instant favorite.
I loved The Secret and after listening to it for the first time and re-reading it for the 20 billionth time, I think I love it more.Judith is a strong and feisty English woman whose best friend is a Scot.
Ian is Laird and as a favour to his brother offers to collect the English woman.
Ian thinks his brother is daft giving in to his woman and scoffed at his devotion and need to make her happy.
Only the two of them can decide if their love is worth the sacrifice.
I think that if it had been either a funny book or a dark book I would have enjoyed it more, but this mix of funny banter with very dark topics didn’t do it for me.On one hand, you have very serious topics: dangers and fear of pregnancy (which is the first time I have read in a historical so I give the author kudos for that), battles between clans in Scotland, the hatred between the Scottish and the English.
She’s even able to introduce changes about the way women are treated in the clan and everybody sees the justice of her arguments and agrees with her!
I've had a few of them lately that have left me disappointed but not this one!I loved it.
The banter between Iain and Judith is a hoot.
Loved it!So...why not a 5 star as I'd marked it in the past?
IDK but for me it went just a bit OTT with how Judith changed the clan.
Watching him fall in love with Judith was delicious though.I liked the side characters and wish we could learn if Ramsey and Brodick found their English wives.
Judith was OTT and melodramatic and perfect for Iain.
Will I read (reread) more from this author?
I felt like the romance was off to great start, but then quickly took a backseat to the clan and family drama going on.
The ending felt way too abrupt too, and where was my beloved epilogue?!Brief Summary of the Storyline:  This is Judith and Iain story.
There is some clan and family drama, a few sexy times, and some funny moments...and they get a HEA ending.POV: This alternated between focusing on Judith and Iain in 3rd person narrative.Overall Pace of Story:  Good.
Sadness level: Low, no tissues neededPush/Pull: Yes (view spoiler)[The H pushes away emotionally at times, but I'd say he is still the main pursuer of the relationship.
Sigh!!! This was magnificent!!! I hadn't done a highlander book in a long while. The story was adorable. The writing was funny and the characters were endearing. Lovely!!!
20 years ago all I read was historical romance.
Judith is probably my favorite heroine I've read in a very long time.
Today's heroines aren't always very womanly because it's almost a bad word to need a man for anything.
I like a strong man who can lead and protect and provide.
Yet he cherishes and respects his woman always.
The way one woman..
I have been in a romance fog since I started this story yesterday.
I'm only wishing I had more time to just binge read this author.
This will definitely be a favorite of mine forever.
There’s quite a bit of sexual tension and the hero is reluctant to admit his feelings for the heroine, but there is hardly any arguing mostly one-upmanship with sharp wit and even sharper banter which makes this story a true gem.Iain, Laird of clan Maitland, tries soooo hard to act all cool and be Mr I’m In Control of My Woman only to end up doing exactly what she wanted him to do before the war of words started.
It’s very moving how she treats the other women in the clan also and what happens as a result.This isn’t your run of the mill medieval.
Opening line: They became friends before they were old enough to understand they were supposed to hate each other.That's got to be one of loveliest opening lines ever, and everything that came afterwards was as delightful as that. A true keeper that only gets better every time I reread it.
SENİ AHİM’E ŞİKÂYET EDERİM JULİE!Böyle bir erkeği İskoç erkeği yazmak büyük suç ilan edilmeli ve Julie en ağır cezaya çarptırılmalı. Çünkü, Allah aşına, IAIN’de İNSAN MIYDI?Onu geçtim OLAN VAR, OLMAYAN VAR ULAN, az insaflı ol yazarken! Çiçeklerle Judith,” dedi. “Tapınak çiçeklerle dolacak. Söz veriyorum.” Sanırım bu, bugüne kadar okuduğum en muhteşem İskoç romanıydı! Başından sonuna kadar her kelimesine bayıldım. Karakterleri, olayları ve aklınıza gelecek her şeyinden bahsediyorum. Dibimin düşme
Dibimin düşmediği tek satır yoktu.Daha önce okuduğum iki Garwood kitabı beni tatmin etmemişti işin doğrusu.
Sana özel olarak çok önemli bir şey söylemek istiyorum.”“Hayır.”Judith kendini tutamadı.
“Iain, lütfen Brodick’e benimle dışarı gelmesini emret.”“Hayır.”“Neden kızgınsın?”“Kızgın değilim.”“Kaşlarını çatıyorsun.”“Kahretsin, Judith, sana bir gün evleneceğini kabul ettirmeye çalışıyorum.”Judith Iain'den farklı bir tarafa döndü.
“Ben tam olarak ne kadar zamandır yokum?”Judith, “Üç hafta, iki gün,” diye yanıtladı.
“Bu da ne demek?” diye sordu.“Patrick bana, karısını sırf hoşnut etmek için, gerekirse, cehennem ateşlerinde yürüyeceğini söyledi.”Judith yatağa doğru yürüdü ve yatağın kenarına oturdu.
“Niye gülüyorsun?” diye sordu.Iain kıkırdayarak, “İngiltere’de avlanmaya gidiyorlar,” yanıtını verdi.Judith’in tamamen kafası karışmış bir halde, “Neden?” sorununu yöneltti.“Burada aradıklarını bulamadılar.
It was funny, heartwarming, charming, and romantic and amazing all wrapped in one.
JG’s highland romances are quickly moving up on my favorite list.
Lady Judith Elizabeth is a wonderful (English) heroine and Iain is a clueless, arrogant Scottish lair who doesn't think he will fall in love – but of course he does *happy sigh* It might have been quite similar to The Bride but why change an amazing concept?
And the scenery in this book was amazing.
I so want to go to the Scottish highland - like right now!
It's cheesy and probably not incredibly historically accurate, but still manages to be very enjoyable. I even find myself loving Garwood's Mary Sue heroines. I suppose she simply gets a pass for making it all so darn enjoyable. Recommended for days when you just want a light/sweet/feel good romance.
AAAAAA İSKOÇLARA BAYILIYORUM , COK GUZELDİ BEEEEE *_*  Sevgi sözcüklerine dair düşünmeyi gerektiren, oldukça beceriksizce bir girişimdi bu ve Iain'in bu alanda kesinlikle hiç deneyimi yoktu. Yine de Iain bir çuval inciri berbat etmemeye kararlıydı. Bu anın Judith için kusursuz olması gerekiyordu. Iain sözüne, "Judith..." diyerek başladı. "Evet, Iain?""Ben seni alıkoyuyorum."
There are great secondary characters in this one who later on appear in Garwood's sequel to this one, "Ransom." There is a third book, "Shadow Music", but due to a lot of my friends' reviews on that book, I just never read it.Judith Hampton is a very unique Garwood heroine.
But we find out pretty early on in the book that Judith has a special set of skills which makes her very important as she journeys to her best friend's home in the Highlands.
So much to love about this story!Not only did this have a great story but there were great relationships beyond the female and male main characters. The characters were all strong and I adored them! Bonus: Lovely descriptions of the highlands that made me want to book a flight immediately.A beautiful tale of friendship between two women that grew over a lifetime despite coming from backgrounds that should have prevented them from ever coming together in the first place.Judith's internal monologu

Lovely descriptions of the highlands that made me want to book a flight immediately.A beautiful tale of friendship between two women that grew over a lifetime despite coming from backgrounds that should have prevented them from ever coming together in the first place.Judith's internal monologue during her "first time" was refreshingly more realistic than probably any other that I have read in HR.The blurb is accurate but doesn't do the storytelling justice.
*2.5 STARS*I loved how the main character stood up for women's rights and everything, but there was literally no plot and it was hella boring :(

The story opens with a beautiful, innocent friendship.“Papa, am I damn Scots?” “You most certainly are not.” “Am I?” Judith asked, her worry obvious in her voice.
“You’re English, Judith,” her friend’s papa patiently explained.
“Am I damn English?” Her friend’s papa was clearly exasperated.
The connection between Ian and Judith was intense, the longing was real and the banter was off the charts.
They also dealt with each others troubles and baggage.“You only want to marry me so you can order me around all the time,” Judith told Iain.
He smiled to let her know he thought she was daft.
Sweet romance between Iain's brother Patrick and Judith's best friend Frances Katherine.
A loyal friendship between Judith and Frances Katherine.
Garwood includes Scottish-English animosity, and the plight of women damned by the Catholic church for supposed sins during child-birthing, but I have no idea how much is based in fact.
Still, it's believable.A favorite secondary character in this book is Brodick, who gets a book of his own, Ransom.
It's a good story, and we see Iain and Judith with children.
She did a fine job with the women, but not so great with the Scottish men.
As much as a I liked the light-hearted tone of this book, I also felt that Julie Garwood essentially just glossed over any drama or angst.
It was almost like she wanted to simplify everything for us.
The ending of a romance novel is usually the best part of the book but I think this one had it back to front.
The book started out great, stayed great but fell off a bit towards the end.
Perhaps it was just missing that extra bit of excitement.
I would definitely recommend this book to readers who want to read a historical romance without drama and angst.
Doğru kelime buysa vizyon sahibi bir hikayeydi ama içimdeki ne İskoç ne de historical ateşini yakabildi... Julie teyzeden çok daha iyilerini okuduk 😍
Another bit of Julie Garwood goodness! Loved Judith. She was sweet yet strong and loyal. Probably one of my favorite heroines ever. My only wish was more time with them together and an epilogue.
Just fantastic! I don't know what it is about these highland romances that get me every single time. This is historical romance at its best. Shame on me for just now discovering Julie Garwood in 2017.
She has also initiated changes that will benefit females’ live all-around – through giving them a break instead of being overworked, through giving them a safer way to give birth, through making people realize the unfairness of the church laws against women who die giving birth, through paving a way for companionship so newly married women do not feel like “outsiders,” through giving them a voice with the government, etc.Besides that – I just honestly adore seeing Judith gaining the hearts and trust of the people in this town.
They turn out to be such softies.I love her interactions with the women, such as Helen and Isabelle whom Judith has helped with no benefit of her own.
