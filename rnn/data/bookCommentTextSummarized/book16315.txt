A hell better than the first volume! Creative Team:Creator, Writer & Illustrator: Mike MignolaColors: James SinclairLetttering: Pat Brosseau SYMPATHY FOR THE DEVIL  Think. Why burn down the world when we can be its masters? That dialogue is a great teaching to all those stories where the bad guys are planning to destroy the world......where are you gonna live after that, morons?!!!Conquer the world, I can understand that (it doesn’t mean that I sympathize with the concept) but destroy it? T
Sure, there are many dumb suicide evil guys but still there is not point to destroy a planet if you can better conquer it (but certainly the heck of managing that world after conquering can get even the best goody-doody tyrant to nuts!)This volume, Wake the Devil, is a direct sequel to the events of the TPB Seed of Destruction, in fact, that previous story ended in such epic cliffhanger that you will certainly need to read this volume at hand.
Later you will need to read too: Conqueror Worm and Darkness Calls (I know that I will need to do it!).Wake the Devil is a hell better reading than the previous TPB, Seed of Destruction.
A lot goes on between the lines in these comics, giving us a history largely unseen and mostly just implied.Fortunately, it also relies on so many occult sources and mysteries and legends and mythologies and old gods that it's pretty cool just to sit back and see where Hecate or the Sumerian head honcho An or where Rasputin takes us.
Murder mysteries aside, of course, it's great to see the bird women and the dead rise and getting to see a whole damn castle blow up.
It's fun for all the kiddies!But for me, a special place will always lay in my heart for Baba Yaga.
Project Ragnarok was designed for Rasputin, in conjunction with Hellboy's assistance, freeing the Dragon from it's prison beyond the darkness in the stars.
Thus, Rasputin, Nazi mad scientists, Romanian vampires and a Greek goddess all manage to occupy the same story line without any conflict.The artwork is as usual amazing.
All of them are a wonderful representation of the unique visual style that represents that artwork of Mr. Mignola.If you love a good story starring vampires, Nazi's and dark goddesses, with a supporting cast of Hellboy and the BPRD and Rasputin-this is a must read.
People familiar with the first film by Guillermo Del Toro about Hellboy will recognize some elements of the story, but a good bit of the story was also adapted to the animated film "Blood and Iron." I think that as dark as both film adaptations are, the source material is moreso.Hellboy managed to overcome his origins through sheer force of his self-determined will in Volume 1, Hellboy, Vol. 1: Seed of Destruction.
Dark folklore with a good dose of horror, classic and cosmic in a congruous final product makes for an appealing graphic novel for fans of these genres.If you've watched the Hellboy movies, I highly recommend checking out the graphic novels.
And again, there are a lot of super-important story elements in this second book that I totally missed or forgot on my first read.
Also, I have to say, Dark Horse is putting a lot of incredibly interesting extra stuff in these trades.
I really enjoy reading Mike Mignola's sketches and notes, and the introductions to these books are great, too — this one features one from Alan Moore, for example.
It's just a nice touch, putting a couple of these extra pages in a trade, and it makes a big difference to the reading experience.Overall, I can't believe how much I enjoy re-reading Hellboy!
Not every book can be so much better on a second read.
Having a second one right after the first, equally beautiful and equally rich.Well, it’s the same with “Hellboy”.
For good measures, there is also fresh light being shed on characters other than Hellboy himself.
And I also really, really like my genre trash-show of clichés and one-liners.Also, I will never get over Mignola’s magnificent, magic touch for just the right balance between depiction and atmosphere.
He knows it all in a way I haven‘t seen often enough in all the heaps of comics and graphic novels I have gone through, and knows both narratively and visually how to take the pulpy and trashy genre basics and transform them into pure art.
There sure is a lot of falling through floors in this series.You bet your biscuits Id be a little more careful in where I step than the peeps in these comics...
I got confused. They were talking about stuff from book 3 and this is suppose to be book 2? Other than that it was ok. Damn those nazi's! Won't leave Hellboy alone.
I also find it interesting how blood magic ends up being a part of the story in two directions, both Giurescu's vampirism and Rasputin's demand of Ilsa that she die in order to power something greater.
I think it's a measure of how dense this story is that this event isn't fully explored here, because there's just not enough space.
It lays the ground for the later B.P.R.D. series, which takes the world in a different direction.6/19/12: Wake the Devil completes the story begun in Hellboy: Seed of Destruction--all that Nazi/Rasputin/Lovecraftian stuff that's so gloriously dark and brilliantly redemptive.

Goes without saying that I love the artwork and the great use of black. Again, a number of panels could be framed.The evil guys' expectations around Hellboy are hinted at in this volume, and it's nice to see more members of the wider B.P.R.D. team. I liked how many different myths and legends are woven in to the Hellboy stories, and how there are so many different types of evil guys, and how a larger story surrounding Hellboy's responsibilities and actions on earth are slowly being revealed.
Love the art! Love the story! If you don't like traditional capes and cowls comics, give this a try.
Od Rasputina, baby jagy, vampírov, Báthory až po strom Yggdrasil. A mnohé iné mýty. Mohlo to lepšie a humornejšie plynúť, ale som 😈zvedavá koho vytiahne ďalej.
Not a 5 star just yet but was better then the first book and hoping the 3rd one will be amazing
If you thought the Hellboy movies were good then you will love the comics. Much more story on the monsters and the history of hellboys origin. Great reads, Very recommended
3.5, para ser exactos. ¡Esto va cogiendo ritmo! En este volumen se va formando ya la mitología característica de Hellboy: Hécate, Baba Yaga, más pistas sobre los orígenes del demonio... Además, la narración es más fluida y notamos cómo Mignola va cogiéndole el punto a su historia.
—4,5kinda weird to see vampires, nazis, baba yaga and hecate in the same story but it works pretty well 👍
All in a day's work.What I love about Hellboy as a character is how unimpressed he is by all the crazy supernatural things that happen in his life (of course, being a demon, that sort of make sense).
He's got a job to do and often, gods and monsters get in his way, but he's not going to let that stop him from getting the job done.We also get to meet some new characters such as Kate Corrigan (I love Kate), and a homunculus to be named later.I think this is my favorite full-length Hellboy story.
What I liked:- The art is still very pretty; it's hard to believe these images are twenty years old- Some cool action scenes- We go deeper into Hellboy's past, and get a lot more glimpses of the occult evil master plan- Mignola isn't afraid to add some casualties to make the story believableWhat I didn't like:- To be honest I found this instalment pretty boring.
There are just too many made-up words to keep track of- Hellboy's sarcastic banter during the action scenes felt forced- Absolutely nothing gets solved at the end of Wake the DevilVerdict: The newness factor of the series has worn off, and I don't feel any closer to more information.
Pure AlchemyI am mesmerized and jealous every time I pick up a Hellboy book.
Mignola seamlessly melds history, mythology, the occult, and pure fun.
It’s obvious that Mignola is the graphic storyteller as well as the scripter, because the two aspects are inseparable in style and psychic impression.
And they are bewitching every time.My only critique would be that Giurescu (who promised to be a cool villain with a great back story) and even Hellboy himself are upstaged by Rasputin and his crew.
I dare say, given the page time dedicated to them, that Rasputin is the main character of the story.
I really enjoyed this.
I got several Hellboy graphic novels at the Oxfam bookshop a couple years ago and this weekend I was able to complete my set.
I am really glad I was able to read this one.
It was a lovely long coherent story that I found myself getting absorbed in.
It was a fascinating plot that managed to have evil occult nazis, heads in jars, and vampires, not to mention a big red demon as the hero, but it still wasn't totally silly, there was real emotion and humour in the characters.
I'm really glad I can get back to reading this series.
The last two issues of this arc was my first introduction to Hellboy. I was sixteen and I was astonished by the style and bewildered by the story. Finally reading it now in full, it makes so much more sense! I think this may be a better introduction to the character than volume one (Seed of Destruction), but then again I'm not a fan of origin stories. I prefer to be thrown right into a battle with the goddess Hecate!
Δεύτερη ανάγνωση και σάστισα από τη λεπτομέρεια που θα διαβάσω αργότερα πώς κολλάει στην όλη ιστορία.================Πότε πήγε εντεκάμιση; Γιατί κλαίει η Σιδηρά Παρθένος; Πόσες φορές μπορεί να γεννηθεί ένα τέρας; Αγαπούσα από πάντα τις γυναίκες της Θεσσαλίας, τώρα τις αγαπώ ακόμη περισσότερο.
Defrosted WW2 Nazis are striving to build their "vampir sturm" army, but they need resources to build it and Vladimir Giurescu to finish the job.
A year later, Hellboy and his fellow field agents from the Bureau of Paranormal Research and Defense (I didn't realize it was located so close to home.
I should see if they're hiring.) are sent to Romania to investigate.The artwork is much like the first volume with lots of black ink: shadows and brooding darkness.
Sure they still like to monologue a lot, but this time they also carry on conversations with each other over friendship, faith in the Master, trust, and love.
“I sought the dark behind the stars.”Wake the Devil follows on from the first Hellboy mini-series, Seed of Destruction.
Assisted by BPRD agents Abe Sapien and Liz Sherman, Hellboy must uncover the conspiracy behind the theft of the body and shed light on his own mysterious beginnings.The Nazis from Seed of Destruction are back.
This compliments the dark atmosphere of the narrative as Hellboy fights his way through Nazis, vampires and even a few mythological creatures.
And did I mention the artwork?..I’ve only read the first two graphic novels, Seed of Destruction and Wake the Devil, as well as a couple of the individual issues so far.
Much better than the first volume. Finally we get to see main characters a bit more. A bit more dramatic and universe slowly gets filled with interesting stuff.
3.5 Stars
There are quite a few very good panels, but once in a while, I was surprised to see some bad panels. The story is sometimes confusing and the dialogues are a bit clunky. Overall the story is a good read.
So while opening this comic book I would encounter a world that I didn't expect to find.Strange creatures have awakened, things that shouldn't exist.
Hellboy is an agent for this bureau, but he's not the only one.
The art style also emphasizes the atmosphere, making it one of the most memorable comics I've ever read.I don't say that Hellboy: Wake the Devil is without flaws.
But it's definitely one of those comic books that get you pumped up for more and I will most certainly read the other stories.
A dark, action-packed story for all the comic book lovers out there!
To me, it shows scholarly depth as well as creativity and it highlights the rich heritage and imagination of the world's greatest cultures as a kind of human legacy.
While HB and the BPRD are kind of like a Justice League Dark, defending the world against macabre and mystical threats from beyond, there's a sense of exploration as well in these first two volumes, which has its characters on both the dark side and the light, combing for archeological treasures with occult significance and power, exploring ruined castles, crypts and sealed alchemist chambers.As of now, I don't have any real sense of the nuances in characters.
