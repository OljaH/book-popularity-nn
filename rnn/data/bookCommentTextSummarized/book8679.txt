Can't say I've read many other Ecology textbooks, but dated though this one is, it was still pretty readable for a textbook, introducing many core concepts of the discipline with clear examples and interesting diagrams. Odum seems to be more of a water ecosystem person, with what I found scant treatment of terrestrial biomes. The portions on human ecology make this book a very prescient piece of writing indeed, as it draws many analogies in nature with human societies that are far ahead of its time, and are more relevant today than ever.
good book
zooplankton ecology
This was my course book in first semester and it definitely changed the way I look at ecology (I found it pretty boring before).
It's hard to read a book on environment and feel good because most of the text just elucidate how much we have screwed up with the environment.
But this book just as the title suggests, teaches about the fundamentals of what is ecology and how it functions.
Moreover, it explained concepts of ecology in a lucid and interesting way.
A great ingenious and engaging text from one of the pioneers of Modern Ecology.
Very good!
it will significantly enhance my understanding of ecology
for research
Good book
Actually, this book explained the very basic concept in ecology. However, since the word which use there too scientific, as a 'hungry' student, I'm not satisfy.
