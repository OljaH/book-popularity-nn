Or maybe I am that wrong bwahahhahahahhahahahhBut seriously, he is one of the best jerks I've read <3 I want to read more of those now <3The storyI don’t know why you’re here, and it doesn’t matter.
He wanted her out of town, she wanted to stay.It was basically war :DAnd in the middle of it, they were fighting the huge attraction, well, poor them because it didn't really work :)What I loved best because even though Gray was pretty much a jerk to her all the time, he was also very protective.
But Faith knew she wasn’t trash like the rest of them.
But Faith was strong and knew differently.
Returning home would mean searching for answers to questions from her past and it also meant facing the one man that she has loved for as long as she can remember.
When Faith returns home to try and get answers to what happened so many years ago she is met with expected resistance and hostility.
But someone was going to do whatever was needed to make sure Faith never got her answers.
Both Gray and Faith were wonderful characters but I give a little more love to Faith.
How I feel about this book:❥The storyline❥The characters ❥The dialogue❥The fights❥The reunionsI loved it ALL.This is an absolute MUST READ. Linda Howard, why did I wait so long to read your books !!?? I have no idea but I do know that from now on I'll be devouring LH's books like crazy, that's a given! ;)PS: I love Gray Rouillard <3
Re-read in April 2014.  FAITH DEVLIN: A poor, outcast child in Prescott, Louisiana, she'd always adored the town's golden boy from afar. But he called her white trash that sultry Southern night when his rich, respected father disappeared, along with her pretty Mom.   It was a good day for dreaming. It was late in the afternoon, the sun throwing long shadows when it could manage to break through the thick woods, but for the most part the translucent golden light was tangled in the tops of the tre
FAITH DEVLIN: A poor, outcast child in Prescott, Louisiana, she'd always adored the town's golden boy from afar.
The first time I read it I really thought Gray was a complete and utter bastard.
Do you know why men name their cocks?""No, why?" she asked, trying to stifle her laughter."So most of the major decisions in their lives won’t be made by a total stranger.”
“It was amazing how flowers could grow in the damnedest places, but the Devlin weed patch had sprouted quite a wildflower in Faith.” 
I loved how strong Faith was after the childhood she had.
I couldn't read this anymore.SPOILERS AND ANGER AND SWEARS AHEAD!!This is me right now:First, this perv at 24 is checking out a 14 year old in her nightie..
He's pissed and it's a shitty situation.He KNOWS that this family of "trash" has a down syndrome 6 year old boy and he'll just judge everyone because he has some serious daddy issues, and throw them out of their house?!
Look at the young 14 year old girl.
HATE HATE HATE.I honestly can't get over the fact that he'd label the whole family trash and throw out young kids and a child that obviously has a metal disability.
I'm sure it would be interesting.After the Night takes place over a span of several years, thus giving the reader the opportunity to watch Faith and Gray grow up, develop their characters and understand their backgrounds and thought processes.
(The real truth is later revealed years later when Faith returns to town and begins receiving threatening notes.) IMO Gray is one of Howard's best heroes - tall, broad shoulders, long dark hair.
A beautiful, cynical man.The relationship between Faith and Gray is full of sexual tension.
But Howard is a master at writing true sexual tension, even in the bickering between the H and H.
Review to come.
This book was GOLD.I loved this and every second spent reading it.
They were fleshed out thoroughly, their actions making sense with who they were.I loved Faith from the start.
The best way to describe the sexy time in this book: RAW SENSUALITY.
It came off the pages like dust.
I loved it and think we need to read more of that than the formulaic sex scenes of late.
But I wanted to see how people treated Faith after everything she did, I wanted to see her life with Gray, that sexy pirate-like beast of a man.
Being regarded as white trash and suffering the stain her mother’s reputation made Faith determined to never be like any of her family so she made something of herself, but has never truly been able to move past the jarring events of the past: At the age of fourteen she had literally been thrown out into the night like a piece of trash, and she had lived with that pain ever since.
Faith fell in love with Gray Rouillard, the admired son of the most powerful and wealthy family in Prescott, from afar when she was just a little girl.
***********************************************************Prescott, LouisianaAfter the Night is the heartbreaking and stunning love-story about Faith Devlin the former mocked "white trash" girl and the 'larger-than-life' hero, Gray Rouillard, once the towns very lucky happy rich-mans boy.
After the Night is also the story about the truth about that (by then 12 years old) devastating scandal surrounding Faith's mother and Gray's father elopement and shameless sex-affair.
Otherwise a fantastic good "from childishly sweet swarming love to adult mature heat need" Romance.Best, for me, was (of course..) the first half..
There, in the beginning had After the Night really true classic 'grand sob novel' status.
I love Linda Howard!
So when I kept hearing about After the Night I couldn't wait to get my hands on it.
The hero is abusive and the heroine is a doormat who makes excuses for his ill treatment of her.
This is one very unhealthy "romance." An After the Night reviewer stated that if this was your best friend you would encourage her to leave the abusive jerk.
After the Night now sits in some used bookstore waiting for the next person who will love it or hate it.
Yes!!! Exactly, what I needed to get me out of my book funk!! Sigh, the story was so “dramatic” it reminded me of the good ol’ days of daytime soaps. I loved it!! Favorite book character as well, Faith and Gray. Lol. Linda Howard is officially an all time favorite author!!
The name Devlin is synonymous with being a drunk and/or a whore! Faith Devlin grew up as white trash. Her mom was the town whore and her dad was the town drunk. Her siblings were no better, except for her mentally handicapped brother, Scotty. She made sure to not be like her family. As a young girl her mother was the mistress to Guy Rouillard (a powerful and rich man). Gary Rouillard is Guy’s son and like his dad he is a lady’s man. He's also a town powerhouse and when he talks people listen. H

Gary Rouillard is Guy’s son and like his dad he is a lady’s man.
He has all 3 H factors (according to Faith): Hot, Hard and Hairy.
SCANDAL rocked their town and tore families apart.
Along with the steaminess of Gary and Faith's love/hate relationship.
4  stars – Contemporary Romance/Romantic SuspenseGray is a really hot alpha hero, but his treatment of the heroine throughout most of the book pissed me off.

I first read this book in 1995...when I was 12. And I still re-read it at least once a year. Once of my all time favorites.
Audio book review January 20155 Fantastic Stars!!!! Let me start by saying, this is absolutely one of my all time  FAVORITE  Linda Howard books. I don’t know how many times I have read it both in print and audio format. The audio version is narrated by the very talented Natalie Ross who does a fantastic job!! She’s definitely one of my favorite narrators.Faith Devlin was born into a poor (white trash) family. Her mother is the town whore, her sister is on her way to following in their mothers f
She’s definitely one of my favorite narrators.Faith Devlin was born into a poor (white trash) family.
This causes Grey's distraught sister Monica, to attempted suicide, which sends Grey in a blinding fury and over the edge, that fury has him going to the "Devlin Shack" in the middle of the night with the sheriff in tow and throws them all off his land not caring that an innocent 14 yr old along her mentally handicapped little brother will have no where to go….You feel for poor Faith and little Scotty, very emotional and intense scene.

"Anglo-Saxon sex words" is especially hilarious to me because last year I buddy-read a vampire romance with my friend Heather, also from the 90s, called FOREVER AND THE NIGHT, which involved the phrase "pleading, in stark Anglo-Saxon terms." Maybe this is a thing.#AngloSaxonSexWordsGod this was fun.
I love love loved it!!!I loved the way Linda Howard crafted the plot.
Now."And then there was the cherry-on-top-of-the-cake ending..."So, baby, I’m going to be rattling around in that big house all by myself, and I need my own personal redhead to keep me company."Not to mention a crafty little murder plot (although any experienced reader would recognise the killer with the first, say, 10 pages...
I really enjoyed the suspense in this book though and I have to applaud Linda Howard for re-piqueing my interest in romantic suspense.
Go pick this book up NOW!!!!
I love Linda Howard, BUT! Ugh. The hero of this book is appalling. Gray is a complete and utter bastid, even to a sick young boy ((view spoiler)[who died in part because of Gray kicking them all out in the cold night, yet Faith forgave him easily (hide spoiler)]). He was SUCH a jerk, back when Faith was an adolescent. His sexual interest in her that night — that terrible night — grossed me out, given her youth.And in present time, he behaved like a spoiled bully. So she bought a house. Deal with
Ugh. The hero of this book is appalling.
Gray is a complete and utter bastid, even to a sick young boy ((view spoiler)[who died in part because of Gray kicking them all out in the cold night, yet Faith forgave him easily  (hide spoiler)]).
He was SUCH a jerk, back when Faith was an adolescent.
Maybe he had a reason for being mad when his dad left, but his rage was totally misdirected.
A socially prominent thug.This book sizzles.
Good suspense, with some surprising plot twists.But maybe two stars is too much.
This is definitely one of Linda Howard's best. The story is sultry, peppered with intrigue and it makes for a thoroughly engaging read. I would highly recommend this book.
A super sexy, totally engaging story!
The past hasn’t been good to Faith and I loved how she took charge and came out shining.
(view spoiler)[What she endured from her abusive family along with Gray and this small, southern town motivated her deep desire for respectability.
(hide spoiler)] While all is not perfect, she's a shining star in this read.
My only quibble is that I wished Gray's redemption would have been given more page time; An epilogue would have been perfect.
Or, maybe I wanted a little more Gray; he is a sexy as sin bad boy who can make the pages near ignite.
I say “The writer desperately counts on this concept.”The most ridiculous thing is that Gray pops up from everywhere.
At least give me something credible every now and then.The worst thing is that I can see the writer in the story.
The story doesn’t flow by itself.The only thing I appreciate is the way how she describes the places.
At a certain point, I was sick of it (and I like breasts :)I don’t think that my reaction is due to the fact that I am a man and this is a book for women.
This time, I don’t.
This is perfect book for anyone who likes idea behind Kristen Ashley novels but hates all melodrama, unnecessary descriptions and over the top alpha males. Now, excuse me, I have to go and find more Linda Howard books.My rating: 4.5 stars
I knew her history, but I couldn't connect to Gray's infatuation with Faith, at least not above and beyond the lust burning in his loins.
Gray's inner monologues and confession to Faith that he was attracted to her when she was 14 (and he was 22) was not romantic or sweet to me.....instead it was a whole big dose ofOnce they finally did come together, the author glossed over the re-connection with a couple of paragraphs of "we talked all day and night, filling each other in on where we've been and what we've gone through." I would have liked to have read about that.
★★★★★ Man-oh-man! Started to flip through this today...and re-read the whole thing! Just love this book. Gray & Faith still sizzle for me, after all these years, and the mystery is one of Howard's best. So...bought the Kindle and the audio for my permanent library. (My paperback is getting pretty tattered.) I'll keep you post on how I like the audio.
Lost my Linda Howard cherry !!! What a great book ! I devoured it ❤❤
Lost my Linda Howard cherry !!! What a great book ! I devoured it ❤️❤️
"You were only fourteen, but I wanted you."Gray says this to twenty-six year old Faith while he's having sex with her.Gray is fucking disgusting pedo perv.  He's a twenty-two year old man getting turned on by a fourteen year old girl. Unwillingly, Gray felt his shaft stir and thicken, and he was disgusted with himself. He looked around at the deputies and saw his response mirrored in their eyes, an animal heat that they should be ashamed of having for a girl that young.God, he was no better than
Monica had nearly died today because of Renee Devlin, and here he was watching Renee’s daughter with his cock twitching in his britches.She's not a WOMAN -- she's a CHILD you fucking perverted pedophile (or hebephilie if you want to get technical) piece of shit.Why in the hell did the author feel the need to even include him and the cops being turned on by a fourteen year old child?
Like, do we need this shit about a fourteen year old fucking child:She was too innocent, and too dazed, to realize how the lights of the cars shone through the thin fabric of her nightgown, silhouetting her youthful body, her slim thighs and high, graceful breasts.
This is, quite simply, a story of a young woman, Faith Devlin, who realizes her dreams against all odds.
................................................................................Odors had color for Faith Devlin, and since she’d been a little girl she had entertained herself by coloring the smells around her.
The smell of things was easy to color in her mind; the color scent of people was more difficult.
In the back of my mind as I was reading, I kept thinking some big twist would come along.
Last and most important, it ended way too abruptly for my liking.
I look forward to reading more from this author.
***FOUR STARS***I'm totally smitten with this story.
Faith had such a shit life with so much responsibility shoved onto her young shoulders.
My heart broke for this sweet girl (view spoiler)[especially over her baby brother.
(hide spoiler)].
This story had all the feels I could desire, from all the unfairness the universe threw at Faith, to all the shitty treatment she had to take from Gray until he figured out how wrong he was about her.
I adored the slow sexual buildup between Faith and Gray.
I was totally sucked into this story from the very first page to the very last.
There was only one man whom she could love completely, heart and soul and body, nothing held back, and that was Gray Rouillard. And he was the one man to whom she didn’t dare give herself, because he would destroy her.    Reread because I ADORE Linda Howard and this book was where my love of OTT alphas started. Faith Devlin knows that everyone considers her family white trash. Her mother is the town whore, her dad and older brothers are drunks, and her older sister is trying to follow in her m
Reread because I ADORE Linda Howard and this book was where my love of OTT alphas started.
What she didn’t expect is that the young love she had for Gray would still be there, burning just as strong.
Gray is uber alpha personified: a jerk, who acts like such an ass towards Faith throughout most of the book because of personal reasons.
This book is a must read for EVERYONE who loves romance with an alpha hero you want to slap and kiss at the same time, a heroine who is wonderful and a romance that will have your emotions all over the place.
