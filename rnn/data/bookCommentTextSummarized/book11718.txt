Curtain (Hercule Poirot #39), Agatha ChristieCurtain (Hercule Poirot #39), Written about 1940, published 1975, Agatha Christie (1891 – 1976)Characters: Hercule Poirot, John Franklin, Barbara Franklin, Judith Hastings, Stephen Norton.Abstract: The crime-fighting careers of Hercule Poirot and Captain Hastings have come full circle they are back once again in the rambling country house in which they solved their first murder together.
Both Poirot and Great Styles have seen better days but, despite being crippled with arthritis, there is nothing wrong with the great detective and his “little gray cells.” However, when Poirot brands one of the seemingly harmless guests a five-time murderer, some people have their doubts.
But Poirot alone knows he must prevent a sixth murder before the curtain falls.
My sister felt that Dame Ags played gawd with the clues a bit too much...my mother found Poirot insufferably smug.
This ending for Poirot's career was written during the Blitz, a time when anyone at all could die without warning, because Dame Agatha thought her fans deserved an ending to their character's life that would give completeness and finality to an important part of a series-book reader's life.
David Suchet so completely became Poirot that I can only hope someone somewhere possesses both the power and the will to derail the 2017 adaptation of Murder on the Orient Express perpetrated by Kenneth Branagh for no good or even comprehensible reason before its scheduled release on 10 November 2017.

Agatha Christie's swan song for her most famous character, Hercule Poirot, fittingly returns him and and his friend Arthur Hastings to the setting of her very first novel, The Mysterious Affair at Styles.
Aside from the fact that it's Poirot's final case, a rather unusual twist and the recurring Othello theme make this one of Christie's more memorable works, if rather melancholy.
It was interesting to find out that Christie originally wrote this novel during World War II, possibly fearing that she might not survive the war and wanting to give Poirot an appropriate send-off.
It was her last published book before she died.Au revoir, Agatha and Hercule.
Curtain (Hercule Poirot #39), Written about 1940, published 1975, Agatha Christie (1891 – 1976)Abstract: The crime-fighting careers of Hercule Poirot and Captain Hastings have come full circle they are back once again in the rambling country house in which they solved their first murder together.
Both Poirot and Great Styles have seen better days but, despite being crippled with arthritis, there is nothing wrong with the great detective and his “little gray cells.” However, when Poirot brands one of the seemingly harmless guests a five-time murderer, some people have their doubts.
But Poirot alone knows he must prevent a sixth murder before the curtain falls.
A murderer is always more clever than anyone else- no one will ever suspect him or her- the police will be utterly baffled"The above quote is a perfect way to describe this mystery.I have been wanting to read this for some time now and what better day than Christie's birthday.I have now read numerous mysteries by Christie but there is no pattern (apart from a cozy setting)Each and every mystery, murder suspects, the end is unique and it baffles me as generally when you read many books by one author some things do become predictable.The only thing I have learnt after reading Agatha Christie books is that expect the unexpected and still you won't guess how shocking the unexpected can be!This is the last in the series of Poirot mysteries and I would recommend to read the first of this series- The Mysterious Affair at Styles before this as both the mysteries take place at Styles and there is a spoiler to the first book in this story."And suddenly from nowhere, a vague feeling of uneasiness and disquiet assailed me.
Since Elephants Can Remember is largely regarded as a weak later effort, I think of Hallowe'en Party as the last excellent novel written about Poirot.
Curtain was written somewhere around WWII most likely, and put away to be released decades later as Agatha neared the end of her long career.
But the biggest comfort is that this truly excellent novel could not have been written without killing off Poirot--it is in some ways the ultimate twist from the author famous for brilliant, unexpected twists.
There is the delightful surprise that, far from being the cripple Hastings thinks him to be, Poirot remains agile and able to sleuth until the very end.
Curtain: Poirot’s Last Case!“Nothing is so sad, in my opinion, as the devastation wrought by age”—Hastings, on PoirotI’m done, whew, having read all of 38 Christie Poirot novels (and a couple shor stpry collections) in order of publication, over the past 2-3 years.
I’ll listen again to And Then There Were None and will not read Christie again for awhile, I am sure.Christie, fearing for her life during WWII, wrote the last Poirot and Marple books in the early forties, and sealed them in a vault until just a couple years before her death, intending them to be the last novels, the last word, for her respective detective heroes.
Hejstings biva upoznat sa nizom dokumenata o slučajevima u kojima je razjašnjeno ko je počinilac jer su se oni sami predali policiji i suočili se sa suđenjem, poput devojke koja je ubila nasilnog oca koji je godinama zlostavljao nju i njenu sestru.
Zbunjen, Hejstings po prvi put čuje da je Poaro ušao u trag osobi X koja je umešana u sva ubistva iz pomenutih dokumenata, ali ono što razdražuje Hejstingsa je činjenica da Poaro ne samo da zna ko je tačno X, već je on sa njima, u Stajlsu, i sprema se na novo ubistvo, a Poaro ne želi da podeli sa njim identitet ubice.
It would be wrong to say I loved this book (despite the 5 stars)...
I love Poirot so much that I couldn't bear to see him pass beyond the veil.That said, I consider this one a fantastic mystery - and one which could be resolved only this way, with the death of the detective (read the book, and you'll get what I mean).
(hide spoiler)]BTW, Christie had written this long back and kept it with her lawyer with instructions to publish it only after her death.
Poirot got an official obituary in the paper once this book was published.
Adieu, mon ami.
درود گاد بر ملکه ی جنایت!و درود بی کران دیگر بر «کریستوفر گانینگ» آهنگساز بریتانیایی!بعضی جاها رو خودم حدس میزدم و حتی قاتل رو شناسایی میکردم و به خودم میگفتم اوه نکنه من بتوونم جای پای بزرگان نویسنده های جنایی بذارم؟ 😉😃✔آگاتا کریستی در داروخانه کار میکرد و از این امتیاز در بسیاری از کتابهاش استفاده کرده✔همسر دومش،باستان شناس بود که همیشه با او در حال سفر بوده که بعضی از داستانها رو از این طریق نوشته!
Dear Agatha, whatever possessed you to write this piece of nonsense?
I'll give you that it's built on an interesting concept but so much of it is so transparently obvious and the ending........whatever possessed you?
My favourite phrase in the book is "It behooved us to forestall that happening" - not a phrase much in use these days, if ever.
Frankly, Mrs Christie, you should have behooved yourself not to write this book.
A few pages missing from the ends of chapters but otherwise a good copy.
I don't think the missing pages were material to following the plot.
به نظر من هیچ چیز به اندازه تاثیری که گذر زمان بر آدمی میگذارد، غمانگیز نیست. بعد مدتها به دنیای داستانهای آگاتا کریستی برگشتم و خب فوقالعاده بود.کریستی واقعا ملکه داستانهای جناییه. همیشه وقتی کتابهاش رو آغاز میکنید میدونید که قراره نامحتملترین شخص مجرم اصلی باشه و با وجود علم به این موضوع، باز هم موقع معرفی قاتل میبینید که شکست خوردید و غافلگیر شدید. اون هم در حالی که تمامی شواهد کاملا جلوی روی شما بوده. کریستی حیلهگرترین و زبردستترین نویسنده داستانهای معماییه. داستانهایی کاملا استاندارد که حق
داستان‌هایی کاملا استاندارد که حقایق و متهمانی جلوی روی شما قرار می‌گیرند، در طول داستان بارها و بارها به شخصیت‌های مختلف شک می‌کنید و آخر سر هم می‌بینید اشتباه کردین.
کریستی هر بار از زاویه‌ای خاص به جنایت نزدیک‌ میشه و هر دفعه از کلاه شعبده‌بازیش یک خرگوش متفاوت در میاره.من از داستان‌های با شخصیت زیاد خوشم نمیاد، اما اونقدر شخصیت‌پردازی کریستی خوبه که در طول داستان کاملا با اسامی و شخصیت‌هاشون خو می‌گیرین.موقع خوندن این داستان مکررا یاد یه جمله از کتاب آوای فاخته می‌افتادم: بهره برداری از کسی که خود به سوی ویرانی می شتافت ، چه آسان بود ؛ هر کسی به سادگی میتوانست آن ها را در چشم به هم زدنی به ورطه ی نیستی بکشاند و سپس عقب بایستد و با بالا انداختن شانه اش ، تأیید کند که این ، نتیجه گریزناپذیر زندگی آشفته و مصیبت بارش بوده است ریویو نوشتن در مورد داستان‌های معمایی بدون اسپویل کردنشون کار آسونی نیست، برای همین هم زودتر این ریویو رو تموم می‌کنم.
أرفض هذه النهاية لبوارو!!!أرجوك أجاثا عودي للحياة وأخبرينا أن هذه خدعة ذكية اختتمت بها قضايا بوارو وأنها ليست النهاية!!لن أفسد الأحداث عليك بمعرفة القاتل في هذه الرواية، لكني سأخبرك بأنك حينما ستصل للورقة الأخيرة فإنك ستقلبها مرارا وتكرارا أملا في وجود تكملة لها !هل النهاية تليق ببوارو؟ اخخخخخ كلا!
نعم..كنت أنتظر نوعا من المصادمات، والخدع الذكية، بل وحتى الوسائل الماكرة، لكن أن تنتهي بانهيار مبدأ هذا كان محزنا لي جدا :(الرواية كعادة روايات أجاثا لذيذة ولاذعة كالخل كوصف أحد أبطالها لشخصياتها :) التعقيد يملأ شخصياتها في الدوافع والأفعال، لكنها كانت من أكثر الروايات قربا للقاتل، لكنه ذلك النوع من القرب الذي يكون فيه القاتل قريبا منك كنظارتك التي تحملها على أنفك لكنك لا تستطيع أن تراها ببساطة: لأنك ترى بها !
As with The Mysterious Affair at Styles Poirot enlists the help of Hastings in tracking down the villain and it is from Hastings point of view we get the story.As per usual Christie does a marvelous job both constructing the mystery and giving the characters in her story wonderful depth.
The only part of the book that felt off to me was just how amazing the villain was at carrying out his/her craft.
It was yet another top notch Christie mystery and would be enjoyed by any mystery fan.And Hugh Fraser is, once again, stellar as the narrator.
With apologies to all the Agatha Christie fans of the world, I simply could not get myself interested enough in this book to finish it.
I tried, I really did, because my mother gave me her paperback copy after she heard that I had read the first Poirot novel, The Mysterious Affair at Styles .
Although I had decided not to read any other Christie titles, I gave in and took the book.
How could I say no to my 86 year-old mother?But I had to give up after reading the first couple of chapters and skimming a few more.
Meh! It’s all gestures, nostalgia, obvious red herrings and filler until the BIG TWIST at the end. You may as well read the first 20 pages and the last 20 and call it a day. I’ll stick with Miss Marple for the time being.

Poirot is my favourite out of the Agatha Christie books, it is sad that the Hercule Poirot series came to an end but this was a really brilliant ending.
Each of the characters add something too the novel, even if they seem like background characters at the end they normally have one of the biggest parts in the mytsery, this is one of the things that I love about these books, nothing that Agatha Christie writes about in the novel is just for the sake of it, it all gets tied up together nicely at the end.
I always enjoy Poirot and Hastings working together and Poirot's gentle chiding of Hastings' deductions.I consider Christie's books to be fast, light reading.from Amazon: By Antoinette Klein"Nothing is so sad, in my opinion," muses Captain Hastings, "as the devastation wrought by age." In this final outing for the inimitable Hercule Poirot and his loyal friend Arthur Hastings, the body may be weak but Poirot's brain is still functioning magnificently.
A murder will be committed, the famous detective tells his friend, and Hastings must function as Poirot's legs.
However, that does not stop the two friends from once again going on the hunt together in a case Poirot himself tells Hastings will be his last case but his most interesting one.
An unforgettable end to the best detective in fiction, I would recommend reading this book AFTER you've read ALL the Poirot books.Reminding very much of The Crooked House, however much better. Christie was a genius.
I love Agatha Christie's writing.
She never fails to force on me a deep desire to go back to that 'golden era' and live like one of the wealthy characters in her books.
I also find myself for a few days after reading any of her books narrating my life as if I were actually living in that time.
I was quite sad actually, when Arthur Hastings first meets up with Poirot and sees him bent over in a wheelchair: it was almost like seeing one of my own dear friends in that state.The book on the whole was most enjoyable.
No one, to my knowledge, has written a sonnet about Poirot, a la Vincent Starret's 221B.
He was, and is, alone, in the end, regardless of the warmth and good intentions of Arthur Hastings, the friendliness and respect of Inspector Japp, or even the vague assistance offered by Georges.
This, I may say without fear of spoilers, is Poirot's final hunt, and he does not make it to the end of the novel.
But, in the place where my little grey cells reside, Hercule Poirot still solves crimes effortlessly, with a twirl of his iconic mustaches.
In my mind, Poirot cannot die, and he is there for those who think.And it truly is always nineteen-sixteen.
The first time we meet Poirot, he is at Styles St. Mary during World War 1.
That is where Hastings first pairs up with Poirot.
Many years later, they meet again at the same location.
This latter meeting is the where Curtain takes place.
Hastings is mourning the death of his wife and worrying about his daughter, Judith, who is also visiting at the same house as her father.Poirot has discovered that a series of deaths seem to be connected.
Poirot thinks that this is no coincidence.
So begins the final Poirot story.
Poirot mystifies Hastings by telling him that someone he will only refer to as X is there, and that he has murdered five times before.
Hastings is to try and find out who the intended victim is to try and stop the murder before it happens, but Hastings is flummoxed at the task.This novel has my favourite twist of all of Christie's mysteries that I've read; I'm not even sure how many that is because I can't remember most of the titles I read while in high school, but I've read a fair number.
Avoid all spoilers and read the book yourself.
A bittersweet moment for me. My last Hercule Poirot novel and the one that takes the reader full circle to the infamous Styles, where it all began. Hastings is back too, and so the stage is set for the dazzling exit of the aging detective. It was good to go down the memory lane, to give it one more whirl in a new murder case, and to bid farewell. I shed a little tear and go back in time to when another brilliant sleuth was born - it’s time to move on to Miss Marple.
"I will not look through keyholes," I interrupted hotly. Poirot closed his eyes. "Very well, then. You will not look through keyholes. You will remain the English gentleman and someone will be killed."This was the second time I read this book, and the pain did not decrease in the slightest.
Though I correctly guessed "X" in this case, I can honestly say that Christie made it tough because initially you realize that it could be anyone at Styles just based on their behavior and how they acted throughout the book.I thought the writing was top notch just because it reminded me a little bit of Murder on the Orient Express with the solution being cleverly done with enough clues being left by Christie that you could figure things out if you focused on what was being said and not said.
I think that the book being written in Hastings voice with him being the primary narrator actually helped things along.
