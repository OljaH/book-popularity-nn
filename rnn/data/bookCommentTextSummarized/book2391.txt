I'll indulge my dark side and simply tell you why I didn't enjoy Dumb Witness (also known with the far more appetizing title of Poirot loses a client) so much as to consider it one of my favourite Poirot's adventures.•(view spoiler)[Money is the motive (hide spoiler)], which of course is not a flaw, but my personal taste bids me to enjoy better crime stories that revolve around a crime "of passion", meaning not that it has to be not premeditated but that the underlying causes must be of a emotional/sentimental nature.
Αυτό το βιβλίο μου άρεσε πολύ, όχι για την ιδιαίτερη πλοκή του ή για την εξωφρενική φαντασία της συγγραφέως του (όχι ότι δεν τα είχε).Το λάτρεψα διότι σε αυτό το βιβλίο, ο ήρωας του, Ηρακλής Πουαρώ, λύνει και δένει!!!Πραγματικά κλέβει την παράσταση, λέει ψέματα, παίζει θέατρο, το καταδιασκεδάζει...σκαρφίζεται χίλιες δύο ιστορίες με υπερκινητικότητα, αλλά πάντα με την φινέτσα που τον χαρακτηρίζει!. Μια πολύ διασκεδαστική ιστορία, που στο μέλλον θα την ξαναδιάβαζα, κι ας ξέρω τώρα πια τον δολοφόνο.
Seventy year old Miss Emily Arundell wasn’t looking forward to the Easter weekend when her family would descend on her.
The letter was from one Miss Emily Arundell and though a rambling and confusing letter, Poirot was convinced the writer was concerned for her health.
When he and Hastings drove to Market Basing that very day, he was shocked to discover Miss Arundell was dead – her home “Littlegreen House” was up for sale.
Hastings was more than a little befuddled…Dumb Witness by Agatha Christie is another great Poirot mystery.
So this review will be drastically biased, and I will explain why in a moment.If you follow my reviews, it's no surprise to you that I am a super Christie fan, and yes, I'll admit, in my experience reading her books she can do no wrong!
Every book I've read has been fantastic or at least worth reading.
I was caught off guard by the ending, and the adventure of getting to the ending was worth the read as well.
But, in all honesty, this should not be a five star read, it should be four.
Reading this book is all the kept me sane all week.
I swear it by my faith in Hercule Poirot, I swear it!” --PoirotPoirot Loses a Client is the original title of this mystery, and he does, but Christie decided later to call it Dumb Witness (Hercule Poirot #16, rolling right along here!) in honor of a dog named Peter, her beloved dog, and another, fictional, dog named Bob, who—with his ball—features in this mystery, but you already know that since the cover for this particular edition features a dog and a ball (and because she dedicates the book to her dog) (!) that the dog named Bob had nothing whatsoever to do with the murder.
For a dog lover, it's a great addition to the normal all-human mystery plot.I had early on in my rereading of Dumb Witness remembered who the murderer was, but I couldn't remember the exact reason.
But Christie was particularly ingenious in this Poirot mystery.
As a writer, I wonder how much work it took to get the diction just right or if she had a good instinct for it?Light yet full of hidden meaning, Dumb Witness is one of Christie's more enjoyable Poirot mysteries.
(Page 42)Or a passage like this:“I don’t know why dogs always go for postmen, I’m sure,” continued our guide.“It’s a matter of reasoning,” said Poirot.
“The dog, he argues from reason.
Eh bien, who is the person who most persistently tries to gain admission, rattling on the door twice or three times a day—and who is never by any chance admitted?
Clearly, then, an undesirable guest from the point of view of the master of the house.
He is always sent about his business, but he persistently returns and tries again.
(Pages 57-58)Bob, by the way, is the dog held responsible for his mistress’s near-fatal accident.
Let me tell you that no matter is finished with until Hercule Poirot ceases to concern himself with it!"The quite famous detective, Poirot, has just received a letter from a client who fears for her life.
The only problem is, by the time the letter reaches Poirot...the client is already dead.
The book's serious and intense subject matter coupled with an intelligent and witty detective made for wonderful reading.I am eager to explore more of Christie's works, particularly those featuring Poirot!I am on no one's side, madame.
In some of her novels, Christie raised my expectations! Now, reading other novels of hers, she does not seem to live up to those expectations.The story began pretty well, but the first 150 pages were so boring I was about to leave the book unfinished. Thanks to Poirot's perfect analysis, it got exciting as I could not guess the murderer at all.But it lacked a well-made justification, thus the three stars are all this book gets.

جز معدود کتاب هایی از پوآرو بود که خیلی جذبم نکرد. صاحبخونه یه سگ داره به اسم باب و نویسنده خیلی جاها از زبون سگ مینویسه. اینجوری که مثلا میگه: باب انگار تو دلش داره میگه فلان چیز و همینجوری یه پاراگراف حرف میزنه. این یکم حوصله سر بر شده بود.
I think it's absurd how people were blaming a dog on Emily Arundell's horrible accident.
Bob is a god damn dog.
However, that's not the cherry on top of this dessert, nope - Emily believes that one of her relatives is trying to kill her.In the end, she writes to Detective Poirot for help but he receives the letter too late.
ya know, hungry - because of Bob the dog.
It seemed that Agatha Christie didn't really know how to end it - just that she did.
She wrote an ending and it didn't really do anything for me or for the book.
„Nebylų liudytoją“ skaičiau itin atidžiai, nes kiekviena Agathos Christie paminėta detalė gali būti svarbi žudiko išaiškinimui. Stengiausi įsidėmėti viską, kad ir kokiame kasdieniškame kontekste tai būtų. Nuo pat pradžių galvojau, kad gydytojas, netekęs uoslės, turės įtakos. Taip ir buvo, bet teko laukti labai ilgai. Atrodo, kad kuo anksčiau knygoje paminima kokia nors detalė, tuo vėliau ji bus panaudota atskleidžiant nusikaltimą ir tuo svarbesnė ji bus.Bet net ir sekdama visus įkalčius, vis tiek negalėjau apsispręsti, kas yra žudikas. Puaro neaplenkiau, bet už Hastingsą tikrai pasirodžiau geriau.
There would be many mystery writers but none of them come close to Agatha Christe, We have already read and reviewed ‘And then there were none’ , ‘Murder on the Orient Express’ & ‘The ABC Murders’.
I wanted to grab this book for a long time as the title and blurb are really intriguing.Please read the full review on my blog Dumb Witness by Agatha Christie - Book reviewThis book is amazing; I love the suspense and plot.
Another thing which makes this book worthy to read is the characters and their development.
This book is must read as it will show you the different mindset of humans.
This is one of the better Christie's I've read.
Sometimes I find her prose leaves me wanting and sometimes I feel as if the story itself doesn't flow as I'd like it to.
The characters are introduced in a logical fashion, for example - very Poirot-like!
It isn't as if Poirot goes off and sees facts and clues separate from us and therefore is better able to solve the mystery.
Oh no, Hastings is by his side at every moment and Poirot even asks him questions, needing reinforcement as to the veracity of the family members.
I keep coming back to Christie, even though she isn't one of my very favorites.
The story is narrated by Captain Hastings who plays Watson to Poirot's Holmes excellently.Emily Arundell is an elderly lady living in the small English village of Market Basing with her companion, two servants, and several greedy heirs.
During the visit Miss Emily has an accident and falls down the stairs.
She decides to write to Hercule Poirot and to change her will.Unfortunately the letter is delayed in reaching Poirot and by the time he receives it Emily Arundell has died of apparent natural causes.
Poirot believes he was engaged by Emily Arundell and sets out to investigate the circumstances of her death.
Was her death really from natural causes?Hastings, as usual, is entirely muddled throughout.
This was probably the most straightforward of the Christie books I've read, and it worked very nicely for most of the way through.
Christie did a pretty good job at manipulating my suspicions throughout, so that I can safely say that, no matter how the book had come out, I would probably have guessed that solution at one point or another.
Poirot explains the solution because the attempted murder at the start of the book was done in a "womanly" way.
I just refuse to believe that there's a woman's way of committing a murder and a man's way.

Poirot receives a rambling letter from a woman, which tells him absolutely nothing at all.
But there is one curious feature to this letter.
It was written two months ago.
This arouses Poirot's curiosity and he pays the woman a visit, only to discover that she died a while after writing the letter, apparently of natural causes.
Murder?
No, says Hastings.
Yes, says Poirot.
And we know which of them we would believe!
I really enjoyed this book, though the solution was obvious once Poirot begins his investigations in detail.
It's obvious I wouldn't be a good detective at all!
نجمتان و نصف. مع أن المجرم كان خارج توقعاتي، بما أن أجاثا في سردها لم تركز عليه - و هذا ذكاء منها - لكن القصة بدت كأن  شيء ما ينقصها. كأنها مبتورة، خاصة أن حادثة الكلب و الشاهد الأخرس ليست هي أهم ما في القصة عكس ما يوحي به العنوان. كانت الرواية أقل من باقي ما قرأته لها، إذ لم أقرأ في الأدب البوليسي لسواها.
4.5 stars.
I'd forgotten how good Christie's books are.
I'm planning to go back and read and reread Christie's titles once in a while, just to remember.This was a good read.
While the woman's medical history and age would suggest her death could be natural, Poirot is intrigued by other circumstances, and decides to investigate.
Well, it is Christie, and it is Poirot, so naturally there is something to investigate.
The pacing, details, language, and work of the "little grey cells" also remind me of Holmes.A delightful read, and I'm glad I took the opportunity to do so.
A pretty dull Christie, even with Hastings. The plot is quite clever but takes awhile to start and none of the characters leap from the page as they do in the best Poirot's. There wasn't enough depth of human emotion for me.
Because I will guess the solution to one of them if it kills me, goddammit!) This one picked up an extra star simply because I was impressed with how clever it was.
They're a reconstruction from Emily Arundell's point of view, created by Hastings after the fact.
Despite the fact that none of it is real, these impressions linger on.
It's a really clever way of playing with the reader's perception and, more specifically, how the reader is conditioned to perceive things.There were a lot of clues that I couldn't work out the significance of, even though I picked up on them.
One of the things I liked best about this book was actually Poirot and Hastings interaction; somehow Hastings felt especially alive and colorfully portrayed in this book and at the same time I like how their relationship is so markedly different from other famous pairings like Holmes and Watson, since Hastings often points to Poirot’s failings and irritable traits.
I liked Bob better than Captain Hastings! Bob was the dog. This was a very good example of Christie's ability to really write a "who done it" and keep the reader guessing the whole time. It is also a good example of how politically incorrect some Christie's word usage is today. There is a chapter title and a discussion of an "person" in the woodpile that might offend some readers. At the time that the story was written, the word was still in use.
This is one of my favourite reads because of Bob, the faithful terrier. The only Christie novel in which dog has a prominent place in the plot. And for a change, we find Poirot running around, trying to solve the case rather than sitting back and using his little grey cells. The imaginary dialogues attributed to Bob add to the overall atmosphere. A light fun read
Bob the dog is probably the best thing about this book. 😄 But really, this is probably one of my favorites of Christie's Poirot books.
