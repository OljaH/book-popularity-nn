I bet he's flying to space by the time he hits 5th grade.A family trip out of a magazine?Not quite like it.The looooooooooong haul was a cracker jacker.
Lows and further lows of a family trip coming about.The book is a total laughter riot and if you have come as far as this, I can safely assume that you too are attached to this book.
This series is so compelling.
Like those chain messages which you can't ignore for the fear of a unlucky Saturday.(view spoiler)[The key being found in the pocket itself of none other than Greg.

GRAPHIC NOVEL SERIES OF THE DECADE
On April 28, 2014, Kinney announced the book's name and its cover color.
After summer vacation starts, Greg's mother Susan announces that the family is going on a road trip.
They return to their room to find that the rest of the family has fallen asleep, taking up the bed.
Rodrick proceeds to make a bed for himself out of sofa cushions leaving Greg to sleep in the closet.
He falls asleep for a few minutes before being woken up by kids who were playing with a cleaning cart.
Greg nicknames the family the "Beardos".

To complicate his life, his Mom has picked up all her crazy holiday ideas from an article she read in Family Frolic magazine.
As if his brothers, Rodrick and Manny were not enough, he picks a fight with the kids of a weird family; there is a pig that his mother wins at a village fair that must now stick with them; the dirty hotels where they stay; their car that conks off; loss of hotel room keys that they must deal with; unsavoury food and much more.
This is one of the best books in this series that I've read so far. The funny road trip of the Heffley family will definitely make anyone laugh including that part where Manny won that pig. I thought that pig will never be reunited with Manny but in the end, that pig saved them.
I've been critical of the last few books in this series, feeling they were played out.
Not so with this book!
Kinney has revitalized this series with this latest installment - there were some genuine laugh-out-loud moments :)I think what he did was abandoned all of the static characters he had relied on for cheap yuks and instead focused on Greg interacting with his family as they go on a road trip -- an awful, chaotic, hilarious road trip.You could read ths book solo, but I think the series is with the time and money.
3.5As always, cute.
My son and I read these every year when they come out.
I genuinely laugh out loud at least three times with each book.
Sure, its all kids fiction, but this one is more far-fetched than the others.
The magic and charm is humor that can be related to.
This one has plenty to relate to, but goes over the top at the same time.
It's a humor for kids who can sympathize, and adults who remember.
Love these books and they haven't grown old.
O my goodness I had no idea you were giving out a new book! I have all of your DOAWK books and they all deserve 5 stars.I know you have been writing stories for a while so it is not as hard as it is for me at the end of third grade. Meanwhile I love your stories and definitely would appreciate it if you would give me your next book for half price.
Συνήθως τα οικογενειακά roadtrips είναι ευχάριστες οικογενειακές εμπειρίες που ενδυναμώνουν τις σχέσεις των μελών τους κλπ κλπ... Αν πρόκειται για την οικογένεια Χέφλι, πάντως, οι διακοπές θυμίζουν κάτι από το τρελό θηριοτροφείο πάει διακοπές! Περιπέτειες που ξεπερνάνε κάθε φαντασία, μια σειρά από ατυχή γεγονότα που όλα ξεκινάνε με καλές προθέσεις, αλλά καταλήγουν... άκρως δραματικά!!!
I love dairy of wimpy kid

I have read this entire hilarious series along with my daughter who grew up with it and is now in High School.
The family road trip begins with a dive hotel that seemed familiar to some I have encountered.
Anyone who is in a family, kids, or parents, will find this book highly relatable.
As an aside my daughter waited in line six hours to meet Jeff Kinney at the Miami Book Fair when he released Cabin Fever.
Even though Jeff Kinney signed thousands of books that day he took time to speak to my daughter and was so incredibly nice.
Heffley gets himself into all kinds of trouble for being able to only make the wrong decisions - his words, not mine.
(He compares his life to a Choose Your Own Adventure; even in those books his decision making is suspect...)As always, parts of this were a little too unrealistic - dangling Manny into the van through the sunroof via a fishing pole, for instance.
(Where was that guy from the animated gif above when you need him?)But part parts were a little too realistic as well.
(hide spoiler)]Side note: "That guy" from the animated gif above is actually Filip Horvat, a musician in the band October Light.
I laughed out loud as the family embarks on a road trip. Mom wants the trip to be fulfilling and educational. This trip is anything but! Stinky shoes win a prize at the fair. That prize is a baby pig that imprints on Manny. Clothes are stolen, accidents happen, and an attack of seagulls makes a giant mess.
i love it
The funniest part was when Greg's mom and brother Many won a live baby pig and they had to take it.
The baby pig was cute and smart.This book starts off with summer vacation.
Greg is psyched and ready for no school, that until his mom came up with a plan.
His mom likes to read magazine called "Family Frolic".
She got the plan from an artical about family bonding through a car trip.
Along the trip many bad things happen,ranging from minor to extremely major.Greg's mom is extremely positive about things.

Even the trip turned into a disaster , but the Heffley's adventures were entertaining as always , and honestly speaking ... Manny is the one who makes this series fascinated 😄!
very awsome book'The world has gone crazy for Jeff Kinney's Diary of a Wimpy Kid' - Sun'Kinney is right up there with J K Rowling as one of the bestselling children's authors on the planet' - Independent'The most hotly anticipated children's book of the year is here - Diary of a Wimpy Kid' - Big Issue'Hilarious' - TelegraphAs well as being the international bestselling author of Diary of a Wimpy Kid, Jeff Kinney is also an online developer and designer.
He is the creator of the children's virtual world, Poptropica.
His original Diary of a Wimpy Kid was voted 'Best Children's Book of the Last 10 Years' by UK readers.
Before, in the other Diary of a Wimpy Kid books, the things that happened were actually believable.
It is NOT normal, however, to have a 3 year old kid know how to put the keys in a car and start the engine.
It just doesn't sound believable anymore, and that's what used to draw me into the previous Wimpy Kid books.
Personally I'd rate it a 3, because the things that happen are still really funny, but just not as realistic.
Realistic stories in books is a big deal to me because it basically says that this could have happened right down the street.
As a fan of the Diary of a Wimpy Kid series, I found this no less entertaining than the rest of the books written by Jeff Kinney.
The book is about Greg Heffley and the rest of his family going on a surprise trip planned by their mom, and with no advance warning.
There are countless twists and turns and things you learn later in the book that make you realize a number of things you couldn't before.
With adventurous experiences came disastrous experiences throughout the story, and it was inevitably hilarious during most parts.
This made for an overall outstanding book, and a classic by a #1 Bestseller.
Stayed up until the wee hours finishing this in one sitting, because once I read the first page, I couldn't stop laughing.
(Or reading.) I always forget what page-turners these are, and this one was probably my favorite since Cabin Fever.
Just imagine yourself crammed into a minivan for a fun family road trip .
Fun.And then, of course, add in the pig your little brother wins at the fair, and the threatening and possibly criminal family you keep running afoul of .
wait, that never happened to you?
Because that's what happens to the Heffleys, and it's hilarious!
Diary of a Wimpy Kid The Long Haul was absolutely hilarious! My favorite part was when Manny spoke perfect Spanish on page 211. I wonder if Greg, Rodrick, or Manny named the pig. I also liked when the pig ate and drank all the stuff in the minibar when the Heffleys stayed at the hotel. Jeff Kinney should definitely write a tenth book! I recommend this series to readers who like to laugh when reading. This is going to be a trip Greg and you will never forget.
Diary of a Wimpy Kid: The Long Haul
1st book read in 2015.Number 303 out of 429 on my all time book list.Follow the link below to see my video review:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5f6M...
Be it a doomed trip to the beach with an angry gull, a county fair with a piglet as a prize, or the mysterious Beardo family that seems to be following their every footstep, Greg’s just hoping he makes it home in one piece.Written and illustrated by Jeff Kinney, Diary of a Wimpy Kid 9: The Long Haul was released on November 4, 2014.
Kinney’s stories within the book definitely echo some true events and Greg’s attitude toward them is very real as a kid.
What I thought of the book was very funny. In the book the Heffleys are going on vacation to Disney Land and with everything in the back including Greg, their trip will have many things up against them.My favorite part was when Greg's younger brother Manny won a baby pig from a contest and they took the pig it had to go to the bathroom Greg had to take it and himself to the restroom, but the pig refused to use it and used Manny's little plastic potty instead. I reccomend this to anyone like these books.
This book is very funny. It’s about a kid named Greg who has many bad and unlucky experiences. Greg’s mom wants the family to go on a road trip. The road trip was a complete failure. For example, at the fair, the family unintentionally won a pet pig. Greg and his family had to take the pet pig with them for much of their road trip. I would recommend this book if you like humorous books because it often had me laughing out loud.
