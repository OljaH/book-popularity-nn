I’ve just finished the most incredible book I’ve ever read. The problem is, I’d struggle to describe it to you as it’s virtually impossible to do it justice. Julian Symons got closer than most: ‘the detective story to end detective stories… a dazzling and perhaps fortunately unrepeatable box of tricks’ Why is it so incredible? Well, for a start it’s written in the most extraordinary version of English you’re ever likely to read (the author was a nineteen year old political refugee from Germany w

È un romanzo ripetitivo e contorto, diviso nettamente in due parti, che mi ha fatto faticare e mi ha lasciato un po' perplessa.La prima parte è una sorta di memoriale in cui il protagonista presenta al lettore il fatto di sangue da cui si dipana l'intera vicenda.
La vicenda però viene narrata più volte e le indagini non hanno un percorso lineare, con un effetto straniante ed in fin dei conti estenuante.Ho preferito la seconda parte, strutturata quasi come una critica letteraria del memoriale del protagonista, con tanto di articoli critici.Il finale riscatta parzialmente il libro, perché devo ammettere che mi ha divertito.
Was really excited to find and read this book since it has been hyped to the high heavens (by Julian Symons and his ilk) as an unrepeatable masterwork of crime fiction.
Loved the libel warning at the start, and the first few pages, but then the trouble started: there were jarring phrases, run-on sentences (aspiring to stream of consciousness?) that went nowhere and meant nothing.
No. There were sentences in there that did not make sense no matter how many books of the time you've read (and I've read plenty), there was way too much of being hammered over the head by the author's own views and convictions.
This is a 'lost classic' of a crime thriller, first published by 'Cameron McCabe' (a pseudonym, as he's the character narrating the book) in 1937.
What sets it apart is the 'Epilogue', ostensibly written by another character in the novel, which features lots of (made up) literary criticism of the novel and the genre of crime fiction in general.
Any criticism you might have thought of while reading the first part are dealt with soundly, and the whole thing sends your head spinning.Reading the afterword and the introduction, it's clear that the author was a fan of modernist literature such as James Joyce - but it's postmodernist fiction that comes to mind when you're reading it.
From the opening statement - where the reader is warned of libeling the author - to the ending - where genuine literary critiques of other books have had their comments transposed to this title - McCabe's determination to pull out the rug from under everything - including himself - is paramount.
Given the past few decades obsession with literature obsessively cross-contaminating literature and our expectations thereof, The Face On The Cutting-Room Floor must have been an even more baffling read in 1937, particularly for those seeking an 'ordinary' crime novel.Without giving too much away, the central character - also Cameron McCabe - becomes involved in a suicide or murder and a subsequent murder or suicide, one of which he may or may not have committed.
Il romanzo in questione presenta come sua maggiore qualit�� la pessima traduzione e l'assenza di una "qualunque" revisione editoriale, rendendolo di difficile lettura. Forse, un adattamento teatrale �� preferibile per come si presenta attualmente il testo.
The real author was Ernst Bornemann, a German immigrant who escaped Nazi Germany and spoke no English until four years before writing this novel – an impressive and admirable achievement.One of the most infuriating aspects of this book is that the characters all speak like 1930’s/40’s LA gangsters, even though the story is set in London, so one instinctively reads it with an American accent (no, not aloud) but the places are English, so it doesn’t make sense.
You are probably wondering why I gave this book four stars: it is because I admire the intelligence of the author, his amazing thought processes and plot planning, and his ability to write a good story.
It is hard to know quite how to categorize The Face on the Cutting-Room Floor because it is a book that actively seeks to subvert not only the reader’s expectations but their understanding of what they have read.
For all its inventiveness and clever ideas and observations on the detective genre, the book is just not much fun to read.
It is dry, particularly in its final quarter, and while the twist in its final pages is excellent it takes far too long to get there.
An interesting presentation by "McCabe" of the murder of a starlet who stole a movie with her acting.
The issue is complicated by the contest between the Scotland Yard inspector Smith and McCabe upon whom the focus falls.
In the resulting trial, McCabe scorches the prosecutor's "circumstantial" evidence.
McCabe's text makes it to one of the witnesses, A.B.C. Muller, who does an extended critique of the work and an analysis of the trial, driving home elements that a reader might have missed, the mandatory rational explanation of what has occurred outside the framework of the trial.Initially, I found the style and some of the dialogue off-putting because of the film jargon and the dry English ironies, but, overall, the story and its analysis were diverting and effectively entertaining.The afterword contained information regarding the publication and reception of the work and ultimately revealed the author as Ernest Borneman[n].
The only thing is that much of this is intended (the archaic views of non-hetero whites aside).What emerges from this inauspiciously opening is the most devious of detective stories, all seemingly edits of the truth, as the writer (himself a pen name) writes and rewrites the same story, shifting the viewpoint and colliding truths into others until nothing seems true anymore.And then, when a conclusion has finally been reached, he appends the novel with 40 pages of basically lit crit, slagging off what has come before and putting yet another spin on things.
This is an unusual and unpredictable murder-mystery. And the mystery of who the author was is equally engaging. The whole story is explained in a fine intro by Jonathan Coe. A worthwhile read for any lover of murder-mystery and an essential for scholars of the genre.
Astonishing whodunnit, and how it got to be written and what happened to the author are hardly less interesting. It works on so many levels!
The jargon was so off-putting I couldn't comfortably read the story. Also, so many details I couldn't keep track. I enjoyed the overall concept but had to force my way through it.
This is a curiosity. A detective story where truth is elusive to an extreme degree with the Epilogue continuing to add twists and turns to an already (overly) convuluted plot.
Utterly confused.
At the time this was written it may have been original and challenging. I didn't mind the language but it was very hard to follow which is why I bailed out 20% of the way in. Still original and challenging, I suppose.
In the afterword, Derrick Murdoch, in his 1974 review of this title, is quoted as saying that it 'proclaimed an anarchic gospel: "the possibilites for alternative endings to any detective story are infinite."' That's a decent summary of why the book is considered unique among its peers.
The credited author, Cameron McCabe, is actually the name of the narrator in the story and the mystery revolves around a murder at a British film studio in the 30's.
A healthy dose of ambiguity and an epilogue 46 pages long make this an interesting lost classic, even if the mystery itself could be more compelling.
This is a fascinating book - a well-written, pacey thriller as well as a deep, considered review of the action and the book's genre. To write in two voices is a very clever device, and I have to say that I really enjoyed this book. At times it felt a bit long, but I think this is necessary. It's undeniably dated, but that is part of what makes it such an interesting read.
Strano racconto giallo, che a differenza dei grandi classici del genere, io cui tutto va a posto, tutto viene spiegato e non esistono angoli bui ti lascia con il dubbio che tutto ciò che sia stato raccontato sia una bugia, che colpevole ed assassino non sono la stessa persona e nemmeno la stessa cosa. Spiazzante, soprattutto per chi ama i racconti alla Christie.
Great snappy dialogue, a nice little mystery, but the last 50 pages is what killed it for me. Took me 5 days to read those fifty pages. Really painful, overly pedantic critique of itself written by another character. The only reason why I'm giving it two stars instead of one is because the first 190 pages are pleasant enough to read.
SO confusing and repetitious, but engrossing nevertheless. The intricacy of the repetitions is the essence of the tale, and the author breaks most of the rules of a crime mystery. I took this with me on a trip to New Zealand because it was slow reading for me and had tiny print. It lasted past the end of the trip. It's a fascinating, if annoying, story because it refuses to behave.
Definitely the most unusual book I've read in a long time. It starts out as a straightforward murder mystery with traditional clues and an amateur detective, but it really takes off in the Epilogue, which is filled with lit crit and reviews and a discussion of the rules of detective fiction. Sad and, overall, dreary in terms of story, but a lot of fun in a literary sense.
