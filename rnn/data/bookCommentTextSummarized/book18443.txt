There was more action, more nastiness, more character development, more surprises, more complications, more sexy, no love triangle - all of this and a well-placed, never-saw-it-coming twist.
Ms Maas, consider me impressed.Crown of Midnight takes a huge step away from the tame romantic/bitchy drama of its predecessor and opens up a story that is a bigger, bloodier and meaner than I think many readers will be expecting.
In Throne of Glass, Dorian feels like something of a plot tool, a pretty little obstacle to Celaena and Chaol's romance.
In this, Dorian emerges as an interesting character with secrets of his own; he makes sacrifices for the people he loves and his importance to the bigger story starts to become apparent.
Wow! This was an exceptional sequel. I loved it so much! I feel like the series has more of a direction, which is exciting. I'm still processing everything that happened in this book, because SO MUCH HAPPENS. I'll be doing a full review/discussion soooooon.
I'm not sure what to do right now.I just.... wow.The only reason this isn't rated higher is because the first half was quite slow in pace and I wasn't as invested, but the second half SURE DID REMEDY THAT. Help me?
UPDATE: REVIEW 5++ STARSHoly mother of all Gods! I'm starstruck. This is what I'd like to call a gorgeous sequel. Dare I say it, it might even top Throne of Glass!   Celaena Sardothien is doing her job as King's Champion, meaning she's killing people that stepped on the king's toes. And now she's got a new target: Archer Finn, former crush and friend from the time when she was within the Assassin‚Äôs Guild. Turns out, she's not killing her targets, but faking their deaths, so she's in a lot of dan
And now she's got a new target: Archer Finn, former crush and friend from the time when she was within the Assassin‚Äôs Guild.
In Crown of Midnight, Chaol and Celaena are getting close.
And that's kind of the single thing that bothered me at Celaena: in Throne of Glass, she was all over Dorian...
Still, things evolve a little bit between them on a platonic level when a heartbreaking twist makes Celaena not trust Chaol anymore.
I love Chaol with all my heart, but I can't help but hope that Celaena will end up with Dorian.
You can see how Celaena, Chaol and Dorian grow.
4.5 stars Hear ye, hear ye all who seek adventure, ass-kicking and romance come forth! The second installment doth not disappoint! Our heroine is back as the King's Champion so expect action galore. Hear ye, hear ye . . .  Her lovely dresses and ornate clothes were gone, replaced with an unforgiving, close-cut black tunic and pants. Her hair pulled back in a long braid that fell into the folds of that dark cloak she was always wearing. She was a beautiful wrath ‚Ä¶  This book turned up in my room
surely,' it would open its robes to unveil yet more wondrous things.Then it took a boot to my love for female assassins and pushed hard and now I'm sitting at the bottom of a canyon singing to myself:O' hither she came ,and stole my heart,henceforth I shall never be the same,¬†your jewels to her you will part,¬†or so is the King's claim,¬†a jewelley thief?
Really Mara, REALLY?)Characters:I've already made my adoration towards Celaena quite clear so I'd like to take a moment to appreciate our two leading men: Chaol (still firmly Team Shirtless Chaol) and Dorian (and I wouldn't mind seeing him shirtless too).Chaol, Chaol, wherefore art thou Chaol?
;-)Since I don‚Äôt really feel like talking about the plot (you‚Äôll read plenty of it in my characters section aka The Spoilery Spoiler Section anyway) I‚Äôll do something completely mean and will only give you a few words:Celaena, Chaol, Dorian, The King, Roland, Kaltain, Nehemia, Archer, missions, blood, death, creepy, magic, dungeons, books and let‚Äôs not forget about Fleetfoot!
A line stretched taut between them ‚Äì a moment of trust, and a promise of answers from both of them.‚Äù‚ÄùBut looking at Dorian as he smiled at her, this prince who was smart and thoughtful and kind, who inspired good men like Chaol to serve him ‚Ä¶ Celaena wondered if Nehemia‚Äôs impossible, desperate dream of that court might yet come to pass.‚Äù‚ÄùThank you for all that you have done for me, Dorian.
You can find the full review and more about this book on my blog!____________________________________________  ‚ÄúBut death was her curse and her gift, and death had been her good friend these long, long years.‚Äù   ____________________________________________  5 BILLION STARS   Don't get me started on the cover,because you all know how much I appreciate these beauties.This series has everything on it's perfection,starting from the covers to the story and the characters,and everything.Simply perfect
____________________________________________Throne of Glass was a 5 star book for me,but comparing to this one,I don't know,this stands out in every single way.This is probably the best book I have read so far this year.I knew I will freaking love it from the first page.The story is more developed,the characters are too,and there's a moment where everything changes.That mind blowing moment that you should read to understand it,to live it.____________________________________________
____________________________________________If you remember my review of Throne of Glass,you would know that I did not loved Celaena,especially at the beginning,but gosh,she is now of my favorite characters I have ever read about.She is strong,and loyal and beautiful and has that weird sense of humor,that I truly dig,what can I say,I am in love:)____________________________________________
HOLY JESUS THIS WAS SO GOOD. I NEED THE NEXT ONE NOOOOOOW.Also, I appreciate the fact that this is not going to be a trilogy, we need more fantasy SERIES in the young adult genre. And Chaol <3
SO GOOD. THE ENDING. OH MY GOSH. MIND BLOW.
IT IS SUCH A GAME-CHANGER!That ending had me gasping and squealing as if it was the first time I read it.
It brought me right back to the first time I read it and felt my obsession with this series and Sarah J Maas starting!
üòçüò≠There‚Äôs so much that I just felt!Celaena‚Äôs character development in this, to her finally beginning to accept and deal with her past, to stop trying to escape what it is she is meant to be, was incredible to read.
It was so painful to read.
Pure pain and excruciating growth resides in that book.
WELL BLOW ME AWAY.I DID NOT SEE THAT COMING, well actually some of it, like C heritage I saw coming.BUT WHAT HAPPENED TO PEOPLE IN THIS BOOK WAS OMGSERIOUSLY ITS GETTING BETTER AND BETTER.THAT ENDING THOUGHAND MY FAVOURITE CHARACTER DIEDALSOCHAOL, CHOAL HOW EVER YOU SPELL IT. I am not sure i like him anymore!
OMG THERE ARE NO WORDS FOR THIS BOOK. (P.S. Fucking Chaol, man.)----------------Reading this with Kat Kennedy!
She will avenge her friends no matter the cost.The story Celaena Sardothien won the right to become the King's Champion (personal Assassin) since then she has been charged with dispatching a number of his enemies.
However having no love for the King she has been she has been helping his enemies get away and faking their deaths.
In the next book I am begging for a showdown with the King of Assassins, but so far Celaena has already made enough enemies to keep her busy for a good long time, which is great news for a long series.
Alright, so I just wanted to add that (while I won't discuss them here) I did decide to scour a good bit of spoiler material for the following books.
I'm starting to warm to Celaena a bit more and I'm willing to open my heart to other love interests.
I'm still touting my Chaol support-haters gonna hate I'm determined to finish the series by the end of 2017, so I'll be plugging these in where I can, but it seems these authors believe in exponential growth in the page count of each continuing book in a series.
Name one thing that has been better in these past 2 books because of her?
I see why people love this series...very cool ending. No time to chat...Off to read the next one.
‚ô´ Wish we could turn back time To the good old days When these books didn't cause me to weep Cause Chaol was still around ‚ô´
The only thing she said that I could understand was, "Oh my GAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHH." This was also her favorite thing to say, so I heard it a lot.That's how I feel after finishing this book.Oh my¬†GAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHH.THRONE OF GLASS is one of my favorite series right now.
I¬†knew something was coming, I¬†just didn't know what.Then, suddenly, I was¬†too happy to be bothered with silly, little things like bad feelings.But a storm was coming, and that "happy place" was just the eye, meant to lull us¬†into a false sense of security .
2.5 starsAnswer me something. How can this‚Äî "She tipped her head back and gave the moon a wicked smile. She'd been called Adarlan's assassin for a reason. Dramatic entrances were practically her art form." ‚Äîand this‚Äî "Curled on the couch beside Chaol, Calaena took a sip of her tea and frowned. "Can't you hire a servant like Philippa, so we can have someone bring us treats?" ‚Äîpossibly be the same person?I teetered between liking and hating Calaena while reading. Mostly hating. I can handle the sh
‚Äîpossibly be the same person?I teetered between liking and hating Calaena while reading.
(Fun fact: Calaena finally acts like a real assassin in this installment) But leaving her post to dance?I'm going to say it one more time to let it sink in.
Each time it came up, I felt like paraphrasing Amy from Gone Girl: No one fucking likes chocolate cake that much.
I especially like that (view spoiler)[Calaena doesn't forgive Chaol right away.
(hide spoiler)]I also liked Dorian's (view spoiler)[magic (hide spoiler)] subplot.
*cough*Chaol*cough* I especially like the part where Dorian sees them dancing and chooses to let her go.
EDIT 05/09/2012:Oh, goodie gumdrops!What do I see? 2013. You must be kidding me!Love triangle. Ehh, I like Dorian. I really do. But I'm Team Chaol all the way. He won my heart after ball.  [image error]

I forgot this was the book with a death that broke my heart =( **Some Mild Spoilers**Celaena is keeping up her end of the bargain to the horrible king.
Yeah, it's fun for a bad to the bone woman to go and have all the men she wants like men do (heh) but reading it a second time and finding out some stuff about Celaena I'm even more glad of where the book has moved and the current love of my life -er- Celaena's.
Some things about people who killed someone we loved and the revenge was so sweet......
‚ùùThe best lies were always mixed with truth.‚ùû Crown of Midnight was the book that shattered my heart into pieces and made me cry many times when I least expected it. Sarah J. Maas has done something, something with her writing that has now captured my heart and owns it. Her writing is phenomenal, and knowing how much improvement was actually made, I can already tell HoF and QoS will be phenomenal as well. Crown of Midnight had its own improvements in everything - Celaena became more badass, mor
Crown of Midnight had its own improvements in everything - Celaena became more badass, more secrets were made and kept and also found, more violence and blood, more heartbreaks and more betrayals.Throne of Glass was a novel I quite enjoyed and actually liked, while many others did not find appealing or liked it in any way.
Chaol is still the Captain of the Guard not only for Dorian, but for Celaena as well, keeping no distance away from her and finally allowing himself into accepting that he loves the same woman his loyal friend does.

I went a week without touching a book, which hasn‚Äôt happened to me in years, and‚Äîno exaggeration‚Äîthis was the only book that was able to cut through the slump for me.
This book was just pure fun and excitement; it is not without a lot of flaws, but overall, my enjoyment of the plot propelled it into a highly satisfying read.
I fucking stood up from my chair and shouted "YEAH," at this scene.It is fleeting, in the grand scale of the book, and I do wish she had more moments of vulnerability, of still more development that would make me relate to her more as a character, but I'll take what I can get.Celaena's other fault is not her own...not so much as the author's.
Nooooo, Dorian.
*Hugs him till Celaena loves him* I want to prove a point.
DORIAN is the chosen one.
Chaol improves & shit, but...
Dorian.
Love.
Celaena.
Eternally~Gods, what kind of person I'm becoming that I'm on TEAMS now?& this has title & blurb!
Best way to start the year!
Which BTW tells me that Celaena shall love Dorian.
That's why she has me, to show her the way.Oh, & other thing this book will need: A dead king(!).Hmm...
I mean, the chick is brandishing the swords assassin-ly awesome(!)...
I hope she kills the king, with the swords, that's it.
I want to see what this kingdom is like where magic and the Fae still exist.
Also, I want to know what the hell is going on with Dorian bursting with magic powers all of a sudden.
And while I'm glad we got to see different sides of Chaol's character, I really hope Dorian is more like he was in the first book in HoF and less like angsty Harry Potter from OotP trying to keep his powers under control.
I really really liked it and I would love to read you guys' thoughts on it too :)And also I really hope Celaena goes beast Fae mode again in HoF since magic should still work in Wendlyn XDOkayiloveyoubye!
Celaena may be many things but she is  not a murderer.  She is an  assassin.  There's a difference. (Probably.)  He had no idea what sort of darkness lurked inside her, or what sort of monster she was willing to become in order to make things right.  I honestly don't even know where to start with this one. It was so good and I'm just absolutely reeling from that ending. Because. Wow. Sarah J. Maas just delivered on this sequel. "Enough! We have enough enemies as it is! There are worse things out
To murder - not to assassinate - and that makes all the difference.Very quickly Celaena finds ways to smuggle out these would-be-victims, but with the ever-rising number of "survivors" (any one of them could blow her cover), the ever-increasing threat from home and the reappearance of an old friend - how could she even hope to protect those who matter to her most?I absolutely love how our main character is confident, beautiful and completely in control - it's such a refreshing change from all the awkward, please-tell-me-I'm-pretty and helpless heroines that populate many YA books.
i think this might be better than the first book!
and i actually really liked 'throne of glass,' so thats saying something!secondly, i saw a status update the other day where someone expressed their frustration with how women in novels, specifically YA, are too often portrayed as fierce and dangerous.
for me, reading about celaena, about an assassin, is insight into a world i would never experience in a million years.
i actually think my body is programmed with a ‚Äòflight and flight‚Äô response.
so give me a merciless assassin any day of the week.
see ya in book #3!
I love the way Maas tells a story and the way she's able to bring her character to life.
Then again I find that to be true with most YA books and yet I still read and love them!
And then, of course, there was (view spoiler)[giving me Celaena & Chaol just to rip it away in the same book!!!
I must say it, I LOVE CHAOL so freaking gosh damn much.
I love these characters and this world.
In that moment, after ten long years, Celaena looked at Chaol and realized she was home.‚Äù‚ÄúThere had never been any line between them, only his own stupid fear and pride.
She‚Äôs not the author for you if you have a hard time seeing beloved characters get torn apart, ripped into, and stripped bare.
She did some things in this book out of her absolute pain and misery that broke my heart - but once you realize why she's reacting that way, I think you'll feel nothing but sorrow for her.
Yes he makes a mistake in this book (as people do...) but his character remains true.
I adore this series to death (yes I've already read and ADORED all 4 books so far).
