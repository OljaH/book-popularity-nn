She painted landscapes, still lifes and people in a world of myth and mystery." (viii-ix) Her novel The Ten Thousand Things, generally considered to be her masterpiece, is a work of memory and loss, of a world of haunted ruins, secret rituals, lapping water, and mist-shrouded forests.
Particularly in the second section, “At the Inner Bay,” Dermoût describes the childhood of the lady of the Small Garden, Felicia, and her experiences living with her grandmother as a child (view spoiler)[and later as an abandoned mother (hide spoiler)].
Suddenly there was an almost tangible silence.Only the sound of the surf on the coast, the steady murmur of the ocean far out, and the wind, in gusts.The two men let out the sounding line over the edge of the proa.The Binongko stood up (the guards let him), he spoke some words--repeated the same ones, it seemed--no one understood him except the one police guard but he paid no attention.
Nobody paid attention.Nobody listened--but they all looked at him.The two under the roof, the rowers on each side of the proa, the two with the sounding lead worked on the line but they looked at him too, and so did the guards.
The garden of the Ten Thousand Things however, is not like Eden, for together with the beguiling casuarina trees of the singing branches and the long dropping needles, there are ghosts.This is the first of the two novels written by Maria Dermoût (1888-1962).
For the uncanny remains.If gardens are fertile ground, if they are bordered by the sea and frame the inner bays, then not just flowers, but shells from the water will colonize the earthy grounds.
Or take them away, like a dagger.A garden with a Thousand Things, attended by people who could also become more things, if deprived of their soul.
Apart from the thematic similarities and soulful writing, it’s the panorama of a scenic as well as a sinister place that governs the telling of various events by Rulfo and Dermoût, but as I went along it became evident that ‘The Ten Thousand Things’ had a bigger plan for me.
The garden held her, slowly enveloped her, showed her things, whispered her its secrets...The history, as is normally the case with every place which has stories advancing from its every nook and corner, is dense here but never inaccessible.
World and time, so long as human muddies up the lines in hasty life and mortal unease, needs condense.
Beauty in the failed effort to save a life, yes yes.
Beauty in the jewels and shells and cultured stone, yes yes.
Beauty in the mizzen sails, small and sailing jewels across in fluttered thousands, across the blue and green and boundless light of ocean bright, yes yes.
And there, within all those number of things, lies the disparate cords of humanity and all its discordant strains across world and time, woven into, what?What else?
Wonderful, magical book, unlike anything I've read before.
Set in Indonesia; peopled by Dutch and Indonesian, the living and the dead; following a narrative path of its own through the physical world, the natural world, the spiritual world to tell such stories...difficult to describe as they are truly singular.
This book must be experienced.I envisioned writing a longer review but at the moment inspiration is lacking and I will leave it here.
This is highly recommended to all who are not intimidated by magical realism and a touch of the mystical.
This is a wonderful book.
For a more in depth discussion, I suggest reading Kris' review at https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...What a joy for my first completed book of 2016.
It is a mess, but it is a beautiful mess.
I feel the book but I don't know what it is saying exactly.
That is the best kind.
The structure is unconventional; reading it, I had no idea how to read it, which is a nice feeling: it is the feeling of reading the very first novel.
And then there are the things from the title, the imbued significance (though, thankfully, not symbolism) of things, the aura and magic, the legends and rumors, the history and narrative: the things that compose a life.
The Ten Thousand Things is a slow atmospheric story which rewards patience and a slow lingering over the sparse detail. It is a story less of things that are now, but of things which have long ago passed away.
The "Small Garden" at the Inner Bay, a picturesque place where the views, the smells, sounds and colours, "held her, slowly enveloped her, showed her things, whispered her its secrets..." It is a place where time can stand still, where past and present and future, perhaps?, can fuse into one unifying image.
Dutch writer Maria Dermoût has created an extraordinary novel in which she paints landscape, atmosphere and characters so beautifully that you want to learn more about her, the people and the island.
At the same time, she weaves into the fabric of her overall portrayal of Felicia and the Garden other people's stories from nearby places.
First published at http://www.meexia.com/bookie/2016/01/...In The Ten Thousand Things Maria Dermoût brought us to my birth country, Indonesia.
Just things you wouldn't learn in school's history books :).I was born in the capital, and never left the island of Java for the first 17 years of my life.
It gave me nostalgic feelings as indeed where ever you are in Indonesia you are never far from the ocean.The main character that holds all the stories together in the book is referred to as the Lady of the Small Garden, who is from a Dutch family but born in Moluccas.
A Vigil for All the Murdered She knew that a bay and rocks and trees bending over the surf cannot relieve sadness—can sadness be relieved, or can one only pass it by, very slowly? In my reading over the past decade, I have really come to trust the reissues of the New York Review of Books—works of fiction, predominantly foreign, that have undeservedly slipped out of circulation. They do for older literature what the Europa Press does for contemporary: open the reader's eyes to a wide range of geo
On one of these, on the Inner Bay, lives a widow, an old Dutch settler, known as "The Lady of the Small Garden." She has a grand-daughter, Felicia, who grows up among the plants, shells, and animal life of the bay, an idyllic childhood full of discovery and imagination.
Full, too, of the imagination of others: the beliefs of the island people, the visits of the old Bibi selling objects with special powers, the collections in her grandmother's curiosity cabinet, and the ghosts of three little girls in pink who died long ago on the same day.The book's presiding spirit is the 17th-century German Dutch botanist Georg Eberhard Rumphius, who first classified the plants of the Indonesian archipelago, but also published a book of curiosities which is as speculative as his herbiary was scientific.
The most immersive moments that I found myself deep inside of were: when Pauline draws the knife, the drumbeat of the proa rowers, Felicia's thoughts on what she will teach her son, the policeman's discovery of the professor's things beneath the four men, and grandma's appearance when Felicia first arrives.
I loved the linking of the murder victims together, the deep dives into folklore and storytelling, and the airy, dreamy feel of the prose.
For the most part, it keeps the story flowing gently onward though there are occasional sentences that are tough to read.Themes: loss, grief, death, Indonesia, folklore, nature, women, colonialism, family
I kept waiting for characters to care about, the much lauded magic and description to draw me in, some sort of coherent story.
This is a story set in Indonesia without much (any?) agency on the part of actual Indonesians.
This is a Dutch expat story set in a place where the Dutch held sway for a very long time.
Such stories are always risky, in my book, unless they fully engage with the underlying reality of exploitation.
This is a romanticized account of what was probably a painful history and I have read excellent histories.
Mostly set on one of the islands in the Maluccas, or Spice Islands, in a place called the Small Garden (not so small!) the ancient matriarch (not so old!) of a Dutch family lives alone with the most lovely things: antique cabinets full of special shells, gold pins, a "little cat's-eye for dreams" a "gold apple, carved out in fretwork, with a ball of amber inside which she had made herself," spices, and curiosities like the "snake with the carbuncle stone." Her granddaughter Felicity is the recipient of her wisdom, but she is forced to Europe by her parents, who have little attachment to the island.
I don't want to write about the plot, because that would be giving away too much; but after I finished the book, I read Hans Koning's beautiful introduction and discovered that Maria Dermout's son had died in a Japanese concentration camp.
This is a series of related stories, set on the island of Ambon (Spice Islands, Indonesia, at the time of Dutch East India).
The Small Garden of the setting, which goes back to at least Felicia's Grandmother in the story is in Inner Bay. It's a natural paradise of a sorts, and the people there have a belief in animism wherein plants and animals have souls and one must know what things mean for her/his own safety.
Thus, the story returns to the Inner Bay of the Small Garden, wherein an older Felicia imagines another of her get-togethers of several murdered characters.
The publisher description probably says it best: The Ten Thousand Things is a novel of shimmering strangeness—the story of Felicia, who returns with her baby son from Holland to the Spice Islands of Indonesia, to the house and garden that were her birthplace, over which her powerful grandmother still presides. There Felicia finds herself wedded to an uncanny and dangerous world, full of mystery and violence, where objects tell tales, the dead come and go, and the past is as potent as the present
The Ten Thousand Things is a novel of shimmering strangeness—the story of Felicia, who returns with her baby son from Holland to the Spice Islands of Indonesia, to the house and garden that were her birthplace, over which her powerful grandmother still presides.
I liked getting into the more minor stories and characters, particularly the man who lived with the four women and the dangerous sailor with the very sharp knife.
Kind of spooky, and difficult to discern reality from fantasy.For someone reading a book for a feeling of a place, this is more of a Dutch-Empire Indonesia, but still very descriptive of the scenery and senses.
Written in her 60s, Dermout is no doubt relaying herself through Felicia who returns to the small island of her birth in the Moluccas during the early 20th century.There is great love of the land, sea and people in this story as Felicia learns and then teaches her son the ten thousand things that go to make up their island.
But the sadness it through who trying to make sense of the various murders past and current that have occurred and what is meant to the people who had their lives cut short - including her own son.There is no violence in the book, only the poetic and calm style conveying the sadness of what has been lost.Memorising.
This is a strange little novel that very nearly has a plot. I had to reach the final page before I figured out that the entire book is a study of loss. It takes place in the Moluccas (Spice Islands) near the end of Dutch colonial rule. Much of what happens parallels the author's life, and the book almost feels like a cathartic exercise rather than a novel. It's slow going, relying almost entirely on expository narration, but the author's powers of description are impressive.
Ambon, Maluku, IndonesiaA very peculiar story.First a little background on the author: Maria Dermout was born in 1888 in a small town in Java (Dutch East Indies, which now is Indonesia).
Dermout returned to the Netherlands for her education and after getting married, she and her husband moved back to the Dutch East Indies and lived all across Java and the Moluccas (now Maluku).
Life goes on; Felicia and her grandmother try to make the best out of the situation.
I really enjoyed getting a glimpse into life in the Dutch East Indies, which has completely vanished now.
Rather than Pasternak and Capote, the writer who “The Ten Thousand Things” evokes most is the Faulkner of “Absalom, Absalom”, with its decaying families in decrepit mansions, its characters who destroy themselves at the intersection of ambition and illusion.
In lieu of Thomas Sutpen fleeing his mixed-race wife in the French West Indies, in “The Ten Thousand Things” we meet Felicia, come home to the Dutch East Indies without either and explanation or her swindler of a husband.
The title comes from a Taoist characterization of the material world, and, despite the lush prose and attentiveness to flora, the novel takes place in a transitory, impermanent realm.
You get to carry a book around with you, you see, and you get to read it in between doing other things, and sometimes these other things (whatever they are) are very happy or very sad or just very, in some way, and then always afterward (not always but for a while) you get to take it off the shelf and dust it a bit and sigh wistfully and then put it back on the shelf.
This was a very lovely novel, magical realism (ugh, sorry, sorry, you know what I mean, a book with impossible activities not organized along usual genre lines) set in Dutch Indonesia, every little bit of this beautiful and sad and strange.
A lovely book, that I think will stay with me always. The book does so much in not very many pages. There are plenty of interesting characters, well drawn with few strokes. And the natural world is so beautifully described, and such a presence. It's a character on its own. So much atmosphere, so many moments perfectly captured. I was happy to find Rumphius'  The Ambonese Curiosity Cabinet  in my library. Well worth checking out if you read this book, for then you can find pictures of the Amoret

The Ambonese Curiosity Cabinet
Well worth checking out if you read this book, for then you can find pictures of the Amoret Harp, the little duck crabs, a photo of Rumphius' house on Ambon, and much more.
Many pages stood up to, and demanded, a slow, savoring reading. The opening pages, the end of Suprato's story, and parts of the conclusion were especially wonderful. Dermout can offer a precise and loving image of plants, shells, and jellyfish; evoke ghosts that are almost but not quite visible; and suggest depths of feeling with an understatement. However, parts of the novel were less engaging, more vague and romanticized.
Pero también están aquellas cosas que hacen parte de un lugar, de la historia: el mar, el viento, los jardines; los peces y las conchas, los pájaros y las semillas.
Y los fantasmas, los mitos, y los lugares en que confluyen.Las diez mil cosas es una novela sobre muchas cosas.
Para Felicia, «La dama del Pequeño Jardín», uno de estos recuerdos es su hijo.
Felicia procura ejercitar su memoria a través de una ofrenda: un día al año se dedica a recordar a los muertos de aquella isla tan hermosa en la que vive.
It tells the story of The Lady of the Small Garden, who lives on an island that grows spices and takes care of her family's garden.
All of the characters in this book reach a sort of mythical status as their stories are retold by the people on the island.
This isn't a page turner with a quick paced plot, but the language is beautiful and by the end you feel like you've become an inhabitant of the island and want to pass on its stories.
Ethereal. Poetic. Beautifully rendered lament of loss that celebrates life.
I can't believe how overlooked this book is. Simply captivating.

The reader rides along with Felicity as she experiences a tug of war with pain, loss, love, acceptance and guilt.
Very poignant story especially when you discover Maria Dermo��t suffered her own personal loss, making the story even more touching and halting.
A beautifully written story telling a heartbreaking story of one woman's unbearable loss and love.
And then I let go and went with it.Each time I was reading in this book, I felt transported to another place, in the way of many good books.
In this case, though, I could not now really describe the place I went to, except that the little waves come in in threes -- father, mother, child -- and we can sense the ghosts there, although we never see them.
We experience moments and events with a slight detachment -- we are not really there, but the others are there, like little Himpies standing with his friend Domingoes, or Himpies's mother and his great-grandmother, or the old Arab woman who brings her mysterious herbs and pearls to them.
