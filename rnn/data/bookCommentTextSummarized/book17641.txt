I had heard a lot of fantastic things about this series the first time I went through The Way of Kings and Words of Radiance last year, but I read through them many years after their original release dates.
In fact, there is so much plot progression in Oathbringer that it makes both The Way of Kings and Words of Radiance‚Äìas epic and majestic as they are already‚Äîfeel like a preparation for this book alone.
We have seen Kaladin‚Äôs past in The Way of Kings, Shallan‚Äôs in Words of Radiance, and finally, it‚Äôs time for Dalinar‚Äôs.
‚ô•PART ONE ~ UNITED ~ DALINAR * SHALLAN * KALADIN * ADOLINI'm going to do a series of excerpts from each person.

Honestly, id didn't seem to matter to Palona that Shallan was a storming Knight Radiant now, she'd still mother her all the--Adolin stepped in, carrying a large plate of food in one hand, some books under the other arm.
skip some...."Anyway," Shallan said.
"I found Adolin!" "I see that, " Shallan said.
***"I gave you people an order," Kaladin said.
Satisfying because this book was absolutely astonishing in every way that I expected it to be.
All I can say is that this series is looooooooooooong and can be rough to get through at times, but it is so satisfying to read and if you have read some of Sanderson's other books in the Cosmere universe, then Oathbringer will blow your mind with how complex it is within the Cosmere and how it all relates.
Anyhow, Oathbringer is astonishing in a mind-blowing way.
Absolutely worth the wait and one of the most memorable books I have read this year.
Part 2 was watered by too many unnecessary PoVs. Part 3 was watered by too many sub-plots and not enough interaction between characters.
Kaladin also didn‚Äôt get a PoV in the second part; instead we have various Bridge Four narrators.
Those new Kaladin flashbacks were unnecessary, we already have chapters upon chapters on Dalinar‚Äôs flashbacks, can Brandon not make a third of the book about the past, please?
Especially when simultaneously trying to have thousand things happen in the present, too.Shallan continues her personality split, which initially didn‚Äôt bother me much, but I hoped we‚Äôd be done with that by the end of the book.
ugh the wait will be so long
Words of Radiance was easily the best book I've ever read, which naturally resulted in some pretty high expectations going into Oathbringer.
Sanderson has completely smashed all expectations by offering yet another best book I've ever read.
Admittedly, I did wish for my favourite character of the series (and possibly of all-time) to have more presence in this instalment, but I accept that this might not always be the case given that the story is not going to centre around one main character (as much as it might seem to be in the past two books).

With the holidays and the start of this new year, my life has just been a little hectic to write a review that does this amazing book and series justice!
I know I won‚Äôt say anything major, but please use caution, or maybe pass on my review, if you would like to start The Way of Kings completely blind.
And even though I personally feel like these are the main three, there are so many amazing characters in this world.
ALL. THE. STARS.  RTC.
Still, I suppose there was some beauty in these flashback chapters, especially when Adolin was born and we got to see Dalinar react to becoming a father, but ultimately there is a lot more pain than happiness in these past sequences, and some of the terrible and heartbreaking events covered the final few flashbacks damn near broke me.Of course, Oathbringer being ‚ÄúDalinar‚Äôs book‚Äù notwithstanding, Sanderson also pays plenty of attention to the other characters, developing the roles of Kaladin, Shallan, Adolin, and even those of a number of important supporting figures besides, including a few I can‚Äôt name for fear of revealing too much.
Most are pretty okay and I can slog through and eventually enjoy certain ones like GoT all right, but a few really manage to jump right out there and grab you with character, world-building, and overall story with heart, rage, heartache, and amazeballs reveals that are about as far away from the usual as you can get but still slam you with the reality and inevitability.
I think I'll always love her and all her split personalities.But even though we think we've learned a lot of things about the ultra-honorable Dalinar and we're satisfied with the fact that he's bonded with the Stormfather himself, the reveals regarding his missing memory is kinda shocking, to say the least.
I can't help thinking that some of Dalinar's sections bored me though.
Talking to Wit is always charming, crazy and interesting, Shallan's progression was really well described and intriguing, Bridge Four essentially turning into flying superheroes, and I liked a couple of the fable-like past stories that were presented to add depth to this already deep and monstrously detailed world.
The magic's still brilliant as is normally the way in Sanderson books and as the Radiants and others get used to there powers it seems like the possibilities could be endless if the mysterious capabilities are in the right hands.
(view spoiler)[Shallan's personal storyline actually really freaked me out.
(view spoiler)[I love him a Shallan so much together!
(hide spoiler)] And Wit, but I don't think that needs saying.I didn't reread the first two books before jumping into this one, because that would have taken months, and I was reading other things.
Similarly, I want to reread Mistborn 4-6 before The Lost Metal comes out and a bunch more of his books before they get sequels.
That's just stunning, can't wait to get my hands on it!---------------I'm extremely excited about this book and my sister knows that, so she did a thing.
I kid you not, my head is still pounding from the lack of sleep.ü§ïAs the fates of our leads were hanging on by a thread (a very thin one, mind you), the shocking revelations that came to light and the things I DID NOT see coming which kept hitting me from every direction sent me on a wave of emotions I didn‚Äôt even know I had.
One minute I'm at the edge of my seat, eyes wide open over what I‚Äôd just read, terrified of what‚Äôd come next (after Mistborn, I learned never to trust Sanderson with my beloveds.
good people end up doing some completely messed up shit.
However, that‚Äôs not to say that I didn‚Äôt miss certain things from the past two books.
Sanderson makes it work because his characters are, by and large, sufficiently compelling that you‚Äôre okay hanging out with them for extended periods of time where just tweezing nose hairs and Q-tipping out some earwax* while they banter, but there are multiple stretches in the book where I found myself feeling like I was at the part of a Def Leppard concert at the County Fair where they go, ‚ÄúAnd now we want to play you something off our brand new album!‚Äù and everyone goes to the bathroom so they can get back in time for the closing Rocket/Hysteria/Pour Some Sugar on Me triptych.
I don‚Äôt want to pee when I‚Äôm reading Sanderson (I mean, I know I NEED to pee at some point over the course of the 1,200+ pages, but you know what I mean).
**UPDATE 10/21/18: Yes, rereading this already.....****UPDATE: Because ever since I read this book it has completely wrecked me from making significant progress on anything else. It's the sign of a great book when a month and three other books can pass, and your mind is still trapped by this one. Read at your own risk üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠.**  ‚ÄúThe question is not whether you will love, hurt, dream, and die. It is what you will love, why you will hurt, when you will dream, and how you will die. This is your choi
Really - seriously - this book was amazing, in so many different ways, but it's not just the great world building, epic plot, and compelling characters that would make me recommend this book or this series.
I remember being in one of my insurance classes, reading my huge hard cover of Words of Radiance during every break that we had, and it took me literally two months to finish it because I was still taking my regular online classes as well.And then there's this book.
This will probably always be my favorite series of all time because of this.*cough* Okay, now that my emotional dump is finished, I'll say a few more technical things about this book.
I‚Äôve always loved the characters in this series, but I think Oathbringer is the first book I‚Äôve also appreciated their complexity/duality.
There were a few new characters that got to share the limelight in Oathbringer (brought in from the interludes in previous books) and I delighted in how they changed the dynamics of the story.If I‚Äôm honest, I‚Äôll admit that there were a few moments throughout Oathbringer where I wondered if the pacing was a little too slow (keeping in mind that I didn‚Äôt have a single issue with pacing for the first two 1000+ page novels).
"Having power is a terrible burden, the worst thing imaginable, except for every other alternative." Power and its burden seems to be a major theme in Oathbringer, which features a number of exciting and frustrating developments in its 1200 pages. (The most frustrating revelation of all is the fact that we will be waiting until 2020 at least for the fourth installment.)Every Stormlight Archive volume is a character study of a different Knight Radiant; first Kaladin, then Shallan, and now Dalina
What‚Äôs more, constant flashbacks to the mind of the Blackthorn did not detract at all from Dalinar‚Äôs plotline in the present, as I sometimes felt was the case with Shallan in Words of Radiance.Kaladin faces bigger challenges than ever before in this book; his Windrunner ideals are rocked badly when he once again faces that, in a war, you cannot protect everyone, even if both sides are right in some way.
I was obviously disappointed, not so much that things didn‚Äôt pan out the way I would have liked, but rather that Branderson spent SO MUCH TIME building up their relationship in Words of Radiance that I ended book 3 feeling vaguely cheated.
When I read Words of Radiance, it supplanted its predecessor, which I find to be incredibly rare for a second book in a series.
His past is both fascinating and incredibly disturbing.However, as with the preceding books, Dalinar is far from the only perspective we receive.
I love the Ideals Sanderson has created here, as I think they make for incredibly powerful words to live by for both character and reader.
It‚Äôs about accepting that life is hard and imperfect and unfair and embracing it anyway."Accept the pain, but don't accept that you deserved it."This book moved me.
*screams for eternity over this wonderfully glorious cover* This book will end my life.I expect to have a heart attack after finishing this.Counting the days until release in November..
Soo I just saw that there are going to be ten books in this series. Ten? 10?! TEN?!! So, what you're telling me is that I'm going to be in my mid 40's before I get to see the end of this story... damn
This surprised me a little because I really thought I‚Äôd see Adolin struggling with the events at the end of Word of Radiance but I guess not.I ADORE Dalinar, he is one of my favorite written characters of all time and it was hard to see him as The Blackthorn and reconcile them as the same man.
Good thing I got to know Dalinar first since that other guy could have ruined our love.Some of the things I liked the most are that I‚Äôm always surprised in a Sanderson book.

March 2014: Wait, what? 2015? Brandon just published Words of Radiance, and he is giving us Skybreaker a year and maybe some later? So soon? I got so used to waiting on Martin that I can hardly believe how efficient Brandon it.
Review for Way of Kings Review for Words of Radiance No surprise here that a Stormlight book clocks in at 5 stars. I think this book really establishes Sanderson as THE preeminent epic fantasy writer of our day (and I will Internet fight you if you disagree). Before diving into spoilery analysis of the book let me say this was on level with the previous two books: amazing world building (natch), nuanced character development, wonderful story punctuated by excellent plot twists, and a weaving to
Sanderson's deft touch merges these two threads together seamlessly to deliver a pivotal and emotional story arc.In fact that seems to be the theme among most of the major characters, they are all, in their own way, broken.
Granted the coming Desolation will likely be a fight for species survival (though who knows, Sanderson has pulled plenty of quick ones on the readers before), the Fused will likely disproportionately benefit from any eventual Parshendi victory.All in all Oathbringer upped the Stormlight game on many levels: story, world building, character development.
And due to all this, I believe the best way for me to summarize my feelings about Oathbringer is to merely say it is one of the most magnificent fantasy books I‚Äôve ever read and leave it at that.For those unfamiliar with ,The Stormlight Archive, it ‚Äì like so many epic fantasy series ‚Äì is centered upon the coming end of the world, as the cyclical Desolation Event comes upon the world of Roshar once again.
When there‚Äôs humor it‚Äôs super corny - I‚Äôm just waiting for Shallan to find a ‚Äúclever‚Äù way to refer to herself as a (view spoiler)["semi-Kholin" after her marriage to Adolin har har ;;; (hide spoiler)] - although I did love Pattern acting as chaperone.
That way if you miss, at least your arrow will fall far away, and the person it kills will likely be someone you don't know.
I‚Äôll be honest, I think a lot of the reason I struggle with her is because I don‚Äôt like Kate Reading‚Äôs voicing of her (or Pattern, uggghh).
Inner-cover artwork from OATHBRINGER (b/c Tor sent me a final copy of the book for review):(view spoiler)[ (hide spoiler)] <‚Äî ‚Äî not really a spoiler, but I tagged it anyway, just in cases someone doesn‚Äôt want to see the artwork before the actual book is in their hands.My other reviews for this series: The Way of Kings (The Stormlight Archive, #1)  Words of Radiance (The Stormlight Archive #2) ["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>
I think at times this book outshined its predecessors it terms of action, suspense, unforeseen reveals and especially character development.
Dalinar, Kaladin and Shallan who have been the big three to this point in the series all grew and yet were shown to have even greater flaws.
I think it's a bit of quibbling since compared to everything else out there this was definitely a 5* effort but much like in my other favorite series there's the 5* and then there's the beyond 5* books that truly need their own category.
Life before deathStrength before weaknessJourney before destination   N.B spoiler free review, wrote this immediately after reading the book so might edit for errors and to add some things I forgot.I know the year just started but I think this is going to be my best read of the year. I storming love everything about this book, its a 1000+ pages and I still feel as if its not enough. 2020 please come sooner cause I'd love to know how this continues.To say that I love this book is an understateme
