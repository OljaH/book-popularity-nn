(B+) 76% | GoodNotes: It’s the best of the series, but like the rest, an otherwise fine story is spoiled by a chaotic, poorly-written closing battle.
I wanted to see some profound acts of selflessness and boy did I ever.
I'll hand it to Stroud, he stayed true to his style the whole way through.
Not even a goodbye kiss, and I think that stung most of all.No happy endings, at least, not in the typical way, either.
And as is the way of the living, any brush with death, even fictional, has a tendency to leave a somber shadow.
Though it's decidedly soured my taste for acts of heroism in all forms.
Sort of like how I imagine the pain of silver might feel to a djinn's essence.
In this book, Bartimaeus, Nathaniel (John Mandrake) and Kitty are back.
Kitty had been working as an assistant to a magician in order to gain knowledge on Bartimaeus and his past.
As Kitty works to unravel his mysteries, Nathaniel is busy with the war effort but is met with opposition from many ends.
As he questions his loyalties, Kitty is put to the test of drawing 'demon' and human closer together.This book had a much more mature viewpoint and style.
THIS ENDING is seriously one of the best I've ever read... it gets me every time.I remember wishing the Harry Potter series would end the sam way aaaaand I still stand by that. Otherwise I think I liked this series a bit more in middle school, but it was fun to go back and remember parts!
Throughout the trilogy we have followed Nathanial (the human who becomes a magician), Bartimaeus the Jinni, and Kitty a girl in the resistance.
If you're a parent be sure that your "youth" has a good reality concept and is mature enough for a story that turns somewhat dark at times.**** SPOILER ALERT SPOILER BELOW ****The end of this book took me by complete surprise...and that doesn't happen much anymore.
As the evil demon closes in and Nathanial needs to break the staff, he dismisses Bartimaeus, breaks the staff and dies.
Ptolemy's Gate (Bartimaeus, #3), Jonathan Stroud, C2005Ptolemy's Gate is a children's novel of alternate history, fantasy and magic.
It is the third book in the Bartimaeus trilogy, written by British author Jonathan Stroud.
Characters: Bartimaeus, Kathleen "Kitty" Jones, Nathanielتاریخ نخستین خوانش: از هشتم ماه مارس تا بیست و پنجم ماه مارس سال 2014 معنوان: دروازه ی پتولمی؛ اثر: جاناتان استرود؛ برگردان: محمد قصاع؛ نشر: تهران، افق، 1391، در 760 ص، فروست: رمان نوجوان؛ ۸9، رمانهای سه‌ گانه‌ ی بارتیمیوس‏؛ 3، شابک: 9789643697525؛ موضوع: داستان‌های نوجوانان از نویسندگان انگلیسی -- قرن 21 مبسیار خواندنی ست، حتما پیشنهاد میکنم بخوانید.
Having now finished the entire trilogy, I can say that this ranks in my top 5 "All Time" YA fantasy series ever.
After loving the first book, The Amulet of Samarkand, I was a little disappointed in the second volume, The Golem's Eye, for reasons set out in my review.
Turns out that each one of my gripes about the second volume were dealt with beautifully in this story.
Bartimaeus is one of the most unique "voices" in fantasy literature over the past 10 years and I hope to read more stories with him in the near future.
war was never any good, they had to settle everything that destroyed, Nathaniel had pay the government faults, Bartimaeus learned to trust a boy who had been an annoying master and a girl who risked her life for them, and the fact that Kitty had to face her life after the tragedy that followed her.I slightly liked tragedy, and this series had the best ending I've ever read.by the way, I heard Jonathan Stroud will release a prequel book about Ptolemy and Bartimaues in November.
With secrets from Bartimaeus's past, we get a window peek at The Other Place, and a slowly changing relationship between the three characters, this book is by far the greatest ending to the trilogy.
Something interesting about Stroud's style of writing for this series, which was separating the narration between all three main characters, I find that what he creates is a perfect balance.
By doing so, Stroud has created a more personal bond with Bartimaeus than with the humans.
By creating a bond with the deamon, we see the faults in Nathaniel and the things that make Kitty special and different.
There I was, reading along all cheerily, thinking "what a great, funny series!" fully expecting a happily ever after.
I cried for an hour straight after the last page of this book.
I couldn't forget the wonderful characters, the magical world they lived in, the humour (Bartimaeus was possibly the funniest being I've ever come across in fiction), the way they grew up, the realisations, the heartbreak, the sacrifices.
And I just couldn't bring myself to hate it, no matter how much thinking about it made me cry.I can never read this series again.
Idealistic, feisty Kitty Jones seeks to educate the commoners about the limitations of magic, and the truth behind their oppression.
She seeks a way for commoners and demons to combine forces, to overthrow the magicians.This novel is the third in the Bartimaeus trilogy.
This is not easy, as magicians look upon demons as "slaves", commoners look upon magicians as oppressive overlords, and demons look at all humans with disdain, and sometimes even with hatred.As with the first two books, I listened to this one as an audiobook, narrated by Simon Jones.

پایانی غمناک و زیبا...اولین کتابی که باهاش گریه کردم :")
من که معتقدم الان زوده واسه نظر گذاشتن چون تاثیرشو کامل روم نذاشته ولی به دو علت الان ریویو میذارم : 1.
الان تو تب و تاب داستان هستم و همیشه هم غریضه آدم میگه که چه کتابی خوبه کودوم بهتره و ازین حرفا .اخطار !
اخطار !
درسته واضح نیست ولی اسپویله .
گریهههه 😭😭😭😭 یعنی دیگه آخرش ، هم اشکمو در اورد هم عرقمو .
اون دو صفحه آخر هم رسیده بودم به یه آهنگی که باعث شد از اعماق وجودم ، ورود به یه دنیای جدید رو حس کنم ؛ دنیای جاناتان استرود 😢توصیفات فوق العاده ، کمدی و طنز تلخ ، بیان مفاهیم در غالب فانتزی و خیلی چیزای دیگه که قابل بیان نیستن .
NO.LYS GO HIDE IN A CORNER.
"I want to see what you think of the ending"By now I should know that when Lys says that, I'm going to suffer.
And it was a fitting and beautiful ending but...but, my heart is crushed, broken in little pieces!
T.TIt's kind of pointless to talk about the plot, because I don't want to spoil the series for anyone.
I loved Bartimaeus (Barty :3) and Nathaniel.
I've always liked Kitty's character but I've never loved her part in the story.
To me, this series will always be about Bartimaeus and Nathaniel and no one else.
Saya jadi berasa kenal dekat dengan sosok Barti.Atau bisa jadi juga karena membaca ketiga buku ini, saya dapat merasakan pertumbuhan masing-masing karakter plus juga gejolak commoner, penyihir, demon yang kian gelap dan kian menegangkan.Nat, dari seorang bocah pemalu namun juga keras kepala bisa menjadi pemuda gagah yang ambisius dan dingin.Kitty, gadis keras kepala yang semakin lama semakin terang auranya plus sifat kolerisnya itu lho, saya ikutan takut kalo doi sudah mulai bentak-bentak, hihi.Barti, oh barti, siapa yang tak bakal jatuh hati dengan jin satu ini, walau berubah bentuk jadi kodok dan piramida berlendir ia tetap bisa membuat saya tertawa.Salut dengan mas Jonathan Stroud, pengembangan karakter, plot dan ending yang luar biasa di buku ketiga ini.
Endingnya, walau sudah tau dari beberapa tahun yang lalu tetep bikin saya bolak balik halaman terakhir.
And towards the end i was so proud that he was becoming such a wonderful person,i even hoped following this Kitty and him could be involved romantically, they had some sparks between them, but then JS had to do the inevitable, he took my beloved (cheesily feels for a character)just as he began living.
As his demise neared all i wanted to do was tell Mandrake i loved him, no joke, no one deserves to die without hearing those words told with sincerity.
SO there it is, Ptolemy and Mandrake my lovelies.
This books is the final installment in the Bartimaeus trilogy, and arguably the most unique and satisfying conclusion I've ever read in any story.
ALthough Mandrake always carried a piece of Nathaniel somewhere deep down, it wasn't until this final book did that identity completely crumble.
Again, this is not your typical ending to an epic hero story.
By renewing the bond Bartimaeus treasured so dearly, Nathaniel had rekindled the possibility of a harmonious existence between humans and spirits.
No review could do this trilogy justice, you really need to read it yourself to understand.
Amazing book. Not Perfect, but amazing nonetheless...The transformations of the characters, the plot, the storytelling, the battles, the culmination, the ends, they're just great!In average, the trilogy got 4 stars from me.
آخراش هم هر وقت کیتی و بارتیمیوس ناتانیل صداش می کردن ذوق می کردم :-"آخرش، ولی ناتانیل خودش رو فدا کرد و مرد، خیلی ناراحت شدم و اینا، ولی بیشترش به خاطر این نبود که حالا مرده.
خیلی عالی ساخته شده بود همه چیزش توی این کتاب...
مگه گتلین بد بود خب؟ :|پتولمی :(( حرفی ندارم واقعا...داستان بعضی جاها مثل فصل های گذشته ی کیتی توی کتاب قبل می شد، یه کوچولو خسته کننده، ولی بدون اون ها یه خط داستانی منسجم و پیوسته داشت.بارتیمیوس مثل همیشه مزه نمی ریخت :-" البته بیشترش به خاطر اینه که من این آخرش بد دپرس شدم ولی خب :-"+ این اواخرش خیلی کشش داشت.
Its taken me almost two years to read this trilogy and honestly the only thing keeping me going was the fact that a friend recommended these to me and I couldn't not read them...
(Switching to the audio halfway through book two also really helped, Steven Pacey does a great job!)Nathaniel's a twat and its nice for a change that characters don't easily and miraculously change, once a twat always a twat!
And Bartimaeus, I am going to miss him.
Was never really a fan of Kitty, but she had a nice part in this installment.
I'm hugging the book. It's not fair. Cries. Review to come, if I can ever properly formulate my feelings for these characters.
Hearing this beautifully written novel by Jonathan Stroud read by Simon Jones is a delight, its considerable literary content expertly leavened with laugh out loud humor and dazzling prose. I liked this series! Listening to an audiobook is still new to me but, having heard the previous two, I looked forward to saving this one for a series of long drives.
This is by far, the best book ive read the whole year and possibly one of the best in my entire life.
I havent felt like this about a book for almost a year.Let me start from the very beginning.
I have no problems with it and personally think its perfect :DAlso, this is basically me when I was reading the second to the last page till the very end:This is me when I had the idea of what is going to happen:Then I became like this when it really did happen:Then thisAnd out of sheer coincidence, it began to rain (its crazy!
Its like the universe knows how I felt deep down inside) so I became:
sooo verrrry borrreddd.
Я не маю бажання читати спін-офф про Соломона, бо історія Бартімеуса, ІМХО, завершена річ у собі.
З екшончиком, ясна річ."Трилогія Бартімеуса" не вчить вас дружбі або любові, не нав’язує вам ніяких моральних цінностей.
Суспільна мораль - сумнівна, а суспільне схвалення зі славою абощо - повна маячня.Маст-рід.(view spoiler)[ СТРАУД, КУРВО, ПРОСТО ТАК ВЗЯВ ТА ВЗІРВАВ ГОЛОВНОГО ПЕРСОНАЖА "ДИТЯЧОЇ" КНИЖКИ!
Цей фінальний штрих навіть не є основною причиною його полюбити, бо ця ідея в нього перетікає із книжки у книжку, від битви за Прагу до стогонів болю під ногами Рамутри.
Якщо відкрили цей спойлер так і не прочитавши трилогії: то читайте!
U sve tri knjige Straud pravi problem, a onda taj problem provlači kroz čitavu knjigu gdje se u više navrata koprca u prazno što je razlog zašto sam malo i otegao ovaj posljednji dio.
Neka se i varam, ali sve mi se čini da nije ovo tek tako tinejdžerska fantazija koja deklamuje tek neku napisanu priču.
Njegove političke i špijunske intrige su oštre, pripovjedanje je dosta kritičkog karaktera, a likovi oličenje zdepaste naravi.
Likovi su predstavljeni da ih prezirete jer triologija uključuje onu 'Rat svih protiv svih'.
Ono što je isto karakteristično jeste što se glavni likovi ne podnose međusobno.
The third and final book in The Bartimaeus Sequence was amazing.
The writing and plot picked up from book 2 (The Golem's Eye. Review >> Here).
The story arcs of every character in the novel were dealt with meticulous perfection and as a reader I am completely satisfied.
Bartimaeus has a beautiful and painful back story which I loved reading about.
Kitty was the true hero in the story.
The story came a full circle in the end, what with Nat becoming Nat once again, and Bartimaeus experiencing some serious dèja vû, making me better appreciate the first book (The Amulet of Samarkand.

I wanted to know more about the rest of the characters; I wanted to know what will happen between Nathaniel and Kitty, and ultimately I needed to know the answers to many questions I had about the history of Bartimaeus.Overall reading experienceThe book had a slow start due to many flashbacks, which were fun, but once they got settled I couldn't put the book down.
