Απολαυστικά συγκινητικό και ευχάριστα κωμικό σε αρκετά σημεία με γρήγορη εξέλιξη και τοσο ενδιαφέρουσα υπόθεση που δεν το αφήνεις πριν το τελειώσεις.
Παρόλο που αυτό το οποίο συμβαίνει στην ιστορία μας και περιγράφεται τοσο όμορφα δεν ειναι επιστημονικά τεκμηριωμένο ούτε κοινώς αποδεκτό, καταφέρνει να πείσει τον αναγνώστη και ίσως ίσως να τον βάλει σε σκέψεις για την αντιμετώπιση ή τα αποτελέσματα ενός τέτοιου συμβάντος αν υποθέσουμε πως ισχύει!!
Η συγγραφέας περιγράφει εξαιρετικά με απίστευτη τρυφερότητα αληθινά συναισθήματα μέσα από οικογενειακες,φιλικές,κοινωνικές και ερωτικες σχέσεις και αντιδράσεις που εχουμε βιώσει ή λαχταράμε να βιώσουμε όλοι.
An Irish woman Joyce has just had a tsunami of troubled times in her life.
An art and architecture freak, he comes to Dublin as a guest lecturer and has to donate his blood just to get in the good books of this gorgeous doctor Sarah.
This blood saves Joyce's life when she has the miscarriage.
After the blood transfusion, Joyce learns Latin and Italian overnight; apart from the great, great knowledge about the Renaissance Paintings and architecture.
:PIt is an amazing, amazing story which would make you laugh and smile through the tears.
But she survived the terrible accident - and now, inexplicably, she can remember faces she has never seen, cobblestone Parisian streets she's never visited.Thanks For The Memories is like a bubble gum, it stretches until it bursts.
And unfortunately my patience stretched and burst with it and then I wasn't interested in what was to happen next, not at all.
I indeed wouldn't mind if Joyce went nuts and killed everyone around her, well, perhaps I would be even glad because it would be more interesting than waiting for her encounter with Justin all the time.And I didn't like Justin, he was sooo selfish and such a pig to Sarah and then there is that odd blood transfusion..
It’s really hard to judge this book by its cover, it is so pretty and the colours are just lovely!Thanks For The Memories by Cecelia Ahern is her fifth book to be published and is definitely my favourite so far.
She follows her heart and finds out what’s behind all of these strange happenings.I really enjoyed this book because I loved the whole idea and concept that Ahern came up with.
With Cecelia Ahern’s other books I didn’t laugh at all, it was more crying related, with Thanks for the Memories I laughed so much.
Thanks for the Memories is a standalone, women's fiction novel written by Cecelia Ahern.
Overall, I thought Thanks for the Memories was fun, sweet, and creative.
But...Ms. Ahern took the slow lane on the highway just to go to the corner store in my opinion.
I had to add a star to my initial 2-star rating because you know it's Cecelia Ahern ♥My favorite quote:“We all get lost once in a while, sometimes by choice, sometimes due to forces beyond our control.
Sometimes we see the way out but wander further and deeper despite ourselves; the fear, the anger or the sadness preventing us returning.
I'm sorry, but what about being completely obliterated as a person ranks as romantic?Even more than my problems with this point of the plot is the fact that, in an attempt to extend the initial mystery of the novel's set up, we spend almost the entire book getting to the "good" bits of any romance - and its not even as if the novel had me in suspense.
About 20 pages in it became obvious what had happened, so I was just wading through wondering when I was going to reach the romantic meeting/ realisation of these characters.In an attempt to not be completely negative, I will say that there were some good secondary characters in this novel (Joyce's dad in particular) and it wasn't an absolute chore to read.
Although I started reading this book and got a reading slump I started reading it all over right from the start and I just finished it today and I totally loved it. *happy dancing*  It was a very interesting story, something that I never heard of, and I didn't expect this at all. I just loved the way that every chapter kept blowing my mind.  It had some little jokes and funny parts that made me smile and laugh,   but sometimes it was a bit annoying like the parts when Joyce's dad kept talking on
but sometimes it was a bit annoying like the parts when Joyce's dad kept talking on how to make "jealous" an old man named Donald, by having a nice trip.
[image error]I gave this book 5/5 stars because it has a beautiful and very mysterious story, it is told in two different perspectives: one from Joyce's and the other one from Justin's, the story never got boring, the author gave lots of information of architecture, art, some info of deja vu, deja vecu and deja senti, some blood donation information,trips and a lot of stuff, and there were a few inspiring quotes like: "I've got the big remote control of life in my hands, and I'm ready to start pushing some buttons." "Sometimes we need all the glue we can get, just to hold ourselves together." "Don't let anybody dictate your speed." "Down I go, falling, then floating,and falling again, I wait for the land of my life." In three words I can say: I loved it.
I loved the diversity of the characters, the pain, the relationships, I laughed until I nearly cried and then I cried when I felt their pain.The story is set mainly in Ireland and in a clever way tells you about a lot of the local architecture.
It also had a touch of fairytale magic in it, yet was more a story about family relationships than romance.So thank you to Cecelia Ahern for a very entertaining book, I will definitely read more of your books now!
Instead, they belong to Justin Hitchcock, a divorced architecture guest lecturer in Dublin.Despite reading several rave reviews of Thanks for the Memories and of the author herself, I was unable to apprehend the book's success.
Second, after much waiting, there was hardly much of a romantic climax per say.
Interestingly, the supporting cast, Joyce's father, proves much more entertaining to read instead.That said, it was characters like this that kept me through the book.
Otherwise, Thanks for the Memories was hardly a chick lit read and only worth an attempt by Ahern's avid fans.For more book reviews, visit  FreshGrads Reads.
”He told me that story way back when I sucked my thumb and when he was as big as an oak tree. When mum’s yawns sounded like songs. When we were all together. When I had no idea there would ever come a time when we wouldn’t be. When we used to have chats in the garden, under the weeping willow. Where I always used to hide and where he always found me. When nothing was impossible and when the three of us, together forever, was a given.” 3.5/5The narrative follows two very different people as thei
After the accident she has a blood transfusion to save her life and suddenly remembers things that have never happened to her, and information she didn't know before.
The pair have never met and yet are magically drawn to one another, due to Justin's blood saving Joyce's life.Both Joyce and Justin have become despondent with their lives; Joyce moves in with her father after the accident and her marriage falls apart.
Justin is divorced and spends most of his time traveling around giving lectures to students that he feels really aren't that interested.
Thanks for the memories is hilarious, moving and sad all at the same time, I've read this book about 4 times now and it never gets old I still find myself giggling when I put it down.I really do highly recommend this book to anyone who needs a little cry and a fun pick me up 😂
I picked up this book because of the blurb on the back that said, "Cecelia Ahern is queen of the modern fairytale." I love fairytales, and I thought that a chick lit book with a fairytale feel would be awesome.But it seems that whoever wrote that blurb has never actually read a fairytale, only knows that they have something to do with magic.
And this book does have one incredibly unlikely magical element, which is already hard to buy into.
The book would be about 50 pages long, if either character had a grain of sense to them.

I had two books with me on my trip to Koh Chang (Elephant Island), and one of them was Thanks for the Memories.
How that happens is a bit out of the ordinary and without giving too much away I can safely say it was quite fun to read as Joyce decided to follow her instincts and walk the path that would eventually take her to Justin.
He has no idea that by giving something from his heart, he may receive the very things he needs to heal it…I have been a long time fan of Cecelia Ahern since her novel P.S. I Love You. I also never miss an episode of her hit show, Samantha Who. Even so, I wondered how good her new novel would be; no one can be so consistently funny, it just doesn’t happened.Well, with Thanks for the Memories, the impossible has indeed happened!
I normally enjoy Cecelia Ahern's books.
Firstly, she writes with elegance, humour and skill; and her books draw you in to a world that is often strange and whimsical, but nonetheless very real and believable.
I liked the sound of this one - the little teasers piqued my interest and I thought 'this sounds good'.
It started well, good character development and scene setting so that I was drawn in very quickly.
I just lost interest or perhaps concern about the characters.
I just did not care what happened to them.
I never do that with books so I am mystified.
Easy, enjoyable read. Fans of Cecelia Ahern would love it.
Joyce's dad is described as having planned his entire life out, yet when they're in London doesn't know how to pack a suitcase and makes a disaster of it.
(I never knew other people did that.) The grieving that Joyce does for her baby, including her wanting to just be alone and feel self-pity - that was great.
It wasn't my favorite, and I wouldn't recommend it to most people I know - though I do know a few that would probably really like it.
Even more strange is the fact that she is “seeing” someone else’s memories.On one of his regular work visits to Dublin, Justin bumps into Joyce, the girl he comes to know as the “girl in the red coat” and immediately feels a connection to her.
He keeps bumping into her and losing her time and time again and the story really has you wondering whether or not they will ever get to meet each other and get to know each other properly.It is a charming, witty and often moving read and on the whole, I really enjoyed the story but, unlike other Cecelia Aherne books, I wasn’t gripped and quite often found myself skimming pages.

3.5 stars (but not enough to round up) This book had its moments… but not enough of them. It was basically “Sleepless in Seattle” with a twist.
It was an easy read and a sweet story, though most of the time it felt like the narration was focused more on the relationship between Joyce and her father than the actual story between the two protagonists, Joyce and Justin.
Cecelia Ahern created this book as if the readers were watching an film, the action, the instant changes among scenes and characters, that kind of brought to my mind films like "Serendipity" and "In your eyes".
In the end the story seemed a little rushed to me and left me quite emotionally hanging but on the whole it was a really enjoyble book!
Maybe my favourite character in the book!
I read the whole thing but the story was so unbelievable that I actually got so irritated with it but at the same time was being lightly entertained and had to finish it to see what happened in the end.
When I was younger I used to devour these kinds of books and read one after the other but maybe my tastes have changed and I'm not such a romantic anymore?!
(How sad!) I normally rate books well if I learned something while reading it and I didn't learn anything from this book!My favourite parts of the book was the relationship that Joyce has with her father and their visit to London and the Antiques Roadshow was amusing so it wasn't all bad.
Sé que no estoy siendo muy parcial con la calificación de esta novela porque quien se robo mi corazón fue Henry el papá de Joyce, la protagonista de la historia. Su sola presencia hizo que quisiera seguir leyendo. Me he reído, me ha conmovido mucho y me ha dado una tarde maravillosa.Es la primera novela que leo de Cecelia y voy por más a ver que sorpresas me tiene.Léanla. La van a disfrutar mucho.
Suprise .... Di bagian Akhir yang penuh mengejutkan dan mengharukan, hampir saja aku menangis hal itu. Aku suka semua karakter dalam Thanks for the memories ini. Apalagi Henry Conway, ayah Joyce yang lucu, perhatian, kocak. Seakan2 Aku terhanyut dunia Joyce dan ayahnya. Aku merasakan itu amat senyatanya. Sukaaaa sekali Joyce dan Justin.

"And everyday, I miss her more that I did the day before."Oh. I immediately feel guilty for wishing that on him."It's like my garden, love.
Tidak banyak penulis yang bisa menghanyutkan pembaca seperti halnya Cecelia.Tapi buat gue, jalan cerita yang awalnya begitu nyata ini mulai terasa fiktifnya saat Joyce mengirimkan tiket opera kepada Justin melalui perantara Thomas.
Seperti halnya kita sedang melamunkan hal-hal yang indah, begitu indah sampai terasa seakan-akan nyata, tapi kemudian dengan satu kedipan saja semua kembali ke dunia nyata.Tapi ini menjadi salah satu buku favorit gue lagi dari Cecelia Ahern.
This book sucked me right in from the riveting 3 page prologue, powerfully, painfully written.
With each missed connection I groaned and sighed in my mind.
Reading this book was quite an emotional ride.
On top of the mysterious connection and romance angle of the book, I found the supporting characters to be really enjoyable.
I loved that the author took the time to really define all the relationships (friendships, marriages, parent/child, sibling) in the book and gave the reader a chance to know characters through those relationships.
This will be out in April 2009Ahern, queen of the "soul mates will find each other" chic lit fairy tales, has another winner on her hands.
There's always a bit of magic involved in her tales, but this one has the biggest dose yet.
While still in the hospital, she discovers she has all sorts of new knowledge--architectural, artistic, historic, a grasp of languages--that she had no actual way of having gained.
A couple of chance meetings with a tall man set sparks flying and the comedic dance of trying to get two strangers who are meant to be together ACTUALLY together begins.
