Written by the author of They Shoot Horses, Don't They?, this dark noir thriller introduces readers to a grim yet adventurous life of Ralph Cotter.
Seemingly a psychopath with virtually no conscience or moral code at first, Cotter acts above the law, has no time for anybody but himself, and he's a crafty man whose entire life consists of violence.
While it could be said that this is just an excuse for bad behavior, it does give some insight into why some people choose to do what they do so shamelessly.
Tough guys, sexy women, crooked lawyers, dishonest cops, blackmail, betrayal, manipulation, sex and violence, it’s all in Kiss Tomorrow Goodbye, and it all hits home hard.As a fan of hardboiled crime fiction, you’d think I’d have fallen in love with this one and I would have had the cover bronzed and framed to sit above my fireplace.
If so, you’d think wrong because I didn’t really enjoy Kiss Tomorrow Goodbye that much.Ralph Cotter is a career criminal.
Published in 1948 at the start of what scholars consider the beginning of the Noir/Paperback era in crime fiction (and the end of the hardboiled era of authors like Dashiell Hammett, Chandler and the pulp magazines and their authors) , Kiss Tomorrow Goodbye leans towards the hardboiled genre, that had just past, but enters the noir era.
the film, and the book were widely banned because it was "a sordid, sadistic presentation of brutality and an extreme presentation of crime with explicit steps in commission." I guess they didn’t want little Johnny learning step by step criminal schemes.“Kiss Tomorrow Goodbye” 1950, starring James CagneyThe movie received mixed reviews by the American critics, and was often compared unfavorably to White Heat which features Cagney in a similar role.
I had the impression that her breasts were small and hard and firm, but they were not in focus; I was looking at that Eldorado again" - p 35 Holiday & the narrator argue about her brother, who was killed in the escape: "'Go on, be jealous,' she said.
I closed my eyes to protect them and slipped my head, jerking my knee up, slamming her in the crotch." - p 38 "'There you go getting jealous again,' she said.
"One of these days I hope I can look at that thing and not hear wonderful music, I thought, cramming the money back into my coat pockets.
An intense book. My opinion kept shifting. But it was lively and entertaining, and I liked it overall. Plenty of sex and violence, though the sex, at least, isn't graphic. The other book of his I read, They Shoot Horses, Don't They? (more famous, these days, because of an old movie) is from 1935, and this is from 1948. Interesting. It seems that McCoy, in those decades, was a big name in noir.
Esto se trasladó a sus libros y no solo por su contenido: alguno tuvo importantes problemas para aparecer publicado (pero eso es otra historia).El caso es que en 1948 escribe una de sus mejores obras (que no la más conocida), Despídete del mañana, y eso no es que mejorara mucho las cosas en su maltrecha carrera literaria, pero al menos contribuyó a la historia del noir con una obra maestra absoluta (y no hay muchas), todo un prodigio de escritura vertiginosa, protagonista inolvidable y toneladas de mierda.
Sabe que aquella será una mañana especial porque será el principio de algo, de otra cosa.
The passionate scenes between McCoy, whose been in custody for two years, and Holiday are powerful to say the least.With Holiday's help, Cotter escapes the prison work farm and, although initially intent on leaving the nearby town, begins step by step to take it over.
The story includes daring, violent armed robberies, crooked cops, and a romance with a wealthy dame whose perfume reminds Cotter of his childhood.If there is one word to use in describing this book, that would be intensity.
Some of the scenes are just awesome such as the prison escape and Cotter's romance with the rich blonde in the sports car.
Uscito nel 1948, un tipico hard-boiled in bianco e nero (pi� nero).
Oggi, scrivere un giallo o un thriller o un noir (qualsiasi cosa voglia dire - noir ricordo nasce come giallo dal colore delle copertine, nere in Francia e gialle da noi) agganciandosi troppo alla tecnologia rischia di fare invecchiare irrimediabilmente tutto appena essa cambia.
Mentre frugare nei cassetti pu� assomigliare a leggere le e-mail con la sola differenza che si pu� fare anche a distanza, una fuga che non contempli l'onnipresenza di telecamere � definitivamente consegnata alla storia.
McCoy � l'autore di "non si uccidono cos� anche i cavalli?"
This is one nasty hard as hell crime fiction piece.
"Hard boiled" doesn't being to describe the writing style of Horace McCoy. Having previously read his most famous work, "They Shoot Horses, Don't They?" and another rather short novel, "I Should Have Stayed Home," which could almost be a prequel to "Horses," I wasn't quite prepared for "Kiss Tomorrow Goodbye." The protagonist is Cotter, a prison escapee who takes on and discards acquaintances, "business associates," women, and (admittedly very few) friends along the way with hardly a thought to anyone but his own needs.
just remembered this one which was an old republished noir i was guided to by Max Decharne, Mark Lamarr, Jonathon Ross, Joe Whitney, Huck Fuller etc (nonmainstream London media characters) from Decharne's band's song title. the book itself is great, amoral, unpredictable, gritty and admittedly cruel and nasty. i'd give it 5 stars but it was printed in a shit font to reflect the lad mag culture of the Chris Evans / Tony Blair era
It's about three times longer and one third as good as They Shoot Horses, Don't They? It's a 30s era crime novel that was made into a James Cagney film. I didn't hate it, but I found the writing generally pedestrian (some good stuff at the end though) and the plot humdrum. It didn't help that the protagonist was a cold psychopath and yet we are supposed to care about his childhood trauma.

A noir thriller about a psychopathic killer which prominently features tense discussions about the dangers of exceeding the speed limit and about who closed the window while the protagonist was sleeping.
I did not like this novel. As a point of fact I found it to be a colossal confusing bore. I saw no purpose of the Margaret character and all the action was at the beginning only
Стреляй в живота – или той ще стреля в теб: http://knigolandia.info/book-review/u...Макар на корицата да има само едно име, че и отзад информацията е единствено за „Уморените коне ги убиват, нали?“, томчето съдържа още два страхотни романа на Хорас Маккой – „Прости се с утрешния ден“ и „Саванът няма джобове“.
Тук краят беше неясен абсолютно през цялото време, допадна ми как Маккой тикаше героите си ту в една, ту в друга посока, точно както е в живота, не следваше една ясна линия, градираща или не, а им подаваше една възможност, после им я отнемаше, оставяше им възможност да се измъкнат, да избягат, да оцелеят и вътрешно, и физически, но ги оставяше да захвърлят тези лесни варианти.Издателска къща БАРД﻿http://knigolandia.info/book-review/u...
The story charts the scheming, amoral life of ‘Ralph Cotter’ (one of a set of aliases), who compulsively lies, cheats, steals and, with little prompting, kills or commits violence.
The plot is pure hardboiled noir.
However, after about a third of the way in the style and pace noticeably changes, the action dissipating and the narrative becoming more psychological in orientation.
Scenes get a little drawn out, there’s needless repetition of thoughts/dialogue, and the plot loses drive and direction.
Nevertheless, the tale is a fascinating account of a man obsessed with being as equally ruthless as Dillinger, but being much cleverer and successful in his criminal pursuits.
In fact, after several weeks of struggling through leaden prose narrated by a boring, piss-poor anti-hero, I stopped reading it.
The novel starts with a bang, as the protagonist stages a daring prison escape, but then it all comes to a halt in a small town, where the narrator wanders around with little plan, blackmailing crooked cops, falling for the wrong woman, and pontificates at length on how brilliant he is (and conversely how stupid everybody else is).
And in a novel like this, once the protagonist loses you then it becomes a struggle to turn the page.
I'm glad I watched the film before I read the book as the film was slightly watered down by Warner Brothers.
This meant that I got far more enjoyment out of the book as I was getting a lot more of the same.Horace McCoy has captured the essence of 1940's America (actually it's more 1920's in my opinion).
Maybe it's because I have watched the film so many times but I have to say that as well as being my favourite film of all time, Kiss Tomorrow Goodbye - the book - is now my favourite read of all time.


This book had most of the elements you would expect in a hard-boiled/noir novel. Sexy women, several corrupt characters from cops, lawyers to the main protagonist's cohorts. Every one with their own motive. The book starts with a bang with a great description of the prison life and breakout. The book moves along at a great pace until part 2 when Ralph meets M. Dobson and then the author starts to pull in elements, bit at a time, of Ralph's past that forms his later actions but also drags the book down.
This book was really good. I discovered it after I watched the movie starring James Cagney. Because of the movie, though, I knew the ending, so I wasn't surprised too much. The main character, Ralph Cotter, was extremely interesting and very disturbing at times. The other characters were good too, though Holiday (Ralph's moll) got irritating at times. The story starts out with a bang, but towards the middle of the book, the story lags. Other than that, this book was really good read.
This is a plot-driven, page-turning novel told from the perspective of an escaped convict, criminal-type. Put this narrator up there with Scarface. There are a lot of highly-improbable plot twists but that was OK by me. I enjoyed the mid-Century take on psychology and philosophy too. This book doesn't hit the masterpiece level like "They Shoot Horses, Don't They?" but it was absolutely a compelling read.
Well, it did get more interesting toward the end, and I definitely didn't see the ending coming. Overall, it wasn't an enjoyable read. I like an unreliable narrator, but not an entirely unlikable one. This one is painfully pretentious, without its being tempered by any self-doubt. His psychic depths make the ending so odd, and must provide fodder for some more analytical reads, but I don't think I'll bother with any more McCoy.
from the first line this novel takes off with a whirlwind topped only by Jim Thompson at his best. Read this before They Shoot Horses Don't They, indeed was the only reason why I read that book, and in all honesty I couldn;t get enough. One of the more graphic sex and violence novels from that era. I cannot imagine how they got away with making a film of this at that time......
The Time mag review form 1948 starts: "If one of the dead-end kids were to write a novel, with the aid of an unabridged dictionary, the result might be something like Kiss Tomorrow Good-Bye. It is one of the nastiest novels ever published in this country." Recommendation enough for crime noir fans?
Atypical late 40's crime novel. Sociopathic main character reminded me of some of Elmore Leonard's crazed dirtbags. Some excellent writing and very funny dialogue that hasn't dated in 60+ years. Interesting to read a book like this that was years ahead of most other books of the genre.
This is one intense book. Extremely graphic for a late 40s crime novel. Closer to what came out in the late '50s (and that's only with Jim Thompson) and even later.UPDATE, June 22, 2010: It's intense in terms of content matter, but it's kind of pretentious, and now getting a little annoying.
Started out promising but only made it to pg.95- it got tedious real fast. Perhaps I'll try to get back into it at a later date. ( Had high hopes as I love noir and especially the crazy-ass novels of Jim Thompson in the 50's).
