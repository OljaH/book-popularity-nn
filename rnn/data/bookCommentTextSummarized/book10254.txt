The best parts about the novel are the opening and final acts, basically the first and last fifty pages of the book.
Then the book changed, drastically, and I quickly lost interest in what seemed to be a religious thriller with supernatural undertones.
Then it changed again, morphing into an end of days scenario before wrapping up with a strong action-packed finale.
While Baal is well-written, I could almost feel McCammon's growing pains.
In summation: Only read Baal if you're a completionist.
And please, please, for Tom Cruise's sake, do not make this the first McCammon book you read.
Not quite as exciting as I hoped it would be, but not terrible either. Realizing this was Mr. McCammon's first book, I felt like I could sense the not-quite-realized talent that shows so well in the other books of his I've read. Lots of potential in the story and the characters, just not quite enough there. But, glad I read it! 3.0/5.0 stars is where I would land.
Each of these segments drew out to highlight the power of the story, not needing to jump around, and in staying amidst themselves and having respect/importance for each scene, making each segment count as much as the first and the last - well, that is where this story truly succeeded.Virga was such an awesome hero because, like in so many biblical stories and lessons, he was an ordinary man.
To say that I like Robert McCammon's writing is like saying fish kind of like water.
Baal is McCammon's first novel published way back in 1978.
You literally feel like your dying of thirst and your skin is blistering, but the transformation into Part III is hurried and muddled.The last part again uses McCammon's uncanny ability to build the setting and atmosphere to it's fullest height.
In fact, it felt like McCammon had spend all of his energy on creating the journey that he didn't quite know what to do with the ending.
Michael's ability to control Baal without much trouble what-so-ever seemed like a stretch.
3.5 🌟 SterneKein schlechtes Debüt, aber es reicht nicht ganz für gute 4 Sterne.Weitere Gedanken folgen später.🇬🇧 Review to come.
Only the second McCammon I've read (the other being Boy's Life -one of my top 3 favorite books ever), I have a whole shelf of his other paperbacks at home.
In Baal, McCammon places bits of the story in Greenland, the US, and in the Middle East.
The Middle Eastern scenes in particular were very easy to fall into.
Baal was the perfect bastard all the way through, but I found the chapters of Jeffrey Raines aka Baal in the Boys Home were probably the most terrifying.
Lots of cool visuals throughout, as well.Yep. Can't wait for the next book from RRM!
Even lately, with his Matthew Corbett series, which is a bit of a diversion from his more well-known modern horror works, McCammon stands up there, to me, as strongly as the big heavy-hitters of horror, like Stephen King.BAAL was his debut novel way back when and it shows.
The novel flashes forward to an orphanage where the boy frightens the nuns, priests, and begins to attract a following of fellow student/orphans, who call him by his preferred name: Baal, a demonic entity.Years later, Baal has grown in power and influence, and soon gathers murderous followers in the Middle East, all converging in Kuwait, awaiting to see him.

BAAL is the first, and whilst nowhere near as bad as McCammon made out, it still isn't great.Whist more serious and mature in tone than another one of his early works, Bethanys sin, BAAL never quite knows what it wants to be.
We have the said family tragedy and BAAL as a youngster with a certain omen feel to it, and then we are thrust into a story about a priest looking into a massive cult following with no idea how and why this has come about, and then, finally, the last third, whilst being atmospheric and creepy, does not match up with anything that has come before it and ends with a whimper.
I’ve been a Robert McCammon fan for quite a while now but had never read his first published novel.
And then it morphs again into a religious thriller in the Middle East followed by an action-packed finale in Greenland.
I can see this novel as a learning effort for the young 25 year old Robert McCammon but in the end it is also easy to see the framing of what would become the master writer of later years.While not his best novel, this is still very much worth the read, especially for McCammon fans.
OMG! Robert McCannon is my new love, this story was an awesome adventure & I cannot believe this was his debut novel from 1978! Please read this scary fastpaced & still viable in this day & age novel. I cant say enough about this work or this author but these truthful words: A true genius & master @ this most difficult of crafts where so many are called but few chosen & fewer sti;; who possess the raw talent fiction & the horror genre demand. I recommend this novel as a Must Read=+=
Fucking wicked terrorist/assassin novel. That's all I'm going to say. If you like hardcore action, then this is for you. Quite surreal evocations in all his novels I have read thus far. Love it. And don't forget the RM horror injections!
McCammon's new novel The Border is out very soon from Subterranean Press, but here's where it all began back in 1978; Baal is a very concise, pulpy and epic horror novel on a global scale, told in three acts.Things kick off in seventies' grimy America, as the future mom of the demon gets attacked on the street.
Baal doesn't quite reach the dizzy heights it aspires to, but it makes a great effort, and in doing so points the way for McCammon's later novels.
But as the The Stand it was a massive book of more than 800 pages.
So I put the book on the shelf next to Stephen King’s and others large books of 800 pages and they have been there for years.
The story begins with the birthing of Baal (which is also the name of a daemon), from a raped woman, and as the story progress we get to know how he lived and how he gather together believers.
Their plain is simple: thwart Baal’s plans.The pace is not that good and in my opinion quite slow and only in the latter half we are presented one of the major characters.
This book contains many elements of which character development might be its most notorious one.
There was one day, I remember, when I thought of Baal's conclusion as the best ending I could've thought of for this book.
I searched Google for Book #2 or something that would give me a proper ending but no, there was nothing to reconcile with other than the void left by an epic-fail.I would recommend this book to most readers in search of what I believe to be character development at its best.
Three stars for the rest of the book.
This was McCammon's first book, so it is by no means his best.
The story of Baal (a daemon or demigod of evil) who is born from a raped woman and manages to gather together a frenzied following of believers.
The "good guys" we follow include a theology professor, a half Eskimo hunter and the mysterious "Michael" in their quest to end Baal's influence.
The book is well written, though from the beginning I feared I was reading an "Omen" rip off.
The problem with this story versus so many other of McCammon's is that there really isn't anything here that we haven't seen before.
This started out so strong, then it just seemed to lose its way.
Don't call a book BAAL then make him absent for the bulk of the storyline.The second issue was that, of the three characters that ultimately chase Baal to ground, only one has any real motivation to do so, and he's the guy bent on revenge for the murder of the Eskimos.
Michael's secret should have been offered much sooner, because it was poorly hidden and would have enriched the storyline.Initially I wondered why McCammon always sounded a little embarrassed with this novel, but now I see it.
Excellent, but it's interesting, as his first novel, how different it is from all the rest. These are somewhat stock characters, this is a "horror novel", and though very well written, not at all like his latter work, so it's interesting to see how he's evolved as a writer.

BAAL (1978) marks the debut of Robert R McCammon, a popular author of paperback original horror novels in the '80s (who transitioned to more mainstream suspense and historical suspense fiction in the '90s and beyond). BAAL is the story of the Canaanite fertility god/demon who is reborn in contemporary NYC and who goes on to lead an apocalyptic death cult in Kuwait, fakes his own death by assassination, and hides out in Greenland where he has a showdown with an elderly theologian from Boston, a Jack London-esque Artic outdoorsman, and a mysterious character named Michael (presumably the archangel).
Not sure I am being fair to this novel. I enjoyed it, thought it was well written, aside from at least one or two weak points in the plot, but I can't say it even creeped me out. Also, I am kind of over the whole biblical thing even though this story tweaks it. That whole branch of mythology is tired and overdone.All the same, well worth the read.
There are moments in this book where the writer McCammon would become shine through. Overall though, the book was a little flat for me. The story just didn't interest me, because I felt like I had read it or seen it before. Still, it's a successful first novel. On to more McCammon!
Si lo topan en la librería compren lo, es bueno para aumentar su colección, pero si no lo leen no se pierden de mucho.
I just love Robert McCammon's stylish horror writing. The timeless battle between good and evil, in this brutal tale. I just can't get enough of this author. Truly brilliant.
Todo iba bien hasta el final que de verdad no sé en qué carajo estaba pensando en autor.Tanto nadar para morir en la orilla ¡no me jodan!
This is McCammon's first novel. While it's not Boy's Life or Swan Song, it still was a good read. The chapters are a lot shorter than his other books, which I appreciated. Long, drawn out chapters tend to slow the pace in my opinion. I think McCammon only gets away with it only because he's such a good writer.The final confrontation didn't satisfy in the context of the build-up and the ending felt abrupt. Nevertheless, this was still a very good novel. I enjoyed it.
Οποίος έχει διαβάσει αρκετά βιβλία της σειράς αυτής, πιθανότατα να έχει καταλάβει ότι αρκετοί συγγραφείς δε θα μπορούσαν να γράψουν μια καλή πρόταση ακόμα κι αν εξαρτιόταν ή ζωή τους από αυτό.
Το συγκεκριμένο βιβλίο είναι ή εξαίρεση στον κανόνα, αφού ή γραφή του Μακκαμον είναι Ε-ΞΑΙ-ΡΕ-ΤΙ-ΚΗ κι ας είναι αυτό το πρώτο του βιβλίο ( αργότερα θα πάρει Bram Stoker με τα Swan Song και Mine) και, συνολικά, το βιβλίο σου αφήνει υποσχέσεις για έναν μεγάλο συγγραφέα που είναι ακόμα στα σπάργανα.Δυστυχώς όμως, όσο καλή εντύπωση σου αφήνει το γράψιμο τόσο κακή είναι η πλοκή: αποσπασματική, με κενά και με αδύναμη κλιμάκωση δε θυμίζει σε τίποτα τα πολύ καλύτερα επόμενα βιβλία του.
Υπάρχουν μερικές δυνατές σκηνές, ιδίως στη μέση με την έρημο του Κουβέιτ όμως παραμένουν ανεκπλήρωτες υποσχέσεις (μέχρι τουλάχιστον τα επόμενα βιβλία του ίδιου)
This is the story of an incarnated demon who drives ordinary people to horrific violence and plans to usher in the end of the world.
The biblical god Baal (cast as a powerful demon) travels from place to place spreading war, death, and violence in his wake- growing stronger with each soul he corrupts.
A confrontation with the forces of good is inevitable- but all there are are to oppose him are a doubtful elderly theology professor who becomes involved after losing his friend to the monster, a greedy and self-centered Eskimo "shaman" who has his own problems with violence, and a mysterious stranger named Michael (three guesses who THAT is) and the stakes are the whole of creation.
I am a big fan of Robert McCammon and it bothers me that I have a bad review for one of his books.
If this would have been the first McCammon book I ever read I probably would have never read another one of his.
This was McCammon's first book and you can see how much he has grown since then.
If you want to read Mccammo then I suggest the following; Swan Song, Boys Life, Wolf's Hour and Speaks the Nightbird (actually all the Matthew Corbett series).
In my opinion, Speaks the Nightbird is his best work.
It's one of the best books I have ever read.
This is McCammon's first book and it shows. It's not bad exactly, I just didn't enjoy it that much and while it's realativley short it took longer to get through than it should have. I also had high expectations going in as I really enjoyed They Thirst (another one of the early books). It hasn't put me off reading some of the other earlier entries (Usher's Passing will probably be next) but I wouldn't suggest this unless you really want to read all McCammon's work.
