This book is completely surpassed by Anthony Faulkes' New Introduction To Old Norse, but is still interesting for its historical value and is one of those quirky old oddities that must be owned.
Not really a "teach yourself" kind of book - more of a text reference for a course with an experienced tutor. Nevertheless, some of my first real experience with my ancestral language came from this book, which was a Yuletide gift from Heather.
I find myself delighted when historical figures such as Ragnar Loðbrók, Floki (the viking who gave name to the country that we know today as Iceland) or Rollo are mentioned (they are main characters in the TV series 'Vikings').
Of course, if you don't know Icelandic or Old Norse, you are not going to understand anything, so providing the reader with a parallel translation of the text, he/she will be guided and not lost with an indecipherable text.
I know this book is quite old, but thinking of the target audience is an important matter, and this suggestion can be taken for more contemporary pieces of work.
Increasingly my most well-worn book; the glossary is thumbed brown. Perhaps I should eat less barbecue and practice better manual hygiene.It is an old-fashioned approach to the language, there is no doubt about that! However, upon returning to it, I find that I was an impatient college student, and this dense little fellow is increasingly making himself apparent to me. The fault, as it turns out, is not in the stars, or the book, for that matter.
Gordon's introduction to Old Norse remains a standard in the field. A well-selected anthology of prose and poetry (including Skaldic verse), with detailed notes, and a comprehensive grammar and glossary make this an ideal choice for beginning and intermediate readers.
