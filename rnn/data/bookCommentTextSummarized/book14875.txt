The whole book can be boiled down to 2 key ideas: - The brand that gets in the mind of the consumer first wins.
Who makes the best soda?
The best small cars?
The best round chips?
Tip: Find a narrow niche and hold it tight!
- Line extension is bad (Xerox producing computers in bad, Chevrolet making small cars is bad, even Pantene producing body foam is bad).
Tip to companies: Never stray from the business where you are the leader!
I read the updated edition of the book that was originally published in the ate 70's.
The authors say that the essence of positioning is to make your brand name stand for the generic (e.g., Kleenex).I like the advice to start with the position you already have (what you’re already known for), and work to improve from there.It’s mostly applicable to large companies with large advertising budgets, but most principles can apply to smaller businesses.
Being the first to (1) establish the high price position (2) with a valid product story (3) in a category where consumers are receptive to a high-priced brand is the secret of success.”“The place to establish the high price is in the ads, not in the store.
Many of the paragraphs are a single sentence.The main idea is that you cannot make in-roads in an existing market by attacking the top dog.
The top dog, the market leader, will beat you every time.
Instead, the authors argue that you have to position your product/company/person in the mind of the consumer, in relation to the market leader.
And forcing your idealized position on the mind of the consumer won't work, so your position often starts with the existing public perception of your product/service/idea.The example used numerous times throughout the book is Avis.
I don't read books about marketing.
It was pretty interesting though, since the trends he describes can definitely be observed in action.However, Ries raised a lot of red flags with how certain he sounded about his assessments.
Anyway, it wasn't a huge part of the book, but he sounded so sure about everything, and that really off-putting for me.
It's probably true that the same forces are at work in today's market, but a lot of his examples were lost on me.Still, an interesting read, that gave me a completely new perspective on the value of good advertising in the marketplace.
Крутейшая книга по позиционированию продукта. Очень жалею, раньше ее не прочитал.
One of the classics in marketing. I believe it’s a concept that should be known by every marketer.
Its old, but its a classic. I was told it's part of the curriculum for Harvard Business school. If you are creating a product or a brand, this is a MUST READ. Biggest takeaway: you want to create a new category and dominate it. So don't be the 7th biggest social network, be the #1 book focused social network. People can only remember the top 3 things in any given category. It's a fun exercise actually, start to think of products and try to name as many brands as you can. Oftentimes you can only get to a few!
It was good. Then the last chapter came in, and made it a must read 🤩🤩
He mentions companies that have now closed down and talks about the great things that they are doing - for example, he talks about how Newsweek is a much better magazine name than Time and will surely be more successful because of it.
There's another part where he mentions that George Bush is a handsome man and I thought "OK, sure, W isn't too bad, I guess?" and then you realize he means George Bush Senior and the whole book seems like a relic from another time.
If publishers would update it with new information on social media and some more modern examples, I could see this getting new life as a must read for students.
I read this book to help enhance the growth of my start-up ladies leisurewear brand, Broads. While this book had me engage in a lot of critical thinking about typical product placement and where I would like to see my line in five, ten, and even twenty years from now, I felt as if Positioning was a bit dated and put too much of an emphasis on companies with bold names. I was hoping to learn more about creating a solid position in a marketplace that is difficult to 'break' into.
Another 200 page business/marketing book that would have been better published as a pamphlet. There are some great ideas here though, so I can see why its held its classic status.
Mind Buggling experience as I battle with this book :)
The opening chapters are very blowhardy: I nearly threw down the book in disgust.
But when the authors finally get going they're golden (if fairly dated).
Their insights on how brands convey meaning, especially how they fail to carry all the meaning companies intend them to when they create line extensions, all of that stuff is great and makes me want to re-read this in a few years (or maybe grab the audiobook) to see how the knowledge has settled.
Absolutely essential reading for anybody trying to figure out what to name their product, or what to do about the next product they want to launch while keeping an existing product in market.
A classic whose concepts are covered more succinctly in the authors’ follow up Immutable Laws of Marketing. There are more detailed examples here, but it suffers from even more dated company and trend references (drugs and airlines that haven’t existed since the 70s, a positioning plan for a Western Union service, and hailing cable TV as the next great frontier).I want to applaud the concepts, which I think are timeless. But I keep getting tripped up by the ancient references.
This book talks about how to stand out in an overcrowded field--and it's not by merely being good at what you do.
Yes, you have to be excellent.
But there are many others who are excellent as well.
He shares about the power of a clear name and the trap of line extension.It's a strong book and the only reason it's four stars and not five is that it's old enough to be a little out of touch with modern readers and has no comments on the wild world of online business/brands today.

I feel like a lot of it is common sense, but then again when you're an intuitive person and you make your living as a persuasive writer, maybe it's just that I've already grasped a lot of the points the book is shooting to make.This is a very quick read.
If you're at all interested in how the advertising or successful politicking mind works, you might want to read this.
(That is, after all, what they had us read it for).
I agree with other reviewers who commented that the book is in a need of an update - urgently.
The style of writing.
The staccato-styled writing is very distracting for me.
What happens to those that are not first to market?
While there's a section that explains how to position as a follower, I feel that the book is EXTREMELY biased such that the author thinks the importance of being first to market cannot be trumped.
I don't think the author did a very good job explaining how to position as a follower.
True to this book's title Ries and Trout deliver their strategy and tactics for "positioning" the mind of consumer or prospect.
The book goes into heavy introduction about the entire concept of "positioning".
I like that the book is constructed in a textbook style, where PAR (Problem, Action, and Result) statements are given to scenarios observing the "positioning" technique.
I paid extra attention to the last three chapters where action plans are given to "position" yourself regarding career, your business, and how to maintain the "positioning game".
I can't wait to implement some of these techniques in my own businesses and career strategies.
هر وقت از من بخواهند یا خودم بخواهم به زور در رابطه با کتابی نظر بدهم میگویم خوب بود.
بد بود.
بامزه بود، عجب نثری داشت و به همین ترتیب.
این آقا هم کلا اولین بار مفهوم پوزیشنینگ را مطرح کرده همین طوری از تبلیغ ها و رویکردهای شرکت ها صحبت می کند.
مثلا سونآپ استراتژی خوبی داشت برای مقابله با کوکاکولا و پپسی ولی بعدش خراب کرد.
باید در بازار اول باشید و گرنه هیچ کس شما را یادش نمی ماند.
اگر در بازار اول نیستید چیزی در بازار پیدا کنید که بتوانید اول باشید.

اما اگر بخواهید کتاب استانداردی باشد که یک مفهومی در مدیریت را یادتان بدهد، نه این طوری نیست خیلی، باید باهوش باشید زیاد و بتوانید از خلال متن مساله ی خودتان را پیدا و حل کنید.
در مورد بیانیه ی پوزیشنینگ هم در کتاب چیزی گفته نشده سرچ کنید در اینترنت هست، آن آخرش سعی کنید بنویسیدش.
Answer this: do more people have automotive batteries bought at JC Penney or Sears?
You do know that the DieHard brand is from Sears, right?This just made the "must read" book list for Main Street Startups.
I bought it in May 1996.
And now again, December 2011.Recently I did several presentations on the Four Ps of Marketing Mix and brought my attention back to this classic Ries & Trout text.
If you are serious about your startup and play any role in its Marketing efforts [which predate sales], you need to read this over once or twice.
An oldie but certainly a goodie. It would be interesting to have this rewritten with today's companies in mind, however the general principals here still ring true. The key takeaway for me here was a not so subtle reminder of just how important a name is when it comes to successful branding & positioning. You'll always be coming from a long way back if you're having to continually compensate for a product or company name that's not right for your position.
The whole idea about this book is to position your product/company from customer’s standpoint.We cannot simply compete with the king when we do not position our product. This book will make us think about a product from outside and the reason for doing so is clearly explained. The examples are very insightful. Nevertheless a book which easily gets 5 stars.
Эта как и другие книги Траута и Райса очень основательно проработана. Авторы молодцы и прописали в книге множество золотых правил и предупредили от всевозможных ошибок.Хотя в некоторых моментах я лично не согласен и готов поспорить с авторами, но всё-таки в целом считаю эту книгу довольно хорошей.
It turns your head around, forcing you to think outside-in. It's not about what your product is, it's about how they perceive it. It's not what you say, it's how they get it. From positioning a candy bar, a bank, a country or the church, the book presents the basic principles for doing it. Examples are insightful although because it's a classic, they are a little old. Nevertheless a great book.
The battle between brands takes place in the prospects mind. This book is marketing classic where the authors showcase isights, strategies, example of both successful and unsuccessful positioning of services, brands, products such as Coke, Duracell, Xerox...they even go about how to position a country.
How to position your product or service in the mind of the customer.
This is the only book a marketing professional needs to read to learn how to market a product and build a brand.
It's like an explanation of what the people in Mad Men actually do. Worthwhile read for anyone who has ever wondered why some ads/companies work, and others don't.
Escrito em 1987, válido para os dias de hoje.
