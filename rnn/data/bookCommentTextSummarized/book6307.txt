The novel focuses on Lucas Beauchamp, a black farmer accused of murdering a white man.
He is exonerated through the efforts of black and white teenagers and a spinster from a long-established Southern family.
It was written as Faulkner's response as a Southern writer to the racial problems facing the South.
In his Selected Letters, Faulkner wrote: "the premise being that the white people in the south, before the North or the Govt.
نقل از متن: «او عزادار بوده، برای عزادار بودن لازم نیست حتما سفیدپوست باشی».
The poverty and nth-class status of blacks in the south at the time this novel is set--the 1940s, just before the advent of MLK and the Civil Rights Movement--was harsh and Faulkner captures it, and the murderous white vindictiveness, exquisitely.
This novel is the weakest I've read, second only to the last Snopes volume, The Town.
Faulkner does these scenes in the buggy pitch darkness of the American south, bringing them to life like no one else I've read.
Hemingway said that you can't reread Faulkner, because when you do you see how he tricked you the first time through.
Me: Mr. Faulkner, I can’t begin to tell you how honored I am that you agreed to take the time to answer a couple of questions from me.
Thank you very much.Faulkner: No problem.
So, I thank you again.Faulkner: Let’s keep my bits out of it.Me: Pardon me.
Anyhow, some people say they can’t understand your writing, even when they’ve read it two or three times.
What would you say to them?Faulkner: Read it four times.Me: But what about Strunk and White’s basic rules ?Faulkner: What’s a Strunk and Whitey?
Faulkner: Are you calling me stupid?Me: No. Oh god no.Faulkner: Are you calling me God?

The truths about human nature that Faulkner/Gavin Stevens provides are elemental, honest, not pretty, but highly educational.
Some things you must never stop refusing to bear.
(loc 2803)My only real concern about this novel is the amount of time given to "speechifying." I wonder if this is because it is later in Faulkner's work and he continues to see the same problems/errors/sins being repeated over and over around him.
Perhaps he felt the need to speak out more forcefully here through Stevens' mouth to young Chick's ear.
This boy is the future of the South perhaps, the future of Faulkner's county.
I`ve rated this 4 stars because I really enjoyed the story and some wonderful characters, once I`d got my head around it! There seemed to be pages and pages of nothing (sorry Mr Faulkner) but rambling. This is the first book of his that I`ve read and others have told me that this is not the best one to start with. I may leave it a little while before trying another.

Enter Gavin Stevens, county lawyer, and his 16 year old nephew Chick Mallison.
The plot proceeds in typical Faulkner fashion, told from Chick's point of view.
You have to love a 70 year old spinster who'll help you dig up a dead body in the middle of the night.
And Chick's realization of the strength, endurance, and wisdom of his mother was worth the price of the book for me.
As Lucas said, "If you want something done, give it to a woman to do."I couldn't have said it better myself.Oh, and this book has a perfect ending.
داستان در مورد سیاه پوستی است که ظاهرا جوان سفیدپوستی را به قتل رسانده است .
مرد سیاه پوست از نوجوان سفیدپوستی می خواهد تا به او کمک کند و از راز قتل پرده بردارد .ساده تر از رمان های قبلی فاکنر بود .
یک جورایی به نظرم معمولی بود در حد مثلا خشم و هیاهو یا آبشالوم آبشالوم نبود اما خوب بود .
شخصیت مرد سیاه پوست داستان آقای لوکاس قبلا در برخیز ای موسی ظاهر شده است .
در آن زمان فیلم جزو ده فیلم برگزیده نیویورک تایمز بود اما از نظر فروش گیشه خیلی ناموفق بود.
Chick has attempted to pay him—assuming it only right that a white man pay a black man for favors, but Lucas wouldn’t accept the money.
His main idea in this novel has to do with the “code” that developed in the South—pre- and post-Civil War—and which required the white man to “take care” of the black man but which resisted any interference from outside the South, on the theory that, in its own time, the South (meaning of course the white South) would solve the discrimination problem without interference from the North or from the government.

Description: Set in the deep south that provided the backdrop for all of Faulkner's finest fiction, Intruder in the Dust is the novel that marks the final phase of its author's outstanding creative period. The chronicle of an elderly black farmer arrested for the murder of a white man and under threat from the lynch mob is a characteristically Faulknerian tale of dark omen, its sole ray of hope the character of the young white boy who repays an old favour by proving the innocence of the man who saved him from drowning in an icy creek. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZ78B...
اينكه فاكنر شخصيت يك سياه پوست رو با اين ويژگيهاي خاص و مثبت در كتابش ثبت كرده بطوري كه لوكاس سياهپوست يه جورايي ميشه شخصيت طلائي داستان،،جالبه... و اينكه در كليت داستان، دغدغه هاي انساني اي هست كه خيلي جالب توجهه...با اين حال من خيلي باهاش ارتباط برقرار نكردم... ولي كلا از فاكنر خوندن خوشحالم😊
Intruder in the Dust is the first work that I have read by Nobel-prize winning author William Faulkner, but it certainly won't be the last.
This book, published in 1948, centers around black man Lucas Beauchamp accused of murdering a white man and being held in protective custody to prevent his lynching.
"If you got something outside the common run that's got to be done and can't wait, don't waste your time on the menfolks; they works on what your uncle calls the rules and the cases.
Get the womens and the children at it; they works on the circumstances."".
A pesar de esas dificultades de estilo que Faulkner pone en el camino,  Intruso en el polvo  no pierde interés, ya que podría ser tranquilamente una novela policíaca ambientada en los años 40 del Sur de los Estados Unidos.
Podría haber sido un buen foco de análisis para Faulkner, pero está demasiado encorsetado en la separación de los géneros: la novela molesta cuando divide hombres, mujeres y niños (estos últimos dos van juntos, lo cual hace persistente la infantilización de las mujeres) y da cuenta de un complejo panorama de la situación social de la zona.
When explaining our summer reading assingments, our teacher told us to read Intruder In the Dust first, because it was a difficult book.
She said, and I quote, "The book doesn't suck, YOU suck for not being able to understand the book."With that in mind, I would like to say that Intruder In the Dust is a terrible book, but not because of the difficult writing style or lack of interesting characters, but merely because it is three times as long as it needs to be.
So, at its core Intruder in the Dust is an interesting piece of literature.
Dove into this right after Go Down, Moses thanks to Lucas Beauchamp and, well.
I owe him one for that.
I had to keep putting it down mid-page either to laugh or to think, which is the recipe for what I want out of anything.Also, I see a lot of people apple-to-appleing this with To Kill A Mockingbird but I’d say it’s more apple-to-pear: kind of similar enough on the outside but if you take a big bite you’re in for a pretty good surprise.
Βιβλίο που δεν είναι για ανάγνωση στα διαλείμματα της δουλειάς. Θέλει χρόνο και θέλει αφοσίωση, καθότι ολόκληρο είναι γραμμένο σαν σε παραλήρημα. Τεράστιες προτάσεις, χωρίς αναπνοή, με την πλοκή να έχει να χάνεται ανάμεσα στα νοήματα.Στο μύθο του βιβλίου δεν θα σταθώ γιατί... η αλήθεια μου... τον ξέχασα :)
Faulkner is an acquired taste it has taken me years to become accustomed to. This is a nice plot-driven mystery narrated by young Charles Mallison. Published twelve years prior to TKAM it begs for comparison. I'm absolutely impressed that Faulkner took on this subject matter at such an early date. His social commentary,although sometimes a bit wordy, was nonetheless quite valid. This is among my favorite Faulkners now, and I'm still a little surprised I had never been exposed to such an important novel. I now have even greater respect for the author.
I wasn't sure whether to give it 3 or 4 stars! Faulkner's books give you joy and headache at the same time!
Quatro estrelas e meia.
Não cinco porque, apesar de adorar o habitual estilo excessivo do Faulkner, quando este se excede a si próprio, ainda que apenas por um pequeno número de páginas, este excesso diminui o brilho do conjunto.À parte desta ínfima parcela do livro -que, como normalmente sucede, decorre durante as elucubrações filosóficas de Gavin Stevens-, é um belíssimo relato das dolorosas contradições do viver sulista e das imensas, profundas e ainda existentes - persistentes mesmo!
- feridas do racismo e da escravatura.
Mas com uma mensagem de esperança, coragem e sofrida superação que, contudo, não permite ultrapassar a percepcionada (pelo autor) inescapável realidade de não haver “intruso” capaz de acelerar o processo de cura.
Maybe this time with all this much to lose and all this much to gain: Pennsylvania, Maryland, the world, the golden dome of Washington itself to crown with desperate and unbelievable victory the desperate gamble, the cast made two years ago....Long sentences that swirl, a King James sense of Old Testament ponderousness circling from the Godhead around to everyone else -- even to the bystanders who come into town expecting to see the lynching of Lucas Beauchamp -- all this and more.
Just refuse to bear them.I remember, back when I was fourteen years old, how I was banefully influenced by the cadences of Faulkner's prose.
Beauchamp is a particularly memorable character, stiff, proud, himself almost senatorial in bearing, a man who refuses to “act like a nigger”, as his defenders complain.At once simpler and yet more complex than To Kill a Mockingbird, Faulkner’s novel is in essence a mystery thriller.
History does not work like that; history did not work like that.Intruder in the Dust is really quite a simple story, as I have said, no more than a mystery thriller (I’m not going to tell you who killed Vinson, just that it wasn’t Lucas!) But then there is the language, the style and the literary presentation.
‘Just let go:’ which was like telling a man dangling with one hand over a cliff to just hold on: who wanted nothing right now but a chance to let go and relinquish into the nothing of sleep what little of nothing he still had who last night had wanted to go to sleep and could have but didn’t have time and now wanted more than ever to go to sleep and had all the time in the world for the next fifteen minutes[...] only he had forgotten how: or maybe that was it and he didn’t dare relinquish into nothing what little he had left: which was nothing: no grief to be remembered nor pity nor even awareness of shame, no vindication of the deathless aspiration of man by man to man through the catharsis of pity and shame...*[...] because you escape nothing, you flee nothing; the pursuer is what is doing the running and tomorrow night is nothing but one long sleepless wrestle with yesterday’s omissions and regrets...
While this is a damn good book, it's still not one of Faulkner's best. Perhaps that's because it's more accessible than his other novels. Their dense, mystical and mysterious nature is part of their appeal. Essentially Intruder in the Dust is just a murder mystery, almost Hardy Boys-esque at times. However, Faulkner's incredible use of language, acrobatic sentences, and moral theorizing elevate this book well beyond the basic dime store novel.
Parece-me até que os temas do racismo e outros preconceitos ligados ao sul - talvez até o assassinato - são utilizados para distrair da resolução do crime (que não se resolve numa sala fechada diante dos nossos olhos).
Em minha opinião, o foco está nas contas, da liberdade que temos e permitimos a outros - Chick cai a um lago e é salvo por Lucas que nunca aceita a sua paga em dinheiro; Vinson é atirado para as areias movediças depois de ter sido roubado por Crawford.
Ένα δύσκολο βιβλίο, δυσανάγνωστο και πυκνό υφολογικά.
Η μετάφραση το έκανε ακόμα πιο δύσκολο.
Σε κάποια σημεία ο Κορτώ δεν κράτησε μεταφραστικά το ύφος του κειμένου και χρησιμοποίησε λέξεις σύγχρονου λεξιλογίου ή καλύτερα της σημερινής ζωής.
Ο μόνος λόγος που με βοήθησε να ολοκληρώσω το συγκεκριμένο βιβλίο είναι η προσπάθεια για την απόκτησή του μιας και είχε εξαντληθεί από τον εκδοτικό οίκο.
Συνεπώς ταύτισα τον αγώνα για την αγορά του με τον αγώνα για την ολοκλήρωσή του.
Δεν ξέρω αν θα συνιστούσα σε κάποιον να το διαβάσει...ωστόσο θα ήθελα να δω αν και κάποιος άλλος αναγνώστης θα έχει την ίδια άποψη με την δική μου.


You know you're in unexplored territory when William Faulkner writes a murder mystery, although "Intruder in the Dust" is more of a 1940s police procedural set in the Deep South and narrated by a sixteen year old boy (albeit in the third person) than a traditional whodunnit.
That boy happens to be Chick Mallison, who also appears elsewhere in the Faulkner canon (eg.
(No Snopeses or Sartorises to speak of in this one -- sorry in advance to the groupies!) "Intruder" is a bit more reflective than many of Faulkner's novels (we hear much of the philosophy of Lawyer Gavin Stevens, Chick's uncle, which addresses the "race question" in ways both authentic and unsettling to modern ears), but the characters are drawn with the usual precision and insight.
You really should read this one.What is sad about Intruder is that it could have been an absolutely brilliant book if Faulkner hadn't been all caught up in that stream of consciousness thing.
It falls upon Chick, a young black boy named Aleck, and an elderly white woman named Miss Habersham to find the evidence that will set Lucas Beauchamp free.In some ways this book brings to mind To Kill a Mockingbird (and it's obvious that Intruder must have had influence on Harper Lee).
It is underlined in Gavin Stevens' comment to Chick at the end of the book:Some things you must always be unable to bear.
