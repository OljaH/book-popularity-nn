I read this book while I was in college, not because I had to, but because so many people were talking about gestalt therapy, I wanted to learn more about it. The three authors give a comprehensive overview of gestalt therapy, while at the same time acknowledging that what they are getting at has to be experienced: there are really no words to describe it.
The "bible" of gestalt therapy. Dense in theory in the second half, but vitally important if one wants to really understand gestalt therapy.
I love Gestalt's focus on the present.
Essential
The second half of this book, which is actually mostly the work of anarchist Paul Goodman, is an excellent expression of a phenomenological egoist relationship with the world. Well worth reading despite the use of psychoanalytic language. Too bad the book is generally credited to Perls who really wrote very little of it. The first half is mainly Hefferline's work, the second half mainly Paul Goodman's... I highly recommend reading the second half, and then, if you want to play with the ideas, go ahead and read the first half with some friends and do the experiments as games....
4 stars for Gestalt as a therapy practice. 3 stars for the 1950's scientific writing style which can be quite a headache to read.Separation of mind and body is not possible. We are our environment.If you are curious on the subject, this feels like an appropriate place to start. I'm looking forward to reading another book on the subject... but where to start?

Хорошая книга, временами посещали важные инсайты, однако русскому изданию и тексту не хватает аккуратности оформления.
A handbook.
