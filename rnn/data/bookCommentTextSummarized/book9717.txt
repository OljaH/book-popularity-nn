3.5“Everybody always knows something," said Adam, "even if it's something they don't know they know.”Of course, there is a crime (actually, more than one -yay) but there is also espionage and international conspiracies and I enjoyed it far more than I thought I would. Cat Among Pigeons definitely is a quite peculiar adventure for Poirot, but nonetheless our Belgian detective solves it as brilliantly as ever. Besides, I simply adored the epilogue. So cute and poignant.
When I first began this challenge a fellow Goodreads member, paulie, predicted that I would probably solve a case by August!
That's why I feel myself only giving it a 3 star review because A.C. made it too easy and took too long exploring the characters that the motives for all were explicit  and I feel a bit sad for Hercule Poiriot that he was forced to get himself involved in the case.
What a snob that fella is and I just love the amount of malice that the Inspector in the case had for him.
I loved all the detail about the school in this novel, which is why I gave it four stars. The plot is not one of Agatha's best, though it's not bad. But, as in Hickory Dickory Dock, Poirot presents much of the solution without telling us how he came to work it out, and Agatha novels work best when we are able to follow the workings of Poirot's mind more closely. However, all the school stuff makes this novel enjoyable and atmospheric.
Foreigners are much more precocious than English girls.” The Headmistress thinks this may be the brandy talking, but also chides Miss Johnson not to be “too insular.”But yes, there is more than multiculturalism in Cat Among the Pigeons; there’s also murder at Meadowbank (a better title, I think).
I thought you would want to know.”The mystery begins in the Palace of Ramat, with a Prince Ali Yusuf, followed by a couple murders, some missing jewels, leading to Meadowbank, where young (and precocious) Shaista is a student.
I didn't like this one quite as much as the other two I've read so far, and I'm not sure why. If Mrs. Upjohn recognized someone at the school who she knew from her previous life in intelligence work and knew this person was a trained killer, why would she leave her daughter in the same school and then travel the world? I hate to say that it's a plot hole, but it bothered me slightly.
Poirot fans will be disappointed that the diminutive Belgian does not come into this one until very late in this story about murders and mayhem at a prestigious all-girls school. This is not a bad A.C. as things go though. Nice set up and an interest international plot. However, I'd just read Dorothy Sayers Gaudy Night and it handles the almost exact same scenario with more finesse.
The girl's school setting is fun: it gives her rein to use all the stereotypes and to demolish them.This particular book was on Natasha's shelf, which is why I didn't get to it during my Christie run.
Saturday night she comes to tell me goodnight and to ask if I know why the book is there.
And even though I can't remember what day it is, I was able to tell her that she picked it out at a library book sale, because she recognized the author.
It's like Christie, to keep herself amused in the umpteenth Poirot story, has started using alienation techniques.
As if what we have here is Agatha Christie in her Samuel Beckett phase.However, more jarring than that was encountering the phrase "sex craved teenager" in a Poirot novel.
Hercule Poirot great detective of country house mysteries of the 1930s should no more be near a sex craved teenager, than he should buy a pint for P.J. Proby.It's an interesting book then, an odd book too – but one that definitely needs more old school Poirot.
Cara Agatha… le tue trame sono sempre piacevoli e ben orchestrate. Gli eventi ben intrecciate e "ingarbugliati" al punto giusto; i personaggi si muovono con agilità sullo sfondo della tua Inghilterra. È un piacere passare una serata in tua compagnia. ^^(A breve una recensione un po' più precisa e non uno sbrodolo di ammirazione per la Christie XD) -- Post sviolinata --Voto: 3,5Non è semplice gestire un giallo: la trama deve essere avvincente senza rivelare troppo, ma consentendo al lettore di ra

^^(A breve una recensione un po' più precisa e non uno sbrodolo di ammirazione per la Christie XD) -- Post sviolinata --Voto: 3,5½Non è semplice gestire un giallo: la trama deve essere avvincente senza rivelare troppo, ma consentendo al lettore di ragionare procedendo di pari passo con l'investigatore di turno.
E, sebbene vi siano alcuni appunti (come la vicenda che poi non appassiona più di tanto; i personaggi tratteggiati, ma molto rapidamente, ect.), i romanzi della "Signora del Giallo" raggiungono sempre il loro scopo: intrattenere il lettore.
اعتقد ان مستوى الرواية اقل بكثير من الروايات السابقة والشخصيات كثيرة والأسماء متشابهة ولَم يتم التركيز على الشخصيات وأعمالها ونفسياتهم بل تم التركيز على الأحداث فقط وصورة سابقة لإحدى الشخصيات من مكان عملها السابق وانتظار احدى الشخصيات الى نهاية الرواية للتتعرف على المجرمة
Ca fiecare carte pe care am citit-o de la Agatha Christie : PERFECTĂ!
Another well written, finely crafted classic. Agatha Christie’s books are so timeless. This could have been written 60 days ago, but it was actually written 60 years ago! Poirot doesn’t actually appear until about 60% of the way in - which was fine by me as for some reason I thought this was a stand-alone. Not sure how, but I failed to notice / realise that this was actually a Poirot, so his appearance was a pleasant surprise.
I love the historical and social insight that comes ‘as standard’ with an Agatha Christie – presented, of course, through the prism of the author’s own life experience and privileged background.
This novel was published in 1959 – the war and rationing had been left behind, a new world order was emerging, and the Middle East was beginning to flex its muscles.That said – there were certain idiosyncrasies that left me a little bamboozled.In particular, this is billed as a Poirot mystery.
I rather suspect that Agatha Christie had realised her detectives were stumped, and resorted to Poirot’s super-human powers!Secondly, when the ‘true’ story finally became clear, I did feel it was somewhat contrived.
Cơ mà cách triển khai cốt truyện của Madam Christie hay quá thể, nên là cứ ôm sách mà đọc liền tù tì không dứt :D Cực thích cái cách tác giả xây dựng ngôi trường nội trú tư thục nữ Meadowbank, một nơi lẽ ra phải là chốn an toàn, yên bình cho các cô gái học tập, hóa ra lại trở thành hiện trường của những vụ sát nhân.
Gostei imenso, é daqueles livros que mantém os mistérios até ao fim e que, no meu caso, me surpreendeu bastante.
I really enjoyed the fact that the first 100 pages are more of a novel of manners than a mystery, focusing on the development of interesting characters at a girls' boarding school.
This would be one of her best but for two detractions: first, it is very odd to bring in Poirot 200 pages in, as a sort of deux ex machina, especially when one of the students has proved herself an apt amateur detective and put together most of the pieces already.
It feels like a forced effort to bring in the popular detective, likely as a selling point so that the cover can say "a Hercule Poirot novel"!
the very first - from such a long list of - agatha christie's detective novels i've read. quite a 'right' choice because the story reminds me of the more familiar enid blyton's boarding schools' series (i.e. mallory towers), but with such expanded plots that includes romance, theft and murder. very juicy indeed. i could even remember that i skipped sleeping that night just to finish this novel, and succeeded doing so in less than 48 hours. this novel was probably the one that triggered my crave (or hunger?) for ms. christie's other works.love "cat among pigeons" much.
I was so in the mood for this. Murder at a posh all girls boarding school. Lucky that I found a copy in the library of my hotel for a beach read.
The Poirot books are boring when we focus too much on other people.
I wish that we had Poirot involved from the beginning so at least he didn't come in as a side character.
The main character in this book from beginning to end was Julia Upjohn.
And you can read at times at how old/odd Poirot is to other people.
I often read that Agatha Christie disliked Poirot as a character as she got older.
The overall plot really didn't work for me at all.
It lead to just a lot of confusion with such a huge cast of characters.
3.5 stars
Bob yang kebingungan akhirnya menyelipkan permata tersebut dalam barang bawaan kakaknya yang akan kembali ke Inggris.Ternyata benar, bahwa permata membuat beberapa pihak tergiur dan mengincarnya, bahkan tanpa ragu menjadikan nyawa tak lagi berharga, pembunuhan pun terjadi.
Hukum siapa yang mendapatkan, berarti dialah pemiliknya, menjadi berlaku.Namun, permata tersebut tidak semudah itu didapat karena Bob telah menyelipkan permata di tempat yang tidak diduga, dan menggiring pengincarnya harus menyusup ke dalam sekolah Meadowbank.
Tapi, lama kelamaan karena mengikuti gaya deskripsi dan alur cerita Agatha Christie yang rapi membuat saya mudah membayangkan para tokohnya, dan mulai bisa menempatkan ingatan setiap kali nama tokoh disebutkan.
قتلی در دبیرستان دخترانه مدوبانک صورت می گیرد، اسم اصلی کتاب گربه در میان کبوترها

I many ways this book is a let down. The plot is weak and there are just too many coincidences. The story to an extent is based on the schooling pattern popular amongst the elite during Christie's time. Halfway through the novel, i started losing interest and it was only the drive to finish it, that i ended up reading the last page. Quite a bore
This is my last Agatha Christie - for now.
It was a nice trip down the memory lane, for three of the four novels I read were actually re-readings.Not this one, and a pleasant surprise it was.
With a subject so flashy (coup d'état in an Arab state and a legacy of jewels) it would have been easy for the author to slip into kitsch.
not Agatha Christie, though, who reveals herself not only a master of mystery but also a skilful observer of the young girls psychology.
A very interesting touch was the delay of the main hero (Hercule Poirot, of course), who enters the scene in the second part of the novel.
This book really makes me wish Christie wrote school stories as well as mysteries and thrillers. Really enjoyable thriller/murder mystery set in a boarding school, with intrepid young ladies and an awe-inspiring headmistress mixed up with international intrigue. Poirot comes in right at the end, grandfatherly and kind, to save the day. The best part, though, is the boarding school setting, the students and the teachers.
A questo punto, una delle studentesse del Collegio riuscirà a mettersi in contatto con Poirot nella speranza che il famoso investigatore belga metta fine a questa vicenda.Lo sfondo su cui prende forma l’intera vicenda è quello di una cospirazione politica: in un remoto reame dell’Asia, qualche tempo prima, sono accaduti sanguinosi avvenimenti che hanno portato alla morte il principe Alì; i Servizi Segreti, prontamente allertati, sono da subito propensi a mettere in relazione l’omicidio avvenuto nell’Istituto con questi fatti.Christie in questo romanzo è riuscita a caratterizzare molto bene l’ambientazione, descrivendo nei minimi particolari non solo l’attività scolastica del Collegio ma anche caratteristiche fisiche e comportamentali di professori e studenti.
Poi c’è la signorina Chadwick (noi la chiamiamo Chaddy) che insegna qui da quando hanno fondato il collegio.
Sukaaa 😆😆😆😆 Feel cerita nya mirip waktu baca pembunuhan di pondok mahasiswa. Dengan karakter yang banyak dan diceritakan dari sudut pandang berbeda dari tiap-tiap tokoh. Hampir saja terkecoh dengan pembunuh nya dan tiga kasus pembunuhan dengan pembunuh berbeda.
He feels like an afterthought, brought in to wrap it all up and bring in some readers.However, despite that, the actual story and intrigue is excellent.
The best of everything!It all feels far more detailed than some Poirot stories, rich in plot, environment and location with a cracking opening sequence.
You can read a lot of Christie's thoughts on her fellow women here.
The private school setting works wonderfully and there's an awful lot to like throughout.So, despite not really being a Poirot story, this is Christie at her best.
Well worth reading for a riveting story, a great intrigue and a lovely school setting.
