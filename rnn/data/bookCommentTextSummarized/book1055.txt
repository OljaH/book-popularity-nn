As a young child, I would lose myself for hours in the simple world of the wood and pond inhabited by Little Joe Otter, Buster Bear, Grandfather Frog, and terrorized by Farmer Brown's Boy. I can remember the very shelf, even the exact spot in the little library in Felton, CA where these books were kept.
I do not recall if Old Man Coyote plays a role in Danny Field Mouse's story or the other way around, but this concept was presented several times.
My father and mother gave me this book when I was in 3rd grade in the 1950s.
It wasn't my first Burgess book (I had already read Lightfoot the Deer).
I was impressed (though I'm sure I didn't know that concept then) how the author made these talking animals real by his great understanding of the natural world.
The reader learns to sense the relationships between wild animals and their habitats and food supplies, their need for shelter, and so on.
While Buster Bear is aimed at children, its accurate images of nature are special and rare glimpses into a world most people will not themselves get to know.
This is one of the best of the books in Burgess's stories of the animals in the Green Forest.It is full of great lessons for kids, framed in engaging and funny situations.
I liked it. It's about Buster Bear's twins and he almost eats them cause he doesn't know it's his twins. Most of it's about Boxer.
I liked it. It's how Buster Bear has twins, but he almost tries to eat them cause he didn't know he had them and he didn't want any other bears in the Green forest.
