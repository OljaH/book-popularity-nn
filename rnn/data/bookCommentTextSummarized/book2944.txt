she writes that almost all present were working women, 'but it was decided from the first that the Union should be entirely independent of Class and Party.'As I say, I found Emmeline Pankhurst quite infuriating around issues of class, but Sylvia was already much more thoughtful about the meaning of struggle and victory for women in different stations.
The relationship between Annie and both Christobel and Emmeline made me worry deeply for her after reading Emmeline's book on the movement, but she seems to have greatly inspired Sylvia with an honest respect for working women.
The Top 10 Books About the SuffragettesSylvia Pankhurst’s book is a comprehensive first-hand account of the suffragette movement. Part memoir, part historical narrative, she takes us from her humble childhood to her friendship with Independent Labour Party founding member Keir Hardie, to her split from the main WSPU to form the East London Federation of Suffragettes. The allegations of torture in Perth prison are chilling, as is the passage in which Pankhurst reports the return of suffragettes from an Albert Hall meeting: “They came in ones and twos, bruised and disheveled …”
A wonderful read about how it all began. Sometimes it's a bit difficult to read because of the long sentences.
