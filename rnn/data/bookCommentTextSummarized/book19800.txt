But then again, most seventeen-year olds haven’t come face-to-face with death almost half a dozen times before their first kiss either.In Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, the seventh and final installment of the ridiculously popular Harry Potter series, J.K. Rowling brilliantly ties up every loose end that she has planted over the last ten years since the very first outing of the series was published in 1997.
Subtle references such as this are a large part of what makes Rowling’s books so enjoyable to re-read as there are always deeper meanings and additional allusions that are often only discovered via multiple read-throughs.Harry’s bold statement regarding his own potential death is also a prime example of how much Rowling truly wrote Harry’s last tale for her long-time fans.
It's hard for me to believe that I finished the Harry Potter series...
I wish this series would go on forever!I don't know how I've gone through my life without these books.
The characters are engaging and brilliant, and I love how the plot is so interwoven and twisted within itself, especially in this last book.I was taken by surprise when I started the series, I didn't think it would pull me in as it did.
As I kept reading through the books, the characters slyly stole my heart.
The characters have lost much of what made them endearing, and the plot has gone to hell.Focusing on Deathly Hallows, I had a very strong feeling that six months before her deadline, JKR went on to the internet, discovered that everyone had guessed her 'twists' (honestly, who didn't know that Harry was an accidental Horcrux, RAB was Sirius's brother, the diadem was at Hogwarts, the locket was at Grimmauld Place, Dumbledore ordered Snape to kill him, Snape was in love with Lily and Ron would be a it and abandon Harry and Hermione?), and felt the need to come up with a new plot device.
All was well.
Sigh... I just can't
I hadn't read this book in so long... it's been great to reread it and notice all the details I had forgotten!It was perfect for the holidays (even though this one is quite dark!)
This is just a pithy review on the Harry Potter series as a whole. It is not an in-depth analysis of the work in general, nor is it a review on any one particular installment.Harry Potter is a work of art. I got made fun of once when I was out to dinner with some friends, because while we were discussing these books I made the mistake of referring to them as “literature.” I felt like I had to defend that assertion because, although the definition of literature is pretty broad, it seems like it s
In this case, my friends were wrong—Rowling explores themes and concepts in this series that I think are valuable to children and young adults who look to her characters for qualities they seek to emulate, and I believe her works will have lasting impact on this and future generations.I’ve heard it said before that everything you need to know you’ve learned in kindergarten.
Well, that might be somewhat of an oversimplification, but I do think children or young adults who grow into this series, seeing Harry and his friends mature as they themselves mature, can glean some pretty important life lessons from it.
(A) 86% | ExtraordinaryNotes: It ends too expository and convenient, but the story’s compelling, and its new settings are a nice break from formula.

I loved my #AdamRereadsHP series read so much, especially with Jim Dale's audiobook. This remains the series of my heart.
It was the end of an era, and then it wasn't.I can't express how thankful I am, for this series, for this world, for the magic, power and love behind J.K. Rowling's words.
I don't know what I would be without Harry Potter.It's crazy how much time I spend reading the books, listening to the audiobooks, watching the films or just thinking about them.
Power and influence of the media, slavery, dictatorship, revolution, feminism, depression, death, loss, equality, love, friendship.J.K. Rowling is probably one of the most important teachers to every child (and adult) reading her books.
It felt like the book didn't know what to do with the characters if they didn't have Hogwarts classes to get to.• I'm annoyed that the Slytherins were still labelled at the end as "badies".
(I am a defensive Slytherin, FYI.)• And speaking of Slytherin's...I kind of thought Harry and Draco might've (view spoiler)[made up or something??
(hide spoiler)] Apparently all the stuff I'd gleaned from the internet is wishful thinking wow.• There was VERY cliche Voldemort-must-monologue-before-he-kills-stuff scene.• To be realistic...Harry should've passed out from FOOD DEPRIVATION.
this year (and every year), i am immensely thankful for books; but in particular, this series.
i know im not original when i say the harry potter books are what made me fall in love with reading.
the series taught me the value of empathy, that courage comes in many different forms, the importance of having and being a true friend, that love is the greatest power above all, and most importantly, it taught me to believe in magic.
i would not be who i am today without these books and i love that stories have the power to do that, to change lives for the better.

I felt how it's different than the movie,The characters more alive ,forcing you to feel that they're your friends, like you're already living with them in the School of Witchcraft and Wizardry,it was like my other HomeI finished the series in Arabic and start it in English 2 years ago,It was still fresh and as thrilling, emotional ,great as ever.Here I'll try to stick to review that part of the series only ,till I write more about the experince of living The Harry Potter SagaThe Plot********Remember before book 7 release how were we been feeling?**Harry still got 4 Horcruxes to find -and even to know what it'll be- and even how to destroy it.**And then Fight the 7th Part of the shuttered soul...Voldemort himself, his Death Eaters and the traitor Snape.
I’m thrilled to say that I managed to follow through with at least one book related commitment this year, and that was to read the entire Harry Potter series for the first time.
As the dark tension that began growing at the finish of the Goblet of Fire has come full circle, I felt this was the perfect finale to a (rightfully) highly acclaimed series.
I can't believe its finally time for my first read through of the Harry Potter books to come to an end, but I'm also dying to read this one and see how it compares to the film.

(Sorry, British people, but I think we can all agree that a freezing/damp moor is no tropical vacation.) (Also shoutout to the time when Harry, Ron and Hermione overheard other wizards saying “Accio salmon” in order to eat and were just like, That information’s going straight in the mental trash can.)But then on TOP of it, the pacing is so!!
It's a coming of age story for our whole generation, whether or not we received our Hogwarts letters.And we were there together.
I can't think of the number of people who I've bonded with over these stories--people who I wouldn't have thought to have much in common with in the first place.
We came from all different backgrounds, much like the 4 houses, and joined in the Battle of Hogwarts.We mourned the deaths of beloved characters.And cheered on the sheer wit and bravery of others.We debated what Harry should have done with the Elder Wand.But we never let go of this world.
I always wonder how the characters are doing after a series ends🤔
2017 - I DID IT! I finished rereading the HP series with less than 3 hours left in the year WOOP2016 - This is the fourth time I read this particular book and this time I listened to the audiobook narrated by Stephen Fry and IT WAS AMAZING <3Around the Year in 52 Books Challenge Notes - 38. A book about an anti-hero (I kind of cheated - it only features an anti-hero)

I accept though with the heaviest heart that certain characters needed to die, needed to sacrifice their lives for the greater good but I find no good reason for the death of (view spoiler)[Fred!
Also, don’t you think (view spoiler)[Professor Severus Snape (hide spoiler)] deserved a better, more respectful way to die?
Characters in the next books I read could all die and I probably wouldn’t shed a tear.
I remember when the hardback came out. Wal-Mart was having a big to do at midnight but I worked 3rd shift at the post office at that time. I stopped by after work around 7 ish am and there were a few copies left. I was so excited and I ended up not getting much sleep and was tired that night at work because I couldn't put the book down. And I cried and cried. I still do. Some of these books do that to me no matter how many times I read the books. Happy Reading! Mel 🖤🐾🐺
Here are three reasons why this book is dynamite:1. This series never lost any momentum and here it ended spectacularly in such a dramatic final confrontation. 2. Rowling shows us that even the nastiest of people deserve a degree of sympathy. Draco’s story was more complex than we realised. He was never the person he secretly wanted to be: a good man. 3.This scene was written superbly, the saddest moment of the series for me.
3rd: August 2018 (audiobook)Listening to this on audiobook was a dream come true. It was like watching a 100% faithful adaptation of the book. Perfection 😭💕I LOVED my re-read of the series via the Stephen Fry audiobooks. It was magical. ✨2nd read: Feb-April 2018I. Am. Dead. I already want to re-read the series again 😭
REVIEW TO COME TOMORROW 'Do not Pity the dead, Harry. Pity the living, and above all, those who live without love.' it still feels weird to me me for finishing this series. I mean, I had read this series since August and I feel really ... weird. I feel like I just bought the first book yesterday instead of months ago.

many people called her " Loony " because she believed in many things but Luna didn't care what they called her, she kept being herself and she had never ashamed to show her true self and that was the time I realized I was such a stupid girl who let my so-called friends changed me to be the girl I didn't even want me to be and now, my friends often say that I am such a weirdo or crazy girl who is very different from them because I love reading books so much and you know what?
“The damage that is done, in some cases with very dark magic, is done permanently.”Rowling said Neville finds happiness in his grandmother’s acceptance of him as a gifted wizard and as the new herbology professor at Hogwarts.The fate of HogwartsNineteen years after the Battle of Hogwarts, the school for witchcraft and wizardry is led by an entirely new headmaster (“McGonagall was really getting on a bit”) as well as a new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher.
no one ask me about the book bc i literally remember nothing from it. also the ending was cute. also im bitter about (view spoiler)[ FRED AND LUPIN AND DOBBY DYING WHY THE HELL (hide spoiler)]~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~look at me finishing this series :') and it only took 20 years im not even kidding herei feel like this is an unpopular opinion but.....i kinda hardcore ship hermione and ron bye
I started the Harry Potter audio books at the end of August 2016. It took me a little over 4 months to listen to them all (I fit a few others in-between) but I’m so happy I finally finished. If you haven’t read them before, or you’re a long time fan looking for a re-read I can’t recommend the audio books enough. Jim Dale does a fantastic job with the narration. I can see myself going back one day and listening to them all over again! Now to the final book of the series: Harry Potter and the Dea

If you haven’t read them before, or you’re a long time fan looking for a re-read I can’t recommend the audio books enough.
Now to the final book of the series: Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows.
To be honest, the first part of the book (and by first part, I mean the first 70-80% or so) was a little slow for me.
“Do not pity the dead, Harry. Pity the living, and, above all those who live without love.”  Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows literally touched the deepest part of my heart. This book has many layers and each one was refined by the smartest author I've ever known. J.K. Rowling always has a plan, she never threw anything into her books without thinking it first. In this case, I think she planned the ending of this book since she started writing for sure, and every point she emphasized in HP
“Do not pity the dead, Harry.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows literally touched the deepest part of my heart.
J.K. Rowling always has a plan, she never threw anything into her books without thinking it first.
In this case, I think she planned the ending of this book since she started writing for sure, and every point she emphasized in HP 7 was unfaltering and made me believe that it's a pure diamond when she ended her story with an epic score.
Harry, Ron and Hermione prove themselves that they're just ordinary humans.
This book is EVERYTHING.
