A very worthy read.A few caveats (depending on your taste):1) The language is delightfully archaic at times, so that's great fun but occasionally confuses younger folk like myself!2) There are a variety of editions.
I know we live in an era of Wikipedia, but one of the delights of a book like this is its source as an all-out reference guide.3) Truth be told - even though I just praised the length - I sometimes wish there was a brief synopsis preceding each detailed plot summary.4) And, admittedly, I could've used a few more pages on each composer's musical style and reputation.
This is, from what I've read, the definitive book on opera.
As the flyleaf says, "Kobbe is to opera what Bartlett is to quotations." At least in whatever is the latest edition--I admit this one is somewhat dated, having been published in 1987.
What I like so much about this book is not just that each opera has a discussion of the music and a synopsis of the story, but landmark productions are noted, so you'd know that up to 1987 at least, that famous singers in the title role of La Traviata include Patti, Melba, Tetrazzini, Ponselle, Schwarzkopf, Callas, Freni, etc.
How do I love this book... I would sit in my dad's apartment and peruse the different stories, crack it open whenever we were talking about a composer and started wondering what other works they'd written, tried my best to sight sing just what Elektra's "Agamemmnon" sounded like. It's my nostalgia machine for my lifelong operalove.
I am an halfway Opera fan. I am unschooled. I turn to Kobb√©'s before I hear one.
