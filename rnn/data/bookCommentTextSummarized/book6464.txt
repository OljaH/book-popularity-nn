I was looking at the English-language "Sri Lankan literature" section on the second floor of the mercifully air conditioned building after roaming around the hot streets for about forty five minutes looking for this particular book store, when one of the salesmen approached me.
He picked out this book, translated as "Uprooted" in my copy, saying that Wickramasinghe was one of the authors who helped revolutionize Sri Lankan literature.
I actually really enjoyed this book, and if I had read it in Sinhala (original language) and if I knew more about the Sri Lankan culture and religion, I'm sure it would have been more meaningful and enjoyable.
A beautiful book!A classic which will never ever get old!

I haven't read the Sinhala one, but I'm assuming there were nuances the translation missed out on.
Reading after a decade as an adult. I was able to grasp more nuances in the story. One of the greatest books ever written in Srilankan Literature by a well-versed scholar Martin Wickramasinghe.
