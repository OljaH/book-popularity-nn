I will defend this book's subtle intelligence to the ends of the Earth.
Garland's performative act--seducing us with the myth of perfect travel, deftly balancing the naive hypocrisies of Westerners rooting out the exotic in the East--creates a brutal ending that recasts what had led up to it.
While Garland could have easily stopped with a cautionary tale, he went further by lacing his character's thoughts not with literary allusions, but filmic ones.
Which 20-something British kid wouldn't think of "Apocalypse Now" while foraging through the jungle in Thailand?Also, this title's in my Desert Island picks because it doubles as a survival guide.
Seduced with the promise of a perfect hideout, the reader sets on along with Richard on a riveting and spectacular adventure.
Everything about this book is well done, and it transports the reader into a dream of most Western travelers - a perfect island, unspoiled by commercial culture and an ideal place for idealistic people to set up.
A fast and furious novel that transports the reader into another place, much like Golding's Lord of the Flies.
Great, bizarry, chilling story, keeps you turning the pages til the end. In the top of my booklist definitely.Note 2018 after this book came up again in my goodreads library: another 'classic' which I really found intriguing back then. Need to reread definitely.
Two devices I particularly enjoyed were the passage of time (which pretty much flies by for us and the characters in such a way that you don't even notice it is) and the way Garland gives the reader small breaks from the island by delving into memories of sweet childhood.
Very nicely done.Some criticism: the only thing about this book that really made me groan was pretty much everything involving *ahem* Daffy Duck.
Too there's-something-funny-about-that-island for my taste.On the back cover of this edition Nick Hornby(!) called it a "Lord of the Flies for Generation X." Generation X schma aside, this book is a great update of Golding's classic and well worth the weekend (or long plane ride) of non-stop reading you're bound to spend with it.
For my part, I didn't really feel like there was much of a story at all for most of the book, but then, maybe I just didn't see it because I'm not the type that would.
Actually, I take that back, I liked the main character, Richard, in the beginning, and then lost it as I kept reading.
which again is out of place, because there's this underlying feeling of confusion and chaos, but very little is actually happening in the story, plot-wise.
Richard -- who we later learn is mending a broken heart with as much exotic travel and dope as he can fit in -- narrates the story with the self-awareness of a twenty-something who's consumed every Vietnam War movie ever made, beginning with Apocalypse Now. He checks into one of the many guest houses on the Ko Sanh Road which cater to young French, German, Swedish or American backpackers looking to escape whatever future awaits them back home.
Started & finished this within 5 days. Fantastic, i LOVED it. Much darker than the film.
Gorgeous, Cynical, Well-Observed Believe it or not, despite the hints throughout about dark and terrible things to come, this novel doesn't really turn dark until around the last fifth.Until then it's beautiful scenery, well-observed love triangles and petty dislikes, and a new traveller trying to get to, and then assimilate into, the hidden island paradise known as the beach. However, our boy, English narrator Richard, was originally given a map to the beach by an angry/disturbed guy he met in
Believe it or not, despite the hints throughout about dark and terrible things to come, this novel doesn't really turn dark until around the last fifth.Until then it's beautiful scenery, well-observed love triangles and petty dislikes, and a new traveller trying to get to, and then assimilate into, the hidden island paradise known as the beach.
Though he does eventually do some terrible things, it's his shrewd observation, thirst for adventure, and just the right amount of cynicism and pettiness to stay entirely believable, which really makes this narrative work.
I really wish the copy I read didn't have shirtless Leonardo DiCaprio on it.
The trick is that no matter what is happening or not happening on any given page, I was totally engrossed the entire time.
I was right back on the beach, real life immediately falling away.
Garland concentrates on the minutiae of beach life to draw us in and make us more than just a voyeur, but a participant.
(view spoiler)[The ease with which Richard is able to smother the long suffering Swede is chilling.
(hide spoiler)]Life on the beach did not repulse me, but I do not long for that kind of existence and cannot relate to that desire to cut oneself off from society, family, friends, history.
I've put off writing anything about this hoping that I'd be able to drag my weary disinterest through to the end of the novel...unfortunately that never occurred.
Maybe it's because of having done the itinerant traveller thing, or maybe it was because the book felt too contrived, or maybe....I expected something else or something more.
This just didn't do it for me.If you haven't backpacked through Asia, I guess this book could be an interesting read...and if you had, it might be chock-a-block full of reminisces for you and be worth a trip down memory lane.
All in all, not quite a disappointment but nothing to really write home about.
As a tourist, traveller, exile or expat.
I liked the story, atmosphere and the adventurous quality of this book. But I thought the writer struggled with his descriptions. He didn't always manage to convey the characters' emotions or thoughts in a convincing and natural way, nor did some of the scenes seem fluent. Plus I really disliked the protagonist, Richard. His immature, superficial macho behaviour got old really fast.3.5 stars
Given time, Shangri-La never is.You must grow up and live in the real world, complicated and unpleasant as it may be.
Richard, age 21, goes to Thailand and finds his way to a hidden settlement on a secluded island that is supposed to be off-limits to tourists.
Eventually it all dissolves in a rather grisly fashion.It was disturbing to me that Richard saw the whole thing almost as a game, even after all the horror.
3.5 stars, but I can be generous and round up to 4 because the youthful author showed a convincing grasp of group dynamics and self-interested behavior.
His short descriptions of the characters are beyond adequate, as he lets you immediately understand the person.
Richard, the main character, is both elusive and relate-able -- he's an enjoyable character for me because I could see myself in him.
Everything about this book is well done, well captued -- the setting in "Thailand" or a Utopian island, the characters from the cook who's obsessed with scented soap to the Harvard students who play up pothead stereotypes to see Europeans react.
Then there is Richard's relationship with an imaginary (?) friend ...
The book's excitement compels you to keep reading its short chapters.
Having seen the film a couple of times, I was worried it would ruin my experience of the book, but not at all. This was a great read, and quite hard to put down, as I wanted to know what was going to happen next (even having seen the film). The film and the book version feel like two very separate things to me.
Richard, a young English traveller, is given a map in Bangkok by a man named Daffy Duck, who promptly commits suicide.
The map leads Richard to a secret beach, where a commune of travellers live in apparent paradise.
While Garland clearly draws on knowledge accrued while he was travelling himself, there's no show-off quality about it: he merely drops in hints of exoticism that not only enhance the novel's scenery but also forward the plot.The Beach is truly a rare pleasure: a fun read that's also profoundly literary.
I like how Alex Garland portrayed the characters in this book.
I especially liked how he presented Richard's character.
He's the kind of character I neither like nor dislike.
I've watched the movie sometime ago and I liked it a lot.
The movie kind of missed the point the point the author clearly made in the book.
Plus, Richard is supposed to be English (which Leo DiCaprio is clearly not) and he doesn't have sex with anyone.
Where as, the movie decided to add a sex scene (I think it was just one 🤔) which was after all unnecessary.
I still like the movie but the book was much better.
Don't get me wrong, this was entertaining, but also flawed: All of the characters (except the French guy) were horrible people, the Vietnam War parallels didn't work for me, and I think there was probably a way to show (view spoiler)[the main character was (kind of) losing his mind (hide spoiler)] besides (view spoiler)[having him hallucinate a dead guy over and over (hide spoiler)]—although that felt like a very 1990s touch.
Also the writing was kind of meh and their island "paradise" sounded totally horrible to me and I kept hoping they would come to their senses and just get out of there.
I will now content myself with reading S's sister's excellent travel blog and leave the backpacking to young, cheerful people.By virtue of Wikipedia I have learned that Alex Garland wrote this, his first book, at an early age (his bio blurb in the back notes the year of his birth, which is publishing-speak for "hot young thing") supposedly to excoriate the backpacker culture of privileged hot young things trying to out-backpack everyone by being the first to get there and experience, whatever.
Like when Richard the narrator asks the creepy, fascist leader Sal (played by a very creepy Tilda Swinton in the movie) what the idyllic secret beach community is, she screws with him by saying it's a beach resort for travelers on holiday.
They traveled."Like those deep thoughts, the rest of the book is not that good or profound.
It seems rather fitting that I would finish The Beach by Alex Garland today, as this book is a bit of a mind fuck, and the day of the Irish tends towards the same.
I know that Golding did it first so when I feel the pull between my favourite character in his work and a similar character within The Beach I do know which is the artifice, however, Garland's character development was both better and more interesting.
If you enjoyed Lord of the Flies I highly recommend The Beach by Alex Garland!
This book is of course way better than the movie.The movie was watered down, warped, and completely missed the point Garland tried to make in his astonishingly succesful first novel.
The first half of the book is incredible and really gets deep into the backpacking culture in Thailand, and is the best example of backpacker literature for our generation that I've yet seen.Still, after he builds this momentum and gets across what he wanted about backpacking, he never really found a good way to end it.
Fitting really, because most vacations are abortive like that, and The Beach delves into how some people desperately dont want them to end.
First of all I would like to thank my friend Maciek for suggesting this great book!
I couldn't tear myself away until I finished it.The only thing I knew about this story is that it was made into a movie with Leo DiCaprio and it got lukewarm reviews.
I stayed away from it for that reason.
If the movie is 1/10 as good as this novel, then I missed a treat.
Three world travelers have a map to a beach that is described as Eden.
Feeling adventurous, they make the difficult journey there, and are soon enmeshed in the glorious world of beach living.
Thanks again, Maciek!
Ένας χάρτης που απεικονίζει στο θαλάσσιο πάρκο της Ταϋλάνδης μια μυστήρια παράλια -σε ένα απαγορευμένο νησί για την πολυπληθή μάζα των τουριστών- και έρχεται με δραματικο τροπο στα χερια του Βρεττανου Ριτσαρντ και ενός ζευγαριού από την Γαλλια φαντάζει η τέλεια αφορμή για την διαφυγη από την συμβατική και ασφυκτιουσα πραγματικότητα και την αναζήτηση μιας αληθινης περιπέτειας που οδηγει στην συλλογή εμπειριών και αναμνήσεων.
The guy can certainly spin a yarn, and there were times when this novel was genuinely exciting, especially en route to the island and beach themselves.But this novel has so many things that just bugged me in the end, both as a reader and author.
I didn't like the movie's ending much either, but it actually met with less incredulity from me!But again, I finished this in three days.
I couldn't finish one of my own novels in that short a time.
Quite different than the movie adaptation.What I liked about The Beach were several things: I really enjoyed the way Garland wrote this story.
And despite some of the horrible things Richard, the main character did, I actually still liked him in the end.
What also made this more of a realistic story, and something which I kept thinking while I was reading was, "If it's too good to be true, it probably is." Life was too perfect on The Beach.
(hide spoiler)]I'm pretty happy with the story, but I think something a little extra could have been added to bump it up to five stars for me.
What it boils down tois that I'm not all that keen on Garland's writing here.For some reason, he failed to engage me in the narrative.
For example, there was one point where he was describing(view spoiler)[Zeph and Sammy getting beaten by the guards, and I felt very detached to the action.
When I think I have a good idea of how it's all laid out, I read something else that makes me adjust that.Just a vague detachment is what I felt throughout the entire story, really, as if I was as stoned as Richard was throughout most of the story.
This book is maybe my favorite book ever.
I have read it 5 times (just completed the fifth read) since I bought it in 2000.
I never get tired of this story.
He never escapes completely his own self-doubt, and realizes that utopia is an impracticality in nature, and in particular, in human beings.
The book captures a point that the movie misses entirely, and the events as they play out in the narrative are much more frightening and thrilling than in the movie.
Read this book!!!
По-слабия вариант на "Повелителят на мухите". Доста увлекателна и бързо се чете. Тъпото е, че има happy end като в американски филм.
The adaptation was all I knew of this story, and that was so trite.
An early DiCaprio set against a myriad of contemporary exciles (except for Sal, the exquisite Tilda Swinton.) But whatever, this isn't a movie review.
The book transported me so that I felt like I was in Thailand at first, and thickly glad I was not at the end.
Books like this, books about psychology, insanity, drug use are astoundingly hard for me to read.
Reading a book such as this is intense: At once I feel hyper-aware, insane, and drugged.

Плажът е рай за едни – и ад пак за тях: http://knigolandia.info/book-review/p...Историята навярно е позната на мнозина – младият англичанин (не се подвеждайте по задната корица) Ричард отива да дири приключения в Тайланд.
Той е обсебен от филмите за Виетнам (има много интересни препратки от тях), което в един момент се разчовърква здраво из разума му.
След ред приключения и препятствия (включително криеница от наркодилъри сред собствената им конопена плантация) те се добират до лагуна, в която малка група скици са си създали работеща утопия.
