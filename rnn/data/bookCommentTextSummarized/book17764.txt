I'll admit the first chunk of this book was slow & it felt like not much was happening, but those last 200 pages were GOLDEN. Great finale, even though I didn't much enjoy the first section of the book.
OMG THE TITLE : IN THE AFTERLIGHT   THE DARKEST MINDS NEVER FADE IN THE AFTERLIGHT
Please?
Okay, so it's officially been a week since In the Afterlight was released, and I must admit, it took me a little longer than I anticipated to finish...
Only rarely in my life has a book actually made me feel emotions for  every freaking thing  the main character felt...
God, I actually just laid down on my bed with the book on my chest with a tears leaking out of my eyes when I finished the last page because  that  is how attached I got to the main characters.
If you cannot deal with your emotions being fucked with, don't read this series.
Hi guys! You can read the first three chapters early! More info here: http://www.alexandrabracken.com/?p=1700
I know it will ruined everything if tell him, he can't take this kind of information" which is ridiculous cause in the end where the lies are revealed, Liam weren't even angry and Ruby still acts surprised, oh dear lord save me from this teenage drama.The craziest part is there is ONE occassion where Liam finally hides something from Rubitch after being treated horribly by her and his own brother and guess what Rubitch did?
Hmmm........I sat here for about an hour trying to figure out how I wanted to rate the book and what to say.
I liked the book well enough.
I liked that there were reunions and stuff but I kind of wanted it to be a little more than that.
I wanted people to stay together forever.
<--- Geez, just read the book.
I was so happy that Zu got to come back in this book.
She's so sweet.
I mean, he's just awesome and sweet and funny.
I hate that some had to die but that happens in books.
There was very little action and plot development, instead there was a lot of repetition and pointless dialogue/narration, I didn't need to read Ruby moaning about Jude or Liam again and again.
There was hardly any tension and not much emotion either, it was all so predictable.I also didn't like how pretty much all the adults throughout the series were remorseless fucks, but then at the end there was suddenly a load of caring parents and soldiers.
The one sided feelings between them was another factor which made their relationship rubbish.-I loved the main secondary characters (Zu, Vida, Chubbs, Nico), they were far more entertaining than Ruby/Liam.
I feel so weird now that I’ve finished this series because I really didn’t want it to end and I know I’m going to miss the characters so much!!
I actually kind of feel lost, like what am I supposed to do now?There were many times during this series that I wasn’t in engrossed in it and it was really tricky to carry on reading.
Every time I finish a series I love I get this weird feeling and get so SAD that it ended!!!!
This book is so stressful and emotionally intense, but it's a great conclusion! I love how everything wrapped up and my questions were answered, and it definitely brought some tears to my eyes, so bittersweet!I think some parts dragged on because they pretty much stayed in the same place the whole time, and it took me a while to read, but it was worth it. The characters are so wonderful and I love seeing their relationships develop. Although Ruby and Liam's relationship got frustrating!I still love this series SO much and it's definitely a favorite <3
Stuck it out even at times I really didn't want to finish it.
Razones de porqué este libro se me hizo pesado de leer tengo varias, pero no los cansaré, solo mencionaré tres:1.
-Si Clancy es el más poderoso de todos los psis y sin razón de un día para otro lo puedes controlar, lo menos que puedes hacer es cuestionarte cómo pudiste hacerlo.
I have so many complaints about Ruby...-I do not understand why she feels responsible for Jude's death.
When they finally find the reason for the disease, it is not at all interesting and although the end is not horrible, I wanted something more.
Ruby is the most badass of all badass female characters to ever exist, and I absolutely adore her.
Zu is adorable and powerful, and I love her character development.
Clancy can suck a d***, but I still value everything he brought to the table, even if it did screw everything up all the time, and I constantly wanted to wring his neck.
I could honestly have books about Liam Stewart be published every single year for the rest of my life and be completely happy.
And don't even get me started on the Liam and Ruby moments.
I HAVE SO MANY FEELINGS AND MOST OF THEM ARE LOVE FOR THIS SERIES.

Buddy read with Nancy*I'm gonna keep this review simple and straight to the point.* I'd like to say I'm surprised to be again rating a book in The Darkest Minds series in the 3 ★'s range.
Like the unnecessary death of a character, that I came to love and respect.
Even when I had a hard time trying to get my head around what was happening, I never doubted it was going to be amazing.The character evolved in such a great way.
I fell in love with these amazing characters over and over and over.Liam is one of the most awesome male characters out there.Ruby is such an inspiration.Vida is life (literally).Chubs is just kjdhkajhkah damn great.Zu is redemption.I laughed so hard when they book reached its end.
Alexandra amazes me.
The end.Rating a book from series we love condemns us to an extreme vigilance - because let's be honest one second here : I love Liam's character.
But it doesn't make any difference.Let's get straight on the flaws I couldn't overtake - faster we get through it, faster I can come back to all the wonderful things I adored in that book.✘ The pacing was slow.
You ready to talk now?”“My name,” I said between clenched teeth,“is Ruby.” ✯ The character of this series are amazing and so full of life they always gave me the impression they could jump off the page, and, you know, live for real : they're, in fact, the very opposite of perfect characters.
3,5 SterneHätte ich am Anfang nicht so Probleme im Lesefluss gehabt, hätte es auch locker 4 bekommen, aber irgendwie war mir der Anfang doch etwas zu langatmig, ohne dass wirklich etwas passiert ist.
Und die letzten 200 Seiten hab ich fast in einem Rutsch durchgesuchtet, weil es einfach nur fesselnd und grandios war, so muss Jugendfantasy/Dystopie!
Ich hätte zum Ende hin sogar gerne noch mehr Seiten gehabt.
👏🏻 und es war halt einfach mal was neues, klasse Idee, die auch sehr gut über drei Bücher ausgeweitet und umgesetzt wurde 👍🏻

I really enjoyed The Darkest Minds for the brilliant characters and world that Alexandra Bracken constructed, and Never Fade was just as fantastic.
They brought this book a lot of colour and entertainment, compared to Ruby who was constantly freaking about everything and Liam who acted like her mother or something.It's a shame that this series ended on a bad note for me, but I do know many many people who LOVED this book, so don't let me stop you from reading this book!The Darkest Minds Never Fade In The Afterlight.
I lost interest about halfway through the book and had to skim the rest, even though it pained me to do so.I guess part of the problem was that I barely remembered the second book.
And yes, that problem could have been solved easily by re-reading it, but I didn't have the patience.
I've been reading very slowly these past few months and Never Fade would have taken me, like, two weeks to finish, and I wanted to get to In The Afterlight so badly.
Full review posted on the blog!http://mariethebooklover.blogspot.com...If Ruby and Liam don't end up together, I will freak out. So how about you just give me this book. Like, now.
Really happy with how everything wrapped up! Here's my full booktalk/review: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hjD7...
The Darkest Minds series can get very frustrating because its structure is so Ruby-centered, readers rarely get to see past her.
This was a huge step for both Chubs and Vida and one of the things I was dying to read in In the Afterlight.
Besides Ruby seems to have a thing for nice guys (namely Liam) so Clancy/Ruby wouldn't have worked out.
I'm glad I read it, and Alexandra Bracken did a great job picking book titles.
Someone with a bit more patience as a reader than me would probably love the series.
MIND = BLOWN Oh dear... this book. I'm NOT okay :') Tears of happiness! Loved this ending! Best in the series, one of the best everrrr! READ IT, GUYS! This series is so rich, there is so much action, kick-ass characters, romance, so much character development :) I just love it and I can't think normal right now my mind is spinning and going crazyAnd last... Vida <3 forever. I think I have a new book crush xD
Will finish this later•MY HEART OMG THIS BOOK IS EVERYTHING I DIDNT WANT YET HOPED FOR, I JUST CAN'T
Promo post coming your way in five... four... three... two... one...HERE IT IS!!
I really hoped this book would be a lot better than the previous two books. ¤No action. I've been waiting for some kickass scenes and this book had none to offer. This is the last book right? Shouldn't shit be going down and there be some fights? Some action???¤Extremely long.¤Boring characters.
Şuan içim resmen parçalanıyor. Kitabın kapağını kapattığım andan itibaren duygusal anlamda çökmüş durumdayım. Bu seriyi ne kadar çok sevdiğimi anlatamam. Karakterler, kurgu, dili… Herşeyiyle mükemmel. En kötü olan şey ise bu kadar çok sevdiğin bir seriye veda etmek. Diğer iki kitabı ne kadar çok sevdiysem Ateş Çemberi de benim için öyleydi. Elimden bırakasım gelmedi. Bir yandan da bu kadar çabuk bitmesin diye yakındım. Karakterlerin duyguları, kafa karışıklıkları o kadar iyi yansıtılmıştı ki ben de aynı şeyleri yaşadım. Arkadaşlık, aile kavramları daha da yakınlaştırdı beni seriye. Ruby, Liam, Cole, Jude, Chubs, Vida, Zu, Cate… Hepsini çok özleyeceğim :(
This is honestly just a ramble, maybe one day I will write a full review for this but for now I just can't say much apart from read this series now.I also want to add (view spoiler)[I wasn't even mad that Cole died (hide spoiler)], I kinda went eh and moved on.
Also, (view spoiler)[what Ruby did for Clancy felt too nice.
Of course being an Orange or Red can screw with you, but like Lucas and Ruby are kind of signs it doesn't have to.
(hide spoiler)]What power would you like to have though?
