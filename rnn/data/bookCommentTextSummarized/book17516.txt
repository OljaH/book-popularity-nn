They may be complete strangers, with different lives and different problems, but there in that examination room they are measuring sadness the same way. They are measuring it in loss.

I thought this was such a beautiful, sad, sweet book.To be honest, I requested an arc of I Have Lost My Way only because I've liked some books by Gayle Forman in the past.
Forman uses an extremely compelling build-up to frame the strange and fateful meeting between three very different teens - Freya, Harun and Nathaniel - in NYC's Central Park.The story takes place over the course of one day, but is broken up with flashbacks that paint in the backgrounds of the three characters.
‚Äò‚ÄòYou gonna be okay,‚Äô‚Äô she says.‚Äò‚ÄòHow can you know that?‚Äô‚Äô Harun asks. ‚ÄúWhen a broken bone heals, it‚Äôs stronger than it was before the break,‚Äô‚Äô she replies. ‚ÄúSame holds true for broken hearts.‚Äô‚Äô Better than I Was Here and Just One Day, but not quite as wonderful and memorable as If I Stay and its companion novel.Gayle Forman does not write to impress.

Better than I Was Here and Just One Day, but not quite as wonderful and memorable as If I Stay and its companion novel.Gayle Forman does not write to impress.
But I can share with you a list of at least fifty other authors whose writing styles are more impressive.
A book that has only its writing style going for itself, while everything else is dull, will very rarely make my list of favourites.
Not surprising, a little short, and frankly quite corny at times, but I‚Äôm proud of Ms. Forman for finally writing a book with diverse characters.
I actually had NO idea what this new Forman book was about, but I really love If I Stay (I sniffled a bit ok, I do have feelings apparently) and this one had that same emotional ruuuuin.
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø It was more like a very very intense crush/beginning (and it is cute I do ship it, just...lowkey.)+ It also had 3 narrators: Freya, Harun, and Nathaniel.The style was interesting because they have their backstory backflashes in 1st person, but the actual present-day part of the book is in 3rd.
She feels SO lost and like as soon as she's fired from her singing deal, she'll never be loved.
I marvel at Gayle Forman‚Äôs clear-eye and heartbreaking complex depiction of the fierce, flawed, lovable people at this novel‚Äôs heart. ....This novel takes place in one day. These marvelous character‚Äôs tell their stories- each painfully struggling alone. The stories then get stitched together...a reminder that we are all connected. The late teen years can be daunting. Hallelujah for authors like Gayle Forman writing books like this!!!!
4 CharacterDriven Stars üåüüåüüåüüåüThis was a book filled with amazing characters....Freya meets Nathaniel after falling off a bridge and landing on top of him...Harun is a witness to the fall and so the friendship between the three of them begins...
I realize this seems like an unlikely way to meet, but it really worked in this book....Freya is an emerging singer who has lost her voice....Harun is gay and more than just a little afraid to come out to his parents....
you are given these amazing characters, who are very well-developed, and then that was it....
They may be complete strangers, with different lives and different problems, but there in that examination room they are measuring sadness the same way. They are measuring it in loss.  Gayle Forman is quite famously well-known for her If I Stay duology and while I have been the reader that watches the movie, I have not read the book nor its sequel. I seem to realize now that I've been missing out on her work, actually. Although 3 stars do not represent I loved the book, I think there were only
It was obvious it was gonna happen because there were these small gestures and hints Forman was throwing here and there in the beginning when Nathaniel and Freya met, and since Harun is gay and was looking for his ex-boyfriend, it was obviously going to be between Nathaniel and Freya.
I felt like he needed the support Freya and Nathaniel gave him and the advice, but obviously he had his mouth shut and couldn't open it and say the words, so I was quite glad it was figured out another way even though it wasn't the best.
4 Stars!(ARC provided by Penguin Random House) Freya is a 19 yr. old singer who is living in New York, and recording her debut album. She‚Äôs on the verge of being famous when she suddenly loses her singing voice. Her life goes from constantly working in the studio to endless doctor appointments. She was on her way to becoming a star, and now she wonders if the world will still love her if she can‚Äôt sing anymore. She feels like she‚Äôs lost her way, like the person she was no longer exists. Harun wa
She was on her way to becoming a star, and now she wonders if the world will still love her if she can‚Äôt sing anymore.
She feels like she‚Äôs lost her way, like the person she was no longer exists.
He feels like a coward, and like he‚Äôs living a lie.
Nathaniel used to love his life, but now it‚Äôs hard to remember the person he used to be.
Most days he feels invisible, like he hardly exists.
This book was full of different cultures, and is about love, loss, life, death, relationships, family, romance, but most of all friendship and human kindness.
Now this could be because every one of these books was wholly deserving of its hype, but I believe it was more of a case of me initially struggling to understand what books best suited my reading tastes, in this unknown genre, and becoming swept up in the enthusiastic adoration of much of what I discovered.
Gayle Forman was one such author that fit into this category.I rated her novel, If I Stay, five stars and waxed lyrical about my love for the deep emotional impact it had on me.
I really liked this, the characters were so deep and wonderful, and there's some great representation too! The one thing is, that I wish it was a little longer. It didn't quite seem resolved at the end, everything just felt way too open for my liking. Maybe just an extra 20-30 pages at the end, or an epilogue haha
I am happy to say that each time I have been lost, I have been able to eventually find a new direction to go.I have very little in common with the characters in this book but I was still able to relate to them.
I haven't been in the situations that Freya, Harun, and Nathaniel find themselves in during this story but I found each of their characters very easy to like and I really wanted to see them find what they needed in life.I really did enjoy reading this book.
I really enjoyed her style of writing and found myself not wanting to set this book aside.
In 2015, I read another novel I Was Here which I found overall to be slightly underwhelming and so, worried that maybe I wasn't going to enjoy any other books written by Gayle.
I am happy that I did have the opportunity to read it through a present from my boyfriend but here are my overall thoughts.I just wanted more, the character connections lacked with some of the pacing I found to be quite choppy.
I did like the New York City setting, three characters who all meet due to an accident and then, spend time together.
Oh my heart!
What an emotional story this is.
3 people who are all dealing with problems in their lives.
Over the course of the day these 3 people learn so much about each other and themselves.
Their stories and situations will tear at the heart strings and have you pulling for them to get through it.
They are nothing alike at first glance but looks can be deceiving..A beautiful story of friendships and being honest with yourself.
Thanks to Simon and Schuster Australia and NetGalley for an advanced copy of this book to read and enjoy in exchange for my honest opinions.
I don‚Äôt think it matters with this book if you can relate personally to any of the character‚Äôs specific circumstances and why they find their lives colliding that day.What matters is that all three have lost their way.
Told from all three perspectives, this is a story of love, friendship and discovering who you really are.They each feel invisible in their own way.
I fall in love with her characters, idiosyncrasies and all, and find myself thinking about them long after I finish reading their stories.
To share your loss with people is another way of giving your love.‚ÄùBest Description of Books Ever: ‚Äúlittle empathy-delivery devices‚Äù.
3.5 starsI loved Gayle Forman's books as a teen, so of course I had to check this one out - and it did not disappoint.
At first three strangers, their paths cross and their lives intertwine in a way that will change each of their individual trajectories forever.Forman shines when she writes about genuine emotions and challenging interpersonal dynamics.
However, I understand that plotting a story that spans over one day limits how much you can accomplish looking forward into characters' lives.Overall, a good read I would recommend to fans of Gayle Forman or those who like books that occur across the span of a day.
I think I am officially over Gale Forman‚Äôs kind of sentimental fiction.
This was a wonderful little story about friendship, family, and honestly acceptance on so many different degrees. I really enjoyed reading this book and the characters are so amazingly written. They have depth and all three are going through something vastly different in their lives. It was great to read their stories but also see them come together and really be there for each other. Also it is easy to get into their stories because they are very likable. My quick and simple overall: wonderful and deep. The writing was great and the characters were multidimensional.
RATING: 3/5 *I recieved an e-ARC from Penguin Publishing Group, through NetGalley & Edelweiss, in exchange for an honest review*‚ÄùThey may be complete strangers, with different lives and different problems but there in the examination room, they are measuring sadness the same way. They are measuring it in loss‚Äù This was quite different from Gayle Forman‚Äôs Other books. The story is told from 3 POVs, which I enjoyed.But the writting wasn‚Äôt compelling so It took me a while to really get invested. On the plus side, there‚Äôs diversity and a great message.Would I recommend? Sure :)
3.5, but maybe 4?What I didn't like:-We're inundated with background for all 3 characters before the story gets going, and before I knew them well enough to care yet.-Forman switched from first person to third person pretty often.
I was listening to the audio so I'm not sure if the print book would enlighten me as to why certain chapters were 1st vs 3rd, but it seemed very random on audio and was kind of jolting.-There are 3 narrators for the audiobook and they also seemed to jump in randomly.
Not at chapter breaks or POV switches, but just anytime their respective character was mentioned.
They each had a conflict in the present timeline, but the thing they had 'lost' acted as the foundation of their backstory, so even though you're only with these characters for less than 300 pages, it feels like you've read a 300 page book about each of them!
I love when religion and sexuality make a Venn diagram of emotions, and he was the character I wanted to read about even more.
It's my favourite story of it's kind because although the plot felt spontaneous, the characters were each achieving something or learning about themselves, so even the more frivolous things they did didn't feel useless.
For those who like deep and meaningful novels similar to John Green and Adam Silvera, I highly recommend this book.This story is very character driven and I found myself becoming deeply invested rather quickly in the characters of Freya, Nathaniel, and Harun.
There is potential for a sequel to be written but at the same time, I think it was a perfect standalone.I definitely recommend this novel to those who like meaningful and in-depth stories in a diverse and relatable young adult cast.
4,5 stars I read this one on the Eurostar the day before meeting Gayle Forman at YALC London. It was a bad idea as I ended crying on the train and my teenage daughter thinking ‚ÄúWhat the Hell mom! I SO don‚Äôt know you!‚Äù The day after, at the discussion panel about friendship in YA books Gayle was extremely pleased to learn that I cried because she is an evil woman! Or rather because she loves crying while writing and think a day without crying is a lost day.¬†¬†But I digress because ‚Ä¶.what‚Äôs this st
Freya born singing has lost her voice.Harun has lost the love of his life.Nathaniel has lost everything.
To the point where you don‚Äôt just want but need to be their friends, part of their unit.Freya is semi Ethiopian and a young singer, the next best thing happening in the music world.
It‚Äôs only when he looks up and sees Freya and Harun staring at him with similarly peculiar expressions that he understands he has done something wrong, revealed the wild man within him.

They are measuring it with loss.‚ÄùI Have Lost My Way by Gayle Forman follows three POVs: Freya, Harun, and Nathaniel.
Whenever one of them ends up literally falling on the other and one of them is a bystander, they become close in a span of a day and help each other understand the loss they‚Äôre all facing and how to cope with it.Gayle Forman is well-known, rightfully so, for If I Stay and it‚Äôs sequel.
Harun's character was actually the most fleshed out within the book and every scene with his family was great.
It was a quick read and one I enjoyed a great deal although¬† I readily admit I have a soft spot for this genre.The story alternated between Freya, Harun and Nathaniel, three wildly different characters with one thing in common - they each feel bereft at recent life shattering events and can't help feeling they've lost their way in life.
Harun has lost his first and only love because he didn't have the courage to come out to his muslim family, whilst Nathaniel's family has suffered a mortal wound and he's feeling completely alone in the world.
There are a few other secondary characters, mostly family members, but the story is firmly focused on the main three.Plot wise, it was a bit to settle into at first.
I think it would be easier to deal with in a print copy, but the e-arc was a bit disjointed at times.Overall, it was everything I expected.
It was hopeful and heartbreaking and swoony and sweet and a lot of other emotions.
And even though I wanted so much more at the ending, I truly loved this slice of time.**Huge thanks to Penguin Teen for providing the arc free of charge**
Three very different individuals whose paths are about to collide in New York City.
I very much love Gayle Forman and am always excited when she has a new novel.
It was a fast, easy read, as I quickly became immersed in the lives of these three different and diverse characters..
Forman is a lovely storyteller, and it's easy to get lost in this book.
The book seems brief and is over very quickly; it left me wanting to know more about all three individuals.
3.5 StarsI have been a fan of Gayle Forman for a while now, and I have been dying to read I Have Lost My Way since it was first announced. The story focuses on three characters who meet because of an accident, and I enjoyed each of them. However, the plot is hard to believe, and I had a hard time getting into it. Compared to Forman‚Äôs other books, I Have Lost My Way just doesn‚Äôt compare.Full review on The Candid Cover
Hoewel ik soms nog niet de klik had met de drie hoofdpersonages, kwam dat helemaal goed op het einde. Man man man, het was zo zielig, maar ook zo mooi. Na jaren ga ik waarschijnlijk Gayle Forman eindelijk ontmoeten deze zomer, ik kan niet wachten! Lees hier mijn recensie:http://nerdygeekyfanboy.com/recensie/...

Review Wow. This one had a lot in such a short book.
It really packed an emotional punch.We have three people, Freya, Harun and Nathaniel, who are all kind of reeling from something going on in their lives that come together because of a random little accident.
I had tears!!!Again this was a super quick read but really fit in a lot without feeling rushed or shorted of the story.
While emotional and sad at times it was left with a very hopeful feeling for all three which was perfect.This review was originally posted on Rebel Mommy Book Blog
