Ernst Cassirer provides a nuanced analysis and historical account on the development of Renaissance thought on the individual's relation to the Cosmos. Focus is especially dedicated to the Italian mystic, Nicholas Cusanus. The two final topics dealt with Freedom & Necessity, and the Subject-Object Problem.
My favorite text on the philosophy of the Renaissance (and the preceding Middle Ages). Cassirer rewards over and over again. I've been through this text three times and I keep finding more treasure.
A fascinating look at the changes and permutations in man's place in the world and in relation to god from the Middle Ages to the Renaissance. Definitely recommend it.
Unlike the work of other historians of his time (e.g. Lovejoy or Hazard), Cassirer's scholarship has aged remarkably well.
Cassirer's project in this book is to baptize Bruckhardt's narrative in Hegelianism and create a more robust intellectual history of Renaissance thought.
And while such ambitious big-picture narratives should always be treated with some degree of skepticism, Cassirer presents a substantive account.
Cassirer renders abstract concepts and arguments surprisingly accessible.
Even if some corrections have been made to his text over time, it still holds up as an impressive overview of a critical period in intellectual history.
Interesting book that honestly requires a strong grounding in Hegel to understand Cassirer's approach. Nicholas Cusanus' thought is conceptually difficult as well, since it embraces epistemological and metaphysical contradiction.
