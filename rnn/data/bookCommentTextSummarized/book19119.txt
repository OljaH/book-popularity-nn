(you'll find out what i'm talking about when you read the book) Honestly i thought the Gallagher Girls books were getting repetitivepattern: school>somethinghappens>school missionthen it I thought it was going to go: something happens over vacation> school>spy...but it wasn't like that ^^.
AAND i loooove Zach!
he's awesome!
and this book made REALLY miss Mr. Solomon and realized what an awesome character he is.You'll understand all my blebbering once you read the book.GO....NOWit was so intensseeeeee~
But Only the Good Spy Young was another interesting addition to the series and left me hanging for more.
The Circle, an organization of double agents, has been tracking down and trying to capture Cammie Morgan, a junior at the the Gallagher Academy for Exceptional Young Women.
There, she learns how to survive the most dangerous scenerios and everything she needs to know about how to be a spy.
And when one of her most trusted allies and teachers is found to be a double agent in the Circle, she learns the truth of her father's death and the mysterious boy she's in love with.
I THINK I’VE FINIALLY MADE THE BREAKTHROUGH !!!This book was SUBSTANTIALLY better the previous books.
Not only did the writing mature but so did the characters ((and Cammie wasn’t AS annoying)) There was a PLOT!!
It was fast paced, exciting, packed with twist and turns (albeit they were predictable at time) but it really did leave you feeling excited for more in the series.
There’s a point to it, the characters are finally falling into place without it feeling like a slapped together book by a 13 year old.
I mean, theyre 17 and living in a spy school yet they act like 12 year olds.
This book was not as amazing as I expected it to be.
It went above and beyond any expectations I had at all, and I loved every second of reading it.
Ally Carter does a great job of including all of the sweet and funny aspects that readers have come to know in her writing, but she also shows the darker points of humanity, including a double cross, cruelty, and above all, secrecy.
With a completely out-of-the-blue shocker to end the book, Ally Carter has a new masterpiece on her hands.
She knows how to leave the readers wanting more in the Gallagher Girls series.
REREAD (audiobook) 2018: SUCH QUALITY. gg is such an underrated series.
I always felt the first Gallagaher Books were a bit young (peoples, I like things dark and sinister).
And by groove, I mean, I wasn't going "WHO THE HECK IS MACY?
Totally knew it."Erm. Ahem.So this is a very fast-actiony-and-emotional GG book.
Stop expecting things from me.) And everyone is like closeting her and protecting her and asking if her head's okay and feeding her M&Ms, normal stuff.
(Bah. Called that in book 1.) And Zach is...I don't know?!
He reminded me of an American, spy-master Snape.Also is it just me or is Mr. Solomon's kind of, erm interest in Cammie a mite bit too creepy?
Ally Carter is not finished writing this series, but I may be finished reading it.
Besides, this series boasts ideas such as girl power, loyalty, and even self respect over cute boys (unheard of in YA, right?) so it's a great series for younger girls.
However, at the fourth installment of the series it is still all about protagonist Cammie Morgan.
Her bff's/roomies/fellow spies-in-training Bex, Macey and Liz remain bland, one dimensional cheerleaders for Team Cammie.
The adults all focus on Cammie.
These have been cute books and great brain candy.
I never anticipated these books being so intense oh my god
The best Gallagher Girl book yet, and that's saying something because I absolutely LOVE every single book in the series.
There's this one new character, I absolutely hated him from the first page he appeared on.
I'm pretty sure my family thought I was crazy while I was reading Only the Good Spy Young.
While I got into the other books, I don't recall getting into them as much as I did for Only the Good Spy Young.
My tip to you, follow your heart when your reading or you might die (quite literally!) Only the Good Spy Young was absolutely amazing.

Reviewed by Jaglvr for TeensReadToo.comONLY THE GOOD SPY YOUNG starts the reader off with heart-pounding suspense...as can be expected in the Gallagher Girl series.Cammie is on winter break in England with Bex and her MI-6 parents and an army of agents watching over her.
With the help of Bex, Liz, and Macey, the four girls are determined to figure out Mr. Solomon's cryptic message, and discover the secrets he wants her to know.Of course, Zach, the dreamy Blackthorne boy who always seems to show up when Cammie is in the most danger, is figured prominently in ONLY THE GOOD SPY YOUNG.
i finished it in like two hours and that were some of the most heart-breaking two hours in my life
After reading this book, which I loved by the way I just have one question...........HOW THE HELL DID THIS SERIES GO FROM A,  MEH I MIGHT GET AROUND TO READING THE NEXT BOOK SERIES TO A OMGGGG I NEED THE NEXT BOOK NOW!!!!!!
Cammie was questioning more, and didn’t rellie on others as much, also there was a lot more Zach in this book and yeah, that made it pretty amazing as well.What ever it was, I’m not complaining, I adored this book, and i cant wait for the next one,This book was action packed, had funny comments, I loved all the lists, loved all the characters and the betrayals, and of course all the Cammie and Zach moments.
Ooh, the story is starting to get darker.
(4.5) But YES.
Her Heist Society series was the first I'd ever read of Ally's, and I just adore those characters (yes, present tense adore.
I gave this series a try at my sisters' insistence, and I'm so glad I did!
Ally has a way of making characters that you just want to hang out with and laugh over a bag of M&Ms, and the situations and humor in her stories: WARNING!
It's very rare that you can find a story, let alone series, that is so adorable, fun, and incredibly clever that it just makes you smile to see them on your shelves.
Definitely give this series a try!
This book is definitely the best in the series to far terms of the plot, characters, and the writing.
I stayed up till 3 am just to finish it because I kept saying one more chapter, or I'll stop as soon as I figure this out.
Before I realized it I had read half the book and knew I couldn't stop till I was finished.
I have been getting these books from the library but if the series stays as good as this one was I will definitely have to buy them to reread.
These seriously keep getting better and better. I started this book at 1:30am, it is now 4:30am and I've finished it. I can't even remember the last time I read a book in one sitting. I didn't even stop to go to the bathroom, it's just been three solid hours of reading. I just seriously love these books so much. I love all these characters and the plots just keep getting more intriguing.
Awesome! I absolutely loved the book, but it was confusing, seeing as I didn't the other books. I realized when I was about one-third of the book, but like always, I couldn't stop reading it, if I did I'd probably dread not finishing the book. :P
ONLY THE EYES OF GALLAGHER GIRLS MAY READ THE CONTENTS Operative SabrinaUpon gaining access to the novel Only the Good Spy Young by subject Carter, the Operative was able to ascertain the following:~ The romance is undeniably evivident throughout. According to Operatives Sutton, Baxter and McHenry, Operative Morgan is "in love" with an asset who had firsthand knowledge of the Blackthorne Institute.~ Said asset has shown to reciprocate feelings towards Operative Morgan. The asset is privy to som
The Operative was rendered speachless after reading the final pages of the novel~ Speaking of which, the Operative highly disliked the ending due to the fact that it was a cliff hanger and the Operative did not wish to wait another 2 years for the next installment~ According to the Operative, Only the Good Spy Young will not disappoint.The Operative was able to obtain the following quotations and definitions:But, honestly, at that moment statistics were the last thing on my mind, because fluffly white snowflakes were floating through the night sky that stood between me and the one boy who didn't move, the boy who didn't swoon, the boy who just stood by the rails with his hands in his pockets, staring at me, saying, "Happy New Year, Gallagher Girl" (Carter, 4)Although Operative McHenry could not comment on the quotations, she allowed me to take a crack at it.
Also, I liked Cammie, though at points I wanted to personally lock her in a bunker because of her..."danger-tendencies".
WHYYYYYYYYY?!?!"~Two Days Later~Mr. Therapist: "I read something about the Book-that-must-not-be-Named that you posted, and I found it rather revealing.
So now that you wrote it, how is it making you feel?"Me: "I dunno, I'm still pretty angry with Ally for the cliffhanger though..."Mr. Therapist: "Mmhm.
And how does THAT make you feel?"Me: "...like I need the next book ASAP?"Mr. Therapist: " I see.
I want the next stinkin' book!"Mr. Therapist: "Calm yourself.
Especially if said person in danger is a girl who is training to be a spy.
Nobody tells Cammie anything when she's a key person--they all just expect her to fall in line (yeah, right, when has she ever done that?).
It's crazy how they can teach the girl how to undermine countries and yet they still can't trust her with something that pertains to her.Bah.In any case, the Ghallagher Girl books are a super light read.
I liked the previous Ghallagher Girl books better than this one.
Very interesting. Can't say I saw the plot twist coming, but I'm still very confused on different parts. The language was equal to the second book, with a couple 'heck's and a 'hell'. Quite a bit of blood. Mentions again of hotness and guy who are hot. A mention of a teacher's sexy bra. Two semi-detailed kisses, and two no-detailed kisses. Maybe it's because Cammie and I are the same age that I don't like Zach much (I know, I know, all the fangirls will attack me for that), especially at the end.
Wow. Wow. Wow!!This book is amazing!! I completely and utterly love Zachary and cammie I so desperately wish to be a Gallagher girl right now. There's no profession cooler than being a spy. Read this book for sure! Of course, read the first three before reading this book! Try it out, till I try to grab on my next copy of this amazing series!
She continued the mission.Despite of the seeming turncoats of this phase of the mission, the Operative still held back judgement and waited for more evidence before she decided to state plainly accusations.
More secrets to be uncovered (with the most important one: how does Asset Goode move without anyone taking notice of him).The Operative had the urge to both protect Asset Morgan and unleash her to the field to raise Hell.
In the end, Asset Morgan took matters into her own hands.Additional input: the Operative is still in mild shock over Asset Morgan's last action of this Phase.Proceed to Phase5.
Reread: Jan 17 2015The wifi was out yesterday so I ended up finishing the last three Gallagher Girls books and it was awesome.Man, I forgot how painful this one was. He's gone.He's just gone.Someone has to tell Rachel.Safe to say I shed a lot of tears. First read: April 2013 (5 stars)Thoughts:1. GRIPPING! Conspiracies, twists, and everybody's not who they seem to be.2. ZACH HOW DO YOU SEXY3. The ending...Cammie what are you doingI need to read the next book.
2nd September 21, 2014BEST BOOK EVER! Love this book from begging to start. This book is the whole reason I read and reread this series! In love with everything in it.3rd May 15, 2015THAT ENDING, never gets old! Oh I love it! Love it all!:) Zach is like the best guy ever I'm sad though.. the next book... Ya'll need to read this series! No joke!
Never fails to amaze! Plot is gripping and chockfull of secrets and surprises. I find myself thinking, "one more chapter then I'll wash the dishes," but you know how likely that is when you're in the middle of a great book. In most series, the first book is the best then the novels the come after get gradually worse and worse, but with Ally Carter's books, they maintain the amazing quality.
Ahh i so want to read this book. I reckon Zach is the one who gets labelled as the rogue operative cause he always turns up where cammie is and that guy from the circle of cavan knew him and why wasn't he at blackthrone? Ahh cannot wait until it is out... Joe Soloman hs been labelled a double agent:(
