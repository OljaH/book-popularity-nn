This is a horrible book.
It is interesting only because Rushdie plays around with the magical realism that will play a major part in his writing and touches on themes he will later explore in much greater depth.I don't recommend anyone who is thinking of reading Rushdie to think that as this is one of his shorter ones it would be a good one to start with, it really isn't a good read.
Why does this awful book stick in my head?
The first book from Rushdie is a magical voyage that successfully merges the magical realism of Marquez with Rushdie's own distillation of Indian mythology and tradition. It was a valiant first effort and is an exhilarating read. I think one should jump right into Midnight's Children, but if its length is too imposing, you could try Grimus or Shame to get your feet wet.
The most remarkable thing about Grimus?
Revelation that the great Salman Rushdie isn't good enough a writer to write SF.
Such lush prose, such splendid imagination, and such a wasted opportunity.
"Incoherent" would be putting it mildly.
The beginning of the story was intriguing (albeit bizarre), but pretty soon things started to seem more like someone's bad LSD trip, and then it got progressively worse.
By the end I got a headache and couldn't care less about any of it.
I'm giving it two stars solely for the writing and the ideas, 'cause everything else about this book is cringe-worthy.
This is shown through the idea of "dimension fever".The residents of Calf island are required to occupy themselves with a singular idea in an effort to preserve their precarious existances.Obsession or single mindedness is the only thing that can keep dimension fever at bay.
The characters' petty squabbles, alliances , and feuds are all played out in an effort to avoid facing the very conditions of their existence.
There are so many themes at play in this allegorical tale that I cant even wrap my mind around quite yet.
Then he meets this figure again, and he gets thrown to Calf Island, which seems to be in a different dimension.
And it's obvious Eagle's presence there is a catalyst for all manner of mayhem, all of which is directly related to a being that may or may not exist, called Grimus.Everything goes obviously, because this is a badly written fantasy.
In fact, it's so horribly foreshadowed, that I don't believe what happened in the end.
It's hard to believe the very next book this author wrote was the splendid Midnight's Children.
The book tells the tale of Flapping Eagle, a Native American man who becomes immortal and wanders the world for 777 years, 7 months, and 7 days until he attempts suicide and ends up in another world (a parallel dimension).
I���m sure many people who read this book will hate it because at times it seems nonsensical.
Rushdie raises some interesting questions in this book about human nature, spirituality, and cultural isolation.
In many ways, the book structure parallels Dante���s Divine Comedy.
I am less knowledgeable about the other religious/spiritual material he draws from so I think I missed out on a lot of the other references that were made in this book.
Saying that Grimus does have a lot of flaws.The story focuses on Flapping Eagle, who drinks an elixir which gives him eternal life, given to him by his sister, who deserts him.
After 777 years he wants mortality and to find his sister, eventually ending up on the metaphysical Calf Island.
Flapping Eagle himself has to control himself in order to complete his quest.As such this is a rich plot with some Rushdie trademarks, puns, jokes, references to popular culture and mythology but somehow things just don't gel that well and there quite a few dull stretches which hamper the plot's progress.
There are so many reason why I will feel a book is "good".
And sometimes, just sometimes, it's a book that just stays with me for no apparent reason that makes it good.
This book's writing wasn't particularly moving, the story was just too bizarre to truly grasp, the characters were weird....but this book stayed with me.
I think of it at the most random times and I read it years ago.
It's one I keep meaning to re-read because I just think of it so often, I might as well.
It was nothing like this.
The book is early, and his writing - undecided, not fully grown up.
And that's precisely what I liked about it.
I mean the story is crazy, and I like crazy.
But the words, the writing style (someone might say: inmature) I would call open (yet).
Normally I would rate it 3 stars, but this early language, that leaves a space for surprise (if Rushdie decides to go young-crazy again, maybe, in the future, despite of his mature now life and style).
After all, life is full of surprises.
actually a horrible book. but even rushdie said that about it! it was his first novel, and really sucked. but it is worth reading because he wrote it - and if you are an aspiring author it should give you hope that you can write a piece of crap and come back to be an amazing and well-respected writer.
That's both a criticism and a praise, because the truth is that Rushdie does display great skill in crafting this novel, but his willingness to force readers to work harder than they should in order to identify this skill is little more than ego-stroking.Yet, Grimus did eventually win me over.
It's difficult to summarize the plot exactly because Grimus is less about what happens as it is about the people it happens to and the reactions of all the other characters to the spectre of Flapping Eagle as he moves destructively in and through their lives.At its core the novel is symbolic, high-minded and a book to make you consider things.
What an incredible book for a first work!
Add in some mystery, a dash of scientific magic and human interest and shake it all together for a book that caught my interest from the start and never let it go.
If this is what Salman Rushdie manages to write straight out of the authorship gate I'm not sure if I'm more excited to think of the literary treats in store for me, or apprehensive to think that the rest of the books won't live up to the promise of Grimus.I'm going to go with Door #2 for now.
A remarkably assured beginning for a first book.
All the Rushdie hallmarks ..
Flamboyant, vividly imagined, stylishly written, and science fiction or fantasy, to boot.
I wonder why he chose this genre for his first outing.
Perhaps he hadn't yet considered magic realism.
Conversely, one wonders how many Booker-worthy writers are hiding their light under the bushels of genres considered not literary enough.For some who think his fame is owed more to his life events than writing, this should give them pause for thought.True, I haven't liked all his books as much, but I'm glad I managed to find this one.
The debut of Rushdie was a fantasy novel which follows Flapping Eagle to Calf Islandlooking for his sister Bird Dog. Flapping Eagle has the gift of immortality which really is not something he desires but it makes it possible for him to make it to Calf. Calf is where people who have immortality go to live. The story touches on a variety of mythology of Sufi, Hindu, Christian and Norse and many concepts and philosophy. It was not well received but it isn't hard to read. It's not Rusdie's best but it's not the worst either.
yow. incredible journey. the first chapter was my favorite. my favorite moment? when the rocking chair stopped. beautiful & simple. loved reading it as it was rushdie's first foray into fantastic realms. i prefer his other works, but as rushdie's 'beginning,' found the read fascinating. i would say the read was more interesting than the end, but enjoyed it nonetheless. oh, and p.s.? there was a brilliant meta-moment about 2/3 of the way into the book. loved it.
Rushdie critique's his own work in this book. Read carefully the debate between Gribbs, Elfrida, and Irna about whether stories should be well tied together or not. It seems to be the issue that Rushdie struggles with in his first novel. There are moments of mystery, but the drive to tie all the ends together makes it a bit too neat in the end.
While this book may be Rushdie's first, and therefore, lack some of the polish an genius he is known for, Grimus is a gripping and imaginative tale, which explores the human condition, gender, sexuality, and desire through immortality and its price.
Eventually he finds his way to Calf Island, which exists somewhere between dimensions and eventually to a confrontation with the eponymous Grimus.The characters that Flapping Eagle encounters on his journey are mostly just caricatures, without much in the way of depth, although Flapping Eagle's companion and guide Virgil Jones does get more development.I think that Rushdie may have been going for somewhere between gothic and grand guignol in this novel, and to some degree he's managed it, but at the expense of any warmth or engaging characters.
It's not yet the polished and poetic style that it would develop into.So mostly worth reading if you're a fan of Rushdie to see how his writing developed, but it doesn't really stand up to his later work either in plot or in the writing.
I typically take delight in non-sensical reads.
Magical realism (when done right) can unlock the surprisingly deep dimensions of the mind - things that you've never thought of, corners you've never explored and interpretations you've never considered.
It started out promising, but somehow got lost and turned rather messy in the middle (which made it quite a difficult read for me).
Although Part Three really turned things around and picked up the pace, it might perhaps be a little too much so because it seemed as though the entire story could've been made more exciting if the ending wasn't so abrupt and if more attention was given to the final part and Grimus's backstory.
It's a short but dense novel, so don't rush through it.
It tells the story of Flapping Eagle, who at over 700 years of age, received the gift of immortality from his sister, who promptly disappears.
Flapping Eagle goes on a quest to find her, discovering that she may have fled to Calf Island, a mystical place guarded by the mysterious Grimus.
I won't give away anymore, but the text is dense and a tad overly complex for its own good.
It's an enjoyable journey about a hero's quest, but it's overly complex, incorporating many cultures' myths and legends.
First off, this book contains rape, incest, murder and suicide, so if you're sensitive to that, don't read this book.
Everything made mostly sense in the end, but it's not enjoyable reading a book where you constantly have no idea what is going on.
I didn't really root for Flapping Eagle and wasn't interested in the characters at all.This was my first time reading Salman Rushdie and I've heard his books should be amazing, and since this is just his debut novel, I might give him a second chance, but this was not enjoyable for me.
Skøn, skøn, skøn bog. Jeg kan slet ikke forstå, at forfatteren nærmest selv har fortrudt den (efter sigende). Den er fantastisk på så mange planer og udfordrer forestillingsevnen, mens det hele stadig er relevant og meningsgivende, selvom det umiddelbart forekommer absurd. Der er mening med alt, og alt, hvad man undrer sig over undervejs, ender man med at få svar på. Jeg vil gerne læse den igen en anden gang.Min eneste kritik går til det danske forlag (Gyldendal), som på bogens bagside har afsløret, hvad der sker på 30.-sidste side. Det er ikke i orden!
sorry but this book is terrible. i guess comforting to know that it was rushdie's first novel- you can see brief glimpses of how his imagination (which he has clearly never been short of) comes together in the brilliant magical realism that mercifully follows later in his career. i ended up giving up on this book just 30 pages shy of the end but i really couldn't stand it any longer.. nearly 300 pages in and i still have zero connections to any of the characters or any idea what is going on and who's who, really....
This is Rushdie in the rough. You can see the seeds of his unique style, which will come out in its full glory in his later book. Grismus writing is still a little awkward, the fairy-tale aspect a little more trippy than in his later books. Rushdie wrote this book as an entry to a science-fiction competition, and it feels like the fantasy element is a little forced. Later he will learn how to strum this confidently, but in Grimus... left me nauseous at times. Love Rushdie, but this is not his best.
This is Rushdie's first novel. The writing style is quite different from his other more well known novels. It is on the lines of what I prefer to term as 'collage writing'. He would eventually switch to a more lucid style from Midnight's Children onward. However, I quite enjoyed reading this. In fact this is the first ever Rushdie I read!
The book was a huge disappointment. Rushdie shows glimpses of his lyrical prose but that is just about it. Asinine story, drab characters and Rushdie's imagination run amok. Though it was his first book , not a good book at all to get introduced to his work.
In Rushdie's later novels, the magical realism aspect of the novel was introduced early on (children born on midnight having superpowers, or two survivors of a plane crash morphing into an angel and a devil), and the book stayed within its assumptions.
Hence, I couldn't help but feel like Rushdie overused deus ex machina as a plot device in this book, as new magical things were constantly being introduced, especially when Flapping Eagle finally reached the house of Grimus above the mountain in Calf Island.I have to say though, that even though this is a novel that I ended up not liking, there are a few redeeming factors I'd like to talk about.
Audio book.
Vacuous intellectual masturbation at its worst.
I'm a huge fan of Rushdie, but this did nothing for me. The bit about being willing to try anything twice is about all I even remember.
