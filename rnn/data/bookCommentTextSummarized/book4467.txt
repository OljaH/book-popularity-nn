Another typical format Nancy Drew mystery, this one involving a lot of Persian cats, the usual Nancy Drew drama, people trying to kill Nancy by locking her in a room on fire, knocking heavy stage scenery over on her, etc. How is this girl still alive?!?
Nancy saves the lives of countless individuals, because she is an unlicensed veterinarian and a skillful doctor.Nancy and Ned discover some letters have been stolen from her father's desk, stowed in his tool box, and then stolen again.
And, scene.Nancy is drugged at the Temple of the Stars, after paying $3 for some terrible soup, and kidnapped by a man who is pretending to be Egyptian, but whom she believes to be ::gasp:: black.
Nancy then spends an enjoyable afternoon at the Met.Nancy is kidnapped, yet again.
Review to come
A whole bunch of cat breeding.Once again, Nancy is perfect at whatever activity she chooses.
Also Morse code.These books have strange combinations of plot elements!
Honestly, Nancy's assignment is to assist a woman whose job/hobby is breeding and housing Persian cats.
And some thieves get it into their heads that it'll be a really lucrative scheme to steal these cats and sell them on the black market.Nancy Drew books always feature really stupid villains.Also, at the end, Nancy pretty much ruins a tap dancing recital by doing an endless solo of Morse code to a man in the audience.
The plot of the 1939 version is a bizarre stew of Persian cats, real estate conspiracies, aging actors, and a little boy with a head injury secretly living on cat food in the basement of some lady's house.
The 1969 revision has an incredible set-up for the next book in the series: at the end of a play Nancy tap dances a request for mysteries to solve in morse code and someone in the audience stands up and says, "MISS DREW, I HAVE A MYSTERY FOR YOU!" See, that's why that Nancy Drew movie starring Julia Roberts' niece was such a flop.
It didn't have a scene this cool.
Honestly, one of the weaker Nancy Drew stories that I have read, but they are all so good, even the bad one's are great.
I am absolutely ecstatic to say I've read another Nancy Drew book for a long time.
The Clue of the Tapping Heels by Carolyn Keene is a great book to read for those looking for a plot twist mystery.
This is a great book because it keeps you excited.
When I read this book, I was satisfied with my book choice.
Nancy Drew is an amzing series.
Nancy Drew is the detective, she's always going out doing what she enjoys, and same goes here!
It's amazing how this book makes you take use of your time in this phenomenal book series.
Go Nancy Drew!
Meow, meow, meow.
Cats, cats and more cats.
Since I already have a house full of cats I really didn't care for this portion of the story.
Who was stealing the Persian cats?
Who cares?
Let them clean the litter boxes.Next was the tap, tap, tapping in the house.
Was it a raven?
Nevermore!
Very strange.Finally, did you know that Carson Drew is a multi-talented dude?
I tell you, there is no lack of talent in that family!
:)Still, I found the story pretty interesting (aside from the cats) and the mystery a good one.
"'It sounds spooky,' said Bess, 'and I don't know a thing about taking care of Persian cats.'""The taller of the two men looked at Nancy. 'Amateur detective, eh?' He scoffed. 'Well, if there's one thing in this world I have no use for it's an amateur detective.'Nancy was stung by the remark. Somehow she must prove to these men that she was not faking."
These are fun stories to read. Even back in the 30's the term groovy was used. LOL!
I loved book!! I think this was an amazing book packed with exciting adventure and danger. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who loves a great book!!
Really enjoyed this book. It was funny, and I loved how it says that Nancy enjoys going to church! I also thought it was really smart the the next mystery starts right after the end of this one. To be honest, I’m quite surprised to see that this book doesn’t have very good reviews?
Of course then there would only be one Nancy Drew book.Anyway this was upsetting, and I suggest you go ahead and skip this one, the only important detail was at the very end she tapped a message in Morse to her audience at her tap-dance show: **"If anyone has a mystery for please find me backstage and tell me, kk?!"**, to which an army man in the audience replied in Morse **"Kk, I have on about a BRASS BOUND CHEST (hint hint)"** Nancy: **"WOW!
Anyway, outside Berryville the girls find a lost, wounded kitten and return it to its owner, an honest to God CRAZY CAT LADY who has like 25 of the damn things, and her neighbors are ready to burn the house down.
He's also a total nerd, but anyway, he and his dad are reunited, and hooray!Nancy and George, while trying to track down one of the villains, end up drugged and passing out in a fortune teller's place in River Heights, and the guy tries to ransom Nancy for $3,000 (this would be just over $50,000 in today's money).
As an aside, Nancy stars in a play where she tap dances, and the asshole director is named Mr. Skank. HA! This book is pretty much a redo of #2 but with a more convoluted plot involving a stolen estate and the Persian cat trade. A bunch of guys are all targeting an old lady at once. At the tail end Nancy gets bound and gagged, then immediately found and rescued. No major characters lose consciousness but someone sets a bomb under Nancy's car and someone commits arson and sabotage at the play rehearsals.
one of the darker nancy drews involving a juvenile delinquent with an abusive past of all things. george and bess have to sleep in a dirty ole garage. eewww. the persian cats were cute as buttons & i liked nancy's dance theater debut. she sure rocked it out in her tapping heels. and tee hee hee there's a character named "mr. skank". i wonder if he's related to any of the skanks i know?
this is a great mystery book.
Prettttttty bad. Story was all over the place.
The original 1937 version of The Clue of the Tapping Heels (not be be confused with the "yellow spine" version of the novel that was rewritten in the 1950s) could alternatively be called "Nancy Drew Befriends an Eccentric Cat Lady and Starkly Reveals Her White Privilege." From the first time that Nancy and her chums meet Miss Annie Carter, they decide that despite her lower-class circumstances living in a run-down house that is overrun with literally dozens of cats, there is something about the woman that conveys she has a greater pedigree than her circumstances would suggest.
I remember so fondly obsessively borrowing and reading Nancy Drew mystery stories from my elementary school library.
Although many things in life have changed over the four decades-plus since I first discovered these wonderful books, but one thing that has not changed in the least is how much fun, how truly entertaining, and how thoroughly enjoyable Nancy Drew mystery stories still are – even as an adult child beginning my second half-century of life.
I'm amazed how much I do remember from my childhood reading of these wonderful books, as well as how much I didn't remember.
Reading the original text of this series falls under 2 categories: absolutely lovely, or horribly outdated.
A lot of the “mystery” in this one is solved by dumb luck for Nancy.
In a lot of the stories she just so happens to be in the right place at the right time, and this doesn’t generally bother me, but this time it did.
The whole story just had too many elements, a lot of which were not solved for or explained - Miss.
Good thing I know that this isn’t the case for others in the series.
Nancy is suddenly an amazing tap dancer - one who is going to star in a musical.
That's right, this girl wonder can now tap in code.
How lucky is that?A retired, ill actress has been hearing strange tapping sounds in her house.
So Nancy, George and Bess decide to stay at the house and investigate.
There are secret rooms, locked doors, fires, perilous climbs to rescue cats, a romantic side-story, a fight scene and some really strange characters.The solution ties into the history of the house - the unhappy family who lived there many years ago.A great mystery with lots of laughs.
It's Nancy Drew - and in 2018 that made for a nice clean fun read.
One of the take away for me was how people help each other, thrown into water - Nancy looks for her friend and finds him helping some.
Sure the story is simple, almost over the top so, but in the end I felt good having read it.
I was entertained and could hold a fun easy conversation about reading the book.
Simple and easy.
Coming from a time that, looking back at least seems simple and easy in of it self.
From the looks of this cover, I sensed I was in for some suckage. Indeed, I was in for a heap of farfetched shenanigans and another take on the old old-biddy-has-something-weird-going-on-in-her-house-and-ND-stays-there-til-she-figures-it-out formula. But this time there are cats, and of the Persian persuasion too! There's also a mentally ill man living in a secret room in the basement too, and nobody knew about either, and the full magnitude of how profoundly disturbing this is is of course never fully realized.
As always, Nancy gets her man! This book was refreshing break from the depressing current events we've all been bogged down by. In this series, even the criminals have a wholesomeness. This mystery was face-paced as always, entertaining and a superfun read. I recommend this to anybody looking for a fun mystery targeted for children, or any looking for an iconic book series in American literature.
Full disclosure: I am superbly biased in favor of this mystery because 1) the cover of this book is just phenomenal and I need it printed HUGE on a T-shirt and 2) it involves cats and I love cats. Other highlights include the first time I think Nancy has ever been threatened with a bomb, the interesting but under-explored psychology of Gus Wooton, and small but adorable romance between two long-lost lovers.
This specific volume had some interesting story points and more mysterious goings-on; it was a slightly longer storyline, which means the story was generally better. With that said, the more I read of the series, the less believable (& for me, likable) Nancy Drew becomes - no one person can be be so skilled in so many various things, and always come out the winner. It brings up, again, the issue of long series - how long is too long?
Having recently re-read the original version of THE MYSTERY AT THE MOSS-COVERED MANSION and finding it somewhat different from what I remembered, I was leery of re-reading another original version of a book in the series. I needn't have worried, however, as I discovered that TAPPING HEELS in its original form -- racial stereotypes aside -- remains the better of the two editions of the book.
What an amazing book! There was so many good things about this book. Number one, at the end of every chapter, she adds a cliffhanger so that you will never want to stop reading. This book had so many spooky parts as well, which I love. I really hope you can get a chance to read this book!
Perfect plot, perfect adventure, perfect mystery. The Agatha Christie-like twist at the very end robbed us of what may have been the greatest Nancy Drew villain in history but hey, this is one hell of a story! Must-read!
