On both grounds their teaching tends to over-emphases the importance of the law and the constitution, although these give the past a paralysing hold over the present.” 13“There are, however, certain respects in which the advocate of change is likely to give better education than the advocate of the status quo.

It’s tough categorizing Bertrand Russell books because they tend to read like in-depth analyses but at the same time these are just Russell’s opinions and experiences that he’s recounting.
Education and the Social Order is a perfect example of what we’re talking about.Bertrand Russell never stopped considering what a perfect school for children would look like.
In this book, Russell basically argues that we have two choices when it comes to education: educate people as citizens or as individuals.
And when one looks at everything from purely a matter of class-struggle, things like science suffer greatly.But if an individual culture fosters freedom in its citizens and encourages them to ask questions, you end up with a difficult situation for the State.
Very shallow.
