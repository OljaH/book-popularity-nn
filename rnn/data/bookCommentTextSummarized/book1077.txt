As a young child, I would lose myself for hours in the simple world of the wood and pond inhabited by Little Joe Otter, Buster Bear, Grandfather Frog, and terrorized by Farmer Brown's Boy. I can remember the very shelf, even the exact spot in the little library in Felton, CA where these books were kept.
I do not recall if Old Man Coyote plays a role in Danny Field Mouse's story or the other way around, but this concept was presented several times.

Sly, cautious, seldom taken by surprise, not fooled for long by scarecrows or decoys and hard to hunt, the real crows were every bit as clever as Blacky.Some may object to an apparent anti-hunting message in this book.
Burgess was a hunter and a naturalist who understood and loved the outdoors and communicated that in his stories.

Bedtime story for my boys. They didn't want me to stop reading each night.
Good book
Repetitive and nauseatingly moralistic. The author apparently believes that kids won't catch the moral of his story unless he explicitly tells them, over and over, in every chapter, what he's getting at. I can't imagine that I would have enjoyed this a child.
For years I've been trying to figure out the name of the crow-story book I read back in the second grade so long ago.
I only remember the cover being red and of the thick plain "library binding" type, so I've been hunting for years for thick red hardcovers when that's probably not what I should have been looking for.
On a whim this evening I typed "classic children's books crow" into Google and this title was the second to pop up and upon looking at it it seemed to be the one I've been after.
Blacky the Crow loves eggs. He is very surprised one morning, as he flies over the Green Forest, to see an egg in Redtail the Hawk’s abandoned nest. Who could be laying eggs in the winter? Does Blacky dare to try to get the egg? He investigates for several days, and then develops a plan to steal that egg, and maybe even the other one that appears. Does he succeed? Even though this story is fairly juvenile for my boys, they begged for more and more chapters.Read my full review here.
Free Kindle download. Very cute children's story about Blacky the Crow's adventures in the forest and his obsession with eating eggs. Blacky is crafty and self-serving but he does have a nice side - sometimes. Each chapter has a moral ala Aesop's Fables. An Example: There is no compromise with right and wrong. A half-right is not as good as a whole-right and a half-wrong is still very wrong.
I loved this book! Probably more as a child than an adult, but nonetheless, it brought back great memories. I am sure I read every book in the series of the woodland creatures and learned many of the lessons they taught. I could not wait for the bookmobile to home and bring me new adventures. These would most likely be good stories for a parent and child to share at bedtime.
Very easy children's book. Simple story lines about a clever crow that gets in and out of mischief. Each chapter is headed by a "moral", emphasizing intelligence, loyalty, ingenuity, taking risks etc.
I have my grandma's copy of this well loved and read book. I can remember reading it at my great grandma's house when I was little and I have read it to my children.Very fun and imaginative. Blacky the Crow always finds mischief.
could read it, the writing was so poor. was able to skim only. despite that it may work as a read aloud for first graders?
My kids loved hearing about Blacky's Adventures!
The book was drab and repetitive. I think creatures in the book written by Burgess have nothing to eat else than eggs. Also they are to wise to fall into any pitfalls. Anyhow I liked this book.
I know that it is more for younger kids, but it has certain aspects that make it okay for ANY age group. It was really fun and had mystery, but it was clean and funny.
I read a lot of these books as a beginner reader & I lived on a farm. I loved animal stories. Reading it as a grandma gave me a different perspective - nicely written for young readers I feel.
I probably found this cuter than my son did. Blacky starts out as a bit of a scamp, but redeems himself in the end. A great quick light read.
