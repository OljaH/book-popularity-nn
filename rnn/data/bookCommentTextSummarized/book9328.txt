Book Review  4 out of 5 stars to The Zoo Story, written in 1959 by Edward Albee. If you haven't read this story, you've missed out on something intense and truly spellbinding. It's a classic American play staged on Broadway (and other places), but so few have probably read it these days.

It's a classic American play staged on Broadway (and other places), but so few have probably read it these days.
Uppity business man taking a break from his day.
The business man wants to ignore him.
The business man wants to walk away, but the vagabond tickles him.
One man runs away.
Wrapped up into a little old play so many of us haven't actually read or seen.So what are you waiting for?
And it should be read.
here's the scoop: I read A LOT.
Albee’s one-act debut takes place within the boundaries of a single section of a public park, nearby a bench that centers the action of the drama; its dialogue is suggestive and evasive rather than clear and direct, and the characters, though certainly not everymans, read as social types.
Only at one point, when one of the men literally spells out that he was a homosexual for ten days, does the play (almost) make explicit that which it repeatedly implies—the audience is watching a seduction.
When the clean-cut character starts to back away from the encounter, though, the play takes a violent turn that ends in the stabbing of the self-described former homosexual.
Highly recommended...................................................SPOILER ALERT REVIEW !...................................................Genre: Theatre of the Absurd "The Zoo Story", a play in which there is no zoo! It depicts a world which doesn’t make a sense. Human beings always want to find a meaning for their lives. They all want to know what happened at the zoo, but they soon will understand the absurdity of their lives and will get disappointed. This is the theatre of the absurd!The
This is the theatre of the absurd!The Title As Jerry tells Peter in the story:You’re an animal too.''" , it shows a side of human which is not controlled by himself.
With animals!"This part of the play made me think about zoophilism but as the story goes on the main ideas and the key themes will be gradually revealed.Themes:Isolation, loneliness, miscommunication, intimacy, Sexual Identity, homosexualism, social class, and absurdism Intimacy is not just about friendship – it requires a fundamental sense of understanding and compassion between two people.
Dunno what to say! I'm still shocked...

I found this old essay I wrote about this play my senior year of college. it's pretty fantastic. I got to read it out loud in front of the class. SPOILERS The Zoo Story is a play about two seemingly opposite men, Peter and Jerry, conversing in Central Park about their family and home-life. Jerry tells a long, rambled story about a conflict between he and his landlady's dog that seems to have little significance to anything. Peter and Jerry's encounter begins rather comically, but ends in shockin
In the story, Jerry confesses sadness and humility that he and the dog no longer fight with each other, that instead they have "attained a compromise" where they "neither love nor hurt because [they] do not try to reach each other" (Albee 20).
When Peter decides to leave the park and go back to his home, one gets the sense that if Jerry had let him leave, then their relationship would have ended just like that of he and the dog, that of sadness and suspicion, where neither is loved nor hurt by the other.
Through dying, he is able to be hurt by another person, establishing an emotional connection rather than compromise.
Jahre, ach was Jahrzehnte, liegt die Lektüre zurück. Wir laden es im Englisch-unterricht und wir haben es gehasst. Lag evtl. mehr an Schule als am Text.
No one writes loneliness better than Edward Albee. The underlying themes of alienation, sexual identity, belonging all culminates to an ending that neither of the two characters see it coming. Albee works around symbolism and an undercurrent of stagnation that people end up in during their lifetimes. An excellent play that plays out exactly how its written and its interpretation lies in its words than in setting.
I had to read this for my English class and I am so glad I did. Not only did I understand it, but it was broken down so well I was blown away. This is a play about two men, it has underlying tones of homosexuality, loneliness, unhappiness and that's just to name a few things. It is short but so very powerful. I would recommend this play and suggest you read it with someone and have a discussion on it. It's interesting to see everyone's take on this.
Read for my American Lit class. This is a thought-provoking absurdist one-act play that I just did not "get" during my first pass. I was looking at it a little too simplistically. I wasn't prepared for that ending. I wasn't prepared for any of it. But now that it's in my consciousness, I'm not sure I'll be able to get any of it out of my head ever again.
Leaves you thinking. It was good.
Still shocked. Best written play. Jerry is phenomenal.
If you would ask me if I was going to like absurd theatre, I probably would have thought no, though I wouldn't have actually said it before reading it.
I've been going to a few plays in the last couple of weeks and I would love to experience an absurd play in the theatre.
And Jerry randomly is going to tell a random guy at the bench about what happened during his zoo visit.
And one can find many different interpretations on the ending too.
Because it really is a character I think a lot of people have in them.
I choose to see Peter and Jerry as doppelgängers--the former living a life we are all conditioned to think is normal/successful, while the latter lives a life of lonely isolation.
Jerry expresses a deep fear underlying the mask of respectability structuring Peter's life--the fear that Peter's life might indeed be more of a "zoo" than he cares to admit.
To me, the ending suggests not that Peter escapes or destroys Jerry, but that Jerry transfers or merges his reality with Peter, who is forever changed by an encounter that, in the words of Werner Herzog, melts away the thin layer of civilization that crystalizes like ice over a deep ocean of chaos and darkness.
Ladies and gentlemen, I have found the king of my absurd...A violent philosophical statement about the impotent alienation of young men and the raging bulls of the absurd.
The Zoo Story is Camus on speed, Beckett on shock therapy, and Kafka binge-eating American cheeseburgers with some sort of curious, fixed grin on his lucid, logical face.
The Zoo Story is Edward Albee wearing some sort of smash-mouth tiara, draped in a Japanese kimono, and plucking his eyebrows fiercely in a shattered glittering mirror.
The Zoo Story is about Sisyphus as the postmodern idiot-savant.
The Zoo Story is beyond masterful.
Albee's early play is beyond even words.
The Zoo Story simply 
this is being placed on my favorites shelf just b/c it's the first play i've ever read by myself (not for school), so it deserves a special place in my heart. it's also just fucking wild dude what the hell. goddamn, albee. but i enjoyed it more than i thought i would, given that this is like my 5th attempt at reading a play by myself and the first four all failed
My first Albee play that I've read. I expected it to be absurd....but somehow the absurdity made sense. The philosophy mentioned in the text is quite fascinating....and makes me think about how we humans interact with each other. This play takes it to the extreme.
The dialogue kept me on edge. Actually it doesn't feel that dated at all. This whole interaction could happen today, just as it is.For me, a great example of Don't Talk to Strangers in Public Because They Probably Are Bananas.
I love plays that stand between madness and genius and this is definitely one of them. Short, concise, vivid, up to what point is absurd theatre really senseless and is it not reality which, when shown naked, seems absurd?
I have mixed feelings about this play. It made me really uncomfortable and anxious 😩 and the ending was a real shock (I'm still at disbelief). It was not a bad play don't get me wrong but like I said it made me anxious;therefore, I didn't enjoy my reading experience.
reread one year later; so much going on in such little space. incredible.
"sometimes a person has to go a very long distance out of his way to come back a short distance correctly."
One of my favorite plays of all time.
I can not stop thinking how the world is such a mad place to live, because this play.
We are all animals.
"Under a spell" is the best way to describe what it was like to read Edward Albee's The Zoo Story. There aren't many playwrights out there as good as Edward Albee.
"If we can so misunderstand, well then, why have we invented the word love in the first place?"
2.5Lu pour la fac. Une pièce assez perturbante et surtout courte. Je pense que pour vraiment la comprendre il faudrait au moins la lire deux fois..
اين جور چيزها مهمه. باور كن؛ مهمه. ما بايد بدونيم كه اعمال ما بالاخره يك عكس العملى هم داره.
The other, Jerry, is a volatile individual who strikes up a conversation.
He begins simply enough, but soon Peter finds himself trapped in conversation with this bizarre man.
As the situation escalates we find ourselves, like Peter, captivated by Jerry’s odd behavior and bizarre stories.
BOTTOM LINE: An extreme example of an individual becoming disillusioned with life and getting lost in the flow of normal society.
“The high points of a person’s life can be appreciated so often only in retrospect.” – From the author’s introduction to the play
