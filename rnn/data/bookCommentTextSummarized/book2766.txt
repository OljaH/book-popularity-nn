Practical thoughts and inspiring anecdotes regarding the overcoming of rejection - and stepping into acceptance.
Quick readVery thought provoking and deep for such a short book. Well written and concise. Readers can gain a lot from this book.
Rejection is such a pervasive issue in our culture.
This is not what God intended!This thin book can easily be read within a couple of hours, yet it deserves careful consideration.
How does it affect our lives and our relationships with others?
All these questions and more are answered biblically and sensitively by Derek Prince.A great book for Sunday school classes, small groups and personal study.
I have given away copies to persons with poor self-esteem, especially those who have suffered divorce or seem to have "bad luck" in relationships with the opposite sex.
Really short read! It was recommended to me, and I'm glad I read it. It helped me to cope with certain things I've let fester for a while, and made me realize that the way we mortal beings love is flawed - but God accepts me, the way I am today. It was an eye-opening read.
Awesome bookThis will definitely shed some light on some of those hidden wounds and feeling of rejection. Great book with a biblical foundation.
An excellent book to reinforce doctrinal points to help with life, but a little formulaic. At the right time, for the right person, it could be quite helpful.
Excellent little book. I would recommend it as a must read for everyone.
