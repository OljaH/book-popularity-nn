From the opening slice of his second viscera-dripping Book o’ Blood, Clive Barker carves into the mind of the reader an apt description of the primary theme explored in this collection:  There is no delight the equal of dread. If it were possible to sit, invisible, between two people on any train, in any waiting room or office, the conversation overheard would time and again circle on that subject. Certainly the debate might appear to be about something entirely different; the state of the natio
For all of Barker's attachment to prose detailing the reduction of the human form into bloody chunks of offal, and his fondness for the loss of bowel control, both of which are most assuredly on display here, the man clearly can write and his stories are generally both imaginative and evocative.
When Barker’s talent for obscene imagery is added as spice to garnish an already terrific story exploring inside the darker cracks of the human psyche, we get a classic Barker banquet of BAM!!.
While I didn’t like this quite as much as the first story, this one is tremendously creative and contains some of Barker's best descriptive work in the entire collection.
Do you know what I like about Clive Barker's stories?  It is the sheer verity of the macabre filled tales he presents for us. If I am sitting down with a Clive Barker story, I know I will be reading something new! Same applies to this collection.

If I am sitting down with a Clive Barker story, I know I will be reading something new!
There are five creepy tales, varying from psychological horror to supernatural horror, from hell sponsored races to superhuman femme fatale, and from monsters that created men to monsters that men create.The collection opens with a dreadful tale called..uh..
But this is probably the weakest of the lot.Overall, Braker's second Book of Blood is almost as good as the first Book of Blood, I especially liked Hell's event and Skins of the father.
This is a well-written and well-constructed book of stories, but already—in his second book of horror fiction—Clive Barker shows evidence of decline.The first “Book of Blood” was obsessed with the fleshiness of mortality, entwined in the corporeal roots of fear.
Barker’s descriptions of these metamorphoses are detailed, and will not soon leave the reader’s mind.) Almost as good is “The Skins of the Fathers”, a story that begins like a drive-in movie with a motorist stranded, out of gas, on the desert, who sees something strange in the distance, shambling across the road.
Volume 2 of Clive Barkers Books of Blood contains 5 positively delectable tales of terror starting with Dread, Quaid is a man who experiments with fear.
Jacqueline Ess: Her Will and Testament was probably my favourite story, a woman fails in a suicide attempt and as a result finds she has abilities worthy of nightmares.
Sex, dismemberment and much worse, this woman's story is totally gripping.
Disturbing horror with a slice of love that takes some searching for but results in an unlikely happyish ending.
Years past saw these creatures mate with a woman from the local town and they've come back to claim the child.
Strange since I usually love the book of blood stories, but it was weird and just kind of pointless.
A man obsessed with fear trials takes it too far to make his point.Hell's Event was my favorite of the group.
Some of the key players have it rigged to turn out demented, of course, but the main character is a diverse individual who comes across fresh and well-rounded.
Jacqueline Ess was an interesting take on a woman who comes into her own power and then takes it to a demented level.
كتب الدم (الكتاب ٢)كلايف باركرمع أفضل مؤلفي قصص الرعب ولكن ليس في أفضل ماكتب.
لا يعني ذلك أن هذه المجموعة القصصية دون المستوى، بل هي ممتعة جدا وكل قصة تقدم فكرة جديدة كليا.

"Dread" - Four stars.
I think the story begins to flag after the vegetarian scene, but it's still a disturbing ride."Hell's Event" Four stars.
A little too political for my liking, but you gotta love Barker's imagination."Jacqueline Ess: Her Will and Testament" Five stars.
Brutal and nasty and sexy and fucking weird.
"The Skins of the Fathers" Five stars.
Monster sex.
Wicked stuff, yo."New Murders in the Rue Morgue" Two stars.
It was okay.
Probably my least favorite Barker story until I find one that's worse.In summation: Nifty little collection, but I think I liked the first volume more.
Dread features a real life possibility, a man who in his quest to beat his fears became an unfeeling monster.

Η πρώτη ιστορία ήταν φανταστική, από τις καλύτερες μικρές ιστορίες που έχω διαβάσει. Οι άλλες έτσι και έτσι. Η αλήθεια είναι ότι περίμενα κάτι πιο δυνατό από το πρώτο βιβλίο. Όπως και να έχει πέρασα ωραία. Θα το συνιστούσα μόνο σε όσους θα ήθελαν να διαβάσουν περισσότερο Barker και όχι σε αυτούς που ξεκινούν να διαβάζουν. Σίγουρα όλες οι ιστορίες είναι καλογραμμένες, αυτό είναι αδιαμφισβήτητο.
Το δεύτερο μέρος είναι ελαφρώς υποδεέστερο του πρώτου οπότε βρίσκεται κάπου στο 4,5/5. Οι ιστορίες είναι όλες το ίδιο απολαυστικές. Δεν μπορώ να πω ότι ξεχώρισα κάποια ή ότι κάποια δε μου άρεσε. Απλά έλειπαν από ανάμεσα οι ιστορίες-βόμβες που είχε το πρώτο χωρίς αυτό να σου χαλάει φυσικά το τρελό ταξίδι που έχεις ξεκινήσει ήδη στον κόσμο του Barker. Αναμένω εννοείται το τρίτο με ανυπομονησία.
The second Books of Blood is a lot less accomplished than its preceding cycle of short stories.
While those were the work of an imagination unhinged, though with purpose, these are less realized--and as a result less successful--flights of dark fancy that only offer thrills at a surface level.
Sure, there are impossible transformations of the flesh, otherworldly beings with inscrutable desires, and the blurring of pain and pleasure as two separate emotions; but here these feel more perfunctory rather than exploratory.
Though a sophomoric work, each of these stories are written in a brisk style that clips along even if what's left behind is often a mess.
Druga "Knjiga krvi" donosi nam pet novih priča koje obiluju vrlo preciznim i do najsitnijih detalja opisanim grozotama - sakaćenja, raspolućene glave, izlomljene kosti, psihička tortura i mnogo čega drugog.
Barker na odličan način hvata svog čitaoca i on, bez obzira na pročitano, uvek traži još.Najjači utisak na mene je ostavila priča "Nova ubistva u ulici Morg" zbog toga što je najveći horor za mene čovekova spremnost da ide i grabi dalje, sve do potpunog ludila i na štetu svih u njegovom okruženju.
Ni druge priče ne zaostaju puno što se utiska tiče, ali ovog puta sam imala favorita.
In 2014 it was announced that Game of Thrones actress Lena Headey was set to star in the movie version of Jacqueline Ess, though IMDB still lists the project as in development (as of Oct 2017).In volume 2, like the previous volume, some stories really worked for me and others were fell into the good not great category.
On this re-read the stories that absolutely destroyed me (in a good way) were the last three:"Jacqueline Ess: Her Will And Testament""The Skins of the Fathers""New Murders in the Rue Morgue"Well worth re-reading and if you've never read any of the Books of Blood: Volumes One to Three I suggest fixing that immediately.
My favorite from this volume was probably The Skins of the Fathers.
But things don’t end quite as Quaid expects as he experiences the ultimate lesson in dread.Though this story was a slow starter once it got moving it didn’t let up.
The “demons”, determined to fix a cataclysmic error made eons ago, may be the only decent characters here but they’re not all that bright either.I liked the idea behind this story but in the end some of the actions of the monsters just didn’t make a whole lot of sense.New Murder in the Rue MorgueLewis returns to Paris at the request of life long friend Catherine.
Back in 1984, Clive Barker made his name within the deeply competitive world of horror with the publication of the first three volumes of the macabre short stories 'The Books Of Blood'.
The story was later adapted by Fred Burke in 1992 into the Eclipse Books graphic novel 'Dread' where it was illustrated by Dan Brerton.
The story was later adapted in 1990 into the graphic novel 'Tapping The Vein - Book 4' where it was illustrated by Steven E.
The story was later adapted in 1989 into the graphic novel 'Tapping The Vein - Book 2' where it was illustrated by Klaus Janson.
Адска надпревара - много добро, напомни ми малко по стил на Геймън.
Дарба, която може да ви струва живота.4.
Нови убийства на улица "Морг" - реверанс към големия Едгар Алън По и едноименния му разказ.
И кой убива хората на улица Морг - отново ли е човекоподобна маймуна, или нещо друго?За разлика от изброениете, Клайв не притежава моментната липса на логика при Кунц, не се стреми да открие отговора на живота, човека, отношенията между хората и вселенската истина като Кинг, ползвайки хоръра за целта, или пък да ни очарова с нереално изкривената си визия за реалността като Геймън.
The second book of blood was just as good as the first one for me. I think there was more gory stuff in this one though. Any way there are 5 stories i liked them all so i give this 5 stars:) Underneath all the sick bloody stuff there are some serious themes in these stories. I like that. The skins of the fathers was the most gruesome i think:D I will be reading vol 3 for sure
I loved Books of Blood volume 1 and loved this one even more. All five stories are 4.5 to 5 star quality. My only experience with Barker are these first two Books of Blood and I'm blown away with how this guy writes. Dare I say that this guy might be up there with the likes of King himself? Highly recommend these Books of Blood for those (like me) who are new to this author.
Dread***Hell's Event**Jacqueline Ess****The Skins of the Fathers****New Murders in the Rue Morgue***
However, I felt like I didn’t need to read details about how Davidson soiled his pants out of fear or that then creature’s genitals were erect.
This story read very quickly, but like previous tales, didn’t feel wholly captivating.
Out of all the previous stories, this one is quite reminiscent of Pig Blood Blues in that it has a mystery involving a creature and an ending that feels very familiar.
(Geez Clive, getting a bit too excited there?) At this moment, I find it hard to recall just how many times I’ve read the word “whore,” but it’s just about everywhere here.
On the whole, I enjoyed this follow-up collection...just a tiny bit less than the first one. The two standout stories of the five for me were 'Dread,' for its ability to unsettle and disturb, and 'The Skins of the Fathers,' for the cinematic visuals and pacing. On to book 3.
Когато една книга стане събитие, веднага се усеща – имам чувството, че всеки блогър, чиито писания уважавам, вече си е дал мнението за втория том ужас и карантиийки на Баркър, та съвсем естествено и аз се нареждам на опашката от хайпващи колко точно добър и ужасяващ е този човек всъщност.
След този парещ под пръстите старт, Баркър ни повежда в Адска напревара, където нищо неподозиращи атлети се борят не за поредното тенекиено медалче, а за балансът на силите между непоявяващото се добро и твърде отчетливо материалното зло.
Затваряме последната корица с тремор в дясното слепоочие и насочваме ужасен взор към огледалото, където може би се крие следващата кървава книга на душите ни.
To prove this, he stages a couple of experiments that force a couple of unlucky souls to face their wirst fears.
In the end, Quinn's study comes back to haunt him and he is forced to face his own fears with disastrous results.
Since Quinn never voices his own fears and dreads in the story, the fact that his attacker just happens to get the exact thing that would press Quinn's buttons right seems a little far-fetched to me."Hell's Event" -- Satan sends a runner to participate in a marathon.
The images at the end of this tale (of human beings trapped in concrete) will never be forgotten.
Това е разказ за онова най-важно първично чувство, биологически зададено от природата, което направлява живота, оцеляването и поведението на по-сложните организми.
Криминалният полъх и дъха на 19-ти век се усещат, но отново са изкривени от въображението на Баркър.Общо взето Баркър запазва нивото от предишния сборник, дори само заради безбожния разказ "Кожите на бащите" си заслужава да се прочете.
Разказите във том 2 са изпълнени с похот, първични и тъмни страсти, с много ужас и страх, но на моменти нещата сякаш са предвидими.
I liked this story.
My favorite thing was that it was told from the POV of one of the psycho's friends-turned-subjects, even when the poor guy has gone completely nuts.Hell's Event - Every 100 years, Satan sends a representative to run a race against the best the human world has to offer.
She kills a few people, becomes a prostitute, ends up killing herself and the only guy who ever really loved her by using her powers during sex.
It was not quite like any Others-use-human-incubators story I can ever recall reading before.
I love you, but this story was just stupid.
Най-доброто нещо, което съм чел от автора.Адска надпревара – Като пъзела в Хелрейзър и този разказ е скрит зад няколко нива на възприятие.
Като никога, обаче краят е щастлив.Кожите на бащите – Едно малко градче, пълно с прости селяци, отказващи да приемат различното, от страх да не лъснат собствените им комплекси за импотентност, неграмотност и слабохарактерност, тръгват на обречен кръстоносен поход, в който ще унищожат бъдещето си.Нови убиства на улица „Морг” – Поклон към По, но и собствена интерпретация на страховете от дивото, отказващо контрол.
Разкошен разказ на тема какво е да си човек.
Barker was the master of Horror short stories in the eighties and all the stories hold up very well.
It is remembered with good reason, it is a powerful story that in many ways predates and proves the wrongs of the excessive trend of torture porn in horror.
I didn’t remember this story at all.
I did enjoy it.I have never forgotten “The Skins of the Father,” which is the most Lovecraftian of Barker shorts( not that it is very Lovecraftian, but as close as Barker gets).
Skins holds up very well and even though I remembered it still came across as powerful.
Продължението на ужаса – “Кървави книги 2″ на Клайв Баркър: http://knigolandia.info/book-review/k...БАРКЪРРРРРРРР!
След точно година чакане – той е пак тук!
И вторият том на “Кървави книги” носи изтънчената доза хедонистичен ужас, в която човешкото замира, цивилизацията се смъква като изгоряла кожа и отдолу се оголват първичните инстинкти – натегнати, готови да повярват във всичко, защото не знаят откъде може да дойде опасността.
За тях спокойствието е някаква коварна измама и всяка ситуация може да се окаже път към Ада – точно според вкуса на Клайв Баркър.
И мигновено се настроих към вълната от първичен шок и перверзна наслада, които ме очакваха.
Не останах разочарован.http://knigolandia.info/book-review/k...
“Aunque no lo supieran, su odio era antiguo, lo llevaban en la sangre.”Caramba, simplemente Barker siempre me termina por sorprender y desgarrar por dentro.
Especialmente en esta segunda serie de sus aclamados Libros de Sangre, demuestra que en sus manos, cualquier historia de terror que podría ser rutinaria, cobra dimensiones escalofriantes.
Está, además su capacidad por recrear en la mente del lector las escenas de sus historias, casi de manera cinematográfica, bien dice Ramsey Campbell, sus relatos reclaman ser ilustrados como los de ningún otro autor.
Recomendable si eres fan del terror original, gore y con sugerencias sexuales (que maneja estética y maravillosamente).
Simplemente un autor imprescindible.
