This is probably my least favorite of Rizzoli and Isles series. I suppose it is all the demon possession parts of the story. I prefer regular old fashioned sociopaths.
Even more disturbing is the discovery that Dr. Joyce O’Donnell is a member and evidence suggests the killer is somehow connected to her.
This was a creepy story that focused on one of my least favorite topics.
There’s a secondary storyline involving Maura and Daniel Brody that I did find interesting as well as the story surrounding the killer who is identified at the beginning.
Even though this wasn’t my most favorite of the stories in the series, it still was pretty interesting and had an exciting climax.
Ever since Maura Isles got the spotlight in this series, I've been complaining how pathetic she is when it comes to her love life.
Seriously, she keeps on trying to fall in love to every attractive guy who looks at her.
How come a logical and level-headed medical examiner can make such stupid moves is beyond me.Anyway, The Memphisto Club is the sixth book in the Rizzoli and Isles series.

Mephistopheles was the evil spirit that appeared to Faustus after he drew secret symbols.
The author presents various interpretations of the messages the killer is sending through his drawings and more disturbing signs.
In The Mephisto Club, quite clearly, evil does exist, whether one believes that the source is human or spirit.
It amazes me that Tess Gerritsen is able to write such awesome thrillers, time after time.
And yet she does, proving that she is, quite simply, at the top of her game--and at the top of the psychological thriller/mystery genre!
Many others have outlined the plot of THE MEPHISTO CLUB, so let me just say a few things: this is a great storyline, original, and handled deftly.
I loved that Father Brophy and Dr. Maura Isles finally "got together," but I need this relationship to go beyond THE THORN BIRDS!!
My only complaint with the story is Jane Rizzoli, who I actually love.
Tess Gerritsen Fans Group Link  A nice read with Rizzoli & Isles, Christmas Eve is spoiled in Boston. A Latin word "Peccavi" & crosses (written upside down) are left in blood on bodies. The Latin word means "I Have Sinned". Upside down crosses are against "Chtistanity".Severed body parts from one murder are swap with another part at the next murder. A symbol is left on Maura's door causing her fear.A Mephisto Club member, Dr. Joyce O'Donnell (psychiatrist), appears but not much "help"
A Latin word "Peccavi" & crosses (written upside down) are left in blood on bodies.
A symbol is left on Maura's door causing her fear.A Mephisto Club member, Dr. Joyce O'Donnell (psychiatrist), appears but not much "help" - she never liked Jane in the past.The Mephisto Club leader is Antony Samson (neuropsychologist), additional members are: Edwina Felway, Oliver Stark & Gottfried Baum.They are devoted to the analysis & history of the Evil & Devils who "walk the earth".The main character becomes Lily Saul with a "evil" Christianity spirit & a "fallen" angel (Devil) after her?
Can Rizzoli & Isles find a murderer -or- the Mephisto Club stop a demon?At the end, can Lily's donated family house to the town's Fireman, for a training burn, eliminate demons...
I already have favorite authors that write about secret societies, Dan Brown & James Rollins, and I truly wanted Gerritsen to be my new favorite author in my new favorite category all by itself, medical thrillers.
Not what I thought it was going to be, and not who I thought would typically join this club, (view spoiler)[ Dr. O'Donnell, who ends up dying and then we never have to deal with the love to hate her relationship that Gerritsen has so elaborately written for us (hide spoiler)]This one just did not do it for me.
I’m unsure if this is because it has been so long since I read Vanish or whether it was the story itself but I’m hoping I’ll enjoy The Keepsake a lot more.The one thing I can clearly attribute to my lowered enjoyment is the attention paid to the private life of Isles.
I’m not sure what it is about her in particular, but I’m nowhere near as invested in her life.In terms of the specific story of this one, it’s quite different to the prior books.
كوني من متابعي مسلسل Rizzoli & Isles ..هو ما أوقعني في هذه الورطة منذ البداية .سعدت حينَ رأيت اسم الكاتبة وقررت قراءة روايتها فوراً ، والرواية أيضاً بطريقة ما ، مرتبطة بالمسلسل .لكن ، أنا نادمة الآن .رواية رديئة ، ومع هذا تحتمَ على إنهائها فـ لازلنا في بداية العام والوقت مبكر لترك أحد الكتب بدون إكماله ..ليست مشوقة أو مثيرة ، فقط مجرد حديث طويل ، طويل ، وغير منطقي .ولا تتحسن الأمور ولا تتطور ، فـ الرواية تحافظ على مستواها السيء طوال عدد صفحاتها الـ 400 :/لن أقرأ مرة أخرى لـ تيس جريتسين وسأكتفي بمشاهدة المسلسل ..
Wieder ein toller Teil der Rizzoli&Isles Reihe - Die privaten Geschehnisse zu den beiden Haupt-Protagonistinnen kamen mir dieses mal ein wenig zu kurz; ich mag die beiden einfach so gerne. Der Fall war aber spannend und abwechslungsreich, wenn auch ein wenig vorhersehbar. Trotzdem freue ich mich auf die folgenden Bände - Ich bin ja gerade mal bei der Hälfte :)Tess Gerritsen schreibt einfach toll und als Hörbuch ist die Reihe auch sehr gut umgesetzt!
It's a chilling Christmas greeting for Boston medical examiner Maura Isles and Detective Jane Rizzoli, who swiftly link the victim to controversial celebrity psychiatrist Joyce O'Donnell - Maura's professional nemesis and member of a secret society called "The Mephisto Club."On tony Beacon Hill, the club's acolytes devote themselves to the analysis of evil: Can it be explained by science?
The members begin to fear the very subject of their study.
Have they inadvertently summoned an evil entity from the darkness?Delving deep into the most baffling and unusual case of their careers, Maura and Jane embark on a terrifying journey to the very heart of evil - where they encounter a malevolent foe more dangerous than any they have ever faced...one whose work is only just beginning.
I remember, the first book did not really strike me as great, but it was good enough for me to want to read the second one.
Jane and Maura are tracking an evil force.
But the both have personal issues that cloud their minds.
Jane’s parents are having marital problems and Maura has fallen in love with a practicing Catholic Priest.
The suspense and mystery of this novel are excellent but the personal issues add additional substance to the story.
I’m always surprised at how much I enjoy this series and want to find the next book to add to my TBR.
I still am loving these books!
I enjoyed the story, but was a bit lost when the talk about mythology and religion came into play.
I felt at times that took over the story when there needed to be more focus on the killer and the investigation.
I know my reviews are vague, but I don't like throwing out too many details that will ruin a reader's decision to read any book.
I'm excited to start the next rizzoli and isles book!
Fingers crossed Maura gets her love life in order, she's all over the map in this one!
This one didn't work for me. The guilty party was identified early and then we go through a history lesson on the myth of demons. The Mephisto Club itself was a group of creepy people. Although I did like a certain character getting in too deep (I won't spoil). I didn't like Maura having the affair with the Priest and wished their relationship hadn't progressed that far. The ending set up at a remote location seemed too much like a plot device versus something that would happen.Although this one was a bust, I'm definitely continuing this series.
I hate it when this series focuses on Maura's boring love life. How a smart woman can make nothing but stupid choices where her romantic relationships are concerned is beyond me.
E sad, imam jedno pitanje koje upućujem svim ovim prevodiocima koji nam dozvole da se, čitajući neku baš dobru knjigu, u nekom trenutku "smorimo", jer, gle čuda, prevode nedajbože: ljudi, da li vi imate neki rok, pre nego što nabacate prevod samo, kada, na primer, istražite pokoju "činjenicu" iz date knjige?
Na prvu pomislih, greška u kucanju, na drugu rekoh možda je tastatura samo prebacila slovo, eto tako, a čelni ljudi ne primetiše, ali kad videh da do kraja piše OtkrIvenje umesto OtkrOvenje, baš mi je ubilo želju da nastavim sa čitanjem.
Malumunuz tema Amerikanvari polisiye olunca vahşice ve ustaca işlenmiş bir cinayet kaçınılmaz.
Şeytan ve şeytani diğer varlıkların ruhani birer varlık olmak dışında, kanlı, canlı, gerçek yaratıklar olduğuna ve insanlar arasında elini kolunu sallaya sallaya dolaştığına inanan, elit, entelektüel ve bir o kadar zengin kimselerden oluşan Mefisto Kulübü yardım için orada.
Fakat bu durum, dünya üzerinde yaşayan şeytani varlıklara hiçbir şekilde inanmayan Jane için tam bir işkence.Öte yandan çeviri kurgu ile tamamen ters orantılı olarak felaket, hatta korkunç.
Hani Tess Gerritsen bir gün Türkçe öğrenip şu kitabı okumaya kalksa yayınevini mahkemeye verir.
Böyle bir şey olabilir mi ya?
تنطلق الرواية من ماتم دفت وتأبين احد افراد اسرة طبيب في احد المقابر، ويبدأ تسلسل الاحداث وعمليات القتل الغامضة و الانتقام وتشوية الجثث المتعمد لارسال رسائل مشفرة للضحية التالية.
المؤلفة طبيبة متخصصة في الطب الشرعي وقد استفادت من تخصصها و وظفت خبرتها ومعرفتها العلمية والعملية في مجريات الاحداث وفي التفاصيل الدقيقة التي لا يلم بها الا الخبير وكانت مفيدة للقارئ.
احداث الرواية تجري مع الاستعداد للاحتفال براس السنة الميلادية وبرودة الطقس وانعكاس هذه الاحداث والمؤثرات على فريق التحري و ايضاً الطبيبة الشرعية.
الرشوة والفساد حاضر في الرواية وله تاثير على سير الاحداث.
I started with this book and it worked as a stand alone, but there are references to previous books in the series that loyal readers no doubt recognize.The story begins with a murder on Christmas Eve that appears to be a satanic ritual.
The medical examiner Isles works with her.Yes, there are undertones of Patricia Cornwell in this but the author is a medical doctor and her knowledge lends an air of authenticity to the story.
Overall, I thought it was a good read.
I plan to go back and read the other books in the series.
Hair raisin. I was scared and spooked reading this.... Great.
Net als voorgaande delen weer heerlijk spannend!
Similar to the Da Vinci Code in terms of symbol/demon hunters, disappointing ending.
You're much better at that than at this symbolism stuff.The only character who remained the same and lovable was Rizzoli, but even she managed to disappoint me a bit by simply not being there.
Also, I want Gabriel's POV back!The story was still a bit gruesome, but honestly, it's gotten a bit predictable if Gerritsen is going to include some totally random-seeming POV to the story that this character is going to be pivotal to the entire case and that particular character is going to break the case in some sort of way.
Another Rizzoli and Isles book draws to a close for me.
I still feel sorry for Maura.
She deserves happiness.As for the friendship between Maura and Jane I still want in the books what I see in the tv series.
They are friends but it just doesn't feel like a deep friendship.
I don't see a great deal of closeness, just judgement and anger at times.
I think she is a great writer but I don't feel the closeness between Jane and Maura.
Perhaps it is supposed to be that way but I wish for more.Looking forward to reading more in this series but time to get away from murder and into a romance.
Tess man yra detektyvų karalienė 🤩😍 Tad visad labai malonu sugrįžti prie jos knygų ir žinau, jog laukia tikrai įtampos bei jaudulio kupini puslapiai.Kalėdų išvakarėse detektyvė Džeinė Ricoli yra iškviečiama į siaubingo nusikaltimo vietą, kur žiauriai buvo nužudyta jauna moteris.Į nusikaltimo vietą taip pat atvyksta ir medicinos ekspertė Mora Ailz.
Tad iš jos knygų tikiuosi nemažai.
Taip pat skaitydama šią knygą sužinojau nemažai detalių iš Biblijos, kas buvo iš ties man labai įdomu.Mitologijos įpinimas buvo įdomus autorės sprendimas.Tess gerbėjai, kas dar neskaitėte - siūlau tai padaryti, o kas vis svarstote ar pradėti pažintį su šia rašytoja, tai net neabejokite.
But the best part of this book was the character development of Rizzoli and Isles.Isles and the priest...I was literally driving down the road listening to the audiobook shouting down the road like someone had just cut me off.
I was losing my mind at the drama and intensity of it all, I almost had to pull over.
It's what I have been waiting for for six books now!Finally, Rizzoli's conflict with her parents was great.
I love that they incorporated that into the TV series as well as the book series.
Mais um fabuloso livro com a dupla Rizzolil & Isles, sendo que esta autora nunca desilude quem gosta do estilo de literatura policial, com thriller e muito suspense misturados.Desta vez a autora aborda o tema do mal e da existência de Satanás... se há luz também há trevas, se há bem também há mal, se existe Deus também existe o Diabo???Questões que nos fazem pensar e que fazem as detectives Rizzoli e Isles partirem em busca de respostas para questões antigas... mas que no entanto parecem tão recentes.Livro 5 estrelas!!!
Super je vratiti se dobroj "staroj" Tess!
While there are characters in The Mephisto Club much in the same vein of Dan Brown’s DiVinci Code -- those who believe in the fantastical tales of the ancient church -- Gerritsen uses her believers as the questioning voices trying to find a deeper, more mystical reason for evil.
Because the books are part of a series, Gerritsen is fortunate that she has many books and chances to develop her characters, making them more interesting and rich as she progresses.The Mephisto Club is another example of a great page-turning read.
So, The Mephisto Club was right up my alley with Rizzoli and Isles being one of my favorite mystery series and with it being about demons/the Devil.While I didn't really love Vanish (the book previous to this one) because I didn't find it as page-turning as Tess Gerritsen's other novels, I absolutely did not have that problem with The Mephisto Club.
Some of the things mentioned I have heard about, but most I didn't so I find it much more interesting than her other Rizzoli and Isles series.
When it comes to the main characters' plots in the book, I wasn't as interested in them as I was about the whole Nephilism thing.
