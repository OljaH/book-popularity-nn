I am very fond of extraordinarily handsome rats. <3 Even better than I remembered, and now I have to read the sequel to find out what happened to everybody.Reread for our monthly classics readalong--discussion on the blog this Friday!
For one, I was thinking as I read that Mrs. Frisby is a pretty unusual character for a children's book.
And she definitely thinks like an adult; she notices things like how young Justin seems, worries about taking care of her family, misses her husband.
It's kind of cool.The other thing I noticed was just how few female characters there are in the book.
This lack is somewhat counterbalanced by what a brave and strong character Mrs. Frisby is -- but it DID annoy me that she didn't even get a first name.
I loved this book so much as a young teen, I read it over and over and over.
This is probably the book that started me off on my lifelong love of fantasy, together with Watership Down.
But once Mrs. Frisby met the rats and they told her their story, the book picked up a lot.
I had forgotten a lot of the storyline.
A nice rollercoaster.In the end I liked the story so much that I wouldn't mind reading a sequel, to find out how the story continues for our heroes.
This book captivated me from start to finish when I read it - for the first time - as an adult.
It's hard to imagine anyone not being moved by "The Rats of Nimh" and its characters are well-developed and not easily forgotten.
The science aspect is interesting and makes the animal characters even more realistic and memorable.
I've read reviews about what the author's intention was, pointing to the various themes - from science playing with nature to self-determination to morality - present in the story.
This ambiguity make "The Rats of Nimh" all the more interesting.
That is when Mrs. Frisby started to find ways they could move without getting Timothy sick again.
The rats moved Mrs. Frisby's entire house for her family to be safe and warm.
2. The main conflict in the book is when Mrs. Frisby's family is in danger from the plowing day.
However, because of Timothy's sickness, they couldn't take a chance of moving.
However, after Mrs. Frisby's hard work, the rats decided to help her solve the problem.
How Mrs. Frisby tried to save her children gave me an another thought of rats, who really cared of each other just like humans.
How is it these rats can illuminate their entire underground nest with Christmas lights, but every year thousands of Americans cannot decorate their trees???
This is a book that I had fond memories of from originally reading it in the 4th grade.
Naturally, I was a bit concerned that my memory of the book would be let down by the passage of time.
Thankfully, I was wrong.This is a great story full of memorable characters and plenty of adventure that keeps the pages turning.
Children and adults alike will enjoy this award-winning novel and it is written in such a way that it really doesn't seem that juvenile.Overall, a great story with a lot of heart.
I forgot how much I love this book.
I was a little nervous re-reading it because I hadn't read it since I was a kid and I was worried that it wouldn't hold up well, but I needn't have worried.
The book is just as wonderful now as it was then.One of the things I find very interesting now is the way that humans are portrayed.
Not bad or good, but just very human.
Going about their lives not really appreciating how they affect everything around them.
But also not entirely clueless.This book will always hold a special place in my heart.
I enjoy a story from an animal's perspective, so that part was cool.
But the sci-fi aspect of this turned me off a bit.
I love how the rats banded together to help the mice, and the backstory behind that (although that's the bit that brought in the sci-fi aspect).
I also alternated between reading and listening to this.
Am I the only one who finds Barbara Caruso's narration prissy and annoying lol.
Not sure, but I think when I go back to reread the first three Anne of Green Gables series, I will be sure to choose other narrations.
Anyway I'm glad I read it.
„Doamna Frisby și șobolanii de la institut” mi s-a părut o carte tare faină, care trece cu brio testul unui cititor adult: e inteligentă și plină de imaginație, foarte bine scrisă, cu un suspans bine dozat și o încărcătură emoțională puternică.
N-ai cum să n-o iubești pe doamna Frisby, simbolul mamei ideale, de care se va atașa, probabil, orice copil care-i citește povestea.
This is the Newberry Award winning book for 1973, and this was there main reason I wanted to read it.
The story has aged really well because there isn't anything to date it, like mentioning popular fashion choices of the time, so really anyone can read it.
The second complaint is that I'm not super happy that we don't know what happened to Justin the Rat either.
In my opinion, it might be better to read this book by oneself instead of in a group.
However you choose to read this story you'll be happy.
I think it was my second-grade teacher who read this to us in class, like a chapter a day, or something.I was so into this book, I made my mom take me to the library where I checked it out so I could read ahead to find out what was coming.
But I didn't want the entire thing spoiled, so I only read a chapter ahead.In fifth grade, this was available through RIF and I remember seeing the copy on the folding table among all the many other free books.
I adored that movie ("A sparkly!"), my family and I had seen it at the Drive-In and have been quoting it ever since.I loved this book as it was read and as I read ahead.
I thought this was the best book about rats and mice I have ever read!!! It was fun and the story line was great. I kind of feel bad for them now.... (not that bad where I want to save them or have one as a pet) Great characters and a mommy mouse that loves her family so much she will put her life in jeopardy to save them. Feel good book full of imagination.
This is my very own book order copy from back in Ye Olden Tymes, when I was a wee Jessie.
One of my favorite movies then, and still much loved, I also loved this book.
My kids really loved it, too, and got super into it.
But I have to say, this is one of those that did have improvements made for the movie.
The character of Jeremy Crow, who is only briefly in the book, is much more fun in the movie.
And the bulk of the book is Nicodemus describing NIMH, rather pedantically.
She read a few pages and declared it to be boring.
I loved this book when I was kid.
I reread it to try to figure out if there was something wrong with me, with her, or with this book.
I read the first few pages and realized why this doesn't appeal to her.
And I always loved the crazy rat experiments that made them super smart and never aging (they even tricked the scientist!).
This book has it all, even a cliffhanger that makes me want to run out and find the sequel, which strangely enough, I can't remember reading as a kid.
This was always one of my favorite movies as a child, though I still love it now, and I was very excited to read the book.
This book was thoroughly entertaining and extremely amusing.
I loved reading about the rats and their adventuresThis was a wonderful story about heroism and courage and it will worm it's way into your heart.
The story is very well written and the characters are those with depth and are extremely memorable.
This book is easily one of my favorites and I'm glad I read it!I gave this book 5 magical stars!
I liked the way the rats were intelligent and i also like the part were brutus is guarding the gate. i also saw the movie.
Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of Nimh by Robert C.
Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of NIMH is a delightful story, full of mystery, adventure, science, and compassion.
In short, we loved this Newbery Award winning classic.Mrs. Frisby may be just a little mouse, but she is full of heart and courage.
While there, the owl advises her to ask for help from the rats, but everyone knows the rats keep to themselves.Will they help her in time to save her little family?Such a sweet, fun story, it almost made me like mice.

A lot like Watership Down but slightly less important and infinitely easier to finish. It's probably been ten years since the last time I read this which is weird to think about. If you live in Springfield, I'm starting a book club and this is the first book we're reading; come to the downtown library tomorrow evening if you wanna be in it. You don't have to have a copy or have started reading it yet.
What a fun, sweet and informative little book Mrs Frisby and The Rats of NIMH was.
These were no ordinary rats though, as they held an incredible secret.🐀There is something I find really endearing and eye opening to see the world of humans through the perspective of a weak and frightened animal.
Much as I found with Watership Down, Rats of NIMH really made me think about how humans treat animals; how we effect their lives in so many ways, how little we show consideration, for example caging wild animals for our own enjoyment.
Although the central theme was on Mrs. Frisby's struggle to relocate her home, there was also this larger backstory on how the rats of NIMH became so intelligent and their connection to Mrs. Frisby's family that I really got caught up in.
I can't understand why everybody talks about changing things." "Because everything we have is stolen." "That's silly." " Is it stealing when farmers take milk from cows, or eggs from chickens?" It's was also so easy to get caught up in the characters, lovely Mrs. Frisby, Mr. Ages, Nicodemus and Justin.
It just seems like it was always there, enticing me to pick it up and read it.But who would ever want to read a book about some rats?Apparently, lots of people - including me...
eventually.After watching the book grow dusty on the shelf for several summers, I finally picked it up and gave it a try.
It became my favorite book and I read it at least 4 more times after that.I'm not quite sure how well it will hold up over time, but I want to present it to my daughter as an option because of how much I enjoyed it as a child.
Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of Nimh starts out feeling like a simple sweet woodland animal tale, similar to Peter Rabbit, but with mice instead of bunnies. However, it turned out to be so much more! Action, plot twists, a dead husband’s mysterious past, mutant rodents with electricity underground: all this in addition to the sweet Beatrix Potter-style gentle mother love. A fun read that kept both my nine and eleven-year-old’s rapt attention.
3 STARS"Mrs. Frisby, a widowed mouse with four small children, must move her family to their summer quarters immediately, or face almost certain death. But her youngest son, Timothy, lies ill with pneumonia and must not be moved. Fortunately, she encounters the rats of NIMH, an extraordinary breed of highly intelligent creatures, who come up with a brilliant solution to her dilemma." (From Amazon)Loved the movie version as a kid and then read it in school and liked the book.
Mrs. Frisby's son is sick, she gets medicine from Mr. Ages, moving day is upon them, she goes to the Great Owl, he says ask the rats to move the house, she does, they do, and there you go.
After having read the delightful Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of NIMH, I now know that the movie version was needlessly traumatizing.Here's what I think happened.
But Mrs Frisby has overheard the farmer and his sons talking, and realises he is planning to plough the area where the mouse home resides.
The rats decide to help move the mouse home so that it will escape the ploughing, and the story mostly deals with this and the rats own plight.Part of the book deals with the narration to Mrs Frisby of the rats origin - which is where NIMH comes into it.
I changed that, assuming it was a boo-boo.This is my second mouse-focused fantasy book.
The first was "Redwall" "Stuart Little" is not about a mouse, though most people seem to think it is.
As I recall it, the description given of Stuart is "a little boy who looked a lot like a mouse."This is the kind of book I need to be reading right now.
Mostly involving a hideous farm cat.
Cat's are born killers.
Lest one assume it's just for little kids, some bad stuff does happen and critters do die, some in rather nasty ways.
This was a really great book, I'm so surprised that I hadn't read it before now. I loved the characters and the plot. I loved the ending. This was a great book! I did not, however, like the movie adaptation of this book.
This was excellent. I've never rooted for rats to live before. All the kids (5-9) loved it.
