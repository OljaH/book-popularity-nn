But I truly love her in the way you love someone — or something — that you know with your whole heart is making the world a better place to live.
And I am positive of this fact when it comes to this woman.After a hard day, her humor and generosity and overall love for people and life are a balm on the world's aches.
We take a lot for granted, and I think that's why some people say it's better to live each day as our last.
While I don't watch Ellen's talk show, I do really like her and have read her other books.
One chapter is made up entirely of her making sounds.
A few chapters are short, fictional stories, similar to: "A woman walks down the beach, and sees the waves.
chapter tweeeeenty FIVE!), then launching into the text in a sort of bored voice.
Chapters I've listened to since last posting: Ellen ate an apple.
That's it.)A fake dream.Ellen saying, "Yes, no, yes.

Have you seen tumblr? I don't mean the pretty pictures. I mean this:You get the point. This is what Ellen's book is like. It is filled with the most random, sparse and off tangent thoughts I've ever had the opportunity to read.
She hosts the syndicated talk show The Ellen DeGeneres Show, i enjoyed this book so much i love Ellen i watch her show she is so funny , one of my favourite chapters, “What Would Jesus Do?” All these polls do is make everyone so judgmental.
And I don’t believe in judgment.
"It must be around 40, when you're 'over the hill.' I don't even know what that means and why it's a bad thing.
When I go hiking and I get over the hill, that means I'm past the hard part and there's a snack in my future."
There's quite a few things I was to discuss, so let's start with the things I enjoyed:• The comedic timing.• The author sharing details and the behind the scenes of her talk show, interviewing guests and how she needs to keep talking and talking and talking for hours.• how the audiobook had certain chapters that got background noises, such as beach waves, rain drops, casino noises...• DeGeneres repeatedly mentioning her want for a Nemo sequel.• when she talked about the environment, coming out, being happy, veganism, and becoming a cover girl.But I feel like everything that was important was glossed over.
You wanna read/listen to an amusing little time waster and you like Ellen DeGeneres' style of humor?
You could go to the movie theater for nearly 3 hours and pay less--and probably have just as good or a better time.Of course, that probably sounds like I hated the book.
I cracked a smile quite a few times and laughed a few others (and I'm not a big one to laugh while reading or listening to a book).
But those references are few and far between, so keep your eyes and ears open or you are bound to miss it.All in all, while there are some really good parts, a lot of the 3 hours just felt like filler.
Seriously...I'm bored. And shocked. This audio is not well read by the author (how is that even possible?). There is little affect, there are no pauses, and it seemed like even she was racing to get to the end. The content was all over the place. I really like Ellen and I've always found her funny. I guess her humor doesn't translate well to books for me. Reading it for audio, it didn't seem like she found it funny, either. Sadly, 1 star.
I laughed out so hard, God i love Ellen 💙
Although I really like Ellen, I thought this book was pretty lame. Old material from past comedy shows, and random thoughts. I was hoping for just a little information on Ellen herself...no. Yes, it got a few laughs out of me, but seriously? Oh, she's kidding.
5 GLORIOUS STARS!!!
is what I wanted to give Seriously...I'm Kidding when I first picked it up.
The peace and kindness message is great, but this lacks the funny far too much for an autobio from a comedian.
I love Ellen DeGeneres.
Wait, let me back up.
I love the idea of Ellen DeGeneres.
I really like her show.
Her stand-up...meh.
Unfortunately, this book is more like her stand-up.
Literally intentional silence.
I would've preferred more silence.I'd say about halfway through I thought Seriously...I'm Kidding deserved about 3 stars, but the latter half took a complete nose-dive.
One of my favorite parts: "It's so rare for people to actually set aside time to curl up with a book and read.
By the way, I don't know you have to curl up to a book, but that's what people say.
What position will you be in?''I'm gonna curl up.''Oh, good.
I'm gonna curl up.''Okay, good.
So you end up just sitting and staring at each other until you both start texting other people."I laughed and laughed and found that I wanted to continue on reading just so I could laugh some more.

The actual book is disjointed, overly quirky, and not remotely an autobiography like its blurb suggests.
Ellen DeGeneres is best experienced through cute quips.
It was particularly ridiculous when Ellen chastised society for preferring shorter, impersonal communication (e.g. twitter) and then talked about the importance of reading books.
I would have been happy to read and buy this book for what it was - a brief, funny examination of the thought process of a family-friendly comedian - if the publisher hadn't tried to gauge the public by charging $30 to read it!If you're a fan of Ellen and desperate to read this book, just sit in the bookstore and read it for free.
This book is a bunch of absurd disorderly ideas. But it still deserves 4 stars. Why? Well because it makes me laugh and clap, which many other books cannot.
Seriously...I'm Kidding by Ellen DeGeneres is a goofy, cute, and at-times comical book.
The book is supposed to highlight what's going on in Ellen's life but I'm able to pick out very little of what I think are actually real slices of her life when the rest is just meant to amuse and distract the reader.This is not a memoir, a biography, or a serious book of any genre or nature.
I'm not sure if you're even supposed to say it's for adults or for children, or even teens.
I wanted to hear jokes or more about Ellen's life, but instead, I got chapters where she encouraged me to recycle, to be happy, and to meditate.
(See the title.) She even took a few jabs at Oprah in the book, which made me laugh.In one chapter, Ellen mentions a time when Portia thought she discovered a new species of animal, but it just turned out to be a javelina.
I really would have appreciated a picture of a javelina in the book.
It wouldn't even have to be the SPECIFIC javelina that Portia and Ellen saw.
Other pictures from Ellen's stories would have been welcomed as well.
Ellen DeGeneres is one of my favorite TV personalities.
I watch her shows almost like an addict!
So naturally I was very excited about reading her book.
But I am disappointed!First of all, it was not an actual book for me.
I would rather love to call it a journal or something that one writes in an informal way!And the contents of it were another issue for me.
Well, I really expected to laugh out loud reading her book just like I do while watching her shows.
I found out pretty dull and if you watch her shows then you know most of these facts already!
Seriously....it wasn't funny
Overall, the book was wonderful.
It had so many laugh-out-loud moments.
What made it even better, was that there were many great advices.
Humor aside, Ellen Degeneres is a very cool woman and is easy to relate to.
Aside from the fact that she is rich and famous :).The reason I'm taking away one star is because some of the jokes just didn't translate as well on the paper.
Without her tone of voice and facial expressions, it's just wasn't the same.
It's all just minor hick ups, I would still recommend this book.
Go Ellen!
It is probably best that I just let people think that I'm laughing at them rather than explaining about how I'm laughing at Ellen's joke about "getting back on the horse" where she preteded she was actually getting back on those little merry-go-round pay coin-pay horses outside of the grocery store.
I love Ellen and I record her show every day because it makes me happy!
The best is when SHE starts laughing.
I'm seriously still laughing at this time when Debra Messing was on about 5 years ago and a recorder-playing man dressed in a soldier suit started cheerfully walking by.
---3.5 starsHad read one of Ellen's books years ago and thought it was just 'okay.' It wasn't that I didn't like it, it just seemed her great personality and humor didn't translate as well to paper (I think I am in the minority there).
People have become so accustomed to texting that they’re actually startled when the phone rings.
You can’t just pick up the phone and try to talk to me like that.
Seriously? This was nothing but Ellen's very random thoughts similar to her stand up routines in the old days, interspersed with many MANY reminders to watch her talk show. I found the audio version, narrated by Ellen herself, funny for about 5 minutes and then it was just silly. If you like silly, you'll love this!! If not, do something else for 3 hours, like watch Ellen reruns.
I listened to the audio version of this book and it's a lot like watching Ellen talk on her television show - lots of casual, humorous observations about everyday life.
LOL); and much more.My favorite chapter is Ellen's satirical, funny letter to the security department of a mall where - it's been suggested - she broke a vase in a Pottery Barn store.
And that's not even the half of it.This is a light, fun book, and the audio version is perfect for doing chores or listening to in the car.You can follow my reviews at http://reviewsbybarbsaffer.blogspot.com/
*Listening to the Audio-book.
Having read her previous works I was very excited to learn about what had been going on in her life since beginning her show.
I was very curious to learn the “behind-the-scenes” details of things like American Idol and other things that had been going on since 2003.
I was thrilled that American Idol was touched upon but quickly thrown away.
I would have loved to actually learn more about her thoughts on the growing and disturbing trend of teenage, bullying-related suicides, her work standing up to these issues, starting a record label, something real!Don’t get me wrong, I love Ellen, I’m just painfully disappointed.
I think Ellen Degeneres is so funny and when I found this in the audiobook section of the library I had to download to listen. She narrorates the book too so how awesome is that! In the beginning I was cracking up, but then it became more of just her talking about any and everything and so it lost some of it's funny. While I didn't love it, I didn't hate it either. I still think she's very funny and would give her other books a try if I find them in the library too.
Let's just say, I prefer Ellen Show to her book. Her shows are so much humorous, funny, and inspiring than this book. So yeah, seriously, I'm not kidding about the 3/5 stars.
I'm not a regular viewer of her talkshow (I wouldn't even know if it is actually broadcast anywhere here in Germany, though I'd doubt that), but I enjoy her humor, respect her opinions and have in the past been entertained by a lot of short videos of her talkshow interviews and games which have been uploaded on YouTube.Hence, I decided to learn a little more about Ellen and listen to her memoir.
Ellen is a good entertainer, but this book really would have benefited from a clearer destination.
Read about a third and wasn't really enjoying it, although I do like her talk show quite a bit.You're not losing anything if you skip it.
