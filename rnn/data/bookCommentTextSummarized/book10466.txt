It was good. I don't reccomend taking such a break between the parts/books such as I did. It took a bit for me to remember who went where. It is similar to lord of the rings. So if you liked that, you will like this.
The last part of the book was the best. Splitting it up into three parts didn't do well for the story line so after finishing the final part I revised my review in the entirety of the Sword of Shannara to five stars. One of my new fantasy favorites. I can't wait to read more.
good
