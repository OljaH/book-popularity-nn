"While the light lasts I shall remember, and in the darkness I shall not forget." This short story was originally published in "Novel" (magazine, 1924). I've read it twice now and it still gave me chills. I think it's perfect as a short story, Dame Christie captures everything so perfectly, as well as including some dark and sinister ideas into the story. Well done once again :)
It was okay
"while the light lasts I shall remember, and in the darkness I shall not forget."
Hard to imagine, but these things happened in real life. War is hell.
While the light lasts I shall remember, and in the darkness I shall not forget
Good read, more like her Mary Westmacott work than a detective story
aku menyukai buku ini, kurasa tetapi beberapa cerpen tidak memuaskan ketika ending. terasa biasa saja padahal pada awal-awal paragraf terasa menarik. jadi, lumayan sajalah

Beautiful change of writing of Agatha, tragic perhaps, yet good development of events.
An okay story, though not the most interesting of this author.
Set in Rhodesia, I found this short by Agatha Christie to be very dark. It left a depressing mood after reading.
