For example, Dad was big into outdoor sports, so Larson hit the target once more with his numerous strips centered upon the man vs.
I think Larson could see the writing on the wall, and although I was sad when he retired and felt his quitting was premature, looking back on it now, I'd say the man went out on top.
500+ wacky, cracked, endearing cartoons and I laughed at every one of them. I cannot get enough of Gary Larson’s genius.
Introduction:  Now, I have heard many good things about Gary Larson’s famous “The Far Side Gallery” series, but I never had the chance to read them, until now! Surprisingly starting with the third volume of the “Far Side Gallery” series, “The Far Side Gallery 3,” I found myself rolling on the floor with laughter throughout the entire volume! What is this story about?  Basically, this volume contains many comic strips of Gary Larson’s famous series “The Far Side Gallery” and each comic strip has
Basically, this volume contains many comic strips of Gary Larson’s famous series “The Far Side Gallery” and each comic strip has a character or an animal doing something hilarious in their situations.
Probably the only thing problematic with this series is that there are a couple of comic strips in this collection that mentions “hell” a dozen times and that might be a bit upsetting for some readers.
Overall, “The Far Side Gallery 3” is a truly brilliant series for fans of Gary Larson’s “Far Side Gallery” series and you will surely start rolling around the floor with laughter at this collection!Review is also on: Rabbit Ears Book Blog
I remember loving these as a youngin. They still made me laugh. What an imagination.
I keep several Far Side books by my bedside, which I read just before going to sleep. I run through perhaps a dozen comics or so until one strikes my fancy and makes me giggle, smirk, guffaw, laugh, or chortle. It is replacement for sleeping meds. Gary Larson sees the world through the eyes of a mischievous child, an alien, an insect, a snake, an amoeba (so they don't have eyes, but if they did....) and just for one moment, you can understand how anthropocentric our perception of the world really is.
When you grow up life either makes you like Dilbert or you live in the far side. Very recommended
Because I am a compulsive reader, and because there was no ceral box to read, I read this while eating breakfasts or drinking tea while Amy and I were on our honeymoon.
If that sounds impossibly non-romantic, think again: homemade big breakfasts in an A-frame cabin in the middle of nowhere on Orcas Island.
Bald eagles scree-ing far above the mountaintop (it felt like a mountain!) and deer munching in the scrub around the cabin.
Meanwhile I, having found this book and wanting something to read while finishing my tea, paged through the big volume.
I love me some Far Side. The forward in this one is fun too since it's done by a scientist who shares why Larson is so beloved among the scientific community.
In thousands of years time, when anthropologists unearth copies of The Far Side, I hope they don't treat them as seriously as modern anthropologists treat the paintings inside the pyramids in Egypt.
I "read" one - at least - of GL's books. Maybe it was this one. My favorite is the "Bummer of a birthmark, Hal" one...
In San Francisco, we love this twisted humor so much that we held an annal fun run at the California Academy of Science in Golden Gate Park, where everyone dressed up as a Larson cartoon! This was 10 years after Larson stopped the strip... and it was annual ;o)
Gary Larson, brilliant as ever!

Some cartoons I hadn't seen before but most have been in other books.
Love the Far Side!!! That is all I have to say.
A well written book. Enjoyed reading it.
On my trek across The Far Side, I've come across talking cows, birds, various insects and arachnids, more cows, squids, amoeba, camels, sharks, rhino, various dinosaurs, scientists (I've noticed in real life scientists don't talk, they're very introverted and read a whole lot...), whales (often appearing white, with a man in a stove top hat and harpoon somewhere in the vicinity), more cows, snakes, and gators...
The next time I read the Narnia books, I'm going to picture it as The Far Side, and see if that changes anything.I LOVED this book.
I've read SOOOoooo many Far Side comics, but never these.
