Next year I could be in a children’s home (c)Q:My father has got the flu.
(Although my blue felt-tip is still at your disposal.) (c)Q:My father looked pale when he came home from the vet’s, he kept saying ‘It’s money down the drain’, and he said that from now on the dog can only be fed on leftovers from his plate.
(c)Q:My father was in bed when I got home; he was having his impotence cured.
My father has got no work or worries yet he looks dead haggard.
April 25I start reading a book called Diary of a Nobody.
I decide that I will write a book about myself that will be quite different, it will be full of important things I do and extremely interesting.
I will write about them when I have finished tidying.April 26I have received letters from two people I don't know, called MJ Nicholls and Knig-o-lass.
April 28I am trying to imagine what Miss Knig-o-lass looks like.
It's often hard to tell with girls.April 29Miss Knig-o-lass has also sent me a request!
I think he must be Miss Knig-o-lass's regular boyfriend.
It's been a long time since I've even picked up an Adrian Mole book or watched the TV show, and reading this one I was expecting lots of unnecessary teen drama.
Surprisingly Adrian is actually a very witty main character and this book is much more funny than griping, full of weird mishaps and Adrian's musings of his peers, daily life and quirky family.
Anybody who's ever been a teenager can probably relate to his concise observations, and the whole thing is a lot of fun to read through.
Best of all, Adrian isn't the only well-developed character in the story.
I'd read the book when it first came out but it was great to revisit both it and the memories that it stirred.
We almost had to stop reading at one point as each day's literary Mole catastrophe coincidentally seemed to then occur in my daughter's real life: her first spot, the disastrous school trip...!
I've read everyone of the Mole books - the Weapons of Mass Destruction will remain my favourite for obvious reasons!
Word of warning though: if you do get these on audio books, don't play them in the car while driving.
The Diary of Adrian Mole is like a snarky one-liner that continues for 135 pages.
Adrian is a self-centered, irreverent British 14-year-old whose diary entries include nuggets of wisdom such as:Pandora and I are in love!
She told Claire Neilson, who told Nigel, who told me.I told Nigel to tell Claire to tell Pandora that I return her love.
I can overlook the fact that Pandora smokes five Benson and Hedges a day and has her own lighter.
When you are in love such things cease to matter.It was entertaining, but never really got beyond the point of a quick, light read.I did learn that there was a short-lived BBC series based on the book.
Feel free to just read the objective one but if you want to see how bad the book was for me, personally, read to the end.Without further ado...The Objective Review:From an objective point of view, The Secret Diary of Adrian Mole Aged 13 ¾ wasn’t half bad.
I would have preferred the diary to be on a more interesting character and lifestyle but that is just my personal preference.This book is told from Adrian Mole’s point of view, in a series of diary entries.
*cough*Adrian Mole*cough*Approaching his caricature from an impersonal, critical, analytical view (like my English teacher said), I can see how this would appeal to teenage boys...back in the 80's.
Like many before him, pimply, priggish, pretentious 13-year-old Adrian Mole — well, 13 and three-fourths, to be precise — begins a diary on New Year’s Day. Well, he Leicester had me from the very start.
“Perhaps when I am famous and my diary is discovered, people will understand the torment of being a 13¾-year-old undiscovered intellectual.”His entries over two years detail his frustrations with his parents, his infatuation with the popular Pandora, his pompous posing as an intellectual “artiste,” his snobbery and self-dramatization, his dreadful poems, and the awkward obsessions with acne and being cool endemic to all teens in every age.
You've probably heard of "The Secret (although not anymore it would seem) Diary of Adrian Mole Aged 13 " but I'll review it anyway.The diary covers the period January 1981 through to beginning of April 1982. Therefore Adrian was not 13  throughout the story (false advertising?); instead he was merely 13  at the beginning and 15 at the end.It is now 30 years since the diary's release and apart from mentions to the price of things (£30,000 for a semi-detached house, if only) and the mention of cer
You've probably heard of "The Secret (although not anymore it would seem) Diary of Adrian Mole Aged 13 ¾" but I'll review it anyway.The diary covers the period January 1981 through to beginning of April 1982.
Big events of the time are covered like the Royal wedding between Prince Charles and Lady Diana.
Also the country is in a recession it seems which may have reflected the time period (I was born during the time period so can't remember it but have been told that it was a recession).Adrian Mole is funny because of his "woe is me" attitude to everything that happens to him.

Η Σου Τάουνσεντ δημιουργεί ένα από τους πιο ξεχωριστούς και ευφυείς ήρωες της Παγκόσμιας Λογοτεχνίας, τον φοβερό και τρομερό Έιντριαν Μόουλ, ο οποίος 'τσακίζει' με το φλεγματικό και ευρηματικό του χιούμορ.
Πέρα από αυτό, βέβαια, οφείλω να τονίσω ότι ποτέ η σεξουαλική και ερωτική αφύπνιση ενός εφήβου δεν είχε αποτυπωθεί στο γραπτό λόγο με τόσο αφοπλιστική ειλικρίνεια και ρεαλισμό.
Ένα μυθιστόρημα που τα 'τινάζει όλα στον αέρα' και μάς θυμίζει (σημαντική ατάκα του Έιντριαν Μόουλ) ότι δηλ.
Koji je ovo užitak bio čitajući u pubertetskom razdoblju. U mnogim stvarima sam se prepoznao što je u biti i najveća odlika ove knjige. Pokazati da nisi jedini koji prolazi kroz pubertetske patnje i druženje s ravnalom :)Najjača scena mi je bila nesreća s ljepljenjem makete :) :)
While it made me laugh out loud on occasion, this book was just not for me. I know Adrian is supposed to be clueless but he’s also obnoxious and most of the time I wanted to reach through the pages to choke him. His situation is not a good one, but I get the feeling he would be just as annoying even in the perfect home. I suppose the humor is just not my style.This unbiased review is based upon a complimentary copy provided by the publisher.
I read this today for school(yeay english lit class).I defently see why its so highly praised.A very,very,very funny book, that is hands down one of my new top humor books.And lucky for me there are lots of other books in the series out :)
I wanted to read something different from my usual reads so my friend Smitha recommended this book to me.
When she mentioned that this book is written like a diary, the usual picture of a bubbly girl writing a diary came to my mind but it was Adrian Mole and I haven't read my books with male diary writers so this was the main reason I picked this book.This is the diary of Adrian Mole who is 13 3/4 years old and is waiting for his birthday.
Really liked it and looking forward to read the following books in the series.Overall, 4.5 stars!
From BBC Radio 4 Extra:Adrian Mole starts the new year with a huge spot on his chin. Sue Townsend's famous tale of a teenager read by Nicholas Barnes.
After years of hardscrabble living, single parenting, poverty, and naff writers' groups, Townsend submitted a monologue to BBC radio about a boy called Nigel Mole.
Townsend became the best selling British author of the 80s, and a franchise was born.Why?One of the series’ charms is how, like Updike’s ‘Rabbit’ sequence, it captures history as people actually live through it: i.e. oddly.
Few books give you such a sense of total immediacy - the illusion of living in a different time, in real time.
Some readers assumed 'Sue Townsend' was a pseudonym: surely, no woman could have written about a teenage boy with such merciless accuracy.
Tako je spisateljica Rihmal Krompton, koja je pisala o legendarnom Vilijamu, nesvesno uticala na nastanak još jednog jednako upečatljivog književnog lika – Adrijana Mola.
Taunzendova je počela da tajno pise još sa 14 godina, ali je svoj prvi roman Tajni dnevnik Adrijana Mola izdala tek sa 36 godina.
Tajni dnevnik Adrijana Mola je to što mu i samo ime kaže –dnevnik.
Ovo je knjiga koja će nas podsetiti koliko smo bolno stidljivi bili, a koliko spremni da radikalno branimo svoje ideale, koliko smo nerazumno voleli i koliko nas nisu razumeli.
(Snort)If I was the loneliest person in the world I wouldn't phone up our school.
(Quite!)I am reading The Mill on the Floss, by a bloke called George Eliot.
(Yes, I made the same assumption first read)Epiphany is something to do with the three wise men.
(:P)Reading this again brought back some of my younger teenage memories...
Then there is punk, disco, cassettes, conkering, spots, the poor dogs, parenting, Good Samaritans, first crush and crappy school dinners.
It's an amusing trip down memory lane but I'm sure I found Adrian much funnier as a teen.
This book is very, very English; I think that I had just enough knowledge of the culture (after 24 years of being with a British man) to pretty much "get" it.
Great social document, with some enduring humour -- a lot of it in the gap between what Adrian thinks/understands and what the reader understands.
I don't know if I love it enough to follow the entire series, but I've had Adrian Mole: The Cappuccino Years on my TBR shelf for ages .
By the way, my edition has a great foreword from David Walliams -- definitely worth a read, if you are the sort of person to skip that kind of thing.
Absolutely formative for my being.
I've read it so many times (the edition whose cover is an homage to "Catcher in the Rye") my original copy is worn.
It's actually the 3rd copy as two I loaned out were never returned.
Luckily, I was able to get my own copy soon and absolutely fell in love with Adrian.
I had a chance to meet her when I was working at BPL but couldn't because of work.
I wanted desperately to meet her as I envisioned her as the mother of what I occasionaly felt as my literary husband, dork though he was.
Adrian, how is it that we've only just met?
You're hilarious.
I laughed so frequently that my husband took you from my possession as soon as I was finished and started reading as well.
I hope he agrees with me that it is dead brill.I am ever so pleased that there are a total of 8 Adrian Mole diaries to enjoy.
The title of the final book is ADRIAN MOLE: THE PROSTRATE YEARS.Thank you Jen!
This little copy traveled home with me from London and I can't think of a better souvenir.The author also has a non-fiction book called PUBLIC CONFESSIONS OF A MIDDLE AGED WOMAN AGED 55-3/4.
“Zase jednou jsem samá vyrážka. Taky jsem hrozně nadržený. Jsem si jistý, že jedno vášnivé pomilování by mi vylepšilo pleť. Pandora říká, že nehodlá riskovat, že se kvůli několika uhrům stane svobodnou matkou. Takže jsem zase odkázaný sám na sebe.” 😃 Být mladší, určitě to ocením ještě o něco víc. 🙂
"I am an intellectual, but at the same time I am not very clever."I remember reading this when I was younger and, although I immensely enjoyed it then, I love it more now than ever before.
Adrian really is quite relatable, with his tendency to jump to conclusions, overanalyse and make a catastrophe of everything, and I really can't help but laugh at at least half of the decisions he makes (sending his poetry to the BBC?!) I also love the shortness of each of the diary entries and how quickly you can devour it - I read this pretty much in one sitting!
Like other things for the 13’s like Haribo and cheesy films, they can be enjoyed by adults and children alike. On the surface, Adrian lives an entertaining life, caught up in the dramas of the day-to-day: school, family, girls and a horribly tight budget. We can relate to his experiences, both trials and triumphs, and easily engage with the titular calendar. Sue Townsend does a brilliant job of regressing to her teenage years to remember the intimacies of the most awkward age group.For the adult
Sue Townsend does a brilliant job of regressing to her teenage years to remember the intimacies of the most awkward age group.For the adult reader, though, Adrian Mole represents more than daft fun.
This takes the series from being disposable fun to a shrewd, carefully considered archive of public feeling.Townsend’s decision to present the story as a diary, as the title would suggest, gives us a unique insight into Adrian’s mind.
Written from Adrian’s viewpoint entirely, the self-absorbed teenaged attitude provides a refreshingly fun alternative to the adult narrator you’d expect with their levelled understanding, and is a perfect vehicle to the social commentary and exposure of prejudices.

When I first started reading this novel in diary entries after seeing the ecstatic squibs, I found myself thinking, "Well, not laugh out loud funny, but mildly amusing ...."The further I got into this compulsively readable book, though, the more I warmed to Adrian Mole, who confesses his hopes, lusts, disappointments, views of the world and much more from age 13 3/4 to nearly age 15.
I was around 13 years of age when I first read this novel, so I only had a couple of vague recollections about it. But I definitely remembered that I liked it, so I re-read it, and I still like it a lot, for many reasons.First of all, I like it because this novel is really laugh-out-loud funny. Adrian Mole, a moderately loser teenager – whose life is a never-ending fight against his pimples, his careless parents, the unmanageable family dog, the school bully, and, in general, the whole English r
The whole country is greatly anticipating the royal wedding, but Adrian’s father can only be bothered so far as to hang a Charles-and-Diana dish-towel on his front door – I guess this gesture speaks for itself and doesn’t need to be commented upon.By the way, re-reading this novel made me think (again) about the difference between proper teenage-novels and young adult novels.
This is mainly due to the fact that besides its depiction of England and English society which probably couldn’t have meant a lot to me when I was fourteen, it’s also full of nice, slightly idiotic and very funny literary references which I’m able to appreciate now.
I was particularly struck by the few negative reviews - I think to fully appreciate this book, there's a few things you need to bear in mind.First and foremost, Adrian is an unreliable narrator.
Again, if you're not au fait with these things, a lot will pass you by.So...that said...I love Adrian Mole.
I've read all the Mole books, and I've enjoyed them, although I'd say that the first two stand out as by far the best.
But Teenage Mole is just perfect, and will always retain a special place in my heart.

...................................Este delirant de amuzant!Sue Townsend intră-n pielea personajului foarte delicat și cinismul pe care-l plantează în vorbele lui Adrian are o naturalețe și o sinceritate debordante.
E clar că observațiile pe care le face Adrian nu pot fi decât ale unui om matur, însă le exprimă într-un fel în care doar un adolescent o poate face.Townsend face o critică socială cu o cruzime sarcastică demnă poate de Voltaire sau Erasmus, nimic nu-i scapă și nimic nu rămâne neatins.
Societatea engleză este luată la bani mărunți, dezbrăcată și pigulită de ultimul defect, exact ca și cum ai jumuli o găină.
Indiferent de e vorba de regină sau de Margaret Thatcher....................................
