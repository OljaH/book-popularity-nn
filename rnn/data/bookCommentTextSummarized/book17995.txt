Every once in a while a book comes a long that, from the moment I first hear about it, takes over my mind and heart and doesn't let go until I've read it, lived it and immersed myself in the story.
“Making Faces is the story of a small town where five young men go off to war, and only one comes back… It is the tale of one girl’s love for a broken boy, and a wounded warrior’s love for an unremarkable girl.
I fell in love with these lovingly broken and perfectly flawed characters, who each represented a unique piece of the same puzzle.
His love of life and ability to live freely in the moment overshadowed his physical shortcomings to the point where I was drawing strength from his character.
The love story of Fern and Ambrose was on another level than most.
I cried for Ambrose's quiet strength, humility, and decency—which was all I saw in both his beautiful and "beastly" state.
▪	 Plot: Centers on finding and loving the beauty within.▪ Writing: Unique, engaging, fluid, flawless.
Let me say that I have never read an Amy Harmon book that I didn't love.
Fern shies away from the spotlight, choosing to spend her time reading and hanging out with her cousin, Bailey, who suffers from Muscular Dystrophy.Despite their differences, Fern and Ambrose form a strong bond when Fern begins penning love letters to her long-time crush.
As determined as he is to fade into obscurity, she is persistent and gradually works her way back into his life.As Fern and Ambrose grow closer, the lives of their friends grow more complicated.
His light-hearted presence in Fern and Ambrose's lives is in direct contrast to the sadness he lives with.While this book was not particularly surprising, I absolutely loved it.
So in this book I loved many characters but my favorites were Fern, Bailey and Ambrose.
Only Bailey knows that she's trying to get a book deal, well until Ambrose finds out later on.
Fern has another best friend named Rita and at one point in their school days Rita wants to get together with Ambrose.
Well, we all know that backfires when Ambrose starts to care for Rita, writing back beautiful things and then finds out Rita and Fern were tricking him.
I don't think I want anyone holding onto me." Fern wondered if his response would be the same now as it had been then.Gradually, Fern and Bailey bring Ambrose out of hiding.
More than 5 Stars! Wow... just wow! This is one of those special books I wish I could give extra stars to- 5 stars, it just doesn’t seem adequate. When I read a story like this, it’s hard to put it into words how I feel. This book blew me away. One of the very best books I’ve read this year! Fern Taylor and Ambrose Young... Fern is that awkward girl. Red hair, freckles, glasses, braces. She loves to read, takes care of her best friend and cousin, Bailey, and remains closed off to most. Those who
She loves to read, takes care of her best friend and cousin, Bailey, and remains closed off to most.
Fern has been in love with Ambrose Young since they were children.
Fern decided it was possible because her heart was his, and whether or not he wanted it didn’t seem to make much difference.
Ambrose doesn’t know that Fern is replying to his letters.
When Ambrose finds out it’s Fern, his feelings are conflicted.
As much as I loved Fern and Ambrose, Bailey was the very best part of this story.
As Fern comes into her self, she wants to help Ambrose come back to himself.
4.5 StarsAmbrose …. But imagine him with longer hair! Nobody or Nowhere?Fern: I’d rather be nobody at home than somebody somewhere else. Ambrose: I’d rather be nowhere. Being nobody when you’re expected to be somebody gets old.Fern: How would you know? Have you ever been nobody?Ambrose: Everybody who is somebody becomes nobody the moment they fall.  BEFORE OR AFTER?

Nobody or Nowhere?Fern: I’d rather be nobody at home than somebody somewhere else.
Being nobody when you’re expected to be somebody gets old.Fern: How would you know?
Fern… Sweet, Sweet FernThe whole storyline was very moving, the characters were interesting.It follows the lives of the characters over a number of years.It has twists and turns which I did not see coming.
And maybe we just don’t recognize the blessings that come as a result of terrible things."
Fern loves her.
"I have no pride left, Ambrose!" Bailey said.“No pride.
"True beauty, the kind that doesn’t fade or wash off, takes time.
Take care of Bailey, read, write, and love Ambrose Young.
Making Faces is not about one love story.
As if narrating a tale to a child, she crafted the lives of Ambrose, Fern and Bailey.
But in his loneliness and devastation, Ambrose got closer to Fern and Bailey, two adorable dorks, the dying boy in the wheelchair and the girl who secretly loved him since they were kids and buried a spider in the yard.
Fern thought that she was too plain, too ugly for Ambrose to notice her.
Dear Lord.Reading Making Faces felt as if I was in a movie theatre, one that had a three sixty degree high definition screen, where each character was portrayed in bold and vivid colours.
I felt the pain, joy, sadness, victory, serenity; emotions that were pulled almost effortlessly.
It's difficult to write a review that could even remotely explain how this story decimated my heart.From Fern to Ambrose to Bailey, Rita, the Sheens, Paulie, Jesse, Bean, Grant, et al.
Each character was depicted with such depth, such heart, such love.
A love that also brought much pain and changed lives completely.
I ached for Fern yet I loved how fearless and selfless she was.
His ability to make me laugh and cry has not been out done by any other character yet.Ambrose has so much deep beauty that you can't help but love him.
After my husband gave me a funny look for laughing like a crazy person (Bailey had just announced, "You gonna tell me I can't have my seeing-eye cat with me?") I decided I'm going to read this book to him like I did On the Island and Easy.
This isn’t just a military book,this isn’t just a romance book,this isn’t just a new adult book, For me, this is “the book” of 2013!  ”Victory is in the battle.” Amy Harmon hit it out of the park with this story. The writing is PHENOMENAL the storyline UNIQUE and the characters UNFORGETTABLE!!This story is brilliantly told in a narrative format of Fern, Baily, Rita, Ambrose and the friends and families of Hannah Lakes, PA.The writing had me continuously highlighting quote after quote. The story
The writing is PHENOMENAL the storyline UNIQUE and the characters UNFORGETTABLE!!This story is brilliantly told in a narrative format of Fern, Baily, Rita, Ambrose and the friends and families of Hannah Lakes, PA.The writing had me continuously highlighting quote after quote.
The story brought smiles and tears and I dare a reader not to FEEL when they read this story.
I just loved the depth of the author’s writing, the feelings, the friendships.
It was absolutely beautiful!
"But maybe you see me because your beautiful, not because I am."
This story is so much more than it's description and the characters are the type that stay will you forever.
At least on the outside that's how it seems, until one day an event that changed the world forced him to look at his own life differently.
Broken and filled with guilt he lives inside of himself, until a girl he never paid much attention to forces him out of the shell he's built around himself.Fern, an extraordinary soul that came in an ordinary package.
Fern has "ugly girl syndrome", she doesn't see the beauty she has, both inside and outside.
This isn't one of those books where death or disease is used as trigger for the reader, the author doesn't force you to feel a certain way.
He’s not ready for college and since he always dreamed of being a different kind of hero, dreamed of being a soldier, he enlists in the army, persuading his four closest friends to come along with him.Three years later, Fern still lives in the small town.
She's a heroine you will want to be friend with, a heroine that will make you feel and think about life, family and friendship and maybe a heroine you will connect with.
He was sweet and so protective with Fern and such a great friend for both his cousin and Ambrose.
***2.8 stars***- WARNING, VERY UNPOPULAR OPINION -I'll try to make it short.This book didn't work for me for few reasons, and to be honest, I think I'm being too generous giving 2.8, but I loved Bailey that much. Fern: There was no debt to her character and no growth. From the flashbacks from her childhood to present day, she stayed the same mellow character throughout the whole book. At first, I though she was cute and sweet, but after couple of hundred pages of reading the same thing over and
***2.8 stars***- WARNING, VERY UNPOPULAR OPINION -I'll try to make it short.This book didn't work for me for few reasons, and to be honest, I think I'm being too generous giving 2.8, but I loved Bailey that much.
How ugly could she have been if she managed to grow into a beautiful 'swan', a hot chick that everyone oohed and aahed when they saw her?Then, she was giving Ambrose pep-talks about knowing how he felt, being insecure about his looks, because she went through the same thing.
And it was fine, when she was younger, but when she got older, that little girl crush just felt weird.Throughout the book it was said, numerous times, that Ambrose never thought that Fern was ugly.
(More than) 5 Stars!!!Talk about an amazing book at its most extreme! This book is a rare gem. You know it's crafted to tear your heart into a million pieces but you still read it anyways 'coz it's beautifully written and heartfelt!  "Maybe everyone represents a piece of the puzzle. We all fit together to create this experience we call life. None of us can see the part we play or the way we see are just the tip of the iceberg. And maybe we just don't recognize the blessings that come as a result
It also gave us the glimpse about the experiences military men face outside the country and what it would be like to work in those areas away from home and from loved ones.I cried a lot of times all throughout the book because of the deep and meaningful messages it instilled and how it portrayed the importance of being close to God as much as being close to your family and friends.
I also learned from this book that inner beauty is more important than physical beauty and what matters most is the good things you impact to someone's life.
but where the surprise came from was not the fondness i felt for the romantic and healing love between two people who desperately needed it, but seeing the importance of a strong and resilient love between friends and family.
that, to me, was the greatest gift of this book.even though i appreciated the message ambrose and ferns romance represented - the importance of finding beauty in all things, even the ugly - what really moved me was the unwavering bond shared between a group of boys and also the ties between two cousins that transcended familial affection.
i love how this story showed that, and how that love for friends and family also has the power to get you through the devastating loss of those people.
5 BEAUTIFUL STARS "And so we endure. We have faith that there is purpose. We have hope for things that we can't see. We believe that there are lessons in loss, power in love ...     "... and that we have within us the potential for a beauty so magnificent that our bodies can't contain it." Well readers I could not resist going straight into this book, everywhere I turned this book was all over my Goodreads feed. So like the dutiful addict I am and with several recommendations thrown my way I pic
There's a lesson to be learned from this book, go be taught.What did I love?The book is not over dramatic in its presentation it tugs at the heart strings in all the right ways, I applaud the author for tackling such sensitive and tragic subjects in a way which was realistic and heart felt, I never felt emotionally black mailed by this story but I was gripped by every page and turn of events.
The friendships in this book were the glue to this story for me, this author obviously has hands on experience of what it is like to have honest to goodness love in your life.
Making Faces is the first book I have read by Amy Harmon. Even though I knew what it was going to be about, I wasn’t prepared for the beauty of the words. I wasn’t prepared for the impact the words would have on me. And I wasn’t prepared for the raw emotions this book would make me feel.   Fern Taylor is a red headed waif like girl that maybe took a little longer than some to blossom. She had curly crazy red hair, was small and wore braces until her senior year in high school. Her father is a pa
Fern Taylor is a red headed waif like girl that maybe took a little longer than some to blossom.
Where Fern was tiny, Ambrose was big.
His face was beautiful, and Fern loved him.
Except the Ambrose that came home was not the same man that left.
Ambrose did notice Fern back in high school and she stayed on his mind all the years after he left.
This was such a beautiful and heart breaking book.
It was a story of three people, Fern, Ambrose and Bailey.
But he had a poetic heart, a love of Shakespeare, of beautiful words.
➦This is definitely a book that makes you feel and think about things like your own mortality, standards of beauty and dealing with the loss of loved ones.
It's not just a love a story, it's a story that will have you experience emotions while you go through the journey with the characters.
That, however, does not stop her from loving Ambrose, a beautiful boy and a wrestler at her high school.
And here begins the journey of Fern and Ambrose, where they help each other heal and fall in love.
I loved the characters, the beautiful words and the strong messages they delivered.
5 COMPLETELY AMAZING STARS!!! (And only because I can’t give more than 5.) In a town when everyone knows each other and things don’t remain hidden for very long, Fern is love with Ambrose since she was a little kid and he helped her with a spider’s funeral. But Fern never thought that she could be pretty enough for him and so she kept her feelings secret.But then the September 11th came and it changed a small town’s life. Ambrose got to war and when he came back, he was different… he was seen to
Ambrose got to war and when he came back, he was different… he was seen too much dark.
Don’t let the simplicity of the plot fool you… this story is utterly amazing and so perfectly written that you’ll never want to leave their world… and that will make you hope for Fern and Ambrose’s love so much as if it was your own.
If there are books with such a beautiful story, such amazing characters and that will stay in your heart for a long…LONG time, this is definitely that book.

This.Book.Is.Awesome.But, this book (I feel) is misclassified as a romance.
Yes, there is a romance in the book.
But this book is so much more.
She is a story teller, my favorite kind of author.I recommend this book to anyone who likes fantastic books.
If you don't like fantastic books then maybe this isn't for you.
The love expressed in this book has left me breathless.
Read NOW !!!FERN "Do you think there's any way someone like Ambrose could fall in love with someone like me?"
Fern loved Ambrose since she was ten years old.I loved Ambrose and Bailey both!
Bailey Its hard to come to terms with the fact that you aren't ever going to be ......This book was so moving and inspirational.
I didn't just love you because you were beautiful!"
5 Overcoming Stars!”Victory is in the battle”  Wow this book… What can I say other than it just moved me in ways that I didn’t expect… I laughed, I cried, my heart broke for the characters.
I as well as most every other girl has felt a case of UGS growing up.
I knew a boy who suffered from MD.
I was 18 and just starting college when the September 11, 2001 attack happened.
I know how that day affected me.
I know people who joined the military and went off to war as a result of the attacks and I
Wow this book… What can I say other than it just moved me in ways that I didn’t expect… I laughed, I cried, my heart broke for the characters.
It's like I just felt everything that happened in this book......This is one of those books that it breaks your heart but is so worth reading!
Fern suffers from Ugly Girl Syndrome (UGS) but has a heart made of gold.
Can we become one with Rocky Road instead?”	“It does look a little like shit.
Fern along with Bailey, help Ambrose accept who he is and remember who he was.
4.5 StarsOverview:  “It’s hard to come to terms with the fact that you aren’t ever going to be loved the way you want to be loved.”  I knew I would love this book. I don’t know why. This book is so far out of my usual comfort-zone it’s ridiculous. I never read NA. Usually my cynical brain gets bored half-way through a romance. But somehow I gravitated towards this title, and wished for it on Netgalley late one night. So imagine my surprise when my wish was granted—four years after the publicatio
“It’s hard to come to terms with the fact that you aren’t ever going to be loved the way you want to be loved.” 
(I didn’t even read all the blurb, tbh) Because of that, I really never knew where the plot was going.
Even the side characters are interesting and feel genuine.
It’s overall just a really good mentality and not one I ever see.I knew this was going to be sad.
But then it all plays out in a completely different and devastating way.Cons:My heart says five stars, but my brain had a few little issues.
The type that drips into your heart slowly, and takes it over.
Rich with emotion and character driven stories and their lives that'll teach you something.
I felt like I was living in an alternative universe whilst reading this.
The best part about this book is how it challenges the notion of beauty and what matters.
What is beauty anyway and why when the word is mentioned it is reduced to it just meaning the outer body?There's a feeling in my heart now that I can't make sense off, but this book will be staying with me for a while.
This was a really good story! I felt connected in the beginning when they are sitting in the classroom on 9/11 and watching the planes hit the buildings on the TV because that is where I was. The romance was sweet, and the book was sad and cute at the same time. I loved Bailey! Full review on my blog https://literarydust.wordpress.com/20...
This book was painful, beautiful, sad and heartwarming all at once.   Ambrose Young is beautiful. Hercules beautiful. With his dark hair that touches his shoulders, muscular body and eyes that burn right through you. Fern taylor is quite the opposite. With her pail and small body, short, red and curly hair she looks more like Annie than a high school student. Because they were so different, Fern loved Ambrose from afar, thinking someone like him could never love someone like her... until he wasn
Ambrose said alone, and Fern responded, “I would much rather be lost with you than alone without you, so I choose lost with a caveat.” Ambrose responded, “No caveats,” to which Fern replied, “Then lost, because alone feels permanent, and lost can be found.”  I've only ever read one other book by Amy Harmon, but what was clear then, and became even more clear now, is that she truly has a unique ability to create characters you just can help but love.Fern is not my typical heroin, but I loved her selflessness, her love for her friends and family, her quick mind and sense of humor.I loved Bailey.

Absolutely, but to me that played a secondary role.FernFern was always the ugly duckling growing up. She has red, curly hair, big teeth, scrawny and freckles.

5 Absolutely Beautiful Stars!This is one of the best books I have read in awhile.
Fern has been in love with Ambrose since she was 10 years old.
To Fern, Ambrose Young was absolutely beautiful, a Greek God among mortals, the stuff of fairy tales and movie screens.
Fern eventually grows into her looks and blossoms into a beautiful young woman.AmbroseAmbrose is gorgeous, athletic, popular and smart.
Fern's friend Rita wants to ask him out by writing him a love note.

5 Stars and Beyond * * * * * .......Thank you to all of the previous reviewers and a special shout out to Mo for personally recommending this book to me.
all of these elements and so much more made for a perfect storm of emotions.I really feel this is a book which has the ability to cause a person to think about what is important - what really counts in life and how we regard one another.
If you wish more, my updates express my feelings while reading this amazing book.
here's to feeling without reserve.For more Reviews, Free E-books and Giveaways
Un libro maravilloso sobre la superación y aceptación de lo diferente basado en el cuento de La Bella y la bestia, con el que reí, lloré y me indigné mucho por lo injusta que es la vida con los que menos se lo merecen.
No le doy más estrellas porque no se puede.Es el segundo libro de Amy Harmon que leo, tras The Law of Moses, y puedo decir ya que es una de mis escritoras de romántica favoritas por lo inusual de los temas que trata y cómo los trata.
I had like three pages left and I just had to know what happened so as soon at I hit the red light near the EarthFare I knew it was my chance to read the last three pages...
Ambrose and Fern's relationship is the definition of hope.
I liked that Fern shows him that there is more to life and a person than what meets the eye.
The characters in Making Faces are flawless.The plot of this book is so different.
Making Faces will probably be one of my top reads this year.
