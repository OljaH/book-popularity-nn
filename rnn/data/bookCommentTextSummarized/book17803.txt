all the emotions
“Pain is an interesting thing. You think you have reached your limit and you can’t possibly feel more tortured. Then you discover there is still another level of agony. And another level after that.”  Dear Mr.Riordan, The Burning Maze wasn’t what I expected at all. You dared to DO THAT in this book, and yes, I’m here weeping for what you’ve done. The book is like the mixture of The Battle of the Labyrinth and The House of Hades which turns up to be my favorite of the year since I was halfway th
The book is like the mixture of The Battle of the Labyrinth and The House of Hades which turns up to be my favorite of the year since I was halfway through it.
To be honest, Lester isn't always my favorite character when I started reading the first book.
Yet they're the reasons why I'm in love with this book so much that I can't get my mind back to normal even though I finished it like two weeks ago.The book starts off with the gang exploring the maze while they're being chased by the avian creatures (i forget what they're called.
I think I'm ready to talk about this.The Burning Maze is the third book in The Trials of Apollo series, and Rick Riordan's nineteenth demigod book.
I love all of Rick's books, sure, but there's something about The Trials of Apollo that just 
At the beginning of the first book, Zeus casts Apollo out of Olympus as punishment for his failures, and traps him in the body of a 16 year old boy named Lester Papadopoulos.
Quite the fitting villain, and a terrifying foil for our characters.The story constantly kept me on my toes, and this was definitely a lot darker than the previous two books in the series.
(view spoiler)[I was so excited for Piper and Jason, because I've really come to love them, even though when I first read The Lost Hero, I was not a fan of any of them.
Especially since reading The House of Hades, I've really come to realize how much I love everything about Piper and Jason - I'm not a huge Jasiper fan, but I know now I love them in The Lost Hero, and all the books in between.
In all Rick Riordan's books, this is the most final and brutal death, because it's so goddamn real.
so if I slap the book hard enough it’ll disappear right? Alexa how do you unread a book
Unbelievable!....Legendary!......I,Daughter of Apollo,from Camp Half-Blood,announce this bookAs*dramatic pause*PERFECTION!!One word,says it all!In my point of view, one of the features of a perfect book is when you wish a thing to take place (which made you squeal fangirling, not prediction), it actually happens.
don't worry) (hide spoiler)]✦ (view spoiler)[...'Remember what it’s like to be human'...
(hide spoiler)]I love we have a series about Apollo!THANK YOU!first read: [Dec 1-Dec 4]Really glad to read this Bless in my birthmonth, December!& I had a record!
awesome!here is my wishes for later, I write them to if they happen, I would be happy & proud: (view spoiler)[I wish we have an epic fight between Apollo & python (probably we will).
The Burning Maze is one of Rick Riordan’s top five books of all time.
I honestly feel as if Grover is one of the most underappreciated characters in all of Rick Riordan’s series.
I’m just so excited for people to read it so I have people to scream with.Anyway, I’m babbling, let us jump into what I liked and didn’t like about The Burning Maze.L I K E S✗ RICK CHANGED IT UP IM THRIVINGIt’s not that Rick changed it up, it’s that he finally did things he was too afraid to do in previous books.
MILD SPOILER:WE ALL KNOW THAT YOU DONT KILL ONE OF THE ORIGINAL SEVEN DEMIGODS. YOU JUST DON'T!!!!!!!!
But I caught up pretty quick that we're looking for oracles (dunno why) so Apollo can get to be a god again (again, not sure why he isn't a god now) and he's enslaved to Meg (which I still feel dubious about because if the genders were swapped on that, it'd be very inappropriate?
Feed my poor children pls.We also get the return of Piper and Jason!
He's a big starring character.And oh yeah that little part where...IT RIPPED OUT MY HEART.
It made Jason's death feel brushed off almost?
I shouldn't even be this upset because I didn't even LIKE Jason!?
SO HOPING THEY'LL BRING HIM BACK LIKE THEY DID LEO.
This book has everything a Rick Riordan book needs to have with it making me laugh, cry and feel pretty much every feeling in between.
i loved that Meg and Apollo have very difficult self journeys in this book.
And we get to see Grover again which was a plus i love his character.
But i do have a question for Mr Ridordan Why is the third book in a serie always so sad?!
but saying that i still can't wait to read the next book and hate the fact that I have to wait a year for it to come out..
"I would be Apollo.I would remember"i just need to sit and cry for the rest of my life...buddy reading with the #ReadRiordanBookClub and Iliana***As if it wasn't too hard already, i decided i'd read this book twice this yearI like suffer maybe way too much

Now, it's time for the actual review because I have some thoughts.Magnus Chase is still my favourite Rick Riordan's series, but this is a close second — I love the bad haikus.
➽I love how Apollo being the god of healing and Demeter, Meg's mother, being the goddess of growing is exactly what both of them need➽This book had a much darker feel to it than any of Riordan's booksUsually I'm the first one to shout 'why do creators always insist on making all the bright and easy things darker and darker' but it fits here?
😭💔
OMG! OMG! I got The Dark Prophecy today! I saw the title of this book at the back. The I looked at the release date. *dies* HOW THE HADES AM I SUPPOSED TO WAIT AN ENTIRE YEAR FOR THIS???????? At least I have Magnus Chase and the Ship of the Dead to look forward to... even if it is six months away. *dies again*
"Whatever happens, when you get back to Olympus, when you're a god again, remember. Remember what it's like to be human."  I will never forgive Uncle Rick for this.I just...cannot believe. I don’t want to believe.everything hurts.*cries forever*
The Burning Maze is, by far, the best in this series, The Trials of Apollo.
I don't know about you but I really did admire Apollo on this book.
And I just love how it was portrayed and delivered in the novel.The Burning Maze is also the book, among the other Riordan's books that I felt the realness of the characters and the events.
(I mean I felt it too in his other books but this is the pinacle of realness, imo).
It still works for me.The Burning Maze is hell of a ride.
Just as the other books in this series the words to describe it; Humor, twist and quality quality quality!Sad its a whole year to the next one but hey, I can always read the imprint books.
The cover is here and IT’S BEAUTIFUL!!!!Is it May yet?????????
Please Apollo. Remember. Please.
The hardcover of this book just appeared on my doorstep today, a gift from the publicist for review.
I haven't read the prior two books in this Trials of Apollo series.
(I'll probably just skim them though.) In the same breath, he announced to me that he hasn't read them and probably won't because he isn't much into Riordan's books any more, so I think we've maxed out on the help my teenager will be providing me here.
Was Jason my favorite character?
No. No he wasn't.
YOU BET YOUR ASS I DIDRick has never shied away from killing off characters (IM STILL NOT OVER BECKENDORF AND SELENA) but this time he went after ONE OF THE SEVEN!
My baby boy Percy better be safe and get to go to college and have cute dates with his gf and get a cute apartment in New Rome and be a cool teacher/councilor omg "Hey Mr. Jackson?
What was it like to go on a billion quests??" PERCY WOULD BE LIKE "DONT EVEN THINK ABOUT IT TIMMY"
The third instalment in The Trials of Apollo series by Rick Riordan sees our heroes face the final Roman emperor in the Triumvirate, as well as meeting a large number of dryads in a very hot and desert like California.
As usual, there’s a big dollop of humour, mythology and action here - but I also found this a bit darker than the previous instalments.
There’s an overall feeling of anticipation and dread that runs throughout, which I actually found more exciting.
I also liked seeing the development in Apollo, embracing his human nature more (whether he wants to or not) and accepting responsibility for his actions.
”Remember what it’s like to be human.” 4.5 stars TW: violence, death The Writing It’s the classic Apollo-style writing that we had in the previous two Apollo books that I absolutely loved mixed with just classic Riordan writing that we get in all of his books and I also love. It’s funny, it’s got character, it’s easy to fly through. I appreciate it. There’s really not much else to be said about it. The Plot/Pacing It’s so fastpaced! Something is constantly happening and you can’t lose focus for
There are so many new mythical creatures introduced in this book and the new emperor and ieterh it was just all really exciting in fastpaced and the Rick Riordan did that One Thing(TM) and broke all of our hearts.
But, yes, plot was A+
There is literally not a single thing I’d change about it except for maybe One Thing(tm), though I was pleasantly surprised by the fact that Rick would do something like One Thing(tm) and I think it’s good that he’s making those decisions.
well fuck uncle rick can still make me cry
Uncle Rick...
Too many emotions.I have grown to care about Piper and Jason as side characters in this one book, 10 times more than I did in the five Heroes of Olympus books.I also FINALLY care Meg and Apollo and the relationship they have.
I even love them.Don't get me started on how wonderful it was to go on an adventure with Grover again.It feels like the brilliant Rick Riordan has once again stepped up, which I didn't know was possible.We got more darkness, more stakes, more heart.
I was shocked at how brave some of Uncle Rick's decisions were but they work.
WHY CANT YOU WRITE FASTER!!Update: THE COVER!
It’s so amazing!Another update: Here’s a sneak peek!!!
http://ew.com/books/2018/01/17/rick-r...Okay, now for the actual review!
This book was awesome!
The third book is always a turning point in Rick Riordan's five part series.
This book was no different.
Plus we see an appearance from Piper and Jason.
Rick Riordan did take some risks with those characters and I feel like those things were necessary, although they did hurt my heart.
There was so much character development in this novel.
Grover showed soooooo much bravery and Piper realized something important in her relationship with Jason.
Apollo is definitely my favorite god [in the general Riordanverse], Meg is great, and it's nice to see some cameos from familiar characters throughout [although I still cannot believe that (view spoiler)[Rick just killed off Jason like that???
It feels wrong for him to die outside of his own series lol Like if Batman just died in some random Aquaman issue and never came back, because I'm pretty sure he won't be bringing him back to life but I guess we'll see (hide spoiler)]].
Middle Book Syndrome comes for us all but it was still a really fun time overall.
Let one year of agonizing wait begin. :')
Something happened and I definitely didn’t expect it
wow I’m dead that was definitely the darkest book yetidk how I’m gonna survive until the next one I need it now4.5/5 🌟
