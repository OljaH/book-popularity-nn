Among mystery writers, Rex Stout stands out for four things: 1) devising the second most memorable eccentric detective genius, 2) creating--in Archie Goodwin--the breeziest, most deceptively effortless first-person narrative voice in detective fiction, 3) fathering the single greatest crime-solving pair ( although Holmes wins out slightly over Wolfe, Goodwin beats Watson hands down), and 4) being the absolute master of the 25,000 word detective novella.These three novellas are among Stouts finest.
The first involves a prospective client strangled with Wolfe's necktie, the second features two identical guns and a mysterious strongbox, and the third introduces us to Hattie Annis, a crusty, cop-hating landlady who is one of the most vivid of Stout's incidental creations.
If possible, read each in one sitting.
Enjoy.
The anthology consists of three novellas:Eeny Meeny Murder Mo.There were several times before when a dead body was found in or around Wolfe's home: one time on the front steps, and another was right in his office.
Usually Wolfe is fairly impersonal in his investigations, but in this case he gloated at the murderer when he finally nailed him/her.
As I mentioned usually Wolfe's clients are very rich and most of the time not very nice people.
This time he finally had a client I was able to sympathize with.
The mysteries aren't terribly complex (these are short stories, after all), but Wolfe gets there ahead of the police every time.In 'Eeny Meeny Murder Mo', a woman comes to Archie for help.
Their client, one Hattie Annis, who found the money in her home and trusted Archie with it, doesn't like cops, and refuses to allow the detectives to turn it over to the authorities.
In 'Assault on a Brownstone', the eccentric Hattie Annis is the murder victim, and Archie meets and cooperates with T-woman (that is, Treasury agent) Tammy Baxter to catch the killer.
I definitely liked these the best. Short stories fit Nero Wolfe very well. All 3 cases were well done, interesting, & full of the quirkiness I expect of the series.
But her husband was already dead, shot with an identical gun.”Counterfeit for Murder: “When a cop-hating landlady gives Nero Wolfe $40,000 to make the police eat dirt, and an actor at liberty takes the liberty of killing, Archie takes matters into his own hands.”Now, I’ve cheated and given the above summaries just as they appeared on the back of the paperback I’ve read.
These are the first short stories that I’ve read by Stout, and they’re not bad, but, obviously, Nero Wolfe is constrained to quick cerebral solutions of crimes without using a lot of his usual tricks.
I liked the last story the best! Hattie was a hoot.
These are the improved versions, some of which I've seen in the A and E series of Nero Wolfe Mysteries, which taught me the Yiddish word "Schlampig" which means slovenly (or, if applied to a woman in a certain context, slutty).
He's a much kindlier genius than usual, even though two of his clients and one of his victims is a woman.
Having been disappointed with my last Wolfe choice, I was relieved that this was much better.
Michael Pritchard is not my favourite reader, but since he's my only choice for the Wolfe books, I'll make do.
Getting used to every little detail...
By the time you finish your first Nero Wolfe mystery, you know Archie, Nero, Inspector Cramer, Fritz, and the principal clients as well as you know your own friends.Homicide Trinity provides three short Wolfe mysteries.
I like compilations of shorts by my favourite mystery authors; unfortunately, they're harder to find than they used to be.
They provide a quick immersion into a well-loved mystery series, reading them one at a time when you have only a few minutes to read -- or so that's the theory.
Whether you like mysteries or want to study how tight writing can succeed, check this one out from your library or buy it from your favourite bookstore.
It's discoveries like the fact that this wasn't already on my shelves that makes me think that, particularly with long series, that sometimes when Goodreads corrects its records it ends up removing books from my shelves.
Fortunately I know I hadn't written a review before.Anyway, this is one of the best of those Nero Wolfe mystery books that contain three stories.
In part because it has "Counterfeit to Murder" the story Stout wrote twice because the first time he realized he had the wrong murder victim.
Hattie Annis, the client in this book, is one of the all time greats of Stout's characters.
This is absolutely my favorite of the three-story collections so far. Hattie Annis, the client in the third story, is absolutely my favorite character in the canon after Archie and Wolfe himself. If nothing else, read "Counterfeit for Murder."
3 more murders to solve Nero Wolfe and Archie Goodwin have their hands full x 3. Always sharp dialogue and interesting plots. Reading a Rex Stout mystery is like visiting an old friend.
Great little snippets of mysteries, perfect for when I just want to dip into Wolfe's world. Hattie Annis is a delight.
This is one of my favorite Nero Wolfe cooks. It contains three mysteries. Love that Archie Goodwin!
Another fun trip of Nero Wolfe mysteries.
Loved Hattie Annis!
Very good!!!!! I especially liked the story with Hattie- a fun new type of character! Especially because of several hilarious scenes with Cramer!
More great mysteries from Rex Stout.
I love Hattie Annis so much. I wish she was in more than just the one short story!
As is the case in the best Wolfe stories, Stout creates a memorable cast of suspects in the case of the murder of the blackmailing husband and Archie finds them all at the scene of the crime looking for the box of blackmail materials.The characters are solid, particularly for a novella, and Wolfe solves the case in true master detective fashion.Rating: Very Satisfactory"Counterfeit for Murder"A woman named Hattie Anniscomes to Wolfe's door looking quite disheveled and unlike the high value clients that Wolfe usually pays for and Archie's not inclined to let her in.
Now Wolfe will go to any length to get the villain who dared to strangle someone in his office with his tie!2) Death of a Demon - A wife dreams over and over a dream of shooting her husband.
She decides to bring the gun to Nero Wolfe and show it to him, thinking that if she tells him she and her subconscious both won't dare to go through with it.
But while Wolfe uses up the rest of the appointment time showing her the orchids, news comes that the husband has been found shot - dead for some hours.
Rex Stout rolls along with another collection of novellas featuring his stout detective.
In "Eeny Meeny Murder Mo" a suspect establishes an alibi by witnessing Bobby Fischer in a tournament at the Manhattan Chess Club; in "Death of a Demon", a radio news broadcast has Fidel Castro castigating the government of the U.S. and the father of a suspect committing suicide 'five years ago in 1955'; and, in "Counterfeit for Murder", the only signs of age are prices, with a top-notch contract investigator being hired for $10 per hour.Nero Wolfe series - three novellas: "Eeny Meeny Murder Mo", first published in Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine;"Death of a Demon", first published in The Saturday Evening Post; and,"Counterfeit For Murder", first published in The Saturday Evening Post as "Counterfeiter's Knife".
Eeny Meeny Murder MoA client is murdered in Wolfe's office, with his own necktie.
More than a little.Death of a Demon"That's the gun I'm not going to kill my husband with." Though at the end of the first paragraph, this pronouncement starts off this story with a bang.
Is she just in Nero Wolfe's office to establish an alibi?
Or was her blackmailing husband killed by someone else?Counterfeit for MoneyOne of the rare stories were Wolfe is stymied, by a woman no less.
She is the client in the case, a woman who comes to the house wondering which one of her boarders is creating counterfeit money.

"Homicide Trinity" is a collection of three historical mystery short stories: "Eeeny Meeny Murder Mo," "Death of a Demon," and "Counterfeit Murder." They're set in New York City in the 1960's.Since these were short stories, there wasn't much time for clue-gathering, but they could be solved by the clues.
Wolfe's genius was in setting up a test or asking a question that didn't seem directly related to whodunit but which revealed strong clues.
I didn't guess whodunit in the second one, but I got it right in the other two.
Overall, I'd recommend this book to mystery fans.
Eeny Meeny Murder Mo ***Death of a Demon ***Counterfeit for Murder ***My Rating System:* couldn't finish, ** wouldn't recommend, *** would recommend, **** would read again, ***** have read again.
I'd never read any of the Nero Wolfe mysteries before this book, but had enjoyed the A&E TV series based on them.
After reading this book (which includes three stories, each in the 50-60 page range) the biggest thing that comes across is how dead perfect the casting of the three major characters (Wolfe, Goodwin, Cramer) was in the TV show.
They just nailed it.As for the stories, while they will never be mistaken for classic literature they're fun (if formulaic) "hard-boiled" detective stories with distinctive characters and a good deal of humor.
I'm looking forward to reading more of Stout's Nero Wolfe stories.
This is a collection of 3 stories. Nero Wolfe is a reclusive genius private detective. His sidekick Archie Goodwin helps him solve murderous puzzles. Each of these stand alone stories is clever and entertaining. In the first story the secretary of an attorney comes to Wolfe with a tale of betrayal in the firm where she works. In the second story a blackmailing public relations man is found murdered. In the third story a disheveled woman shows up on Nero Wolfe's door with a package of counterfeit money.
When I discovered I enjoyed Nero Wolfe a few years back, I was delighted that I had such a huge number of books available ahead of me.
I probably should have anticipated that there would also be a hell of a lot of repetition.
This is especially acute in the books that slap together three or four short stories, where you can end up getting introduced to all of the secondary characters three times in an afternoon.
I also like the short format less for compressing the cases beyond the chance for much real detecting.
But, they are what they are, right?
Homicide Trinity is a collection of Nero Wolfe mystery novellas by Rex Stout."Eeny Meeny Murder Mo," first published in Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine #220 (March 1962)"Death of a Demon," first serialized in three issues of The Saturday Evening Post (June 10, 17 and 24, 1961)"Counterfeit for Murder," first serialized as "The Counterfeiter's Knife" in three issues of The Saturday Evening Post (January 14, 21 and 28, 1961)It's worth reading if only for "Counterfeit for Murder" and the wonderful character of Hattie Annis.
