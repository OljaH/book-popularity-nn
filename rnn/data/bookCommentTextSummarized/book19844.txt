I mean, If I Stay was all about people dying and lying in coma and there were hardly any tears in my eyes and here I spent hours sobbing over a guy's broken heart?
Am I that much into emo guys?
Adam Wilde is emo of a different, Tom Mackee (The Piper's Son) kind.
Throughout the book I felt that exactly like him, I was filled with pain and resentment towards Mia's decisions.
Beautifully, beautifully written.Ladies, have you hankies ready for this one, 'cause I am tearing up again just thinking about it.
I understand why so many people like this book, but it just wasn't for me. I will say that Gayle Forman is a fantastic writer and I will continue to pick up books by her.
I'm having a hard time trying to compile my thoughts on the novel because I'm still reeling from the deep, heartbreaking effect it had on me.Tatiana's review said what I've been thinking most of all:"I mean, If I Stay was all about people dying and lying in coma and there were hardly any tears in my eyes and here I spent hours sobbing over a guy's broken heart?"That about sums up the reaction I had.
In most situations, characters like Adam would be made to seem selfish for thinking of themselves when Mia had lost pretty much everything in that car crash.
Undeniably 5 Shooting Stars!!Adam’s Promise: If you stay, I’ll do whatever you want.
As a result Adam must face the pain of honoring a promise that was made to hold on to the one he loves.This story takes place three years after the crash and Mia’s physical recovery.
But most of all, his lyrics at the beginning of most chapters had me stopping to appreciate Forman's ability to express her characters in song.If the story ends here, I think it’s a two book series well concluded.
Right, so. I never rate a book unless I at least like it, and I almost never leave text reviews....but Where She Went is impossibly good. If I Stay was good, of course, but Where She Went? Good God. I can't remember the last time I fell so hard for a couple. My heart physically HURT throughout this book! Adam, oh Adam!! How you and Mia make me cry!
This added absolutely nothing to this series, other than reconfirming how much I dislike these books
“I needed to hate someone and you’re the one I love the most, so it fell on you.”    ❤ ❤ ❤ ❤ ❤ ❤ ❤ ❤ ❤ ❤ ❤ ❤ ❤ ❤ ❤ ❤ ❤     “You were so busy trying to be my savior that you left me all alone.”  This is the conclusion to Mia and Adam’s story, one that captivated me until the very last page.
The story follows our dear characters three years after Mia awoke from a heartbreaking coma.
In this continuation, we have the privilege to read from Adam’s point of view that is as endearing as Maia’s was.
This is the conclusion to Mia and Adam’s story, one that captivated me until the very last page.
It also contains the same calm and out of this world ambience and a lyrical pleasant writing that is simply impressive and…perfectly suiting the story.
Often goosebumps appeared though, making me remember that this is a poignant story and that those characters are wonderful and that Adam is one of the most…good hearted hero I have ever encountered in a book.
I didn’t mind it but I would have appreciated more dialogs since those are my favourite parts in a book.
I liked Adam so much, that I didn't even talk about him in my "If I Stay" review, because nothing would have really done justice to how perfect I thought he was.
I liked the way that the story came kind of full circle, and Adam did get his closure, even though it came through finding out things that certainly hurt.
I like themes of lasting love, and I think that many people will love this book for that reason, but I just didn't think that this one had the same heart that "If I Stay" had, and for that, I can only give it 2 stars.
But most importantly, we get to walk with Mia and Adam through the streets of New York and witness a love so beautiful and alive that it has once again touched me in a way that I will never ever forget.Gayle Foreman has done it all over again!
And all I want to do is hug him!Adam's story is filled with so much emotional and physical energy.
I smiled a goofy-ass-grin-to-grin smile all the way through.Adam and Mia will always be one of my all time greats!Hands down one of the best book that I've ever read.
Adam is a character who is almost wholly blind to his and other people’s motivations and reasoning.Gayle uses a variety of rich, descriptive language without seeming ingenuous to the voice of a twenty-one year old musician – at least to the layman.Still, despite all the praise, I struggled to connect to Adam and the narrative to the degree that I had in If I Stay.
This story is set in New York City, where by chance/fate/destiny...Adam and Mia are brought together again where they have a chance to open their hearts to the past and to their love.
You made me stay!""I needed someone to hate, and you're the one I love most, so it fell on you""And then Adam Wilde shows up at Carnegie Hall on the biggest night of my career, and it felt like more than a coincidence.
And for this one, they gave me you"Adam~Mia is walking away, walking toward the other end of the bridge.
4.5 stars "Needle and thread, flesh and boneSpit and sinew, heartbreak is homeYour suture lines sparkle like diamondsBright stars to light my confinement" Wow, I really liked the first book in the series but this one kinda blew me away. It was way better than the first. The emotions, the tears, the heartbreak.I swear I nearly went to Youtube, trying to find the bloody band so I could hear the songs. Had to use my imagination. This author could definitely become a songwriter. "The bow is so old,

"Needle and thread, flesh and boneSpit and sinew, heartbreak is homeYour suture lines sparkle like diamondsBright stars to light my confinement"
Wow, I really liked the first book in the series but this one kinda blew me away.
It was way better than the first.
The emotions, the tears, the heartbreak.I swear I nearly went to Youtube, trying to find the bloody band so I could hear the songs.
Had to use my imagination.
This author could definitely become a songwriter.
As with the other book, I avoided a lot of reviews.
Where She Went is an intense and breathtaking read.
But Where She Went is one the BEST books I have ever read.
I had to know whether Adam and Mia where going to be okay?
But I understood why Mia choose to make that decision to leave Adam thanks to Forman writing such well crafted and believable characters.The writing is the kind I love - simple yet beautiful and powerful.
I really love books that music plays an important part of and Forman really expresses both Adam's and Mia's passion for music.Overall, I am just blown away by the heart in this story.
Aún no decido porque este libro me gusta tanto. No se si será porque es desde el punto de vista de Adam, me encantan los libros narrados por los hombres, será porque deja al descubierto todo su sufrimiento cuando Mia le abandona. O mas bien porque es la perfecta historia de romance. Lo dejo como que es todo lo anterior. Es una historia desgarradora y hermosa.
This was less of a book and more of a roller coaster.
You know how you sometimes get off a roller coaster, and your legs feel like jelly and your middle feels like someone's wringing you dry?
I'm not going to give you plot synopses.
I'm not going to give you my favourite quotes.
I am, however, going to tell you a story.
I knew I would love Where She Went before I ever read it.
I read a review of the book about a month ago, and it inspired me to stop procrastinating and pull If I Stay out of the
I read a review of the book about a month ago, and it inspired me to stop procrastinating and pull If I Stay out of the TBR pile I had consigned it to.
If there's one primary emotion I felt towards Mia for most of this book, it was the same rage that Adam was consumed by.
Oh, I didn't need the big reveal at the end to know why she broke up with him, or even why she did it so cruelly, but I was still practically incoherent with rage on Adam's behalf.
I understood Mia, but I still bled for Adam.You know what's really weird about my experience with this book?
Adam's emotions were so strong that, even though I love Mia, when he got angry and upset at her I couldn't help but to get angry and upset with her too.
Like Adam, all I wanted to know was why she left and why she did this to him.
But I don't want to reveal too much, and I won't say whether or not Adam and Mia have a happy ending.
I will say though that I believe Gayle Forman gave us everything we wanted to know and more.
For writing this amazing book that a lot of us readers desperately needed.
Este libro me sorprendió desde la primera página, imaginaba que podían pasar muchas cosas después del accidente de Mia, pero no esperaba nada de lo que este libro me contó. Cuando por fin tuve todas las respuestas que necesitaba me sentí igual que Adam, lo entendí todo y comprendí muchas cosas sobre Mia. Reseña Completa: http://bastvilard.blogspot.com/2015/0...
**4.75 Adam makes this book Stars**Where She Went turned out to be a better book, for me, than the first book.
If I Stay is the first book in the series and I ended up giving it 3 stars.
Three years have passed since the accident and Mia and Adam are no longer together.
Adam happens to stumble upon one of Mia's concerts and from that concert they begin to work out what went wrong all those years ago.
On another note, I still haven't seen the movie- If I Stay but I plan to because I like movies that makes you cry.
I couldn't stop reading.
I never in my whole life imagined that THIS was what happened after Mia wakes up!
I mean, I knew there wouldn't be a "happily ever after" and that they (she and Adam) would have to face so much difficulties, BUT I NEVER EXPECTED that they would just break up!
It was so painful to read, Adam was suffering so, so much :(.I really liked the fact that they both achieved their "musical dreams".
I LOVED THIS BOOK and I'm so glad I read it!
Wow what a ride!!I loved this book so much!!!It was much better from the first!!I adored the first and I wanted to know if these characters will have the ending I wanted!!The emotions were so intense in this book!!I could feel Adam's pain and anger like I was in his shoes!!In this book like the previous,memories are include from back then,sad and happy moments.This book was so realistic!Ifelt like these characters excist in real life!!This book is about three years since the end of IF I STAY.
Every morning I wake up and tell my self: It’s just one day, one twenty-four hour period to get thorough. A day might be just twenty-four hours but sometimes getting through just one seems as impossible as scaling Everest. ***If you haven’t read If I Stay, there may be some spoilers***Where She Went is Adam’s story It’s been three years since Adam’s life was forever changed. Three years ago he almost lost Mia, the love of his life. Well, he did lose her, but not in the ultimate way. Three years
Every morning I wake up and tell my self: It’s just one day, one twenty-four hour period to get thorough.
***If you haven’t read If I Stay, there may be some spoilers***Where She Went is Adam’s story
It’s been three years since Adam’s life was forever changed.
Three years ago he almost lost Mia, the love of his life.
‘If you stay, I’ll do whatever you want.
Mia takes Adam to all her favorite New York spots.
Will Mia tell Adam why she left, will he get the closure he needs and deserves?
I wanted more of Adam’s story!
One fated night, Adam walks into Carnegie Hall when Mia is doing a concert, and it seems like destiny had brought them together again.
Told from Adam's perspective, this is a book about despair, heartbreak, music, sex, hate, anger, hope, and love.This book seemed like kind of a waste to me.
Okay, I haven't lost my parents and brother in a car crash, so I can't even begin to understand how that feels like.
I also didn't really like Adam in this.
I want to feel the softness of her flesh give, to hear her gasp as my hip bone jams into her.
After reading (and loving) If I Stay last year, I didn't really wanted to read this one.
I just felt that the end (of If I Stay) was really good, and adding anything to the story would just ruin it.
I ended up loving it more than the first one.
I just loved every single thing about this book!
Especially flashbacks with Mia's family, and the whole ending.
I did not expect it to end like it did, and that made me like it even more.In conclusion, amazing book, and I would recommend it to anyone who read, and liked, If I Stay.
I had not started it yet, but already I was upset with Mia. It’s been a little over a month since I read If I Stay, so I know what she went through.
I also know what she does to Adam.
And like Adam, I didn’t know why.
Like him, I wondered.
Then I felt a little more angry and heartbroken for him.
Only this time around, it’s a past with Mia, then losing her AND a present of her absence and that ever constant wondering of WHY?
I loved this book, I found it hard to put down! I enjoyed it better than the first. It was great hearing it from his perspective, I wasn't expecting that. would highly recommend
Rightly so, as Where She Went is told from Adam Wilde’s point of view, whereas If I Stay was primarily about Mia, his (view spoiler)[ex (hide spoiler)]girlfriend.
Cue the life and relationship analysis…Several reviewers have mentioned that this book wasn’t as enjoyable as it could’ve been because Adam seems overly angst-ridden for nearly the entire thing.
The whole thing just felt over-the-top, I agree, but I just loved the two of them together so I wanted to think their relationship could define Adam’s whole being, his anger, his disillusionment.
(view spoiler)[I don’t think I’m encouraged by Adam and Mia getting back together right away.
The thing about reaction to loss is that it isn’t static, the same person can catapult from one form of grief to another for no notable reason.
And when the chaos of grief and loss subsided Adam found himself alone, mourning the loss of yet another thing: his relationship with Mia. There is a lot of irrationality in this story, A LOT, but it is entirely relatable.
I will simply say that I related deeply to this book, to all the stages of grief and loss and numbness.
Translation widget on the blog!!!O continuare la înălțime a primei cărți din serie, deosebită prin faptul că este scrisă din punctul de vedere al lui Adam. Emoționantă, te face să trăiești suferința și durerea personajului.Recenzia mea completa o găsiți aici: https://justreadingmybooks.wordpress....
CLOSURE! GLORIOUS CLOSURE. I think I liked this better than If I stay for that reason alone. But I did love both of them a lot.
Loved this!
