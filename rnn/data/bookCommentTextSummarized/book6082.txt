I will cheat and skip the events in the beginning for two reasons: they are complicated enough not to fit in one paragraph and they only come into play much later in the book.
Obviously Mason forgot the simple truth that no god deed goes unpunished.
He put a classified ad saying that a fan-dancer who lost her property can recover it at Mason's office.
To his complete surprise the very next day several people - all saying they were sent by the dancer - came to Mason thinking he had...
Thus my usual rating for a book of the series is applied.
THE CASE OF THE FAN-DANCERS HORSE.
After they sent for help, Perry checked out the trunk and found a set of ostrich fans used by strippers in their acts.
You don’t find fan-dancers around any more, it was soon replaced by what we now call burlesque.
After Perry put an ad in the paper that he had found something in the car and would return it if the owner could identify it, he soon met a woman who said that she was the owner.
You don’t hear it much these days, but the expression, “Got to see a man about a horse,” was once very popular.
A series of unlikely stories and coincidences involving a car accident, ostrich fans, a missing horse, lookalikes and murder result in a mystery that appears to have been inspired by a Shakespearean comedy. And all is well that ends well with Perry Mason's client absolved of murder.
This case wasn't as vague as some of the others. The end pretty made sense and was obvious too. Two fan dancers really confused the issue, add two boy friends and things did cause a tiny headache! But all in all, not bad.
Perry puts an anonymous, cryptic ad in the paper to try returning a pair of ostrich plume fans.
The ad obviously doesn't remain anonymous because people start beating on his door; but it must have been sufficiently cryptic, because it turns out they are all looking for a missing horse.
A fun read with Perry's usual courtroom feats and an ending that surprised me (although it probably shouldn't have).Perry Mason series - It all begins with the fan-dancer's "costume".
When Perry Mason stumbles upon the barely there accessories, he sets out to do a good turn by returning them.
As is becoming a pattern, a great build-up and enough information to figure out who dunnit. Then, in the last 3 pages, a new fact that we had no way of knowing and the killer is identified. Maybe it's just me, but a great mystery is one where all,of the clues are there, but their exposition makes the solution complicated but when it is explained you can say "I should have thought of that." I'm hoping as I work my way through the series in order that they'll get better, but this is almost thirtieth in the series.
I really liked this one.
Some people compare Gardner to writers like Agatha Christie, but personally I don't see it. If they weren't mysteries, they might as well be a whole other type of novel. They are both excellent writers, just very different. Gardner does with the court room what Christie does with writing a complex, mind-blowing mystery. If you are interested in the whole court room scene, especially with a brilliant lawyer involved, then the Perry Mason series is a great choice.
Has courtroom drama but still a simple one.
Why I Read This Book: I was looking at my shelves (to see if I own a dead-tree copy of American Gods--the upcoming SFDG book for June) and was struck by the coincidence; "Fan-Dancer's Horse" is the next episode for me to watch from Netflix.It's (mostly) well-written, though there are some clumsy bits early on, where Mason seemingly acts out of character.
In these degenerate times, I had to look up certain terms--"fan dancer" and "nautch dancer"--and was surprised to find out there were so many different kinds of burlesque.I think this was a re-read; while there were a lot of things I didn't remember, I did remember the critical clue well enough to spoil the story.
A fan-dancer's fans turn up in a wrecked car in the desert, driven by an old Mexican woman. Hollah! Or Hola...Perry gets to the bottom of things (and top and parts peeking out.) I wonder if what Gardner wrote was true at the time: that there was a speciality company making these fans in St. Louis. No more, I am sure, as it's a lost art. People aren't covering anything anymore. Where's the mystery? Ask Perry.
Perry Mason, man of the world, takes us on a little excursion into the world of burlesque in 1947 -- though of course the whole thing is so refined that we never hear the word "burlesque." A typical fast and fun read, though I would say not above average in the series.
So far, so good! Interesting themes regarding Mexicans and Mexican-Americans in California in the 1940s. Not the best "mystery" but the characters are, as always, interesting and have as much depth as 220 pages allows.
More characters than layers, the story unfolds like a roll call of tightly woven, but unlikely situations.
Great fun with Perry Mason and Della Street on the job.
Fast-moving with some interesting characters and an intricate plot. The best part is the glimpse of 1940s L.A.
Perry Mason wins yet again!
