A short story about a Giraffe, Pelican and Monkey who open up a ladderless window cleaning company, who become friendly with a small boy called Billy.
In general, it's written as well as all his others but I think the emphasis on the whimsy really helped this particular story, especially since it was more along the lines of almost-believable whimsy.
Just a nice, delightful quick read for any child or adult, and I'm sure any competent child could definitely handle it alone.Blog | Instagram | Twitter | Pinterest | Shop | Etsy

قصص الأطفال التي كنت أتمنى لو أنني قرأتها صغيرة لأتذوقها حقًا، من الصعوبة بمكان أن تبدأ القراءة في عُمر ما بدون أن تتحسّر على تلك الأيام والسنوات التي قضيتها قبل أن تعرف تلك اللذة.ربما ما سيشكل عوضًا بالنسبة ليّ هو أنني يومًا ما وإذا رُزقت بأطفال سألقي أمامهم بكل تلك القصص البريئة في كل مكان تقع عليه أعينهم.تمّت
Ms Cray was deeply impressed at the breadth of my apian knowledge and offered to read my manuscript with a view to representation by your agency.
I sent a polite enquiry letter a week later, asking for a more formal response to my manuscript.
I am a patient man and I do not appreciate being treated in such a bizarre manner.All I seek is confirmation that my novel, When Bees Attack, has been read by your agency, and whether representation is possible on the strength of the material submitted.Yours truly,Terence Mason*Genuine Reply:Dear Terence,I’m think you may have got our Agency confused as there is no Darren or Cariller Cray working here!Best wishes,Andrea
Friendship is an amazing thing to share!

Quite a cute story.Billy discovers that someone bought the old candy store...and that someone happens to be a giraffe, a pelican and a monkey.
They've opened a window cleaning company, using the monkey's hands to wash, the pelican's beak as a bucket and the giraffe as a ladder.
Quite a clever set up!As you can imagine, this story is full of whimsy and delightful coincidences as they meet the Duke, catch a robber and find a home.Audiobook CommentsRead by Hugh Laurie - and he rocked this audio.
It was so much fun to listen to Laurie read such a childish story!Blog | Instagram | Twitter
I really liked this story! The friendships are great and the duke is a weird eccentric old guy, which I love! Eccentric old people are the best!I also loved the closing poem:We have tears in our eyes,As we wave our goodbyes,We so loved being with you, we three. So do please now and thenCome and see us again,The giraffe and the Pelly and me. All you do is to lookAt a page in this bookBecause that's where we always will be. No book ever endsWhen it's full of your friendsThe giraffe and the Pelly and me.
This was an extremely cute book. I read this book as an adult, for me, by me, with no one else. As an adult I forget how fun it is to read children's chapter books. It brings back memories of when I was in elementary school. Roald Dahl was my favorite author and Matilda was my favorite book of all time in elementary school. My new goal is read every book by him!I suggest this book to anyone that wants a quick, fun read :)
I'd never heard of this one before I found it in a stoop giveaway. Nice readaloud with lots of illustrations in my edition.
What a book!Reminds me of my childhood where simplicity and purity taking place. A great memory!“We have tears in our eyesAs we wave our goodbyes,We so loved being with you, we three.So do please now and thenCome and see us again,The Giraffe and the Pelly and me."All you do is to lookAt a page in this bookBecause that’s where we always will be.No book ever endsWhen it’s full of your friendsThe Giraffe and the Pelly and me.”
This is a short book where Billy finds a ladderless window cleaning shop that has a giraffe, a pelican, and a monkey who clean your windows.
There's something just so effortlessly charming about Roald Dahl's books.
It's a perfect story for little kids that'll keep them enthralled for however long it takes them to read it.
I intend on sharing my Roald Dahl books with my nine-year-old cousin who's recently gotten into reading.
As far as I know she's read at least five books in two months!I also love the little rhymes that Dahl concocts.
This wasn't one of his books that I read as a child so it doesn't have the nostalgic weight that something like The Twits would have, but it's no less charming.
TGATPAE is probably Dahl’s most sweetest and simplest story I’ve read so far in his catalogue. It centers on a little boy who dreams of owning his own candy store 🍭 🍬. When he finds an abandoned building, he meets an eccentric group of window washers consisting of a giraffe, pelican and a monkey giraffe 🦒 🐦 🐒 and together help the boy’s dream come true. It’s not complex or peculiar like many of Dahl’s other children’s books, but has a nice gentler tone and story that no fan of Roald Dahl should ignore (Grade: B+).
Dibanding dua buku lain yang kubaca barengan, ini tampaknya yang paling bisa dibaca Shasha tanpa mesti ditemenin. Hahaha. Tapi, jadinya biasa aja, nggak seimajinatif yang dua, meski tetap fantastis.
After a sweets shop goes on the selling block, our narrator, Billy, watches with amazement when a new company mysterious appears, as if overnight.
Billy goes to check things out, where he comes across a giraffe sticking its head out of the top-floor window.
After a letter arrives from the Duke of Hampshire, Billy and his three new friends begin the journey to offer their window washing services.
Dahl pushes the silliness to the brink here, but the rhyming and sing-song nature keep the story light and full of entertaining antics.
With another child protagonist (as attentive readers will see, many Dahl tales are narrated by children), the story progresses.
Another short, well illustrated book by Roald Dahl.
One day when he finds out that the house has been bought by a giraffe, a pelican and a monkey , he meets them and they become instant friends.
The story goes about how they get to meet a duke and how the boy finally fulfills him dream.
The book is written as if it were a poem.
The words written beautifully and ring even after you put the book down.
The best part of the edition that I own of this book is the interesting info given in the end about Roald Dahl, his likings and habits.

Three entrepreneurial critters team up with a sweet-tooth little boy to wash windows and happen to bust a criminal in the middle of a burglary. Typical Roald Dahl daftery.The story itself was 3 stars, but Hugh Laurie's narration made it extra fun. There's something about his voice that is perfectly suited to Dahl's nonsense candy names.

review to come...
A wonderful story, it reminded me of a movie which called "Pai" which i watched once. it was the first experiance with Roald Dahl but definatly it won't be the last i enjoyed it :)
*****5.0*****Review soon
Out of all the Roald Dahl I've read this was the least enjoyable so far. The story felt thrown together.
Roald Dahl was my favorite author as a kid. So fun to discover some of his books I missed. Read this with my 4 year old and he loved it too!
B.R.A.CE. 2017 ένα βιβλίο που θα έπρεπε να έχεις διαβάσει στο σχολείο  Τι ωραία ιστορία! παιδική, εκπαιδευτική κι απολαυστική! Για κάποιο λόγο ενώ το διάβαζα "έπαιζα" τις φωνές στο μυαλό μου κι απολάμβανα κάθε διάλογο!
Billy begitu kecewa karena dia berharap bahwa dialah yang akan membeli rumah itu dan bermimpi memiliki Toko Permen, dengan segala permen yang lezat seperti Sherber Sucker, Caramel Fudge, Russian Toffe, Sugar Snorter dan Butter Gumball dan ribuan permen lainnya dari seluruh dunia.
Yups, The Grubber berubah menjadi Perusahaan Pembersih Jendela Tanpa Tangga karena ternyata yang membeli rumah kayu tersebut adalah si Jerapah, Si Pelly dan si Kera, pantas saja rumah itu berubah menjadi rumah yang punya pintu tinggi buat Jerapah dan tiga jendela buat longokan si Pelly dan Si Kera.
4.5 starsA Roald Dahl book read by Hugh Laurie? Yes please. So much fun, Roald Dahl's trademark quirkiness is at play, it had me smiling much of the way through :)
