Weaving together all the beauty and wonder that has made this series so captivating, The Iron Knight explores the darkest places of the Nevernever as Ash faces truths, challenges and revelations in his quest for a soul; racing towards a climax that will leave you breathless!In all honestly I’m saddened to see this series come to an end, but I found this book to be a very fitting end to a series that has taken me on highs and lows, through danger and adventure, shown me love and heartbreak and ultimately captured me with each and every book.
Ash is looking for something and they have the help of that sweet ish kitty, Grimalkin =) And I love Nevernever.
On this journey, the friends run into all kinds of crazy stuff.
Anyway, come to find out the wolf was sent by Ash's mom Mab to help him on his journey.
I was mad as hell because I didn't want that person in the picture, but it turns out that it was fine in the end.
Ash has to journey to the end of the world in order to take some tests and if he passes he will get his wish and be able to be with Meghan again.
This story was action-packed and engaging right to the very end.Picking up where 'The Iron Queen' and 'Summer's Crossing' left off, Ash and Meghan are separated for most of this book.
He'll stop at nothing to get back to her.In some ways it was kind of fitting that now that Ash has finally figured out that he loves Meghan that he would be kept apart from her.
So, I kind of felt like most of this book was Ash's dose of karma for how he rebuffed Meghan in 'The Iron Daughter'.
Like 'Summer's Crossing', Meghan was absent for a large part of this book.
UPDATE UPON READING: Love this book, my favorite of the series!!!!
I feel I understand Ash and his perspective on things much better now.
Ms. Kagawa has done it again!!!
Ash was much less...
romanticized in this book, which makes sense and I'm glad that Ms. Kagawa did that.
If he was still like the "perfect" guy, that wouldn't make logical sense.
I also like that this book reveals the true depth of his emotions for Meghan amidst any and all obstacles.
Now I will go to cry, I can't believe this series is over!!!
How could Julie Kagawa meet the excellent story telling of The Iron Queen and her previous books in her series?
We thought we finally broke through Ash's icey-facade in The Iron Queen, but what we find in The Iron Knight, is that there is many more layers that needed peeling away to get to the heart of this amazing character.
to The River of Dreams and The Deep Wylde, and culminates at The End of the World and The Testing Grounds, all the while accompanied by Puck and Grimalkin and two VERY unlikely characters from Ash's past.During Ash's quest, Julie cleverly inserted some wonderfully romantic moments as well (remember...
Maybe I'm in a bad mood lately, or maybe my standards have suddently become impossibly high, but I didn't like this novel.Brief recap of what this story is about: to be with girl, boy has to acquire a soul.
Given that now he's kind of depressed, sad, tired, indecisive and generally behaves like an emo, that's not conductive for a lively read.If you don't know what an "emo" is:
In fact, I'd love to know my boyfriend lives with the soul of his ex.
Ash, I love you. Enough said.
O_O ► STORY: After the end of third book, where Meghan claimed her throne and became the Iron Queen, she exiled Ash using his true name to keep him away from staying with her and dying in pain.
I loved that chapter the most <3and i cried during the part where Ash and Puck fought for the last time :( (hide spoiler)] ► CHARACTERS: ♦ 
Ash, the winter prince, the one who makes the whole world swoon - drastically changes in this book.
Because, all Ash did was think if he loved Meghan or Ariella more.
I also really love both Ash and Puck, both of them have great personalities and are the most loyal friends you will find.
Reading about bits of their past as best friends is so endearing it make my heart want of shatter into a million pieces.And you can't not love Grimalkin.I don’t think the entirety of how attached I’d become to this world, to these characters hit me only when I was reading this final book.
As I neared the end of this book the reality that I was actually going to leave this world of faeries, love, and friendship hit me like a punch to the gut.
Well, I am ecstatic to say that in The Iron Knight, Julie Kagawa gives us the perfect journey to the perfect ending that this stellar series deserves.The Iron Knight was one of my most highly anticipated books of 2011, and WOW did Julie deliver.
We see every vulnerability Ash hides behind that cold exterior, and we feel the extent of his absolute devotion to Meghan.
Besides, we've had three books with her, and I'm a sucker for any kind of alternate POV, especially from the hero's perspective, to truly feel the extent of his love for our heroine.So this Ash fangirl thanks you, Julie Kagawa, for creating such a satisfying, stirring end to this beloved series.
Some parts are just so tedious and useless."I will be with her again, or I will die."(this gif is everything)Yeah, I know that there was all that oath thing, so he was obliged to keep his word, yadda yadda, but stil: gag.•I did like Ash as main character more than Meghan; not that it took that much, considering that when I began to read The Iron Knight I could formulate just one intelligible thought, and it was: No more Meghan for a while.
Well, that what's happened to me after reading The Iron Knight.I feel in love with this series right from the very first book.
But fear not, for Ash and Puck are accompanied with a couple of familiar characters and one other companion that we nevah saw coming.This was by far my favorite of the Iron Fey books.
So all I'm gonna say is that for any fans of this epic series, this book is a must have to add to your collection.I will miss Ash and Meghan, Puck and Grim and the countless adventures, but while their story ends here, another will begin in her Iron Fey Spinoff that stars Meghan's brother, Ethan, all grown up.
I cried when Ash attempted to end Puck life suppressed by ever burning rage of lost and pain, Puck stood still gazing directly into Ash with his bright green eyes confessing his love for Meghan, his pain, his loss, I cried when Ariella helped them in their quest sacrificing her love and life for Ash. I felt empty when I finished this book, I felt something has gone from my life, something has ended.Julie Kagawa did a fantastic job, what a captivating, mesmerizing writing.
I’m very thankful that Julie Kagawa didn’t leave us the bittersweet ending of Megan and Ash story in the 3rd book (The Iron Queen) for making this 4th .
[drum roll] The Iron Knight!As the final installment of Iron fey series, Ash must take an impossible journey to find his way back to Megan.
Would he still want it if he did?It’s sad to see the characters and their journey that true marked in our heart comes to an end.
Especially the strings between Ash and Puck, their friendship is indisputable despite the tons differences they have.Oh how much I love this book.
See my review of the entire series on my blog!_______________________________Julie Kagawa is a god.This series is easily my most favorite series of all time.
And Ashallayn'darkmyr Tallyn is easily the best hero in all of YA fantasy.
Just when I thought I couldn't love him more, I read this book.
I realize now that love is an understatement for what I feel about Ash.There wasn't a single part of this book that disappointed me.
And the ending...oh...
<3 Thank you is all I have to say.
Thank you Julie Kagawa for giving me the ending that I was desperately craving for.
Julie Kagawa?<3
My name, my full, True Name, is Ashallyn'darkmyr Tallyn, and I am the last son of the Unseelie Court. I was not a big fan of the first two Iron Fey books, but The Iron Queen completely stole my heart! Those of you who've read it know all about the beautiful romance, the fierce battle and the bittersweet ending that ensued. I suspect many of her fans were unhappy with the way Kagawa wrapped things up. In fact, some were probably even outraged, but not me – I loved it. That’s why I wasn’t too thr
A fourth book, written from Prince Ash's point of view, could only mean a different ending for him and Meghan.
I’m not sorry that I got to spend more time with Ash, Puck and especially Grimalkin, I just wish there was a way to make everything less (view spoiler)[perfect (hide spoiler)] in the end.
Ash, Puck, Grimalkin and the Big Bad Wolf travel to the End of the World knowing that no one has ever come back alive.
Reaching the end of the Nevernever means almost certain death for them all, but Ash swore an oath that compels him to move forward.
(view spoiler)[That boy sure loves his oaths.
I can only hope that this will put my heart at ease. After the iron queen, my heart felt shattered. I hope beyond hope that this ends up being ash and puck, their journey to find grim and hopefully mend the frayed fabric that was ash and meghan.
Put Ash and everyone else to go to the End of the World...otherwise nothing would happen in this book!(4) Add A LOT OF ANGST and Ash carrying on about "Meghan I love you but you rejected me!!!!" whining into the story.(5) (view spoiler)[Get Ash's supposedly dead girlfriend to make the final sacrifice for Ash so he can become human.
In my opinion, Ash should have been spending the next 100 years to redeem himself before he can win back the right of being with anyone else.You know what, not every YA book needs to have a Happy Ever After, The Darkangel trilogy doesn't, and it's freaking awful to create one plot convenience after another to make way for your HEA!But stupid me, what am I thinking?
In the beginning of the book, I was a bit pissed at Ash. What really bugged me was the whole I-love-you-Ariella,-if-I-hadn't-made-that-promise-to-Meghan-I-don't-know-what-I'd-do thing.
That's when I really began feeling sorry for Ash. And when I say I felt sorry for him, what I mean is that I wanted to pull him out of that horrible book where terrible things kept happening to him, and just hug him and give him some chocolate and tell him that everything would be ok.
So despite everything Ash and Meghan got their happy ending.
Posted on: http://bookpassionforlife.blogspot.com/ "I’m almost there. Wait for me just a little bit longer." I honestly don’t even know where to begin with this review and I don’t even think I could write a review that will do this book the praise it deserves but I will say this, The Iron Knight had everything I could have asked for and more. Julie Kagawa has utterly surpassed my expectations and blown all previous books away with her truly amazing writing, her creative imagination and her gift
I’m left with Joy because it’s the most perfect ending to a fantastic series and sadness because it’s finally come to an end.
Looking back on all four books, I honestly would have been sad had it of ended with The Iron Queen therefore I am truly grateful to Julie to have continued on with the series and created another amazing piece of work.
Even though the series has come to an end, it will truly not be forgotten and will be forever in our hearts.
This was a YA fantasy story, about Ash trying to find a way to be with Meghan in the Iron court.I liked Ash in this, and I felt sorry for him too.
We also didn’t get much from Meghan at all in this book, which was quite a change.
The storyline in this was about Ash trying to become human so that he could return to Meghan and live with her in the Iron Realm, which required a journey and several tests.
(view spoiler)[ So will Ash age and die like we saw?
Ash, one of the male protagonist in this series, takes center stage and becomes the main voice as he takes a journey for love.
He's torn about a lot of the possible decisions in his future and it was great to see him be a little on the weaker side throughout this book.
Emotionally(view spoiler)[I was not expecting to like this book as much as I actually did.The plot was fascinating.
There was an amazing plot twists in this book that blew me away!
I didn't expect that much development in one book.Overall, this is a really fun and entertaining series.
Such a beautiful story with my beautiful Ash. 😍😍
4 stars seems too low and I think I love Iron Queen a little more (which I gave 5 stars).
Besides Puck, Ash finds himself accompanied by a few surprise companions and of course, the Cat. This book seemed to be slower paced that the others, focusing mainly on a lot of character development.
I think it's fair to say by the end of the book you will know as much about tAsh as you did about Meghan.
We also get a chance to see just how much Ash loves Meghan.
So, if you loved the Iron Fey series definitely give The Iron Knight a go!More reviews and more at Cuddlebuggery Book Blog.
DNFI just don't care about anything that happens here.
I am not interested in the story and characters.I am very disappointed with this series, everyone seems to love these books but I can't bring myself to care for this story.
Despite being left unmoved by the Iron Fey series, Julie Kagawa's Blood of Eden series is still one of my favorite young-adult fantasy series of all time, thus, I am not giving up on this author.The Iron King (The Iron Fey #1) - 2 starsThe Iron Daughter (The Iron Fey #2) - 2.5 starsThe Iron Queen (The Iron Fey #3) - 1.5 stars
Oh, and it’s really annoying how she’s basically a plot device to add “tension” to the book when I really felt none because her role in the book in the story will only end up one way – GONE.
I thought this was pretty nifty and fun but then, you know, it would get in the way our couple’s happy ending so this is totally not gonna happen.I don’t get how it’s a sacrifice for him to give up his immortality to be with Meghan if he gets to LIVE FOREVER ANYWAY.
After reading The Iron Queen, I remember saying that I was glad seeing Meghan mature. This time, it’s Ash’s turn…  “I promised I’d find a way for us to be together, I intend to keep that promise.” I should have read the Survival Guide to the Nevernever first before I prowled into the book. Iron Knight is a non-stop action/adventure. Ash is so serious in keeping his promise that he was willing to go through everything as quickly as he should, and travel the extra mile needed to gain a soul. A ver
After reading The Iron Queen, I remember saying that I was glad seeing Meghan mature.
Ash is so serious in keeping his promise that he was willing to go through everything as quickly as he should, and travel the extra mile needed to gain a soul.
Often, when we speak of gaining a soul, we speak of morality.
I believe that the ending of the series was very powerful and effective because of that.Congratulations Ms. Julie Kagawa, and thank you for the wonderful journey through the world of Iron Fey.
Loved it! =D <3(I wrote such an awesome review for this, so hardly, but one stupid click made all my hardwork gone) >.<So yeah. Loved it! ^.^

I chose Chelsea's review because she perfectly captured what I felt reading this book...
See, I have a thing : although I can adore a world, the beautiful writing which brings it to live, a fast-paced plot and stunning twists, yet multi-layered characters always stay my undoing.
