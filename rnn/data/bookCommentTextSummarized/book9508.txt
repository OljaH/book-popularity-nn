I'm simply loving this one.
Unable to put down the book.
This book definitely is different from what i have/ used to read until now.
It's always been one of my Dad's highly recommended books to me and for some strange reason i had only kept postponing and now, i only wish i had not.
i recommend one to read to know what it takes to run the show in a hospital and you get a perspective on things at the back end.
I have honestly never thought about hospital administration and politics that might be involved.
Overall a good read.
reading Arthur Hailey is like swimming in a pool full of pleasant water. His books don't make you think, they make you feel. After reading you have pocketful of emotions and new knowledge. The Final Diagnosis is the best way to chill out after a hard day or to escape to the world full of other people's troubles and worries from your own. This book shows some aspects of a chief-job, those aspects that sometimes hidden in a bunch of money and power.
Being a doctor myself who works with the laboratories in the hospitals there was not one thing I could not relate to with the issues that happen in the story.A point for Dr. Pearson's advice to Dr. Coleman in the end, very practical stuff. However it is very medically written therefore not everyone may get the flow.
Beautiful. The duration of the story is short, but the author has gone out to give life history of all the main characters. Captivating. As a medical student there were so many things I could relate to, and I'm sure when I become a doctor the number will only increase. Touching. I had tears in my eyes, twice.Above all, this book is a great lesson in understanding people and their actions.
Literarno, meƒëutim, ovaj roman ne bih svrstao u sam vrh knji≈æevnih dostignuƒáa (kao ≈°to su, recimo Garidov "ƒåitaƒç le≈°eva", Goldstounova "Anatomija obmane" ili Gordonov veliƒçanstveni "Medicus") jer su radnja i likovi u mnogome nerazraƒëeni i povr≈°ni.
Vi≈°e me stilski i konstrukcijski podseƒáa na dobar esej, ili na neki od dnevnika kliniƒçke prakse koje vode sta≈æisti u bolnicama nego na roman per se.
Ono ≈°to me posebno porazilo, jeste ƒçinjenica da je zdravstveni sistem u mnogim krajevima na≈°e zemlje i dalje ostao na ovom stupnju razvoja (a roman je objavljen 1959.

With the amount of hype with which I started reading this book I thought I would never keep down this book.
They haven't read this particular book but they have read another one of the same author.The books starts at a snail's pace.
Because of all these unknown medical terms I felt like I was reading the book version of the popular series Dr. House but with less humor, less sarcasm and less lot of other good qualities.I don't know what else I should include here because this plot has a potential to strike gold but the author spurned the chance.
"Right" and "wrong" are fuzzy in the field of medicine. How lives can be made, or shattered, by a single decision! How much can depend on a single test! How dramatic the consequences of one diagnosis can be!A story through the lens of a pathology lab, this had me riveted. We don't quite value pathologists enough, always reserving our praise for the kind physicians and fancy surgeons. This should change. A great read!
Gripping NovelFast paced story with extremely interesting characters woven into realistic episodes. Descriptions are so vivid one can actually visualise things happening in front of your eyes. Author must have done a lot of research. Highly enjoyable book with a feel good factor.
good storyline, realistic but never felt the rush to hold on to the book, was a relaxed read .
I was depressed by the end of story for some characters.:(

This was an extremely easy book to read, and yes medical facts in here are outdated, but the theme and human relationships are universal. This is not a type of book that thesis and essays will be based but still it will somehow always find a way to a reader. It's a pretty lighthearted book despite it deals with sickness and deaths, at least for me it was. And although I'm not really completely head over heels mad for the book I think it's really good and it gave me a couple of enjoyable hours of reading.
For starters, the research shows.As detailed as the author in his delineation of the workings of a hospital, at no point do things become cumbersome. Both the administrative workings of the hospital and the medical cases interspersed throughout go hand in hand, and the reader is spoilt for choice in case he/she already has a soft spot for the inclusion of one of the two.A happy ending is hard to ask for; even so the end doesn't lean towards tragic. Death and calamity is a part of life and the author showcases that effortlessly.
Le√≠ este libro demasiado joven, demasiado pronto y demasiado deprisa. Fue tal vez una de las experiencias m√°s divertidas de mi vida lectora. Con solo 13 √≥ 14 a√±os, apenas pude comprender c√≥mo era posible que alguien escribiera algo tan divertido, tan apasionante, tan sombr√≠o. Una posterior relectura, hace unos a√±os, me mostr√≥ mi error y mi ingenuidad, pero confirm√≥ la gran habilidad de Hailey. Sus novelas resisten incluso los embates de mi progresivo cinismo.
Arthur Hailey explores the workings of a hospital and the possibilities of errors by doctors which can have catastrophic consequences for patients.This is a solid medical thriller with lots of painstaking research.

Fast reading if u are into medical stuff. Keeps your interest. I usually don't read fiction,but this was enjoyable to pass the time.
But pathology also has to do the analysis of tissues and other body matter of living patients to find what is wrong with them, providing the input to doctors in various departments of the hospital to take further action.
Sometimes the right diagnosis can mean the difference between life and death.Hailey‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Final Diagnosis‚Äù, published in 1959, is a heart-wrenching hospital drama that takes us into the workings of a pathology department struggling to meet its responsibilities in a hospital that is on the path to modernization and expansion.
One cannot exist without the other and the latter especially playing a critical role of leading the medical practitioners in the right direction in deciding the most correct and appropriate course of action for a patient.To bring forth the functioning and the characteristics of pathology and its impact on other aspects of medicine, Hailey has slowly yet methodically woven a plethora of characters, right from the top echelons to the lowest level employee of a hospital.
Another aspect of the story is the old versus new generation battle that seemingly consumes both the generations throughout the book.
Typical Arthur HaileyI love this author. He depicts well the industry that is the backdrop for this book. The people are real and multi-dimensional. I read a number of his books in high school, but somehow missed this one. Main lesson - keep up and never stop learning.
At the center of the conflict is Dr. Joseph Pearson, a sixty-six year old pathologist who is obstinate, opinionated, brilliant but resistant to change.
Dr. Pearson steadfastly refuses to see the light, but is eventually convinced to accept an assistant pathologist.
An interesting observation, which has remarkable validity.In the context of the swirling conflict, the novel focuses on two principle cases: a student nurse with a possible malignant bone tumour who may lose her leg, and an infant with a potentially incompatible Rh factor that may result in death.
Charged with emotion, romance, politics and drama, but this time with a hospital as a set-up.
Despite taking second opinions from the best in the country, he's unable to come to a solid conclusion and finally rules it as 'malignant' and the girl loses her leg to an amputation and he's later proved to be right.The second case is that of an Rh negative pregnant woman, whose blood is sent to pathology for sensitivity report.
The pathologist uses an outdated method and rules the woman to be not sensitized.
The title remains justified, as back then THE FINAL DIAGNOSIS was given by the pathology department, and any error on their part could cause havoc in a perfectly normal prognosis, something which could have been handled in a better way ensuring survival or protection of the patients.The various characters through their own parts reinforce the dignity and the responsibility which the people of the medical field ought to have.
This is a truly wonderful book written by a highly competent and brilliant author.
The administration is struggling with older equipment in some parts of the hospital, and one older doctor who is critical to its operation, that being the pathologist.
In the same time framing he makes a "final diagnosis" of cancer of the bone in a young and beautiful student nurse, causing her to have her leg amputated.
A major new wing is being planned and developed while the hospital administration is struggling to replace the dishwashers in the cafeteria.
This is an older book, having been around for some time.
