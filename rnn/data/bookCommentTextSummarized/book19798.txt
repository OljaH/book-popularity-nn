When I first started reading the book, I couldn't help rolling my eyes and thinking "Here we go, another tale of a precious, privileged woman who is unsatisfied with her life." I stuck with it though and was charmed through the Italy section by Gilbert's humor and down-to-earth writing style.
Most importantly I still have not really grasped why it was necessary for her to travel to these 3 places.I understand that her intention was not for this book to be a travelogue but it begs the question, "Why was it necessary to go to Italy, India and Indonesia if the purpose was to not to gain something from them that could not be found elsewhere?" In every country Gilbert created a little security blanket of expat friends who seemed to cushion her from really understanding the lessons the countries had to offer on their own terms.
Double cringe.Italy: The author's angst and shallow self-discovery and pretend real people met with the express purpose of reflecting what she would like to 'learn' (lessons that most of us will have learned far earlier in life before more interesting lessons presented themselves.) To quote a phrase from the "Italy" section of this book, "cross the street" if you dare to even glance in a bookstore window and entertain a thought of buying this book.
This book is so vicarious that it reveals a profound and deeply disturbing ignorance about the complexities of real life.
Eat Pray Love is the monologue of a Neurotic American Princess ("Liz") in her mid thirties.
This time however, it's David's bathroom floor.
According to her, this is the best book she has read this year.
You will get to the end of this book and may still be under the illusion that it is not your responsibility to make yourself happy.
I look like Susan Sontag in gumboots compared to this book.In EPL, the author's only explanation for her pathetic simpering twattery is that she is "as affectionate as a cross between a Golden Retriever and a barnacle".
Or maybe a Golden Retriever with barnacles.
Liz is so obsessed with male attention throughout the book (in every section, she expounds in great detail on her flirtations with men, many of whom seem to "take care of her" or compliment her on her wit, beauty, or charm), that it makes her self-described quest to learn to be alone seem absurd and farcical.
That a Westerner could go to India on her spiritual quest and have absolutely no awareness of 1) her gross appropriation of another culture's religion, and 2) the abject poverty that surrounds her, is inexusable.
The endless, endless crying).Then again, this is a memoir and when the writing is just so clever, so hospitable, so damn funny, it's really hard to hold that against Gilbert in the end.The plot goes something like this: A 30-year-old writer has everything she wants, including several successful books, a husband and two houses.
So simple, but so fulfilling.In India, she writes that "life, if you keep chasing it so hard, will drive you to death." Gilbert is living in an Ashram, a place where people come to meditate and experience divinity.
What really gets me about this book is the absurd entitlement of it all: I'm bored of my life so I'm going to cry a lot and stop shaving my legs and run off to a bunch of exotic locations because running away from my problems is the best way to deal with it.And it's not like she does anything worthwhile with her time.
All those cynics out there who criticize Gilbert for writing a "too cutesy" memoir that seems beyond belief and who claim that she is selfish for leaving her responsibility are clearly missing the point.
I also suspect that those of you who didn't enjoy the book could not relate to it.
Traveling the world is not self-indulgent.
If doing what we want to or enjoy doing is self-indulgent, then we are all guilty.
My guess is that those of you who didn't find the value in this book are unhappy with your own life.
Perhaps you should be a little more self-indulgent yourself.
I have met enough people freshly returned from Indian ashrams to know that they often seem a tad self absorbed and I also suspect that they really only get up at 3am so that they have even more "me" time.
She didn't do much to alter my opinion.Honestly, this woman meditated longer, harder and bluer than anyone else has, past or present.
Possibly it was not enlightenment that she found, but simply that she finally became completely self absorbed.
Shallow, self-indulgent and mired in the sort of liberal American obsession with "oriental" exoticism that is uniquely offensive because it is treated as enobling by its purveyors. She treats the rest of the world as though it exists for the consumption of jaded, rich, white Americans and this book is a monument to that sort of arrogance and ignorance.
أنا أعرف كيف يشعر المرء حين يرغب بشئ ما..صدقني أعرف تماماً ما هي الرغبة لكنها لم تكن موجودة..كنت أحاول أن أقنع نفسي بأنّ ما أشعر به طبيعي مع أن كل الأدلة تشير إلي العكس، كإحدي معارفي التي التقيت بها الأسبوع الماضي و التي اكتشفت للتو أنها حامل للمرة الأولي..كانت منتشية، أخبرتني أنها تريد أن تكون أماً إلي الأبد..رأيت الفرحة في عينيها و عرفتها.
تهرب من خيبات امل و قهر و خذلان و علاقات ميتة و احلام مجهضة باحت اليزابيث بالمسكوت عنه ..و فعلت ما حلمت به كل نساء الارض مهما انكرن :ينطلقن بحثاعن السلام النفسي و الحرية  عندما تقرا على لسان امراة ثلاثينية انها "لا تريد ان تكون متزوجة بعد اليوم!!
!ا to be safe and happy in life: intelligence, friendship, strength, and poetryو لاني لا احب الشعر لن احصل على السعادة اذن 😢لا هنا و لا في بالي اليزابيث شاركت اهل البلاد الثلاثة التي زارتها افراحهم و اتراحهم..طعامهم و بعض اوجاعهم..كل ذلك و هي تبحث عن ايمانها ..عن سلامها المنشود ..عن القليل من كل شيء ..
I've read other readers' reviews in which she was described as 'so funny' and like 'a girl we'd all love to know' and have to tell you, I didn't feel the love.
Plus, she acted like she is the only person in the world to suffer through a divorce, yet she was "totally in love" with another man less than a month after she realized she wanted out of her marriage (and her account isn't clear as to how long after her realization she actually got the divorce-ball rolling so I can't help but assume she was unfaithul.) So it was hard to have sympathy for her when she got hysterical over the ex disagreeing about settlement details.
When she wasn't being overly wordy, I loved reading her descriptions of Italy, India, and most especially Indonesia.
First of all, the breathless giddiness of the "Italy" portion of the book is grating, because it's almost as if she's embarrassed, or apologetic, or something, especially when she moves on to "India" and the tone immediately shifts to one of utter self-seriousness.I also would have told her to chop off about a third of the first part of her book.
Also...I know from experience divorce makes the people who get divorced VERY SELF-CENTERED.
Lastly, it's very disheartening that a book ostensibly about a spiritual journey to the self begins with details about her Manhattan real estate holdings and ends with...
What I'm about to say must be wrong, because I couldn't get through this book.
Don't read it.A cousin recommended EPL and I thought it would teach me something about the book market.
Oh yeah, they already do.
It's called the GAIAM catalog.Yeah.
Ladies: Country I is not your personal terrain for self-discovery.
You don't get to interiorize Country I as a metaphor for your personal potential.
If your interior journey needs a bunch of leisure time and poor countries to be realized, maybe you're asking the wrong questions.The consumerist mentality was so self-important and so priveleged that I just couldn't make myself give this book any more time.
Ok. I really didn't READ it all. I couldn't. I just couldn't get past how self centered and whiny this woman was. I just wanted to scream GET OVER YOURSELF! Then I quit reading it and now I feel much better.
واو !أعظم الكُتب هي تلك التي تُغير حياتك ..هذا الكتاب , قادر على تغييرِ حياتي بلا أدنى شك ..كتاب عظيم ... عظيم جداً ..
"Eat, Pray, Love" is about "one woman's search for everything across Italy, India" and blah, blah, blah, do we really care?"Liz" starts out in the first chapter by making me smirk.
Because a self-help book written by a woman and for women can't end until the female heroine has met "The Great Love of Her Life".
Which of course she can only meet after learning to love herself.I know that this book is supposed to be autobiographical and that she is actually still involved with this man.
Life is so unfair for the poor woman wahhhh.Please, poor woman is completely lost so what does she do?
Why she takes a year off and travels to Italy, India & Indonesia to try and find herself.
She finds herself by traveling to three parts of the world - Italy to find her body, India to find her spirit and Indonesia to find a balance between the two.
OK, that part I get but I just had a real difficult time finding sympathy for a woman who is able to do all of that and still find time to whine about how hard life is for her.
The author’s voice is so soothing that I was immediately gripped, but that doesn’t mean I fell in love with this story.
this book wasn’t written with any intention to help other women in the world.
I especially find this story unhelpful to women who are perhaps going through a divorce and need to find themselves again because who really has hundreds of thousands of dollars to spend traveling for a whole year, knowing that at the end of their trip they will receive more money from the book they would have written over that period of time?
All of these boxes were arriving at my door because my daughter was taking wing on a journey like none before, and she is, for her 26 years, well traveled even when measured against adults thrice her age.
While our individual journeys in life may vary in detail, and no doubt rather unimportant detail, Gilbert touches so very many of her readers because in her honest, open, sincere, and often deliciously hilarious and hilariously delicious account, she speaks for many, many, many of us.
I don't think I've ever disliked an author more than Elizabeth Gilbert.
Gilbert has the emotional maturity of an insecure teenage girl.
In Eat Pray Love, she comes off as completely self centered.
But no one more so than Elizabeth Gilbert.
After she ate, and prayed, she met some amazing guy who she "fell" in love with, then, she got a book deal.
But wait, it gets even better ~~ she got to meet Oprah!
Gilbert is "suddenly" gay and publicly comes out, proclaiming her love for her best friend who just happens to be dying from pancreatic cancer.
Elizabeth Gilbert is going through life unaffected by anything except her own whims.
She gave no convincing reason for leaving him other than that she was sad.She spent her time in Italy eating and congratulating herself on not having sex with a good-looking Italian man.She spent her time in India "meditating" although it sounded more like complaining to me.
She is perfectly able to live her life however she sees fit, I am just irritated she put it in a book under a different guise and I fell for it.
Especially if you're going to spend every day of the rest of your life with YOU.Despite our best efforts to be happy, however, we're human and shit happens: She'd fallen in love with a Sardinian artist, who'd promised her another world of light and sun, but had left her, instead, with three children and no choice but to return to Venice and run the family restaurant.
The brothers inhabit the four virtues a person needs in order to be safe and happy in life: intelligence, friendship, strength, and (I love this one) poetry.

this was beautiful and long journey between Italy , India , Indonesia i learned a lot of things in this book was amazing and a little boring for me i loved Italy part more than India and Indonesia but it's good book over all and happy to read it 💕'
Liz Gilbert is my hero. That is all.
أداء رائع جبار وسيرة ذاتية ضمن سياق روائي مذهل..المشكلة في تقييمي لأمر ما هو دائما ما يكون تحت الضغط الذي تسوقه العواطف لكن ما وجدته في هذا الكتاب يسمو أيضا عن جبر خاطر العاطفة .....إن رحلة البحث عن الذات وايثار حياة الاستقرار لإعادة استكشاف الروح هو محتوي هذه القطعة الابداعية أما الماهية فكانت من خلال العنوان ( طعام،صلاة،حب).فالطعام مقرون باللذة والروحانية هي سمو النفس من خلال الصلاة والحب مصدره العاطفة لذا كان السفر الي ايطاليا فالهند عقبتها رحله اندونيسيا ...........أذهلني الكتاب وراقلي ما قرأت وأنا الان أقرأه من جديد بنسخته الانجليزية...حقا يستحق الاشادة
The best example of this was a chapter in which the author abruptly reveals that she traveled through her meditative vortex and encountered God. There's no setting the stage or putting the experience into the context of the rest of the book, just several long pages describing the ways she couldn't possibly describe it.
It felt to me that she was finally living her life instead of just writing about it.After a few days of processing the book, what stood out for me was the author's truly courageous willingness to write in an intensely personal style and be completely honest about herself.
I felt that some of the 36 sections were rather arbitrarily forced into sections, but I still love the set-up.I can't speak for her trips in Italy and Bali, knowing nothing about the culture, but I can speak for India, and it needs it.To sum up the "Pray" chapter in one line: Her experience in India was akin to someone coming to America and staying at Disneyland for four months.This is not to belittle her spiritual development there; in fact, I think the India section was my favorite out of the three.
