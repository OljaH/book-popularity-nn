Near them on the sand,Half sunk, a shatter'd visage lies, whose frownAnd wrinkled lip and sneer of cold commandTell that its sculptor well those passions readWhich yet survive, stamp'd on these lifeless things,The hand that mock'd them and the heart that fed.And on the pedestal these words appear:"My name is Ozymandias, king of kings:Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!"Nothing beside remains: round the decayOf that colossal wreck, boundless and bare,The lone and level sands stretch far away.‚ÄùAnd they did read.
I just don't like Shelley. Where Keats seems subtle, Shelley seems didactic. Where Coleridge seems erudite, Shelley seems merely self-serious. His poetry really gets under my skin, especially his longer, allegorical works like Masque of Anarchy. I'm sure he was a genius, but I sometimes wonder how much of his appeal is a result of juicy biography and fortunate association.
After 10 years, reading is always re-reading! Aah, you problematic fave, you. Better than wrinkle cream.
Shelley is great if you are in a philosophical mood. :) He is still a distant follower, though, to Keats in my mind.
