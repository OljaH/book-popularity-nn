It is happening but yet nothing happens. People are absurd, living for gossip. Goga as a town is dirty and unhealthy, full of demons form past. Didn't like the book that much, it's is quite difficult to read though I love the absurd.
one more time. :)
Depressing
Interesting book
Difficult to understand because the story is about an unreal city with a lot of weird people in it.
