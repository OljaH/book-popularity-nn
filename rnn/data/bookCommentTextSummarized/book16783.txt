Anderson doesn't flinch from sharing details of Che's responsibility for executions of comrades and of enemies in the field, the darker side of the Cuban Revolution.The third section, which is the longest in the biography, focuses on several areas: Che's work for the Cuban government to develop Cuba's industrial infrastructure and move its economy from capitalism to socialism; Che's role in the complex international intrigue and negotiations of the time, maneuvering against the US while also playing the USSR and China off each other; and Che's final role as column leader and field commander of two failed insurrections, one in the Congo and one in Bolivia, which eventually cost him his life.
Great read! it has depth plus it was intricately researched and well written/balanced..saw the good and bad...highly recommend..(paperback!)
“Shoot, coward, you are only going to kill a man.” -Ernesto ‘Che’ Guevara’s last words* (Anderson, 1991:735) Ernesto 'Che' Guevara de la SernaThose words make me shudder.
This is a well researched work grounded on extensive and exclusive primary sources that were given to Anderson when he approached Che Guevara’s widow, Aleida March, a distinction other written biographies lack that inevitably strips them of some semblance of true portrayal of Che’s life if not sheer outright veracity that led to biographies that have often resulted to sanctimonious and romanticized accounts.
Definitely, yes!Did I come to know Ernesto ‘Che’ Guevara?
This is the book one must read to know Che Guevara.
The author tries to give an account as balanced as you possibly could about a man as complex as Che. The research effort put into this is immense and it shows in the details.
The important thing for me was that Anderson showed us both sides of the man.
In the end he was a flawed man, who believed that what he was doing was for the good of the poor and the oppressed.
I admit that I try to overlook his dark side a little bit in order to let him shine just enough.And may I say it...this book changes the way I view things...
Part 2 covers the battle for Cuba and the Cuban Revolution and Part 3 focuses on life after the Cuban victory up to his death in Bolivia.There is a huge amount of detail and ground covered in this book, so much so that 'huge' isn't an apt enough word to use.
There were times when I was completely enthralled by the story the author was presenting me with, his research phenomenal and attention to detail obviously passionate; I had to keep reminding myself this was true.
I read Che because I generally like biographies.
I think it is good for twenty-somethings who are asking "what are my values and how will I commit to them in my life?" to read biographies of people who have done that whether their values are similar or different.
What I loved about this book was not only the lens on the fascinating history of Che's life and especially the Cuban revolution, but the dozens of journal excerpts from Che. I mean what a deeply reflective thinker.
Who was this extraordinary man who gave up his privilege and everything he cherished and dedicated his life to an idea and died for it?
This is a great biography that gives him a historical context and brings him to life.Che is one of the most important and charismatic figures of the human struggle against injustice and oppression.
I think his idea of the "New socialist man" is his most important contribution to Marxist theory.
He dedicated his life to what he believed in and he ultimately died for it.

Extremely interesting biography of a very controversial man. I'm still not quite sure what to think of him, but I know considerably more about him. A side note: my used copy had annotations throughout the first 200 pages - entirely critical comments: 'bum', 'dumbass', etc. That is not the point of a biography, to confirm your own prejudices. It is to form a portrait of a man's life to analyze and learn from.
The rest, as they say, is history.Che's life is a story of a young man's search for fulfillment, eventual satisfaction, and an attempt to, for lack of better words, "chase that feeling." The success of Castro's revolution is truly a remarkable story.
I'm not sure what sure of this ultimate success can be apportioned to the leadership of Castro, Guevara, and others, but obviously a tremendous deal of luck was involved.Che spent the remainder of his life with the ambition to duplicate the Cuban revolution in his birthplace.
A great biography about a generally misunderstood figurehead. I have seen too much crap with Guevera's face on it; tees, bandanas, medallions, pencil holders, etc. His persona has been so commodifed it is important to understand who he was and what he represents. The book does not shy away from his dark moments; rape, murder, or his phenomenal ones; adrenaline shots into the heart, voluntary poverty. A fantastic book.
The book is about how these political ideologies spread in Latin America.
But Che had such devotion to his principles that his enthusiasm spreads and you understand why he does what he does, even if it all goes too far in the end.
You see in this book how people change and how they don’t change.
How wonderful ideals can get all messed up.I feel I know who Che Guevara is after reading this book.
Don’t ask me to write out their names because I cannot, but I did recognize who was who as I listened.You must know that Che was really called Ernesto.
This book was given me as a gift--an excellent one as the biography of Ernesto "Che" Guevara (b. Argentina 6/14/28–d. Bolivia 10/9/67) is not only well-researched but also balanced and very well-written. Although a cultural icon even in life, Che is presented realistically as the hopeful revolutionary he was--too radical and cosmopolitan, perhaps, to have lasted long as a Cuban administrator. One may not agree with his politics, but it is difficult not to admire the man's spirit.
I was sitting in the restaurant, waiting for my food when a twelve-year-old kid came in, wearing a Che Guevara shirt.
But what makes this book, and Che's life, so interesting, is the man himself: Che Guevara.
I'm thinking, for those who've read this work, his goal of many Vietnam-like wars, of personally provoking World War III, and his want of a global Marxist/communist government, thereby eradicating democracy, or capitalist imperialism.
I live in country where I'm allowed to read what I want, and think for myself, so I'm glad these things never came to pass.
When I picked the book in December last year, I said that I would like to know the man because I have been seeing his image printed on cool t-shirts since I was a kid.
I look forward to reading his other books like the one about the Fall of Baghdad that he wrote only a few years ago.Did I like Che Guevara as a person?
On the other hand, with your image printed on shirts being worn by young people even 40 years after your death, is it not an achievement enough?
After trying to research information about Che on the internet and from people around me I found that there is a large amount of propaganda from both Cuban's and American's that conflict with what people are told that this man was like.This books was thoroughly researched and showed both the great attributes of the man and the extreme views he held.
It was also interesting to read about Che as a father, husband and son because I think it is forgotten that those close to him seemed to have to accept that he was a revolutionary on behalf of Latin America first and a person second.
Excellent biography with great quotes and passages from Che himself and those close to him.
This is a hell of a book, both in length and content!
I enjoyed getting a clear and ample picture of such a mythologized human being.
Even as a Spanish major, I didn't hear very much about Che, other than that he wanted to be the new Bolivar and he was Castro's right-hand man.
Also, in USA, we tend to only hear about Che and Castro through the anti-Communist, Cold War Era lens.
I also learned a lot about communism and its implementation in various countries throughout the world.
It took me a while to get through, and I was getting tired around page 650 or so.
Exhaustive to say the least but if you have any questions about the life of this man, this book will answer them for you. I do get the impression that Guevara would hate just about everybody walking around the US with his picture on a t-shirt.
Che ve Küba tarihi hakkında okuma yapmak isteyenlerin diğer kaynaklara göre bulabilecekleri en tarafsız ve kapsamlı kitabın bu olacağını düşünüyorum.
"Cuba's revolutionaries clearly had not thought through the consequences of going for a complete break with the United States," Anderson writes, going on to describe the myriad problems that brought the island nation's economy to a grinding standstill: sulphuric Soviet petroleum that corroded the piping in American-built refineries, Soviet technicians unable to deal with modern American technology, and even metric Soviet tools that couldn't be used to fix American-built machines.Given these setbacks, it is little wonder Che lost patience with the life of the bureaucrat and sought to reprise his signal triumph by fomenting revolutions in the Congo and, later, Bolivia.
I decided to read this book in preparation for our holiday Cuba.
A great part of the book is dedicated to the Cuban revolution and to Che's role in Cuban politics and diplomacy.
The book also describes the relationship between Che and Fidel, which looked like a great friendship.
He didn't manage to do this, but his legacy was actually in Latin American politics of today, not regarding communism but the position towards the U.S.It was quite an experience for me to visit Che's Mausoleum in Santa Clara, Fidel's Comandancia in the Sierra Maestra, the Moncada barracks and see the Granma Yacht for real after reading about them.
8/20/09 I'm having difficulty posting an update - the browser/goodreads is stalling -- page 543 -  A hundred pages back I was beginning to feel a struggle -- too much information -- but, compared to the prismatic complexity of Rivers of Gold, and the encyclopedic excesses of Cuba and it's Music, this is a linear, remarkably thorough, coherent account of Geuvara' short life and his tremendous impact on the world.
What if indigenous Americans, or any other group decided to overthrow our government/personal property and way of life?
Ohhhh Im in deep love with my beloved Che...How brave he is..!!!How strong he is..!!!How determined he is...!!I was continously sobbing and reading his last words when Bolivian army executed him he said "I know you came here to kill me..shoot me coward you are killing only a man, you can not kill my ideas" ...
This is a best thing according to me.I love che's revolutionary..
I love his smile 🙊...Ohhh He was just an extraordinary handsome young brave man..
I haven't figured out why this guy is so lauded.
He is lauded as a brilliant and to a degree he had some good ideas however he wasn't smart enough to figure out Communism doesn't work.
Communism also won't work because too much choice and freedom has to be taken away, case in point, they eliminated studies at the university because they wouldn't benefit society as a whole.
All in all the book was extraordinarily researched if not overly long.
In the end I just didn't care about him enough to enjoy the book.
Of all the bios I have read this is undoubtedly the most expansive and comprehensive of the lot.
All that said, it's a smooth read.
The book is massive, and the minutia of early 60's Cuban/Soviet/American politics might bog you down near the middle, but not to worry, Che will soon be back to the jungles of the world trying to free the oppressed.
The book tells the story of a strong and amazing man, who believed all people deserved to be free from the yoke of imperialist tyranny.
Definitely worth a read.
Quoting the author on the last page of the epilogue..." Around the time Che's body was exhumed, a scrawl of graffiti in Spanish had appeared on the wall of the Vallegrande public telephone office.
This is his legacy.And the proof is, every time we witness a social movement or demonstration any where in the world, his ever famous portrait hangs HIGH.They tried so hard to smear his character but to no avail.
A man who profoundly believed in UNIVERSAL SOCIAL JUSTICE.
A man who believed that the individual by himself is worthless but being part of a successful society that had shared values and practiced social justice is PRICELESS.
Wow the end of an ERA. Okay first 400 pages breezed by but once I reached after the Cuban revolution the next 400 pages would be a rather weary road but I DID it and I learned so much abt the Cuban revolution and Marxist communism in the process
What I learned from this book (outside of some really great historical gems): 1) Journalists are important 2) As are Economists. Cuba could have benefited tremendously from the free operation of both. 3) Place and time matter for any revolutionary. Che could have benefited from acknowledging this.4) No one should want anyone to read their private diaries, because said diary scribe sounds like an a-hole. Sorry, Che. It's true.
Che was a naive narcissist who took more pride in his personal efforts of sacrifice than actually ever accomplishing anything good for anyone in his entire life.
Che era un narcisista ingenuo que se enorgullecía más de sus esfuerzos personales de sacrificio que en realidad lograr algo bueno para alguien en toda su vida.
Personalmente, para mí, lo que realmente quería al final era gobernar su país natal, Argentina.
Era un líder de culto que, si hubiera tenido éxito en América Latina, sería recordado con personajes como Hitler y Stalin.
