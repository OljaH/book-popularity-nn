It threw me a bit but Justin Cronin is a genius and it managed to work out.) It's strange though, because if you really think about it the original story line from The Passage was solely focused on government conspiracies and the creation of a virus that went completely wrong and was unleashed on the world after the virus was given to death-row-inmates.
I still don't get it.' Completely riveting story lines, complex and detailed to the max, but ultimately lacked in coming full circle and left me with far too many questions than answers.The City of Mirrors, the final installment, isn't due out for 2 years but I will of course be reading it.
Or because I’m such a sucker for post-apocalyptic stories?Actually, I now think that these books are like one of those B-level restaurants that you end up eating at all the time, but you don’t really know why.
(You know a book isn’t entertaining you much when you start daydreaming about watching Resident Evil movies instead of reading it.)I don’t know if it’s because of his background writing the Serious Lit-A-Chur (I haven’t read any of his other books.), but it felt like Cronin glumly slogged through this and that his pulse rate never jumped once.
Good 💕
3 to 3.5 stars - Not quite as good as the first one.A similar pattern - a strong, entertaining, and intriguing start that lasts for the first third of the book.
With the first book, this reconciled itself into a strong finish.
With this one I felt like he was making stuff up to move the story along.
Now, obviously fiction is making up a story, but there is a fine line between making up a believable tale or sounding like you are pulling random stuff out of thin air.
Book Two is more of the "thin air" variety to me.I sound kind of down on this book, but it was okay.
For some reason I thought this whole book was going to be about Peter and crew hunting down the big bad original TWELVE and smashing them. It's not really that at all. This book goes back to the first few days after the 'virus' has started. You have a guy known as "the Last Stand in Denver." I wanted more of this guy. But then you have a whole lot of new characters getting thrown into the story.You also get some extras in the form of:Ferrari chase: A sorta weird school bus storyline: And my very
To me this made the story of Cronin's world just come even more to life, in fact Saturday night I didn't sleep much because these damn Glow-worm Voldemort Blood suckers were in my dreams!
That's a test for me (even though I took Justin Cronin's name in vain several times.) If you make me dream about a book that means I'm really invested.
Even when I got ragey because these characters are just TOO FRIGGING LUCKY.too much of the whole coincidence thing happens in these books.

The thrust of this book is the hunt of the twelve by Amy, Alicia, Peter, and company."All eyes." Two words commonly spoken by the First Colony Watchers, starting in Book one--survivors of the end of the world as we know it.
From the benevolent but arch company of assembled defense forces in Kerrville, Texas; to a terrifying, totalitarian-ruled, labor camp in Iowa; and to a handful of scrappy iconoclasts that roam from place to place, the author's conception of a fractured world flashes and flickers with billion-kilowatt energy in every setting.Cronin's complex character development equals any realistic literary novel.
much like the first book, it includes a novella-sized chunk in its first section that is entirely devoted to events taking place in Year Zero, i.e. The Dawn of the Vampire Apocalypse.
more things i liked, later.Dislikes: Cronin reaches a bit much for poetry a couple times and it felt as if he was trying too hard - this came as a real surprise given the genuine beauty of much of The Passage - i reread the last paragraph of The Familiar and rolled my eyes because it unfortunately is reaching for beauty but was only so many pretty words on the page with little genuine meaning...
I think they were supposed to represent blood-sucking sequences, but since Cronin often shunned genre norms like using names or pronouns to let you figure out which of his several hundred characters was actually involved in a scene, it was sometimes awfully difficult to tell.The good news in The Twelve is that the first book in the series was enough of a bestseller that Cronin could apparently pay off his grad school debts and write a fat check to his old program to assuage any guilt he might be feeling for slumming in the mass market paperback section.
Y'know, the longer time goes by, the more I hate this book.
*edit* ACTUALLY, not only are there spoilers, but I realized as I typed how HOSTILE I was to a particular plot twist that was wholly unnecessary, pointless, and aggravatingly trite.
Yawn.We learn more about Grey (one of the only interesting characters from book 1, along with Carter, who gets a raw deal in these novels), and he coincidentally ends up with Lila Kyle, Wolgast's wife.
I really hated her.And Alicia, the baddest ass of any of the books, of COURSE must suffer her obligatory horrible continuing rapes.
I just think this one was even more absurd, actually.Alicia's rape really did me in.
The trilogy was concluded with the publishing of The City of Mirrors, which was released in 2016.
The Twelve has been optioned by director Ridley Scott along with the other two books in the trilogy for a planned series of film adaptations.

If only King had done that with The Stand--I'm going to write him right now and suggest it.***************************************************The trouble is that despite being a clever writing concept, I think The Twelve could have benefited from focus on character creation, since we knew where much of the plot was going (especially as the introduction helpfully reminded us).
I felt like I was being told a Just So story, my absolute least favorite type of storytelling, particularly as it includes heavy moralizing.Plus--ranty bit--just like King in The Stand, Cronin does a huge disservice to the female viewpoint.
Cronin’s first book in this trilogy, The Passage, received a lot of buzz.
The trilogy tells the story of an engineered virus that creates a race of vampires – “Virals” – which almost wipe out humanity.
The reader does have to have some patience, as Cronin tells the story in several parts that at first seem only loosely connected.
Just when you are completely riveted in the story of the outbreak, he flashes forward seventy-nine years, where you have to learn to care about a whole new set of characters in an entirely different situation.
I literally could not put down the book; I raced to finish it before we landed.
I had no idea the book was going to be left open to a sequel and as I finished the last page I thought NO I have to know what is going to happen next.
I cannot wait to read the second book-for several reasons I think The Passage was one of, if not the best, post apocalyptic books ever written and I am crossing my fingers that any kinks the first book had will be worked out in the second installment.

Oh. My. God.There are books and there are BOOKS. There is writing and there is WRITING.This was brilliant.I find myself at a lack of words to describe how amazing the whole series is.I actually shook my head in disbelief while I was reading certain parts because I couldn’t believe the epicness.
I loved, well most, of The Passage, the first book of this trilogy.
Enough I almost rated it five stars, although I pulled back from that because although I thought the author did some amazing things, I couldn't call it a true favorite.
And those are the characters I cared about: Lish, Michael, Peter, Sara.So imagine how I felt when at the opening of this book I found myself plunged back into the territory covered in the first few hundred pages of The Passage and wondering when if ever I'd see the characters I cared about again.
I did like a few things.
2.5 stars.I really wanted to be one of the readers who actually liked the second book in this trilogy.
I thoroughly enjoyed the first.
My determination to love the second book started to falter at 50% , limp at 60% and stutter at 70%.
The first half held my interest well but then...The content became overly military and there wasn't enough about the virals themselves.
I realised I didn't feel invested.
In the end I felt like I was making myself continue, like a rather tedious piece of homework.I'm on holiday at the moment and really have no desire to feel like that so I speed read to the end.
This time we have a whole lot of new characters to read about as they struggle to survive in this nightmarish world of virals.One of my biggest issues with The Passage is the same issue I’ve had with this book; which is the fact that I really struggled to keep the characters in order.
While in The Twelve the characters seem to travel more as a big group so I didn’t feel like I needed a map and little figures to move around like a war map just to keep track of everyone.I love the post apocalyptic world the Justin Cronin has created and I found so much joy in returning to the world.
Amy was an interesting character in the The Passage but she was dull in this — all she cared about was the men in her life - Wolgast, Peter, the Twelve..ugh.-I hated Lila, she was selfish, insufferable and horrid.
I think the author was trying to portray Lila as mentally ill but I didn't believe it - her POV convinced me that she just felt sorry for herself and instead of facing up to things she chose to take the easy route and pretend everything was okay.-Guilder was an awful character, he had no depth whatsoever - making characters have mummy, daddy and whore issues doesn't magically give a character a personality.-I loathed the way the main female characters were portrayed: -Amy, the girl with the super speshul powers and the one that was meant to save everyone was a nun/babysitter for most of the book - Why wasn't she a soldier with all her powers?
2012???? NOOOOO!!!! I can't wait that long! I loved the first one, and now I really want to know what happens next!
(This is from an older post from 2010 on io9.com.)The next two books each go back to Year Zero at the outset, to reset the story, and to deal with something you didn't see and didn't know was as important as it was.
The author provides a lot more information about what happened to various people at the very beginning, explaining how some of the communities were formed, the horrific actions of the USA government (including events like "The Field"), and other parts of the novel jump around up to 97 years from when the virus originally took hold.
"I am going away. The girl you know will not be here next we meet."Reading this second installation in Justin Cronin The Passage TrilogyI literally felt like I transformed from one thing to the next during this read. I'm not going to lie, if you thought the first book had you dizzy, wait till you read this one.I think the most frustrating part for me was the multiple POV. Just when I start to sink my teeth into a particular plot, the author would switch POV and have me like: Don't get me wrong,
I'm not going to lie, if you thought the first book had you dizzy, wait till you read this one.I think the most frustrating part for me was the multiple POV.
With all the different POV's couple with the information overload the author gives during this hefty book, made me so frustrated (at times) that I was almost ( yes almost ) tempted to rest it down.
The last quarter of the book was mind blowing and I'm pretty certain my son thought I abandoned him because of how enthralled I was : ))Can't wait to see how this all ends.
4 "epic, grand and exciting" starsI very much enjoyed the "The Passage" (3.5 stars) but Mr. Cronin created something much grander in this sequel.
He was able to tighten things up and have the plot become logical and clear with an exciting arc that led to a thrilling conclusion.This dystopian apocalyptic trilogy has so many interesting and fascinating intersections that leave the reader amazed, fascinated and chilled to the bone.
My one concern is that at times it became too hollywoodesque and this detracted from what could have been a masterpiece of a novel.I very much look forward to Book 3 of this trilogy.
Fans of The Passage can rest assured that this second installment is a vital addition, smoothly continuing the epic Cronin started with book one.
(view spoiler)[Really special about this second book in particular is his imagining of “degrees” of vampirism.
(hide spoiler)]The story is especially engrossing during well-imagined action sequences involving the virals and those scenes dominated by a three-dimensional villain readers will love to hate.
(hide spoiler)]Cronin upped the ante in this second book; The Twelve is perhaps more disturbing and violent than The Passage.
Final verdict: A worthy second book in the trilogy that fans of The Passage can get excited about.
"Dvanaestoricu" sam čekala pune 2 godine i krajnji utisak bi mogao da se svede na "meh".Sam početak, tačnije prvih 100-200 strana mi se čini kao da je autor bio inspirisan, ili da je barem bio pod utiskom, Kingovog Utočišta.Prikazi uništene zemlje, ta postapokaliptična slika sveta, otuđenost, i naravno inspirativne priče o hrabrim ljudima koji uprkos svemu guraju napred...kao što rekoh - meh :/Prosto ne znam šta se desilo Kroninu u drugoj polovini knjige, kao da je i sam pogubio konce.
Zanimljivo povezivanje nekolicine glavnih aktera, naravno sve dok to ne ode previše u patetiku.
Αν το πρώτο μ άρεσε, για το δεύτερο τι να πρωτοπώ!Αν και στην αρχή με κούρασε κάπως (ίσως γιατί περίμενα να δω τη συνέχεια και ξαφνικά ξεκινάει με άλλες ιστορίες, χρόνια πριν από εκεί που μας είχε αφήσει το πρώτο), από ένα σημείο και μετά το βιβλίο απογειώνεται!
Μπορεί κάποια κομμάτια στην αρχή να μην είναι ακριβώς συνέχεια αλλά από ένα σημείο και μετά, πρέπει να έχει διαβάσει το πρώτο.Αυτό που παρατήρησα είναι ότι έχει κάποια κλισέ (όπως και το πρώτο) και σε κάποια σημεία έρχονται βολικά τα πράγματα, αλλά καταλαβαίνω ότι κάπου έπρεπε να πατήσει για να συνεχίσει τη ροή, οπότε προσωπικά δε με ενόχλησε.
There has to be other reasons and motivation for women to become badass!!(5) Even when women actually have power, still women cannot (i) become leaders, (ii) take control of their lives, (iii) care about things outside of their men, families and babies.Give me a break.Look at Amy, a young girl with supernatural power and the mystic connection with the vampires, has she joined the army and fight?
(hide spoiler)]Look at Lila, another woman with mystic connection with the vampires and she can control an army of vampires to do her bidding at will.
The Kindle edition is currently $1.31 in the States and £0.99p in the UK.
The book time shifts back and forth and it can exhausting keeping all the characters straight.
Keep in mind that the past characters generally don't matter.
Most of their stories don't continue on (even though I'd love to have known the rest of their stories).
A large section of the book focuses on 4 different groups during the early days of the viral plague.
Most of the book does continue on with Amy and the rest of her friends from the Colony.
The book ends in an entirely different direction than I expected and the series probably could have just ended here.
Thank you, Justin Cronin, for providing a summary of The Passage in the prologue! Wish I had known about the list of characters at the end though. Would have come in handy :) My full review is here.
