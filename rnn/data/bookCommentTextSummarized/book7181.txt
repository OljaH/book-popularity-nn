So, desperately, unwilling to crack a smile lest the Castle feel itself mocked, they eke out some tenuous thread of analysis and miss the sacredness, AKA the humour.In speaking of Kafka, Milan Kundera quotes Czech poet Jan Skacel: Poets don’t invent poems The poem is somewhere behind It’s been there for a long time The poet merely discovers itHe goes on to say:Indeed, if instead of seeking “the poem” hidden “somewhere behind” the poet “engages” himself to the service of a truth known from the outset...

× فرانتس کافکا، نه یک کلمه بیشتر، نه یک کلمه کمتر ×گفتم، همان اول کار گفتم که نوشتن داستان کوتاه کار من نیست. این هنر بزرگ را کافکا داشت... . محمود دولتآبادیفرانتس! فازت چیه؟نوشتههای کافکا(داستان؟) از چهار منظرِ کلی، قابل تأویلهیک. قصههای من و بابام: تمرکز بر رابطهی دهشتناکِ کافکا کوچولو و پدرِ لولو. تأویل فرویدی با برخی داستانهای کافکا، مخصوصاً «حُکم» و «محاکمه»، خیلی خوب چِفت میشه. امروزه، «آلن دوباتن» از طرفداران این تفسیره و «موراکامی» در «کافکا در کرانه» این موضوع رو دستآویز کردهدو. سوسیالی
واقعیت این هست که بجز رمان‌های «محاکمه»، «قصر» و یکی دوتا داستانِ کوتاهِ خوبش، مثل لانه، بقیه‌ی آثار درست و حسابی کافکا زمان حیاتش منتشر شد و در زمان خودش، به اندازه‌ی یک نویسنده‌ی اتریشی، شناخته‌شده بودیک‌و‌نیم: قسمت زیادی از گمنامی و بعد هم شهرت کافکا، دو دلیل عمده داشت: یک، کافکا گرایش‌های کمرنگ سوسیالیستی داشته( سوسیالیست تجربی!) دو، یهودی بوده و خانواده‌اش هم به دست نازی‌ها کشته شدن؛ به عبارت‌دیگه غالب گمنامی و شهرت کافکا به دلایل غیرادبی بوده!
کافکا مذهبی نبوده: بله، مذهبی به معنای رایج کلمه_مثل داستایفسکی‌ که نویسنده‌ای عمیقاً مذهبی‌ست_ نبوده اما ظاهراً موضوعات مذهبی براش خیلی جذاب بوده، این از تأملاتش بر اسفار خمسه(پنج کتاب اول تورات) کاملاً مشخصه و البته سعی‌ در آموختن زبان عِبری هم، در اواخر عمرش، قابل توجههچهار.
Con esto quiero decir que el lector comprende la obra hasta donde su nivel de razonamiento le permite, y no solo eso, sino que asimismo el lector puede tener una interpretación muy distinta de la de otro y a su vez pueden ser ambas correctas.
Y es más que eso, puesto que cuando una persona lee un trabajo brillante pero este se transmite de manera evidente, esa persona lo va a comprender llanamente y va a pasar a manejar un conocimiento brillante que probablemente jamás se le hubiera ocurrido, y un individuo así, con un intelecto armado y que lo supera, contaminado por el de alguien ajeno, se transformaría en una clase de recipiente sin deducción, un simple huésped de un parásito, que actúa sin identidad.
“Around me things sink away like fallen snow, whereas for other people even a little liqueur glass stands on the table steady as a statue.”  4.5 stars.There are stories in this collection (and these were by far my favorite kind) that clutch and fumble and scrabble across the surface of your mind, entities so eerily misshapen and askew that you don’t want to let them in. Grimacing and winking, they slither in anyway. Before you know it, everything you thought solid and real begins to fall away.
Kafka dexterously peeled back this façade, stripping away our familiar, comforting lies and deceptions; they’re scattered pitifully over the floor, where their glaring inadequacy is impossible to deny.
.Overall, reading Kafka kind of feels like taking a trip along a Möbius strip.
So too with Kafka: you feel off-balance, bewildered and queasy by the crumpled deformities you encounter as you travel through a gnarled, grotesque landscape, but there’s something strangely familiar underneath it all, something you can’t quite put your finger on.Then you end up exactly where you began, and you finally understand your journey.
But that's just me.I liked most of his stories, a few names come to mind (I don't know why and in no specific order): “A Hunger Artist”, a disturbing yet beautiful story about an alienated artist; “In the Penal Colony”; “Eleven sons” and its poetic descriptions; “A dream” (loved its disquieting atmosphere --is that making sense?); “The Great Wall of China”; “A Report to an Academy” (fresh air); “The Problem of Our Laws” that gives you a feeling of despair, because you find yourself being governed by people (noble people) you'll never meet with their rules that you're not supposed to understand; “A Fratricide” (kind of shocked me); "The Cares of a Family Man", short stories like that leave you thinking about what the heck he was writing about.Kafka is a complicated writer, that's true.
The Old Man in the Woods  Or  The Monkeys by fire  We monkeys have sat by this ever-burning fire for generations because we are afraid to go outside the perimeter of its light into the dark. Although we have tried to look beyond into the darkness everyday hoping to find something; yet all of us are afraid to step out. And this fear is not baseless, for whoever has entered the darkness has never returned. Thus this fire has a very central role to play in our lives. It has been there for as long
Kind of makes you feel like you are in a classroom where teacher has gone out on an errand and will punish in-disciplined souls on return!Another faction H tells you that there are more than one old man out there - It is again a monkey thing to do, to go out looking for many where you haven’t yet found one.And all these factions along with many others have each have at least one leave of its own.
Kafka's stories are smart, often funny, quick to read, and as modern and relevant as ever.In the bathroom you'll probably bypass the larger works (including The Metamorphosis) and discover his short-shorts.
Kafka was a master of the form, but they are too short to use as an essay subject in high school, so too many people don't read them.When you've adjusted to Kafka as an absurdist who actually likes people, then re-read The Metamorphosis (and finish it this time--it ends on an "up" note, much to most peoples' surprise) and strike out into The Hunger Artist, The Penal Colony, and the rest.
Treat this is a collection of fun, short, absurd, witty stories and forget everything your high school english teacher told you.
Compilación de cuentos cortos geniales escritos por el aún más genial Franz Kafka.
Cuentos cortos que dan para más de una interpretación.
Lo que admiro de este gran señor es la posibilidad que le da al lector de crear sus propias ideas a partir de lo que él escribe, hace que el lector piense y cree su propio escenario, Kafka no da todo "en bandeja".Lo más difícil de todo siempre es entender los cuentos de Kafka, quizás es muy criticado por eso.
Para los que no entienden los cuentos de Kafka, les recomiendo leer la biografía.¿Recomendado?
I first bought this in 2009, in an edition where Vintage had removed the full stops from the text in error, or to lure me into some Kakfaesque trap.
Thanks, Vintage!
I parked the stories for a long time, until this moment in time, when I revisited the most terrifying story in the universe, ‘The Metamorphosis’, the most horrific and significant story in the universe ‘Inside the Penal Colony’, the breathtaking debut ‘Description of a Struggle’, the claustrophobic mindbender ‘The Burrow’, the excruciatingly tedious ‘Investigations of a Dog’, and the bountiful sequence of short fables, sketches, and oddities, separated here into stories published and unpublished in his lifetime by Gabriel Josipovici, with full stops reinstated.
The recent so-called scandalous revelations about Kafka's personal library (as if -- turns out he read a slightly edgy quarterly of arts & literature) prompt me to say something about his work.
More intense distillations are served, as well, in what would come to be called "flash-fic." But even at the length of a couple of pages or less, Kafka generates blinking terror & breathtaking cultural reach, in the bloody labyrinth of "A Country Doctor" or the heady blind alley of "On Parables." At every length, more's the astonishment, the rhetoric's perfectly modulated, with every correlation & description & thought given just the development, the finish, needed to serve the vision in play.
I love the way Kafka describes settings.
I’ll have to come back to them later: “Investigations of a Dog” and “The Burrow.” These read more like essays than stories and I’m holding on to them for a day when I get a Kafka craving.
His stories make you laugh or react in some surface way, then something grows inside the back of your mind and a double meaning invades.
A good story idea: religious guy drops to give God thanks and dies of a spider-bite.
I can’t wait to read the novels and all his nonfiction.
Probably most readable, rhythmic and rounded among these tales, so much so that I forced my brother to listen to me reading it aloud to him, is The Great Wall of China, which contains the immortal parable of the messenger.Kafka's tales are oblique, frequently, I think, resisting reading in terms of established philosophical or ideological positions.
Their psychological resonance is immense, even when it's difficult to pin a definitive meaning to the action, to divine the motivations of the characters, or to suck out an aphorism.
Investigations of a Dog is another of my favourites, interrogating, indirectly but with keen clear sight, unspoken anxieties and motivations behind social habits, and perhaps religious practices.I have a theory that every honest reader will find themselves (uncomfortably, of course) in Kafka.
این کتاب همه داستان ها و دستنوشته های کافکا به جز 3 رمان او را شامل می شود .کلا خیلی اضطراب اور و مشوش کننده است داستانهاش .
بعد از خوندنشون ادم هنوز ذهنش درگیر و مشوش هست .راستش من از خیلی از داستانهاش سر در نمی اوردم و بعضی هاش هم که نصفه بود .......
ظاهرا اکثر کارهای کافکا نیمه کاره بوده و وصیت کرده بوده بعد از مرگش نابود بشوند که دوستش به این وصیت عمل نمی کنه .اما بعضی از داستان ها هم خیلی قشنگ بود .
اما کاملا ادم را اشفته می کنه داستان هاش نمی دونم چرا .
Every story is different, but each one takes you to a different world, or an alternative view of one we are in (and perhaps wish we weren't). Some are funny, some sad and many are both. Some are so short they are more like prose poems. Great for dipping into and getting a taste of Kafka before (and during and after) tackling his larger works.See my Kafka-related bookshelf for other works by and about Kafka (http://www.goodreads.com/review/list/...).
And of course you can find all of that here—the stereotypes have an ample foundation in reality.What I didn’t anticipate, though, was the heart—the tenderness with which Kafka regards even (or maybe especially) his most ridiculous and self-defeating characters: the pointlessly dueling pairs in “A Little Woman” and “The Village Schoolmaster,” the lonely and pathetic tunnel-dweller in “The Burrow,” the self-absorbed rodent diva in “Josephine the Singer.” I was primed to expect a little humor, of a pitch-black and cynical kind, but not the snort-out-loud silliness of the creature Odradek in “The Cares of a Family Man” or the self-parodying pessimism of “Reflections for Gentleman-Jockeys.” And whatever I’ve come to expect from the nowadays-largely-predictable and uninspired genre we call “magical realism,” it has little to do with the almost-alien dreaminess of the imagery and atmosphere on display through nearly every story of this collection.Don’t get me wrong—Kafka does give us plenty of fear and isolation and failure to communicate and needless cruelty and all those other Kafkaesque buzzwords.
So I asked myself when I took this book of the shelf a couple of months ago, "Why read this book of stories for the third time?" I can't think of another collection of short stories I've read cover-to-cover more than twice.
This collection includes everything that exists from Kafka's pen, with the exception of his three unfinished novels.I don't think that Kafka is the best short story writer.
But after reading his stories for the third time, I think I've realized why I like him so much.
I can't believe I haven't rated this one yet. This is where you go to find Kafka, even more so than his unfinished novels. Though the Trial is magnificent, the short stories are where his genius is most evident. Depths and depths to plumb here. Leagues beyond most other writers.
Some, I would assume, early, over-long stories here. My issue with Kafka, which I don't have with The Castle, is that everything comes across as a minimalistic intellectual exercise, the themes repeated endlessly, the characters mere vehicles.
Therefore, I don't claim I liked all stories in this book, in other words, I have had my own preferences and, according to Max Brod, his close friend and biographer, Kafka didn't wanted the remaining stories published and told him to burn them after his death.
To illustrate my point, I would list only five of his unpublished stories in his lifetime in each group:The Longer Stories- Description of a Struggle- Wedding Preparations in the Country- The Village Schoolmaster (The Giant Mole)- Blumfeld, an Elderly Bachelor- The Warden of the TombThe Shorter Stories- The Bridge- The Bucket Rider- The Knock at the Manor Gate- My Neighbor- A Crossbreed [A Sport]Among his stories in this collection, their unpredictability of the lengthy as mentioned above has posed a problem.
مجموعه داستان های کوتاه کافکا حاوی عادی گراییِ خالی از سانتی مانتالیسم یا بی رحمانه شخصیت هایی است که به صورت معکوس بیشتر ازابتدا، از اندیشه های فابل(fabula) به پیچیده ترین شکل ممکن نوشته شده است.
تنهایی من از دیگران نبود ازخودم بود و بس." از دروغ ها گله مند است و مرگ را طبیعی تر معمول تر از آنچه می نماید که انسان های بیرون در مواجهه با آن عکس العمل های جنون آمیز نشان می دهند و خود را به زندگی متعلق می دانند.
Most people's exposure to Kafka consists entirely of "The Metamorphosis", which is a shame, for while that story is indeed a classic, it has led to a somewhat unfair pigeonholing of Kafka as a lonely, disillusioned Oedipal case with a penchant for bleak imagery (hence the adjective Kafkaesque).
But while Kafka certainly is all of those things, he is also much more, and this collection is a brilliant portrait of that.Some of the best moments in the collection come from Kafka letting out his playful, childish side, as in "Blumfeld, an Elderly Bachelor", which follows the frustrations of a perplexed old man who suddenly finds himself sharing an apartment with two mysterious bouncing balls.
Neke Kafkine priče su frustrirajuće i teško ih je završiti do kraja, ali dobre priče su toliko dobre da postanu nezaboravne, i baš zbog njih dajem ovoj knjizi pet zvezdica.Favoriti: Preobražaj, U kažnjeničkoj koloniji, Jazbina, Izveštaj jednoj akademiji, Umetnik u gladovanju, Posejdon, Jastreb
No obstante, Kafka fue, como todo el mundo, hijo de su tiempo, los textos obsesivos y reiterativos se habían empezado a poner de moda en Europa ya entonces, como símbolo de la mecanicidad y superficialidad de la vida cotidiana, hecho que autores como Céline poco después también usaría, o más recientemente Thomas Bernhard o Javier Marías.El estilo onírico brilla con luz propia, el que intenta imitar a la burocracia no tanto, se le tolera, se le respeta y se le valora por la importancia que tuvo, pero simplemente no emociona, e incluso, a veces, no interesa.
As a reader I am repeatedly wishing beyond wishing that he had expanded, developed, and completed more of the stories and fragments that he left behind, even if he did not expect or desire them to be published.
But then there are also stories like "A Little Woman," "A Country Doctor," the famous "Metamorphosis," and probably my favorite, "The Judgment," along with several others, which really begin to communicate Kafka's inner self in a moving way.
Other readers will surely find other stories to be their favorites, a further testament to his work.
سبك نگارش كافكا نه بر كسي پوشيده است و نه به نحوي ست كه بشود با حفظ تمام هنرمندي هاي او، براي كسي توضيحش داد.
شايد بتوان گفت در كنار مسخ، در سرزمين مردگان، هنرمند گرسنگي، يوزفينه ي آوازه خوان، شرح يك نبرد، ديوار چين، پژوهش هاي يك سگ، او، و نقب از ديگر شاهكارهاي كافكا در اين كتاب بودند.
ترجمه ي اين كتاب نيز كه توسط آقاي حداد انجام گرفته ( برخلاف بعضي مترجمين آثار كافكا) بسيار روان و دلچسب بود و مشوقي براي خواننده ست كه به خواندن كتاب ادامه دهد .
Desde su primer libro de relatos, "Contemplación", pasando por "La Metamorfosis" y todos los relatos póstumos que legó el genio incomparable de Franz Kafka a la literatura universal, pueden leerse en este libro imprescindible que nos lleva a perdernos en los dilemas y laberintos, en las maravillosas paradojas kafkianas que disparan múltiples interpretaciones como si fueran rizomas. Imperdible
