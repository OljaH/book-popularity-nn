This is the first book of the series featuring criminal defense attorney Perry Mason and his gang: his secretary Della Street and a private detective Paul Drake whose services Mason uses quite often.
It turned out she was right as the woman in question did everything she could to personally involve Mason in her problems hoping he would be better motivated to help himself and by extension her.As I mentioned already this is the first book of the series and as such the main characters are not as developed as in the later books and some of the regulars are not mentioned at all.
I recently read a short story in The Black Lizard Big Book of Pulps by ESG.
This book differs from later Mason in that there is no courtroom scene where Perry's cross examination provides the revelations necessary to solve the case, although Perry in effect cross exams a few people in the course of investigating the case.
One wonders why someone would allow themselves to be cross examined voluntarily while not in court and perhaps that is one of the reasons ESG later made the courtroom the scene of much of the dialogue.
I was able to decipher this because he was the protagonist of the book.
But in the long run, when you look at the characters and they look more 'people' than 'characters', it helps attaching to the story.
(I think this is the difference between other crime writers and Agatha Christie.)On the other hand, the plot was too good, the writing was good enough, and finally the protagonist was not a detective (professional or amateur), but a lawyer, which was a change for the good.
This is definitely the first of Gardner's Perry Mason novels, since at the end it refers to his next client as a "sulky girl" (see my review of "The Case Of The Sulky Girl"), and his writing is that of a beginning novelist.
The story was good although readers under 35 may be puzzled by phrases such as "nix on that hooey" or actions like starting a car by stepping on the starter (this book was written in 1933 and is set in that period).
(Not to mention he smokes like a locomotive).
The Case of the Velvet Clawswas first published in 1933.It my have been a hard boiledcontemporary story in its daybut today it's a little campy.I enjoyed the campiness andthe characters in the story.My favorite was Sassy,27 year old Della Streetwith pencil and pad in hand.Monotone speaking, self assuredPerry Mason was my second favorite.Listened with text to speech.I have changed the foul wordsin pronunciation to tame words.Makes a much more pleasant listenClean except for mild Foul Language.
Of course I couldn't spend the time I wanted to thinking about making choices, cause the pharmacist would wander over after about ten minutes and say, 'Can I help you find something?", with an inflection in his voice that said, 'you need to buy something or get your ass out of here.'Well I liked those racks, you could spin them around and on one side you would have science fiction books, on another westerns and on another mysteries.
Cause this is the first Perry Mason book I've read and I thought maybe you needed some background as to why.
Very much enjoyed this book. One glaring error that a good copy editor should have picked up. It didn't affect the story at all, but took me out of the moment.I've read other Perry Mason's, but a long time ago. I'm definitely going to seek more of them out!
This book was so amazing!!! *_*
Well, so, I've never read (as opposed to have seen) Perry Mason before, so I decided to start at the beginning. And it seemed to be fairly pedestrian and tootling towards a somewhat obvious (with admittedly a few twists and turns) conclusion, but there are forty some pages left. When all of a sudden. . . Da da daaaaaa da DUMP! Holey moley, where did that come from? Da da daaaaaaa da DUMP! Wowzers, never saw that one coming!Sign me up, boys. I think I have a new series to make my way through.
The Case of the Velvet Claws by Erle Stanley Gardner is the first Perry Mason book.Perry Mason takes on a case of blackmail involving a sleazy paper and ends up defending his deceiving client of murder. I read this book a long time ago and decided to start from the beginning with Audible. I loved revisiting this series and thought the narrator did a wonderful job in bringing the characters to life. Although a bit dated now, it is still an intriguing and captivating mystery. I'm looking forward to continuing the series again.
His timing and mannerisms are spot on.The characters are realistic and give readers/listeners a look back at how life was during this era.
If you’re a fan of the TV Perry Mason, you may be a little surprised at the character revealed in this first installment in the series.
Here Mason comes off more as a bit more hands on than he does in later stories.With a blend of murder, suspense, and colorful characters this story has twists and turns to hold your attention.FTC Full Disclosure – A copy of this audio book was sent to me by the publisher.
This is the first book in the Perry Mason series.
I've already read a few of these stories, but I thought it would be worth starting at the beginning of the series and reading a few more of these classics.
For as old as they are, they are entertaining, fast reads.
They have an old-fashioned charm to them; Mr. Mason is able to operate with such an anonymity and recklessness that would be more difficult in today's age.
The story has a few plot twists and turns and it definitely kept my interest.
I'll certainly look for more of his stories at our local library.
A very interesting case.
Though I felt that Mr Gardner deliberately made it extra difficult.
It maybe in order to show that the truth is immaterial.
It is the skill of the lawyer that gets the verdict.
So he has Mason show both sides here.
Very skilfully done.In order to do that though, he went a little in-congruent in his portrayal of Della Street..
That's what I felt...
But then, it is his first case in book form.
Maybe that is why I felt things amiss (having read the further cases first).His portrait of Eva Griffin/Belter was very good.
A woman visits lawyer Perry Mason using the name Eva Griffin and asking for help because Spicy Bits, a scandal sheet known to be a conduit for blackmail is trying to shake her down.
Perry follows the trail of Spicy Bits to its secret owner, a man considered to be a respectable member of society.
She is Perry’s client, named not Eva Griffin but Eva Belter.
Back at his office, Perry interrogates Mrs. Belter, exposing every statement of hers to him as a lie.Read the rest of this review and other fun, geeky articles at Fangirl Nation
المعتاد من بيري ميسون الفارق أن هذه الرواية الظهور الأول له
What I did not know at the time I bought this book was that it's the very first Perry Mason mystery.
Perry is harder and more willing to get his hands dirty in order to serve the interests of his client.
He's willing to blackmail and create false leads in order to get what he wants, all in the interest of the client.That brings us to Eva Griffin.
The advertiser would then have a say in what was printed.When Eva's husband is found shot through the heart, she quickly comes up with a scheme to get her name out of it.
***.This was the first installment in Gardner’s Perry Mason series, and was sufficiently well received by the reading public to encourage him to keep on with his newly created hero.
We do get to meet some of his sidekicks, though, who also matured through subsequent episodes, but were initially less developed as series characters.
She was much more sultry to begin with, and seemed an easy pick-up for Mason as well as an excellent secretary.
Although this was a particularly outstanding entry into a new series, it is still worthwhile to do so to pick up on the starting point for Mason and his crew.
أهم قاعدة في الكتب بشكل عام والروايات البوليسية بشكل خاص إنهاتخلي القارئ متشوق على طول إنه يقلب الصفحة الجاية ويبقى مهتم فعلا يعرف ايه اللي حصل بعد كدة، وده اللي محصلش ولا مرة مع الرواية دي؛ اللي خلصتها لمجرد اني مش من هواة عدم استكمال حاجة بدأتها، وده بيطرح قدامنا احتمالين:1- إن الترجمة كانت سيئة جدا والمترجم فشل بجدارة إنه يوصل للقارئ نفس التأثير اللي وصله الكاتب الأصلي لقراؤه، بدليل إن كتير من قراء الرواية الأصلية بيشيدو بيها 2- إن أنا قريت الرواية متأخر بتاع عشرين سنة كدة، ويمكن لو كانت وصلتني وأنا في ابتدائي مثلا كانت عجبتني
Perry Mason is my guilty pleasure. The plot is basically the same in all the books. An underdog ( usually a beautiful woman) is wrongly framed of a murder. Perry Mason swoops in, messes around with the evidence, has a few run ins with the DA and in the end does something outrageous in the courtroom winning the case. Usually ends the novel flirting with his secretary Della Street. LOVE it!! :)
It was entertaining to read a novel that was written more than a hundred years ago and was also cleaned up for a 1950s TV audience. Quite apart from the recognizable name, I believe this novel is written well enough to be considered a classic. I would recommend it to any one that enjoys mysteries, and can accept that Perry Mason was written to be a man of his time--not ours.
This book represents the entire following collection. The Perry Mason novels were well structured and ahead of their time.
He certainly shines in a different light in this one than he does in his latter ones.For starters, in book number one Perry Mason is a no-holds-barred, double-crossing kind of shyster lawyer who knows all the tricks about practicing law and isn't afraid to dance with the worst of the worst.
Frankly, this Perry Mason makes the definition of 'shyster-lawyer'come alive.And oddly .
I liked it.But a warning; Erle Stanley Gardner, in this first novel, is not a polished writer.
Just remember, you are reading a novel from out of the 1930's.
The first of the famed Perry Mason series is enjoyable provided you allow for the 1930's setting, social times, relationships between men & women, bosses and secretaries, etc.
Today's world makes it a bit anachronistic, but take it for what it is/was, and you can have a fun read with a well drawn plot and good pacing.I remember watching some of the TV shows as a kid and had to avoid imaging Raymond Burr as I read, but otherwise, found Mason's character to be pretty true to form.Don't know if the later books in the series improved greatly from here, but I must admit to feeling no great compulsion to read many more of these.
Scritto nel 1933, è il primo della serie di 91. Un "giallo" eccellente, secco e stringato, con un ritmo serrato, senza gli orpelli soap che vanno di moda nelle analoghe opere di oggi in cui spesso il fumo prevale sull'arrosto. Vi compare un Perry Mason d'assalto e che non disdegna il contatto fisico violento, ben diverso da quello dei memorabili telefilm degli anni '60 dove il nostro era più che altro un distinto avvocato poco incline all'azione ed abilissimo nell'aula dei tribunali.
A well-paced whodunnit (and why, implied) mystery that keeps you on the edge of your seat until the last few pages.Definitely not my last Perry Mason.
One down...how many more to go in this series 😁
For all of us who think of Perry Mason as the upright attorney portrayed by Raymond Burr on television, to encounter this Mason is a surprise.
In this first Mason novel, he feels like a lawyer created by Dashiell Hammett.
While committed to giving his clients effective representation, he is a bulldog investigator as well.
In fact, some of the work he would give to Paul Drake in the TV series he handles himself here.
Mason must represent his shady client while proving his own innocence.
Full of tough-guy talk and pulpy action, this fun read makes me want to read the other Perry Mason novels soon.
I have always heard about "Perry Mason" from my grandparents and parents and how great a series it was.
My journey with Perry Mason begins with this book, the first in the series.
This book introduces a character written in 1930s to a reader in 2015 and packs the punch of same intensity now as it did then.
Though Perry Mason is a lawyer, he is clearly a sleuth in the hunt for the truth AND using his devious mind to uncover pure evidence that would make his case stick in a court of law.
A slinky dame strolls into Perry’s office, and this first Mason novel sets off in the approved old-fashioned-PI tradition.
One of the best things about “going to the source” is that you get to find out lots of wonderful things about favorite, and (thought to be) well-known characters.
I’d known that he was meant to be a bit more athletic than Raymond Burr could be in the 1950s, but not that his physicality was such a big part of the story, at least in this first novel.
Twisty-good, but a bit cute in spots - doesn’t really play fair with the clues, but then that’s the point in a Mason story, isn’t it?
No doubt the book is interesting.
Perry Mason's character builds a firm foundation in this first book.
The story is very interesting and it kept me on the edge, and very eager to read what comes up next.
The pace was excellent too.On the downside, it was unnecessarily dramatic in parts like where Della acccuses Mason on not protecting his client.
It seemed far fetched to me.I missed the courtroom scenes in this one but that's perhaps because I am not reading the Perry Mason books in the order in which they were published.
