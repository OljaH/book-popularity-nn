Let’s go!”Asimov’s collection of short stories is a stunning document of humanity’s struggle to find balance in a world increasingly dominated by technological progress, but with the same social, political and emotional conflicts as always.At first glance, the different stories seem to show the growing sophistication of robots, and their integration in human society.
And it is more and more complicated to solve the resulting issues from story to story.The first, apparently innocent sequence features a girl who becomes dependent on her toy robot, and refuses to interact with humans and animals as a result.
The book consists of futuristic robot short stories recounted by Susan Calvin (robot psychologist) in retrospect. Even though the reader could read the short stories quite well, they unfortunately dont created tension at all. On the one hand, the writing style seems a little bit outdated and on the other hand I dont like the lack of composition of the topic. Or maybe I had even a false expectation.

Isaac Asimov's books were far from the normal trash novels you might buy for a 2 day read.
While other authors may have a truly evil force guiding those who commit crimes that must be overcome by truth and justice, Isaac Asimov concentrates on the reality of the situation to provide the obstacles.
It is through normal every day strife that humanity defines itself, not through warfare with a re-imagined Hitler or Stalin.
This short story anthology has a lot of stories in common with Robot Visions which I read earlier.
I rated Robot Visions with 3 stars; this one is surprisingly (even to myself) rated higher.
One of the reasons is that Visions included several essays; all of them aged much more than the stores themselves - and the stories did age.
Another reason is related to the structure of I, Robot.
I really like a couple of recurring guys, Donoval and Powell.
I am sorry but I also have to mention Susan Calvin.
"If one and a half chickens lay one and a half eggs in one and a half days, how many eggs will nine chickens lays in nine days?" This is incredible, the best of all science fiction I have read yet. As Fredrick Pohl put it: “A good science fiction story should be able to predict not the automobile but the traffic jam.”  Asimov not only does that - and he goes one step further, he proposes a solution for the metaphorical traffic jam - in this case ethical issues related to AI, in form of his popu
Asimov not only does that - and he goes one step further, he proposes a solution for the metaphorical traffic jam - in this case ethical issues related to AI, in form of his popular 'three laws of robotics' :1) A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.2) A robot must obey orders given to it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.3) A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.The laws, as you can see, have nothing to do with the mechanics but rather their psychology - robo-psychology.

(3.75?)I thought this book would be similar to the movie but... no, not at all (or barely!).There are 9 short stories told and, although I enjoy all of them, I much preferred the last couple ones.
It's a series of short stories revolving around Susan Calvin, a robopsychologist with the company U.S. Robots.
The stories show the progression of robots (from ones that can't even talk to the machines that govern how the planet operates) and the relationship humans have with them.I really enjoyed the overall arc and how it was presented.
I also really dug how most of the stories were puzzles about why robots were acting in a certain way, and how the Three Laws of Robots were manipulated in order to solve them.I, Robot is completely accessible, entertaining, and hardly feels dated despite its 50+ years of age.
Though I do love Asimov's writing, he was most certainly a product of his times.
(Translate - horrifically sexist.) The one female character who is in nearly all these stories is Dr. Susan Calvin.
rant over.Politics aside, this is a fairly decent collection of robot-centered short stories.
A weight dropped, crashed downward, then pounded aside at the last moment under the synchronized thump of a sudden force beam.Only once -And from her small camp chair in the observing booth in the balcony, Dr. Susan Calvin rose with a short gasp of pure horror.Sixty-three robots sat quietly in their chairs, staring owlishly at the endangered man before them.
In fact, it made me wonder whether the robots governing our world wouldn't be a fine solution for the eternally unstable economic system of our planet that results in millions of death due to poverty annually?
That's a really frighting number (basically two things that worry me the most about our human society- the presence of slavery and unstable economy that results in continuous warfare).
Can we say that a woman was essentially the mother of robots (in Asimov's world)?
As far as I can remember there is only one story in this novel that kind of reminds me of the movie.
Transcript of the meeting between Dr Susan Calvin, Head Psychologist, United States Robots, and Dr Peter Bogert, Managing Director, United States RobotsDate: 9-5-2025 11:15 ESTBOGERT : The reason I asked to see you today, Dr Calvin, is that my office has a disturbing rumour that you have developed a robot to write book reviews.CALVIN : Well, that is correct.
BOGERT : So, is that the extent of your Goodreads involvement?CALVIN : Oh no – our programmers finally figured out the formula – by 2005 our reviewbots were the 25 most popular reviewers on Goodreads.
Ha ha.BOGERT : I take that as a yes.CALVIN : Are YOU a robot?

❝ Science fiction writers foresee the inevitable, and although problems and catastrophes may be inevitable, solutions are not.❞------------- Isaac Asimov-------------- 
This collection of concept-driven stories featuring robots were some of the first stories written by Science fiction god, Isaac Asimov.
These stories also introduce the "Three laws of robotics" which became a milestone in science fiction history.
Pure logic based problem-solving and the genuine awe-inspiring imagination; That's what make I, Robot a superior science fiction.
Short stories like "The Evitable Conflict" and "Little Lost Robot" investigates the very concept of dangers posed by logic based reasoning.
It is a collection of nine short stories narrated by Dr Susan Calvin who is psychologist to the robots and it is set in the future when the existence of the robots, even though they are supposed to be sentient, face opposition and fear.
A robot must protect its own existence as long as it does not conflict with the First or Second law.
I simply could not believe what Universal had done to Asimov's classic novel--and I could understand completely why the author forbade the studio from putting the film into general release.The stories in the book dealing with the emergence of robotic reasoning and the nature of the three rules of robotics had been jettisoned entirely, and in their place A&C had to save the world from a mad scientist (played ignominiously and with evident boredom by Boris Karloff) and his robot army.
It set the tone & often the ground rules for almost every artificial intelligence novel since it was written.
The three laws of robotics first appeared in these stories.
Asimov had a pretty good idea that artificial intelligence was similar to fire - a dangerous servant.
He proves it in these pages.This paperback version strings the stories together as a reporter interviews Susan Calvin just before she retires.
The reporter is trying for a human interest angle with a woman who is thought to be almost robotic in nature.
Yes, they all appear in The Complete Robot, but just in cold, chronological order.
(hide spoiler)] Here we learn that women think about love and men think about careers, as Asimov follows the First Rule of Science Fiction: never understand women.Little lost robotA batch of robots has been secretly made with altered first laws: while they still can't harm humans, they can now stand by and allow humans to be harmed.
(hide spoiler)] This story deals with the singularity, the moment when robot judgment becomes better than ours.
Kanıt isimli robot öyküsüne bayıldım, kendimi bir an Philik K. Dick okuyormuş gibi hissettim. "...Robotları severim. İnsanlardan daha çok severim. Eğer günün birinde kamu idareciliği yapabilecek bir robot üretilirse, bu işi herkesten iyi kıvırır. Robotbilim Kanunları'na göre insanlara zarar veremez, tiranlık yapamaz, rüşvet alamaz, önyargılı davranamaz, saçma sapan kararlar çıkartamaz. Ve dönemi başarıyla tamamladıktan sonra ölümsüz olsa bile görevini bsşkasına devreder, çünkü insanlara bir robot tarafından yönetildiklerini itiraf ederek, gururlarını kıramaz. Robotlar bu iş için biçilmiş kaftandır..."Okurken çok keyif aldım. Herkese iyi okumalar.
Asimov gives you quite a good idea of what's it like to have to debug an artificial intelligence, before there were any. Applause! The movie, however, is an abomination that should have been strangled at birth. They've made Susan Calvin sexy; you see her suggestively outlined through the semi-opaque glass of her shower cubicle. I can't continue with this review. I'm starting to get too emotional. Sorry. A few things are still sacred, you know?_____________________________________PS My real I, Robot review is here. Though I'm afraid it contains yet another example of That Joke...
No soy un asiduo lector de Ciencia Ficción (con excepción de los libros de Ray Bradbury, a quien admiro profundamente), pero reconozco la maestría de Isaac Asimov de acuñar las Tres Leyes de la Robótica, algo así como las tablas de Moisés que rigen la vida del futuro entre robots y seres humanos y que seguramente deben se necesarias para aquellos autores que quieran escribir libros sobre robots.
Este libro reúne nueve cuentos unidos entre sí por una conversación o entrevista (nunca queda muy claro) a la robotpsicóloga Susan Calvin.
un robot, una niña y la amistad.2.
Resmen şahane. Böyle bir konunun her açıdan, ama her açıdan -hele taaa o zamanlardan- ele alınması hayranlık uyandırıcı. Günümüzde robot teknolojisi Asimov'un da öngörmüş olduğu üzere çok ileride olmasa da kıpırtılar da yok değil. Erişir miyiz bu öngörülere bilemem ama kesin olan şey, Asimov'un bahsettiği teknolojiye erişsek de erişemesek de kendisi her zaman çok büyük bir yazar olarak kalacak.
Fahrenheit 451 ve Kaplan Kaplan'dan sonra beni çok daha farklı açıdan büyüleyen bir bilimkurgu kitabı oldu Ben, Robot.
Hiçbiri hiçbir şekilde sırıtmadığı gibi, muhtemelen günümüz çağında robotik alanında uğraşan çoğu insanın referans kaynaklarından birisi olmuştur bu kitap.Kişisel açıdan elektronik mühendisliği okumamın en büyük sebebi robotlardır.
"Kanıt" hikayesi belki o açıdan çok tatmin edici olmadı ama son derece ilginç bir konudan bahsetmiş olması bile yeterince merak içerisinde okumamı sağladı.
Belki diğer hikayeler için ek bir güncelleme yapabilirim bu incelemeye daha detaylıca anlatmak açısından ama hiçbir hikayenin beni hayal kırıklığına uğratmadığını rahatlıkla söyleyebilirim.Ben, Robot kesinlikle okuduğum en güzel bilimkurgu romanlarından birisi oldu.
Bilgisayarı açtığımda yazacağım.
Still entertaining.The scope is far ranging - space colonisation, artificial intelligence, faster than light travel, one world government and resistance to the same (and to artificial intelligence which provides a kind of ultimate technocratic authority) relationships (in every story) between people and robots, particularly if there are or are not robots indistinguishable from people.The drama of the stories is invariably of the locked room mystery type - Asimov establishes a situation in which x is impossible, but apparently has happened by the end of the story and resolution is achieved.In many ways Asimov's vision of the future is of a super 1950s (view spoiler)[ which is when the stories were written (hide spoiler)].
The stream of high-speed electrons impinging upon the energy beam fluoresced into ultraspicules of intense light.
Focus is on two scientists and their work alongside robots; however, Asimov opened with a compelling domestic scene, one involving a family of three and arguments concerning their “robot nursemaid,” but a skim of the rest of the book reveals that, oddly, the story never returns to that human element.
If the inter-related stories had continued in this vein and not abruptly switched to a different focus in subsequent chapters, I, Robot may have been the better for it.
I, Robot is my first Asimov book and I'm glad I started here.
The book talks about many points when it comes to robots, or just technology in general.
If you want to read this book because you’ve seen the movie, well…I’m sorry you’ll be disappointed.
The movie was about only one aspect of this book (or rather only one chapter) which was about “what happens when robots find out they can take control.” WHAT?
This book talks about using technology so that it helps and not hinders society.
Well, why would I want to read a book like that?
(por si estaban con el pendiente de cual era mi cuento favorito de robots en este libro)Asimov me voló la cabeza con la Trilogía de la Fundación el año antepasado, y en esta ocasión logra gustarme todavía más.
Si has leído o visto películas sobre el tema te darás cuenta que todos toman como base las tres leyes de la robótica de Asimov de una forma u otra, con alguna variante tal vez pero en esencia están ahí.
Y es tan increíblemente genial que me lo leí como en tres días.
Una de las mejores lecturas que he tenido en mucho tiempo.
Bir solukta okudum, muhteşem bir kitaptı. Ben, Robot, aslında Asimovun yazdığı robot temalı bir çok küçük hikayenin akıllıca bir araya getirilerek romanlaşması. Birbiriyle doğrudan bağları olmayan hikayeler çarpıcı, Asimov'un kurguladığı dünya, insanlık ve bilimsel yapı zamanının çok ama çok ötesinde. Bu hikayeleri yazdığı dönemde böyle günümüze paralel şeyler hayal etmesi cidden akıl almaz. Hayal gücüne, yaratıcı bilimsel kurgularına hayran kaldım. Her ne kadar sonradan yazdığı kısa açıklamada robot temasının her hangi bir sembolizm içermediğini söylede de yaratıcı, yaratmak ve yaratık kavramlarını enine boyuna sorgulattı bana hikayeler. Mükemmeldi, herkese tavsiye ederim.
Adeta insanlığın -hala ulaşılamamış- geleceğinden bir kesite ayna tutuyor.
Robot denince dümdüz işte robotlar ayaklanıyor insanları kesiyorlar gibi bir şey gelmesin aklınıza.
Robotların robot olmanın gerektirdikleri yüzünden yaşadıkları ve insanların onları anlamaya çalışmaları var.
Robot yasaları ve bu yasalarla adeta bir hukukçu/programcı/psikolog edasıyla dans eden bir anlatım var.
Öykülerden oluşan bir kitap ama öyküler daha büyük bir çerçevede arka arkaya dizilerek bir "büyük resim" oluşturuyorlar.
Büyük resmi bize Asimov 1950'lerde göstermiş :DŞahane kitap, 10/10 üç beş sene sonra yine okurum.
Vakıf serisinden sonra geri dönme fırsatını bulduğum Asimov hakikaten bir usta.
İthaki'ye de bu şaheseri tekrar bize kazandırdığı için ayrıca teşekkürler.
3 stars, rounded up for the scope of Asimov's AIInteresting ideas and conception of robotics conveyed in a series of short stories. I could read about Asimov's robotics all day. His scope of cultural changes (ie revolution), however, is lacking in comparison. The year 2007 in the book does not seem like actual 2007 at all, same goes for 2015, and same for 2035 I'd imagine. The cultural climate feels more like the 1950s with the addition of accelerated scientific advancement than the world we're

I don't expect books or people from the 1950s to be able to predict our current state of the world with any accuracy, but some accuracy or astute outlook would make the writing more believable.
1. A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.2. A robot must obey orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.3. A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.Oh, to think how many hours of reading pleasure Asimov has provided by judicious interplay of the above three laws! I never tire of reading these clever intellectual puzzles.Asimov is a must for left-brained nerds. 😊
