It is really embarrassing that I read this entire book without realizing the colt was not in a bad mood but was, in fact, being trained for harness racing. In my defense, I do recall that it was skittish and didn't want to race so probably *was* quite cranky.
Old men.
This book is mostly about old men.
Also horses, of course, and racing.
But the heart of it is the old men who know the way things are done, and old men in opposition to one another, and old men trying to help young men despite the young men being kinda jerks.
I love Henry Dailey, the irascible old git.
And of course Bonfire is a dream colt.
Alec's not perfect here, and he learns some things- though I'm not sure I've ever met a young man so humble and ready to be steered.
As always, pulse-pounding race scenes.
Alec is a tall thin jockey that is driving Bonfire throughout the book because of what happened to Tom Messenger, Bonfire's original jockey and trainer.
The problem begins when Tom and Alec are doing their morning workout, when all of a sudden Bonfire swerves and throws Tom onto the track.
The track officials had to see the finishing photo to see who had won the race.
Bonfire and Alec had won!
They left Jimmy, Tom, and George alone with their colt and went back home.I really liked this book because it had a lot of problems with it and the excitement that I really like.
The Black Stallion's Sulky Colt...I enjoyed seeing Bonfire, Jimmy Creech, George and Tom again, but I knew before opening the thing that if Henry and Alec showed up, there would be conflict.
Apparently, Henry and Alec can do absolutely no wrong.
I was okay with them being right about a few things, but why did they have to take over the whole show?
I would have enjoyed it a lot more if all of them had just worked together to help Bonfire and Tom get over their accident and face their fears.
This is one of the more enjoyable books in the series, although the Black does not appear.
I also appreciated some of the clashes of horse care in walking hot horses (or not) after I worked for a Standardbred racing stable for a horrible six-seven months.
Unlike Alec, I couldn't make any changes to better the horses' lives.
Although this is a great fantasy, there are many real-world problems with the book -- for example, Bonfire would never have been registered as a Standardbred because the Black is his sire.
It's also outdated as harness racing has changed so much since this was first published.
Loved everything Black Stallion when I was a kid, but I read the books in Swedish so it's not always easy to know what they were in English.
I particularly enjoyed this book - which I have read multiple times - when I a few years later became involved in the "trotting" world.
For about ten years of my life I lived and breathed for everything "horse".
Working with horses as a professional usually means gruelling and unpredictably long hours with little earnings.
The hours I work tend still to be long, but I am duly compensated.
Another great adventure with Henry Daily and Alec Ramsay - this time they stray into harness racing to help an old friend and a son of The Black. The racing scenes are exciting and Alec has retained his big heart even with all he's been through in his relatively short life. This book fits in well with the series as a whole, and hasn't lost any of its magic through the years since it was released. It only loses one star from me for some of the conflict between characters which feels a little heavy handed.
I loved this book when I was young. When I finished it I remember showing it to my Dad and saying how good it was, raving on and on about it. So that evening Dad started reading it and stayed up late into the night, until he had finished it. (Which was a big deal because he had to get up very early to milk cows.) I was so thrilled that he had read and enjoyed the book I recommended. I should really give it 5 stars just for the memories!
I read so many of Walter Farley's Black Stallion books as a child and I can't remember any of them not being wonderful.
I don't remember the details of this particular book and now, seeing the title, I got a little thrill.
I read these in the 1970's and 1980's and they didn't seem dated or vintage even though many had been written years earlier.
Oh, to be able to read these again as a youngster and re-experience all the adventure and mystery of Alex and the Black and feel that same thrill.
"Loving horses means loving any kind of horse, regardless of type or breed or the use to which he is put."Sometimes I'm in the mood for a book about horse racing (well, okay, all the time), but rarely are their books about harness racing, something I only vaguely new of before the first Bonfire book.
It's a very interesting sport - not as exciting as thoroughbred racing to me, personally, but I don't know that much about it.
This book was a great introduction into a different kind of horse racing that is not widely broadcast, unless you are apart of that worldVery interesting.
loved every book in this series....my best friend Laura and I couldn't read them fast enough
Learned about harness racing by reading this book
Alex enters the world of harness racing when Black's colt out of a trotter looses his driver.This book didn't have much Black in it, but it was still really, really good! Walter Farley is timeless and Alec Ramsey is my favorite.
The Black Stallion's Sulky Colt The Island Stallion Races The Black Stallion's Courage The Black Stallion Mystery The Horse-Tamer (all by Walter Farley) I stepped away from my re-read of this series as I just knew the two books listed first were coming up.
These two (Sulky Colt and Island Stallion Races) were even worse than I remembered.
I wonder if The Island Stallion Races is what turned me off of sci-fi.
The Horse-Tamer isn't really part of the series but is about the Black's trainer Henry Dailey as a boy.
This book has more than a bit of a commentary on harness racing - not very complimentary to harness racers. This is not a young children's book, as it needs to be taken for what it is. Let's just say harness racing is quite a bit different today. So I didn't feel like Bonfire (the sulky colt) got much credit, although the description of the activities surrounding harness racing is accurate and detailed. I really question the ability of anyone, even Alec Ramsay, to step in and drive in a race with so little experience.
I love this book, but here I am reviewing only the cover of this Yearling edition. What gait is the horse doing? He is supposed to be trotting, but the way his legs are drawn he appears to be doing some sort of variation on a counter- or cross-canter. He is also incredibly fat for a three-year-old racehorse. Why can't publishers read the books and research the subject matter a little before commissioning a cover illustration? Or reproduce the cover illustration on the original edition, which is a lovely head shot of Bonfire, the blood bay colt of the story.
I enjoyed the characters, and their world and hope I get the chance to read the story again and/or to read more within the series.My Rating System:* couldn't finish, ** wouldn't recommend, *** would recommend, **** would read again, ***** have read again.
I raced through this series as a child. Of course, "The Black Stallion" was my favorite, and I read it a few times, but I waited eagerly for any of the books to return to my branch of the library so I could snap them up.
This was the first book I read in the Black Stallion series. It got me hooked and I read almost all of the books in the series. I remember I read it in 6th grade for one of those reading programs (like Reading Is Fundamental or something like that).
I really loved this one, which was about trotting, and dealing with a spooked horse.
I remember enjoying all of the Black Stallion books as a child. I don't recall much about this one, but if memory serves, Bonfire, a pacer, is injured and is afraid to race.
Okay, maybe this is the one I own... I'll have to check...
It is an OK book. I sort of liked it.
Probably my favorite
i like it alot
With Jimmy in the background, and Tom and George out of the way, Alec and Henry come to the rescue in the nick of time to give Bonfire the chance he deserves at the Hambletonian.
Aside from 'The Black Stallion Revolts' this one was my next favorite of the Black Stallion books.
Re-read
There was not a Black Stallion book that I could ever put down. The stories are the best.
Extra 1/2 star.
