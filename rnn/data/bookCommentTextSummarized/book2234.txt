Very nice overview of the meaning of the myth of the Holy Grail, routs and connections with past organizations. It puts a new perspective on the Ghibelline ideals and exposes the usurpation and false use of the myth by contemporary advocates of the "enlightenment".
But I don't like finishing a book that is supposed to explain "the mystery of the Grail" and feeling like I haven't really learned anything more than the author's guesses as to the meaning of each symbol.
But the constant erudite comparisons of various stories and characters don't by themselves provide an explanation, and the reader is after reading an entire page or two sometimes left wondering if these comparisons have any value at all other than showing a certain consistency across Traditions and across time.
When trying to provide a deeper insight, Evola is left guessing and interpreting subjectively as much as anyone else.
Outstanding analysis of Hermeticism and the idea of the Grail and it's pre-Christian gnostic origins.
Para todos os tradicionalistas,encontram em Évola um defensor acérrimo da Tradição Integral.A tradição vista como um conjunto de princípios eternos e supra-humanos imanentes no fluir dos tempos.É a tradição trancendente que os tempos modernos querem corromper a todo o custo.Para além de uma obra esotérica,como toda a obra evoliana,a defesa da tradição vai projectar a individualidade numa hierarquia e vice-versa,portanto pode a obra ser considerada perante uma visão ético-política.
