So I am done reading and I don't know what to feel...**POTENTIAL SPOILERS BELOW**Seeing my Lara Jean and Peter K together after all this time...Lara Jean being the 16 year old that she iscaring way too much about her being labeled 'Slut' by everyone...Lara Jean coming to a conclusion on her thoughts on love...Kitty being all sorts of amazing...Peter and Gen constantly being seen together...Lara Jean and JOHN what's-his-name-the-third...The stupid arguments...
And then one day they're not." - Lara Jean**My review on the third book - https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...**-----------------------------------------------THE DAY HAS COME 26/5/15-----------------------------------------------You're kidding right?
SO SO ADORABLE - LOVED IT!! Here's my booktalk: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2pSE...
(view spoiler)[ I was so mad the way Peter kept putting Gene first.
Then Peter finally at the very end decides to fight for her and she forgives him and says it was her fault all along that she needed to get over her Gene insecurities.
I wanted her with Peter but Peter never really apologized and why did he let her break up with him and then finally when he was jealous of John he started fighting for her??!!??!?!?!
Go away John!(view spoiler)[ Please finally have Lara Jean and Peter end up together.
4.5 SO CUTE OMG OMG! I felt the resolution came a little too quickly hence the 4.5 but I loved every second.
3.5/5Though this one is my least favorite in the series, it's still a solid contemporary that I flew through. It's not as lighthearted or optimistic as the first installment, but it focuses on heartbreak and incompatible relationships. It shows the aftermath of a whirlwind romance - the "happily ever after" - which many contemporaries don't. I was about to rate this just a 3/5, but then I remembered this one has my boy John Ambrose McClaren and the USO party HECK YES.
Quiero ahorcar a Lara Jean.DESPUÉS DE LEER (29/05/2015):Son realmente 4.5 estrellitas :).Dado que mi review inicial fue en español, continuaré en español (?).
Todo el tiempo estuve sonriendo como boba enamorada (ES CULPA DE PETER KAVINSKY) y también me reí a carcajadas en otras escenas.
Creo que mis personajes favoritos de este segundo libro fueron Peter, Kitty, Lara Jean y hasta John.
Peter me tenía como loca enamorada.Hubo algunas cosas que no me gustaron de la actitud de Lara Jean, y también Peter tuvo algunos momentos en los que quise golpearlo, peeero todo bien, hahaha.
Me quedé pensando que le faltó "algo" al libro, pero de igual forma lo amé demasiado, una muy buena secuela.
This review will contain spoilers... and profanities.  First of all, giving this book 2 stars is a very generous act on my part.Okay, one star then.My initial reaction upon finishing this book was to roll my eyes. To the moon and back.I am so pissed. This book is just awful.Behold, the summary in bullet form!featuring BONUS CONTENT: SLIGHT COMMENTARIES. PART 1 • Lara Jean Song Covey is a fragile, innocent, princess• Peter Kavinsky is the complete opposite • they're dating • they signed a contra
• Peter thinks he's the king of the world• he still treats Lara Jean like garbage• John and Lara Jean started hanging out• they kiss• “I think I could be a person who is in love with more than one person at a time.” - Lara Jean• %!^#?*!%*#?$^*#!?^* !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!• Lara Jean is also full of shit• Peter professed his love• Lara Jean fell for it• poor Johnny left behind• Peter and Lara Jean ended up togetherNow, do you get my point?!
Lara Jean and Peter broke up because it just isn't working anymore.
"There's a Korean word my grandma taught me. It's called jung. It's the connection between two people that can't be severed, even when love turns to hate. You still have those old feelings for them; you can't ever completely shake them loose of you; you will always have tenderness in your heart for them." This book does many explosive things to my heart.Every time I read a new novel by Han, I am always assaulted by these strong emotions. In a way it reminds me of our quintessential home where I
This book does many explosive things to my heart.Every time I read a new novel by Han, I am always assaulted by these strong emotions.
It sounds sad, but it’s absolutely astonishing, very few books could incite those feelings from me.P.S. I Still Love You opens right after where the first book left it off.
A reader could expect, kissing, scandal, intense jealousy, family love, and more kissing.Like with To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before, I also annihilate this book.
I’ve seen some readers begging to read more books that include parents in the plot.
I love books that stays very true.
Luckily, the majority of my issues were resolved by the ending and I was able to end this book feeling more connected to the story.My favorite thing about this story is the family dynamic.
I'm pleased that attempts at resolutions are made in the end, but I do feel some points were skipped over and not fully addressed for the sake of completing the novel more quickly.Another issue I had with this book was the introduction of a second love triangle.
A lot of times, the final judge of my enjoyment of a book is how motivated I am to find out what happens in the end and my desire to keep reading.
3.6/5 Stars ⭐ ⭐ ⭐ ⭐“People come in and out of your life. For a time they are your world; they are everything. And then one day they’re not. There’s no telling how long you will have them near.” And now my love for this series starts to disintegrate. To die out, to wither. *hello darkness my old friend*. ANYWAY. This book starts off strong with a very interesting plot that was also used in the movie. The sex tape pool thing. It was brushed off lightly in the movie, but it showed many repercussion
And also, we leave the whole situation to the boy A.K.A. Peter to handle it.
Ugh. Anyway, let's get to the plot.Lara Jean didn’t expect to really fall for Peter.
Now Lara Jean is more confused than ever.
We also got the Josh factor erased from this book, so it was all Peter and Lara Jean.
I was honestly like "Come on Lara Jean really?
It's like she kisses John and she feels things and then 10 pages later she's with Peter again and she's in love with him again.
And Lara Jean won at the end.
What a pointless book.Ok I'm being extra harsh here but this, folks, is what happens when an author stretches a story for no reason. This should have been a standalone. Who knows what I would think after reading the last book. I'm not sure I will.
ANOTHER boy?! Are you kidding me, Lara Jean?!
I'm Team Peter K all the way, though :)  (hide spoiler)]The Peter/Lara Jean relationship isn't perfect, either, but I guess that's one of the aspects that makes this duology (hopefully trilogy?) special in the current realm of YA romance.
There are bumps, and there are high points; it's not the unrealistic, lovey-dovey kind of relationship that's perfect all the time, but that is precisely what made me like this book so much.__________________________________________________________________4/26/2014Dear Jenny Han,You CANNOT (I repeat: CANNOT.) Torture your readers in this way!!!
Re-read 8/23/18: Okay 2017 chelsea clearly has it all wrong. John Ambrose is where it’s at and I refuse to be told otherwise Re-read 5/5/17: I loved this even more the second time. Peter K is so dreamy! Original read 6/28/15: This book was an absolute DELIGHT. Jenny Han does contemporaries like no other.
Spoilers for the last book: Lil Lara Jean, our insanely-named protagonist, got herself into a little kerfuffle involving a series of letters addressed-n-stamped to old crushes, a fake relationship plot, a love triangle with her sister, and a certain lacrosse-playing douchenozzle the likes of which haunts public high school halls from here to Timbuktu.So here we are.
Because Peter (that’s Jock with Nice Hair #1, in case I didn’t mention that) is actually a TOTAL D*CK on top of it!He throws tantrums when Lara Jean can’t come to one of his dumb jockfests (I believe you may call it a “sporting event”) or doesn’t bake him cookies (this is a CHILD) or isn’t into PDA.
Attention: This may be spoilerish for the first book!  Second read:  “People come in and out of your life. For a time they are your world; they are everything. And then one day they’re not. There’s no telling how long you will have them near.”  Story ⭐⭐⭐⭐The first time I read this book, I hated it. I hated Lara Jean, the way Peter treated her and I hated John Ambrose McClaren. I hated it so much, I DNFd it. But then I watched the movie and I saw John Ambrose gorgeous face and I was like: Mhm, m
There’s no telling how long you will have them near.”  Story ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️The first time I read this book, I hated it.
I hated Lara Jean, the way Peter treated her and I hated John Ambrose McClaren.
There’s trouble in the love paradise of Lara Jean and Peter.
So all in all I wasn’t 100 % into the love triangle, but I liked that Lara Jean had options.
Her stories are fluffy, sweet but sometimes also sad, confusing and heartbreaking.I had a lot of fun reading this book and I’m happy I tried reading it a second time.
Interviewer:  But I thought you loved Peter Kavinsky?
Like it's okay not to be "where everyone else is" and it's okay to not want to rush into serious relationships and it's OKAY to be a little naive or soft or sweet• however...ugh Lara Jean did that thing and argh it was really frustrating and honestly why the book isn't the full 5 stars (view spoiler)[I mean I do think Peter was being an ass with how he was "comforting" Gen but also wouldn't explain to Lara Jean why.
Like usually I'd be 0% interested reading about someone folding the washing, but Lara Jean can just live her cute and soft and lovely life and I want to read about it all the time.• Bless this book and my horrid emotions for it.
Me: WHAT just happened? P.s I still love you: *screams* NOTHING!Me: Where's my character development?P.s I still love you: what did you just say?Me:  *glares* P.s I still love you: *innocent eyes* OHHH you mean character retrogression?  cOnGrAts book you got me having a conversation with you. HONESTLY I'M SO ANNOYED WITH THIS BOOK Why can't you just end the first one without a cliffhanger so you won't have to write a sequel that nothing happens.  I WAS EXPECTING MY CUTSY LOVEY ROMANCE, where is
I'm fourteen, and she acts like my sister (not that I have one but if I do, I bet Ms-I-have-no-idea-how-old-she-is would be even more foolish than her) 2) Peter is not here half of the time (I loved him in the first one, what happened in this?) 3) YEAH BOOK YOU KEPT ME AWAY FROM HIM and you introduced Lara Jean to another guy (well sort of) But excuse me, you see I don't care if she falls in love with him but DON'T GIVE ME A CRAPPY LOVE/LUST-STUPID-LOVE-SQUARE.
To all the people who loved this book, P.s I did not mean to offend you.
Crying because this book is so perfect.I didn't really love the first book - it was very hit and miss for me but mostly hit, which is why I gave it 4 stars.
Lara Jean has grown up a lot from the first book - which I think is what helped this book out a lot.
I loved seeing her come more into her own - and her relationship with Peter blossoming...all of it was JUST SO GOOD!
And I think it felt like more of a real relationship than many I've read in contemporary books.
brb thinking about this book forever.
I'm sure (view spoiler)[John Ambrose McClaren will show up in this book.
Maybe they're going to meet first before Lara Jean and Peter get together.
I really love Peter but he really should sort out his feelings.
Lara Jean already did, and she chose him.
Lara Jean didn't even make him chose between her or Gen. Whatever.
Still love Lara Jean and Peter together :) Oh and the recent letter Lara Jean wrote about Josh.
I'm sure someone will see the letter which she tucked in her diary because she said she feels it isn't finished with Josh, yet.
In truth, this book deserves 2 stars, but I'm too chicken-shit to give it that because I'd seriously be one of the very very very few that would rate this novel so lowly.
4. It made me seriously want to gouge out my eyes thanks to the love-triangle I was sure we lost back in the prequel.
John Ambrose McClaren was probably definitely the best thing about this book.
Too bad P.S. I Still Love You failed to be heartwarming and cute for me too.
Big fans of the first book -- go ahead and read it, I'm sure you'll be pleased.
I just can't wait !!!*Dear Peter...oh god how can I wait for it till 2015 !!!
Rating: 3.5 stars
Just *sighs*.But getting to know Peter again and understanding better his character and his past, I realize I couldn’t let him go either and I’m not even Lara Jean.
It's silly, definitely silly, but I enjoyed it.^^Lara Jean, a 16 year old, Korean American "goody two shoes" hopes to win back the guy she still loves which she learns is not as simple as she thought would be especially when another guy from her past comes back to her life.
Such a nice change of pace to read a book like this every now and again!"'Lara Jean, I think you half-fall in love with every person you meet.
She loves the way being with Peter makes her feel, but she's afraid he'll hurt her or expect too much from her, so they make a contract which includes a promise not to break each other's heart.
She should trust Peter when he says there's nothing going on beyond helping a friend through tough times, even if she feels like sometimes he'd drop everything for Gen, but not for her.When a video of Lara Jean and Peter is made public, she is horrified by the things people assume about her.
I won't say anything, because any reaction will be spoilery. I'm just going to say:I'M TEAM KITTYReview to come
Everyone will fall in love with you, because you're so beautiful and so charming, and you'll look back on high school as such a tiny blip."3.5/5 starsThis novel was really cute and quirky, just like book one.
(hide spoiler)]Now I still have my issues with this series.First, I still can't get over the fact how LJ always says "Daddy".Second, Kitty still makes for a completely unrealistic 9-year-old.Third, it's predictable.Fourth, it's cute but it really doesn't mean anything to me.
Don't get me wrong, I like the books, but they just lack something.
It's a YA contemporary love story, but that doesn't mean it needs to be so plain.

I received a free finished hardcover of this book from the publisher (Simon and Schuster) in exchange for an honest review.
All opinions are my own.4 of 5 stars (Please read my rating system further below).
The return of Johnny was pretty darn awesome, but I will always love Mr. Peter Kavinksy.My rating system: (I do use half stars.)5 - I do not use the 5 star.
Not because a book might not be worthy, but because a book is never perfect.4 - I loved it!
Need to think about this one some more, then I'll come back with a review! I might even do a book talk.. we'll see!
All I can say is IM VERY GLAD THERE’S NOW A THIRD ONE BECAUSE I NEED IT AFTER THIS
