Spengler's "Prussianism and Socialism" is an excellent, but very dense book.
In it, he outlines a number of European psyches or dispositions: English liberalism, Spanish ultramontanism, French and Italian anarchism, and Prussian socialism.He then goes on to discuss the English and the Prussian mentalities in detail, exploring their origins, in what ways they differ, etc.â€”critiquing the former (while acknowledging its virtues), and defending the latter.The final third of the book deals with Marx and communism.
Spengler argues that Marx is in fact an essentially English thinker, that the class egoism of communism is antithetical to Prussian socialism (which predates Marxist thought), and that "international socialism" is a myth.Spengler masterfully cuts through all the noise in order to bring out the essential parts of everything.
Fun to see how prescient Spengler is, many of his predictions were spot on and many of his characterizations still hold true. It's also interesting to reflect on Spengler's work in the context of the regime that would rise just a decade after it was written, vaguely frightening even.Spengler's sarcasm and biting prose was enjoyable and the work contains quite a few kernels of wisdom that are worth taking on.
