After I read this book, which I finished many, many years ago, I had become self-critical of any future endeavours which would take up a lot of my time.
I would ask myself "is this or will this be meaningful to me?", and if the answer was "no", I wouldn't do it.
"Meaningful" should be equated with "fulfilling".
I went to York U instead of U of T.
I went to Europe instead of immediately entering the workforce after graduation.
I want to recommend this book to all of my grade 12 students.
I read this book for the first time during my senior year in high school.
The first section recounts in vivid detail Frankl's horrifying experiences as a prisoner in a Nazi concentration camp.
As I recall, Frankl personally found his purpose in the hope of someday being able to see his wife again - a hope that was strong enough to get him through the daily horrors he faced.The second half of this book is devoted to the therapy he developed based on the search for meaning, which he calls logotherapy.
How is it possible to write dispassionately of life in a concentration camp in such a way as to engender great feeling in the reader?
The first half of the book is equal in its telling to The Diary of a Young Girl in furthering our understanding of those dreadful times.There are occasional glimmers of humanity from the Germans.
I did read this in its entirety but it wouldn't have spoiled the book, or my appreciation of the genius retelling and brilliant writing of the first half, if I hadn't.
**كيف ينتقل الإنسان من الطور الأول لردود الفعل العقلية إلى الطور الثاني ؟- الطور الثاني هو البلادة التّي تصل به إلى نوع من الموت الإنفعالي و سبب ذلك أن السجين يعيش ألوانا من االإنفعالات المؤلمة، الشوق العارم، الإشمئزاز و التقزز من حياة المعتقل و المحيط حوله، الشعور بالوهن و نوع من الكآبة و هذه العوامل تجتمع و تولد البلادة .ماذا تقصد بالبلادة ؟- إن المناظر التي كانت تثير السجين و تحرك عواطفه و مشاعره و تجر أحاسيسه أصبحت لا تثير فيه شيئا، مثلا منظر السجناء الجدد، منظر المحرقة، منظر طفل يعذب، منظر الجثث، منظر المرضى، منظر الآخر الرث البالي، منظر المعتقل، منظر الموت، منظر الحياة، منظر البتر، منظر الدماء، منظر النازي المتغطرس، كل شيء أصبح سواء عنده .البلادة كميكانيزم دفاعي عن الذات.لدي سؤال غريب نوعا ما ..
و أتوسّع من داخلي؟ القسم الثاني: المبادئ الأساسية للعلاج بالمعنى: هنا يكرر الحديث مرة أخرى لكن بطريقة مدهشة و تأكيديه مفصلة و علمية أكثر سأكتب ملخصًا بسيطًا يوضح ما ذكره، لأن مثل هذا الكتاب يُغرق فيه و لايسهل الحديث عنه!* إرادة المعنى : إن سعي الانسان إلى البحث عن معنى هو قوة أولية في حياته * الاحباط الوجودي: يذكر أنه يتولد من الصراعات بين القيم المختلفة- المعنوية الأخلاقية احتفظت باقتباسات تنفي قضية الاتزان التي كنت أؤمن بها!
The original part one was the strongest I think because the rest started to go into the typical psychobabble inherent to books trying to contribute to the academic side of psychology or psychiatry but the first part really grounded the idea of giving meaning to one existence into personal experience and I found it very poignant about the mental state of people in very stressful and hopeless situations.
This idea of a person having so much control over their own selves and survival is one I whole heartedly agree with.
But, while the basic premises are powerful and moving, the breadth and scale of repetition of the same ideas and the technical jargon and the constant Freud-bashing ensured that I did not enjoy the book as much as I had hoped.
If you pick up this book, like I did, in the hope that it is about Frankl's personal quest for meaning amidst the horrors of Auschwitz with a strong scientific perspective, you will be disappointed to find that you have picked up a medical journal that is pedantic and repetitive, with hardly any reference to Frankl's personal journey or about how he evolved his theory and practices (that did transform many lives) based on his experiences.
He continues in the second half of this book with a discussion of his approach to psychiatry, called logotherapy, based on the belief that each person needs to find something in his or her life, something particular and personal to them, to give their life meaning.
But I stuck with it this time and found it truly rewarding.The second part did sometimes challenge my brain cells with concepts like this:I never tire of saying that the only really transitory aspects of life are the potentialities; but as soon as they are actualized, they are rendered realities at that very moment; they are saved and delivered into the past, wherein they are rescued and preserved from transitoriness.
After the Book of Mormon, this would be my second recommendation to anyone looking for purpose in life.
He had decided to escape his camp near Dachau with a friend and was visiting some of his patients for the last time."I came to my only countryman, who was almost dying, and whose life it had been my ambition to save in spite of myself, but my comrade seemed to guess that something was wrong (perhaps I showed a little nervousness).
The unpleasant feeling that had gripped me as soon as I had told my friend I would escape with him became more intense.
This book stands out as one of the most helpful tools I've found in my life-long search for the way to live and be useful to others despite depression.
The search for meaning, for a response to something life is asking of you, is the place where hope is born.
Orienting yourself to responding in some way to what life is asking of you may not be the sole cure to depression but it is for me a necessary part of any healing process, of learning to live and be useful, despite the illness.
باشد که با این خواندن، از این بی معنا یی زندگی، رهایی پیدا کنم...
In a nutshell, this is what Viktor Emil Frankl (1905-1997) an Austrian Jew, neurologist, psychiatrist and a Holocaust survivor, is saying in this 1946 originally-published book, Man’s Search for Meaning.
Using his horrendous experiences at Auschwitz concentration camp, which he narrated in the first part of this book, he said that he and the other survivors kept themselves alive by imaging and looking forward to their lives after the war.
As if they had no longer any reason for living and thus they chose to die rather than to survive.He also said that we should not ask for the meaning of our life.

اما دوست دارم زمانی که این مساله رو به عنوان یه باور به زبون میارم ، اون آدمی باشم که تصوری واقعی از زشتی دنیا داره و اون نیمه ی تاریک زندگی رو هم لمس کرده بخونید این کتاب رو ، حتما بخونید.
حداقل چیزی که ازش بدست می آرید اینه که متوجه میشین انسان ها در بدترین شرایط روحی و جسمی شون باز هم قادر به ادامه دادن زندگی هستند.
اینکه معنای زندگی هامون فراتر از شکست خوردن و به آسانی تسلیم شدن هست، و اینکه هستند انسان هایی که با لمس سیاه ترین نیمه ی این دنیا هنوز به وجود زیبایی هاش معتقدن
If yes, then you haven't read this book.The meaning of life … Many people already died trying to find it or died before even finding it.
In this book, Man's Search for Meaning by Viktor Frankl, he shares his experiences in the concentration camp.
If you're not familiar with the history of Hitler, The Nazis, or watched movies like “A Beautiful Life” or “Schinder's List”, you will be in a state of shock reading this autobiographical account.Frankl discussed in the first part of the book the Psychological Reaction or Phases of a prisoner in the concentration camp.
Frankl's purpose in describing his time in Auschwitz and other camps was not to dwell on the horrors -- though there were plenty of those -- but instead to focus on how prisoners found meaning in their lives and how they chose to survive.
They may have been few in number, but they offer sufficient proof that everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms -- to choose one's attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one's own way."The second part of the book focuses on Frankl's system of logotherapy, which is about finding someone's primary meaning in life, and this section is more difficult to read and seems to be geared toward graduate students in psychology.The 2006 edition that I read had a lovely afterword giving more details about Frankl's life and the impact of his work.

In Man's Search for Meaning, Victor Frankl begins his description of life in Nazi concentration camps (including Auschwitz) with the premise that life in the camps represents a provisional existence.
Frankl does not dwell on the atrocities, but he does detail the mindset of his fellow prisoners facing what most of them knew was their death (as well as the death of their loved ones).
Using his experiences as a guide, he outlines his ideas about logotherapy while finding reason to hold to a 'tragic optimism.' There are other essential books detailing life in concentration camps (I'm thinking especially of Primo Levi's Life in Auschwitz), but Frankl's is an important work which should be read by those who seek to understand how concentration camp prisoners faced their ordeal.
In this sense, no group is of "pure race" - therefore one occasionally found a decent fellow among the camp guards.But then I see that goodness can still exist, even when one has every reason not to act on empathy; even when a simple, helpful act for another can threaten one's own life.
It was the human "something" which this man also gave to me - the word and look which accompanied the gift.” This kind of act was not unusual for this specific SS commander, and was not forgotten by the prisoners, either.

It's really difficult not to find stories of the holocaust incredibly gripping, and the way in which Frankl speaks of his experience is inspiring and yet still maintains that gravity you'd expect from such a narrative.However, the latter half of the book delves much more into a psychological, and less personal, examination of 'logotherapy' (that is, the author's personal psychological theory).
Once it became more of a text book with small sections reflecting on specific terms and theories, it was difficult to stay engaged.

He writes that the single most important self-determinant in his survival was his deep inherent conviction under the worst of all possible conditions that life has meaning: even here under constant risk of typhus, wearing the recycled prison garb of those who had been sacrificed to the ovens, starving, freezing, beaten, demonized and dehumanized.
He describes how this process of autobiography helped him to begin his own healing, a term which he describes as "autobibliotherapy." By virtue of writing down one's findings in the search for meaning, one serves to find meaning in one's own life and to help others find it in their lives.
🌟4/5🌟RTC.
If people can live through this, if you can write a book in your head, as a self-therapy so as not lose oneself or die from pain and fear and utter despair...
This needs to be reread multiple times to sink in.Q:Forces beyond your control can take away everything you possess except one thing, your freedom to choose how you will respond to the situation.
.. Everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms—to choose one’s attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one’s own way.
This article + another recent one from the Atlantic titled 'There's More to Life Than Being Happy' made it clearly evident to me that I needed to finally dust off my yellowed, Goodwill copy of Man's Search for Meaning, plug in my earbuds and experience this book that the Universe clearly wanted me to read this week.So, imagine a renowned Jewish therapist writes in 1946 (in 9 days) about his experiences at and survival in Auschwitz, and then adds his own psychotherapeutic method (Logotherapy), finding happiness by finding a meaning, a responsibility, a love, and ultimately self-determining.
Reading this book in high school changed my life.
After reading this book I realized that I had a choice.
I could let my circumstances dictate my attitude or I could choose my attitude, which could then change my circumstances.
Being an adult means accepting responsibility for your thoughts, actions and character.
I realized that I can choose my thoughts and actions regardless of my past or present after reading this book.
I can serve with a humble attitude, which gives my existence meaning.
I can choose an attitude with a long term perspective and motivate my life to a higher meaning.
This is the ultimate book on self motivation.
The more one forgets himself—by giving himself to a cause to serve or another person to love—the more human he is and the more he actualizes himself.”“According to logotherapy, we can discover this meaning in life in three different ways: (1) by creating a work or doing a deed; (2) by experiencing something or encountering someone; and (3) by the attitude we take toward unavoidable suffering.”It is his doctrine about the meaning of life that can be found in the attitude toward suffering, that Dr. Frankl applies to his experiences in the camp.
Psychology is a subject that inevitably stresses the position of the individual, and the psychology of a man who has lived through an experience where those with power held his life in utter contempt and enjoyed making it clear to him that his ongoing existence was completely at their discretion would hardly encourage him to seek meaning in ‘grand projects’ and such.
What he has learnt is better than what some of his fellow prisoners learnt, but if anything this book should be a reminder that someone forced to live through the banality of evil isn’t really under obligations to learn cuddly and life-affirming lessons from that experience.
