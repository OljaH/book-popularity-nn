Once again, we find ourselves marveling at the absurdity of governmental "logic," but at the same time, I kept finding myself thinking about the old adages: "No man is an island" and "Don't bite the hand that feeds you." The flip side of maintaining a death-grip on one's independence is that one may not have allies when one needs them.I cannot argue that the Acadians weren't treated deplorably by not just one, but a whole series of governments, but Brasseux's admiration for their independence, cohesiveness, and dedication to ethnic identity wears thin after awhile.
A scholarly but very readable study of Acadia and Acadians in Louisiana.
Though the focus is their arrival, he include quite a bit of information about the founding of Acadia, Le Grand Dérangement including the circumstances of deportment and exile in the US colonies and in France, and the beginnings of Acadian Louisiana.

It would get a little dry with no personal connection—I glazed over a bit in the section on the development of the western plains settlements since we didn’t have people there—but there’s lots of great information and background for our Acadian family history.
