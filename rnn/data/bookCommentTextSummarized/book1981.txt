"'Is it Rilla my Rilla?'Yeth."
While it's wonderful to see characters evolve into adulthood and have a next generation come to life, the real strength of this book is it's window into the homeland society of rural Maritime Canada during the first World War. It's one of few documentations (even if the characters are fictional) of what women were doing at home during the war, and this setting breathes new life into the end of the series.
In general, Montgomery's work is constantly under-estimated, and the way the books are marketed doesn't help (the flowery script, the swoony illustrations).
This is the book that finally severed my relationship with Kevin Sullivan.
When Anne of Green Gables: The Continuing Story premiered in the early 2000s, I was shocked to discover that Anne and Gilbert were suddenly time warped to WWI.
On so many levels.WWI wasn't Anne's war, it was Rilla's, and Ken's, and Walter's, and that damn dog who turns me into a gushy mess every freaking time I read the last chapter.
Rilla -- the youngest child of Anne and Gilbert -- is fifteen (see what I mean about the time warp??) and desperately in love with the boy next door.
I have now read all eight books in the Anne of Green Gables series. Eight books that were an absolute pleasure to read. I like this one almost as much as the 1st one. It's the story of Anne's daughter Rilla, but it is set with the backdrop of World War I which has a huge influence on Anne's family. This story has a more serious tone than the other books but it is a fitting conclusion to a wonderful story.
"Before this war is over," he said - or something said through his lips - "every man and woman and child in Canada will feel it - you, Mary, will feel it - feel it to your heart's core.
Rilla, Anne's youngest child, grows from a rather spoiled fifteen-year-old into a caring and responsible young woman.
. .I enjoyed this visit into Anne's world, though there is an incident of religious nutjobbery - (view spoiler)[A young boy drowns his kitten in the hopes that his sacrifice will make God bring Jem back home safely.
This is probably my favorite of the Anne books. I love watching Rilla mature into a young woman, and I think the romance betwen Rilla and Ken Ford is one of the best in kidlit.
Now, I loved Anne. Don't get me wrong, but this book was on another whole level. I ADORED It. The heartbreak of ww1, the grown up Blythe family. . . I just loved everything about it.
Speaking of missing things, I have felt at times that Montgomery had Anne and Gilbert have a few more kids than she, the author, maybe should have.
Shirley got a bit more to do in this book than the last two (I honestly forgot he existed at times, in the last two books), but I never developed any particular attachment to him because all I knew about him was that Susan felt like a mother to him because she’d had to do so much for him when he was first born because Anne got so sick.
But, the fact that Walter knew what was coming and that he took the time to send Rilla his love and encourage her to keep fighting no matter what.
It was recently drawn to my attention by a fellow Goodreads reader that the editions of Rilla of Ingleside, for which we had become accustomed, are abridged versions of the original edition that L.M. Montgomery published.
In addition, the newly discovered and restored version(edited by Benjamin Lefebvre and Andrea McKenzie) includes: a glossary, a brief history of WWI and two war poems written by L.M. Montgomery.
Therefore, I do recommend that any L.M. Montgomery fan (or anyone who has not already discovered Rilla of Ingleside) pick up a copy of this edition immediately.
It's a dear friend :)***This is the most amazing, sweetest, heart-wrenching books I've read in my life.
I've read it at least ten times (maybe more ;)) and I love it every.
So read the whole series...and then just sigh with happiness, true bliss, when you read this one.Why I LOVE about this book:-The characters are whimsical and delightful.
I LOVE the last two sentences in the book and I quote them all the time (oh the calamity of lisping at the worst of times!!):"Is it Rilla-my-Rilla?""Yeth," said Rilla.-The setting.
I have fallen in love with the World War 1 setting (probably because of this book)!
It was with great relief and disappointment that I finally closed the last volume of the Anne series.
Rilla, cute as she is, was not featured as prominently as the title would suggest; nor was her love story.
A few thoughts on Anne.
About halfway through the series I realized that Anne was receding into motherhood and becoming nothing but a stolid matronly figure amongst more spirited beings.
She becomes sentimental and adored as a mother, but almost completely unrecognizable as the Anne we know and love.
Maybe what we love about Anne just doesn't translate into adulthood.
This series has had its ups and downs, but this one was worth all the pain.
Told from Rilla Blythe's point of view in diary format, we start in early 1914 and she is carefree, frivolous and worried about what hat she'll wear to the dance.
This book had everything I need and never knew I wanted from this series.
Rilla really stepped up to the plate with her antics and the raising of her war-baby Jims.
This book found a very harsh reality in that all the boys enlisted and poor Dog Monday sat at the train station waiting for his soldier to return.
This is a stand-out in the series for me, I love Rilla. If Dog Monday doesn't make you cry, I don't know what will. He breaks my heart every time.
Heartbreaking and beautiful. One of the few fiction books out there in World War I, and so worth it.
EEPOH BOI.This was so lovely, you guys. There are so many things... so many feels... *happy sigh*
The final book in the Anne of Green Gables series makes a solemn capstone to an amazing run.
My Dad bought me these books when I was little on the condition that I read all of them, and I've just now fulfilled that promise.Covering the duration of World War One, this book, along with Anne's House of Dreams, is definitely one of the saddest in the series.
Maybe not the same unburdened happiness that we used to have--but happiness nonetheless.Although the book dragged in parts (as I'm sure real life did in those times as people waited desperately for word of their loved ones at the western front), any book that so unapologetically forces me to read it in two days and makes me cry deserves five stars.
They’re not long books, and 8 might not sound like very many, but these are still technically classics and that would a good bit of classic reading in a row.
Rilla, Anne’s youngest, has her life radically altered just as she enters her fifteenth year.
There was also a faithful little dog who refused to leave the train station until his master came home from the war, which was a heartwarming addition.
But as I said earlier, there was a solemnity to this book not present (as often) in the others due the addition of war into the plot.
(view spoiler)[As it turns out, I couldn't have put this down even if I wanted to (not for lack of moments where I wished I'd never started this series, so there'd be no crying over beloved characters meeting an untimely death.
At one point, I put down my Kindle shouting "The end!").And yet, I couldn't stop reading.
All the signs pointed in his direction, and even if they hadn't, I knew he wouldn't survive this if only because he was my favourite.
(hide spoiler)]This was an absolutely superb ending to the series, and I am heartbroken.
کتاب آخر این مجموعه هر دفعه با روح و روان من بازی میکنهبه نظرم یکی از بهترین و ملموس ترین وصف حال هاییه که از دوران جنگ جهانی وجود داره. حقیقتا شاهکاری!والتر😭
And it's powerful, especially with the Centennial Commemoration of Armistice Day. The world changed and seeing the familiar, friendly world of Anne Shirley melting into the devastation of a century that saw global war is...haunting and hard.
This complaint is going to seem silly because this book is clearly Rilla's book (which I wouldn't change for anything; I think the story transitioning to the next generation is probably the only way to end Anne's series), BUT: I missed Anne Blythe nee Shirley in this.
HERE I MOURN.)(Truly and honestly: I think a book truly about "old married Anne Shirley" would be kind of fantastic??)Also read: 2006
My faaaaavorite Anne book--it focuses on her youngest child, Rilla, and it's set during WWI (the series is set in Canada, who entered the war with England, so it was a much longer and painful ordeal for them than for the US). Rilla is a silly young 15 year old when the war begins--by the end she's an amazing and strong woman. This book is wonderful! I'm regularly tearing up on my lunchbreak reading this one.
'Rilla of Ingleside' is my favourite of the 'Anne' series, it's even better than the internationally-beloved 'Anne of Green Gables'. That's my opinion, anyway! It features Rilla [short for Marilla:], Anne and Gilbert's youngest daughter, and her trials throughout WWI, when two of her brothers and the young man she cares for go off to war. Poignantly written, never dismissing hardship, heartbreak, love, and the more common of adolescent strifes such as rivalries and embarassments, 'Rilla of Ingleside' relaxes me everytime I read it and often makes me wish that if I were a fictional character, that I'd be her.
Rilla, the youngest of Gilbert and Anne Blythe' s children was flighty young thing when World War I started but the next four years made her into a responsible young woman. Most surprising of all is when she fosters a baby for the duration of the war. This is an heart-breaking and triumphant story of the Great War.
I'd like to know what Susan would say of FDR and to see how PEI would have reacted to events leading up to the bombing of Pearl Harbor.It was interesting that women only got the right to vote during the war and only women with husbands and sons could vote at that!
The poor girl didn't even know where she stood for 4 years.The lines that stood up and had me tearing long after the book was closed were Anne telling Susan to set the table for everyone, even the dear lad whose chair must always be vacant.
اما الان كه كتاب آخر را تمام كرده ام، ميبينم كه كوتاه تر از آن چيزى بود كه فكر مى كردم.كتاب آخر به يقين از سه كتابِ قبلى زيباتر بود.لحظه لحظه شريك شدن در حال و هواى خانواده اى كه سه پسرشان در جنگ جهانى اول شركت دارند.اضطراب، ترس، انتظار، انتظار،انتظار...دلم مى خواست در كتابِ آخر صحبت بيشترى از شخصيت ها و مكان هاى قبلى شود.از اونلى زيبا، ماريلاى عزيز كه حتى خبر فوتش را در يك جمله ى كوتاه خوانديم، از دياناى دوست داشتنى، از خانم ريچل ليند، از دوقلو ها و متيويى كه از اواخر كتاب اول تنهايمان گذاشت اما ياد و خاطره اش هميشه و هر لحظه در دل مخاطب بود.داستان از دختر يتيم موقرمزى كه اشتباهى به جاى يك پسر به اونلى فرستاده شده بود،شروع شد و با ازدواج آخرين فرزندش به پايان رسيد.دلم به اين ماجراهاى كوتاه و بامزه تنگ خواهد شد.
I'll never be able to express just how much I love LMM's writing...
She is, and will always be, my favourite author.This is a new favourite of mine in this series.
Nothing could ever replace Anne’s heart, but for the first time, this book meant so much to me.
Therefore, I cried many, many times while I was reading this one.
The hard reality of WWI seemed to be so well described that I experienced pain along with the characters I know and love.
I’d definitely recommend reading the entire series because this is a beautiful ending.
Sure, everyone seems to rave about it, and it was my best friend who (gently) pushed me into reading it...but I didn't expect to LOVE it.
I've read several of L.M. Montgomery's books now, and while I enjoy her writing style sometimes, overall it's not my thing, and by the time I got to Rilla of Ingleside -- the fourth book I'd read of hers in a year -- I was rather tired of it.
It's DEFINITELY my favorite Montgomery book, and probably the best book I've read about WWI.
Favorite things about Rilla of Ingleside: ~ Jem and Dog Monday.
Just as Rilla’s life is at the height of her enjoyment, it is announced that Britain has declared war on Germany, and will be fighting for the full four years of the First World War. This affects Rilla more than she imagines at first, and serves to alter her landscape entirely: ‘… as her brothers go off to fight in the Great War and Rilla brings home an orphaned newborn baby in a soup tureen, she is swept into a drama that tests her courage and will leave her changed forever.’Rilla of Ingleside starts in a charming way – ‘It was a warm, golden-cloudy, lovable afternoon’ – before it introduces the character of Susan Baker and the historical context which the story is set against: in the newspaper, she sees that ‘some Archduke Ferdinand or other had been assassinated at a place bearing the weird name of Sarajevo, but Susan tarried not over uninteresting, immaterial stuff like that; she was in quest of something really vital’.

My goal was to read the complete series in 2017. I think Rilla of Ingleside is my favorite Anne book. Anne books in favorite order:1. Rilla of Ingleside2. Anne of Green Gables3. Anne's House of Dreams4. Anne of Avonlea5. Anne of the Island6. Anne of Windy Poplars7. Anne of Ingleside8. Rainbow Valley
