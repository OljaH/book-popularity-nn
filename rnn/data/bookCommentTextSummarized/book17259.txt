Last chapter to read: Chapter 20I was having some second thoughts if I should continue this series. I love the plot but the art (I find) is not that great (maybe I've been spoiled by other manga artists). I might check out the anime though because Alucard is life.
I read the first volume and then watched the original anime.
After the character designs of the tv show, the art in the first volume made me nervous, but not nearly as much as I was dissatisfied by the ending of the tv anime.
So when I realized that the manga followed a completely different storyline after the first book, I was devouring the chapters online.
The OVAs certainly do it justice, for Hellsing fans who are, by loyalty, patient.
More years for the dub.
But the manga certainly stands distinct and is worth a full read.
Tonight I'd just watched this REALLY INTERESTING video about the artwork of Hellsing: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hL3m...My opinion on the Hellsing series: one of the best vampire manga out there!
I read the first eight volumes of this some time back—between one and four years ago—and the other day I noticed that volumes nine and ten were available, picked them up, and concluded the series.I suppose I have a love-hate relationship with Hellsing, and for two very obvious reasons.
On the side of love are Sir Integra Wingate Hellsing, the titular heroine of the series, a no-nonsense, hard-as-nails woman whom singlehandedly runs an organization devoted to keeping England free of freaks and monsters, and her primary servant, Alucard.
I absolutely love Hellsing, a little less by the end than in the beginning, but still five stars worth.
It is dark, gritty, gothic and just this side of insane.
The baddies are bad, but the hero is even worse.
Alucard is a psychotic, blood thirsty, vampire with a wry sense of morbid humor.
He truly revels in the carnage he creates.
Granted, Hellsing does take some getting used to.
It's a manga, but set in England, the body count is extremely high, and there is enough blood to drown it.
But if you like dark manga, it is worth reading.
Acabo de encontrar entre mis cachivaches mi OVA de Hellsing. Si, lo estoy viendo luego de haber visto el animé por el 2005 en Animax. Tan kawaii no puedo ser!! No recordaba lo bueno que estaba, me encantaba Seres como policía, y su relación con Alucard 😍. Las noches que habré pasado en Fanfiction y en el foro de FMA con mi amiga Dany escribiendo fanfics...
I would read anything and everything to do with vampires, whether the content was good (Bram Stoker's Dracula), boring (L.J. Smith's Vampire Diaries), or so bad that its awfulness has now become the general consensus (Twilight)....I also went through a particularly embarrassing manga phase around then.I don't quite remember how I got my paws on Hellsing, but I do know that once I did, I was hooked.
Naturally, Seras chooses to live.Thanks to her new supernatural predicament, Seras is drafted in as a soldier for the Hellsing organization and placed under Alucard's tutelage.Now the plot's got going, Kohta Hirano keeps it trundling along at the same pace, throwing in these amazing fights, bits of dialogue, bat-shit characters, and it all works very well.
The main character, Alucard (Dracula cleverly spelled backwards), is used to kill other supernatural creatures, and makes Seras Victoria (a cop he shoots to kill another vampire) into a vampire early on in the series and we get to watch her deal with her new life as a blood drinker with some hilarious (and sometimes creepy results).I love vampires, so it's not much of a surprise that I like Hellsing, a series based around vampires and supernatural organizations.
No one likes a fat vampire.For more manga and anime reviews, please check out Hobotaku.
I liked Kohta Hirano’s manga HELLSING. The manga is about the story of Alucard and his vampire hunting adventure. The story is based in England. It is about a vampire named Alucard. He is a vampire hunter who kills other vampires to stop the human race from going extinct. I really liked the part when Alucard fights the Paladin because the action is very entertaining. I would recommend this book to the manga readers because as a manga reader I really liked this book
I liked it, but the subtle (well sometimes not...) sexual themes bothered me too much. And I mean, really - Nazi vampires? And OF COURSE the Catholics are portrayed negatively. I'd say read it if you're wanting bloody and visceral action. Or you could just read it for Alucard; he's the ultimate badass. I really love the art style later on in the chapters. It it's so refined. You don't really get good vampire manga (in my opinion), and Hellsing is one of the better ones. The only other one I'd recommend is Vampire D Bloodlust.
He's got some really bitchin' shoulder pads! Bizarre, fun manga starring Celes Victoria, a virgin girl who is turned into a vampire by Alucard (Dracula in reverse). Great art and storyline as the mastah and his fledgling chase after bloodsuckers in the name of Integral, Alucard's master. STAND YOUR GROUND, POLICEWOMAN!!
Hilarity, funny bits, a kick ass vampire.
The first few chapters are definitely a mix of introduction (first volumes tend to do this), and almost side-stories before an actual plot turns up.
The plot throughout the volume is also pretty basic, and is a bit of that monster of the week/shonen style.
What I mean by this is that the fight scenes tend to go a certain way, pretty continually.
Hence the joke: "I liked it better when it was called DragonBall Z!"Nicely drawn fighting scenes, though.
Funny, action packed, and just plain good old shonen fight scenes and arcs to get your blood pumping.
Hellsing is an british organization who hunts vampires, ghouls, etc.
Their best agent is Alucard, who is also a vampire, but not in the traditional way.
The Chief is a woman, Integra, who was the one who practically saved Alucard in the past...
or at least, brought him to life again.While Alucard was hunting some vampires, he met a virgin, Victoria, and to saave her, he had to turn her into a vampire.
What I like: they have a woman as the Head of the organization, and it looks she is fierce and brave.
In general, all looks good, but the girls look like man, especially Integra.

La trama me parece muy interesante por el hecho de que sea un vampiro Nosfeartu ´´Rey No Vivo ´ que mate a algunos de su propia especie y sirva a los humanos , pero no el mata falsos vampiros , y ghouls que son parecidos a los zombis pero mas inteligentes y capaces de manejar armas , al contrario que un zombi que no puede y no tienen jefes ya que solo piensan en comer .
Espero que a medida que avance la trama en los siguientes tomos sepamos mas del pasado de Alucard .
Having enjoyed the anime for Hellsing, for the most part, I picked up the manga with a bit of excitement.
I felt cheated when I finished.It's not that the anime for Hellsing is any better, it's that I had many problems with the dialogue through the manga.
I'm not sure if this is the manga-ka's fault or the translator's fault.The art and characters that I could understand weren't bad.
It's almost inviting horror fans into the pages.The art and characters weren't enough to save the manga for me, though.
Un tomo bastante entretenido dentro de lo que cabe que tiene chispazos de calidad pero deja aunadas bastantes expectativas que se quedan asfixiadas en la creatividad del autor .
Kohta Hirano tiene una calidad de dibujo bastante buena , realista e impresionante a detalle , pero su calidad para narrar historias deja mucho que desear por todo el relleno argumental que a veces no aporta nada .
La idea esta bastante interesante de crear algo nuevo para el mito del vampirismo , estos seres deseosos de sangre para llenar sus inquebrantables fauces que buscan el poder .
The primary protagonist--Alucard--is a vampire who has joined (is controlled by?) the Hellsing organization, an explicitly British and protestant monster hunting organization.
Conflicts are set up immediately with a similar secret monster hunting organization run by the Vatican.
that could produce future story arcs that go belong monster of the week stories are welcome.
If they were this intense today we'd still be fighting the religious wars of extermination that Europe went through during the reformation and counter-reformation and the years just following that period.
Still, there's enough good to make it worth following further.
I've been wanting to read this manga for a while, since I first saw it on the shelf.
It's a weird concept, that a Japanese manga would be set in London and Europe.
The Scottish (?) accent of one of the priests was a bit difficult to read.
However, the storyline was fairly streamlined and kept the confusion to a minimum.The author's comments (both in text and the afterward note) were usually something I was thinking that prevented me from loving this: the gender confusion, all the chacters having glasses (making it difficult to tell them apart) and also having similar costumes.
There's a secret organization somewhere in England created to defend the Queen and country from monsters of all sorts.
Yes, it's hard to believe in this day and age...
but really, isn't this the true age of monsters?
Enter Hellsing, an agency, long in tooth, with the experience, know-how, and...
equipment to handle the problems that arise when vampires, ghouls, and the like take on these dark forces.
"What equipment?" you may say.
How about another vampire, and a big pistol loaded with special silver bullets?
That oughta do the trick.
First read this in high school, I believe. Just as good the second time around. An excellent translation, fast paced story, and interesting characters. I remember the series becoming increasingly political, which got boring, but maybe I'll like it better this time around.I don't think it was necessary for Hirano to write out Anderson's Irish accent - that was a bit of a pain, but I was able to read it anyway.The stylized violence is interesting.
El hecho de ponerme a leer manga es algo intenso, mas por que debido a que es un tipo de lectura diferente al hecho de tener mas de doscientas paginas llenas de palabras. Siempre me a gusta Hellsing, el anime y las ovas son geniales, ya solo me faltaba leer el manga. Y aun que el tomo fue muy rápido, de verdad me gusto.
Basically, it's 'Hellboy' done as manga and replacing Hellboy with a really bad ass vampire. Very dark, violent and creepy, but at the same time very clever, and funny.The relationship between Alucard and his protege is interesting, and I love the over top feuding between the two secret religious groups. Great visual style to this manga that has quickly become one of my favorites.
I normally don't read manga, but I really enjoyed this one. I also watched the anime series that goes with this. It's very good. Extremely violent, but good. You gotta love "Alucard" the main vampire character. (Dracula backwards)
Claro que este ainda é um volume introdutório, sem grandes lutas, porém, o sádico vampiro Alucard é sempre divertido de ver, em animé ou mangá.
Filled with plenty of action and gore. A little cheesy ay times but I love what Kohta has done with the Dracula mythos. >:3
Simply fantastic
couldn't fully identify which character was which and some of the action scene motions were a little confusing because of this.
While I am aware that terrorists groups like ISIS do use Islam as a cover up (no such behaviour is actually even condoned in Islam), it was a little disturbing that this scene was followed by some assassins (merely undercover as a nun and a priest) 'exterminating' these terrorists and having righteous speech bubbles about Catholicism and basically how it is a strong religion because it has a sturdy foundation of having executed many pagans and heathens....how is that any better?
This is quite an interesting idea, and since these kinds of books are quick reads, I gave it a try.
I was favorably impressed.As a young child, like many I grew up with comic books.
My impression, however, is that the illustrations are compelling and that the story is unusual and darkly fun.
Most of my childhood illustrated comics avoided graphic illustrations, but since this is black-and-white there's no disturbing red to bother sensitive readers.
Since my blog (Sects and Violence in the Ancient World) often addresses vampires and other monsters, I wrote a short piece of my experience reading this book there.
Overall review aja deh.
Saya nikmatin manga ini tanpa masang logika, tp itu bukan hal yg buruk.
Ceritanya kalo boleh jujur ya ga bagus2 banget, banyak inkonsistensi dan kegajean bertebaran.
Saya udah masbod sama motivasi si major, kedangkalan seras, dan vlad the impaler yg cuma disinggung sedikit.
Paling keganggu sama vampir nazi yg mo nyerang inggris dan katolik nyerang protestan.
WTF?
Tp biarin deh.
Kayaknya kegajean itu malah nambah rasa ke manganya.
Visualisasinya cukup keren, terutama makin ke belakang.
Saya suka gore-nya, keabsurdan kekuatan Alucard, dan badass-nya si vampir.
Alucard mgkin tokoh terbadass #1 versi saya.
Sayang di vol.
İngiltere'de Van Hellsing ailesinin kurduğu hortlaklar, zombiler, canavarlar ve vampirlere karşı faaliyet gösteren Kraliyet Protestan Şövalyeler örgütü Hellsing Teşkilatı'nın en güçlü silahı gizemli vampir uzmanı Alucard'ın maceraları. Bir yandan Hellsing Teşkilatı'nın Vatikan'a bağlı Özel Kuvvetler'den 13. Bölüm İskaryot ile yaşadığı gerilimler... Diğer yandan Alucard'ın ölümden döndürmek için ısırıp vampire çevirdiği "Polis Kız" Seras Victoria ile olan "hastalıklı" ilişkisi...Bir aksiyon mangası için herşeyin yerli yerinde olduğunu söylemek lazım. Tabi vampirlerin dört döndüğü bir dünyanın bu kadar kan ile kaplı olması da şaşırtıcı değil.
