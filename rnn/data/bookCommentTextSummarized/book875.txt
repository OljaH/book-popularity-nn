The play is interesting but a little hard to follow since there's no description of what is happening. I did enjoy hearing about different parts of Lincoln's life from his perspective and that of those close to him.It's strange but interesting to listen to an audio book with so many narrators, but it works well in the play format.I received a free copy of this book from the author and/or narrator and/or publisher in exchange for an honest review.
Maybe this kind of thing was stylish in 1919. It's a collage of Lincoln quotes, Lincoln adoration, self-conscious emphasis on the "Great Emancipator" image and sloppy political mash-ups. Drinkwater puts Lincoln's real words in his mouth, out of context, and also in the mouths of others, out of context. It's an historical curiosity, not a serious historical treatment. Interesting to own it, no fun to read it.More athttp://richardsubber.com/
