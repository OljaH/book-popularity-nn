Rank's work on the double was reworked on a number of occasions, but was originally released in 1914 and influenced Freud's 1919 essay on the uncanny.
Rank does an interesting reading of different 19th century writers to show how the concept of the double is prevalent in writers as diverse as Edgar Allen Poe, ETA Hoffman, Dostoyevsky, Jean Paul, Heine, Alfred de Musset and others.
Rank, like Freud, seems to avoid any attempt to engage with women writers and their use of the double.
For Rank the double seems a spiritual problem which he then links to Narcissism, thanatophobia and suicide.
Quite useful to add texture to the atmos into which Freud sent his "The Uncanny," but on its own not especially energizing. Still, people who write on doubles should have palindrome names.
A fascinating early work of psychoanalysis on the divided self, neurosis, and paranoia, written by a man who was himself paranoid, neurotic, and divided. Rank said elsewhere that paranoia was a symptom of latent homosexuality, and of course he was allegedly that, too. I wish I owned a copy (good luck!) because even though it's been ten years or so since I read it, I remember it being engaging, short, and eminently quotable.
Excelente estudio acerca de la idea del doble a partir de distintas obras literarias. El estudio psicológico enrededor de la idea del doble es exhaustivo. Lectura muy recomendable en es especial para psicologos o estudiantes de psicología, de hecho Otto Rank fue uno de los discíplos de Sigmund Freud.
I'm not sure that "like" really applies to this book, which is a discussion of the psychoanalytic concept of the double, using primarily German literature. The slim volume certainly provided a lot of food for thought. I enjoyed the book.
