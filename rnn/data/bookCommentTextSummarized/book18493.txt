Everything We Keep is an extremely long-winded "getting over someone" story, complete with the logistics of opening a cafe and a boring romance.
It's like After You, except it doesn't follow on from a book that was actually good.Aimee Tierney's fiancee, James, dies during a boating accident in Mexico.
I cannot believe how many pages I sat through of Aimee talking about food and art and maybe opening a cafe and how she could date if she wanted to but she's not ready to let go of James.
I lost count of how many times she blushed.How much do you want to read a slow tale of cafe management?
My thoughts and feelings were a constant ebb and flow.
One minute I was enjoying the story and the next I couldn’t stop rolling my eyes.
I'll admit there were some great moments mixed in, things that made me swoon, but they were overshadowed by the things that felt too convenient.
Too unnatural.My biggest issue with the entire story was Aimee.
And again, I’m back to Aimee’s decision making.
All in an attempt to enjoy the moment?
To focus.I feel like the majority of the plot rested on convenience.
I would have appreciated a bit more development.
There were some highly predictable elements, but many things that also surprised me.
The what didn't surprise me as much as the why did, if that makes any sense.The story centers on Aimee, a lady that finds herself burying her fiancé on what should've been their wedding day.
Add to that a self-proclaimed psychic that keeps seeking Aimee out and telling her that James is very much alive, and you've got a big mystery.As Aimee works her way through the clues, she discovers far more than she bargained for.
In the end, I have to say I can't remember reading another story quite like it.All in all, I thought it was a good story.
After numerous glowing reviews prepublication, in addition to publishing 2 more books in the upcoming year, I think it’s safe to say that Kerry is here to stay.
Sure, the story is intriguing and suspenseful, the cover art is pretty, and the book wasn’t too long nor too short, but these characters and their development over a period of many years are what sealed the deal for my ride alongside.
Sure the pages were flying and the content wasn’t exactly fluffy, but it still felt lighter than most mysteries and crime fiction dealing with the same type of story.
There was this Carolyn Hax advice column a while back where a man complained that he’d found out that a woman he’d dated had been calling other women “basic britches” on Facebook.
(https://live.washingtonpost.com/carol...) And I thought, that is the dumbest thing I’ve ever heard; who actually says “basic britches”.
This book is basic britches.
She is… the least interesting woman in the world.
New World fusion (said completely unironically).
If a Thomas Kincaid painting has ever made you tear up a little, this book is for you.
Someone reading this is saying, “A Thomas Kincaid painting HAS made me tear up a little, you hipster asshole”.
However, twenty-six year old Aimee's wedding day has turned into a nightmare.
Wrong Ceremony"Meeting when they were eight years old, Aimee and James were first best friends then childhood sweethearts.
And what does this stranger know about what happened?Will Aimee be able to move on without James or will she be pulled back into the past?
We get to see just how James and Aimee's friendship started and developed over the years through flashbacks.
I can't imagine how heart breaking it would be losing someone and burying them on what was supposed to be your wedding day.
I was intrigued and really wanted to know what happened to James.
Preposterous. Absolutely preposterous. While I rate books on goodreads, this is the first time I have felt compelled to actually write a review and it is because this book is just so darn awful. The storyline is absurd, the characters are extremely one dimensional, the plot is contrived and the writing is so poor. A fellow reviewer commented that the writing seemed to be that of an 8th grader - I think she was being generous there! I grimaced my way through the book. I can't even recommend it as a fast, fun beach read, it is just that bad!
I should really begin this review by saying that I don't read a lot of mysteries or thrillers.
As in, I just had to create a "mystery-thriller" shelf for this book, because I didn't have one.
Recently I watched the movie The Girl on the Train instead of reading the book, because, like I said, I don't read mysteries or thrillers and therefore I didn't want to devote a dozen hours to something I might just end up hating.
And so I decided to gobble up as many mysteries and thrillers with intriguing blurbs from our local used book store that I could carry.
This might be the dumbest book I've ever read but damn it I couldn't put it down.
This book...I'm not sure how to review it.
I mean, I didn't exactly hate it, but at the same time I kinda did.
I'm not sure that makes any sense, but it's how I feel.It started out well enough, and then about 2/3 of the way through, it just got so convoluted.
The writing was uneven, sometimes it flowed really nicely, and at other times it was really choppy.
Once she did, all these hidden secrets came tumbling out, mostly via flashback, and it was just...so quick.Had the book ended before the epilogue, I'd have probably been a bit more generous and rated it three stars.
I'll stop there because some of the other inconsistencies are related to the "surprise" ending.Second, the book frustrates the reader because the characters spend so much time "waiting" instead of "doing." For example, the primary character of the story waits for over a year before she does something to discover what befell the most important person in her life.
When it comes down to it, the writer would have been much better off to offer up a 20 page short story for her "clever ending." It would have had as much impact, and the reader would have been more satisfied with the quick conclusion.
I was fortunate enough to receive an advance copy of EVERYTHING WE KEEP and wow. I inhaled it in two sittings while my life went on hold. It's hard to decide what I enjoyed most: Aimee's journey, the author's style (no words wasted), the suspense elements, the twists (yes, there's more than one), the psychological bent, the romance… It's a thumping good read, a perfect book club pick, and one of those gems people pass around with, "You don't need to know anything about the plot. Just read it and then we'll talk."
so you go have a couple of drinks at the hotel, and then take a stroll to the place you think he will be?
Hell no, you take a cab from the airport directly there.2 - the whole book she just can't understand what could have happened, then at the end she recounts a conversation she overheard where he was talking about bringing in the DEA or dealing with things himself.
If she is just a person, what a convenient coincidence that she was part of Ian's early life and then shows up for Aimee.In summary, a lot of things in this book just made me shake my head.
Took one for the team. #bookclub
In Everything We Keep, Lonsdale’s protagonist, Aimee is forced to attend her fiancé’s funeral on what was supposed to be her wedding day.
James died tragically a few weeks before in a boating accident in Mexico.
But as Aimee starts to rebuild her life, she can’s shake the feeling that James may not be dead.
When some of his paintings mysteriously goes missing, and then appear in a gallery in a beach town in Mexico, she risks everything she’s gained in her new life to find out the truth.
Is her first love still alive, or is she simply holding on to the past.
This book read like a Mary Higgins Clark novel or the written version of a Lifetime movie. Some of the scenes are so cheesy that I found myself rolling my eyes. The so-called talented photographer shoots sunrises and sunsets which sounds a bit cliché. Also, when talking about artist styles the author mentions Monet and Kincaid in the same sentence. I'm pretty sure that's blasphemy. Anyway, despite all of that, I enjoyed this book and was curious to see what would happen next.
I'm supposed to believe in this overwhelming love Aimee had for her dead fiancé, but even after hearing he might be alive the day of his funeral, she waits a year to start to investigate?
And Ian - a gorgeous, successful photographer - falls instantly in love with Aimee and is willing to put his job on hold to be a barista in her café and is satisfied with being friends for a year?!
By 40% in, Aimee had gasped so often and/or become breathless in one way or another that I began to suspect she had asthma.
Leaving her unsettled she delves deeper into James disappearance uncovering secrets and lies that make her question everything about their life together.A wonderful debut novel that I didn't want to put down until I turned the very last page.
And then I wanted more!Ms. Lonsdale gives us a unique storyline, a mystery full of twists and turns and an "OMG" epilogue that I didn't see coming at all.Thank you to NetGalley and Lake Union Publishing for an arc of this novel in exchange for my honest review.
Oh dear heavens above.
This book was not well written AND the plot was totally ridiculous.
I gave the author a star for completing her first novel and me a star for completing the danged thing.
I'll start with the overwrought writing which stopped me in my tracks.
"Cold here.""Then reality let itself into the room, and the euphoria of last night's lovemaking dissipated like water on a hot griddle.
I'd betrayed my feelings for James.
I'd betrayed myself."Then there's the plot which tries so hard.
Why is everyone trying to write another twisty plot like Girl on the Train?
James' situation was absurd.
I need to stop.
On our wedding day, my fiancé, James, arrived at the church in a casket. Holy bananas, what a book!!I liked it since I have read the opening sentence. In the middle I was just curious but by the end breathless with anticipation. After first chapter I knew what kind of story it will be, but the resolution was way to different than I expected. I would like to say, that I need sequel (you just cannot end it with such a prologue, Kerry!), but it would ruin the mystery I would like to keep. If you l

If you like mystery thrillers, add this to your TBR.***	I received a free copy from the publisher through NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.
First off, thanks to Kerry for sending me an early copy of her book! WOW! Just wow! This book grabs you with the first sentence & takes you on a roller coaster ride til the very end! I loved every word & couldn't read it fast enough! Don't miss this book!
با اسم تمام خاطراتی که نگه میداریم. اول از همه اصلا نمیدونم چرا همه چیز تبدیل شده به همه خاطرات؟😐دوم اینکه واقعا فکر میکنم نویسنده هیچ ایده ای از نویسندگی،داستان پردازی،تخیلات و ... نمیدونه وگرنه کتابی به این مزخرفی(با عرض پوزش)هیچ جور دیگه ای قابل توجیه نیست.شخصیت های غیر قابل باور،داستان مسخره و تخیلات بی جای نویسنده :| واقعا بهم بگید چجوری ۴ستاره گرفته؟ شایدم من خیلی بد سلیقه شدم؟که بعید میدونم :))))
Wow!
The twists and turns in this book had me on the edge of my seat.
I couldn't put it down.
I was invited to read Everything we Keep via Netgalley.
Romance novels are my usual read, but I try to avoid sad stories.
Her family sold her future job, and her husband to be is going to be buried on her wedding day.
This book is about the future you didn't see coming.
Fantastic suspense novel with romance and mystery.
5 stars out of 5.Everything We Keep is a must read!*Netgalley readers copy given in exchange for a fair review*
I really wanted to like this book.
If you have ever suffered a terrible loss, the kind of loss that Kerry portrayed (best friends for over or about 20 years, lover, partner, fiance), then, if there is the slightest chance, that the person is alive, you will explore it; no matter how slim, no matter how insane you might look.
It took Aimee 19 months to get on a plane and walk to the gallery!
And Aimee just walked away.
And then James' friends?
It was almost like they didn't want him to be alive.
Sous chef Aimee Tierney  has been planning a perfect wedding and perfect life with her childhood sweetheart James Donato (Donato Enterprises -import/export business).
They owed too much money on the business.Over the years,  while she helped her mom craft new recipes for the restaurant, James painted, and his talent and their friendship flourished turning into much more.
Until those went away, it wouldn’t be fair to let Ian assume she wanted anything more than friendship.After fourteen months since James left for Mexico and one year since she buried him, Aimee’s search leads her to Mexico, with clues from the mysterious psychic, and the art gallery post card from Mexico.
But unfortunately, I always struggle when things become far-fetched, and by the time Aimee decided to look into James' disappearance this was really adding up one contrived development after another.
I had a difficult time connecting with Aimee.
Of all the possible places and times, why would she behave towards Ian the way she did when they were in Mexico?
If people close to someone would discover what Aimee discovered in Mexico would they really react so blasé about it all?
Aimee's and James' friends and family?
Every time I thought I knew where this story was going, a few pages later, Kerry Lonsdale threw me for a loop and I knew I was wrong!
Kerry Lonsdale is now one of my auto buy authors.The twists and turns in EVERYTHING WE KEEP are going to keep you up late into the night trying to figure it out.
There is so much going on in this story, but Kerry Lonsdale does a wonderful job of weaving all the pieces together.
Once you finish devouring this story, you are going to want to tell everyone you know about this awesome book.
Aimee is a woman with her whole life ahead of her when she finds out her fiancé has been found dead.
After she buries him a woman comes to her and tells her that James isn’t dead and that she can find out where he is?
But is that the truth or is this woman leading her on and lying?Over the course of 2 years Aimee must find herself and find out who she really is without James.
She has friends and family to help her along the way but she must venture to the ends of the earth to find who she really is.
It definitely leaves you contemplating all the “what ifs” in life.Like some other debut novelists I’ve read books from recently, Kerry Lonsdale also comes off as someone who seems like they already wrote a few novels prior to this one.
I definitely recommend this book as I want to discuss it with as many people as possible.
I know it is going to be talked (and raved) about for quite some time.I had a hard time casting the lead (and some secondary) roles, but hope my choices will work.
The book's synopsis promised an exploration of loss, and I indeed feel devastated for the time I lost. As the book suggests, if after a few chapters you're not feeling it, don't be afraid to let go.
