I just wish that Draupadi's feelings for Krishna and Karna had been toned down a bit, to show that illicit thoughts or affairs are not the only way for a woman to empower herself.Despite this, I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in either women's issues or grand epics.
I wanted to read it again as soon as I finished it, and I have a feeling I will never think of the Mahabharata in the same way again.

“A woman is not a touch but a response to it” ----Pratibha RayChitra Banerjee Divakaruni, an Indian best selling novelist, has penned an extremely emotional and gripping mythological-cum-historical-fiction novel, The Palace of Illusions that narrates the great epic Indian mythological tale, Mahabharata from the point of view of the most brilliant and fearless female character, Draupadi, who weaves her thoroughly soul touching yet enduring life story starting from the day she was born to the day she left her palace and kingdom to follow behind the footsteps of her husbands to heaven.
Just a petty complaint:I'm in the middle of this book and have a strong enough sense of the story to be able to make a heart felt plea: enough of the blatant foreshadowing!
I know it's a petty complaint for a story that is so grand and epic as a retelling of the Mahabharat.
It seems more of a reflection of how the author views her own writing abilities - as if she does not trust her skill at being able to work the story delicately, subtlely, and weave it carefully so there need not be so graphic statements that constantly thread an ominous and foreboding feeling throughout the whole book.
Dan ramalan tersebut menjadi kenyataan.Dia dilahirkan dari api bersama kembarannya Drestadumnya, demi membalaskan dendam sang Ayah yang bersitegang dengan sahabat lamanya Drona.
Atas nama kehormatan, para pria lebih rela bertarung habis-habisan dan merenggut nyawa yang pernah mereka kasihi.Atas nama kehormatan seorang ibu membuang bayi pertamanya ke sungai Gangga.Atas nama kehormatan Amba kembali pada Bisma, dan mengucap sumpah dendam.Atas nama kehormatan pula Drupadi terikat sumpah yang akan membawanya pada sebuah perang besar.Kenapa aku suka sama buku Palace of Illusions ini?
The narrative is telling of the life and travails of Draupadi, the woman who was born out of fire, married to five of the fiercest warriors of her time (the Pandavas), the queen who ruled one of the most magical of palaces, one who refused to learn the lessons her friend, Krishna, a God incarnate, taught her, a woman who was obsessed with vengeance, and spurned by the world for having been the cause of the great battle of Mahabharta, the battle that saw clans obliterated, and millions dead.Through smart dialogue, the author cleverly etches out the character of Draupadi, careening a bit as she does this, from how this character has been portrayed in other versions of this epic tale, giving her faults and imperfections, likes and dislikes, loves and hates just as us humans (thus delineating her from the conditions surrounding her unnatural birth).
'The Palace of Illusions' by Chitra Banerjee Divakaruni is really a book worth reading!
I think its a must read for people who have an interest in the rich literary heritage of India.
The author has beautifully summed up longest epic (Mahabharata) in around 360 pages.
The story is narrated from the view point of a very important female character in Mahabharata, Panchali.
This, I felt, is very unique.
This book has added a very interesting touch to the epic.
The book begins with 'fire' and ends with 'fire'.
I thoroughly enjoyed reading the book.
A retelling of the Mahabharata from Draupadi's point of view sounds like it has much potential -- but this attempt is let down by trying to encompass all of the epic, and bringing in the stories of almost all the characters, instead of staying faithful to Draupadi's (feminist) viewpoint. Making it a half-baked encapsulation, instead of a re-interpretation.
I am really happy I picked up this book.I was truly bored of Mahabharata retellings and I never intended to read more of those.I am glad I do for this book is a MUST READ.Written from Draupadi's perspective, the book is just too good. Written beautifully with praiseworthy story telling, this book wouldn't disappoint you.
Kaget juga karena di usia saya yang sekarang, kurang lebih 20 tahun lewat sejak pertama kali mengenal tokoh Pandawa lima, ternyata saya masih mengingat garis besar kisah Mahabrata ini Istana khayalan benar-benar membuat saya berkhayal jauh, seakan-akan saya ikut berada dalam Hastinapura, ikut bersimpati dengan Dropadi dan tanpa saya sadari, ketawa sendiri mendengar celetukan Dropadi yang ngasal juga.
Salah satu kalimat Bima yang saat ini saya jadikan status di fesbuk, “Tanpa kau di sisiku, untuk apa ada kerajaan?” Huwaah manis sekali, siapa yang sangka kalimat seromantis ini datang dari Bima?Kalau Arjuna sih tidak banyak diceritakan di sini, terlebih lagi Nakula dan Sadewa.
Why I bother with this author when book after book has been nothing but ...
It is every book in one book and to take on the task of retelling the story from the perspective of Draupadi is the literary equivalent of hitting a jackpot of an idea.
The author doesn't lack an impressive vocabulary or expression, and so I struggle to understand why this book reads more like a drugstore paperback and less like a retelling of classic literature.
In a nutshell, read it if, like me, you are a real Mahabharata-phile but not really otherwise.
“Above us our palace waits, the only one I've ever needed. Its walls are space, its floor is sky, its center everywhere. We rise; the shapes cluster around us in welcome, dissolving and forming again like fireflies in a summer evening.”   ONE HUSBAND? Too mainstream.  Five is the magic number. It's really unfair that I can marry only one guy.
I read this book merely because I wanted to know if the author would break such common notions and I commend the author for choosing Draupadi as her first person narrative.
I even considered to stop reading the book after this:“We two old women,” she said, smiling from beneath that ambiguous blindfold, “have much to talk about that you youngsters wouldn't understand.” I hadn't thought Kunti would agree—Gandhari's sons had, after all, tried to kill hers.
After all, who better to talk about the rights of women than Draupadi?’All this time I'd believed in my power over my husbands.
Seorang wanita yang akan mengubah jalannya sejarah.Drupadi yang menikah bukan dengan orang yang dicintainya, walaupun dia dengan terpaksa menikah dengan kelima Pandawa bersaudara, ternyata lima orang tidak bisa menutupi kekosongan hatinya yang mendambakan seseorang yang berada di kasta di bawahnya, seorang anak laki-laki dari seorang kusir kereta.Memang begitulah hidup apa yang kita inginkan gak selalu kita dapatkan, begitu pun Drupadi menjalani hidupnya hanya sekedar menjalani takdir yg sudah tertulis oleh yang maha kuasa, dan bahkan sudah bisa dituliskan Byasa sang peramal di dalam kitabnya.
Akulah dia.Fajar merekah bagimu seperti juga bagiku.Keempat: Catatan penulis yang mengantarkan saya masuk ke zaman dimana kisah Mahabharata di mulai.Yup, Divakaruni sukses menulis kembali kisah agung Mahabharata dengan menggunakan sudut pandang Drupadi.
Kedekatannya dengan Krishna dan yang terpenting perasaannya saat menyaksikan perang yang melibatkan semua orang yang Ia kasihi di Kurukshetra.Sangat mengasyikan memandang Pandawa dari pikiran Drupadi, mereka terlihat manusiawi di mata saya.
Sehingga saya ikut merasakan apa yang dirasakan dari setiap tokoh yang ada dalam kisah ini.
Karma, what you get is what you giveDan, akan selalu ada Krishna dalam setiap kehidupan kita :-)NB: Kalau yang penasaran dengan kisah Mahabharata tapi berat untuk membacanya.
A fantastic read.
Except for that twist in Draupadi's love life it would have been perfect.
The stories of Mahabharatha were a part of my growing up.
But i had never paused to think about what the people involved really felt and thought.
So it was a surprise to read about Draupadi's feelings in her own words.
What did a woman who was born from fire think about herself.
All the characters have been shown in shades of grey true to the original Mahabharatha.
Loved the narration.
Will be sure to read more of Devakaruni.
Beautifully written and captivating... And the stories... Ah, the stories... They reminded me of the reason I've always loved indian mythology. This was a really satisfying book.
This book will be best appreciated only by those who have a knowledge of the Mahabharatha - the vast Indian epic full of intrigue, mysteries, magic, politics, family obligations and the strife for attaining the Kuru throne by two set of cousins - the good Pandavas (5 brothers with one common wife - Draupadi and hoardes of seperate other wives) as opposed to hundred brothers and one sister (the cruel and immoral Kauravas, though the sister is innocent of any crime or intrigue).
I really loved the story of Mahabharatha via Draupadi (or Panchali) as the medium.
How can you tell an ancient story in new light? And how can you tell it to a generation, who as children have literally grown up with this story, and as adults will have high expectations of it? Chitra Bannerjee Divakaruni has the answer in The Palace of Illusions.The story of Mahabharata is nothing new to me. A kingdom greater than any - cousins fighting for the throne - sacrifices, promises, boons, curses - war - bereavement - atonement. An epic. The Mahabharata is an elaborate story, which c
Chitra Bannerjee Divakaruni has the answer in The Palace of Illusions.The story of Mahabharata is nothing new to me.
The Mahabharata is an elaborate story, which can be perceived from any character's point-of-view and still have a rich storytelling experience.
How Chitra ji manages to walk the fine line between the old and new interpretations of the character of a 'strong woman' is beyond me!
I mean, I have never heard of Draupadi's love story in the original.
And that is the most inspiring part of Panchaali's story for me.CHITRA'S WONDERFUL STORYTELLING:The author/poet has a way with words.
I wish I could give her a hug, if she was alive.Sometimes (all of the time when I develop interest in the book), I tend to get very attached to certain characters and can barely think about anything else for days.
With so much depth and so much soul, he has easily become one of my favorite characters of all time.
My ultimate hope is that readers of this book, regardless of age or gender, will be inspired by Karan’s and will be encouraged to make unselfish sacrificial choices and lay down one’s life for others, in big and small ways.With so much soul and emotion, everything crafted together, it is near impossible to read this book without being affected momentously.
How can it be, as Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie rightly pointed out, that our stories are not a compilation of heterogeneous narratives?
Our narratives are lessons for us to surmise on the basic effervescence of our lives.
The Palace of Illusions paints the other side of a story.
Contrary to the prevailed portraiture of Panchaali as a victimized women, this saga establishes her as a fierce and rebellious person, who, in lieu to the prophecies of her birth, seeks to prepare herself for the greater task.The aura of the book is that of mystery and foreboding.
I think Divakurani's short stories are genius-but she ought to lay off the novels. The book wasn't terrible, but there were some ATROCIOUS anachronisms sprinkled throughout and the heavy handed feminism was a bit much. It definitely gained in narrative voice as the plot progressed. Interesting read, but wait for the paperback, or get it out of the library.
As much as I admire how the author managed to squash such a giant epic into such a small space, I wish it had been a little longer, or at least that the second half had devoted a little more focus to Panchaali's interior life.Also--and this is why I say I like "almost" all the choices the novel makes about her character--the chapters about her childhood spend a lot of time talking about how she's rebellious and inquisitive, she doesn't understand why women can't do everything men can, she isn't like those other vapid girls at court, etc.
But these women are merely victims of their consequences in the stories.
When one has bestowed such a great honour on women making them catalysts of catastrophe, giving their point of view a thought is probably the minimum courtesy that one can do.
Why did Draupadi not stop Duryodhan from succumbing to the mischief of 'The Palace of Illusions'?In the book, Panchaali (known more popularly as Draupadi) is human.
Just like The Palace of Illusions, the story weaves the reader into its magic and makes the reading an unforgettable experience.
I read it once and was impressed; read it again slowly, savoring, and was swept away.Hinduism really has a claim on the whole 'fate and reincarnation' thing that keeps getting tossed around in YA.
And while reincarnation isn't a subject of this book, fate is.
If you want a great adventure story, this is a good bet.
Because of this book, one of my goals is to get through a 900+ page translation of that great epic, and if I'd never read The Palace Of Illusions, I might never have discovered the Mahabhrata at all.Thank you, Ms. Divakaruni.
Mahabharat from a different perspective - that of Draupadi's. The woman's viewpoint makes it more interesting since we've hardly had such stories from a woman's perspective. However, i did not like the new angle depicted between karna and draupadi though, not even a bitFor someone who is looking for an introduction to the Epic its a strong NO, as the book is a huge & a bold deviation from the original.Not Recommended.
Many interpretations of the Mahabharata have been attempted and Divakaruni's The Palace of Illusions is one of them.The Place of Illusions is a retelling of the epic from Draupadi's (or Panchaali's) perspective.
She was aware of how she must be with each of them and how she must be with all five of them together.I loved a lot of things about this book but I wasn't too fond of Divakaruni's attempt to solidly situate Karna as Panchaali's 'true love'.
Panchaali's encounters with Karna were always sexually charged but towards the end Divakaruni gave their relationship a spiritual dimension.The Palace of Illusions has often been called a feminist retelling of the Mahabharata.
A version of the Mahābhārata told from the perspective of Princess Panchāli, this did more for me that an entire semester of studying the original text for college did. Panchāli’s character is fascinating in that she is married to five brothers in the Hindu epic, and the novel talks about this with due credit to the patriarchal context.Verdict: Buy.from Buy, Borrow, Bypass: Hindu Mythology Retellings: http://bookriot.com/2016/05/23/buy-bo...
ihihihi*Divakaruni membawa saya menelusuri hati Dropadi yang kemudian berganti nama menjadi PanchaliYang lahir dari api bersama kakak kembarnya, DrestadyumnaYang memiliki hasrat akan ilmu pengetahuan layaknya seorang laki-lakiYang ingin memainkan peran besar dalam kehidupannyaPanchali, Wanita yang menikah dengan kelima PandawaSalah satu tonggak perang besar Kurukshetra yang menumpahkan banyak darah antar saudaraKarena beban dendam ayahnya, Drupada, terhadap DronaKarena cinta yang tak tersampaikan terhadap KarnaKarena tidak mampu mencerna setiap petunjuk KhrisnaKarena harga dirinya atas hinaan Duryodana, pemimpin para KurawaKarena ketidakmampuan dia untuk bersyukurKarena diamnya..Saya harap, saya tidak sepertinyaYang meski menikah dengan lima pria paling cakap tapi tak bahagiaYang tidak mampu menahan kebencianYang tidak berani jujur atas hatinyaSaya harap, seseorang yang saya rindukan akan menemukan sayaTidak perlu sempurna seperti Pandawa LimaHanya seseorang, yang tak perlu saya sembunyikan rasa cinta sayaYang saya tahu, saya merindukannya, bahkan sebelum bertemu, seperti ketika saya membaca buku iniNotes:*baca bareng kak Miaaa dan Ucha*buku ditraktir Ijul di PBJ 2010*dedicated to Pandawa Lima of TI'99..
Even though I knew every twist and turn and every side story; the story when told by Panchali and written by Chitra took on a different colour.It is not easy to narrate an epic through the eyes of one character.
I also remembered the great warrior Karna who I had then considered the most mistaken and unfortunate among all characters that enriched Mahabharata.The book made me look at Panchali with renewed respect.
I left reading on a particular page yesterday night mourning the death of a favorite character and yet picked it up again first thing in the morning.This is one book that will remain a cherished possession.Highly recommended for those who love poetic writing and mythology.
