The opening sentence—Outside the station, people settled down again to being emotionally commonplace—in many ways sets the tone for the entire novel: this is a tale of an emotionally commonplace city, with the family in White's focus pushing about that dead, settled centre from which the living must struggle to escape—by means of artistic, sexual, or revolutionary energies with perils all their own.
White was even then such a deft, artistic writer that he manages moments of incandescence and sublimity; but those moments are much too interspersed with relentless misery and ponderous relations to elevate this book above the average.
The writing here is so assured and very masterly. I often stopped and reread sentences or paragraphs that had a true poetry about them. The setting and style recalled Virginia Wolf's 'Mrs Dalloway' but unfortunately the plot here did not hang together as well as that novel does. White is missing the great myths that captured his imagination with the later novels. You get the impression after reading this novel that White did not think very much of London in the 1930s.

"off a barrow in Pimlico"
Mixed opinion: the style is very much in line with Virginia Woolf and certainly bears the theme of the distance, the impotence to live, to dare to live. Yet the story does not convince and regularly there are also weak passages. Reading halfway aborted.
The title of this collection comes from the last few words of James Joyce's short story "The Dead".White's idiosyncratic approach to language and sentences makes me love him even more.
