Yes. We PAY to do it.” Thad Beaumont wanted to write from the time he discovered that a person could make a living as a writer.
While writing as George Stark, he transforms into someone else, someone meaner, someone who likes seeing blood.
Don't make me tell you twice.” Thad Beaumont writes with a typewriter, but George Stark don’t write with no faggoty typewriter; oh no, it is Black Beauty pencils or nothing.
The words are etched into the paper like words carved over the doors of the ”stone hotels” in which Stark has spent so much time incarcerated.The sparrows are back.
A totally wild ride! Something I likely wouldn't have picked up on my own as I'd somehow missed this King novel. So glad I did as I enjoyed it much more than expected. As always, SK is a genius at creating characters who are flawed, intriguing, and yet somehow redeeming. I now need to hunt down the film version to compare notes on how it varies from the book. Buddy Read with Amber and Kelly! Woot and double woot.
This REALLY is one hell of a crazy-ass read, and it all begins with an eleven year old boy's excruciating headaches that lead to surgery, bizarre results and the freakish sparrow phenomenon afterward....Now this young boy Thad began writing weird stories at an early age, and as he grew up decided to use a pen name for a period of time.....sound familiar?...Anyway, the time came to bury the alias and one George Stark with full honors....grave, headstone and publicity to boot....As the story progresses, a grown up Thad with wife and twins (now writing under his own name) begins to re-experience awful headaches in addition to frightening dreams.
When someone discovered literary writer Thad Beaumont was also crime writer George Stark and tried to blackmail him, Beaumont and his wife decided to go public and kill off George Stark themselves.
Since we had a trip to Maine coming up, I decided to read it again.The Dark Half is an underrated book.
Since then, he's become a critically acclaimed literary writer and a blockbuster crime writer under the pseudonym George Stark, who goes on a murderous rampage when Thad kills him off.This is one of those books where the main character is the least interesting one.
3.5 Stars What inspires an author to write a story? Without question, King is a man with tremendous imagination. He took inspiration for The Shining when he stayed in a deserted hotel along with his wife, and he wrote Pet Sematary after King and his family stayed a year near an actual Pet Sematary in Orrington.But for The Dark Half, his inspiration was a lot closer to home.King wrote couple of novels under pseudonym  Richard Bachman  in 70s and 80s. But in 1985, a bookstore clerk figured Bachman

In short, The cat was out of the bag.Wait, Mild Spoilers AheaaaaaaadFour years after, in 1989, King wrote The Dark Half: A dark tale where a novelist with pseudonym reveals his secret identity to the public and vows not to write another novel under that particular pen name.
So Thad comes up with the pen name, George Stark, that he uses to write gory crime novels, and those books all become popular best sellers.
It’s obvious that the idea was inspired by King’s own use of a pen name, and it’s one of the first books that King really started digging into the idea of what it means to write and create something.
During the story, while Thad is giving an interview about how he came up with George Stark, he mentions being inspired by Donald Westlake using Richard Stark as a pen name for his Parker crime novels.
I don't normally argue with someone about their thoughts on a novel- because everyone has a right to their own opinion, but I will say - I really dislike when people call Stephen King a hack.
Some people read for entertainment, and if Stephen King does anything...he certainly entertains- in my humble opinion.[image error][image error]Stephen King wrote THE DARK HALF right after he was outed for being Richard Bachman- a book seller read the book Thinner and grew suspicious that Bachman's writing style was very similar to King's.
When Thad's authorship of Stark's novels becomes public knowledge, Thad decides to kill off his alter ego.
It was a quick read for a Stephen King book.
Short read and my first Stephen King book.
I used to regard King as a pop-writer.
I had a neighbor who couldn't get enough of him about 20 years ago.
I just rolled my eyes at her.
LOL.
This book is a great gate-way drug to King.
It was left in my apt.
laundry room in the giveaway pile.
I picked it up whilst waiting for my laundry to finish and stayed in the laundry room for the next hour.
Character development from page 1.
I have to admit ...
now I have a bit of a problem.
Not wanting to write those types of books anymore, Thad buries George Stark and decides to write his own work.
Entranced, I decided to read a few Stephen King books a year and from the few books I have read of his, I have enjoyed them.
If you liked Stephen King's books or if this is your first foray into King's maniacal world, I recommend checking out this book or any of his old work first before venturing on to his newer stuff because you will enjoy it.
King's here to tell you!.Based (hopefully loosely) on his own experience of writing as Richard Bachman, King once again delivers a great read centred around a writer and the art of writing, and I loved the idea that all writers have another person, a dark half, inside them....In my opinion some of the most startling and vivid imagery of the Kings I've read so far feature in this book, such as the rapid decomposition of George Stark as he rots away, and the image of millions of sparrows gathering for their sinister purpose.
I don't think I'll ever look at a sparrow the same way again.
I Promised you a review :)  “...he was, after all, a novelist...and a novelist was simply a fellow who got paid to tell lies. The bigger the lies, the better the pay.”  First of all with any  Stephen King  book the reader must understand that they will be freaking traumatised to some extent and you won’t be able to put down his book until the end. So it’s the best conundrum or maybe the worst. The book itself has the classic King vibe to it, a malevolent haunting story which features a protagoni
The book itself has the classic King vibe to it, a malevolent haunting story which features a protagonist who is a writer (similar to The Shining, Misery etc.
both which I highly recommend) and boy was it a ride…Thad (the protagonist) was a struggling writer after he shifts gears and decides that he will use a new pseudonym (George Stack)… BOOM!
). It was a ride this book with one of the most gruesome scenes (Obviously it's Stephen King) and would highly recommend it.Thank you for reading :)Kenyan Library Blog
His rampage, unbelievable to most of the authorities, remember the fingerprints but gripping to the reader contained some of my favourite parts of the book.Just a dream.'I’m not done with you, cock-knocker, George Stark said softly from behind him.
Superb writing, I have to say.'Dodie Eberhart raised her voice to its maximum decibel level, windows cracked, the eardrums of small children ruptured, and dogs fell dead.'And that's before she even gets to the murder scene.The whole sparrow thing was brilliantly told and bought about the perfect ending, there's a mythology around the sparrows of course carrying the souls of the dead and this brings another creepy element to the story, even though I hate, hate and yes hate the word Psychopomp.
Also, I cannot promise there won't be spoilers, but I will try my best.Okay, we're all clear that Stephen King once wrote under the pen name Richard Bachman, right?
Publishers pubbed one book a year from an author because people read slower in the dark ages.
Dig on this: Stephen King killed Richard Bachman in much the same way that Thad Beaumont kills off George Stark in this novel; by having a fake funeral for the guy.
Westlake is mentioned in The Dark Half not only because Westlake had a famous pen name, but because King took part of that pen name to create his own.
When the story was made into a TV series, Gary Busey, should have played the role of George Stark. 🐯👍
Brace yourself for some layers of authorship! Ready? This book was written by Stephen King as Stephen King not too long after the "death" by exposure of his pseudonym Richard Bachman. The story is about an author, Thad Beaumont, who, under similar circumstances, has just laid to rest his own successful pseudonym, George Stark. Trouble is, George Stark isn't too keen on going quietly into the night. And George Stark can be one high toned son of a bitch.  I love it when King writes about writers (

And George Stark can be one high toned son of a bitch.
I love it when King writes about writers (John Irving has a similar knack for this).
However, the screw 'em all, unsustainable but going too fast to care characteristics of George Stark or Jack Torrance when the boiler begins to creep lie somewhere within us all.
Gardner is an excellent narrator and the voice he gave to “George Stark, that high-toned son of a bitch from Oxford, Mississippi” was perfect!***Ebook:This was another of King’s books that I didn’t much care for the first time I read it.
It belonged to that high-toned, Toronado-driving son of a bitch George Stark.“Fool’s Stuffing” is also one of the titles on the soundtrack from the movie The Dark Half.“The Sparrows Are Flying Again” (Needful Things) “Alan felt his belly try to fold in on itself, but he didn’t move.
A very readable piece of gory horror from the master of the art Stephen King. I loved the idea about the sparrows and also the brilliant part about the twin being absorbed into his brother's body, which of course can really happen but never in the way this author visualises it! King writes good books and he writes excellent books but so far he has never let me down by writing a bad book. This is a good one. If you enjoy horror then this book is for you.
During those years his kids got older; he became addicted to drugs and got clean (a process that casts a hue on almost every release from this period); he collaborated with Peter Straub on a fantasy novel and kicked the Dark Tower series into gear.
It was a very productive time for King.As I said, I had a good time rereading the releases from this decade.
King Connections As I said before, a lot of The Dark Halftakes place partially in Castle Rock, placing this firmly in the same universe as The Dead Zone, Cujo, et cetera.
Actually I'm a huge Stephen King fan, so giving this only 2 1/2 stars went against a lot of the personal feelings and experiences I've had over the years reading his amazing novels.
The book has all the right ingredients to work: a sick twisted plot that comes to a crescendo conclusion at the end, some very dark violence scenes and Stephen kings prolific and unique writing style.
What really kills the 'Dark Half' is the turtle slow pace of the book with multiple unnecessary characters and sideline bullshit plots which add nothing to the story!
This is actually a scene from a movie adaption to 'Dark Half.
King was hitting on all cylinders in this high toned son of a bitch. Still one of my faves.
A wild, crazy and creepy Stephen King novel! Not one of my favourites but certainly worth the read!
Είμαι υπόχρεος στον αείμνηστο Richard Bachman για τη βοήθεια και την έμπνευσή του. Το μυθιστόρημα αυτό δε θα είχε γραφτεί χωρίς εκείνον. S.K. Αυτό ακριβώς είναι το σημείωμα του συγγραφέα στο τέλος του Σκοτεινού Μισού. Για όσους δε γνωρίζουν, ο Richard Bachman ήταν το "σκοτεινό μισό" του Stephen King. Την περίοδο '77-84 ο Κινγκ βάρεσε υπαρξιακά και αναρωτήθηκε εάν η φήμη που απέκτησε ήταν επειδή το άξιζε είτε επειδή είχε αποκτήσει όνομα. Έτσι άρχισε να γράφει βιβλία που εκδόθηκαν από άλλον εκδοτι
Λίγο πριν το κάνει, ο Θαντ φωτογραφίζεται στο νεκροταφείο της πολιτείας μαζί με τη γυναίκα του δίπλα από έναν ψεύτικο τάφο που γράφει "Τζορτζ Σταρκ, ένας όχι και τόσο καλός άνθρωπος".
Αλλά από τα σκοτάδια ο Τζορτζ Σταρκ παίρνει σάρκα και οστά και ξεκινάει ένα ταξίδι αιματοχυσίας που φτάνει μέχρι την πόρτα του σπιτιού του Θαντ.
Ποιος είναι αυτός και τι θέλει από το δημιουργό του; Διαβάστε το!Το Σκοτεινό Μισό είναι άλλο ένα βιβλίο του Κινγκ που δανείζεται στοιχεία από τη ζωή του, βαλμένα με πολύ όμορφο τρόπο, χωρίς να αποσκοπεί στην αυτοπροβολή, στο εύκολο δράμα ή στην έπαρση.
Really good. Been on a King family spree the last week. I have read End of Watch, The Fireman, and now this.1600 pages of fun. This was really good.
You end up having to read the other Castle Rock books in order to find out what happens to the characters mentioned in this one which is okay, but does make it that "The Dark Half" is not a true standalone book.
Thad has a good life and when you realize his connection to "George Stark" I ended up being moved to mostly pity for the guy.The other characters in this one come in and out and don't really sing to me.
After "The Dark Half" you can read "Needful Things" where you can follow up with Sheriff Alan Pangborn and hear about Thad Beaumont again.
Buddy Reading this with these lovely ladies  Amber and Chelsea Humphrey Can't wait!! ; ))
3.5/5Not Mr King's best work, but not his worst either (of which, there are very few in my experiences). But, even an average Stephen King book, is better than most authors best work.
Regardless, Bachman was now dead, though King would eventually publish a few works under Bachman’s name “posthumously.” King’s experience with the loss of his Bachman pen name is unequivocally the inspiration behind The Dark Half.
There is a scene at the beginning of the book, when Thad is just a sick kid on an operating table, that was one of the most horrifying visuals I’ve ever read, and it’s definitely going to stick with me.
I found going back and reading about his life before the events of Needful Things incredibly interesting, and I think filling in my knowledge of a character I already cared about dramatically increased my enjoyment of this book.
I was a little disappointed with this. It's interesting because of the obvious King/Bachman thing. One thing that this story doesn't contain that all other King books thrive on - interesting and great characters. Our main character is a clumsy, cold and serious writer who's just a bit of a dullard really. I also made this mistake of reading this alongside IT (which I'm currently about 500 pages into) which is littered with amazing characters. Still an interesting read but there are so many other King books out there that are streets ahead of this.Recommended for: King completionists.
You just don't have the sense to lie down."Thad Beaumont is an author that's not very successful, however under his pen name "George Stark" he writes highly successful books about a violent killer called Alexis Machine.
Following an article in People magazine in which he admits to being George Stark and taking part in a photo shoot with a fake grave, Stark himself comes to life and goes on a killing rampage before targeting Beaumont himself.This book is clearly a reference to King's own pseudonym, Richard Bachman.
I also liked the back story as to where Stark came from, and loved how King reflected this in Thad's twins and their similarities.
Ovo je bilo dobro !George Stark nije duh , ni zombi niti neka druga vrsta čudovišta ...
on je nešto svojstveno , oživljeni pseudonim stvoren od Kinga lično .
Pseudonim koji nikad nije ni postojao ali opet ne želi umrijeti .
Čak mi ga je na kraju bilo žao , kada nije mogao riječi prenijeti na papir , jer lično znam kako je to .
Priča oko Thada je dosta zamiljiva , ali one scene oko vrapaca su nezaboravne .Tamna polovica spada sigurno u brutalnija djela Kinga , i sigurni je obračun sa svojim brutalnim pseudonimom Bachmanom ( koji je sad poznatiji kao brutalniji King).
