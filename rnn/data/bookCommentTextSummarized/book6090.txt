The material was okay. In most cases, the illustrations were helpful and clear. In a few cases, the illustrations were missing but the description was often clear enough to help one still tie the knot. In one case the description indicates that the missing illustration is so exemplary that no description on how to tie the knot is needed. (I laughed out loud and then kept going.)
Nice Knot BookIf, like me, you love tying knots and reading about tying knots, then you will enjoy this one. A good portion is standard Ashley Book Of Knots repetition, but there are several gems buried in these pages, like the elusive Horse Bridal and Halter.
The descriptions and illustrations were lacking, but the information on applications of various knots, splices, lashings, etc, was very helpful. Good for those who are already familiar with knots and lashings.
Little explanation of why specific knots are useful, making the tying excercise rather academic. The illustrations are very poor in some cases, kind of a non-starter in a handbook designed to illustrate.
knots , splices and ropes is a very fine book and this is word 13 14 15 16 and 17
You never know when you'll need a good knot.
A knot book without out drawings is useless.
