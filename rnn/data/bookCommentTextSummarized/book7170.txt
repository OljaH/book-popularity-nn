My mother was 3 years old when this book came out in 1946.
Her copy was on my shelf as a child and after reading 20 or so Famous Five books I reluctantly picked it up, trusting Blyton to make even a girls' school interesting.
She has listened to them dozens of times.The basic formula is posh girls being mean to each other at boarding school.This book combined with The Worst Witch will give you the foundation of Harry Potter.The girls take a train to Malory Towers at the start of term, making friends and enemies on the way.
This book did make me re-visit all the things I felt when I read this in school.
I can still see myself sitting in my minds eye reading this during library hours.This book is a splendid introduction that starts off with Darrell joining Malory Towers for her first term, making some great friends and a rivalry that may go on for sometime at-least.
I remember 3 of my cousins studied in boarding school when I first read this book and I imagined them living a life like that in Malory Towers.
one of my favorite MG series when i was younger. i really need to reread it again 💓
I know I am not the only one whose love of boarding school stories began with this series!
I embraced Darrell and Sally and their adventures at Malory Towers, despite their anti-American bias, and longed for midnight feasts, adventures in field hockey, uniforms, and tuck boxes.
In fact, my sister and I used to play "boarding school," (we also played "orphans," which my mother found very amusing) wearing black skirts, white shirts and black velvet ties around our necks.
My mother had Blyton's Adventure series growing up, but the school stories were less common in the US.
I think we found the first Malory Towers and St. Clare's books in Toronto.
I count as our successes those who learn to be good-hearted & kind, sensible & trustable, good sound women the world can lean on.
Our failures are those who do not learn thee things in the years they are here.’The head understands that the school really exists to provide a formation as well as an education (‘scholarships & pass[ing] exams’), to provide each student with a special kind of character - ‘good-hearted & kind, sensible & trustable’.
She came here too, & she told me all kinds of stories about awful girls who got all right!’ I own three more books in the series to find out whether Gwendoline gets all right but it may be a while before I find out.
These books may be short but they are so sweet and innocent; I really enjoyed reading this book.

I read this book because I heard a fabulous recording of a talk about Enid Blyton from Seven Stories.
It’s interesting to me how Blyton has been rehabilitated in the world of children’s literature.
I loved Malory Towers as a youngster.
So I was a bit dubious about reading the book after all these decades.
Yes, the first bit is a bit tedious as Blyton explains all the basics of Malory Towers life, but the characters are great.
Let’s face it, the situations Blyton presents are no different to those in modern life, be it at school or at the office.
It’s going to take some discipline on my part to wait to read the next five until I’ve read some other books further up in my queue.I guess the plot was formulaic and the girls were all a “type” but I thoroughly enjoyed this book.
I would have adored this book when I was a child.
As an adult I saw almost everything coming but I didn’t mind one bit.I admit I did feel sympathy for the “bad” girl, more than I probably would have had I read these first as a child.The book is very British and somewhat old fashioned (it was first published in 1946) but I think it can be easily enjoyed today with those caveats kept in mind.
I listened to this as an audio book. First term at Mallory Towers was about a girl called Darryl who was about to start Malory Towers. Darryl has a hot temper but she is kind hearted and loyal to her friends. Meet Darryl, Sally and Mary-Loo for a walk down memory lane.
Being dangerously close to a reading slump, I decided to give the old school stories a run, and I enjoyed this one.The description of the "nice looking" uniform made me laugh--all brown and orange, two colours I dislike, particularly together!
I had a slight deja vu feeling, as if I'd read this, or at least started it, before, but then I realised that Blyton recycled a few phrases and paragraphs (particularly describing the dorms) word-for-word from one book to another.There's not as much emphasis on needlework and long walks as in the Chalet School books by Elinor Dyer, and no need for hair-breadth 'scapes--unless you count the spider!A good bedtime read.
Darrell is going to her new boarding school, and is very excited, but nervous, too!
CommentThis is a really good book!
For example, I would think  I will just read to the end of this chapter, but then I will stop for now, but I would find myself reading much more chapters because of how good it is!
RatingI rated this book four stars because of how gripping and exciting it is, but also because of how it fills you with suspense!
Age GroupI think that the best age group for this book is 7+, as I think that it would be very nice to read for the older children.
mimpi yang ga' tercapai karena apparently - according to my parents - sekolah berasrama di indonesia ga' seperti di inggris (ya iyalaaaaah)...lalu buku ini juga yang pertama kali memperkenalkan aku pada konsep "sahabat", that walopun bisa saja ada banyak teman yang cocok dan akrab dengan kita, "sahabat" paling banyak hanya bisa sejumlah jari sebelah tangan (not that the books said it explicitly, but only as i wanted to believe hehehehe)...
bisa di tebak, i grew up quite unsociable hhhohohohohoh (not that i mind), partly karna "salah nangkep" isi buku ini, setangahnya lagi karna sangking kutu bukunya aku emang jadi ga' gaul...
Just wonderfully nostalgic.
favorite childhood book
To top it all Darrell must address her own troubles, not being able to make a friend as easily as she thought she would, and more than that, to control her own hot temper which leads to more misery for herself than she ever thought it would.To start off with, a thought that popped into my mind was how this story linked with Blyton’s other mystery/adventure stories (something I’ve never consciously thought before)—while those (like the Findouters books) tell of what the children get upto during the holidays, these deal with term time, so one does get a rounded picture of children’s lives after all.But anyway, back to the actual book, I though Blyton did a great job in this introductory story of showing us how in school (in books as in real life) we meet all kinds of people—friendly, reserved, brave, cowardly, bright, not so very bright, honest and good-natured, and spiteful (we also have the exaggerated French mistress, Mam’zelle Dupont).
tapi saya cukup kagum dengan kemampuan Enid Blyton untuk menyampaikan petuah dalam rangkaian cerita yang nyambung (tdk seperti diada-adakan), misal: mengenai pura-pura tulinya Alicia (yg berbuntut pada ketidakpercayaan para guru saat dia benar-benar tuli sesaat), ketakutan Darrell saat dia menyangka dialah penyebab sakitnya Sally (yang menyebabkan dia sadar betapa tidak enaknya memiliki rasa takut, apalagi jika diejek, seperti dialami Mary Lou), dsb.sedang ketergangguan saya (sebagai orang dewasa tentu saja) dalam membaca buku ini terutama disebabkan pada:1.
Kecuali jika POV nya memang hanya dia, dan tidak berganti-ganti seperti di buku ini, mungkin pertimbangan penggunaan Darrell sebagai tokoh utama baru masuk akal.
Malory Towers is a series of six novels based on a fictional boarding school of the same name, located in Cornish.The first book in the series introduces us to the protagonist, Darrell Rivers.
In the beginning, the reader comes to know of Darrell’s expectations from her time in Malory Towers.
She hopes to be a good student and wishes to make out of the school as a well-bred woman with a wonderful life ahead of her.
And that’s how a friendship was made for life.Malory Towers is a book of lessons if you pay close attention.
I liked Malory Towers more than I had expected - enough to buy the whole set for my daughter, who recommended it to me in the first place.I didn't grow up reading Enid Blyton stories, and so tend to be a bit sceptical about the quality of her work.
The good admirable adults in the story, e.g. Darrell's parents and the Headmistress of Malory Towers, all mention making the most of your opportunities, and giving back to your community, yet there is no ultra-virtuous character, no preachiness.
There is also a good amount of action and excitement for a first book in a series, with its scene-setting obligations.
i loveee these books :) i love the way that old books were written- as in, how enid blyton wrote them.
i love the old covers/editions, they make it seem so much more old-timey.
i was REALLY upset when i finished reading the series, and i was really skeptical about reading pamela cox's new ones- i didnt want to- but i tried New Term at Malory Towers and i enjoyed it immensely!
i still want to read Summer Term and i think its Winter Term (?).
i like these better than the st claires books, however i've only read a couple of them and i will try to get my hands on the rest soon.
As with a few other books I've reviewed before, I'm rating this with the feelings I had for it at the time, not by any means an objective judgement on it as an adult!
I used to devour Enid Blyton's work, despite being aware of the at times icky implications (racism, Anglo-centrism, sexism, classism, etc).
It was a midnight feast in its own way.Anyway, Darryl was probably my favourite of all Blyton's schoolgirls.
I don't remember much about it now, to be honest -- I remember her violent temper, and the way all the girls have things they must overcome and so on, but I don't remember specifics.
Should I be embarrassed to admit I loved this at 26 just as much as I did at ten? Because I did. And I'm not. :)
Knapp 30 Jahre später und ich liebe die Bücher immer noch! :-) Ein wunderbarer Ausgleich, zu all den schlimmen Dingen, die um uns herum passieren...
my first encounter with Malory Towers the series. I read my sister's book, then i fell in love with the characters..Darrel, the smart but sometimes can be hot-tempered. Usually, the series were written from her perspective.Sally, the wise and mature oneMary-Lou, the sweet and kind girlGwendoline, the spoilled one (oops)Alicia, the class-clown and the queen of tricksBetty, Alicia's partner-in-crimeIrene, music is her middle nameBelinda, the creative one, very good at drawingsFelicity, Darrel's little sisterMiss Potts, the class-teacherMiss Grayling, the headmistressMam'zelle Dupont, the funny French teacherMam'zelle Rougier, the unfriendly French teacherand then...I decided to bought the rest of the series.
I've borrowed this book from my niece, who is an avid reader and has read this series countless times.
There's a lot of emphasis on girls achieving a lot and having high expectations of themselves and taking responsibility for their decisions - all to be encouraged.
I expected it to seem more old-fashioned than it did.I enjoyed going back to my childhood and will be reading the others - when I can prise them away from my niece!
My 4 stars is on the basis of a 10 year old reading it (although Zoe would probably give it 5!)
I discovered Malory Towers long after Enid Blyton had first tempted me into her child like worlds.
I think I was about sixteen when I read my first Malory Towers book, but I wasn't too old to not enjoy the story.
I'd wanted to go to an Enid Blyton type school for a long time, due to the St Clare's books, but I think this series is a cut even above those delights.
I love reading her transformation over the years she at school, along with Sally and Mary-Lou. A great series for children, and one you can still enjoy as an adult!
Adorei. Gosto imenso de livros que se passam em colégios internos e estou a ver que vou adorar esta série.
I found this at a bookstore in London during my first trip overseas and fell in love. The next time I was in England I bought what the store had on the shelf, but have holes in my collection.What can happen to a girl when she heads off to boarding school? A lot. A good story and fun read. The rest in the series are just as good.
Enid's Famous Five will always remain in my heart but I also enjoyed in this one.
Just read first chapter. It's good enough.
