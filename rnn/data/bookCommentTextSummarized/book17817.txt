2 stars**DNF at 60 %. I think my pic is more entertaining than the book.**Review posted May 10, 2013 As a side noteMy review of Down London Road is negative. Recently I have been accused of bullying for posting another negative review. Again, reading and reviewing is a very subjective matter. A review reflects my opinion. It reflects my feelings and it will always reflect why I enjoyed a book or why I didn't like it. Besides, I'm living in a democratic country and if I remember correctly then we
With that said, I would appreciate it immensely when those authors and readers who don't appreciate my take on a book would stop wasting their time by reading my reviews and posting vicious comments.
Thank you.Just to make this very clear: it was NOT Samantha Young who accused me of bullying, however, I wanted to add this side note to my review to point out that I have a right to express my honest opinion.
I'm a good girlfriend and my boyfriend likes to show his appreciation by being generous with his money."(….)"One: There's much more to you than that.

I aint read or wanting to read a Down London Road (clearly not knowing a title had been given!)
So I have a look and I see not only does the 2nd installment have a title but also a BLURB!!!!!!!
But I don't doubt Samantha Young at all and I know she will captivate us as she did with On Dublin Street!
I AM SO LOOKING FORWARD TO THE CHARACTERS MEETING FOR THE FIRST TIME!
The Taxi scene was one of my all time best scenes for 2012!
IT'S MAH BIRTHDAY!
I think this will be the best birthday gift EVER!
*2.5 Stars*A largely uneventful read...To be fair, I'll list some of my pros and cons: What I liked  -Cole and Hanna were some of the coolest teens ever to grace a story!-The initial tension build up between Cam and Jo was fun.-Joss and Braden still being a strong part of story was awesome.-The strong sense of family and togetherness between friends was heartwarming.  What didn't work for me -I understood Jo's insecurities, but her self-depreciation was over-the-top and didnt feel natural.-The b
-I understood Jo's insecurities, but her self-depreciation was over-the-top and didnt feel natural.-The book was dragged out with not much happening until the end, and by that point, I wasn't invested in the story.-Hero and heroine weren't likable for me, and I never felt connected to either one.
I wasn't particularly fond of how Jo and Cam were portrayed, but I did adore many of the secondary characters and look forward to seeing how their stories evolve.
▪	 Genre/Category: Contemporary Romance▪	 Steam Caliber: Extremely steamy▪ Romance: Intense connection, but lacked believability.▪	 Characters: Felt flat.
Excellent secondary characters.▪	 Plot: Angsty and passionate, but uneventful.
4.5 Stars!!!!Okay. On Dublin Street was one of my favorites last year. Braden Carmichael is one of my top book boyfriends... I had really high expectations for this one. It wasn’t quite as good as ODS for me, but I still really enjoyed it! In ODS we meet Jo. Jo is friends with Joss, they work together at the bar. On the outside, we see a good looking blonde, a gold digger who only dates rich men.  But those that know the real Jo, the person on the inside know that is not the case.   “There’s so
On the outside, we see a good looking blonde, a gold digger who only dates rich men.
She wants things to be better for Cole, to make sure his life doesn’t turn out like hers.
She loves Cole more than anything and he is the most important thing in her life.
Finally I’d found a guy who wanted to be with me- the real me.
I absolutely loved Cam and Jo together.
I fell in love with Jo’s little brother Cole.
And of course I love my Braden and Joss.
but I can’t help it I LOVED THIS BOOK!
I LOVED THIS FREAKING BOOK.
The only thing I did not like about this book was how fucking long I had to wait for it!!!
I loved Jo, that poor thing went through so much growing up and still today was just put through hell.
Cam completely misjudged her like a douche ass dick head and I really wanted to kick that man's ass several times thoughout this book.
I loved Cam..even when he was an ass and did several stupidass things..
every page, every word, every minute was worth it...Parts of Cam I loved...“It’s all-consuming,” he breathed, leaning his forehead against mine again.
The thing is, in life you better have no expectations at all so you are not disappointed, right?I must say I love Samantha's writing style and I will read more of her books, no doubt but I have to be honest and I cannot give this book a high rating because in my opinion and with all due respect, it does not deserve it.This is the story of Jo & Cam. We knew Jo from ODS.
*spoiler free - apart from a few direct quotes*  When you meet Johanna Walker, what will you see?  We first met Jo briefly "On Dublin Street", what I saw was a gorgeous, confident young woman but a gold digging, money grabber, who worked at Club 39 with Joss, and when she wasn't pulling pints she was basically trying to pull any rich bloke who could kit her out in all the latest fashions.......Well thats what I saw.........What does Cameron MacCabe see?  Cam....the sexy, hot, cocky tattooed guy,
So this story is about Cam peeling back Jo's layers, peeling back through her insecurities which are a result of the abuse she faced as a child, through her need to protect her 14 year old brother from their abusive, alcoholic mother, through her fear of not being able to provide for her family, fear of being hurt, of being left behind, fear of being her true self...."You know, the world will always try to make you into who it wants you to be.
3,5 stars When I first heard that Jo was going to be the heroine of Down Dublin Road I admit to being skeptical..In On Dublin Street,Jo was known for going after wealthy men, and she was portrayed as a simple gold digger.In Down Dublin Road, we learn that things aren't always as they seem, and that Jo has hidden depths..Jo is actually living a very bad life.Her dad was an abusive bastard who went to jail when she was 12, leaving Jo, her alcoholic mother, and her baby brother, Cole.
This is a damn good book. This story that made me laugh, cry, and smile. I always appreciate a well-developed friends-turn-lovers story. And one of the reasons I loved this book so much is that there was no insta-love crap going on here. Sure, there was an instant spark of attraction the first time Cam and Jo meet, but the romance between Jo and Cam is a slow yet sizzling burn. The sexual tension between these two could melt butter.  I’d never felt so intensely attracted to someone before. Usual
Cam is exactly what Jo needs in her life - a lover, a friend, a companion, who understands and accepts everything about her.
I love how passionate and protective Cam is.
I had this sudden intense need to claim Cam for myself from the moment he walked onto the pages.
But, even with the bad, there is definitely a lot of good.I love the flirtatious, witty banter between Jo and Cam. They are so much fun.
Samantha Young definitely knows how to write wickedly sexy scenes that heat up the sheets.
This book will leave an emotional impact on you and you will be wowed by the romance.
Cole will be developed in one of Samantha's book and you will love the boy he became, all thanks to the protection his sister provided.
She wasn't a gold digger, but she wanted that safety for her brother and to try to keep him safe, considering his background with their mother, who besides from being an alcoholic, was also abusive towards Cole.
you read an unique story, the only thing that binds them are the characters from the series.Our old friends, Joss and Braden, are actively present in this book and you will love them even more.
*SQUEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE*I love you Samantha Young and I'll stop Expected publication: May 7th 2013And here is the COVER too!!! WOW... gorgeous couple!!
Oh my stars!!! Down London Road was sheer perfection!! My heart is soaring after turning the last page!! It had  everything I love and want in a romance, and  more!! Longing , sexual tension, panty-melting scenes, sweet and tender love!! Family, friendship, and loyalty are all within the pages.  I LOVED EVERY BIT!!  I probably should warn you, this review will contain gushing. Lots of gushing! So it took me a minute to figure out who Johanna Walker was. Remember the gorgeous gold digger who work
It had  everything I love and want in a romance, and  more!!
But she’s not what we thought she was, and in the time between stories Joss has discovered this too, becoming an important and close friend.
She’s not a gold digger per se, but she wants to find someone who will provide security for her and her fourteen year old brother, Cole.
This becomes increasingly hard when Cam starts work as a bartender for Club 39 with Jo and Joss.
They are my favorite type of romance to read about, and I LOVED this one!!
Please.”We one time afresh go in the world of Club 39, but this time we'll get to glimpse Jo and new bartender CamLets meet JohannaJo designated date's men “who just occur to have money” in alignment to support her not-even-slightly-functioning alcohol-dependent mother and 14-year-old male sibling, Cole.She's scared that her younger brother would be separated from her,he might get dispatched to reside with their dad, a man who Cole scarcely recalls but would identical a destiny poorer than the one they face with their mother.It has perpetually been up to Johanna to nurture her family, particularly her younger brother, Cole.With an nonexistent father and a futile mother, she’s been establishing determinations supported on what’s best for Cole for as long as she can remember.
4.25 Stars!The thing that I loved most about this book was HIMCam -fucking-MacCabe*drooling* Ahhemm*clear throat* So this story is about Joe. Joe has responsibilities. Big responsibilities. She has to take care of her alcoholic/sick mother and her younger brother Cole. Joe loves Cole. Whatever she does she does it for him. She wants him happy and safe. She wants him not feel what she've felt and what she's going through.  He was my saving grace.I didn’t know what I’d do without him. She has two
4.25 Stars!The thing that I loved most about this book was HIMCam -fucking-MacCabe*drooling* Ahhemm*clear throat* So this story is about Joe. Joe has responsibilities.
Joe loves Cole.
She wants him not feel what she've felt and what she's going through.
So one night when they go out on a date to one of Malcolm's friends art show she then meets Cam, Bracca/Becca-whatever-the-hell-her name-is boyfriend.
After some events that happened and other things, they became friends.
Really great friends.
It was the best thing that had happened to me since Cole.
They want each other.
Loved Cole.
People, time, events, they’ll all try to carve away at you and make you think you don’t know who you are.
Definitely a hottie in the making.♥ I hope you'll like: Jo...after the fifty percent mark.
She does change and come into her own "Caledonia."♥ I hope you'll like: Cam. Okay...we all make mistakes and while there are reasons for some, he does see the error of his ways and makes changes.
(I love that!) ♥ I hope you'll like: the important theme which is about people liking you for who you are.
Samantha Young is the real deal...One of the signs of a good writer (to me) is when you can take a character who I was not that thrilled with in a previous work, and make me fall in love with them in your latest.
But once they worked their issues out, and decided to be 'friends', I sure did enjoy the sparks and the smokin' chemistry they had, and it was a pure delight watching them fall in love.
Epppppp!!!She thinks she knows what she wants...until he shows her what she needs.Cover's out, and oh mighty hell is it blown!!May 7th, 2013.BLURB IS OUT!!Johanna Walker is used to taking charge.
But she’s about to meet someone who will make her lose control....It has always been up to Johanna to care for her family, particularly her younger brother, Cole.
Especially since Cam is determined to uncover all of Jo’s secretseven if it means taking apart her defenses piece by piece.OHK, So there is some chaos on...http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17...NO BRANDEN!!
It was just too predictable.(view spoiler)[Of course....*She was going to keep talking to Malcolm behind Cam's back*Blair was going to come back to town*Her dad was going to show up and threaten her*She was going to walk home, at night, alone and subsequently get attacked by said dad*She was going to show up on Cam's doorstep only to have Blair answer the door in Cam's T-shirt so that it looked like they were having sex*Cam didn't have sex with Blair*Uncle Mick was going to offer her a job as a painter/decorator (hide spoiler)]All in all, I found this one to be no where near as good as On Dublin Street.
It prevented me from developing an emotional connection with Jo and Cam. It also didn't help that the main characters were with other people for 1/2 of the book--Jo with Malcolm and Cam with Becca.
So maybe I should not be rating this since i abandoned at 25% but I mean really I had such high hopes and this book sucked. I paid 7.99 for a sucky book. I think Samantha Young is very talented and I absolutely loved On Dublin Street so I'm not sure where this book went wrong. I couldn't connect with the characters and with over 900 books on my TBR list I can't waste my time on something and force myself to finish it just to continue to hate it...
Okay, I am going to try and keep this review nice and short because I don't want it to turn into me just ranting about the things I didn't like.The writing was wonderful, as usual with Samantha Young.
I don't like it when people say they didn't like a book, but then doesn't give any reasons why, it annoys me.
I understand that she needs money, but just go out and get a damn job like the rest of us.
Cameron was really great at times, but I didn't like the way he judges people, before he's even spoken to them.
★★★☆☆ 3 out of 5 starsReading order       Novellas   I actually liked this book a lot. Down London Road was just another proof for me that I will read everything Samantha Young writes. It had almost everything for me. A likable heroine, a hot and sexy hero and a good plot. I enjoyed some parts in this book more then others, but overall, it was a great read!!But first thing first, our heroine, Johanna Walker. Jo was first introduced to us in On Dublin Street.

I enjoyed some parts in this book more then others, but overall, it was a great read!!But first thing first, our heroine, Johanna Walker.
I actually liked her a lot more then Joss.
Finally we got to read about an interesting heroine with depth!And the hero Cam!
But I still hasn´t decided if I would have picked either this book or a sequel about Braden and Joss.
But this was definitly a GREAT read!
I don't mean that I expected for stories to be similar or anything, I expected to be left with the same feelings I had after I read ODS: happiness, good kind of frustration, maybe a little of sadness or heartache.
I have read quite a few books with possessive men, and Cam is not even a little bit it.- Story line.
She stressed so much to meet his parents, but when she finally did, all we got was "It was lovely, nice people, accepted her and Cole, his father loved her." We only got few lines of dialog the day after, something about freaking pancakes.Then, Cam digs up her long lost uncle and his daughter.
This was an adult contemporary romance story featuring Jo from On Dublin Street.I liked Jo in this and I felt bad for her at the way she was living her life in fear of her parents.
It wasn’t fair the way she had to work 2 jobs and look after her younger brother all the time because of her mother’s alcoholism, but trying to hide what she was living with wasn’t doing her any favours either.
The story was interesting though, and held my attention pretty well, and it was nice to catch up with Joss and Ellie from On Dublin street as well.
En general, me ha gustado. Vamos, me ha gustado cómo la autora retrata lo difícil que es la convivencia con un alcohólico; así como los traumas de tener una infancia como la de nuestra protagonista. Sin embargo, no he conseguido congeniar con ella.
“I’m going to fuck you so hard, sink so keep inside of you, you’ll never work me out from under your skin. Never.”   <3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3This is the second book in the On Dublin Street series and is about bartender, Johanna (Jo) and graphic designer Cameron (Cam). They meet when Cam is hired at the bar where Jo works and the attraction is instant. There is just one problem.....they are both dating other people. UGH!

Usually, it took me a while to get to know a guy before I felt that kind of deep tingling in all of my good-for-nothing places.”   “My body was panting, "He's hot.

WARNING: This review kind of sucks, mainly because I find it difficult to write reviews for romance books but enjoy.
From someone who has incredibly little relationship experience but has read a lot of books communication is key people.PlotThe plot, as I mentioned before, was focused primarily on the romance - however, the development of the romance was well done and beautiful.
I found myself wanting to cry for the characters in certain situations and getting mad at others - something that doesn't happen too often with books for me these days that I got a little more judgmental.
2.5 starsI know my review isn't traditional. But this really distracted me while reading the book: the similar names. I also felt like more of the alphabet should have been used because I had to stop and think about who is who.
