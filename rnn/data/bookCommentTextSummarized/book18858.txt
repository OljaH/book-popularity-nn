:-)Excerpts from The Dip: A Little Book That Teaches You When to Quit by Seth GodinMost of the time, we deal with the obstacles by persevering.
Dips don't last quite as long when you whittle at them.CURVE 2: THE CUL-DE-SACThe Cul-de-Sac (French for "dead end") is ...
Stick with the Dips that are likely to pan out, and quit the Cul-de-Sacs to focus your resources.
You should quit if the project you're working on has a Dip that isn't worth the reward at the end.
It's all pretty obvious, but I saw a copy of this 80-page book lying around at work and figured that I could use something to read in the gym.
The Dip is the hard slog between being barely competent at something ("beginner's luck" is the phrase Godin uses) and being the best in the world at it, and if you're not going to be able to slog through it, you should give up and try something else.One interesting point that Godin makes that I hadn't thought much about before is that while being well-rounded and good at most things is beneficial in school (I believe that the example he uses is that getting straight Bs is viewed as being better than getting Cs and Ds plus an A or two), it doesn't matter in adult life, where those who are most rewarded are those who excel in a particular field.

Read the book in an hour while waiting out rush hour traffic at the bookstore. While it wasn't a complete waste of time for me (I actually needed to hear some of the things Godin says in the book), the book definitely repeats the same message over and over again, sometimes using the exact same words. There were a few points I thought worth noting, and I jotted them down on a small napkin. If you're interested in this book, I suggest you save your time and read my napkin instead :).
I'll save you the bother of reading this book. His whole point is this: Only do the things you're going to be the best in the world at. If you won't be the best in the world at them - quit right now (if you've already started) or don't start (if you haven't yet). Which is laughable for a number of reasons. From the point where you start something to the point when you make an accomplishment a whole bunch of things happens:- the world changes (the market, the economy, the demand/supply ratio etc.
(c)No, it's not easy being a CEO you dumbass!The other thing I have issue with: not all the things we do are done for excellence.He says:The mature thing is not even to bother starting to snowboard because you’re probably not going to make it through the Dip. And the stupid thing to do is to start, give it your best shot, waste a lot of time and money, and quit right in the middle of the Dip.Yeah, dude, have you ever heard of a thing called recreational sport?
این کتاب کتاب رقابته، میگه اگه تو زمینه ای که داری کار میکنی رسیدن به اونجایی که هستی برای رقبا راحت
كتاب جميل ومتوسط الحجم تقوم فكرته الأساسية على أنه أحيانا يكون الانسحاب من طريق معين خيارًا أفضل من الإكمال فيه.. ولكن هذا الانسحاب يجب أن يكون انسحابًا استراتيجيًا.. أي أنه انسحاب غير ناتج عن تكاسل أو خوف بل ناتج عن إعادة تقييم للوضع في الوقت الحالي.. كذلك فإن الكتاب يشجع على أهمية الإصرار على إكمال المهام وعدم الانسحاب منها، ويوضح أن التركيز على مهمة واحدة بدلًا من التشتيت هو الطريق الوحيد لتكون الأفضل.. وأن الانسحاب من بعض المهام يصاحبه التمسك بأكثر المهام أهمية
Once you quit Cul-de-Sacs (dead-end projects, hobbies, jobs, etc.) you can refocus your resources on getting through The Dip and mastering those few things in life that matter to you most.How do you know which projects to quit?
You should quit if the project (hobby, job, etc.) has a dip that isn't worth the reward at the end.
Never quit anything with great long-term potential just because you can't deal with the stress of the moment.Final thought: "A woodpecker can tap twenty times on a thousand trees and get nowhere, but stay busy.
Or he can tap twenty-thousand times on one tree and get dinner."I chose dinner over staying busy.
I loved it!It's about how not to talk yourself into quitting your (work ,relationship, project, ..etc) just cuz it hurts or cuz you can't deal with the stress of the moment and taking the Quit as an intelligent strategic decision to give up the called dead-end situations, something with poor long-term potentials. The main point was awesome, but 85 pages were just too much !

یک مساله مهم وجود دارد؛ جسارت انتخاب یکی از دو مورد زیر:ول کردن کارهای اشتباه و چسبیدن به کار های درستسعدی هم شاید همین مضمون را (و چیزی فراتر از سخن گفتن ِ صرف را) در اندیشه داشت آنگاه که گفت:
مساله مهم دیگر اما این است که قبل از شروع هر کار بدانید که کجا و تحت چه شرایطی این کار را ول خواهید کرد.شیب مسیر طولانی و اغلب دشوار و دیوار بلندی ست که متمایزکننده یک حرفه ای و یک آماتور است...شیب منجر به کمیابی می شود و کمیابی ارزشمند است چون هر کسی را یارای ِ پیمودن ِ این راه نیست...پس به زبان ساده : اگر از عهده شیب برنمی آیید بهتر است اصلا آن را شروع نکنید
و می گه اگر در کار یا شرایطی هستین که پیشرفت شما متوقف شده اتفاقا باید اون رو ترک کنید:"Quitters never win and winners never quit." Bad advice!
چکیده کتابچیزی که خیلی باید در مسیر پیشرفت و رسیدن به خواسته هامون باید بهش آگاه باشیم، و این آگاه بودن به ما کمک می کنه مفهوم دیپ هست که شکلش اینه: محور عمودی میزان نتیجه ای که می گیریم رو نشون می ده و محور افقی میزان تلاش.فرض کنید یک کار جدیدی رو شروع کردید (از یاد گرفتن زبان یا موسیقی گرفته تا شروع کردن یک بیزنس جدید).
خطير.....
More places to win, stakes are higher!• Don't hope to succeed because you're the only one being considered.Know when to "quit" and when to "refuse to settle"Don't be mediocre at everything!Two types of quitting: Strategic and Reactive Quitting.Two curves for any situation:1- (The Dip)-Everything in life worth doing is controlled by the dip (or has a dip)-don't just endure the dip, lean into it, push harder, change the rules.- just because you know you're in the dip doesn't mean u have to live happily with it ..2- (The Cul De Sac)- french for "dead end"- you Work work work nothing much changes..- when you spot it, get off it fast!- It's keeping you away from doing something else..Focus your resources on something worth it.3- (The Cliff) -Bonus-You can't quit till you fall off, and the whole thing falls apart.- The dip creates scarcity, scarcity creates value.-Success comes thru times with ability to push through the moments where it's just easier to quit.- both the cliff and caldesac lead to failure.
I get two important lesson from this small but amazing book. firstly: we should have exit plan for our business for example determine the exit time during my job and answer to this questions: in which situation i have to leave my job? secondly: if you can not be great and famous or popular in wide market try to find a Niche Market and be the first one in small market.after all : highly recommended
يعلمك الكتاب متى تنسحب ولماذا وأن الإنسحاب ليس بفشل بل هو إعادة تموضع في مكان أفضل وفرص أوفر حظا2.على الرغم من كون الكتاب صغير وصفحاته فقط 80 الا ان المؤلف نجح في عرض نظرية الرقم (1) ونظرية المنخفض؛ بالنسبة لنظرية الرقم (1) فيستعرض المؤلف الأسباب التي تجعلك وتقودك للسعي بأن تكون الأفضل والمركز الأول فقك ولا شيء سوى ذلك فيضرب أحد الأمثلة بأنك عندما تمرض بمرض عضال يكون لا وقت لديك لتعرض نفسك على الأخصائيين المتميزين ليشخصوا المرض بل ستبحث وتبذل جهد عن الأخصائي رقم (1) فقط لذلك كل الناس تبحث عن رقم 1 وفقط لذلك كن أنت الرقم 1 وبشأن نظرية المنخفض فانه بكل بساطة تمثل التحدي الذي اما ان ينقلك للقمة لو يقودك للهوية ويشبه للى حد كبير المصطلح الاقتصادي Opportunity Cost وباختصار يستعرض الكاتب بان اسباب فشل اغلب الناس أنهم لا يعرفون متى ينسحبون بل وأن الملل هو الدافع الاساس للانسحاب الخاطىء أو غير المدروس ، فعلى سبيل المثال اثبتت الابحاث بأن الذين يعملونةفي التسويق غالبا يتوقفون عن متابعة عملائهم المحتملين بعد 5 عمليات محاولة بينما تثبت ذات الإحصائية بأن العملاء يحتاجون 7 محاولات ليقتنعوا .
مارست "الانسحاب" (أو الراحة المؤقتة كما أقنع نفسي أحيانًا 😅) في الفترة الأخيرة بشكل كبير وعلى مستويا
This book was a disappointing read with only two points - either stick with it if you think you'll be successful or quit and do something else that you will be successful at.
يمر الإنسان في حياته بمنخفضات يواجه فيها الفشليتحدث الكتاب بأكمله عن هذا المنخفض، والمسمى بالدب (تعريب :) )ـthe dipفعليك في هذا المنخفض أن تعمل بجد وأن لا تستسلم، وإلى لأصبحت عاديا كغيرك. بل أن المنخفض هو أحد الفلاتر التي تفلتر الناجحين من الفاشلينولكن يجب الانتباه أن بعض هذه المنخفضات تكون منتهية بطريق مسدود، ويكون الاستسلام المرحلي هو الطريق للنجاح طويل الأمدقصة الكتاب بسيطة جدا، وهذه هي طريقة سيث جودن، الذي يؤلف كتابا كاملا عن فكرة واحدة يعيد ويزيد فيه بالشرح في هذه الفكرةولهذا اعطيته ٣ نجوم
A short book (80 pages) that addresses a crucial question: when to quit? Quitting may seem a "shame" thing to do but not always. In fact, quitting is often a very strategic choice. Although the book is just 80 pages, it should be less I believe as the central core idea was repeated several times but, nonetheless, the book is still short so you won't get frustrated. Overall, a good light read. Required time: 2-3 hours.
کتاب دوست داشتنی ای بود؛ "اگر نمی توانید از عهده شیب این کار برآیید پس اصلا آن را شروع نکنید. اگر این قانون ساده را به خوبی یاد بگیرید، نسبت به شروع هر کاری بسیار سختگیرتر خواهید بود."
کتاب شیب یک مفهوم کلیدی دارد که سعی میکند باور به آن را به شیوههای گوناگون در ذهن شما نهادینه کند.
محور کلیدی کتاب آن است که هدفتان را بیابید، وقتی را آن را یافتید برای بهترین شدن در آن در حد جنون تلاش کنید.
این مفهوم را میتوانید در کتابهای دیگر هم ببینید.
به نظر من کتاب سرسختی آنجلا داکورث و نبرد هنرمند استیون پرسفیلد هم همین محور کلیدی را دارند.
آنچه که شیب را از کتابهای دیگر متمایز میکند پرداختن به مفهوم "رها کردن" در کنار مفهوم ثابت قدم بودن است.
ست گودین بر خلاف آنچه که تا به حال شنیده بودم

ست گودین بر خلاف آنچه که تا به حال شنیده بودم، رها کردن را در مقابل عزم و اراده نمیداند، بلکه آنرا مکمل سرسختی معرفی میکند.
يجيب الكتاب عن هذه الأسئلة : كيف تواجه المنخفضات التي تمر بها في حياتك ؟متى يكون الانسحاب -من أي شيء- خيار ممتاز ومتى يكون أسوأ خيار ؟كيف تتعامل مع الطرق المسدودة ، لحظات الألم ، البدايات ؟ما هي الأشياء التي تستحق حقاً الصمود والتحمل وما الأشياء التي يُعتَبر البقاء فيها كل يوم جديد خسارة جديدة ؟ما الآلية التي تتحقق بها الندرة وتتطور من خلالها حياة الإنسان ؟مع أني لا أؤمن تقريباً - لسبب أجهله - بهذا النوع من الكتب لكنني مدينة له لأنه جعلني أفهم العديد من الأمور بشكل واضح جداً ❤
This is a little book. Straightforward sentences without going into too much detail. It's a short, good read and I would recommend it to anyone to get a sense of what to pursue and what to let go. I only wish it was backed by studies as other books of this sort usually are. I may be wrong but I feel like Godin didn't put his best effort into it.
This book focuses on one key principle: the dip AKA that “long slog between starting and mastery.” You know what this is… the difference between the guy who is the resident golf pro at a country club and a member of the PGA tour, or the writer who has finished a manuscript and has gotten it rejected, but with a personal note to try again, and the agented, published writer.
Godin insists that you need to be able to determine what is a dip and what is a dead-end, and to make sure that you don’t waste energy on the dead-ends.
He says that “we fail when we get distracted by tasks we don’t have the guts to quit.” He tells how to choose the right tasks to begin, then how to push through obstacles (the Dip) to reach success.
Have the guts to do one or the other.”I read this book because it was recommended by TechNibble.• “Strategic quitting is the secret of successful organizations.” Strategic quitting isn’t the same as failing.• “Almost everything in life worth doing is controlled by the Dip...The Dip is the long slog between starting and mastery.”• Quit dead ends and refocus your time, energy, and resources.• Success goes to those who focus and obsess, not those who diversify.
Don't agree that going on a "quest" to be the best will always result in being the best (even if you follow all the rest of his advice).
Don't agree with the fact that grit and trying hard will change everything (although he doesn't quite go that far...
Don't agree that any one person hold's the definitive answer to what the best is - *even* if statistics can be found to support their opinions.
Certainly don't agree that there aren't structures in place that keep people from being the best, despite all their efforts.All that said.
کتاب از حجم خودش هم خیلی کم حجم تر بود .دوسش نداشتم متنش جذبم نمیکرد اینقد هم ک سعی شده بود زیاده گویی بشه و مثال هاش زیاد بود ک تمرکز روی مطلب رو از آدم میگرفت اما به هر حال چند جمله ایی توش بود ک ب خاطرش دو ستاره میشه بهش داد
كتاب مهم جدا
لا و لن أفهم لم كتب التنمية لا تزال تتصدر قائمة اهتمامات الجميع
