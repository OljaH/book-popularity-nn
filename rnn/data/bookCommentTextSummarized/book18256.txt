I repeat, Love & Gelato may trigger a dizzying yearning for gelato.
It took my mind off negative thoughts about life and marriage.It’s a romantic and mysterious story starring a very lively American girl who is sent to her father’s house in Italy by her grandmother after her mother succumbed to cancer.
While there is a mild love-triangle situation going on, it’s easy to discard it from one’s mind.So that’s the good part.
Super cute. I loved it.
and now i have a toothache from the sticky sweetness of this story, which is exactly what you would expect from a title like ‘love and gelato.’this book checked so many boxes for me, i dont even know where to begin.
so let me share my list: - coming of age story (loved the connection between lina and her mothers journal).
this gave me heart flutters and butterflies and all the warm fuzzy feels imaginable.
its definitely going to the top of my favourite contemporaries of all time - its the ultimate feel book book!
“You know, people come to Italy for all sorts of reasons, but when they stay, it’s for the same two things.”“What?”“Love and gelato.” The story narrated in this book is one of friendship, family, and first love. The characters enhanced the concept at the core of this book and the dynamic between each of them was written very well. Lina, after facing the trauma of losing her mother, flies to Italy for the summer in order to fulfill her mother’s last wish. Her mother also seemed to arrange for he
And she has come to realise that her mother’s college years were unlike anything she imagined.A romance the seemed to have ended badly, a proclamation that could change everything, and the story of a vibrant woman making her way through life, her mother may have secrets of her own.
We watch her open herself to the possibility of a life in Florence and makes a friend through a very unusual set of circumstances.Now that I have finished reading this book, the title seems to the most endearing thing about it because a story with such depth can only be described by Love and Gelato, and anything else wouldn’t seem right.
This might be the cutest book I've ever read. The entire thing was just so hopeful and HAPPY (even when the topic might not have been). The Italian scenery was gorgeous, the food was amazing, and all of the characters were so precious. I wish I could go back and read it all over again... or just go to Florence this summer myself. If you're looking for a good YA contemporary (or just a lovely book in general) I definitely recommend this one!!
BTAT 2017 book #2Possibly even a 4.5/5 starsTHIS. WAS. SO. CUTE.The plot? Adorable and intriguing. The characters? Pretty great. The setting? INCREDIBLE. So much good stuff in this BOOK!I loved the twists and the turns of the plot as well as the added element of Lina's mom's journal. And a book set in Italy just.....so good. So so good.If you enjoy contemporary romances you'll for sure enjoy this book.
hi can i give this book 10/5 stars because THIS BOOK IS FANTASTIC. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND. i LOVE THE CHARACTERS AND STORY AND THE COVER AND EVERYTHING. ok. also, love & gelato is an extremely easy and quick read that's addicting and amazing and i'm in love!!
I understand her mum had died six months previously, and it seemed like that was leading up to be an excuse featuring through the rest of the book, but she was rude.
Is a sentence I never want to hear again because what?Oh, we also get to introduced to Lina's totally tacky awesome best friend, who is like so idiotic funny.
I understand some people may think I didn't give this book a fair go, considering I decided to DNF at 10%, but honestly, I couldn't subject myself to this.
Super Sweet 💕🦄Happy Reading! Mel 🖤🐺🐾
Awww! This was a really cute summer read. I loved the whole Italian experience accompanied with lots of Italian history, gelato, and young love. Perfect! This story had it's ups and downs, I enjoyed the mystery part and I loved the character growth, I still feel giddy.4 stars!
5-I-NEED-AN-ITALIAN-DUDE-RIGHT-NOW-STARS!!!This book was successful in getting rid of my sucky reading slump.
This was the first contemporary book I've read this year and I absolutely adored it.
The plot, characters, and setting were captivating.The setting of the story is in Italy.
He helped Lina with revealing the truth about her mother's past life in Italy.
I really loved the personality of Ren, he's just the chill, cheerful, and adorable guy who decided to show Lina how beautiful Italy is.I really enjoyed this book.
3.5Really enjoyed this book!Mashup review featuring it coming soon!
This was pretty damn cute, you guys. All I want to do now is go to Italy and fall in love with some Nutella pastries. Insert gif of Emma Stone saying YUM here.
This book tells the story of Lina, a girl who moves to Italy after her mom dies.
This book was the perfect thing to kick back with in the warm weather.I absolutely adored the Italian setting in Love and Gelato.
I have wanted to visit Italy my whole life, and reading this book made me want to go even more!The journaling aspects in Love and Gelato really drew me in.
Something about that made me love the story even more.Love and Gelato tells the story of a girl who is given her mom’s old journal and is set in Italy.
This is another one of those ‘cutie-sweetie’ type books with a memorable book cover....one I’ve seen mentioned for years with warm-hearted reviews.So....I grabbed a freebie library - overdrive ebook copy. Quick enjoyable read. Young Adult Coming-of-Age....A taste of Italy ... Florence Rome...Tuscany...pizza ... gelato... ...a little historical mystery...family feelings of displacement and confusion...to one of understanding...military cemetery twist plot ...Readers immediately feel connection to the characters ...love is in the air.....flirty & fluffy......will definitely ‘require’ a yummy gelato treat for readers!!!Italy 🇮🇹....Pizza 🍕....Gelato 🍧....Romance ❤️...3.5 enjoyable - again - not earth shaking!
To be honest, I was more interested in the gelato part than the love part, but it was still pretty cute.

"You know, people come to Italy for all sorts of reasons, but when they stay, it's for the same two things.""What?""Love and gelato." When 16-year old Lina’s mother passes away from pancreatic cancer, she is encouraged by her grandmother to spend the summer in Tuscany in order to get to know Howard – a father she never even knew existed.

Lina would have never guessed she’d end up living in a cemetery, or that her mother left a journal regarding her own time spent in Italy or that she would be uncovering a huge secret during her summer abroad.Love and Gelato was an instant “yes please” due to the title and adorable cover.
The story was a little bit .
3 Stars from me since I’m old and horrible and I got annoyed that the supposedly huuuuuuge secret was not only 100% obvious, but that it took almost half of the book for Lina to figure out what was going on.

I did not expect to like this book as much as I did.
It was funny and cute but also moving and devastatingly sad at times.
It was amazing to learn so much about Italy and Florence, it felt like I was there with Lina and Ren. I really really want to go to Italy now!
I don't usually read books like this where the protagonist goes on a journey of self discovery or whatever, but this book lifted my heart.
I loved the writing style, and I'm looking forward to any future works by Jenna Evans Welch._____
Love & Luck
This was a cute story about a girl finding a way to move on with life after losing her mother.
Lina made a promise to her dying mother, finding herself in Italy with a father she had never met.
No, what drove me bananas was the way Lina chose to read it a bit at a time in dribs and drabs.
I just didn’t buy that Lina was too overcome with grief to keep reading.So while I enjoyed reading about Lina’s experiences in Italy, having her mother’s diary interspersed with the story irritated me and had me wanting to skim at parts.
[3.5] Now I'm craving some authentic, Italian gelato and cute, Italian guy with it.
I’m super thankful for those of you who recommended it!Also, I think it’s official: I like Romance novels.
Not straight-up Romance, but books like Love and Gelato where it’s contemporary mixed-in with humor, reliable characters, and an adorable romance — count me in (and recommend me more books, haha).
So the little things Lena noticed as an “American tourist” were entirely realistic.
The writing, in turn, was good and simple.
But, hey, I’m not complaining.Overall, this was yet another book going into my “cute and easy” reads.
I’m going to have to get the second book sometime soon.
Fans of the young-adult genre will definitely enjoy Jenna Evans Welch's debut novel: Love & Gelato.
It incorporates grief, family issues, age-appropriate romance, and the Italian culture.
Overall, I liked it.
The cultural components were my favorite parts.
I also could very much appreciate the lengths the heroine went to in order to learn about her paternity – I was in the same boat at a point in my adolescence and her curious desperation felt very familiar.
The only other thing I can say is it's been a few days since finishing this very easy read, and I'm still craving gelato.
I liked that part too :)My favorite quote:“So...
Italian gelato.
Love & Gelato was a cute, quick, summer read and just what I needed for the plane journey, on which I read it from start to finish but unfortunately, despite this, I didn't fall in love with it.I didn't really warm tothe characters or feel any strong connection towards them(other than Howard who was a sweetheart) and overall I just couldn't get past the incredibly short time period this book was set over, considering the amount of events that occurred.
It was fun, it was cute and incredibly easy read and one I'm sure would be the perfect summer read for younger teens.
*4.5 stars*After finishing this book, (well also during reading it) I had major cravings for some gelato. It was super cute and mysterious. I couldn't put it down! Because of this book, I want to go to Italy even more now.
Sonia met my eyes in the mirror. “You know, people come to Italy for all sorts of reasons, but when they stay, it’s for the same two things.” “What?” “Love and gelato.”  I know I say this a lot, but seriously-What a pleasant surprise!! Seriously. There are few books that manage to surprise me, and it’s even rarer that I fall for a book set overseas. Don’t ask why and I won’t explain-Just know that there are really only two books that have successfully stolen my heart that take place outside of
“You know, people come to Italy for all sorts of reasons, but when they stay, it’s for the same two things.” “What?” “Love and gelato.”
Don’t ask why and I won’t explain-Just know that there are really only two books that have successfully stolen my heart that take place outside of the US…and they are Anna and the French Kiss and The Fever series.
Perhaps its as simple as Paris and Italy being places I’ve always wanted to go to and these stories transporting me there with fun journeys, vivid story-telling (whether inaccurate or not, I do not care-again, I’m side-eyeing you, Bug. Just…don’t lol), love and romance, and, of course, Gelato.
But I really have to get something out of my chest: I am SO TIRED of American authors writing books about Italy/Italian people without even bothering to double-check what the hell they are talking about.So the main character is Lina (really?
Her mother dies of cancer and she has to move to Italy to live with her estranged father.
okay) and that's when it starts getting reaaaally annoying.She meets Sonia, her dad's assistant (or something like that), and OF COURSE Sonia is a "tall, gazelle-like woman with coffee-colored skin and rows of gold bracelets on each arm.
Italians are all tall, beautiful gazelle-like people with coffee-colored skin.
Love & Gelato was the first contemporary novel I've read this year, and I absolutely enjoyed it. Although this book was marketed as a love story, I found the romance between Lina and Ren to be nearly insignificant next to the novel's overall premise: A girl desperately trying to cope with the sudden loss of her beloved (and frustratingly secretive) mother. In its totality, this book earned a spot in my favorites shelf because it entertainingly delineated the importance of love, honesty, and perseverance. And if I must say so, I am all over stories set in Europe.
This was a really cute & fun contemporary read and I'm glad I decided to pick it up at the library! :)
