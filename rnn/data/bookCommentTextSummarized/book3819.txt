When all the other little girls wanted to be princesses - do you know what I wanted to be? And no, it wasn't a vampire, either... it was...HERCULE POIROT'S SIDEKICK!!!The fact that I actually took the time to edit my face into that picture should tell you something about a) my Poirot love, and b) the kind of hopelessly boring day I have suffered through :D
This was my first Agatha Christie novel and it definitely did not disappoint! I was not expecting that ending, which is obviously a good thing in a murder mystery story, but I am proud of myself for picking up on some other clues. I am so impressed by how she was able to weave this intricate of a story in only 200 pages and I can't wait to pick up another one of her novels in the future!
5 stars to Agatha Christie's Murder on the Orient Express.
I chose to read this Christie spectacular after finishing "And There Were None." She's such a treasure - never disappoints.A train.
A murder.
Multiple suspects.
Nearly an alibi for everyone.
How did this seemingly impossible murder occur?
But with good reason as this plot twist will have your knickers locked down (and not just in a bunch!).The plot is just too delicious.
And Christie wrote this nearly 100 years ago.
That's why it's a 5 for me -- it's pure good storytelling without anything in the way.

But here we are!I’m also not sure why it took me so long to write this review (two months, to be exact, so actually not that long for me but still) but again, here we are.I don’t actually really want to say much on this book, which is astounding in its own right because my number one hobby is making up various excuses for me to wax romantic on various subjects and generally listen to myself.But!
”The train, it is as dangerous as a sea voyage!”So, this was my first Agatha Christie book and considering how much fun I had while I read it, it definitely won’t be my last. ;-) Yes, you read correctly and your mind didn’t play tricks on you:I had  F.U.N!!! I actually enjoyed reading this so much I constantly found myself giggling with delight! *lol* I swear there’s nothing better than a mystery or a puzzle you need to solve and I guess in this particular case it might have even been both! ;-PT
XD By the end of the book I felt like a squirrel, gathering all the pieces until I was finally able to make sense of them!
*LOL* All I know is that I solved the mystery and I’m so damn happy I’m still grinning and laughing like crazy!!!24 hours after finishing the book!
;-PThe solution and ending:(view spoiler)[”If so and so is lying, on what point are they lying and what is the reason for the lie?”I don’t even know how often I asked myself this question throughout the entire book, it must have been pretty often though!
If you're on a train (or boat, or island), planning to commit a nice, unsolvable murder, and you find out Hercule Poirot is one of the guests . . . Just change your plans. That is all.I'd like to know if anyone has ever solved this particular murder mystery. It's mind-boggling, and deservedly one of Agatha Christie's better-known books.
I just now remember watching ‘‘The Tourist’’ with Angelina Jolie, and wasn’t the scene in the train the one that was going to have in impact on everything to come?
JUST when I thought Agatha Christie missed the target, Mr. Poirot’s great intelligence unravelled the case to its fullest and my eyes got so big… Let me tell you something: You may thing you have, but you have NEVER read a mystery book such as this one.
I'm finally going to read a Poirot book!
=) ♥The wonderful Hercule Poirot can not ever go on any holidays without someone being murdered.
The man murdered in named Ratchett, but we find out later on in the story this is an alias.
Poirot interviews all of the passengers, makes a list and the little grey cells start to formulate.
I'm not going to give out the spoiler to those that have not read this yet, but I think it's the perfect murder and I loved the outcome.
You will just have to read the book or watch the show to find out why I say that, brilliant!
‘’Some crimes God does not forgive!’’ Last week, I watched (for the gazillionth time…) ITV’s 2010 production of ‘’Murder on the Orient Express’’ with the inimitable David Suchet in the role of our beloved Hercule Poirot and it prompted certain thoughts in my mind. Why is this considered one of Christie’s finest creations? Many say that, arguably, it is her best work and this view I do share.I don’t think any of us need a synopsis. To say the story is well-known would be an understatement. Even
‘’Some crimes God does not forgive!’’
Even people who haven’t read the book know of the outstanding outcome and the resolution of, possibly, the most controversial murder (but is it a ‘’crime’’?) in Christie’s marvellous works.
God and Law can’t always protect us...Here, Hercule discovers that his little grey cells are only a small part of the solution.
A work that doesn’t ask the reader to think of the ‘’who has done it’’ question, but to contemplate on the ‘’what would you have done’’ issue.
Some crimes God doesn’t forgive….My reviews can be found in: https://theopinionatedreaderblog.word...
So is David Suchet who narrated the audiobook (and played Poirot in the TV show).This story is set on a filled to capacity train, heading from Stamboul (Istanbul) to London.
Bouc is the one more quick to jump to conclusions where as Poirot is very methodical and waits till he has all the information and all the clues fit before committing to the assignment of guilt.
I liked how Poirot, Bouc, and Dr. Constantine kept going over the evidence with each other.
With so many suspects the evidence kept going in circles and making my head spin.
I fear it is impossible to say too much about this book without spoilers.
Because of this I will be brief so you can never go back and say, "I would have loved this book, but that Matthew guy from Goodreads ruined it for me!" So, here is my quick but hopefully useful review.This is a classic mystery.
You like mysteries?
You have to have to read this!
So much fun meeting and learning about them all.Current mysteries have nothing on Christie.
But, now I am getting too close to spoilers.Read it!
That is probably the biggest compliment a reviewer can pay to a mystery novel.
Now, call me an idiot if you feel so inclined, but I personally thought the mystery was very well written.
Especially given that we discover clues in time with Hercule Poirot & are limited to knowing only what he knows.
The conclusion of this novel took it to a place I never would've conceptualized & it was such a fun ride getting there.As for the rest, I recommend you pick this up and discover it for yourself.
A very approachable murder mystery novel with a classic feel & unique twist!
A train stopped at midnight in the snow. A dead body found in a compartment. Twelve stab wounds leave no doubt it was murder. And Hercule Poirot, tasked with solving the crime, is certain the culprit is a passenger on the Orient Express. The first clue that Murder on the Orient express will be a laborious read arrives shortly after the murder victim is discovered. Among the clues is a scrap of paper which reads (view spoiler)[ “– member little Daisy Armstrong.” (hide spoiler)] From this clue, Po
The message on the scrap of paper leads Poirot to assert that (view spoiler)[the murder victim is a man named Cassetti who is wanted for the murder of an innocent girl named Daisy Armstrong.
(hide spoiler)] Poirot makes the connection between the scrap of paper and the murder victim with unbearable convenience.
Poirot dismisses probable explanations, clings to his illogical assumption about the murder victim, and proceeds to investigate the crime by interviewing every passenger on the train in a designated room.
When this repetitive process finally concludes, Poirot then interviews every passenger again while digging through their luggage in their individual compartments.

Actual rating: 4.5 🌟This was my first, but definitely not my last, Agatha Christie book, and I truly loved it!It was a wonderful mystery that kept me guessing the whole way through.I really liked the structure of the novel. Each character getting their own chapter was a genius idea, it really helped me to get to know them. All of them seemed realistic and well developed, which was surprising, considering the amount of people and the rather short length of the book.The writing style was very atmospheric and enjoyable to read. It matched the genre perfectly.
I’ve never read an Agatha Christie novel.
Why is this a big deal, you might be asking yourself if you have also never jumped on the Christie train.
Did you know that Agatha Christie is the best selling novelist of all time, second only to the Bible and the works of Shakespeare in terms of sales?
From what I’ve gathered, each Poirot novel stands perfectly well on its own, and that was definitely the case with Murder on the Orient Express.
I will be reading more Christie novels, and soon.For more of my reviews, as well as my own fiction and thoughts on life, check out my blog, Celestial Musings.
All aboard to the mystery!  WILL THE REAL POIROT PLEASE STAND UP? My visual memory of the famous fictional detective Hercule Poirot is the actor Sir Peter Ustinov, yes, I know, he doesn’t look like he’s described on books (and even according Agatha Christie’s daughter, he doesn’t behave on screen like the book detective) but when I was a kid, I’ve never read any Agatha Christie’s novels, meanwhile I have watched several of the theatrical films and TV movies made by Peter Ustinov and along with
My visual memory of the famous fictional detective Hercule Poirot is the actor Sir Peter Ustinov, yes, I know, he doesn’t look like he’s described on books (and even according Agatha Christie’s daughter, he doesn’t behave on screen like the book detective) but when I was a kid, I’ve never read any Agatha Christie’s novels, meanwhile I have watched several of the theatrical films and TV movies made by Peter Ustinov and along with watching him in several Biblical movies, well, that image stuck in me.Curiously enough, I remember watched the 1974’s adaptation to film of Murder on the Orient Express but I didn’t remember that Ustinov wasn’t in that particular adaptation but Albert Finney.
قاعدة ما قبل قراءة الروايات البوليسية رقم ١ :لا تقرأ الريفيوهات لا تقرأ الريفيوهاتلا تقرأ الريفيوهات و إلا ستندم -_-
I don’t think i’m exaggerating though.Second, the way the story was written, the details, the clues — it’s like you, as the reader, are the one solving the case which actually is the reason why this book will get you so hooked.
The way he was written as a character, i believe, was well-thought of (if that is the perfect term for it).I was amazed with his POV because he was able to think of all possible scenarios, probabilities of each evidence happening, and how he was able to analyze anything that he was told.
The Great Depression, doesn't effect him....Quite strange but the train's coaches are full at this time of year too, poor concerned Poirot, can't get a first class compartment, luckily Monsieur Bouc, a director of the train company, and friend of Hercule's, is on board, helps the detective.
Poirot shares a compartment with a young, likable, American Hector MacQueen, working for an evil looking fellow American, a millionaire by the name of Samuel Ratchett.
The problem for Hercule is, everyone of the passengers has a good alibi, Mr. or Monsieur Poirot, has a lot of time to think, nothing adds up...
All aboard the murder train!A long time ago when I was in high school and dinosaurs still roamed the earth I read a whole bunch of Agatha Christie novels.
In fact, since the murder took place in a confined space where people were coming and going that everything you need to know is given to us as Poirot builds a timeline and uses a diagram to place the location of people in the train car at various times.
What are you waiting for?Now, the review for fellow mystery and Christie lovers who have read the book(or like me, re-read umpteen number of times till the pages came out of the binding!).(view spoiler)[Whodunits are like magic tricks.
It shows what a master of the craft she is.The Murder on the Orient Express is a classic locked room mystery: in the snowed-in train, one of the twelve passengers have to be guilty.
In fact, Poirot is the coincidence, the joker in the pack.I have not read another mystery where all the likely suspects are guilty!
Murder on the Orient Express is my second Agatha Christie novel.
All of Christie's novels(I'm basing this on all 2 of her books, I've read) have a simple layout, A murder is committed, an array of suspects and just enough info to pose a theory.
With Orient a man is murdered on a train, all 12 people on the train car are suspects, the train is snowed in and the police cannot reach it.
This sounds so simple but I didn't guess the murderer.
As soon as the murderer was revealed I felt dumb because it was so obvious and therein lies the genius of Agatha Christie.
من الصعب حقا ان تقرأ رواية بوليسية ممتازة لمرتين
Murder on the Orient Express is one of Agatha Christie's most loved works.
Adapted for radio, film and television, most people have some idea to what you are referring when you mention it.
A classic whodunit with Christie's signature styling on characters and investigation.
I adore Hercule Poirot and grew up binging on Christie's works.
I read this book as a child, and of course have seen a couple of movie adaptations, but in spite of that, I still had a rollicking good time reading this again.
Finally, I’ve read this book! And now I can see the new movie. Agatha and Poirot are geniuses.
On the second night of the trip, a man is murdered, and tensions rise when the train gets stuck in a snowdrift.
Poirot realizes the murderer must still be on the train, and sets out to interview everyone and figure out who is lying.
This is a clever story, and I can see why it's one of Christie's most beloved mysteries.Dan Stevens' performance was so marvelous that after finishing I looked up what other books he has narrated and was thrilled to see he also did a reading of And Then There Were None.
I also imagined sun and heat and maybe something typically oriental but my own stupidity stopped me from realizing that in Winter, you know, it's cold.
The only thing this novel lacked of was suspense.
And that's one thing a crime novel should have for sure.
Not even the big murderer revelation was all that thrilling anymore.
And Then There Were None was much better when it came to thrill and excitement.In a nutshell: I liked the book but I can't wait to love the film.Find more of my books on Instagram
