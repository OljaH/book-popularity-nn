Τι ωραίες αναμνήσεις. Πόσο ωραία σειρά βιβλίων για ένα παιδί. Κάθε καλοκαίρι, ήταν τα βιβλία που μου κρατούσαν την καλύτερη συντροφιά.
More on the nostalgia trail... the very first Secret Seven book I read. I tried to start a similar club in our small suburban town in Kerala after reading this - but needless to say, failed miserably. :(
I decided to reread an old childhood favourite. I love the Secret Seven. This isn't one of the best, but it's still pretty gripping, even for a 44-year-old!
5 stars 🌟
Jack's annoying sister Susie has decided to start her own club, and of course she decides to trick Jack and the others.
What she doesn't realize is that she's actually giving them real clue to a mystery!
Peter at first doesn't believe it, but the other boys go adventuring and discover clues that help solve a string of robberies.Twice the girls are told that they have to 'stay out of' things.
Seriously annoys me the most about this series, Peter and keeping the girls away from anything fun.
Still though an enjoyable mystery and another quick read.
Meni su najdraži Pet prijatelja, ipak i ovo je simpa.

Susie starts her own group, with a not very original name24 June 2013	I guess the reason that I like these Secret Seven books (as well as the other Enid Blyton books, and I have churned through quite a lot of them over the year and a half since I decided to read through them again) is that they are short and can pretty much be completed in a day (which also boosts the number of books that I have read for the year so, if I am lucky, I may be able to get to the one hundred and fifty mark, though my goal is still one hundred.

(I only thought it was ok because of the lack of description.
But yes, I know that it is a childrens book so don't pine at me)It might be because this book series is aim for younger persons than me or just because I've been reading too many Agatha Christie novels.
I wish to high heavens that I had read this when I was younger!
I always wanted to read books like this but, my mum had her versions in the attic and I didn't even know they existed!
Darn!Well anyway, I thought overall that the plot was short and sweet.
Reread.This book exemplified just why I have always been a Famous Five and not a Secret Seven person. There are so many characters with no differences in personality that I have no idea which of the seven did what, and their actions go beyond the usual Blyton improbable into Just Plain Stupid.
I never get tired of reading The Secret Seven!
The Secret Seven Book 4*Secret Seven on the Trail* Now, this story stands out particularly from the Secret Seven series.
The plot begins with Susie (Who is getting bit by bit into the spotlight) as she forms her own 'Famous Five' Society and try to envy the Secret Seven by framing up a fake suspicious mystery to fool the Secret Seven that turns out to be true as a coincidence.
The Second one is discovering the fake mystery turning out to be a real one.
This book is written very nicely, with witty dialogues and twisting storyline that you surely can't guess.
Mischievous , clever thinking weird.
C'est pas trop excitant... mais on peut le lire dans un soir... alors c'est bien si tu as besoin des pages.
Nice
If you like tricks read this book. This book is about Jacks sister who tricks him into to going somewhere and jack and George get a message. The seven also sort something out but what?
Good
Meanwhile, Susie, Jack's annoying sister wants to join the Secret Seven but she's not allowed so she takes matters into her own hands and forms her own society.
Susie comes up with a plan to trick Jack that the Famous Five actually have an adventure and the Secret Seven don't.
We have seen what his home life is like and we had a lot of time focusing on Jack in this book and his relationship with Susie.
As you might know I really like Janet as a character but unfortunately she's doing a lot less in every book.
Revisiting the books of my youth out of a feeling of nostalgia! I loved Enid Blyton when I was younger and can't wait to re-read these with my own children.
Susi sengaja menjebak Jack dan Sapta Siaga dengan mengarang cerita kalau di puncak bukit, tepatnya di Lumbung Tigger akan ada pertemuan penjahat.
Tanpa diduga, yang semula cuma rekayasa, ternyata di Lumbung Tigger terdapat pertemuan rahasia antara Zeb, Larry, dan seorang temannya.Sapta Siaga berhasil mengungkap teka teki, Learning dan Darling yang merupakan perusahaan timah hitam, dan kata yang sering penjahat tersebut ucapkan di Lumbung yaitu simpangan simpangan , itu adalah simpangan di stasiun tepatnya di rel kereta api yang akan dipindahkan ke jalur dilansir, juga kata enam lebih dua adalah jam dimana kereta barang tersebut datang.
It has a bit more inter-child rivalry than I've seen in other SS books, and the characterization of the villains seems a little off (they're very talkative and divulge quite a bit of information without suspecting the children).Jack's annoying sister Susie starts up a rival society (the "Famous Five" named after those famous books by Enid Blyton ;-) and claims that they are in the middle of an exciting adventure.
Jack eavesdrops on them and hears an amazing story about thugs meeting at the abandoned Tigger's Barn; he doesn't realize that Susie and her friends are just making up a wild story for his benefit.
He and George tail Susie and Jeff, who lose them and head back home; Jack and George rush to Tigger's Barn ...
For slightly younger children perhaps than the Famous Five or Mystery of the...
series; 7-9 year-olds rather than 8-12 I'd say.
This one I remember as my favourite.
Again, maybe because it was the first Secret Seven story I read.
The Seven are irritated by Jack's clever but annoying sister Suzie's organisation of a rival society and determine to trick them by making up a mystery for Suzie's gang to investigate.
While trying to execute this malicious scheme the Seven are, inadvertently, given a message by a gang of robbers and endeavour to uncover their full plans before the crime can be committed.
Young detectives for grown-up mysteriesMeet Peter and his sister Janet, Jack, Barbara, George, Pam and Colin. A group of child detectives that will get tangled in all sorts of adventures that will make them juggle school attendance, homework, and the ineffable desire to solve the mysteries they stumble upon. Juvenile sense of wonder, the principal ingredient in Enid Blyton works, is a guarantee of a good moment for readers of all ages.Here, something mysterious is going on at Tigger's Barn, and the Secret Seven are intrigued.
Enid Blyton is an amazing childrens author, bestselling in the world. Although almost undiscovered by Americans.This series (The Secret Seven) Features 7 children who form a backyard club. They love to have meetings with SecretPasswords, etc. Soon, they begin to fall into mysteries. This series is for the younger reader than the other series Enid Blyton wrote for children. 8-10 years old maybe.Great reading. introduce your children to Enid Blyton today!
I read Famous Five and Secret Seven about the same time. I do not know if it is just me, but I found the Secret Seven mysteries to be a bit more mysterious… if you know what I mean.But yes, all the early lessons I have learnt about friendships and life are from reading Enid Blyton Books early on. So I thoroughly encourage all children to read them. It is like passing a passage of life and the secret seven series is no different.
This is a pretty good railway-based mystery and the guys actually make a decent attempt to go about solving it this time, rather than relying on coincidences to find the answers. It is good to see Jack with his characteristics back too.
The very first secret seven book I had read and it is a typical Enid Blyton mystery and it is fun and easy to read perfect for pre teen age and mostly fun .The big group of seven children and not to forget the ever saviour dog ,this group of children go about solving mysteries in their own way.
AMAZING!!!Is something mysterious happening at Tigger's Barn? Peter thinks it's a hoax. The Jack overhears an extraordinary conversation which leads the Seven on a trail of adventure!
Secret 7 aren't my fav but the kids love them! This was one of the better books in the series
Great!
