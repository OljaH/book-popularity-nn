A summary of every Poirot book where Hastings is the sidekick:
تم قرائتها تحت عنوان:ذات القناع الأسود

If i'm honest I didn't realise how many Poirot's I had not read.So this was a book of short stories published in"The Sketch" through 1923 and although they are not all excellent (some are better than others) they are all good fun.
They all showcase Poirot's prodigious talent in a variety of differing situations.
Ably "assisted" as ever by the wonderful Captain Hastings who bumbles through every case wondering what on earth Poirot is up to.
A great collection of short stories for every Poirot fan
A collection of eleven short stories featuring Hercule Poirot. because of the short story format there are too many coincidences, loose ends and often a boring end. None of the stories hold your attention for long. Avoidable read
This is an interesting collection of Poirot stories; first published in 1924 and all of which feature Hastings as narrator.
The stories involve missing jewels, blackmail, mysterious insurance claims, the even more intriguing case of a ‘very cheap flat,’ in an expensive part of London (unheard of!) which piques Poirot’s interest, and more.
Although I do prefer novels to short stories, this was an interesting book.
Poirot is at his ease in these stories – brimming with confidence in his abilities and always eager to take on a new case.
This is the third Poirot book, and the very first collection of short stories featuring Poirot and Hastings.
Ne mislim da je ova zbirka kriminalističkih priča o Herkulu Poarou loša, ali su romani daleko bolji.
Poirot Investigates is a nice, compact selection of stories about cases quickly and concisely solved.
Occasionally I even solved the crime well in advance of Poirot.
What's not to love about Hercule Poirot?
Okay, yes he is conceited.
However, it seems almost impossible that someone so infinitely ahead of everyone else in their field could be anything but conceited.
Modesty in such a person would seem disingenuous.
I haven't read much Christie, only Murder on the Orient Express comes to mind, but I will be reading more thanks to Poirot Investigates.
"The Adventure of the Western Star" (3 stars)-Poirot and Hastings are called in to keep a woman's most expensive jewel from being stolen from a Chinamen (yeah you read that right).
I do have to say that once again I thought that how Poirot put things together was a bit much though."The Adventure of the Cheap Flat" (2 stars)-I liked the BBC version of this story better.
"The Kidnapped Prime Minister" (3 stars)-I found that most of these short stories are really Poirot just explaining to Hastings why he's stupid.
"The Chocolate Box" (4 stars)-You read about a case that Poirot solved, but was wrong about who the murderer was.
This was the tightest-written, most well-plotted little collection of short stories. Only one out of 11 felt the tiniest bit flat. I cared about the characters, I cared about the solutions and I will definitely read this again.
I’m quite new to reading Agatha Christie but the few full novels I have read have been thoroughly enjoyable. This volume...not so much. Something about this collection of short stories just got on my nerves. I guess in the novels, Poirot is more diluted, his vanity and disregard for Hastings’ brain power is less in-your-face..what saved it from 2 stars was that David Suchet narrated. Even that was double edged as his female voice was terrible! My advice: skip this volume and move right along!
Ova kolekcija mi je bolje legla nego prethodna pošto je većina pričica duža pa ima mesta da se Agata raspiše i ipak malo bolje zakuva. Na par mesta bilo mi je suviše naivno ali sobzirom od kada je knjiga neću joj uzeti to za zlo.Sve u svemu odlična kolekcija.
A collection of short stories. Although each story is complete I still wished for more. (I’m greedy that way 🤷🏼♀) But they are good little mysteries. And, the best part is that I finally figured one out before Poirot revealed the answer! Yay me! Granted, Poirot said it was so easy he was surprised Col. Hastings didn’t figure it out by himself. But I’m still going to count it. 🧐

David Suchet, with his desire to create a more nuanced character (and 20 years in which to develop him), was able to take this as the basis for Poirot’s early years, and then develop him through the 1940s incarnation – someone who wants to retire and, as he ages, grows slightly gruffer – to the final Poirot, an older, justifiably famous man who now understands humankind all too well, and begins to wonder about the things he missed in life.
Öykü okumayı çok severim; ancak gizem-polisiye türündeki öykülerin bir roman kadar keyif vermediğini düşünüyorum. Agatha Christie okumayı da çok seviyorum; fakat bu kadar kolay çözülen olaylarını okumaktan pek tat almadım.
Some good, some mediocre and some great.- The adventure of the westerns star -5- The tragedy at Marsdon Manor - 3- The adventure of the cheap flat - 2- The mystery of Hunter's Lodge - 3- The million dollar bond robbery- 4- The adventure of the egyptian tomb - 2 - The jewel robbery at the Grand Metropolitan - 3- The kidnapped prime minister - 5- The disappearance of mr Davenheim - 4- The adventure of the Italian nobleman - 3- The case of the missing will - 4The thing with short stories is, i often can't really get into the story.
3.5 stars. This is definitely the best (and the funniest) of the three Christie short story collections I've read so far, but I still can't quite bring myself to give it full four stars, I just don't love her short stories as much as her novels.
It better be you.Fair warning, I'm not going to to over all eleven novellas - just a few.The Adventure of the Western Star:(view spoiler)[In this novella, Poirot receives a visit from Miss Mary Marvell.
(hide spoiler)] It was a good novella - now on to the next one.The Tragedy at Marsdon Manor:(view spoiler)[In this novella, Poirot believes that an old (not really) drying man committed suicide after insuring his life for the benefit of his wife.
(hide spoiler)]The Case of the Missing Will:(view spoiler)[So this novella was kind of cute.
The Adventure of The Western Star.
I'm almost positive this was a Poirot Presents on PBS because I knew the story as soon as it started.
Great story.
A really sad story about how a man was used and then murdered.
The Adventure of The Cheap Flat.
This one was a little confusing to me.
Another story showing cruelty for someone you are supposed to love.
A bit confusing as to what was going on.
The Jewel Robbery at The Grand Metropolitan.
Very good story.
Very good story.
Very good story.
An okay story.

مجموعة قصص بوليسية بطلها المحقق بوارو ، تشبه في تكوينها كثيرا شيرلوك هولمز.
محقق عبقري يسكن في إحدي البيوت بلندن ولديه ال "سنيد" أو صديق المحقق الذي يساعده في كثير من القضايا ، بينما صاحبة المنزل تعني بهم من آن لآخر وتخبره بقدوم أحدهم ليستشيره في جريمة قتل أو سرقة.
ما علينا...المهم أن المحقق بوارو هنا كان شديد الغرور والاعتداد بنفسه ، وكثير السخرية والاستختفاف بصديقه "هستنجز" علي عكس هولمز ، وقد كان بوارو نسخة ذكرية من الآنسة ماربل (إحدي شخصيات أجاثا كريستي المشهورة) في طريقة البحث عن الحقيقة.
So, I'm rereading Christie in publication order.
I'm not sure I will read all of the short story collections, but I saw this one at Powell's for cheap when I was there with OB, so I grabbed it.Overall, this is a satisfying collection of short stories starring Poirot, and narrated by Hastings.
The compilation was published in 1924, after Murder on the Links.
The Man in the Brown Suit was also published in 1924.This was a first read for me, although I have previously read at least a few of the stories, and I've seen all of the David Suchet adaptations.
The third volume in the collection of Christie's Poirot series, a collection of short stories, better than most mystery collections, I would have to assume, having been written by the best selling author of all time.
IS a device.One way to appreciate these essentially tightly written stories is that the still young Christie is developing her chops as a young mystery writer, sharpening her little narrative hooks, polishing this great dandy Poirot as a character, with his fussiness and ego and order and logic and insistence on the importance of the use of "grey cells" in the solving of crime.
One or two exceptional short stories, most of the others are okay. Enjoyable and quick read, but I definitely enjoy the full length Poirot novels better than this short story collection.
A mixed bag of short stories featuring Poirot and Captain Hastings. These were written early on in Christie's career and although entertaining, they became a little repetitive. I much prefer the full-length novels.
No me gustan los libros que son un conjunto de cuentos o historias pero por tratarse de Agatha Christie y Hercules Poirot lo tenia que leer!!
Una de las cosas que me gusta de esta escritora es que en todos sus libros te presenta un escenario, un misterio y los posibles culpables y conforme va avanzando la historia el lector va sacando sus conclusiones de quien es el culpable pero en este libro los relatos son tan cortos y los detalles tan limitados que no se puede sacar tus deducciones.
Si ya eres fan de Agatha Christie y Hercules Poirot este libro te va a gustar pero como primer acercamiento a esta escritora no lo recomiendo.

Je suis un peu déçue, je crois que les formats courts sur des enquêtes d'Hercule Poirot ne me conviennent pas... Quelques affaires m'ont quand même plu mais pas la majorité.
My first anthology of the year, and my first Christie or Poirot anthology. It also marks the start of a run of four anthologies in my reading list. Anthologies are a difficult thing to get right. Apart from the need to manage the theme of the anthology, there's nearly always a couple of weaker stories in the mix. Somehow a weaker story in an anthology is that much more noticeable than a weaker chapter in a novel. This collection,  Poirot Investigates , represents the first collection of Christie
, represents the first collection of Christie's Hercule Poirot short stories.
Initially published in the UK with only eleven stories, I read an ebook of the US edition which came with an extra three stories.Opening with The Adventure of the "Western Star" and we're straight into the first Poirot story I already know from TV.
Japp bet where Poirot has to solve the case with only his little grey cells and without leaving his apartment.
Obviously, Cristie was taking her time to build the character of Monsier Poirot.
Poirot is, unarguably, more egoist (boasts of his grey cells every now and then :p ), and proud, at the same time very methodical.
And I would wonder why almost all detective stories would require a detective with super-inhuman intelligence and a companion (who is more human, and often dumb) cum chronicler of their adventures.
These companions seem like a dummy, against their usual-everyday-dull wit the super-intelligence of the detective would shine like a diamond and the necessary phase of every detective story - to whom the detective would confide the whole mystery at the very end.
First time reader of this author and now i am hooked. This was such a great, easy and creative series. i was hooked after the first page. The characters were easy to fall in love with and follow, along with the story. the author made the mental visions so easy and vivid of the surroundings and the characters actions felt so real.i would highly recommend this author and this series.
