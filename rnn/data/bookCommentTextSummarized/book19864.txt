The original concept is a bit incredible, but I am actually ok with “incredible” as long as it is portrayed in a believable way.
For example, there is a point in the book where (view spoiler)[Lena is caught with her love Alex, and consequentially is tied up in her room by her family.
It was just interesting enough to keep you reading to find out what happens next.Believe it or not I actually really liked the ending.
I have put the next book on hold at the library, I am not sure if I will read it or not at this point.
I am not interested in more Delirium books.I love dystopias, I love how authors take current social and political trends and extrapolate them into future showing to us what can happen if these trends persist.
Lauren Oliver's dystopia is based on a premise that love is considered to be a serious, life-threatening sickness, and thus outlawed.
The only aspect of the setting that is interesting is that how author twists Christian mythos to adapt to the love-is-a-dangerous-sickness premise.The focus of the story, and an excuse to write this dystopia, is, of course, a romance.
I have said this before and I’ll say it again. I have no problem with an implausible story vehicle. As long as the ride is good and it relates a moral or philosophical value.But where the line is drawn is when the world isn’t consistent and in the confines of that world, things don’t make sense.That’s my limit. That’s when I start getting frustrated and annoyed. And it’s not because an author tried something new, okay? Lauren Oliver is AMAZING. She is a great author who is erudite and verbose an
Which is sad­den­ing, because Lau­ren Oliver is a good author and I know, with Delir­ium, she was reach­ing out and try­ing some­thing dif­fer­ent.
Alex felt like a def­i­n­i­tion of desir­able love inter­est instead of actu­ally being a per­son Lena fell in love with.3.
She is the result of a child­hood of emo­tional detach­ment – but not really – and this is where it gets per­sonal for me.Because, if you don’t reli­giously read my reviews, then you wouldn’t know that my son was almost diag­nosed with Attach­ment Dis­or­der.
I had limited experience with dystopia, only having read Matched, The Hunger Games, and Uglies, but Delirium made it one of favourite genres.
I’ve come across many young dystopian novels since then, and having re-read Delirium, I can safely say that it is still one of my favourites and one of the best books I’ve read this year.Although Delirium is a dystopian novel, it is first and foremost a love story; it doesn’t pretend to be anything else.
Even though the story mostly focuses on Lena and Alex’s relationship and the things they discover about each other, we’re constantly aware that they live in a restrictive and severely controlled society.Delirium is a wonderfully emotional, heartbreaking love story set in a dystopian future.
Stories that work their way stealthily into your heart, and imbeds itself securely there, and refusing to disperse, leaving you utterly breathless and completely captivated with wondrous awe.
There are not many books that can speak to you the way Delirium does.
Books that can express what love really is: an all consuming, brilliantly captivating, wrenchingly heartbreaking power that takes control over you.
Lena begins to explore this completely new and forbidden emotion.
I don’t know if I’ve read a more heartbreaking, incredible ending.
The story had me captive, refusing to let go until the very last word.
2 / 5Dystopian fiction, particularly the young adult kind, is plummeting downhill at 100 mile-an-hour.
Such a good book. I loved the whole idea of the world even though I found it depressing. It was such a unique concept. There were times when I found myself being annoyed with Lena. I kept thinking to myself "Lena, shut up.", but I grew to really like her character towards the end. Also.. what the heck was that ending? WHY DID YOU DO THAT LAUREN OLIVER. YOU HURT MY HEART. Oh and can I get more Hana Tate please?
And there are these moments that shine through, these beautiful little word gems that Oliver creates, that reminds me of why I loved Before I Fall, and why I was so excited to read this.But.But I was so very, very excited for this that I think I was even more let down by it than Matched, which was also something I was eager for.
This excitement quickly fades as Lena herself succumbs to the disease, becoming hopelessly entangled in a forbidden romance.I have to admire Oliver for the creative spin she placed on American society when establishing this dystopian world.
Her feelings of love, betrayal, and loss transcend all boundaries, lodging themselves in the hearts of readers around the world.Lena's characterization, although less than stellar at times, does have its perks.
Lena, like the rest of society, was convinced that love was dangerous and potentially life threatening.
Her mother gave up her life for the ones she loved, and Lena is more than willing to do the same.
Oliver has conceived this idea, a world without love or any kind of emotions, to give us the chance to feel and to picture ourselves in this dystopian world.
Unfortunately, for many people an ordinary life without a purpose or even the absence of the willing to have a purpose, is more preferable and an easy one to live in.
Yet, we are the ones who have the power to change every injustice.In the final analysis, this story is not only about the absence of love.
And, as usual, it ends on something of a cliff-hanger so, as a reader, I'm left disappointed.However, there are things that I really liked about the story and for which I applaud Lauren Oliver and which make me think she's capable of better than what's here.The chapter headings with quotes from The Book of SHHH, nursery rhymes, playground chants, Comprehensive Compilation of Dangerous Words and Ideas, government pamphlets, schoolbooks and others are simply brilliant and add to the story in subtle ways.
In a book that repeats itself as much as this one does, you'd think it would be easy to keep the facts straight.For instance, Lena lives in a two-story house except that at one time she thinks that her aunt and uncle's whole apartment would fit in the living room of a house she's in.
I really do hope Lena grows a backbone in Pandemonium though, one on her own, without the help of Alex and Hana.
I loved the latter so so much, but there wasn't enough of him in BIF, so I liked pretending Alex was actually Kent in spirit.
I know in my head that (view spoiler)[he can't actually be dead (hide spoiler)] but my heart still cries over the possibility.Off to read Pandemonium now.
(hide spoiler)]Favorite quotes:Sometimes I feel like if you just watch things, just sit still and let the world exist in front of you—sometimes I swear that just for a second time freezes and the world pauses in its tilt.
just read an absurd amount of bullshit. can someone send over their local priest i need to be cleansed.
Προκαλεί δυσκολία συγκέντρωσης.Ανεβάζει τη θερμοκρασία.Προκαλεί εφίδρωση.Αυξάνει την ευφορία ή την απόγνωση, ανάλογα την περίσταση.Κόβει την όρεξη.Προκαλεί απώλεια βάρους, αϋπνία, παράνοια.Στερεί την ικανότητα να βλέπεις καθαρά και να παίρνεις μόνος αποφάσεις.Οδηγεί στη συναισθηματική ή και σωματική παράλυση και τελικά στην αυτοκτονία!Αυτά τα δεδομένα ήταν υπεραρκετά για να με κάνουν να ενθουσιαστώ!!!Παραδείγματα που γνωρίζουμε από τη λογοτεχνία ή τα θρησκευτικά παρουσιάζονται σε αυτό το βιβλίο σαν μαθήματα κατά της Αμόρ Ντελίρια Νερβόζα!Ο Ρωμαίος και η Ιουλιέτα αποτελούν ένα από τα πρώτα διδάγματα στα σχολεία των παιδιών.
Αυτά θα πάθεις αν κολλήσεις την Αμόρ Ντελίρια Νερβόζα.Και πολλά άλλα που εκτόξευσαν τον ενθουσιασμό μου στα ύψη!Και όπως είναι φυσικό, η ηρωίδα θα κολλήσει την ασθένεια!!Γιατί λοιπόν δεν έβαλα καλύτερο βαθμό;Όσο αριστουργηματική κι αν μου φαινόταν η ιδέα, και πιστέψτε με ξετρελαθηκα, η εκτέλεση με χάλασε λίγο.Πρώτο και σημαντικό!
But he may also fly.”A girl and a boy in a world where love is a sickness that can be cured.Set in a dystopian Portland, Maine, the novel tells the story of Lena, 17, just before she receives a life-altering operation, that will forever take her feelings away.I know I'm late.
A seemingly naive (and kind of boring) main character, too many words and thoughts, not enough plot.
I would've been perfectly happy if the book was 100 pages shorter.The characters weren't exceptional either, but luckily Lena had a huge character developement.
Luckily, the plot picked up as well.To sum it up, a very average novel.
I think even without the visuals Equilibrium as a book would have sent me into a turmoil a hundred times stronger than Delirium.It is also not as well explained, as skillfully multi-layered, and as intricately shown from an inside-angle as The Giver by Lois Lowry, although the latter has a lot less pages to make the situation stomach-wrenchingly uncomfortable and eerie to the reader.And last it is not as exciting as the Uglies Series by Scott Westerfeld, which offers a setting that does not differ so much from „Delirium“: Authorities dealt with the human faults that led to a global catastrophe by turning everybody over 15 into pretty, rather dumb and peaceful people, who mind their jobs, meet their kids now and then and are content with partying and working.
She's following the rules and staying on the straight and narrow path to the final destination of having that lovin' feeling sucked out of her brain, thanks to The Cure ("Love Song" may or may not have played in my head every time I read those words.) I fell in love with her voice once she started to see things for what they really were.And then there's Alex.
It was a constant struggle between savoring every single word that Oliver penned and flipping ahead to ANY page where Alex's name was present and devouring the deliciousness.
Let’s all gather round and pretend that Lauren Oliver is a surgeon.
A highly skilled, kick-ass champion of a surgeon.Now, let's assume that Delirium is the patient.
Because I'm a forgiving individual and I want Lauren Oliver to succeed and make embarrassing amounts of money.
I want this for her because I adored Before I Fall and I suspect she has a few more of the likes of those left in her back pocket before she generates any more of this garbage.
Right Dr. Oliver?And with that promise in mind, I am GENEROUSLY awarding 2 stars: one for the writing, and one for the...
A read for The Quarterly Book Club’s 2016 Series Reread Challenge “I love you. Remember. They cannot take it.”Lauren Oliver’s  Delirium  has once again astounded me. It is one of my best-loved dystopia series since I first read it. All the feelings that overwhelmed me before came rushing back, enveloping me in an embrace that reminds me of the beauty of a night sky, captivating with the speckling of stars.Lena Haloway grew up looking forward to the day that she will be cured.

All the feelings that overwhelmed me before came rushing back, enveloping me in an embrace that reminds me of the beauty of a night sky, captivating with the speckling of stars.Lena Haloway grew up looking forward to the day that she will be cured.
Nothing was ever the same for Lena ever since.Okay, maybe that was not the best overview of the book, but let me tell you this: Delirium is going to open up the floodgates of your hearts; you won’t be able to stop it.When I started rereading this, I was surprised by the fact that there was so much I have forgotten about its story.
I need to get away from these depressing books for awhile.Love killed Lena's mom so she wants nothing to do with it.
Love can make you feel great and can also make you depressed.
A book that will keep you thinking!---"I love you.
They cannot take it" "You can't be happy unless you're unhappy sometimes""Love: It will kill you and save you, both" "The most dangerous sicknesses are those that make us believe we are well""It's so strange how life works: You want something and you wait and wait and feel like it's taking forever to come.
FAR OUT. Did it really have to end like that....? 😢Such a clever idea though!! Really good read but oh my...I need a minute.
Magdalena (Lena) Haloway está casi cumpliendo los 18 años y cuenta los días para la operación, pero antes de que pase se "enferma", se enamora de Alex, un lisiado como les llaman a los no curados.---Delirium is the first part of a dystopia set in the XXII century where all the inhabitants when turn 18 years had to be operated so they do not get sick of the Deliria nervosa of love, with which eliminate feelings because they think make the society sick.
Yet another example of why I hate dystopia. Same old, same old.
I really wanted to love this book.
Delirium is about a girl name Lena who lives in a future where love is considered a disease.
At 18 everyone under goes surgery to remove the ability to love.
However, a few months before her surgery and birthday, she meets Alex and falls in love.
Maybe it's because every time I think if a dystopian society, I think of Katniss and The Hunger Games.
If you are looking for something like The Hunger Games, this is is not it.
Delirium focuses more on Lena and Alex's relationship than the actual world.
5/5 StarsI didn’t expect to love this book as much as I do! The concept of love being a disease was just great. Really enjoyed the characters and loved their development throughout the book. Lauren Oliver delivered a beautiful and intense story about forbidden love. BUT THE ENDING, WHY?
I tried I really did, I loved Before I fall, and this book sounded so great, but I couldn't bring myself to get past the first 100 pages. This book is probably good for some people, but I just couldn't bring myself to finish it.
"Σε αγαπώ. Να θυμάσαι. Αυτό δεν μπορούν να το πάρουν."
Now, I’d rather be infected with love for the tiniest sliver of a second than live a hundred years smothered by a lie.” I am afraid I don’t possess the vocabulary to accurately describe this book.
The rest of the world falls away on either side.”A dystopian world that believes love, or as it has come to be called ‘amor deliria nervosa’, is a dangerous deadly disease.
The breath whooshes out of my body and everything freezes for a second, as though I am looking at him through my camera lens, zoomed in all the way, the world pausing for that tiny span of time between the opening and closing of the shutter." Alex is a beautiful soul with an intriguing and heartbreaking story.

Pero como la autora usa un lenguaje muy simple, se lee rápido y no se hace pesado.La premisa del libro es interesante, pero se queda en eso, no destaca sobre otras novelas distópicas y le pesa que, en ese contexto, es bastante light al no presentar un real enfrentamiento con el sistema.
Claro, aquí afrontan una operación que les quitará las emociones, pero, para aquellos que ya tenemos unos cuantos añitos, no es difícil compararlo con el paso del tiempo y cómo, con cada cambio o etapa en nuestras vidas, nos vamos alejando de amistades que en su momento fueron muy importantes.Otro aspecto que me gustó fue la frescura e intensidad con que se describe el primer amor.En resumen, sin ser un libro que destaque, se lee bien, se disfruta, pero no deja esas ganas incontenibles de continuar la saga.
