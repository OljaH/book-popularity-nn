3.5For a tale published in 1918 this was an easy read with fairly fast pacing, despite some of the weird sentence structure that made me double back a few times.It's a short book about King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table.
Sir Galahad is the main focus of the story, but many other characters come into play.
When you get right down to it, I would say this book is about the Knights and their adventures.
It has the feel of a strongly collected group of short stories more than a full novel.
Loved it! Great easy read about King Arthur and Sir Galahad's worthy search for the Holy Grail.
Classic stories.
