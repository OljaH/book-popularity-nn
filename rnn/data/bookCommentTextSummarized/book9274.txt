When I was little, I got a copy of this book from my grandmother.
None maintained what captivated me most about the story - the inner life of the dogs and their complexity.
Anyway, I was suddenly seized by the need to read it again, and couldn't find my old copy.
I got a new copy and when it arrived, devoured the whole thing in one night (it was shorter than it seemed back then).
Still a good story.
Other than this, it's still a classic, and still one every kid should read (with maybe a nice chat about feminism after).
This post is part of the 2015 Classics Challenge.“Like many other much-loved humans, they believed that they owned their dogs, instead of realizing that their dogs owned them."Cruella de Vil is enough to frighten the spots off a Dalmatian pup.
Why is this?Even if a little old-fashioned at times, The Hundred and One Dalmatians is still an incredibly charming classic that I thoroughly enjoyed.
Would it still be a classic without Disney?WHO I’d Recommend It ToPeople who love illustrated fiction, puppies and children's books.“Dogs can never speak the language of humans, and humans can never speak the language of dogs.
This review has been revised and can now be found at Expendable Mudge Muses Aloud.

In this episode, she is the hero, not the male dog.There is one episode with the Spaniel in which Missis tries to learn her right from her left and ends up horribly confused and unable to get the two straight, and that could be seen as an indication that the female possess less intelligence, but abstract concepts are hard to grasp for someone that isn't introduced to them from a young age.
I saw this as a "classic read" and realized that it was yet another book that I never marked as "read." This was, hands down, one of my kids' favorite books. If you've only ever seen the Disney movies then you definitely should give this book a read. It is a bit different from Disney's version - aren't they always - but the repetitiveness and alliteration in the book make it a delight for children. There is a reason it is a "classic."
The part of this book I liked best was the Starlight Barking.
Thank you, Dodie Smith, for explaining it so well.Three or four years ago, while I was living in Sunnyvale, I saw a remarkable example of how useful the Starlight Barking can be.
Luckily, Beth Ann is quite fluent in Dog, and knew that she needed to go outside to see what was up.
The house two doors down was on fire!
While we were watching, our neighbor stumbled out of his front door in a bathrobe, looking very sleepy and confused.
I see!" He was clearly rather less fluent than Beth Ann.
2,3/5 Yikes, I wouldn’t read this to my children.
But I just wish maybe they would give more credit to the original works that inspired them for their stories.
Really, really good books.I mean, Perdita doesn't even show up until maybe chapter 3, and she is NOT Pongo's wife.
His wife's name is Missus.
She's adorable:"I'm not very good at right and left," said Missis, "especially left."The Spaniel smiled, then looked at her paws.
"That paw with the pretty spot -- that is your right paw.""Then which is my left paw?""Why, the other paw, of course.""Back or front?" asked Missis."Just forget your back paws."Missis was puzzled.
This makes a wonderful read-aloud and many children would enjoy it, however --- Cruella de Vil is truly evil and her casual talk of drowning many kittens and pups would be disturbing to many modern families.
( I'll wager it's been purged from many libraries though for the above reasons.) The history of the Dalmation breed is interwoven with the story and Dodie Smith's fine writing makes it read smooth as silk.
The English village dogs who assist Pongo and Missis in their quest to save their family are finely rendered - I loved the spaniel, daughter loved the retrievers and the Staffordshire terrier (who knows just what ought to be done with Cruella).
Classics Cleanup Challenge #2Audio # 151This book was adorable! Disney did an excellent job of adaptation, but I enjoyed this original story much more. For one Cruella sounds like she might be African American, and there are several lgbt hints throughout. Perdita is a third adult dog too. But the rescue is on point, and the happiness at reunion is palpable.
Але ні Няні, ні Любенькі, ні Леді не могли здогадатися, що найбільша біда - це Лютелла, яка мріяла викрасти малюків і зробити з красивих далматинців чергову шубку (звісно, про лихі наміри здогадувався Понґо, але ж він був розумним псом!).⭐️Звернувшись за допомогою до собак Англії через Опівнічний Телегав, Понґо й Леді залишають улюбленців Любеньких і йдуть на пошуки дітлахів.•Історія закінчиться дуже добре, навіть ліпше, ніж у мультику чи фільмі.
Особлива подяка Доді Сміт за Спанієля і його любов до вечірнього чаю з молоком та підсмажених на вогні грінок 💙•Малий поганець був поганцем лише тому, що ніколи не знався з собаками.Не забувайте про це❤️
Such a beautiful children's tale. You can watch my full review here - http://youtu.be/a7r_SJLOrJo
I don't remember seeing the movie as a kid (though I'm told it's the very first movie I ever saw, at a drive-in, at age 4...!) But I vividly remember reading the book when I was in 4th or 5th grade and just loving it.
there is something about the narrative voice that reminds me of Dorothy Sayers (!!) but relishing the diversity of dog personalities rather than regions and classes...
If you read the book, Cruella isn't described as old or ugly...
Again, like something out of Dorothy Sayers.
*** ORIGINAL REVIEW -- August 1, 2007 ***O happy day when during a free-reading period in Mrs. Chismar's fifth-grade class I opened an old, dog-eared (as it were) edition of this masterpiece.
Smith's ability to evoke a scene and pen enchanting but vulnerable characters earns her a place among the greats.
If anyone knows how to get ahold of a copy with the original artwork, CALL ME!*** UPDATED REVIEW -- September 6, 2010 ***listened to a nicely narrated audio version.
i still quite enjoy the story, but getting to know dodie smith's oeuvre better over the years, i can't say i'm surprised by this; she internalized QUITE a bit of gendered ick.
Why I Recommend Bumping This DOWN On Your TBR: There are racist (against Romani people, who are described using the g-word) and misogynist undertones. I felt protective of Missus and Perdita, and therefore hated how Pongo was essentially "the smart one". The plot is boring, with scenes that seem to only have the purpose of dragging out the journey. The Disney movie is basically a well-edited version of this. The only element that I'm not sure how I feel about is that Cruella is married in the novel.
As weird as it sounds, this was the first time I read this book. I read the Disney version when I was a kid but this one was so much better! The dogs felt like real characters and they were so sassy and independent! I loved reading about their adventures around England.
Such a nostalgic, delightful read!Glen Close as Cruella de Vil was a highlight of my childhood.
There was a happy ending, bla, bla bla, back to Cruella.What initially drew me in was the amazing Cruella De Vil (Disney Original Song) and I think because of it, I read this book 8 or 9 years ago.
In the 1996 live-action remake, Cruella is a fashion diva with a murderous streak and I just could not look away.
This book however is a little more mean spirited towards Cruella and there's not a lot of her in it.
There are a lot of people and dogs talking about her and fearing her and her affinity for fur and pepper.
Worse, I first read it when I was ten or so and didn't notice the sexism, which means that its ridiculous list of 'male' and 'female' attributes went into my psyche unchallenged.
According to Dodie Smith, men and male dogs are stronger, don't feel the cold, understand both numbers and words better, have a sense of direction, possess deductive powers, are inventive, loyal and brave.
But it is choc full of blatant, unchecked sexism, and I am boggled that Disney seems to have done a better job than the source.
A great children's book that can be enjoyed by adults, too. The writing is good, and the different dogs in the story are wonderful characters.
Довго думала, яку ж оцінку поставити цій книзі. Гаразд, заплющу очі на сексизм, і поставлю четвірку. Книга — дитя свого часу і це треба враховувати. Натомість в українському виданні дуже приємний переклад і напрочуд вдалі і стильні ілюстрації.
Το βρήκα σε ένα παλαιοπωλείο σε μια απίστευτα ταλαιπωρημένη ελληνική έκδοση του 1969. Μου κίνησε την περιέργεια να δω το γνωστό έργο του Disney σε πιο μυθιστορηματική μορφή, άλλωστε αυτή είναι κ η πρωτότυπη μορφή του. Όταν το διάβασα το ερωτεύτηκα. Υπέροχο. Ο ύμνος του σκυλόφιλου! Τρυφερή περιπέτεια. Μιλάει για την οικογένεια, για τη δύναμη της φιλίας και φυσικά για τη γενναιότητα, γιατί μπροστά στην αδικία δεν πρέπει ποτέ να τα παρατάς Τέλειο για τα παιδιά. Μακάρι να εκδοθεί και πάλι!
Ok, this book is amazing. Brian told me it was good a couple years ago but I dismissed it because well, it's The 101 Dalmatians. We listened to it on a couple road trips and while I got it because I thought Asher might like it, it was really Brian and I who enjoyed it. Very well written and the one we listened to was read so so well- definitely recommend listening to the audiobook version read by Martin Jarvis if you can.
This took us much too long, for a fun little book. Despite never gaining a lot of momentum, we all enjoyed the read. It ended very happily, which filled Iris with overwhelming joy. There are certain phrases that are repeated throughout the book, like Cruella de Vil's 'absolutely simple white mink cloak' that I really liked as a device; it was kind of like a character carrying a theme song whenever they show up in a movie. It was, regrettably, a little dated in a sexist way, but it is old.
Easy reading, lovely story about dalmations and the midnight barking from every dog in the country. The dogs were saved by Pongo and Perdita. A good read for both children and adults who love dogs.
When the puppies are kidnapped by the unspeakably evil Cruella de Vil, the fur-fanatic wife of a furrier who desires - and fully intends to acquire - a Dalmatian-skin coat, Pongo and Missis must travel cross-country from London to Suffolk, making many new friends and encountering many perils along the way.
In the chapter which covered the puppies' birth, Mr. Dearly uses a towel to massage and stimulate the blood flow in a stillborn puppy, reviving her faint heartbeat and bringing her back to life (she survived, and turned out to be one of the best of the puppies).
A good fun adventure story, lots of peril on the dogs journey.
Quite educational too, lots of tips on how to look after dogs, did you know a big male Dalmatian loves to be punched?
There was one other thing that kept bugging me during the book...
I was sure there were only 100 Dalmatians, but things get cleared up and I was proven wrong.Really enjoyable book and one that you gotta read to your kids when they are little.
Kind of humorous during some scenes, but much of this novel was just filler and "cute puppy" moments; if you haven't read this book, believe me, you haven't missed much unless you're an avid fan of repetitive canine stories and animal tales. I liked the author's writing style though, really descriptive, poetic and vibrant.
And let me tell you about Cruella de Vil, okay, SHE CRAAAAAAAAAY!
*That* is what Cruella de Vil is like.
My favorite part of the book was when they go into that, like, church place and Cadpig thinks she found a TV, but it was really a nativity.
I like when Missis thinks that the van is a “miracle,” but it’s not really a miracle.
I like that when the seriousness in telling is juxtaposed against the absurdity of the story, but it hit a weird middle ground here.
I think Disney neatened up this story really well, eliminating superfluous characters and streamlining the action.
This was a delight, and made me remember how obsessed I was with the movie as a child. It was written in the 50s, though, so the male dogs are smarter and stronger than the female dogs, and there's an extended scene about the puppies almost getting stolen by g*psies, so I can't give it 5 stars.
