I have always loved Silver Bullet. This book is super short but full of awesome! And the artwork is amazing. I will add a few images in no particular order! Loved it!! And of course now I want to watch Silver Bullet! Mel 🖤🐾🐺
Cycle of Werewolf by Stephen King  is NOT about a poor Werewolf searching for his stolen bicycle, without which he will not be able to stalk his victims during the full moon.No, seriously it's not. Such a confusing title! The cycle here refers to a year of the gruesome werewolf attacks from January to December 1983, in a small town called Tarker's Mill. All murders took place during the full moon and they were committed by a classic murderous Werewolf (I got to use the word "Classic" because th
The cycle here refers to a year of the gruesome werewolf attacks from January to December 1983, in a small town called Tarker's Mill.
All murders took place during the full moon and they were committed by a classic murderous Werewolf (I got to use the word "Classic" because the modern Werewolves looks like overgrown foxes).This is a rather short novel.
Just as King paints the horror with his words, Wrightson uses his illustrations to capture those moments effectively.The writing, the characters and the moments of horror are well crafted, and even though the short length dampens some aspects of the story, It is a fun read.
فى منتهى السذاجة و التقليدية و الغريب ان المؤلف هو ستيفن كينج و المترجم أحمد خالد توفيق الا انك تكاد تجزم أنها لطفل فى المرحلة الاعدادية .. اه عفوا لمراهق فى تانية اعدادى و ليس لطفل حتى اننى قررت ان اعطيها نجمة واحدة و لكن ضغط اصبعى نجمتين فقلت لا بأس بذلك. نجمة لكينج و نجمة لتوفيق.
Anyways, the werewolf would terrorize the small town for a whole year.
It has all the ingredients I seek in my horror novels: isolated small town, a time when technology was not so developed, a terrifying monster and also some elements of mystery.
But I can safely say - had the author written it as a full length novel it could have been as good as, if not better than, Salem’s Lot. Very few authors can write about terror in small town the way King can (needless statement but made it anyway!) But, this story has been written by the Stephen King.
Anyway, I found it for a buck at a yard sale a couple years ago and decided I could use a reread.Like Kemper  told me while I was reading it, Cycle of the Werewolf is essentially a Stephen King calendar.
Each chapter is a month out of the year the werewolf is stalking the town, accompanied by one or more of Bernie Wrightson's fantastic illustrations.
That being said, I did like the structure, with every chapter being a month of the werewolf's reign of terror.While it is strictly a B-list Stephen King book, Cycle of the Werewolf is by far the best Stephen King novel ever turned into a movie starring Cory Haim and Gary Busey.
In my opinion, he could/should have gone whole hog with this and added much more to it...more about the small town and characters, because King knows how to create a really great werewolf....plus there is the mystery of just who he is by day, and has the perfect hero with a very big disadvantage!
Great Movie, to--in fact, I'm off to watch The Silver Bullet right now!!!***Not TOO young....there are graphic descriptions of the attacks and just a teeny bit of sexuality, Interestingly this version was created for schools and libraries, But you definitely don't want to give young children nightmares!
No hay que olvidar que es un libro de terror para publico infantil y por ello la velocidad de la trama.
Es un libro con un vocabulario básico que ayudará a los que apenas inician con el género del terror.
Las escenas de terror son demasiado veloces y eso propicia que no te aterré la novela.
Las escenas de decapitación y desmembramientos les falto el toque de agonía al cual nos tiene acostumbrado stephen king (tal vez no los puso por que es un libro para niños)2.

I picked this novella up in college, and shortly thereafter the movie SILVER BULLET was made from the story. CYCLE OF THE WEREWOLF is sort of an "under the radar" King book. Probably not the most talked about, but I think it's a hidden treasure. I love the author's monthly chronicling of the monster's evolution in the small town of Tarker's Mills, Maine. Part of what makes this a 5 star book for me were the superb illustrations, which are similar to those found in CREEPSHOW. This is a terrific tale by one of the masters.
4.5Well that was fast.The story itself is enjoyable to read, but it isn't anything special. What made this book special, and why I gave 5 stars in the end, were illustrations. They were really well done and they fit to the tone of the story so well. If you're a fan of Kings work, and haven't yet read this, I suggest giving it a go. Just don't have high expectations going into it, because you might end up disappointed.
Primer libro del reto Casa encantada.Sinceramente, vaya decepción! Es el primer libro que leo de este autor y el último!!!
I finally managed to get my hands on a rare copy of this book for my King collection. Such a cool little story and a must-have if you're a King nerd like myself. Aided with nice illustrations, it's a fast story (read in about an hour), and I'm curious now to watch the film adaptation (Silver Bullet) to see how they turned such a short story into a film.
Every entry is in the form of a month & tells of an attack by a werewolf in the small town of Tarker Mills, Maine where everyone is not only a potential victim but also a potential suspect as the massive killer beast runs rampant at every full moon & feeds on everyone & anything available to his greedy, killer paws but no one can even begin to guess at his identity.
Never mind that by the mid year entry I knew who the killer mutt was, it was a completely enjoyable, thrilling read.
Short and sweet. the colored illustrations are terrifying.
I wasn't sure what to expect from this short, illustrated story but it was great!
King apparently found this production quota too restrictive and fleshed the vignettes into short chapters based on the concept of a werewolf, slave to (an astronomically creative version of) the lunar cycle, terrorizing the fictional town of Tarker's Mills.
Wrightson's illustrations, which include beautifully rendered two-page black and white spreads introducing the new month, are timelessly captivating.The vignettes are ultimately pulled together by Marty Coslaw, a member of the league which would include Mark Petrie in 'Salem's Lot and The Loser's Club in It, children who've read all the monster movie magazines, collected the toys and recognize the threat to their community before the grown-ups.
The first thing Marty saw were the exotic Chinese markings on the package's label.
As far as I can tell, Cycle of the Werewolf was Stephen King’s first venture into an illustrated novel, a marriage of a story and graphics.
I may never have bothered reading this Werewolf tale, but what kind of Constant Reader would that make me?
Too few words for a book, too many for a calendar.
The big But is that the drawings don’t say much outside of the plot, and the writing does not express SK’s true talent, until the story finally breaks the mold around the middle of the year.
Mi edición (la misma que figura en la reseña) está preciosamente ilustrada por el recientemente fallecido Bernie Wrightson, es por eso que aproveché para darle una relectura, para poder homenajearlo en mi canal literario con una reseña del mismo.
El arte de Bernie complementó de forma sublime la historia, con ilustraciones sangrientas, crueles y atroces que documentan el paso del hombre lobo, y capturan con certeza el espanto en cada personaje.
Hay ilustraciones a color en la mitad del libro, y el resto son en blanco y negro, con un atractivo gótico muy característico en Bernie.
Ok, maybe this classic (but for the monster origin..), straight werewolf tale was too short for a novella an too long for an anthology short tale, I already knew the story and the creature identity having seen lots of times the "Silver bullet" movie based on this one ...
but King is still THE KING for me and I loved how he fleshed for good characters and story in just few words here.And Bernie Wrightson's illustrations are just creepy moody masterworks...
An excellent and very different short tale from the King of horror.Brrrrr.
4.5 STARS. Brilliant story and exquisite writing skills by Eminent Author.I was completely immersed in the story and It was like so much alive my goodness.I felt that frightened beam of moonlight as were depicted in story.Lovely.
ستيفن كينج للمرة الثالثة هذا الشهر، لم أحبها اطلاقا مملة رتيية شديدة التقليديةلو قارنتها بالرجل الذئب لأحمد خالد توفيق ستربح الأخيرة حتمًا.
I found this one to be a cut above many of Stephen King's other novels, and the way the werewolf is described? So vivid! :D

Thirdly, the film adaptation, "Silver Bullet" (written for the screen by Stephen King), is a deeper overall experience: better character development, cooler kills, the inclusion of that most-epic motorcycle/wheelchair every 80's kid wanted whether they were handicapped or not, and mo' frakkin' Corey Haim partnering up with crazy-as-balls Gary Busey.
To quote King: "Movie and books are like apples and oranges.
They both taste delicious in their own ways." I will admit, though, my love for this book has a great deal to do with Bernie Wrightson's artwork.
Of course, we wouldn't have Wrightson's fantastic drawings without King's story, and the two go together like sex and heroin.
Stephen King calling this Cycle of the Werewolf and have the creature be Frankenstein’s Monster taking the piss?
Cycle of the Werewolf is presented in 12 chapters, each almost like short stories, one for every month of the year, and in each we are introduced to one of the townspeople.
Then one night in July a disabled boy in a wheelchair encounters the werewolf and survives by throwing fireworks into its face and blowing out one of its eyes.The story gets interesting once the boy sees a man in town walking about with an eyepatch and the game is afoot.
Cycle of the Werewolf reads almost like an old comic book in the way that there were blocks of text combined with wordless illustrations.
I found this illustrated paperback short story in a 2nd hand book store, had heard of it before but never found a copy.This short story told in 12 chapters as in the months of the year tells the tale of a small town being under attack of a werewolfish killer.
It is a brilliant short tale and the illustrations add to the mood of the story.
As always King does not need a lot of story to set a mood and create characters and he does it in this tale once more.
This is a really good book. It was also adapted into a film called Silver Bullet starring Gary Busey. I enjoyed both.🐯👍
3.5 stars. The illustrations were fantastic. The story was pretty good. Each chapter was a different month, taking place on the full moon. I liked some months better than others. But overall definitely an entertaining read.
The book has 12 chapters, one for every month of the year, and follows an entire year of a small Maine town called Tarker's Mills, where they experience the coming of a werewolf every full moon.
Certain characters began to feature more often than not, a hero emerged, and the plot thickened concerning the identity of the werewolf, which was great.
Overall though this is a perfect Halloween read, and great fun - definitely something I'd re-read at this time of year for years to come.
"There is nothing of God or Light in that heartless sound - it is all black winter and dark ice."This story follows the cycle of a werewolf...funnily enough!
There is disbelief in the town that these murders could be the work of a werewolf, particularly since the snarls and howls almost sound human-like...What a fun, quick read!
Looking forward to watching the adaptation Silver Bullet as I've heard great things.
I'd also be intrigued if King decided to develop this story further into a full-length novel, as I'd like him to further expand on the werewolf mythology.
All in all, a great read!
3.5 stars - so fun!
