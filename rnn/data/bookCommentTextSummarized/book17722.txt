I love it.It’s truly the little things.THE END OF THIS BOOK IS JUST A LISTING OF CLICHESAs the war we’ve waited for finally arrives, and so does the time for motivational speeches and tragic goodbyes and other things that fail to make me feel something, SJM loses it entirely.Nearly every line of dialogue in this section is just a cliché, and so I will copy and paste them here, for your perusal and accompanying amusement.“Leave this world…a better place than how you found it.”“One life may change the world.”“I believe everything happens for a reason.”“It is the family you make, not the one you are born into, that matters.”“Light can be found even in the darkest of hells.”“The great joy and honor of my life has been to know you.”“I wasn’t sure if in the entire history of Illyria, there had ever been such a discussion.”So bad.
it sure as fuck was not● in fact reading that was literally like being run over very slowly by a steam roller so you can feel every inch of you being pulped personally into the ground● thanks for turning me off herero sex forever I guess ● I'm not even being dramatic this time, it was legit so bad that with every passing page, I've become more and more convinced that I have died and was atoning for my sins in hell● I mean I'm sure sex is nice but you know what's even nicer??
Events from the first half that seemed so important at the time now feel like minuscule details in the face of this EPIC PLOT.I love how Maas writes such complex characters who have had their lives shattered in a variety of ways, yet still keep fighting for each other and work to create a new life with the family they chose.
3.75 stars "Rhys stepped off the stairs and took my hand. Night Triumphant—and the Stars Eternal. If he was the sweet, terrifying darkness, I was the glittering light that only his shadows could make clear." It's the worst feeling in the world when finales don't match up to their predecessors.  I liked A Court of Thorns and Roses, I loved A Court of Mist and Fury, I am frankly disappointed by A Court of Wings and Ruin.First, the writing. It's in desperate need of another round of editing. It's u
Quite a few reviewers (and me included) have mentioned this already, but Maas undeniably has an obsession with inhumanly powerful characters.On the subject of Rhys, it would have been so, so cool for Feyre to be the sole ruler of the Night Court.
(hide spoiler)]Another thing that bothered me is how unbelievably powerful Feyre is.
Hating the High Lord of Spring just because Feyre does is a disservice to the complexity of his character.I also like that Maas seems to be pulling away from the whole "mates" concept.
Ugh.And another thing-- Feyre and Rhysand are already mated and loved up to their eyeballs so there was no sexual tension, no will they/won't they, which made the sex scenes so boring.
I can only hope they are some kind of spin-off series because, otherwise, either a) we will have to suffer through who the fuck knows how many more awkward, unsexy Feyre/Rhysand sex scenes, or b) Maas will destroy Rhys's character and hook Feyre up with yet another hot fae dude.
I'm not sure which is more likely.The later chapters of this book picked up in pacing, but I think it was too little, too late.
I was afraid I wouldn’t like the third book as much as I loved the second one but hell, I was so wrong.
When Feyre was in the Spring Court, she was so over-powered like she is a goodness and no one can stop her - I was getting some unwanted Aelin’s vibe here – but the plot was pretty well-driven after that, allowing each character to have its share of glory in Hybern Battle.
And thank god for incredible plot twists or else I would have died a thousand times.
Yay! Another one of my books won 2017 GR award ❤OMG!THIS BOOK!I LOVED IT SO MUCH! AND IT MADE ME CRY! THE FEELS!I'm NOT even going to hint at any spoilers or go into too much in the book because there are a million people reading it right now. I must say I loved A Court Of Mist And Fury as my favorite and now this one is my new favorite. I love Rhys, Feyre, Cassian, Azriel, Lucien, Nesta, Elain, Mor, Amren and some random others.

THE FEELS!I'm NOT even going to hint at any spoilers or go into too much in the book because there are a million people reading it right now.
I love Rhys, Feyre, Cassian, Azriel, Lucien, Nesta, Elain, Mor, Amren and some random others.
The war and things were brutal and bloody and I thought we were going to lose some so many times.
I think this book covered them all.
I love this book so very much!
I'm so happy with what has happened so far but I'm terrified that there is going to be three more books.
Congratulations-winner of Best Young Adult Fantasy 2017!Initially I was so wrapped up in needing closure to this part of the story that I was grabby grabby for anything I could get my hands on, but I can’t stop thinking about how many issues I had with this book.
Was it enjoyable?
I wholly respect what SJM was trying to do here, and it was enjoyable, but not mind blowing.
I’m still over here anxiously awaiting more ACOTAR stories though, so it must not have been all that bad.
In these early days after the release, I'll say little and spoil nothing. This is wholly because I'm considerate and benevolent and not at all because I'm sobbing and incoherent at the end of a favorite trilogy.Suffice it to say, however, that after all the sentiment holds true:Welcome to A Court of Pain And Feels.Review to home when I deem hints acceptable and gather my wits and reason about me. In the meantime, you can (try to) find me in Velaris.
Glorious, thrilling and completely enthralling -- ACOWAR was everything I hoped for and then some. This is how you end a series -- with love and hope and happiness painting the grand finale. Maas deserves thunderous applause yet again. Review to come.
The first third had accurately enlightened me as to what I was to expect, and my (abysmally low) expectations were met point by point.We girls of the SmutClub weren't able to do a proper buddy read as we did last year with ACoMaF due to real life kicking our asses, however, I'm sure you don't want to miss Sarah's and Reyes's reviews, and Emer's call for honesty and good sense when it comes to the target market of this series (and of the Throne of Glass series too, at this point) perfectly highlights a problem I haven't been able to wrap my mind around since it first arose.•First of all, I'd like to take a moment to answer a question that no one asked but that I think it fair to take into account nonetheless, said question being, "If you evidently don't like Maas's books, why do you keep reading them?" Very good point indeed.I used to consider her books a guilty pleasure until, well, yesterday.
"And will you come with me? On this adventure - and all the rest?""Always." I have died  I finished. 13 hours. I'm in hell. You think you know pain? YOU DONT. This. This is pain. I have honestly not stopped sobbing for hours. I am broken. I woke up this morning (the day after finishing) and reread the last few chapters and I cried all over again. I am broken and healing but every piece of my heart belongs to these books. (if you don't get that reference please get out of my life)Let's discuss s
BUDDY READ WITH BASICALLY EVERYONE ON GOODREADS (mainly Amber though) WOOOOHOOOOOO TODAY IS ACOWAR DAYYYYYYY I WOKE UP AT 3:50AM FOR THIS SHITI'm 20000% not sorry for all of the updates I've made BUT THIS BOOK COMES OUT IN LESS THAN 24 HOURS (Australian time) AND IM SCREAMING OMFG I finished reading the excerpt.
Basically, Sarah confirmed that we will be switching characters in the next three books and I think a little part of me broke inside.
ACOMAF is my favourite book of all time and the fact that we have to leave my favourite characters behind in a little under a week honestly hurts.
When the book you're highly anticipating has no cover, no title, and no synopsis: And a May 2017 release date:

Reread x 2. My heart is in pain and full of love for this series. I don't know what else to say, other than I had the BEST time reading this with my partner in crime, Lena!We're obsessed with this series and it doesn't get better than fangirling with someone about a book/author you both equally love as much. ❤And now I'm in this mess where my heart feels hollow, drained and I cannot stop replaying the scenes of this book in my mind. I'm so happy, so goddamn happy that we're getting more of this
I don't know what else to say, other than I had the BEST time reading this with my partner in crime, Lena!We're obsessed with this series and it doesn't get better than fangirling with someone about a book/author you both equally love as much.
Post-Mourning review: And it's the day after I finished this beautiful, exhilarating book.
One week till we have this BABE of a book in our hands.
The characters, the incredible world Sarah J Maas has created.
Will read anything and everything The Maas writes!
You know you're a dedicated fan when you mark an untitled book set to release in 2017 as a "want to read". Who cares if it doesn't come out another 2-3 years anyways?EDIT 1/28/17: ahh that cover is so beautiful! Not much longer now!
Rhys is actually the best fictional character ever and I love him2.
Feyre is actually the best fictional character ever and I love her3.
Amren is actually the best fictional character ever and I love her6.
BUT IANTHE DOES GET HER HAND SMASHED INTO LITTLE PIECES BY FEYRE WHICH IS SO FREAKING BRUTAL I screamed the entire time like wow I don’t like the bitch either but did she really deserve to have her hand continuously smashed?
So Feyre and Rhys are in this gigantic ass library surrounded by books which is like life goals right?
4 StarsBefore I say anything, I must say this:What the fuck is this "vulgar gesture" that has been mentioned over and over and a-FUCKING-over again throughout all this series, which all the characters seem to gift each other with?No for real, I would love to know.
Anynotawave, if you follow my reviews, you know that I didn't particularly love book one and two of this series like most people did.
Maybe it just took books one and two to really dig my heels into the series - who knows - but I was really digging the characters in this one.
1.) A Court of Thorns and Roses ★★★★2.) A Court of Mist and Fury ★★★★★  “A nightmare, I’d told Tamlin. I was the nightmare.”  I had really high hopes for this, like really high, and I did enjoy it, but I can't help being reminded that this was nothing close to the perfection that ACOMAF was. My reading experience was honestly reminiscent to Harry Potter, because I was fangirling every other page, while squealing and giggling and rolling around on my bed like I was twelve again! And when I saw th
I also feel like she added so many side characters and side plots to further advance the spin-offs that are going to start coming in 2018.
Like, I loved when Lucien went off to on his side quest to find the lost queen and her court, but then Feyre's dad came and saved the day in the end, with an entire army at his disposal.
Maas fangirl, but I'm speaking the truth; she knows how to write romance, and I think that's why I was disappointed with this book, after being so in love and obsessed with ACOMAF last year.
I'd sell a body part ─ or two ─ or three... or ALL OF THEM if I could HAVE THIS BOOK IN MY HANDS RIGHT NOW.I was hesitant as heck picking up A Court of Mist and Fury but I'm diving headfirst in full speed for this book. FUCK. ME. UP. JUST PLEASE DON'T HARM ANY OF MY BABIES.
I think this is her best book so far.
Great characters, great story, secrets, betrayal, redemptions, ACTION!!!!
Every time I learned something about one of the characters I want to know more.
That is the depth of the character in this story.
Espicallly Rhysand, and anyone in the Court of Dreams.Since the last book Feyre has returned to the Spring Court to destroy it from with in.
Once again is falls to the Court of Dreams to lead the charge not only against their enemies but the very thinking of many Prythians as well.This is just an awesome book.
A lot.Since so many (sooo many) people have read this book and written reviews about it, I'll keep mine short.
The only dead character is Feyre's father and I - or everyone - stopped caring for him like two books ago.
(hide spoiler)]The only reason I enjoyed this more than the other two books is because I completely skipped the sex scenes.
The blurbs alone that I read in other people's reviews made me laugh from ridiculousness.One more thing: where did all the lgbt characters suddenly come from?
While I'm glad to finally see this happening (It only took her 8 books but whatever) I still worry about it.
“Be happy, Feyre,” he said quietly. Actually it's not a 5-star rating, more like 4.5678-star for me. But this book, this blessed book brought me to tears and my heart nearly exploded through it. RHYS. I breathe him in and don't want to let him out. I longed for ACOWAR since it didn't even have the title and promised myself that I couldn't die before I got my hands on it. I can't gather the words to express how I am feeling right now. Everything is just right. EPIC. PERFECT. EXQUISITE. RHYS I lo
A huge difference between these guys is how they treat her, while Tamlin treated Feyre like she's made of glass, Rhys forged her into a weapon she was born to be.
Cassian, Mor, Azriel, Nesta, Elian, and Amren are the best supporting characters ever.
One of my favorites is https://youtu.be/tgvbhxb9yk8 It healed my soul whenever something happened and I couldn't prevent myself from crying over for the pain I felt.Though ACOWAR is not the best of the series (I think the best is ACOMAF as it's so emotional and deep), I still liked the most of it, especially the war and strategies these characters manage to plan out.
May 3rd, 2017Video Review: Coming soon!!GOOD FUCKING BYE WORLD I AM SO LOST BECAUSE OF THIS BOOK!Yes, that is dramatic but I don't even care because this book gave me everything I wanted and more.
THE ROMANCE HELL YES.THE PLOT HAD ME HOOKED.
I'm just overall very happy with my reading experience even though I yet again got no sleep from reading this beast of a book (I know some people judge me for doing that and not fully "enjoying" the book by taking my time but hell no, once I start I don't stop).I don't know what else to say that won't be spoilers so I'm just gonna die happy knowing that I got to FINALLY read this beauty.Expected publication: May 2th 2017*internally screaming*
Then, when Rhys and Feyre are supposed to be doing actual research in the library, they’re so fucking horny they apparently think it’s completely fine to almost have sex in a library that—once again —is RUN by women who have been sexually abused.
I love how Feyre got all indignant in the last book about High Fae treating other faeries like shit and yet she still calls them "lesser faeries”…..also, while she was in the Spring Court I get she was mad but she just never seemed to give a shit about the harm her actions could cause ordinary people????
After that ending only one quote can adequately sum up my feelings:  Something thumped in front of me. A bottle of wine. “It’s fine if you drink directly from it,” was all Mor said.  This book ensared me -  body and soul  - and the last hundred pages? Whew. Talk about  stress  - like actual  heart-pounding stress.  For those who don't know me, I stress-bake.  I was 18 cupcakes and double-batch of cookies deep by the time I reached that end. Man-oh-man. My apartment is now a bakery.  “She is High
I was 18 cupcakes and double-batch of cookies deep by the time I reached that end.
Feyre, now ruling the Night Court with Rhysand, is about to go to war.
King Hybern's army is set to march into the human world - ready to slaughter and enslave.
The more Feyre and the Night Court resists, the more likely it seems like they'll lose.
I would have waited five hundred more years for you.
And if this was all the time we were allowed to have … The wait was worth it.

I was supposed to read it slowly because A Court of Frost and Starlight will arrive here after a week and I have had serious issues waiting for those books in the past, but I couldn't stop.
But let's start from the very beginning.Looming war threatens all Feyre holds dear in the third volume of the #1 New York Times bestselling A Court of Thorns and Roses series.Feyre has returned to the Spring Court, determined to gather information on Tamlin's manoeuvrings and the invading king threatening to bring Prythian to its knees.
I'm going to talk a bit about the first 400 pages, before my favorite part of the book starts.
