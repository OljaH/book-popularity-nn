رواية من روايات أجاثا المحيرة، والمربكة جداً تدور بك في دوائر مغلقة كلما تمسك بخيط يقود إلى إكتشاف الجريمة يرجع بك الامر إلى نقطة الصفر ..شخصيات كثيرة في الرواية وثلاث جرائم معقدة وغامضة ..رواية عبقرية مترابطة ومتماسكة جداً ولا أظن أن القارئ سيصل إلى القاتل سوى في الصفحة قبل الأخيرة .. إلا إذا كان من طراز هركيول بوارو..
“Hastings, my dear friend, we haven’t gone over the clues in a page and a half, let us do so once again.”Again, I don’t expect Poirot to chase a suspect, leaping across London rooftops in a single bound or beat a knife wielding thug into a bloody pulp or hang out at the hotel pool, drinking Boilermakers and ogling the honeys, but in this volume, our Belgian detective is more inert than usual.Plus, this very regular mystery, doesn’t offer a lot of mental gymnastics for the reader looking for a brain workout.
(Rhetorical English question 😬)And yes it was good, a great story, fabulous characters and a real twist at the end as Poirot solves the crime(s).
This is despite this solution NOT answering Poirot's 5 questions.
You know I kept trying to answer these questions and like Porot till his epiphany I couldn't get them.
As per usual I was beaten by the master detective, but who cares it was one of the best with its twists and red herrings  (hide spoiler)] so I give it a solid 5 ⭐️

داستان سیزده نفر سر میز شام: جین وینکلسون هنرپیشه ای ست حرفه ای ولی خودخواه، وی میگوید که از شوهر خود متنفر است و هر طور شده میخواهد از او طلاق بگیرد.
So, as the title says, Lord Edgeware dies. His wife tells everyone she’s going to kill him and how. But when he does get killed she has an air tight alibi, even though she was seen at the scene of the crime. It’s up to Poirot to find the true murderer. I don’t think I’ve read a Poirot book before where he says, “I was wrong!” so many times. This one stumped him for quite awhile.
Sacré! It took me only 2 days to literally devour this book. I most certainly didn't saw that coming, I never could guessed who was the murderer, Agatha did good job!
American actress, Jane Wilkinson, Lady Edgware, approaches Poirot, asking him to help her obtain a divorce from her cold, estranged husband.
However, when Poirot, and Hastings, go to see Lord Edgware, he seems to have no issue with divorcing her.
This is not my favourite Poirot novel, although it is always delightful to have Hastings and Japp both involved in a mystery.
The next in the series is Murder on the Orient Express, and I intend to listen to David Suchet narrating one of my very favourite Poirot mysteries.
Poirot remains my favourite, fictional detective and it is a delight to revisit the books.
I actually changed my mind about this book right at the end, during Poirot’s gathering people together to reveal the murderer.
Poirot chastising Hastings for being so simple-minded throughout the book had me wholeheartedly agreeing.
That showed a side of Poirot I had not seen before, a rather frightening side I can well imagine he used to advantage when he worked in Belgium years before.
And the reveal of the murderer and an explanation of the murderer’s devious plan, which I’d seen parts of and had even briefly suspected this person, was really smart.
Should stop reading these one-upon-a-time favorites...Only 3 stars this time around, for old times sake
This is also cleverly executed plot by Agatha Christie.
However, the murderer finally succumbs to Poirot's brilliant analytical and deductive powers, but not without mistakes from the part of the great detective.
I did like this new approach of bringing out mistaken "little ideas" of Poirot in to light.
Even though by the mid of the story, the reader can guess the murderer, Christie with her usual twists and turns keeps of keeping the reader in doubt as to whether the guess is correct.
However, despite all the plus points of the story, the pace was rather slow and I found our brilliant detective a little too inert.
“Do you not realize, Hastings, that each and everyone of us is a complete mystery with layers. We each try to judge each other, but nine times out of ten, we are wrong.” Quite devious, this one. Poirot is his usual self while Hastings bumbles around as clueless as ever :O) This time however the culprit nearly pulls the wool over our favourite Belgian detective... Not the best but entertaining, and rather machiavellian.
This is probably my second favorite Agatha Christie novel, right behind "The Murder of Roger Ackroyd." It also has a special place in my heart because it was the first Agatha Christie novel that I actually read.
This book made me want to actually read more Christie novels instead of merely watching the film and/or television adaptations.
Generally speaking, I love "Lord Edgeware Dies" because I immensely enjoy all of the elements of the book.
Thus, because of the aforementioned elements, "Lord Edgeware Dies" ranks high on my list of favorite Christies.
الصراحة الواحد مبقاش مستغرب من تغفيلة أجاثا كل مرة بتبعتنا في حته والقاتل في رواية تانية اساسالكن المرة ده اه طبعا نفس التغفيلة لكن حبكة النهاية فيها غلطة انا مش هحرق الرواية لاصدقائي لكن فيه دليل مهم جدا بيكشف القاتل فيه غلطة واضحة عرفت تعبك وبهدلتك يا عبد الرحمن لما تعصر دماغك علي القاتل وتطلع اجاثا اصيع بردو :)
Maybe it gives us comfort that seemingly intractable problems like global warming can, with a little pluck and luck and Reason and Order, get figured out in time for tea!
If we are in the hands of guys like Poirot, we will be JUST FINE.Anyway, so in this one the problem is seemingly straightforward: Lord Edgware Dies.
I mean, we are clueless, too, but he makes us feel a little less dumb than we might otherwise feel.Poirot at one point says all people were given brains by God to figure things like criminal detection out, but he wonders if God may have passed Hastings by when He was passing out the brains.
Okay, so when you read a book within the Hercule Poirot Series you know you're going to get one thing and one thing only: a mysterious murder.
However, the title of this book gives away who the victim is - Lord Edgware.
But when he died she had an alibi which obviously made me suspicious as fuck.I feel like Agatha Christie loves to torture me because I was constantly guessing wrong.
Like the entire fucking time.
In almost every book.
It definitely got me back into the grove of her books and I'm so freaking pumped to read the next book!!
This is one of those mystery novels where I delighted in just watching events unfold and seeing the awareness come to others.The plot follows Poirot as he meets an actress desperate to be rid of her husband Lord Edgware.
He is that annoying person who feels he’s the smartest man in the room and has to show it off to everyone… in Poirot’s case though, he’s right.As I said, I solved the case in this one before Poirot did, but that in no way hurt the novel.
Lord Edgware Dies receives four out of five stars and a strong recommendation for all mystery fans.
Review to come.

Poirot is at his best, and so is Hastings--we have to remember that Hastings, without meaning to be, is not a reliable narrator.
To solve the case, we must be above-average like Poirot and take NOTHING for granted.This is also a wonderfully 1930s novel, with a heroine/prime suspect who is a film star in the mode of Gloria Swanson, Grace Kelly, and other classic Hollywood beauties.
I love seeing how pop culture informs Dame Agatha's plots.Although this is classic Christie, it is also unusual in one regard: she tackles the surprising subject of a character who is into S&M!

Me ha gustado muchisimo. Me encanta la manera de escribir de Agatha y como lleva a cabo toda la trama. Es genial :) Me tengo que ir haciendo con la colección poco a poco!
Great mystery, and the usual Christie convoluted plot which has you guessing right until the end.
Another great piece of crime writing and deduction from the "queen of crime writing". As with most of her novels, even though you are aware that you are intentionally being led on the wrong path, yet when the case is solved in the end you are left gaping at the sheer brilliance of the plot. A very engaging read
I read this in Portuguese in just one sitting, as usual for me when the book is a suspense. I found this book spectacular. I suspected who was the killer from the beginning, but it was too obvious. So I discarded this person from the list of the killers.
It also features Inspector Japp of Scotland Yard and it is noticeable how little developed that character is compared to later books.The plot is as given by the title; Lord Edgeware Dies, who killed him?
There are convoluted plots of the very best Christie vintage, several motives and some completely without motives...
Or are they?The cast is more extensive and varied than in the very later books by the author, here more effort goes into describing the people, their mannerisms and behaviors than in some of the very late novels and consequently I found it more interesting reading.
Η Αγκαθα Κρίστι ποτέ δεν με απογοητεύει... το υποψιάστηκα μέχρι την μέση όμως μετά μου έριξε στάχτη στα μάτια. Έπρεπε να είχα πιστέψει την πρώτη μου υποψία. Εν πάση περιπτώσει, το δίαβασα μέσα σε ένα πρωινό δεν άλλαξα καν θέση.
The mystery begins when the husband IS murdered, but Poirot is further confused when he finds out that the husband had completely agreed to give the suspect a divorce and that she had no reason to enlist their help in the first place.As a mystery it works because there are surprises that don't add up for the story and how it unravels, there are multiple red herrings to cast suspicious light on, and the characters personalities are not the traditional sorts so it's like a hollywood type drama.
There I stood, bored to hell, not knowing anyone other than the hostess, and drinking too much champagne.Oh, there's someone I know, the artist Neil Smithson (not real name).
"Our hostess said one of you is Neil Smithson, and I'm a huge fan." A dash of comedy : "I'm Neil - it's great to meet you," I rushed on.
We talked about my "art." Neil, the real Neil, wasn't amused.
" I'm  Neil Smithson," he wedged into the nonsense.
"You know, he likes to go around saying,  he's Neil Smithson, " I explained very seriously.More champ all-around.
I had a correct suspicion of the true murderer, and I thought the identity wasn't veiled as cleverly as in some other Christie's novels, but I could not figure out how the crime was committed and how the evidence fit together.
The book ended in one of those confession notes that Christie utilized on several occasions throughout her literary career, which I don't particularly love, but Poirot's red herrings in the final reveal were brilliant and hilarious.
Reading a Hercule Poirot novel is like slipping into a pair of favourite cozy slippers and spending an evening with a close friend.
