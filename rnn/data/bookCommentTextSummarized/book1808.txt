Excellent collection of first-hand religious experience, straight out of Musil and James.
decent read.
interesting scope and limiting by design.
was hoping for more of an "anthology of mysticism"-type vibe but that is not really that type of book either.
still worthwhile.
it is a short read but i read slowly & it seemed to drag on for such a short book.
there seems to be some overlap to w/ the Catholic confessions.
some of them seem repetitive & typical.
its interdisciplinary but some chapters have really short entries by one or two religious figures.
glad i read i stumbled upon it at the library looking for a Rumi book & i hope to read "I & Thou."
