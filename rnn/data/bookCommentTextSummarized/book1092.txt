Aside from some of the more standard anachronistic interpretations that you find in this period of Aristotle scholarship, Ross' work is terrifically comprehensive. Specifically his treatment of the "organon" as well as Aristotle's metaphysics were both very clear and helpful guides. His treatment of the poetics and rhetoric was typically banal, and the anachronistic reading of parts of the psychology was frustrating. That said, the only other synoptic work on Aristotle that I think even approaches Ross' depth is J. Lear's book "Aristotle: The Desire to Understand"...which I still prefer.
This book is a classic introduction to the philosophical thought of Aristotle, and with good reason. It should be read by anyone who wishes to study philosophy, and by everyone who wants to get a better understanding of Aristotle's works.
Got me through the primary Aristotle. A very good survey from Mr. Aristotle (Ross, that is). Why is it not still out there?
