Stephen King once said, "Stephenie Meyer can't write worth a darn. She's not very good." I couldn't agree more, Stephen. With that, we shall kick this off with a joke: Heh. This re-reading is brought to you courtesy of Project: Hindsight.  I'm sorry folks. I just could not get through this shit book another time. However, since I've already read it a few times, I feel extremely confident in skipping to the review. But first, can someone please explain to me why this book is 563 pages?! Seriously
But let's get on with it, I'll go into some detail for ya.The book starts off on Bella's 18th birthday, a day she has been dreading for months only because in her mind she will be one year older than Edward.
Wait, don't think about that because if you spend all your time contemplating the stupidity, we'll never get through this review.Obviously, Eddie is not happy with the events that went down at his place and Bella further irritates him by apologizing for...wait for it...being human.
Alpha Male Edward tells Submissive Mary Sue Bella firmly, "No, I don't want you to come.
This should suffice.
I will say, that I find it sad and unfortunate that Meyers insists on her characters not only admiring Romeo and Juliet (not the play, but the hormone-addled teenagers who committed suicide rather than take a minute to think it through), but specifically referencing the star-crossed lovers in near direct comparison to her protagonist and the lover-vamp.
And Meyer's characters, the human girl and the vampire (um, Buffy and Angel anyone?) are certainly in an impossible situation.
You've laid the groundwork, not for a Jane Austen like happy-ending despite the odds, but a Shakespearian tragedy that will not only leave the audience sobbing, but foaming mad.
I decided to read the sequel, just to see if it will get better.Boy, was I wrong.First off, we began with Bella Swan bitching about how old she's getting, because Edward stays 17 forever, and since her birthday is coming up, she'll be one year older than her perfect lover.
Edward realizes he needs to protect Bella, and in order to do that, he must go away with his family.
At this point in the story, I'm starting to hate Jacob a little less and begun to eventually like him, because he's more of an original character than Edward.
And she went to see it three more times, with people other than me.So she bought the book and read it in about four hours.
I was surprised but she explained - "Bella is stupid, Edward is stupid, nothing looks right, they miss out all the important stuff, it's so bad, it's so so so bad"Then she read all the other Twilight books in like four hours."NEW MOON IS THE WORST BOOK EVER FOR 200 PAGES AND THEN IT'S THE BEST BOOK EVER" she said.
She rambles on and on for hundreds of pages talking so much about the "hole in her chest" and how it burned and itched and stung and pussed and--well, showed all the good symptoms of a bad STD--that the plot seemed to vanish beneath her pained musings and constant reminders of Edward.The story continues along at the pace of a bike going uphill with square tires till--BAM--werewolves.
An interesting aside to this "section" of the book: They actually introduce a character that is NOT beautiful, godlike, stunning or otherwise perfect.
despite my reading it on the fine e-ink technology of the new nook.she did one thing right - one wonderful thing.
and having recently rewatched my favorite movie, head-on, i have to point out the best scene in it, and how it mirrors this book.
and bella keeps it up the whole book - testing the boundaries of her own mortality to get that rush of maybe-edward each time she is close to death.
but my, how slender four hundred pages can be on the new nook!so - yeah - i am reading on a freaking robot.
As Richard Dawkins keeps telling us, a religion is a kind of virus, which infected parties want to spread as quickly as possible; well, vampirism is rather like that too.
And Bella is very conflicted in her feelings about vampires.
It doesn't seem far-fetched to claim that Bella's feelings about vampires mirror the author's feelings about her religion, which among other things is very down on premarital sex.
I can readily believe that it's just like that to be a eighteen year old Mormon girl with a healthy sexual appetite, and I feel I understand their plight better after having read this book.
Is anyone else completely aghast that this dreck saw a printing press not to mention became a wildly popular series?I thought I was being hard on Twilight when I criticized it for portraying a relationship so ill-advised and unhealthy and then romanticizing that relationship to young people as if people didn't already make enough bad decisions.
I thought maybe now that Book 1 was done the series would take a nice turn.Enter: New Moon.
Really cringing at my younger self..And yet....I still loved itSo, I guess I'm cringing at my older self too. Before you, Bella, my life was like a moonless night. Very dark, but there were stars, points of light and reason. ...And then you shot across my sky like a meteor. Suddenly everything was on fire  When Bella gets a paper cut during her birthday, she (in typical ridiculously unstable fashion) slices her arm open and stuffs it with glass. She becomes surrounded by seven thirsty vampires a
Before you, Bella, my life was like a moonless night.
(How is this a surprise?) (They're bloody vampires.) Edward does the sensible thing and completely erases himself from her life.
Bella does the sensible thing and completely erases her mind.
She throws herself into this weird fugue state for the second book.
I remember absolutely crying when Bella goes into the fugue state after Edward leaves and bawling again when he came back.
I kept thinking, "This is TRUE love." Woah, Nelly.
Picture a girl with the scratchy-cold voice.
In typical Bella style, she gives herself a paper cut and Edward has to literally throw himself in front of her to keep her from being dinner for six hungry vampires.
Bella is, of course, inconsolable, and walks through life like a lovesick zombie - until she renews her friendship with local boy Jacob Black.
I was actually starting to enjoy Bella's somewhat odd relationship with Jacob, and the book in general, which kind of surprised me - until Edward showed up again.
I like Bella with Jacob.
I can't stand Bella with Edward.
But why is Jacob drawn to Bella?
“What happens when you lose your heart's desire?”I love the Twilight Saga.
I love every single book and it's kind of hard for me to pick a favourite.
Most people complain about how nothing really happens, how Bella is mainly depressed and moping and boring.
To be honest, this is my favourite part in this book.
Bella's numbness and depression, Fork's atmosphere, Jacob's warmth, all of that soothes your - or well at least my - soul and lets you sulk a little and enjoy the silence.I could do without the action, though.
I'm happy just reading about Bella's thoughts and inner conflicts, about her life in Forks, her friends and the Cullens.
Moping for 4 straight months over a goddamned boy is okay, and even though you'll make people worried and your friends may stop talking to you, hey!
it's okay, because your love for this boy is so strong and you'll eventually figure yourself out on your own.2.
Becoming another boy's friend solely to use him to make yourself feel better and to try and fill that "void" the other boy left, without any regard for his feelings and how your actions might affect him is definitely okay because hey!
Alright I finished this one & I just have to say yea there were tons of problems but I enjoyed this light, lovey dovey vampire crap. I can’t give it above a 3 Stars just because I know it’s trash but you can bet your ass I had a lot of fun so that’s gotta be worth something! I’ll probably end up writing something about the series as a whole when I make it to the end of Breaking Dawn so stay tuned if you’re interested!
Reviewed for THC ReviewsTwilight was a grand romance which frequently left me smiling, but New Moon takes on a bittersweet, angst-filled and edgy tone in this continuing dramatic saga of teen love between a vampire and a human.
Still, danger lurks everywhere, bringing a certain level of suspense to the story, which then escalates into a taut thriller when an unfortunate misunderstanding places Alice and Bella in a race against time to save Edward from certain death.
With so much going on, New Moon was yet another installment in the Twilight series that was extremely difficult to put down.I can't help but continue to enjoy the characters in this series.
When I read Twilight, I couldn’t get over the awe and joy I felt as I discovered the world of Bella Swan and Edward Cullen.
When it came to Bella’s recovery (at least partial), I thought it was so well-written as Ms. Meyer showed Bella picking herself up from the abyss that Edward and the Cullens’ departure had thrown her into.
I know that if there was no Edward Cullen, then maybe Jake could have been Bella’s true love.
The way I read her is what I’ve seen in people in real life like Bella.
The novel continues the story of Bella Swan and vampire Edward Cullen's relationship.
When Edward leaves Bella after his brother attacks her, she is left heartbroken and depressed for months until Jacob Black becomes her best friend and helps her fight her pain.
However, her life twists once more when Jacob's nature reveals itself and Edward's sister decides to visit.
Meyer wrote the book before Twilight was published.
رویداد موجب برانگیخته شدن «جاسپر»، برادر «ادوارد» می‌شود.
«ادوارد» آشفته حال، «بلا» را ترک می‌گوید.
«بلا» افسرده می‌شود.
از سوی دیگر، «آلیس» خواهر «ادوارد» کار «بلا» را می‌بیند، و آن را خودکشی می‌پندارد.
“Forbidden to remember, terrified to forget; it was a hard line to walk.”  This was sad. Edward and Bella are separated without good reasons. He wants to protect her, but now what ? I couldn't stomach the first few chapters of this book, after that it was all bearable for me with Jabob and his attitude. I like his protective instinct of Bella, especially when he cares for her, my heart was melted like ice cream. “Before you, Bella, my life was like a moonless night. Very dark, but there were st

I like his protective instinct of Bella, especially when he cares for her, my heart was melted like ice cream.
“Before you, Bella, my life was like a moonless night.
Very dark, but there were stars, points of light and reason.
I remember I was excited about the movie and I went back to reread this series over again when I was in highschool.
I also could feel why Bella has to act like that during the moment without Edward.All in all, I still like Twilight, no matter what people say.
Most of which I already posted in my eleventy-thousand updates, so I'll stick with the theme suggested by a friend: what is it about Bella that casts a spell over so many readers and drives so many other readers smack-dab out of their minds?I got a clue from one of my favorite lines from one of my favorite novels, Anne Tyler's Ladder of Years: "The very thing that attracts you to someone can end up putting you off." That must be it, I decided: the very qualities of Bella's character that make some readers love her, or at least identify with her and root for her, must be the same things that make other readers want to club her and skin her and wear her as a hat.Clearly, all I had to do was sift through Bella's personality and figure out which of her characteristics was having this effect.It didn't take long, and that was my next clue.The secret of Bella's appeal and repulsiveness is this: Bella has no discernible personality whatsoever.
I'm not saying Bella is  not  reckless or stupid...but I would be seriously offended if my boyfriend was dumping me and then asked me a favour, and then that favour turned out to be something as easy as keeping myself safe.
That's  all  I am saying.Jacob does help her for a bit until Bella starts going crazy in the head.
There is something so wrong with Bella, she is a crazy chick and judging by her actions in this book, I think she has mental problems.
Why.....[image error]And next time Bella feels like seeing hallucinations of Eddie: I mean...seriously, WHAT.THE.FUCK?!
I'd already said my goodbyes to the sun.So the first book had conflict, love and sensual embraces that can go no further.
I kept hoping that the book would find Bella learning that she is capable of taking care of herself without Edward and that she can be a whole person without him.
Without Edward, Bella has no more personality.
You never doubt that poor, besotted Bella will choose Edward because she has no identity of her own.I find this whole thing very problematic because it is a YA book.
Not as good as Twilight having chosen to abandon EVERY element that made it so great but still manages to keep this book afloat with the new mystery and dangers.Edward leaving wasn't surprising, he kept thinking about it before when Bella was in the hospital and it was a drama and angst inducing twist- it was bound to happen in due time.
Though not nearly as perfect as Edward, Jake offers a sorely needed element to Bella's tale: humanity.
Bella Swan is on the cusp of her 18th birthday and blissfully happy with her undead beau Edward Cullen. While celebrating her birthday with Edward's family of `vegetarian' vampires, a frightening incident convinces Edward that he's simply too dangerous to be around his sweetheart. He decides to leave the town of Forks in order to ensure her safety - leaving her behind, angry and depressed.

Vast improvement over the 1st book which drowns readers in tween syrup.
This one, about love momentarily lost, has more dimensions and significantly broadens the world of vampires and werewolves.
That you can read 100 pages in an hour or so is also a perk, though...
poor, poor trees.Here, the metaphor for becoming a victim, though not as one would consider in a vampire novel where the protagonist could just become one and see for herself with monster eyes, is actually that of becoming victim to LOVE, or, at least, what the protagonist feels is love.
If I were not to read deeper into this series, then I'd stop reading these books altogether.
I WILL read the third.
Oh yeah, and Bella is a general whiney bitch, Jacob is awesome and the movie sucked.That is all.
Continuing from my review of Twilight, I'm going to refute points that claim that Twilight is better than Harry Potter. I repeat, I'm only posting this because I read this article. I'm literally only refuting the points mentioned in this, nothing else. I don't like comparison, but if the other party does it, be sure that I will respond.  REBUTTAL POINTS 11-20: 11. In harry potter all they do is fly around on brooms and kill people with magic sticks (wands) I mean, really?In Twilight, all they do
Continuing from my review of Twilight, I'm going to refute points that claim that Twilight is better than Harry Potter.
In harry potter all they do is fly around on brooms and kill people with magic sticks (wands) I mean, really?In Twilight, all they do is lust after each other and play baseball.
However, Harry was a bit too dorky and I can't see why girls even liked him.No, Edward wasn't a dork.
Since Edward is a vampire created by Meyer, we can use her written characteristics and apply them to Harry Potter.
This is the worst. Spoil alert: Literally nothing happens.
I mean, yeah, it was still redundant and Bella was still pathetic, but I like Jacob, and I actually liked the werewolf storyline.
It's too bad that Bella and Edward aren't broken up for the rest of the series.
Here are just a few of my problems with New Moon:01) After realizing that the group of people she just passed by (and can now hear screaming) are being MURDERED, Bella comments, "I knew it was stupid to react like this.
Edward's face actually isn't more important than that.
I almost lost my shit reading that part.04) Honestly, I don't know how she wasn't suicidal before she met Edward.
"Then, I realized that she’s the girl who serves me at Taco Bell.” That’s pretty much the story of Edward Cullen and Bella Swan as they walk on the scene in New Moon.
Actually, these stories are not just read/watchable, I even really like both of them because of the villains.The major technical place where the Twilight Saga went wrong, to my mind, was in staying with the Edward/Bella love story, which was mostly drained of any blood (bah dum tsss) in the first book.
You all know Edward's lullaby.Now get ready for...Jacob's lullaby!🎵 Close your eyes, shut your mouth, dream a dream to get us out,Dream dream dream dream dream dream 🎵Okay, but honestly, these books are way more fun if you're seeing Taylor Lautner in your mind. He's just all sorts of animals, isn't he? Wolf, shark, alpaca, and misogynist pig! (Yay!)I'm pretty off topic, aren't I?I really like the Volturi. More murder, please. Bella is annoying but still fairly relatable somehow. I'm still Team Mike Newton all the way #AllMericanBoi
