This is the book on the subject. Muldoon's explanations of his own experiences and what you might expect are extremely pragmatic and lack the usual esoteric New Age woo-woo of more current-day works. He was a Spiritualist of the old-fashioned, sensible type which regarded such things in an ambience of experimentation rather than dogma. For people who might be put off by the cover art, rest assured it has absolutely nothing to do with the subject matter.
یقینا مرگ نیست که نفرین است، بلکه زندگی است؛ زندگی با درد ها و رنجهایش، با شگفتیها و سختیهایش نفرینی است که به بشریت ارزانی شده است. هیچگونه وضع خوش در آینده ارزش این را ندارد که برایش رنج ببریم. هیچ چیزی نمیتواند درد ها و رنجای زندگی را دیگر بار بهببود بخشد.شخص باید به راستی خویشتندار باشد تا در سطح دیگری در شادی به سر برد.
Definitely a unique read, but a little too redundant or something. I become bored with it after the first few chapters. I don't think it was necessary for it.to be that long.
Regardless, I found the book to be easy to read and understand, as well as interesting and entertaining.However, Muldoon didn't seem to claim to be able to guarantee that he could teach others how to astral travel as others do.
I was skeptical of these other books with claims to be able to teach people how to astral travel before buying them, but my curiosity got the best of me.
I got the impression that the author made it seem that if a reader was unsuccessful in Astral Travel after reading the book it was fault of the reader rather than the author.
Couldn't finish it.
