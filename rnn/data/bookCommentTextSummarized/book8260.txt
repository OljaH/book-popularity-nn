I brought this 1960s-era novel along to read on our recent vacation, and it ended up being a really good choice.
In it, native New Yorker Norman Paperman chucks his stressful show-biz/theatre life in the city to buy a run-down hotel on a small Caribbean island, and what ensues -- the constant hotel disasters, the quirky new friends he meets, his naïveté about island politics and work ethics, etc.
It was so easy to imagine the hilarious missteps and misunderstandings that he experienced really happening on some of the islands we visited, especially on those that aren't overly sophisticated about tourism.
It was an easy, enjoyable book, and I would recommend it as a fun vacation read.
As I read, some little gnome in the back of my mind kept poking me, asking "and you think you want to run away to the tropics and never come back?
Not only did I want to miss work & curl up on the couch to finish reading it (it's mid winter in Illinois, what can I say), I also ended up with Jimmy Buffett songs playing endlessly in my head.
Still Kinja!" in my head before I start to get a little freaked out.
Sorry, not a professional review, just a little fun from someone who had a lot of fun reading a great book.

If you are anything like Norman Pepperman it is a bad idea!
But I am so glad that he suffered from this particular midlife crisis and that Herman Wouk allowed me the pleasure of witnessing the antics that followed.
And poor Norman tried so hard to stay positive and upbeat.
He tried so hard to make his new beach life work.
This book made me laugh out loud when I was listening in bed next to my sleeping husband.
Wouk is a master and this book proves it ...
But this book is a complete departure from the above with absolutely no similarities to those more recognized titles.
I���m going to finish this, but more out of grim determination than anything else.
When someone like Siddons writes about the period it is with the understanding that good girls would like to be doing it, ���no, that isn���t it.
Siddons doesn���t assume that some girls are good and some are bad.
A character may be shocked if another one has sex, but Siddons isn���t shocked.
Night of the big party Hyppolite the murderous one comes for Atlas, and after a week or so of heavy drinking and no food, Janet/Iris dresses up and comes to the party.
It would be charitable to say that this is a book written and published before conventions of political correctness could moderate Wouk's mordancy, or to say that the cruel callousness that suffuses the narrative belongs more to the protagonist than to the author.
However, "Don't Stop the Carnival" is just too relentlessly and gratuitously crass to concede Wouk that courtesy: this book is utterly poisonous, and not nearly funny enough to palliate its venom.
In his 1998 forward to "Don't Stop the Carnival" Wouk writes, "My métier is social portraiture." Spiteful caricature is more like it; peppered with snide stereotyping and imprecation that veers toward flat-out hate speech.
Norman Paperman had a gigantic, mind-numbing, mid-life crisis and I’m glad I was allowed to witness it.
Painful, because of what happens to the characters, but also because the story had ended and I wouldn’t get to spend more time all the people I had met.The change in tone toward the end of the book, was initially surprising, but upon reflection, it seemed to be the correct ending.
If you haven’t had your own mid-life crisis, be prepared for something completely ridiculous, incredibly exciting and extremely nerve-racking.
The book was written in the mid-sixties, but the themes are still relevant today.
I read it when I was probably 13 and found an old hard back copy in one of my parents stacks of books.
I thought that was so odd but adored reading it and have gone back to it many times since.
If it isn't a book I really love and see reading multiple times it isn't worth it for me to have it on a shelf.
I also love how out of character it is compared to Herman Wouk's other books and what that adds to my pondering of who he was.
I had no idea of the connection to Jimmy Buffet until many years later.
I was standing in the office of a tire shop in my small, East-Texas hometown.
The air conditioner was ineffectually humming, failing to contest the heat coming through two doors open to the stale baked air outside.
A small man was hunched over a small desk, fingers pecking awkwardly at a keyboard, squinting into an undersized monitor.
There was a 2013 calendar on the wall.
The mechanic, regaling me through broken teeth with his heroics as a young man.
I didn't want to leave.
I wanted to pour burnt coffee into a Styrofoam cup and help them whittle away their pre-lunch hours.
Here's the problem: you can't write 380 pages of comedic farce, then abruptly switch to tragedy for the last 20 pages. You're humming along contentedly with this colorful Caribbean pageant, and all the sudden, it's rather like being kicked in the gut. Too bad about the ending, because I mostly enjoyed the book up to that point, except for the abundant racism and homophobia.
Bad news first: its attitudes towards women, Caribbean people, and the LGBTQ community are ANTIQUATED.
Unfortunately here in the Caribbean a lot of the antiquated attitudes are still accurate too, but that aside, whenever something goes wrong at one of the hotels I work with (which it inevitably will, even things you never imagined could go wrong) I often hear the phrase (or I say it myself) ‘don’t stop the carnival’ uttered in reference to this book.

A good holiday read.
I laughed out loud.This book was recommended to me because some of the antics that happened on the island of Amerigo happens on Caye Caulker.
He's fallen in love with the tropical Caribbean island of Amerigo so he buys the Gull Reef Club, a hotel on a little island off the main island.
He has troubles with immigration, taxi cab drivers who stop in the middle of the road to talk to passer-bys (yes, that happens on Caye Caulker too), lack of potable water, broken cistern and foundation, and every type of employee possible.
I agree with other readers that the mid(20th)century-America race/class/sex-ism of the novel can be distracting/disheartening/off-putting, and the stereotypes it plays on dated ...
He wrote the novel while researching The Winds of War and War and Remembrance while living in St. Thomas.
His white protagonists banter like Nick and Nora Charles, and there are lots of martinis, and planter's punches, and pickled millionaires and machete-wielding "fonny" Frenchmen, and dissolutes and their accompanying debauched Sand Witches ...
It's the best kind of fonny, because if you're like me you cry at the end.
I had no clue Jimmy Buffet had helped the author write a musical based on this book.The blurb calls the book a non-stop, rip-roaring comedy.
I admit the story is non-stop, but it wasn't exactly laugh-out-loud funny.
I found it humorous and enjoyed the writing, but it wasn't the funniest thing I've ever read.Also, I was a little put out by the narrator's prejudices against both blacks and gays.
The narrator works with Broadway stars as a publicity agent, so why he isn't more open-minded, I don't know.Overall, I enjoyed the story but would've liked it more without the bias written into it.
I picked this up because Jimmy Buffett wrote a musical based on the book, and that intrigued me.
The main character, Norman Paperman, is a New Yorker who falls in love with the Caribbean, decides to chuck it all and buy a hotel on a small island called Amerigo.
I'm grateful for the map of the imaginary Amerigo that is included in the front of the book since I'm a visual person and need to be able to see the action.
I loved this book, and it will join the relatively small group of books that I will read over and over again.
I read this book recently when I was staying on Useppa Island.
This book was recommended to me several times while I was living in St. Thomas but I never got around to it.
I found the book to be pretty amusing.
This story takes place in the 1950's on a made up island in the West Indies called Amerigo (St. Thomas).
I'm not sure if I would have enjoyed the book as much if I hadn't lived in the carribean.
The authors description of the West Indians was very similar to what had witnessed while living there, both good and bad.
To be fair, I know that this book is a product of its time. But the overwhelming racism, misogyny, and homophobia is still revolting - I'm amazed that modern readers continue to rate this book so highly. I was so excited to read this because of my personal history with St. Croix, but I wound up abandoning the book halfway through in disgust after Wouk tried to portray an attempted sexual assault through a humorous lens. I'd give this negative stars if I could.
yeah, doesn't rate a 4th star but it's a quick easy read. guy gets bored with his life, guy does the mid-life crisis thing and buys a hotel on an island, hotel needs severe renovation, becomes local hero and sleeps with an alcoholic actress. Meh, little self serving but who isn't? I just might do the same in 'Ol Mejico.
I wanted to like this book. A guy (Paperman) gets up, walks out, and moves to an island. Paperman escapes the rat race we call life and takes over a hotel. Problems pop up like foreign investments. I couldn't get past page 185. It reads so formal, and being the 50's, I guess that and the misogyny was normal. I guess. One of few books I just gave up on.
Not my favorite Wouk, but still a good read. Really liked a commentary by the protagonist about children. That being that from when your kids are born to age 5 is the greatest form of love that he has ever known. It was a powerful page for me at this stage in my life!
Fun, bittersweet. PTSD from my years in the hotel /restaurant business!!
'El carnaval es tan dulce... Por favor: no detengan el carnaval. Por favor... No detengan el carnaval'
Middle aged New York Jew buys hotel on Caribbean Island. He has a lot to learn. Whatever.
Don't stop the carnival by Wouk_ Herman Like this book because it's about a Carribean island where a
I just read "The Keep" and the beginning reminded me of the funniest book I've ever read, "Don't Stop the Carnival".
So, in the interest of science, I thought I'd reread Wouk's book 40 or 50 years later.
I still thought it was a fun book, an easy read, and it didn't seem as dated as some of the Goodread reviews made it seem, but I didn't think it was as funny as I remember either.
So, now, a little disillusioned, I'm going to reread my 2nd funniest book ever, "The Sot-Weed Factor".
OMG.
I loved this book, and Herman Wouk is an incredible story teller.
It's one part fiction, and one-part memoir and though outrageous, totally believable.
The book makes me want to go back and re-visit the author's other novels.
Actually, I may have read only Youngblood Hawke.
So many of Wouk's books have been made into movies that you've seen, you think you have read him when you haven't.
He is still alive and 103 years old.
(September 2018) ( I had to look it up because Stephen King wrote something called Herman Wouk is Still Alive)
Love Herman Wouk. He is a master of description, enabling the reader to clearly see in the mind's eye each character's personality and each setting's details. Though there is more sex (both marital and illicit) than I ever care to read, his characters run the gamut from hilarious to pathetic, sweet and charming to obnoxious and distasteful. He nails the parental angst and frustration regarding finding your way with adult children...and their choice of partners. Sometimes poignant, sometimes informative about island life, but nearly all the way through full of wry humor and outright hilarity.
If I’d read this closer to when it was originally published then I may have given it a 4-rating. Since it’s 50 years old (gag), it felt too dated. By today’s standards, it’s either racist and sexist (re homosexuality) or such references were farce. What’s not dated is a mid-life crisis like the protagonist had. Personally, I think everyone should do something every 10-20 years that scares their eyebrows right off their faces. PS, I wish I’d seen a stage production of this in the 1990s.
