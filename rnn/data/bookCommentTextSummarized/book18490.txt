You have to understand that this flies in the face of everything we know about American civilizations. Sleeping Giants is being compared to the bestseller and now successful Matt Damon film - The Martian - which is misleading, if not entirely inaccurate. The two books' stories, narrative styles, characters and overall tones are actually very different. Almost all the details about this book do not resemble The Martian at all. However, they do share a key similarity. For me, The Martian is not a
Having no clue how this situation could possibly end in survival.Sleeping Giants gave me a similar feeling.
A feeling of wide-eyed wonder at the suggestion of this possibility: the discovery of giant metal body parts deep underground; giant body parts that predate the human technology necessary to create them.
Unlike The Martian, this isn't propelled by a single character's humourous narrative, but instead allows us a look at all the people involved in this project - in uncovering the body parts, finding out how they work, what it all means, and trying to keep their sanity as the world becomes more and more insane.
This sci-fi novel got a lot of buzz when it came out, and I see why.
The basic story: pieces of a gigantic metal robot, thousands of years old, are discovered scattered around the earth, buried deep in the earth or under the sea.
The story is told in a series of interviews -- reports submitted by an anonymous interviewer who is pulling most of the strings behind the project.
The storytelling had to use some rather hard-to-believe contortions to report certain information, and by the end, you don't really feel like you've come to know the characters very well.
4.5 I need to continue this series ASAP!It's been a while since I've been this excited about a new series! Lots of political intrigues, a quick read told in interviews and journal entries... perfect to fight the reading slump I've been in!
*squeeeeeeeeeeeeee*And now that I've got the ARC for the sequel, it's more like *double squeeeeeeeeeeeeeee* :)Old review 2/2/16:A big thank you goes to Netgalley, and I can only ask for an apology for holding off so long before reading this novel.
I'd read the living hell out of the entire series and chortle all the way, knowing that SF is not dead or dying...
The book is was very original and even though it was a new, the concept, the details, the facts, the science, and the characters were very well thought out.
The story maintains its mystery throughout the book and even when the book finished it still feels like an enigma because no matter how much you read there always seems to be more to know.
The integral concept of the book was carried out through the book very well and I hope it continues to do so in the rest of the series.A young girl named Rose Franklin falls into a giant metal hand when she was young.
Instead I read the entire book again, in one sitting, staying up until past 2:00 a.m. Clearly Sleeping Giants is literary crack and I had best stay away from it when any other duty ― or my bed ― is calling.Sleeping Giants takes several ingredients that always appeal to me ― geeky science, governmental conspiracies, a master planner with ice water in his veins, intelligent characters, and dry humor ― and folds them into a mystery about a very strange artifact.
Like World War Z and Illuminae (Amie Kaufman and Jay Kristoff), the story of Sleeping Giants is told in the form of interviews conducted by a mysterious, nameless person who seems to have a lots and lots and lots of power as well as in the form of oral diary entries.
In an ideal world, I would have loved this to pieces and I would have paraded this all over my street saying, "Science fiction fans, come get your mama!"But alas, it is not an ideal world, and this book lacked the emotional pull needed for me to completely and deeply immerse myself in it.
I'm really dumb so I didn't realize I had the first book in the series already and I read the second one but I still really enjoyed the first one even though I read it afterwards.
I knew what was going to happen but I still felt excited while reading and it kept my attention.
Also I love Kara and now I'm even more depressed about the second one.
I didn't like this one as much as the second though for some reason even though the plot line was cool, I guess it just wasn't enough character development and things happened a little to quickly in this one.
So much Deus ex Machina.
Sleeping Giants is an interesting read for anyone who loves Sci-Fi and mecha or giant robot in their story.This first book in 'Themis Files' Sci-Fi series by Sylvain Neuvel and it began with an 11 years old kid, Rose Franklin falling down through a rabbit hole (not really but still, a hole).
Considering that the book is more or less only about 300 pages already, Sleeping Giants is a great page turner that you can definitely finish reading quickly.However, the problems with this storytelling method are it was incredibly hard for me to connect and empathize with the characters.
Listened to this on audio, and it does not disappoint!Great cast of narrators, intriguing story, I was hooked.
I GASPED AT THE ENDING OH MY GOD THIS WAS SO FANTASTIC??????????
I love the idea of this giant metal alien hand thing that has been found and they don't have a clue what is going on!
when she gets off her bike to investigate, she falls down in a crater in the a giant metal hand.
Cut to 17 years later and Dr. Rose Franklin is now a physicist working on the giant hand.
Things are gathered by the crew from all over the world to figure out what they have on their hands <---no pun intended.
We just don't know what is out there and this is going to be exciting if they find out where the giant came from!
3.75⭐SO SO SO MUCH BETTER THAN I WAS EVER EXPECTING. This book was all plot and no characterisation whatsoever but damn enjoyable nonetheless.

Each piece lies in different territories, different countries, so who truly can say they own what?
I will be continuing with this series to find out what happens to the characters, and how much further they come to extra-terrestrial life.
If you think you're going to get this cool story about an alien robot - you're not.
I thought this was going to be much more about the robot and it was more about politics and military ops.
I feel really bad for not liking this more since a few of my friends gave this 5 stars and raved about it.
Thank you Netgalley and publisher for providing a digital copy to read and review!The part where I started to throw in the towel was when (view spoiler)[they decided to dump the robot in the deep ocean off Puerto Rico.
I can't refuse to read a book which has a touch of The Martian.
As I read this book for The Martian, I would love to make a comparison between them.
Hope you guys won't mind.=> In the matter of Characters, this book is pretty much like The Martian.
In Sleeping Giants, we don't a particular protagonist.=> The very thing which I didn't like in Sleeping Giants is that this book has files rather than chapters.
He was the best character in this book.=> The way by which they found the body parts of giant robot was amazing.
I've heard this compared to Illuminae because of the style, and yes, I think fans of Illuminae would enjoy this, but it isn't as much of a production.I listened to the audiobook and that format fits the interview style VERY well since the book is mostly dialogue.
Highly recommend it.The only thing I didn't like about this book is that it is obviously the first in a series.
There was a very quick little twist at the very end that had me like WHOA, but you can definitely tell that this book was just setting up a series.
I am not sure if this sort of thing is for everyone, but I like it quite a bit.
Not that I don’t like the big ones, but I feel more accomplished when I can tear through a whole bunch of the book on my lunch break – and I felt very accomplished with this one!The characters were interesting to get to know.
While that might be frustrating to those who want answers, it will be well appreciated by those who like a dark mystery.I can say I enjoyed this book and plan to read the next .
"This will change the way we think of the world, the way we see ourselves. This will reshape this planet, and we have an opportunity to help steer that change. How many lives is that worth to you?"  4.5 stars.  Some books are just so quotable, you know? ... Well, Sleeping Giants isn't one of them. It frustrates me to realize that even though I laughed so hard through my read (I even giggled! The infamy!!), I just can't show you. I mean, I could, but you'd probably think I have a terrible sense
*headset turned on* Ugh but many awful books are given a 4+ rating here on Goodreads soooooooOKAY, NEVER MIND, listen to this : 1) Sleeping Giants is a scifi novel entirely told through interviews and journal entries, and it managed to picture a complex set of relationship dynamics, which I found so very much impressive because hellooooo, that format doesn't exactly scream connection.
Indeed I genuinely believe that sometimes, we need to step back and look at the overall picture - and that the world would be one millions times less fucked-up if we did it more often.
If you only read one science fiction book this year, read this one. You'll dig it. On the other hand, if you read lots of science fiction books this year, this one probably doesn't need to be one of them.
The audiobook has several different narrators so it feels more like a fiction podcast rather than someone reading a book to you.
From there, the story pans out from that one little tiny town of Deadwood and that big ol’ metal hand, and we zoom out to the US, to the world, to the Milky Way, to the Universe, to the Multiverse, to the Plethoraverse, and beyond!
Find the audiobook if you can, but read it if you can’t.
Really looking forward to starting the next book and seeing where this crazy story goes next!
Also,the epilogue had a nice little surprise!😮😀 One of those books where the blurb is much more interesting than the actual book.Great concept ….so much potential…Aah what could have been!Story begins with the discovery of a giant metal hand.
The entire story is written in the form of journal entries, mission logs, interview recordings and occasional news articles.
But, something is just not right when the epilogue is the only exciting part of the entire book.
Shouldn’t the existence or non-existence of aliens be a bit more exciting or eventful?If the concept intrigues anyone, I highly recommend the audiobook.
I am sad I read it because NOW I have to wait over a year for the sequel.
Told in a series of interviews with an unnamed narrator, this book was an addictive read.
We meet so many interesting characters and the story takes us all over the world.I have a hard time picking favorites for this book.
The interviewer’s identity is never revealed, but I quickly came to realized this person knows more than anyone about the machine.Honestly, so much happens in the course of this book.
well, that was......interestingi feel like i just walked out of a sci-fi movie and my brain is still trying to catch upthis book was published in 2016 WHY HAS IT NOT GARNERED MORE HYPE???
(sidenote: how do books get hyped, like is there one person in charge of determining that??
a squad of super cool readers that choose which books get hyped and which get pushed to the side??
I’ve got a thing for science fiction tales at the moment and this one sounded interesting.
Well, actually the format worked really well.A girl falls into a deep hole and when found is discovered to have unearthed what appears to be a huge hand made of metal.
So rare in fact that it seems impossible that these objects were ‘made’ by earthly hand (excuse the pun).The first section – actually, probably the initial two thirds of the book – is all mystery and serious science fiction which I found complex enough to draw me in.
The story revolves around a young girl who falls into a pit near her home only to find that she ended up lying in the palm of a giant metallic hand.
Years go by and the young girl grows into adulthood and becomes a physicist studying the same metallic hand as well as other strange body parts that are slowly being discovered around the world.
Engraved on many of the metallic parts is a strange type of writing that no linguist has been able to translate but seems at first glance to be an alphabet system of some sort.
Most of the debriefings are conducted by a shadowy figure of power whose identity is unclear throughout most of the book.The strangeness starts when a young girl falls into a sinkhole and accidentally discovers a giant hand.
It's not too much of a spoiler, given the book's title, that the hand is only part of what seems to be some kind of giant, humanoid robot.
Each might be uniquely qualified- but they've all got issues which makes their working together difficult at best and wholly disastrous at worst.I must divulge upfront that I've never been a huge fan of Transformers, Gundam, or any other Giant Robot Battle stories.
She comes to underground, in a big cavern, sitting in a giant metal hand.
So that solved that issue because the main characters were all different narrators.I absolutely LOVED our main nameless narrator.
The great big giant metal being was reminiscent of "The Day The Earth Stood Still", and had similar themes, but at the same time very different.Would I recommend Sleeping Giants?Yes I think any sci-fi fan would appreciate this one.
And it would be perfect for sci-fi novices, especially the audio version which was so easy to listen to!I purchased Sleeping Giants at my own expense on audible.comFor more reviews check out my:BlogFacebookTwitterInstagram
