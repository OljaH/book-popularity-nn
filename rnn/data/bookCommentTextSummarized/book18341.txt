She was able to maintain her dignity and composure as its tantalizing cover sparkled in the sun  yeah, right, she totally freaked out :And she just can't resist breaking into song:As Caitlin slowly approaches what could be the best book of her life, she places her hands on the cover:As her out of control emotions rocket into the stratosphere, she looks around to see if this is a joke:Seeing that it's not, her fingers slowly inch over to open to the first page; inside, her spirit is elated!:While.....on the  outside  our beautiful, clever, and all-together amazing Caitlin shows a little  less  restraint......She is finally able to calm herself down enough to re-approach the book; however, after some techniques are used to slow her racing heart:All of the sudden, the worst happens: the book starts to move away from her!
PenrynWhat I liked about Penryn in this book is her courage to do things on her own.Also her modesty because she never accepted that she is some kind of a hero.Also the motivation she carries with herself is remarkable because even when her world is all falling apart she is determined to protect the people she loves.RaffeWell as I mention in the review of the first book I really like Raffe's sence of humor.There are some sentences that you can't continue without bursting into laughter.PaigePaige is one of my favorite characters in this book.Her new transformation makes her like a killing machine and I really like killing machines.
The humans around you are half-convinced that you’re hellspawn due to an unfortunate rising-from-the-dead incident, your one non-familial ally now looks like a creature from your nightmares, and since he also thinks that you’re actually dead, he’s abandoned you.
Now you’re being carted off to God-knows-where with a group of wounded, dirty survivors that are probably half a step away from turning cannibal.
There’s a darkness in this book that clings to the pages, slithers from the paper to seep up your fingers and wrap its icy tendrils around your heart as you read.
Not the angelic invaders, not the monsters that come buzzing out of the darkness in this latest installment, but the humans.
This may have something to do with Raffe and Penryn not being very exciting apart from each other, because for the first half of the book, I struggled to stay interested.
On the positive side, the second half does pick up after Penryn and Raffe reunites and the horror aspect that we saw at the end of Angelfall really starts to shine through.
There are only so many times Penryn can save Paige before it loses its appeal.----------So I read on Susan's blog that there will be 5 books total!!OMG!
But I don't know how I'll be able to wait so long.
YES.Yes.That's all.
*no spoilers*  Was that you, Pooky Bear?  There are a lot of themes of good vs. bad, the nature of evil, the length of which man will go to survive. As far as I'm concerned, the only message in this book that mattered is: you do NOT fuck with my sister, because I will hunt you down and I will make you pay. I understand it, and I admire Penryn for it.I have a baby sister, I love her. We are the same age apart as Penryn and Paige....aaaand some years after.It hasn't always been smooth sailing, but
Penryn is a strong female character, with a tremendous sense of morality and loyalty to her family and friends that I admire, and the romance was well done in that it developed over time and was not the focus of the book.
I felt the romance was very well done; it was light, it was believable, and I love the fact that Ms. Ee has the courage to not force Penryn and Raffe together unbelievably and unnecessarily.Altogether, a really good book, with likeable characters, in an interesting setting.
Finish writing this book, damnit!...then give it me! Give it me!
4.5 starsI AM EXCITE.
3.5 starsWorld After ticks a lot of boxes but it simply isn't as strong a story as we were given in Angelfall. I don't know how many books are planned for this series but it seems to fall prey to what would be called "middle book syndrome" in a trilogy. The story plods along, giving the novel a weighted feel which made it easy to put aside at times (something that could never be said for the previous book). My rating leans towards the positive because I did enjoy this sequel - Ee has a talent f
Still, the last fifty pages exploded with flashes of everything I love - action, humour, unexpected plot turns and romance - and I adore Penryn enough to know I will be returning for more.Readers will surely recognise the author's delightfully sarcastic touches of humour straight away - I found myself laughing aloud multiple times, even when I'd been cringing in horror and sat tense on the edge of my seat just moments earlier.
World After, on the other hand, takes baby steps and reminds us of many things we already know: that Penryn feels conflicted about her newly monstrous sister, that she and Raffe have the hots for one another, etc, etc.
Scroll down for my full review.My initial thoughts on 9/18/13:On Friday, when I got my ARC of World After: Also, because Amazon actually sent me an ARC!!!: Friday night when I got home and sat down to crack this baby open: When my family wanted to go out to dinner, then shopping, then a million other things that weren't reading: All weekend, when my family had other plans for my precious reading time: Then on Sunday when I finally got to start reading: As I was reading: When Raffe (view spoiler)
But I also loved her inner monologues, where she pondered how best to escape an inescapable situation, how to protect her family, and what to make of her feelings for Raffe.I voted Penryn to the top of my "favorite heroines ever" list the very first time I read Angelfall, but I've come to appreciate her character even more with this sequel.
I think it's because of this -- and her fear for her family -- that Penryn is able to continue, to keep going when it all seems pointless."Raffe looks over at the bloody knife in my hand.
HALLE-MOTHERCUKING-LUJAH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! A COVER (sorta) AND RELEASE DATE! FINALLY!************************************ past updates************************************I've been a patient reader, I know writing sequels takes time butWhen is this book coming out?????No official publication dateNo SummaryNot even book title!>.< !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Please Susane Ee! end my suffering! I want to read the sequel :((*sigh*well... back to being patient.
➦First of all, I think my hubby needs a pair of those angel wings.
Angelplay could be fun, right?
LOL➦Second of all, this shit is great!➦After reading this I know that angels are NOT after human pussy after all.
They are actually all waiting for the judgement day!
Woo-hoo!
That clears things up.
➦And there are a lot of scorpion-looking flying weird thingies.
And they fight with angels too.
Like, wrestling and stuff.
Kinda.➦Scorpions sometimes wed too and wear wedding rings.
They also might or might not have some lion parts.
Angels or scorpions?➦Just pass me the next book :D
“It’s amazing how many times we need to go against our survival instincts to survive.” WARNING: There will probably be spoilers for the first book (Angelfall) in this review. I read the first book of this series about three years ago. I had my doubts about it, since it looked like some typical dystopian/paranormal romance, but a lot of reviewers were saying it had far exceeded their expectations, so I gave it a try.And I was pleasantly surprised! Angelfall turned out to be a dark and atmospheri
I had my doubts about it, since it looked like some typical dystopian/paranormal romance, but a lot of reviewers were saying it had far exceeded their expectations, so I gave it a try.And I was pleasantly surprised!
Angelfall turned out to be a dark and atmospheric book, full of intriguing world-building, disturbing and vivid imagery, a lot of action and excitement, a likable and fairly well-developed romance, and a cool heroine.
There were definitely a lot of sequences that had me on the edge of my seat.• Family dynamics –– Penryn's mother and her sister, Paige, were mostly absent throughout Angelfall, so I liked that they played more of a role in the sequel.
After the first book I really wanted some insight into the Angels and Raffe’s Past, I also wanted to know more about the creepy Frankenstein monsters that were at the Aerie, Penryn’s crazy mom and Paige poor little Paige.
Where ever they go trouble will abound but they seem to always be able to help Penryn out in some way.Even though Raffe and Penryn are apart at the beginning of the book Susan Ee found a very interesting way to show us part of Raffe’s past as an Archangel and his time with the watchers.
The story follows Penryn as she unknowingly becomes a warrior for her kind ...
This story offered just as much action as the last, but, due to Raffe's limited appearance, was lighter on the romance.
Yes, Raffe's now infamous prolonged absence was a bit of a hurdle, but it served well to build the anticipation.
Allowing his sword to interact with Penryn kept Raffe's character present during his MIA moments.
This sequel offers the perfect ratio of peril, humor, and romance, and ends with a strategically constructed cliffhanger that opens up more story while offering just enough temporary resolve to satisfy.
You'll just spoil my fantasy of rescuing an innocent damsel in distress as soon as you open your mouth." -RaffeThis book was action-packed, suspenseful, and completely amazing!!!
Even better than the first book, shockingly enough.
The plot got more complex but also clearer, the characters feelings, and emotions were revealed and the dangers and stakes were heartstoppingly intense and real, which was completely fantastic to read about!!Raffe and Penryn are two awesome, fierce and fearless ppl (well, one's an archangel..), who aren't afraid to fight for what they believe in or die protecting the ones they love, sacrificing everything they hold dear.
Soul wrenching, suspenseful, captivating, and beautiful, all in all, this book easily deserves all the stars in the universe🖤
Oh my that was truly adorable!I won't opt for a long review, but this book is totally worth reading.
So many biblically illustrious books tend to insult religions intentionally or not.
This book didn't really dwell on the religious aspect of Angela and demons, well not enough to cause annoyance anyways.
But overall despite this obvious shortcoming the book is well written, entertaining, and a lot of fun.
I don't own book number 3, and that needs to change yesterday.
“You broke me out of the grasp of a living horror when I thought all hope was gone. You gave me the opportunity to crawl back to life when no one else could. You're a hero, Penryn, whether you like it or not.” Blurb: Penryn drives through the streets of San Francisco looking for Paige. Why are the streets so empty? Where is everybody? Her search leads her into the heart of the angels' secret plans where she catches a glimpse of their motivations, and learns the horrifying extent to which the an
When faced with recapturing his wings or helping Penryn survive, which will he choose?World After takes places straight after the events in Angelfall and we get to see not only Penryn’s story but also a little bit of Raffe’s and also what happened to Paige.I don’t know if this book was better than Angelfall or not but that’s because we see less of Raffe and I missed his interaction with Penryn; also, this book is slower than the first one and I got a bit bored in some parts, I’m not going to lie but I really liked this book.
I just really love Penryn a lot, okay??This was even better than the first one and I am really interested to see where this series goes!
This book had better come out ASAP 2013. I need it now, like candy or Ian Somerhalder, and on second thought, perhaps even more. This one is going to be fantastic, no doubt about it! Hurry up, Ee, you officially rocked my socks, period.Update: January 3, 2014  My Review There are no words for this book. The funny thing is that I went in expecting nothing but perfection. Ee floored me with Angelfall and I just couldn't conceive of a world where the book following such excellence was lacking in an
Things are more complicated than they appear and I am glad there will be 5 books to unravel the mystery of this new world and its many conspiracies.Did I mention, I am hella pleased to have more Raffe and Penryn coming my way?
World After is the kind of book that satisfies and I am so happy.This book was everything I needed it to be, the perfect sequel with an ending that makes me ever loyal to Ee and this series.
A teenager, a mutated girl, a tattered angel, and a sword named Pooky Bear walk into a bar...[insert punchline here][end result = win]4.5 stars.
I just won't say when or how.Not that I wasn't already in love with this series, but when the sword started interacting with Penryn, I did an internal happy dance.
"Do you know how many kills this sword has?""It's a perfect disguise, Raffe.""This sword is not just an angel sword.
The way things ended has me itching for book 3 and I know that I'll be re-reading World After in the meantime because it was that good.
3.5 stars :)this book did not disappoint!
it was nearly as good as the first one :D Although admittedly, the first part of this book was not nearly as action packed and suspenseful as the first one.
The first book started out with a BAM and had me on the edge of my seat for the whole time but for this one, it was kinda boring at first to be honest.
i feel really bad for feeling bored but with raffe missing for a huge chunk of the book and the plot taking a bit of a time to get juicy i was really
Penryn's sister started to grow on me as well and by the end of the book i started to like her again.
(still creeped out by the mom though) Penryn is super awesome and kickass in this book and i was just watching her proudly like-
oh RAFFE <3 i was kinda sad in this book as i did not get to see as much of him as i would like to.
Which just made me so sad in this book :'( like i was looking forward to more interactions between him and Penryn.
UHHHHHH SO GOOOOOD.This series is just so fast paced and so entertaining that it is impossible to put down! I believe this may be a new fan girl series for me as I am already REALLY attached to the characters! Plus it makes my heart happy to know there are going to be quite a few books in this series :D Also, Raffe is super hot, and that sword is super sassy.
I loved this, I really did...just not as much as the first book.I think the reason has to do with the lack of Raffe for the majority of the time. He's off doing stuff, and Penryn is on her own trying to save the day.Which is cool. Really!I think the story was more entertaining when they were all bickery with each other.*shrugs* For those of you who don't like to know anything before you read a book, there are mild spoilers in this review. Be warned! Ok, so what happens in this book?Crazy-Mom get
I loved this, I really did...just not as much as the first book.I think the reason has to do with the lack of Raffe for the majority of the time.
Soylent Green is people!Also, it looks like there's a HUGE Apocalypse conspiracy going on that most of the angels are unaware of, and Penryn has stepped right in the middle of it.
Many theories.One of them is bound to be right, I just know it...There were plenty of other fun tidbits sprinkled throughout the book that made up (somewhat) for the lack of Raffe.Such as:Pookie Bear!
so having heard a rumour going around on goodreads that Susan Ee had heard many of the fans prayers about book 2, I immediately checked her blog, as you do, and prepare yourself there is some EPIC NEWS!!!ANGELFALL BOOK 2 WILL BE RELEASED IN FALL 2013!!!!!!!!!!!!
so yeah Fall 2013, while I can't say I'm too excited about waiting another year (I was still hoping for a Jan 1st release if it had to be released in 2013) but like well all of you I'm just so glad we have news, and this means TITLE, COVER AND SYNOPISIS RELEASE IN THE MEANTIME!!!!!
Find all of my reviews at: http://52bookminimum.blogspot.com/ I decided to break my own rule of reading Book #2 in a series after finishing Angelfall last year and giving it 3.5 Stars (that’s like the equivalent of 7 Stars for most people). I’m giving World After a very generous 3 Stars in hopes that the soon-to-be-released Book #3 gets back on track.The problem I have with YA books in a series is there always seems to be so much filler that should have been left on the cutting room floor. While
I decided to break my own rule of reading Book #2 in a series after finishing Angelfall last year and giving it 3.5 Stars (that’s like the equivalent of 7 Stars for most people).
While World After contained a few awesome action sequences and answered some questions like “what the F are those scorpion pod things?!?!?!?!?!” and “how did little Paige end up a Frankenhuman?!?!?!?!?” there was a lot of time spent doing pretty much nothing.
And when Penryn was doing stuff, it was kind of the same stuff she did in Angelfall - like infiltrating the angels’ new aerie.
ARC provided by NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.
Musste mir vorgestern nach beenden des ersten Bandes direkt den hier schnappen um zu wissen wie es weitergeht mit Penryn, Raffe und Co. Und ich wurde nicht getäuscht, denn ganz im Gegensatz zum klassischen etwas schnarchigen zweiten Band einer Trilogie, war das hier einfach ein wilder Ritt.
Es passiert so viel und immer direkt Schlag auf Schlag, dass ich manchmal echt die Luft angehalten hab beim lesen 😅 die Charakterentwicklung war hier auch grandios, vor allem die von Paige von ich gewagt von der Autorin, dennoch richtig gut gelungen.
Bin nach diesem Teil - und vor allem dem letzten Kapitel (WHAT THE F***?!) - so gespannt wie sich das alles auflösen soll 😱
4 creepy stars   “It’s amazing how many times we need to go against our survival instincts to survive.”   This book. Oh my god this book. I spent a part of it freaked out, another part grossed out and a third part of it I was heartwarmed.  How does Susan Ee do this? Is she a brilliant author mastermind? I remember when this book was released I got it in the mail from amazon and I ripped open the package and started reading right away, because I had to know Raffe's reaction when he saw Penryn ag
I remember when this book was released I got it in the mail from amazon and I ripped open the package and started reading right away, because I had to know Raffe's reaction when he saw Penryn again.
Penryn, her mother and a woman named Clara all leave the resistance together to go find her, and find up becoming trapped on the island of Alcatraz.This book was captivating, even if at times the descriptions made me feel sick.
It was also a compelling glimpse at what humanity looks like when put in extreme conditions together.Overall a great middle book for a trilogy, but it was a little too dark and twisted for me to give it a full five stars.
*5 APOCALYPTIC STARS* "It is painful to see that people prefer a bad guy who looks like an angel to a good guy who looks like a demon.” Yes, yeesss, YEESSSSS! Someone pinch me because this was just too perfect!I think I loved this novel even more than the previous one! Yes, even though Penryn and Raffe were apart for the better part of this. Their reunion made it all worth it though!I felt like them being apart for a while, made them develop more as individual characters and it made me love them
Some of the scenes involving Pooky Bear made me laugh out loud so hard that my boyfriend lying next to me started thinking I'd gone crazy lol.These books were so damn good that I'm only writing this review now, now that I've already read the entire trilogy.
I did notice that not each and every review of these books is as raving as mine, but I think it's mainly the characters that drew me in, as well as the entire setting.
Penryn, Raffe (and Pooky Bear) are all great in their own way and they just have everything I'm always looking for in a main character.
Enter Penryn Young, a teenage girl whose experience with studying martial arts for years comes in handy in the world in which she needs to fend for her paranoid schizophrenic mother and paraplegic younger sister against both humans and angels, each group equally dangerous.
Despite the flaws and the annoyances, it is still overall an interesting and decent read that retains quite a bit of the appeal of the first story and remains full of promise for the remaining books in the series.
