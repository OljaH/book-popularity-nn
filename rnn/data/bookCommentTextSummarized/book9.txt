And now that I have met Joanna Godden I have to say that she is one of the most remarkable of them all.Her story is set in farming country near the Sussex coast.
Thomas Godden has just been buried and the funeral party is returning to his farm, Little Ansdore.The eldest daughter of the house, Joanna, clearly a formidable woman, is at the head of the party and ensures that everything is done as it should be, and as it has been for generations.And after tea comes the reading of the will.
When the will is read out, her neighbours are surprised to learn she has been left his farm, they had expected it to be left to Arthur Alce on condition he marry Joanna.
She shocks everyone by deciding to run the farm herself instead of hireing a bailiff to run it for her, after all, she has been helping her Father with it since childhood.
Even more shocking, she appears in no hurry to marry someone to help her with it.
You'll need to read the book to see if she is as successful in life.
I feel like Joanna Godden is such a Women's Studies dissertation (or multiple ones) waiting to happen.
(It's entirely possible these dissertations already exist.
I'm out of that world, I just know that I'd never heard of it before stumbling on it.) It's maybe a little too melodramatic to be a full-on classic, but!
She's an excellent character.
Thorny and complicated and complex and proud and smart and flawed and great at her work and terrible at love and so very much more than many female characters get to be, even today.
It's not without it's weaknesses and it's certainly of its age/literary place, but still pretty remarkable.
3.5 stars really.
