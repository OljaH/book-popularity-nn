Walter Farley was my favorite horse writer growing up, and I snarfed down these books like they were candy--and I'm old enough that they were still coming out new when I was reading them, and the wait often felt interminable.
I didn't enjoy the Island Stallion series as much as some of the core books, but you really can't go wrong with Farley's books.
Even the bad ones are still good reads if you're a horse lover--well, except for maybe The Black Stallion's Ghost: that one left me cold.
If I had to rank them, it'd be like this.
This book is Walter Farley at his best-- believable, drawing, captivating. As the reader, I was drawn into every hoof beat, every struggle, every moment of Black Minx and her journey into becoming the first filly sired by the great Black Stallion.In my opinion, Walter Farley was *the* horse author for children. There has never been anyone quite like him, especially for boys. His horses are majestic creatures who can only be tamed by the force of love... quite a beautiful theme that runs through all of the Black Stallion stories.
Next to the Black Stallion itself, this is my favorite book of the series.
How can you not adore Black Minx, this spunky, contrary filly who takes on the task of all tasks?
Again, Farley's ability to capture the thrill of a race and still meet the suspenion-of-disbelief limits of an actual racing fan is superb.
He puts you right in the middle of the action and gives you a thrill that's as legit as watching the real thing.
When I was a kid, I used to corrall my friends into pretending to be all the horses from this book.
The book follows Alec and Henry as they break the filly, Black Minx, and prepare her to race at the Kentucky Derby.The Black Stallion’s Filly is undeniably unique as a horse book and an installment in the Black Stallion series, a large portion of it dedicated to horse training and horse behavior.
The Black Stallion’s Filly is one of the most accurate books I have read about the trial and error of horse training, and horse racing, and one I would highly recommend to people with a desire to read a more realistic book about horses.Black Minx has many appearances throughout the book, but I did not find that she, along with Alex and Henry, faced any surprising challenges throughout the plot.
"Anything can happen in the Kentucky Derby."I've said before that I'll always have a soft spot for the Black, so I don't enjoy the books without him as the main horse AS MUCH as those with him. But I love filly stories, because they don't get as much credit as the bigger, stronger, faster colts. So this is a nice change of pace from the Black, Satan, and Flame.
I thought thus book was just okay. when I started reading the series, I only really loved the first book. You should read this book if you like horses, there is a lot of detail.
Read this book if you like horses.
loved every book in this series....my best friend Laura and I couldn't read them fast enough
I was lucky enough to find this book in a hardback edition for $2 at an antique store, so I naturally bought it, expecting to be amazed! Well, it was very good, but slightly disappointing. Not much about the Black, and it wasn't as intense as most of the other books in this series.It is still well worth reading, miles better than most horse fiction, but not as good as the first book, for sure.
Minx puts me in mind of my own three-year-old filly. I hope I have less trouble than Alec and Henry breaking her in this year.... Alec was my favourite "book crush" when I was a kid. I haven't read all these books yet, as they're just the ones my mum had lying around at my grans house from her childhood. I don't even think I've read the first one. I think I first read this aged 9 and it's just as awesome now as it was back then.
It's hard to describe what kind of hold the Kentucky Derby has for many in the thoroughbred racing industry.
This is the best book I've read about the magic and mayhem surrounding the Kentucky Derby, where the Black's cantankerous and mostly tailless daughter Black Minx is entered for the Derby, despite her not ever winning a race before.
Alec is reluctantly dragged along, which shows how grown up he has become when he starts thinking like an adult but yet loyally sticking to Henry as a puppy.This also shows you how things have changed since this was first published in 1952 (the year Hill Gail won the Derby).
The Kentucky Derby, that is - a race that is made and meant for colts.This book takes us through the perilous journey of Black Minx's training into racing form, and through the racing scene as it is the year she is meant to run in the Derby.
We follow each of her possible competitor's through their races, and we feel Henry and Alec's indecision as they get closer to choosing whether to run her in the Kentucky Oaks, a race for fillies, or the famed Kentucky Derby, a race dominated by colts.I loved the diversion of all the other races and race horses that are interspersed with Black Minx's story.
The next instalment in the series finds Alec running Hopeful farm, where he's breeding a string of potential racehorses from the Black.
And when Satan is injured on the track, he joins them at the farm too.
For Alec, it is more than he dreamed for, but Henry is bored, wanting to train.
Like all of the Black's family, she isn't easy and soon the two of them have their work cut out fooling her into becoming a racehorse.
And there is only one goal in mind - The Kentucky Derby.A reasonably enjoyable read.
Still, it's a good read while you get there.
The Black Minx is one of my all time favorite characters.
It's great to see this type of personality in books or movies, and I wish we could get more like her, in any species or format.The Black Minx has her own mind and way of doing things, and she's not going to let any slow human tell her what to do.
Until Alec Ramsey and his mentor Henry find a way to unlock the puzzle of what she wants.
It's the Minx who drives this story, not the humans.
And that's one of my favorite things about how Farley writes.
The story in this book is continued in The Black Stallion's Courage.This book felt somewhat more honest than some of the others in the Black Stallion series. No big axe to grind over the racing industry; it tells the story of overcoming seemingly impossible odds by using the old noggin to really understand horses. A bit more like the original story of the Black, and inspiring to young horse people.
I always enjoy a horse story written by someone who actually has experience with horses. No ridiculous situations that could never happen, or anthropomorphic behavior from the horse. Lots of tension building up to the big race, and he makes you nervous about the outcome even though you really know how it is going to turn out. Farley keeps you in doubt just the same. Only truly great storytelling can keep you engaged and guessing all the way. An enjoyable read with the message not to make assumptions, anything can happen.

This and The Black Stallion's Blood Bay Colt were my favorites of the series. I liked both Black Minx and her boyfriend horse. ;)The fact that Alec and Henry had to get so creative was interesting and entertaining, and while she was definitely a diva, I very much enjoyed Black Minx and her antics. This was just fun.
The filly who didn't want to race/win. Black Minx definitely had her own personality and even had a distinct tail- one made up of hairs from other horses. Genuine Risk was the next filly to win the Kentucky Derby in 1980. After that it was Winning Colors in 1988. WC finished third in the Preakness like Black Minx did.
This was okay, but I read it pretty quick. The other two I read had some sort of plot twist or something unique. But this was just races, leading up to the final and the obvious victory. I wasn't much interested in all the races, so it just wasn't that interesting. Kind of predictable with no unique plot.
Another Farley favorite from my childhood. I still remember the hot potato trick to cure Black Minx's biting, and wondering if that would actually work! I also remember reading that in this book, Regret was the only filly who had ever won the Derby (1915), and being amazed that the book was written long before Genuine Risk (1980) or Winning Colors (1988) won.
I raced through this series as a child. Of course, "The Black Stallion" was my favorite, and I read it a few times, but I waited eagerly for any of the books to return to my branch of the library so I could snap them up.
In The Black Stallion's Filly, Alec and his trainer Henry work together on Alec's family farm. When Henry buys Black's daughter, he has a few querks to get out of her. One is she won't run, above a gallop. Can Alec and Henry get Black Minx to run for them Before they go for the Centuky Derby?
Black Minx's story is better told in the beginning of The Black Stallion's Courage than it is here, in her own book.But then, I think that The Black Stallion's Courage is one of Farley's best books.
Overly long, felt unrealistic. Good to see the underdog win. Liked the exploration of Alec & Henry's relationship but there was lots of telling, not enough showing. It's interesting re-reading these as an adult.
The Black Stallion's Filly and The Black Stallion Revolts by Walter Farley - Two of the ones I actually liked again, after a streak of books in the series that I found I didn't care much for as an adult.
OK, this is my last review of the day.Obviously I was ecstatic to be reading about a female horse. Black Minx is a filly and then she, if my recollection is correct, wins the Kentucky Derby. I don't know if she is the first filly to do so but it is, I believe extremely rare.
I enjoyed the characters, and their world and hope I get the chance to read the story again and/or to read more within the series.My Rating System:* couldn't finish, ** wouldn't recommend, *** would recommend, **** would read again, ***** have read again.
Comfort reread.
I like the temperamental Black Minx a lot and enjoyed reading about her training and the frustrations that went along with it. It was an entertaining story.
