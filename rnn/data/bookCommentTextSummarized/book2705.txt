A lot of well organized ideasDiscussion of types of knowledge with how people should live and behave and how reality is structured and functions. Referred to Descartes and other philosophers and discussed functions of mind to body.
fortune become the enemies of the people, were brutally murdered (1672).What happened in 1672 that led to Cornelius and Jan de Witt brutal murder?
Was it a loss in a ships fortune?
How can ones political fortune become enemies of the people?
What I mean by this is that these ship sailing to the West for rich & fame were highly invested by merchants & regular joes trying to make something of themselves.
I could only imagine the repecussion that resulted in a ship being captured by an opposing country or by pirates, the uninformed people who lost their investments would want to blame someone for their loss.
Important philosophical workFor any one who is trying to understand philosophy, theology, religion, etc. This is an important book. I can see how Spinoza inspired the likes of Thomas Payne, and Albert Einstein, with his appeals to reason, and the intellect. I have it 4 stars because of the 17th century wiring style, which makes it a laborious read, but over all a very interesting book. I recommend this to any who wish to understand western philosophy.
A much tougher and boring read than expected. There were however some lightbulbs coming on now and then. May or may not read it again later in life.
Reading this has been a goal for several years and I just relocated the book that I received from an aunt decades ago. It's an original 1937 edition. WILL read this in 2010!
