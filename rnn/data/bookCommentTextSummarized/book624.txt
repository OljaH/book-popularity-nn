According to Carey, Christ was never a real person, but was known to early "primitive Christians" (the Essenes) as an inner bodily force which could rise up the spine to the pineal gland 'Pinnacle of the Temple' under proper bodily energy conditions every 29.5 days.
The council of Nicea went to great lengths to suppress this ultimate knowledge of divinity being a force within everyone, and portrayed Christ as an actual character roaming the lands.
Totally unique and entertaining read, not what I was expecting, connects a lot of things together - some of which resonates with me.
Good book for exploring the esoteric (hidden) meaning behind religious texts. Dynamos (our relation to and influence on, the Sun), balance, laws of nature, etc are also explored in this book. Read with an open mind.
Enlightening. Breaks the shackles of religious dogma with an unveiling of the allegorical scriptures.Good for those who have been introduced to occult literature. References are made to astrology, philosophy and secret societies throughout.
This book is one of the most eye opening things I've ever read. It answered questions I've had my entire life, while simultaneously keeping me wanting more. Truly Great Book.
MUST READ FOR THOSE IN SEARCH OF NATURE
ImportantA lot of vital information in this small book. Indispensable reference for those on this path. Highly recommended. See other books by this author.
Man is not solely created in the image of God, God is waiting to be acknowledged and revivified within the very cells, the soul of man. A soul willing to be in alignment or to be guided by divine will which is vibrant and wholesome (holy) is the actual resolution of all other ills and blockages of any and all kinds. In responding to the calling of understanding and in valuing our freedom to breathe, think, feel , speak and act, we may truly renew and heal our concept of the world and the whole of humanity.
