A very remarkable and thought-provoking book. This book is 75 years old this year. I'm really glad I took the time to read it carefully. I agree with most of his observations. Not that much has changed, despite all that has happened since 1937. You should read this.
It's a good idea to read this as a companion to Huxley's 1936 novel, Eyeless in Gaza. If the chapter on war does not turn you into a pacifist, I don't know what will. Also the chapter on Decentralization & self-government made me get serious about anarchism.
I have read this book twice. One of my top 3 favorite books of all time.
Ends and Means was published in 1937 in the run up to World War II; this means some of its ideas are very outdated.
That said, it is also fascinating.
Its description of the rise of dictators and nationalism and what Huxley correctly thought to be the run up to war has some unnerving parallels with the global situation in 2018.
I also found the chapter on beliefs where Huxley talks about the human need for meaning (most human minds can't cope with meaninglessness), and the limitations of science in this regard particularly on point.
An insightful look into Huxley's ideal society and his proposed means for achieving it. As relevant 80 years later as it was when it was published in 1937.
I read this before while working at the library. Many parts of this are reprinted in the volume of essays I'm reading. The writing is from the 30's and is surprisingly relevant today. Worth a real study.
Aaaaaarrrg. It's my fault. I expected more and I got let down hard. Mr Huxley asks some commendable questions. His answers are Iess than satisfying.
Excellent..a must read..thought provoking
Idealistic poppycock. However, some good points about the benefits of non-attachment (I'm sure there are pills to induce it). Huxley's prose is pleasurable(as always), so I don't regret reading it.
Totally agree
