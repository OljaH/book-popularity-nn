I learned what a house elf was and how thy are treated.I don't think the Malfoy family should have a house.The up side is that they don't any more☺:]!!!!!!!!!!
I love the Harry Potter series. I personally believe these books can teach you about life in amazing ways. It teaches you about loyalty, friendship, family, yourself, and above all, life. This is one of those books that you forget you're reading because you get so interested in it. J.K Rowling never fails me.
A well written book. Enjoyed reading it.

I read this book years ago it was awesome loved how they discovered the chamber, the giant spiders, how they rescue Harry in the beginning of the book from his home. Loved how " he who shall not be named tricked Harry into taking the diary. It was a great read. Great for children 10 and up even young if there advanced readers.
The book was a really nice book.From one through ten I think its a 9 it was a bit confusing.I think it would be a cool book if you read it.I like this but not a lot.I think you might like this book.
This is a very good book for people who like fantasy it is about a boy named Harry potter who goes to hogwarts and finds out he's magic!!! It's a very good book for 5-8 graders!!! The movies good the book is better!!
Uno de los libros que me iniciaron en la lectura, atrapante y divertido, todos hemos querido estar en un mundo de magia, excelente trabajo de J.K. Rowling, una mujer que crea sueños y nos transporta

I'm sorry I wasn't more careful in my cover selection - I know little about music. I read the book and enjoyed the on-going saga.

I liked this book a lot, but be ready to get through short parts of this book that are boring. But overall I loved this book!
