So, I was already a book addict, and I was going to spend several months in a place where English books were almost impossible to find.My well-meaning parents reminded me that I should pack plenty of reading material.
I was a geeky, junior-scientist kind of 9 year old, and I thought this book was the most amazing thing I had ever read.
So, first of all, if you're being sent to a desert island, try and bribe someone to let you bring at least half a dozen books.
Even though they'll probably change their mind after a while, they may think it's the greatest book they've ever read for at least a month.
Bantam Books obtained the rights for a paperback novelization based on the screenplay and approached Isaac Asimov to write it.
Because the novelization was released six months before the movie, many people mistakenly believed the film was based on Asimov's book.Four men and one woman reduced to a microscopic fraction of their original size, boarding a miniaturized atomic sub and being injected into a dying man's carotid artery.
از آنجایی که این رمان شش ماه پیش از پخش عمومی فیلم منتشر می‌شود، همگان ایده‌ ی اولیه‌ ی کتاب را به اشتباه از خود آسیموف می‌دانند.
FM to be exact.Let's not even talk about the radiation the scientists use to track the Proteus across the body (also, nuclear subs in the bloodstream are kinda harmful), the laser that slices up the blood clot (how'd they get that thing to work underwater, anyway?), the radio waves keeping the clock in sync with the full-size world's time (only explanation I know for the clock slowing down even though it shrank with the rest of the ship)....Okay.
Well, here's the real problem with these straw-colored blood cells:They're silly.
I actually ended up liking this more than I thought I would. The book sometimes feels its age with its Cold War undertones and occasionally clumsy dialogue but, nevertheless, I was genuinely caught up in the misadventures of the Proteus crew as they journeyed into the human body.
The identity of the possible traitor is a well-kept secret until the end and the reader is left to guess until then.
And, if one didn't know that this was written during a time of "happy endings," one might even wonder if the mission were going to be successful.Asimov rarely disappoints--particularly when the material is all his--and has not done so here.
Even though I can tell that this is not pure Asimov, it is still a very good story and a fun and exciting read.
Isaac Asimov agreed to write the novelization of Fantastic Voyage on the condition that he be allowed to make it as scientifically accurate as possible.
Moreover, Dr. Asimov sews up several glaring plot holes and answers many of the crucial questions the movie leaves open, such as "What's the name of the structure in the inner ear that holds the sensory hair cells?" (Spoiler: it's the organ of Corti.) An intriguing mix of Asimov, the pedantic scientist and Asimov, the horny old goat, this story will earn you two credits of human anatomy at your local college, yet will still warm your heart, just as H.H. finally warms Beautiful Assistant's, uh, heart.

E sorvolando sul fatto che la "roba da nerd" sia in realtà qualcosa di spettacolare - Asimov non è solo viaggi spaziali e macchine robotiche: Asimov era un biochimico, un divulgatore scientifico prolifico, un appassionato dello studio del corpo umano.Tra i suoi libri dedicati al corpo umano c'è 
E sebbene sia uno dei libri meno riusciti di Asimov (a detta dello scrittore stesso, che lo ha scritto su commissione seguendo la sceneggiatura del film omonimo), Viaggio allucinante è stato per me una piacevolissima lettura - e credo sia un ottimo punto di partenza per incuriosirsi verso il corpo umano, o verso le opere di Asimov.-----Trovi altre mie letture su Escherichia libri: https://escherichialibri.wordpress.co...
The best female character Asimov drew was Raquel Welch, and that solely was in the movie version. Admittedly, "The Gods Themselves" is the sole exception: a fully-human Asimov female.
El libro me ha gustado más, es más detallado, sobre todo en los planteamientos científicos y en las descripciones de por donde van pasando en su camino hacia el coágulo en el cerebro de Benes.Saber lo que va a pasar por haber visto la película le quita parte del intríngulis, pero aún así me ha gustado más que otros libros que he leído.He descubierto a Asimov hace relativamente poco, y me está gustando mucho.
Ya me hubiera gustado haber leído libros como este cuando era niño.
He makes it very clear that the story and novel is seriously flawed -I bet he could easily have written a book about why the "Fantastic Voyage" was utterly implausible.
He did however, over a decade later, write a second version of the novel, having spent more time to consider the idea and not have been confined by a pre-written film script.
-I have not yet read "Fantastic Voyage II ('82)".This 1966 novelization (which was released 6 months before the film) reads rather well.
To commission a master science fiction author to novelize such a film was a smart move.
This story is well known, and has been copied/parodied many times on various tv shows and comic books.
An interesting trivia fact I didn't know was that the movie is not based on the book.
When the movie was coming out, they hired Isaac Asimov to write the novelization.
They gamble, shrinking a team and a new ship to go inside the defector's body and repair the damage.
The team must get through the man's body, filled with dangers when you're microscopic.
It was a really ground-breaking story, especially considering it was a movie script before it was a novel.
This was the first Asimov book I picked up, and I'm hooked.
Writing about science that is known is one thing, but writing about topics that are unknown takes a special talent to make it believable.
However Asimov still manages to take a neutral side on the unknown.
I actually picked this one up because my family in an effort to stay more connected started our own book club.
We chose to read Asimov, but the catch is we all had to choose a different book he wrote.
Picking one of those however was the hard part for me.
This book was good. Not the best Science Fiction read ever though. It was very interesting in some parts but very, very confusing in the beginning. I did like it though.
Sempliciotto, ma interessante proprio per il viaggio.
Excellent brain surgeon, Dr Duval, accompanies with his beautiful assistant Mss Anderson, are in charged of removing the blood cloth in Benes's brain.
It is going to very interesting, i guess, in the next chapter when they are inside Benes's brain.
The interesting thing here is that Grant seemed to like Anterson, the only female member in the group.
I do understand his feelings at this time, I'd better came inside Benes's brain than stood outside and felt so nervous.
Back to Grant and Cora, this could be the last interesting story of this book because i almost know how it will finish.
second read - 2 December 2003 - *** I re-read this book because I was on a binge of reading Asimov novels. I found it pretty tame, and the tension felt artificially manufactured for visual effect. first read - November 1969 - **** In junior high, I did not go to movies. But I read this book, because my friends had seen the movie. I was awed by the idea of miniaturization.
Me encantó el libro (aún no he visto la película), pero DIOS, GRANT 😠 La relación de acoso con Cora y sus chistes terribles me hacían pesada la lectura. Además ¿qué con ese final de telenovela? En todo lo demás se sentía tan fresco como si hubiese sido escrito en pleno siglo XXI. Me encantó y ya quiero leer la segunda parte.
"It was the misfortune of the Proteus and her crew to be pioneers into a realm that was literally unknown; surely a fantastic voyage if ever there was one."And within that voyage, Grant was now on a fantastic subvoyage of his own; blown through what seemed miles of space within a microscopic air-chamber in the lung of a dying man."
This satisfied the biology nerd in me, and I enjoyed its subtle humor, but some parts felt too contrived for me to give it 5 full stars. (view spoiler)[All the things that went wrong in the mission didn't feel believable. It was more like, ah this is happening so that we can explore a different part of the body again. Bloodstream, heart, lungs, ear, brain, eye, etc. It's quite obvious from the titles of the chapters. (hide spoiler)] I would still recommend it to other biology nerds, though.
The idea of shrinking a submarine small enough to be injected into a man's bloodstream so the team of scientists inside can remove a blood clot with a laser beam had me at hello when I was a kid.
For example, he says that the shrinking process actually sends the submarine into another dimension, which is why it is both tinier and lighter weight than it was to start with, even though it contains the same number of molecules.
He talks about the effect of their reduced size on light waves and a lot of other stuff the movie ignored.If you're only going to read one Isaac Asimov novel in your life it should not be this one.
Kitapta çok fazla zorlama sahne olsa da, yine de Asimov'un hatırı için okunabilecek bir kitap.
However, after an assassination attempt on his way to safety, the scientist is comatose and has a deadly brain clot.
AND, one of the scientists may be a double agent.I kind of agree with science fiction author Harry Harrison who apparently praised the descriptions of scientific - and science fiction - events in this book as excellent, but called the narrative framework of the book "inane drivel." Although drivel is a strong word, the story is clearly Hollywood melodrama and the characters are not typical Asimov.
For those who came in late, Fantastic Voyage was a 1960’s science fiction movie about five people in a submarine shrunk to the size of a bacterium and injected into a man’s living body to perform brain surgery from the inside.
For example, in a scene when the sub’s shrunken crew must replace its lost air supply with air from the lungs, the movie ignores the fact that the miniaturized people would be unable to breathe the huge molecules of unminiaturized air.
Bu kitabı da belki de bu yüzden öncelikli olarak okumak istiyordum.
Tamam belki bilgi olarak çok "hardcore"şeyler üstüne oturtulmamış ama kurguladığı hikaye ile diğer BK romanlarından baştan ayrılmasını biliyor .
Belki de bu yüzden yetişkinlere olduğu kadar bence gençler için de yazılmış bir roman gibi düşünülebilir.Şimdi bu hikayede de illaki "abi bu böyle olur mu ya bırakın gidin nasıl kitaplar okuyonuz" diyip en ince detayına kadar bütün verilerin doğrulunu,uyuşmasını irdeleyenler olcaktır ki bence ozaman zevkine varamazlar o yüzden alın okuyun bazı şeyleri gözardı edin; ama yine de şu linke bakın Asimov elinden geleni yapmış romanlaştırırken bu uyuşmazlıkları çözmek adına yine de illaki kalmıştır(lazer tabanca olayı gibi ordaki)http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantasti...
Credo che sia uno dei miei primi libri che ho letto di Asimov, libro del 1966, l'incontro con l'autore che ha plasmato sicuramente la mia mente avida di fantascienza di ragazzino sognatore che aspirava a quel "senso di meraviglioso", che solo la fantascienza classica poteva offrirgli.Questo per me è una pietra miliare della letteratura di fantascienza e non solo.
Perchè Asimov era anche un grande saggista oltre che un bravissimo scrittore di romanzi e in molti punti sembra di leggere un libro di biologia e di anatomia.La storia è piuttosto semplice: una picoola capsula viene indrodotta nelle vene di un uomo, al suo interno contiene un gruppo di medici miniaturizzati che devono guarirlo da una malattia.
The whole thing is very much in the Cold War context, the miniaturisation technology being fairly blatantly a parallel of nuclear technology.[return][return]Although I am aware of the general course of Asimov's career, I hadn't previously known some of the details of this book - that it was intended to be the novelisation of the film, but because Asimov finished faster than the studio it was actually published several months before the film was released; that he tweaked various details to make it more plausible than the film script; that the story it was based on was actually set in the nineteenth century.
I really liked the last book I read by this author so I was pretty excited to read this one.
The science part was pretty cool, i.e. the concept of miniaturization and the anatomy & phisiology discussed, but the fiction just wasn't there if you catch my drift.
Plus the entire concept of needing to take a miniaturized ship inside a person to remove a blot clot is comepletely lost on a person like me who knows about modern surgical techniques and clot dissolving medications.
I know the book was written in the 60's, but the concept itself is silly when you know that this whole "fantastic" voyage is really a "unnecessary" voyage.
Some interesting facts:Fantastic Voyage is a 1966 science fiction film written by Harry Kleiner, based on a story by Otto Klement and Jerome Bixby.
Bantam Books obtained the rights for a paperback novelization based on the screenplay and approached Isaac Asimov to write it.
Because the novelization was released six months before the movie, many people mistakenly believed Asimov's book had inspired the movie.
8/8/12 I found it fun to read this story, since I've seen the movie a couple of times, the first time being when it first came out.
The book got me reminiscing about fun times.
Yeah, now that is some old school science fiction!This is a novelization of the movie, although this was released first.
Fantastic Voyage was one of my first science fiction movies that I fell hard for (my first was of course Star Wars when I was seven!) I had such a crush on Raquel Welch.
I also thought Stephen Boyd was pretty dreamy, but he did not hold a candle to Ms. Welch ^_^I love Asimov, but for some reason or another, had not read this.
You can tell Asimov expanded on the science portion, as the film neglected much of that.
You can also tell this wasn't quite an original Asimov.
