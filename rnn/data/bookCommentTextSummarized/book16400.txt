No fewer than FIVE chapters end with the protagonist falling unconscious.
The protagonist is almost willfully stupid.
Similarly, Rhia and Merlin know each other for a few days, but some passages infer that we're meant to think of them as lifelong friends.
They don't behave like people who have known each other for only a few days (particularly when Merlin confirms he's not a ghost to Rhia by wrapping his index finger around hers, as if they've had time to make that a gesture with personal history/significance to either of them).
Shim, the tiny giant, speaks like Jar Jar Binks and is equally insufferable.

I remember reading The Lost Years Of Merlin series when I was in Middle School.
I still enjoyed the book, but did not find it as amazing as I did when I was little.Emrys does not know who he is, who his parents are, or what his real name is.
After a terrible fire that leaves him almost blind, Emrys sets out to sea to find where he belongs.
On this journey, Emrys not only discovers much about himself, but also a great amount of his past.Things I Liked:- The description throughout the book.
So epic, leaves you drooling for the sequel.Things I Didn't Like:- The description throughout the book.
Real rating; 3.5.Too much description for my taste.If there's one thing I don't like it's a book who

3.5‚≠êCute, clean, middle grade novel. I think primary school me would have given this 5‚≠ê. But being that im in college it was young for me which I expected but i really did enjoy Merlin before he became Merlin. It was a unique interpretation of what the author thinks about the person that Merlin was before he was all powerful

I enjoyed reading this book, i found it interesting, every turning page there was something exciting, and interesting.
Time passed and he still couldn't remember, one day the town's bully picked on him, he made a run for it.n Emrys discovered something amazing...he discovered he had hidden powers!
One day he couldn't take it anymore, the bully was going to hurt his "mother", he had to do something.
When Emrys woke up he couldn't see anything...he was blind.
He went in search for his past, he couldn't stand feeling like he was useless he was betting himself up.
Then he gets humbled and learns that his powers are meant to help other people not himself.(Theme)In this book you can learn a great many things but the thing that is shown the most is the need of self confidence but knowing that you don't own the world.
Merlin shows a great example of this because at the beginning of the book he thinks he is nothing but near the end he shows a little too much self confidence but then he gets humbled.
You should have a little self esteem but not so much that it just gets annoying.(Opinion)In my opinion, this book was really great.
I usually don‚Äôt enjoy shorter fantasy novels since I seem to need 800+ pages to really become invested in a new world and new characters but this time that was not the case.
ProsThere was just the right amount of travelling and we didn‚Äôt get mind numbing descriptions of every individual leaf along the way.
The plot was constantly moving forward while still taking the time to build the world around you.
There are just the right amount of typical fantasy face-palm moments.
I am starting the second book right away.
I can‚Äôt wait to dive back into this world.
I could not finish this book after five chapters; it was just so boring and icky. Dull, dull, dull. I didn't like it ok?
Throughout the novel, he tries to find out who is he is, who is parents are and where he belongs.Emrys has powers but when he uses them, they result in more destruction than intended and he learns to fear them.
Throughout the novel, Emrys considers using his powers several times but remembers the promise he made to Branwen to never use them in addition to the painful memory where he loses his eyesight.
The first meeting with Shim is beyond enjoyable Merlin: The Lost Years is a journey of self-discovery and is a good start to the world of young Merlin (Emrys).
To tell the truth this is a three star book.
Merlin complains a lot and only cares about himself at first which works for his character but causes me to find it hard to relate to him.
The thing that caused me to give this book four stars is the world building.
For a book that has simplistic writing the world was very detailed and magical.
T.A Barron doesn't explain the magic that drives the world, but I think it works.
You learn about the magic system as you keep reading; you're learning with Merlin, and I found that aspect very enjoyable.

Cringe inducing author introduction followed by Book Party Foul: amnesiac main character. I suppose I should know this, but I never read those plot spoiling blurbs. Audiobook DNF.
Barron‚Äôs imagineering of this portion of the great wizard‚Äôs life gives new depth to the renowned character as we see his life through the eyes of a young boy.The story opens with a dream sequence foreshadowing a time magic escaped his fingertips to unleash a fire kindled in Branwen‚Äôs defense (the woman claiming to be his mother) the very fire whose flames took his sight leaving him blind until he learned to use his gift of ‚Äúsecond sight‚Äù.Emrys, now 12, is desperate to know of his past and why he has no memory of a time before five years ago when he and Branwen washed upon the shore.
E que mente desperta nunca antes idealizou a inf√¢ncia, a juventude de algu√©m que admira, ou de algu√©m cujo um dia gostaria de ser?Merlin ‚Äì Os Anos Perdidos √© a resposta a todas as preces juvenis cuja curiosidade em torno de t√£o enigm√°tica figura m√≠tica, o pr√≥prio Merlin, pode vir a tornar-se perigosamente viciante.
Barron sabe captar o interesse do seu p√∫blico alvo, com afiadas garras e sedentos dentes, e n√£o fosse eu uma leitora j√° t√£o demasiado exigente, d√∫vidas n√£o me restam de que esta viagem, esta leitura teria sido um aut√™ntico deleite para os sentidos.Antes de se tornar Merlin, o menino que outrora deu √† costa sem casa e sem mem√≥ria foi Emrys.
And Merlin's youth, be him the wizard or simply wise man of King Arthur lore, has got to be one of the most interesting parts of the story, though one we know nothing about.
I can see the dwarf giant Shim as a Jar-Jar Binks type of character, especially with the way he talks and is always scared but trying to be brave.
I adore these books.
I read them the first time when I was 13, re-read them again at 18, and now at 23 own them and read them for leisure at various times when I'm in between quality books.
They're chalk full of fascinating characters, plot twists, enriching and exotic places, evil villains, beautiful love stories...these five books have it all.
In my humble opinion, they're books that don't come along often.
Obsessed with these books.
It's important to note that these books are separate entities.
If you can do that, and also understand that the books were primarily written for younger audiences, you should thoroughly enjoy them.
:/ wellllll....n√£o gostei por ai alem. n√£o consegui de facto sentir empatia pelos personagens, pelo que a historia em si n√£o me seduziu minimamente.apesar de a escrita ser fluida e os personagens bem caracterizados, o tema n√£o √© para mim garantia de uma boa historia. fica com as 3* porque apesar de tudo gosto do "Merlin" :P
This fantasy novel is rich with creative and lovable characters and a lush environment that will instantly draw you in. The book begins with excitement and mystery, intriguing you to read further. I can't wait to continue on with this series! Barron's writing is fun and he paints a great story of his theory on Merlin's young adult years.
Encontr√© estos libros de churro en la librer√≠a, hace unos a√±os, nada m√°s compr√© el primero para ver qu√© tal estaba y no me dur√≥ ni un d√≠a.Es la historia de Merl√≠n cuando muy joven. El muchacho queda ciego y debe aprender a ver con su ojo interior, y es as√≠ como empieza a descubrir que puede ver mucho mejor y puede hacer muchas m√°s cosas.
A book for all ages. In this excellent tale of the wizard between the mortal and divine, voices appear in Merlin's head and he wants his memory back to know who and what he is. Later Merlin learns, like Luke Sky Walker in Star Wars, that his father is the evil one. It is in Chapter 4 "Sacred Time" that Merlin recreates the classic myth of the eternal return, rebirth.
I found this series when I was 11 years old and I couldn't read them fast enough. Here, more than 10 years later, i'm still so very disappointed in myself for not making all of them my own. They all are enriched with the values of friendship, family, courage, and of course magic. I always envisioned it as a pre-harry potter series, even though I discovered it after I began the HP series.
I loved the idea that the author chose to write. It takes great imagination to invent a world and characters that create the beginnings of a character that has been written about for so long. I found the narrative compelling as well as believable.
This was a good book that tells a good story about the early years of Merlin. It gives you an idea about how he came to the name Merlin as well as how he learned his magic, and why he was gone from history during those early years.
I've read the whole series and I love it, the fantasy aspect and the amazing characters will hook you on the series really quickly.
Bello come dodici anni fa ‚ô°
....*sigh* now I need to find the rest of the books >.<
Watching his journey as he grew older was magical. I hope he finds out about his past.
Re-reading this series. It's been years since I read the first one.
