A desperate-sounding woman pleaded the lawyer to follow the instructions in the package with his retainer right away.
Instead of blindly following the instructions Mason decided to dig around a little being moved by the way the woman's voice sounded.
This is an interesting Mason mystery in the sense that was not even clear who was Mason's client until the last few pages.
At some point I was 100% sure one of the events was a dead-end red herring going nowhere.
I was wrong as everything made sense in the end - obviously after Mason explained the mystery to the police and the readers.
THE CASE OF THE ONE-EYED WITNESS.
Erle Stanley Gardner.
***1/2.This is an interesting case for Perry Mason that doesn’t all fit together until almost the very end of the novel.
The key to the solution of the case is suggested to Perry by one of the witnesses he meets on the stand.
He realizes that one of her physical conditions lead him to reconsider how the murder in question might have occurred.
The courtroom scenes in this novel are very vivid and graphic, and helps to show how Mason became the great lawyer he turns out to be in case after case.
This one starts uniquely, with a woman (who's name we don't learn for sure until near the end) making a frantic phone call to Perry and Della at a restaurant.
Only Perry Mason would have so unusual a dinner!Based on the contents of the package, soon thereafter Perry and Della interview a strange older man in his house.
There follows a (second?) murder and a strange bus and airplane ride to Sacramento, as the "plot thickens." Perry soon learns who his client is, the woman who sent him the package at the restaurant -- or so he thinks; the woman refuses to confirm it.
This otherwise enjoyable book was spoiled for me by the casual racism on which the plot was based.
Definitely one of the better novels in the Perry Mason series. Not so formulaic, and the style is more colorful and descriptive.
Stars: 4 / 5Recommendation: For everyone who have fetish for courtroom drama, this is the lawyer's case files that one would definitely want to read.The Case of the One-Eyed Witness is the 36th installment of the Perry Mason series by Erle Stanley Gardner published in 1950.The case opens with a phone call that Perry mason receives at the restaurant he and Della were having dinner from a woman who urges him to go meet a certain Medford D.
Are both these woman the same?Baffled at how the events of the night were turning, Mason along with Paul and Della trudge forward in unraveling this very weird case, with Lieutenant Tragg hot on their trail - for whichever lead they turn up, that lead ends up getting killed.
I had a hard time getting into the story.
The plot was scattered at first and Mason didn't seem to know what he was doing.
Afterwards, Mason would fill in the discrepancies from his observations.
I felt that if those observations had been written in throughout the dialogue, I would have read the scene differently and been able to draw my own conclusions.
So much of the fun of reading a mystery is trying to solve it myself.Overall, I enjoyed reading this story and may even read another in the future.
As I read through the book I thought I was steaming to a socko ending.
Instead it was more of a smelly sock.Gardner slowly ambles through a perplexing number of events that seem to go nowhere or connect.
All that stringing along and Gardner couldn’t unstrung some and better spell out conclusions in a better planned story.
There’s a lot of fluff to get through to have the narrative at the end undo a bunch and retell to a conclusion that couldn’t have been figured out until the last few pages.The writing is, otherwise, good.
It’s the plotting that is pure stinky socks.Bottom line: I don’t recommend this book.
This was written nine years before the TV series began, but it's impossible for me to read a Perry Mason novel without hearing the voices of Raymond Burr, William Hopper, Barbara Hale, and company. I'm sure that helped my enjoyment of this book. The gimmick of Mason receiving an anonymous phone call and not even knowing the identity of his prospective client added to the mystery. The conclusion felt overly complex to me, but otherwise, this is an adequate 1950's mystery to read on a plane.
Another of those cases where Gardner narrates the red herring throughout the book, suddenly springing the real story at the very end. To be fair though, he does leave a hint at the very beginning, which gets its rightful place in the story, after Mason's super smart brain guesses the real solution!
An odd case where Mason seems to believe throughout that his client committed the killing (albeit he believed in self-defense). He seems to stumble into the solution of the case by luck.
This is the first Perry Mason book I’ve read. It was interesting, especially from a historical standpoint. I enjoyed the older expressions we no longer hear. It is a quick and not a bad read.
This is a good Perry Mason mystery. Sometimes a little hard to follow and I think I like the TV adaptation better.
My Rating System:* couldn't finish, ** wouldn't recommend, *** would recommend, **** would read again, ***** have read again.
Also, the cover is quite striking ;-).This book was quite different from the last few Perry Masons I've read; it's got more legwork for Mason, and the numerous twists and turns kept me guessing.
Even after I read the explanations at the end, I was still confused (and I'm not entirely sure I understand it even now).The other reason is that the book is a little dated.
What seems like an insignificant matter was turned into a motive to commit crimes because of a pervasive racist attitude in American society of the time.
#36 in the Perry Mason series.
Remembering that this 1950 series entry was written in post-war California explains the anti-Japanese prejudice in one of the plot devices.
This entry has an unusual number of plot twists and levels of conspiracy.
The only clues are a news clipping about a blackmail case and the combination to a safe.
The case is a tangled web involving an eccentric widower, a sexy cigarette girl, a shady real-estate broker, a wife, a lover, and too many loose ends.
It's funny how often Perry, after a long day in the courthouse, winds up in night clubs as he does in this one.
By 1950 Paul Drake is getting a bit cranky about getting out of bed at 3 a.m. to go to Perry's bidding.
Della Street is still a "can do" girl.
Now she's usually giving Perry her take on the female psyche of the clients.
Oh. And there's a child with a "drop" of Japanese blood where such a thing would be a taint to the adoptive parents.
He speaks at length about the unwanted Japanese.
A classic Mason case from around 1950-the date and setting (California right after WWII) is important because of the underlying reason that the blackmail is so effective-it would no longer be the case.) Besides that though,this is great fun-a very complicated plot with a client who just will not tell Mason the truth and with some funny scenes with an extremely combative know-it-all witness. One of the stories where Perry offers marriage to Della but she just loves her job too much to want to be a wife and sit at home...sigh... (remember the date!)
This Perry Mason is great. There is a bit of everything you read them for, the court room haggling, sparring between Lt.Tragg and Perry, Clients that hide the truth and obvious 1940s mindsets. This one also has some hilarious and improbable scenes that delighted me.My favorite is a bit of dialogue between Perry and an officer who is trying to pull Perry over for speeding. I will get an accurate quote here later, but the main just is as follows'Hey, Buddy Where's the Fire?""1690 Delaney St.""In all my years on the force, no speeder has ever given the right address..."
Perry Mason gets involved with a case where he isn't sure who is client was. He goes to trial in a murder case of mistaken identities, double crosses, and a witness with only one good eye. In this story all the surprises are in the court room as Mason cross examines all those involved. He has to stall in the court room to give him to figure out whose telling the truth. It's a good story, and the twist of who the one-eyed witness really is really helps out with the mystery.
I grew up in the LA area in the 1950's, I read serialized Perry Masons in magazines as a child, and I've always enjoyed the t.v. episodes; consequently, reading a Perry Mason is comfort food for me three times over. The plots are sometimes a bit convoluted, but I love the details of place and time, and I especially love the interactions between Paul, Della, and Perry.
I am not going to add all the Perry Mason books I've read. Suffice it to say I have read them all except the last one "The Case of the Crying Swallow" and that is only because I haven't found a copy yet.
Here is another case of having read almost every on of Erle Stanley Gardner's books and enjoyed them very much. I have also read some of his book written under the name A.A. Fair. They were also very good.
quick read, while i had an idea about what happened was still kinda surprised by the who at the end of it all. first time i read a Perry Mason so not disappointed, but there is an arrogance to it. will say that it is very dated so keep in mind if you decide to read this.
I read every Perry Mason mystery my Jr. High Library had available (there were a lot), but I don't remember any specific ones any more!
I am quite sure I read all the Perry Mason series, so will need to go back and add them all in. It might be fun to re read some of them.
Wonderful book. Really interesting crime story. However I think if you have read atleast few of the other Perry Mason books, this would be more pleasure to read.
erry Mason is brilliant! But of course, it's the author who's worthy of praises..
My first Perry Mason. I still Like Agatha Christie better.
Just bought it. Haven't had any tome to read it yet.
