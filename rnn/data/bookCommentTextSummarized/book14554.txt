Warning: Extremely Long Review and Childhood StorytellingWhen I was ten or eleven, I was sitting in the playground at summer camp, minding my own business and reading this book, when one of the playground supervisers came and asked me what I was reading.
When I showed it to him, his eyes got wide and he took the book from me.
If you've read the book, you know that Dahl doesn't exactly idealize witches.
So the story ends well, but I always remember this incident when I see this book.
I barely remember what happens in The Witches, but I love it simply because of what it represents to me.
I didn't know what to expect when I started this book. Believe it or not, this is the very first Roald Dahl book that I have experienced. I enjoyed this book tremendously. This chapter book tells a story of a grandma, a grandson, and their journey together is ridding the world of 'real' witches and saving the world's children. I will be reading more of this author for sure. I would recommend this book to everyone. It is a fun read and well worth the experience!
Re-read for our classics discussion Friday 10/30! Still had me giggling from the very first chapter.
I had read a few of his books as a child, but most of my exposure occurred as a young adult and while in college.The Witches was actually a book I read after the movie with Anjelica Huston was produced.
I'd definitely recommend reading the book first as the movie takes the story so much further.For one thing, the book has an unnamed narrator and grandmother, whereas the movie is very detailed on the history of the characters, the various types of relationships, etc.
The creativity and imagination from the works he's produced over the years is quite astonishing.The Grand High Witch runs the show here, and she won't let you forget it.
I am not, of course, telling you for one second that your teacher actually is a witch. All I am saying is that she might be one. It is most unlikely. But--here comes the big "but"--not impossible.  After the tragic loss of his parents, a young boy goes to live with his much beloved grandmother. He soon learns of the impossible - witches exist. And they're sole joy in life is to find ways to make children disappear. Preferably in nasty and mysterious ways.We soon discovers how to recognize a wit
He soon learns of the impossible - witches exist.
Preferably in nasty and mysterious ways.We soon discovers how to recognize a witch - they have clawed hands which they hide under gloves, they disguise their toe-less feet in pointy shoes and their spit has a faint blueish sheen.
REAL WITCHES dress in ordinary clothes and look very much like ordinary women.
His fiercely protective grandmother does her absolute best to protect her grandson - arming him with enough knowledge to recognize and evade capture of one terrifyingly normal-looking neighborhood witch.
The grandmother-grandson relation was absolutely splendid.
The clever and courageous tale of a young boy and his spirited grandmother who fight witches together.
Do them in!Boil their bones and fry their skin!Bish them, sqvish them, bash them, mash them!Brrreak them, shake them, slash them, smash them!Offer chocs vith magic powder!" Oh, thank goodness for the likes of Roald Dahl, who can combine the scary with the funny stuff and open a treasure chest of children's fairy-tales with all the wisdom humanity is capable of (which, of course, still is quite limited).As a child, I was terrified and fascinated at the same time when I read this story, hiding it under a pile of other books before turning off the light at night.
Without the mischievous charcoal drawings to accompany it, Dahl's text alone would be one of the scariest books I've read, electrified with truths only children know about the treachery of adults and the irrational evils of the world.The story is spun by a seven-year-old British boy whose expertise with REAL WITCHES begins when he travels with his parents to visit his material grandmother in Norway for Christmas.
Finding he quite enjoys being a mouse, the boy reunites with his grandmother, who sees an opportunity.All the rooms in the Hotel Magnificent had small private balconies.
I am currently trying to read all of Roald Dahl's books! When reading this book I realized that I definitely read this when I was in elementary school :) It brought back some memories. I loved this book and the creativity and that Roald does with this story line.
The story is set partly in Norway and partly in the United Kingdom, and features the experiences of a young British boy and his Norwegian grandmother in a world where child-hating societies of witches secretly exist in every country.
مادربزرگ او زنی ست مسن، که تجربه‌ و دانسته‌ های بسیاری از جادوگرها دارد، و در اوایل داستان تلاش می‌کند، که با متقاعد کردن نوه‌ اش، مبنی بر این که جادوگرها واقعی هستند، این دانسته‌ ها را به او بیاموزد.
قهرمان داستان به همراه مادربزرگش، به تعطیلات تابستانی در سواحل انگلیس می‌رود؛ و در هتلی ساکن می‌شوند.
I was a very sheltered child. Or was I a wuss? I was probably a wuss. For instance, when I was a little tot, Sammy Terry scared the shit out of me. I remember being frightened by commercials of the Nightmare on Elm Street movies, and the one time I inadvertently saw part of a Friday the 13th movie on TV? Fogettaboutit. Nightmares for weeks. But that all came later. But this book. Oh, this was traumatic shit. I was in preschool, probably 4 years old, when the teacher decided to read us The Witche
For instance, when I was a little tot, Sammy Terry scared the shit out of me.
I was in preschool, probably 4 years old, when the teacher decided to read us The Witches.
And *SPOILER ALERT* when that one kid got turned into a mouse, it scared me so bad I cried!
I cried in front of the other kids, and they all thought I was a wuss!
I can't remember the book that followed The Witches; it didn't scare me, whatever it was.
Nobody found out what happened to the little kid who got turned into a mouse.
Things that are cool:-a cigar-smoking grandma who encourages you to take safe action-investigating -solving problems-witches with accentsThings that are creepy:-Having to stay a mouse the rest of your life-Feet without toes-Pet mice that go missing and are never found-A boy who is never reunited by his family, or even mouse-trapped-Talking about dying while in bed with your grandmotherRoald Dahl never worked for me as a kid.
I gave this one a shot on strength of 1) Halloween spirit, 2) a friend review, and 3) adding to my witch lore.
The story of the young unnamed narrator and his grandmother living between Norway and England and affronting the Great Witch and her minions was delightful and fun. It would not be in my Top 5 of Dahl though (I appreciated the two Charlie books, the BFG, the Magic Finger and James and the Giant Peach more.) I love reading them to my kids in any case and getting all excited on what crazy twists the stories will take.
. when this idiot playground dad got in my way.So, the story goes like this.
oh, if only I could truly perform spells.It's interesting, isn't it, that Roald Dahl (one of my most favorite writers) invented witches who loathe children and turn them into mice.
men acting like pigs being turned into pigs.
They act like pigs, so she feeds them some magical food and summons their true essence.I do not say this to disrespect men.
men who can't handle a woman's boldness.
And you could do a lot worse than to summon your inner witch.”(Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned.
I've noticed for years and years that critics love to say that Roald Dahl is "spinning in his grave" over some such filmic adaptation of his works.
Don't dance on my grave.
(Gosh, real critics are so harsh.) If he's spinning I guess there's plenty in there to make lots of racket.The movie wasn't that bad.
That was kinda awesome.I was a Dahl fanatic as a kid.
(Hold up, Trunchbull of Matilda did nasty things to kids!
Only the ones who read, mind, like Matilda.
Reading Matilda.) Anyway, it was funny and gruesome and nasty and I loved it.
Roald Dahl is one of the best and my favorite children's writer. He's a master in depicting ordinary details in excellent manner. Uptill now, I didn't find anything written by him which I don't love. ♡
What happens next will test young Dahl's ability to remember all the traits and actions witches undertake, as well as a conspiracy that the Grand High Witch of the World has for all the children.
Do YOU know a witch in your daily life?Dahl's magical way of presenting things to children is highly entertaining and allows me, a full-fledged adult reader, to tackle an enjoyable and short piece.
His personalising the story pulls the reader in a little more and, even faced with adversity, Dahl does not push things to the edge of despair.
I have always liked Dahl stories in my youth and see now just how uplifting I feel.
One of my daughter's favourite books and I still have it today. Storytelling at it's best.
The witches of England have a plan to do away with ALL English children.
This little Norwegian orphan boy and his grandmamma come up with a plan to do away with all English witches instead.
If you suspect that someone you know could be a witch, check for the following: 1)They always wear gloves to hide the curvy cat claws they have instead of fingernails.
2)Real witches are always bald as a boiled egg, but they hide it with first-class wigs.
3)Witches have bigger nose-holes than ordinary folks, the better to sniff out little children with.
Maybe I should learn the language and go live there, where we can all unite in our hatred of this book.It seems to me that 90% of the reviews said things like "Scared the crap out of me as a kid, but I like it now." Except...this is supposed to be for kids?
As a kid, though, you end up terrified that you'll see a violet glow in your teacher's eyes if he or she gets short or loses patience with you.
I do enough scaring of children just by getting my job done; I don't need a book around that's going to convince kids that I am about to eat them too.
Una historia de fantasía para chicos y no tan chicos, sobre las aventuras de una abuela muy peculiar y su nieto, para desbaratar a la Sociedad Secreta de las Brujas.
Las brujas, que odian a los niños y quieren librarse de ellos, están por todos lados, y van disfrazadas de mujeres comunes y corrientes, pero tienen ciertas características con las que pueden ser identificadas: 🎃 llevan guantes para esconder sus garras, 🎃 son calvas y usan peluca, 🎃 tienen un olfato muy desarrollado, 🎃 su saliva es de color azul, 🎃 sus ojos cambian de color, 🎃 y no tienen dedos en los pies.
Gorgeous, cute book and the illustrations of Quentin Blake are just too cute as well. I've seen the movie of course several times and hey, the movie has a different ending, that is a surprise! Roald Dahl, a great, entertaining writer...! I really need to start reading the 'grown-up' books soon :-)
For people who don't already know: the hotel used in the movie actually exists. It's The Headlands Hotel, Newquay, England, and I've eaten there several times. The staff are friendly and well aware of the relevant history. If you ask, they'll show you the room where the witches had their big meeting and the spot where the baby carriage nearly gets pushed off the cliff. The food is good, and you get a fantastic view over the bay, where people surf in summer. Recommended!
3,5*No tuve el placer de leer los libros de Roald Dahl de niña, ¡pero nunca es tarde!Tengo que reconocer que de haber leído este libro de pequeña probablemente me habría vuelto un poco paranoica buscando brujas por todas partes...!
Me habría gustado que ciertos puntos sobre el aspecto físico real y "deformaciones" de las brujas no se hubieran tratado como rasgos horrorosos y específicamente relacionados con su maldad (calvície, no tener dedos de los pies).Dejando esta crítica de lado, la historia me ha entretenido mucho y las ilustraciones me han encantado.
Planeando ya cuál será el siguiente Dahl que lea, probablemente Matilda :)
Reto 33- 2018 Book Challenge:  Un clásico infantil que nunca has leído. Sigues siendo tú mismo en todo menos en el aspecto. Sigues teniendo tu propia mente, tu propio cerebro y tu propia voz, gracias a Dios. Igual de tierno y creepy que la película. XD Ame a el protagonista y a su abuela. ^_^
Readers in the Roald Dahl know come to his books with an understanding that PG-13 level violence and mayhem are a part of his charms. This fast moving tale doesn't let fans down; all of the recognizable Dahlian tropes are on display and we are rooting for the child all the way to the end.I had the extra bonus of having this read to me by my daughter. She's at the stage now where she tries on different accents for each character; her English accent was adorable. So, five stars for the book, five stars for Bel the bookreader.
As I sat there biting my nails and screaming at those witches ‘not the soup, please don’t eat the cress soup’ (because a boy mouse had put the spell into it, so that the witches were to get a taste of their own medicine, so to speak), the cat was rigid with anger, hair, whiskers, tail, you name it, it was standing on end.
This cat will never speak to Roald Dahl again.
How dare he dangle such a prize in front of him, the most delightfully plump, tender young mice, and then take it away like that?Signed NGE and..okay...go on:
De pequeña vi la película un millón de veces, la tenía en cinta VHS original, ni siquiera grabada de la tele.
Me acuerdo bastante de ella y tengo algunos fotogramas grabadísimos a fuego en la memoria y me sorprende mucho no haber leído el libro antes, pero para todo hay un momento.
He disfrutado muchísimo la lectura, creo que tiene un humor muy particular.
Es un libro fascinante que pueden disfrutar los adultos al 100%.
Además es lo primero que leo de Roald Dahl, porque adaptaciones de sus libros he visto muchas, pero nunca había leído los originales, y me ha encantado la forma de expresarse y de narrar.Muy recomendable.
Me encantó. Lo encontré mucho más retorcido de lo que esperaba, entiendo porqué la gente lo ama.Me hubiera gustado leerlo cuando era pequeña !!Recomendadísimo <3
And they love forming a club.I swear I have worked with one or two witches in the past.Everyone knows this story, especially since the movies came out in the 90s.
The movie came out just that bit late for me, however I did watch it later and I feel that it clouds my enjoyment of the story.
It's the same with 'Matilda', the movie was too late and nowhere as good as the text.So, the story is that the main character's parents are killed in a crash and he goes to live with his grandmother who is Norwegian and knows a bit about witches.
