In the mean time we have Pug (yay) and Tomas (yay) back together.
I remember when they were just little boys together =) But, they are grown and Pug is a masterful wizard and Tomas has some issues when he put on this armor.
Well, we get to find out why Tomas changed in this book and it's cray, just like everything else.
Oh, and there is a wonderful revelation behind the dragons <-- pun intended to those who read the book and know what I'm talking about.
Pug and Tomas have to travel to a place (with Ryaths help) to find Macros.
I gave this a star rating back before I was adding reviews to every book - I am sad about that because this book is a great ending to a great saga and I hope that a verbal review will draw more readers to the flame of Feist's fantasy world!
Even though this ends the Riftwar Saga, there are many more books in the series overall to keep this story going!Thanks to Melissa for reminding me to come back and recommend this series on others!
If you are a fantasy fan, you owe it to yourself to read this series.Click here for Melissa's review - go over there and show her some love, too!
*** 4 ***A buddy read with some friends @ BBB "...“power is limited to the strength of will within the man who holds it. Falter in your resolve and you will fall. Remain steadfast and you shall prevail. Always remember that. "..." This was a nice way to wrap things up for this first arc of 4 books in the Riftwar Saga. It started a bit shaky, there were some meandering passages, but overall, it was a classic Fantasy which hit a lot of favorite notes for the fans of the genre. Loved Jimmy and Loky
It started a bit shaky, there were some meandering passages, but overall, it was a classic Fantasy which hit a lot of favorite notes for the fans of the genre.
Aruda was the man throughout and Pug, Tomas and the old Magnus were a pleasure to read about once again.
Maybe I need a bit of a break from the genre, which I have been reading non-stop for the last two years...
Despite all of that, I would recommend this more traditional Fantasy to fans of the genre, adventure and military fiction.Now I wish you all Happy Reading and many more wonderful books to come!!!
I am satisfied with the conclusion of the 'Riftwar Saga' Alhamdulillah!'Magician' is the best book in the series.
And some less familiar faces re-appear and make a much better impression in their second time around.
I was happy to learn about the rather mysterious creation of the city before the book ended.This final entry in the series was extremely light on what was happening with the female characters that we got to know in earlier installments.
I thought that some scenes from Anita’s or Carline’s points of view might have been interesting or at least a good contrast to the battle zone.All the major characters seem to be suitably paired off by book’s end, leaving us to assume that things proceed happily ever after, but Feist doesn’t linger around examining the aftermath.
Meh.Maybe I'm misremembering, but when I read Magician I thought Feist's writing was pretty decent, if heavy on fantasy tropes (some of which I'm sure he helped create).
I know the advice can be overused, but in this case I think Feist would have been well-served by being beaten about the head with a sign reading "SHOW DON'T TELL."All of that said, I never actively disliked the book while I was reading it.
You do have to give this guy credit for some pretty epic world building, but I think that novelty faded fast after Magician.
The final book of the Riftwar Saga brings all the threads together and weaves a seamless ending of multi-level conflicts filled with dramatic and emotional power.This ending was a relief after witnessing some really terrible endings recently (Here's looking at you JKR and Netflix)...
I'm not deducting a star for this, it seems to me to be a cultural issue rather than anything else, and JKR suffers the same lack of vision on this topic.That said, Feist is in the same league as Tolkien, Wurts, and Erikson.
If you love Epic Fantasy, you can't go past Mr. Feist's books.
Not one strong female in the entire series. After reading the entire Wheel of Time series (where strong females grace every storyline) last year I wandered off to see more of the fantasy genre. Sadly I will not be reading anymore Feist. I loved the fast pace but hated the sexism. The main women in the storyline are always beautiful and never have anything helpful to say. They are always badgering the male characters.Like another reviewer I don't believe it was done maliciously, it just seemed to never occur to the writer. A tragedy.
I found this is very satisfying last book in a series (within a series).
The Riftwar Saga is home to some of my all time favourite characters and even the ones I just kinda liked rather than adored all had their place and contributed to my enjoyment of this book.
I'm so happy not to be experiencing the series hangover I often get at the end of a great trilogy since there are still many series within a series waiting to be read :) I've heard nothing but good things about The Empire Trilogy so I'm very excited to get into that soon.
“They were images of terrible beauty, magnificent beings of astonishing power, in armor of bright color and splendid form, riding upon the backs of ancient dragons.”   The Enemy is here! Quests, magic, intrigues, passion, mystery, and revenge culminate in an explosive battle to close out the Rift War Tetralogy. Did I mention the DRAGONS?After four books this was a real first pump of an ending! And there are thirty more books!“Then we can celebrate. Damn me, but if we don’t have a reason, no one

It's a vast adventure storyline which is all about defeating 'the bad guy' and there's a lot of questing, fighting and mystery which makes it interesting, but also fairly standard in terms of Classic Fantasy writing.
They are once again forced to question all that they know about magic and the dimensions of reality, the fabric of time and the nature of the universe, but at points this storyline can become so extraordinary and out of this world that I found myself slightly bored by the extravagance and madness it seemed to be.In this book we get to see a lot more the the character of Arutha, Jimmy and Locklear.
It is incredibly predictable, to put it mildly.
It's like the woman who's reading it is deliberately mispronouncing every name, place, and foreign word she can.***Spoilers beyond this point***I didn't believe Arutha was dead for one second and I was annoyed that it took the other characters so long to figure it out.All of the women make me think of Gail Simone's Women in Refrigerators and the men behave exactly as their character archetype dictates that they should.Feist missed with this one; he took a kind of neat idea and made it into an incredibly boring book.

The final installment to the Riftwar Saga series contained page-turning action and most of the answers to mysteries and questions posed from earlier in the series, including a surprise twist that posed ...
more questions.
While I enjoyed reading A Darkness at Sethanon, I felt the characters gained less growth this time around, being more reactive to the harsh circumstances thrown at them on their quest to stop Murandamus.
I enjoyed reading this series and feel it provides a good solid fantasy adventure story.
This felt more like the second part of Silverthorn than an entirely separate book, but was very good. It wraps up the Rift War pretty well. The characters can still go on, as people do, but so many loose ends were tied up for me that I really appreciated it.
Finally the first series of riftwar cycle has come to an end. I really loved it and have a lot to talk about.Full review - http://randombookthought.blogspot.com...
I like a lot of things that occur in this book (Locklear's sudden jumps of character being at the top; he was my favorite character from the start, and where his arc goes in unexpected & interesting).
There is a point in this book where certain characters are caught in a "time trap," where they are sent back in time, one second per every forward second.
For my money, I feel like, if you have characters go to the dawn of time, then return, DO SOMETHING with that.
I personally felt that A Darkness at Sethanon is a very good book and a fitting end to a very good fantasy series.
The author stepped up the action quite a bit and the battle of Armengar is just amazing.
While I really enjoyed the battle scenes in the novel, I was really confused by some of the events that occur with Pug and Tomas.
Besides this little issue I thought the novel was very well written and the ending can only be described as fitting.To check out the full review click on the link below.

Perhaps this novel is a better spiritual successor to Magician than Silverthorn was, since it elaborates more closely on the events of the aforementioned.
On the other hand, Silverthorn introduced some pivotal characters and bridged the gap between Magician and A Darkness At Sethanon nicely.
Well, now that's an entirely different story...Silverthorn lacked the scope and grandeur of Magician, but A Darkness At Sethanon pushes the epic-needle into the red.
Once again, this might be considered spoiler territory so I'll refrain from going into details.The strength of the series lies in how Raymond E.
I loved Magician: Apprentice and Magician: Master, but after that, the series took a turn.
Silverthorn and A Darkness At Sethanon have a completely different feel than the Magician books.
The series should have stopped after Magician: Master.
If you're interested in reading this series, my recommendation is to definitely read the Magician books, they're really great.
Then read the first 100 pages of Silverthorn.
If you like it, you'll probably enjoy the rest of the series.
If like me, you're bored to tears, quit there, and just read the plot summaries for the last two books on Wikipedia.
:D the action scenes are on a massive epic scale with events spiralling out of control for many of the characters and nations involved!
:D The way that the converging armies all turn up to take on an enemy army that had proven itself a tough nut to crack is clever a character moment as well as an epic battle as you see how all the different characters (on the good side!
:DCharacterisation as ever is very much there along with the epic events that are portrayed!:D The ruthless nature of 'The Enemy' is revealed while at the same time many of the characters continue to grow!
Really struggled over what to rate this, and think over time it may drop to a 3/5. The characters are great, and the story interesting, but the lack of rules to the magic system made things somewhat easy in some situations. Tomas & Pugs quest got a bit weird and I felt it quite out of place with the rest of the book, Mario kart rainbow road the worst of it.
I really should have finished this sooner given how much I enjoyed both Magician and Silverthorn, but I can only blame myself for reading multiple series at once.Arutha and his party have retrieved Silverthorn and revived Anita.
I suppose you could argue that the ending was a little sugary, but I do quite like happy endings occasionally.As a whole, the Riftwar Saga is definitely worth a read if you like fantasy series, and book 3 will receive 4 stars from me.
A fitting end to the Riftwar Saga.
I have a couple of gripes involving the romanctic relationships of Martin and Locklear which seem played up in order to elicit an emotional response from the reader, but come off as somewhat ridiculous.
The chronic issue plaguing the series as a whole continues as there are yet again no well developed women characters.
I feel like Feist tried with the creation of an egalitarian warrior society where women are seen as equal to men, but the three women we meet only exist to be romantic interests for our cast of characters.
Still, depsite its shortcomings, I would recommend the series to those who enjoy fantasy.
É finalmente neste livro que desvendamos a verdade sobre o grande Feiticeiro Macros, o seu papel na guerra contra os Tsurani, a história por detrás da sua misteriosa ilha, e o porquê das manipulações que fez a algumas personagens.
Tomas ganha também muita importância, e ao longo do livro conseguimos ver o quão forte ele é, e tendo ele lutado contra a sua natureza, anteriormente, é esta que se revela tão decisiva para grandes acontecimentos.
As passagens com estas três personagens estão verdadeiramente boas e são talvez umas das minhas partes favoritas de toda a saga.
I liked the magic, some of the fighting scenes, especially the archers are well made, but I always felt like it could have been so much more, like it feels like a somewhat lite-version of most contemporary fantasy.
this makes me realize this series is probably more appropriate for young adults, than an older crowd....ConclusionOverall a good series, mainly recommended for a younger target group (young adults), and I definitely would like to read at some point in time the remaining 25 books in the world, but probably not too soon!
Just one bit I wanted to mention.
His father was a merchant, cursed by a magician about to be executed.
He began to long for death after a few centuries and started investigating stories about the man who cursed him.And to quote: "But one story kept surfacing: that three magic artifacts associated with the dead man had the power to cure, to bring peace, and finally, remove curses.
My father began at once seeking those artifacts."Does this ring any bells with anyone else?
I was quite surprised to get to that bit on the train home tonight.
Whilst the first (Magician which in the version I read contains both Master and Apprentice) was very character driven, and the second was a quest novel, and both of them contained plenty of fighting, this one is much more pre-occupied with the techniques, strategy and equipment of war with the truly frightening Murmandamus.
It would be unfair, in my view, to say that Feist loses sight of his characters in his descriptions of the war - he's far too balanced for that - there is just too much of the fighting in this novel for it to be quite as interesting to me and, perhaps, others of his female audience.
