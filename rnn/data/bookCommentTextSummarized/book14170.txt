It's rare that I read non-fiction.
It's just not my bag.That said, this is one of the most fascinating books I've ever read.
I'm guessing I've brought it up hundreds of times in conversation.It's written by a neurologist who works with people who have stranger-than-usual brain issues.
And not only are the cases interesting, but the way he writes about the people invovled is really lovely.
loving, I would say.
It's interesting to see someone who obviously knows a lot of hard-line science write about these cases in terms that seem to me more suited to someone who would be a philosopher or a spiritualist.Amazing book.
Dear Dr. Sacks, On page 112 of the paperback edition of your book, the second paragraph begins with the following sentence:"And with this, no feeling that he has lost feeling (for the feeling he has lost), no feeling that he has lost the depth, that unfathomable, mysterious, myriad-levelled depth which somehow defines identity or reality."I've read this sentence at least twelve times, and I still don't even have the slightest inkling of what the hell it means.
However, Dr. Sacks seems to give his readers too much credit when he throws off "hyperagnosia", "Korsokovian", and "meningioma" like he assumes we had read an entire neurology textbook before picking this one up.

Despite so many people recommending this book, my high expectations were disappointed.
Yes, it's perversely interesting to hear about neurological conundrums that afflict people in peculiar ways, but Sacks isn't a particularly good writer, nor does he have a good grasp on his audience.
To quote a friend in college, it's his own "mental masterbation"--he likes to show off how well-read he his, how many bizarre patients have been referred to him (or he's God's gift to them) and erudite his vocabulary is, but fails to clearly get his points across.
What a coincidence that I had just read Forrest Gump, the story of a fictional “idiot savant” before coming across real life idiot savants in the pages of this book.One particular comment by the author –  “The power of music, narrative and drama is of the greatest practical and theoretical importance” , pleasantly surprised me.
I wouldn’t have expected this from a doctor, but maybe I shouldn’t have been surprised because the author did show his preference for a humane (for the lack of a better word) treatment of the patients.One problem you might encounter while reading the book is that the narrative is full of medical jargon.
Through entering the worlds of a number of "limited" individuals, Sacks reveals the brain's (and therefore the individual's) remarkable ability to overcompensate for cognitive deficiencies.
Sacks explores the varying cognitive expressions of his patients without coming across as cold, sterile, or objectifying.
Rather, he devotes a chapter to each individual case, creating in the reader a sense that they are engrossed in a series of fictional character studies, rather than a dry psychological manual or the surface-level observations and blind assumptions of a pompous intellectual.
Yet he still functioned as a music school teacher and sang or hummed his way through his daily life to keep himself on some sort of track.Other cases include phantom limbs (gone but still painful), limbs that are perceived as foreign (it’s somebody else’s leg in my bed, doctor, and when I try to throw it out, I end up on the floor), and a woman who had completely lost her proprioception – which is our sense of where our body is in space (a common failing of drunks, but not to this extent).
من أجمل ما قرأت في هذه السنة. لقد غيّر هذا الكتاب الكثير من المفاهيم الخاصة بالذاكرة عندي. كما تغيّرت عندي مفاهيم أخرى تتعلق بحالات الجنون والاكتئاب والحالات النفسية.هذا الكتاب ليس كتاباً طبياً، أو نفسياً، أو تجارياً. بل هو كتاب إنساني بالمقام الأول.هل تعرف قيمة ذاكرتك أيها الإنسان؟ هل تعرف قيمة حياتك بلا ذاكرة؟ بنصف ذاكرة؟ بربع ذاكرة؟ بذاكرة قديمة؟ هل تعرف لماذا يتصرف بعض الأشخاص أحياناً بصورة تجعلنا نظن بأنهم مجانين؟ وأخيراً.. هل تعرف كم فاتك إن لم تكن قرأت هذا الكتاب بعد؟
The book is a collection of case studies on Dr. Sacks's patients with neurological disorders.
In one chapter titled "The Twins", Sacks describes a pair of twins who had the ability to factor large numbers in their heads, so much so that they could calculate the date of any day of the week in history.
In another chapter, Sacks relates how a previously healthy patient woke up one morning convinced that the leg lying in his bed was not his.
My only complaint is that although Sacks includes a postscript to most of the chapters to explain further studies or new discoveries that occurred after he first met these patients, there is often no resolution to these stories.

The Man who Mistook His Wife for a Hat is a book about people with neurological disorders centred on issues with perception and understanding the world.
And, like the title suggests, one involves a man who mistook his wife for a hat in his inability to accurately perceive people and his utter confusion regarding objects.
When this was published Sacks addressed some rather odd disorders but now, over thirty years later, this book is less shocking as many of these conditions have been normalised to an extent.
The Man who Mistook His Wife for a Hat is a mere curiosity, nothing more.
In this book Dr. Sacks discusses patients whose brain malfunctions cause a variety of 'maladies' including: a musician who lost the ability to see faces or recognize familiar objects; a former sailor who believed the year was permanently 1945; a man who thought his leg belonged to someone else; and other unusual afflictions.
The Man Who Mistook His Wife For A HatDr. P was a talented musician and music teacher whose problems began when he lost the ability to see people's faces - though he could recognize them by their voices and movements.
*****The Lost MarinerIn 1975, Dr. Sacks saw Jimmie G - a 49-year-old man who left the Navy in 1965 after serving for more than two decades.

ومن هنا جاءت تسمية الكتاب (الرجل الذي حسب زوجته قبعة) ، ولمعرفة السبب والتفاصيل أدعوكم لقراءة الكتابالكتاب يتناول مجموعة من الاضطرابات العصبية الغريبة و النادرة، مشروحة بطريقة مبسطة سهلت الفهم ...
ولأنني أملك خلفية/اهتمامات طبية لم أجد الكتاب معقداً وكان أشبه بالمراجعة، وأعتقد أن الكتاب في متناول الجميع بكافة المستوياتالكتاب مُقسَّم لأربعة أقسام، كل قسم يتناول مجموعة من الحالات المرضية مشروحة بطريقة قصصية ولكنها تشترك في صفة أساسية اختارها المؤلف كعنوان للقسمالقسم الأول: عن "الفقد" ...
يتكلم عن الاضطرابات التي تؤدي إلى فرط "زيادة" إحدى وظائف الجسم القسم الثالث: عن "قدرة التخيُّل والذاكرة" ...
الاضطرابات التي أدت إلى مضاعفة قدرة التخيل والذاكرة للمرضى (استمتعت بهذا الفصل كثيراً)القسم الرابع: "عالم السُّذَّج" ...
كتاب ممتع ينصح بقراءته إذا تمكن القارئ من التعامل مع المادة العلمية التي تطغى أحياناً، وتمكن من التغاضي عن هنّات الترجمة التي قد تعكر مزاجه أحياناً.مراجعة لمن لديهم الوقت الكافي والمزاج المناسب: حكايات متنوعة لحالات مرضية تتنوع مابين العته، فقدان الحواس، فقدان الذاكرة والعديد من الاعتلالات النادرة والغريبة.
هل ضايقتني الترجمة لدرجة أن أتوقف عن القراءة؟ لا.لاحظت أن بعض الحالات ألهمت أفلاما سنمائية رائعة مثل حالة التخلف الذي يصاحبه قدرات عددية خارقة فلم (Rain Man)، التوحد المصحوب بولع شديد بالألغاز (Mercury Rising)، و عدم القدرة على تمييز الوجوه (Faces in the Crowd)، الزهايمر (Still Alice) أما أفلام فقدان الذاكرة فلا حصر لها.أبرز فكرتيّن خرجت بهما من الكتاب:1- أن بعض العلل تبدو ذات منشأ نفسي وهي في الحقيقة أمراض عصبية عضوية لا شأن له بالحالة النفسية.2-أن الإعاقة العصبية التي لاتظهر أعراضها للعيان تسبب معاناة مضاعفة للمصابين بها حيث أنها لا تنبئ الناس من حول المريض بأنه مصاب بشيء ما.
I went back to the basics, took Neuroanatomy and Neuroscience courses, aced them and I became yet another fan of neurology!!!🌟 The human brain is one of the most intriguing things ever and is also one of the biggest mysteries of the universe, and although our understanding of it is way better than decades ago, we still haven’t scratched the surface –at least for me-.🌟 The disorders this book includes are interesting as the man who mistook his wife for a hat literally, Phantom limbs in which people can feel pain and sensations in their amputated limbs, Seizures that made a man has super smelling, the twins who can’t do simple arithmetic but can tell you how many sticks are stacked together just by a simple glance and more!!
بعد قراءة أكثر من200 صفحة من الكتابأى ما يقرب من ثلثيهأتوقف وأقرر قراءة النسخة الانجليزية الأصلية في وقت لاحق*ما لي أنا وترجمة تصير العدوى فيها اخماج وال cranium قحف؟؟!!*
This is an utterly fascinating book, a collection of case studies by psychologist Oliver Sacks, presented in an eminently readable style.
These studies deal with the most extraordinary mental conditions, often arising from damage to the brain, from the title case where a man in full charge of his faculties is unable to identify the purpose of any object (thus his mistaking his wife for a hat) to individuals who, again otherwise wholly reasonable, will deny ownership of one of their limbs.This isn't presented as a freak show.
Each person is shown as an individual demanding our respect and sympathy.
Review to come. This was a hard one to rate. Lots of 5 star sections but some needless academic jargon, particularly in the introductions to sections. I can see why this is considered a classic. Such fascinating case histories. The brain is truly a mysterious thing.
I read this book years ago and maybe Sacks was a more skilled doctor than writer but a lot will depend on why you're reading this book to begin with.
I felt, still do, that Dr. Sacks humanised his patients and that's not necessarily easy given the subject.
The brain has such layers of complexity that are not fully understood.
Sacks attempts to issue clarity on the matter, no pun meant, it could happen to you or a loved one~ trauma, a stroke, lasting or transient confusion.
To have someone in your corner looking for a solution was comforting.
Yine bir Sacks şaheseri. fizyoloji ve psikoloji arasındaki bağı ortaya koyarken hem bu kader sade hem de bu kadar teknik olmayı nasıl başarıyor hayranım doğrusu. Bir gerilim filminden bile daha etkileyici hikayeleri sıralarken güzel de bir çerçeve çiziyor; önce kayıplardan sonra aşırılıklardan bahsedip en sonunda basit olmanın değeri ve güzelliğini vurguluyor. Müzik matematik ve doğa...işte tüm ihtiyacımız, tüm müştereğimiz bu :))
[English / Arabic review]الريفيو العربي بعد الريفيو الإنجليزي " Is there any 'place' in the world for a man who is like an island, who cannot be accultured, made part of the main? Can 'the main' accommodate, make room for, the singular? " That was the main inquiry of this insightful, compassionate, moving and Remarkable book.. the lucidity and power of a gifted writer.A wonderful book … full of wonder, wonders and wondering. Sacks brings to these often unhappy people understanding, sympathy, and
" what sort of a life (if any), what sort of a world, what sort of a self, can be preserved in a man who has lost the greater part of his memory and, with this, his past, and his moorings in time?
The world keeps disappearing, losing meaning, vanishing - and they must seek meaning, make meaning, in a desperate way, continually inventing, throwing bridges of meaning over abysses of meaningless, the chaos that yawns continually beneath them.You read about people drowning in an ocean of sounds, about 'mental diplopia', about the possessed, this woman who, becoming everybody, lost her own self, became nobody.
This book isn't easy to review, because it's not a novel, or short story collection; it's not poetry, or essays.
My interest in psychology, which will hopefully be my future career, is what led me to pick up this book.
Sacks has a truly wonderful ability to make his writing accessible, while not for a moment relinquishing the jargon he needs to use or 'dumbing down' the studies for general consumption.
It's an amazing book that showing the extraordinary capabilities of the human mind and psyche and the extent to which, despite all of our advancements in science, we know very little about one of our body's most important organs.

Nörolojik çarpıcı vakaları anlatan kitap cidden çok etkileyiciydi. Kurgu olmayan roman tarzında bir çok önemli bilgi içeren bir kitaptı. İnsana yaşadığı her anın ne kadar değerli olduğunu hissettiriyor kitaptaki olayları yaşayan hastalar. Etkileyiciydi.
Over the course of his long career as a neurologist, Sacks has had plenty of interesting cases.
Sacks is at his best when he's describing the most unusual quirks.
Huh?Some may say that the more we understand of brain mechanics, cause and effect, chemical reactions, and modelable outcomes, the less room there is for things like free will and human spirit.
(Thanks, Susan, for your thoughts prompting this topic.)A book like this that helps us understand how the brain functions by showing how a damaged brain malfunctions still leaves a lot that's unexplained.
في الفص الأيسر سيُلاحظ الخلل على الفور من قبل المريض قبل غيره !
فهو إما سيفقد القدرة على الحركة \ الكلام \ السمع، أو حتى يحصل خلل واضح في العمليات الروتينية اليومية التي يعرف بها المريض تماماً أنه هُنالك شيئاً خاطئاً في جسدة ..
الأمر المُرعب الذي يعرضه هذا الكتاب هو “ ماذا لو حدث خلل في الفص الأيممن ؟ “ ..
هنا أتى الدكتور أوليفر ساكس وأعطانا عدة أمثله عجيبه عن ماقد يحدث لو فقد أو اضطرب عمل الفص الأيمن من الدماغ أو بعضُ منه ..
أو حتى الأسوأ من هذا قد تفقد القدرة على التحكم بجسدك تماماً لتضطر أن “تراه” لتعرف أن تحركه !
L’uomo che scambiò sua moglie per un cappello è un saggio che racchiude al suo interno alcuni casi di pazienti con problemi neurologici che Oliver Sacks, medico, chimico, scrittore e accademico, ha incontrato nel corso dei suoi anni.Il libro si divide in diverse sezioni: Perdite (in cui Sacks parla di pazienti che appunto hanno perso qualcosa: la capacità di vedere gli oggetti e/o il volto, la memoria, la propriocezione…); Eccessi (in questo caso si assiste quasi al contrario: immaginatevi, per esempio, tutti quei disturbi con il suffisso «iper» davanti); Trasporti (in questi capitoli possiamo leggere di come il cervello possa portare alla nostra coscienza ricordi olfattivi o musicali che non pensavamo di avere) e infine, Il mondo dei semplici i cui protagonisti sono persone considerate idiots savants e/o persone autistiche.Questo è un libro che può essere letto sia da persone che hanno una base medica (psicologi, psichiatri, neurologi) ma anche da chi non ce l’ha.
Our senses take in all of the information we use and it is the brain that takes that information and puts it into, what we think is, normal perspective.
Cases here are different.
We depend on our brains to take in information constantly and translate that information into something useful to us; something that reflects reality.
His brain tells him everything is right as he experiences it.
Those around him tell him different.
Your brain tells you one thing those around you say different.
Perhaps one of the most terrifying, but completely real, books I have read.
حقا الذي وصف هذا الكتاب بانه الف ليلة وليله في الامراض وفي الحياة صدقهذا الكتاب دون شك من اعجب واغرب
