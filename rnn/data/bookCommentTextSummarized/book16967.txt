Ever read a story out loud to a friend -- knowing it's not the kind of story they'd read on their own?I do that all the time (even snippets of novels to give them a taste).
I read "Crouch End" out loud to one of my sisters, in a weird Scotts/English accent that I tend to use when reading Lovecraftian horror.
I was afraid to go to the bathroom after reading this book.
Nightmares & Dreamscapes is the 7th Stephen King book I've read this year.
Nightmares & Dreamscapes is a collection of short stories.
Rainy Season - Another peculiar little town and another story of people not listening to warnings.Sorry, Right Number - I'm told this teleplay was for Tales From The Darkside and I plan on finding it so I can watch it.Nightmares & Dreamscapes is Stephen King at his most playful.
I know I'm in the minority but I love playful and funny King.
Here’s a little fact you’ll see this if you read the intro of this book: “7 years between Night Shift and Skeleton Crew.
(King says later that “his favorite sort of short story has always been the kind where things happen just because they happen.” The perfect example is displayed right here.) You Know They Got a Hell of a Band - I mention this one, not because it’s that good, but because it just may be King’s own personal dream-nightmare in written form.
King comes up with a pretty good tale here that puts Watson in the forefront, not that he can overshadow Holmes in the end.PS.
The variety of stories in this collection is insane, it goes from vampires to baseball to chattery teeth to fingers crawling out of the drain in your sink.
My favourites were Chattery Teeth, You Know They Got A Hell of A Band, The Moving Finger, Rainy Season and Popsy.
I overall got the point of the story and enjoyed that, but it was wasted on me.
The Fifth Quarter was also not a highlight for me, it was okay, but no doubt I'll have forgotten about it in a few weeks.Overall an enjoyable read, a great variety of stories.
this is where the little pop-ups next to those stars really feel misleading.
do i like that i still sometimes fear the toilet?
also, i peed a little and had to call my mom in the middle of the night.some people just read king and get on with life.
some people still don't step on cracks because Something Bad Will Happen and those people know that king is telling stories that are just shy of really coming true.

(I think that's the first time I've used the word "marvelous" in a review and I regret nothing.) And then you have absolutely horrible narration brought to you by Yeardley Smith (Lisa Simpson's voice on the Simpsons) whose performance is laughable because of who she sounds like by default (the story she narrates is good, but it's brought down a whole star by her goofy-ass voice), and Joe Mantegna, who completely phoned in his performance; his child voices are the worst I've heard.
Classic master of horror Stephen King delivers to us readers on a silver platter creepy short stories that make us not want to go to sleep! No wonder I have been having restless nights while reading this book! Personal favorites are: Dolan's Cadillac, The Night Flier, Chattery Teeth, The Moving Finger, and The House on Maple Street. For readers that want farfetched, strange, creepy, weird, crazy, out of this world stories, then look no further than this book. For Stephen King fans this is a "must have" book for your collection! Giving it five stars for keeping me "creeped" out!
Stephen King is my comfort read when I'm feeling stressed or just need to relax. I love this collection and am looking forward to delving into it once more.
3.5Another King short story collection read and Night Shift still remains number one as far as I’m concerned!.Nightmares and Dreamscapes started off SUPER strong but then I found that my ratings were petering down to 3s and 2s and even a couple of 1s, whereas I only gave 5 stars to one story in the whole collection, Suffer the Little Children.
But other highlights were Dolan’s Cadillac, The Night Flier, The Ten O’Clock People, The Moving Finger, Chattery Teeth, and Crouch End..Horror lends itself so well to short stories, and King says this himself, because nothing needs to be explained in a short story.
There simply is a moving finger in your drain.
The audio book version of NIGHTMARES AND DREAMSCAPES is just fantastic.
Really cool stories with famous people narrating, like Grace Slick, Rob Lowe, Tim Curry, Jerry Garcia, and others.
For such a big collection, I thought the majority of the stories were very good.
I thought it was rather odd that King included his true-life baseball account, HEAD DOWN in this book.
Another odd detail regarding the "live" version of N.A.D., is that until fairly recently it was only available on cassette tapes.
Even now, the stories have been divided up and sold with just 4 tales to a CD.
This is one King book that I will have to replace when it finally collapses in tatters from overuse.The thing I love about this book is that in most of the short stories, there is no reason for the events to occur- they just DO.
There is no reason for dead rock and roll legends to congregate in a town in the middle of nowhere, trap living victims, and force them to listen to concerts that sometimes go for "a year or more"- but only last one night.
Now the individual stories:Dolan's Cadillac- A great tale of revenge on a mobster by a grieving teacher.
4/5The Night Flier- A superb Vampire tale.
One of my favorite short horror story.
Great story.
4/5Dedication-A strange, strange story about a mother's love and good genes.
5/5Rainy Season- A great amphibian tale.
5/5My Pretty Pony-a strange tale of a grandfather bonding with his grandson.
5/5Crouch End-A Lovecraftian tale.
4/5The Doctor's Case-A great Sherlock Holmes story..but it's really about watson.
But I'll be fair its a good short story.
It certainly makes me want to read the other two anthologies.
The only reason it doesn't get five stars from me is because of Head Down, which I could not bear to read this time.
I recall being disappointed that it was the last thing in the book the first time around, and having to struggle through it.
Maybe I should give it another go but, for now, there are too many other books and stories to read.
My favorites in this collection are (in no particular order) Chattery Teeth, The Moving Finger, Crouch End, The Night Flier, Popsy, and Umney's Last Case.
Umney's Last Case is probably one of my all time favorite King stories.
I bought the book thinking that, perhaps, the stories would be aimed at more psychological/dream-like horrors, but instead you get a very random collection of short stories that make the title simply something to grab the eye.King has his fair share of horror in here but there is also some metaphysical stuff, a straight up caper-esque story, a Sherlock Holmes mystery, and, to make nightmares and dreamscapes even more of a strange title, a 50+ page non-fiction piece on Little League baseball.Overall, a fun collection of stories, just wildly different and all over the place.Here is a run down:"Dolan's Cadillac" **** out of **** A man wants to get revenge on the man who killed his wife and the key is the man's beautiful Cadillac and a hole in the earth"The End of the Whole Mess" **1/2 A man's brother, with good intentions, may have doomed the planet"Suffer the Little Children" **1/2 A story of a teacher encountering true evil in her junior high classroom."The Night Flier" *** A tabloid trash reporter starts tailing, by plane, a serial killer who may just be beyond human."Popsy" *** A man in heavy debt abducts children for a crime boss.
Previously read in both 'Nightmares & Dreamscapes' and the 'Wastelands' anthology. Still worth the third read!Told as a dying man's last confession and testament; the reader learns what did the world in: an unprecedented discovery, and a well-meaning attempt to save humanity from our own worst natures. As it has been said, 'fools rush in where angels fear to tread,' and, blinded by hubris, a genius researcher failed to correlate the damning data before it was too late...
Avg. Rating 3.76A pretty good book, with a mix of different kinds of stories. Most of the stories were enjoyable. None of them were unlikable, but a couple of 'em were just okay or slow.***** 4 stories**** 10 tales*** 5 stories** 2 talesSome brilliant ideas in here; a few with flaws here and there, yet interesting enough.Recommended indeed.
This was my first try of reading short stories. since it was of Stephen king I couldn't wait. well,this book is sort of amazements. Imagining stories to scare people I think is a very difficult task. You have to create new things out of thin air and make it look dangerous. I am a sort of novel person so I will give this book 4 star.
Extremely short story, finished it in fifteen minutes, re-read it immediately :)Reminded me a bit of Gaiman's Feeders & Eaters4-solid-packs-punch-like-an-ouzo-shot-stars

This was a great selection for my Halloween short story spree. I wouldn't consider it among the best of King's work, but it was still top notch. Every time I read one of his books I tell myself I really need to read all his books. My favorites in this collection are: Dolans Cadillac, Crouch End and The Night Flyer. It's not perfect but better than a 4, so I'll give it a 4.5.
Another great find from my local used bookstore.Last read when it was first published; looked forward to re-reading!

Loved this book! My two favorite stories in it are Dolan's Cadillac and The Night Flier. It's well worth checking out.
Este es el tercer libro que leo de King y debo decir que, aunque me gustaron mucho los relatos, prefiero sus novelas, por ahora.
Es una gran antología, los relatos no decepcionan pero esperaba que fueran más escalofriantes, no son terroríficos pero aún así son muy buenos cuentos.
Mis favoritos fueron: El dedo móvil, Las zapatillas, Parto en cada, El final del desastre y Hay que aguantar a los niños.
La introducción del libro es fascinante, leer a King reflexionar sobre la escritura y la literatura es genial, también las notas sobre cada cuento son muy interesantes, para enterarnos un poco más sobre la composición y las ideas detrás de cada uno
I've come to like the shorter versions of King infinitely better than the longer ones.. Found this one incredibly well-written and creepy.
This is a great collection of stories.
I loved the Twilight Zone feel of a lot of these stories.
right.
As much as I want to, I'm not going to review each story in this book.
But here's my list of the stories, in preference order.
