Update - The show was fantastic- best I've seen in London!I’m off to London today to see this on stage. I am so, very, very excited.As much as I love the Disney film version, nothing quite compares to live theatre. And although this little book here is a faithful rendition, it could never capture the majesty of the story on page. Without music this falls terribly flat. Today is going to be fun.
Love it <3الكرتون دا ليـه ذكريـات حلوة اوى معايا :))كنت بحبه اوى ومازلت ^^بيجي عليـا وقت بيكون نفسى اتفرج علي افلام كرتون الى كنت بشوفها وانا صغيرة وبحس بسعادة غريبة وقتهاحبيت ^^
The Lion King (Hardcover) by Justine Korman Fontes Being brave doesn't mean you go looking for trouble, Simba.What a story!
Walt Disney's classic story of the The Lion King is set on the continent of Africa.
The Lion King is a great cultural book that can be enjoyed by from all ages.
The images are very clear and really speak on their own.As well as being a great read, children are also able to get alot out of this book, educationally.
Geography - Children to learn about Africa and their rainforests and its climate.
Children to compose a piece of music for a chosen section of the book.Art - Children to produce an African rainforest picture using paint.
A beautifully illustrated book about a lion cub growing up wanting to know more about the world beyond his reach, but soon finds that his curiosity leads him into trouble.
Unknown to him his uncle is trying to overthrow the King (the cub's father), blamed for his father's death the cub runs away and finds himself with new friends who he grows up with.
He takes back what was once his to be and takes over the land as the new Lion King.It is a story that can be read to children from year 1 to year 3.
IT IS THE BEST BOOK EVER AND YOU NEED TO WATCH IT. IITT IISS AAMMAZZIINNGG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I LOVE THIS BOOK...this is one of my childhood books That I can carry on generations..If anyone has any younger siblings this is the book to read to them & show the movie. Even though it's a child book I do think that it's a book to remember thoughout your life. The movies brings the visual too.If i was an grade school teacher this would be one of the books I would read to the kids.
Great story told for kids by Little Golden Books, the people to go to for well written books with amazing illustrations that make all kids smile and learn to love reading
A patrimonial succession struggle among a pack of lions causes the animal denizens of the Pride Lands to suffer immensely. Down with the monarchy! More importantly, enough death and destruction to keep the children entertained.
One night Simba’s dad the lion king known as Mufasa takes him to a spot and sits Simba down and tells him that wherever the light touches will be his kingdom some day.
Then Simba goes to the dark place with his friend where they almost get killed by hyenas but then Mufasa saves them.
Mufasa is Simbas dad and the current lion king.
As the story progresses Mufasa tries to teach Simba more about being a king when our next character kills Mufasa.
Scar in this story wants to be king but can not be because of Simba and Mufasa.
The book and movie broke my heart since I was a little child but I love it so much
The Lion King, by Justine Fontes and Don Williams, is the classic story of Simba, Mufasa, Scar, Timon and Pumba.
There is evil hyenas and Mufasa's brother who is a evil lion who wants to take over the land.
I read these books in a series called The Golden Books, which are short and picture book versions of the movie that was released in 1999.
It is a book that gets you emotionally attached and makes you feel for the Simba when his dad died.
I really am attached to the authors style and will continue reading her books as my reviews.
Children have loved LITTLE GOLDEN BOOKS years. They have written their names inside each front cover and pored cover over the colorful pictures.
i watched it as a movie and it was amazing ^_^ childhood memories ^_^
I Love Simba .. So Cute !!!!

This is a great adaption of the classic Disney film, The Lion King.
The author/adaptor of this book made the story in the film simpler and easier for children to understand.
It is a fairly short book version of the movie.
It leaves out much of the story and only focuses on the main details of the film.
I enjoyed how the author explained some of the details (i.e., the circle of life) so the children reading this book can understand what they are.
Also, this book would be great for children that love disney movies and especially love The Lion King.
This book is about a young lion cub, who learns where he belongs, after a journey with two friends he meets along the way. In they end he finds that his place is the Leader of his Pride.This book is geared towards preschool age because it is mostly pictures.I gave this book a four star rating because I Love the lion king, and it has a fun story-line.
While I appreciate the fact that these Disney Golden Books are thorough in retelling the movie plotlines, they are too long to read aloud comfortably to children. Perhaps they could break up the tales in more than one book.
This book follows Sima and his father Mufasa. After Simba's uncle is jealous of his brother he wants to take away the throne from Mufasa. After trying to lure them into a stampede, Mufasa dies, but Simba escapes. Simba returns to take back his fathers homeland from Scar.
Cute book for young children! Loved the tie in.
cute story

THE LION KING, GUYS! It was my favourite movie in my childhood and I was so happy to find this book and read it again! Awwwww...I just love the story.

I cried so hard on Mufasas death, I felt the love of Simba and Nala and I enjoyed the HAKUNA MATATA-philosophy of Timon and Pumba. I will definetly read this to my kids, if Ill ever

I love thee book and the movie sooo mush
The young cub runs away and is raced by a warthog and his friend, meanwhile his uncle takes over the lions and nearly destroys the kingdom.
When the lion cub grows up and comes back he fights with his uncle and take his place as the rightful king.
I gave this book 5 stars because of how courageous a story it is, it is folklore, but it is something that is so cool, you want it to be real.
It is appealing to kids because the lions have there own life and that is cool to them.
