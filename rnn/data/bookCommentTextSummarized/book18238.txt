And to the Elle Kennedy Off-Campus Formula?***Done.
And not OTT "let's fucking out-tragedy each other issues," but REAL LIFE issues that occur or are occurring in real people's lives (OUR lives) everyday.
Also, another awesome round of applause to Ms. Kennedy for the anti-slut shaming agenda that arose (pun absolutely erected) in this story.
I'm sooooo fucking excited for Tuck's book that I can't even stand it.So long story short, this is an AWESOME installment to what has become one of my favorite all time series.
If you love sports romance, mature NA, the above mentioned "formula" and haven't read this series yet?
5 stars!
It’s very rare that I read a series with 3 books and all 3 are equally fantastic and solid 5+ star reads for me.
When starting The Score I was a little nervous it wouldn't live up to all the hype.
I loved the first two books in this series so hard, I could only hope this was as good.
I think The Mistake is still my favorite because, well… Logan.
But honestly, this was just as good as The Deal for me and solid 5 star read!
Dean and Allie are two characters we’ve known and loved since bo
It’s very rare that I read a series with 3 books and all 3 are equally fantastic and solid 5+ star reads for me.
I loved the first two books in this series so hard, I could only hope this was as good.
Dean and Allie are two characters we’ve known and loved since book one.
And just maybe this girl won’t want anything to do with Dean Di Laurentis after one night.
I didn’t think there would be so much to Dean, but there absolutely was.
I loved how she didn’t easily give into Dean and his ways like all the other girls on campus seem to.
I loved The Deal and didn’t think it would be possible to top it, but The Score, OMG!
So yeah, I guess it’s time for Snoopy and the happy dance.
Really, I’m in love, so back off ladies, Dean is mine.
In. Love with HIM.But Dean isn’t the only great thing that makes this book wonderful, Allie as a heroine is kickass too, plot is fabulous and I loved catching up with the whole bunch.
his book might be… interesting.
So yeah, keep that shit up Elle Kennedy because you are doing a fine job.
But Dean's life became a lot more interesting when Allie Hayes, Hannah's best friend, came to stay over at their house one night to avoid her ex-boyfriend who want to get back with her.
I knew where she was coming from and I could understand why she would feel that way.But the best thing about this book is how you get to see Dean and Allie fall for each other.
It's so rare to read a book that actually shows the hero and heroine fall for one another in a series of moments instead of just being told that they are in love.
5 Stars  I kiss him back hungrily, helpless to resist him.
Dean Di Laurentis is in my blood now.
I didn't expect this intense sexual chemistry between us, but it's here, and it's addictive, and I don't know how I can ever give it up.
You know when you read the first book in a series and you love it so much that you don't think anything can top it, but then you read the second and you love it just as much?
So then you know that the chances of that continue to hold for the 3rd book are slim, righ
And considering how much I loved the previous two books, that's saying something.Now let's be real here; considering how much I love me my manwhores, it was already a good chance I'd love Dean Di Laurentis.
He may be the hard partying manwhore with a crass sense of humor, but beneath that perfect exterior there's so much more to him and you really get to see it blossom here.Allie Hayes is Hanna's best friend that just recently broke up with her long term boyfriend of 3 years.
While I loved the slow building romance between Dean and Allie, what kept me turning the pages was the banter between them and the rest of the guys.
*****4.5 STARS*****{ARC Generously Provided by Author in Exchange For an Honest Review} Elle Kennedy definitely has another HIT on her hands with this one. The OFF CAMPUS series delivers the HOTTEST Hockey Players, panty melting scenes, and laugh out loud moments as well. Each guy is pretty cocky and gorgeous, but never do they come off as narcissistic pricks.Dean Di Laurentis is a serious PLAYER. He enjoys sex and is a serious exhibitionist as well. He also doesn’t have any desire to be in a se
The one time he attempted to be in a relationship ended disastrously and several years later he is still haunted by the past.Allie Hayes is Hannah’s best friend and roommate.
But as they start to spend more time together, feelings begin to develop and pretty soon they question whether there might be something more than just sex between them.
Dean is pretty insatiable and I guarantee that you will either be taking a few cold showers, attacking your man, or spending some quality time with your Winstons.This book releases on Jan 11th and I know you’re all going to fall in love with this story and Dean!!
Once again, Elle has taken a common new adult formula and made it fresh, fun and highly entertaining. A no-excuses manwhore and Ms. Relationship come together, resulting in sizzling chemistry and hilarious verbal sparring. The Score  was a wonderful story, one that had me smiling and a bit misty eyed, a perfect combination of heart-warming romance and light-heart humor, all surrounding realistic college life. Dick Shot Dean gets a book!I can't wait ;)*ARC provided in exchange for an honest review*
FIVE MAN WHORE STARS. Maybe it’s time to stop focusing on scoring…and shoot for love. This series has well and truly got me wrapped around its little finger. If I could reproduce the feelings I have when reading one of the books in this particular series, then my happiness levels would be set for life. Talk about sweeping me off my feet, this hero has gone and made himself my favourite out of all Elle Kennedy's boys; no small feat let me tell you, this author has a particularly wonderful talent
Talk about sweeping me off my feet, this hero has gone and made himself my favourite out of all Elle Kennedy's boys; no small feat let me tell you, this author has a particularly wonderful talent of making her men irresistible.
Elle Kennedy really does have an incredibly special talent at making me fall in love with her words and you would have be insane if you didn't find something to love about this reformed man whore and his sassy counterpart.
Final thoughts ...There should not be a single romance reading addict left on the planet who hasn't started this series.
ANOTHER WINNER!!!When you break up with your long-term boyfriend what exactly are your options? DEAN DI LAURENTIS.  He could slap his face on a laxative label and every woman in the world would be praying for constipation just to have an excuse to buy it.     My face? Turn-on. Chest? Turn-on. I’d roll over and show you my ass, but we both know the answer will be ‘turn-on’ so I’ll skip that one. Dick? Turn the fuck on. And then we get to the non-physical awesomeness that is Dean.    You make life
DEAN DI LAURENTIS.
Dean Di Laurentis fucks because he loves to fuck, and he smiles because he goddamn loves to smile.
Dean fell apart, yes.
But maybe he needed to fall apart in order to learn that life isn’t perfect, that bad things do happen and you can’t stop living when they do.
Dean is my favorite in this series.
The book contains all the elements I love in the college romance genre: a manwhore-turned-prince-charming hero, a strong and determined heroine and lots of steamy and LOL moments.
Don’t get me wrong, they really are a perfect match, but I didn’t really feel their love.
It is her best friend Allie who becomes a thorn in Dean's side at first.For Allie has finally pulled the plug on her long term on again off again relationship with Sean.
What developed was a push pull between them; Sean trying to manipulate Allie to being "the little woman supporting her man" syndrome.He wanted her to give up her dreams; never admitting she was worthy of all the success she had had...
I’m celebrating with my friends and family with a little voice inside my head saying “would these people hurry up and eat their cake…The Score is waiting”.
At first he struggles, but when push comes to shove, his intelligence, upbringing and education help him to work through the difficulties.I really enjoyed this story and loved seeing the maturity blossom in both Allie and Dean.
He didn’t plan for it to be his life and with his upbringing and loving family as a great example of what life was all about, knew there were more important things in his future.Elle Kennedy, The Score was another win for me.
HOT DAMN! LOVED IT! THE DATING GAME questions with Dean and Allie:  1. I’VE HEARD YOU ARE PERFECT, DEAN. IS THERE ANY TRUTH TO THESE RUMORS?”Yeah. I am perfect. I need to remind myself of that more often.” 2. ALLIE, PRIOR TO GETTING TO KNOW DEAN WHAT WAS YOUR IMPRESSION OF HIM? ”If I’m being honest, I’ve never known what to make of the guy. He’s cocky, flirtatious… Superficial.” 3. COULD YOU SEE YOURSELF GETTING TOGETHER WITH HIM?”He’s annoying and ridiculous and totally not my type.”4. DEAN, YO
THE DATING GAME questions with Dean and Allie: 
1. I’VE HEARD YOU ARE PERFECT, DEAN.
ALLIE, PRIOR TO GETTING TO KNOW DEAN WHAT WAS YOUR IMPRESSION OF HIM?
One last thing, Dean, how do you feel about shirts?”I don’t like shirts.” Now that you’ve gotten to know Dean and Allie a little better have fun reading about them in THE SCORE.
A lot of times the female characters can be annoying with the inner dialogue and Allie did a great job of catching herself in those moments and turning the inner babble off.
In The Score we're dealing with a friends-with-benefits-that-fall-in-love situation (which explains the graphic-and sometimes extravagant-sex scenes) between Allie, a girl who just broke up with her longterm boyfriend, and the infamous man-slut/ horndog/ sex addict Dean.
There is chase, tention, sneaking out and eventually emotions, heartbreak and problems that will affect their relationship, but Dean imprinted on Allie and he will not let her go.
But he was also brutally honest about who he was, he never lied nor gave promises he couldn't keep and I must admit I thought he'd run away when things between him and Allie got serious but no, despite his fear he didn't back down and I really admired him for that!
Dean and Allie were on fire!
The fact that there was skimming involved warrants a rounding down, BUT there were some pretty damn funny lines that make me want to round up.
Honestly, for me this felt like a repeat of book 1 and 2, just changing up the main characters names.
Seems like all of the men are reformed manwhores (really really over it), the couples want to keep their proclivities on the DL, and the hero does something stupid at the end.
I liked Dean and Allie fine.
It was entertaining enough, certainly funny, relatively low angst and pretty damn hot.
I've learned to expect the unexpected with Elle Kennedy novels which I love because the plot isn't always predictable."Ugh. You even have perfect nipples," I gripe.His lips twitch.
Normally when I read the next book in a series I'll end up loving those characters more than the first and then cycle continues.
I love the way the stories intertwine and I get to continuously read about familiar faces.
Each novel has it's own unique love story and I HIGHLY recommend reading them if you haven't so already.
Don't make me say it again.It's bad enough I said it first."The Score Elle Kennedy
Update it's now LIVE!!! 5 stars!  You know the book is a winner when you have a smile on your face the entire time you’re reading it. Considering I have loved every Elle Kennedy book I’ve read, I knew going into this book it would be a good read. What I didn’t know is that I would freaking love this book. I need to get my hands on a paperback copy so I can hug it very tightly!  The Score  begins with Allie having just broken up with her boyfriend. Knowing how easily he can worm his way back into
You know the book is a winner when you have a smile on your face the entire time you’re reading it.
What I didn’t know is that I would freaking love this book.
But in the light of day Allie doesn’t want to continue and Dean wants more.Well I don’t want to get all spoilery and tell the entire plot, so I will do my best to keep this review spoiler free like the author requested.
I also loved how for Dean and Allie they didn’t expect anything from the other, and in return they both ended up needing each other for different reasons.
No HEA:  (view spoiler)[ Yes (hide spoiler)]How much I enjoy reading Elle Kennedy ’s Off – Campus Series is indescribable.
It delivered exactly what I’ve been craving from NA and had everything I learned to expect from Kennedy’s work: great banter, hot sex scenes, swoony and touching moments and fabulous characters!
On the other hand, I am sure that every fan of Off – Campus boys will be thrilled and super excited while reading Dean and Allie’s story.
It’s good, satisfying and dirty story so be sure to check it out!FOLLOW SMOKIN HOT BOOK BLOG ON: ["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>
Update: Bonus Scene from The Score! :)https://gallery.mailchimp.com/653a5a8...---------------Dean, you're such a manwhore but I like you a lot. Especially your talented tongue... Mmmm you were so yummy! :-D My God, I freaking love this series sooo much!!! :D “It’ll be fun. Sex is always fun.”“Pass.”“Okay, no sex. How about just oral?”“Am I giving or receiving?”“Receiving. And then giving. Because that’s how it goes.” “You know, the circle of life and all that.”
It's live! http://amzn.to/1R5Pq7q5+ "I don't like shirts" Stars! To say I was a little excited to read The Score is a bit of an understatement... I mean, this is Elle Kennedy, who has proven to me she is the queen of arrogant yet completely endearing man-whores (and she's actually making me enjoy the NA genre again- which is a huge undertaking in itself). I'd met Dean Di Laurentis in The Deal and knew this self-absorbed sex-on-a-stick would give us an entertaining ride. To say this book is enter
Allie doesn't do casual sex yet she finds herself waking to a very naked Dean beside her and visions of a crazy night full of everything sexual fantasies are made of.
Dean is beyond endearing in all his humorous yet arrogant ways and combine his sexual prowess, Allie doesn't stand a chance.
But, for once, Allie wants this to be a one-time hook-up and nothing more yet Dean is not satisfied with just once.
She wants strings so that doesn't include the Dean Di Laurentis, Briar College man-whore extraordinaire.
FULL REVIEW POSTED!   4.99 "Dean+Allie+Winston"stars   "Allie am I interrupting you while you're,um...riding the solo train to Orgasmville?"  When Elle Kennedy strikes, she scores!!!With this book she out done herself! Once again showed that she's brilliant author with unique style!Despite that the words float to me like drinking mohitto in a hot summer day, I felt this book! I laughed, I cried, I was angry, I swoooned, I was happy, I felt everything and i couldn't put it down for a dear life !
Once again showed that she's brilliant author with unique style!Despite that the words float to me like drinking mohitto in a hot summer day, I felt this book!
*sigh* Plus the conversation was  HILARIOUS !“You know, I don’t think we’re dealing with a Bella’s-magical-blood situation here.”“No?”“No. I think you’ve imprinted on this girl’s pussy.”… “What do you mean?”“I mean you’re facing a Jacob quandary.
Like Jacob and that weird mutant baby.”Allie just got herself out of a toxic relationship and all she wanted was to feel free from men but then she was at Dean's house.
FULL REVIEW NOW POSTED:   “You’re going about this the wrong way, you know. The best way to get over someone is to hook up with someone else. ASAP.”“I’m not ready to be with anyone else yet.”“Sure you are. Seriously, just find yourself a rebound.” Dean whips up his arm. “I volunteer as tribute.”  Just when I thought this series could not get any better, we are given another delectable instalment in this witty, sexy, flawlessly written series about opposites attracting. We saw the cocky team cap
Born to privilege and expected to follow in his parents’ footsteps, Dean passes his college days focusing on hockey, random hook-ups, and spending time with his friends, his innate intelligence hidden behind a careless, live-in-the-moment stance on life.
But when an unexpected one-night stand turns into the greatest sexual experience of his life, Dean finds himself in uncharted territory, unable to stop thinking about the first woman in his life who’s left him craving for more.
|4.4 stars|  I have the words “I love you” on my lips.His green eyes burn with emotion. He lets out a husky groan and sags on top of me, thrusting deep one last time. Then he says, “I love you too.” Blurb: Allie Hayes is in crisis mode. With graduation looming, she still doesn’t have the first clue about what she's going to do after college. To make matters worse, she’s nursing a broken heart thanks to the end of her longtime relationship. Wild rebound sex is definitely not the solution to her p
Dean is in full-on pursuit, but when life-rocking changes strike, he starts to wonder if maybe it’s time to stop focusing on scoring…and shoot for love.Dude, I’m speechless.
*sigh* Girl, you and I came such a long way.At first I thought she was cool, you know, in book 1 when we saw her through Hannah and Garrett’s eyes but I couldn’t make much of her other than being a great friend, a fierce girl and stuck in an on-and-off relationship.
Buddyread with my amazing sis Bea (click her name to read her beautiful review) :) I knew this book will definitely bring me tons of fun times, but heck I didn't expect this installment to be this crazily good!
And then there's Allie Hayes, Hannah's (Garrett's girlfriend) best friend who also appeared in the previous books, who just broke-up with her long-term boyfriend Sean.
That's the time when she and Dean got drunk together and well, ended up screwing each other.This book is practically a friends-with-benefits kind of book, but I loved how the romance came out very developed here-- how Dean and Allie both started off as f*ck buddies which turned into something in the long run.
I've become so attached to this group, it almost feels like coming home when I get to revisit them again with in every new story.I've been waiting with bated breath for Dean's book.
But the cherry on top of the manwhore cupcake was his complete and utter reform, and his surprisingly emotional path to becoming a better man.Dean has always been portrayed as sex obsessed and simply put: only out for physical pleasure.
She turned out to be perfectly paired with Dean in several ways.
While Dean was a good time, he's not boyfriend material.
5 "Little Dean" STARSThis series is just the bomb! Elle delivers another great addition about these hockey hotties from Briar University. This was definitely a score! The third book in this series is about Dean Sebastian Kendrick Heyward-Di Laurentis, the sexy, rich, D-man of the Briar's hockey team and the unabashed manwhore. And Hannah's BFF and roommate, Allie Hayes, the sexy, sassy and smart drama major and life long nester - she only does relationships.  These two are brought together as Al
The third book in this series is about Dean Sebastian Kendrick Heyward-Di Laurentis, the sexy, rich, D-man of the Briar's hockey team and the unabashed manwhore.
And Hannah's BFF and roommate, Allie Hayes, the sexy, sassy and smart drama major and life long nester - she only does relationships.
While she goes running for the hills, Dean can't seem to shake their night of getting "jiggy" and wants another round.
And he wants to fuck Allie.
The relationship between Allie and Dean was a natural progression and even though there were bumps, all of it was real and nothing was for drama sake.
Allie isn't having any of it though, well until Tequila gets involved that is...I have to admit that I was irrationally upset that Dean wasn't going to be with Sabrina after seeing their fight in The Mistake and getting excited, thinking that they would end up together.
I think that's why I liked Dean and Allie together so much, because she grounded him and made him realize his potential while he showed her how freeing it can be to not worry over everything.

These characters are on the kinkier side they both enjoy sex and they happen to get involved in each other at a time Allie needs Dean in her life without her really knowing it.
So they end up getting drunk and end in bed together, yet Allie walks away and says NO MORE, because you know of Deans reputation.
But Dean doesn't give up he wants Allie and he's going to have her...
What I love about Elle's books are they're fun and heartwarming but you have time to get to know the characters, and by the end I felt like I KNEW THEM.
5 **tequila** STARS  “I’m Dean Di Laurentis, for fuck’s sake. I can snap my fingers and a dozen chicks appear, begging to ride my dick.”  Well, it's official I have my first book for the “best of 2016” shelf. What a gem. Hilarious, sexy and just one of those books you have to read. The hype is real and well deserved.Kudos to Ms. Kennedy. She had a very good run with the Off-Campus series so far. The Deal was one of my 2015 favorites and The Mistake was an ok read as well. But The Score and Dean
Hilarious, sexy and just one of those books you have to read.
Gives as good as she gets and doesn't take any bullshit.Allie and Dean are amazing together, the banter alone should win them prizes.
But she gets me every time with her Off-Campus series.
But it's not all laughs and good times.
Life isn't sunshine and daisies, and they are no exception no matter how blessed their lives seem sometimes.Really an amazing book and series not only for lovers of college themed romance.
***5 "You and your dirty mind" stars...*** (...for Dicky, his baby doll and her Winston!!! Bahahaha)Seriously, guys!!! Elle Kennedy have the magic pen!!!Why i'm saying this??? This series is just  AWESOME ...Plot??? AWESOME!!!Male characters??? AWESOME!!!Female characters??? AWESOME!!!Writing??? AWESOME!!!Sexy hot scenes??? AWESOME!!!Secondary characters??? AWESOME!!!Even the saddest moments are AWESOME!!!Yep, I'm addicted to this series and i'm shameless!!!!If you asked me who would be my favo
Because i would like to emphasize that usually the female characters are making something that they are pissing me off and i'm reaching to a point that i don't usually like them, but here, in this certain series, the girls are almost my favorites!!!But enough with that, i have to focus on Dean and Allie!!!Allie, as we already know, is Hannah's best friend and roommate.
The thing with Dean was so out of her character, but she liked it very much, so she couldn't back up!!!
Allie and Dean together were a hell of a couple!!!They were hot and funny and intense!!!
Before I begin I have to say if you haven’t started this series, you absolutely should!The Score is Dean’s story and before I even started I had already fallen in love with the rich, college playboy who doesn’t seem to take anything too seriously.
My favorite thing about Elle Kennedy’s stories is the relationship development and the realness you feel while reading.
I love how Allie, the queen of relationships, tamed the king of the manwhores, Dean.
Allie and Dean are not perfect and I liked that best of all, it made them more real to me.
