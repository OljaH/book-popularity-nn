As such, I’m still hunting down some of her harder to find books and haven’t come close to reading all of her novels.
Holt’s books may be true the era of time in which she sets her stories, the women of the day having little opportunity and often at the mercy of men, but her heroines are rarely ‘too stupid to live’, or present themselves as the proverbial ‘damsel in distress’.
But, to be fair, the ending was a lot more sinister than Jane Eyre, as there is a legitimate murder mystery and our heroine is in genuine danger which for its day was probably a little shocking.
But Martha still feels Alice's presence around the TreMellyn mansion.To thicken the plot, we have Peter Nansellock, a handsome neighbor paying Martha some extra attention; his kind sister Celestine; Gillyflower, an emotionally disturbed young daughter of a dead servant and a gentleman who abandoned her; Lady Treslyn, a vividly lovely, young former actress and the wife of an elderly lord, who seems to be waiting for him to die so she can marry Connan; a devoted and gossipy housekeeper with a taste for whiskey in her tea; and various other characters.Victoria Holt's writing style is prosaic; it's never going to inspire me.
I read a lot of Holt in my teens, then they started to feel both gloom laden and like they had come off a production line, so I stopped.
I reread another favourite   and while I didn't love it so much this time round, I rounded the book up to 4★ for old times sake.
The Mistress of Mellyn, the first Holt I read (although I had read plenty of her Jean Plaidy titles) and the first one she wrote, has stood the test of time and I am happy to award 5★.This books succeeds in so many areas, the Cornwall
The Mistress of Mellyn, the first Holt I read (although I had read plenty of her Jean Plaidy titles) and the first one she wrote, has stood the test of time and I am happy to award 5★.This books succeeds in so many areas, the Cornwall setting, the era (I prefer my Gothics to be Victorian!) the faint air of menace and unease, an attractive hero.
And (view spoiler)[ I find it hard to believe ending up with ten children of her own, plus Alvean & Gilly is a happy ending.
This is one of those cases where the star rating is based on my memory of how much pleasure the book gave me when I read it as a young girl.
Not sure how it holds up to contemporary scrutiny.~~~~~~~~~~~Having just reread this book to see how it holds up I have this to say about it.
The writing style is pedestrian.
This is evidently Victoria Holt's first book and I will be curious to see if the style improves.However, I still like the story a lot.
I loved the little girls, Alvean and Gilly.
I won't change my rating for sentimental reasons but would probably give it three stars today.
I did not remember that!
What a great read!
I am still thinking about this book after finishing yesterday.
I remember this title quite well.
And I read all of her books when she finished.
I just don't remember any of this story.
Great characters and setting.
Oh so gothic!I really enjoyed it quite a lot.
But, I might would have felt/acted the same way back in the day.
It would make a really great one.
I love the way the conflict was resolved on this one.
I highly recommend it for those that enjoy those good old gothics and the setting of Cornwall.
Enjoy!
And no wonder, when she has lost her beloved mother, when her father, Connan Tremellyn, was cold and remote, and when a number of governesses had come and goneMarty could understand Alvaen.
Maybe he had a plan …There are echoes of Daphne DuMaurier and Charlotte Bronte here: a grand mansion on a Cornish cliff, haunted by its former mistress; a plain young woman set against a dark and brooding hero; hints family of family secrets …Fortunately Victoria Holt had the ability to take those familiar ingredients and create something a little different.
2.5 Stars This happen to be one of those books with great writing that pulls one in, but not enough substance to truly make it shine.
Most of the events were pretty much everyday things, with a few clues drops from time to time, but not enough to figure out what happen to the wife who all of a sudden- up and took off with the local man-hoe and then was killed.
I didn't understand why Martha fell in love with Connan, and sorta understood why Connan fell for Martha even if it was sudden (marry me!
3.5 (for Retro Reads)“There are two courses open to a gentlewoman when she finds herself in penurious circumstances,” my Aunt Adelaide had said.
“One is to marry, and the other to find a post in keeping with her gentility.”I’d never heard of Victoria Holt but this gothic romantic story was full of suspense.
Martha Leigh, vicar daughter with no prospect of marriage, accepts a post to take care of 8-year-old Alvean, who has lost her mother in tragic circumstances.
Upon arrival, our heroine is faced with a resentful and defiant child, gossipy staff, well-meaning neighbours, an orphaned girl left to haunt the place, and an absent master.
This is my second Holt and I am still thrilled with her.
I think she will prove to be one of those authors I can pick up anytime and be assured of a good read.
I still love the way she slowly weaves the mystery, reveals the characters bit by bit and gradually builds the gentle romance.
I love the banter of conversation amongst them - humorous, revealing, flirtatious, mysterious, heartfelt.
I find her writing style in general very easy to read and flowing but not insulting to one's intelligence.
I might consider Holt a Du Maurier lite - which suits me.
I grew up buying gothic mysteries by the bagful.
What a refreshing change, to discover Victoria Holt's 1960, “Mistress Of Mellyn”, broke that mould!
Most appear to have missed that Martha Leigh has a good life with her sister and aunt and CHOSE to seek employment.She is no inferior.
She contacts her family any time she likes.
This differs greatly from most gothic mysteries I have ever read!
Connan is not really arrogant and his daughter, Martha's first student, is not resistant for long.All of a sudden, the mystery ramped up.
I wonder if some readers cast judgement, thinking it was Victoria's début.

After two misses, it was nice to score a hit.
Apparently, I am an old-fashioned woman.

Leave out the sex scenes and let’s have an actual plot, please.Stereotypical as can be, Mistress of Mellyn gave me the usual Victoria Holt offering.
An impoverished gentlewoman with no options except being a governess, a student with potential and problems, an attractive employer with an air of mystery, another man to distract our heroine a bit, plus another woman to get the jealous juices flowing.
Yes, I’ve read it all before, but yes I still enjoyed it.
Gothic Mystery set in Cornwall with a Wonderful Love StorySet in Victorian England in Devon, Cornwall, this is the story of Martha Leigh (“Miss Leigh”) who, at 24, comes to Mount Mellyn to become the governess to widower Connan TreMellyn’s young daughter, Alvean.After all, what’s an educated woman with no parents and no prospects to do?Miss Leigh soon discovers that Alvean is spoiled, hard to manage and suffering from too little of her father's attention, which might explain the departure of the last three governesses.
I loved the Cornish setting--I kept picturing those cliff scenes in the BBC version of Poldark.Marty was a pleasant and believable heroine and Connan was okay, but somehow the romance never clicked with me.
(hide spoiler)]Far better than the romance was the story of the two children befriended by Marty--an unusual feature in a Gothic romance.
This is the Great Room with the high ceilings and exposed beams like those at Mellyn that so impressed Marty.For fun, some pictures of Elizabethan era houses in Cornwall.
This is Trerice another grand manor in Cornwall of one of the landed families.
The master of the house is Connan TreMellyin, whose child Alvean she has to teach.
Clementine wants to marry Connan and mothers Alvean constantly, while Peter is a flirt.
Life only becomes more complicated when she falls head over heels in love with Connan.
The high star rating is because I loved the depiction of the murderer, even though I had guessed who it was.
I wasn't certain, though.Does Martha solve the mystery and marry Connan or does she fall prey to the diabolical mind that could do anything to get what it wants?
"There are two courses open to a gentlewoman when she finds herself in penurious circumstances.......One is to marry, and the other to find a post in keeping with her gentility."With no other prospects in sight, Martha Leigh takes a position as governess for eight-year-old Alvean TreMellyn at her family's estate Mount Mellyn in Cornwall.
Martha settles in and builds a relationship with both Alvean and the waif-like Gillyflower and she also finds herself attracted to the master of the house (well of course!), but then things soon begin to go bump in the night in typical Holt fashion.
Rating Clarification: 2.5 StarsI've been doing alot of re-reads at the beginning of 2012; some from books of my childhood, others from books of my teen years.
However, the appeal of Victoria Holt's first published gothic novel, Mistress of Mellyn, faltered in my remembered enjoyment from long ago.While not a badly written book, the elements of suspense and tension so crucial to a good gothic were lacking throughout the story.
Being a reader who enjoys this aspect of a story, I found her descriptions of the environment very well written and appealing.All in all, not a waste of time, but not Holt's best effort either.***Read as part of the Gothicked group read in February 2012.
More years than I care to remember since I read this novel. You tend to forget just what pure escapism this author offered to her readers. Loved the atmosphere and the Cornish setting. Somewhat predictable but still good fun........a dark and brooding hero and a determined and feisty heroine with a heart of gold that had the power to bring a family together. All the hallmarks that you look for in a "Gothic" romantic/suspense.
Well, it's certainly no Jane Eyre.
I "discovered" Victoria Holt in my local library back in high school.
My mom remembered reading and loving her books back when she was my age.
My only complaint of Holt, even back in high school, was that nothing seemed to happen for ages, and then in the last twenty pages everything would happen!
It always left me feeling like I'd just finished a great book, but also like I'd been deceived a little into that impression.Recently, I got into D.E. Stevenson and found myself remembering Holt's style and female protagonists--strong, ultimately, though not totally perfect.
A classic gothic: when Martha takes a position as a governess in remote Cornwell, catering to a spoiled child, she does not expect to be surrounded by mystery and find herself in danger...
Before the fun stuff was a bunch of occasional musing on Martha's part about Alice, and no real searching.
So unlike the infamous gold-standard Mr. Darcy, Connan's full character arc goes from arrogant sot to besotted without, you know, ever actually overcoming his obnoxiousness.
She tries for spunky without ever being quite clever enough to manage.But Alvean and Gilly were good child characters, which is something I'm sensitive too, and I did like their growing relationship with Martha, though, given this novel is from Martha's perspective, I really could barely tell it was happening on her part.
And of course, the melodrama was fun, when it arrived.
Mistress of Mellyn is a great example of an old-fashioned gothic romance.
It begins with the necessary heroine, an impoverished gentlewoman with no prospects for marriage (of course), who is pursuing a living as a governess in an isolated and somewhat spooky manor.
All this is wrapped up in rumors and mysterious happenings while our heroine, against all her better judgment, begins to have feelings for the man she suspects may have had a hand in his wife's death.
If you like your romances of the soap-opera variety, with the threat of doom and gloom, Victoria Holt in general and Mistress of Mellyn in particular will serve you well!
This novel is going for Jane Eyre meets Rebecca, but it never quite gets there. Decent storyline, but difficult for me to really connect with the characters.
We are born, we suffer, we love, we die, but the waves continue to beat upon the rocks; the seed time and the harvest come and go, but the earth remains.
Cookson’s books are much better written, with better storylines and good developed characters.
The murderer never explains the motive behind his actions.
And this suppressed hatred the murderer supposedly “felt” seems strange, when throughout the book, that person was genuinely nice and affectionate to everyone, without fault—that kind of feeling is rather hard to fake.
Connan, got to love that name, is never developed in the book, yet he’s the main heartthrob for the governess.
Holt develops her secondary character Peter, the neighbor next door, more fully than Connan, and because of that I almost wished that he were the leading man.
Luckily, I had a backup of this one:This Gothic romance packs plenty of punch thanks to the myriad plot ingredients to be found lurking within the pages.
Under the name of Victoria Holt, the author turned out dozens of similar Gothic romances, all packed with brooding heroes and mysterious plots.
Holt has a gift for natural-sounding dialogue and the period setting is expertly captured.And so the story goes on, the pages filled with all kinds of ingredients: there’s the whisky-sipping gossip of a housekeeper; a mysterious mute girl, almost spectral, who hides in the woods; a secret assassin; a poison pen and more charged, fizzling sexuality than you can shake a stick at.

Review:Books by Victoria Holt are a must for all lovers of Gothic suspense/romance, I have been told.
Not many people read Victoria Holt , I guess .
Gothic Suspense had been one of my favorite genre since I discovered and read Rebecca when I was 15.Mistress of Mellyn though having undertones of Rebecca was very engrossing.
She's sure there is more to her death than what meets the eye...Mistress of Mellyn was a very enjoyable read for me.
The main premise of both novels revolve around "mysterious deaths.".Mistress of Mellyn lacks the haunting quality of Rebecca.
I wasn’t crazy about the ending but that said I LOVED this book!I thought the motive for the crime wasn’t substantial enough.
There are a couple of different mysteries going on which make this novel enjoyable on so many levels.There was a lot in the suspense forum as well as the romance category.
I loved that there was a strong equestrian theme in the book, as a hunter/jumper equestrian myself, that made the novel all the more of a favorite for me!There is a lot to love in this classic Gothic romance!
She’s the queen of modern Gothic Romance/Suspense novels.
This cover obviously has everything you would want in a gothic novel: A woman looking ghost-like at twilight, near a rocky ocean side, with an old, foreboding mansion in the background.
Of course there is also a love story, which is that the governess, Martha, is falling in love with Connan!
What I liked about this book is that the story moved along very quickly (although at times I thought it could have been a little slower) and I couldn't predict the ending.
I thought the story could have used a little more creepiness, but that's just my personal taste.
