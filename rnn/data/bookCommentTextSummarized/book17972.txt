Suffice it to say that I absolutely adored every word of story – it was fun, quirky and unique.In case you don’t remember, Daniel and Six were Holder and Sky’s best friends from Hopeless and Losing Hope and while this novella reads as a standalone, it would have greater meaning if you read both those books first.
I finished it with a huge smile on my face and the happiest feeling in my heart.Truly, the perfect novella ♥5 stars!
I don’t want to be Peter Pan.Maybe she can be like Cinderella and I’ll be her Prince Charming.
5 Cinderella Stars!!! Colleen Hoover has done it again. I swear, this woman could not write a bad story if she tried. Finding Cinderella, as short as it was, is a new favorite of mine. We meet Daniel (Holder’s best friend) and Six (Sky’s best friend) in Hopeless. Six and Daniel meet in a closet, although it’s dark and they don’t know one another, they connect.  It feels sort of euphoric, like we’re in some sort of fairy tale. Like she’s Tinkerbell and I’m Peter Pan. No, wait. I don’t want to be

Six and Daniel meet in a closet, although it’s dark and they don’t know one another, they connect.

Daniel spends weeks looking for his Cinderella.
Neither one of them know that the person they are spending so much time with is the same person from the closet.
I loved Daniel and Holder together...
Daniel Wesley loves Dean Holder.
Colleen Hoover’s writing is magical.
5 MOTHERF***KING ANGEL STARS!! "Maybe she can be like Cinderella and I'll be her Prince Charming." ~Daniel   "Once upon a time, there was a tiny maintenance closet; crowded, abandoned, a place to sleep or skip class. Here, in this small closet, Prince Charming met Cinderella.Although originally all Prince Charming wanted was a place to avoid class or a place to take a quick nap, he encounters a woman who happens upon the closet he's in. They form an immediate connection, and fearing that once t
"Maybe she can be like Cinderella and I'll be her Prince Charming." ~Daniel 
Then Cinderella meets Prince Charming, I mean Daniel
"It feels like her air just became my air and I suddenly want to take in fewer breaths in order to ensure she never runs out." ~Daniel
I feel like their story should continue.
I feel like they have infinite possibilities, but if Colleen Hoover does end their story here, and we never hear any more from Daniel and Six, I know in my heart that they'll get their HEA one day.
WHAT I THOUGHT I WAS GETTING  WHAT I ACTUALLY GOT Despite the fact I don't normally read YA/NA, I wanted to try this novella since all my friends love it, I've not read Colleen Hoover and I have two teenage nieces to whom I was hoping to recommend this book and author. This author does have a lovely writing style. But my problems with this started in the prologue and I simply couldn't get past them, even though there were parts of this I enjoyed.When the title and blurb uses the words  Cinderel
Despite the fact I don't normally read YA/NA, I wanted to try this novella since all my friends love it, I've not read Colleen Hoover and I have two teenage nieces to whom I was hoping to recommend this book and author.
is what I'm expecting....Instead....(view spoiler)[ Of this...I got this...Two teenagers, two strangers, who have sex on their second meeting at school in the janitor's closet during school hours.
(hide spoiler)]These kids' sex education must have come straight from Chef.(view spoiler)[Except that Daniel sounds like eighteen going on thirty-eight when he tells Six he's going to make love to her for forty-five minutes....yeah, like an eighteen year-old boy is going to do that instead of wham-bam-thank-you-mam....
5 Heartwarming Stars!!Daniel (Holder’s best-friend, in the doubtfully case you’ve forgotten.) found a girl in a maintenance closet a year ago.
They never saw each other’s faces, they never found out their names, but they fell in love inside a closet.Until one day she suddenly stops appearing in the closed and leaving him broken to never heard from her again until now, one year after.
When I first read Losing Hope I remember thinking that I would love to read a book about Daniel’s story because he was pretty much awesome.
I also remember thinking that Six was pretty cool and a great friend.
SIX stars!!!!I heart Colleen Hoover. Hard. I think the only thing that might make me love her more is if she wrote a book with sex in it. She can write a book boyfriend, a male lead, a hero like none other!!!! And Daniel was no exception!! I LOVED Daniel.I LOVED Six.I LOVED how they met.I LOVED how they fell in love.I LOVED their banter. I LOVED Daniel's family--SO funny.I LOVED LOVED LOVED every.single.thing about this book!Group hug!
Thank you Colleen Hoover for gifting this book to the reading world!
I wish I had your flare with words to perfectly express how much I truly adore your books.
Thank you!Finding Cinderella is told completely in Daniel Wesley’s pov.
Daniel is Dean Holder’s funny, loyal, and lovable best friend.
While hiding out in the maintenance closet during 5th period, Daniel meets his Cinderella.
They share something truly special even though they never see each other or exchange names.
I experienced so many emotions while reading this story.
Daniel and Holder’s bromance was absolutely adorable!
Screw it, this book made me smile the entire time so it gets  5 stars!
She really looks like a fucking angel..”  There's something about Colleen Hoover novellas, I tend to love them more than her full length novels.
I loved reading Six and Daniel's book, I had a gigantic smile on my face the entire time.
I loved both characters and their unconventional romance.Leave it to Colleen Hoover to write a funny book and one packed with all the feels at the same time.
I found myself rooting for this couple from the very beginning and would love to see more of them in the future.
“I’ve never believed in anything like I believe in the possibility of the two of us.”  Oh my God, can this woman write a bad book just for kicks? No, this is not just a novella, it is not just a little add-on story to an already stellar series, and this is definitely not a re-hash of anything we’ve already seen in Hopeless or Losing Hope – this is the story that fills all the little gaps we never even knew needed filling and it is the story that makes us fall in love with the two secondary cha
No, this is not just a novella, it is not just a little add-on story to an already stellar series, and this is definitely not a re-hash of anything we’ve already seen in Hopeless or Losing Hope – this is the story that fills all the little gaps we never even knew needed filling and it is the story that makes us fall in love with the two secondary characters as much as we loved Holder and Sky. It is also a testament to the fact that Colleen Hoover doesn’t need 400 pages to make you feel with every crevice of your heart and that when it comes to telling a story through witty but emotionally-charged dialogues or creating loveable, engaging characters, she is unrivalled.
It was perfect and together they were adorable.The whole time I was laughing!!I think I'm in love *sigh* Daniel is funny,adorable,sweet and cute!!He doesn't hesitate!He says whatever going through his mind!!And this is what I loved about him!!!I also liked his family and especially his father lol !!He was hilarious!!I wish there was more to read!!!
The story was funny,adorable and sweet!!
"I used to hate everybody ... Until I met you."Finding Cinderella is insanely cute. Daniel and Six are such fun and hilarious characters. I'm surprised I enjoyed this so much considering it's only a novella.Sorry Will, sorry Holder, I have a new favorite. DANIEL.
“Maybe she can be like Cinderella and I’ll be her Prince Charming.” Let's face it. I knew this was going to be amazing. It's practically Colleen Hoover's trademark to work magic with literature and Finding Cinderella was no exception.But I didn't know that it was going to be this amazing. I didn't know it was going to be the type of amazing that would just blow me away without failure. And all in a hundred pages. That's the thing. All in a hundred-and-five pages. That's short. And to make me fa
Daniel and Six were the couple that I never thought would feel right together, but once I actually thought about it, I could never actually see what was wrong with them being together in the first place.
(Well, it's not but who says I don't have a taste for the theatrics)And to end this review (if it even is a review because mostly it's just me gushing or praying for another short story), I'm just going to use a couple of song lyrics from The Avett Brothers (which coincidentally is a band that was introduced to me in 
How she managed for me, a general hater of novellas, to fall madly in love with Finding Cinderella says it all."I wish it could be real." Finding Cinderella doesn't read like a novella though.
It reads like a full length novel.
Normally at end of novellas, we're genuinely happy it's over (at least I am) since it's usually for characters that we're not head over heals for.But not with this one.Oh no.
The chemistry between all the characters and witty banter had me smiling nearly the whole time- Until I wanted to cry at one part.
I have such a love/hate relationship with Colleen Hoover's books.
A modern day Cinderella story but instead of a ballroom where Prince Charming meets Cinderella it is a high school maintenance closet.
Daniel is Prince Charming and Six is Cinderella.
Finding Cinderella  is from Daniel's POV.
If you haven't read Hopeless it's okay because Finding Cinderella can be read as standalone.Christmas has arrived early and Ms. Hoover gifted everyone this novella.Thank you, Ms. Hoover, for the amazing gift.
Your story telling skills never ceases to amaze me.
*Pre-review* (view spoiler)[**PRE-ORDER this free novella****FREE** novella by Ms. Hoover coming out on October 14th.
(hide spoiler)]SERIES:
Each book is one character's POV of the same story.Novellas:
What a cute fun short sweet story this was.
Colleen Hoover manages to shove everything we love about Colleen Hoover books into about 90 pages.
We got super sticky icky love.
We got our hilariously bantering couple.
We got our omg wtf plot twist.
And we got it all wrapped up in a nice little bow of an ending.
My only problem is I want more!!!
I want to know what happens to them next!
If this is my only problem with a good then I figure it's a good one to have.
Because goddamn it it would be so ridiculously cute.
Don't open your eyes... Give me ten more seconds to stare, because you look absolutely beautiful right now  Finding Cinderella is an adorable read and any Colleen Hoover fan will be jumping for joy and wishing for more5 Adorable StarsHonestly, I don't think I was in the best frame of mind in reading this, so my review may be a little off base.

Finding Cinderella is an adorable read and any Colleen Hoover fan will be jumping for joy and wishing for more5 Adorable StarsHonestly, I don't think I was in the best frame of mind in reading this, so my review may be a little off base.
Yes, I'm a major Colleen Hoover fan, yes I've read all of her books, but I guess when it comes down to it, I'm just not a fan of novellas.This is Daniel and Six's story.
So, yes, Finding Cinderella is an adorable read, it's a Colleen read and YAY for releasing it as FREE we fans love you for it.And like many readers, I'm gonna say this...
3.5 starsYou can get it for free on Amazon.
Even though it's a short story, the ending was bit too rushed.
And unfortunately, the whole story wasn't that believable.
I didn't like Six in Hopeless, so I didn't expect to like her here either.
She's, however, an okay character.
I liked Daniel a bit better but he's not a perfect character in any way.
And, of course, Colleen had to go and stab my heart at the very end.
But I liked the plot twist and that's mostly why I'm giving this book more than 2 stars.
I laugh and clutch at my heart. "Dammit, Six. I love every single word that comes out of your mouth.""Cock," she says dryly. She's evil."Except that word," I say. "I don't love cock." Can someone find a way for me to rate this higher than 5 stars? 'Cause yeah, that's what needs to happen right about now. This little novella (little novella, people!) managed to wring more emotion out of me than most full length books. Six and Daniel are delightful together. The fact that I used the word "delight
"Dammit, Six. I love every single word that comes out of your mouth.""Cock," she says dryly.
"I don't love cock."
The fact that I used the word "delightful" in a review should tell you just how much I loved this story!
There's no other word for it, though.
I'll admit to feeling a little creepy about having book crushes on both Daniel and Six but I've moved on from that.
Now I'm just thinking about the fact that I'm jealous of all the folks that get to read this one for the first time.Well done in a big way, Colleen Hoover.
My Thoughts: ✮ First off, I'd really like to recommend that you read at least the first book in the series before you read this one.
It's not necessary but I think you will have more of a feel of the story and what it's about.
✮ That being said...from reading the other books, I always felt like Daniel was a bit strange so I was pleasantly surprised!
✮ And I'm really glad we got more of Six. I feel like we got cheated out of her in the first book.
✮ I would definitely classify this as more NA th
✮ That being said...from reading the other books, I always felt like Daniel was a bit strange so I was pleasantly surprised!
Heck, even their kisses are intense!✮ Love Daniel with his nicknames and how it's finally explained!✮ I enjoyed their sarcasm, teasing and being honest with each other.✮ Of course, there was not enough Holder but I liked how he forbade Daniel to date Six.
“Give me ten more seconds to stare, because you look absolutely beautiful right now.”❀ “I don’t even know your phone number,” I say.
Daniel Wesley loves Dean Holder.
ALL GOOD THINGS.

I just LOVE Colleen Hoover's writing style.I found myself highlighting way too many excerpts from this book.Daniel is just as amazing as ever, and so incredibly hysterical.
Find all of my reviews at: http://52bookminimum.blogspot.com/ You might be asking yourself, “why would a shriveled up old hag like  her  be reading Finding Cinderella????” The answer is quite simple: Any author who has a memento copy of one of their books printed in “Ermahgerd” is someone who deserves to be read. Also, Finding Cinderella was free, so it was the obvious winner of the “which one should I read?” contest.That being said, NA is soooooo not my bag. I am old and have a very low thresho
You might be asking yourself, “why would a shriveled up old hag like 
be reading Finding Cinderella????” The answer is quite simple:
If I were a young puppy again I would seriously love to be able to download freebies like this on the Kindle rather than being forced to steal my mom’s old Jackie Collins’ paperbacks in order to read something steamy.
*shudder*I’m assuming if you are a fan of NA, Finding Cinderella is one that could receive a much higher rating along with a rave review, but please note a 3 Star rating from me is pretty dang solid.
First of all Colleen, I love you.
You're my all time favorite author.
I love your sense of humor and I really love when you describe feelings.
:) I really loved and also lived this book.
And people, believe me this book should be at least 1000 pages.
:) I laughed too much but in the end I cried.
I cried like a baby.
Colleen, you always did this to me.
It was phenomenal and trust me, you'll be in love Daniel too as much as Holder.
(^_^) My God, I wanna write you whole book people but I shouldn't have to give you spoilers.
Fun, quick book. I laughed out loud a few times with this one.
my heart is just melting!!! what a heartwarming story!!!! my sweet : this gorgeous novella was too butterflying sexy-sweetmy suck : my greedy self wants more <333333
"Maybe she can be like Cinderella and I’ll be her Prince Charming."    "I feel her in every part of me and the feeling is new and heavy and intense and I realize in this moment that we just became so much more together than we could ever possibly be alone." Oh my goodness, Colleen Hoover did it again. In a matter of a mere 93 pages, she made me laugh and cry and smile at the overwhelming amount of cuteness in this book. I adored every page of this and my only complaint is that I wish it were
Oh my goodness, Colleen Hoover did it again.
In a matter of a mere 93 pages, she made me laugh and cry and smile at the overwhelming amount of cuteness in this book.
I adored every page of this and my only complaint is that I wish it were longer!
Daniel and Six were freaking ADORABLE and I am glad to see Holder & Sky's beloved besties get they're own not-so-fairy-tale happy every afters!My Six & Daniel:(Is it cheating that I stole the actors from the movie "A Cinderella Story?" You gotta admit, they make the perfect Six and Daniel!)Definitely one of my favourite novellas.
I'll devour and love ANYTHING Ms.Hoover writes!
They only meet a couple of times, and keep their identities unknown, but their connection is intense and makes a lasting impression.Fast forward one year and Daniel meets Six. Six is like no other girl he’s known.
I’m not spoiling things by telling you that they are the couple from the closet, as it’s mentioned in the description, so as a reader you keep wondering when they’ll put it together.
This was only a 105 pages, and I know sometimes as a reader a novella can make you feel a little short changed in story at the end, but Ms. Hoover’s writing made every page count.
If you are a fan of Colleen Hoover and think I’m talking about Daniel Craig and the number 6, you’re nuts and shouldn’t read the rest of this...I SAID STOP!Okay, so this a novella told from Daniel’s POV.................................................................it’s really hard to compliment an author when your words might be misconstrued as insults to their previous works.
This is the story of Daniel and Six, and Ms. Hoover never deviates for that.It’s been a while since I’ve laughed so honestly while reading a book.
As this book was written and provided free to her readers as a "thank you" for their continued support,we wanted to give our followers who wouldn't normally write a review the opportunity to share their thoughts on Finding Cinderella and that post can be found on our blog here: http://totallybookedblog.com/2013/10/...We did want to share this thought.
We recently asked Colleen Hoover why she wrote Finding Cinderella and why,instead of publishing it, did she decide to offer it to her readers for free and this was her response.COLLEEN:Two reasons, really.
“It feels sort of euphoric, like we’re in some sort of fairytale. Like she’s Tinkerbell and I’m Peter Pan. No, wait. I don’t want to be Peter Pan. Maybe she can be like Cinderella and I’ll be her Prince Charming”  That is an insta-love novella, but I LOVED THIS!! It's so funny and quick-read through exams. :)You can read it as a stand-alone or after reading Hopeless. It's about Six "Sky's friend" and Daniel "Holder's friend" and their love story.They are so funny and an amazing match!
