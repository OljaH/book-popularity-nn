Studying the book of Revelation was the best study I have done. This book was absolutely the best study tool. Powerful. This is one I will go over again. This is not a book you can just breeze through. It is a lot of clarity and understanding to take it.
Very good commentaryClear explanation of the book of revelation. You might not agree with all his points, but they are understandable and believable.
Outstanding commentary!
So glad I decided to read my grandmother's book. I think if he were to update it today, there would be changes, but the core is well-explained and outlined. Educational and inspiring.
Very good!
