I want to eat his face!"The next thing I know, Park is telling Eleanor that he's in love with her, how he can't imagine being without her, that she's IT for him.
Apart from a few brief monologuing sessions about his classmates thinking he was Chinese, Eleanor's off-hand "stupid Asian kid" remarks and Park's own dislike for, in his opinion, looking too feminine, there wasn't anything that felt accurate.
The problem with that was, by the end, I wanted to know what became of Eleanor's mom and siblings, but the focus was instead on her feelings for Park and letting him go.

They will always, always hold that little piece of your heart that no one else will ever be able to touch.
I love you, Rainbow Rowell, for giving me this.
HOLY BATMAN THAT ENDING. I'M A MESS. THAT HURT, BUT IT DIDN'T AT THE SAME TIME. WHAT IS THIS FEELING EVEN? NYEAAHHH.
I've often said that nobody should write for teens who doesn't remember what it was like to be one. Rainbow Rowell remembers, and has captured it beautifully in this book.
“I don't like you, Park," she said, sounding for a second like she actually meant it. "I..." - her voice nearly disappeared - "think I live for you."He closed his eyes and pressed his head back into his pillow."I don't think I even breathe when we're not together," she whispered.  Three stars is not a wholly negative rating but I have to admit that I'm disappointed with this one.

Eleanor & Park has enjoyable parts, but the only real difference I can see between this and Pushing the Limits is that the characters in the latter are meant to be hot.
The progression from reluctant bus partners to friendship was natural in the story, but I then felt that the jump from that to romantic and/or sexual feelings was too fast and unbelievable.Not only that, but where I felt the start of their relationship avoided the usual cliches and did something a bit different (like the way their relationship begins without them speaking to one another), I felt that once they were "together", it quickly dissolved into the usual sweet nothings and thoughts like "I'll die if I never see him again" after knowing each other for a few weeks.
I didn’t think I would ever feel actual butterflies reading a YA contemporary romance book.But I did.
Can a book really have this kind of effect on a human being?Well, I have my answer now.Eleanor & Park… It’s like they’re the main reason why the word ''love'' exists.
It’s like two angels fell in love and you can see a halo above their heads and all you can think is ''God, I wish them forever.
I fully admit that I'm a sucky book reviewer. This book for me was so personal that this review is just for me. Eleanor is just that girl. The weird one that people pick on. Who knows exactly why? She doesn't stand up for herself, she doesn't fight back. I was that girl. This is me my 10th grade year. If this book had been around then I would have completely worn the pages out. As it is I feel like highlighting and just re-reading the thing until it falls apart.Talking about Romeo and Juliet Ele
It's Shakespeare making fun of love."Exactly.I hated PE class.
Not because I didn't want to participate..that's just when the mean girls/boys were the worst.
Like she wanted to look ugly."Believe me..you do get to that point.
Your mind just completely gets to the point where if everyone else thinks badly about you, so do you.I never had my Park.
You hate to see that but it happens.
I wasn't judged like I had been in middle and high school.
I can be included in groups of people and liked for who I am.
My daughter faced some bullying last year at school.
Not because of what she looked like or wore.

Eleanor and Park (the people) stole my breath.The initial story starts out with Eleanor, the new girl in school, getting on the bus for the first time and having no place to sit.
Park has a romantic soul, made evident by the way he thinks of his Eleanor, the way he goes from train wreck curiosity to utter fascination and adoration with the awkward girl with so many secrets...he stole my heart.`*~`*~`*~`*~`*~`*~`*~`*~`*~`*~`*~`*~`*~`*~`*~`*~
Eleanor's back story is one to make me feel like the world's best mom quite simply because I could never allow what happened to her to happen to my daughters.

____________________________________________I liked this book,and not because of the romance,I never like the books based on their romance.Because it was peaceful and wild and sad and beautiful and the same time.And it made me want to read more,made me search for a sequel,made me think a lot after I finished,made me happy,like entirely happy.____________________________________________
____________________________________________I didn't like the ending,I loved it.It was predictable at some points,at least for me,but still so freaking beautiful.And am I the only one who wants a sequel,of what will happen with them after the end?
____________________________________________I highly recommend this book to you,even if you don't like books,read it:)
He hadn’t even had time to eat breakfast or brush his teeth, which made him self-conscious, knowing he was going to be sitting so close to her.”‘So,’ he said, before he knew what to say next, ‘you like the Smiths?’ He was careful not to blow his morning breath on her.She looked up, surprised.
I completely adored Eleanor and Park's first kiss (maybe a little too much).Source'I’ve never done this before,’ she said.‘S’okay,’ he said.‘It’s not, it’s going to be terrible.’He shook his head.

This book just swept me off my feetWe have Eleanor, "Big Red," the new girl in town.
We have Park, half-Asian in a town full of whites, who's the coolest kid in his school.
His life is not going to plan - his younger brother constantly shows him up, his father is never proud and his mother just  doesn't get American high school.One fateful meeting on a crowded bus sparked it all.
Eleanor and Park's romance is the kind that has you clutching the book, kicking your feet and squealing in relief at their happiness.
“No matter what happens," Park said, "I love you.” 
I wasn't expecting to care so much about these characters and their relationship but I was completely caught up in this story.
It seemed like their relationship shouldn't work, but it does, so well.
I was grinning like an idiot while reading because I was just so giddy over their blooming romance.
I could feel how much they cared for each other like it was oozing off the page.Overall, I loved this book--the characters, the romance, the writing and just the way everything unfolded so beautifully and felt so real.
and while john green gets all the credit for being the author that writes the contemporary YA novels sophisticated enough to convert stubborn adult readers into YA fans, i think this book is more faithful to the realities of teenlife than his.
after eleanor pooh-poohs romeo and juliet as …two rich kids who've always gotten every little thing they want and dismisses the play as shakespeare "making fun of love," the less-cynical park hesitantly pinpoints the appeal of romeo and juliet:"…because people want to remember what it's like to be young?
3.8/5 Stars ⭐ ⭐ ⭐ ⭐“Eleanor was right. She never looked nice. She looked like art, and art wasn't supposed to look nice; it was supposed to make you feel something.” Wait a fucking minute. There are no more pages? It just ended... like that? Rainbow Rowell, why do me like this? Do you not love your readers? Why would you leave it hanging there? I NEED CLOSURE. OR MAYBE A SECOND BOOK. Or a movie. Who the fuck knows? I know I'm dying right now.Set over the course of one school year in 1986, this i
When Eleanor meets Park, you'll remember your own first love-and just how hard it pulled you under.This book had flaws.
She creates realistic situations and characters that you can relate to and want to punch and love and hate and loathe and adore.
But this was an aspect I adored, it added something to the book, to the characters, to the time and the depth of the situations.
Yes, it was flawed, yes, it was too much at times, yes, the ending left me hanging for more, but I loved it.
I especially enjoyed Park's parents: they were so complex and confused about their son, but ultimately so supportive.2) ODDBALLS: I love that basically every character in this book was weird and quirky and individual.
He had a handful of not-so-honourable moments, but he owned up to them, he felt bad about them, and he tried his best to overcome them.
from that moment on we were in such a dangerous and nervous place.
I think the ending makes perfect sense, it's very realistic, but that doesn't mean I don't want a sequel ;)
Moreover, while Eleanor and Park are on the surface atypical YA characters, I still found their life circumstances portrayed in a way that did not allow me to take them seriously.For instance, at the beginning of the book, Eleanor has just moved back in with her family after having been kicked out by her stepfather and spending a year at a friend’s house.
I know I said I wasn't going to do a review, because I feel that my status updates are pretty telling enough, but...First, I just don't see Park's parents as a good example of a couple that "made it" against all odds, as John Green implies.
It sounds like a white man "saving" an Asian woman from her "poor," "lower-rung," "terrible" life.
She's got more to worry about than hurting your poor feelings.Overall, I just felt like there wasn't much going for this book.

RE-READ: February 24, 2018I know many people dislike this book and prefer Rowell's other books instead, but this book holds a special place in my heart.
Eleanor & Park was actually the first English book I ever read.
Growing up, I loved reading and would always read Spanish books from the library, so I wanted to actually buy a book this time.
I didn’t know anything about Eleanor & Park and Rainbow Rowell.
Anyways, Eleanor & Park, like I said, holds a special place in my heart by really, being the first contemporary and romance book I ever read.
I love the new cover too ♥http://melissa413readsalot.blogspot.c...They met on the bus.Eleanor was the new girl, the girl with the vibrant red hair, the one everyone made fun of, but if they only knew what she had to go through at home.
I feel sad for them and wish their mom would man up and find a way to get her kids away from that jerk :( ♣♣♣♣♣So, yeah I have a terrible stepdad, and I don't have a phone, and sometimes when we're out of dish soap, I have to wash my hair with flea and tick shampoo....♣♣♣♣♣Eleanor's real dad didn't want any of them any more, he puts in an appearance in the book, a short one.

5 stars!    “You’re my favorite person of all time.”  Eleanor & Park… this has been sitting on my kindle for a year. HOW has this been just sitting on my kindle for a year??? First off, I’m going to say if you have this book, don’t let it just sit on your kindle. Read it, listen to it, whatever. Just make sure you don’t overlook this one. It’s a book that deserves to be read. These are some of the most special characters and Rainbow Rowell writes some of the best YA ever. So read the book. E
First off, I’m going to say if you have this book, don’t let it just sit on your kindle.
I was more interested in the world of Eleanor & Park than anything else I was reading.
In fact, I almost deducted some points because of it (but lets be real, I can’t possibly give this book less than 5 stars- who am I kidding).
The more I think about it, the more I think of the possibilities and I guess I’ll just have to be happy with the way things were left and use my imagination.Eleanor & Park is an epic story of friendship, love, loyalty and acceptance.
‘You’re not the Han Solo in this relationship, you know.’‘I’m totally the Han Solo,’ she whispered. ‘You can be Han Solo,’ he said, ‘And I’ll be Boba Fett. I’ll cross the sky for you.’  This book is one of the best things I have ever read, and I don’t care who you are, if you have feelings, you need to give this book a shot. Eleanor and Park is most definitely on my favorites list and I don’t think I will ever get over this amazing book or the flood of emotions sweeping me away right now.The st
This book is essentially a love story so I didn’t expect to see so much beyond it terms of family drama, high school drama, and just so many more feelings that were not romantic in nature.I love that the blurb is so vague about the characters and what is going to happen, but after you finish reading the book you look at the blurb and think ‘that’s where it all started’.
You know, after you finish reading the book you look back at a story so straightforward yet so complex in all the ways in which it mattered.
This book captured the essence of first love and the perils of high school, while also tackling some serious issues, like abuse.I listened to the Audible version and I have to give kudos to the narrator(s).
However, his petty problems only served to highlight how fortunate he was to have loving parents when contrasted with Eleanor's reality.Although Park initially avoided any association with Eleanor, succumbing to peer pressure, he eventually opened up to the girl that sat beside him on the school bus.
I couldn't believe that the author that wrote such a beautiful story would end it in that way.
And every time I thought they couldn't go any higher, Park would do or say something else that sent me flying up, up, up...In this book, it's 1986 and Eleanor's life isn't easy.
After sitting on the bus together day after day, they bond over comic books and mix tapes and kicks to the face and even makeup.
Again with the sledgehammers.Sadly, as Park and Eleanor learn the hard way, sometimes not all first loves are meant to be forever loves...
;)(view spoiler)[The end of this book left me in tears.
Basically, it was a bit of a disappointment after all my happy-swoony-puddly feelings from the beginning.
1.5/5 stars DNF at page 195  Apologies in advance to anyone who liked this book. This is simply my opinion. Looks like it's time for another unnecessarily long gif-filled rant review, folks. My friends, after this book: Me, after this book:Never have I ever been happier to check a book out from the library. Did I even read the same book as everyone else? I was expecting a swoon-worthy misfit love story. Did I get that? Nope. I got whiny characters and angst. A lot of angst. Seriously, a more app
But these characters....I didn't care about Eleanor, or Park, or their family, or the plot, or, more accurately, the lack of plot.
All I could think was:Which is probably what everyone is going to think about my unpopular opinion, sorry.There was one scene that made me think I was falling for these characters, but after that, everything I thought was, "How many pages do I have left?" or "When are things going to start getting good?" That should've tipped me off right then and there that I was not going to enjoy this.
You see, I typically give a book 100 pages before I decide if I like it or not.
You may love this book, as many others already have.I wanted to read this novel because it received several glowing reviews and it was being compared to John Green's The Fault in Our Stars, which I really liked.
Of course, I also had to skim a lot of the school scenes because the dialogue of the teens felt so contrived.And then there are all the retro pop culture references -- never for a page does Rowell let you forget that the story is set in 1986.
For young love, I really liked John Green's The Fault in Our Stars.
Yet, somehow, Rainbow Rowell made me feel what it would be like to be Eleanor.
And maybe that's partially because of the universality of Eleanor as a character--she's uncomfortable in her own skin, she can't understand why someone she likes as much as Park would like her, she doesn't feel deserving of love.
I seriously wanted Rowell out of my teenage brain for a lot of this book--it could feel uncomfortably close to home.I don't know what else to say about this book.
Something I noticed this time around: how real Eleanor is as a character.
I must be the only person in the world who finds this endlessly boring...
I absolutely adored this book! I don't really know what else to say. It was such a wonderful experience. Eleanor and Park have become a part of me, I was completely wrapped up in their story. Their voices are so real and honest. I love them. Plain and Simple. My only compliant is that I wanted more.  “I don’t like you, Park. Sometimes I think I live for you”  Highly recommend this one!!
