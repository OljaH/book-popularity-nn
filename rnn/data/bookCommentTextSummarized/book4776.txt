*****************************************************«Πιστεύω πως χάνουμε την αθανασία γιατί δεν έχει εξελιχθεί η αντίστασή μας στο θάνατο· οι τελειοποιήσεις της επιμένουν στην πρωταρχική, τη στοιχειώδη ιδέα: να διατηρήσουμε ζωντανό ολόκληρο το σώμα.
Φτάνοντας και μετά απο πολλές δυσκολίες και κακουχίες αντιλαμβάνεται ότι στο νησί που επέλεξε να ζήσει- σε αυτόν τον καταραμένο τόπο υπάρχουν ένα μουσείο, ενα παρε κκλήσι και μια πισίνα- βρίσκονται και άλλοι άνθρωποι, ανάμεσα τους και μια γυναίκα,η Φοστίν,την οποία και ερωτεύεται παράφορα.
Κανείς τους δεν μπορεί να δει τον κατάκοπο και απελπισμένο ήρωα μας, ούτε η γυναίκα που σχεδόν αξιοθρήνητα γονατίζει μπροστά της και της εξομολογείται τον έρωτα του.
Perhaps Borges’ appraisal reflects, in part, how Adolfo Bioy Casares shares much of his own aesthetic and literary sensibilities since, after all, they collaborated on twelve books.More specifically, here are some obvious similarities between the writing of the two authors:• The Invention of Morel is only one hundred pages, not too much longer than a number of Borges’s longer tales.• Similar to stories like The Circular Ruin, The Aleph and many other Borges tales, The Invention of Morel deals with multiple levels of so called reality.• The language and writing is elegant.
The Invention of Morel is a romantic classic in which passion triumphs over convention, a surrealist classic in which imagination triumphs over reality, a science fiction classic in which technology triumphs over time, and a mystery story whose fantastic resolution always plays fair with the reader. Is corporeality necessary for human personality? Is community possible even in isolation? Can love survive death and--perhaps what is worse--complete indifference? Bioy Casares novel addresses all of these questions. Not bad for a little book not quite one hundred pages long.
The sting of unrequited love and the human desire to cheat death form a beautiful landscape for discussions of immortality and escape through Bioy Casares deft churning of plot and revelation.The diary writer of The Invention of Morel is both literally, emotionally and psychologically stranded on an island.
Inspired by a fixation with actress  Louise Brooks, Invention explores the depths and depravity of unrequited love, focusing in on the infatuation one can feel for a character in a film or novel.
Insane. Insane. Again. Insane.  Then I resumed my efforts, moving to other parts of the wall. Chips fell, and, when large pieces of the wall began to come down, I kept on pounding, bleary-eyed, with an urgency that was far greater than the size of the iron bar, until the resistance of the wall (which seemed unaffected by the force of my repeated pounding) pushed me to the floor, frantic and exhausted. First I saw, then I touched, the pieces of masonry— they were smooth on one side, harsh, earthy
What does one achieve by undertaking a journey that robs him off his sanity and instead, plants a foreign temperament that forges alliance with none, not even with its owner?
His initial tentativeness is however, weakened gradually, as the sight appears almost every day and with time, more of her friends begin filling his vision.
As our narrator dwells deep into the mysterious appearance of Faustine, her appeal, her gang (especially Morel) and their purpose on the island, Casares begins tightening the grip, one knot at a time, around an outstanding plot, resting on magic, science and immortality.
Con solo leer de qué trata el argumento del libro del gran escritor francés, el lector que no haya surcado las páginas de este libros sabrá hacia dónde se desarrolla esta historia, tan bella, cautivante y leída por tanta gente alrededor del mundo.
Adolfo Bioy Casares' plot and aesthetic appears to be strongly influenced by Borges, which isn't a surprise considering the mentor-pupil friendship of the two authors.The book explores the life of a fugitive who is hiding on a deserted island.
It is this fear that has driven him to travelling in terse conditions and battling harsh weather to reach this island.
The book was partially inspired by the movement from silent films to talking films and resulting career-deaths of some celebrated icons of the silent film industry.
(See: Louise Brooks).H.G. Wells' The Island of Doctor Moreau is also an inspiration behind the novel.
Turns out it was a bit of both.Although I have read nothing to confirm this conclusion, it is entirely clear to me that LOST is merely a derivative version of Bioy Casares novella, The Invention of Morel.
Both the series and the book take place on a remote island which is inaccessible by normal means.
Bioy has a single protagonist who arrives on the island as a fugitive from justice for some indeterminate crime for which he feels both guilt and shame.
All the main characters feel guilt and shame and demonstrate the same sort of paranoia as Bioy's.3.
The nameless narrator from Venezuela, who is living on an island he believes is called Villings and who decides to write a diary of what is happening there.
I really couldn’t take the comings and goings any longer and so decided to abandon it.Nevertheless, would you believe that I couldn’t stop thinking about the wretched book and started rereading it the following day.
Then one day a group of visitors come to the island.
Our narrator is mesmerized by her, cannot get her out of his mind and watches her every day for a week.
A surrealistic story with perfect execution.
A shallow reader who enjoy cheap thrilling of pulp fictions enjoyed a Latin American literature work!
Mystery has big part on the story, so even it is a well known literature, I don't want to say much about the plot.
But I can say the atmosphere alone is a perfect example of surrealism of early 20th century.
I can't help myself imagining the story as in 1930s movie (the story was published at 1940).After finishing this, maybe I can endure reading the works of Jorge Luis Borges or Gabriel García Marquez.
جزيرة يفترض إنها مهجورة وكان التحاق هذا الرجل بالجزيرة اشبه بالإنفصال عن الحياة الحقيقية مما يوحي لك بأن هذه الرواية القصيرة كتبت لتمجد حياة العزلة وكيف يمكن لإنسان أن يتعامل مع العزلة بسخرية مؤلمة في ظل ظروف خارجة عن السيطرة غير أن الوضع في الجزيرة لا يبقى كما هو ففجأة يلتقي بمصطافين يظن في فترة ما إنهم متواطئون مع الشرطة وإنه ملاحق غير أن من بينهم إمرأة تجذبه لمراقبتها وتبدو تلك الفتاة مثل أملا للروح تحييها ، يقترب منها ، يزرع لها حديقة من الورد يود لو يركع تحت ركبتيها ، لكن الأمر ليس بتلك السهولة فلا الجزيزة تلك الجزيرة ولا البشر هم أؤلئك البشر ..
This work by Adolfo Bioy Casares, not only deals with a man’s fascination with the idea of immortality and how he tries to achieve it but also with its confrontation with reality.
The experiment being to make those people immortal by capturing them and letting them live in a projected world forever.Our narrator, who seems to be fascinated with this experiment because he has fallen in love with the image of a woman named Faustine, records all his experiences in a diary and somehow wishes to be a part of the experiment itself to be able to make his presence felt to the woman.
“Perhaps we always want the person we love to have the existence of a ghost.” The Invention of Morel is a deceptively slender novella, one which examines weighty psychological and philosophical concerns with great tenderness, delicacy and melancholy grace. It covers much intriguing ground; topics under discussion include solitude, love, the desire for immortality, and the ways in which human beings relate and grow attached to one another. While technically satisfying the requirements of inventi
It covers much intriguing ground; topics under discussion include solitude, love, the desire for immortality, and the ways in which human beings relate and grow attached to one another.
While technically satisfying the requirements of inventive science fiction or even a suspenseful adventure tale, it’s far richer and more thoughtful than any of those hopelessly inadequate labels can possibly convey.
And I suppose that, at its heart, what makes this hauntingly beautiful story so very precious is that it illustrates exquisitely the notion that, in many ways, it is far more sublime to love than to be loved.A genuinely innovative, poignant vision, this book will stay with you long after you've placed it back on the shelf.

but listen up great genius writers from the past: the situation set up in the book is super cool and mysterious and gorgeous and, yes, it does lend itself to some kind of metaphor for the elusive nature of truth and life and technology… but mr.
paz: isn’t it left so open that it could kinda be a metaphor for so much without actually pointing out anything substantial?
i think he could’ve tied it more successfully to actual human experience and would’ve dispensed with all the awkward expositional explanation (as did robbe-grillet/resnais in marienbad), while retaining the dark sense of mystery and human folly… oh, and why the hell is lulu on the cover?

Floating Reviews and the Television Show LostI just went through my update feed looking to see what my goodreads.com friends have been doing.
Instead I would like to make an observation of how my goodreads.com update feed mirrors this book.
For the past few days just about every morning and early evening that I check my update feed, or my homepage, or whatever we want to call it; there is one review that is always somewhere in the mix and match of reviews, comments and assorted other doings of my 'friends'.
Casares comes as close here as a writer possibly could to successfully mixing literary fiction with elements of science fiction.
These become more prevalent as the story goes on, almost suggesting that the faceless editor is trying to assert himself as a character.The way that I came to this book is through the discovery (Thanks Kimley!) that it was one of the main inspirations for Alain Robbe-Grillet’s screenplay Last Year at Marienbad.
Now I really want to read a copy of Robbe-Grillet’s screenplay to see how it compares.
Casares was a close friend of Jorge Luis Borges and they supposedly served as influences on one another’s work.

If you want a taste of true romance, you can try this.The Chinese book review I wrote for this novel:莊生曉夢迷蝴蝶--讀《莫雷的發明》阿根延作家Adolfo Bioy Casares的代表作《莫雷的發明》(Morel's Invention)，成書於黑白攝影與黑白電影盛行的1940年代。故事以一個無名政治逃犯的獨白為主軸，故事開首，述事者為了逃過追捕，乘船逃亡到一座廢棄的小島。然後島上竟發生異變︰一群看似是度假遊客似的上流社會男女竟憑空在島上出現，並在島上的建築物如「博物館」、教堂、游泳池，以及海灘之間流連忘返。述事者在旁窺探這群不速之客的活動，其間竟對一名每日在海邊眺望日落的女子(福斯蒂娜)日久生情。述事者嘗試以旁敲側擊的方式對女子示愛、希望她會注意到他的存在，但女子似乎對他一無所覺。隨著日子一天天過去，述事者觀察到種種無法解釋的異常之處︰島上訪客對述事者視而不見、天上出現兩個太陽和月亮、訪客們極度不合時宜的行為(例如在狂風暴雨中若無其事地出海暢泳等)、訪客們的閒話家常竟不斷重覆等等…謎團進一步加深。到底這群男女是幽靈、是被流放荒島的精神病患，還是一切只是一場誘惑述事者自投羅網的精妙演出?最後，訪客群中的成員莫雷，終於向同伴剖白了這次旅行活動的「真相」，「莫雷的發明」讓所有人萬劫不復，卻又將所有人拖進匪夷所思的「永恆」之中……得知真相的述事者，被迫作出最後決斷︰到底要活在與所愛對象永遠可望不可即的當下，還是拋棄一切以求置身心愛女子所在的永恆時光之中?《莫雷的發明》首先令我聯想到的，竟然是「超人」基斯杜化里夫主演的愛情/科幻片《時光倒流七十年》(Somewhere in Time)，兩者都是講述一名男子戀上一個不存在於自己所屬時空的女子，然後為了進入女子所屬的世界而費盡心思，穿越看似不可能的藩籬與心上人相逢、想方設法令茫無頭緒的女方愛上自己，最後也不約而同地為這一段情付出沉重代價。雖然全書的觀點之述事者一人的角度為主，但隨著述事者對島上眾訪客的活動進行窺探，故事的另外兩個主角︰莫雷和福斯蒂娜的形象也漸漸立體起來。福斯蒂娜一角據信是受黑白片明星Louise Brooks的啟發，她在述事者眼中是個美麗優雅，但難以捉摸的佳人；而她在島上與發明家莫雷、以至其他男子之間某些曖昧的對答和互動，更不時令述事者醋勁發作，懷疑他們是福斯蒂娜的戀人。透過述事者的目光，連福斯蒂娜也變成了島上的「謎」的一部份，述事者對福斯蒂娜的了解，僅來自旁觀她與其友伴在島上短短八日期間的一言一行，但即使是如影隨形的觀察，也無法令述事者了解心上人的內心感情。結果，無法了解福斯蒂娜心思的挫敗感，卻令述事者的認同落到了理應是「情敵」的莫雷身上。透過莫雷最後的告白，述事者得知莫雷遭到了拒絕(雖則莫雷沒提及拒絕他的女子是否福斯蒂娜)，然而與述事者不同的卻是，莫雷發明了他認為能夠留住永恆的機器，於是他策劃了這次島上旅行，在未經眾人同意之下利用機器的力量，將心上人與親愛的友伴們統統攝入自已精心為他們計劃的永恆時光中，以求讓心愛的女子永遠跟他一起停駐在「永恆」中。莫雷相信將眾人留在永恆之中就是對他們最大的關愛，卻無視他一手策劃的永恆會為所有人帶來毀滅的事實；雖說是莫雷以情愛之名以及一己的良好意願行事，但其中的自私和控制欲仍然令人不寒而慄。《莫雷的發明》畫寫愛情的筆法非常樸素，但這一段涉及兩男一女的詭異「三角關係」、一場(在常理下)不可能有結果的戀愛仍然顯得十分淒美迷離。當然， 若然以旁觀者的角度去看，我們可以質疑無名述事者對福斯蒂娜的感情與其說是愛情，不如說只是痴迷。可是莊生曉夢迷蝴蝶，箇中的一切到底是真是假，是虛幻還是現實，對沈溺執迷於感情中的當事者而言可能並無意義。而在《莫雷的發明》中，述事者對福斯蒂娜的愛最弔詭的地方，可能就是︰所愛的對象明明似是近在眼前，但真實的她卻其實已經不在了。《莫雷的發明》除了是一個愛情故事，更是一部集心理懸疑、科幻小說特色的作品，作者成功在精短的篇幅裡一層接一層地加重懸疑感。在故事的開首，作者用以事論事的口吻描寫述事者在荒島上掙扎求生，順帶為讀者介紹被廢棄的島上建築物如「博物館」等場所，然後借述事者之口帶出了環繞著島嶼的流言︰有關神秘瘟疫、輪船事故的奇怪流言，不著痕跡地為故事的結局定調。然後那群神祕的訪客無故在島上出現，打亂了述事者孤寂的生活，島上的荒涼情境以及述事者動盪不安的生活，對應著訪客們近乎超現實的悠然度假情趣，造成強烈對比。述事者對這群訪客的來歷作出了種種猜想，但當莫雷在度假的最後一天向同伴們坦白真相時，述事者才發現事態竟遠比他想像中更為曲折艱難，並引出最後不可避免的寂滅-永恆的詭異結局。作者Adolfo Bioy Casares透過《莫雷的發明》這篇半羅曼史半科幻的故事，他在1940年代大膽幻想的「留住永恆」、「留住永遠的瞬間」、「永生」的方法，似乎已在21世紀的現在逐漸變得距離我們不那麼遙遠，故事藉著愛情，這看似無比俗套但永不過時的深奧議題，一步步點出有關時間、科技、記憶、虛實、永遠輪迴、永恆的難解問題，到現在仍值得我們思考。相關連結︰《莫雷的發明》英文維基頁面︰http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morel%27...
4.5/5In order for this novel to work the groundwork had to be situated early and deftly, the author’s voice sculpted within the fictions flow.
At first the slowness, repetitiveness earned the book a 2 star rating and my reading ability a one lone lonely star.
Bending over the star I watched the slow cohesion of the pieces meld together.
Pieces of stars hoping not so much for my reading ability but for this lagging book?
Possibly the book teaching me how to read better?
Besides there are three more stars to piece and glue together.

Είχα την παραξενιά μάλιστα να μη δανείζομαι ή να αγοράζω βιβλία κάτω των 300 σελίδων τουλάχιστον καθώς στο μικρό και στενόμυαλο εγκέφαλο μου τότε υπήρχε η αντίληψη ότι δεν ήταν δυνατό ένας συγγραφέας ν’ αναπτύξει μια σωστή ιδέα σε λίγες σελίδες.
Εκεί ξεκινάει και η δική μου παραδοχή ότι μπορεί να μην είχα την σύνδεση που θα ήθελα με τον ήρωα αυτό όμως δε σημαίνει ότι η κεντρική ιδέα που ευλόγησε ο τεράστιος Μπόρχες δεν ήταν πραγματικά ενδιαφέρουσα.
Ο αναγνώστης καλείται να πάρει μέρος σε αυτό το πείραμα μέσα από τη δική του παράδοξη ιστορία αγάπης για μια γυναίκα που για εκείνη είναι ανύπαρκτος “Αλλά ερωτευόμαστε ενίοτε και ένα φάντασμα.
Προτού εκφέρω την ταπεινή μου γνώμη θα ομολογήσω πως τρέμω την ΚΟΙΝΩΝΙΚΗ ΑΠΟΔΟΚΙΜΑΣΙΑ!
Κατανοώ τα βαθύτερα μηνύματα και τα ηθικά διδάγματα που ήθελε να περάσει ο συγγραφέας όπως την παντοδυναμία της εικόνας αλλά δεν με τράβηξε ο τρόπος γραφής.
Η ιδέα ήταν (και είναι) πανέξυπνη.
Με κούρασε και η αναζήτηση της Φοστίν.
Ίσως δεν ήταν κατάλληλο ανάγνωσμα για την παραλία με τα μικρούλια να τρέχουν με κουβαδάκια και να σκαρφαλώνουν σε φουσκωτό μονόκερο (γαμώτο κι εγώ θέλω έναν).
'Ισως είμαι ακόμη αγκιστρωμένη στο Lost και περίμενα μία παρόμοια εξήγηση.

ilk defa okuduğum bir yazar. Kitabın önsözü Borges tarafından yazılmış olunca ilgimi çekti. Edebi dilinden ziyade anlatılan olayın ilginçliği dikkate değer. Başlangıçta sıradan bir ada hikayesi gibi görünse de okudukça soru işaretleri oluşuyor ve kitabın sonuna doğru anlıyoruz Morel'in neyi bulduğunu ve buluşun nelere mal olduğunu. Kısa ve dikkate değer bir kitap.
Μμμμμ όχι
It demands a second read (which I did) and probably a third (which I didn't do); its brevity belies the great depth that the author has brought to this story.
for just the tiniest smidgen of plot, you can click here:http://www.oddlyweirdfiction.com/2018...but really, and believe me here, you do NOT want to know anything beyond what I've said there until you've read it for yourself.Casares poses a multitude of metaphysical questions in this very short work, which, with apologies I also won't disclose for fear of ruining things; he also makes some interesting social and political observations vis a vis the narrator's interest in Malthusian theory.
Let's just say that it is one of the best and certainly one of the most surreal stories I've ever read, and to say that it was unputdownable would be an understatement.
