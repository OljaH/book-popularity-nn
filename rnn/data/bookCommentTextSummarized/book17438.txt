“I’m not a murderer,” she says. “I’m a slut, and you can’t be acquitted of that.” 4 1/2 stars. Aviva Grossman is “Florida’s answer to Monica Lewinsky”. A young Jewish intern in a congressman's office, she soon finds herself caught up in an affair with the older and married man. When the affair makes it into the regional media, Congressman Levin experiences some negative press, a few tut tuts, and then goes on to enjoy a lifetime in office. His marriage survives the scandal. Aviva, on the other
It's a fictional story, but it is hard not to notice the very real parallels - how Bill Clinton's marriage and career survived, how Lewinsky was torn apart by the media, and how even in the last election, almost twenty years after the scandal, jokes about Hillary not "blowing it" and how the last Clinton presidency "left a bad taste in [Lewinsky's] mouth" were extremely popular.Aviva is, in many ways, Monica Lewinsky reimagined, not as a sexy seductress, but as a foolish young woman dazzled by a powerful older man.
She is reimagined as someone's daughter, an ambitious student with a love of politics and, later, as a mother of a young girl herself.It's a powerful feminist story.
‘‘When they came at me, I kept coming,’’ she said.I didn’t think this book would be so powerful.
When Gabrielle Zevin included that scene with Ruby talking about men and people in general not getting out of the way first when you walk towards them, I was reminded of the time this happened to me…I normally don’t mind being the first to step away if need be.
I was going down, and he was going up, and I felt like it was his turn to let me pass.
Yet he kept coming at me, forcing me to step away first.
I'd rate this 3.5 stars.Living in the Washington, DC area during the Bill Clinton/Monica Lewinsky scandal, you just couldn't escape it—everything from news to gossip to rumors to hatchet pieces about Lewinsky, even spoofs of her on  Saturday Night Live  and other television shows. And while President Clinton certainly was the subject of a great deal of criticism, in many people's eyes, it seemed like Lewinsky was the only one to blame, and yet for quite some time you never heard her side of the
The narrative shifts from the time of the scandal to the present, and even includes a pseudo "Choose Your Adventure" section in which Aviva gets the opportunity to tell her side of the story.This is a fascinating book which shows how quick we are as a society to rush to judgment about someone, even if that someone is our own family member, and how we often don't realize how many ripples a scandal can cause in other people's lives.
J. Fikry: “Young Jane Young”, lacked the magical- spectacular specialness: MY HEART DIDN’T SING......but.....mostly, I thought this novel was funny!
In fact, I liked this book best when it ‘was’ funny - rather than thought-provoking and clever.
( which it was all three: funny, thought-provoking- and clever).
The part of this story that’s maybe most interesting - thought-provoking AND clever...is part 3.
( and I can’t decide if I liked this style or not .....if the crafting of the writing worked well or not).....I’m a little split on this section.
we are not ‘stupid’ readers ....WE KNOW THIS BOOK IS HEAVILY INSPIRED BY THE FAMOUS MONICA LEWINSKY SCANDAL.
Quick and enjoyable read, but I almost gave up on it in the beginning--so glad I stuck with it! Young Jane Young is about Aviva Grossman, a young congressional intern who had a scandalous affair with a married congressman (think Monica Lewinsky). This one mistake defines Aviva’s life. The fallout from the affair results in her changing not only her name, but also the course of her life. Of course the congressman, who was 20+ plus years her senior, escapes blame and shame free. The book is compr
Young Jane Young is about Aviva Grossman, a young congressional intern who had a scandalous affair with a married congressman (think Monica Lewinsky).
The book is comprised of the POV’s of Rachel, Jane, Ruby (Jane’s daughter), Embeth (the congressman’s wife) and Aviva.
Young Jane Young begins with the POV of Aviva’s mother, Rachel Shapiro.
Sometimes I get frustrated with shifting POV's, but I really liked the unique role that each POV played in the telling of Aviva's story.Young Jane Young explores themes of feminism, choice, mother-daughter relationships, and most importantly love.
Zevin has a special knack for breathing life into her characters, making them flawed yet still likeable as hell.“Once upon a time, I was easily touched and easily flapped.”“What happened?” she said.“I grew up,” I said.Now I know that I can always count on the author for getting me swept up into her works from page one.
It felt truly effortless, in particular, because of the combination of the many Jewish aspects and Yiddish phrases (farkakte, oy vey iz mir, alte cocker) that won over my heart in a beat.Thanks to my incredible excitement for a new Zevin novel, I hadn't even read the blurb or synopsis before starting, so I was in for a treat because everything that came at me I got to experience through fresh eyes.
Why does the man always come out of something like this ok and the young woman “like a punchline”?
Only idiots think so.” This is especially true in this day and age, when a google search can turn up anything and everything.
The book starts off from Aviva’s mother’s perspective and despite the consistent tone of Jewish humor, you see that Aviva’s affair is like the pebble in the pond.
Flip side, I found the Choose Your Own Adventure section to be a little too campy and cute.
But this is really a book about the women.
Young Jane Young didn't knock my socks off but it was entertaining in a smart kind of way.
Jane Young used to be Aviva Grossman, but in her early twenties she was involved with a congressman in Florida a la Monica Lewinsky, and the scandal went viral.
Zevin tells Aviva/Jane's story from a few points of view, including her mother, daughter and the congressman's wife.
And in the end this is what Zevin manages well in Young Jane Young -- she gives a human face to a scandal without making it overly maudlin, apologetic or trashy.
This story is a fictional account of a young lady named Aviva Grossman, who is Florida's answer to Monica Lewinsky.
I really enjoyed the story, but some parts about how it was told detracted from the experience for me.
I also wasn't in love with the "choose your own adventure" part towards the end, but I really enjoyed the rest from Rachel and Aviva/Jane.
Figures.This story consists of how the affair started, the aftermath, and the new life Aviva makes for herself after she cuts ties, changes her name, and moves.
This book offers perspective on each of the players, specifically the women, that is far different than what the news media portrays to the public, and is far more believable.
Looking back on the Bill Clinton/Monica Lewinsky scandal, I remember feeling very judgmental of Monica as a young woman.
And, you know, anybody who can judge Monica Lewinsky (or any young woman for that matter) has, on some level, lost touch with what it is to be young and to have made a mistake.
I’ve had heated discussions about this very phenomenon!]“Reading is like watching TV in your head.” [I’ll probably steal this line for a review!]“The only past you have a right to know about is your own.”“It is foolish to speculate what is happening inside another human’s shell.”And these two from Ruby, when writing to her pen pal:“An interesting fact about ‘painstaking’ is that it is pronounced ‘pain-staking’ when it should be pronounced ‘pains-taking’ because what you are doing is ‘taking pains.’”“Lower their inhibitions means people talk and drink and hug too much.”Complaint Board-A Jewish mom hounds her daughter, yada yada.
(I remember that the author got the kid voice wrong in The Storied Life of A.J. Fikry, too.) The 13-year-old Ruby was fine.
J. Fikry" on my favorites shelf, I'd been looking forward to Gabriel Zevin's next novel for the past several years.The basis of this storyline has been played out in real life more times than we'll ever know, with the scandalous Clinton/Lewinsky affair being the most infamous to-date and a permanent part of our nation's history.Aviva Grossman, a young, congressional intern in Florida, falls in love with her married boss and quickly finds out the meaning of "double-standard," when the affair goes public.
Things do go well, until the Internet catches up with them.This book is about Aviva/Jane, 13-year old Ruby, and the women who play significant roles in their lives.
YOU GUYS. This was completely different from what I thought it was going to be, but I think that ultimately lead to me loving it even more. This book was fantastic and feminist and just an amazing look at relationships between mothers and daughters and oh my lanta I loved this. WOW.
YJY has the same charm and depth as The Rosie Effect and substantially more of each than Where'd You Go, Bernadette.
In the interest of full disclosure, I'm not a fan of moral relativism and/or "I was young" uttered by 21+ year-olds as a rationale for adultery, and, still, I found YJY to be fresh and understated, with one caveat.
Having said that, if you are seeking humor-tinged contemporary fiction, YJY is a fast read and worth the annoyance of Zevin's mistaken choice to make Rachel, Jane's mother, a caricature, albeit a well-meaning one with a tragic lack of appreciation for boundaries.
To the young intern, Aviva, everything changes.
So she starts her life over, moves to a different state, and legally changes her name to Jane Young.
It’s now some years later and she’s a single mom to Ruby and the owner of a successful event planning business.
But secrets have a way of being revealed sooner or late and so is Jane’s.The chapters are split between Aviva/Jane, her daughter Ruby, and Embeth, the congressman’s wife, plus a short section by Aviva’s mother.
It’s very funny with snappy dialogue.I do wish the author hadn’t resorted to the 'choose your own adventure' chapters at the end.

It’s told in 4 parts and I loved every single one of them!
Definitely pick this book up!!
4.5 stars rounded upThanks Esil for recommending another fantastic book.
It's one of those rare finds that I've come to appreciate: light without insulting my intelligence, occasionally amusing and with a cast of interesting characters.The first chapters were probably my favourites because of Mrs Grossman, nee Shapiro, who was delightfully funny, with her dead- pan observations; it made me think of some of the characters in the TV Series Transparent.I don't want to give away too much, there's plenty in the blurb.
Such a great novel for anyone and everyone! Addresses feminism on all levels, all ages, with fun, intelligence, humor. Audiobook reader Karen White is stellar.

Find all of my reviews at: http://52bookminimum.blogspot.com/Young Jane Young is the story about the before, during and after when it comes to an affair that will sound pretty familiar to many of you .
Aviva’s mother, Jane, Jane’s daughter, the congressman’s wife and Aviva all took a turn at telling Jane’s (or Aviva – depending if you knew her before or after the affair) story and not even strangers on the street kept their opinion of the matter to themselves.
No matter what your definition of “is” is, this is a redemptive novel inspired by the ordeal of Monica Lewinsky.Zevin, the author of several novels for adults and young people, including “The Storied Life of A.J. Fikry,” has dramatically streamlined the complications of that byzantine political scandal.
“Young Jane Young” takes place in Florida, where a 20-year-old intern named Aviva has an affair with a handsome congressman, whom she describes in an anonymous and largely ignored blog.
Aviva is not seriously injured, but the resultant publicity ruins her life, while the congressman walks away with apologies for any pain that.

When my book club discussed Gabrielle Zevin's The Storied Life of A.J. Fikry two summers ago, I was the woman on the patio who was yawning into her glass of Pinot Grigio.I just didn't get how a story that started strong and had such a fantastic setting could wither into such a bland and colorless bore.Last week I ordered Young Jane Young, Gabrielle Zevin's most recent novel, with some trepidation, but I always think it's a good idea to give a writer (and a person) a second chance, and within minutes of starting it, I was pleasantly surprised.
As a big fan of The Storied Life of A.J. Fikry, I was very excited when I heard Gabrielle Zevin had a new book coming out, Young Jane Young.
I enjoyed the varying viewpoints of the women the story affects: Aviva’s mom, Rachel, Aviva’s daughter, Ruby, the Congressman’s wife, Embeth, and Aviva herself.
I remember reading reviews of this book earlier where readers didn’t care for the “Choose Your Own Adventure” aspect in one of the sections.
This didn’t negatively impact my thoughts of the book or the story at all, as I felt it was decided for you.
Young Jane Young didn’t top A.J. but I still really liked it.
After the word is out it isn’t the congressman left with the undesirable aftermath, it’s Aviva.
We follow Aviva as she moves as far away as possible, changes her name to Jane Young and reinvents herself.
Mother and daughter are close and Ruby has a lot of responsibility in her mother’s event planning (mostly weddings) business.
A good section of the novel is from Ruby’s perspective and it’s clever how Zevin writes this.Jane plans a wedding for a young bride, Franny, who may not be ready to jump into the married life and begin being in the political spotlight.
Special thanks to NetGalley and Penguin Random House Canada for the chance to read this electronic copy in exchange for an honest review.  “Young Jane Young” is the new novel from Gabrielle Nevin, the author of “The Storied Life of A.J Fikry”. I adored “Storied Life” and, to be honest, it would’ve been impossible to write a follow-up novel that would have settled anywhere close to it. That being said, “Young Jane Young” (although, as suspected, does not come close to “Storied Life”) is definite
“Young Jane Young” is the new novel from Gabrielle Nevin, the author of “The Storied Life of A.J Fikry”.
That being said, “Young Jane Young” (although, as suspected, does not come close to “Storied Life”) is definitely a good read with a passionate and powerful lead character.
Each character plays an important part in the choices Aviva makes.
A great follow up novel, “Young Jane Young” is for all of us- the ragtag misfits who don’t fit in, those who are looking for a life transformation, and those who simply want a character they can get behind.
When they are found out, there is huge backlash against Aviva, but very little towards the Congressman.
This book is a huge slap in the face to the slut shaming that goes on in situations like these!
The women have their flaws, no doubt, however, they feel incredibly real and relatable.
Even if the reader may not have made the same choices as these women, I think the reader can empathize with their choices through the context of the writing.
I highly recommend this book to all women, young and old.
Young Jane Young however is anything but cheesy: it is a powerful feminist story that calls bullshit on misogyny, and encourages us to do the same.Young Jewish Aviva Grossman’s life gets ruined when the world finds out about her affair with older and married Congressman Levin.
We meet Aviva’s assertive daughter Ruby, her well-meaning mother Rachel, and Levin’s wife Embeth, who stayed with him despite his affair(s).
What a powerful feminist message, but apart from that this is a clever, fantastic book about flawed women, the bond between mothers and daughters, and how one mistake can change your life, but not define it if you work hard.
I have been a huge fan of Gabrielle Zevin for years, and I love that each new book is so different from her previous ones.
While The Storied Life of A.J. Fikry will always be a tough one to best, Young Jane Young certainly holds its own.Gabrielle Zevin spoke at my local bookstore in September, and a portion of my book club went to hear her (Young Jane Young was our September book pick).
I had not read the book yet so I had the unique perspective of hearing various things about the story before I read it which made me enjoy the book even more.My favorite part of the book was the creative manner in which Zevin chose to tell her story.
YES! So much character development, so many great personalities, and so much stamina. This gives incredibly different generational perspectives and is impossible to put down once you pick it up.
The story is told from various points of view including the main character's mother, her daughter and the wife of the disgraced politician.
There are just too many unresolved issues that remain by the end of the book(how do Roz and Rachel become friends again, why is the politician late to his own anniversary issue, why doesn't Jane respond to her mother's phone call about her sick grandmother, when does Jane's stance on feminism change--does it?, etc.).
I really wanted to rate this book higher because I liked so much of it--the strong female characters, the plot points, the humor of it, but ultimately I felt let down by how little gets solved/addressed by the end of the novel.
