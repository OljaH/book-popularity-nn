“Man should be better than monsters.”“Ah, but who are the monsters?”  I have always had a soft spot for misunderstood monsters who are unreasonably feared. The key work here is “unreasonably”. When their life or the life of their beloved is threatened of course they are allowed to become vicious.And it’s not just me. I am sure that most of you know that there is a huge number of fans that enjoy PNR books i.e. paranormal romance, monsters’ erotica, erotic horror, fantasy books for young adult a
Books full of dearly loved monsters.
I consider "Land of the beautiful dead", "Heat" and "Cottonwood" masterpieces in the erotic horror category.
Not that before the 90s there were no books about monsters.
But you mainly felt sorry for them, not lust for them.I could definitely place this book in the above mentioned categories, however on the lighter side of monster romance fiction.
There is no gore, not much rejection by the plain and common humans because there is no interaction with them and the love story and sex are more implied and less described.The book is lyrical and emotional.
A beautiful love story.

Not only is TSoW a fantastical story of captured sea gods and thwarting the Man, it’s a complex social commentary—it’s remarkable how much was accomplished in just 312 pages.That being said, I did have a few minor issues, most of them spoilers, so don’t click the spoiler tag unless your prepared for the consequences:1.
It’s so bad that when I texted book bff about it, she not only immediately recognized my quote referencing it, she responded WITH THE NEXT LINE:(view spoiler)[If you think we’re exaggerating or oversimplifying or summarizing, you’re WRONG: (hide spoiler)]3.
O.oMe:  Someone loses a couple of fingers in an altercation with fish-man-creature.
Because, if not, you will be thinking weird shit, like me.
It sounds about right.As we learned in E.T., they want dissect the crap out of anything they don't understand.Luckily, the female mute janitor that cleans the den of horrors lab where he's kept is crazy and desperate pure-hearted enough to think she and the Swamp Thing are in love, so she decides to try and save it.
Yet, the extent of the communication between Swamp Thing and our heroine is actually less than Coco's communication and understanding with her human caretakers.
Parts one and two are mostly storytelling, atmosphere building, and character development.
Getting through the first two parts is worth it, once the story picks up pace and the excitement starts.
You can tell from the length of the chapters if it is going to be storytelling or action.
We also have POV chapters of his wife, Mrs. Strickland, but she is more of a connecting character, interacting with characters of the main story but never interacting with the main story itself.I didn't love Elisa but I didn't hate her.
Zelda has that spunk that I love to see in characters and Giles was just a sweet old man.
4.5 Stars.....After finally deciding to watch the movie (that I enjoyed MUCH more than I thought I would) just had to checkout what Guillermo del Toro did with the book....and so glad I did!....The setting is Cold War era America 1962, and unlike the flick, the novel begins with a human monster....Richard Strickland....assigned a dangerous mission in the sweltering jungles and rain forests of South America to locate and capture a legendary new life form, i.e. Gill-God...Man-Fish with supernatural powers.....Now, flash forward to Baltimore and Elisa Esposito....poor, lonely and trapped in a world of silence and isolation; she sleeps by day and travels by night to her graveyard shift janitorial job at a high security government laboratory.

Find all of my reviews at: http://52bookminimum.blogspot.com/ I hate that that’s my reaction to this book, but good god almighty was it a slog for me. And it sucks double because I obviously read it wrong being that the handful of my friends who have already read it really enjoyed it. I don’t know what happened. I mean, the story is one that’s been told a time or twelve before. . . . .  “Man should be better than monsters.” “Ah, but who are the monsters?” But that’s not something that ever deter
I hate that that’s my reaction to this book, but good god almighty was it a slog for me.
I mean, the story is one that’s been told a time or twelve before.
But that’s not something that ever deters me from a book (seriously, I’m totally the sucker gal who’s always going to be first in line for “the next Gone Girl”).
I want to loooooooove every book I read .
And that’s not a good thing.Stepheny opted for the audio version.
Ok lasst mich klarstellen: auch wenn ich laut goodreads fast einen Monat gebraucht habe um dieses Buch zu beenden stimmt das so nicht ganz. Denn eigentlich hab ich das Buch an 2 Nachmittagen beendet, nur lagen diese Nachmittage leider recht weit auseinander 🤷🏼♀Der Grund ist, dass das Buch meiner Meinung nach einfach nichts für nebenbei ist. Die Thematik und der Schreibstil erfordern einfach die volle Aufmerksamkeit und Konzentration des Lesers.Der Schreibstil ist zwar nicht einfach, aber so geni
Denn eigentlich hab ich das Buch an 2 Nachmittagen beendet, nur lagen diese Nachmittage leider recht weit auseinander 🤷🏼‍♀️Der Grund ist, dass das Buch meiner Meinung nach einfach nichts für nebenbei ist.
Unser Bösewicht Richard Strickland zeigt einem die Abgründe der menschlichen Psyche auf und das Buch behandelt so viele wichtige Themen: u.a. Rassismus, Homophobie und die schlechte Stellung der Frauen in den 60er Jahren.Das Ende war auch zu meiner vollsten Zufriedenheit!Was lässt sich sonst zu diesem Buch sagen?
Es ist einfach anders als alle Bücher, die ich bisher gelesen habe und will nun auf jeden Fall auch noch den Film sehen 🎥
We also get to know Zelda and Giles and the Russian scientist on a much deeper level as well.Now about that fish love, and I know that’s why you’re here, it works spectacularly in the book and it’s not at all “icky” (the ickiness only came from Strickland and his rotting fingers and garbage thoughts).
The romance develops too quickly in the movie for my tastes (I’m never a fan of insta-love even if the male is a Sea God) but here there’s time for it to develop at a natural pace as they communicate through sign language and his physical color changes that he controls to show his emotions and calm situations for anyone paying close enough attention - and Elisa is.
4.5 StarsBuddy read at  This was a beautifully told story about so many individuals that just didn’t fit into the time or place they were born into and how each touched the others life. I thoroughly enjoyed this story. The prose is beautiful and it helped me connect to each of the characters in a different way.

It makes me want to protect Elisa, our mute heroine that finds little ways to defy authority and be the woman she is.
Then there is Giles a man later in years who was born into a time where his sexual preference is deemed deviant and it has cost him so much be he remains true to the man he is.
By God, Giles thinks, it’s true: They are not so different from each other.
but then he got so much worse and by the end he felt like true evil.The Dovonian (fish guy) is fantastic.
Se ho assegnato due stelline alla Romano, a Zeichen e – per motivi opposti – alla Meyer, qui proprio non posso andare oltre la stellina singola: ed è così che il libro vince il premio per il peggior libro dell'anno, perché sarà difficile trovare di peggio.
A metà strada tra la favoletta, la sceneggiatura hollywoodiana e l'operetta stile Andrea Vitali, perfettamente nel solco di cose come "E.T." o "Splash, una sirena a Manhattan" o il più recente "Avatar": il pattern e il cast sono sempre gli stessi, i personaggi-stereotipo ci sono proprio tutti, non ne manca uno.
Not only is it a book, but it is written by Guillermo del Toro himself.
Surely this was going to be a perfect storm of creative genius that I would fall hopelessly in love with.WRONG.It’s 1962 and Elisa Esposita works as a janitor for a research center.
Of course it’s the beauty meeting the beast and falling hopelessly in love.
EVERYONE fucking loves Elisa.
As if this wasn’t enough, del Toro decides the story needs more.
It makes my head hurt.There were so many things that were beautiful about this book.
Eventually though, Kraus decided he wanted to finish his book without knowing any more about the film, so at that point both author and director agreed to each proceed with their own individual interpretation of the story.As a result, while there are many similarities between the movie and novel, there are quite a few differences as well.
Since neither he nor Elisa could speak in the film, audiences were limited with regards to the interpretion of what the characters were thinking or feeling, but this was obviously not an issue in the book where readers were actually able to experience the story from their perspectives.The writing was also beautiful, and there were definitely a few scenes in this tale where only the written format could do them justice.
Buddy read with the wonderful weekly UF Wednesday group over at BB&B.   To love,In its many forms and shapes.   The dedication of this book sums up so perfectly just what this book is about. It’s about being different, struggling in the box the world tries to force you into because it can’t understand and accept your difference and finally breaking free to fight for those you love.  I absolutely loved the beautiful writing, the amazing characters, their depth of feelings whether it was from

To love,In its many forms and shapes.

I absolutely loved the beautiful writing, the amazing characters, their depth of feelings whether it was from the villain’s POV (and what a despicable monster he is) or the few heroes and how everything showed just how immoral some humans can be but also how heroic, how good others are.
I can’t recommend this book enough.
READ IT.
Unfortunately for them, their love is in constant danger of being cut short by the horrors of the Cold War. An overzealous soldier plans on dissecting and experimenting on the doomed aquatic man, but Elisa wants to take a stand and save this newfound friend before it's too late.
This book was like a somewhat weirder version of the 1980's film Splash, in fact if not for a few details the two stories could be twins.
It's engaging and well-written, but some of it just seemed too far-fetched and awkward, especially Elisa's - um, "intimacy" - with the aquatic man.
The Shape Of Water was a strange book I got from the library on Audible. It started out fascinating but very gritty and rough. Then it varied between long boring periods and interesting scenes. I just couldn't hardly stand the slow bits at all! I really loved the premise of the strange story but the boring parts just drug it down for me. The narration was excellent however.
Wow, this was really well done.
I have always enjoyed his dark cinematic story telling and his unique way of portraying intrinsic lessons and observations about life.
I enjoyed the movie that is kin to this book but the book was phenomenal.
The descriptions of mind and atmosphere were beautiful and scary to behold.
The characters were very well done and it was wonderful to have the chance to be within their minds and to see more depth to their personalities.
I highly recommend this unique tale of horror and romance and life.
Like water, her love for the creature flows overwhelmingly that she resolves to free it from its captors with the help of her co-worker and friend, Zelda Fuller, and her next-door neighbour and gay friend, Giles Gunderson.I just love how Del Toro and Kraus created this complex, flawed characters — each of them transforming gracefully or retrograding to a path of destruction.
I'm sure that's true.But when I think of her - of Elisa...The only thing that comes to mind is a poem, Whispered by someone in love, hundreds of years ago: "Unable to perceive the shape of You, I find You all around me.
What a weird, magical, romantic movie! The colors (green and red) reminded me a lot of the french movie Amélie, but it's much less innocent. I thought that Eliza Esposito would be a Mexican who met the monster as a kid, and he marked her to know her later, and by the end she will be like him an Amphibian, and her voice would return to her... that didn't happen though, I guess my imagination is even wilder than the movie.
Poetic, beautiful, far more emotional than the movie. Some scenes were different than the movie but still, this is one of the few times where both book and movie have amazed me equally!
congratulations on the oscars! 👏🏼🎉💧🏆
The story line feels very unique and amazing. Its very odd and weird at the same time... A fish-god-man falling love with a mute girl.... 💖I'm so excited to watch the movie.
This looked to be similar and it was, the Guillermo Del Toro visual aesthetic was leaping off the page, the imagery was vivid in my mind, its sharpness boosted by the trailer.
I liked the book not only because I was intensely curious and eager to find out more but also because I enjoyed the flow of words.But after reading it all, I feel it was bland, in the sense that the whole story while appealing to watch I’m sure, on paper seems so uneventful.
This is where I feel the story lost its spell, more than halfway through I realized that we weren’t getting any answers about any of these things.
Doch schon bald muss sich Elisa entscheiden, was sie bereit ist für diese Freundschaft aufs Spiel zu setzten.
Der Leser wird an die Hand genommen und bekommt tiefe Einblicke in die menschlichen Hintergründe jedes Charakters.Ganz spannend: Guillermo del Toro und Daniel Kraus haben zwar zusammen den Plot entwickelt, dann hat aber del Toro das Drehbuch und Kraus das Buch unabhängig voneinander geschrieben.
Wer allerdings mit Konzentration und Ausdauer an das Buch heran geht, der wird mit einem mehr als überraschenden Finale belohnt!
My second movie-to-book-adaptation. Very satisfactory read (both). Why am I surprised that both (movies) were made by the same guy!I vote for more such movie-to-book things! There are so many that I would love to read as a story. If all the powers that be is/are listening i.e.
Please don't dissapoint me.
I wouldn't have read this book if it wasn't based on the movie .
If this was only a book , I wouldn't even have given it a chance.
No way anyone could have made me read this novel .
And I have to say this : Mr. Jimmy Kimmel took a crack on the movie saying that this year will be remembered as the year in which men screwed so bad that women started dating fish .
For both men and women .
When teenager girls started dating 100 year old vampires .
Not gonna lie, I just wanna read this for the fish sex and the cat eating.
