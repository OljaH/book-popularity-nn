It’s different than the other novels of hers I read.
The Great Alone was one of the best books I’ve read in the last several months, not to mention The Nightingale, which won about a million awards.
Both were very different than this novel about two sisters who grew up with a mother who drank too much and cared about herself, not her daughters.
There is more romance than some of Hannah’s other books.
This would make a great movie.
If not for the Hollywood big screen, it would make a great tear jerker made-for-TV movie.
Reading this book was like eating at McDonalds. It’s fast and easy but I feel so unpleasant afterwards.
PLEASE!Not 1 but 2 sisters after years of being alone fall in love at first site - uh huh that would happen.Then to top it all off Claire has a brain tumor and turns out the ONLY doctor in the entire country who can see that it could indeed be operated on instead of her dying - is Joe. Sorry I have to say it again...
PLEASE!The entire book is full of this type of thing.And of course they all live happily ever after.Maybe I am just way too much of a cynic to have found this enjoyable.
Usually I don't have to like a character to enjoy a book but she just rubbed me the wrong way and I felt annoyed during most of her parts of the story.
I did actually like Meghann, the sister who is emotionally distant and not painted in the best light, although I'm not really sure what that says about me.
I do like though how the book explored the sisters' relationship and how events of the past shaped who they were as adults and how they interacted with one another.
Overall, if you like Kristin Hannah's other books, you might as well read this one.
She’s also made some mistakes in her life that seem irreparable, leaving her with a very distant relationship with her younger sister Claire.
When Claire falls very suddenly in love with a musician Meghann is determined to try and make her see sense.
I thoroughly disliked this character.This is a story of family, love, friendship as well as mistakes and their consequences.
Even though I spent a lot of this book not liking Meghann or being able to relate to her, I still found this is an engaging read.
But then I am always prone to like books that provoke an emotional response in me.
I woke up with a major book hangover the morning after finishing this one. It was a top-notch read like so many of Kristin Hannah’s others. It’s an emotional story of two sisters finding their way back to one another after being sort of estranged. I laughed, I cried, I  felt.  Be warned - tears are inevitable.
Absolutely unrealistic. But I cried. That's good.
“If love is the answer, could you please rephrase the question?” Another great novel by Kristin Hannah!Between Sisters had a blend of romance, despair, and hope impacting a very dysfunctional family.Two sisters have been estranged for decades. Meghann Dontess and Claire Cavenaugh grew up together until events in their lives separated them. Meghann the oldest, took care of Claire when their mother was more interested in dating and later on acting than taking care of the baby. Meghann did everyt
Meghann Dontess and Claire Cavenaugh grew up together until events in their lives separated them.
Meghann the oldest, took care of Claire when their mother was more interested in dating and later on acting than taking care of the baby.
Meghann did everything for Claire but in the present, they don't even talk much to each other.
Claire Cavenaugh is a single mother.
She works hard at her father's resort.
The one thing missing is the love of a man.
It's hard to stop reading a book by Kristin Hannah.
Claire with her content and happy attitude.
Die Geschichte wird abwechselnd aus den Sichten der beiden Schwestern Meghann und Claire geschrieben und ab und zu erfährt man auch noch etwas von einem sonderbaren, geheimnisvollen Mann, den man lange so gar nicht zuordnen kann.
Es war alles zu lange zu geheimnisvoll und ich habe nicht verstanden, worum es eigentlich gehen soll.Kristin Hannah hat immer ein tolles Gespür für herzzerreißende Familiengeschichten, doch dieses Mal sind die Augen trocken geblieben.
Sobald man alles verstanden hat, ist die Geschichte aber auch schon fast vorbei und so fällt es schwer eine Verbindung zu den Protagonisten zu bekommen.Gerade weil das Buch aber gegen Ende hin sehr viel rausreißt, gebe ich noch 3 Sterne.
I picked this book up because I was horribly missing my sister who are really my best friends.
What I didn't realize until it was too late was these sisters in the book had a horrible relationship.
I did enjoy their relationship development but I wish there were more happy moments in the book than what we got.
I felt like his POV could have been left out and it would have made the book more enjoyable .
I did love the part he played in the book, but I felt like he didn't need his own chapters .
First time I read a Kristin Hannah book and was thoroughly impressed by her writing.
I couldn't seem to put the book down because I was always wanting to know what was going to happen next.
I was a little disappointed in how she wrote about the characters though in the sense I felt like we got to know who Joe was at the end of the book instead of at the beginning of the book.
I didn't have faith in Claire and Bobby's relationship at the beginning but as the story unfolded Bobby turned out a loving husband.Definitely would read another Hannah book again!!

This is a story of family disconnect, of sisters who lose touch, due to circumstances that are beyond the control of children so young.
The joy, the pain, the heartache, of life itself , come forth as the story progresses.
As the joys and heartaches that they face reveal themselves, I found that they were equal, that they were handed situations that, regardless of where you are in life, require strength and character to pull through.Of course, there is romance entwined in the story, which always adds that happy touch to Kristin's books!
It's 2 am and I couldn't go to sleep until I finished. I see a long list of Kristin Hannah books in my future reading. These are not my usual mysteries but are excellent people stories. The characters make you feel for them and care what will happen...which is why I ended up reading until 2 am.
She and Nicolas Sparks must trade notes on how to rip out their readers hearts all while weaving such an amazing story that you just can't put the book down!I just finished Between Sisters and let me tell you: I laughed and cried, screamed and groaned through the entire book.
She also convinces Claire to let her plan the wedding and their relationship grows from there.Add in a colorful cast of supporting characters, including their awful mother Ellie and Claire's loving father Sam, and this entire book is a "can't put down".
I can't take books like this where I'm sobbing through the second half but still unable to put it down!
I already went through that with your other book, Firefly Lane, lol.
I did enjoy the book, but felt like it was very over the top fairytale.
Sometimes its nice to read a book like that where everything works out just as we would want and its all wrapped up beautifully in the epilogue.
But sometimes its hard to read a book like that too, because its just not how real life works.
En sevdiğim yazarlardan biridir Kristin Hannah ... Hikayeleri, karakterleri hep sıcacık, samimi gelir bana. Kitaplarında karakterlerini tekrar ediyor görünse de seviyorum bu kadının kitaplarını."Sevgi, birbirimizin hatalarını kabullenmekten geçer."Kristin Hannah demiş ki , kitabın sonunda " Ben yaşlandıkça diğer kadınlara ne kadar ihtiyacım olduğunu anlıyorum. Kadın ilişkilerini yazıp durmamın sebebi de bu sanırım. Annelerimiz, kızkardeşlerimiz ve arkadaşlarımız olmasa ne yapardık? Umarım bu kitabı bitirdiğinizde gider kızkardeşiniz arasınız.."Bu kitap da çok güzeldi , sadece birazcık , kardeşleri bağlayan o olay gecikti, ama beklediğime değdi.
É o 2° livro que leio dela. Embora me tenha custado mais entrar na história deste, no final a sensação de ter lido algo maravilhoso é igual ao anterior. Com uma escrita extremamente simples, Kristin Hannah conta uma história super simples, que pode acontecer na vida de qualquer um de nós, mas que me agarra com uma intensidade que já poucos livros conseguem.Adorei as manas, a complexidade da relação delas.Faz-nos pensar nas nossas relações familiares.Adorei e recomendo.
Ndoshta fundin e librit e merr me mend që në faqet e para, por mesin e artë jo!Është ai që të rrëmben yllin e katërt.
Am Anfang hat es sich echt gezogen und ich war schon kurz davor, es abzubrechen. Aber jetzt bin ich wahnsinnig froh, weitergelesen zu haben. Mal wieder konnte mich Kristin Hannah extrem tief berühren und ich hatte so oft Tränen in den Augen. Ich habe gebangt und gehofft. Eine tolle Story über zwei Schwestern und die Liebe!
Review to come!
Hannah begins by emphasizing the completely contrasting lifestyles between the sisters by describing Claire as a party-girl who dropped out of college, versus studious Meaghan who got a law degree.
Claire who is just a simple girl who lives in the country, good with fixing things and is truly happy just being a mom versus Meaghan who is completely sophisticated as a work-alcoholic in the big city.
Hannah portrays that so well with her latest book showing the true bond of two sisters, broken apart by life, yet love pulls them and those around them closer together.

I think my standard may have to become three stars...maybe it's that a I took a big break from reading so anything I pick up right now that holds my attention is "super-fun" to me!
I'm in - I will now be reading all of her books!
The only thing I wish she had done differently was spent more time on the secondary relationship between the older sister and her man (I've already forgotten their names, my memory isn't the best...).
I liked that storyline and wished she had better developed it, seeing as though we got so much time as to why the sister was in therapy, etc.
A última parte do livro foi intenso, muito intenso. Emotivo ao ponto de me deixar de lágrimas nos olhos. Não fosse isto, acho que não teria sequer dado esta classificação. Aliás, pode -se ver pelo tempo que levei a acabar o livro, mês e meio. O que, num livro desta autora, não é nada normal para mim. Estive prestes a desistir dele a certa altura, mas fico feliz por não o ter feito.2 mulheres fortes, guerreiras, irmãs, que seguiram caminhos distintos, mas que um casamento aproxima.
"Die Nachtigall" war für mich ein historisches Lesehighlight in 2016 und ich habe seitdem sehnsüchtig nach einem weiteren Buch von Kristin Hannah Ausschau gehalten.
In der Verlagsvorschau des Aufbau Verlags entdeckte ich dann den Titel "Die andere Schwester" und war begeistert.
Somit stapft sie seit Jahren immer auf der gleichen Stelle und ergießt sich in Selbstmittleid und Härte gegenüber anderen.Ich wurde einzig von dem misteriösen Joe angetrieben, das Buch weiterzulesen.
Ich bin sehr traurig und enttäuscht, da die Werbung des Verlags mir hin ein falsches Buch suggeriert hat.
So jedenfalls war es leider nichts für mich.Fazit:"Die andere Schwester" ist ein Buch, das ich absolut falsch eingeschätzt habe.
Este é um daqueles livros para quando só queremos ficar no sofá a ler algo leve. Apesar do tamanho, a escrita da autora é tão fluída que se lê rápido.A história tem o chamado "amor à primeira vista" e isso incomodou-me um pouco. Achei irrealista a forma como se desenrolou depois disso. É uma história com alguns clichês, mas é uma leitura fácil, boa para descontrair.
Kein Vergleich zu dem letzten Buch -> die Nachtigall, aber trotzdem gut 3.5 ⭐👍🏼

As one of Kristin Hannah’s first time readers this book blew me away.
Between Sisters is a great book for a person who enjoys reading about romance, and likes a little suspense from time to time.
The way Kristin Hannah wrote the book with drama, love, and sorrow makes it different than every other romance novel.
Claire has always believed that her sister was more like a mother to her, and the occasion is reuniting the two and having them learn things about each other that they wouldn’t expect.
Her younger sister, Claire Cavenaugh, a single mom living in a backwater town in the Pacific Northwest, takes care of her five-year-old daughter and helps her father run his low-key lakeside resort.
Sam Cavenaugh was thrilled to be reunited with Claire, but Meghann suddenly found herself motherless and sisterless all at once, and numbed the pain by pouring herself into school, college and career.
Their absentee mom suddenly steps in to get him a recording contract, but before there can be a happy mother-daughter reunion, Claire is diagnosed with a brain tumor.
