Krasznahorkai, I am yours.Immediately after finishing the final eighty-or-so pages, in the middle of the night, I had to start re-watching the film based on (or inspired by) the novel, Béla Tarr’s Werckmeister Harmonies, because how can you just nod off to sleep after you’ve been so dominated and terrorized by a novel?
Even though Krasznahorkai cowrote the screenplay of Werckmeister with Tarr -- and it is a good film -- it is (sad to say) lacking even as an homage to the book or its strange, all-consuming power.
So under the bleak winter skies of a small decaying Hungarian town where the only colour that seems to be apparent is one of grey, asthick fog lingers at dawn, stray cats meow down dreary alleyways, rubbish is frozen solid to the ground and the sad townsfolk drag their weary bodies around passing abandoned vehicles left to rot in the streets (not to sound to stereotypical but the old Eastern Bloc does spring to mind), we follow a small group of residents mainly the helpful but week minded Valuska who has a number of odd jobs including delivering mail and taking hot meals to older locals.
Στο ερώτημα: πρέπει να εναντιωθούμε, να αντιπαλέψουμε την καταστροφή του κόσμου -έστω συνειδησιακά- ή να απολαύσουμε με κρυφή λαχτάρα τη μελαγχολία της εντροπίας χωρίς καμία αντίσταση -αφού τη στιγμή που αρχίζει η διαδικασία αποσύνθεσης δεν μπορούμε να επέμβουμε,η κατάσταση είναι μη αναστρέψιμη, και όλα θα ξαναρχίσουν απο το μηδέν.
Ξεκινώντας με την υπόθεση του βιβλίου τα βασικά χαρακτηριστικά του είναι η αποδόμηση των πάντων, η κατάθλιψη, η αδράνεια, ο φόβος για το επερχόμενο αόριστο κακό, η καταστροφή, η ωμή βία,η στρατιωτική κατάληψη, η εχθρότητα,το ατομικό συμφέρον.
Το κύριο αρνητικό μέρος του βιβλίου είναι οι δοκιμιακές περιγραφές σχετικά με την αρμονία της μουσικής και τη βιοχημεία της σαπίλας.

As we move from character (Mrs Eszter) to character (Valushka), the story deepens.
Then at about page 200 we hit this turgid wall of philosophical musing, by the musicologist again, and it stops us dead; and try as we might, we cannot, even after successive tries, move beyond it.
What makes a writer think he or she can abandon the reader even for a moment?
A friend here on GR has a shelf called "seduced and abandoned." Thus I file this one.
Krasznahorkai has some very brilliant and occasionally controversial ideas that he is compelled to tell you, and the reader will soon realize this novel is an allegory for his philosophical thoughts on existence.
The question of faith is brought up and Krasznahorkai shakes some ideas loose upon the reader.
Krasznahorkai is a verbal virtuosos and this should be read if only to view his ability with language and to marvel at how seemingly effortlessly he maintains a constant, unblinking flow through the few days that make up this novel.
theater was empty save me and the jewboy who invented the ripped shirt and 'blank generation' -- those were the days when i fancied myself some kinda punkrocker, i'd spend massive amounts of time chugging whiskey and thrashing around to ramones & bad brains & new order in low-ceilinged bars, hoovering coke in various dumpy bathrooms, receiving limpdicked blowjobs from stoned girls and boys, etc etc, and i kinda felt that i hadda talk to monsieur hell afterwards, offer to buy the talented bastard a beer under the pretense of discussing the film we'd just seen, and pull outta him all his great nyc-in-the-70s stories we've all heard, yes, too many times...
Don’t even think of attempting this on a train, a plane, a park, a doctor’s office or anywhere where you won’t be able to focus completely and fall face first into this absurd Hungarian nightmare.With about three paragraphs in the entire 300 pages, and just a smattering of sentences (I’m exaggerating, but not by much), Melancholy seemed to gush out of Krasznahorkai like a drunken folklore told over a campfire in the darkest pit of a forest.The first seventy or so pages were probably the best voyeuristic writing I’ve ever had the joy to read.
I mean, there's only so many musings I can take, and if a few political ones don't bother me - but rather interest me, pages and pages revolving around unintelligible ones (about music, about life, about freaking EVERYTHING) for no reason whatsoever I cannot stand.➋ I stated in my first review on Goodreads that "I was very uncomfortable with the fact that one character referred to the crazy rioters as "dark-skinned hooligans" - I did not gather that they were black from the novel (except at this very part), but if that's the case, it's a big no from me : you don't go and assign a race to the 'bad' people.
Ecco sì, c’è proprio una tristezza morbosa e ostinata attaccata a ogni singola pagina di questo libro, un pessimismo invincibile.Ma anche una lotta tra il caos e la ragione.
His visit is followed by a politically ambitious woman who praises Mrs. Plauf's objects while hypocritically deriding them in her mind.
Someone to guide me through these paragraphs snaking on for a page or pages with no sign posts.Posters herald a circus coming to town.
Beyond the people's fear that any change will only make life worse could the circus be an amphitheater for creation that grows and expands with the innovation of artistic creation?
Always unsettled Krasznahorkai knows he has the heart to follow the snake to its end.
Ook in 'De melancholie van het verzet' ontleedt en herschikt Krasznahorkai de wereld tot een nieuwe werkelijkheid die onze kijk op de gebruikelijke orde van de dingen - de orde tussen goed en kwaad, zeg maar – danig ondersteboven haalt en ontregelt.
Nochtans debuteerde de mediaschuwe Hongaar ruim dertig jaar terug met het succesvolle 'Satanstango', werden meerdere van zijn boeken met veel kritische bijval verfilmd door landgenoot en trouwe kunstbroeder Béla Tarr (waaronder ook 'De melancholie van het verzet' onder de titel 'Werckmeister harmóniák') en kan hij rekenen op de onvoorwaardelijke bewondering van een handvol invloedrijke literaire grootheden.
One of my difficulties with the book (and this isn't a difficulty that would dock a star, but a difficulty meaning something that haunts my thoughts, and probably begs for the book to be re-read at a later point) is putting my finger on what the failure of the two major characters Valuska and Eszter is.
The comic figure of Eszter really comes through in a scene where he is trying to board up the windows to his house.
Now no one is reading this so it doesn’t matter that I’m tongued-tied and confused how to express my feelings on The Melancholy of Resistance.
But I probably won’t because I know that it didn’t make me feel like reading The Melancholy of Resistance did.Some of the best times of my life are the times I’d see something in a movie that made me feel like I got something.
It’s really hard for me to feel like that.
It’s the seeing the life thing of others and feeling like the moments in your brain when your mental art is translated outside of you into how you are seeing others.
Tuy nhiên, dù màu sắc/âm hưởng chung của cuốn sách là đen, u ám, song, một cách có vẻ nghịch lý, khi gấp sách lại, chúng ta vẫn không khỏi cảm thấy tiếp tục tin ở con người, bởi vì, dù chỉ có một người duy nhất như Valushka mà thôi, thì vẫn còn chỗ để hy vọng ở loài người.
Μετα το συγκλονιστικο Πολεμος και πολεμος οι προσδοκιες ηταν πολυ μεγαλες οι οποιες ομως επαληθευτηκαν στο επακρο.

Where one can look up to see the stars.
And then wonder if up is really where we are looking.
...for the force of sheer velocity can know nothing of the nature of a speck of drifting dust...
Lots and then some more of synchronicity when reading this book and discussing postmodernism and specks of dust and gravity waves and sheer velocity.
Heterohegemony if you ask me.
The joyousness of resistance if you ask me.
She, who orchestrates a series of complex machinations behind the scenes worthy of a supreme Svengali, a masterful Machievelli: given advance warning of possible unrest, she decides to let the scenario play out so that she might intervene at the precise moment and ‘save the day’: too early and the plan comes a cropper, too late and her role will be swept into the disarrange of anarchy: plotting a tight high wire act, she calls in the army just in time, incapacitates the chief of police with copious drink, dispatches Valuska (the only person who might adivine her evil intentions) on a wild good chase, and, does it eight times (eight !!!!) with the army lieutenant Commander, in one night no less, which allows her to assume chief comrade secretary leader of the people something or other status.
Valuska, who has spent his life seeing the order of the world, listening to the music of the spheres, as it were, has joined the forces of chaos and is left with only disorder and his own silence.
He is now able to devote his days to doing so still living in denial of the reality around him.The book begins and ends with Mrs. Plauf, she who tried but failed to stay in her own ordered world, who created her own harmonious existence against the world around her, who refused to become part of Mrs. Eszter’s schemes and who, finally, as the book closes, brings closure to the reader.
So I am quite pleased to have found this (via Mike E, I should say).All the same, the novel itself is somewhat caught between stretches of extreme elegance, ultra-dry eastern european wit at misfortunes mundane and terrible, and formal cleverness -- caught between all of these and a certain tedium generated by long, unbroken passages of introspection, some of which require considerable repetition to get their gradual perspective shifts across.
Fitting source for a film with so many 10-minute sequence shots, this book runs in long sentences and endless paragraphs.
Meni se čini, pak, da je prvo trebalo prevesti Satantango, pa onda Melanholiju otpora, ne samo zbog hronološkog sleda, već i zbog toga što, uprkos prevodiočevom stavu, mislim da je Satantango tehnički uspeliji roman.
E, sad, postoji i nešto što mi je jako smetalo, a nisam bila sigurna ima li smisla isticati jer je ...
Čini se kao da postoje neki bliski kosmosi u kojima se odvija radnja ta dva dela, kao neke male apokalipse koje tinjaju sporadično svuda oko nas, nešto se događa i nestaje, a mi smo vrlo blizu i samo će nas zgrabiti i pojesti.
Οι προτάσεις που ξεκινούν και δεν ξέρεις πότε, πώς και σε τι κατάσταση θα βρουν εσένα και τους ήρωες του βιβλίου όταν τελειώσουν είναι πάλι εδώ, η περιρρέουσα ατμόσφαιρα ενός αμετάκλητου ζόφου επίσης, οι λέξεις μοιάζουν να κουβαλούν το βάρος της καταστροφής του κόσμου, είναι και πάλι όμως η μόνη σανίδα σωτηρίας σε ένα εσχατολογικό σύμπαν, ακραία σουρεαλιστικό μέσα στον ρεαλισμό του και το αντίστροφο.
Δυσνόητη μέσα στους συμβολισμούς της, η Μελαγχολία της Αντίστασης είναι κάτι παραπάνω από μια αναφορά στον Κάφκα, στον Μπέκετ, στον Μπέρναρντ και στον Μέλβιλ, όπως άλλωστε αναφέρεται και στο οπισθόφυλλο, είναι ένα ειρωνικό παραμύθι για τη σοσιαλιστική δυστοπία, μια πολιτική αλληγορία για το ανέφικτο της επανάστασης και τη νομοτέλεια της καταστολής κάθε μορφής αντίστασης, μια πικρή παραδοχή ότι είμαστε όλοι καταδικασμένοι σε μια "αδιανόητα μακρινή Δίκη, που καταβροχθίζει τα πάντα".
The Melancholy of ResistanceThe end of the world as we know it is drawing near.
What a strange time for a circus to visit our corner of the world.
That's how we know it's time to choose sides.
Although what the author does, he does it perfectly, I couldn't help feeling the melancholy of something great that resisted his pen.
It could be that I read it too fast and my mind was carried away by the flow of his prose, dedicating only a small part of attention to the story, but I felt something missing in the end.

My personal favourite is when Valuska,the book's holy fool, demonstrates the motion of the planets around the sun in the kind of bar only found only in Hungarian and Slav lit, 'the penny Riesling in their scratch-marked glasses...'.
I read for those moments of flying around the sun; me, my shelves, and last night's cabbage in the air, around and around.I used to be able to shell a lobster with my bare hands.
Is that day coming when I can't eat lobster anymore because I can't break the shells?I am so exhausted by this book.
Dolazak tajanstvene cirkuske trupe pokreće naizgled ničim izazvan talas bezumnog nasilja u provincijskom mađarskom gradiću. To bi najkraće, u jednoj rečenici bio opis radnje, ali iza svega se naravno krije mnogo, mnogo dublje. Provincijski, malograđanski, srednjoevropski, panonski, ravničarski užas, usamljenost, izolovanost, duboki osećaj nesreće i nezadovoljstva i ličnim i društvenim, spas koji se traži u ,,čvrstoj ruci'' sve je to smešteno između korica ove knjige. Ovo je prava književnost, i bez dileme 5/5 je ocena.
"Nella costruzione le cose restano a metà, nella rovina tutto è fatto fino in fondo." (p. 178)"Aveva visto miliardi di cose inquiete, pronte al cambiamento continuo, aveva visto come dialogavano tra loro severamente senza capo né coda, ognuno per conto proprio; miliardi di relazioni, miliardi di storie, miliardi, ma si riducevano continuamente a una sola, che conteneva tutte le altre: la lotta tra ciò che resiste e ciò che tenta di sconfiggere la resistenza." (p. 204)
Een van de personages in het boek komt via werkelijk geniale filosofische omwegen tot de conclusie dat de ratio in onze chaotische wereld wel degelijk bestaansrecht heeft, maar dan in voortdurende interactie met onze improviserende zoektocht in deze wereld: rationeel denken gaat steeds hand in hand met onbewuste reflex en dus beweegt ook onze ratio net als onze onbewuste reflexen alle kanten op.
Wat overigens wel ironisch is, want die formulering (die wellicht meer die van de verteller is dan die van haarzelf) is ook omkeerbaar: zij is de baas, maar van een stad die nog steeds door fragiliteit en chaotische onbestendigheid wordt geteisterd, zoals een rietveld, en dus is ook zij vluchtig als de wind.Het is werkelijk fenomenaal hoe Krasznahorkai in elke zin weer de chaos en onbestendige grilligheid evoceert.
Dat ik via deze weg af en toe iemand een boek kan aanraden, is mooi meegenomen, maar voor mij zijn deze recensies dus geheugensteuntjes.Recensies zijn grafzerkjes voor mooi gestorven boeken.
Sinds ik het uit heb (wat een ellendige formulering is dat) ben ik al een paar keer in een ander boek begonnen (het voelt als verraad), telkens schoof ik het na een paar bladzijden opzij om terug in die duivelse Krasznahorkai te beginnen, want bij herlezing wordt het alleen maar beter.Zeker, het is geen gemakkelijke lectuur.
Dit boek behoort tot het strafste dat ik ooit gelezen heb.
Vergeef het me als deze recensie geen recensie is, want ik ben nog aan het lezen.
Yet so many of us try to resist this knowledge, mulling over the persistently recurring question that immediately corrodes away by its lack of any validity or significance: should one protest against agonising decay or choose inner security by ultimate withdrawal from the world?
Despite everything, we are left with a faint sense of the titular melancholic resistance in the air - the reality that should have disintegrated like Mrs Plauf’s body refuses to give up its hopeless struggle and chooses, rather involuntarily, perseverance and for-now-stable, although quite dubious constitution of the new order.
I'm starting to think that when people say a book is 'in the tradition of Gogol,' they really mean 'it's set somewhere East of Paris but West of Tokyo.' I guess this is in the tradition of Gogol, inasmuch as it's satirical, and not from Western Europe.
But the point of Krasznahorkai's novel is not slight mockery-of-the-rurals.
Otherwise, this is the kind of book you really want to give people like me, who grow ever more tired of and bored with twentieth century 'realism.' There's nothing particularly novel here in terms of structure, or point of view, or meta-literariness.
There's just that language piling up and the depth of insights into human life.
Awake beneath the pestilential mangoworth-a-dime sobs:roil of dried pollen, devil’s conspicuousnessin the kitchen garden that led to leftovers.You have a chameleon close to your eara killer tongue about to tingleroughly and remind of recent pasts.In the movement of the earthgentle winds:trigonometric cityscapes, crystal balls.Like T’s absent rhymes. . .AABBB.
C'è poi chi la partita ha rinunciato a giocarla, come il signor Eszter, che si dichiara vinto e sceglie di chiudersi in casa accettando di essere stato sconfitto dalla vita e convinto del fallimento dell'umanità, dell'impossibilità di comprendere il disegno del creatore perché non esistono né disegno né creatore e l'universo è solo un alternarsi ineluttabile di distruzione e creazione, una lotta tra ciò che resiste e ciò che tenta di sconfiggere la resistenza, sul quale è inutile speculare.
Consider this, then, less a review proper then an account of a personal reading journey through the bleak and labyrinthine prose of one of the greatest writers in world literature today.������When Satantango was finally published in 2012 by New Directions, in a brilliant translation by poet George Szirtes, Anglophone readers finally held in their hands the very first novel by the mysterious Krasznahorkai.
And because Melancholy opens up a bit wider in terms of its structure than the earlier novel Satantango, one can see Krasznahorkai���s evolution as an artist more clearly when they are read in order of composition, not of translation.

Granted, the ending of the book echoes the beginning in a lovely way, and when I finished I felt wholly satisfied and frankly grateful to have stumbled upon Krasznahorkai, but starting with Mrs. Plauf didn't really gun the narrative engine - it felt to me like the novel proper didn't really start until Mrs. Eszter and Valuska entered the picture.*A strange circus exhibiting a dead whale arrives in a small Hungarian town, changing what might have been a typical exercise in hapless Eastern European village comedy into a terrifying and really quite affectingly sad investigation of nihilism and destruction.
Instead, the reader is led from one idea to another, back and forth in time, through the eyes of multiple people.
But you can't stop reading.
You are entirely within Kraszahorkai's universe.And there's a blue whale a scary mob and an extended discussion of music theory and this is what would have happened if Kafka had taken the most evil fucking speedball the world has ever seen and you don't know what's going to happen next other than that you probably won't like it very much in your gut but you're going to keep reading because that's what you do and at the end you know you're glad you did.
This was insane.
There's already so many good reviews that I'm not sure what I can add besides this was one of the best books I've read this year, and I've gone through some pretty great ones.
A book that starts off with the population of a town that's already given up on the things that govern society, and just keeps spiraling into a chaotic occurrence involving a circus and its followers.
There are no heroes in this narrative, just people who try to cling to the few comforts they have in an ever degenerating world where even nature seems to have given up, and a tyrant who engineers the situation to her own brand of fascism.
Suspenseful, menacing, bleak, exhausting, wry. Will re-read.
Laszlo Krasznahorkai explores this idea in his novel, “The Melancholy of Resistance” translated from Hungarian into English by the gifted translator, George Szirtes.
“The Melancholy of Resistance” follows the fear of change and the unknown following the arrival of a circus into a Hungarian town.
Using this theme and character set; Krasznahorkai examines philosophy and depth of thought making “The Melancholy of Resistance” multi-faceted and layered versus solely a singular-plot novel.
Krasznahorkai pens “The Melancholy of Resistance” in a strong stream of consciousness, ever-lasting flow style.
This certainly makes “The Melancholy of Resistance” not necessarily the ideal read (in terms of style) for everyone.
of course the book is kind of like trying to speed walk through the ocean, but i set a healthy 10-20 pgs at a time pace for myself so i didn't feel like i was trying to chew peanut butter for hours on end.these characters are amazing for their universality is central and yet they are so unique and strange and human (think of gogol's dead souls, all those weird land owners chichikov visits).
i initially thought that the circus owner was going to be the sinister one (like the judge from blood meridian) with his creepy whale, then it shifted to the factotum and "the prince", then it seems to turn out that mrs.
This book felt very similar to many novels I've read, but there was still something intangibly different.
As you've already read if you've seen any reviews, he has a similar flow to authors like Bernhard, Marias, and other purveyors of long sentences, but I felt something distinctively strange about this book.
He's fascinated by humans surely, and does a good job surveying the rabble that constitutes the majority of folk, but his interests also lie in the fact that we are floating around in a cold dead corner of the Universe.
A good test would be to try to read the intro.
Ένας χείμαρος από λέξεις που απλά πετάγονται μπροστά στον αναγνώστη και τον τραβούν μέσα του.
Δεν θα πω τί περίμενα και τί δεν περίμενα ή ποιά είναι η ιστορία...Ίσως οι προσδοκίες μας όταν διαβάζουμε ένα βιβλίο που "απλά έχουμε ακούσει καλά λόγια" να είναι μετρημένες στα δάχτυλα του ενός χεριού, ίσως πάλι ο αναγνώστης θα πρέπει να ακολουθεί το ένστικτό του και να αφήνεται στα χέρια του συγγραφέα.
O Kraszahorkai αυτή τη φορά κατάφερε -τουλάχιστον στην δική μου ταπεινή αναγνωστική δυνότητα-να με κάνει δικό του υποκείμενο, να με τοποθετήσει στην ουγγρική πόλη που ζουν ο Βάλουσκα, ο Χάρερ, ο Εστερ και η κυρια Εστερ.
Θα αδικήσετε και τον εαυτό σας και την ίδια την ιστορία.
I hate to say it, but this has become one of those books that depresses me whenever I see it.
For months I kept it by my bed, a constant reminder that I’d stopped after two chapters and should get back to it.
(Chapter Two: thirty pages of skewering petit bourgeois values – like shooting fish in a barrel.) Then I started it over again and got halfway through before putting it aside.
For more months, it lived on my desk, bookmark in place.
But I’ve conceded defeat and put it on the shelf, bookmark removed.
I was impressed by the first chapter; it was vivid, and funny.
"This" "Author" "Loves" "To" "Put" "Things" "In" "Quotes"...I am not sure the point of this, but it can get kind of "annoying"..."See" "what" "I" "mean".....As far as the story goes, pretty good so far, though I do not know what's going on really...I hope it will reveal itself to me...As far as I know, some old woman was being chased on a train and harassed by an unshaven man in an overcoat..(this was a pretty interesting scenario and well described)...then she is at her apartment and some friend she hates comes over and is harassing her...then she went for a walk, gets harassed some more and then sees a huge trailer driving through the town with some weird circus...then she has a monologue about some revolution shit and apathy or something while walking near the center of town while some dudes hang around fires and harass her yet again.
