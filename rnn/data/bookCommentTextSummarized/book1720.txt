The very thing that other reviewers didn't like about this whopping novel was what made it another of my great reading experiences (which I remember like the memory of passing through something tremendous as if it was the Grand Canyon and not a novel at all) : they didn't like, but I did, the painful awful awe-full inevitability of the events, the doom of the characters, the dance of death we get drawn into for the last 200 pages - it's a quadrille, very formal, the partners are the characters, the plot, the author and ourselves, us, the readers.
Our parents also just happen but in general we feel it is necessary to unlearn whatever it is they've taught us to want, especially if it involves "an unimportant-looking family publicly raising its collective voice against the vast skepticism [sic] and apathy of life."Learning from strangers is frequently regretted in later life but always welcomed as it occurs.
What we learn from strangers, what we are taught to want, is what has been identified since ancient times as vanity.
For them Africa, surprisingly to modern minds, represented the future, for which they, and we, are permanently unprepared by experience.So Clyde is in fact incapable of learning from one stage of life to another.
This is because Clyde's form of vanity, adopted in youth and refined with maturity, is ambition.
Read this book...Theodore Dreiser’s 900 page tome moves slowly--but inexorably--like constellations at night--slow, but grand and beautiful, and holding all types of matter in the sky.
Dreiser maintains this requiem, not so much like an author removed from the pages, simply recording words on paper, but like someone within the story, just as curious, anticipatory and beguiled as the characters in action.
I surrender to epic writing that, like an asymptote, nears the f*cking wicked essence of real human tragedy.
I found myself rooting for his character to, literally, get away with murder (and the murder of a very nice person, too.) The last portion of the book is especially gripping as we learn Clyde's fate.
As Clyde's story unfolds we are witness to scenes of drab poverty, lavish luxe life, the cheap thrills of brothels and booze ups in the big city, the bucolic amusements of mid 20th century rural life, the power of lust and greed, but also of faith and love and the fact that we have no choice but to go on until the end...whatever that end might be.This book was a panarama...the story of a life...and one worth reading.
Book Circle Reads 24Rating: 3.5* of fiveThe Book Description: On one level An American Tragedy is the story of the corruption and destruction of one man, Clyde Griffiths, who forfeits his life in desperate pursuit of success.
On a deeper, more profound level, however, the novels represents a massive portrayal of the society whose values both shape Clyde's tawdry ambitions and seal his fate.
Clyde Griffiths is a young man, from the poor branch of his family but with ambitions of making the big-time; and seeks a start in his rich uncle's factory.
Meeting the rich girl at a family function at his uncle's home makes him suddenly regret getting involved with Roberta, and he feels trapped.
Or as Dreiser later puts it, Roberta "yielded to [Clyde's:] blandishments." I know, that probably got you a little worked up.
Sondra actually comes to love Clyde (in one of the book's great surprises, she turns out to be a surprisingly deep, multi-dimensional character; up till that time, all of Dreiser's young women are of two types: the first is a rich girl who is trying to figure out how to leverage a man into a better social position; the second is a poor girl trying to figure out how to leverage a man into a better social position).
This way of writing makes the speed of the novel extremely slow!
Important content!Themes focused upon are religious salvation, one's social standing, politics, capital punishment, adultery, murder, guilt, court proceedings and judicial biases, the importance of education.
The book certainly does show you clearly why what happens happens and why Clyde, the central character, ends up in the mess that he ends up in.
He switches tone, just as the lines of the book's text do.
But those are the lines that Dreiser puts in the novel.
"Well is it known that ambition can creep as well as soar."Edmund BurkeI'm relatively sure that in 1925 this novel was bleeding edge: based on a true crime, mixing an omniscient narrative, mostly of the anti-hero Clyde Griffiths' inner thoughts, with some reportage.
While this was probably sensational in the late 1920s after its publication, it pains me to say that our society nearly a century later including me, in all matters besides local, has become almost numb to such reported true life crimes except when the reporting goes much deeper into the criminal psyche or provides more salacious details (which wasn't the case here).
The tragedy is having to have read those 930 pages....
An American Tragedy is one of the short-listers in the never-ending competition for the honor of Great American Novel.
Yes, I know some say Moby Dick has it wrapped up but I just can't identify with psychotic captains obsessing about big fish.
Dreiser's massive novel resonates with me.
Even though its morals may be dated, the themes of class conflict and the struggle of desire over conscience still speak loud and clear.
The only reason why I give this four-an-a-half stars instead of five is because the trial portion and the end being dragged out .
Then kidnap them, take them to a house stocked with all the provisions you can get, and force all of them to read a copy of An American Tragedy, because I don't care how verbose you are, you will never reach the heights of Theodore Dreiser.People think books like Infinite Jest or Les Misérables are longer than they need to be, that they contain too many sections that could be pared down.
Other topics that Dreiser takes on are the not-so-just justice system, organized and independent religions, the shallow lives of the wealthy, the press and many more.The novel begins with a look at the constricted life of fifteen year old Clyde Griffiths, who escapes his family of street corner missionaries, looking for a way to participate in the trappings of the wealthy.
It ends with a claustrophobic world that consists of Clyde's mind and psyche, and his living space of under a few hundred square feet.
I picked it up because it took place in the Adirondacks (both the book and the event), and that's where I live.
This book raises dullness of style to sublimely convoluted heights. It's really one of the oddest books, stylistically, I've ever read. I read it years ago and I still can't pinpoint the source of this oddness, though I suspect it's the sheer complex awkwardness of the prose, which reminded me of something Henry James might've written if forced to type into a BlackBerry with his elbows.
Audio #53Driesler took entirely too long to get to the point. The story seemed almost overdeveloped. It's based on the true story of the Cigar Girl. (Look up the book written on the murder case) the factual account is much better
It is also the personal story of Clyde, the protagonist -- a selfish, self-absorbed social climber who places more value upon wealth and luxury than upon human feelings.The characters in this novel are so clearly portrayed that the reader feels s/he would recognize them if seen in person.
Marvelous!The author, Theodore Dreiser, is a master of writing and story-telling -- so much so that this was my second reading of the book.
An incredible read and a page turner.
Based on actual events in the lake areas of the Adirondacks in upper NY state, I read this with the Classics for Beginners group.
Dreiser's pure genius is that he makes the reader become very sympathetic with the protagonist Clyde Griffiths, son of religious evangelists who preach on street corners and are even poorer than church mice.
Clyde wants, wants, wants.
The true villain of the piece isn't so much Clyde - though he does do bad things - but American society.
I can see myself re-reading it in the future.
Make no mistake;  An American Tragedy  is long and often times obsessive in its detail.
There are approximately 500 pages of exposition leading up to the climatic moment!
Yet in my moments of weakness, when I felt like I just couldn't go on, the story of Clyde Griffiths and his struggle to claw his way up the American social ladder was enough to keep me going.
Clyde is the perfect combination of ruthless ambition and childish naiveté.
His dogged attempts to circumvent all the socio-economic factors standing in the way of his success and his eventual comeuppance made this novel worth all the effort.
Book One: in which Clyde pursues abuseBook Two: in which Clyde bestows abuseBook Three: in which everything in book one and two is repeated for the reader's abuse

So, instead, I think Dreiser basically hated everyone he was writing about, and couldn't bother to really get inside them or to humanize them, because then we (and more importantly, he) might come to like them.As for the story: there's probably an OK short story here.
Except perhaps for this: if the uncle's factory had allowed for dating of the workers, Clyde would never have broken into society, and might have settled for a humdrum, boring life with Roberta.I've seen some people praise this for the candid look it takes at sex.

💝FREE on Amazon & on iBooks today (7/3/2018)!💝Blurb:Ambitious, but ill-educated, naïve, and immature, Clyde Griffiths is raised by poor and devoutly religious parents to help in their street missionary work.
As a young adult, Clyde must, to help support his family, take menial jobs as a soda jerk, then a bellhop at a prestigious Kansas City hotel.
Enjoying his new lifestyle, Clyde becomes infatuated with manipulative Hortense Briggs, who takes advantage of him.
After being in a car accident in which a young girl loses her life, Clyde is forced to run away from the town in search for the new life.
I had no idea at the time I picked this up that it is supposed to be one of the most important American novels of the 20th century—and so I read it without any preconceptions, and enjoyed it all the better for that.
Despite the somewhat archaic quality of the writing I enjoyed the book, which comments on the permutations of class distinctions, equality, status and social ambition.
I also enjoyed it because even though I already had a vague idea how the story was going to end (it's based on the real-life murderer Chester Gillette), I still found myself at various moments rooting for Clyde, hoping he would make the most of the opportunity his uncle had given him and prove all of society wrong.
I can't believe I hadn't found this classic before. What a great read this was! Started off strong on page one, and with the exception of the court scenes, continued strong through out all 850+ pages. Once I got it started, I couldn't put this book down. The author was masterful in laying out the storyline slowly and methodically without wearing it down. Simply loved it.
I've seen Lithuanian TV series, and they were great, and -♥- Gediminas Storpirštis is so handsome.
This was just relentlessly sordid, from page one - a shabby family preaching and singing itinerantly on the streets of Kansas City, to the son Clyde's bell-hop job, where he falls in with a brothel-visiting crowd and is conned by a golddigger, to a deadly hit-and-run accident that shapes the rest of Clyde's life, to the factory floor of his wealthy uncle, and a series of rooms in rooming houses, an unplanned pregnancy, a dilapidated farm and its decrepit owners, and lies upon lies upon more lies.
I am sad. Seems somewhat appropriate to start this book today in light of recent events in California...
251)Theodore Dreiser’s behemoth of a novel, An American Tragedy is a mostly annoying read, with only about the last third being worth the effort.My first annoyance came with the excessive use of the two word phrase, and then; often as the opening of a new chapter.
An electronic search for this phrase, in my Kindle eBook, found that it was used a total of 586 times in all 857 pages—almost once every page and a half, on average.
“This, then, most certainly was what it meant to be rich, to be a person of consequence in the world—to have money.
But for the time it was written (1920's) this book touches on taboo topics that still stir emotions in many Americans in our current time such as abortion and capital punishment.
It is an amazing social study of the lengths that people will go to to achieve the American Dream.
If you really can't get through it then go to your local video store and rent "A Place in the Sun" for the cliff notes version (which is actually an adaptation) because the actual events taht inspired Drieser to write this novel are pretty that inspired the book is actually quite moving.
The tragedy of the American Dream26 December 2011 I'm sort of in two minds about this book myself. While it is a tragedy in the traditional sense, it does not really stand up to the great tragedies of Shakespeare, Marlowe, and the Greeks. The story is about the downfall of the main character, who is a tragic hero in all senses of the word, but it does not have the intricate and complicated plot that the tragedies of Hamlet and King Lear have, nor is the character of Clyde torn and haunted in the
The story is about the downfall of the main character, who is a tragic hero in all senses of the word, but it does not have the intricate and complicated plot that the tragedies of Hamlet and King Lear have, nor is the character of Clyde torn and haunted in the same way as Macbeth and Dr Faustus.
What we have in An American Tragedy is young Clyde getting his first job as a bellhop, but while working at the hotel, he falls in with the other bellhops, and the desire to succeed is balanced out by the desire to have fun, and through this he falls into alcohol and prostitution (both of which were illegal in the United States at this time).
