Although on the surface it appears to be a mere bagatelle, it is also a sophisticated exploration if the idomatic structures of the English language.It is in the form of a monologue by a narrator who wishes to warn us about an imminent alien invasion.
However, when he begins to explain his “evidence,” the reader realizes that the narrator is indeed paranoid, and that his paranoia is result of interpreting the metaphors of idiomatic English literally.Initially, it is the reference to eyes which disturb him, how they “slowly rove about the room,” how they “move from person to person,” until they “fasten” on one.
The inside of Philip K Dick's brain is an amazing place.
Later, after continued reading sessions of the book outside his house, i.e. his usual frame of reference, our narrator is so wrought up that he seeks solace in a game of Monopoly with his family, playing with “frantic fervor” and not wanting to know anymore about the silent invasion going on, which is probably “under control”, anyway.One may treat this tale as a humorous whim set into words by the author, but in a way, the story kept my mind busy and me wanting to get my head around it – oh dear!
Metonymy at the outer limits. Also, the amorphous structure and expectations of some science fiction.
A short short story, by an author I have seen mentioned many times but have never read. I will reserve judgment on the author's work in general until I can read more of his work, and longer pieces. This one was cute: an example of what can go wrong in a reader's mind if he takes the words on the page too literally.
It takes me quite a while to figure out what's going on and when I get his trick my mind goes like, "AWWWWWWWW!"
Geeky Paranoid Protagonist playing literally with the workings of English words. Quite funny and enjoyable wearing his shoes.
Very short whimsical piece. In the hands of Pratchett it would be an amusing episode of word play, with PKD it is resonant of mental illness. Purely down to my reading history.
Not a book. A short story written by Dick. His twisted view and sense of foreboding is absolutely on point! Great story.
Read as a part of  Minority Report and Other StoriesThis was clearly a tongue in cheek, very short story which takes us through a man's thoughts as he takes phrases he reads in a book, like "He gave her a hand" and "Her eyes followed him up the stairs", literally. So the man thinks there's an alien race on earth that can take off their body parts and organs which inevitably leads to a humorous freak-out.

Somewhat funny and interesting to think about. The belief in an alien invasion has shaped the way the narrator sees reality, even mediated through text. Could make for an interesting linguistics or philosophy tale.
outside the conjugal frame) and read in a garage contains no language that is not already familiar from ordinary life, yet somehow this book serves to defamiliarise the language and to reveal a "hidden" content, one that is hidden in plain sight.The unfamiliar world that the narrator is initiated into is one where the Earth has been infiltrated by aliens in human form, going about fairly ordinary human activities, These aliens differ from us in that they do not have a unified body organised hierarchically with the brain as hegemonic organ.
This is such a cute little story.
It's all about the use of idioms in English, and although the gimmick of taking these things literally isn't drowning with originality, it makes for a good laugh, at least for someone interested in language like me.
It is interesting, if rather logical, that our use of idioms is quite often related to our bodies.
One thing is wondering about the effect - does it make us more disconnected and detached from our bodies?
This is great for that little spark to ponder amusingly over language.
How literally the character took the lines, made up of metaphors and similes (ex.
poor Bibney has lost his head...he has utterly no guts..etc), of the book he was reading made me giggle.
According to the protagonist's understanding, the characters of the book he was reading were disintegrating into parts, encouraging him to think that they were non-terrestrial and that they were invading Earth.
He reminds me of some people I know who take my words very literally.
To them, figures of speech are unfathomable heaps of words.
Brilliant! Every writer should read this short. Philip K. Dick is generally known for his excellent science fiction, of course. In this short and funny piece he makes a gentle but telling attack on those authors who fail to understand where the line is drawn between metaphor and reportage. If you enjoy literary humour and have a taste for jokes made at the expense of those who don't quite understand how language should be used, you'll love this little gem. I did. Great fun; with a message for all of us who write.
This delightful little short story will only take you a few minutes to read, but it's brilliant. Dick plays up a theme of something we all do when reading a novel, misunderstand and take to literally the context of bad writing.While reading this I guffawed several times, lough enough to interrupt my cats naps. Take ten minutes and read this, you won't regret it.
Haha. This was hilarious. I guess this is how an author trolls another. The author is clearly being a Dick in writing this lolworthy satirical essay. Excellent educational stuff for writers and aspiring writers.
This is why I seek out PKD, for satirical, humorous little gems like this one.
Read as part of Minority Report and Other Stories.Extremely short. Also written in 1953.Seems PKD has a lot of weirdness going on in his head.
Free podcast. Amusing little story, reminds me of Mark Twain.
Funny, short and interesting. Take 10 minutes out of your day and read it.
This is fun..great one for use in school, good example of sci-fi..
Quirky amusing short story.
I really like the writing style ..though it is very short
The one I read was a collection of two stories. The first one is so funny, because it tales the use of language in a novel and turns around its meaning, until it unveils a terrible conspiracy from aliens. I found it really witty.The other story theme is the result of a human colonization over planets that belonged to an alien race. When the aliens fight back, the life of a boy changes dramatically because those who he considered his friends are no longer the same. A great story.
قصة قصيرة جدا تدور في عقل البطل الذي يفهم عبارات اللغة حرفية ..مثل " عيونه تدور في انحاء الغرفة" ، ،، هنا يفهم البطل ان العين انفصلت عن الجسد و تحوم في ارجاء الغرفة ..استغرقت بعض الوقت لاستوعب فعلا ماذا يقصد 😀😀
More closer to reality, this is how a common man would go about it.
I found this story to be delightful, very humorous, and easy to read. It reminds me of my English as a foreign language who misunderstand the languages they take. more literal reading.
Language at its most fun. Fantastic.
