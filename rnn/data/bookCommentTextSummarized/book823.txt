A life well lived and well lovedI have heard of Amy Carmichael for years now but didn't read any of her books until now.
I don't know why I picked this one, assuming it was about her ministry in India and it was, in part, but mostly it is a short biographical tribute to her dear friend, fellow worker, right hand sister in Christ, Ponnammal.
The love that Amy had for her friend, and she for her, and both foremost for Christ is almost palpable.
I am eager to read more of Amy Carmichael's books.
At first I thought this would be about one of the children they had saved but it wasn't. It was the story of one of Amy Carmichael's co-workers. It tells of Ponnammal's early life, her decision to follow God whatever the cost, the ministry she had rescuing children from the Temple, and the way she faced her own death.It's worth the read.
I loved this book!
Sweet and beautifulJust beautiful and so moving it moved me to heavenly tears. Just read it, you never be the same. Trust me.
