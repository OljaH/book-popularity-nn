Set in Depression Era San Francisco and introducing the world to Samuel Spade, Hammett's The Maltese Falcon became a detective story that many in the genre still try to measure up to today.
A classic that helped change the way writers told detective stories, The Maltese Falcon is a classic case that contains all the elements of a fun whodunit.
Drawing inspiration from his own life, Hammett created Samuel Spade, a private eye detective who saw action in Europe in World War I.
The Maltese Falcon is a classic detective noir story and fun whodunit.
Sam Spade is anything but – an outsider to the police, district attorney and even his clients, Sammy is his own man, cracking the case in his own way, in his own time and even willing to get socked in the jaw by a police lieutenant or pulled in by a high ranking official to make it happen.5.
The Moral Code – As one character finds out the hard way, Sam Spade is a man of the high, uncompromising character.
But what does Miles Archer's murder have to do with the client he was working for or the mysterious Maltese Falcon?What can I say about one of the Big Two pulp detective novels, the other being The Big Sleep?
Well, let's see...The Maltese Falcon embodies a lot of what made pulp detective fiction great, leading to hordes of imitators.
Honestly, my only complaints are that there aren't any more Sam Spade books and that Dashielle Hammett wasn't Raymond Chandler.For a parting thought, this line of dialogue nicely sums up Sam Spade's character:"When a man's partner is killed he's supposed to do something about it.
Everything seemed separated for the first sixty pages, with no connection whatsoever. But the story was full of suspense and unfolded with many surprises after that. The plot was very captivating, and seemed very realistic. The main thread is 'Maltese Falcon' (I'm not going to tell you what it is, as it would be a spoiler and I hate to give spoilers) around which everything revolves. Its a good read and keeps you guessing till the last.Highly recommend!
I enjoyed Dashiell Hammett’s The Maltese Falcon.
I’d seen the movie; however, this was my first read of Hammett’s iconic detective story.
I’d often linked Hammett to Raymond Chandler and works such as The Big Sleep which introduced the detective, Philip Marlowe.
Chandler’s work comes 10 years after The Maltese Falcon.
The grittiness and atmosphere-laden scenes I associate with these early works finds its way into lots of science fiction (some of which I’ve read like China Mieville’s The City & the City and Philip K.
The down payment was good, so the detectives took the case, no questions asked.
As the direct result one of the detectives - Sam Spade - got to experience all of the traditional noir fun while readers follow ever-twisting plot.
I said it countless times before and I will say it again: Sam Spade is the grandfather of all PIs in all noir, in particular all Californian PIs - Raymond Chandler's Philip Marlowe included.
For those doubting Hammett's paternity of noir I can say the following.
It is most probably a safe bet to say that Sam Spade made Philip Marlowe possible.
Related to this is the fact that while the traditional mystery genre sees crime as an aberration of the order of things, which can be detected and set straight by the application of reason, noir views crime as the norm and denies that reason and logic can do much with it.
(It isn't as surprising as Christie's solution in The Murder of Roger Ackroyd --but it comes close.) A valid criticism might be that the San Francisco setting isn't really evoked very strongly --beyond a few place names and isolated details, the locale could be the mean streets of any city of that day.

It's a game-changer for the genre and that's why it's called the Golden Age. For mystery fans, you better have read this one.
For non-mystery fans, it's a good story, and if you like older books, them you should give it a chance.

"I don't mind a reasonable amount of trouble.”I haven't seen the famous movie version of this book starring a young, dreamy Humphrey Bogart, but now I sure want to.This 1930's noir beauty set the template for hard-boiled detective stories, paving the way for other writers like Raymond Chandler and James M.
The characters are just perfect, one of the more memorable ones being the mincing Joel Cairo whose voice on the audiobook that I listened to sounded like the python "Kaa" from the Disney film The Jungle Book.It's so stylish and distinctive, not to mention cinematic.
That's right, skedaddle and quick-like!Private detective Sam Spade smells trouble when a crazy dame walks into his office, and sure enough, his life is soon turned topsy turvy.
Spade gets all tangled up in a fishy double murder.
If things keep up like this somebody's gonna get themselves killed dead.Since the book's publication, the Spade character has become the ideal from which all other hired sleuths to follow would be molded.
No, he's in it for himself, yet only gets what he deserves (often a sock on the jaw) and somehow still comes out smelling like roses.
No soy muy amante del género negro pero este libro me ha encantado :) No me extraña que lo hayan llevado al cine en varias ocasiones, ya que nunca sabes por dónde saldrá el escritor. Será cuestión de buscar más novelas suyas ;)
While navigating all of these rather unlikeable characters (I think the receptionist is the only “good” person in the book), Sam has to figure out where the statue is, who killed Miles and try to pocket a few bills as well.
I look forward to reading some other Hammett books, like The Glass Key and The Thin Man.* By today's standards, reading the descriptions of Joel Cairo with his mincing walk, his use of perfume and his "high-pitched voice" – and the sneering, dismissive way the other characters treat him and call him "queer" and "a fairy" – is difficult.
Dashiell Hammett’s The Maltese Falcon introduces the world to Sam Spade and established a benchmark upon which a genre – the hard-boiled crime novel – was popularized.Of his character, Hammett says: “Spade has no original.
Hammett’s Spade, epitomizing these hard boiled protagonists, was not just a solver of mysteries, distancing him from the earlier Arthur Conan Doyle model, but was himself a man of the streets.
Hammett describes Spade in sinister terms, calling him a devil and revealing him to be a solver of problems with his iron will and his fists as much with his mind.The Maltese Falcon, of course, was later made into a film starring Humphrey Bogart and directed by John Huston.
Call me an uncultured Cretin (it's true), but I've never seen the movie, so I have nothing to compare it to but the only other classic noir book I've ever read (told you I was a Cretin), Raymond Chandler's The Big Sleep.
Unlike the overly-convoluted un-plot of The Big Sleep, which Chandler admits he just sort of made up as he went along and never fully understood himself, Hammett unravels a mystery, the details of which are made very clear by the end of the book.
Perhaps this is why I found him a more fascinating, deeper character than Chandler's Philip Marlowe (whom I admired, actually).All told, though, I'm glad I read both.
It's my BIBLE.
This novel is set in 1920's San Francisco and creates the character of Sam Spade, a name now synonymous with crime detective fiction. And Modern Library ranks The Maltese Falcon in it's 100 best novels of the 20th century. One of the remarkable things about the novel is that it's not dated at all. The setting could be 1980 as well as 1929. The cast is small and well defined, and the plot is straight-forward, not complicated. And with Hammett's ability to add exquisite detail, the end result is a masterpiece in the genre.
Story wise - just so-so for me. It is supposed to be a classic, so I expected more from the story.But, if you are looking for all the stereotypical hard-boiled detective stuff (dames and all that) this book definitely delivers.
This book is pretty good. Too bad it’s not better known. And it’d be cool if somebody made a decent movie version of it someday...
I don't particularly like any of the characters, except the plucky secretary Effie Perine may be, the protagonist Sam Spade is very smart but I find him a little irritating and unappealing.
I guess Raymond Chandler's Philip Marlowe is cut from the same cloth, which would explain why I do not like The Big Sleep much either.
I was also surprised to learn that Sam Spade is a complete asshole.
For example, at one point a stranger comes into Spade's office, and after a short conversation, points a gun at him and wants to search the office.
When the gunman wakes up, they finish their conversation, come to an agreement, and Spade hands the loaded gun back to the gunman!
Well, of course, the gunman goes right back to pointing the thing at Sam. Pretty silly.
One more thing that I found disappointing was that the titular falcon winds up in Spade's hands through absolutely no detective work on his part.
What turns out to be the understatement to end all understatement's, Spade becomes entangled in a search for a rare, valuable statue that puts his life in danger and his reputation with the law on the line.I was originally hesitant about starting this noir/hard boiled/crime fiction journey because I was under the impression that these books were going to suffer from such massive over-hype that I would feel RIDICULOUS for not liking them.This book was just tremendous.
My expectations of The Maltese Falcon were too high. I love a good hard boiled crime story with a stereotypical detective and a bad girl. Brigid O’Shaughnessy you are a very bad girl. This was a good detective story and the writing was great, but ultimately I felt deflated. I haven't seen the movie so maybe I'll check it out.
In The Maltese Falcon, the best known of Hammett's Sam Spade novels (including The Dain Curse and The Glass Key), Spade is tough enough to bluff the toughest thugs and hold off the police, risking his reputation when a beautiful woman begs for his help, while knowing that betrayal may deal him a new hand in the next moment.Spade's partner is murdered on a stakeout; the cops blame him for the killing; a beautiful redhead with a heartbreaking story appears and disappears; grotesque villains demand a payoff he can't provide; and everyone wants a fabulously valuable gold statuette of a falcon, created as tribute for the Holy Roman Emperor Charles IV.
And the man that’s telling the truth when he says he’s not I distrust most of all, because he’s and ass and an ass that’s going contrary to the laws of nature.”Gutman is also willing to "send over" his gunman Wilmer:Gutman smiled benignly at him and said: “Well, Wilmer, I’m sorry indeed to lose you, and I want you to know that I couldn’t be any fonder of you if you were my own son; but—well, by Gad!—if you lose a son it’s possible to get another—and there’s only one Maltese falcon.”I also this week introduced the three middle schoolers in this house to the Bogart film, and they loved it (which is good, because if they hated it.
--Spade, who had held his breath through much of this speech, now emptied his lungs with a long sighing exhalation between pursed lips and said: "You won't need much of anybody's help.
It's chiefly your eyes, I think, and that throb you get into your voice when you say things like 'Be generous, Mr. Spade.'"--He grinned contentedly.
The people he knew were like that.--Gutman's attempt at a smile was not successful, but he kept the resultant grimace on his mottled face.--Gutman smiled benignly at him and said: "Well, Wilmer, I'm sorry indeed to lose you, and I want you to know that I couldn't be any fonder of you if you were my own son; but—well, by Gad!—if you lose a son it's possible to get another—and there's only one Maltese falcon."
So, a dame walks into a private detective's office...stop me if you've heard this one before.
And the office belongs to no ordinary detective.
She wore two shades of blue that had been chosen because of her eyes.
His eyes, made small by fat puffs around them, were dark and sleek.
He wore a black cutaway coat, black vest, black sating Ascot tie holding a pinkish pearl, striped grey worsted trousers, and patent-leather shoes." The best part of all of this, really, is that a book that's full of all the awesome stuff I've described above is on the list of 1001 Books You Must Read Before You Die. So, take that George Elliot.

Or, if you're a weak, ineffectual man who's never had a date in his life, and enjoys acting out his hopelessly unrealized fantasies in which he sleeps with every woman he meets, well, when he's not strip searching them, grabbing or touching them, or rescuing them from their hopelessly vacuous minds and lives, you may enjoy living through Sam Spade, the main character in this story.
I realize the book was written in 1929, and times were different then, but this story bears little resemblance to reality.
It makes much more sense when you read a little bit about Hammett's life, and understand that he's living through his main characters.
For your private detective does not — or did not ten years ago when he was my colleague — want to be an erudite solver of riddles in the Sherlock Holmes manner; he wants to be a hard and shifty fellow, able to take care of himself in any situation, able to get the best of anybody he comes in contact with, whether criminal, innocent by-stander or client.”				Dashiell Hammett, Introduction to The Maltese Falcon (1934 ed.)First published in serial form (Black Mask, 1929) The Maltese Falcon is the quintessential hard-boiled detective novel.
