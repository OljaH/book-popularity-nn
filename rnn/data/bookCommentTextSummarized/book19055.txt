I learned two major things from this book: the power of branding, and the fact that Richard Branson has balls of solid steel.
I had no idea until reading this how powerful the Virgin brand is, or how many businesses they have gone into.
Many of the businesses also complement each other in profitable ways - such as how Virgin Travel and Virgin Atlantic complemented each other.Branson is a risk-taker.
And of course, if Virgin Fuel does well it will only help his airline business - so not a bad bet.
"I am yet to read an autobiography of an entrepreneur, which has been written so magnetically.
It feels like that I was very much a part of Sir Richard Branson's journey from his boyhood to being one of century's most successful and chic business man, who happens to be having his feet firmly entrenched on the ground.
Richard's humble beginning and the numerous sticky situations that he got into during the initial period of his entrepreneurial endeavors, did not deter him from reaching the awesome heights that he has reached today.
A must read for all entrepreneurs, students, executives, bureaucrats and politicians.
One of the best autobiographies I've ever read!Liked it so much that I actually used it as a source in my book, Thrive: 30 Inspirational Rags-to-Riches Stories.
However, he points out many practical, no nonsense management ideas.Most importantly, Branson always focused on his employees, on working hard and having fun, and on living up to high business standards - even when British Airways actually hired private investigators and PR teams to destroy his image, creditability and ultimately his ability to finance Virgin Airlines.If you need another reminder to: SCREW IT, LET'S DO IT - then give Branson's autobiography a read.
How a dyslexic boy who did not perform well in school went onto become one of the most successful businessmen ever?In his autobiography, Branson takes us through his adventurous, flamboyant life and shows us nothing is impossible. Even with over 600 pages, it never felt boring or slow. Definitely one of the most interesting autobiographies to read. It is full of exciting events, adventures and fun written in a very exciting manner.
A thoroughly enjoyable, intimate, and inspiring account of one of the world's greatest entrepreneurs.
An excellent mix of business, adventure, and personal anecdote keep the book fresh and engaging.
However, despite offering a detailed view of his business philosophy and practices, the scale of his achievements, and the persistence and confidence with which they are executed are still beyond understanding.
There is no shortage of personality and charisma throughout the narrative, but I was left wishing the book captured more of the sense that we were a fly on the wall...
All the same, I've walked away charmed, encouraged, and pleasantly humoured, by this superbly written account of a truly unique individual.
here was this chap who quit school (we cant even miss extra tuition, and then by his efforts had now become known as 1 of the poster boys of entrepreneurship, and look at the fun he has had all the time!
This book was absolutely phenomenal.
If you ever want to live your life vicariously through a book, this would be the one to do it with.
This might be my favorite book ever.
It is so incredibly inspirational as well as fascinating and captivating.
It was written very well, and tells a great story.
This autobiography goes through all of his life, generally chronologically, going back when it makes sense for story arc purposes.
I would recommend this to any entrepreneur, small business owner/dreamer, or any person who just needs a boost that says, "Anything is possible!" I would greatly recommend this book!
This book is about personal journey through life, reminiscences about author's businesses, partners and major victories/battles.
Disappointingly for me, this book is NOT about how exactly Branson arrived at his strategic decisions, what were the reasons for his biggest failures/lessons, what are his recommendations about starting up and running businesses.
Almost no concrete insight into practical side of the business, in other words - a strange result of writing a businessman's biography!This book should has been titled "Mr R.
Branson's extreme travel adventures with some other memories thrown in" with subtitle "No insight into his tremendous entrepreneurial skills whatsoever."
What struck me most in the book is 'Virgin is not a big group - it's a big brand made up of lots of small companies.
Our priorities are the opposite of our large competitors'.
Convention dictates that a company should look after its shareholders first, its customers next, and last of all worry about its employees.
Virgin does the opposite.
For us, our employees matter most.
It just seems common sense to me that, if you start off with a happy, well-motivated workforce, you are much more likely to have happy customers.
And in due course, the resulting profits will make your shareholders happy.' Nothing more to add.
Cheeky and sensationalist.It was interesting to read how his businesses developed and how he sought to take on the big dogs, namely British Airways and GTech lottery.
His brain had to develop ways to 'get around the system' to function properly in life and school.
He oftentimes referred to the fact that he can size up a business proposal or person in the first 30 seconds.
I attribute this to how his brain developed ways to cope with dyslexia.The last 100 pages were rambling and boring.
A semi-interesting read that makes me want to give Virgin Airways a try at least once.
WOW. Richard Branson rocked my world with this book. I've learned so much about entrepreneurship, branding, risk and what it takes to succeed just from reading this book. Its amazing to read a story of a drop out who went on to change the world. This is a must read.
Review: Entertaining and interesting read where Branson shares his and Virgins story to stardom as well as sharing how he survived everything from drowning, freezing and falling to his death during his many grand adventures around the world.
Joking aside, the world could do well having more business leaders like Sir Richard Branson and I recommend any young entrepreneur to read this book.
With protected downside risk much can still be gained, but little will be lost.Favorite quote: “Fun is at the core of the way I like to do business and it has been key to everything I've done from the outset.
Possibly the best autobiography I've ever read.
Richard Branson - the name itself invokes a vivid figure of liveliness, merriment and live life like king size attitude.
The book presents Richard'��s candor, anecdotes and his attitude on platter to relish.
He played from his strengths to strengths and emerges victorious in game called life.
He started his business rendezvous with a student magazine and then further moved on to various other things as new opportunities presented themselves in front of him.
Despite being a non entity in airlines business he took behemoth British Airways heads on and beaten them on their own game.

I stayed enthralled and read the entire book in almost two days.Richard Branson,founder of the Virgin business empire, is a father of risk taker,a paragon of entrepreneurship, and a genius who has inspired English culture and lifestyles.
This book includes the birth of Virgin records, Virgin Atlantic Airways,Virgin Music and many more such astounding ventures.He's life filled with challenges, interesting adventures, dreadful crises and stupendous money.
The splendid lessons I conned from this book are : .
. Don’t ever go into a business with motive to earn Money..
Don’t tell yourself you can not do something.
This is not the first autobiography which i have read, there are other too Steve Jobs, Malala, Wolf of wall street, but this stands apart.
It is enthralling,adventurous experience.
Great insight to person rather extraordinary person with extraordinary thinking.
This book is quite magical and can inspire and motivate anyone, and especially those who have zeal for entrepreneurship.
If i look from reader prospective this is one of the book with finest story telling and riveting to the core.
I have enjoyed the every bit of it.
The book is very fast paced and honesty which is little trivial at times.
Very few of them ever made as much money as Richard Branson, and none of them ever had so much fun with it.Branson is the most amazing character, highly focussed but with a vast range of interests, a James Bond in a jumper.
But what really makes him unique among the captains of stratospheric enterprise is that he seems to have remained a genuinely likeable human being.Am I jealous of his money, luck, success and adventures?
Branson would have forged on and against-the-odds quickly turned the experience into an triumph.
I forged on.
I thought this book was great. Although he's probably sensationalising quite a lot of it, there's no doubt the book left me feeling inspired - feeling like anything was possible, whatever your background. Definitely a motivational book: great if you're slightly doubting your ability to be an entrepreneur. The message of the book is certainly reach for the stars, no matter how cloudy the sky - the stars are much closer than you think.
Richard Branson is my hero. He has done everything his way and continues to do so. Hes done well and poorly but always could see that things would eventually get better. This Bio is more of an reflection of the trials and tribulations of his happiness, sadness and adventures of life and how playing by your own rules can pay off big time.
Perfect !
This book is only about the start of Richard's career, till about the age of 40.Having read other biographies like Steve Jobs and Elon Musk, Richard is a very different person from what I've seen in the others.He actually seems like a very nice person.If you are expecting a book telling you how to get rich, what strategies to follow in business, recommendations on running a startup.
It was quite an eye opener seeing this kind of monopoly and deceit happening in business with the whole British Airways scenario.Because the book was written by himself, one can never be sure that it is totally objective.I am however curious to read the book about the second half of his career.
Read this back in the day ( 1998 ).
It had just been released, and I was at IAD, flying to London.
Richard Branson was on the plane and I got him to sign the book.
I'd just purchased it at the Hudson's in the airport as I was looking for something to read on the flight.It was simply written, honest.
It is not to be written off ( because of the two stars) but does provide insight into the man, society, and class ( class generally, but especially in the UK at the time ).
I read this autobiography because I heard Branson interviewed on the Freakonomics podcast. He had made a comment that he was dyslexic and dropped out of school. He seemed to suggest that struggling students don't really need school to succeed as he did. This raised a question for me: So how do you start a company with a reading disability? The question really wasn't answered but he did surround himself in the early days with smart friends who helped first with the publication Student and then starting Virgin Records. It is an entertaining, sometimes enlightening read but got repetitive.
How many men have the balls to delve into adventure as Branson does?
Even reading about it gives you thrills.Coming to the book itself, first 40% is a breeze to read with every chapter making me go 'wow, what a man'.
And then, oh how wonderful were Branson's lovestories?
Most of the men would be honored to have done 30% of what Sir Richard Branson did!
So, no wonder, the book seems long but that is only telling of the mammoth ride of Virgin brand.He came with no background or legacy and he changed the world in a way.
Reading the autobiography of Sir Richard Branson is like reading an epic novel. He definitely had/is still having one of the most exciting life a person can wish for: Building an empire that he started in his youth, making Virgin one of the strongest brand in the world, accomplishing world records, beeing a philantropist. THe book is well written, in a magnetic style that makes you feel a part of his journey . One of the best book I've read so far.
What a great read! And what an impressive man.A great account, very much interesting and intriguing.Although his solutions are all ingenious, I was really impressed by how much straight-up honesty can achieve in this world.There is lessons for everyone in this well-written splendid book.
What an inspirational book! And how can it not be inspirational when written by the man who has proven that phenomenal business success can be achieved without messing with one’s moral compass. The man who gives a shit and has his heart in the right place. Adventurous, exciting and truly remarkable read!
Throughout this book I found myself laughing and enjoying learning chronologically about how Richard grew up. Richard truly lived a RockStar lifestyle.
