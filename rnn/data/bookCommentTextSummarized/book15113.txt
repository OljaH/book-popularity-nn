Today my son caught my eye, then pointed conspiratorially to his sweat pants. Then he pointed to his shirt. It took me a moment to realize that he was wearing all his clothes inside out. Because that's one of the ways you keep yourself safe from faerie magic.So yeah. It think it's safe to say that these books have had an impact on him.
I read this with my daughter for a school book report.
We read the first book together and decided to give this one a try too.
The rating is from my daughter who I asked, "If five means you loved it and one you hated it, how many stars?" I think the plot in this one was more complex and meaty.
They are still very short, at just over 100 pages.
My daughter's favorite part was the griffin and she thought Hogsqueal was cute.
The river troll and the scene with the goblins around the fire creeped her out (the goblins ate cats).
Review for book one.
My sister and I read the crap out these books (we must have read them 15 times, no joke) and I've been wanting to revist this series and the wonderful fantasy world that Holly and Tony created for awhile now but I've finally gotten around to it.The writing partnership of Holly Black and Tony DiTerlizzi is remarkable and this series is by far some of the most well written literature that I've ever read.The three main characters, Jared, Simon, and Mallory, are so relatable and realistic.
These are cute. It's really stupid that they come as short little nothing stories, though. All five of these would probably add up to half of one novel, so why they're separate is either a poor artistic choice or a really transparent way to make a buck.

من الحماس أود البدأ بالجزء الثالث حالياً لولا أن النوم سلطان وقد بدأ بسلبي قدرتي الكاملة على الإستيعاب
En esta segunda entrega de las crónicas de Spiderwick vemos una historia con más acción que la primera.
En el proceso se encontraran con más obstáculos de los que tenían pensados.Esta es una de esas sagas que conforme avanzas con los libros, estos van mejorando.
A pesar de que en este segundo tomo hay cosas que siguen siendo introductorias, la historia de los hermanos Grace avanza con más misterios por resolver y más aventuras por vivir.En cuanto a la escritora, percibo como paulatinamente nos van llevando a un mundo de fantasía bastante interesante, y sin dejar atrás las ilustraciones, que complementan visualmente a la narración de una forma satisfactoria.
I think we're forgetting the audience here: children, young readers!
Do I think that this is good for a young reader looking for a challenge?
But I do think it is a fun and easy read and it might be really great for kids who don't have a long attention span or who aren't avid readers.
For the age group, I think anything that gets kids into reading is great.
I devoured books and I think this would have been a fun little read even then.
I really like this series. It's very exciting - there's adventure and fantasy. However, I think it can be really scary for kids. Especially the part of the goblins in the woods with jagged teeth and long claws that eat cats & dogs and drag small children off into the woods. I think you really have to know your child's tolerance for "creepy" before you let them read this book. But a great series so far...

I'm totally reading these books for research...not because they're awesome and cute and magical and really fun.
*ahem* Okay, so now that that's cleared up!
I don't have a lot to say (gasp), just that it's like reading one chapter!
I find a few of the phrases redundant though...like Mallory put Simon's SHOE in her pocket (when they found it while they were looking for him).
Simon is 9 and Mallory is 13.
Little things like that do annoy me.
It's like she's totally detached from her children's lives.
Simon, Mallory, and Jared are awesomely written though.
It's like a magical snack.
As much fun as the first one! 🙈 can’t wait to read more when I get home😍
These are just such fun and quick reads! I'm disappointed I didn't read them when I was younger!!
Mallory, Jared, and Simon seem like real siblings that I am joining on these adventures.
The plot continues to build on information we received in The Field Guide as Jared and his siblings delve deeper into the faerie world.
And things are not always nice.
This time we deal with goblins, trolls, kidnapping, and a few other unpleasant things.
These are very magical and quite superbly written, so I don't want to delve too deeply into the story and plot.
I can already tell that I will revisit them many times in the future.
(view spoiler)[ Fuck you, goblins, for murdering Tibbs the cat. I was pissed about it when I was ten and I'm still pissed now. (hide spoiler)]
السلسلة دي برغم بساطتها مقارنة بقراءاتي ف العادة الا انها لا زالت ممتعة جدا ليا
בארי ממש אוהב את זה וגם אני.האורך של הספר ושל הפרקים ממש מדויק ליכולת הריכוז, האקשן זורם בקצב טוב, האיורים מקסימים ובארי ממש נהנה להתעמק בהם.
In the second book of “The Spiderwick” series, Jared, and his siblings, are exposed to even more creatures.
The book begins with Jared coming home from detention, and Simon looking for his cat, named Tibbs.
In the previous book he is all about himself, but in this book he was looking out for his siblings and keeping them from getting hurt.The new setting that emerged in this book is the woods, along with all of the creatures’ homes.
Mallory had to trust Jared to see the creatures, and judge if they were good or bad news.
Simon was trusting his siblings with his life.
I can honestly say that this series is one that was really let down by the film adaptation.
If you’re someone who enjoyed the film then I really do suggest that you read the books to find out just how great they actually are rather than taking the film standpoint on it.Filled with more action than the first book, the second in the series sees the siblings heading deeper into the mythical world around them.
It is another great paced instalment in the series, keeping you interested from the start until the end as the three children try to come to terms with the new world that has been opened up around them – even when things do not appear to be working in their favour.
2.5 starsBit darker than the first book but still very light reading.
I like that the kids are getting a deeper understanding of the world around them.
I don't feel this adds much and I don't like how just as I start to get into it, it just stops.
It bothered me in the first book and even more so now.
If I had read these as they came out I would not bother as you never have the chance to get immersed into the story.
I don't plan to go into great detail about the storyline, because I'm a firm believer that a story can only be truly reviewed by a person's impression of the story.
I think it would be a waste of time to go over the plot again...that's what the title page of the book is for.Again, a fast paced and action pact adventure for Jared, Simon, and Mallory!
It seems the price of having a book like The Guide has it's very unusual and dangerous consequences that they must face.I was not disappointed with this book at all, and I am continuing to devour the rest of the series!
Another good read.
Kind of wished they combined these tiny little books into one super book so we can actually get the whole story but otherwise this is great
I loved this one even more than the 1st!I can’t wait to get my hands on the next in the series!
Read as part of #ReadKidsLitEven better than the first, very fun adventure, loved the teamwork between Mallory and Jared. I listened to the audiobook version and am still giggling over the Kermit the Frog voice that the narrator (Mark Hamill) gave to the hobgoblin! Anxious to continue, but have to wait in line.
I really like Hogsqueal, and I think he may actually be my favorite character in the series (mainly based on his appearance heh)I still think the bind up is the best way to read this series though.
Pues... Ya va avanzando, pero por lo que llevo leido está es una de esas extrañas y pocas veces en la que la pelicula es mejor que el libro.Reseña completa en el ultimo libro!   [ Reseña ]
These books are just charming! :)
I really loved this story. I enjoy it a lot.
This books are so cute, i will never stop saying that. And I still love Jared, Simon and Mallory!
