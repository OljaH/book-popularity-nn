It references so many phrases that are confused in modern times, and even completely redundant in today's society.
I was starting to think I'd actually invented the word in my own mind before I thought to look it up in this beauty of a reference book.My point is, it makes me sad for the English language, but it is also a handy guide for those of us who have trouble letting go.
I will cling to these words and phrases for as long as possible, so I'm grateful to have this little guide to back me up.
Dry, witty, amusing, and just a touchy of smarmy. I read this when I was a true grammar prescriptivist and loved it but now having studied linguistics I enjoy it as a means to laugh at the sticklers' approach to language and how limiting and ludicrous it is. Enjoyable either way!
Put this with Fowler, Kingsley Amis and Lynne Truss, who could not know the essentials of decent English? Writing it is of course another matter.
This book is alright i suppose. I expected more. It's in a way subjective and ambiguous at times. The detail often is so minute and fine that i would have to wait for a life time to find a literary predicament in which the some knowledge within this book could then be applied. That said, it is intriguing and i don't mind reading it every now and then just for something different.
Essential addition to reference portion of my bookshelf.
A collection of things people generally tend to get wrong in English. Very informative and useful reference book. And it's fun to read too.
A great reference book. I use it almost daily in my work as an editor.
Good for school work...
Very amusing but highly informative.
