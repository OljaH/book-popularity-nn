Beyond the somewhat gratuitous "torrid love scenes" indicative of the genre, which, despite their female perspective manage to be excitingly readable (read: it's not all man chests and pork swords), this book throws at you a fun mix of spontaneous, wisecracking characters that don't fail in providing a few hours of lighthearted entertainment.
If you like vamps and sex (or shoes), this series is worth the awkward trip to the romance section.
This sounded like a fun read, but it wasn't!!!**1.5 "More Annoying than Entertaining" stars**The heroine dies in a car accident only to wake up in the funeral home a few nights later.
She just stood there like an idiot and allowed her helpless friend to be "vampire raped".
Though she was attracted to Sinclair, she didn't like him, and wanted nothing to do with him either.This book is suppose to be funny, but it missed the mark for me.
I was SO offended by the heroine's best friend, a black female that like to refer to white people as whitey and honky.
“Just because I’m dead doesn’t mean I can’t have a life.”  Based on the cover, I thought it would be a light story and it was. At the beginning, it looked like a PNR parody, featuring all the vampire clichés, but the author made a success out of using them. The story is told from Betsy’s viewpoint, and her voice is fun and snarky.I love Betsy, there is so much potential in her character. She is a newbie vampire with extraordinary abilities. She has to learn much about her vampire nature, but a
Betsy’s rhapsodic attitude, her independence, and her cheerful, offbeat behavior result in a lot of funny situations.I enjoyed the situational comedy elements, the witty, laugh-out-loud dialogues, Betsy’s playful ripostes, and her sarcastic tendency to rename people.The world-building has shortcomings, but it doesn’t lessen the entertainment value of the story.The erotic scenes are surprising, light, and intensely erotic.
I'm glad it's not rushed but I hope it won’t be long-drawn out either.Undead and Unwed is a great starter book of the Undead series, and it is highly different from the paranormal romances I’ve read before.
Super funny book that delivers the snark!It's not a deep or complicated urban fantasy or anything. It's simple, cute, silly, and fun. Like a chick-flick book.

Super funny book that delivers the snark!It's not a deep or complicated urban fantasy or anything.

Personally, I don't have the shoe-fetish that we woman are all supposed to have.
I must have missed that day in Femaling 101.
But, Betsy the vampire still had enough other qualities that I could relate to - such as being a smartass.
When she meets a large group of vampires, she has a few questions:
"Why don't we turn the goddamned lights on?
Why do you all look like extras from a B-movie vampire set?"
Although you must understand that it is a book to have a nice time, a fast and fun read.
But still I had a great time.The heroine is amazing.
Maybe that's why I couldn't give a higher rating to this book.Also a more interesting plot would have been nice.
But it was a different point of view to the vampire world for sure.Don't get me wrong, I'm just mentioning the reasons for why I couldn't give this book a higher rating, but doesn't mean that I didn't like it because I had a great time reading it.
It takes a six-year-old to point out to her that she's got fangs and is a vampire.That's just the beginning of Betsy's really bad week.
She may be the prophesised queen they've been waiting millennia for, but all Betsy wants is to rescue her collection of designer shoes from her stepmonster and resist the lure of one oh-so-sexy vampire, Sinclair.Undead and Unwed is flippant, irreverent, funny, sexy and very very annoying.
That is to say, Betsy is very annoying.
I have to agree with most of the other characters, though, when they tell Betsy to SHUT UP!
The first good thing that I have to say about this book is that I love the title.
This book was in my opinion not funny at all, although I must stay that it tried very hard to be a funny book.
Too hard, even.The second positive that I have to say is that it's read quite quickly.
That is a good thing, for a book this bad should either be tossed right away or be over with quickly.
It really made me cringe, and that happens rarely when it comes to books.
If that is your thing.
SO this book is about a narcissistic, slightly stupid woman who dies and becomes a vampire.
Some of the current bad-ass vamps find out and want her to join their side.Overall, the book was okay.
I mean I did laugh out loud towards the end, but some of the jokes and bantering sounded too forced.
Towards the middle I really hated Elizabeth's character, she was so vain, but by the end I just laughed at her.
I will read the next book in the series just to see if the series gets better or worse.
I hope the writing isn't quite as forced.
***2017 Summer Lovin’ Reading List *** Before there was Molly Harper’s Nice Girls Don’t Have Fangs there was MaryJanice Davidson’s Undead and unwed. They feel somewhat related, but although I really enjoy Harper’s fiction, I think I have had enough of Davidson’s. The difference, for me, is in the main character. I can relate to Jane Jameson (Harper)—she’s educated, she’s a librarian/bookstore owner, she’s snarky and sometimes a bit neurotic, but always basically good-hearted. Betsy Taylor (Davi
They feel somewhat related, but although I really enjoy Harper’s fiction, I think I have had enough of Davidson’s.
I’m sure there’s a target-market for Betsy out there somewhere, I’m just not it.It’s not that she doesn’t get some good lines, like “I was the Queen who brought all the tribes together, who ruled them as one.
It was like attending Bible school in hell.” Or when she first meets Eric Sinclair, “His shoes were—whoa!
I had to order this volume via interlibrary loan in order to read it, making feel that I had to finish the book to justify ordering it from another part of the province.
I am a huge fan of chick-lit and paranormal romance, so combining the two genres is like reader heaven for me.
Seriously, you get the best of both genres with this book: the insecure but lovable protagonist, her bad ass vampire crush, and some steamy sex scenes.
Not only did she die in a tragic accident, she has awaken a vampire-in horrible shoes at that.
Whew!I enjoyed this book more than I thought I would and I seriously had to cry from laughing too hard.
This book should be read if you're sad, stressed, and looking for a a pick me up-that's calorie free.
I think I'm still shell-shocked from reading this book.
I belong to a "fascinating" book club where we only try and pick horrendous and/or fun/lights reads to make fun of when we get together.
The writing was dribble.
She writes Minneapolis as if it's The Bronx at 2 a.m. every night.
My husband actually asked me if I was feeling well when I was reading the last chapter because my face looked so concerned.Yes, I knew what I was getting myself into, but I had no idea it would be THIS bad.
I read this last year and was just suggested it again.
I never finished it so I didn't think it was fair to include it in my books read, but now I just want to rate and review it so that it won't be suggested to me again.
I am aware that this is just a fun read and not meant to be taken seriously, but honestly I couldn't stand it.
There were some funny parts, but it was not enough to redeem this book for me.
Wasting my time on this type of book frustrates me when there are much better books to read out there.
So ein Buch habe ich bei dem Regenwetter gebraucht...Der sehr humorvolle Schreibstil und die schlagfertige Hauptprotagonisten Betsy mit dem frechen und vorlauten Mundwerk sind eine perfekte Abwechslung im grauen Alltag.Die Geschichte ist vielleicht nur 3 Sterne wert, weil sie nicht wirklich überraschend war, aber Betsy ist einfach so unterhaltsam. Bin gespannt, was da noch passiert :)
None of the reviews I read warned me that were this story a movie, it would be rated a very hard R.
She would like her life to get back to normal as soon as possible and spends a good part of this story trying to make that happen.
I don’t use this kind of language myself and do not like hearing it or reading it.
I would like to see how Betsy further deals with her new status as a vampire with scruples and designer shoes, but assume that all the subsequent books in this series would be written in the same style as this first one was.
This was so much fun to read. It wasn't the usual vampire paranormal book but it was fun to read something different.
Oh no, this girl is like a vampire 2.0.
Almost nothing that vampires normally have applies to our girl Betsy.
She was really fun, and I loved how she eventually embraced being a vampire, and how she learned how to find blood, what to do about all that male attraction that is happening now she is a vampire (yep, this girl got all the boys (and dogs) flocking to her), and many other things.
Plus, like Betsy, she had a good portion of snark.

“Just because I’m dead doesn’t mean I can’t have a life.”  Based on the cover, I thought it would be a light story and it was. I hadn’t really read the blurb before I started reading. At the beginning, it looked like a PNR parody, featuring all the vampire clichés, but the author makes a success out of using them. The narration is smart, as the story is told by Betsy’s viewpoint, so you can comprehend and experience things with her.I love Betsy, there is much potential in her character. She is
Betsy’s haphazard attitude, her independence, and her cheerful, cool behavior result in a lot of funny situations.I enjoyed the situational comedy elements, the witty, laugh-out-loud dialogues, Betsy’s playful ripostes, and her sarcastic tendency to rename people.The world-building has shortcomings, but it doesn’t lessen the entertainment value of the story.
Anyway, I don’t expect a complex vampire mythology from such a light, funny book.The sex scenes are surprising, light, and intensely erotic without some sickly sweet romantic bullshit.As for the romance, I’m satisfied that there is no remarkable romance here, I guess it comes later.
She rips off jokes from Clueless, among other places.
She's a registered Republican who knows nothing about the issues; a PETA member who gets sanctimonious about animal testing but still eats meat.
She insists that the slaves had it good in Gone with the Wind, and she's not joking.
She gets in a racially motivated fight with a black woman and is a total asshole about it.Don't get me wrong, I like light entertainment as much as the next person.
But there's a difference between light entertainment and trash, and the trash is where this book belongs.

It seems one of the Master vampires, Nostro, is threatened by her gifts and doesn't like the fact that she is different.
Before Nostro can set his fiends upon her, another Master vampire swoops in and rescues her.This other Master vampire is Eric Sinclair, Betsy's very delicious love interest, although I'm not sure if he is totally trustworthy.
Because of her unusual gifts, Sinclair believes that Betsy is the Vampire Queen and needs her help to overthrow Nostro.
It's exactly the kind of book you'd read when you're down because the ridiculousness of it is just so endearing as a whole.The heroine, Betsy(yeap), is a newly made Undead and not happy about it, especially considering that what she's seen of the world of vampires so far is sooo last year.
Betsy is, like the rest of the book, full of fluff and silliness but in the end it just works for me.Apart from that we have too many gay people, which I don't really mind at all.
Ridiculous gay characters are the best.
I will only read the sequels only when I have a lot, and a lot of time to kill.
She manages to save a man, named Mark from attempting suicide.
Then there's this vampire Eric Sinclair, who's tall, dark and sinister, on her heels.
And should I mention that Betsy lisps when her fangs are out?
How unglamorous it would be, to give speeches to her minions and lisp.But I should warn you, this vampire could be bribed to become queen.
Aside from the good looks that comes with the package, not to mention his package itself which is also described in vivid detail, he's willing to bribe his girl with Manalo Blahnik shoes until forgiven.
kitapta ki bütün karakterler ruh hastası. Bir tane normal adam yok ama bayıldım. 😂Betsy harika bir kadın 😂😂😂
3.5Although I didn't laugh out loud for most of the book. I did smile and almost giggle a few times. I'm glad a gave it another try. The world building is interesting. So far Betsy hadn't totally gotten on my nerves. But we will see. Off to the next book.
Her 'differences' as a vampire were a nice touch as well, especially loving the part where she got out of the car and "yawned" in the sun, not thinking about the typical vampire rules.There are a few very sexual scenes, although that does not dominate the book by far.
You can never say I ruin a book with my reviews *evil grin* On the violence side, there's some head crashing here and there but nothing strenuous.Overall the book was laugh-out-loud hilarious, a different vein of vampire novels, with a main character you can't help but like (even if at times she's temporarily annoying enough to where you almost put down the book), and a hero you couldn't help but almost love.
This book was absolutely ridiculous and I loved it!Betsy is a total loon.
In real life I know I would probably hate her but I absolutely love reading about her and her life.
What I did not like about this book was Sinclair.
I have read a few reviews and most of them go on and on about how amazing Sinclair is and I'm sitting here like..
OH and the huge reason I don't like him..he tricks Betsy.
So I hate him.This book was fun and breezy and it an interesting story.
This book is a very bland sort of read.
The main character, Betsy (great name) is a spunky blonde shoe-aholic, or at least she's meant to be.
I kept asking in my head, "Yeah, but how often does having a billionaire best friend happen?" even though Betsy is a vampire queen.
I know, I know, the most insignificant things get caught in my mind-maw, but when they do they irritate the hell out of me.For all it's blandness, it's all right, for a fluff-book.
For something to push back the gut gnawing cravings for the next book in the current it series.
3.5In the library, this book stands at the chick lit section. Not sure if I can agree they got the genre right, but if they did, it's definitely weirdest and most bizarre chick lit I've ever read.And the most entertaining one!This is what the True Blood series would be like if it was written by Sophie Kinsella.A book that makes it obvious we shouldn't take it too seriously, and I enjoyed every bit of it!
