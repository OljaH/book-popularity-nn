This had a few new puzzles for me, but generally they were of a type that I don't tend to prefer. When the cleverness is in the wording, it tends to appeal to me less than when the confines of working the puzzle are completely clear to me and the solution is tricky in and of itself.
Some nice puzzles, some not so nice.
