Honestly, though this well written, I'm not sure how much of it I grasped. It's clear how H D used the Ancient World to comment on our modern one. What those comments are, and what they mean, isn't really clear to me.
D. as a creator, such as Pygmalion: Shall I let myself be caughtin my own light?shall I let myself be brokenin my own heat?[...]I made god upon godstep from the cold rock.I made the gods less than menfor I was a man and they my work;or Eurydice -arguably her finest, most original and perhaps most feminist poem in the book- with her brilliant and utterly convincing depiction of the lover egotistically dragged back from hell and transmuted into pure fury:So for your arroganceand your ruthlessnessI have lost the earthand the flowers of the earth,and the live souls above the earth[...]hell is no worse than your earthThese explorations of her "Greek mask", as D.
I do like H.D., but not this collection. The writing is derivative of Keats and the Romantics at their gushingest. The classical references and dramatic monologues of mythical figures do nothing new. And every poet should be allowed only one "ah" and one "O" in their careers. H.D. uses up a century's worth here.
I just love H.D. Which means I loved almost every poem in this book - every poem but one - Egypt, dedicated to Poe. I just didn't understand what exactly she had against Egypt. But hey, I loved all the rest. This book contains some of my favourite H.D. poems; Evadne and Circe.
Sexual fantasy with so much gold and choir singing it's nauseating.
A modernist-romantic re-telling of the Greeks

H.D.'s revisionary myth-making is clear in this collection where she takes a feminist perspective with these classic myths, giving a voice to the women in the myths who had none before.
