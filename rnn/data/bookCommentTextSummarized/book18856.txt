Instead of beginning back in New York, a few months after the previous novel, the fifth, and final, book in The Underland Chronicles takes place almost immediately after Marks of Secret.
FIlled with nonstop action, Gregor and The Code of Claw is a wonderful and thought-provoking ending to the series.I can honestly say that this book shook me.
I hope that Suzanne Collins will at least consider continuing the Underland Chronicles (perhaps through a prequel or spin-off series, I'm not sure a sequel to Code of the Claw would be wise), or, at the very least, work on a new series that captures some of the elements that made this one outstanding.
In this last book in the Gregor the Overlander series, Suzanne Collins achieves the impossible.
It is a testament to her skill at writing these characters in such a way that they seem so real, so believable, so sympathetic.
But more of it was because I could feel the pain contained in the story and relate so easily to the suffering described.
You can't help but like him.I read the first Gregor book on a recommendation from my sister-in-law.
I didn't sob aloud for the tragedy in this book as I did when reading of a certain Hogwart's funeral, but I love these characters.
I liked this series a lot, and I liked this book for the most part.
The ending didn't give me the closure that I'd like.SPOILER ALERT - - - - SPOILER ALERT - - - - I felt like Gregor's connection with the Underland after the final battle wasn't clear.
Essentially, I didn't have to have all of that explained, but I needed to have a tad more closure than I got.
Considering that this book is geared toward juveniles, I can't imagine them going with the "Cast Away" type ending that you god here.All that being said.
I loved this series! Suzanne sure has a way with her characters and I loved so many of them here. Especially Ripred - I cried when I thought they had lost him. Deep down I figured he would make it out okay. And the ending - It left me wanting more, but that's because I wasn't ready to let these characters go. I do feel they will be alright and that Gregor will return to the Underland some day. I just can't see him not going back to Luxa and his friends. Great story! :)
*No spoilers*I always judge series endings way more harshly, otherwise it would've maybe been a 5 star.
It was a great ending filled with action and battles and a large amount of bloodshed, but I personally think the battle between Gregor and the Bane was over too quickly.
Or perhaps a nice little epilogue with Gregor going back to Underland would've done it for me.
Lastly, sh*t gets real with this quote from the penultimate page..."People all over the world were suffering, starving, fleeing, killing one another as they waged their wars.
I'll have to compare them some to my other faves: The writing isn't as quick or cerebral as in the Lemony Snicket books, but I think it is generally better quality than Harry Potter.
Be forewarned that there is a great deal of dialects, and some baby talk, but the former is often humorous and the latter easy to look over.
These books also aren't as deep as the Dark Materials series, but I do think that they are excellent for their lack of the Good Versus Evil dichotomy that Harry Potter tends to display.
A great ending to the series! Ripred rocks!
I didn't feel quite satisfied at the end of the series not knowing what happened next, although I can definitely see why the author would think a neat, tied-up, happy ending wouldn't work for this sobering series.SPOILER:I was near tears through much of the last section of the book, but I think the saddest thing of all was the state of Gregor at the very end.
Would Gregor EVER see the friends he loved in the Underland again?
Was it fair (or healthy) for Gregor to fight so hard for the Underland and then never know what happened to his friends after he left?
I would LOVE to see some more books about Gregor and his Underland friends.The ending was my favorite kind: Bittersweet.
Lots of sadness and tragedy (I admit I cried several times throughout the book!!!) but lots of sweetness and hope as well.
I was just so sad that Gregor and his family didn't stay permanently in the Underland, but everything the author did was well done; it all had a concrete purpose.
Luxa and Gregor's memories, hopes, dreams, and nightmares will haunt me for a while.
It's this kind of ending that makes the entire series so great.
Not only was it action packed, suspenseful and has some really great humor, but it's also a fun creepy world that you can't help but get lost in, even though reading about giant rats and bugs still gave me the willies here and there.Gregor and The Code of Claw was an excellent ending to a wonderful series.
Still, I thought the ending was very well done and it's something I can actually say I'll miss.Gregor, his friend and his family are just amazing characters and I was thrilled to share there experience by reading these awesome adventures.A must read for any fan of Collins and any fans of fun fantasy that is like no other!My Applause!
Bu son neydi Suzanne? Oldu mu böyle? Hem Ares... 😢Serinin son iki kitabı kangren eden İsmek kayıtlarının açılmasını beklerken okudum. Sitenin açılmamasının verdiği sinirin ve uykusuzluğun üzerine çekilecek bir final yazılmamıştı. Daha ayrıntılı ve uzun, geçiştirimemiş final yakışırdı bu seriye. Yazar her ne kadar son kitapta olayı çocuk kategorisinden taşırmış olsa da bu türde yazmaya devam etmesini canıgönülden isterim. 👌
I mean, she makes such a big deal about Gregor and Luxa not being able to stand the idea of being separated earlier in the book, and then at the end it's like, oh we'll just go our separate ways after all, hum de dum?
Why not just leave him in the Underland if there's not going to be any denouement?Oh, and one other complaint - it was a little too convenient how Gregor had a whole new theology introduced to him right before he's going off to face what he thought was his death.
I think people would have been prepared for Mockingjay if they had read the Underland Chronicles first, especially this book.And I remember people complained about the epilogue in Mockingjay, and well...at least it got an epilogue.
:(I had a couple of questions about the ending, and I planned on listing them in this review.
But I think I probably just need some time to really think about it and figure it out.
What Suzanne Collins would probably say to me if I asked her these questions.
:p)Anyway, great series!
Wonder what her next book or series will be about.
Not cool.Rather than reflecting any further upon this book, I'd like to comment on the series as a whole in this review.
Collins, on the other hand, includes Gregor's family, and it ends up being one of the best elements of the series.
It's good to have a hero that is conscious of the responsibilities of family, and it adds a fresh element to the fantasy feel.Another strength of these books is that they have such real conflict.
The asking of them gives a depth to this series that most fantasies lack.The last thing I'll mention is that Collins does some pretty awesome characterizations.
Like some of the other reviewers of this book/series, I was unsettled by the ending of the book.
Life goes on, after the plot of a book/series comes to an end, doesn't it?
The "problem" is that we've come to love, adore, sympathize so much with the main characters (not to mention a few minor ones, e.g. Temp, Lapblood, etc.) that we want to know more about the rest of their lives and every detail of what happened to them during the adventure we took with them.
Thank you for giving us Gregor, a hero who didn't want to be a hero, and Boots, a Princess through and through.
And boy, is it a tour de force.Collins writes violence in a way that you couldn't possibly support it, even if you're a kid.
The ways she paints the violence as traumatizing for Gregor aren't subtle, but in a kids book, they can't be.
Collins does the best she can with the audience she's writing for, and it works better than I could've imagined.I've compared the series to Animorphs a couple times throughout my reviews of it, and nowhere has it felt more apt than here, particularly in the ending after the battles are over.
Gregor muss nicht nur das Unterland vor einem Fluch befreien, er muss sich auch gegen eine gerissene Kriegstreiberin behaupten und ein wichtiger Code muss geknackt werden, damit die Regalianer überhaupt eine Chance haben, in diesem Krieg zu bestehen!Es ist nicht ganz so düster wie der vierte Band, trotzdem fordert die Handlung wieder viele Opfer auf die unterschiedlichste Weise und es gibt einige traurige und zu Herzen gehende Momente, die mich sehr berührt haben.
Das ist schon richtig, aber die Autorin schafft hier ein ausgleichendes Verhältnis und man muss sich mal überlegen, wie viel Gewalt Kinder in den Medien heutzutage ausgesetzt sind, wo sie es nicht verarbeiten können.
Excellent end to the series. Definitely recommend it.
This was the first book to ever make me sob
I think it's always rather hard to end a series, but this final book felt pretty fitting and I thought it really worked.
There was a lot that I liked about it, and it ended up being my favorite of the series.I loved that we got to see the character of Lizzie a bit more.
if not because the audience has grown attached to the character, at least because Gregor has.The ending seems about right for the series, though it does leave you wanting a bit more.
Петата част от Подземни хроники е за последната битка, която ще определи бъдещето на всички същества. Всички са понесли много загуби - жертви, ранени, опустошения.В основата пак стои Пророчесто - за шифъра на ноктите, който е толкова важен, че от него зависи изхода на войната. Информацията винаги е била много по-могъща от всякакви оръжия.Грегор и Лукса извървяха дълъг път и се наложи твърде рано и бързо да пораснат.
Suzanne Collins scheint eine Autorin zu sein, die solche Bücher schreiben kann, denn nicht nur der Abschluss der Panem-Reihe Flammender Zorn löst diese Gefühle im Leser aus, sondern auch dieser Band ihrer Debüt-Reihe.Schon in den vorherigen Bänden legt die Autorin immer wieder eine Schippe drauf, um zu zeigen, dass hinter diesen Abenteuern in einem fantastischen Land unterhalb New Yorks mehr Tiefe, Ernst und Brutalität steckt, als man im ersten Moment erwarten würde.
Denn ähnlich wie in ihrer zweiten Reihe hat Suzanne Collins ein Händchen für gute, aber bittere Enden, die einem das Gefühl geben, dass es nie vorbei sein wird, egal ob man gerade auf dem Schlachtfeld steht oder nicht.
I really liked the characters in this series, although I felt that it was a little random that Gregor was secretly a total ninja deep down inside.
And I'm not even going to pretend that I didn't waste 3 minutes of my life trying to do a little echo location of my own...Hey, if Gregor can, why can't I?
Passion!!!But at least I don't feel like I've wasted my life finishing the Gregor series, like I did with the Hunger Games series.
I never expected the series to end like this and all I can say is..
I think I am finally going to declare this series a five star one for me.This final book was non-stop action.
All three of those creatures are not generally loved so for Collins to give them personality that is so endearing and perfect - all I can say is bravo to her.I'm sad to be leaving the Underland behind.
This is a series I'll be purchasing on putting on the shelf for my nephew to read.
Gregor's role is to kill the Bane and he is helped by all his previous acquaintances from the previous books.This series has been wonderful to read, it invokes thinking about the value of war and about the interpretation of the way things have always been done.Most people find the ending of this fifth book unsatisfying and lacking closure, but I love the ending.
Yeah, for Suzanne Collins writing a realistic ending to a thought provoking series which contains lots of action and killing, but contains lots of consequences to those actions.
We listened to the audio books as a family and we all wanted to keep driving just so we could read more.
We ended up taking a road trip From Ut to KS to visit family, but also so we could finish the books!
Overall though, I feel that the story ended well and that it was good read for us all to share.
The series was especially good to keep us entertained and anxious to keep driving for a 2000 mile road trip.
I think that if I think about a book, really ruminate on the story and the ideas behind it, then it was worth it for me to read it.
I was so sad when I heard the prophecy that said Gregor had to die, but I kept thinking "He won't die, Sandwich was an ass." But I love how Gregor is so strong and tough.
I know he's only 11 and so it's not very realistic, but honestly, wouldn't you love to know Gregor?
I wish I was a rager so I could fight against evil like Gregor.
I bawled when Ares died, and I was a little sad with the book's ending.
Is Gregor going to go back and marry Luxa?
Done with the series.
The thing I loved about these last 2 books is they deal alot with prophecy and predestiny versus choice and deciding what is right and who to beleive.
She really fleshes out the inner conflict of these things and the battles and story did not disappoint!!
The only thing I had a hard time with is the ending because I didn't want it to end that way.
It's always sad to say goodbye to characters you love so well at the end of a book and have them try to start over after such major lifechanging experiences.
More books to read.
Highly recommend this series!!!
I love book reading marathons. The book delivered what was promised. Nothing more, nothing less.
