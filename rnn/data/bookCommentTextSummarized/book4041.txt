Nowadays my husband and I refer to that moment when you tell yourself you’ll only watch five minutes of a movie and then wind up sucked in until the final credits roll “Getting Shawshanked.” Back in the day it was probably referred to as “Getting Rear Windowed.” When I saw my buddy Dan read this a few days ago I knew I had to get to it pronto.
For only being fourteen pages long, it really packed in the suspense and provided quite a full story to inspire the film.
Of course, since this was only fourteen pages, it was missing some of what made the film so much fun.
A man with a broken leg notices a neighbor's wife seems to have gone missing.
Is she in the hospital, out of town, or dead?When a man ain’t got nothing to do but just sit all day, he sure can think up the blamest things—Most of us know the basic plot of Rear Window (aka It Had to be Murder), even if we haven't seen the Alfred Hitchcock movie.
Hal Jeffries can't seem to keep his nose out of his neighbors' business and things start to unravel.

This 1942 short story (originally titled “It Had To Be Murder”) was the inspiration for Alfred Hitchcock’s 1954 film “Rear Window”. Woolrich received his inspiration for the story from H.G. Wells short story Through a Window.
What do we know of our neighbors, the ones next door, with their daughter on her third husband, and yes, please tell us about the couple down the street and their wild parties, shameful.
But they were once so in love!Cornell Woolrich writes in “It Had to be Murder,” the short story that formed the inspiration for Hitchcock’s 1954 thriller Rear Window (with Jimmy Stewart and Grace Kelly), of a man, L.
Suddenly the couple engages in an act that any neighbor might be curious to know and gossip about.
Hitchcock, in the middle of his tale of deceit and murder, turns the eyes on Jeffries, the watcher of sin; how would he feel being watched?
A detective novella which I thoroughly enjoyed.Was recommended by Jaya as a short and satisfactory read, and it was!Hal Jeffries is recuperating in his bedroom after a disabling illness/injury and has nothing to do but watch through the windows of the neighbouring apartment complex. And in Apartment 4 he finds something suspicious going on one day. He further spies upon the inhabitants and comes to a fearsome deduction, which almost costs his life.My first through and through read of the year, and a very short one at just 47 pages.
3.5 stars. First published as "It Had to Be Murder", this noir short story was filmed by Alfred Hitchcock as "Rear Window". Jeffries, a disabled man, sits by his bedroom window filling the hours by watching the comings and goings of his neighbors. He noticed that the ill wife of another tenant seemed to be missing. The story takes the reader inside Jeffries' mind as he works through his suspicions about the woman's disappearance. It was an enjoyable short story where the suspense kept building.
I read this short story because I'm going to watch Rear Window because I'm excited about Castle's 100th episode airing tomorrow (April 1, 2013). Yay! I can't wait to see what they do with it.
Rear Window is my all-time favorite Hitchcock movie, so when I discovered it had been based on a short story, I knew I had to read it.
For me, it was impossible to separate the movie from the story, and I'm certain my enjoyment of it would have been altered somewhat- probably lessened- if I didn't have the movie to reference in my head while reading.Interesting differences between the two mediums- there is no Grace Kelly character in the story.
It was great enough to inspire Hitchcock, so I would definitely recommend this to Rear Window fans.
Here's a link to a free version of the story for anyone interested: http://www.miettecast.com/woolrich.pdf
Нормальный детектив.Но фильм мне понравился больше!!! Правда, я так и не понял, как убийца вычислил, кто за ним наблюдает, и, вообще, если он предполагал, что за ним наблюдают, то, неужели, не мог просто опустить шторы!!!
شاهدت الفيلم. لا تقم بالتجسس على الاخرين لانك قد تكتشف اشياء مرعبة جريمة قتل مثلا.
You know what, just stick to Hitchcock's Rear Window. This short story is not even close to the awesomeness of the movie.
Not what I expected after watching Hitchcock’s Rear Window but still some relations and again I recommend watching the film first because then you can follow along to the short story. Thank you Hitchcock and Cornell Woolrich!
Never too crazy about the movie either.
Unlike the film, there is no girlfriend to do the physical tasks of going across to the other building and discovering the names of those living at the apartment, or leaving a 'I know what you've done with her' note under the front door of the apartment, or even breaking in and leaving obvious signs of a search to spook the man; in the story, all that is done by his long suffering friend Sam.The suspense grows as the reader, before Hal himself, realises that he has not been as clever as he thought and has instead drawn the murderous attention of the man.
The original inspiration behind Hitchcock's "Rear Window," which was the inspiration for the movie "Disturbia," the story centers around a man, Hal Jeffries, who is confined to his bedroom after an ankle injury.
Not being much of a reader, the man spends his time watching and listening to his neighbours' daily routines for entertainment.
His attention is drawn to the house of a couple, an out-of-job husband and a sick wife, after he first witnesses a change in their daily routine.
The title "It had to be..."suits perfectly as it is not clear to the reader until the end of the story what actually happened, and if what Hal supposes is true.
So I only read the title story, its available for free online so that`s where that came from.
I would certainly be interested to read the rest of these stories, or anything else by Woolrich.
Also I`m feeling pretty bad that I didn`t even come close to my book readin' goal.
like some sort of short story collection that I could read...
And for what it's worth, this story would be better if it were part of a collection...
of other short stories...
I guess not being able to track them on here doesn't mean that I haven't read them...
A nice short story that inspired Hitchcock to make one of his most celebrated films. This film is a favourite of my sister and I. A good tale, very quickly told, with a few characters missing - there wasn't much time to go into detail about much else than the suspicion of the murder itself. Jeffries comes to some pretty impressive conclusions from his wheelchair. As good a detective as his friend Boyne.Worth reading because it is a short story, but not as good as the film.
I think Hitchcock's scenarist/the script had really improved Woolrich 's fairly bare bones tale. I think the film adaptation was much better. I still did not understand how the murderer figured out who was watching him, and, in general, if he assumed that he was being watched, then why he did not just lower the curtains....
It's okay if you die of dread after reading this.
2,2
I read this short mystery story originally in the 1960's.
Wonderful.
Psychological thrills inside ones own mind, how amazing is that?
I read this for class; can't wait to watch the movie!I thought it was very good, but it was so short I don't really think I should give it more than 3 stars...
Read for my Literature and Film uni module.I expected there to be more of a twist. It felt like everything was geared towards the big action scene at the denouement and from the off it was sort of obvious what would happen.The setting was really difficult to get my head around. I feel like adapting this to film was a good idea since the layout of the rear windows was a confusing jumble most of the time. It was a very visual story, but the description fell short.Still, it was alright.
Like many I come to the story after being a long time fan of the film. Cornell Woolrich's deceptively simple idea is captivating. I'm equally impressed with John Michael Hayes's screenplay adaptation that creates a love interest and a spunky nurse that have more personality than the valet portrayed here.
Only read this if you don't have neighbors who seem to know too much about you. It's just a little creepy, ha. But also quite interesting -- both because of the plot of the story itself, and because it inspired contemplation about the little things I observe in others' lives, and they in mine. "The chain of little habits that were their lives unreeled themselves."
My Rating System:* couldn't finish, ** wouldn't recommend, *** would recommend, **** would read again, ***** have read again.
Read it for school, and also saw the movie! It was interesting, even tho I like old movies
