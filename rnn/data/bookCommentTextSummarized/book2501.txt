He was immersed in certain Western cultural references from Marcus Aurelius to Bertrand Russell.
Lin is speaking to as well as of the dead.Lin’s descriptions of the regional differences of China are often racist to modern sensibilities.
Lin had been in a certain sense conned into his role as explicator of Chinese culture to the West.
On the one hand he has his Chinese heritage; on the other he has his Western education.
Ultimately it’s insulting to everyone.Postscript: it is interesting to compare this book with a more recent assessment of Chinese culture.
Common sense and insights are highly flexible, and that's why Chinese people are not people with strong principle: we present different values in different circumstances: "All Chinese are Confucianists when successful, and Taoists when they are failures." Confucianism (a positive philosophy) and Taoism (a defeatist philosophy) are fundamental to Chinese mentality: Confucianism is our culture, our rule of decorum, our declared value, but Taoism (the very opposite of Confucianism) is our nature, our poetic/romantic soul, our relief from the hypocrisy of Confucianism.Central to Taoism is the idea that life is so full of sorrow that the only way to be happy is to be indifferent, and once we are indifferent, happiness comes naturally.
Lin Yutang was a Chinese Nobel-Prize nominee writing in the first half of the 20th century, mainly with the purpose of explaining Chinese culture to the West.
Sometimes, his insight is prophetic, as in one section where he states that if Communism were to take hold in China, it would be changed beyond recognition (as is true with the socialist-authoritarian-market-free-for-all-capitalism that exists in China today).
Finally, there's the historical bias of relying too much on early 20th century eugenical history in explaining the Chinese characteristics as a result of evolution.All in all, though, I recommend this book to those interested in China.
The book is almost a century old and I guarantee you that most Chinese look very different at a glance. But if scraping off the communist ideology on the surface Chinese are still very much the same people, especially the intellectuals.This is also a very quotable book, full of little gems (think Oscar Wilde).Highly recommended.
"So they fell more seriously to business of living than to the business of making progress. They took infinite pains and spent sleepless nights over the planning of their private gardens or the cooking of sharks' fins, and fell to eating with the seriousness and gusto of an Omar Khayyam, who trailed the dust of philosophy in vain and took again the vine for his spouse..." How true it is -- here's someone who can't sleep because of thinking too hard about making some chicken soup... A note at the beginning of part II

If one wants to understand Chinese people in 20th century, there is no better than this.
Most of all, "My Country..." is worthwhile because of Lin's brilliant explanation of the opposing roles of Daoism and Confucianism in Chinese society. Lin has a fast-paced and very quotable style--this proved useful for getting through some dull parts of the book.The chapter on Chinese literary life is essential and provides very good background for recent events like the New Culture movement. Lin's opinions on race and gender roles might be offensive to modern readers but I think they're interesting insofar as they more clearly illuminate the worldview of a undeniably brilliant Chinese scholar.
This was an interesting read in the fact that I could still see quite a bit of overlap in Chinese culture that he described of the early 20th century and current Chinese culture. I didn't really appreciate his commentary of Christianity and thought it surprising that he could have a pastor as a father and yet be so misinformed about Christianity. I also didn't really care for his ethnocentric overtone that Chinese culture is superior, but I guess that in itself is a rather common element of Chinese culture.
Lin Yutang writes here in a systematic approach to a western audience about China and Chinese culture. Still prescient even today, after nearly seventy years, Lin truly understands what it is to be Chinese and conveys that to his audience, and is frank and sincere about China's shortcomings and positives. Highly recommended at the time of its publishing, it ought to remain so today.
I don't agree with everything he writes here, especially as it is dated by now, but it's an accomplishment that he even got this far, and the way he is able to weave in cultural references from the East and the West is a feat in itself.
Some years ago I read and really enjoyed The Importance of Living, so I thought I might like this book, which I found at a used bookstore. Lin Yutang writes beautifully, and has an interesting take on things, but ultimately I found long stretches of this book rather tedious.
Old Chinese Scholar reflects on Chinese culture, mentality, style, lifestyle, etc. And because it's an old Chinese dude, it's super "Chinese things are awesome!"By the way, it made me realize how Chinese I am. Shoot.
Anyone contemplating spending time in China should read this book. I wish I had BEFORE working in Shanghai.
If you need read one book to understand China, this is the one

great for the study of chinese character~
Great introduction to Chinese culture. Really enjoyed the first several chapters, which are about the characteristics and personality of Chinese people. Worth reading.
very interesting to read 1935 views re the Chinese people.
a large portion out-dated, some ideas still interesting
What did China look like in 20th century in the eyes of a scholar who had been deeply influenced by western cultures and literatures. But he still had neutral opinions on many of the issues.

Rather tedious overall, but many parts of it were very insightful (and quotable!)
I have just bought this book,and I'm going to read it.You know,this book was written by a Chinese.I'm proud of it,and I believe it is a wonderful book.
这本书的本意是向外国人介绍中国的各种思维与社会习性。是否准确个人来看我没有结论 _(:з」∠)_ 为了能准确看懂其引用，看的是中文版(吸取了上次看辜鸿铭半途而废的教训 😂) 可惜有人说翻译因为政治敏感有零碎而散落的删节。上半部讲基本要素的没啥特别大感触 但是感觉下半部除了女性那部分真的写的很好很好，给人全新的perspective，very refreshing.这位大佬对女性的看法can really use some maojor update. 毕竟是写出red peony的人，也是追求爱情的角色，怎么就会那女人和肉鸡相比，还说女性啥成就都不如有个可爱孩子，看得我一脸懵。看来还是鲁迅说得对，还是该追求经济基础，所谓爱情自由绝非解放女性。对鲁迅的崇拜之情更上一层楼。update：其实他在总结观点，他个人虽然也倾向女性应该behave femininely，但是可以用时代局限性来解释。第六章 社会生活和政治生活法制政府与人治政府的韩非子一节真的有点mind blowing，把很多本来只能算作是objective opinion的东西的逻辑理顺了，喜欢。是这本书里最好的一节了，发人深省。
