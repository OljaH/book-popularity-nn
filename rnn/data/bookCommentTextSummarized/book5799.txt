I would like to start with a disclaimer that in 1950 - the year the book was published - the word "virgin" did not mean a particularities of female anatomy, but rather an inexperienced naive young girl.
I made this disclaimer not to give you the wrong impression that Perry Mason stopped practicing the law and became a gynecologist; he had not.
This time was not an exception: the clue was the one Mason overlooked until practically the very end and I had not, but I still had to wait for his final explanation to figure out the identity of the culprit.
We are introduced early on to the character of the “vagabond virgin,” a young woman of about 20 years.
During this process, she has accepted rides from various drivers to achieve her destinations.
Throughout all this early part of the story, our vagabond is portrayed as a naïve young woman of impeccable character.
The reader is cruelly manipulated throughout this story by Gardner, such that he doesn’t know what to believe.
Misdirection is a primary tool of the mystery novel, but such over-use as we find in this one is an abuse of the author’s power.
I couldn’t rate this novel very high.
An enjoyable Perry Mason mystery from the late 1940s whose title and opening chapter telegraphs many of the critical elements of the mystery and its ultimate solution. However, the red herrings and plot turns keep you reading until the end, although much of this would be implausible in 2016.
Entertaining. Perry Mason in the late 40s.
Solid installment in the Perry Mason series, and the perfect reminder of why the "good old days" were not good for everyone...
basically if you were a woman (or any minority) life was rough.
We are reminded that women were not allowed to rent hotel rooms alone, go out after a "reasonable" hour in the evening unescorted, or exist at all sans man.
Anyway, equality of the day aside, the book is a fun little mystery that provides more clues than most Perry Mason stories, AND contains a wholly satisfying cross-examination!
Don't try to stop mid-scene, because it is just so good ;)
If I ever go to jail, I want my lawyer to be Perry Mason :D
Good, but not great. I foresaw the correct solution much early in the story. Personally, because of that maybe, I wanted this book to end sooner.Anyways, loved the court scene, as always.
I am getting better at picking out the clues! Only about a million more of these to read in my 'Read all Perry Mason' quest!!!!
This was not originally on my list of to-read "classic" Perry Mason novels (although it was adapted early in season 1 of the TV show), but reading a description of it later caught my eye.
Basically Perry realized that the prosecution assumed the facts in the case supported a certain interpretation but needn't necessarily do so.
The machinations of the "vagabond virgin" and her blackmailing ring (boy is there a LOT of blackmailing in these Perry novels) were interesting, and Perry's plot to give one of the blackmailers a forged check in order to get him in trouble works out a little too well, adding to interesting complications.All in all, I wouldn't recommend this unless you're looking for a "deep cut" Perry novel.
It's a decent detective story with lot of suspense but nowhere close to Sherlock Homes adventuresses. I think the influence of Sherlock Holmes is too heavy on me so I spontaneously tend to compare other detective characters with the greatest one. Nevertheless, I enjoyed this story but don't think I will read another Erle Stanley book unless I'm bored.
An enjoyable mystery. A little confusing at times but, that's what makes Perry Mason stories so much fun. These are period novels and since they were written in the time frame of their setting, there are no anachronisms. It makes you wonder what Perry, Della and Paul could do with cell phones and laptops.
Olen seda küll kunagi varem lugenud, aga ikkagi oli väga põnev. Kaasahaarav ja kuigi lõpplahendus ei võtnud just suud ammuli, oli ta piisavalt etteaimamatu. Ma arvan, et üks mõnusamaid Masoni-lugusid.
2.5 rating from what I remember
My Rating System:* couldn't finish, ** wouldn't recommend, *** would recommend, **** would read again, ***** have read again.
The fictional attorney became the basis of a number of television series (reputedly 271 episodes), and achieved an enviable record for winning his cases.Erle Stanley Gardner has an amazing sales record: at the height of his popularity in the mid-1960s he was selling an average of 26,000 copies of his novels a day, making him one of the world's best selling author's, easily outstripping at the time Agatha Christie and Barbara Cartland combined.Born in Massachusetts, Gardner went on to attend Law School in Indiana, but this only lasted for around a month, being suspended because of various distractions to his studies, especially boxing.
#32 in the Perry Mason series.
The plot is convoluted, red herrings abound, and there are courtroom pyrotechnics.
All is solved by Perry in an implausible, though very enjoyable, exposition.Perry Mason series - Addison, partner in a large department store, is returning from a business trip.
Then Addison’s business partner is found murdered…As usual, there are several possible suspects for the crime, and it’s up to Mason, with the able help of Paul Drake and Della Street, to uncover the killer.
Good courtroom scenes in this one.
The best Perry Mason novel I've read so far.
The courtroom scenes, which I usually find a little boring and repetitive and somehow still hard to follow, were probably the best part - full of humor, easy to follow, and gripping.A young woman named Veronica Dale hitchhiked across the country to California, and a department store owner named Addison picked her up.
Addison hires Mason to help Veronica out, but once she's free everything gets even crazier.
When Addison is arrested for murder, Mason, Della Street, and Paul Drake investigate to find out who Veronica really is and what she's really been doing.
A department store tycoon picks up an innocent young girl who is charged with vagrancy. The tycoon wants Perry to get her out of jail. Perry gets her out but then she's charged with a murder. Perry has to work hard to find the answers to solve this case. A good story in the series. The courtroom action is where Gardner shines.
Как первое знакомство с Перри Мейсоном подойдет, книжка ушла за вечер. В целом, я думаю (предполагаю пока что), что должны быть более крутые произведения с этим героем. А эту книгу выбрала лишь по тому, что у меня был бумажный вариант, а мне что-то уж очень захотелось книги в бумаге.
Too many virgins, not enough vagabonds. Perry Mason is a good lawyer for 1943, but Nancy Grace would DESTROY him.
What a two-timing, hypocrite little hussy! I hope she'll get her karma. Disfiguration because of an accident will be very welcome, or premature aging...
Read this for my "reading" book club and am really glad I did. What fun! Now I have to track down some more Perry Mason stories--preferably starting with the first and then reading all 80plus.
I never thought I would enjoy Perry Mason story, but it was excellent.
You really have to think outside the box to figure this out. The solution is very logical. Good read.
That was a good one, nice and funny.
This is my least favorite Perry Mason book. The plot is still good, but the characters weren't very sympathetic. I found myself getting really annoyed with the client in this novel.
An excellent Perry Mason novel.
My first Perry Mason, but not my last.
An entertaining, page-turning Perry Mason mystery with murder (of course), blackmail, riveting court scenes, clever twists, and a satisfying conclusion. Loved it.
