This book is very good and I highly recommend it to those interested in an introduction to and an overview of how regional religious tradition and myth (observational and ethical) relate to one another, specifically in the Hebrew tradition and how it relates to Sumer, Babylon and Egypt. I strongly recommend that one get the paper version rather than the kindle, as the kindle edition, which I read, had none of the illustrations which were referenced in the text.
This would probably only interest someone interested in Biblical archeology, or tracing the origins of Biblical literature. There are some interesting facts it draws out, but is only worth it if you have a keen interest in the subject to begin with.
