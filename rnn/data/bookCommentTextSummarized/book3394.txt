And if he does, what he can lay in on is, he always figured he was so damn smart," goes the opening paragraph.
An unusual, intriguing opener.PACE=5: In a blisteringly fast 8 pages, Cain pretty much tells the entire story of "Postman Always Rings Twice":PLOT =4: A man meets a married woman and they decide to kill her old man (standard plot for this genre).
He has an affair with Lida (rather blank as far as character), the married woman.
But in only 8 pages, Cain gives us his best in:ATMOSPHERE/PLACE=5: The town is frozen, literally and figuratively.
Somewhat different from the movie version, but it works.Mildred Pierce - Going between 3 and 3.5 stars.
And is anybody going to get killed yet?" I think this one deserves a reread though, considering that it is so different from Postman and Indemnity.Selected Stories - "Pastorale"'s narrative voice didn't do a whole lot for me, but "The Baby in the Icebox" was pretty interesting.
So a bit underwhelming on the short story front, perhaps because I was on a Cain burnout, especially with the marathon that is Mildred Pierce.In short, if you get this collection, don't read it all at once!
After that one-two punch, Mildred Pierce is a strong contrast.
It's good stuff and in quiet contrast to the flashy and brutal early stories, though still manages to pack a few punches and some emotional heft.
I quite enjoyed it.I also quite enjoyed the short stories rounding things off, in particular Baby in the Ice Box which was just bonkers and the brief but powerful Brush Fire.Cain has a way with language that strikes to the core.
There's a distinct poetry in the prose contrasting with the harshness of the people and the lives he portrays.I'm compelled to add a copy to my personal shelves.
I really enjoyed rereading The Postman Always Rings Twice and Double Indemnity, but it was my first-time reading of Mildred Pierce that really made an impression on me.
Mildred felt like a real person to me, I rooted for her and wanted her to succeed, but it was her dangerously dysfunctional relationship with her eldest daughter, Veda, that was the heart and soul of the novel and was fascinating to watch it unfold over the years.
At times reading this book kind of felt like what it must be to stand by watching two cars in a high-speed head-on collision.
I had previously read the longer works in this collection but kept it kicking around until I could get to the short stories.
They were great reads and Cain doesn't lose any of his skill when penning shorter work.
Although I've read and reviewed the novels before, I would be doing a disservice to those who have not if I didn't mention how awesome Cain is.
Tom Wolfe is quoted as saying that even Chandler can't approach what Cain has done in those works.
Cain's work maybe captures the struggling restless human character a bit better, but Chandler's writing is more witty and captivating.
Each of the three novels was better than its predecessor, and the short stories at the end are like lovely niblets of almost-too-ripe fruit and delicious stinky cheese after a fine three-course meal full of fat and cholesterol.
You love every bite, even while dreading the inevitable heart attack.This entry is specifically for the Selected Stories portion of the compilation (I noted and reviewed the novels individually).
The best summary I can think of is a New York Times quote on the back of the book: "Cain can get down to the primary impulses of greed and sex in fewer words than any writer we know of."
Cain is a master
I don't know what to say about these.
These stories know how to move.Three novels in my edition, and five short stories.
Of the novels, Mildred Pierce by far the longest, surprisingly slow and subtle in comparison with the reckless pace of the first two.
Pierce also the least satisfying ending.
Double Indemnity the most satisfying ending, and maybe the most satisfying overall.

West Coast America in the 1930s was obviously a tough place. Few jobs, prohibition, scandals, and lots of murders - and the people all seem uneducated.I liked 'Double Indemnity' which had some similarities with the classic 'The Postman Always Rings Twice' with a murder, insurance fraud, sex and a sad ending. 'Mildred Pierce' filled half the book and was a very different story with Mildred making a life for herself out of pure hard work just to see her daughter throw everything back at her. The short stories were fine and gave a good conclusion to this body of work.
If you are a fan of film noir, these are the stories the movies were based on. I also really enjoyed reading Mildred Pierce in particular even though it does not read as dark as Postman or Double Indemnity. Will not describe any more as it would spoil the plots.
What else can I say? Cain is a master.
i only read the postman always rings twice. it wasnt that good.
If it hadn't been for Mildred Pierce, I would have given the book a slightly lower rating than the four stars I've given it now, because for me this psychological novel was by far the best bit of the book. The Postman always rings twice and Double Indemnity weren't bad either, but they were crime stories, and that is just not as much my thing as a good psychological novel is :-)My ratings:The Postman always rings twice ***Double Indemnity ***Mildred Pierce *****Pastorale **The Baby in the Icebox **Dead Man ***Brush Fire ***The Girl in the Storm **
This is a Review for The Postman Always Rings Twice (read in this collected edition).This book is particularly interesting and much deserving of its place in the lexicon of noir/crime fiction, while at the same time being an obvious early novel of a great master. The plot is tight, while the writing, at times, is lacking in finesse and clarity. Cain appears to be feeling his way around long form fiction, which he does become a master of. More after I finish Double Indemnity.
I bought this book for a mere song at Strand Books in NY, and what a find it turned out to be! Mr. Cain stands tall next to the great names of his age, Steinbeck, Hemingway, and in noir, Chandler. I preferred Double Indemnity, but all the stories are outstanding. His writing is precise and concise, so the stories are generally not long. All of them plays out in California in the time between WW1 and -2, the era of the Great Depression.
Mildred Pierce: I liked this, even though it's what I'd class as a "pot boiler" (melodramatic). I think Mildred was pretty deluded about Veda, and so, about a lot of things in her life. Double Indemnity is quite different. Love Walter Huff's character voice - very unsentimental, dry kind of narration. It reminds me a little of the William Holden character in Sunset Boulevard. I love the movie; for me, the movie reproduces the tone of this short story quite accurately.
Picked this up at Cracked and Spineless in Hobart the other day. The two noir novellas are exquisite, Mildred Pierce is a slow-burner but a good read too, and the stories are a bit of a mixed bag. But The Postman Always Rings Twice and Double Indemnity (the latter my favourite) are unparalleled.
rating the stories together as an overall book, i’d say it was a good way to pass the time. nothing amazing; nothing terrible. my favorite of the stories is probably mildred pierce.
I first read this like a decade ago and I absolutely loved it. I should reread it.
A Pioneer Of American NoirJames M Cain (1892 -1977) is best remembered for a series of novels he wrote while working as a screenwriter in Hollywood during the 1930s, including "The Postman Always Rings Twice", "Double Indemnity" and "Mildred Pierce".
Cain's writing is tough, descriptive, colloquial, and short.The two short works in this collection, "The Postman Always Rings Twice" and "Double Indemnity" are stories of murder and violence.
It does not involve a murder, but it shows even more than the shorter novels the darker aspects of human nature and the effects of lust and greed.Cain's major character, Mildred Pierce, is a strongly and complexly drawn figure.
Well, lucky me: I found another great author, and will most likely seek out some more of his stuff.The Postman Always Rings Twice - - 4 stars - -So the title is misleading.
Okay, the story's short and finishing it in one sitting isn't exactly a feat, I know, but that it's such a page turner 
Beware those femmes fatales and never, ever screw around with insurance companies.Mildred Pierce - - 5 stars - -There's a few things I'd like to establish about Mildred Pierce:(1) I'd never heard about it, and the blurb on the jacket didn't really give anything away in the manner of hints as to what it's about.(2) Dubbed "a classic from the master of the noir novel", I reasonably expected it be, well, noir (at least noir-ish).
Postman and Double are variations on what is essentially the same story: Scummy man finds married couple, seduces wife, schemes to murder husband, husband dead, things get a bit pear shaped.Mildred is longer than Postman and Double combined.
Pretty good story, but could be based on the true life story of millions of women's lives.
It's good that the story is longer, because Cain actually takes the time to develop and tell a story this time.
However, so many women have actually lived this story in real life that there is nothing remarkable about it.
Baby in the Icebox is pretty good if you can manage to read it in spite of the "colorful" language.
The NYT recently ran a piece by Michael Connelly about The Cocktail Waitress, a long-lost, recently rediscovered, newly published Cain novel.
"Holy moly," I thought, "I need to read that!" So I promptly got on the library waitlist for it.
I was not unfamiliar with the plots for these novels, I thought; I'd seen the movies.
Cain gets into the meat of things quickly, his characters' lives twisting and turning on thin dimes of chance.
There are some scenes of each piece that I am still thinking about.
And I am still thinking of two particular scenes with Ray in MP.
Read April-May 2011: The Postman Always Rings Twice & Double IndemnityEven though I love noir movies, I've read very little of the pulp fiction from which those movies drew their inspiration.
There is something especially American about Cain's crime stories that I like; something borne out of two poles of the Great Depression and the American Dream.The Postman Always Rings Twice is about a drifter who gets seduced by a housewife into murdering her husband for his money.
Double Indemnity is about a straight-laced insurance man who also gets seduced by a housewife into murdering her husband for the money.
where hammett's books are written from the p.o.v. of law & order, cain usually takes the opposite vantage: the sociopath, or one finding his or herself at odds.
i haven't read all the stories in this edition and look forward to them.
his dialogue is incredible, often running a full page without he-saids, and she-countered, and always moves the story in new directions.(from here raymond chandler takes over, with a protagonist who's been on both sides of the law, in novels whose prose is hot as a hound in a boxcar barrelling past a full harvest moon)
Cain is classic hard-boiled, fast-talking, sexy stuff.
But they’re great – the characters are making decisions from a place of desperation and raw emotion, and they have nothing to lose.
I mean, I really wanted to slap her and scream that her daughter is a complete bitch, and why can’t she see that and really beat the snot out of her and torch her shit and throw her out?!
There’s something about a pushover woman with a bratty, psychotic bitch of a daughter that really pisses me off.
Oh, but Cain did so much more with it, it was fabulous.
Cain's "The Postman Always Rings Twice" is an early noir, a grizzly tale of murder and scandal set (and written) in the 1930s.
Nick is in search of hired help, and offers Frank a job.
Frank takes one look at Nick's wife Cora and accepts the offer.
Soon Frank and Cora begin an impassioned affair.
Its the sort of writing that doesn't waste the reader's time, doesn't indulge in artifice and beg to be recognized as art.Like many hard-boiled crime novels, "The Postman Always Rings Twice" is viscerally fascinating.
The postman always rings twice -- the results of our actions cannot be escaped.
This amazing collection of novellas and short stories shows James M.
It doesn't focus on murder, sensation, extremes, but instead is a novel of economics, is a novel about how people survived the Great Depression, and the personal compromises that people have to make in order to eat, to have self-respect, and to fulfill the pressure of the internal and external forces at work on them.
This is one of those great pulp fiction collections that is worth reading by lovers of literature and by creative writers.
Weird, creepy, and sordid with the added twist that criminals are stupid.
Frank is fundamentally stupid; he couldn't think his way out of a paper bag.
Walter Huff is fantastically stupid for someone who can actually think several moves ahead of most people.
The stupidity shows in two ways with Walter: one, he can be easily manipulated emotionally; two, he can't think of any other solution save murder.
Mildred may not have "class", but she's got gumption.
Cain's spare, nuanced writing, particularly his dialogue, makes MILDRED PIERCE as moving a novel of the Depression as THE GRAPES OF WRATH.
I think that if you are into comic books, film Noir or Murder then this is the book for you.
There is no wasted words and almost every line I could see as a panel in a comic book.This is is a collection of stories I was very pleased by all of them.
It's more like you are peering into a brief moment in time, taking part in murder, cover up and the consequences of the crime.
I found them that good.If you like Hobo's, Motivated women, the Darkside of people then you will like this collection of stories.
