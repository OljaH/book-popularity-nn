I have only read one other Ishiguro novel and that is Never Let Me Go. Nevertheless, I too was intrigued about what would happen when a highly-acclaimed author of literary fiction transitioned into fantasy.
I would say I was mildly surprised that Ishiguro had convinced me to keep reading the last 300 pages when all I got was a fizzled out ending and no answers.Screw subtlety and interpretation!
But fight I shall and perhaps I will win!Yeah, that's not a direct quote, but I swear there are pieces of dialogue like that.And Axl calls Beatrice "princess" all the time.
Or can we only live with ourselves and one another through ignorance?Kazuo Ishiguro writes a spellbinding fable of one elderly couple's quest for memory.
Yet it is a fragile Britain where everything balances on the knife edge: social mores, the civilizational veneer, lifelong marital love, peace itself.
Memory plays a double-role here.
It holds everything together, pulling back from the edge, while also supplying that gentle, lethal nudge off the cliff.
The memory of an infidelity.
Shades of Orpheus.In Ishiguro's Edenic world, his characters desire a god-like knowledge of the past but at what personal cost?
1 star - I don't often feel guilty at not being able to finish a book, but I do this time.
No. My mind kept blanking out and thinking important thoughts like did I add "kitchen paper" to the shopping list or did I specify that nice soft Viva one?
Failed.It wasn't just that the characters never seemed to be anyone, it was that I kept thinking they were symbols for something and that is why a master author, as Ishiguro certainly is, had written them in such a flat way.
All I got from the book was it was repetitious which made it tedious and not only were the characters forgetting everything, so was I.
The Arthurian setting seems to have been chosen to resonate with the novel’s themes of memory and forgetting—this is both a factually "forgotten" and a mythologically much-remembered time in English history—and also to evoke medieval romance, as a formal model for this kind of fabulistic, semi-allegorical narrative mode.The Buried Giant is interested in the way in which memory shapes national identities, often to devastating and destructive effect.
Πολλούς αιώνες πριν σε μακρινά και απομονωμένα μέρη της Αγγλίας ζουν άνθρωποι μέσα στη λησμονιά.
Τεράστιες περιοχές έρημες και εγκαταλειμμενες ειναι το σκηνικό που περιγράφεται με αριστοτεχνικό τροπο και μέσα σε μικρές κοινότητες πανομοιότυπες ζουν Βρετανοί και Σαξονες με σημαία τους την ομίχλη και τη λήθη.
Το παραμύθι του μεσαίωνα ξεκινά με ένα ζευγάρι ηλικιωμένων Βρετανών που ξεκινούν ένα μεγάλο και επικίνδυνο ταξίδι με σκοπό να βρουν το παιδί τους σε κάποια άλλη λησμονημένη περιοχή.
Φτάνοντας στην τελευταία σελίδα ολα τα μηνύματα του "θαμμένου γίγαντα" -ήδη γνωστά και αμιγώς ανθρώπινα- είχαν φτάσει με επιτυχία στην ψυχή μου μαζί με μπόλικη λύπη - θλίψη και μη αναστρέψιμη πραγματικότητα.
(B) 72% | More than SatisfactoryNotes: There’s meaning to be taken from its final few chapters, though the journey there is tiresome, plodding and colorless.
Updated 4/30/2015: For context, you should know that I’ve read three previous Ishiguro novels: The Remains of the Day, Never Let Me Go, and We Were Orphans.
I enjoy thinking about it on an intellectual level, but due to stylistic choices Ishiguro made, I did not connect with it the way I have with his writing before.The story takes place in post-Arthurian Britain at a time when the Saxons and Britons were living in tenuous peace with one another.
For the entire last thirty minutes of the interview, Ishiguro asks the guy all these questions about what fantasy books he should read, whether Neil Gaiman is cool, who is the typical age group for fantasy, what adult fantasy can do.
I suppose I'm used not only to Ishiguro's wit, but also to his keen ability to shift about in time.
I suppose it's mandatory if you've read all of Ishiguro.I've written reviews of other Ishiguro novels.
These include  A View of Pale Hills,  An Artist of the Floating World,  When We Were Orphans and  The Unconsoled.*With one exception, I do admire W.S. Merwin's translation of  Sir Gawain and the Green Knight: A New Verse Translation, but more for the poetry than for the myth.P.S. I disagree with Ms. Kakutani's view (NYT) that Ishiguro's prose here is "ham handed." It is not.
The theme I take to be the same.Impossible to imagine how a Japanese person, resident in Britain - two Imperial countries with bloody histories that those who have experienced them from a different perspective find that they have not come to terms with - since the age of five might have become so exercised with the issue of people hiding things that they would prefer not to admit to from themselves.
On the surface of it all, The Buried Giant is essentially a fantasy novel.Before you are going to throw in the towel though, let me assure you that The Buried Giant still has the impeccable prose and the craftsmanship one comes to expect from Ishiguro.
One day Beatrice vaguely remembers that the two of them have a son that lives in a different village, and convinces Axl to travel there so they could be together again.
As Beatrice and Axl remember more, and further details about “the mist” are revealed, so does the story unfold before the reader.So you think you are not a fantasy reader?
As someone who has read all of Ishiguro's previous works I was of course more than excited to finally get my hands on a copy of The Buried Giant.
The Buried Giant is very different from all of Ishiguro's other novels.
If there was any author who could get me excited about a fantasy novel, it was Kazuo Ishiguro.
I want to burst into Ishiguro's study and shout, "You wrote The Unconsoled and now you think you can pass off this sub-par fantasy novel as part of your oeuvre?!".
I need to think about this book. Changed my mind from 3 stars to 3.5 rounded off to 4. Mainly because Ishiguro's style of writing is beautiful to me. And the story telling too, although this story had its highs and lows. Not his best, but still... Ishiguro style. So, I thought about it, and this book did make an impression on me. Therefore, changed my view.... And this link: Neil Gaiman reviewing the book, I like his observations. http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/01/boo...
The answer to the second question is far more subjective and will very much depend on what each individual reader enjoys.The novel takes us into post-Arthurian Britain, populated with those mythic heroes, including a still-living Sir Gawain, yet there’s a twist here: A mist has fallen on Britain, forcing the isle into a collective loss of memory.
There are allusions to so many other classics: obviously, King Arthur and the Knights of the Roundtable, but also Orpheus and Dante’s Inferno (particularly in the character of Beatrice, the cherished soulmate), and certain childhood fables.We also get an in-depth look at universal themes: memory and forgetfulness, love and aging, war and peace (and how peace can hold “for ever built on slaughter and a magician’s trickery” and what it takes to be a good and a loving person.
Radnja ne ide brzo - Išiguro kao da je podredio radnju svojim glavnim likovima - napredujemo njihovim koracima, pri čemu smo i mi, čitaoci, često i sami obavijeni maglom, ali kada se magla rasprši dobijamo odgovore na sve ono što nas je mučilo: kakvu to prošlost dele Axl i Beatrice i šta se to krije u njihovoj magli, ko su zapravo ratnik i vitez i koje su njihove životne misije, ko proizvodi maglu i zašto magla ima takvo dejstvo na ljude, i koja je poenta samog naslova knjige...
A tale set in post-Arthurian England with knights, dragons, ogres, sword duels and magic spells to convey aspects of human nature that elude all kind of logic, such as love, forgiveness, war and revenge.Blending mythological legend and medieval epic, Ishiguro builds a world were people suffer from general amnesia.
For Axel and Beatrice, the old married couple and protagonists of this novel, forgetfulness is no longer a solution because they ache to remember what happened to their son, the cost of peace has become too high.
Nevertheless, a few images will remain with me, such as an old couple crossing a river trusting that their true love will beat any wrongdoings they inflicted on each other.
The idea of the old couple setting off on what amounted to a pilgrimage, the mist and the way people were losing memories and the beautifully executed writing style all added up to a possible five star read.
Towards the end when the old couple's story took the major focus again I regained my interest and was involved enough to appreciate the way events transpired.
So sadly it ends up just a three star book for me, one of those stars being entirely for the beautiful way this author uses words.
However, this is fantasy in the same way that Never Let Me Go is science-fiction, so the emphasis is on the characters’ relationships and their inner lives.
The fantasy elements are there to create a framework for the themes of memory and love that motivate the characters.
A few typical Ishiguro traits can be found, such as the emphasis on memory and sparse but evocative description, but it is unlike anything he has written in the past.
This is the kind of book that Tolkien might have written had he decided to focus on rich characterisation and relationships rather than the landscape.
Sklopila korice, privila na grudi i tiho zajecala. Ostala tako dugo.Vraticu joj se jednom ponovo. Do tada, o m i lj e n a!
There are certain writers - David Mitchell, Kate Atkinson, Hilary Mantel, Chiang Rae Lee - where I think, "OK, I'll follow you anywhere, no matter how weird or improbable that place you want to take me is." A Dutch enclave in 18th century Japan?
Ishiguro definitely holds his place in that pantheon of trust.
But it didn't work for me as a novel, and if Ishiguro's project was to deracinate his story so that we focused more on the concepts and less on the trappings of setting and narrative, then I think his project failed because the weird setting and characters distracted me, like a tooth that you can't stop worrying at.
Better to experiment and fail than get stuck in mediocrity.

It is simply a number.But yes, my 900th book and I was very excited.There are two things I wish to point out, firstly, I am an over-bearing high-fantasy, none of your twee-YA-mild-fantasy-rubbish, fan: a true high-fantasy, heavy-on-the-world-building-high-fantasy fan, and secondly, I have never read a book by Kazuo Ishiguro nor seen any adaptations of his works.
The whole thing smacked of "hey I know a secret but I'm not going to tell you 'til the end" and we didn't actually find much out at the end.What did I like?
On another level, ‘The Buried Giant’ is all about the ‘wrongs’ done at societal level, mass slaughter and genocide – the subsequent acceptance and justification of same and ultimately the rewriting of both memory and history in order to deliver an acceptable and palatable story, A process of forgetting, remembrance and rationalisation or suppression of the past.
Πολύ καλογραμμένο, αλλα και πολύ μελαγχολικό, παρόλο που τελείωσε κι καταπιάστηκα με άλλα καθημερινά πράγματα, συνεχίζει να με κυκλώνει μία ελαφριά θλίψη.3.5/5 αστεράκια.
The Buried Giant appeared suddenly and unexpectedly, without much fanfare - shouldn't it be a big deal?Ishiguro's latest book is very different from the two of his novels that I have read, The Remains of the Day and Never Let Me Go - both of which were set in contemporary, recognizable times.
Although the wars have ended, there is a sense of aversion between the two groups - and a mist seems to have fallen over the entire land, clouding memories and perception: there is talk of monsters and mythical creatures roaming in the wilderness.The novel focuses on an elderly couple, Axl and Beatrice, who set out on a quest to find their son whom they both only dimly remember having.
Ishiguro, The Buried GiantThere are times, I think, one must admit bewilderment and a certain lack of knowledge or learning to fully understand some novels, but can nonetheless say that the story impacted him; that, in a relatively short read, he inhabited the phenomenal, yet surreal, atmosphere of dense fog that enveloped the terrain and the faded memories of the protagonist medieval married couple (and of all the population in the mystical land); that he felt for the couple and their lost memories and, most importantly, that he has a deeper understanding, from having read this book, of how much memories are a significant part of who we are and of our love for those in our lives, and yet at the same time our love is more than memories: true love is in our souls and as long as we can see and know those we love, our love will not die, in spite of our vanishing remembrances.
And the narrators often leave their geographic comfort zone.THE BURIED GIANT is a combination myth, legend, allegory, adventure, and fantasy.
Are we better off not knowing all the shadows and corners of our past?
These latter are very different in content, but all three works of art explore the power of memory and how it affects our current ability to live an authentic life, and to genuinely know happiness and sorrow.
Is life better that way, to forget?
One of the things I always find about a Kazuo Ishiguro novel, is how labyrinthine and multi-layered they are.
I don't fully understand the book after a first reading, but this is a book I want to go back and read a second and third time, and sink further into its mysteries.This is a hazy, melancholic, and atmospheric novel that draws you deeply into its folds as you join Axl and Beatrice's quest for answers.
There is so much that could be said about this book, but I'm not the person to do it.
I'm still in thrall of the book, and of Ishiguro's ability.
I have no words.Here’s my first ever gif-only review. You’re welcome.
My favorite book from Ishiguro so far which is saying something since I given 5 stars to When we where orphans and The remains of the day is on my favorites list.
Axl and Beatrice would also like to solve the mystery of this mist, but first, they need to remember where their son lives.
Depending on where I was in the book, this was either a one star or a five star- so I'm going to come down right in the middle with three.The mist is so pervasive throughout this story that it almost a character all of its own: "It's queer the way the world's forgetting people and things from only yesterday and the day before that.

Since the end of the 1940s, in the aftermath of war, the truth has become so very important to our rebuilding of the world: we just want to know.
Maybe I'm reading this in because it fascinates me, rather than because it's there.All this is in the last hundred pages, by the way, because the other thing about The Buried Giant is that it's extremely meandering.
And you know as well as I do what a textbook Ishiguro Final Scene looks like.On a different note, I'm pretty sure his copy editor has the best job in the world.

An elderly couple, Axl and Beatrice, set out on a long journey to reunite with their son in another village, whom they haven’t seen in years.
There is a reason why the son and the elderly couple’s relationship went their separate ways but those memories are lost to them.
They meet a warrior and a Knight who are on a secret quest of their own, and the elderly couple have somehow become involvedThe Buried Giant is a beautifully written book and the dialect was perfect and realistic for the era.
*2,5*Φλύαρος ο Ishiguro..Πολλές ασήμαντες πληροφορίες και τόσο λεπτομερής,σε σημείο να κουράζει.Αλλιώς το περίμενα αλλιως μου βγήκε..Θα του δώσω αλλη μια ευκαιρία και θα διαβάσω κι αλλο βιβλιο του στο μελλον και βλεπουμε..Αν έχετε καποιο να μου προτείνεται γράψτε στα σχόλια,θα με διευκολύνατε 😃
I had heard a lot about this author which is why I put my name forward at The Reading Room for a copy.
I liked the concept of the choice of living with memories both good and bad as opposed to not remembering at all.
It is set in the time after King Arthur and we meet one of the Knights of the Round Table Sir Gawain, as Axl and Beatrice who he always calls ‘princess,’ go along on their journey to visit their son.
I think it is one of those books that some people will love while others like me, not so much.
When he leaves, the warrior is asked to take the child with him, and the two join the old couple.Along the way, they encounter a knight (names might be shared, but not the particulars, with characters from the Round Table), and in addition to Axl and Beatrice's quest to find their son, a quest to find (and, perhaps, slay) a dragon is added.In a slow, rambling journey, a number of familiar elements are worked in: a holy man in a monastery, malevolent pixies or spirits, the boatman that rows people to a mythic island...The boatman worked.
First of all, if your exposure to Kazuo Ishiguro is limited to *The Remains of the Day* or *Never Let Me Go,* you might be disappointed.
Second, if your exposure to this book is the promise of early Saxon/Briton/Arthurian mythology, you might be disappointed.
If, however, you're expecting an Ishiguro novel that merges, transcends, and subverts genre, then you're in good shape to enjoy this novel quite thoroughly.I did.
And an aged Arthurian knight is seeking, with the Saxon warrior, a dragon that has crippled the land with a magical mist.
It reminded me in many ways of his 1995 novel *The Unconsoled* (but in a good way).

I don't give 5 stars very often, but I felt this was far better than 4 stars. I have never read by Mr. Ishiguro before, but now I want to go back and read his others if this is any benchmark.An absolute delight of a book, we drift back to a post-Arthurian Britain. A Britain of Saxons and Britons, dragons and ogres, Christianity and magic, war and an uneasy peace.I loved this book. It was heartbreaking and thrilling. I highly recommend it.
Here, though, it took me much longer to become engaged: not until page 203 with the old knight's "first reverie" did I become enthralled with the prose and not until Chapter Eleven, some twenty pages later, with a scene that reminded me for some reason of the meerkats on the island in Martel's Life of Pi, did I become invested in the story.The ending is beautiful but not surprising; and despite Ishiguro's arguably uncharacteristic telling of an almost fable-like story with an ancient legend as its background, perhaps it's the lack of unexpected elements that caused the novel as a whole to fall rather flat for me.
Zakopani džin je definitivno Išigurovo delo, njegov stil je očigledan i prepoznatljiv već na prvi pogled.
To mogu da kažem iako sam pročitao samo još Ostatke dana.
Takodje mogu da kažem i da je Išiguro majstor svog zanata.
Kao i Ostaci, ovaj roman žudi za višestrukim čitanjem i sigurno ću mu se kad tad ponovo posvetiti.
Ali daleko od toga da su jednolični i dosadni, već su tako precizno izgradjeni da su čak i njihove senke zanimljivije od devedeset posto likova savremene književnosti.
Stvarno sam se nauživao čitajući ovaj roman (iako je potrajalo zbog nedostatka vremena), a na kraju...
Are you still there, Axl?Still here, princess.  Tengo muchas dudas sobre cómo puntuar este libro. Ahora le doy cuatro estrellas, pero quizá dentro de un tiempo sean tres, no lo sé. La historia es hermosa y a la vez triste, llena de metáforas, criaturas mitológicas, magia, amor, esperanza y memorias perdidas; todo eso en el contexto histórico de la guerra entre los sajones y los británicos (de la que recomiendo informarse apenas un poco antes de empezar esta novela).

Tengo muchas dudas sobre cómo puntuar este libro.
La historia es hermosa y a la vez triste, llena de metáforas, criaturas mitológicas, magia, amor, esperanza y memorias perdidas; todo eso en el contexto histórico de la guerra entre los sajones y los británicos (de la que recomiendo informarse apenas un poco antes de empezar esta novela).
El lado negativo del libro radica en los personajes, que están mal desarrollados.
Es por eso que tengo bastantes dudas sobre la nota.La narración es compleja, y no por la prosa, es preciosa, sino porque Ishiguro salta de la primera persona (que encima no es estable: cambian los puntos de vista) a la tercera.
Si no fuese tan pesado, este libro podría ser uno de mis favoritos.


Though this novel has a historical time and place, it does not qualify as historical novel per my definition because it describes a world full of ogres, fiends, dragons, and a mysterious mist that seems to cause people to lose their memories.
Thus a surface level reading of this story clearly places it within the fantasy genre.However, the reader is given hints that beyond the story's mysterious mist there may be an allegorical interpretation applicable to both personal relationships and modern racial conflict.
We learn that old memories of past injustices will lead in the future to the Saxons destroying the Britons.
