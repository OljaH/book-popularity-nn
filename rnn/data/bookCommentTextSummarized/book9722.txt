The Haunting of Hill House (1959) is justly revered as an exemplar of the horror genre, not only because its plot provides the template for all those haunted house tales to come, but also because its superb prose and subtle psychology transcend genre, transforming what might otherwise have been merely a sensational tale into a artful novel, worthy of a discerning reader.The novel suffers from its own pervasive influence, for, as soon as it gets underway, it seems‚Äîwhether or not you've seen either movie version‚Äîwoefully familiar.
Only the house is tangible in a way.****I love the playfulness in Shirley Jackson, and the first conversation, when all four characters are sitting around talking, is a marvelous example of it.
You have Eleanor and her sister, of course, at the beginning of the book, and then the tale of the orphaned sisters who lived in Hill House, and then Eleanor and Theodora themselves, who quickly become like sisters.
There's also a wonderful moment at the beginning of Chapter 4, where Eleanor and Theodora wake up after the first (uneventful) night at Hill House.
The book veers between said objectivity and long hallucinatory 'scary' bits, but I found those bits sort of messily written and vague to the point of being coy, and just scanned through them.I dunno, it's like a bunch of hipstery academic fucks try to have an adventure, and instead spend most of the time discussing the adventure they're currently having, instead of actually having it.Oh, and the last ten pages got a little more focused and they were sort of creepy, but I was kind of forcing it because I really wanted to get something more out of the book than I actually did.
‚ÄòIn the dark,‚Äô  she said, and closed the door behind her.Eleanor almost giggled, thinking of herself calling, ‚ÄòOh, Mrs. Dudley, I need your help in the dark,‚Äô and then she shivered.‚ÄùMrs. Dudley, despite being creepy on par with Mrs. Danvers from Rebecca, actually provides some comic relief throughout the story as her pedantic adherence to keeping to a specific time table amuses the guests and relieves some of the growing oppressiveness of fear that the house is beginning to impose upon the guests.
I cannot think of any time when material was in any way hampered by the presence of books." [186]There is an aura of authentic literary splicing here: the psychological novel (think Charlotte Perkins Gilman's "The Yellow Wallpaper") and the horror of microsocieties doing their malignant will-type stories (think "The Lottery", as exceptional a short story as this is a superb haunted house prototype, an ingenious fountainhead for all future horror maestros).
The haunted house is in actuality a person who is on the precipice, the verge of disaster; here is the quintessential tome about the inner demons becoming unleashed and wreaking havoc in horrific ways.A handsome legend, an essential myth.
It was also an utter mind-trip and I blew my whole thought-wad trying to keep up with her conflicting back and forth sense of "is it real or unreal‚Äù "is it genuine horror or psychological terror.‚Äù I admit by the end of this fairly short novel I was as drained and spent as a sailor on a weekend pass to Vegas.
One thing is very clear though‚Ä¶Hill House and people do not a good combination make and there is a growing sense of dread over the whole narrative from the very beginning.
I got this from the library and I can't figure out what to rate it so I had to go with a 3 for right now. Here's the thing. I loved the movies better than the book. But I did enjoy the crazy, through the rabbit hole ness of the book. It's not scary in the least. Not to me anyway. But it's good weird and just uggg I can't explain it. Anyway, sorry so short. I don't feel that good. I wanted to do a longer review on this one. üòïMel ‚ù§Ô∏è
Hill House seems to be an entity unto itself and maybe it is irritated and pained by these weak, sensitive, emotional creatures infesting it and wants them out of the picture so it can continue to walk alone.An amazing book by an amazing writer.
Weird, weird book. But well worth the time reading it.Jackson was a masterful storyteller, using a minimalistic approach and a terse, almost journalistic narrative, she creates a mood and sense of expectancy and mystery that grips the reader slowly and completely and lasts until the very end. And unlike other ghost stories that struggle with an ending, Jackson's haunted house tale brilliantly ends with the same mystery and psychological tension as the narrative held throughout, she leaves the reader without a falsely satisfying conclusion. A very good story told by a very good writer.
The Sgt Pepper and the Citizen Kane of ghost stories.
The only person in the world she genuinely hated, now that her mother was dead, was her sister.
By the time Eleanor admits her truth to the small crowd at Hill House, she had my affection so completely, I had to put down the book, I was so moved by her honesty:I haven't any apartment.
That's all I have, some books and things I had when I was a little girl, and a watch my mother gave me.
A woman who can fit all of her possessions in one car and declares that a haunted house is the only place she belongs.

The Haunting of Hill House is a slightly spooky read that follows four strangers into the depths of a haunted house with a mind of its own. "No one knows, even, why some houses are called haunted.""What else could you call Hill House?" Luke demanded. "Well - disturbed, perhaps. Leprous. Sick. Any of the popular euphemisms for insanity; a deranged house is a pretty conceit." What makes The Haunting of Hill H
"No one knows, even, why some houses are called haunted.""What else could you call Hill House?" Luke demanded.
Any of the popular euphemisms for insanity; a deranged house is a pretty conceit." What makes The Haunting of Hill House compelling is the book's narrative voice: This house, which seemed somehow to have formed itself, flying together into its own powerful pattern under the hands of its builders, fitting itself into its own construction of lines and angles, reared its great head back against the sky without concession to humanity.
The Haunting of Hill House is more readily a psychological thriller than a ghost story.
October Buddy Read with the Pantsless OnesWhen an occult scholar recruits people to help him research the paranormal events at Hill House, will the house let any of them leave unscathed?I've heard this touted as a classic haunted house story for decades and finally decided to take the plunge when the Pantless Ones picked it for an October read.
All of the characters seemed like caricatures to me rather than real people.
There were some creepy parts, like Eleanor holding a hand in the dark that turned out not to be whose she thought, and Eleanor's descent into madness, but I was pretty bored most of the time.
What a great classic horror story! It just may be one of the best, because of the year she wrote this booktruly makes it unique and a precursor of all or most of the haunted house stories to be written thereafter.The movie The Haunting old b&w based on this story is excellent and truly scary and creepy especially for that eraand so eerie and suspenseful and no blood and gore just an old fashioned scare the wits out of you haunted house story!
The Haunting of Hill House starts off as a straightforward story about a doctor and his eclectic guests moving into a haunted house for the summer, in order to record its weird happenings, but the novel swiftly transforms into an unsettling study of the links between repression, isolation, and fear.
Fast-paced stretches of dialogue lace the story with wit, and break up the protagonist‚Äôs ominous musings about loneliness and desire.
The novel is ridden with would-be symbols that resist clear-cut analysis: its true appeal lies in the eeriness of Jackson‚Äôs descriptions, the subtlety of her characterization, the suspense of her plot.
Shirley Jackson's The Haunting of Hill House is a fantastic story!
Like the House of Usher, Hill House draws you into its mystery and the unfolding terror.
From the outset, there is an undefinable sense of unease and dread.
The house finds a way to isolate visitors from the rest of the world, and frightens us with our own demons.
We see that happening to characters who have been invited to Hill House.
Just finding my way into the horror genre, but I can tell that Jackson's work set the tone for the best which followed.
Quote: ‚ÄúI am like a small creature swallowed whole by a monster, she thought, and the monster feels my tiny little movements inside.‚Äù And what I think is the best opening paragraph in all of literature: "No live organism can continue for long to exist sanely under conditions of absolute reality; even larks and katydids are supposed, by some, to dream.
Hill House, not sane, stood by itself against its hills, holding darkness within; it had stood so for eighty years and might stand for eighty more.
"Nothing in this house moves, until you look away, and then you just catch something from the corner of your eye." A lurid phantasmagoria of terror obscuring the facets of reality and the metaphysical. Discombobulation is an understatement even for the most astute of readers whereby mental aberration fuses with psychic disturbances to create a timely classic that uncovers the frailties of the human psyche. Come along, dear visitor, relinquish, abdicate, give yourself willingly to the house's et
Four impeccably flawed characters namely Eleanor Vance, Dr. John Montague, Theodora, and Luke Sanderson, are thrown into the twisted bowels of Hill House.
What horrors lie there, no one claims to know, but what they are about to experience while inside that house is more than what the mind can actually comprehend.
Is this disturbance a product of the human mind, particularly, fear of the unknown, of knowing oneself, of uncovering the deepest, darkest parts of the unconscious?
The Haunting of Hill House is not horrifying per se, as most of you might expect.
What makes it so fascinating even to those of us who don‚Äôt believe in it?Eleanor Vance isn‚Äôt sure she believes in it, and yet she agrees to spend a summer at an unoccupied house purported to be haunted.
What induces fear in Eleanor and the other guests of Hill House is their inability to reconcile observed phenomena with fact-based logic at the moment it occurs.
It is suffocatingly frightful, I say.So for those who don‚Äôt believe in ghosts, how many of you would be willing to spend a few nights in a house considered haunted by restless spirits?

The Haunting of Hill House wasn‚Äôt awful, but it was most definitely a slow roller and more of an eerie tale rather than a scary one.
The Haunting of Hill House didn‚Äôt quite stand the test of time like We Have Always Lived in the Castle did.
The combination of me inviting myself to their party so late and the fact that keeping the Pantsless Ones on topic is kind of like herding cats has led me to not even being positive who is or isn‚Äôt reading this one.
Stephen King has credited Shirley Jackson as a great influence on his writing, and other authors such as Neil Gaiman and Nigel Kneale also owe a lot to her work.The story revolves around four main characters, Dr. John Montague, Eleanor Vance - who is the shy viewpoint character - Theodora, a more confident independent young woman artist, and the irresponsible Luke Sanderson - the young heir to Hill House.
Jackson expertly controls her characters into revealing none of the facts before suspense has been allowed to build to an all-time maximum, and that is truly where the excellence of this novel lays.My first encounter with Jackson's writing was in her short story collection, Dark Tales.
This is what has continued to haunt me long after finishing this book and what makes me already eager to return and unearth the facts amongst the many deceptions.Hill House, with its chill, atmospheric setting, enthralled me from the first page and didn't let go until the very last.
Speaking about Kelly, I have no chances whatsoever to write a better review than hers, but the guy can still hope, can't he?
Let me put you in the right mood for the review with some images: A couple of comments for the pictures above follow.
Sorry about the following rant related to book blurbs.
I saw blurbs that completely gave away the content the entire book, including the last page.
I saw blurbs that had no connection whatsoever with the books they were supposed to describe.
I provide the brief description of the plot for people unfamiliar with the book and movies.
2,5* / I don't know, maybe I'm too stupid to appreciate this story.I was basically bored throughout the whole book. I didn't feel anything for the characters and even the atmosphere didn't quite get to me.I liked the writing style though and Eleanor as a narrator was really interesting.I'm still having hopes for the Netflix show!! I heard nothing but awesome things about it, so I'm really curious about it.Update: I just finished the show and wooooooow that was heartbreaking and beautiful and SO well done.I can definitely recommend it.
The plot, of The Haunting of Hill House, is about three people named, Eleanor, Theodora and Luke, who are invited to stay in a supposedly haunted house for the summer to aid a scientist, Dr. Montague, in his pursuit of paranormal investigation.
The book started out as a tale about a creepy old haunted house and then turned into a story about a young mentally unstable woman losing her mind.I was disappointed by this book to be honest.
Was the house really haunted or was it all just in Eleanor's mind?This is one novel where the movie, or in this case movies, are better than the book.2.5 stars!
This book was certainly eerie, creepy, and haunting. It was elegantly written, and the characters and plot immediately sucked me in. I highly recommend this for anybody looking for a slightly spooky, easy-to-read classic. I can't wait to read more Shirley Jackson!
I adored We have Always Lived in a Castle, so I have no idea why I'm so surprised I loved this. "THIS HOUSE IS VILE" will be forever ingrained in my mind.
