14 Apr '13 Future commenters: if you disagree with the review, that is perfectly fine and normal. If you wish to add your own thoughts of the book, that's also perfectly fine. But please keep the ad hominems and accusations (and not just directed at me, but also other commenters) at home.Everyone's free to say what they wish on a public forum. But I am also free to moderate what goes on in my space. I've never deleted/moderated comments before, as that goes against my beliefs on free and public
I became a novelty; they liked having me around for the fun of it."Just like those girls know these foreigners only keep them around for the "fun" of it, and would just as easily toss them aside like a used condom.Rose Hathaway is the kind of girl who'd hook up with a guy just because he's hot.
But in fact, Rose seems to be only obsessed with looks (which is odd, considering her "occupation" as a guardian); you'd think considering what she's been through, she'd be a little less shallow than that."Me. Turning into Alberta.

So many people talk about Twilight and miss this super great book......I liked Twilight, but I had a hard time dealing with Bella.
She is the bodyguard to Lissa, a vampire princess that must attend school and keep out of the clutches of the dark side.
Rose is aggressive and hard headed, sometimes risking Lissa while trying to prove she is strong, but all the while terrified to let anyone else in.
LOL!!So get past Edward and Bella, not that I don't love them, and sink your teeth into Rose and Lissa's often dangerous lives.
*2017 lowered rating to 2 stars because realistically 3 was generous
*cough* Twilight *cough* It’s an old subject, so I won’t dwell on it, but let’s just say that there’s nothing terrifying about having your vampire body sparkle like you’re covered with diamonds.
It’s ridiculous.But this book isn’t.
I find the concept of having vampires be protected by guardians very interesting.
But it’s somewhat self-aware of its ridiculousness, so I had a blast watching it with lots of popcorn in front of me.
Give this series a try if you’re looking for a good boarding school story with a kickass heroine—whose love interest is not the top guy at school—and vampires that can control magic.
However this is somehow okay for this race because they can't breed amongst themselves and if you're a Dhampire male than you can just give up on the idea of ever having children because extreme chances are that you won't.The Dhamires are the Moroi's Guardians against another race of vampires, the Strogoi, who want to feast on Moroi flesh.But you'd think that, on behalf of your race, if you were a Dhampire and naturally stronger and tougher then these Moroi - you'd just conquer them and keep them as your slaves.

I gave this book 3 stars on my first read. I raised my rating after reading and liking it more on my second read.Addition : Why I think you should read VA instead of Covenant  The before : September 2010  I was a stubborn brat when it came to reading Vampire Academy. Part of me honestly thought that a vampire series couldn't impress me after experiencing how oversaturated the genre had become with depressing and lackluster characters and stories. Because of this, I went into my first read of VA
My review reflected the attitude that it was an easy read and somewhat entertaining - but what was the big deal?Apparently, there must have been something sparked because I started book 2 shortly thereafter and then found myself blazing through the rest of the series, getting more and more addicted with each book.
He is every characteristic that I'd want to see in a hero, without being turned into an arrogant and controlling asshole like you see in so many books featuring a larger-than-life male lead.Rose is one of my all-time favorite female leads.
Even after going through a complete series read, I still struggle with this, even though I liked some of the attitude shifts in the later books.
Best. Vampire. Saga. EVER. Just that. I dare anyone come and tell me otherwise. It is funny, witty, the plots are amazing, and the characters are great (well.... maybe Lissa is not great, but hey, she is just the one flaw). If you like vampire books, you must read it. If you hate vampire books, you must read it. What the hell, whether you like or dislike books in general, this book is a MUST HAVE. Because I say so (OK, me and thousands of people just like me) Twilight? What the hell is Twilight?
"If I let myself love you, I won't throw myself in front of her. I'll throw myself in front of you."    “Only a true best friend can protect you from your immortal enemies.”   This book is amazing!! I loved Rose and Dimitri!! I loved Lissa and Christian!! But I also loved Rose and Lissa! Vampire Academy not only has mystery,adventure and great romance that we all love but it also shows us the power of the friendship which we don't see a lot in books!So let's start from the beginning!!!We have
Vampire Academy not only has mystery,adventure and great romance that we all love but it also shows us the power of the friendship which we don't see a lot in books!So let's start from the beginning!!!We have 3 kinds of vampires!1)MoroiThey are good vampires who live and die like normal humans but they have fangs and they drink human blood (they don't kill the person who drink from).
They are protecting Moroi from Strigoi.So, Rose(Dhampir) and Lissa(Moroi) are best friends who run away two years ago.
I also loved when he set Ralf on fire because he was mean to Lissa and Rose.4)MiaI hated her in the first book.
So I said I wouldn't read this after being warned about 10 million times that they stop being worth the bother after book 3. I said it repeatedly, earnestly... and then I caved. I mean, what do you do when you've nothing ahead of you but a day at the library and when you turn around...dum, dum, dum... there it is, the internationally praised series that you swore you would never... but then what if you felt different?... how can you expect to deal with not finding out for yourself? So I guess I
So I said I wouldn't read this after being warned about 10 million times that they stop being worth the bother after book 3.
I'm not surprised I liked the writing style seeing as I'm already a Richelle Mead fan after reading her Succubus series.
It did make me really want to read book 2 but I will be progressing with caution throughout.
I couldn't help myself, I've been warned countless times and read reviews that talk about Mead's later failures with this series, but I still had to find out for myself.

If I’m able to love someone else one day, I will do whatever it takes to hold on to him. No matter the cost."

This is a story from Tasha's point of view and we learn what happened the day that Christian's parents become Strigoi!
I will admit even though I didn't like Tasha (view spoiler)[ from her actions in Last Sacrifice  (hide spoiler)] , I understand her a little better!
This is a story from Lissa's point of view and we see how she faced the death of her parents and we also see what Lissa and Rose did after they left from St. Vladimir's Academy.
This is a story from Dimitri's point of view and we see his first thoughts about Rose!!!
This story is from Rose's point of view and I really like it!!
Maybe I’m inherently masochistic and my own worst enemy and I set myself up for failure when I’m at my most confident just to feel alive.It’s almost like if I gave a book 5 stars over a year ago, I’m MORE likely to hate it.
(Lol. First off like I’m not well into rambling already.) Vampire Academy follows Rose Hathaway, who’s a badass sassy sometimes girl-hating but not as often you’d expect dhampir.
I solved it obvs and figured out that Vampire Academy would be exactly 1,000,000 times more fun with the following provisions.) For one thing, probably 18% (so much math in this review I hate myself) of this book is the same worldbuilding info over.
I expected a cringe-worthy vampire book and turns out this was good!Very teen-angsty but I will definitely continue the series.PS Don't watch the movie... it was painful.
I love Rose ♥ She is seriously the best fucking heroine I have ever read.
(view spoiler)[Rose and Dimitri are one of those forbidden loves.
When they first meet Rose is 17 and Dimitri is 24.
You can't help who you're attracted too or who you love etc.
Dimitri believes in Rose and sees a great guardian in her.
Dimitri (sigh)♥ (hide spoiler)]Princess Vasilisa Dragomir (Moroi) is Roses best friend.
Rose plans to be Lisa's proctor.
Lisa meets a boy named Christian Ozera.
I love these two s0 much.♥ (hide spoiler)]I recommend this book and the whole damn series to everyone.
The heady mixture of vicious gossip, the supernatural, and adolescent sexuality (there's all kinds of making out) creates something compulsively readable and fun.Sure, the reader has to cope with sentences--stuck in the midst of dead serious scenes--that read "And then, suddenly, he was there, charging down the hallway like Death in a cowboy duster"; sure, the character development is about as subtle as a blow to the head.
So, while trying really hard to be a badass, she ends up looking like an immature brat, and I was like:By this point I had almost forgotten about the whole vampire thing, because the book was basically a cheaper version of Mean Girls, with a lot of slut-shaming, girl-on-girl hate and most characters just being juvenile and stupid, so I was like:But then I thought, come on Jun, there must be a reason why so many people love this book...
I still loved the book the second time around, although I did drop one star as I'm a bit different now. I always get nervous rereading my old books because I'm afraid I will hate them, BUT, I want to slowly reread everything to see what I'm going to keep. Fighting cancer changed a lot and hoping it doesn't come back has changed a lot of things. Happy Reading! Mel 🖤🐺🐾
This book was totally wicked! I ♥ it!!! :PI hope you can feel my joy for reading this book once you have read it too! It was awesome!I loved how you got totally engrossed in it and then it had a total shocker ending! But, I'm not telling you what that is! :P
Vampire Academy is a well-known series, whether becasue the covers are ugly or because of the kickass characters or the movie flop I don't know.
CharactersRoseOh Rose, our kickass female main character.
Rose is a Dhampir, which is basically someone who is half Moroi (vampire) and half human.
LissaLissa is another Moroi, and Rose's absolute best friend.
Lissa is an incredibly complex character, she has never developed a particular skill over one of the elements like Moroi are supposed to.
Rose also explains what each word means, which doesn't leave you confused and struggling to grasp what a "Moroi" is.
I finally decided to bite the bullet and pick this series up. I'll be honest, I did not expect to enjoy this as much as I did! So easy to read and Rose was a spunky, outspoken heroine and I love that Richelle Mead wasn't afraid to make Rose so sexually confident and confident in herself too. It was SO REFRESHING Full review to come (maybe.)
I wish I could talk to Dimitri instead.Rose❁Dear Vampire Diary,ok, let's try this again.
that's probably more of a vampire type thing, thinking about life, deep thoughts, writing it down, all that.
I should talk about more important things like my training and my best friend Lissa and all the plots swirling around her and stupid school cliques and my hectic schedule and what I learned in dimitri today.
who needs a stupid diary when I can just write to the story of my so-called life.
I want to thank you, Vampire Academy by Richelle Mead.
so yeah, you got that right, Vampire Academy.
4 Little run aways stars  ******************Spoilers*********************I don't know what it is about teenage vampire love stories, but I eat them up like chocolate! I devour every angsty teen vampire book series I get my hands on. Vampire diaries, Bloodlines, Vampire Academy, Crave, and of course the one that started it all for me, Twilight!!!!!! Yes I am that mom, the Twimom! And I have no shame! After reading Twilight for like the 9th time and not getting my fill of vampires, (this was years
Rose's best friend is Lissa and her love interest is Dimitri.
The Plot:The book starts with Rose and Lissa being caught and brought back to St. Vladimir's Academy by Dimitri after being on the run for the last two years in the human world.
Dimitri tells Rose that he has feelings for her but they can never be because for one he is older and her teacher and for two if he let himself love her he would protect her and not the princess.
I loved the sister like friendship between Rose and Lissa.
Why did I avoid this book like the plague?
Well, I have a confession: I hate (most) vampire books and I only picked this up because I had the paperback lying around and I was sick of it's unread status mocking me........
Rose was a perfect heroine and I liked how unapologetic she was and her friendship with Lissa.
I just forgot) than Dimitri-Rose, but I still loved both.
The only reason I picked up this book was because I'm trying to read all my unread paperbacks at home, so I've got some others to get through first...
“The greatest and most powerful revolutions often start very quietly, hidden in the shadows. Remember that.” I can’t believe how long it took me to read this book.

Some characters here already have my heart, and this book was so short (at least it felt that way) I wanted more, but then I still have more 5 books to read, so that satisfies me (it better).
I want to know more about this story, so I’m definitely going to read the sequels.I feel like there is so much more too come and I couldn’t be more excited!
DNF @ 100 PagesBuddy Read with Melanie | | Belle | | Bethan | | Emmy | | AlyssaI tried. I really did. But it's so boring and my eyeballs are literally falling out of my sockets. ~~~~~~~~~~I've watched the movie a long time ago and thought it was shitty so I think it's about time I pick the book and see for myself if it's better than the movie!
Buddy-read set for mid December with my fellow castle dreamers,  the delightful Jess  &  the wondrous Kat (Her review is made of WIN!)!! Vampires! Vampires! Vampires! UNPOPULAR OPINION TIME!2.5 StarsSo, as you might have guessed by that star rating Vampire Academy was a miss for me. Not entirely a miss but a miss nonetheless. My Grievances:Girl-on-Girl Hate: I hate this shit so much... and it’s  everywhere  in this novel!! Every time I turned a page I was slapped in the face with it! Mia hat
UNPOPULAR OPINION TIME!2.5 StarsSo, as you might have guessed by that star rating Vampire Academy was a miss for me.
I don’t mind revenge, in fact, I love that shit!, but this was just senseless hate….
(hide spoiler)]TSTL Main Characters: There was really no plot, for me, in this book.
I may read book two for Christian alone.
I loved that he was the one character intelligent enough to put everything I guessed together…..
Thus they fluttered around like idiots while Christian was over in the enlightened square going all "Guys?!

Δυνατή και ευαίσθητη!Όμως, πέρα από την Ρόουζ, η ιστορία είναι μοναδική, καθόλου κουραστική ή βαρετή, ενδιαφέρουσα όσο δεν πάει.
Και γιατί; Γιατί ένιωθα τόοοοσο απελπισμένη που δεν θα ένιωθα ξανά τα συναισθήματα που μου προκάλεσε κάθε βιβλίο της σειράς.
Κάτι έλειπε.Και αποφάσισα να γράψω, γιατί μόνο έτσι θα ένιωθα ακριβώς τα συναισθήματα που αναζητούσα, αφού καμία άλλη ιστορία δεν μου τα πρόσφερε σε αυτόν τον βαθμό.Η Mead με έβαλε σε αυτόν τον κόσμο και με έκανε να αγαπήσω, όχι την ανάγνωση, αλλά τη συγγραφή.
Αν δεν ήταν εκείνη και τα υπέροχα συναισθήματα που μου γέννησε, και με έκανε να τα αναζητήσω ξανά, ίσως ακόμα να έψαχνα τι είναι αυτό που μου αρέσει να κάνω!
