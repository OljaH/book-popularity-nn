Declan Fitzgerald moves from Boston to New Orleans.
But Declan starts to wonder if this is true.
He is having weird dreams, sleepwalking and waking up in rooms he didn't want to be in, seeing visions, hearing voices, feeling strong feelings, knowing things he possibly can't know...I really enjoyed this book.
I liked the settings, New Orleans, the bayou...
Declan was a wonderful hero, caring, thoughtful, handsome.
I liked Declan's friend Remy and his fiancée Effie, and Miss Odette (Lena's grandmother).
This was a good atmospheric read by Nora Roberts.(This book was made into a tv movie.
I couldn’t stop turning the pages to find out the truth as it was gradually revealed to me.Too bad, around 65% of the book, I started to get bored, especially with the confrontations between Lena and her mother.
I don't know what to say… This was stupid!Lena is now the most irritating NR's heroine I’ve ever read.
Sorry Willa, you’re no longer number one.) I hate heroine with love and trust issues.
Lena annoyed the hell out of me to the point that I wish I could throw her away out of this book and never saw her name again.

This book was published back in 2001 but still feels current.
I enjoyed this one a lot and put another book on the back burner as I enjoyed this one more.The story of Lucien and Abigail is relived with Declan and Lena when Declan starts renovating an old house and falls in love with Lena.
The ghosts of Lucien and Abigail and their tragic past haunts Declan as he restores The Manet House.
He falls instantly for Lena, but she holds back.
I wasn't quite into Lena's character.The story does seem to make a quick ending with no epilogue.
It always feels like revisiting old friends...Declan Fitzgerald is drawn to the dilapidated Manet Manor in New Orleans - so much so that he buys the house, uproots his posh life in Boston, and dedicates himself to the restoration of the old home.
Declan soon realizes that, in addition to extensive restoration, he may have to clean out the ghosts who still haunt the Manor.This is one of my favorite NR books.
Declan and Lena are two of my favorite leading characters, partly because they aren't afraid to pick a fight.I'm sure that I will be rereading this one again.
Declan leaves a lucrative job to buy a dilapidated mansion near New Orleans. He doesn't know why he is driven to restore Manet Hall to its former glory, but he follows his instincts. He also follows his instincts when he meets Angelina. He knows she's the one, he just has to convince her.  Meanwhile the two of them are having dreams of people who lived in the mansion years earlier and their tragic deaths.  This is a creepy murder mystery and suspense as only the Great Nora can do. Excellent book with memorable characters.
Loved Midnight Bayou by Nora Roberts. It was so good. I loved that the main characters had past lives and that their was big twist about who they were in those past lives. People who are a fan of romance books have to read this book.
Ahhh Declan, keşke etrafta senden birkaç tane olsaydı. Dünya daha güzel bir yer olurdu 😍😍Mükemmel bir kitap karakteri daha... hayaller ve hayatlar... 😔😰Kitaba puanım 3, Declan’a puanım 10 😃 Değişik, keyifli bir hikayeydi. Özellikle Declan’ın diyalogları❤ben 🙃 Adamın Lena’ya söylediği her cümleyle eriyip suya dönüşüyor insan. Sırf bunun için bile okunur kitap. Yazarın kalemiyle ilk kez tanıştım, farklı konusundan ve mükemmel erkek karakterinden dolayı çok da memnun kaldım.

nora roberts is a god.strong women, dark and handsome men, murder and intrigue, the french quarter and creole superstition, and lots of failed attempts at restraint make for one heck of a guilty pleasure.
The plantation on the bayou felt so quintessentially Louisiana, and Nora did a good job of nailing the spirit of New Orleans and the Cajun accents and the Southern way of life in general.Ghost stories are a common theme in Nora’s work, but this one takes a bit of a different route for her.
Because of that, the construction elements of Nora’s novels always resonate with me, because she does an exceptional job of conveying the blood, sweat, tears, and pride that go into building or rebuilding something with your own hands.As always, the characters were enjoyable and well fleshed out.
Since there are already a hundred reviews waxing poetic about how wonderful it is, I'll just quickly tell you why this wasn't another five-star read for me.- Lena plays games.
For all the talk about how much of a straight-shooter she is, she relies on the head games with Declan a little too often.
Lilibeth, Josephine, or Julian all could have played villain with one or two short scenes and really driven home the need for Declan and Lena to solve their little mystery.
Una cosilla normal, para pasar un rato. Realmente le daría dos estrellas y media.
"I love Nora Roberts.
I find her work fun, refreshing, and just plain exhilarating, and I've read almost everything she has published.
I consider myself a Nora Roberts expert.[return][return]Unfortunately, this is not one of my favorites of hers.
The ghost story isn't quite as vivid and horrifying as her other forays into a fantasy world.
The love story portion between Lena and Declan seems lacking.[return][return]It's not a bad book in and of itself.
It just isn't one of my favorites of hers.
I am just one person, so I would still recommend Midnight Bayou to anyone who likes Nora Roberts."
200 üzerinde roman yazıp, her kitabında özgün ve canlı bir konu bulmayı başaran adeta bir kitap fabrikası...Roman iki ayrı yüzyılda geçiyor.
Baş karakterimiz Declan New Orleans'ta eski bir malikaneye kapılıp orayı satın alıyor, restore etmeye başlıyor.
Bu malikanede bazı hayaller/hatıralar/halisünasyonlar görmeye başlıyor.
Öyle ki Declan'ın bebek odasının kapısına elini attığında hissettiklerini siz de bel kemiğinizde bir ürpertiyle hissedebiliyorsunuz.Ayrıca betimlemeler olağanüstü!
Manet Malikanesi'nin her bir ayrıntısını, vazodaki muhteşem kokulu beyaz zambakları, çarpan kapıları, kendi halindeki bataklığı, şehrin canlı sokaklarını, malikanenin otlar bürümüş bahçesini, nehrin kıyısındaki söğüt ağacını ve nicelerini gözünüzde canlandırmakta hiç zorlanmıyorsunuz.
Este momento foi tão bom como outro qualquer para regressar aos livros da Nora Roberts e, apesar da tal “fórmula”, reconheço na autora alguns méritos e percebo por que é uma das mais bem sucedidas no género em que escreve (ainda que eu continue a preferir, de longe, o que escreve com o pseudónimo J.D. Robb).Mas passando a este livro propriamente dito: O Pântano da Meia-Noite é um livro que se foca no romance entre duas pessoas no contexto de uma casa assombrada.
The film revolves around Harvard-educated lawyer Declan Fitzpatrick, who impulsively gives up his settled life to buy Manet Hall, a newly restored plantation manor near New Orleans, which he has always been drawn to.Local legends claim that the house is haunted, and shortly after Declan moves in he begins hearing voices and seeing things.
Lena was raised on the bayou by her grandmother Odette, and has her own deep connection with the manor.While living in the house, Declan begins to have visions from a century past and details of events that took place in the mansion.
MIDNIGHT BAYOU by Nora RobertsMy Thoughts:This book opens with a scene from the past, which lets you in on the sad history of Manet Hall.
The opening was very powerful and once the book switched to present day I immediately wondered more about what had happened long ago.
The past and present day characters were wonderfully written, making the book a joy to read.
I am all for paranormal/supernatural, I love it, and mixed into a romance novel I figured that would be something new and interesting.
KcLu's review posted on Guilty Pleasures4.75 StarsMidnight Bayou is a wonderful mixture of two stories that connect in a beautiful and at times spooky way.
He keeps having episodes where he sleepwalks to certain parts of the house including the old nursery on the third floor which he can’t bring himself to enter.
On top of that he keeps having dreams of things that happened in the house which he figures out when he sees pictures of the original family.Angelina “Lena” Simone grew up just down the bayou from Manet Hall, and she has a family connection to the dark past of the hall.
Just when it had my full attention it leaps forward to 2002 and loses me a bit.Declan Fitzgerald is 31 and a successful attorney but his heart isn’t in it and he decides to trek across country and purchase a Louisiana mansion with the intent of fixing it up even though he’s no carpenter.
It is soon revealed that Declan had basically left a fiancee at the altar a few months earlier and the thought occurs to me that he’s running away from life which doesn’t exactly win me over.
Lina is independent but soon swoons when Declan is near and begins to help him unravel the secrets of the mansion.
One of my goals for 2013 is to read outside my genre comfort zone, and I could think of no better way to commit to that than by starting off with Nora Roberts. I did ease the shock by picking a novel set in Louisiana (I'm from there), and somebody recommended this one to me after reading  Summer Gothic , so there it is.I've read one or two romance novels before, and the basic problems I have with the genre remain, so let me get them out of the way: 1) Perfect people are not interesting character
, so there it is.I've read one or two romance novels before, and the basic problems I have with the genre remain, so let me get them out of the way: 1) Perfect people are not interesting characters.
3) There can be no tension if there's never any doubt that they're going to live happily ever after from the moment they meet.To be fair, Roberts does allow her heroine to have emotional issues springing from a dysfunctional family situation and her awful mother, but it never seriously gets in the way of the romance because Perfect Man doesn't let it.
Okay, I'm going to admit to personal bias and a specific idiosyncrasy of mine here that has totally played into how I perceived and reacted to this particular Nora Roberts book.
In my experience, I have only ever found dusky used in stories written by authors who are not PoC writing a story set in the south needing to describe a PoC and it's usually used to describe some exotic woman that someone is finding sexually attractive.
Don't get me wrong, I enjoy Roberts writing and still plan on reading through her back list.
Nu stiu de ce ,dar toate cartile scrise de Nora Roberts au ceva special.Se pare ca in ultimul timp ,
This woman just got it!This was my first Nora Roberts but certainly not my last. The beauty of New Orleans and the peace of the Bayou is stuck in my head and one day I will make sure I'd visit this little magic town.The book had me since page one, she captures the mood, the characters, the air and even the conversations and draws you in that makes it so hard to put the book down.Read this book, trust me you'd want it to never end. :)
2017 yılının ilk kitabını Nora abla ile açtığım için çok seviniyorum. Kitap yine güzeldi, değişikti. Ama ilk sayfalardaki olaylar beni biraz kötü etkiledi. Öyle ki bir süre kitabı okuyamadım hatta konu ilerlerken böyle içim titreyerek okudum. Ama çok beğendim. Nora ablacım çok öpüyorum seni. Ve Declan sana kesinlikle aşık olurdum eğer arada sevdiceğim olmasaydı :)
It's always fun to read something written by Nora Roberts. I wanted to read something fun based in New Orleans, and she didn't disappoint.
Ik heb genoten van dit boek, een heel moooi uitgewerkt past - present verhaal met hartverwarmende personages. Mysterieus, romantisch en best wel spannend.
Loved this book. Nora Roberts description of the plantation was so vivid I could picture it clearly. I think this is one of her best books.
-_-' Digamos que he chocado con su personalidad, porque en favor de Declan buscaba algo más dulce, pero parece que este chico se lo ha robado todo.
Pero tiene un ritmo tan ágil y con Declan llevando el peso de la trama en todo, que vale la pena y hace que ames seguir leyendo cada maldita página no-embrujada para saber qué otra cosa se le puede ocurrir a este chico.Con respecto a la casa, la vieja mansión, creo que es un tema que me gusta, es realmente precioso ver como devuelve el esplendor a cada cosa que él hace.
It is up to Declan and Angelina to uncover the past tragedy and put its wanderers to rest, all the while eating great Orleans fare, buying more vintage stuff and renovating the decrepit mansion.Clearly, Roberts loves renovation projects, landscape excavation and buying stuff.
The present day characters are engaging, although Angelina’s protestations of cold feet (as in she can’t commit to love) grow a little wearying.As Nora Roberts renovating-derelict-mansion-haunted-by-mysterious-past narratives go, this is not her finest.
Both of those novels do a better job of reconciling the yearnings of troubled souls with present day adventure seekers.The trouble with Midnight Bayou is that the ghost storyline is not resolved.
Rating: 3.5 starsMidnight Bayou is part ghost story, part Southern gothic, and part romance.
The second chapter jumps forward in time to the present day, with Declan Fitzgerald buying the old New Orleans mansion with plans of restoring it to its former beauty.
To be fair, the romance genre just isn't usually my type of thing, so I was likely less appreciative of this aspect of the story than most readers.
The other thing I didn't like quite so much was the way the paranormal factors tied together towards the end; I found it a bit cheesy.
I would recommend reading this one on a rainy day (or stormy night).
