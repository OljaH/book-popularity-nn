You know.....if there are infinite universes with infinite possibilities, then there exists a version of me that‚Äôs a part of a science girl gang on a pirate expedition to save sea monsters, and one day, I will consume enough caffeine to vibrate my molecules at a frequency that allows me to pass between realities and retreat into that universe. So, what's this book about? Felicity Montague would offer up everything on the altar of sacrifice, so long as she gets to fulfill her dream of studying me
As Sim‚Äôs hidden intentions clamor for air and Johanna‚Äôs guarded secrets spill out, the three women are thrust into a whirlwind of a quest‚Äîas unexpected as it was dangerous‚Äîthat spans all the way to the Northern coast of Africa and leads them to the unseen secrets of the Atlantic.This book healed the worn-down places around my heart and I love it so much that I'm considering the possibility of giving up personhood to become a full-time abstract concept of pure love.Much like the first book, Lady's Guide's careful exploration of class, intersectional privilege, misogyny, colonialism and racism astonishes with its sensitivity and sophistication.
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre referencing, madam,‚Äù the chairman says, his voice raised over mine.‚ÄúI‚Äôm talking about menstruation, sir!‚Äù I shout in return.It‚Äôs like I set the hall on fire, manifested a venomous snake from thin air, also set that snake on fire, and then threw it at the board. The men all erupt into protestations and a fair number of horrified gasps. I swear one of them actually swoons at the mention of womanly bleeding. Lee has done it again! I must confess that I wasn't looking forw
But this hilarious feminist book about the power of friendship may actually have done just that.Felicity Montague wants to be allowed to study medicine and become a physician, but this seems an impossible feat for an 18th-century woman.
Felicity finds herself on a journey - not with the esteemed doctor - but with Johanna and Sim, who is Algerian, Muslim, and quite possibly a swashbuckling pirate.
A woman can be a doctor, a woman can be a wife, a woman can like dresses, a woman can be straight, queer or asexual (as it seems Felicity is) and a woman can be a pirate...
Release date is officially October 2, 2018!
Her dark eyes meet mine and I look between her and Johanna. In the company of women like this‚Äîsharp-edged as raw diamonds but with soft hands and hearts, not strong in spite of anything but powerful because of everything‚ÄîI feel invincible. Every chink and rut and battering wind has made us tough and brave and impossible to strike down. We are made of mountains‚Äîor perhaps temples, with foundations that could outlast time itself.  4 1/2 stars.  This was lovely.  And I want to reread the whole du
all of these new characters have solid arcs and their own personalities and it basically reads like a stand-alone with these two random side characters, not like a direct sequel, which is lovely.]But then there‚Äôs so, so much to like about this book.
The whole arc around Felicity getting over her not like other girls shit with Johanna is so!
It is so refreshing that we get this arc ‚Äì as you start the book, you sort of think you know what you expect from Johanna, especially in a comedy like this.
i love three (3) women
1.)The Gentleman‚Äôs Guide to Vice and Virtue - ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ1.5.)The Gentleman‚Äôs Guide to Getting Lucky - ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖI‚Äôm so ready to see badass Felicity in this book!My book arrives in 2 weeks! Can‚Äôt wait. QUEEN üëë
okay - I had heard some mixed reviews on this but I ended up quite liking it!
The adventure was so engrossing and I loved the presence of DRAGONS.
I also really liked the new characters and Felicity's character growth was good.
I definitely found this super addictive and I kept reaching for it all the time which is great.
AND PERCY AND MONTY ARE SO FCKIN SWEET !!!But there were some things that kind didn't sit right I will go into when I write my full review.
I'm tossing up between a 3 and 4 star but I'll let it sit for now

MY GIRL FELICITY LOOKS SO FIIIIINE IN THIS COVER!*you're doing amazing, sweetie*
this was everything my ace heart wanted it to be and I swear I‚Äôm actually gonna write a review sometime soon‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚ÄîI woke up this morning to an email approving me for this ARC and I had to blink at least ten times before I realized I wasn‚Äôt dreaming ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äîso ready for Felicity to fuck shit up and become a doctor and be the historical aroace icon we deserve!!!!!
It had a lot to live up to with The Gentleman's Guide To Vice And Virtue being like one of my all time favourite books...and ok, sure, it didn't quite live up to it (for reasons I'll mention later) but I still had a marvellous good time reading this.
It also made Felicity seemto be constantly an exclamation point, when in Monty's book she always felt flat and factual...which I loved?!
She's fond of Percy/Monty and open loves them both, but like.
And Felicity/Joanna/Sim are just the best and I want them to have 9389 million adventures together and I love them so much.
It was so good to get back into this series!
I loved  The Gentleman's Guide to Vice and Virtue  (see my review), Mackenzi Lee's first book in this series, and I hadn't realized how much I missed these characters until I began her new book.
Once again, I am so taken by the originality of her ideas, and the way she makes books set in the 18th century feel so modern."It would be so much easier if I did not want to know everything so badly.
If I did not want so badly to be reliant upon no soul but m
(see my review), Mackenzi Lee's first book in this series, and I hadn't realized how much I missed these characters until I began her new book.
Her involvement pulls her from Germany to Switzerland to Algiers and Gibraltar, and what she sees and experiences toughens her resolve, leads her to some important self-discovery, and opens her eyes to some things she never imagined existed."You deserve to be here.
This is one of those books that is easy to love and not easy to forget.I hope there's another book in this series coming along sometime soon!!
I thought it was pretty good. I will probably have to do a re read because it might just be the mood I'm in. üòïHappy Reading! Mel üñ§üê∂üê∫üêæ
This book deserves a star for the authenticity of the story alone!Then there was everything else that I enjoyed.
Then there is the way that Lee uses these characters to discuss many of the complex social issues that plague the Victorian era, and still plague us today.One of my favorite things about The Gentleman's Guide, was how well it integrated prevalent social issues into the character's lives and developmental arcs, as well as into the story in general.
Where The Gentleman's Guide felt more like a wild, accident-filled adventure, this one felt like a borderline plotless tale that was far more serious than I had expected.I absolutely loved the first book.
"Everyone has heard stories of women like us- cautionary tales, morality plays, warnings of what will befall you if you are a girl too wild for the world, a girl who asks too many questions or wants too much. If you set off into the world alone.Everyone has heard stories of women like us, and now we will make more of them."
Update: I was trying to be nice with my original rating (2.5 stars), but no. This is a 2 stars from meüòì2.5 stars*
tbh i would probably sell my right arm for this bookEDIT 2-16-18there's a coVER AND OMG FELICITY IS SO ADORABLE AHHH
It could have been better, I thought: it's not as exciting as the previous book in the series; I would have liked to have seen more female characters; and Felicity is far too lenient towards the Nice Guy baker, and she does become somewhat of a damsel in distress later on in the third act.
COUNT ME IN
COVER REVEAL!!!!THE COVERS!!!!!!!! THEY MATCH!!!!!!!!!!! I'M IN LOVE___WAITPIRATESGIRL PIRATES SPINOFFI LOVED FELICITY WITH ALL MY HEART I CAN'T WAIT TO READ ABOUT HER AGAIN
AAAAND WE HAVE A COVER PEOPLE!!! It‚Äôs super gorgeous!!! Felicity gon‚Äô be badass in this one. That‚Äôs for sureI can‚Äôt wait!!!
Because this book is about Felicity and her struggles of being a woman constricted by the times, she finds herself in.
I enjoyed them coming back at the end and knowing that this whole time they had been trying to find Felicity was lovely.
Her two companions, Johanna and Sim, bring so much to the story because they are total polar opposites but both bloody strong in their own way.
Johanna is intelligent, knows how to use her beauty to her advantage and does everything she can to break away from the men trying to run her life.
Now that she got her own story I could not wait to dive in.Felicity is a character that is after my own heart.
It was unfair that in the age she is living in, women were pretty barred from everything.
The impossibility of it all did get to Felicity but she still did not give up and settle for a life she would never be truly living since it would be devoid of any of her dreams.
It added a awesome element for the story I wish there was more time spent on the pirate aspect of the book but eh that‚Äôs not a huge enough problem to lower my review.Then there is our beloved Percy and Monty.
Correction: it is actually coming out February 2019. *screams into the void*HOLY COVER! üòç I NEED TOMORROW TO BE OCTOBER! üò≠Please let Monty and Percy make an appearance. I AM FLAILING JUST THINKING ABOUT THEM! üò©üòçüòç
Excited for this.
I have been so looking forward to Felicity‚Äôs story!
All my favorite qualities of Felicity are here‚Ä¶ her sass, her independence, her refusal to bend to the whims and expectations of men, despite the damning social norms of the time period.
Felicity fights to practice medicine when no one will let her and takes the world by the nether regions.I will confess that I liked ‚ÄúThe Gentleman‚Äôs Guide‚Ä¶‚Äù a teensy bit more simply because of the delightful humor.
But Felicity has sass and I love that about her, along with some terribly cute puppy scenes, and all the girl power.
*taps mic**nervously shuffles cue cards*ahem ladies and gentlemenfelicity montague is not straightthank you for coming to my ted talk
I‚Äôm ready for Queen Felicity
i enjoyed it but like honestly it was pretty flat full review to come
Having adored The Gentlemen‚Äôs Guide to Vice and Virtue, I wasn‚Äôt sure how this would match up but I loved it just as much (if not slightly more?) It‚Äôs packed with action, friendship and strong, multilayered women.The main aspect of this novel I loved so much was the narrative surrounding Felicity, Johanna and Sim. I adored how different each of them were but how they were all portrayed as equally strong, just in different ways.
All in all, this was an incredibly enjoyable, action packed read, full of witty dialogue and strong, intelligent, multidimensional women and a slobbering dog who has stolen my heart.
