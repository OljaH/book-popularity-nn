I come home at the end of the day and spend my time trying to reconnect with the other person I know I am and want to continue being.
It’s the only fucking reason I can write this review right now- I’ve got the other one far enough at bay that I can only barely hear her screaming about what a fucking waste of time this is and what a terrible writer I am anyway and I should get back to doing something that fucking helps somebody.I reached for Possession after two weeks of working twelve hour days and only one Saturday to restore my Self.

People keep writing reviews of this book and talking about how it was great except for all the boring poems which they skipped through.READ THE POETRY, PEOPLE!
What's the matter with everyone??
I mean what is going on here?
Do people really hate poetry so much that they're skipping a few pages of it in the middle of a story?
I mean, you know there are books out there which are all poetry, right?
What's the matter, do you have a rhyme allergy?
What's going on??I give up.PS the actual book is excellent.(Oct 2009)
Whoever considers their library their most important POSSESSION will know the excitement of adding just a single poem's perfect rhythm to a collection already known "by heart", like a part in our blood circulation, as Byatt points out.Whoever has felt a novel take POSSESSION of heart and mind for hours on end knows that reading is a curse and a blessing at the same time, for it makes one feel angry about being POSSESSED by schedules and everyday life business when all one wants to do is curl up alone and take POSSESSION of the story waiting between two covers.Writers write alone, and readers read alone, Byatt says, but they are alone together.
I never had a real life person who wanted to share my possessive passion for books.
So sharing these fictional characters' possession is as close to a communal literary experience as I will ever get.
I've read and loved a couple of A.S. Byatt's short-story collections, so I knew she had a fine control of language, but Possession is on a different plane, telling the story with a multitude of voices through letters, poems, criticism, biography, and journal entries as well as the prose of the main narrative.
Byatt didn't just write some poems to go in her novel, she created two major Victorian poets from whole cloth, fitted them exactly into a time and a place, and made so bold as to have a character say about one of them, "You can't understand the twentieth century without understanding him." Does that mean we can't understand the twentieth century fully, in a world where there was never a Randolph Henry Ash?
Present.A self-effacing, underpaid assistant researcher in a dark room that smells of stale history survives in reality while his mind thrives with verses penned by the dead Victorian poet, Randolph Henry Ash. Unaware that he possesses a voice of his own he searches for the veiled truths of his life in the legacy of the iconic poet.Past.A petite, pale woman with gleaming eyes, green like emeralds, crystalline like a dragon’s stare, sits in a carriage oblivious of the bearded gentleman sitting opposite her who memorizes the lines of her features with fascinated absorption.
Winner of the Man Booker Prize in 1990.Giving this book 5 stars was not ever in doubt for me.
This is one of the most remarkable books I've ever read.
I'm a romantic, I admit.
I love art and art history.
I love good historical fiction.
But all that combined still does not make a good book.
A.S. Byatt pulls all this together with the most important aspect of any book, great writing.
It's a modern classic, without doubt, and it's worthy of all it's awards and praise.
And these are rife with references, allusions and imagery from Victorian and classical times, both faux and likely real, but I just can't sort it all out and right now, I don't really want to.
This novel is likely, for me, like drinking single-malt scotch in the summer: sometimes I do, but I rarely enjoy it.
In other words, I need to get into a rarified connoisseur's headspace and let the experience wash over me while I noodle away at it like a crossword.I will put this one back on the shelf and maybe try again in January.
But I suspect the failing is more mine than Byatt’s.How Does Byatt Categorise Herself?The quote at the top of this review is true of this novel, as well as the fictional biography it is describing (Cropper’s one of RHA).
But what does Byatt think of herself and her works, I wonder?She wrote in RHA’s letter to LaMotte:“The difference between poets and novelists is this - that the former write for the life of the language - and the latter write for the betterment of the world.”Here, Byatt proves she is both.Thoughts on Possession and LoveAfter writing my review, I turned to those of friends.
I just finished reading A.S. Byatt’s novel, Possession, again for about the fourth time.
This time around I very carefully studied the epigraphs leading off most of the chapters and all of the beautiful poetry included in the text.
This time though, I focused on Byatt’s poetry and discovered just how much it enriched and influenced the novel’s dual plots.
Regarding the epigraphs, I recommend that the reader carefully study each epigraph before reading the chapter; and then upon finishing the chapter, go back and read it again and see if you correctly figured out the true meaning of it.
This was mainly my fault. What went through my mind when I decided to read a book about a love story between two poets when I do not like poetry? Didn’t it cross my mind that there was going to be poetry in this novel? The answer is, not really. I read in the synopsis that there were going to be letters and a literary investigation. It sounded intriguing and it was a Booker winner, among which I found a few gems. After skipping quite a bit I have the following observations: 1. WARNING! Do not at
What went through my mind when I decided to read a book about a love story between two poets when I do not like poetry?
Didn’t it cross my mind that there was going to be poetry in this novel?
I have to admit that I felt quite dumb reading this and I believe the novel is better suited for people that enjoy literary research and books about books.
It was 2* for me but I gave it 3* since I skipped the poetry and some of the letters so my understanding of the novel was impaired.
Creating this story about fictional Victorian poets, including their writings, letters, diaries, etc.
But I did find it slow at times and she tends to digress a lot into descriptions that add very little to the story.
I assume her own writing style was trying to mimic the poets' own writing styles, but I thought it was too wordy.
The last 100 pages or so were definitely the best, and I really enjoyed the ending.
Also this book definitely made me think a lot about poems vs.
poet (i.e. the value of a creator vs.
the value of their creation).
And thanks to slogging through a sample portion of that intimidating & impenetrable fog known as Possession, I've learned an important lesson.
Lend me your ears, gentle reader -- I'm about to whisper another truth that's been missing from your day-to-day literary drudgery.A.S. Byatt is smart.
A.S. Byatt is smart, & she wants everyone to know it.
I suspect Possession isn't a novel so much as an intellectual mercy killing, as she's taken it upon herself to correct the error of our feeble dreams -- i.e., that the common masses have received an education sufficient to understand the higher thinking of Literature.
Basically, "Possession" is a (n outstanding, albeit very old-fashioned) poet's "showcase." I firmly believe that poetry books are not worthy of sharing the same shelf space as works of fiction-- this is a merger of two arts, surely.
The plot and the prose is only a pretext for getting all these snippets of poetry in a book!
Byatt's possession of her characters is the novelty here: she has done something pretty outstanding, mainly giving both fictional historical poets true, clear voices.
A fun ride that wavers between the competitive/collaborative work of two literary contemporary scholars in England and their subjects, fictive Victorian poets who had a secret love affair. The latter slowly comes out through letters, close reading of poems, and other clues pieced together by creative sleuthing. I liked how the story contrasts the cultures of the two eras and its accounting for why literary scholars often become obsessed with the personal lives of their favorite writers in order to "possess" them. �
This list is not supposed to make sense to anyone but me, but I hope you will still be able to draw from it inspiration or motivation to rush to the nearest bookshop or library and get a copy of this magnificent book; those who have read it, instead, will surely understand many, if not all, of these points.
And to all stories, there is always another side, and another side, and another side.The only thing about Possession that I didn't like, or disagreed with, if you will, and therefore the only reason why this isn't a five-star reading for me, is (to do with) the arrangement of the narrative material.
How all the characters still in character, the resolution to both romances at the end, all the touches about criticism - all these ring true.Over the years I have read this book, my favorite character has gone from Maud to Leonora then to both.
Leonora, it seems to me, is so much larger than life, and I have to wonder if the character got away from Byatt, if perhaps, she had been intended to be more of "bad" critic than she is.One of the best and greatest books ever written.
We learn about the relationship of fictional poets Christabel LaMotte and R.H. Ashe through old journal entries, letters, and their "poetry" (the poems were actually created by Byatt, since the two authors never actually existed).
Roland accidentally stumbles upon a letter from Ashe to LaMotte, and this sets off Maud & Roland's journey to the unraveling of the romance between the two historical poets.
Because we read letters and journals and are able to piece together what people's daily lives may have been like, are we able to actually possess their souls, read their minds and know their secrets?
A marvellously layered book and a masterclass in ventriloquism: I don’t think I’ve ever read a book so full of alternative voices, all pulled off so perfectly – from a contemporary 3rd person narrative, to the poetry of two quite different authors, to letters written by three individuals (four if you include a suicide note), and journals penned by two separate women; even a pastiche of academic feminist criticism from the 80s which is hilarious.
Brilliant literary puzzle-book, including a well-realised fictitious author loosely based on Tennyson... one of the best attempts of this kind since Pale Fire. Some people think the book is too clever by half, but what do you expect? Just as constructive to criticise Powell for including too many characters who are upper-class twits, or Proust for not making his sentences short and punchy...
I thought she tied everything up wonderfully well at the end--especially the very last section, which laid to rest the anguished heartburnings I felt on behalf of Ash.I have to think that she was satirizing the world of literary criticism and academic focus on authors.
The title of the book was examined in a myriad of ways in the book: by the scholars, by the relationship between the poet and poetess, by the relationship between Roland and Maud, and a variety of others.I did enjoy this book, but think I may enjoy it a bit more on a second reading.
She is an intelligent and multi-talented author, and I was delighted to accompany her through the throes of Randolph Ash and Christabel LaMotte's love story to the last riveting moment.I have pushed this book to the back of the shelf for years, simply because I saw the movie first (a practice I try very hard to avoid) and felt I might not be so captivated knowing the basic story already.
This book is a double story: it is the story of Randolph Ash and Christabel LaMotte, two 19th century poets who defy their circumstances and the times to have an affair of the heart, the mind and the body.
I picked up this book because I had seen it in a recommended reading site and then a friend said that it was really good.
By, page 300 I felt like I was trapped.
I had already  invested  this much time into it and felt, at that point, that I had to finish it.
I'm sure it won awards and I'm sure that the writing is considered fair, but when I pick up a book called 'Possession - A Romance', I don't know...
There were times that I thought 'Yes, here we go'.
I have no doubt that this book is beloved by many, just not me.
LaMotte has very fine light blonde hair (described as containing multiple shades of blonde) and fair skin.After writing each other a series of remarkable letters, which seem to be very much in the style of the time, (view spoiler)[(with only the coyest and most covert allusions to anything sexual), LaMotte and Randolph Ash have a brief affair, which wreaks havoc on almost everyone around them (particularly in LaMotte's case).Ellen Ash figures out what happened but keeps it to herself until her dying husband tells her about it many years later.
O reconhecimento da qualidade do seu labor, pela academia, veio posteriormente à publicação de “Possessão” na forma de mais de uma dezena de Doutoramentos Honorários.Romance mistérioA história acerca-se de dois investigadores em literatura, Roland Mitchell e Maud Bailey, cada um especialista no estudo do seu poeta vitoriano — Randolph Henry Ash e Christabel LaMotte — que por meio da investigação de diferentes documentos vão descobrir algo completamente novo.
It requires a good deal of attention and focus on the part of the reader during its first half.
As a good number of these characters living more than a century apart start telling their stories---three, four, five, and more writing styles in both prose and poetry began to multiply.
But the reader is rewarded with a complex interplay between breathing and dreaming people a century and a half apart.
So, complex puzzles, beautiful prose and poetic styles, lovely romances, intelligent and important enigmas, magical journeys, and much more.

We are made to believe that just like Dante had Beatrice, Petrarch had Laura, Shakespeare had a Dark Lady, there is a hidden love story behind the biography of every great personality waiting to be discovered and Christabel is more than a character: she is rather a prototype, a symbol that art needs muses to feed inspiration of male artists."I have dreamed nightly of your face and walked the streets of my daily lives with the rhythms of your writing singing in my silent brain.
DNF at page 229.I tried listening to the audiobook for this in July, but to no avail as my concentration skills are poor.
Still, the story seemed quite interesting so I decided to get the book.
I was so excited that I ordered it twice by mistake!
I wish I'd loved this book, but the writing is far too lacy for me.
I've noticed that beautiful writing tends to be the author compensating for a lack of plot.
I wish there had been less poetry and Victorian dialogue.
Such a shame though as I thought I'd love this.
