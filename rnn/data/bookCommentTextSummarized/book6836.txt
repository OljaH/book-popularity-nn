but steinbeck's strength, for me, has always been his characters, and this is one prolonged character study of people in transition - hoping to move on, but unlikely to ever change their ways or make any staggering improvements in their lives.
having read this myself in high school, living out my own small-town blues experience (although hopefully more lovable than some of these people), steinbeck was a discovery for me about the spirit of america.
nobody does it better, or in a way that encapsulates more of the emotional landscape of this country than steinbeck does.
he describes these characters inside and out, you know what they look like and how they will react in a given situation.
he beautifully describes these characters' surroundings, natural or man-made, the history of a particular setting, what it looks and smells and feels like, the resonance of a place.
he makes me understand these characters enough to make this reader's skin crawl at the thought of them.Dusty is in the military.
sometimes i look at things like The Wayward Bus and am reminded that i may have smarts but i don't think i have a lot of depth.
Unfolding over a twenty-four hour period, it's a measured but acute study of characters trying to get away from themselves.The story begins at a crossroads forty-two miles south of San Ysidro, California where Steinbeck's history and imagination are shaken up in ways that could not be anything other than delightful to the reader.Rebel Corners got its name in 1862.
She recognizes Mr. Pritchard from one the stag parties she worked and uses Norma in an attempt to keep him and the other male passengers from trying to get her alone.Steinbeck puts these characters in motion on the highway to San Juan de la Cruz, where a cloudburst above Pine Canyon has raised the San Ysidro River up to a foot an hour.
The players are of a type, but they don't wear well now, oddly more dated than Dickens.Maybe like Vonnegut, you have to read Steinbeck at a certain age of life._____ _____ _____ _____I'll retell the Pancho Villa story:"He used to tell one about Pancho Villa.
He said a poor woman came to Villa and said 'You have shot my husband and now I and the little ones will starve.' Well, Villa had plenty of money then.
He turned to his treasurer and said, 'Roll out five kilos of twenty-peso bills for this poor woman.' He wasn't even counting it, he had so much.
"I hit him because he said you were a tramp."Camille looked quickly away.
Even his less “important” novels like Cannery Row and its sequel Sweet Thursday, as well as his nonfiction book, Travels with Charley, where he goes on an RV tour of America with his poodle Charley, are superb.He’s written some stinkers too though.
Set in post-war America, a bus breaks down in a rural Californian pitstop so the passengers hunker down in the cafe for the night.
Why… Steinbeck’s writing is still good - as always I could very clearly see everything he described and the characters are well-written - but I wish the novel had a point!
این رمان در 1947 منتشر شده است . اشتاین بک این رمان را به گوین اختصاص داده است . احتمالا اشاره به همسر دوم خود گویندولین کانگر است . ( آنها کمتر از یکسال بعد از اینکه اتوبوس سرگردان منتشر شد طلاق گرفتند ) .
I should put all Steinbeck under poetry.One of the unfortunate victims of teaching (and especially student teaching) are the books we seek to read outside of scouring the curriculum day-in and day-out.
I started this sorry soul about two months ago, and even though my heart swelled each time I picked it up, I was lucky to get a page in between finishing lesson planning at night and passing out as soon as my head hit the pillow.
Can I get an AMEN?And up until about where I picked it up last night--about 60 pages from the end--I liked it a whole lot.
The characters, individuals representing (up to a point) certain stock types, form a disaparate group which sets out on a bus journey.
The point of the work is not so much the plot - because not a lot happens - but more the characters' internal conflicts and Steinbeck's critique of post WWII American society.
That they go on a journey together led by a character with the initials JC deepens the allegory, even if the behaviour of some of the characters (Juan Chicoy included) doesn't lend itself to easy interpretation in an Everyman context.
Reading Steinbeck is like reading a perfect character study.
The talent here is that it's a character study of 10 different characters in a novel of only 260 pages.
I came across a lot of reviews that say nothing much happens in the novel, if plot is what is being referred to, then that's true; but to claim such an overarching generalisation is ridiculous because every line of dialogue, every thought and every action is representative of this group of characters' emotional turmoils and social anxieties, their needs and dreams, all bubbling up as they are forced to interact together in an otherwise unusual situation.
Primo approccio con Steinbeck, romanzo corale ricchissimo di descrizioni minuziose: personaggi perfettamente delineati, ambientazioni rese fino al più piccolo dettaglio rendono il microcosmo della corriera una piacevole e divertente lettura.
إيه يا شتاينبيك يا حبي في إيه؟
Много добре, че не беше дадено развитието след пътуването, за да се усети именно този момент на вътрешна обърканост и несигурност.Самата дума и на български (безпътният), и на английски (wayward) усетих като точно отражение на състоянието на героите в този период от живота им.Може романът да няма претенциите да се нарежда до грандиозните „На изток от рая”, „Гроздовете на гнева”, дори и до малката „За мишките и хората”, на моменти да звучи като сбор от психологически портрети, но това според мен е един обективен филм с чудесни кадри от Америка от миналия век без никакво захаросване на образи и съдби.
Uno Steinbenck diverso da "solito", quello presente nella Corriera Stravagante, pronto a toccare temi più "leggeri" rispetto a quelli presenti in altri romanzi. La storia fluisce libera e semplice una pagina dopo l'altra senza mai toccare momenti di intensa emozione ed è forse questo che mi ha portato a malincuore a dare due stelle. La prosa invece è quella tipica dell'autore in cui ritrovarsi ed immergersi fino all'ultima pagina.
Absolutely loved this book!It's been a while since I read anything by John Steinbeck.I had forgotten just how brilliant a writer he was.His descriptions of his characters physically and psychologicallyis just incredible.And his descriptions of nature...just stopped me in my tracks toadmire single sentences!Just great!
John Steinbeck had written the screenplay for Hitchcock's Lifeboat (1944) which was about a bunch of survivors thrown together in a boat after their ship is attacked during the second world war.
Three years later, Steinbeck published The Wayward Bus which had a similar story.
The Wayward Bus is about a bunch of people thrown together - at a cafe and theirjourney together in a bus.
These are the book's main characters who are thrown together.
The men struggle with their intense sexual fantasies involving Camille while barely being able to maintain their public personas.
The Wayward Bus is an entertaining and erotic little novel filled with animalistic characters.
Characters who are so realistic because each one tries to convey their insignificance while unconsciously acting on the knowledge that they are the center of the universe.The Wayward Bus was well on its way to being one of my all-time favorite Steinbeck reads, but toward the end, the book itself modeled the journey: it lost traction and went off the road.
Also, I was personally disappointed that the story never returned to Alice, the only significant character who is not a passenger on the bus.
Whatever the reason, The Wayward Bus is every bit a Steinbeck tale, but parallel to none other.
as steinbeck wrote the first synopsis of the wayward bus in spanish, he had originally chosen el camión vacilador as the book's title.
wayward was the nearest english word that i could find." it is a shame that there exists no english equivalent for "vacilador", as it truly is the most apt word to describe the novel's (as well as the bus') trajectory.it has been noted elsewhere (even somewhat extensively) that the wayward bus is one of steinbeck's lesser or minor works.
with a cast of characters rivaling any of steinbeck's other books, and little plot to speak of, the wayward bus relies on the development of these characters and their interactions with one another.

But the story strikes me more as the common American journey not necessarily from childhood to manhood, like the universal Buldingsroman, but rather the solitary transformation to self-realization from what to who.
Steinbeck impresses with his dynamic grasp of character and in no better fashion than exemplified in The Wayward Bus. His others works provide an academic smorgasbord of analytic sweets but in this book we have a company of characters who seem to serve no purpose other than to mirror the readers very own emotional conditions.Whether Steinbeck intended this or not, I gleaned a sharp sense of relation to these people.
Many people know Steinbeck for the obvious titles like "Of Mice and Men" and "The Grapes of Wrath". However it is in this story that I truly feel in love with this writer. I was instantly drawn to each character, hoping that I could magically be transformed back in time to a broken down bus and it's traveling cargo. I highly recommend this book, especially if you haven't read much Steinbeck. This is the perfect book to get started with.
They exist in Steinbeck's stories for their own right, and they think just the same kinds of things and are motivated by the same kinds of things as the men (by the same token, men are equally as likely as anyone to be emotional, irrational and vain).
If they do unkind, manipulative or even cruel things, it's not a result of their feminine nature (as so many other writers would have us believe, and a thing I don't believe in at all) but probably their circumstances; and the same goes for the men, without making any excuses for either.
In Steinbeck, women and men both are just people, and there doesn't even seem to be such a thing as bad people.
An enjoyable read, but...a non-ending.
(Is that a spoiler?) Steinbeck's great descriptions and characters are here.
The characters are flawed but sympathetic, with the possible exception of one who is perhaps all good, but nothing really comes of that.
There's no real losers or winners, just a bunch of people that go through an experience together that alters them all, at least momentarily.
It is like tossing up a jar of marbles: In the end, some fall back into the jar, some land somewhere else and some teeter on the edge--which way will they fall?
Still, I always want to curl up and disappear in Steinbeck.
Definitely not my favorite of his, but still amazing (of course.)
I'm rarely disappointed by Steinbeck's novels, and this, his next published work after Grapes of Wrath, was no exception.The narrative follows a bus journey through California taken over a single day by a group of passengers including a company director and his wife and daughter, a travelling salesman, a stripper, a cantankerous old man, as well as two employees of the bus driver, Juan Chicoy.
The Wayward Bus is about a dozen very different people who by coincidence end up on the same old bus.
I very much enjoyed this side of Steinbeck, The Wayward Bus might be the most humorous of his works I´ve read so far and definitely the slowest in pacing.
For a while now I´ve picked up one of his novels every month and I plan to continue on that fashion at least until the end of year, perhaps even until I`ve finished all of them.
I have come to the point of realisation that Steinbeck cannot write a bad book.
Everytime his pen touches paper, he makes words dance and conjures up a beautiful tale.This book is different from the others that I have read by him.
In this, the characters are more colourful, the action more intense with elements of suspense, and the story much more character-driven.
The entire story happens over a single day, and the author jumps jumps between the POVs of the various Dramatis personae with ease and creates a seamless chronicle.
The writing is quintessential Steinbeck; the language flows magnanimously, with beautiful imagery and sagacity in portrayal of life of the times.
Прекрасен, прекрасен Стайнбек! Той взима всеки един от героите си, нежно го поставя на дланта си и го разглежда от всички страни под микроскоп, регистрирайки недоловимите вътрешни движения- всяко трепване,всяка мисъл,всяка капчица пот, срам, похот, завист, омраза,честност, любов...Един автобус, един шофьор, шепа пътници, едно заведение в нищото.. Толкова пълнокръвни образи и как майсторски предава невидимите нишки между тях!
Si svolge tutto in uno spicchio geografico, nella Svolta dei Ribelli, punto strategico per i viaggiatori, dove i coniugi Juan e Alice Chicoy gestiscono una locanda con una pompa di benzina e dove Juan offre anche un servizio di trasporto passeggeri tramite corriera appunto.
🚌 Nonostante però fosse "protetta" dall'immacolata Vergine di Guadalupe, la corriera si guasta e i passeggeri sono costretti a soggiornare tutti insieme nella locanda.
👥Steinbeck tesserà i fili di questa commedia mettendoci del suo, sostituendo la serietà e la riflessione delle più imponenti Furore e Uomini e topi, con l'ironia.
قرأتها تحت عنوان (رجال ونساء..وحب) ترجمة ابراهيم اسكندر عن رواية the wayward bus
I was glad that I had read the first few pages of the introduction to this book (a practice I almost universally avoid due to plot spoilers) because John Steinbeck's enthusiasm for this novel, as quoted in the introduction, carried me through the first slow-moving chapters.When the novel finished, I found myself with a hundred questions about what would happen to each character as the bus ride (and book) concluded.
However, it is proof positive to me that the book is the best sort: it pulled me into its universe and made me actually care what was happening.The introduction to the book discussed the allegorical nature of the characters and storyline.
