I love it.Seriously, this is in the  top 5 audiobooks I've ever listened to.Why?First of all, it's read by Eddie Redmayne who played Newt Scamander in the movie.
He read the more recent version (Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them: The Illustrated Edition) so it really felt like "the author" was reading us a copy of his personal book - simply fabulous!
I always love it when the audiobook creator put forth so much effort into a book.

* Cue the inhuman shrieks of joy *As a longtime fan,  I am just reveling   in this latest illustrating the HP books trend. Especially considering J.K.'s original bestiary gave scant descriptions of (some) wholly unknown and many extremely quirky creatures. Literally, over the moon.

Especially considering J.K.'s original bestiary gave scant descriptions of (some) wholly unknown and many extremely quirky creatures.
In the new edition,  Newt Scamander's forward is quick to mention that all proceeds go to comic relief - a truly admirable Muggle charity.
We now have new creatures, including the Hodag, Horned Serpent, Thunderbird, Hidebehind, Wampus Cat and Snallygaster (my favorite), which brings up the total to 81.
Within the new creatures descriptions are references to Ilvermorny (U.S. version of Hogwarts).
Figure 2: The "Grindylow" - a water demon.
This is truly a beautiful book.

As a proper witch (muggle born), I was required to have a copy of this book as Professor Dumbledore declared in the foreword that  “no wizarding household is complete without a copy of this book.”  So I wasted no time and got myself a copy at Flourish and Botts!My very own duplicate of Harry Potter’s copy and I enjoyed it a lot especially Professor Dumbledore’s foreword! You only have to read a part of his foreword to be convinced to read the book. But what I enjoyed even more were Ron’s, Harry’

(Bahaha!)”The 1965 Ban on Experimental Breeding has made the creation of new species illegal.” ---> “but no one’s told Hagrid.”  I’m pretty sure it’s Ron who classified ACROMANTULA with 10 X’s.
It’s informative, creative, smartly written or more accurately, very nerdily written, fun and of course, magical!
<3 Now I’m even more excited for the movie!More importantly, happy early birthday to my wonderful friend, Trixi!
Merlin's beard!!! Important: This is the original reference book, published by JK Rowling and not the 2016's novelization of the movie with the same title. GOTTA CATCH 'EM ALL! This reference book about the magical beasts in the world of Harry Potter is truly fantastic!While I have no doubt that the decision of doing movie adaptations about this reference book is basically to keep "milking" the magic cows of the Harry Potter's saga, now that I finally read the reference book, I have to admit th
It's truly amazing so much imagination and details that she developed here, even more impressive taking in account that many of those creatures never appeared in the saga.Also, you will read about all the politics behind of defining how to control those beasts even on times before of the existence of the Ministry of Magic!
And of course, also, during the course of the ministry, even detailing how complicated and polemic became to classify certain creatures easily seen as beings instead of beasts.Definitely this is a quick but wonderful engaging reading of the magical world of Harry Potter.
I gave the original Fantastic Beasts book 3.5 stars, but this illustrated edition is SO FREAKING GORGEOUS it deserves nothing less than 5 stars. MY GOD.
ما هو كتابك المدرسي المفضل؟ لا تحاول..فلن تجدهل تخيلت يوما ان تشتري كتاب دراسي لمزاجك الخاص؟ (فعلتها مرة واحدة "القانون الجنائي"..
.لأسباب واضحة طبعا )او الوحوش المذهلة كان ثاني و اجمل كتاب دراسي اشتريه و اقرأه.
(3.5?) I really loved the intro but I was disappointed that there was no picture of each beast.Still, it's always nice to go back in that universe!
J.K Rowling is a clever witch.
She conjured up a beautifully imaginative world when she wrote the Harry Potter series, and she only cements it here.
I love the fact that we actually get to read a physical book that appears in her universe, as if we were students at Hogwarts school of Witchcraft and Wizardry.
It’s a great idea and I think only add depth to her story.
It also shows how early on she was thinking about Fantastic Beats (the movie) and reading this adds a little more to that brilliant film.I only wish it’d been a little longer.
How can we say it is A Good Fiction? For me one of the elements that make me fall in love easily into a fiction book is how realistic it can be.ofcourse not the"non-fiction" realistic, but real enough that makes the world very fantasy and at the same time acceptable to imagine it easily.I don't know how to explain but just look at that world J.K.Rowling "AKA:The Queen of United Magic Kingdom" creates..Wizard and Witches lives deep in London, across the UK and even all over the world.They got th
The Book Starts with a introduction to get to know the author of this Mini-Encyclopedia "Newt Scamander" who had traveled the world to collect these precious information about the magical "Fantastic" creatures.Then a description of the "Beast-being" as the Magizoology and the Wizard low says.
and it was a real piece of the "History of Magic" -a book I wish to be made for muggles one day :)- And then the encyclopedia of the Fantastic beasts and creatures starts, with it's origins and legends and how dangerous it is,in a very funny way yet keeping a professional tone of Encyclopedia.

Did you watch the trailer of the movie adaptation of this book and think, like me, that the book is about a bunch of magical creatures escaping into the world and wreaking havoc, threatening the balance between magical and non-magical relations?
"The adventures of writer Newt Scamander in New York's secret community of witches and wizards seventy years before Harry Potter reads his book in school."I swear, that's what I thought I was going to be reading about.
But you can try!Option 4: QUITE  DISGUSTED --Like I was when I found out what love potions were made from.
draco dormiens nunquam titillandus - Never tickle a sleeping dragon.I had always been fond of the books I gift to Archit and I'm glad that this book falls under that "a la carte." I'd had never got to read a physical copy of Fantastic Beasts, had it not been for him who dragged me into these kind of activities.
Holding a copy of Harry's book is a feeling that has got one word- ecstatic.
Looking at the him holding that copy of Fantastic Beasts made my day awesome.
Reading about the Fantastic Beasts was a hell of an experience.
It includes several notes inside it supposedly handwritten by Harry, Ron Weasley, and Hermione Granger, detailing their own experiences with some of the beasts described, and including in-jokes relating to the original series.تاریخ نخستین خوانش: روز هشتم ماه می سال 2002 میلادیعنوان: جانوران شگفت انگیز و زیستگاه آنها ؛ نویسنده: نیوت اسکمندر؛ اقتباس: جی.کی رولینگ؛ با مقدمه: آلبوس دامبلدور؛ مترجم: ویدا اسلامیه؛ تهران، تندیس، 1380؛ در 109 ص؛ شابک: 9645757142؛ چاپ دوم 1380؛ چاپ سوم 1382؛ چاپ چهارم 1384؛ چاپ پنجم 1386؛ موضوع: حیوانات اساطیری - سده 20 مجانوران شگفت‌انگیز و زیستگاه آن‌ها؛ کتابی اثر جی.کی.رولینگ (با نام مستعار نیوت اسکمندر)، نویسنده ی سری داستان‌های هری پاتر؛ و در باره ی موجودات جادویی دنیای خیال انگیز هری پاتر است.
<3I really wish she would publish a spell book
I guess I expected something a little more. I mean, there's a whole movie out there now that I still need to watch, but this, aside from a few humorous anecdotes, is just a short encyclopedia!Not that it didn't have it's moments, of course, particularly how some wizards use ghouls as pets and talking points at parties, or Ron's funny scribbled interjections in the text, but on the whole it was just a what's-what breakdown of the magical creatures seen through the movies.I give it a three for sheer nostalgia. :) I kinda wish I'd gotten the SCREENPLAY now. lol
So so so so schön und extrem bezaubernd illustriert 😍❤
I find it amazing how J.K. Rowling came up with all of these amazing creatures, not only what they look like, but what they do, their classifications, and the amazing introduction about what classifies a beast; as well as doing research to back up her qualities of these creatures.
This was phenomenal, and as I said before about Quidditch Through The Ages, this book deserves all the stars simply because of all the wondrous effort and love that was put into it.
Please read these little extra Harry Potter novellas, since anything to do with the series just adds to the magic.
GUYS IT'S TRUE THERE IS A NEW POTTERVERSE MOVIE ON FANTASTIC BEASTS AND JKR IS SCREENWRITING OH MY ROWLING
Reading this is like being a Hogwarts student yourself. I know I'm too old to get a letter from an owl, but whatevs... I'm still waiting for my Hogwarts letter.
The sad realization that reading Hogwarts Library books is as close to feeling like a Hogwarts student as it will ever get. Blog ¦ Bloglovin’ ¦ Tumblr ¦ Instagram
Well, one thing is for sure. Hogwarts is my dream school. Everything magic-related is my thing. And this book would have been a treat to study (dragons are far more fascinating than bacteria).On the other hand, if I had to learn all this stuff, I'm sure I would have not liked it that much anymore. :D Because having to never worked for me in school. I tended to hate everything that was mandatory.Anyway, this is a fun little read that will take you back to the wizarding world of Harry Potter.
Every time I read about another of the creatures in this book, I told myself, "wow, she really gave lots of thinking for this...
I mean, these are the descriptions for magical beasts!And of course, since this edition is supposed to be a copy of Harry's own book, it's full with things he and Ron Weasley wrote.
Honestly, I'm very grateful for them, because they made the book more bearable, and please, I can't deny they were hilarious.Anyway, now that I've read this I can say, if I were a Hogwarts student, I don't think I'd take Care of Magical Creatures.
I mean, what's better read after reading Prisoner of Azkaban?PS: so far the Art much lower than what I expected 😢.... No offence to the current illustrator, but why not Jim Kay? Who's doing a very good work at Potter series?
For just a few hours, you can pretend to be a Hogwarts student and trust me, it's the best feeling in the world! PS: Dungbombs rule.
Auch hier kann ich wieder nur meinen imaginären Hut vor Rowlings Fantasie ziehen. Sich so viele magische Geschöpfe so bildhaft auszudenken und zu beschreiben, Wahnsinn. Einige kennt man auch schon aus dem Film "Phantastische Tierwesen und wo sie zu finden sind", wie z.B. den Niffler und den Demiguise. Auch der Basilisk, bekannt aus der Kammer des Schreckens wird behandelt. Ich würde mich nach diesen 3 Büchern aus der Hogwarts Bibliothek über noch mehr Veröffentlichungen für Muggel freuen 😉 bspw. etwas über Zaubersprüche oder Zaubertränke vielleicht? 🤔
...to the most amazing new adventure you'll ever experience. You know, apart from that with you know who, what's his name, that Potter guy?
Für alle Harry Potter Fans ein Muss - für alle anderen einfach überflüssig. Es ist eben eine Art Lexikon. Schwer zu bewerten, um ehrlich zu sein.
I loved seeing and hearing about the animals and his passion for them.
He's like a small Hagrid.
I love that.
I know my husband's gonna love this bc he's like a tall, skinnier Hagrid too.
I loved the rating system, so you knew what to expect.
I wanted to read this book, not the scripted, nor see the film- first.
I wanted this to be my first experience with this branch of HP or the Wizarding World.
I love your Lumos foundation.
Thanks for bringing some of that world back, just know I don't think plays are doing so well.
Read this awhile back. No idea why I didn't mark it. Love anything jkr
