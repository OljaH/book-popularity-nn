There he is taken to “the high place” wherein lies the castle of old King Helmas and his magically sleeping court and the boy is vouchsafed a vision of Melior, the King’s daughter and most beautiful woman in creation.
Florian is, however, in all things eminently logical so the price appears more than fair in order to attain his heart’s desire.
In the final definition it would appear that mediocrity and self-delusion are the ultimate laws of human life.To add to Florian’s consternation is the fact that his patron saint, St. Hoprig, also follows Melior back to the present day from his place in the forest of Acaire.

A fascinating book in a peculiar, possibly unique style. Though one of a long “series” it stands perfectly on its own. Entertaining and diverse episodes, written with wit and irony but somehow still serious, build up and up to a philosophical conclusion staggering not so much for its content as for the power of its expression and the earnestness of the author. A comic novel tinged with the melancholy of dreamworlds, seen through the complex lens of modern reflection.
You have to be in the right mood for this book. Definitely funny, in a deadpan ironic witty sort of way. It's hard to identify with the main character though, a rich and entitled man who murders four wives and tries to kill the fifth....
