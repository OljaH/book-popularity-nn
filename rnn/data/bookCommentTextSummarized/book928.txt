surprisingly good read :) these are great stories!
Collection of short fairy tales some were ok
Heck yes it is Anglicized, BUTThere is a really interesting mix here. Ancient myth, medieval and old-time folktales. Flax stories, and the odd standard fairy tale. Mind you it's told in an English forced-to-fit style, but it's enjoyable.
I found this interesting because Grimm's fairy tales, which came from a nearby country, are moral tales more than anything else, while the Dutch tales in this book are more origin stories than just moral ones.
There's a lot of "way back when our ancestors worshipped Wotan..." That was neat.
The stories were collected just after the turn of the twentieth century, from what I can tell; there are references to newfangled radios and submarines.
But the stories are all set in the distant past.
A curious one was about an Oni from Japan making it's way to Holland.
I liked most of the stories.
folklore is so interesting.
