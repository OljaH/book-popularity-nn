Rostovtzeff is maybe the most important history scientist focused in Rome, this book despite its size it is only an entry level book in Roman history.
This is the second time I read this book, The first time I read it I was most interested in war events.
Now I find even more interesting the political evolution of Roman Republic until the Emperors ultimatum power.By reading it you understand how the Hellenic culture was moved and influenced western Europe and the known world at that time.The end of Roman Empire is the mark of the decadency of Ancient world.
I have not read the entire book and I have an old German edition which I picked up by chance the other day in Dusseldorf.
However, I have read enough to award this 4 stars.
Positive is the clarity and in my opinion the nice balance which the writer has achieved between providing too much detail, whereby the reader would become bogged down and too little detail, whereby the reader would not understand what is happening.
The writer also has a lot to say about economics and economic relations, which clarifies many issues.
