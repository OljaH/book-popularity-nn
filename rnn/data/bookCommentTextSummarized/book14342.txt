I don't work in advertising, but I was thinking of a ton of areas where the information would be applicable for myself - from marketing materials to interaction design and even just basic career/work advice.Also, I'm sure it could be said for a lot of books written over the years, but I found that the essentials of his advice and thoughts throughout the book have been echoed and repeated in tons of blog posts and articles I've read for the last few years.
Quite an insightful and utterly engrossing read, even though it would be even more interesting if we could read his opinions about the current state of advertising. I enjoyed his writing a lot, and his main points still hold up well. Sadly, his prediction about giant billboards and deception in political advertisement becoming obsolete was very, very wrong... Любов, благодаря за индиректната препоръка! :D
Тази книга ми е повод за гордост откъм редакция, не само защото е ценна и интересна, а и защото ни я връщаха толкова пъти.
Което оценявам, понеже вече е близо до съвършенство.
Много хора стоят зад тази любопитна и занимателна рекламна библия, радвам се, че и аз съм сред тях.Дейвид Огилви е бащата на едни от най-популярните реклами, които познаваме.
Беше адски интересно да надникна в неговия свят и то от неговата перспектива.
Тук Огилви наистина не се преструва, макар че може би уменията му да рекламира се прилепват и към писането му.
Може би затова е толкова убедителен.
Но страхотна книга, наистина.
Not only does David Ogilvy give great advice from inside the business, but he presents his wonderfully written copy with the best parts of a vintage Life magazine (the pictures).
Ogilvy clearly states the best steps for breaking into the business, the best steps for business owners and how to advertise for various print and TV (however, this book was written in 1983 and lacks the most recent innovation of the internet).Although Ogilvy makes his points clearly, there is a lot of repetition (specifically in the B2B chapter when compared to earlier sections).
If you want to have ANYTHING to do with advertising, you must read this book. If you want to have ANYTHING to do with graphic design, you must have something to do with advertising...

Highly informative and wonderfully written. Its full of personal anecdotes and glossy photos.
Even with the advent of the internet, the core of advertising remains the same because basic human motives remain the same, and what he has to say is still very relevant.While the rest of the book is packed with time-honored strategies and tips, his talent is especially evident in the chapter dedicated to past advertising giants.
This might seem like a fluff chapter to those people just looking to absorb facts, but it is far more valuable – he is showing you how to communicate effectively in words (in much the same way his highlighted advertisements do).
Advertisers have to communicate all of the things that an artist, a writer, or a composer must – character, mood, setting, and yes, even plot.
Огилви описывает базовые принципы и правила рекламы, которые работали в его время. Многие из них работают по сей день и продолжат работать в будущем.Рекомендую к прочтению всем, чье дело так или иначе связано с рекламой. Многое из написанного актуально в своевременном мире интернет-рекламы.
You can read it hundred times.
I thought that they were a whole bunch of immoral people duping everyone in to mass consumption, cashing on the insecurities of the public, and convincing people they needed stuff they didn't.Yet, I liked the way David wrote.
So based on vanity (read: I like how David agrees with me on a few points), and a liking for shiny stuff (read: wow, look at those photographs) I began reading it.What I read changed my opinion on marketing completely.
I would be fascinated to hear his thoughts on advertising today.
At the insistence of his publisher, Ogilvy included a page of short predictions for the future, one of which was the total disappearance of the hated billboard.
How he would loathe the digital boards of today, which are even more intrusive than the simple “same picture for a month” billboards of my youth.
I am the sort that his business would detest: I pay almost no attention to advertising whatsoever.
When I have focused on advertising it has been as a teacher, studying techniques of manipulation with first-year students: how to decode what ads are really doing, saying, and especially suggesting.
It's pretty astonishing how relevant so much of this is in today's hyper-digital age. David Ogilvy was working with magazines, TV commercials and newspaper ads...not the sexiest stuff by today's standards. However, the simplicity in his approach and understanding of human behavior can absolutely be applied to today's digital advertising. GREAT for learning effective and convincing copy writing. It was also just cool to learn about this history of some of the old ad firms.
A classic.
An entertaining read, with Ogilvy's candid takes on the importance of market research, what constitutes as a good/bad ads, international nuances, and some of his mistakes in the journey. Most interestingly, some of the best practices he noted in the book are still relevant today.
It didn’t disappoint; in fact, it was so devoid of bullshit and wankery that I’m now keen to read Ogilvy’s first book, Confessions.David Ogilvy built one of the world’s largest advertising companies.
Nearly all of it, I suggest, holds true: How people read, the value of research, the nature of gaining and holding attention, the value of headlines, the nature of Man. These things don’t change, no matter what technology we are working with.I’ve filled my volume with notes and markings, the better with which to go through it a second time.
Im much more keen on propaganda than advertising nowadays. However, I enjoyed re-reading this book a lot. I had read this years ago for an introductory class on advertising. Its required reading for any publicist since it develops fundamental concepts about the trade that David learned through experience and research.The chapter on Competing with Procter & Gamble and the description of their methods was my favorite. *********************************************The 道 of ethics in advertising.

This approach to advertising parity products does not insult the intelligence of consumers.
The aesthetics of it reminded me of this scene of Pierrot le Fou (1965) Directed by Jean-Luc Godard: https://youtu.be/bZ5c3EY-lyQ*********************************************"Advertising which promises no benefit to the consumer does not sell, yet the majority of campaigns contain no promise whatever.(That is the most important sentence in this book.
Read it again.)"*********************************************I watched several of the author´s interviews while reading this and he kept reminding me of Alan Watt´s lectures: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4jBd...*********************************************
I am not in an advertising business, and read this book out of curiosity. It changed my view on what advertising is. Key ideas: The purpose of advertising is to sell. Advertising can be called “Sales in print”.  The most creative advertisement is not necessarily the most effective one.  The more you know the product the more there is a chance that you will come up with a big idea Advertising can be considered  People don’t buy commodities, they buy images (Jack Daniels – is it really better than

David Ogilvy is a class apart in advertising..“At 60 miles an hour the loudest noise in this new Rol
Using lots of numbers to test folk wisdom.
Here, he shares those numbers with you and explains why people who say otherwise are wrong.
Then he shows you a picture of the castle he owns in Scotland, in case you needed extra proof.This was my second-best marketing book of 2014, after Getting Everything You Can Out of All You've Got: 21 Ways You Can Out-Think, Out-Perform, and Out-Earn the Competition, because the idea density is lower and because there are many digressive stories some people won't enjoy, but Ogilvy is a better writer than Abraham and includes lots of beautiful pictures.
Great insights from the man who quite possibly set a lot of industry standards! While it's a shame that some of his practices, tips or bits of advice no longer apply, most of them can be reinterpreted and used in today's digital advertising age.A refreshing must read for both aspiring advertisers as well as industry veterans who may feel like their creative run's almost up.
wanna know basic knowledge of 'evilish' advertising? this is your bible, written by lord of advertising, spiced-up with outstanding award-winning ads samples. it's a gift from a buddy Dedeng, he got it from Mac909
Refreshing. Good to see a realistic perspective on what creativity is and isn't in the advertising context.
A book by the god of advertising himself. It's at the very top of all marketing books. So useful and so well written. Simply the best.
An older book that is still very relevant!
Considered as a holy book when we were freshmen at college!a lot has changed but still an inspiring one
A great introduction to good copywriting, advertising, and communication in general. Though, I must say, this is the thought that lingers longest: Why do we still have billboards?
Advertising principles elucidated with brilliant examples.
David Ogilvy thought deeply about advertising and produced great results for his clients.
