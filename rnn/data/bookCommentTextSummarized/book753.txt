This collection of essays satisfactorily explains Dewey's pragmatic theories of knowledge, but contains too much dated analysis. What do I care from 19th century idealism - and who the hell is Lotze? Lotze!? *Sigh* - why is it only the crazy ones who write like they expect to be read 100 years later?
The author says in the introduction that this book was the result of a collection of papers written around 1903, but he doesn't bring into his discussion any of the progress in logic, psychology, or science that had been made since the mid 1800s.The title of the book misrepresents the actual subject.
It is merely a long discourse of what Dewey thinks thinking is and how his ideas about thinking differ from those of Lotze.A better title for this book would be "What is thought?" The author creates a torrent of words discussing his ideas of what thought is, how it can be categorized in a couple of different ways, and drawing subtle conclusions about the difference between the way he looks at thought and how the philosopher Lotze, from the mid nineteenth century, thought about thinking.
A good preamble to Logic: The Theory of Inquiry published in 1938.
