Loved the imagery and story! It has adventure, romance, and philosophy.
First off, I am a sucker for travel and exploration books and this book delivered.
I have read the travels of Marco Polo before and gotten side tracked by the lengthy descriptions of the various places.
While I love to be able to imagine the settings that the travelers are in, I can't read three pages on the description of one tree.
This book started quick which I loved and kept moderately paced throughout.
I liked that the author wasn't trying to cram to much into the story, but really focused on some key experiences and built on those.
It made the story much richer to me.
An elderly Irishman tells the story of Marco Polo to his young American nephew. Magical. The descriptions of Venice, the journey across Asia, his courtship of the Khan's daughter and their lives is narrated in a lively manner that makes this fantastic yarn believable.
