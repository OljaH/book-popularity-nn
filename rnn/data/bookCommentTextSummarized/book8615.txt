I believe that Tiuri is truly and actually, altruistic.His epic journey to deliver a message of monumental importance took place many years ago.
Moments before he fled his kingdom, fleet on a stolen horse, with the furious owner following; Tiuri had been locked inside a silent chapel, reflecting upon the duties he would perform as knight to his beloved king; beginning at sunrise.Tiuri’s abrupt departure meant sacrificing what he had worked towards his whole life (all sixteen years of it).
11-year-old-me would have read this book over and over and over.This review was written for Buried Under Books by jv poore.
Great childrens book, read it several times. Tonke Dragt's books are also read by many adults. Wonderful writer!!
Μου άρεσε ιδιαίτερα αυτό το βιβλίο και ο λόγος είναι πως παρότι είναι 616 σελίδες δεν βαρέθηκα ούτε μια στιγμή. Η ιστορία του Τιούρι, ενός αγοριού 16 ετών που το βράδυ της αγρυπνίας του, πριν από το πρωινό που θα χριζόταν οππότης άκουσε μια φωνή βοήθειας είναι απλά εκπληκτική! Αφήνοντας τα πάντα πίσω του, παρότι ουσιαστικά ήξερε τις συνέπειες, γνώρισε τι σημαίνει κίνδυνος αλλά και αληθινή φιλία. Καμιά φορά δεν έχει σημασία ο προορισμός αλλά το ταξίδι. Υπέροχο βιβλίο που το συστήνω σε μικρούς και μεγάλους!
Ach war das süß 😍😍😍Vorneweg Dieses Buch habe ich schon einmal als Kind gelesen und es hat mich begeistert!
Meine Meinung.Obwohl ich jetzt doch ein paar Jahre älter geworden bin, hat mir das Buch noch genauso gut gefallen wie damals!
Ich habe zwar einige Tage gebraucht um das Buch zu lesen, aber es hat mir auch wirklich Spaß gemacht 😊.Der Schreibstil von Tonke Dragt ist toll!
He was disappointed, but then he thought about the journey he had, how he met so many awesome new friends, beautiful sights,and a lot of happiness, he realized that the rainbow is not the most important thing!
This book is crazily awesome, I hope my son or daughter will read it one day and feel the same thing.This book gave me a lot.
As YA goes, this is a 5-star plot.
It was written in 1962, apparently, and the new translation is coming on 25 August of 2015.It's the story of a squire on the eve of becoming a knight who does NOT become a knight because he makes the fateful decision to answer a call for help.
One thing leads to another, and before long, this kid is on a quest with unseen enemies all around him (but with unexpected friends as well).It's sweet, actually.
So old school it will remind you of the type of book about knighthood you could not put down as a kid.
I suspect reluctant readers and fans of all things medieval will love it.
It wasn't one I had previously heard of, although it is a Dutch classic, where it was originally published in 1962.This is quaintly written old fashioned chivalric fantasy which would provide a nice entry to the genre for middle grade and young adult audiences.
It's an older book, and reads that way, but it nevertheless has a simple appeal that keeps it fresh enough for modern readers.My son is not new to fantasy, and he quite enjoyed this.
It was quite an accomplishment for him to tackle a book that comes in at just over 500 pages, but the story moves along at a nice pace that ended up making the length less daunting for him.
Whether it was this idea that the world felt very real from the start or that there was something in Tiuri's character was drew me in as much as Harry did, I don't know but I knew that I couldn't stop thinking about the story when I wasn't reading it.
I think children would enjoy creating either their male of female knight, working on character description but then planning and writing an extended narrative much in the same style as the King Arthur stories.
Art: I really like the idea of using wooden mannequins to try and get the children to play with the human form and consider poses the Tiuri could be in throughout the book.
Diese Bürde wird dem jungen Schildknappen Tiuri aufgeladen und er stürzt sich in ein rasantes Abenteuer voller Gefahren, Täuschungen und Feinden.Dieses Buch ist sooo soooo toll und ist ein richtiges Herzensbuch von mir ❤️ Ich liebe die Geschichte von dem Schildknappen Tiuri und kann mich in dieser Welt immer wieder verlieren, egal ob ich sie lese oder höre.
Die Welt ist sehr gut ausgearbeitet und mithilfe einer Karte im Buch, kann man die Reise von Tiuri genau nachverfolgen.Über das Buch höre ich sehr wenig, dabei ist es für mich immer wieder ein Highlight!!
The writing does absolutely nothing for me, though that's hard to judge from a translation.Had I been faced with an edition that started with a formal introduction to Tonke Dragt (who seems very interesting) and the history of Dutch children's lit, I would have had a better frame of reference for reading and perhaps enjoying the book.
However, given the way this printing was presented, I would advise readers after a children's medieval adventure to pick up more recent MG books like The Ruins of Gorlan or First Test instead.
My father has always faintly disliked reading.
Out of the countless of books that he read to me when I was small, this book and its sequel are by far the most memorable.
I'd also go as far as to claim, that as an aspiring fantasy writer, this book has been one of the many little influences that set me on this path.De brief voor de koning was a glorious experience to me many years ago, and will no doubt offer the same delight to any other child fond of books today.
At first his task seems simple, to deliver a letter of importance to the stranger’s master, the Black Knight with the White shield, which Tiuri thinks he can complete and be back before the ceremony, though there will be some explaining to do.
But there are also dangers aplenty, and traps as many along the way, and Tiuri must avoid falling into these traps or being defeated (or indeed dissuaded) by the dangers if he wants to keep his word to the Knight and complete this task.At a little under 500 pages, this is not a short read but one which was very enjoyable for me.
I received this young adult fantasy eARC from NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.
What was supposed to be a simple task instead becomes a quest to deliver a message to a king in another land.This book is a fairly straightforward and simplistic tale where the young squire is always meeting people at just the right time to help him and nothing bad really ever happens.
Tiuri is supposed to be 16 but comes across as being much younger.
I did finish it but didn't really like it and will not reread it.
. .Thank you Pushkin Children's Books!Check out me other reviews at https://thecaptainsquartersblog.wordp...
Ik kan niet anders dan het volle pond geven. Tikkeltje verouderd, mist hier en daar wat vaart, maar ik kreeg kippenvel en tranen in de ogen toen Tiuri uiteindelijk voor de koning van Unauwen stond om zijn boodschap af te leveren. Zoveel heroïek lijkt niet meer van deze tijd te zijn, maar werkt nog perfect.Leve Ridder Tiuri met het Witte Schild!
Part of that is definitely nostalgia-motivated, and it's not so much that you can tell this is an English translation as that it just reads very formal and literal in English, which I think might be less the case in the Dutch original.
That being said, Tiuri and Lavinia are still OTP (and should really consider making that an OT3 with Piak) and the sequel was always my favourite of the series anyway, so maybe that one will go over better.
altijd een geruststelling om te weten dat je favoriete jeugdboek nog steeds goed is :)
Tiuri hanya perlu mencari Kesatria Hitam Laskar Perisai Putih, dan menyerahkan surat yang dititipkan orang misterius itu padanya.
Sesaat sebelum ia mati, sang kesatria meminta Tiuri untuk menggantikannya, menyerahkan surat yang ada pada Tiuri pada Raja Unauwen.
Surat dibacakan karena dalam perjalanan Tiuri terpaksa menghapal isi surat rahasia itu untuk kemudian dibakar saat Tiuri terjepit dan hampir saja tertangkap oleh musuh.Inti dari cerita buku ini adalah sebuah konflik.
Tiuri harus mati sebelum bisa menghadap Baginda Raja Unauwen.Ada begitu banyak tokoh dalam cerita klasik yang dinobatkan sebagai cerita anak terbaik di Belanda periode 1955-2004 ini.
Book: The Letter for the KingAuthor: Tonke Dragt Rating: 4 Out of 5 StarsI would like to thank the publisher and Netgalley for providing me with this ARC.
Well, I guess it’s not really an ARC since the book was published a long time ago, but this is a new edition.
This is always a big issue for me, because whenever I am being told what is going on, it kind of feels like they are either trying to cut corners or the publisher is making them cut their book down.
Een klassieker die weer in het nieuws is. Tijd om zelf een mening te vormen dus! Geweldig knap om een boek uit 1962 tijdloos te laten zijn. Het genre is niet helemaal mijn ding, maar absoluut een goed boek!
Loved, loved, loved it! Longer review soon!
4.5*
Jeg kunne ønske jeg hadde hatt muligheten til å lese denne som barn, men den er nesten like magisk for voksne. En av de mest engasjerende barnebøkene jeg har lest. Gleder meg til fortsettelsen..
The Letter for the King is the thrilling story of one boy’s battle against evil, set in an enchanted world of chivalry, courage and true friendship.Says the book summary from Pushkin Press.
As soon as I reached the last page, I was Googling to see if there is any way I could procure the sequel, “The Secrets of the Wild Wood.” I couldn’t wait to go on an adventure with Tiuri again.The Letter for the King reinforces classic values like bravery, loyalty, and chivalry throughout Tiuri’s journey.
Full review on my blog,  MyBookishDream The Letter for the King is a book I both enjoyed and didn’t. Some parts of it I found amazing, while others bothered me. I just had a very mixed experience with this book in general. Before reading this book I had heard quite a bit about it. Mostly from my cousin in the Netherlands, as she had to read it for school. I’m very glad to have read this book, even though I didn’t end up enjoying it as much as I thought I would.This story has the feeling of a cla
I’m very glad to have read this book, even though I didn’t end up enjoying it as much as I thought I would.This story has the feeling of a classic adventure story about a brave main character, which is not surprising as the book was first published in 1962.
While the story was fun it wasn’t compelling me to read it, I just couldn’t get into it completely for some reason.I liked Tiuri as a character quite a bit.
(I just didn’t completely click with him.) The friendships in this book were amazing to read about and probably my favourite aspect of the story.Overall The Letter for the King was an alright book in my opinion.
A simple tale of Tiuri, a 16 year old, who goes on a journey to delivery a message of great importance to a King in the land over the mountains. Along the way he is helped by various people, escapes from evil dudes, finds friendship and remains loyal and determined to complete his task. This is a new edition of a Dutch children's classic which remains enjoyable in its simplicity, lack of fantasy and prose that takes the reader into another place and another time.
Wat een boek. Ik zou zelfs krachttermen als 'een heel erg goed boek' in de mond durven nemen. Moest ik het niet net gelezen hebben zou ik het nog eens lezen, zo goed was het. Nu terug grote-mensen boeken gaan lezen voor school, saai hoor.
An amazing children's book. I really enjoyed reading it, though the concept of people being either purely good or evil is not something representing reality, it is a children's book.
With reluctance and in the hope that he’ll be back in time for the ceremony, Tiuri leaves the chapel.When he finds the knight who is the old man’s master, he is close to death.
But in the face of danger he also discovers loyalty and friendship as well as the knowledge that while doing the right thing may not always be easy, it is the only course to take.I first read this book when I was a child in Holland and loved it at the time.
This is the first book I've ever read about knights that didn't include King Arthur, and I absolutely ADORED it.
I've been obsessed with the retellings of the daring quests of the knights of King Arthur's round table, and this captivating adventure takes the crown.On the night before he is to be knighted, Tiuri, our unlikely young hero, is entrusted with the huge task of delivering a very secret and important message to King Unauwen.
He goes through a LOT, and at the end of his journey I was delighted and relieved that he was not burdened, bitter or arrogant from his quest.
Description: The rule-book says that a young man who is to be knighted by King Dagonaut must pass the eve of the grand ceremony in silent vigil.
However, Young Tiuri, son of the famous Tiuri the Valiant, breaks the rules - he opens the door to a stranger, who begs him to deliver a secret letter to the Black Knight with the White Shield.
As he races to deliver the letter to King Unauwen in the Knight's stead, Tiuri is pursued by the Red Riders, who threaten his life - but he is determined to fulfil his promise: the Black Knight must not have died in vain http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-ent...
