while impatiently waiting for more installments of saga to come out, i decided to check out this other brian k.
vaughan book, because i liked the cover, the synopsis promised me plucky girls, 80's references, and this right here is how you get my attention:Suburban drama and supernatural mysteries collide in this smash-hit series about nostalgia, first jobs, and the last days of childhood.all my sweet spots = accounted for.
but apart from her homophobia and the cliché of her, she's pretty rad - willing to step up and throw down for her equally-fierce pack of paper girls against the most unexpected foes.i didn't always understand what was going on, but i'm confident it will all become clearer in future volumes.
Heh, I thought this novel was awesome! I felt like I fell down the rabbit hole on this one 😄It doesn't have a lot of great reviews but it was good enough for me. I loved all of the old school stuff, the graphics, Halloween night, crazy time travelers<--- or were they? Who knows at this point! Look forward to reading more. To be continued.... Mel ❤️
I needed something to take my mind off of the fact that I just finished watching all 9 seasons of The Office and Paper Girls did just that.It’s a compelling storyline with amazing artwork that had me right from the beginning.I was, however, confused a few times because the storyline moved a little too fast.And I wanted more of a backstory to the characters, mainly on Mackenzie “Mac” and her group.
If you're interested in buying Paper Girls, Vol. 1, just click on the image below to go through my link.
So, for those of you who didn't care for this, I can totally see where you're coming from.But.And here's where being a full-on idiot comes in handy: I accidentally read the 2nd volume first, so I knew where everything was headed.Ta-da!Can't nobody tell me being a moron don't have its advantages...Ok, you see the tiny little 1 & 2 underneath the title on those two covers in the image below?
Turns out there was a flashback sequence...it was called Paper Girls: volume 1.What I'm trying to say is that I had a distinct advantage going into this.
Update, 6/19/18: Once again, and maybe for the last time, re-reading for my YA GN and Comics class with a focus on kick-ass girls.
Since it largely takes place at night it is a little darker, of course, but still amazing, award-worthy YA coloring.It's a YA text (though some schools/libraries may have trouble with some of the bad language, but Vaughn doesn't probably necessarily think of comics as something to be read IN school, at least not this one), featuring four Cleveland (Vaughn is from Cleveland) twelve year old Paper Girls (younguns, they actually deliver papers in the wee hours of the morn, as I once did at that age, as most papers were delivered in those days).
As a lover of the "Sci Fi weirdness hits a group of kids" trope (big fan of Super 8 and Stranger Things over here) this was AWESOME!
On top of the interesting storyline, the art was absolutely killer, and the colouring was maybe even my favorite part of the whole thing!
Back to the plot though; I really like how there are still a ton of questions left unanswered, but you're not left completely in the dark after finishing this first volume.
The ending of this volume definitely left me intrigued and I hope I can get my hands on volume 2 soon.
Find all of my reviews at: http://52bookminimum.blogspot.com/Boy, this one had A LOT of stuff going on.
sort of.Our story begins in the wee hours of Halloween when noob Erin is being accosted by local hooligan Freddie Krueger while attempting to complete her paper route.
Luckily for Erin, the other paper girls have already hit the streets and appear just in time to save the day.
Y’all know there’s only room in my heart for one dinosaur story .
I finally had a chance to use it.)There’s also aliens who speak some form of hipsterish Shakespearean throwback/fastforward language that had me all .
Thank you, NetGalley!

While waiting for the next Saga volume to come out I thought to check out another series from Brian K. Vaughan. I enjoyed it but I don't think it is as good as the other. It was weird with different strange creatures and an attractive 80' vibe. I might continue with the series but i am in no rush to do so.
While Paper Girls certainly stands out in the world of comics, with a vibrant spectacle of colours and rich atmosphere, it definitely isn't the best this man's got to offer.Other than lack of a smooth-running plot, this story's fallout lay in its dialogue for me.
Sure, there were two or three interesting turn of events thrown at us and some insanely lush artwork to boot too (big hats off to Cliff Chiang and Matthew Wilson!) But in the end, these girls and this world seem just as flat as paper.Final rating: 2.75 stars.P.S. I'm still trying to figure out what the symbolism with all the apples and eyes is about..._____________________________Book song: Ain't No Rest For The Wicked by Cage The Elephant_____________________________
I loved the sass, the artwork, the clothing and the vibe of the entire book.
I love each girl in the group for their own reasons, and I didn't find myself thinking, "wait, who is this person?" like I usually do in graphic novels.
As far as a feminist graphic novel, I enjoyed this one more than Bitch Planet, which was weighted down with a lot of boring and aimless dialogue whereas I was glued onto every page of this.
A lot of people say that the plot of this is confusing, but compared to the mindfuck that is the Saga series, I actually followed it alright.
It's a little difficult for me not to compare this to Vaughn's other ongoing series Saga, which had me hooked from the very first installment.
This was was very okay.Vol. 1 could've benefitted from being a bit longer, providing a little more depth of plot and characterization.
I was even getting a Stranger Things vibe from it at the beginning.
But alas, there just isn't a lot of substance here.I'll likely try out Vol. 2 before writing the series off to see if it gets its footing, but a disappointing introduction to say the least.
4ish stars.A cool first volume, not at all what I expected, but in a good way.
Weird dinosaurs and time/space travelers, maybe?
I honestly didn't know what was going on like 60% of the time, but strangely it didn't bug me...
The Paper Girls themselves are awfully mature for their what- 12ish years?
I feel like, characteristically, they'll grow and deepen as the series continues.I really like Chiang's art.
I never became confused by the art and for that, I think it's great.
He has a great sense of lighting and I love the color palette.Definitely going to keep going with the series.Posted in Mr. Philip's Library

Cigarette smoking, hockey sticks at the ready and equipped with flashlights, these bad-ass girls mouth off to the rowdiest street suspects, and almost defy the law…U N T I L the discovery of some alien capsule changes their fateful morning and culminates into a clash with zombies, dinosaur birds and other sh..
Between wound eating bugs and other alienware, the girls find themselves in strange surroundings that the capsule may have created and they are thrown into the midst of a whole new timeline.
And it is a cliffhanger, leading to book 2.I liked it.
Enamorado estoy.
Enamorado.Me topé por pura casualidad con las aventuras de este grupo de chicas y tuve que comprar el primer volumen.
Ahora mismo necesito el segundo, ¡es que vaya final!
Si os gustó Stranger Things y os mola el rollo urban fantasy con mucha ciencia ficción es perfecto.No quiero desvelar muchos detalles de la trama porque hay muchos giros y sería spoiler, pero quiero comentar brevemente que las protagonistas son maravillosas y la dinámica de grupo que tienen hace que esta historia sea diferente.
La historia engancha y es una aventura que vives con ellas <3
I didn’t think I could love a comic more than Saga, but Paper Girls proved me wrong. It’s basically Stranger Things with kickass teen girls on bikes and… well, I won’t spoil it but I audibly yelped with joy in the final few pages.–Rachel Weberfrom The Best Books We Read In January 2017: http://bookriot.com/2017/02/01/riot-r...
And look - a flying ball of stuff that makes you relive your entire life!
Vaughan returns to his comfort zone writing a comic about sassy teens spouting clever dialogue and joining him for the ride is Cliff Chiang, fresh from his celebrated run on Wonder Woman with writer Brian Azzarello.
So was Paper Girls any good?
Our four main characters stumble through the book not really knowing what they’re supposed to do, bemused the entire time by everything, just like the reader is!
Cliff Chiang’s art is good – he sure knows how to draw!
"Why is God letting this happen to me?"I loved Paper Girls. Not as fantastic as Saga, way more intruiging than Ex Machina, this graphic novel is a stunning work of art.I can't really believe that our paper girls are 12 years old (they look at least 14, possibly 16), but apart from that I enjoyed the story. Can't wait to see more.Find more of my books on Instagram
I am in two minds about this graphic novel - I really enjoyed the story told and I see great potential for the future of this series, but at the same time the art left me mainly unimpressed.This is the story of four paper girls who are on their early morning route when weird things start happening.
And that last page?
Consider me hooked.I loved the main characters and especially their interaction.
I love the loyalty between those girls, even though they only just met.
I did, however, appreciate the few panels that took up most of a page.
Err...Ugh and stuff?Was this really written by the same guy who created Saga?
Not that I'm a deliriously hysterical Saga fan or anything (yes, that's another series I read wrong), but I kinda sorta expected more from this because of Brian Vaughan's involvement.
Apart from despicably young, meh characters, that is.
And a super meh story.
And a super super meh 80s setting.
And super super super meh dialogues.
And super super super super meh everything.
But hey, it's not ALL bad and meh and stuff!
Yay and stuff!
And stuff.
Those of you who have read that series know that the world-building is complex and the characters are many, and still, it’s easy to follow and make connections.
But Paper Girls is a whole other story.
Vaughan wrote, but I had trouble following the story.Fortunately, the characters also have no idea what is happening, so I didn’t feel alienated by my lack of comprehension of the storyline.
If you’re going to make your story complicated, at least make it so that you know as much as the people in it do.
And that’s what has been done here.I’ll keep on reading.
Eh. After calling it quits on the Saga series (because I realized, several volumes deep, that I simply did not care about it), I thought I'd give a different series from Vaughan a try, because my friends all seem to love his stories so much that I kept feeling like I was missing out on something.
The artwork is super fun and lively, but this volume didn't catch me at all.
I might give the second volume a try, but it's feeling unlikely right now.Content warnings for severe homophobia and homophobic slurs (why is almost nobody talking about this...?)
My favorite series by Vaughan so far is the Marvel Runaways (see Runaways, Vol. 1: Pride and Joy for a good start) series. I like Saga a lot, but it has been uneven for me. I DNF'd Y: The Last Man, Vol. 1: Unmanned series around volume 3. I wasn't sure what to expect with this. I found it mainly meh. It has potential with the aliens and time travel. I like the 80s vibe. I don't know. Just didn't connect with it. None of the characters stood out to me. Probably won't continue.
*3.5 Stars*I am always trying to read graphic novels because that is what my students "read" and by read I mean they love looking at the pictures.
I hope to read the whole series and see what happen to the girls.
I would have rated this book higher but there were times in the graphic novel that I felt it jumped around too much and I couldn't understand what was going on."In the early hours after Halloween of 1988, four 12-year-old newspaper delivery girls uncover the most important story of all time.
I picked this up in a whim at the library today.
I have seen a lot of friends of mine on Instagram reading it so I thought I’d give it a shot.SO MUCH FUN!!My only complaint is that the story is a little bit rushed, I’d like some time to let each girl get their own character development backstory or something just so it’s easier to distinguish between a few of the minor character girls.
I love the story though!
And set in the late 80s and the tough girl and the pop culture references, I was in graphic novel heaven!
I’ll definitely pick up the next ones!!
I was not expecting that.
I didn't know what to expect, but an alien invasion with for girls on their early morning paper route, no, I was surprised in a great way.
It really does have that Stranger Things feel to it too.There are all kinds of mysteries here that were barely scratched the surface of.
I mean we got so few answer.
What in the world is going on.
I need the next issue like now.
There are good characters and there is plenty of craziness.
Great story, great book for people who like mystery fantasy.
Finished 2016 with a graphic novel and started 2017 with one. Loved the art style and especially the colouring of this! It reminded me of a more science fiction-y Stranger Things full of 80s nostalgia. Definitely recommend this!
*3.5 stars*what da heck did i just read?????????
Not as confusing as I expected it to be. Pretty interesting, actually. Now I hope this series won't be so long that it loses my interest after a couple of volumes.
