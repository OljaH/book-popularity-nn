If you read this backwards it totally makes sense!
But as no man is an island, others might have fixed or preconceived ideas on what might be the appointed or appropriate time for certain life events happening to us and how we should be and behave at specific moments in life, even if the desirable behaviour or bringing about such events is beyond our control and we are helpless and unable to change so we fit into the frame of normality or in the plans of our relatives or larger society.
The prose however, on the moments it quits the more outspoken satirical register, flows delicately and lyrically, movingly mellowing nearing the ending while Benjamin reaches the innocent sweetness of infancy, soothing like a lullaby.

“Der seltsame Fall des Benjamin Button“ is a short story, which can be read very quickly because it only has 66 pages. This story is very captivating and emotional. The novel is based on a mixture of weird tragedy and comedy. The destiny of this odd person in combination with Fitzgerald’s writing style and language could fascinate me simply.
Scott Fitzgerald is the short story selection in the group catching up on classics for May 2017.
Fitzgerald, through Button, reveals that age is but a number or perception, and goes against the common societal beliefs of how to treat both older citizens and children.
Knowledge comes with age yet usually the most senior members of society with the most wisdom to share are treated like mere children.
Fitzgerald tackled the question of age nearly one hundred years ago, and, yet, society still does not always appreciate the elderly and children as intelligent individuals.
It was during my lunch hour, so I Googled for a free version online, found it, and read it.Surprisingly, I liked the story a lot better than I was expecting to.
This is a time machine applicable only to anatomy; the person moves forward in time.Fitzgerald has explored all the absurd possibilities of such a wild scenario, including two grandfather-grandson interactions at the same biological age level - Benjamin the "infant" and his seventy year-old grandpa, and the "65-year old" Grandpa Benjamin and his five-year-old grandson.
Along with being generally flimsy prototypes for Dad, Mom, Doctor, Nurse, etc, each one of the figures in the story spoke as if they were awkward, bratty kids acting in a grade school stage play.
Example from when Señor Button the First arrives at the hospital expecting to greet his newborn child (who is actually, as you surely know, a crotchety old man):
In Benjamin Button, however, it is just another example of some of the slovenly writing contained therein.
All in all, Benjamin Button is an interesting story with somewhat poor execution.
Most everyone knows the premise of this story; a man is born old, already smart and wise, and as he "ages" he becomes younger in body and mind.
It makes me think of another saying, "you are who you are", but actually, throughout your life, you are a different person at different times.
You look different, you act different, you think different, you are perceived different during the various stages of your life.
I've read most of what Fitzgerald wrote and I think this is one of his best stories.
It certainly has a different feel to it than the others.
ولكن ماذا لو إنقلب الأمر على نحو معاكس فصارت عجلة الزمن تزحف للوراء والعمر يتأخر بدل أن يتقدم وكل شئ ينحدر من الأعلى نحو الأسفل وتمضي السنوات نحو الماضي في عالم مشابه تماماً لعالمنا، أدركت عند قراءة قصة حياة بينجامين بتن أن الألم قد يكون مضاعفاً على هذا النحو ولا يختلف الأمر إطلاقاً عما يشعر به أيٌ منا في الحالة الطبيعة لتقدم العمر، الحياة نفسها تتسرب من بين أيدينا، فكرة الهلاك والتلاشي أيضاً هي المصير المحتوم مع بينجامين بتن..قد تكون القصة مربكة نوعاً ما ولكنها حقيقة جداً، هي حياة كلٌ منا لو قرأناها بالشكل الصحيح..
Now take a look at this quote: I’m not going to argue with you.
But there’s a right way of doing things and a wrong way.
If you’ve made up your mind to be different from everybody else, I don’t suppose I can stop you, but I really don’t think it’s very considerate.
You think you don’t want to be like anyone else.
But just think how it would be if everyone else looked at things as you do – what would the world be like?
Basically:‘Why can’t you just be like everyone else?’‘I can’t, I was born this way, I can’t change it.’‘Yes you can.
The idea of a person displaced in time is, of course, a staple of SF, but this is Scott Fitzgerald we are talking about here, the author who exemplified the Jazz Age. It is hardly his typical fare.
But that is more of a burlesque, and as in the second two examples, the main character does not himself reverse his age.Fitzgerald thought this was "the funniest story ever written." That is highly debatable.
We all change as we get older, but maybe the message of this story is the popular saying that "You are as young as you feel."
The movie The Curious Case of Benjamin Button has very little in common with the book.
The name is the same, and the core is the same, Benjamin Button is born old and as he grows older he grows younger both in the book and the movie.
And all the rest of the book differs also from the movie.I liked the story, first I couldn’t help at first to compare the story with the movie and feel that the story was lacking everything the movie had, but soon I was sucked into the story and I’m glad it was different since it's more fun reading something that not exactly like the movie.It’s a bittersweet story and in a way, a cruel story since Benjamin during all his life is met with contempt and misunderstanding.
❓Will they embrace you with arms wide open or regard you with vitriolic contempt?
(No, not anything like Parkinson's or Alzheimer's, in case you're wondering) ❓Would you rather die in your crib after having lived a peculiarly curious life of 70 years and be hailed "the oldman who died a baby"?I believed all through my childhood that Brad Pitt was The Benjamin Button.
You can ruminate over all these out-of-the-world, outlandish schemes over your coffee break.
Otherwise, you would have had one of those enlightening, illuminating coffee breaks of a lifetime.
"Life can only be understood backwards; but it must be lived forwards." -Søren KirkegaardThis wonderful short story blurs a lot of lines.
A whimsical odyssey in reverse, a story of falling in and out of love, a rumination on memory, a chronicle of one odd branch of a family tree.
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button truly is all of these things, but first and foremost it is the beautifully sad chronicle of a life lived backwards, of seldom being in the right time, of knowing that the years ahead of you don't hold canes and and greying hair, but swaddles and cribs.
This isn't exactly a great feat seeing as this story is only about 1 hour and 20 minutes, but it was the perfect length for my walk and recent time constraints.This was such a pleasurable read and worthy of the short amount of time needed to complete.
However, as the years pass, Benjamin's body and mind "age" in reverse.
Fitzgerald imbues this story with humor and masterfully examines the concept of aging.
At times the story is sad, especially considering Benjamin's early relationship with his father and his relationship with his own son as he descends into adolescence and childhood.
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is about a man who was born old, and by a reverse process that is unknown converted into being young throughout his years of life.
This short story just tells us about Benjamin's life.
I think the idea of this short story is to show that being elderly, and a newborn is basically the same thing.
Besides the brain function, the elderly and newborns live sort of the same way.
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is a short read about a man living his life backwards in time.
ایدهی واقعا جالبی بود. من فیلمش رو چندین سال پیش دیدم و اصلا نمیدونستم کتاب داره تا اینکه طاقچه آوردش.باید بگم جز استثناهایی که فیلم از کتاب بهتره بود. فیلم واقعا پرداخت قویتر و منسجمتری داره. همین مقداری هم که با شخصیت توی کتاب ارتباط برقرار کردم به لطف پیشزمینهای بود که از فیلمش داشتم وگرنه خیلی دم دستی ارائه شده بود.در مجموع دیدن فیلمش رو توصیه میکنم و با نخوندن کتابش هیچ چیزی رو از دست نمیدین.

For some crazy reason, I had no idea that this was a short story written by F Scott Fitzgerald.
I had seen the movie years ago and never read the book (The horror!
I know...).You can easily read this in one sitting at less than 70 pages.
Most of the book is spent on the first few years of his life, and then quickly works backwards.
I appreciated Fitzgerald's writing and imagination for his one.
Would recommend this short book, especially if you can appreciate a good story.
ليست رواية واحدة إنما كانت الرواية الاساسية هي حالة بنجامين بتن وتوجد قصص أخرىبالنسبة لقصة بنجامين بتن فالفكرة غريبة وتشد ولا شك أن الغرائب هي أفضل عنصر جاذب في الرواياترغم ابداع الكاتب في الفكرة إلا أنني ولأول مرة أجد الفلم المقتبس من الرواية أجمل بكثير من الرواية الفلم الذي مثله براد بيت تم فيه تبديل بعض تفاصيل القصة ومخرجاتها ولكنه حافظ على الفكرة الأساسية لكن التغييرات التي تمت في الفلم لأصل القصة زادتها جمالاأما بالنسبة لباقي القصص فلم تكن بالمستوى المطلوب وهي أقل من عادية
I have never read anything like this before.When you pick up a book and you know that it is more a short-story than a novel, it's obvious you can't expect much from the book.
It will either be a short tale telling you something related to a significant subject and maximum it can do is to give you a heartwarming and a satisfying ending.But this book was something more.
I am really glad I read it and I know this will stay with me for sometime.And I am going to watch the movie very soon and I know I will like it.
Un cuento fácil y rápido de leer. Creo que poca cosa más puedo decir, salvo que está bien.
Έχοντας υπάρξει άτομο που πολλές φορές έχω λογοκριθεί για τις αποφάσεις μου να μια διαφορετική και κόντρα στο κοινό ρεύμα αναλογικά με το πέρασμα του χρόνου και το δικό μου μεγάλωμα όπου οι επιλογές μου ξεχώριζαν από αυτές ομοίων της ηλικίας μου(δες τρελό κλάμπινγκ που λέγαμε και παραπάνω) το βιβλίο αυτό μου δημιούργησε ξανά αυτή την αίσθηση και αυτό τον προβληματισμό σχετικά με το χρόνο και τη διαφορετικότητα και τελικά υποθέτω αν πρέπει να γράψω ένα συμπέρασμα που με εκφράζει είναι ότι τελικά δεν έχουν σημασία τα χρόνια στη ζωή σου που μετράνε αλλά η ζωή που δίνεις στα χρόνια σου.
This short-story focuses on Benjamin Button, who in a 'curious' turn of events, is born an elderly man and ages in reverse.
As the story takes us through his life, we see how age really determines our circumstances.
But the story rambles around, filled with clumsy logistical issues (what happens to Benjamin's mother?
How did she give birth to a 70 year old man without dying??) and characters who drop out of the story without warning.
All of the side characters react to Benjamin's aging in the weirdest ways.
Several characters yell at him and insist his aging is somehow his own fault.
I was surprised by how much I liked this considering my apathy for Gatsby. This was funny, sad, enlightening, and way ahead of its time.
As the people around him start to age, Button regains him youth, he becomes wealthy, and takes a younger wife, but would find her less attractive, he just wants to go out and dance the night away...This was a simplistic story told like a kind of conjuring trick, an exercise in forcing the impossible into the mundane, and reading for the second time felt better than the first, I ended up both amused and sorrowful.
3.5 stars I've watched and enjoyed the brilliant movie adaptation of The Curious Case of Benjamin Button so when I came across the very short audiobook on YouTube, I couldn't resist.
The whole thing is a metaphor for the inevitable march of time and our inescapable fate...ageing and death.
But between the two extremes of frail old age and helpless childhood/infancy, Benjamin lives an incandescent life full of energy, creativity and daring.
And I hope you see things that startle you.
I hope you feel things you never felt before.
I hope you live a life you’re proud of.
The Brad Pitt film is very good but, not as good as the original story. 👍🐯
This is a humorous, quirky story about Benjamin Button who is born as a 70 year old, and ages backwards into infancy.
It made me think about age and identity.
The story also showed the frail condition present in both old age and infancy where people need help from others.As he aged backwards, Benjamin became a peer to his grandfather, his father, his son, and eventually his grandson.
The changing relationships between Benjamin and his other male family members, as well as his wife, are a big part of the story.The movie centered more on the romantic relationship between Benjamin and his wife.
David Fincher gets five stars.
