A wealthy guy called Jack Hardisty had a problem.
At the same time Jack was about to have much bigger problem.
He let a World War II vet (the book was written at exactly this time) stay in his mountain cabin to improve his failing health.
In the best series tradition practically every single member of Hardisty family could qualify for a prime suspect, so Perry Mason to the rescue!
So as it was obvious from my babbling above this one is among the best books of the series so far.
But the plots were always very good.The plot here mostly occurs high in the mountains not too far from LA, one of Gardner's favorite locales.
The story concerns a wounded soldier, home from WWII, his girl friend Adele, her sister, and the sister's husband Jack, who has been embezzling money from his rich father-in-law.
One thing I did not like was that some significant characters were introduced rather late in the story.Eventually found not too far away is a buried alarm clock, which seems to be 25 minutes slow.
This is one of my favorite Mason novels.
Mason is not really in command of things as the complicated story unfolds.

A really good Perry Mason mystery. Includes a complex (for me) discussion of sidereal (star) time. And Perry almost outwits himself. Pretty sure this was made into a TV episode.
Not my favorite Perry Mason so far (I am reading the series in order).
This one is almost entirely all about plot, and the plot did not engage me as fully as I would have wished.Finally, the writing is unusually weak, often awkward, and this Gardner lacks the repartee between Mason and others which makes the earlier books lively reading.
He actually sneers (I mean, who sneers, anyway?) in court half a dozen times, or speaks "sneeringly" (if there is such a word), he smirks and is also described as truculent.The trial phase of this book actually is more than a quarter of its length, which seemed auspicious, but it is the least interesting trial I have read so far in the series.
Mystery - Perry Mason series
However, Mason changes his mind when Della gives him a little bit more information about the case: "A buried clock," she said, "which is running about twenty-five minutes slow.
It's buried somewhere near the cabin where the murder was committed, a small-edition alarm clock in a lacquered box." He called to Della Street as he grabbed his hat.
Let's go!"Mason finds himself with a twisty, confusing case involving an uncooperative client who seems to be hiding something from him, a murder victim whom a lot of people wanted dead, the above-mentioned buried clock, a large sum of stolen money, and an overly ambitious deputy DA who thinks he has a slam dunk case.
The writing style was a little different as Gardner was more descriptive of scenery and locations than previous books.
The story takes place during WWII and the vet is at the cabin to recover from injuries received in combat.
To add to the mystery, a ticking clock is found buried near the cabin.
If you like to solve these murders as you read, you feel a little cheated that you weren't told these clues earlier in the book.
The book is a good read if you like Perry Mason mysteries.
Till the middle of this book, I was wondering if I was reading a 'Group-of-young adults-in-middle-of-murder' kind of pop fiction or a true blue, legal, smart, murder mystery. Even if I say that all that information about 'Sidereal Time', I must say, it was too nagging a diversion. A red herring is fair, but only for some time. This case was practically based on one! Gardner though, has been smart enough, to have thrown some real clues too, which make sense in the end.
This Perry Mason case, though a tough read is still a thrilling novel. The book involves a wounded soldier returning home from war, his girlfriend, her sister and the sister's husband who has been robbing money from his rich father-in-law. The embezzlor is murdered and the evidence directs the charge towards his wife. The father renders Mason's services to save his daughter. To build up to the mystery is the presence of a buried clock at the spot of crime. WOW.
Good readFantastic great super awesome. A good book to read if u like detective stories. Erl e stable is one of thebest
And (of course) Perry Mason and his shrewd secretary Della Street are there to sort things out.This is a peek into American life during the war years.
And the street lights are doused to make cities and towns less attractive targets for air raids.Like most novels written during the war, there's some heavy-handed patriotic propaganda and Gardner puts some speeches suited to a middle-aged writer into the mouths of his young characters.
The D.A.'s office is openly gloating because THIS time Perry Mason doesn't have all of the inside information and THIS time they're going to beat him.
The reason why Mason's story are named like this is that he is not intrigued by the usual cases, he likes to solve the unusual mysteries within the murder cases.
like this time, a buried clock, does it.Vincent Blane's son-in-law, Jack Hardisty, is embezzling money from him.
Also, a buried clock is found buried near the cabin and it's 25 minutes late.
Is there any reason behind this clock and why would anyone bury a clock?
And how does it connect with murder of Jack.All this is eventually solved by Perry Mason, but in between he himself get confused by his own trick.
Perry makes a bad assumption and then has to resort to courtroom heroics to bail himself aout.Perry Mason series - The buried clock was 25 minutes slow...
Mason's explanation of the time difference was that it was keeping sidereal time.
He played it up to create a juristication battle between two counties, but the clock disappeared, the juristication was settled, and Mason's client went on trial for the murder of her embezzling husband.
Mason's only hope was to try and introduce the clock, once again found buried and set on sidereal time.
until Mason realized he'd walked into his own baited trap.
Now that's what a detective/legal-drama should be like - an entertaining but intelligent romp :DI was recently bored with a Grisham, but this ~200 page book delivered more with less than a third of the pages Grisham required and did with more style, wit and entertainment.Perry Mason is called upon to investigate a family murder and defend the wife of the deceased. Amongst the interesting characters (which could've been expanded upon but I digress), the 'Buried Clock' of the title looms but is not completely explained until nearly the end.Very good, and a joy to read!
Excellent mystery. Every clue seem to confuse you more and more; nothing fits. And above all, what the hell is that clock doing there? Why was it buried? Does it have any role in the murder?You can see Mason is walking in his own set trap, and he realises it very late, but when he realises it, he figures out the how it was used in the murder too. Can you?Most recommended! :D
Another winner. This one is written during WWII and one is able to feel life during those years in a different way because the War is not a plot point in the novel but just the reality in which it takes place. As always, humor abound, the plot is tight and the characters compelling. What's not to like?
This was such an exhilarating story. it made you look every which way from the beginning. Not my favourite Perry Mason I've read but certainly an interesting one. my copy feel apart half way through me reading it, so it's all glued and taped up so I could finish reading it. but that's what happens when your copy was published in 1958!
The best part about this particular Perry Mason novel is that Mason himself gets sidetracked, pulled off to the side by one of his own stunts. It all becomes clear at the end, but it was lots of fun getting there.
[3.5 *]Good ole legal mystery, set in the war years. For someone, who is new to Gardner's universe, not a bad start by any stretch of imagination. The denouement part was a bit fanciful, though liked the build-up and the detailing. Looking forward gleefully, to other works of Gardner.
This Perry Mason story was written during the Second World War and normal daily life provides Perry with one of his clues. There are several WW2 tidbits in the book such as Pacific War Time. This is one of Gardner's weaker stories, but due to the historical factors, I am happy I read it.
The first part was kind of boring. The story became exciting when Perry Mason had his entrance. It was a very good story. I was kept hooked until the end. The killer was not the person you thought who was.
ExcellentI am a fan of Perry Mason. This book is one of his best. I recommend this author to any body who is interested in pure detective stories.
I am a rabid Perry Mason fan and this is my favorite mystery of the bunch. The details of the case get a bit complicated, but I love the characters and the story.
Love perry masonThis was not my favorite book, but it was fun. This is quite pulpy. Not a big part for Della. Perry is brilliant.
Lame
My Rating System:* couldn't finish, ** wouldn't recommend, *** would recommend, **** would read again, ***** have read again.
Nakakapuyat! This is one of Perry Mason's cases where I never guessed who the murderer is. Great ending!
A fun, quick read.
Content - Totally baffling most of the way through - I love that. Fast paced and entertaining. Mechanics - Well written event driven novel. Squeaky Clean? - A couple bad words.
