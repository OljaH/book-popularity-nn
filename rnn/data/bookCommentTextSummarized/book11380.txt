If this was written within the last decade, Jonathan would be coping with his outcast status by wearing a black trench coat and rolling 20-sided dice for fun.
He would also achieve a loyal following of other socially awkward birds by totally kicking ass in Guitar Hero.Sadly, this was written in the halcyon days of the 70's, so Jonathan goes on a soul searching quest and learns how to fly better than any other seagull.
I honestly think that there are more photographs of seagulls in this book than there are paragraphs.
Honestly, who wants to be named after a shitty book?
Instead I get Jonathan Livingston.
Ultimately, the very first of his students, Fletcher Lynd Seagull, becomes a teacher in his own right, and Jonathan leaves to teach other flocks.Part One of the book finds young Jonathan Livingston frustrated with the meaningless materialism, conformity, and limitation of the seagull life.
He is then met by two radiant, loving seagulls who explain to him that he has learned much, and that they are there now to teach him more.Jonathan transcends into a society where all the gulls enjoy flying.
Boy was I in for a surprise!What I read was the biggest load of self-indulgent, pseudo-inspirational tripe I've read in my life!Apparently, the moral of the allegorical tale is that being "ordinary" is bad, ignoring practical needs to pursue your passion is good and if others don't understand you it's because you're a misunderstood genius/spiritually superior being.
What's wrong with being a responsible member of society and pursuing spiritual enlightenment on your own dang couch?Perhaps I take a dim view of this book's message because I've known too many people who "follow their dreams" and expect someone else to take care of their "mundane" needs.
Don't read this. Go look at a seagull and think about life on your own if you must. What you come up with will be better than this.
You know, sometimes you should just leave fond childhood memories alone.But I have a hard time resisting any kind of challenge, at least if it relates to reading, so when Karly threw it down (see the thread to this review for her very funny and halfhearted trolling efforts), I felt compelled to go dig out my old copy of Jonathan Livingston Seagull--and it did take some digging--to see if I could justify my then-three-star review.Unfortunately, I can't.This flimsy and fluffy little book was a massive bestseller in 1972 and 1973.
This one belongs to the prestigious & almost elusive group of "Huge Imposters That Became Famous By People Who Suddenly Decided to Read a Novel." The book with its cute aura of a birdshape on its cover, was a mega-hit for no other reason than everyone read it.
Basically, its a huge ripoff of the Judeo-Christian messiah story, with little birds that never fully become characters, grounded (ha-ha) or are even particularly memorable.
Clue number one that this was gonna suck: it's subtitle, "A Story." Not, you know, a novel.
Ultimately this is a fable about the importance of seeking a higher purpose in life, even if your flock, tribe, or neighborhood finds your ambition threatening.
(At one point our beloved gull is even banished from his flock.) By not compromising his higher vision, Jonathan gets the ultimate payoff: transcendence.
Scott Peck's words..."Abandon the urge to simplify everything, to look for formulas and easy answers, and to begin to think multidimensionally, to glory in the mystery and paradoxes of life, not to be dismayed by the multitude of causes and consequences that are inherent in each experience -- to appreciate the fact that life is complex." M.
I longed for a friend, I longed for a sense of the world being more than what was drowning me.
the friend who put this book in my hands also gave me Blind Melon's first album - and together these two items may have literally saved my life.
as that 15 year old gypsy soul, I connected - not the gull - but with the sense that there had to be more to life and that the pursuit of perfection was not in vain.
this book was like a child's story that assured me that my sense of things was not off-base.
چرا دشوارترین کار در جهان این است که پرنده ای را متقاعد کنی،آزاد است؟این کتاب اول از شناخت خویشتن و مطابق آن زندگی کردن و نه بخاطر نان زندگی کردن می گویداغلب مرغان رنج آموختن پرواز را در حدی فراتر از یادگیری ساده ترین حقایق به خود هموار نمی کنندمی اموزند که چگونه از ساحل به سوی غذا پرواز کنند و چگونه بازگردندبرای بسیاری از مرغان تنها خوردن غذا مهم است و پرواز اهمیتی ندارد در ادامه ریچارد باخ یه جورایی میخاد بگه که انسان توانایی انجام هرکاری رو داره،اگه بتواند عدم محدودیتش را باور کندآنچه که دیدگانت به تو می گویند باور نکن.همه ی آنچه که می توانی ببینی محدود است.
I’ve been wanting to go to the library for a long time as I am hoping this way I will buy less books.
Having said that, I thought Jonathan Livingston Seagull to be cute and some of the ideas even touched me.
After a while, Jonathan returns to the flock in order to teach others to fly as he does and follow their dreams.
The story encourages people to find what they love, follow and cultivate their talent and decide for themselves in life.
The book also teaches us to be tolerant, seek the good in other people and love them for those qualities.
When I was a lad, I had to endure my hippie science teacher's self-narrated slide show of the entire book. It beat listening to a lecture about photosynthesis, but not by much.
Puerile platitudes posing as wisdom.
Learning more about birds with the passage of time, I wanted to read the book again.
I liked it much better this time and even wrote a review for my friend to read.
The subject was speed, and in a week’s practice he learned more about speed than the fastest gull alive.” Although Mr Bach is writing all about seagulls and flight, he uses simple English which even a layman reader would be able to understand.
The book teaches us to be kind and loving and tolerant through Jonathan who during a later stage of his life becomes an instructor for seagulls who want to become achievers by being at their innovative best where flying is concerned.
من خلال حكاية نورس واحد يحبُّ الطيران "جديًا" استطاع ريتشارد باخ أن يرينا تاريخ الأديان في دورته ذات المراحل الأربعة.
شيءٌ واحد فاتنا، في هذه الرحلة؛ أن نتعلم منهم الطيران.
وأن القانون الوحيد هو القانون الذي يدفع بك باتجاه حريّتك، وبداهات أخرى نسيناها.يرسم باخ مستويات متعددة للوجود، ومستويات متعددة للفهم.
من خلال النورس جوناثان نرى نظرة البشرية لله، وللأنبياء والقديسين، وللسياق التاريخي الذي تتشكل فيه أي حركة إصلاحية (نسميها دينًا)، وكيفية تشكل فريق من الحواريين/الصحابة المؤمنين بالرسالة، ثم السقوط المؤسف في مرحلة تحريف الرسالة، وتفتيت الحقيقة في طقوس مادية، ونشأة الفقه والكهنوت والمؤسسات الدينية الرسمية.
حتى لو كان ذلك الشخص هو النورس جوناثان بعينه.رواية ذكية جدًا.

This reminds me of Paulo Coelho's The Alchemist (the only one of his I've read). It's self-consciously "beautiful" and spiritual, but doesn't really have much depth. I enjoyed it in my late teens, when I had delusions of profundity, but I don't think it has much to impart to adults.It has 2* for nostalgia. If I read it now, I expect I'd only give it 1*.

I don't even know what to say about this book. One of my favorite books ever. It's very short and extremely easy to read. Great for children, even better for adults. JLS is my hero, pretty much.Our copy of this book no longer resembles a book so much as a stack of papers.
بهشت کامل بودن است"او از چیزهای بسیار ساده حرف می زد.اینکه هرمرغ دریایی حق دارد پرواز کند.اینکه آزادی در فطرت و موجودیت اوست، اینکه هرجیزی مانع این آزادی باشد، بایدکنارگذاشته شود، خواه آیین باشد، یاخرافه، یامحدودیت به هرشکل.کاش میتونستم کمتر از کتاب کپی کنم ولی واقعا نتونستم.این کتاب صفحاتش بسیار کمه، حتا از 100 تایی که نوشته، چون در قطع جیبی هستش، البته من ترجمه زهره زاهدی را خوندم، ولی در هرصورت برای تو اتوبوس مترو و مسیرهای کم عالیه.خیلی باش ارتباط برقرار کردم، چون ترس های زیادی مانع ازخودم بودن میشه.
This book is a response to the flawed and disappointing underbelly of humanity, revealed for author Bach in Vietnam, the Kennedy assassination, the battles for Civil Rights and Feminism, and the Sexual Revolution.
Unfortunately, it is not a work which embraces or explores those changes, but seeks an escape from the difficult questions of the world.Perhaps it should be unsurprising that the author would want to escape the everyday anxieties which mark the changing world.
It is tempting to hope that the whirling eddies of hate, the tumult of inequality, and the maelstroms of fear do not persist beneath it.

I'm a sucker for this book.
Throughout early Christianity, and especially in the second and third centuries, it was commonly believed that Jesus was just a really exceptional guy that God "adopted" and put to use as a redeemer of sins.
Even after the Mark and Q Gospels were written and the circumstances of Jesus's birth were decided, the vote at Nicea was pretty slim that made Jesus the only begotten of the Father.
Well, here's a book that goes back to the roots; any gull with a mind of his own can become the Son of God. I like that moral.
I am so glad, I got to know how other people feel about Jonathan Livingstone Seagull. All these years I was under the impression that some great philosophy and inner meaning had flown past my head, I was one of the very few who had missed it all. Seems I was right, there is no great philosophy. Phew ! I am not a dumb idiot after all.

خیلی رو بود. بعضی جملات جالب بود. ولی داستان خاصی نداشت.من ترجمه "سیده مبینا شاهری" رو خوندم. جالب بود تو مقدمه از خودش تعریف کرده بو. البته ترجمه بد نبود..آنچه را چشم هاست به تو نشان می دهند، باور نکن! تنها چیزی که آن ها نشان می دهند محدودیت است. با آگاهی ات نگاه کن.
یک مرغ دریایی به نام جاناتان برخلاف مرغان دیگر که پرواز را تنها وسیله ای برای زندگی و به دست آوردن غذا می دانند و به حداقل آن چه می توان داشت قانعند، دوست دارد شوق پرواز را تجربه کند؛ شوق رسیدن به کمال نامحدود...
او به یک مرغ دریایی کامل تبدیل می شود و سرانجام آن قدر درخشان و نورانی می شود که دیگر دیده نمی شود..."چه کسی مسئول تر از مرغی است که به مفهوم عالیتر زندگی پی برده و در جست و جوی آن است.
ولی اکنون دلیلی برای زیستن داریم.
Ethan just finished reading this book to the kids, and I had to update my rating from a three to a four.
I guess this book just meant more to me right now than it did when I read it in the past.
And I think the fact that it is one of Ethan's favorite books and he read it with so much adoration kind of helped it to grow on me.
And for the inspiration to do that, I definitely give this short little book four stars.
للوهلة الأولى بعد الانتهاء من الفصل الأول والثاني توارد لذهني مثال الكهف ونظرية أفلاطون عن عالم المثل والمدينة الفاضلة، مع نظرية مادية للزمان والمكان، الطائر الذي أراد أن يرى ما لم يراه الآخرون، عندها سينتقل لمكان مُختلف حيث الجميع متمردين مثلة يريدون رؤية الحقيقة، مدينة فاضلة بمقاييس النورس جوناثان، بعد فترة يعود إليهم ليجعلهم مثله.
من هنا يتضح الجانب الديني من بداية تبشير النورس باقي السرب بتعاليمه، وبعد ذهابه عنهم يضل قومه تعاليمه ويقدسوه ويصبحوا أكثر اهتمامًا بالمعرفة عنه بدل معرفته، ويتركوا تعاليمه الذي أتى بها ويهتموا بمعرفة قصصه.
