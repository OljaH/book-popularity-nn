I bought three of his books, which coincidentally were his first three, all for the reasonable price of 50c, or, about 16c each.The Naked Face was Sheldon's first novel and it is awful.
The first two victims of this killer are a gay guy and a black woman, I think that explains the territory we are in here with Sheldon's fantasy.
She speaks in such heightened ebonics that you wonder if Sheldon ever actually met a black person and at one point she speak my favourite line in the whole novel, "If you don't ball me quick, I'll go out of my cotton-pickin' mind." YIKES.
So I stored them in my bookshelf and from then on, I never tried to open one until I realized my books were getting old and yellowed because of dust and unknown organism living in my room.Sidney Sheldon's first novel was Naked Face published in 1970 and it was nominated by the Mystery Writers of America for the Edgar Allan Poe Award for Best First Novel by an American Author.
Well, as I said it was a good book but when you already read some of his novels, you can predict everything, his style never changed so do the twist in the near end of his books.
I love crime novels! That suspense, the mystery, waiting to know who the killer is... the emotion, they all make me feel like I’m part of the book. This book made me think about Agatha Christie’s books. I miss her crime novels. I think I need to read more books like this one. 👏
Dr. Judd Stevens, M.D., is a minding and effective Manhattan psychoanalyst who must face a terrible prospect; somebody is attempting to execute him.
Stevens is later keep running around an auto, and taking after his recuperation, two men in dim attempt to execute him in his office.
To demonstrate his honesty and find the genuine executioner, Stevens enlists a private examiner by the name of Norman Z.
I liked the personality of private investigator, Mr Norman Moody.
“Life is a very thin thread and it only takes a second to snap it” ― The Naked Face
After reading The Naked Face I know that I will be reading his other books too.The Naked Face starts out with a man happy because he is going to be going home to his wife and letting her know that what happened in the past is over with.
You discover that the person murdered in the first chapter was one of Dr. Stevens patients.The detectives assigned to the case are Angeli and McGreavy.
As Dr. Stevens starts to analyze things in his own life you start to wonder if maybe he is a paranoiac.
After reading some of the famous awe-inspiring novels by great authors, I finally read something breath-taking!This is a mystery novel about a famous psycho-analyst, Dr. Stevens.
He was haplessly suspected of murdering his receptionist Carol Roberts and his patient, John Hanson.
The only way to find out that he is innocent is that he has to gather evidences and by all means, he must find a person who trust him.
At the middle of the story he hired a private investigator, Mr Norman Moody.
I love how the book put a bit of mystery on every page.
The story is good and it differs from many other; the ending is not easy to predict.
His singularly stand alone novel that had some resemblance of being a proper book. Afterward he found his grove, rather his formula and pretty much stick to it till the end. Though I guess his books are endless quick fun reads. But very by the numbers.
Further, regardless of any inability to accept fact, homosexuality is not a disease or a choice - there is nothing to being gay that requires "curing." One character is "cured" of his homosexuality, and his wife is advised of the ways she has failed her husband and thus "caused" his homosexuality.
I can only imagine what gay readers might have thought of this nonsense.
The homosexuality as terrible, terrible thing surfaces again and again in the story, and it was stupid on page one.In light of that, I read the rest of the book saying "thank goodness he grew into good writing like Bloodline and Rage of Angels, because this is garbage." Sheldon was never Tolstoy, but I've usually found him to be quite enjoyable.
So I moved to John Grisham and his legal dramas got tired.
and a favourite was born.After rereading The Naked Face, I have to say this isn't Sidney at his best.
In my opinion, his worst novel was A Stranger In The Mirror followed closely by Doomsday Conspiracy.
Here we have a psycho analyst called Judd caught in strange events.
Sidney is a master at writing endings that make you want to perform his reincarnation.
But in this one I would have loved to know if (view spoiler)[Judd got together with Anna (hide spoiler)].
Sidney will forever be a favourite.
It's a murder mystery with a psycho-analyst protagonist. Freudian psycho-analysis has been largely discredited in the world of psychology, but even if it hadn't been, I'm sure that Sheldon has butchered a number of the concepts behind it. The book is generally trash, with silly one-dimensional characters. It does keep you guessing about who the killer is, but it's not the totally suspenseful thrill-ride that it's cover promises. I think it was Sheldon's first novel. Maybe his others are better. At least this one is relatively short.
ive read quite a number of sheldon books to know his pattern and style and i can say that :1) seeing as this is his first novel, its obvious that his writing style has improved a lot since then2) i can already point out whos the bad guy here. it wasnt even a surprise at all. maybe bcs im too used to his writing style
Quite a thrilling one!!!The way Mr. Anglie turned out to be one of the conspirators, it was quite thrilling and unexpected.Another must read novel by Sidney Sheldon and also quite a magnificent one.
Excellent book.Every page is interesting.Surprising ending.
This is the first time I read a book by Sidney Sheldon and this is a good one. The plot is a little absurd but fast-paced and suspenseful with a good twist ending. Like Ahmad Sharabiani said this book was nominated for the Edgar Award (Best First Novel - 1971. It lost to Lawrence Sanders and his "The Anderson Tapes").
However, although I'm trying not to spoil anything, Sheldon 'cheated' in the sense that I believe that not even the most discerning of readers could guess the identity of the killer.
Again, without trying to spoil anything, it is as if the author wanted to unite Judd and the most beautiful woman on earth (besides my mom, she's watching, I have to) as a fitting happily ever after to this book.
However, I do like to maintain that Sheldon is a great author, but this particular book does not quite suit what I think a novel such as this should be like, (with some allowances) believable.
So it's nice to be back to reading some Sidney Sheldon after so long. But I feel The Naked Face did not really possess all the suspense I have felt when reading the others. However, I still didn't see that last plot twist coming and was very much blindsided at the end of the book!
I'm confused about how I feel about this book. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't good either. Even though the big reveal was acceptable, I couldn't enjoy how the book ended. I was expecting an epic plot twist or some great action, but this book hardly delivered either one of those unlike some of his other works. I have a feeling that Sheldon has a better grasp of the characters of his female protagonists than the male ones.
I must admit that I found it quite offensive reading the words "he was a homosexual" followerd by "he was cured".
We should all know by now that homosexuality is not a disease, hence, it's not something one can cure, so it was quite a bit disappointing to read from the words of my favorite novelist.
But I just took a mental note of it and kept reading, making sure that part wouldn't affect my judgment on the novel as a whole.
So the moment I finished reading the book, I did a little research.
This book was a HUGE disappointment! Everything about it felt old and dated. The plot, characters, setting were so cheesy and stilted. I also took offense to the author's tone and treatment of minorities. Even the mystery was fairly obvious early on. Bleh!!!
Решила перечитать всего Шелдона! Первый проглотила за сутки. очень понравился.
first time read Sidney Sheldon. not bad. lumayan, bakalan -nyoba- baca bukubuku beliau yg lainnya. soalnya yang ini tokohnya ngeselin banget. are you sure you are a psychoanalysis, Judd? because you seems too stupid being that. 😒
not bad for a debutp121: he nodded to his brother, and both men took out revolvers with silencers on them.
I'm not pleased with (view spoiler)[Anthony DeMarco (a capo of La Cosa Nostra, who happens to be megalomaniac (hide spoiler)] who's behind it all maybe because Anne(view spoiler)[De Marco's wife, didn't showed even a slightest sign whatsoever that she is wary about his husband; that he is someone to be worried about (hide spoiler)] Just like his other books, the people you're trying to unlock is always bigger than you thought only this time, though yes it is justified, I didn't like it that much because there's no hints you can go back to.
Dr. Judd Stevens is a psychoanalyst who is facing the most critical case of his life.
John and Carol were both closely associated with Dr. Stevens at one time, and if he doesn't penetrate the mind of a murderer he will either find himself arrested for murder or the killer's next victim.Is one of the doctor's patients responsible?
The Naked Face.I really enjoyed this book!
This was Sidney Sheldon's debut novel and I had never read it before, even though I somehow have acquired a paperback copy of The Naked Face by Sidney Sheldon - in addition to this copy - that was hidden on my bookshelf.
He was an outstanding author and I give The Naked Face an A+!
Dr. Judd Stevens, M.D., is a caring andsuccessful Manhattan psychoanalyst who mustface a horrific prospect; someone is trying tokill him.
First, John Hanson, a patient tryingovercome his homosexuality, is brutallymurdered, perhaps because he was mistakenfor Stevens.
Not long after, Carol Roberts,Stevens' secretary, is also found murdered.The police, partly due to anger with Stevenstestimony in a previous case, are quick totreat Stevens as the prime suspect.
To provehis innocence and track down the real killer,Stevens hires a private investigator by thename of Norman Z.
Before the case isdone, Stevens will have to risk life and limb,psychoanalize possible suspects and fall in lovewith a mysterious patient named AnnieDeMarco.
It is Sidney Sheldon's first novel and his first book I've ever read. I loved it! It was a real page-turner. It was really pleasant to read a good detective story where the investigation took place without internet, mobiles, androids, in general, without high technologies (ok, maybe I'm nostalgic a bit about those times:)). It was between 4 and 5 stars and I gave 4 because I guessed who the culprit was (that actually I was not supposed to).
I had read all the sidney sheldon novels years ago. Somehow a book or two of his slipped by. So i picked them up with the same nail biting enthusiasm and curiosity as i had felt then. But to my horror, i could barely manage to let my fingers turn over to the next page. The Naked Face is an immense disappointment for all sidney sheldon lovers. It just does not manage to enthuse the slightest inquisitiveness for the alleged suspense he tried to built around this hideous plot.
This story seemed to contain numerous, interesting stories within that could have been flushed out to more rewarding conclusions. 6 of 10 stars
Another cliffhanger ... equally nail biting as the rest of his work!!
