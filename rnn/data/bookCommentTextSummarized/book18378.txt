::: FULL REVIEW NOW POSTED :::   “I’m that guy for you, Eva. Every milestone, angel. Every rite of passage… Everything.” He swiped at the tear that leaked out of the corner of my eye. “And you’re that girl for me.”  This was one of my most highly-anticipated books of the year and it delivered everything I'd hoped for and more!! The Crossfire series is one of my all-time favorites. Gideon and Eva’s tumultuous and intensely passionate love story first captured my heart years ago and this final bo
Gideon and Eva’s tumultuous and intensely passionate love story first captured my heart years ago and this final book kept me glued to the page from the moment I started until the very end.
It’s extraordinarily gratifying to read about these two damaged people who love each so deeply and with such intensity working as hard as they can to build a healthy relationship and emerging stronger as a couple in a way that makes you truly believe that their love will last forever and ever and ever.
ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME?! NO NO FUCKING NO, NO MORE GOD DAMN BOOKS, IT WENT FROM 3 "MAYBE 4 BUT I WONT EXTEND BEYOND ITS NATURAL END" TO 5 BOOKS?! WHAT THE HELL?! AND LET ME GUESS, ITS GOING TO TAKE UNTIL 2015 FOR IT TO BE FINISHED. I HAVE NO PATIENCE LEFT FOR THIS SHIT. 3 BOOK DELAYS FOR BOOK 3, NOW 2 MORE BOOKS THAT WILL PROBABLY HAVE SIMILAR ISSUES. TOO MUCH SEX AND NO ACTUAL STORYLINE!
So everyone get off Sylvia's ass and stop calling her "disgusting" for continuing with the series.
At the time there was a lot of antagonism towards Ms. Day for continuing the series, and there still is as I can see by some of the nasty comments that are polluting this feed.
READ IT AND THEN MAKE A NASTY REVIEW IF YOU HATE IT.
BUT DAMN, READ IT FIRST.And comment for those saying "this broken billionaire story is so overused cliche and blah blah blahhhhh" Cool!!!!!
Stop reading books like it then!
Monica, good God the woman deserved more grieving, uncontrollable tears, Eva lending some comfort to Stanton, the man who did everything to protect her and raise her to get all the help she needed emotionally after Nathan.
Then suddenly he's moving to NY to protect Eva on Gideon's payroll...ew!
Then is Gideon's sleeping issue with Eva resolved nope, just assumption that it's getting better.
Deanna Johnson, really after all that ghostwriter nonsense with Corinne's book she's now going to work for Gideon?
⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐!

I mean a MMF book would be smokinggggg!!~LAUGHING AT THE ABSURDITY OF THE SITUATION!!5 NOVELS FOR 1 MESSED-UP COUPLE AND 1 A TOTALLY USED AND ABUSED STORY LINE.You see, elastics too get loose if you over stretch them.
The same way, dragging a used up story line is not going to work any more.
People are bloody going to get fed-up!!I AM FED-UP OF A ABUSED BILLIONAIRE MALE AND HIS DARK PAST.
And even more fed-up of too much sex and no story in a novel.I mean, yes if book 4 and 5 feature new characters it will work, but if they drag it out...
It's interesting reading all of these opinions (some very harsh) about a 4th and 5th book in the Crossfire series. You know what they say about opinions?! They're like &$$holes, everyone has got one and they usually stink! Ha! If you don't like it, then don't buy it. Simple as that.
FULL REVIEW NOW POSTED:   We’d been stronger than before, but now . . . Now, nothing could shake us. We were anchored deep.  There has never been a love story that has piqued my interest and held it so consistently and so unreservedly as the Crossfire series, becoming the gold standard by which I compare all others and forever shaping my expectations of this genre as a whole, so it is with a tearful smile on my face that I bid farewell to two characters I have adored from the moment a feisty bl
There has never been a love story that has piqued my interest and held it so consistently and so unreservedly as the Crossfire series, becoming the gold standard by which I compare all others and forever shaping my expectations of this genre as a whole, so it is with a tearful smile on my face that I bid farewell to two characters I have adored from the moment a feisty blonde caught the eye of a handsome but guarded businessman across a busy New York City sidewalk, and ended up changing both their lives irreversibly.
I loved every second I spent in Gideon and Eva's world, especially during the first THREE books.
There were aspect that I absolutely loved (LUCKY, THE PUPPY), other parts that I really enjoyed, and a few parts that bored me—enough already with Gideon's ex's causing problems.
So, as much as I enjoyed this series, book four and five were completely irrelevant to the overall storyline and seemed to cause more damage than good for a lot of readers, which is a shame!
Gideon and Eva deserved more than the sour taste this series left in the mouth of those readers.
Dragging out the drama and adding a million side stories and histories just made everything seem repetitive and melodramatic, Eva and Gideon's relationship really doesn't progress much beyond the barest superficial stuff, a lot of things just didn't make sense, and it's kind of crazy that after five books the author still chose to leave a number of loose ends.
I'm also docking a half star for the unbelievably controlling decisions Gideon takes after the big climactic scene towards the end of the book in not telling Eva a major, major thing.
Español - English Eva ha logrado muchas cosas importantes en Gideon. Ambos están más seguros en su relación, pero el drama nunca termina.Me gustó mucho el final, pero no con algunos acontecimientos que sucedieron, para mí eran innecesarios y no aportan nada al final de la historia.✨✨✨Eva has accomplished many important things with Gideon. Both are safer in their relationship, but the drama never ends. I really liked the ending, but not with some events that happened, for me they were unnecessary and did not contribute anything to the end of the story.
I have decided to stop reading this series.
It was originally ADVERTISED as a trilogy but after the success of the first 2 books the author became greedy and decided to release a 4th and 5th book.
I am so disgusted and disappointed by this author.
She is clearly taking this opportunity to make a quick buck and thinks nothing of the fans that are responsible for her success.
For now I will no longer read ANY books by this author.
Maybe when I've calmed down that will change but for now all I can say is, "SHAME on YOU, Sylvia Day!"
Everyone complaining about there being 2 more books, carry on.
Everyone accusing Sylvia Day of having evil money making intentions, saying she is taking advantage of her fans by extending the series solely to grow her piles of money, you need to chill.
1. I doubt that's the reasoning behind the 2 extra books.
It's likely her writing plans got away from her.
Like George R.R. Martin, Sylvia Day is not your bitch.
So, everyone moaning about how she is writing these books in order to make a profit.
Complain about the added books.
Complain about things like: 1.
3.5 starsI'm glad it's over, but I'll miss Gideon and Eva, of that I'm sure.
4 stars! When One with You went live, I clicked the audio and started it right away. I feel like I’ve been waiting for this book for the longest and I was so excited to get back into the world of Gideon Cross and his angel, Eva. My overall thoughts- I really enjoyed this book. Honestly, I feel like it had a lot of 5-star potential. There were a few things in the last 20% that irked me personally and had me lowering my rating, but truly I did love this book and this series is a favorite of mine.

Bared to You was one of the first books I read after 50, and in many ways, I’ve loved this series more.
5 'One with Me' Stars My rating is more for the complete series than this one book alone, but ESPECIALLY for the incredible love and devotion Gideon and Eva have for one another. I adored how secure they were of the other's feelings for them, and the complete faith and trust they've shown in their relationship, all throughout the book. And Gideon, OMG, he couldn't be more delicious (no wonder all the OW drama, we all want a piece of him...lol). I loved how we could really see, not only the evol
My rating is more for the complete series than this one book alone, but ESPECIALLY for the incredible love and devotion Gideon and Eva have for one another.
I just felt that ending of such a long and awaited series, it finished with a time frame basically in the present, which translates in having no look into their future (view spoiler)[ it finishs in their honeymoon, so we have only the hint of what Eva will do, but nothing more specific, and no babies...Damn...
Also there were some loose ends here and there...mostly about secondary characters...Perfect ending to a perfect series!(if I had to mention a few things that bothered me a bit in this book - it would only be the too-detailed Brazil travel-guide aka Sylvia Day, and the too many times the word FIEND was used...and...(view spoiler)[ that we don't get an epilogue that goes into the future a few years...but that happens in most books these days...so that's ok.
(hide spoiler)]but pffff - those are just 3 tiny little things!)...and here's a SPOILER pic of something I especially loved about the book!!!
1.5 'real agony' stars “You’ve changed my life, Eva. And you did the impossible: you transformed me. I like who I am now. I never thought that would happen.”  One with You is an unnecessary addition to the series in every single way. However, I was more than okay with Sylvia for adding book 4 and 5 to this series back then because it means there're more books to read and I love to follow the incidents after the wedding that happened in Entwined with You. At first, it's such a real joy. But after
However, I was more than okay with Sylvia for adding book 4 and 5 to this series back then because it means there're more books to read and I love to follow the incidents after the wedding that happened in Entwined with You. At first, it's such a real joy.
It already reached its highest point in book three and four, so this one is kind of a falling action for me.- The sex scenes are so bleak I felt sleepy every time I read it.et cetera.Sorry for the fans of Gideon and Eva. Frankly, I can't make myself love this book even if I want to love it so badly like you.
2.25/5A letdown.This is the worst book of the series.
It was so boring and didn’t have much of a plot.
Nothing new here.
Too many unnecessary conversations.
Too much internal dialogue.
It was pointless to add (view spoiler)[the past and the death of Eva’s mother (hide spoiler)] to the book.
They did nothing but annoy the hell out of me.And what upset me the most was that there was no actual conclusion to the series!
I think I didn’t get the answer, or did I miss something while reading this?
I can’t believe I read five books for no answer!
4.5 starsOne With You is the fifth and final book in the Crossfire series, and frankly I’m surprised I enjoyed it so much.
Let’s just say I was less than pleased with the previous book, Captivated by You. The series seemed to be going downhill fast.
I have a hard time remembering the details of books I read last month, let alone over a year ago.
Eva was annoying as hell in the previous book, behaving like a spoiled teenager prone to temper tantrums.
Otherwise, I think this is a fitting conclusion to the series and there’s nothing else that needs to be added to Eva and Gideon’s story.
I'm torn with how to review this one......Well it's over, sadly it's over and I don't feel like I got the ending I wanted.
I didn't hate it, I question a lot of 'why' did certain things happen, the way this book moved in directions I thought were wrong, but ultimately I got what I was waiting for.
But really that was like 2 books ago.
I was nervous going into this last book.
A lot of time invested in my love for Gideon & Eva. My love grew for them in this book yet I wanted to see so much mor
I'm torn with how to review this one......Well it's over, sadly it's over and I don't feel like I got the ending I wanted.
A lot of time invested in my love for Gideon & Eva. My love grew for them in this book yet I wanted to see so much more for them both.
And I feel so much of their stories are left wide open and unfinished.
With that said, I'm left feeling let down and my story is unfinished.
However I will always love Gideon & Eva!!!❤️❤️ Again I didn't hate this book, I just didn't love it

Long story short: I was expecting MUCH more from this book but it seems the ideas just run out. What is also a big issue for me is that this series reminds me too much of another one I read on a regular basis. What the heck am I talking about? Try reading the In Death series. I know the author admitted to liking it but in reality it seemed more like Crossfire is a fan tribute to J.D. Robb :)
I'm happy I finished this series, and this world, but I couldn't help but want more.
I know this story gets trashed on a lot because of Fifty Shades of Grey, but this was always the superior book series.
The bright side of this book is the sex was great, like always in this series.
12/10, would read again.Unfortunately, the sex was probably the only bright side.
This book was completely unnecessary, and the series would have ended on a much higher note if it stopped with Entwined with You as originally intended.
FIVE books?!? Honestly, now I'm not sure i even want to read the third one....
I so looked forward to this book, only to get majorly disappointed. I loooooove this series so much, and I will cherish all of the previous books in it, EXCEPT this one.This was a mess of a mess!!!!I hope it's not really the final one. If it's not the final one, my rating might change. But for now, it's a big ass ZERO for me.
***2.5 Stars***  Always Mine. Forever Yours.  And so Gideon and Eva's story has come to an end. How do I feel? Exhausted, and kinda unsatisfied. Sadly disappointed.Sylvia Day created two extraordinary characters in Gideon and Eva....and I just wish that she could have found a way to streamline her storytelling. This series, and this book in particular, is entirely too long. SO. MUCH. FILLER.Their story is complex....their love is intense, passionate, all-consuming, and filled with a desperate ye
And so Gideon and Eva's story has come to an end.
FILLER.Their story is complex....their love is intense, passionate, all-consuming, and filled with a desperate yearning for healing and peace.
But holy hell was this series dragged out and padded with so much extra stuff in the last couple of books that 
I read Bared to You when it first came out years ago and immediately fell head over heels in love with Eva and Gideon's story.
The second book only cemented what I already knew....Gideon and Eva were etched into my heart.
***5 "CROSSFIRE" STARS***Wow! What a journey this entire series has been. When I first picked  Bared To You in 2012, I didn't have any expectation and I never thought it would meant so much to me. But from just reading a few chapters, Gideon and Eva have found a special place in my heart and now Sylvia Day gave them the most beautiful, healing, loving, amazing ending. "We’d been stronger than before, but now . . . Now, nothing could shake us. We were anchored deep".  If you’re one of those peopl
But from just reading a few chapters, Gideon and Eva have found a special place in my heart and now Sylvia Day gave them the most beautiful, healing, loving, amazing ending.
Any doubts I had about Gideon and Eva were completely assuaged in One With You. All of the ups and downs that they’ve been through throughout the 4 books made them better.
In this book, Gideon and Eva are stronger than ever.
Gideon and Eva are one of my favorite book couples and I will not be able to let them go for a long time.
I have loved this series, it was the first series I really fell into after reading Fifty.
I know it bothered a lot of readers when it was extended to five books, but truthfully I would continue to read Gideon and Eva’s story indefinitely.
This won’t be a five star favorite for me just because there were a few things I just didn’t understand them being necessary to the story.
Definitely a few things I wish had been different.
Regardless in the end, I love this series and it will always be a favorite of mine.
I get that Ms. Day plans to make books 4 and 5 about Gideon finding peace but sorry 5 books is ridiculous!! Especially when it was originally supposed to be a trilogy!! Ugh.
