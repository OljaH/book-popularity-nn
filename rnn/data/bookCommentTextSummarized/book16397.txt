She portays in an accurate way the English society, and the marriage frenzy that consumed mothers and daughters alike, but she also crafts strong family bonds, and romantic relationships that warm your heart.
The appearance of the Bridgerton family was also a treat, because it meant lots of laughter, and the bond between Mary, Edwina and Kate was an aspect of the story that truly moved me, and made my eyes tear up.

3.5 StarsShort and quick, I liked The Viscount Who Loved Me okay, but I wasn't much impressed with Anthony. I didn't like that he was going to sleep with his ex mistress, just to get Kate out of his mind. It left a sour taste in my mouth. I liked Kate and I liked her family, Anthony just wasn't the greatest heroes.
Only like my most favorite Historical Romance of all times! I usually don't care for romances but when i do, this is exactly what i look for.
Another wonderfull story from Julia Quinn and the Bridgertons!!! This time was Antony's turn and it was equal interesting and pleasant as Daphne's!!!Antony is the older of all the Bridgertons and he has the title of viscount.I will admit that in the first book, i didn't like him very much because he was making Simon and Daphne's life really hard, but i forgive him because he is her older brother and he was just worried about her well-being...(I'm always at your service, my lovely Viscount!!!)So

Yep, you heard right, but i cannot tell you more about it...Will Kate and Antony will manage to overcome their fears and to let themselves to love each other????I enjoyed and this book of this wonderfull series and i want to learn more about the rest of these family!!!Antony wasn't anything like the society described him.
I love it when an author can take me from hating the hero in the first chapter to adoring him by the last, and that is exactly what Julia Quinn did with Anthony, eldest of the Bridgerton ‘children.’ After his father’s death at age 38, and his uncle’s death which also came at an early age, Anthony is certain he too will die young.
This was a really great historical with a silly side.
It's been a long time since I've read a Julia Quinn novel, but I was dying for a good regency romance and this one really hit the spot.
Some of the situations were just funny, which I wasn't expecting.
But it had some really great conflict that kept me invested.
The hero is determined to marry the Belle of the Ball.
The hero can be a bit of a douche in the beginning so that was good.
I'd recommend to regency lovers!
"And I don't like being denied my rights," he returned, his voice cold and his face a harsh rendition of aristocratic power."(she asked him to wait a week to have sex)Lmao, so the "hero" here is part of those men who try to convince women that they need sex."Tell me," he whispered, his lips pressing against her ear.
"Tell me how to make it right.
For I don't think I can grant you your reprieve." He molded his body against hers, his strong arms holding her close as he groaned, "I can't wait a week, Kate.
I simply cannot like you, dog.
Viscount Anthony Bridgerton feels he’s running out of time, thinking he would die young like his father, decided to finally marry and sire an heir before his young death.
This is the man that really drew me into the story, although sometimes fear can be irrational, I could really understand and feel for him, as it took a lot to face his demons.
Overall: a truly delightful read, with a great message of learning to conquer any fears with a love and understanding.
Jajajajajaja maldigo corgi que es que se hacía un libro solo para las aventuras y trastadas de él.Mi única queja y es pequeñita: es el momento final cuando Anthony se da cuenta de que tiene que decirle a Kate que la quiere.
De repente está discutiendo con sus hermanos y al siguiente dice "tengo que ir a decírselo venga" fue un poco en plan: ¿se te han cortocircuitado las neuronas?
Jajajaja Me hubiera gustado el epílogo estilo de que Kate le dice que está embarazada o algo, quería saber que reacción tenía Anthony.
Very old school romance, but I really liked it!
4,5 Scared Stars.Anthony just knows he’s going to die young.
Kate, her older sister that hates Anthony and refuses to let her sister marry him.
So, when trying to win Kate over so she can allow him to marry her sister, things between them starts to change.
So when feelings starts to grow between them Anthony knows he’s in big trouble.
And how is Anthony will even want to marry one sister, when for the first time his heart beats, his for the other?
HEA: 	(view spoiler)[Yes. And I just love the “far-away-in-the-future” epilogues these books have.
I really disliked Anthony in The Duke And I, and I thought he was an overbearing, judgmental jerk most of the time.
He initially sees Kate's interference in his plan to marry her sister as an annoying obstacle that must be overcome, by any means necessary...even seduction!
He's vowed to never fall in love, but when Anthony and Kate's animosity and rivalry results in powerful attraction and explosive passion, will they take an even greater chance and dare to risk their hearts?
I might not have cared very much for Anthony in the beginning, but I ended up falling for him nearly as hard as Kate did before it was over.
After reading the first book in Julia Quinn’s fantastic “Bridgerton” series, The Duke and I I just had to check out the second book in series “The Viscount Who Loved Me” and man, was I blown away by this book!Anthony Bridgerton, who is well-known as being London’s most notorious rake, takes London by storm when he decides that he wants to get married and he has his sights set on Edwina Sheffield.
📚Kate’in dudakları bir gülücükle kıvrıldı. “Bu ne demek?”“Bu şu demek; aşk korkulacak ve uzakta tutulacak bir şey değil. Aşk, yüreğini tamamlayacak kişiyi bulabilmektir. Aşk seni hayal bile edemeyeceğin kadar iyi bir insan haline getirebilecek kişiyi bulabilmektir. Aşk, eşinin gözlerinin içine bakıp şimdiye kadar tanıdığın en mükemmel kişinin o olduğunu iliklerine kadar hissetmektir.”♥♥ Kate mi daha tatlı, Anthony mi karar verene kadar kitap bitti. Ortalamanın üstünde bir historical romance oku
“Bu ne demek?”“Bu şu demek; aşk korkulacak ve uzakta tutulacak bir şey değil.
Aşk seni hayal bile edemeyeceğin kadar iyi bir insan haline getirebilecek kişiyi bulabilmektir.
Çok mutluyum.😍😍Birbirleriyle atışmaları, zekice laf sokmaları ama aynı zamanda kendilerinin bile farkına varamadığı çekimden, tutkudan ölmeleri şahaneydi.
Ama bu kitapta Anthony ve Colin bir adım öne geçtiler, kardeşlerin atışmalarını ve Colin-Kate diyaloglarını okumak da ayrı keyifliydi.Erkek karakteri illa bir şey olsun diye salaklaştırmadan, sevimli pisliklerin ötesine geçirmeden, kadın karakteri de ezik, silik, gurursuz bir tip haline getirmeden de historical yazılabiliyormuş demek.
Loved this not-quite-a-retelling-but-close-enough of The Taming of the Shrew again. And I'll read this again and again if I could.
I liked it much better than book one, The Duke And I!
It's lovely to see the family cohesion not only of the Bridgertons, but of the Sheffields as well.I liked Anthony and Kate very much!Anthony sometimes is rude, arrogant, and overbearing, but he is also smart and playful.
Kate has only positive qualities: she is spirited, smart, selfless, and very lovable.The development of their relationship was engaging.
Not only their love blooms, but their personalities are also strengthened by each other.I like the structure of the novel: it contains a foreword and afterword, prologue and epilogue.
“I think,” Benedict said, leaning back in his chair, “that he’s telling you you’re an ass.”“Just so!” Colin exclaimed.
“It’s more complicated than you think.” “It always is,” Benedict said, with sincerity so false it almost managed to sound sincere.“When you two idiots find women gullible enough to actually marry you,” Anthony snapped, “then you may presume to offer me advice.
At such a young age Anthony has been the Viscount and the head of Bridgerton family which includes a desperate-to-see-her-eight-children-all-marry mother, three amusing brothers and four nosy sisters.
The problem is Anthony believes he would die at young age just like his father.
well, how can I describe the relationship between Anthony and Kate?Certainly it wasn't like this 
It's about looking in the eyes of your wife and knowing, all the way to your bones, that she's simply the best person you've ever known."Swoon."Delightful" seems to be the word of choice I keep coming back to to describe this series.
Super extra bonus points for it not having cheesy romance novel cover art!note: There are some very minor hints of them getting a bit physical with each other (not in the sexual way, there is also a bit of that!), it's mostly slapstick, but if this is an issue for you, you may want to avoid.
Because Anthony is so fucking sure he can control whether he falls in love or not, and Kate just bloody knows no man, especially a handsome and rakish Viscount, could ever fall in love with her.
There are many things I don't particularly like feeling, but if a book gets me involved, even if that means hating with a fierce passion, it's doing its job.Now, in my humble opinion, there are two things one should not feel while reading a book, novella, short story or any written work meant to entertain in any way, rather than strictly inform.
What I can't bring myself to understand, least of all believe, is her prejudice.Kate hates Anthony Bridgerton before even meeting him.
You think you're reading a charmingly sweet, witty and sexy historical romance; then all of a sudden the hero deliberately steps on the heroine's hand and when she dares to scratch his leg to free herself, he kicks her in the stomach for good measure.
But, whatever, that's beside the point ---- the point being, when I read about a male romantic lead kicking the heroine and stepping on her hand - and especially if such behavior is never addressed, explored or (somehow) explained but is treated as a funny interlude - I just know that no matter what happens next, I'm not going to enjoy myself anymore.
Maybe some Tyler Durden type is effectively sabotaging Julia Quinn's books by adding jarring scenes to her otherwise funny stories.
Situacija u kojoj su Anthony i Kate primorani da se venčaju, zato što je ona kompromitovana je zabavna i tužna, jer nam pokazuje strah i bol sa kojim se Anthony bori od očeve smrti.
“Oprostite, molim vas?”“Uistinu nije potrebno da me osakatite, gospođice Sheffield.”“Bila je to nezgoda, uvjeravam vas.” I jest, bila je, iako joj u ovom slučaju nije bilo žao što ne zna dobro plesati.“Zašto”, nastavio je, “je meni u to teško povjerovati?”Iskrenost će joj, brzo odluči Kate, biti najbolja strategija.
So look, when your life is challenging and you need a safe place to rest, Bridgertonville is the best.
While I can't say this was the best in the series for me, it was pretty wonderful.The heroine was my favorite of the two.
She's tough, caring, a little wounded and wonderful.
She had a healthy relationship with her family....no evil villains there, thanx be to dog.
And speaking of dogs, she had a corgi.
How the hell can I not love a woman with a corgi?The hero, Anthony, is fine.
He's witty, neurotic and supposedly dreamy.
I never got the dreamy not did I get the steamy.
Que história tão deliciosa, sem duvida que estou rendida à escrita desta autora, que consegue colocar um sentido de humor nos seus romances, sem tornar a personagens "tolinhas". Gostei muito do 1º livro desta saga e este 2º anda mais. Mulheres fortes e desembaraçadas, que conseguem levar a água ao seu moinho, em tempos em que quem "mandava" eram os homens, mas de uma forma graciosa e divertida. Recomendo, sem duvida e aguardo ansiosamente o próximo livro da familia Bridgerton.
It's his duty so he will find a suitable woman who is intelligent as he desires smart children, but a woman whom he won't be tempted to fall in love with.He settles on Miss Edwina Sheffield, a renowned beauty, but her older sister Katherine "Kate" isn't having any of it.
She wants her sister to find love and happiness, thus Viscount Bridgerton won't do.The book features a continuous banter between Anthony and Kate as she attempts to block Anthony's bid for Edwina's hand.What I loved was the chemistry between the two.
Great plot, character development and narration made this story a winner!
Me ha gustado mucho el añadido "Nota de la autora" y las explicaciones que ahí se dan. Es verdad que en ciertos momentos recuerda un poco al anterior (sigue un mismo esquema) pero tampoco me ha molestado de sobremanera, pues introduce pequeños cambios. Es un libro que engancha muchísimo y se lee super rápido. Por el momento la serie me está encantando (me muero de ganas de llegar al libro de Colin).
I was first introduced to Anthony Bridgerton, the Viscount of the book, in “The Duke and I.” Frankly put, I thought him a hypocrite of the highest nature, and was hesitant to read a book all about him but was looking forward to learning more about him.
I would recommend a person read this book, if you’re looking for a easy read with a hate to love troupe.I'm not sure if I'll continue the series or not but I did enjoy buddy reading with my friend, Sincerae, who lead the way into the Regency Romance genre for me.
The Bridgerton family and their interactions are definitely fun and I liked Kate.
Perhaps I was being dense, but I didn't peg the reason for his not wanting to love his wife until it was stated.
It was also fun to see Kate bring him down a peg or two on a regular basis.
I think the subject was ground in a bit too hard though, to the point that I was like 'damn, is Kate that hideous!'.
Like the Hathaways, a lot of the enjoyment comes from the family dynamics and bickering/teasing siblings.
This makes Anthony look like an idiot for not being able to bother about his family except to decide he'd better not fall in love with the woman he marries because, and I paraquote "that would make it harder".
That's right, being dead will be harder because he'd be in love with his wife.
Yeah, I liked Kate, but as I said above, Anthony wasn't bad when Quinn forgot his backstory and just let him be himself without the stupid "I'm dying young" drama.
LOVE this book!September 1-2, 2010April 1, 2007This was the first Julia Quinn book I ever read (even though it's the second in the series), and it is still my favorite.
I've read it like 4 or 5 times now...The thing I LOVE about this book is that it is just SO FUNNY.
I want to read it again!One thing I love about Julia's writing is how she endears the characters to you.
He's a Rake (with a capital R, as explained in the first chapter), and I probably wouldn't have liked his character very much.
Yes, I wouldn't have liked Anthony...
