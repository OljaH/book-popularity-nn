Awful. I had wanted to pick this up for a while (to check in on Lewis' ability to write an epic poem for adults -- I had loved Narnia in the first half of elementary school) -- a horrible mistake. Even worse than his apologetics. Reads like a 15 year old's first long poem. He was nearly double that age when he published it.
C.S. Lewis was a brilliant mind and a great author.
Dymer is one of Lewis' first published pieces - an epic poem that lacks epic scope and vision; in short, it is not a brilliant book.The titular main character Dymer is born into "The Perfect City," a seemingly dystopian society where individual thought is eschewed in favor of the homogeneous collective.
Dymer is awoken from this reverie and in running from it to pursue Life, leaves the door open to chaos behind him and strange adventures ahead.Lewis began writing Dymer at a young age, and the book lacks maturity and depth.
