How do you screw up your story quite so badly after starting from an INCREDIBLE premise involving the most notorious assassin in the land - now a slave - being offered the chance to win back her freedom, sort of, in a "to-the-death tournament - fighting the most gifted thieves and assassins in the land" [says the back of my book, conveniently forgetting that (a) right before the final duels, the king specifically states that the competitors "can win only by trapping [their] opponent[s] in a position of sure death ...
DNF 35%Meet Celaena. She‚Äôs the world‚Äôs best assassin. Or so we‚Äôre told. She‚Äôs very, very talented. Very talented. And famous. She‚Äôs also really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, *takes a deep breath* really pretty. It was true that she had been attractive once, beautiful even.She looked at her rags and stained skin, and she couldn‚Äô
It was true that she had been attractive once, beautiful even.She looked at her rags and stained skin, and she couldn‚Äôt suppress the twinge of shame.
In short, Celaena Sardothien was blessed with a handful of attractive features that compensated for the majority of average ones; and, by early adolescence, she‚Äôd discovered that with the help of cosmetics, these average features could easily match the extraordinary assets.‚ÄúWhat remarkable eyes you have!‚ÄùThe prince‚Äôs eyes shone with amusement at her brashness but lingered a bit too long on her body.No, he had to remember that she was an assassin with the blessing of a pretty face [‚Ä¶]He found her beautiful.
First cover: "Yeah, don't I look badass in this?
I think I need to pose like this, so I look all strong and tough."Second cover: "Fuck off or I'll end you."I still stand by my opinions on the covers.
I never liked the first cover, and am infinitely grateful that they changed them for the sequels.
I feel like these covers portray two very different extremes, and Celaena seemed to possess a quality from each of them.
But as soon as I read the prequels, I fell in love, and I definitely have high hopes for this series.
Caleana Sardothien, young woman assassin, is betrayed and sentenced to the salt mines of Endovier.
After a year, however, she is given an opportunity: If she wins a contest to become the king's champion, she will be granted a four-year contract, working as an assassin for the empire she hates, at the end of which time she will be freed.
After reading the premise of the book, I thought, "Sign me up!" After the first chapter, I knew I was in good hands.
This book has plenty of mystery, magic, humor and romance -- a perfect brew for fans of good YA fantasy.
3.5-4 stars? I CAN'T DECIDE JUST YET!I decided to reread this book, as I am about to continue on with the series, finally!I did really enjoy this the second time round, but found myself a little more critical of a few things. I will be doing a full video review of this soon, so look forward to more of my thoughts then :)
People are rating this book low because they don't "like" Celaena, saying she's "arrogant" or "self-centred" or "over-confident," first of all, if Celaena were a guy, you'd be head-over-heels for her.
I would, however, like to see his character develop further, because right now he's; [x] Not what he seems[x] Doesn't like being a prince[x] Insanely good-looking[x] Has daddy issues.
Sometimes he's so frustrating, other times he's so adorable I want to hug him.Right now, I've already read The Assasin's Blade and Crown of Midnight, I'm also halfway through an ARC of Heir of Fire and I can confidently say that if you give this series a fair shot (and Celaena too) then you'll see what I love so much about it.
Oh well, maybe it's just me...or maybe because this book just plain sucks.Let's start off with our protagonist, Celaena who's the "greatest assassin in the world."Okay, I'm cool with that.
There's a bag of candy left on Calaena's bed with no note or anything.
And what does the 'greatest assassin in the world do?
She gobbles them up immediately, going Oh, how I adored candies!Remember that episode in Avatar: the Last Airbender when Sokka drinks cactus juice and gets all high?
In fact, I'm pretty sure she's a Mary Sue. Let's check off her traits, shall we?
I DID IT!!! OMFFFFFFG! THIS BOOKWAS JUSTSOF******GOOD! What is even going on, how did i not read this sooner! I am now onto Crown Of Midnight and DYING! LOVE LOVE LOVEI FINALLY READ IT PEOPLE! SO HAPPY
I did want to know how this story ended, and yes, there were actually parts when I feared the whole thing would not end well ‚Äì partly because my beloved heroine did not deem it necessary to inform certain people about what she had witnessed in the castle.
Many things remained unsaid ‚Äì doubtlessly for the sake of sequels yet to come ‚Äì but it was not the subtle way of remaining unsaid but hinted at I love in fantasy novels, it felt more like remaining unsaid to lure me into reading on.

First of all,look at this amazing cover.I also liked the first one but this is a masterpiece.I do have a weakness for awesome covers,that's why I decided to read this.Also a lot of people recommended this to me,and I heard great things and saw great reviews for this one.So I picked this up.It didn't disappoint.
____________________________________________Calaena is one of my favorite badass heroines.She is funny and awesome and likes teasing.Chaol and Dorian,they both were the same for me,good characters with common and different personalities.____________________________________________
I highly recommend this book to every reader out there.It's one of my favorites of 2014 and I can't wait to read the rest of the series.So pick it up!
Characters were badly written, the plot was full of telling instead of showing. Very underwhelmed after hearing for years that this was THE YA series to read. I don't mind unlikeable characters, heck I love them but it didn't feel I was supposed to dislike our main snowflake. So tired of the "strong" female character who can kill everyone in a heartbeat but she's tiny and incredibly pretty, she hates all other women and... Oh also everyone wants her... just because.For more details and quotes, here's my reading vlog https://youtu.be/euovGE_A1Ik
It feels like Throne of Glass has been a book I've been thinking about maybe reading for a million years.
That is, until one day The Crown Prince (Dorian) and his Captain of the Guard (Chaol) arrive with a proposition for her - fight in a competition, win, become the King's Champion for four years, and finally earn her freedom.
I'm hoping it will please me more than the sequel to Shadow and Bone did, but the ending of this does make me think the second book could have more action and nastiness (yes!).
DNF at 29%I'M SORRY. I JUST CAN'T DO IT. I feel like I could have really enjoyed this book... Two years ago. The hype absolutely killed it for me. Celaena is also really annoying so I'm just going to stop reading this. I know everybody says the books get better later on but I like to enjoy the beginning and the characters before I invest my time in a 6-book series.
Also I like the way the author plays with her feeling even though she is an assassin she is still very young and prone to her feeling and ego getting hurt.The book does leave a lot of questions many of which are for the second novel, but as much as I hate prequels I will have to read the back up stories on the kindle version.
Like I said earlier this book was more about Celaena recapturing her old form and claiming a position of power, also setting up her side cast, I am expecting a lot more action in the next book after all the training in this book.
Now, before I start, I must say that I‚Äôve been forewarned by a lot of readers that this is probably the weakest book in the series and that the writing is a bit quirky, because at the time, the author was young and (I suppose) unexperienced.
I get it that she's a girl who likes being pretty and wearing nice clothes and dating hot boys (I actually love it when a female character can be girly and badass at the same time), but she's just so narcissistic and stubborn, she never (or rarely) speaks without thinking first, that you can't help but put aside her best sides and focus on the tooth-cringing ones.
3.5-4 StarsYeah, I know. I‚Äôm the last fucker around to read this book. But I saw the whole series in spiffy hardcover on sale at Costco and so, of course, I responsibly bought only the first one to make sure I liked it before buying more bought the whole damn series in one go because, well, no impulse control. But anyway.This was fun. I liked it. I look forward to the next one. Which is good. Since, as I said, I already have the next one, and the one after that...Oh, and #TeamChaol
SO. FREAKING. GOOD. My review will be up this week on my channel Abookutopia :)
I hateread a chapter from book five of this series with a friend. And I'm going to register my opinion that while it may have slightly improved in character development or worldbuilding or etc etc etc - I wouldn't know - it is, objectively, just as horribly written as this book.And that's the tea.  üå∫ montage of me screaming "why is this hyped" for five hours  Let me give this book one minuscule fragment of credit: the plot isn't horrible. Okay, yeah, the plot is kind of boring and there are a lo
And I'm going to register my opinion that while it may have slightly improved in character development or worldbuilding or etc etc etc - I wouldn't know - it is, objectively, just as horribly written as this book.And that's the tea.
Frankly, tragic pasts need a lot of fleshing out to be compelling and believable, and I don't even think Celaena's trauma is acknowledged once in this book - come on, at least do the bare minimum?
This could be Celaena if she were cleverer and a bit - okay, a lot - more fleshed out.
This book was sooooo goood! The main female character is amazing, SHE WAS PRACTICAL. Not to mention completely badass, and could kill anyone with a hairpin if she wanted to. Great high fantasy, i cannot wait for the next in the series! HIGHLY RECOMMEND!
4/5 Stars ‚≠ê ‚≠ê ‚≠ê ‚≠ê‚ÄúLibraries were full of ideas‚Äîperhaps the most dangerous and powerful of all weapons.‚Äù Here I am again, back in a different world of Sarah J. Maas! This is a very popular series. An extremely popular series, an exceptionally hyped up series, a tremendously OLD AF SERIES. Listen to me here, if I were a fantasy fan when I was a teenager, I would have definitely read this book. But you know, my relationship with fantasy hasn't been lit for the last 2583 years, so I hadn't picked it
I started loving fantasy again this year because of A Court of Thorns and Roses, a book I bought because I needed it for my uni thesis, not because I was interested in reading fantasy again.
ANYWAY, LET'S TALK ABOUT THIS BOOK.After serving out a year of hard labor in the salt mines of Endovier for her crimes, 18-year-old assassin Celaena Sardothien is dragged before the Crown Prince.
Some things in the writing of this book weren't my thing, like repetitions of some phrases, "assassin" being referred to Celaena the whole entire time (which bugged me a bit), poor choice of words at some parts.
choose the competitors for him.I may not be a direct member of a royal family myself, but I know there are things such as court intrigue and hidden agendas and hell, there are hundreds upon thousands of discrete allegiances and plots being made left, right and centre.Do you really want your future, "loyal" Champion to be handpicked out of a number of criminals and entrusted to your councilmen?The whole competition thing wasn't at all very thought through.
this book is fucking horrible.
i wanted some badassery but instead i got a shitty love traingle and annoying characters who i wished just.........
then i forced myself to suffer and actually read and i found it somewhat alrightbut this book was still fucking bad?
Also, don't come @ me saying I didnt read the right book or "your opinion is wrong bitch!!!!!" do yourself a favor and leave and don't annoy me with comments like that.
everyone has a right to express their opinions however they want.
seriously, I'm so excited to read the badly written smut and growls and purrs and talons.
Obsession isn‚Äôt enough of a word to describe what I feel towards Sarah J Maas and these books.
But it helped reading The Assassin's Blade before Throne of Glass as it delved deeper into Celaena's character and one is able to form a connection with her.
Her skills as an assassin aren't really explored in Throne of Glass, it's all talk and no action.
But reading the prequel novellas, you are able to see how hardcore and badass she actually is, thus accepting the all talk and no action that happens in Throne of Glass.
That by no means makes this a bad book, because despite those annoyances, I was fully engrossed in Throne of Glass.The Plot and Writing:While the synopsis may come off feeling a little Hunger Game-esque, let me calm your fears now.
Celaena is a young assassin who begins the book being dragged from her prison in Endovier, a salt mine prison for criminals.
It's kinda like this: I knew how things probably would end, but I still ended up having fun along the way.Even with it being a little over 400 pages long, it certainly doesn't read like that.
;DAs for Celaena, well, she and I had this love/hate relationship going on.
Since this review doesn't already have enough lists, here's another to get you through the day.This book contains the following:‚Ä¢ (view spoiler)[ long lost princess  (hide spoiler)] Celaena who is both beautiful not like other girls‚Ä¢ the amazingly young and single and hot bachelor prince Dorian who is not like his tyrant father‚Ä¢ the young and successful and hot best friend guard prodigy Chaol with family issues‚Ä¢ the mean tyrant king who is so unimportant to the plot SJM forgot to give him a name but he's mean and hates life ‚Ä¢ a love triangle bc all YA fantasies published in 2012 need a love triangle‚Ä¢ also bc it is 2012 and we are trying to leech off the success of the Hunger Games probably there is a lot of weapons and archery and "will she survive" stuff going on‚Ä¢ the beautiful princess, Nehemia,  who's somehow still a princess even though her country was overtaken like five years before  that seems to have ulterior motives but we also need her bc friendship‚Ä¢ The main character is a strong independent women who don't need no man so obviously she needs a man‚Ä¢ Forbidden magic bc that's such a game changer.
DNF @ 50%This book was such a huge disappointment.A young, notorious female assassin is thrust into a competition where she must fight for her freedom in exchange for service as the King's body guard?
There's no way some badass assassin would have a giggly, carefree demeanor upon meeting Prince Dorian and Captain Chaol, these are both people she should loathe?
The author keeps harping on the idea that Celaena Sardothien is a top notch, tough as nails killer with little fear or inhibition, but hardly anything Celaena does actually reflects that.
The author told me exactly how I should feel at every turn, but did little to SHOW me why I should feel that way.
Throne of Glass came to me highly recommended by someone who thinks Twilight is among the best books of all time, so I was instantly wary, but I promised to keep an open mind since, well, high fantasy and a kick ass assassin, what could go wrong?
She started out with her badass chick assassin, Celaena Sardothien, figured she needed a love triangle to keep the romance interesting, then settled on a plot, and finally filled in the setting.
Why Erilea?Celaena herself may be the best thing about this book, but that's not saying much.
Reviewed by: Rabid ReadsThe first time I saw my sister after I finished reading THRONE OF GLASS by Sarah J.
I pestered, cajoled, and harassed her until she downloaded the THRONE OF GLASS sample chapters and read them.She stopped reading her book and read ToG until the wee morning hours when she finished it.*lap of victory*A few months later, my mom came to visit for a long weekend.
No big.And it isn't for Celaena b/c Celaena is just that good.SIDE RANT: I‚Äôve read a lot of reviews for this book, and the most common complaint is that Celaena is too girly to be a believable assassin.
The Assassin's Blade: The Throne of Glass Novellas
LOVED THIS BOOK: Here's my full review complete with discussion and theories http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xlmj_t...
It actually got good.
So I think a 3.5 star rating is fair and evident that I'll continue on with the series bc now I'm hooked THANKS A LOT SJM!
PS- I know this was written when she was a heck of a lot younger, but did anyone else feel like this series (at least starts off) more juvenile and immature than ACOTAR?
