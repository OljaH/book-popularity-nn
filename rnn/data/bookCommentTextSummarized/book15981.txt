Need you ask!Psycho killer as dumpy middle aged nobody with a big gut but really remarkable sexual vitality who surprisingly seems to have more moves than Batman as he manhandles and incapacitates both his victims and his pursuers with contemptuous ease even though COME ON REALLY he’s a dumpy middle aged nobody who hasn’t done any physical exercise for the last 40 years – check!Hectic every-second-counts chase at the grand finale – check!Eventually I almost began to like this silly slice of tough tough London kinky killer thriller fol-de-rol but then the big climax (ahem ahem sorry vicar) dragged on and on and, oh yes, on, with so many arcs of arterial blood on the walls and splashes of that other well known bodily fluid all over the dinner plates and just everywhere that I found myself frankly guffawing.
No matter where I lay this book, it immediately improved the visual aspects of that space.
And it is not only the visual aspects that appeal; there is a feeling of what?
Not even one of these women has been reported missing, suggesting the killer has taken some care in selecting his victims.Hayder pulls no punches here as she takes you on a slow and sinister creep ride into the world of a sexual sadist, through the corridors of crime most foul.
This marks the first Mo Hayder novel I have read.
But with Birdman, her debut novel, she launches herself right into the darkest of Val McDermid's territory.
Take a serial killer with a bizarre signature, an inspector with a dark past and struggling relationship, and short chapters, and you've got a formula for a novel that deserves to be read without petty distractions like work and sleep.The serial killer genre has been so saturated over the past twenty years.
In a genre that can barely help but become formulaic, the writer can still come up with unique ideas that makes the story her own.
" Yes, I believe I have become a Mo Fo'n, Mo Hayder fan.During the first half of this book I would have said that Mo was giving Thomas Harris a run for his money...
The second half veered a little and I thought the train was in danger of derailing, taking more of a Joe Hill course, but I made it to the end in one piece, still considering this to be an excellent thriller-horror.
Jack Caffery, a good detective with his own tragedies weighing him down, is a great character that I look forward to following in Hayder's, The Treatment.
This book was the " Pick It For Me", with my group " A Good Thriller", so thank you to my members that picked this book for me.Detective Inspector Jack Caffery - young, driven, unshockable - is called to one of the most gruesome crime scenes he has ever seen.
With a great strong main character in DI Jack Caffery who himself has a shocking history, with lots of shocks, twists and very strong deaths.A fast paced, gripping, tense thriller that will shock you with it's gore, not for the faint hearted!But highly recommended and an easy four stars for me
Creepy. Creepy. Creepy. - 3    It is my personal belief that given the right set of circumstances ANYONE is capable of murder. If someone tells me that they are not capable of killing another human, I will disagree with them. Having said that, there are some things that I don't believe every person capable of doing. While I might believe your grandma is capable of shooting or poisoning someone, I don't necessarily believe that she is capable of then cutting them up and cooking them in a stew f
Having said that, there are some things that I don't believe every person capable of doing.
While I enjoy reading about these things, I believe I have found my upper limit for what I can stomach.
There is an interesting exploration of how a person feels compelled to do bad things, the steps he takes to avoid doing them and the ultimate failure of those boundaries.
We have some people in this novel who are interested in necrophilia.
As this was not the only aspect of the novel, this theme was not pervasive.Another major issue with the novel was the manner in which Jack Caffery made breakthroughs in the case.
Έφτασε επιτελους η πολυαναμενομενη περιοδος που θα περναω ομορφα βραδια διαβαζοντας στο μπαλκονακι μου αστυνομικα σαν και αυτο εδω 😀😀😀
The crime itself is also approached from an odd angle as we are given the perspectives of both the detectives attempting to solve the case and the murder as well as, briefly, the victims.
The reader is in the unique position of having all the facts and is only waiting for the good guys to piece the puzzle together, or so we are led to believe...I have also, myself, approached this book from an odd perspective as my first experience with Mo Hayder's brilliance was early last year when I read Poppet, the sixth installment to the Jack Caffrey series.
Τα αστυνομικά μυθιστορήματα ανήκουν στα αγαπημένα μου αναγνώσματα. Είμαι "επιρρεπής" σε αναγνώσματα βιβλίων και δη αστυνομικών, που ξεφεύγουν από τα όρια και ίσως είναι υπερβολικά για κάποιους αναγνώστες. Η ιστορία είναι πολύ καλά στημένη και περίπου στα μισά, μοιάζει να έχει βρεθεί η άκρη του νήματος αλλά...Αν αυτό το βιβλίο ήταν το ντεμπούτο της στο αστυνομικό μυθιστόρημα, δεν μπορώ να φανταστώ τι έπεται για τη συνέχεια.4,5* Σ.Σ Από τη συγγραφέα είχα διαβάσει το βιβλίο της Τόκυο, πριν εκδοθεί στα ελληνικά η συγκεκριμμένη σειρά με πρωταγωνιστή το ντετέκτιβ Κάφερι.
Πρώτον, οφείλω να παραδεχτώ πως το βιβλίο είναι αρκετά 'άρρωστο',ακόμα και για σκληρό αστυνομικό.
Η Hayder έχει γράψει μια απίστευτη ιστορία, που δικαιώνει απόλυτα την επιτυχία της...πρωτάρας συγγραφέως της, αλλά και πάλι ΑΝ ΓΡΑΦΕΙ ΕΤΣΙ ΣΤΟ ΠΡΩΤΟ ΤΙ ΘΑ ΚΑΝΕΙ ΣΤΑ ΕΠΟΜΕΝΑ;!
Τη ζήλεψα τη φαντασία της -όσο κι αν ήταν κάπως αρρωστημένα τα προϊόντα της- και πραγματικά το βιβλίο είναι ένα καλογραμμένο, αξιολογότατο και συναρπαστικότατο αστυνομικό θρίλερ, που αξίζει να διαβαστεί από λάτρεις του είδους - εκτός αν δεν το έχετε με τις πολύ περίεργες καταστάσεις και αηδιάζετε σχετικά εύκολα.Τρίτον, νομίζω πως ο Τζακ Κάφερι είναι ο νέος αντι-ήρωας αστυνομικός που θα τραβήξει το ενδιαφέρον μου.
Pretty good premise on the make-up of the hero detective, but I couldn’t quite deal with the Gothic excess of violence .
Your mileage might vary.Our thirtysomething detective on the London police, Jack Caffery.
Like a lot of tough guys in crime noir, our man has a troubled past.
The police procedural parts on the uncovering of the evidence of a fiendish serial killer who preys on prostitutes has some good momentum at the beginning.
Our Jack pursues the johns against a lot of resistance.
I liked Caffery as a character whose messy personal life adds to his commitment to work.
Her education and insight into the human condition ooze from every line she writes.Or in other words, Val McDermid's thrillers and her abilities are the absolute opposite of Mo Hayder's effort here, even though it is quite clear that this is kind of what Hayder aims for - and doesn't achieve.Unfortunately prose is not erudite and brilliant just because it contains a set amount of words people need to look up to grasp.
For people with a bit more experience this thriller quickly becomes tedious and boring.Oh, and Mo Hayder lost my last shred of good will with how she wallowed in maiming, killing, torturing, abusing animals.
This murder mystery has the usual flawed police detective, Jack Caffery,(who you can't help but like) and just when you think Caffery's got it figured out, think again :-). This is VERY dark, twisted and gory! If you are squeamish this is probably not for you! I can't help but wonder what goes on in the minds of these authors! I'm looking forward to finding out what else Jack Caffery gets into in the next installment!
Δεν είναι όμως αυτή η πρώτη μου επαφή με την συγγραφέα, έχω διαβάσει το ΤΟΚΥΟ που μου άρεσε πολύ.Ο ντεντέκτιβ Τζακ Κάφερι αναλαμβάνει μια από τις πιο δύσκολες υποθέσεις στην καριέρα του.
«Το φονικό κελάηδισμα» είναι γεμάτο με άρρωστες σκηνές που αρκετά συχνά είναι και αηδιαστικές αλλά στην προκειμένη περίπτωση δουλεύει καλά γιατί έχει δημιουργήσει χαρακτήρες που είναι αρκετά «φυσιολογικοί» και δεν κλέβουν τα φώτα από την υπόθεση, αφήνοντας τον αναγνώστη να αναπνεύσει λίγο.
Η συγγραφέας αποκαλύπτει αρκετά από την αρχή μέχρι το ανατρεπτικό φινάλε και σου δίνει συνεχώς έναυσμα να μην σταματάς το διάβασμα.Η γραφή μου άρεσε, ήταν απλή, περιεκτική και δεν έχασε ποτέ το στόχο της.
Από τα καλύτερα αστυνομικά που έχω διαβάσει. 5/5, γιατί είναι και το πρώτο της.•πολύ δυνατή υπόθεση•πολύ καλή γραφή•ευκολοδιάβαστο•σοκαριστικό λόγω θέματος, σε ταρακουνάει•καλοστημένο background •ανατρεπτική εξέλιξη •ωραίος τύπος ο επιθεωρητής Caffery και σε κάνει να θες να μάθεις τι κάνει στο επόμενο..Προσοχή: Εάν δεν έχετε γερό στομάχι και ταράζεστε εύκολα, μην το διαβάσετε. Εγώ σε μερικά σημεία ανακατεύτηκα αρκετά. Στα (-) ο ελληνικός τίτλος. Θα προτιμούσα την ακριβή μετάφραση του πρωτότυπου (Birdman).
I am giving this 3-1/2 stars.The title character in Mo Hayder’s Birdman is nowhere near as benevolent as Jack Stroud, the infamous prisoner of Alcatraz.
I liked that we were given some of the story from the bad guy’s perspective.
Despite the fact that the details – which, I have to say, were described very vividly - were in my opinion, much too graphic, I was able to stay interested throughout the book.I have ambivalent feelings about Birdman; I liked it, but I definitely did not love it.
I am not sure whether I will be reading any more of Mo Hayder’s work in the near future, as I wasn’t enamored with Jack Caffrey as the protagonist.

Ένα πολύ καλό και δυνατό ντεμπούτο!Η πρώτη ιστορία του Τζακ Κάφερι έχει ότι χρειάζεται ένα αστυνομικό θρίλερ. Γρήγορη πλοκή, έξυπνη υπόθεση, καλοστημένους ήρωες (αστυνομικούς και δολοφόνους) και πολλές, πολλές ανατριχιαστικές λεπτομέρειες. Είναι ένα βιβλίο που χρειάζεται γερό στομάχι καθώς αναλύει πολύ διεξοδικά τον τρόπο δολοφονίας οπότε όποιος αποφασίσει να το διαβάσει πρέπει να είναι προετοιμασμένος.Δεν θα πω περισσότερα. Είναι ένα βιβλίο που έχει όλο το πακέτο οπότε οι λάτρεις του είδους ας το προσθέσουν στη συλλογή τους!Σειρά τώρα έχει «Η σιωπή των δέντρων» και αν κινείται στα ίδια πλαίσια θα πρέπει σύντομα να αποκτήσω και την «Τελετουργία».
To me, it is books like this - that become popular with comments about how "great" they are...that make me realize how easily most readers are pleased and entertained by the lowest common denominator.
It is a bit gross - as usual, a less talented writer trying to be scary or shocking by using very harsh language and disgusting descriptions...that's not scary or shocking.
I put Hayder right up there with other popular but horrible writers like Lehane, Patterson, Nesbo - always touted as great but just rehashed tripe.I'm sure many will disagree - the many that keep these writers on the bestseller lists YUCK
Excellent mystery novel. Mo Hayder manages to create a superb and frighteningly real detective that I became totally engrossed in reading about. The graphic violence and detestable nature of the antagonist paired with an eclectic cast of characters made this book a fantastic read. Jack Caffrey is a truly empathetic character and I found myself engaged throughout the entire mystery. The Birdman's M.O. was also quite unique and inventive. Violent, bloody, disgusting, and intriguing. "Birdman" certainly delivers a knock out blow.
Ωχ τι ήταν αυτό που διάβασα; Πολύ σκληρό σε κάποια σημεία, πολλή ανωμαλία, πολύ αίμα. Νομίζω πρέπει να διαβάσω μερικα young adult για να επανέλθει ο ψυχισμός μου σε κανονικά επίπεδα!! Είναι όλα τα βιβλία της ιδιας συγγραφέως έτσι; Νομίζω ότι την φοβήθηκε το μάτι μου!
Παράλληλα με τις έρευνές του, που τον οδηγούν σε όλο και πιο τρομακτικά στοιχεία, ο Τζακ καλείται να αντιμετωπίσει τους προσωπικούς του δαίμονες, μα και στις τρικλοποδιές που δέχεται από άτομα του Σώματός του.Πριν αποφασίσει κάποιος να διαβάσει το συγκεκριμένο βιβλίο, πρέπει να ξέρει πως αυτό προορίζεται για γερά στομάχια.
Η συγγραφέας δεν αποτυπώνει ένα σαδιστή δολοφόνο, αλλά ένα αρρωστημένο μυαλό που παίρνει ικανοποίηση από την βεβήλωση των πτωμάτων των θυμάτων του.Πολλοί ψυχολόγοι και ψυχαναλυτές ισχυρίζονται πως οι κατά συρροή δολοφόνοι αντλούν μεγαλύτερη ικανοποίηση και ηδονή όταν βασανίζουν τα θύματά τους, όσο αυτά είναι ακόμα εν ζωή.
This very dark and brutally gory book is the first in the Jack Caffery series by British crime writer Mo Hayder.London Detective Inspector Jack Caffery, newly assigned to a particular investigative unit, gets involved with a frightening case involving a serial murderer.
But, as Yogi Berra used to say, "The opera's not over until the fat lady sings".As always with darkly imaginative Mo Hayder, the twists and turns are innumerable and unpredictable.This is brilliantly written and Damien Goodwin does a great job with reading the audio (except when he occasionally renders female characters excessively shrill).But---I have to say that the amount of brutality, gore, and violence in this is really over the top, and I found it too much at times.
This looked interesting, but started off slow & never really got me going.
Might have been the format, although the reader wasn't bad, but I did want to move him & the story along.
Seemed very realistic, maybe too much so.
Police procedure isn't exciting as it is on TV.I also didn't care much for the main character.
Again, he wasn't awful, but nothing about him drew me in.
He's meticulous, OCD, & wants to play by the rules, but there are limits.
This was well beyond normal limits, though.
No way.Anyway, I got 1/3 of the way through it.
Το ξεκίνησα μια περίοδο που είχα τρελό τρέξιμο με τα προσωπικά μου.Παρ'όλα αυτά με κράτησε σε εγρήγορση και πάντα έβρισκα λίγο χρόνο να διαβάσω κάποιες σελίδες.Ο Καφερι ειναι ωραίος τυπος,εχει τα προβλήματα του κι αυτο τον κάνει συμπαθητικό.Από τη Διόπτρα μου είπαν ότι σύντομα θα έχουμε νέα ιστορία με αυτόν.Αναμενουμε.
Not sure whether I should be more worried about me "enjoying" this rather sick and gruesome book or the author for writing it. Not recommended for those of a squeamish disposition. .but right up my street. Straight on to The Treatment Jack Caffery book 2 for me now
I thoroughly enjoyed this book and will continue on with more from this author. I was warned it was gruesome, which it was, but this did not turn me off at all.
Audible. Narrated by Damien Goodwin.
A pretty good yarn with some twists, but I thought the author wallowed in the gore excessively and lost sight of developing the characters.
That the author relies on detailed description of the gross and gory is, I think intended to provide realism and some street cred for the author, which it does, but then goes on and on overshadowing the needs of the characters to give richness to a pretty good overall plot and structure.
I the end, I didn't feel connected to the characters, so the impacts of the plot were robbed of their full effect upon me as a reader.
I was reading along, enjoying the tour of London and the exposure to British terms that I had never heard before, admiring the detail of the forensics (I was thinking of calling this CSI London), getting into these interesting characters, trying to solve the clues and only getting it partially right---which I am sure is what the author intended, and then in the last 20% this thing got very dark and naaasty.
Suffice it to say that Hayder pulls no punches.
No quarter is given and no one is safe.
I am most definitely hooked and already have the next two in the series loaded onto the Kindle.
