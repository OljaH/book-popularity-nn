However, I would say that the author is writing what she knows at the time and never gets malicious to or speaks down about anyone in her story - even if there are undertones that might be considered inappropriate today.
In fact, I think she does a pretty good job of giving us a glimpse into native life in Africa only one generation removed from no outside influence.Another thing I did not really see in the book is any hatred between religions or judgement of people because of who they are.
This reminded me of Robert Burns' Ploughman in to a Mouse: I'm truly sorry Man's dominion / Has broken Nature's social union, or as she has it When the first steam engine was constructed, the roads of the races of the world parted, and we have never found one another since (p.153), for her the occasional man who is out of time and more akin to an earlier era can more readily understand and be understood by 'the Natives'.Natives is her key term, at first it seemed to be used just to describe the Kikuyu, but eventually other highland peoples, but the Somali don't seem to be Native in the same way, and while her blacksmith who is from the Punjab (view spoiler)[ and sends all his wages home, receiving in exchange photographs of the family (hide spoiler)] isn't a Native there is a clear sense of superiority and inferiority in her text.
If the book contained itself to her impressions of the land, I would have loved this book, too.Unfortunately, no amount of lyrical prose was able to outweigh the aspects of the book that really drove me nuts, none more so than the way author writes about the people of Kenya and, by doing so, what we learn about the author herself.After reading only a couple of chapter I was utterly conflicted whether the author's constant racism was a result of her genuine believe that white Europeans were supreme to the primitive natives or whether her offensive descriptions of "the Natives" was a result of some sort of mistake in articulating what she really meant.Seeing the she continued to generalise about African people and compare them to animals throughout the book, it leaves little argument against the assumption that Dinesen really believed in the superiority of the white "Immigrants".
Karen Blixen (alias: Isak Dinesen, 1885-1962) has the ability to transport you to the early 20th century Africa.
As I was leafing the pages of this book, I was doing the inhale-exhale that my wife normally tells me to do whenever we are spending a weekend in a resort far from the polluted Manila.
"Out of Africa by Isak Dinesen is one of the most beautiful books of the twentieth century."
True that some of the beautiful beautiful passages of the books were spoken by the characters but nothing can compare to reading actual prose straight from the pen of Isak Dinesen.
They just add a few more details about events and characters mentioned in the original book.The movie Out of Africa, starring Robert Redford and Meryl Streep, was produced and directed by Sydney Pollack.
The movie and Out of Africa / Shadows on the Grass are quite different.
The book, if it is to be classified as a love story, is of a love between a woman and a land, Africa, more specifically the Kenyan highlands and the Ngong Hills, southwest of Nairobi where she had her coffee farm.
The author writes of her African life having returned to Denmark.
I start with the famous paragraph:"If I know a song of Africa, of the giraffe and the African new moon lying on her back, of the plows in the fields and the sweaty faces of the coffee pickers, does Africa know a song of me?
I also re-read this often:"People who dream when they sleep at night know of a special kind of happiness, which the world of the day knows not, a placid ecstasy, and ease of heart, that are like honey on the tongue.
I cried four times while reading this book.
For the beauty of the writing (fireflies), the sentiment (the zoo animals, lulu) and for gratitude that this woman existed and wrote these words down.
It's my favorite type of writing - descriptive and evocative.
She is able to make me feel like I am there with her.
I think she noticed and felt so much that she had to be a writer.
This was a strong woman who seemed to keep a sense of innocence that allowed her to feel and see the gentle beauty in everything and everyone that is around us always.
It is due, I believe, to their acquaintance with a variety of races and tribes, and to the lively human intercourse that was brought upon East Africa, first by the old traders of ivory and slaves, and in our days by the settlers and big-game hunters.” – Karen Blixen, Out of Africa Technology was rarely used in these parts of the world.
Great landscapes create themselves, long splendid views, bright and delicate colors, roads, houses, which he has never seen or heard of.― Karen Blixen, Out of AfricaTowards the end of the book, you get a sense of her sadness about having to leave Africa.
Short of booking passage to Nairobi, reading this 1937 memoir of Danish author Karen Blixen (using the pen name Isak Dinesen) who arrived in East Africa in 1914 with her husband in a bid to grow coffee beans, is the next best thing.
It might be even be more instructive than visiting Africa as a tourist, as Blixen's vivid and sensual writing makes you feel as if you've lived there.The Blixens separated in 1921 and it's revealing that the author never mentions her ex-husband or touches on her personal life.
The book is not about Karen Blixen so much as it's about the experience of living in another world.
This was a beautiful book.
Reminiscent of Richard Llewllyn's "How Green Was My Valley", "O.O.A." is a work of love, a sensitive soul's lyrical tribute to a beloved landscape.
The passages are often long and I found I needed more stamina than I'm used to in order to keep up with Dinesen's meandering's of mind and memory, but almost each trek took me to a sudden summit or unveiled an unexpected emotional vista approachable through no better route.
I'd say the book was sad but that the sorrow was the cleansing kind, nothing bitter or belittling.
Loved it.
She tells the story of learning to count in Swahili from a Swede – who told her that there was no number for 9.
Jim and I were on our way to teach high school, with me assigned to math and physics classes.The five-year-old was chattering away in Swahili to me but at the time I understood little beyond simple greetings.
He was trying to teach you to count in Swahili but now he says you’re too dumb to learn!” Maybe some day she told him I was a math teacher.
Having not seen the movie or read the book, but remembering hearing about the movie that Out of Africa is one of the greatest love stories ever told I went into the reading thinking just that.
I was already picturing Meryl Streep and Robert Redford because of the popularity of the movie (though my movie tie-in copy of the book probably did not help).It took me 70 pages to realize that there is no specific story here, that the book is Isak Dinesen's (pseudonym for Baroness Karen Blixen) memoirs of the many years she lived on and ran a coffee plantation in Kenya.
That was my initial expectation but I stuck with the book and as a result, feel like I have a much richer and more detailed picture of life in Kenya in the early 20th century.Some readers have objected to Blixen's language and description of Kenyans and various tribal people.
What this book accomplishes is to preserve the mindset (and a pretty damn forward thinking one at that!) of a specific time period for future readers.
Books like Out of Africa are precious not only for their historic importance, but for the preservation of a way of telling stories.
This is the most glorious, beautifully written book!! I am reading very slowly to savor it and copying lots of quotations. This is a book to keep forever and read often.

of the Giraffe, and the African new moon lying on her back, of the ploughs in the fields, and the sweaty faces of the coffee-pickers, does Africa know a song of me?
All must fade (and it is in this sense that Blixen seems to be a truly Danish author -- for, despite the African sunlight which pervades her book, it is outlined in the colors of the North -- of life lived on beneath the fading trees of Lothlorien).
The things I learned from reading this book: a spelling on how to say hello (male and female) in Maa (Kimaasai, Maasai language) and also putting to words the feeling I had seeing the beauty of the Maasai women with their shaved heads.
I was just 10 days in Olorgesailie in a mainly Maasai area, when I finished a book I gave it to the younger girls to keep so they could read and practice their English.
Though I think Blixen was somewhat ahead of her time, considering her place in the world, her ideas of the "Natives" and "her" people was all a bit much.
However, her viewpoint as the aristocratic landowner surrounded by "Natives" is hard to take.
She may have been "pro-native", well-meaning and open-minded "for her times", but she was still part of an inherently racist colonialism, and approached the Kenyans as children she was obligated to care for.
That she felt great affection for her servants doesn't change the fact that she saw her position as the benevolent ruler as the natural order of things, and her view of the Kenyans is condescending and naive.
Now, while I still recognize its qualities, the romanticization of this period in time just makes me sad.
I did find some of her perceptions about the African people inaccurately judgmental but, by the end of the book, I thought it seemed as though she had a greater understanding and appreciation for cultural differences.
I also wished that the more personal anecdotes and perspectives about her time in Africa, along the lines of what was in the shorter "Shadows on the Grass" segment at the end of this edition, had been incorporated earlier throughout the "Out of Africa" piece so the two were one unit and read a little less like an academic study and a little more like a traditional personal memoir.
I had seen the movie adaptation of this book and loved it for the landscape.
The man who is her lover in the movie appears in the book, but she never explicitly states that he is her lover, and she certainly never discusses the details of their relationship.
It's extremely interesting to see through her eyes, and to hear he thoughts on the different tribes of Africans, and watch her explore her relationships with them and with her fellow transplant Europeans.I highly recommend this book for anyone who loves beautiful writing or is interested in the history of Africa.
Out of Africa uses poetry for what is essentially a memoir, tells gently of human tragedies large and small, and records a lovely time that seems even to the author to be magical and impossible, yet it is nonfiction.Isak Dinesen wrote in her second language - English, just as Josseph Conrad did.
It didn't end well, and the grief we experience to find that Dinesen's love died evokes the perfect film moment in "The English Patient" when Kristen Scott Thomas' blond locks stream in the air over, yes, Africa.
Baroness Blixen returned to Denmark, without fortune or love, and Africa has become a place of poverty and horrors.
I had seen it a number of years ago and didn't remember much of it, but that the wonderful Meryl Streep and Robert Redford had roles in a movie of Africa.
It was not what I expected, as I said, but Dinesen's descriptive writing quality is lovely to read:"These hills, which are amongst the most beautiful in the world, are perhaps at their loveliest seen from the air, when the ridges, care towards the four peaks, mount, and run side by side with the aeroplane, or suddenly sink down and flatten out into a small lawn" (251).That is some poetic, not half-bad prose.Recommended with a dash of salt.
It read very much like an unpracticed storyteller, "this one thing happened, i'm going to talk about it for 20 pages.
but wait, this thing happened before that, and i'll talk about that.
I hated the narrator.
I found the narrator to be narcissistic and pretentious, having the audacity to compare herself to a god more than once, and claiming that she was a sort of idol to the natives.
I would have given this book 1 star, but I really really enjoyed the ending.
I ended the story with a deep respect for the narrator.
Learning her views on race and class in colonial Africa is one of the most interesting (sometimes disquieting) parts of the book.
Baroness Blixen's life and times are fascinating - her very different world view made the book challenging AND worthwhile.I also HIGHLY recommend a less known book in the same genre, West With the Night by Beryl Markham, the memoir of a woman raised in Kenya who later became a bush pilot.
Doing a little research on the lives of these women made the memoirs more interesting to me.
Apesar da péssima tradução é um excelente exemplar daquilo que são Narrativas de Viagens.
Karen Blixen consegue através das suas descrições detalhadas transportar-nos para África em meados do século XX.
Apesar de extenso e bastante descritivo é um livro leve e de leitura corrida.
Somos levados numa viagem até uma África simples e complexa.
Uma viagem sensorial e quente onde a vida, a morte, o destino, a dor e a magia interligam-se profundamente.Não posso afirmar que este livro deixou marcas visíveis em mim, contudo é um livro que vale a pena ler pelas suas descrições e paisagens.
After visiting Karen Blixen's home in Kenya, I decided that I had to read this book, even though I did not like the movie that much. I don't even know how they got a movie out of this book. I might have liked it better if I had not read "Circling the Sun" so recently, but I did and this book pales in comparison. It just didn't do it for me.
I reread this after having visited the site of Karen Blixen's farm near Nairobi. The writing is evocative and absolutely gorgeous, but there's a current of colonial-era era racism that you can't ignore.
"But the trouble is not as you think now, that we have put up obstacles too high for you to jump, and how could we possibly do that, you great leaper?"
If I closed my eyes, I could almost feel the hot sun, and smell the grass of the plains of Africa, along with hearing the roar of a lion.
This is not a book however for a person seeking high adventure.
Living on a coffee farm, it appears, is quite a non-action endeavor.
I have seen some people complain about the racism in this book.
One must remember, this is a non-fiction narrative by a woman living in Kenya during the colonization period of Europeans over Africa.
I really wanted to like this.
I thought I’d admire the story of a woman running a farm in Africa all by herself.
I thought it would be full of brave and fascinating adventures and obstacles.
Instead, it’s more about the people she knew, which would have been wonderful if she hadn’t spent her whole time calling the natives primitive and comparing these human beings to animals every second sentence.
I know that it was a different time but this isn’t the only book I’ve read from a different time and it’s certainly in a short list for the most uncomfortably racist.
