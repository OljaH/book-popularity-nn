What a mistake to underestimate the rationality of children while overestimating that of grown-ups!
To a child, the grown-up rules and routines, their ideas and dogmas, seem overwhelmingly crazy.
The pedagogical value of forbidding shoes in a school remains a mystery, both to the young boy about to change schools yet again on the very last page of this account, and to the reader, who also has to bid farewell to the magic of this very special childhood with a father called Essay (S.A.
- how I would love to change my initials!), and a mother called Wild Christian, just to name the closest relatives in Aké.
Soyinka does not live through the war on paper till he is eleven, and there are memories from three to two to an unnamed farther back in his yearly life to first off contemplate and contend.If a child is telling you a story, wouldn't you say that it's best they be both precocious and all too young, offering up tales of strange exploits combined with the most precious of thoughts?
I will admit that the last events (view spoiler)[of a powerful feminist uprising combined with a well grounded criticism of the acts of white people in WWII (hide spoiler)]won my heart in the most biased of ways, but I challenge anyone to not be stirred by those dramatic last pages.Finally, this boy from a young age has a fervent interest in books.
How the bewilderment of a little boy is captured through his grownup self and laid bare on the page.#2 I love thee for thine courage.
1982 and thou dared come forth as a work of nonfiction, during a time when your African peers would have scorned your genre, told thee that thou art a bit full of it, that only true stories of kings, queens, or presidents (if even that) are befitting to be set to books.
#6 I love thine bookish young narrator.
Go figure.#7 I love how after reading thee, I felt the same way I did after reading, Houseboy.
Of course, we soon learn that he was not an ordinary boy: extraordinarily perceptive, curious, and wise beyond his years, Soyinka’s narrator melts into the collective “I” of Ake so completely that at times I forgot he was there–much the same way that, throughout the book and especially in the final chapters, his child self is perpetually observing scenes from rooftops, or through closed doors, and reporting back to the reader what he learned with an objective sense of omniscience.
3.5 StarsIt took me a while to read this book, but I'm glad I did.
This book was charming, but read more like a series of short stories than a real novel.
I guess that's how life is: a collection of our stories and experiences.I loved being in young Wole Soyinka's head.
After reading it, however, I can't help but wonder how Mr. Soyinka could possibly remember all that happened to him as a child in such vivid detail.
Perhaps if a childhood is as eventful as his own, one cannot help but remember the little things.
In a slightly unusual but very well-crafted narrative, he tells the whole story from the perspective of himself as a child (I'm somewhat reminded of Roth's The Plot Against America) which means that as he grows up, the story becomes more intricate, the adult characters more three-dimensional, and his observations more astute; mirroring, in a way, a young country starting to find its footing (Nigeria wouldn't achieve independence until 1960).
As with many childhood stories, it's more of an episodic tale than a straight narrative, which means that it tends to be a little disjointed and slow-paced at times - but even then the fantastically colourful prose makes it worth it.
AKÉ: The Years of Childhood.
In this memoir, he tells of his childhood growing up in the town of Aké, up through his eleventh birthday.
Soyinka, however, has had his childhood etched on his brain.
His earliest memory – as far as I could tell from the book – was from when he was two-and-a-half.
We find that Wole was a bookish young boy, sneaking off early to school at age four to be with his older sister, and taking some of his father’s books with him.
It’s just the diary from memory of a young boy and all the joys and tragedies he endures while doing so.
soyinka has received a nobel prize and many people have praised his semi-autobiographical novel ake, but i struggled to reach its end.
it was slow, choppy, and difficult to connect with any of the characters.
soyinka does a fine job of describing things from a child's eyes, but it is hardly enough to carry the book.
i found myself daydreaming while i read -- there was no connection to the story or its characters.
i read faster as i neared the end, but only to reach the conclusion, not because i was becoming more interested.
This book isn't a classic of African literature- it's a classic, simple! How can one ever forget the memorable and hilarious characters that peopled its pages, characters like Osiki, You-Mean-Mayself and even the author himself, to mention a few.I recommend this book to you. You-Mean-Mayself? Yes, I mean you.
You can read other Nigerian writers---Tutuola, Achebe, Ekwensi, Nzekwu, Amadi---or listen to Nigerian music from Fela, Ebenezer Obey, `King' Sunny Ade, or Olatunji---there's a vast world of Nigerian culture, but until you've read Soyinka, you haven't tasted the real flavor of it.
It's because I believe that the human experience has both particular and universal elements and Soyinka is at his best in describing his childhood days in such a way that both are clearly present.
[The thing that annoyed me tremendously about Jean Paul Sartre's "The Words".] Soyinka comes across as a very honest man.The first few pages are a little bewildering, before you sink into the comfortable flow of humorous, tender, wondering memories.
Wole Soyinka’s autobiography, Ake: the Years of Childhood, tells of a Nigerian boy’s daily life before and during World War II.
This progression is not only because he is growing older, but because he has been given a political foundation from which to actively process and engage with his surroundings.
Soyinka is fascinated by the unrest of the village women regarding taxes and integrates himself in the cause.
Soyinka’s foundation for politics may have been laid by his father, but it is his mother’s feminist activities that seize him.
The evolution presented is one of feminist awakening.To read my paper "Wole Soyinka's Feminist Awakening" please visit: http://writerrhiannon.blogspot.com/20...
I've almost finished teaching "Things Fall Apart" with this year's 10th graders, so that story was still fresh in my mind while I read this memoir by another Nigerian writer.
Whereas Achebe writes about the Igbo people, though, Soyinka is from the western, Yoruba, part of the country.
Also, Achebe's book deals with the time right before colonization really took hold, and "Ake" takes place during World War II; by then, many British customs were entrenched in the schools, government, etc., and at the end of the book people are just starting to discuss independence and nationalism.
Overall, I enjoyed this book, but often the writing felt too dense for the light-hearted stories about Soyinka's early years.
This is super good, Soyinka is a wonderful writer. He has so beautifully conveyed what his life was like as a child, and very cleverly restricted his story to telling only what he knew as a child. The scene where a young Soyinka follows along behind a marching band and gets lost is delightful.

Hmm I love how Wole Soyinka told the story.
He was such a stubborn, inquisitive and adventurous young man and I can’t help but think those were the qualities that made him who he is today.
I watched him on the news two days ago talking about President Buhari and it was amazing because he has always been passionate and vocal even as a child and it’s good to see he still is.
It was a good read.
He seemed like that kid you can’t stand but absolutely love!
I also love that he talked about the historical events that happened as a child.
This was a difficult book to read because of all of the cultural references I didn't understand. I enjoyed the book a lot more after our in-class discussion of it, and I would revisit it again someday.
With World War II as the distant yet pervasive backdrop for this coming of age story, Soyinka introduces a wide cast of characters that somehow manages to stay straight in your mind and never get old.
Another curious factor in this book is the very subtle acknowledgment of colonialism, which really only majorly comes into play in the book's closing.
I'd be curious to learn more about the disposition and politics of the people depicted in the book, and to get some larger context for the work as a whole--but as an independent piece of art, the book succeeds at many levels.
I kept starting this book, and then putting it down to read other things, but I'm really glad I picked it back up and finished it!
I literally laughed out loud at several points throughout the story, but the overall story arc, and especially the ending of the book, was truly inspirational.
His very empowering story of the plight of poor women in Nigeria, and how women from all backgrounds and situations (market traders, farmers, rich and poor women alike) came together to support each other and help themselves and each other, was what really put this book over the top for me.

Soyinke shares with the world memories of his childhood in Ake and later going to school. Raised by an educator, what we would now term as a feminist and a community of well meaning adults allows for him to position and give importance to the characters equally and raise intersecting issues such as social justice, mental illness, class, ethnic differences, colonialism, race relations to name a few. A good read to relatively understand the lives of Africans who grew up on the 40s and 60s as well as why Africa stands where it is now.
Soyinka’s “Ake: The Years of Childhood,” which cover his earliest memories up through approximately age eleven, is no different: he grew up in a world of ancestral religious, social, and cultural practices that mostly coincided easily with, but occasionally butted heads, with the imperial English culture with which it had to share its lebensraum.
To compliment this volume, readers might also be interested in “Isara: A Voyage Around Essay” (1989) which deals with the years directly before the ones in “Ake,” “Ibadan: The Penkelemes Years” (1994) which discusses tracks Soyinka’s life after “Ake” through the time of his arrest and two-year imprisonment, “The Man Died: Prison Notes” (1972) detailing those two horrific years, and most recently “You Must Set Forth at Dawn” (2006), about his experiences from young manhood until publication.
Great tale of child and quest to stand out different
All three combine to make Ake very difficult to read casually and, at times, gorgeously magical - not at all magic realism, more childhood realism, vague, hazy, new, a slowly revealing picture of the world.That means that at times Ake is dense to the point of being a drag, but when realisation shines through Soyinka creates moments of true beauty.
We didn’t just want to sit and let the world go by.
And the young Wole was nothing less than a typical child, but was even of a precocious kind, living under the shades of a religiously conservative mother (Wild Christian) and a disciplined, scholarly and garden obsessed father, SA, a name the boy coalesced as ESSAY.
Are you pregnant like the organist?” How else could mother have responded to her unusually inquisitive child?
Helpful asterisks appear to explain the unfamiliar words, you start to keep track of names and voila, you're halfway through the story, before you know it.
It's simply a story of childhood, charting a child's successes, triumphs and minor catastrophes.
As the story progresses you come to feel as if you know the narrator, his impudence, playfulness and resilience.
Except Wole's story is much more hopeful.
I had never even heard of Wole Soyinka before my obsession with - of all things - Quizup.
Highly recommend Aké, especially if you love lighthearted stories.
Whether it was the reader or the writer is unclear, but when, about half way through the book, Wole Soyinka starts to relate his school experiences, Aké seems to change into a different, much more vivid book.
Strangely, their family too lives its life just like the others, with no apparent inkling of the greatness to come.
As Aké progressed and this reader continued to search for what made the author such a great writer, it began to become clear that the only thing that made this man was experience, something we all share.
It’s life.

Soyinka's narration gets right inside his childish mind, and readers are left to interpret events through those eyes and whatever context we can come up with.
The last 50 pages are Soyinka's astonished witnessing of the Nigerian Women's Movement in which a women's group, originally formed by a few wealthy, educated women who wanted to school young wives in etiquette and cooking, turned into a powerhouse movement when their pupils were prevented from coming to class (which by then extended to literacy) by British tax agents.
I don't generally like stories told from the perspective of young children, but this book was incredible; since it's nonfiction it's not required to be tragic, but it's not all nostalgia either; it is just fun to read, Soyinka comes across a bright, somewhat mischievous child; his parents, "Essay" and "Wild Christian" -- apparently its a cultural norm to refer to close relatives by nicknames -- are very interesting characters.
His father was the headmaster of the local school for young children, and his mother ran a small shop.
The family was part of the Christian elite of Ak��, a small town near Abeokuta in Southwestern Nigeria, somewhat northwest of Lagos.
Ake, is the Nigerian town where Wole grew up a boy.
This is the story of Wole's childhood memories of the town and its people.
Being young and incredibly inquisitive and curious, Wole gets into lots of trouble, both physically and emotionally.
Wole keeps a close watch on the goings-on in his town.
One can infer that life as a boy in Ake shapes Wole's being and essence before he leaves Ake to attend a government school run by white men.
As Wole thinks about his new school he adds, "It was time to commence the mental shifts for admittance to yet another irrational world of adults and their discipline."
