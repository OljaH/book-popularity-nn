I would like to begin my review by saying that the number of plot twists and red herrings in this novel puts The Great Dame of Mystery (I am talking about the one and only Agatha Christie) to shame.
This fairly innocent beginning led to people eating arsenic like candy (some kind soul kept supplying it in their food) and good old-fashioned gun shootings at the survivors.
Rider Haggard.Some people classify Mason mysteries as thrillers.
Finally the book stands a little aside from the previous ones of the series because Mason had to leave comfortable city life and do a lot of field work in a desert.
Non dei migliori della serie. Trama piuttosto aggrovigliata e un paio di passaggi non troppo verosimili.
**1/2.This was one of Gardner’s most convoluted and confusing episodes in his series with Perry Mason.
It all revolved around claims over ‘lost’ gold mines in the California deserts - where were they and to whom did they belong?
In the course of this plot, people who owned or were otherwise involved with the search for these mines were being killed off.
There were even a series of attempted murders involving arsenic – though they didn’t really go anywhere.
I noted that there were TV episodes from the Perry Mason show that featured this adventure.
This was my first Perry Mason book, and I have to say it was quite good. It all came together in the end, and I didn't guess whodunnit, so that is good, and the writing is very good, but there was a lot of stuff about mining and law that I had trouble following and had to check back on. I spent a good deal of time re-reading due to all of the technicalities and twisty turns and stuff, so... overall, a good book, but not NEARLY as quick a read as I expected!
Perry and Della spend time in the desert uncovering the ownership of salted gold mines. Then Perry proposes to Della. She turns him down. No courtroom scenes. Not one of my favorites.
I agree with a number of other readers in finding this plot complex and a bit hard to follow.
Even with my law degree, the legalities of corporate law and fraud one needs to understand to follow this story were burdensome.
I am not sure I ever sorted it all out.Some of the writing is better than usual for Gardner.
And the desert setting is unusual for this series.It's worth a read if you like the series, as I do, but this was a bit of a chore compared to most of the previous "The Case Of's..."
If anyone has doubts that Perry and Della were "involved" romantically, or were moving that way, or should have been involved (!!), the last couple of pages of this book will remove your doubt.
I personally thought this book was brilliant. What this story lacked in court room scenes and banter with Hamilton Burger, it made up for in drama, mystery, and it’s colorful cast of characters.
My Rating System:* couldn't finish, ** wouldn't recommend, *** would recommend, **** would read again, ***** have read again.
Over the last thirty-five years I've read all of the Mason novels at least once, and most several times.
Clarke is ill with a heart condition, and Salty is trying to get him well by having him sleep outside, not inside his nice house where it is too "soft." The plot becomes very complicated quickly with the introduction of a lot of characters: Clarke's mother-in-law and her son, a nurse (for Clarke) and housekeeper, the house-keeper's husband, a doctor, a mining agent, a lawyer.
Frankly, I found it too complicated to really follow.Soon four people are poisoned with arsenic, including Perry and Della!
This is one of the longest, most verbose Perry Mason mysteries that I have read.
The novel written in the 1940s appears to be transitioning from the early Perry Mason mysteries which involved interesting plot twists, court room drama and an amusing repartee between Perry Mason and Della Street, and the other key characters to the more formula driven later Perry Mason mysteries of the 1950s where the characters are thinly sketched and the strength of the plot varies from one book to another.
I think Gardner's own passion for the desert and mining comes through on this one.
The drowsy mosquito is the noise the black light box makes which was used in mining at night to better discern mineral patterns in desert rock.
We meet Lt. Tragg's brother-in-law who is a sheriff out in the desert.
We meet a drunk who uses dual personality to cover his escapades.
Mention is made of WWII and how young girls turn to lesser men because all of the good men are in uniform.
There is also multiple mentions of food rationing, stockpiling food (illegal) and the limits on butter and sugar.
Not your typical perry mason. In fact no courtroom scenes! But all the elements were there - him skating on thin ice , a befuddled sheriff and a perennially dissatisfied Paul Drake!This book is notable for quirky , memorable characters. A very fast read - only 200 pages. More sherlock holmes than Mason , but not complaining because i'm reading after years. Deals with fraud , mining stocks , gun vs poison and several more interesting legal questions within the larger plot. Love Nell Sims!
1943 mystery makes you realize what wonders have been wrought by the cell phone and the Internet; the clue to resolving the mystery was very high tech at the time.Above average entry has interesting, prospector clients and a straight-forward case of skullduggery resolved without Mason's hallmark courtroom heroics.Perry Mason series - The death of his wife leaves Banning Clarke, a former successful prospector turned mining magnate, the prey of a host of human predators, including his calculating mother-in-law, and it is up to Perry Mason to keep things on the up and up
A rollicking good read, very fast, kept me up way past my bedtime. Set during wartime (WWII), as the book's original publication date was 1943, it has some historical oddities, like references to rationing and the lack of young men (because they're all in the military). Lots of legal twists and turns, accompanied by lots of physical ones, a neat hard-boiled (yes, the term is actually used in the book) take on California gold prospecting and the intrigue involved.
I'm a big fan of noir/crime books and whenever I get the chance, I check out an oldie. I collect Perry Mason on DVD. I like the description of the desert in this novel, the relationship between Della Street and Perry Mason, and the standoffish nature of Detective Paul Drake...so unlike the TV series. If you want to know the real Perry Mason and the real Stanley Gardner, read any of the books.
This is a story of a lost gold mine, who actually owns it and of course a murder. This was fun to read because not only does Perry Mason have to defend his client's claim to the mine, he also has to find the mine, and defend his client against a murder charge. How the mosquito fits in, is it's a clue to the time line of the events and the murder.
I was surprised by how much more interesting Perry Mason was than the TV character. The character in the book reminded me of Archie Goodwin (from Nero Wolfe). I really enjoyed the story, the info about prospecting mines in the desert was interesting, and I loved the speeches about the important role of the defense attorney in the justice system. I will definitely be reading more of these.
There is so much of arsenic poisoning that even Mason and Della were not spared. And an annoying mosquito is buzzing in dead of night.The whole story was more like a travel description to desert than a murder case. But the suspense of what is this drowsy mosquito is really interesting, though the whole case was not very prominent till the end of the story.
I had to rate this one down a tad because the plot was a little too convoluted. It makes me want to travel out to see the desert, though, so it has one redeeming quality.

Good who done it.
Good mystery and not confusing.
