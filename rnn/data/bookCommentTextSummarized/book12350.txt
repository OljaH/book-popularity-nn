During these travels he learned that a curse of a person of royal Amber blood really meant something.
This is one of my all-time favorite fantasy series, easily among top 5.
At the time when everybody and their brother rushed to make yet another copy of The Lord of the Rings Zelazny created something very unique and highly imaginative.
I am still fascinated by the concepts of shadow travel and Trumps.
This is still unusual at the time when an average fantasy book can easily reach 1000 pages and have less plot (hi, George R.R. Martin, Robert Jordan, and Steven Erikson).
⚔ Zelazny Freaks Regulars buddy read with my fellow Freaks Regulars Evgeny, Choko, Eilonwy, Elena and Lee ⚔Actual rating: 1.5 stars. Disclaimer:  my copy of this book has obviously been tampered with. Look at the average rating for this delightfully entertaining piece (4.15 stars) and look at my rating (1.5 stars, just to rehash a little bit). See what I mean? It seems crystal-clear to me that the Evil Russians™ have most viciously hacked into my bookshelves once again. It's the only possible wa
That really was brilliantly done, Mr Zelazny.② Lovely Corwin is lovely:Okay, I might have exaggerated a little bit (which is very uncharacteristic of me, I know) in the previous paragraph.
Why is it amazing, or why does Corwin want to be the king?
Oh yes, I didn't give a stinking fish about this book, the plot, or the characters.
Because, really, absolute dullness + all-powerful flatness + the author's Wonderfully Moderate Misogynistic Ways (WMMW™) =➽ Full Oh Bloody Stinking Fish, Zelazny, What Have You Bloody Shrimping Done Now I'm On The Zelaznian Hit List And Stuff Crappy Non Review (OBSFZWHYBSDNIOTZHLASCNR™) to come.["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>
*** 4.44 *** "...“Never trust a relative. It is far worse than trusting strangers.”..." Corwin, the prince of Amber, is free and plotting. Plotting is the past time of the family, but he has a bit of extra incentive, having been imprisoned and blinded for the last 4-5 years and living is squalor while getting better after his escape. Eric, his eldest brother and currently holder of the throne, wants him dead, but at this moment he and the whole royal family are busy defending the realm and some
Eric, his eldest brother and currently holder of the throne, wants him dead, but at this moment he and the whole royal family are busy defending the realm and some of the Shadow Worlds against the forces of Chaos, who are currently attacking with unprecedented strength and tenacity.
Corwin picks up an old frenemy on his way and they travel the Shadows together, trying to keep alive, being attracted to anything in skirts, playing folks for fools and being played themselves, hoping that the math would eventually work in his favor.
His search for vengeance and restoration takes him on a journey through the Shadows that at last brings him to his former homeworld of Avalon, and makes him cross paths with a former servant who hates him with a burning passion and a brother thought long lost.The Guns of Avalon is in many aspects a massive improvement on Nine Princes in Amber.
Zelazny apparently learnt how to write, and while the book retains some of the issues that plagued the first book, that certainly makes it far better.
But there are mysteries enough hidden in Amber and its Shadows that I am determined to keep reading.
This was the first volume of this series I read. The Amber series...one of fantasy's best. I stumbled on this not knowing it was a series. Then It was years before I found the first volume (Nine Princes in Amber. Also, this book ends in a somewhat cliffhangerish way and it was years before I got the next volume...Happily for you, the entire series is there waiting for you. Enjoy.
Picks up right where the first novel ended and is just as fast moving. You learn a lot more about Amber, and Corwin's family
Dropping it halfway through - not my cup of tea. I enjoyed the first book of the series, Nine Princes in Amber, in a lukewarm sort of way, and decided to try this in case the story picked up speed. Around page 100 or So, I decided I couldn't care less.Still, it's not badly written - hence the two stars.
Want to know what's EVEN MORE random?The wounded guy Corwin meets is Lancelot.An infinite number of worlds, and our protagoninst just stumbles upon the Round Table replica.MEH.From then on it only gets worse: goatlike demons sprouting out of nowhere, demonic cats, a 2 pages long relationship with a ""camp follower"" and on and on and on...The more I read of it, the more Zelazny's prose feels like an army of tiny inky talons raking at my eyes with every word.He doesn't show, he doesn't tell: he just lists facts.In a single page I counted a dozen sentences starting with "then".Then I went there.Then I did this.Then I did that.Then (insert random demonic being) came.Then we fought.Then he died.Then I went away.Dialogues would be even worse if not for one reason: they're faster to read.Characters reactions are completely fucked up, and there isn't one that makes sense in the entire book.To make the whole thing even more unbearable, everyone speaks 70s American slang.I'm afraid this is the last I'll see of the Chronicles of Amber and I'm seriously regretting buying the omnibus.
"Now I had to find a place, a place resembling another place -- one which no longer existed.
This book has a lot of action and a pretty clear arc.
The positives of this book is the ambiguity of the characters.
Even the focal point of the book (Prince Corwin) is an ambiguous character.
At times, the reader feels he isn't much better than half of his siblings.
And now, he has to deal with the mess he made.Again, like the first in this series, this isn't GREAT literature but it is entertaining enough and does have a compelling narrative drive to it.
My rating 4.9By me, even a better book than the first part. A sequel that just shows how good a series is. Soon I started reading the third book. Just a great book. A book to be read because if you are a fan of science fiction and fantasy genres, this is the very essence of the genre.
4.0 to 4.5 stars. Another excellent installment in the Amber Chronicles by Roger Zelazny. The world building continues to impress and the magic system and internal workings of Amber continue to be fleshed out and made real. While not quite as good as my two favorite Zelazny works, Lord of Light and This Immortal, these books are well written and a ton of fun. Highly Recommended!!
Traditional firearms don’t work in Amber, but Corwin once noticed that a jewelers’ rouge from the shadow world of Avalon, where he used to rule, is combustible in Amber.
Along the way Corwin meets old friends and enemies, makes new friends and enemies, and does at least one more impetuous thing that will come back to bite him later.In The Guns of Avalon (1972), Corwin, who had gained our sympathies in Nine Princes in Amber because of how he was treated by Eric, becomes something of an anti-hero.
And with the Amber series you were almost always ensured of an entertaining read, with the right dash of complexity so that along with the amusement and intrigue, it also gave the old noggin just enough to chew on.
In this sequel of world hopping fantasy, Prince Corwin prepares to take his rightful throne.
Any reader of fantasy is in for an escapist treat of the highest magnitude.
I'm biased here, it may have dated, but my love of reading it a few decades ago has stayed with me.
It's still a ripper read, at least that's what I think.
Even better and more excitng than "The Nine Princes in Amber." Corwin continues his adventures through time and space and gets involved in a complicated political struggle for Amber. Plus Zelazny details more of the back story involving the Courts of Chaos and make up of various realms of the series. Outstandng science fiction fantasy written in concise and beautiful language. Zelazny is an amazing writer.
The second book in the series is pretty much like turning a page in the first book.
It is literally like the next day.
But even with its flaws, even with the fact that a few most of my group read buddies have given up on it, I find that I do want to see how the story pans out.
So given that I have the omnibus and they are only 150 max pages per book, I will be carrying on with the story.I know this review doesn't exactly tell you much about the book, but, ah well.
While still compelling, it is a little bit of a let down from the first book. The noir element is lost entirely, sci-fi is minimal and this become merely a fun fantasy story. That's fine, I guess. The writing is actually still quite good, but I felt some of what made the first book special is now stripped away. That doesn't stop me from wanting to know what happens. This series may feature the most screwed up families in literature. Still good pulpy stuff.
Another fine installment of The Chronicles of Amber. This one lulled for me a bit in the middle, but the ending picked up quite a bit and Zelazny's masterful worldbuilding brought my rating back up.
I'll start this today at lunch.
It's a re-read, but a wonderful one.
I read Nine Princes in Amber for the Zelazny group & I can't just stop reading the series now, even if I do know how it turns out.It was well worth the re-read.
Even knowing basically what happens, it's still a great read.
Can't wait to start the next book, Sign of the Unicorn.
If this is your first time reading this series, I'd highly suggest reading Nine Princes in Amber before this book.
The series really should be read in order.
The four Princesses of Amber are also involved in the conflict in various ways.The Chronicles are a culmination of 10 small novels that make up the world of Amber into one big book of over 1200 pages, the first 5 books revolve around the protagonist Corwin, who is a prince of Amber and are told in first person from Corwin's point of view.
It was a perfect choice for my mood- quick, fairly short, and lots of adventure.The Guns of Avalon picks up where Nine Princes in Amber left off.
While there, he must help fight the creatures of the Circle of Evil, a part of the Dark Road to Chaos that he unleashed on the world, both Amber and Shadow, by his curse.Once again, Corwin doesn’t know who to trust and how far to trust them.
This time around, Corwin knows who he is, what he’s fighting for, so we can get straight to it.
We don’t need any explanation of the importance of Amber and that the royal family can travel through Shadow.
More of the first volume, without the cumbersome amnesia device.
Expressly Arthurian, but with guns.
Travel sections wrtten with heavy ellipsis in the style of Celine.
Great passage during the picaresque section regarding how "Half a dozen hairy, albino men, almost completely naked and continuing the process of undressing as they moved, shuffled about, muttering and chuckling, poking at the woman and the fire with sticks that they carried and clutching at their loins repeatedly" (163).
Very srancy.Puts paid to the antagonist of volume I, while focusing on the attempt to undo the narrator's counterstroke against the antagonist in the first installment.
The 2nd book in Zelazny's Amber series picks up Corwin's story just about where Nine Princes in Amber left off. We visit some Shadows (alternate worlds), find Corwin is the Archetype of whom both King Arthur & Charlemagne are shadows, and we get back to another assault on Amber to settle the succession (or is it regency?)
2.5 stars, same as the first book. I don't feel like I know enough about the characters or the world to fully appreciate it. Already 75% of the way through the third one and that's getting remedied slightly.
a very very small part of the book made me drift of but other then that it is just as good as the first.
Now even Humphrey Bogart – who, let’s face it, quite often played Zelaznyesque characters – liked to slap his dames around too, but this really is jarring, I think, for Zelazny, and it doesn’t show Corwin in a very favorable light, either.
In part I think it’s because she begins to instill the motif of guilt, in parallel to the advancement of the dark Circle.I’ll allow Zelazny this much slack: at least the Dara we see in The Guns of Avalon is smart, attractive, and strong.
Lorraine’s then handily eliminated by the author in order to clear the way for Dara.In Nine Princes Corwin scarcely had time to think.
Man šķiet, ka autors sarakstīja visas 10 grāmatas un tikai tad izlaida pa vienai laukā, jo katras grāmatas biegas ir jaunas grāmatas nenovēršams sākums.Kas attiecas uz saturu - citi nespēj tik daudz spriedzes un pavērsienu ielikt 500 lpp, cik Žeļeznijs iemet nieka 200.
I'm unsure about this series.
It bores me a lot at times with it's random events.
It might be Corwin's character.
However, a whole series cannot rest on the shoulders of one character's likability.
I might also dislike this series because of the audiobook narrator.
He's not that good and really annoys me at time.
Maybe reading it would have given me a better experience.
Anyway, I don't really know whether I want to continue.
Do I want to spend time reading/listening to another of those books?
So many books out there, so little time.Good bye Corwin.
I really love the ideas of this vintage fantasy series. The best part about this series is the interesting ideas of alternate travel and the most-excellent main character. Corwin makes me think of Jorg in King of Thorns in some ways. The family interactions seem echoed in Idlewild, with their varied approaches to situations and each other. I love the travel through shadow and ideas of each shadow being slightly different and some objects working or not in each shadow. It seems similar to the idea of alternate realities. I definitely recommend this series.
Nonäe, otsustasin ikkagi sellelegi viis tärni anda, ma ei teagi enam, miks ma arvasin, et see mulle kõige vähem meeldis, kui mäletan igasuguseid põnevaid asju. Vist Bleysi plaanid? Lõpp? Kes teab.Igatahes meenus täna - mis mind üldse siia tõi - kuidas ma umbes 12-aastasena ühel kostüümipeol Corwin olin. Leidsin oma pitskaeluse ja -käistega särgi, printsibareti ja musta mantli. Vanaema oli ka täiesti poolt, et ma prints tahtsin olla, tema mulle vajaliku varustuse õmbleski. Olin enesega väga rahul :) Ja ega praegugi on printsi/võluri mantlis päris mugav.
Žanra klasika. Piedzīvojumu un ugunskuru laiks. :)
