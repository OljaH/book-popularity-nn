And she tied that to the devastating story of how it ended along with the tale of Jimmy (Snowman), his mad scientist friend Crake, and the woman they both loved, Oryx.The Year of the Flood centers around two women, Ren and Toby, through the course of their lives before, during and after the disaster that occurs in O&C.
Adam One preaches about the Waterless Flood, a disaster that will pay back humankind for all the injustices done to the animal kingdom, and those who have read Oryx & Crake know that Reckonin’ Day is coming.Ren is eventually returned to the corporate compound life, but never forgets her time with GG or her best friend, Amanda.
It's more like a completely different story about the same event.
There is hardly any character crossover and absolutely zero information in Oryx and Crake that you need to love/enjoy/understand The Year of the Flood.I love that this story just dumps me off in the future.
It made for a sort of culture shock that gave me a nice distance from this harsh new world.I've grown fearful of reading Margaret Atwood over the past few years.
I adore her writing but the characters can be so awful to each other and the stories can be painful and depressing.
I actually like human beings and I truly believe we're made to be good.
Though I agree with her in spirit, I am prone to try and win an argument for the sake of it (bad habit?), and always retort with something along the lines of "yes, let us follow that logic to its conclusion: there is only one, most saddest little person who has it the worst of all in the whole wide world throughout all of time, and only he or she is deserving of coming face-to-face with his or her reality, and finding it regrettable and sadness-worthy." This is, of course, not what she meant, but the conversation (which we have had a zillion times over the years, and which always concludes with two sets of hands in the air) always leaves me thinking about what that actual, worst-case-scenario could be.
Although I share Atwood’s concern about most of the problem sources she identifies, the book did at times feel a bit like a laundry list of the sins of the 20th and 21st centuries.
I felt that the amount of time dedicated to her characters’ youth made it feel at times like a YA novel.Her focus is on a group known as the Gardeners a green organization dedicated to preparing for the coming “flood” by returning to as natural a state as possible, recycling wherever possible, growing their own food, minimizing their impact on the environment.
Now I feel like there is nothing subtle about these references, they are so glaringly obvious, for example not only Ren but Amanda too dates Jimmy at some point in her life.
If we look at the plethora of new characters as cameras giving us a different angle view of an event from the last book, then I wonder why the book chooses to show us the same scenes instead of delving into all the aspects Jimmy's pov ignored.
This minor qualm aside, the book is brilliant, it takes you out of the compound and shows you different parts of the world created by Atwood.
The story revolves around two women/girls named Toby and Ren who at bisecting points spend time under the protective wing of The God's Gardners.
Toby escaped from the drudgery work of a Secretburger outlet where the manager, Blanco, demands degrading acts of sexual gratification for her continued employment.
He survives not only one, but several campaigns into the arena and when not creating mayhem for other people he continues to hunt for Toby.
The world unravels when Crake releases the Blysspluss pill that is advertised as the greatest sexual experience of your life.
The story moves back and forth in time (before and after "The Flood"), describing the lives of the women as they move about, and how they eventually come back together after "The Flood" mentioned in the title of the book.Atwood's creation of the "Gardeners" is so fascinating - she has gathered the cult's doctrine and principles from 19th-century transcendentalism, Jain and Hindu philosophies, post-modern environmental thought, the zeal of 1970's "born-again" Christianity with a tad of Hare Krishna devotion, the apocalyptic asceticism of the Essenes, as well as the homesteading, return-to-the-land movement of post-Industrial North America.
So much imagination went into that particular novel that all stories parallel to Snowman’s should have the equal right to be told.In "O & C," the two strands of plot which interweave involve Jimmy/ Snowman.
I will venture to say, however, that the endless appeal to these both, other than pertaining to an amazing trilogy which continues what began in Oryx and Crake and is further explored in The Year of the Flood, is the embedded wit inside the horror story.
This was my first experience of Margaret Atwood and I’m afraid I don’t really get what all the fuss is about.
It’s one of those novels that plays catch up – starts at year twenty-five, then goes back to year zero and works its way forward.
The satire seemed to me suffocating so that everything else in the novel, especially the characters, had to play second fiddle to the fusillade of very predictable jibes at contemporary culture.
I’m afraid I won’t be in any great hurry to read another Margaret Atwood novel.
On the Kindle it's just sort of forge ahead.)I did love how in this book, the men are seen mostly as romantic interludes from the POV of the women, the women characters are truly kickass (TOBY), everyone was a lot more keen and clear-eyed than poor Jimmy (a low bar, there) -- altho the constant sort of low-pitched humming (that's how it affected me, like a weird sonic frequency) of sexual assault buzzing through the storyline made me uncomfortable, it was hard to relax into the story.
I'm pretty sure that the entire concept of reading was invented so that I could consume Margaret Atwood.
She is my first and always most favorite of all time ever and I love her so much I don't even know.
I seriously could not read this book fast enough.
And now I want to read MaddAddam so so so so badly I might burst, but the entire internet only has one proof for sale, and it's like $40 and in goddamn Australia or something so I don't know what to do.
Weep maybe?
Maybe I'll just re-read Oryx and Crake.
Ren's sections are mostly recounted in the first person and Toby's in the first.Eco Survival etcAlthough it jumps around timewise, the first part of the book has plenty of positive aspects (and some vague angst), whereas the later sections are unrelenting accounts of the lengths (and depths) people will go to in order to survive, even when they are unsure if it is worth it: "This thing I'm doing can hardly be called living, Instead I'm lying dormant, like a bacterium in a glacier.
This second in the series drops us in the arms of the cult called God's Gardeners, and this is where we spend most of our time.
God's Gardeners were introduced in the first book, and here we get to know the various Adams and Eves (Adam One is the leader, Adam Two and Three are his seconds, etc...
The guy who wrote the musical score for the hymns in this book is no Handel, believe me.
The quality of that melody is ten times better than the God's Gardeners Hymns.When I read that Margaret Atwood wrote these hymns herself, my respect level for her initially plummeted.
While the book is inferior to its predecessor IMO, it is still a remarkable work of speculative fiction.Set at approximately the same time as Oryx and Crake,The Year of the Flood follows the fates of two female survivors of the Waterless Flood - an epidemic orchestrated by Crake.
Just like in Oryx and Crake, Atwood takes us through the life stories of her characters, constantly switching from one perspective to another, from past to present, gradually revealing the events that have led to the Flood.
The characters' live stories are intertwined in a very intricate way.What makes this companion inferior to its predecessor is probably the familiarity of the world and the events.
Στο συγκεκριμένο βιβλίο βλέπουμε ότι τα πράγματα δεν είναι ακριβώς έτσι: αφηγήτριες είναι η Τόμπι και η Ρεν που πέρασαν μεγάλο μέρος της ζωής τους στους Κηπουρούς, μια New Age σέχτα θρησκόληπτων που αγαπούσαν τη φύση, δεν έτρωγαν οτιδήποτε είχε πρόσωπο, παρά μονάχα σε μεγάλη ανάγκη επιβίωσης (γιατί τα ζώα έχουν ψυχή), δόξαζαν το Θεό για το δημιούργημά του, έβρισκαν γιατρικά από τη φύση και ετοιμάζονταν ψυχή τε και σώματι για την Άνυδρη Πλημμύρα, την τιμωρία του Θεού προς τον άνθρωπο για την κατάντια του.

this book is a brutally honest look at an apocalypse that feels very real and not so far into the future.
It's of the water-less flood and it follows a group of people who call themselves the Gardner's.
It mainly follows two women: Toby and Ren in alternating POV's.
There were so many thought-provoking topics and passages in this book regarding society, humanity, our future, religion, veganism, and so much more.
This book just truly reminds us how much we take the world for granted and this book shows us the scary potential outcome from our careless behaviors.
True, I did think this book was better than the first - there are more characters in Flood than in Oryx, and this leads, in my opinion, to a greater depth to the story.
But some of this depth wouldn't be as deep, without the first book.Anyway, the biggest problem with the so-called MaddAddam trilogy is that the third book has not yet been written by Ms. Atwood!
What am was I supposed to do, read some other book by her?
(If so, it might work, in my case.)Well, by now the last book in the trilogy, Maddaddam, has been published, and read by me.
I actually liked this better than its counterpart, Oryx and Crake (but you must read both, no matter what), and I think it's because this book focuses on two female protagonists this time, instead of Jimmy - Atwood is a genius, but she just doesn't write male characters well.
That was probably the best part about the book for me - questions that didn't get answered in Oryx and Crake (like just how long Crake was working on his whole wipe-out-humanity plan) get answered, and characters who were merely background get full stories here.
It is a parallel narrative to Oryx and Crake, set in the Pleeblands rather than the Compounds.
The group is attacked violently which leads to a split, the more militant wing breaks away, and shortly after that the global disaster strikes: a sudden eruption of a virus that dissolves humans from the inside.
The two main narrative focusses, Ren and Toby are brilliantly evoked and my interest was held by my desire to follow their fates.
The only odd thing was how this relatively small group of people kept on meeting up again, even after they had broken away from the original community.
Here's Atwood at her best - presenting us with with the stories of survivors, be it a heartbreak or the end of the world or a starvation and violence.
It's like you watch the movie with many disturbing details with your friend, but he's already seen it for a couple of times, so he's not cringing unlike you are and he's encouraging you not to close your eyes, because otherwise you'll miss the whole point.
So I watched that movie.
But I did enjoy the book, which was seemingly slow in the beginning, but it's the case with all of Atwood's books.
If you haven't read Oryx and Crake, there's still an interesting version of future society here (this book takes place in the Pleebs, unlike most of O&C), but you will probably be confused.The thing that bothered me the most about this book is that I don't understand why Ms. Atwood wanted to write it.
That's fine with me because I really enjoyed O&C (and her writing in general), but I don't think this book added much to her future world.
I guess the bottom line is, if you're a Margart Atwood fan and you've read Oryx and Crake, you will probably like this new book too.
I re-read The Handmaid’s Tale for about the eleventh time that summer, and quickly devoured the two aforementioned novels for academic appropriation, and then moved on to Cat’s Eye, Oryx and Crake, Bluebeard’s Egg (short stories), some poetry (Selected Poems and Morning in the Burned House), and, most recently, Alias Grace, which I had the wonderful opportunity to teach in an honors seminar I was TA-ing for.
The so-called Waterless Flood has barely registered in the novel yet; we're still getting to know everyone, we're still delving into the past and the fraught emotions of living in a world that moves a bit too fast...it's beautifully done, surprising, and very tender in ways that O&C was not (again, though, I love O&C, just for different reasons).
The Year of the Flood is more about society’s impact on individuals.
We learn about the year of the flood and what led up to it from two particular women, Toby and Ren, and at the same time, we discover how these events made them who they are.
And the hymns:My body is my earthly ArkIt’s proof against the Flood;It holds all creatures in its heart,And knows that they are goodThe story itself alternates between horror and suspense and fun and sarcasm.
Die Mitte hätte um 150 Seiten gekürzt werde können, deswegen Abzüge im der B-Note, aber ansonsten eine interessante Geschichte mit intelligent aufgebauten Handlungssträngen. Erst in der Mitte habe ich verstanden, das es hier um 2 Protagonistinnen geht anstatt um eine. Ab da wirkte das Storytelling auch nicht mehr so sprunghaft 😂 zum Ende hin verschmilzt Buch 1&2 und nun bin ich gespannt auf Teil 3 🙌🏻
Disappointing to me for its wooden characters, sluggish pace, pedestrian prose, , and ineffective conveyance of the tragedy of an apocalyptic plague.
The premise of a privatization of police, then government, and a biotechnology industry gone awry to the point of danger was rendered as a fairly interesting foundation for the dystopia portrayed.
The idea of a green religion based on ecology, with a Saint Rachel Carson and Euell Gibbons, and illustration of the role such a group might play in surviving a collapse of industrialized society were the most redeeming aspects of the book.
This is what I call a slogger, one of those books I slowly slog through, rather like mud or jello.
Don't ask me to explain too much but it's an image I often use.
Some sloggers are rewarding.
For those I must be in the right frame of mind.
Some sloggers I give up on, usually out of boredom.
This book fell squarely in the middle.
I think I'll continue this is the group thread...Recommended for lovers of Atwood's writing (which I happily count myself among) or lovers of apocalyptic fiction who are more concerned with the path towards destruction than the aftermath.
I have always loved Margaret Atwood.
I haven't read a single book of hers before this that I didn't love.
But I am finding that The Year of the Flood is both tedious and twee --- as though constant tongue-in-cheek references to today's culture run amok are enough to carry the theme.
They are not.I chalk the multiple positive ratings it has garnered up to the fact that, hey, this is Margaret Atwood we're critiquing here.
Well, it appears even Margaret can phone one in.Unless things change for the better quickly, I'm shelving this as *unfinished* and getting on with my next book on CD.
Two of Oryx and Crake's protagonists make cameo appearances here but The Year of the Flood is not about them.The story is told mainly from two female protagonists' point of view Toby and Ren (yes, Toby is a lady), with the occasional chapters told as announcements by a cult reader called Adam One, always followed with a hymn from "God's Gardeners Oral Hymnbook"Civilization is already in decline at the beginning of The Year of the Flood, with corporations running the country* instead of the government.
This one focuses more on the religion of a group called The Gardeners, who are planning for the waterless flood."Nothing wrecks your nails like a lethal pandemic plague."10/13 - Re-reading the trilogy since we're going to discuss Oryx and Crake on SFF Audio.
There are no good rules." (66) <-- this doesn't have anything to do with spoilers but I liked it"Confronted by too much emptiness, said Adam One, the brain invents.
Asking questions about the Gardeners and the Waterless Flood."One day, he said that what you had to do in any adversarial situation was to kill the king, as in chess.
