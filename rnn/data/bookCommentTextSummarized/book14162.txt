I understand why they are in this collection, but that doesn't mean I have to like them.
There are two short stories that I read over and over. The Mist has always been a favorite, and I can't believe how many people haven't read Survivor Type! It's awesome!I've lost three copies of this from lending it out. Don't ask--you can't borrow it! ;o)
Skeleton Crew is my least favorite Stephen King story collection.
The six stories I loved are probably some of my favorite Stephen King stories but the rest were just blah!
The Good: 1)The Raft is my favorite story in this collection.
3)The Reapers Image is one of King's best stories period.
5)Uncle Otto's Truck, Stephen King loves a haunted car and I think this story is best of all of his haunted car stories.
6) Gramma I've heard or read this story before but I can't remember where.
Skeleton Crew is a good collection but with Stephen King I've come to expect greatness.
Read for Popsugar's 2018 Reading Challenge: A book with a weather element in the title (I'm counting The Mist for this one, since that stands on its own as a book as well!My favorite stories: -The Mist-Cain Rose Up-Survivor Type-Morning Deliveries (Milkman #1)-The Ballad of the Flexible BulletI highly recommend those five stories, but the rest I either feel neutral towards or I actively didn’t enjoy listening to them.
Hall’s two stories were also highlights (Ballad[...] and Beachworld) because I LOVE HIM.
Audiobook was definitely a good route because it would have taken me FOREVER to slog through the stories I didn’t like.
However, the five stories that I mentioned above were SO GOOD so they made the experience worth it.
I can definitely see myself re-reading any of those stories in the future!
I thought I’d just highlight a few of my favorites:The Mist - It’s by far the longest “short story” in the collection.
This scary good story may be the reason I never owned one myself.The Raft - The title alone sets your mind to wondering.
The shock value counts for a lot here, and I wonder, “Would I like the story even more with a character I cared for, or less?”The Ballad of the Flexible Bullet - Again, what a great title.
It’s the Crew’s second longest story.
Saved by a great finale.King includes a nice afterward, at least in the 1985 HC edition, in what he calls such things that might interest the casual reader.
Revisiting Skeleton Crew, Stephen King's collection of twenty-two short stories published in 1985, for the first time since I was in 7th grade -- a time when I was trying to dress like Don Johnson and get Madonna's "Into the Groove" out of my head -- was a wonderful experience.
The horror stories I loved as a 12-year-old were each better than I remember.
Not terribly suspenseful, more of a gross-out story, but the lengths King goes to describe how a rogue doctor ended up marooned with surgical equipment and heroin is imaginative as hell.
Some stories were awesome and some not so much but none were terrible.I reread some of these and finished the book.
my favorite 2 were the mist and GRAMMA.
I didn't listen to the whole story so it may have been great but spacey stuff just isn't my thing.
Dylan Baker reading the milkman stories was FANTASTIC!!
Because of his stellar performance, I'm putting them in #2 spot for favorite audio..story.
Kate Mulgrew reading NOS4A2 is #1.
I think everyone should pick this book up if only to read The Mist and Gramma and the audiobook for Dylan Baker's reading.
That's my problem with a lot of his output from this decade — excess verbosity.After the reliably folksy, mood-setting introduction to this collection from Sai King himself, things get rolling with "The Mist," the first (but not last) story in Skeleton Crew about ordinary people stranded and facing likely death, due to out-of-this-world circumstances.
"Mrs. Todd's Shortcut"It takes place in Castle Rock, home of several King novels and short stories.P. 182 - Joe Camber of Cujo is mentioned.P. 186 - Haven gets a shout out!"The Man Who Would Not Shake Hands"This one could be could be seen as a spiritual successor to "The Breathing Method," even going so far as to reference that earlier novella.
While this definitely isn’t my favourite collection of King short stories, it does have some gems that I really loved. My favourite by far were Nona, The Mist and The Monkey. Something about each of those three stories really got to me and sunk their claws deep into me. The rest of the stories were quite enjoyable as well but they just didn’t leave me with the same delicious feeling of unease as the three stories I mentioned above.
I am noticing that I like his more modern tales greater than his 80s and 90s huge output.So here is a short story collection from that time.
There were some hits, but there were also some misses.The great tales here were:- 'The Mist' as post-apocalyptic Cthulhu tale that is very suspenseful, but a little dated now.
But still a good deal of fun.'The Monkey' which I am sure has kind of entered into horror as a classic.
Very clever.'Uncle Otto's Truck' mirrors 'The Monkey' and even "Christine' which I have not read yet.'Gramma' is great and haunting.
Especially 'The Jaunt' which seems to be Stephen's attempt at traditional SF short story writing.

After finishing this I must confess that: it was quite cathartic.One of those of books you need to put down for a second when you finish a chapter just to think about what you've just read.
Granted, they’re both works from Stephen King, but I’ll take my little victories however I can get them.Sandwiched between The Talisman and It, Skeleton Crew was King’s lone release in 1985 and his second short story collection.
Similar to his prior collection, Night Shift, Skeleton Crew is mostly previously published work with only a handful of original contributions.A few of my favorites:The Mist, obviously.
Several of these stories were written before Night Shift and were likely left out of the collection, which had me thinking they weren’t quite as strong.Outside of Mr. Mercedes, I’ve yet to be truly disappointed by a King release, so even his more average ones are enjoyable reads.
Now, nearly thirty years later, I am rereading all of King's books mostly in chronological order, attempting to recapture the ecstasy I felt upon reading them initially.To my delight, Skeleton Crew has withstood the effects of the passage of time, held up impressively, in fact.This collection of stories, most of which were written when King was becoming a household name, and horror icon, contains some of his most chilling tales he ever put down on paper.The Mist, The Monkey, Mrs. Todd's Shortcut, The Raft, Nona, Survivor Type, Uncle Otto's Truck, Gramma, and The Ballad of the Flexible Bullet are all brilliant examples of the author's masterful execution of the short form.
Highly recommended for fans of King, or lovers of short stories in general.
Comprato per Nebbia, dopo che ho visto a pezzi, il film the Mist. E' la prima storia e non è male visto che non ricordo nemmeno come finisce il film.Le storie non sono male. Direi che merita il massimo. Il Re è il Re.
A collection of short stories. I actually think some of King's best work is done in the short form.
Από τις πολύ δυνατές συλλογές διηγημάτων του Κίνγκ, με κυριότερο όπλο της την ποικιλία. Δύσκολο να σας αρέσουν όλα τα διηγήματα, αλλά πολύ πιθανό να το πείτε για τα περισσότερα, πάντοτε ανάλογα με τα γούστα του καθενός.
Overall, a great collection of short stories by the King.
But it is some of the less talked about stories in this collection that shined for me.
Special mention also to The Man Who Would Not Shake Hands for what is a fantastic final image and the creeping dread of Gramma.With a total of 22 stories in this collection, there was always going to be fat and I can't imagine anyone giving much of a shout out to Here There Be Tygers or Cain Rose Up.Certainly a great collection of stories that will appeal to a far broader audience than Stephen King dies hards and that continues to demonstrate that, even though he is a writer often accused of overwriting, he can still very much master the short form.
It has been a while since I read this collection, but some stories (not the ones usually cited by reviewers) really frightened me.1.
Here There Be Tygers - We all know that the tiger lurking just beyond the bend in the L-shaped bathroom is only a childhood fantasy.
Your parents pooh-pooh your fears, but you know that they are out to get you...3.
Well, this story tells you why it may not be so enjoyable.5.
Beachworld - A planet which is one big beach.
But it's not one big holiday out there...6.

The Mist; The Jaunt; The Raft; and going for the gross out ... Survivor Type (love it!)
The collection actually starts off with a novella, The Mist, that I used an excerpt from during high school for a competitive forensics dramatic reading that I scored very well with throughout the season and received the highest marks available at the state tournament.Some of my favorites from the collection include: The Mist (most people hated the film, I didn't think that it was really THAT bad), The Monkey (one of King's creepiest short stories), The Raft, and Gramma (also my favorite episode from the attempted revival of The Twilight Zone.)Overall, Skeleton Crew is a very solid collection of creepy tales and I thoroughly enjoyed it the second time around.
A collection of stories that starts with the novella "The Mist." There are a couple of fantastic stories with the rest being good.
This is King's second short story collection, but I enjoyed his first, "Night Shift", the best.1.The Mist -I reviewed this where it originally appeared in the anthology "Dark Forces".
The Reaper's Image - A creepy story of a supernatural mirror.
The story slowly unwinds finally giving up the mirror's power at the end.
Gramma - One of the best stories in this collection and probably my favourite.
A good choice for a final story.
This isn't my favourite collection of King's short stories, but there were a couple of cracking tales in there which really lifted the whole anthology.The dark and twisted 'Survivor Type' is a huge stand out.
I can only hope to never have my mettle tested so far.The Mist is a great read and that came as a surprise.
The Jaunt is such a good example of a short story and Stephen King really excels in this genre.
He called it 'spoon torture of the heathen chinee.' Now, 20-odd years later, I guess I found out what he had been reading.
Probably more like 3.5/5 overall as a group of stories for me. I would give The Mist, The Raft and Gramma 5/5 with the rest all more like 3/5. Worth the read for sure for those three alone.

A retki su oni koji mogu da ga savladaju.) Kao i sa svakom zbirkom priča, neke priče vam više legnu, neke manje, neke vas oduvaju, a neke ostave zamišljenim nad knjigom minutima, satima...
Ono što je specifično za zbirku priča "Gole kosti" je da, pored svega spomenutog, mnoge priče vam nateraju svaku dlačicu na telu da se nakostreši.
I to je ono što čini Kinga tako posebnim i meni lično dragim piscem.Ne znam koju bih priču posebno izdvojio od dvadeset i dve, koliko ih ima u zbirci.
Review I'm not generally a fan of short stories, but I am a big fan of Stephen King. I've read two collections by him prior to this one: Hearts in Atlantis and Different Seasons. I thought both of them were stronger collections. The main difference is those contain fewer, but longer stories I think.This one has been on my radar for a long time, in particular because of The Mist, which is the first (and longest) story. It's actually a Novella, where the rest are short stories. It's supposed to h
So if like me, you're wanting to read all the associated works, I personally think you can skip this one without much issue.There are 3 stories worth calling out for this collection of 22 (although calling 2 of them stories is overly generous).
This book has 13 unique narrators, some of them reading several stories.
"A short story is a different thing all together - a short story is like a kiss in the dark from a stranger." -- from the Introduction to Skeleton CrewIt had been a while since I revisited King's short story collections, and for the most part, I wasn't disappointed.
Some people think this story goes on a little too long, but for me, it's one of King's more memorable short fiction works.
IMHO, "The Raft" is the best-written story of the collection - you *know* what it's like to be out on that raft, chilled to the bone and afraid...
Recommended to fans of the short story, whether you're new to Stephen King's works or not.
The stories in this book are either hit or miss, but most of them are pretty cool. It’s definitely a better anthology than Night Shift. The stories I enjoyed the most are…The MistCain Rose UpThe JauntThe Reaper’s ImageNonaGramma..However, I would have to say that the best stories in here are The Mist, The Reaper’s Image and Gramma. Stephen King is a master craftsman of the short story. Other anthologies of his I plan to read are:Just After Sunset,Four Past Midnight, Everything's Eventual: 14 Dark Tales and Nightmares and Dreamscapes.
