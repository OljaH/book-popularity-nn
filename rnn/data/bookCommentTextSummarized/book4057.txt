Ernest Hemingway was a unique character and it is interesting to note that among all of his accomplishments he was the proud editor of “MEN AT WAR: The Best War Stories of All Time”, a smorgasbord of 82 prominent short historical war stories from around the world from the Biblical days of David and Goliath to Pear Harbor and World War II tales prior to the book publication date of 1942.
No après la guerre for them – bon soir, toodle-oo, good-byeeee.It’s interesting to note how the chronicles of war have evolved through the ages and if the book was published today, certainly one could also include stories of women into the mix.
One of the greatest collections of short stories EVER. I often go back and read a story or two in it.
I loved this book! It has many different writers and diaries about real war stories. This is a must read for students and those who like history. http://www.amazon.com/First-Edition-E...
