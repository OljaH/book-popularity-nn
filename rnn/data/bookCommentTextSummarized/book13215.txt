Darkness Visible: When the Question is Whether Life is Worth Living     William Styron, (June 11, 1925 – November 1, 2006)       "Dying is easy. Comedy is hard.--Edmund Kean, (4 November 1787 – 15 May 1833), celebrated Shakespearean actor     Preamble-January 18, 2015It is 1:20am cst. My thoughts swirl over the important content of Styron's brief memoir originally delivered as a lecture in Baltimore, 1989. The information contained in this little volume is too important to trust to hastily dashe
I continued on to with Reading My Father by his youngest daughter, Alexandra Styron, an absorbing, intimate memoir detailing what it was like to be William Styron's daughter in good times and in bad.
The bad included not only the time Styron so articulately described in this work, but in his continuing battle clinical depression.
Yes, I am making a study of Styron's life and his works, a number of which I have read at this time, but not all of them.
Styron is remarkable for his revelation of his illness, it is the taking off the mask that those battling depression wear so well, for so long.
His stories are liberally laced with a depth of understanding that he acknowledged could only come to those who have experienced it.We are not talking about a few days or even depression over a week or two, but rather months where the elevator keeps going down no matter how many times one thumps the Up button.The rawness of Mr. Styron’s descent into deep depression is what made it difficult to read.
I will also never forget that he did succeed in moving through it; just as his elevator skimmed the rock bottom of his life, it changed direction and began a slow and laborious climb upward again.Not without a near-crisis, and not without a lot of help.
This was the introduction to Unix and it was coming to an end.So was I.Tears flowing copiously, leaning over the second floor balcony, I was overcome with darkness, the likes of which I had never experienced before.I finished the exam and could not gather myself.
I kept remembering the bliss of that day as I sank deeper into the lake my last breath bubbling to the surface and the incredible softness and beauty of the afternoon sun reaching below the surface and I in total surrender, enveloped by her.
It wasn't my time.The bliss was calling again and I was ready.
Looking back I've had a major episode of depression at about every 15 years.
I read it during one of my own periods of depression, and for whatever reason I decided to pair it with The Bell Jar, and instead of feeling any sort of comfort or recognition in Styron's words, I just felt sort of angry.
I've never felt especially noble or touched by a strange, dark power or whatever--I've spent almost fifteen years of my life thinking that I'm broken and that I should cheer up already.
I know that there's no such thing as capital-D Depression, and that we all experience it differently (and maybe even differently throughout our own lives), but there was just something about Styron's tone that really irked me.

For example, he said he usually felt the most depressed later in the day: "Afternoons were still the worst, beginning at about three o'clock, when I'd feel the horror, like some poisonous fogbank, roll in upon my mind, forcing me into bed." (This quote was also used in the Soderbergh movie "Side Effects.")Styron sought help from a psychiatrist, who put him on a series of different medications, none of which seemed to help.
خيلي خوب افسردگي رو توضيح داده بود و به خوبي نشون داده بود ممكنه افسردگي سالهاي سال با ما باشه بدون اينكه خودمون اطلاع داشته باشيم.
نویسنده تجربیات مواجه شدن خود با افسردگی را نوشته که بسیار خواندنی و تامل برانگیز است. ترجمه و چاپ همانطور که از نشر ماهی انتظار می رود بسیار خوب است.
Anyone who has ever battled depression will recognize him or herself in Styron's words. Despite all his accomplishments, the depression made him feel unworthy of recognition and made clear thinking difficult. The language he uses reminds me of books written in the 1940s, but this was published in 1990. This is a short but poignant memoir.
Styron's honesty gives his memoir a sheer truthfulness, as his attention to detail and self-analysis make his story feel even more painful and real.
He concludes his memoir in an uplifting and candid way, acknowledging that yes, depression sucks, and yes, it gets better.
I will finish this review with a closing quote from Darkness Visible itself:"But one need not sound the false or inspirational note to stress the truth that depression is not the soul's annihilation; men and women who have recovered from the disease - and they are countless - bear witness to what is probably its only saving grace: it is conquerable."
خیلی از اتفاقات در زندگی هست که با زمانبندی مناسبی رخ میدهند و آدم کیفش را میبرد و یا بعدها برایش روشن میشود که اگر دیرتر یا زودتر رخ داده بود فایده و اثر نمیکرد.
نمونهای که همیشه مثال میزنم تعدادی فیلم و کتاب است.
هر وقت از من راجع به کوئیلو میپرسند میگویم برای ۱۵ سالگیم حرفهای خوبی داشت و بس، یا از بین ستارهای نولان که حرف میزنم، همیشه تأکید میکنم که دیدنش در آن زمان بهخصوص با آن روحیه، به دادِ من رسید که بالاخره با فراغ پدر کنار بیایم و رهایش کنم.
این کتاب هم دیشب سروکلهاش پیدا شد.
صرفاً واقایع نگاری‌است دوره بیماری نویسنده.کتاب، در هیچ زمانی جز این روزهایم نمی‌توانست اینقدر شفابخش باشد.
زمانی که پذیرفته بودم تا آخر عمر دست به گریبانِ مالیخولیای افسردگیم خواهم بود.
دیگر داشتم به مرحله پذیرش می‌رسیدم که این هم زندگی منی است با داشتن ذهن و روحیاتی این‌چنینی.
در دل طوفان بوده و زجر ذهنی بی‌انتهایی کشیده، بی‌آنکه در روحیه‌اش باشد به خودکشی فکر کرده اما تسلیم نشده و هرکاری به ذهنش می‌رسیده انجام داده است.
درکی که کتاب از همه گیر بودن این اتفاق به من داد، اعتماد به نفس از دست رفته‌ام در مقابله با افسردگی را به من برگرداند.
"The pain lifted a little and my mind would become lucid enough to focus on matters beyond the immediate upheaval." Although Mr. Styron began to feel more and more distressed and anxious in anticipation of his Paris excursion, when the time finally arrived, he managed to get through it, although not without a tremendous amount of difficulty.
demonstrating to me that depression (and mental illness in general) is NOT for the faint of heart!Over the years I have read other personal accounts of depression that could perhaps be considered more compelling in their details than the account written by William Styron; however, when I stop to consider that Mr. Styron wrote his account in 1989, I can't help but admire and feel grateful for his courage.
It was a book about depression and suicide.
And yeah, maybe you're wondering why did I read something about those sad human beings in the book and their actions.
The answer to that question is "I don't know".
Maybe because I wanted to know more, to find answers to my own questions.
I know what depression is...
Also, he mentions that in those moments when depression takes control of you, the most important thing is to have someone near you, someone who is willing to help you, to spend time with you and cherish you.
كتاب كه نه بيشتر يه مقاله بود ، و اطلاعات جالبى توش درباره ى افسردگى گفته شده (:
"Darkness Visible: A Memoir of Madness" is a brief but compelling autobiographical journey through what Chaucer described as "melancholia" in the first literary reference made to what is now called a "mood disorder."Styron writes plainly about his experience with depression, including a lengthy hospitalization that ultimately assisted him in obtaining coping skills to manage his illness (an option unfortunately seldom available in modern times, as physicians resort to pharmacopeia as some sort of magic bullet that does not always help patients).
On pp 61-62 of the book, Styron shares what is, to me, the most accurate and compelling description of what it is like to live with depression as he relates preparing for a dinner party:"And this results in a striking experience -- one which I have called, borrowing military terminology, the situation of the walking wounded.
بیماری ای که نویسنده آن را برخلاف تصور دیگرانی که از بیرون می نگرند، «توفان مغزی» می نامند و از قول بودلر «صدای باد ِ بالهای جنون» می خواند.مساله ای که به درستی در جای جای کتاب مورد تاکید و اشاره قرار میگیرد ، شدت درد و رنجی ست که کاملا از نگاه دیگران (دیگرانی که مبتلا نیستند) ، پنهان و مخفی ست.یکی از عجایب اسم های بزرگی ست که در این ظلمت آشکار راهی جز خودکشی نایافته اند:ون گوگ، ویرجینیا وولف، همینگوی، رومن گاری، گورکی، جک لندن و ...بخش هایی از کتاب:
Though my experience was not nearly as severe as his, I do feel a deep sense of empathy for his plight.
In the intervening years, though I have long since extracted myself from the morass I was in then, I simply have never gotten around to picking up this book.I am glad for Styron that he was able to live out the end of his years in a greater peace and inner harmony than he speaks of here.
Everyone should give this book a read, if only to understand those in your life who may be suffering from depression right now.

#📚4⭐️/5⭐️#کتاب #خاطراتکتاب #ظلمت_آشکار نوشته‌ی ویلیام استایرن ترجمه افشین رضاپور از #نشرماهی————————————————-کمابیش همه این واژه را شنیده‌اند؛ #افسردگی.
بسیاری آن را تجربه می‌کنند، اما کمتر کسی می‌تواند احساساتش را از این دوران انتقال دهد.
نویسندگان و هنرمندان بیش از همه گرفتارش می‌شوند، #ویلیام_استایرن هم یکی از آن‌هاست؛ نویسنده بزرگی که یکی از مفاخر معاصر ادبیات آمریکا است.
استایرن در شصت سالگی دچار افسردگی ماژور شد؛ افسردگی‌ای که تنها یک راه را برای خلاص شدن پیش پای مخاطبانش می‌گذارد؛ و آن #خودکشی ست.
در آخر استایرن به دنبال ریشه این افسردگی میگردد.
البته استایرن معتقد است خاطرات این دوران در یادمان ماندگار نیست، امیدوارم چنین باشد.
The pointlessness of one’s life becomes a fact, regardless of the ‘true’ reality of the situation and one ends up playing little more than a waiting game with the ultimate destination likely to be either self-inflicted death or, if one is able to wait it out and find the help one needs, eventual recovery.
Ο Γουίλιαμ Στάιρον ήταν ένας από τους δεκάδες συγγραφείς που αντιμετώπισαν το τέρας της κατάθλιψης, έχοντας φτάσει μάλιστα πολύ κοντά στην αυτοκτονία.
Η κατάθλιψη είναι μια από τις χειρότερες ασθένειες που ο άνθρωπος μπορεί να έχει την ατυχία να αντιμετωπίσει τουλάχιστον μια φορά στην ζωή του και γι'αυτόν που πάσχει είναι υπερβολικά δύσκολο να εξηγήσει ακριβώς τα γιατί και πως, να δώσει να καταλάβει στον υγιή τι αντιμετωπίζει ένας καταθλιπτικός καθημερινά.
Ο Στάιρον μας δίνει μια ιδέα και την δυνατότητα να δούμε ένα κομμάτι από το σκοτάδι της ανθρώπινης ψυχής, αλλά και πως κατάφερε να ξεφύγει μια για πάντα απ'αυτόν τον Γολγοθά.
Είναι ένα πολύ ενδιαφέρον, σημαντικό και καλογραμμένο αυτοβιογραφικό βιβλίο, που όμως δεν πρέπει να διαβαστεί σαν...
I avoid books like this one, largely because I believe the cult of romanticism surrounding artistic despair is misguided to the point of being offensive.
As both a writer and someone who suffers from chronic depression, I see nothing romantic about the myth of the suffering artist.
(It also angers me that many people assume the two facets of my life depend on each other: I suffer, so I write.
I write, so I suffer.
However, I was moved by Styron's pithy and unsentimental account of his battle with depression - largely because he didn't connect to any "artistic" sensibility at all.
Certainly, on some level, when Styron sets his struggle with suicidal depression in print, he is.
They will set him aside in their minds as an “other.” And in a way, isn’t this exactly what my friend was implying with her exclamation—that she doesn’t want everyone to know all the ways, big and small, that she is different or doesn’t “belong”?
Yet, what my friend is missing is that a writer like Styron isn’t engaged in a reckless act of self-exhibitionism; he is engaged in a project of cultural critique.
''Depression, most people know, used to be termed "melancholia," a word which appears in English as early as the year 1303 and crops up more than once in Chaucer, who in his usage seemed to be aware of its pathological nuances."Melancholia" would still appear to be a far more apt and evocative word for the blacker forms of the disorder, but it was usurped by a noun with a bland tonality and lacking any magisterial presence, used indifferently to describe an economic decline or a rut in the ground, a true wimp of a word for such a major illness.'' ''Depression afflicts millions directly, and millions more who are relatives or friends of victims.

از بهترین کتاب‌هایی که خواندم همین کتاب کوتاهِ خاطرات افسردگیِ ویلیام استایرن است: «ظلمت آشکار» که نه یک بار بلکه چندین بار خواندمش و خواهم خواند.
خاطرات یک از دنیای افسردگی سالم بازگشته به حدی نادر است که بایستی آنرا چون تابلوی «او توانست پس من هم می‌توانم» بر دیوار اتاقمان بکوبیم.برای آن‌ها که در جنگل تاریک افسردگی اقامت کرده‌اند، و عذاب توجیه‌ناپذیر آن‌را می‌شناسند، بازگشتشان ار مغاک بی‌شباهت به معراج شاعر نیست که کشان کشان از اعماق تاریک جهنم بیرون می‌آید و در جهانی که خود «جهان‌ تابناک»‌اش می‌نامد، ظاهر می‌شود.
درمورد دوران افسردگي نويسنده .باهاش ارتباط برقرار كردم كلا.
Given the number of great reviews this book had, I was eager to read, especially regarding a topic I feel is extremely neglected in good literature.
Also, I would have loved more expansion on the rawness of ones' feelings, especially given the considerable length he uses to instill the possibility of recovery, which I felt too difficult to comprehend given my current state of mind.
William Styron is a beloved author having written such classics as The Confessions of Nat Turner and Sophie's Choice.I read 'Nat' soon after it was published (1967) and neither remember it or this author's wonderful writing style.Needless to say I knew nothing about his descent into a very dark depression.
I am so sorry that Styron had to endure this but so glad he lived to write about it and share it with us.His ultimate stay in a very good hospital for 7 weeks effected the cure he needed.
Next I need to reread 'Nat' and read Sophie's Choice and his first book, Lie Down in Darkness (1951).5 stars
Because that's the kind of friends I am xDNow, for the book, it was simply AMAZING, I just loved it, and loved how it spoke to me on so many levels, I loved the willingness of the author to share such an experience, as though he wants to tell everyone out there who suffers from depression that they can get through it safe and sound if only they had the right environment and the right amount of support and love.
Depression is such a tricky instability, so few realize they're drowning in it, and that's exactly why very few tend to deny its existence.
توصیفهایی که پیش از مطالعهی کتاب از دیگران خوانده بودم این تصور را برایم ایجاد کرد که کتاب راهنمایی بر غلبه بر افسردگی است اما پس از مطالعه دریافتم بیشتر توصیف بیماری افسردگی است. و این توصیف از میانهی کتاب به خوبی صورت میگیرد.
