I almost gave this two stars until I realized how utterly pointless the book was.
Nothing in the story advances the plot of the Foundation Series until the last 10 pages or so.The "sims" were (thankfully) largely downplayed after their disastrous introduction in Foundation's Fear.
So in these regards, it was not as bad as Fear was.But, there were robots.
In previous books, Asimov stated how it was very hard for Daneel to manipulate someone's mind even a small amount.
Why??Asimov would be rolling over in his grave if he realized how his legacy was tainted by his greedy survivors.
With this book the words are there but the meaning is lost and the reader is left looking through a small peephole with no understanding of what is happening.The characters were one dimensional and there were no clear antagonists.
There were multiple minor annoyances that added up to make this a bad book:The author had a penchant for ending paragraphs using ellipsis.
For some reason he liked to use the word "ceil" in place of "ceiling." Note to author - "ceil" is a verb.
The author should review the proper use of parenthesis.
I finished reading "Foundation and Chaos" by Greg Bear.
This is an authorized part of the Asimov Foundation series .
Once again we get into the details, filling out the story about how the Foundation got started.
The original series started off rather abruptly with a new character, placed on trial and an older character that seems to know what is going on.
Foundation and Chaos provides that information, outlining the trial and a lot of the back story of the characters who were only names in the book "Foundation".
The book also suggested how the main "bad guy" in the original Foundation series might have come about.

Does some damage control on what Benford did to the series in the first book before it gets going but I'd give this series a pass unless you're a fanatical completionist.
Lodovic Trema, an ancient robot and long-time associate of Daneel R Olivaw’s plans for humanity, has been altered by Voltaire (an AI personality first encountered in Foundation’s Fear).
This means that the evolved humans now having abandoned their Gods, it is time for the Robots to do the same.Were this not a posthumous sequel with a solid body of work stretching back – with various degrees of quality – to the Nineteen Forties, the concept of a robot in the late Nineties novel would only work in some ironic post-modern sense, as it does in ‘Roderick’.
More importantly, the plot of this book feels more cohesive, resulting in a more entertaining read.The Second Foundation Trilogy covers the life of Hari Seldon, his invention of psychohistory and his setting up of the two Foundations.
Although Hari Seldon is the main character of the trilogy (and thus this particular book) large parts of it are witnessed through the eyes of other characters.
On the other, I found Seldon to be one of the most interesting characters and wanted to spend more time in his head.
This book reads and feels more like an Asimov Foundation story.
The book is well written, the characters interesting and the setting well developed.
This is such a super rubbish book.
I am actually very disappointed I read it.
Some reviews of post-Asimov Foundation said that Fear was so rubbish that it’s best just to skip to this one so I did.
If anything it has tainted my lasting images of Asimov's wonderful time-spanning saga.
Daneel is much crueler in this than in any Asimov story, he's ruthless and really is laid out as a blight on humanity.
Asimov would be gutted, I'm gutted.
Once you've read Asimov's work on this series, consider it as over, that's it, let it go, don't be tempted to read this.
Siguiendo con la trilogía incluida en la lista de libros de 2008 – 2009. Después del anterior, este continúa las aventuras del matemático Hari Seldon. Si del anterior dije que era un poco space opera, este es algo más, y en general entra en una serie de historias con los robots (una constante de Asimov) que me ha gustado menos que el anterior, por lo que se queda con solo 2 estrellas.
I completed Foundation and Chaos in a few weeks, reading mostly in the late evening or in stolen minutes during weekends.
By contrast, I took months to finish the first entry in this trilogy, Foundation's Fear by Gregory Benford.
Benford's plodding, tedious pacing and fragmented plot did not inspire confidence in the rest of the series but Greg Bear turned that around.
I was eager to return to Foundation and Chaos everyday and for as long as possible.
Bear tackled the robots of Asimov's Galactic Empire head on, while minimizing Benford's influence from the first entry.
I'm eager to begin Foundation's Triumph by David Brin.
Starting in the middle of a series is a crazy idea but read the book. You in a world of low intelligent thanks to a disease that kills any child of high intelligent. One of the main character Klis suffered as a child. Lucky for the robots she and a boy called Brann survived this. The robots they to get these two to help the change of the world. The story is deep and philosophy like. A bit too deep to read.
Liest sich ganz nett, aber ist doch ohne den Asimov drive. Tatsächlich könnte der Meister ihn selbst geschrieben haben, wenn sein Stil sich weiter verflacht hätte.Es geht um einen Roboter, der gar nicht mehr an die Gesetze gebunden ist, und mit eigenem Gewissen erkennt, dass das Nullte Gesetz die Menschen entmündigt und böse ist. Das immerhin sehr gut. 5/10
Now, I'm not going to say that this series is as ground-breaking as Asimov's (puhlease), but I do highly recommend that all the haters go back and read some of the originals and reassess how they feel about these authors matching (or not matching) Asimov's "voice." Having recently read the entire original series, I'm pretty amazed at how these books fall right in line.
3.5* Lots of interesting aspects of the story. For some reason, just couldn't connect with the characters. Maybe it was because there were too many interesting characters? I was just left with the feeling that I had watched something very interesting and was hoping for more?
I really had high hopes of what Bear could bring to Asimov. I like Bear the more but I regret that I feel instead of lifting Foundation Bear was dragged down from his lofty and brilliant science based fiction
Awesome read!Loved the way the book is integrated to the ones that came before in the series. Just like the others in this series, amazing how the multiple story lines merge together.
Enjoyable.

This is the second Foundation based book I read. After this I read the original Foundation trilogy. In a way I am glad I read this first because it helped built up the story of Hari Seldon, and this book ends in the perfect place for the original Foundation trilogy to pick up. In my opinion you can skip Foundation's Triumph, and probably Foundation's Fear as well as neither are that great. Of the second Foundation trilogy this volume was by far the best, I found the story interesting and it kept me wanting to read a little further.
This novel was a faster read than Foundation's Fear (Second Foundation Trilogy, #1), and seemed to dovetail very nicely with the initial vignette in Foundation.I was thrilled to see Dors back (I like/d her), but equally annoyed to see the return of Joan and Voltaire.My reading notes follow:(view spoiler)[﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿@ 2.7% // Well look at that!
The worm holes, a rare science accuracy in a world of space fiction (often called science fiction) of the previous novel has just been killed off in order to return to Asimov's hyper drive ships.
It still gets bogged down with a lot of details, but overall, I think he brings the best combination of talents to bear with this novel.This novel is a direct continuation, thematically, to Foundation's Fear (the story's chronology takes place a couple of decades after the events in that novel), and focuses more on how the robots play into the entire series.
I read to escape, not to be reminded of my ultimate futility.One aspect of the book that I initially disliked was the rehashing of the trial that began this series some 70 years ago.
Daneel Olivaw: Leader of the Giskardian robots.Hari Seldon: Mathist.
Leader of the Calvinian robots on Trantor.Dahlite: Add a description of this character.Brann: Big brawny man.
A mentalic, his power is making people like him.Klayus: Emperor of the empire.Vara Liso: Mentalic recruited by Wanda but refused instead went to work for Farad Sinter.Plussix: Calvinian robot.
Demerzel was first minister to Cleon.Gaal Domick: Mathist.
Brought to trial with Hari Seldon.Klia Asgar: Dahliite mentalic with strong powers of persuasion.Tritch: Captian of three ships including Flower of Evil.
Brought to Trantor so that he could be interviewed by Hari Seldon.
Given those elements, Gregory Benford, Bear and David Brin wrote a trilogy of novels focusing on Hari Seldon.
In the second of those books Bear is at a point where Linge Chen, chief commissioner of public safety, has brought charges of treason against Hari Seldon.
Meanwhile Farad Sinter with the help of Vara Liso is trying to first locate other mentalics, and later on robots.
Lodovik Trema is Linge Chen's trusted advisor, but is really a plant by Daneel Olivaw.
Sinter catches Planch and learns of Lodovik Trema's survival and goes on a hunt for robots.
La verdad es que lo terminé en parte porque no me gusta dejar libros sin terminar, en parte porque siempre guardo la "esperanza" de encontrar esa parte del libro que me mueva el piso.
Se puso "bien" interesante recién cerca del final: ahí pasaron muchas cosas, toda la trama empezó a agilizarse.
Una cosa es desarrollar un tema de interés particular por el autor a lo largo de la historia, plantear esas situaciones; otra es sólo nombrar los conceptos.
Me gustaría leer la original, para ver de dónde vienen las cosas, sólo espero que no esté escrita en el mismo tono.
#2 of the Second Foundation Trilogy is definitely better than #1 (which was very tedious).
It gives a lot of background, not all of it is necessary, but some of it is somewhat interesting.The massive infusion of robots combined with the contribution of the mentalics made the story rather complicated, as two warring factions of robots play a substantial role.
The culmination put the mentalics to the foreground of the action, and their confrontation with the robots was somewhat convoluted.
Now I'm looking forward to reading #3 (Triumph) which is said to be the best of the Second Foundation Trilogy.
Been a long time since I read the Foundation or robot stories from Asimov, so I was eager to jump back into the story.All three authors did a good job remaining true to the original timelines, major events and characters.
That said, you could tell this was sort of filler.
Should have expected that, right?Has motivated me to go back and read some of the robot stories again -- lots of robot activity in all three of these.* Couldn't finish** I had nothing else to do*** Passed the time, would be **** for genre / author fans**** Everyone could enjoy this book***** Everyone should read this book, I'll read it again
Minden tekintetben meghaladja a Gregory Benford jegyezte Az Alapítvány félelme c. regényt. Greg Bear története nemcsak tartalmi-logikai és stilisztikai szempontból illeszkedik sallangmentesen Asimov univerzumába, hanem a benfordi szálakat is sikerrel fűzi össze az Alapítvány epizódjaival – egy nem éppen könnyű feladat. Nyilván, az Alapítvány és a Robotok univerzum szakértő olvasói kimazsolázhatnak egy-két következetlenséget, lelhetnek néhány pontot, ahol Bear sztorija apró karcot ejt az asimovi regényfolyamon (bár ilyen súrlódások az eredeti asimovi novellák között is kimutathatók, amint arra maga a szerző is rámutatott), de ezek egyike sem csökkenti érdemben a befogadói élvezetet, sőt…

This book was an interesting one for me. It finds many loose ends in robots and foundation series and tight them together, telling stories that were either reason or result for different events in the series. And it take place in time frame of the beginning of "Foundation" book, but focusing on the story from different point of view. Deja-vu. But even without such references it is a good book, with a few interesting characters and some important questions to ask. I really enjoy it.
Bear did a fantastic job to "continue" the Foundation serie with a missing prequel. The many parallel threads resemble the well-known structure of the original Foundation books. Even the narrative style and the twist till the end is surprisingly similar to Asimov's one as if the old master had written them himself. To the core an successful prequel even though sometimes I miss the what-if mindgame of Asimov so dearly.
