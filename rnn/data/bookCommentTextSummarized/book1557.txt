Quiet and eerie, composed near the start of the Harlem Renaissance, Cane trembles with surreal beauty. Toomer's language is at once lucid and suggestive, his subjects disturbing and anguished; the tension between Toomer's aesthetically appealing prose and his painful subject matter proves to be increasingly unsettling as the book unfolds. Juxtaposing poetry and prose, past and present, north and south, script and narrative, the three-part experimental work of fiction also defies easy categorization, further upsetting readers' expectations and emotions. Despite the short book's disconcerting character, or because of it, Cane is spellbinding: it feels impossible to put aside, once begun.
One story begins and ends with the haunting refrain:Betty was the white woman who had two Negro sons.
For example, two poems frame a story of a black housekeeper who is courted by the white son of her employer.
Although this book is typically identified as “black literature”, Toomer himself, whose mixed blood allowed him often to “pass” as a white, once advocated for a broader view in a letter to a magazine: “From my own point of view I am naturally and inevitably an American.
In character vignettes of one, two, three pages interleaved with short poems, Toomer explores the lives of black people, mostly in the rural south, specifically a tiny hamlet dominated by a sawmill (marked mostly by smells and sounds), sugar cane fields and pines, the timeseason--autumn, the time, dusk.
The scene of cane came from the copper pan and drenched the forest and the hill that sloped to factory town, beneath its fragrance It drenched the men in circle seated around the stove.
And from factory town one could see the soft haze thrown by the glowing stove upon the low-hanging heavens."Here's a passage from 'Fern': (my favorite story)"We walked down the Pike with people on all the porches gaping at us.
Well, okay, but the whole "Rhobert" chapter is rather far-out, as far as far-out goes.Here are some other little snippets I liked:"...words is like the spots on dice: no matter how y fumbles em, there's times when they jes won't come.""God, he doesn't exist, but nevertheless He is ugly.""As he steps towards the others, he seems to be issuing sharply from a vivid dream.""Th form that's burned int my soul is some twisted awful thing that crept in from a dream, a godam nightmare, an wont stay still unless I feed it.
"Karintha is a woman. Men do not know that the soul of her was a growing thing ripened too soon. They will bring their money; they will die not having found it out...Karintha at twenty, carrying beauty, perfect as dusk when the sun goes down. Karintha..." This book is a structurally-inventive mix of prose, poetry and drama with beautiful language. This new edition also contains an essay about the question of race and the life and career of the mixed-race Toomer who was an important figure in the Harlem Renaissance and modernist literature.
If you have heard a Jewish cantor sing, if he has touched you and made your own sorrow seem trivial when compared with his, you will know my feeling when I follow the curves of her profile, like mobile rivers, to their common delta.I find it impossible this morning to attempt comment on a lynching or a literary reflection thereof.
Despite my tone deaf groaning as of late about dialect, the final parable in this tome touched me.
This book was recommended to me about 10 years ago by a childhood friend.
That friend was entitled to his own weary blues.
Two readerships here for which this one is UEber=pertinent ::1) readers of the Classics of African=American fiction.2) readers of things experimental in the category of It's Not Really a Novel (but what then is it?)3) Also, for readers of I Ain't An African=American Author and I Don't Write Experimental Novels/Stuff.Really, this is one of the places it all began.
This was a thoroughly strange and surreal book, made all the more surreal by the fact that it was one of the first avant-garde black American novels. Toomer's world explodes with color and light, with shades of Faulkner and Sherwood Anderson. If there is a document of American magical realism, this is it. It's too easy when describing the rural black South to rely on stereotypes and minstrelsy (Zora Neale Hurston, I'm looking at you). Toomer, to his credit, doesn't, at all. His world is too damn weird.
Cane proved to be a swan wong, not only, as Toomer believed, for the folk culture but also for his own writing career, as he only published one small book afterwards.
With the second part that style is no longer functional for Toomer, because he believes the urban environment, in contrast to the world of cane and soil and pine, and the changing social experience cut people off from the sources of feeling and vitiate their spirit.
Though not as well known as Langston Hughes, Jean Toomer is considered one of the shining stars of the Harlem Renaissance and this collection of short stories and poems is his best work.
It's a tricky skill, as repetition can be both effective and annoying.
Sherwood Anderson and Ernest Hemingway, in their short stories, could be effective with it.
Gertrude Stein was just annoying.Toomer was also ahead of his time in that he scorned use of apostrophes for contractions and possession, and quotation marks for dialogue.
This one is a gem; the writing is gorgeous, the stories absorbing. P-thought of you, this is a definite genre bender with episodic chapters/short stories and poetry, always referred to as a novel. Toomer is often grouped with the Harlem Renaissance and the stories center on the reverse migration of a urban Northern man to the rural South. However, Toomer never worked with black themes again and did not consider himself part of that community. As such the book exhibits a fractured experience and the language compliments this. Its singularity makes it that much more special.
I enjoyed this. I really think everyone should read at least a couple of poems from this book. Or some of the short stories. My favorite was "Bona and Paul."Now it's time to write my english paper on this.... :/
It is a thin book, poetic, spiritual, and revealing of the black culture in Jim Crow south in the 1920's in America.
Toomer's care with words carries a narrative of a world which existed, and still exists, parallel to Anglo-Saxon culture.
The story, which seems random and episodic, is set primarily in Jim Crow Georgia, and it reveals the way what Toomer refers to a "negro" culture adapted to the realities of their social position.
D. Salinger and Harper Lee to their critics, that he never published another book.
Cane is an incantory combination of poetry and prose, vignettes that are loosely held together by the common theme of black American life in rural Georgia at the turn of the twentieth century.
Curls up and spreads itself pine-high above the branch, a single silver band along the eastern valley."On the writing of Cane, the author, Jean Toomer, said, "The folk spirit was walking in to die on the modern desert.
Cane was a swan-song.
It was a song of an end." This new critical edition of Cane is the only way to approach the book.
Southern literature, in my opinion, contains some of the most powerful and immortal books in the American literary canon.
Novels born in the South are born out of and into its troubled past–a landscape fraught with the difficult union of charmed myth and bloody reality.
Toomer taps into the tragic legacy of slavery to write one of the best, most enduring novels about the African-American experience in the South.
It’s beautiful, it’s graphic, it’s disturbing, it’s compelling–it’s everything a novel should be.READ IF: You want to read one of the most outstanding books in American literature.
More like 4 1/2 stars, but I'll round up just because I haven't rated any books 5 stars this year yet.Jean Toomer's Cane really is a "literary masterpiece." I was in awe of his style and form, how he utilizes devices we associate with theater in a novel. I also loved the comparison of the North vs. the South, especially embodied in the last short story, "Kabnis."I've got to say "The Box Seat" is my favorite story, though, followed closely by "Bona and Paul."LOVE the Harlem Renaissance!!!
I wish I studied this book in college. Cane is a fragmented piece of art composed of prose, poetry, and drama. I've never read anything like it before. The language is beautiful and rich. I needed to consume it in small bites so it didn't overwhelm me.

Toomer had an interesting pedigree: he was considered a Northerner by many Southerners, and a Southerner by many Northerners.
This was in part because both of his grandmothers were left plantations by white men, making them among the most prosperous citizens in the dirt poor communities around Sparta, Georgia.
Toomer spent some summers with his grandmothers during childhood and even was the principal of a school in Sparta for a short time before leaving for Paris.
From this perspective, he wrote Cane.
The language in these stories in lush, and experimental for its time.
Toomer never again wrote about the black experience, but he didn't need to.
It is no wonder Alice Walker was deeply inspired by this slender but powerful, poetic, and quietly damning book.
A mix of Tender Buttons and Winesburg, Ohio. You can hear Gertrude Stein all over: "Emptiness is a thing that grows by being moved." On the same page, "Her mind is a pink meshbag filled with baby toes." Later, "Life is water that is being drawn off."

I read this for the first time as an undergrad.
It didn't appeal to me then, but this time 'round, things were a bit more clear.
I think that the most important issue this novel touches is that of identity.
We see this come to the surface in many (if not all) of his character sketches.The jagged style of writing is a bit confusing for many, but for your students, relate it to the movements of jazz music and the lights turn on.This is a stunning example of the "art" of literature.
The expressions, movements, and portrayals are very real and vivid.
A wonderful, magisterial voice - at its best, up there with Whitman - but young and unfinished. It has that explosive, tightrope feel of some early works by brilliant writers. It's known as the first important black novel of the Harlem Renaissance, which is funny because it's not a novel - it's some sort of weird poem/play/novel hybrid - and Toomer, who was of mixed parentage, didn't identify as black. It's hard to see which he hated and feared the most - women or himself.
This book was OK. I didn't understand why poetry was interjected in the middle of the story. It made it hard to follow. But even if there wasn't poetry it still would have been hard to follow. Oh well.I liked the last two hours of the book that described the history of why the author wrote it as well as a good background to it all. I found that more interesting than the book itself. Don't know why it was so long though.I tried. No one can say I didn't try.
Gorgeous, insightful poetry mixed in with short micro-stories that combine to create a rich impression of life for black folks in the south after the Reconstruction.The last third of the book was comprised of a single story line that I just couldn't quite connect to. But, the first two-thirds was brilliant. And I typically don't even like poetry.
This is a key piece of Harlem Renaissance proestry and its detailed and eloquent and beautiful and haunting and mellifluous...
And that big fat afterword, a big fat plus.
Ciascuna delle tre parti ha una diversa ambientazione: il sud rurale nella prima, il nord urbano nella seconda (soprattutto Chicago e Washington DC, curiosamente non NY); mentre la terza parla di un giovane insegnante, educato al nord, cui viene assegnata una cattedra in Georgia, dove riscopre la cultura degli africani d'America (quest'ultima parte contiene forti elementi autobiografici).Qualcuno si �� spinto fino a proporre una interpretazione per generi musicali di questa divisione: blues, jazz, spiritual (il ritorno alle radici).Toomer mira dunque a salvaguardare il patrimonio di un popolo che si era affrancato solo parzialmente dalla schiavit��: un partimonio in buona parte orale di canzoni e folktales; ma vuole farlo con mezzi d'avanguardia.
Per questo motivo litigò con Alain Locke, che nel 1925 lo incluse nell'antologia manifesto del movimento, The New Negro, ( http://bit.ly/bDCwtO ) e ruppe l'amicizia con Sherwood Anderson, il cui Winesburg, Ohio era stato una grande ispirazione per Cane (andò meglio con un altro esponente del local color, Waldo Frank, a cui è dedicata la parte terza dell'opera).Entro la fine degli anni '20 Toomer aveva perso interesse per la letteratura, dopo aver pubblicato uno dei migliori testi del decennio che pure vide molti dei più grandi romanzi del secolo (Faulkner, Fitzgerald e Hemingway, tanto per non uscire dai confini nazionali).Cane è un libro unico, sui generis, a partire dalla struttura.Non è un romanzo.
