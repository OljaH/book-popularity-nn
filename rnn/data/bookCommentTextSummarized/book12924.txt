Neo enjoyed this book, as it gave him a chance to look and find Waldo and friends throughout this animated craziness on a page. Less 'read' than 'gazed over for long periods repeatedly'. Great to get that grey matter and eyes as sharp as can be!
Odio a Wally. XD
My Grandchildren could find Wally and I only found him once.Time to visit Specsavers thinks me. 😊
You might be wondering why this book is on my "hidden gems" shelf. After all, pretty much everyone has read or at least heard of the Where's Waldo? books. Well, it's because Waldo is... wait for it... hidden!I'll show myself out.
I remember looking for Waldo with my mom and dad as a young kid, pouring over the book for hours.
I admire the skill and time that went into crafting every puzzle in the book, hiding the clues in just the right spots.
I read this book with my 5-year-old daughter several times and she thoroughly enjoyed finding the clues.
The only puzzle we encountered difficulty was with The Land of Waldos, the last story in the book.
We did find his shoe, but Waldo himself eludes us constantly!
Young and old readers will find this edition a perfect book to enjoy together or apart.
this is possibly the most mind stimulating book i have ever read! the plot is a little hazy, but the concept is spectacular. anyone who has not read this book is a truly deprived soul and needs to pick up a copy as soon as they can!
Even after all these years, I still find myself looking for the damn shoe on the last page.
هذا الكتاب عبارة تمرين ممتاز لقوة الملاحظة. يحكي الكتاب قصة والي وأصدقائه الخمسة الذين ينطلقون في مغامرة، ويطلب من القارئ أن يعثر عليهم وعلى أشياءهم في وسط رسومات حافلة بمئات الشخصيات والأشياء.
Seriously? You're reading my review of Where's Waldo?
Following the journey of Wally (or Waldo) or the other characters in many different settings.I think that this is an exceptional book that can be used to encourage children to enjoy books.
Although this book lacks a lot of writing I think that it is a great resource to accompany any lesson from ages 3 to 12.I would use it throughout primary to encourage speech, perhaps for students who are more reserved or have SEN.
Using one picture, each child will be given a different character name from the book.
There are also characters from previous scenes hidden in each of the scenes.The scenes included are: * The Gobbling Gluttons * The Battling Monks * The Carpet Flyers * The Great Ball-Game Players * The Ferocious Red Dwarves * The Nasty Nasties * The Fighting Forester * The Deep-Sea Divers * The Knights of the Magic Flag * The Unfriendly Giants * The Underground Hunters * The Land of WaldosSean and I have worked through the book together three times and we still haven't managed to find Waldo on every page.
We are completely stumped on "The Ferocious Red Dwarves", "The Unfriendly Giants" and "The Underground Hunters."
How much do I love these? You can find me sitting in a bookstore of library, unwilling to check out because I'd have to put them down for a few minutes. Surprisingly, the PandaBat didn't really burn out on them.
I loved these books whenever I was in Elementary school.It kept me busy and made me use my noggin.So if you're trying to work and your kids on getting on your nerves, plop them on the couch with one of these. =D
This series is fun but, for my money, Hillary Knight's Where's Wallace is far superior. There is really no meat to any of the Waldo books and due, to their nature they are not suitable for read-alouds. However, some kids just adore them and I'm all for anything that connects kids with books.
OP
Oh Waldo, you wiley minx! You had me a couple times with your yellow suited impersonator, but I was not fooled in the end. Always an enjoyable way to kill time waiting at the dentist's office.
Where’s Waldo is a beginners book for children.
It is fun interesting way to find Waldo who is hidden in picture.
There are clues on each page that hints to find Waldo in the jumble of people and objects.
Classroom: I would use this in my classroom for students that have finished their work before other students.
It will not only help the students increase their reading comprehension because of the hints that are needed to find Waldo.
It will also help their mind sort through pictures to find hidden objects, but it will also help students not to distract others around them who are working.
This book is basically little adventures and different scenes that Waldo hides in. I realized not that this book is frustrating. it gives me a headache trying to find Waldo. Supposedly this book was banned because a mother was appalled about how there was a character topless while sunbathing. I understand the challenge for this but really, what little kid would notice? Also, if it is really small, they re looking for Waldo who is in stripes not topless. So their focus would be on clothed people.
Over here, we call him Where's Wally?I think I own the Australian version of this one. Or maybe the one I own is completely different, in which case, this review is totally meaningless!In any case, what child hasn't tried to find that elusive bugger at some point? The man has officially won the Hide and Seek trophy, because he is an absolute champion. A stimulating mind game for children and adults pretending not to be interested in finding him, alike.
Much like Tolkien's epic, The Lord of the Rings, you read through this 'Fantastic Journey' with the feeling that, if Waldo were allowed to talk, he'd tell tales more epic than the furthest reaches of your imagination.
OMG...just completed the Where's Waldo Fantastic Journey book with Nathan and boy this took me back some years. We did fairly well until the Land of Waldos at the end. I think we spent more time on the last page than the entire rest of the book! He had fun though.
This is the Waldo book that really hooked me. The third in series, Martin Handford really bumped up his work on the themes of each scene shown here. Every scene is extremely creative and a lot of fun to explore. A favourite of mine as a child.
It took me forever to find Waldo in the sea of Waldos! Haha! This one was a lot easier than the last book. There was only two pages I had a hard time finding one item on. Onto the next! (Where's Waldo in Hollywood... I'm pretty excited about this one)
Its goood
The fun goes on.
This was such a cool book as a kid. I loved finding Waldo. I loved this book so much I bought a t shirt from forever 21 it's so cute. I just wish they'd make these books again.
finding people and things
My favorite Waldo book so far. It wasn’t too difficult but it was also challenging at times. Plus the scenes were a lot of fun in this book.
Excellent entertainment for kids.
Classic Book! loved this book as a kid and was happy to share it with my children. So glad i made the purchase!
