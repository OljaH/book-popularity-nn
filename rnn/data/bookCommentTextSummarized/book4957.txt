C.S. Lewis writes all his fiction with a purpose of philosophizing and helping the read see parallels to Christianity and really, just "real life".I value this trilogy as one of my favorite reads of all time.
You have to really pay attention to C.S. Lewis's characters' thought processes because therein lies the secrets to the books.I would dare say that even the most avid fiction readers will find this trilogy either 1: hard to read and hard to get into OR 2: slow to start but impossibly wonderful and fabulous in its artistic and philosophical creating.
I would rank this with Tolkien's Middle Earth work for skill in creating imaginary realities (Lewis and Tolkien were close friends and often gave each other feedback on drafts of their work) and with Stephen King's The Stand for its power as a story of good and evil.
Also like those other two stories, I would caution that some of this might be - no, is - too dark for children or young teens.I especially like the portrayal of evil as stupid, blind, and shallow rather than being intriguing, romantic, or alluring.
I actually liked this trilogy better than Lewis' other and better known Narnia series.
An agnostic for many years, this English Don and Professor of Literature came to develop a friendship with JRR Tolkien (yes, THE JRR Tolkien)and over the course of that friendship, converted to Christianity and the Church of England, (despite the protestation of Tolkien to a small degree who was himself Roman Catholic.)Lewis grew in fame throughout England in part due to his writing and in part due to his radio broadcasts known as "Fireside Chats" which became the basis of one of his more influential works, "Mere Christianity."Why raise this in the context of a review on this Space Trilogy?
Tolkiens writings, then you will indeed enjoy this epic adventure tale by Lewis!!!*** Out Of The Silent Planet***Dr. Ransom a philologist is kidnapped to Mars, there he shall be sacrificed to an alien and strange deity!!!So that the kidnappers can exploit the planet and take with them so much gold as they wish….needless to say that the story turn quite different...***Perelandra***This sequel takes place in Venus.....A strange world awaits Dr. Ransom, populated with colorful and strange beings!!!One of the most dramatic battles recorded in the literary history awaits Dr. Ransom against the incarnated terror..The destiny of Perelandra is at stakes!!!!***That Hideous Strength***My favorite one....Let me put it this way, the Loosers club against ( Nope, no Pennywise the Clown this time) unspeakable powers of evil!!!!Character development and the craft of story telling excel each other in Brillanz, skill and wit!!!!Five stars --not enough in my view-- Happy reading to all of you....Dean;D
Surprisingly, the genre ended up teaching me a thing or two about theology, and even more about the mechanics of the writing craft.Written in the 40s, Lewis' Space Trilogy has little to do with the physical world of outer space as we presently know it.
Little did I know, upon embarking into the world of Perelandra, that I was about to read my new favorite C.S. Lewis book, a work so colorful and imaginative and theologically charged that it would win me over completely.
You might say, "Its the story of a man named Ransom, and his adventures with space travel." and that "Written before the days that man had stepped onto the moon, it was far more imaginative (often mistaken, but oftener insightful) than what modern science fiction allows for." (It DOES take you on a rather fantastic trip; the scenery and creatures in this bemusing speculation of extraterrestial life runs far from the cold "little green men" assumptions.
There's sort of a love story, which feels a little more like an essay on the nature of love and gender and which trancends through the three books but comes to a head via a young unhappy couple in an english college town.
Reading with new bookgroup Nov 2015.
Can be read and enjoyed as sci--fi even though one may get lost at the end.
OR can be read seriously as theological discussion of an alternate Adam/Eve story on another world, even though one may get lost at the end nonetheless.
Really, although I'd like to review this very much, it would take too much time.
I should write myself a paper on it, just for fun.
I just don't know how people imagine such things (like Lewis imagines the environs and populace of Venus), but I'm glad they do.

This trilogy is definitely something different from the most SF books I've read. I was 17 when I read it and it was the first time religious content in book was so overwhelming that I couldn't help but notice it. To the day my impression of it could be described as "pearly-pink bubblegum in the sunset": pretty, soft-looking but loses the taste fast and becomes sticky and annoying.
They changed the way that I read books!
A lot of people I know who like the trilogy really had trouble getting into the third one, That Hideous Strength, and couldn't see how it fit in with the other two.
I love the way that Lewis uses it to tie our planet and our "modern day" society ("sometime after the War" is all he gives as a time period) into the vast scheme of the cosmos.
And (spoiler alert!) Merlin belongs in this book and in this trilogy, as does any other cultural story that doesn't go away and yet cannot be explained.
Later on in the book, this character trait nearly cost Mark his morality and his life when he tried to reach the inner circle of a group of immoral, evil plotters.
And you could see in his face that he was a man used up to the last drop, if you know what I mean—that he'd fall to pieces the moment the powers let him go."—Chapter 17Another important symbol in the book was a newspaper serial story that Mark used to read as a child.
Lewis, in writing about Miss Hardcastle, was trying to create a rather disgusting character who looked friendly enough on the surface but was evil to the core.NOTE: This quote is a good example of C.
Das hat mir persönlich sehr zugesagt und mir viel Freude beim Lesen bereitet, kann aber andere, weniger linguistisch interessierte Leser vielleicht ermüden, so wie mich die Theologie ermüdete.Ja, mitunter fand ich es ziemlich anstrengend, seitenweise Diskurse über den biblischen Sündenfall der Menschheit zu lesen und warum es eben doch nicht gut war, dass Eva vom Apfel nahm.
Außerdem deutet der Autor Lewis im Vorwort zum Dritten an, dass er darin einige Anlehnungen an die damals noch unveröffentlichten Schriften Tolkiens gemacht hatte, die sie sich bei den Inklings gegenseitig vortrugen.Ehrlich gesagt bedauerte ich es sehr, dass vieles so kam, wie es kam, und ich vorläufig nicht erfahre, was es mit Numinor in der Perelandra-Trilogie auf sich hat, aber dieses Buch ist ohnehin eher aufgeschoben als final abgebrochen.
I really enjoyed the first two books, but then got totally bogged down in the third. It took me about a year and a half to get through it. I know it’s because I didn’t really “get it”, but I enjoyed reading it so little that I don’t think I will put more effort into it. Four and a half stars for the first two, two stars for the third.
I went years without reading Lewis' celebrated sci-fi trilogy. Of the three I remember Perelandra most vividly, although with a little effort all three come back to me. That Hideous Strength was different from the others in that it seemed a cautionary tale about the direction our cultural trajectory is taking. All-in-all I felt the three novels deserved their place in classic sci-fi and Christian lit.
An enjoyable and riveting series of books.
See Plodcast, Episode #1.
Wonderful, one of the few sources that has started to convince me of the my need to read more sci-fi ;) Grand themes explored in fun, inventive ways.
The first half of Perelandra proved equally gripping, but took a turn for the unreadable once Lewis' Christian beliefs seeped too far (in my opinion) into the fabric of the plot.
As someone who does not subscribe to that particular belief, I found it rather off-putting for the author to assume that the reader would deem this point as fact, and thus be on board with what the protagonist was fighting for.
I simply couldn't turn another page without feeling a little disingenuous as a reader.
The storyline clearly became a vehicle for Lewis's religious ideals, and after riding along with him for a while, I respectfully had to hop off.
Lewis is writing fairly OK science-fiction-ish stuff, but it's all got this Catholic angle to it, which is kinda hokey if you think that thing is kinda hokey, and the plots aren't all that great, and there are some kinda dumb bits (the bad guys in That Hideous Strength are called "N.I.C.E.").
The reason I gave it five stars is for the confrontation between Ransom and Weston in Perelandra.
Lewis gives us a sophisticated view of evil (at least, compared to my thoughts on stuff), and a long, well-written, and extremely compelling conflict between these two guys, and it absolutely wowed me.
But it's worth reading the boring bits just for Ransom vs.
For a long time, I counted That Hideous Strength as one of my favorite books, and it very well fictionalizes that scientism vs.
Faith debate that Lewis found himself in quite often (see The God Question pitting Freud vs.
Lewis).
Perelandra is much more theological, but the question, "does God try the Adam and Eve experiment on another planet to start over?
What you do run into, quite often, is Lewis' inherent misogyny, and subsequent re-reads turned me off to many of the elements of the books themselves (when Dr. Ransom laughs in the face of the female protagonist for daring to assume the sexes are "equal," for instance).
It follows around the scientist, Ransom, who first finds himself kidnapped and taken to the planet Malacandra.
This whole triology portrays how "the Devil" influenced people from planet to planet to bring about damnation and the only planet that will fall is Earth.
On the second book, Ransom goes to Perelandra to save that planet from tempatation and it becomes the place Earth should've been.
Each planet started out with its own Adam and Eve and, according to the Bible, our world is the one that let sin in and the third and last book portrays Earth and all its evil and its good.
I thoroughly enjoyed the first two books.
Book One contains more sci-fi adventure than religion, but it illustrates the danger of ignoring inspiration in a way that has stayed with me for years.The second book asks interesting questions about the Fall and the role of the Savior.
I don't agree with all the theology in it, but it gave me a lot to think about.
I still think of Ransom in the bubble trees when I'm tempted to eat an extra cookie.The third book was thought-provoking as well, but I didn't enjoy it nearly as much.
This is C.S. Lewis’ foray into science fiction.
I read the books as a young teenager and then again only now.
The so-called science portrayed is closer to Jules Verne or Rice Burroughs, than it is to any modern science fiction.
Also, these books are very much Christian fiction, which is totally OK from my end.
All this being said: I enjoyed the first and third book, while Perelandra, the second was often wearisome to read.
From a Christian perspective, this makes sense as the powers of darkness have tempted people into the same traps for millennia.
I loved it! My brother gave this book to me as a present. I love the way that I became completely submerged in the new world, it was as if I had traveled to another place where I slowly learned about the culture, people and language, whilst this magical tale unraveled around me, I would defiantly recommend it!
Out of the Silent Planet: 5 starsNew favourite book. The story follows a simple plot but is rich in philosophical questions and spiritual truths. I wish to remain on Malacandra, and this, I believe, was part of Lewis's hopes for this story: that we would see the beauty of Heaven in the beauty of this alien world.
I only read Out Of The Silent Planet and found it so dull I couldn't go on. This is a fairly nice little collection, though, if you're into that kind of thing.
Good Sci-fi with a purpose.

Loved the trilogy. Perelandra (the second book) is my favorite. That Hideous Strength was difficult to get into, but the last third of the book makes it worth it.
A good trilogy in terms of breadth and ideas. Particularly Perelandra covers subjects with such intricacy and depth that it is worth reading several times.
Lewis had a lot of insight on what a different planet could look like and what species could be like there.
There were so many good phrases and quotes!This book has got me rethinking humanity and wondering how things could be different.
It seems Lewis gives us a vision of what this could look like and what it could mean for each of us to engage God's mission in different ways.Perelandra - I also really enjoyed this book!
In fact, at times it was almost like reading the Bible.
