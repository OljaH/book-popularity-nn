My god, but you would think the world all but ended when she broke up with her boyfriend, James, over ten years ago, and, yes,******SPOILER ALERT**************SPOILER ALERT**************SPOILER ALERT**************SPOILER ALERT**************SPOILER ALERT**************SPOILER ALERT**************SPOILER ALERT**************SPOILER ALERT**************SPOILER ALERT**************SPOILER ALERT********the break-up was brought on by her unexpected teen pregnancy (which she aborted), but Nora herself makes it clear that she was not upset so much by the pregnancy or the abortion: it was the break-up with James that has left her an emotional wreck as an adult, unable to form stable, long-term relationships.
this is a truly beautiful ARC, one of the nicest i've seen:  it's all textured and graphically pleasing and nice to touch and hold: but the story didn't really meet my expectations. i'm giving it a three, but it is a low three. it is an incredibly fast read, and if you are looking for something in that vein - a fast-paced page-turner mystery thing, this may well satisfy you. but be forewarned it is not a creepy book, or even remotely spooky, as the cover and epigraph seem to suggest:In a dark, d
but be forewarned it is not a creepy book, or even remotely spooky, as the cover and epigraph seem to suggest:In a dark, dark wood there was a dark, dark house;And in the dark, dark house there was a dark, dark room;And in the dark, dark room there was a dark, dark cupboard; And in the dark, dark box there was a....skeleton!which also bothers me because the line that transitions cupboard to box has been omitted, so it looks weird.
Honestly one of the worst books I have read this year, and I definitely cannot recommend it as a tense crime novel!!!In a Dark, Dark Wood is the antithesis of what a thriller should be.
The complexities of adult friendships / relationships was sorely lacking, and made the whole story seem like teenage drama.
There was no exciting build up, and it seemed to limp on and on and on...If crime novels or thrillers are your favourite genre of book, I would suggest you look elsewhere for a story that will keep you gripped and entertained.
3.5 stars It was growing dark, and somehow the shadows made it feel as if all the trees had taken a collective step towards the house, edging in to shut out the sky. Ten years ago, Leonora ("Lee" "Leo" "Nora") broke up with her boyfriend (James), ditched her best friends (Clare/Nina) and skipped town. She hasn't looked back since.Well, until now. She just got an invite to Clare's Hen Party (bacholorette weekend) and despite her misgivings, she decides to go.She's spent so much time running from
She just got an invite to Clare's Hen Party (bacholorette weekend) and despite her misgivings, she decides to go.She's spent so much time running from her past that she thought she could handle facing it...but (unsurprisingly) things do not go well...
So now, Nora is stuck with Clare (the backstabber), Nina (training to be a doctor), Tom (a gay playwright), Melanie (a young mother) and Flo (a carbon-copy of Clare).All of them are stuck in the glass house in the middle of the woods until this party is over.
We have the past (the Hen Party) interspersed with the present (Nora recovering from a car accident) until the two timelines merge.
The beginning was so fast and I was so sucked in and then the middle left me feeling lethargic and as if I were reading as I was walking through mud.
Then the end....
The end totally blew my mind.
The assortment of characters are absolutely uncanny.
Such a strange cast of characters but when written together it was absolutely perfect.
I love how it all came together but then I hate it at the same time and I can't say why...
You have to read it yourself but when you do you will think...
Oh how I hate this...
Writer Leonora (Nora) Shaw gets invited to old friend Clare's hen night (aka bachelorette party) by a girl named Flo.
(It is being held in Flo's aunt's house.) Nora lost touch with Clare years ago, hasn't spoken to her in ten years, and doesn't know if she wants to go to this party.
But after talking to another friend who is also invited (Nina) Nora reluctantly decides to go.Nora and Nina arrive at the house where the party is being held, which is isolated in the woods in Northumberland.
I found the glass house in the dark, isolated woods an eerie setting for this story.
The voice of the narrator was lovely, the music at the beginning and end creepy but the story itself was slow and a bit clunky at times...filled with constant chatting done by characters who were each a bit odd and behaved in a way that was both catty and juvenile.
It reminded me first of an Agatha Christie mystery, then of a show like Pretty Little Liars, and then of the game of Clue.
The story was entertaining enough but I would have enjoyed it more had it taken less time getting to the action of it all.
I feel that my lack of enthusiasm for this book was largely affected by my expectations being set too high.
I was expecting more of that heart-pounding, suspenseful writing that kept me on the edge of my seat, however, I couldn't help but feel underwhelmed upon finishing this book.
I kind of liked the main character, Nora/Lee/Leo/Leonora, but found I wasn't truly engaged in her story or life.
Though the story was somewhat predictable, it still kept stringing me along making me think perhaps I was wrong in my assumptions.
After a bachelorette (Hen) party, Lenora wakes up in a hospital bed badly bruised and confused with 
There have been many reviews for the regular book version of IN A DARK, DARK WOOD by Ruth Ware, but my review is for the audio version.
As happens so many times, a beautifully made audio version of the same book will quickly suck me in, even if I just read the same words myself and they seemed so uninteresting in my own head.The fabulous Imogen Church is the narrator, she is wonderful and a one-woman show, acting out all the voices with authentically nuanced personality traits.
Ms. Church is also reading Ruth Ware's next two books and I will definitely be listening.
(Spoiler alert: I plan to discuss that twist below.)  The story is being told by Nora’s POV she is an author , insecure woman haunted by her past , one day she recieved an Email from Flo inviting her to clare’s wedding , the bride « Clare » is  having “Hen night”  a party for women only and Tom of course the gay friend :D anyway Flo organized the party and invited Melanie , Tom , Nina , and NoraNora and Clare have known each other since they were five years old, Nora had a boyfriend James whom she broke up with and left her home town and never came back , after that nora lost contact with everyone she knew from that town and decided to leave her past behind and start fresh , Why ?
I had high expectations for "In A Dark, Dark Wood" by Ruth Ware, but I must be honest - I'm extremely disappointed with this clunky novel.
I feel like Ruth Ware's writing was uneven and frustrating to get through.
My 2nd problem was the protagonist, Leonora (also goes by Nora and Lee, *rolls eyes*).
Leonora also lacked self-awareness.
"In A Dark, Dark Wood" is one of the most disappointing novels I've read this year.
Ruth Ware is not a bad writer, she's just not as polished and refined yet, (this is her debut novel) so I'll cut her some slack.
Unfortunately my enthusiasm was short-lived.Perhaps I am on the wrong demographic for this novel, but I found this book tedious, repetitive and frankly not very original.
And really how many times do we need to hear that the protagonist is tired or cold or needs to remember what happened!!??These characters are not only dislikable, they are immature and obnoxious.
I usually don't mind unpalatable characters but as the reader, I need to CARE what's going to happen to them or at least there needs to be a solid story behind them.
** I would like to thank Random House UK, Vintage Publishing for allowing me the copy to read and review **This makes for  compulsive  reading.Lee is a writer, she lives on her own.Likes to run.She gets invited out of the blue to an old friends hen do, from Flo the Matron of Honor.
Except, each of them have their own lives now.Another friend there is Mel. She has a 6 month old baby she has left behind with the Father.
4.5 starsI finally got around to reading this and overall I thought it was entertaining even if there were some problems along the way.
How I choose to rate books is based mainly on my overall reading experience and I did have a fun time with this one.Leonora is invited to spend the weekend in the English countryside for her childhood friend's bachelorette party.
You know fairly early on something horrible has happened and the fun part is the story going back and forth between what happened during the party weekend and the aftermath.
Ruth Ware has a subtle yet affecting descriptive quality to her writing that sinks into your psyche, making this an edgy and highly intriguing read.So we have Nora then – invited rather randomly and out of the blue to the hen party of an old friend she has not seen for ages, she is in two minds as to whether or not to go.
Instead it turned out to boring and the characters were chatty and got on my nerves.
The chapters are short but the book still felt like it was a long read.
Nothing really happened until about mid way.
Which by than I was so over the characters that I did not care what happened to them.
I jumped to the last few chapters of the book because I was curious to see how this story would end.
Disappointment with what I found out was the motive for the whole story.
I don't know if I will check out another book by this author.
Find all of my reviews at: http://52bookminimum.blogspot.com/3.5 StarsI haven’t been able to break the “10 reviews behind” mark these last couple of months and since this one already has 10,000 it probably doesn’t need whatever idiocy I can spew out about it to help sell more copies, so I’m going to barf out something real quick here in order to (hopefully) not spend the first half of 2018 trying to play catch up.
That’s probably a good thing, because even though in the back of my brain I knew this was a mystery, when I settled down to read it one dreary Saturday morning I got lost in the story and gave zero farts about trying to figure out all of the whos/whens/whats/whys/hows.
She remembers that she had been at a Hen party that weekend for an old school friend, Clair, but the memory of the accident and of much of the time leading up to it refuses to break through the fog.
A week before, Nora received an email from someone named Flo inviting her to a Hen party for Clair Cavana.
Worse still is Flo's anxiety to not let anything get in the way of her plan to have the "absolutely perfect and best Hen party" for Clair, bursting into tears at the smallest things.
This is my review for the audiobook of In a Dark, Dark Wood by Ruth Ware, narrated by my all-time favorite Imogen Church.
**3.5-stars rounded up**Who needs friends when you can have frenemies?!I'm going to stew on this one for a while before I write my full review. Early thoughts:Predictable? In parts. Standard format? Certainly. Unreliable Narrator? Check. Delightful cast of unlikable characters? Definitely. Enjoyable? Heck ya.Full review to come...stay tuned!Original: My 4th and final Ruth Ware book of the year!
My sincere thanks to Edelweiss and Scout Press, a division of Simon & Schuster for providing the e-galley of In a Dark, Dark Wood to be published August 4, 2015.Have you ever had a falling out with a friend that you were really tight with?
Lenora can’t imagine why Clare would want her at this pre-nup celebration weekend and really would rather not dig up the past by attending.
In a Dark, Dark Wood is the first book to be published by Scout Press, a new literary imprint of Simon & Schuster.
She and you, the reader are piecing it together; so of course it’s not going to be tra la la, here, let me hand you the story !
I should write a proper review for this now that I have read three of her books.
It came at me from the opening sentence and had me and the narrator piecing things together as I went along.
Out of all three books, the mystery in each that pieces together, how the cards fall; this book is the most cathartic to me and also makes the most sense.
This book started off with a bang quick fast paced then in the middle i felt that it went into a lul
The writing was decent but definitely nothing spectacular, and it couldn't redeem the book from being anything but ordinary.
It's not a bad book by any means, but if you've read Gone Girl or The Girl on the Train you won't find anything particularly special here.
Sure, it was enjoyable enough, but by the last third of the book or so I just wanted to know what happened and be done.
At the end it was just a mediocre mystery story that one could do without having read, unless you're new to the genre.
A creepy hen-party, a few unlikely invitees. A secret agenda. A spooky glass house. An atmospheric forest. Entertaining: yesPsychological thriller: yesPredictable: yesProgrammatic: yesCover: magnificent!A middle-of-the-road novel. A good read, and for some, a surprising ending. But I saw the ending coming in the beginning. The drawn-out denouement was annoyingly contrived - to keep the suspense up was just too obvious. And the so-called secret was also clear from the start. Yawn.And that's it. Nevertheless, a cozy read.Two stars mean it was so-so. Three stars: The prose was good.
I feel like the mystery wasn't shocking in any way, but Ware did a great job in building motive for every character so I was always wondering what the truth of things really was.
I've previously read The Woman in Cabin 10 and I brought up in my review of it that I didn't like some of the language it used about body types and illness.
I would recommend In A Dark, Dark Wood over The Woman In Cabin 10, although it's a bit less of a thriller.There's a large emphasis on toxic friendships among the characters.
Also well-plotted and written overall; it's hard to sustain suspense with first person narration in which the POV character knows something she's withholding from the reader and also (in parts) has amnesia, but the author does this well.Not really creepy, though--your expectations are set up for that with the title and description, but it's a fairly straightforward psychological thriller.One question for someone who's read it--(view spoiler)[at one point, there was a reference to Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, and for a time I thought the author was implying that with James, as with Brick, there was repressed homosexuality.
In a Dark, Dark Wood is a mystery/thriller novel written by author Ruth Ware.
According to an interview with the author located HERE, Ms. Ware's writing in In a Dark, Dark Wood was influenced by Agatha Christie and the movie Scream.
The writing style itself exudes creepy suspense, the setting is nothing short of a horror film waiting to happen, and the characters create an interesting group dynamic that keeps the reader guessing at each of their intentions.This was a great book and I would highly recommend it to fans of mystery novels.
Tore through this one Sunday this past summer. Flo chilled me to my bones. I KNOW a Flo. Tight writing, moments of levity sprinkled through out. Great, delicious thriller to hunker down with on a cold, cold weekend ;-)
After reading and reviewing The Woman in Cabin 10, I was intrigued enough by Ruth Ware's writing to seek out her debut novel.
I guess I don't really understand why a person( Nora) would accept the invitation( from Flo) to attend the hen party(bachelorette party) for a girl (Clare) that she hasn't seen or talked to since high school.
In the 17 years since I have graduated from high school, I know exactly one former classmate( out of the 265 people I graduated with, drunkenly stated at our 10 year reunion) that felt her high school boyfriend was the "one that got away." Guess what?
