Audiobook.
I enjoyed the book .
What is interesting about The Druids Keep is that it appears to be a money grab by someone...
If one goes to Wikipedia, one will find that the original Sword of Shannara was published as a single 726 page book in 1977.
The Sword of Shannara book I reviewed recently, was apparently only Part 1 of the original publication.
The Druid's Keep is thus Part 2 of the original Sword of Shannara book, which itself was the first book in a trilogy.
For now, I highly recommend finding the old, single volume book, or buying all three together as a single ebook.
If you are a reader who loves fantasy and have not read the Sword of Shannara series you are missing out. Terry Brooks is an amazing writer. I learned to love reading and writing by reading books like this. I read this when I was 10 years old and loved it. I still find it a fantastic read today!Tom Ryker (author - http://tomryker.com/)
Need to re-read
parts of this were incredibly dry and boring. the parts that weren't were amazing. can't wait to read part 3.
yep I just couldn't get into the second book. I really didn't make it to far. I have better things to read. :(
