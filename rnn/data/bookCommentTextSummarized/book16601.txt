My Video Review:https://youtu.be/7ftK1cYyTwo
From the classy literature books (the classics) to the crummy excuses of children's novels thrown into the public libraries to con young readers into believing that they possess quality my reading has been deep and varied.
The story follows two brothers who have run away to Venice and end up in the company of a group of juvenile thieves living in an abandoned cinema.
As one reads on one realises that perhaps these thieves are not quite the rogues they would have you believe.
In order to gain power the two brothers run away and the group of thieves hide out in the abandoned cinema away from the confines of the law.
THIS IS ONE OF MY ALL TIME FAVOURITE BOOKS!I love the characters, the world, the story. Scipio was like one of my first book crushes lmao. Seriously, this book is so exciting and fun and has such a great cast of characters who all have such genuine, important friendships and it's magical and beautiful could not recommend it highly enough. It's like Six of Crows except they live in a movie theatre and they are all like 12KINDA wanna reread it again now its just the BEST
SPOILER ALERTI hate hate hate it when a book introduces magic 3/4ths of the way through! I like fantasy, thats not the problem. But the ordinary people are supposed to discover the magic at the beginning of the book. You know, the children run through a mysterious old house in the country, hide in a wardrobe, and bam! they're in Narnia. Perfect. Don't try and tell me a realistic story and then suddenly change/solve everything with magic that the characters just accept and move on. I was adoring this book until that point.
They are taken in by a group of street children who live in an abandoned movie theater - the Stella, and are led by a proud orphan named Scipio.
Victor recognizes the boys on the street and manages to initiate a conversation with innocent little Bo. Bo accidentally lets slip that he lives in an old movie theater.
When the rest of the children see Victor, they cause a distraction and run away, taking his wallet with them.
آن‌ها از دست‌ خاله‌ و شوهر خاله‌ ی خود که‌ میخواهند دو برادر را از هم‌ جدا كنند، به‌ شهر «ونيز» ايتاليا میگریزند.
Still, bonus points for Venice!There was a little bit of thieving, but it was more desperate, the group of kids scraping by while living in an abandoned movie theater.
It honestly took me a while to warm up to it, until the second half when the focus shifted away from their sparse lives and into more of an adventure - what I'd been expecting in the first place.There's a little bit of magic to it towards the end, enough to shake things up.
I'd probably give it 2 stars, given how much I don't usually enjoy contemporary, realistic stories.
It's a great fantasy: Let's run away to Venice, and hide out in an old movie theater.
We can dye our hair blonde, so no one will ever find us!
In a way, this is a European version of From the Mixed-Up Files of Mrs. Basil E.
Frankweiler, with siblings running away to a place stuffed with antiquities, and getting mixed up in an art mystery.
I guess Victor the detective must have the Mrs. Frankweiler role.I didn't expect the touch of fantasy at the end.
I'd love to read a sequel to find out what happened to the Thief Lord.
How reductive should authors of children's lit be?I've been working with a young student this summer, and The Thief Lord, by Cornelia Funke, is a big favorite on the sixth grade circuit.
This particular boy had chosen it for summer reading, and so I picked up a copy for myself.Enh.Billed as a "fantastical journey" through "the magical underworld of Venice, Italy", The Thief Lord follows a pair of orphaned boys on the run from their condescending aunt.
Especially the grumpy grown-ups.Even as a cultural piece (Venice!), the novel falls short.
I have to stick to my philosophy that “life is too short to push yourself to read books you’re not into.” I think most people can agree with that.
So many books, so little time, you know?Really, I don’t have much to say.
And once I realized that nearly every chapter focused on Prosper and Bo, I wasn’t into it.There’s nothing wrong with this book.
Therefore, I’m going to chalk this up as a “me” thing, because I can see many people enjoying this.I know this is a short review, but I don’t have anything else to say.
Ach wie süß!Ich habe das Buch schon einmal als Kind gelesen, aber ehrlich gesagt konnte ich mich nur noch an den Anfang erinnern und wusste sonst nur noch schemenhaft worum es ging.
Die Geschichte rund um Prosper, Bo, Wespe, dem Herrn der Diebe und den anderen, werden wohl viele von euch schon kennen 😁.Ich finde sie einfach süß!
Ich glaube "Herr der Diebe" war damals mein zweites Buch der Autorin, denn den Drachenreiter habe ich vorher gelesen 🤔.
Auf jeden Fall kann ich euch die Bücher der Autorin nur empfehlen, egal wie alt ihr seid 😁.
I did watch the movie before the book so that made things worst but I was hoping not.The last time I remember reading Cornelia Funke was when my mom go shopping in the nearby mall for 4 hours and I wait like a lap dog.
Seriously, I'm very disappointed to Funke but I'm not yet done with her and I might try her other YA or children's books which will be nice raw (by reading reviews out of control).When Prosper and Bo escaped from their cruel rich aunt they met this group of kids who helped and cared by the Thief Lord, which fed them and act like a grown man.
3.5La prosa y las ilustraciones de Cornelia Funke nos mueven por los callejones de una Venecia que tan pronto parece un escenario real como el pasaje de un cuento. Lo mismo sucede con la trama: algunos elementos, como [RESEÑA COMPLETA]

By the time I hit chapter 45 out of 52, my interest in the plot started fizzling out.The characters are well-drawn, but there’s not much development or growth shown over the course of the story.
The plot takes place within a modern setting, but a fantastical element is thrown in kind of randomly.
It feels out of place and there’s a lot of exposition surrounding it.
The setting is great, with some nice details thrown into the action and descriptions.
This book is a decent children’s story that entertains, but it's not a classic.I think I had started this one years ago, back when I was younger, and never finished.
As it is, it's being kept from a disappointed-2-stars currently by remembering that I liked it most of the time and by pretending there's a missing chapter afterward.
don't read]: (view spoiler)[Scipio tracks down the merry-go-round and fixes it just long enough to turn his proper age again.
(hide spoiler)] That's what happens in the chapter that doesn't exist, after the end, which I maintain should/could happen.
*folds arms stubbornly*)Basically other than a couple discontentments about the ending ((view spoiler)[specifically, Scipio being semi-grown-up...
Somewhat disappointed, but I can pretend a missing chapter continuing the ending, so.
This was a cute read. Kind of a mix between Peter Pan/Robin Hood/Oliver Twist. I thought the magical aspect would run heavier in the story than it did. I enjoyed running around on the streets of Venice with these kids, seeing it through their eyes.
Absolute 5 Sterne! Eine unglaublich schöne Geschichte, mit viel Emotionen Witz und voll mit Liebe. Ich habe es als Hörbuch gehört es wurde so schön erzählt und die Musik zwischen den Kapiteln hat das ganze noch wirklicher erscheinen lassen. :) auf Cornelia Funke ist einfach immer Verlass!
Ultimately I'd probably opt for 3 and 1/2, but since that's not an option, I'll go with four because I think it's more of a personal taste thing over the quality of the book.I'm a huge fan of "Inkheart" so had high hopes for this novel.
The plot was interesting, but I did feel that there were two stories/plots going on, and that the first half of the book wasn't quite the same as the second half.Also, I'm not entirely sure what I think of the ending, the "messages" etc.
(again, back to the personal taste thing)I did enjoy the book, and was curious to learn how it would end.
I read The Thief Lord two years back when I was in Venice for skiing holiday. The book is excellent, and combined with the right surroundings I was smitten. Venice in the winter is misty and dreamy, and when we walked around the city, I could almost see the Thief Lord running around with his friends, cunningly planning their theft, getting more and more mixed up in the plots of grown-ups around them. Funke's storytelling is wonderful, her characters believable, and, for a children's book, The Thief Lord is stunningly good.
still such a brilliant book reading as an adult.I love the imagination and beauty of this bookAH SO GOOD.I hope Cornelia continues writing beautiful stories like this.
What a wonderful story!My favorite character, aside from the kids, is Venice herself.
Cornelia Funke has weaved her story so brilliantly in a gorgeous setting, describing the city as if it had its own personality.
I imagined it a bit like August Rush and his hideout.
Cornelia Funke has also created some action scenes that made my heart rush and my eyes read several lines at once, just because I couldn't wait to find out what would happen next.Truly, though, the gold nugget lies with the story's characters.
Beautiful characters, with fun personalities.The only problem that I sort of have with the book is the near ending, where the plot twist happens.
Percayalah padaku.Mereka sudah lupa semuanya.Betapa dunia dahulu berkesan lebih besar bagi mereka.Betapa repotnya memanjat ke atas kursi.Bagaimana rasanya kalau harus selalu menengadah?Lupa.Mereka tidak tahu lagi.Kau pun akan melupakannya.Kadang-kadang orang dewasa bercerita, betapa indahnyaketika mereka masih anak-anak.Mereka bahkan bermimpi menjadi anak-anak lagi.Tetapi apa yang mereka mimpikan ketika masih anak-anak?Tahukan kau?Aku rasa, mereka bermimpi ingin cepat-cepat dewasa.Kata-kata ini mengawali kisah yang terjalin di buku ini.
Kota yang selalu mereka ingin datangi dan mimpikan hanya dengan mendengar cerita ttg Venezia dari sang Ibunda.Kehidupan Prosper & Bo berubah saat di Venezia mereka bertemu dengan Riccio, Mosca & Tawon serta Scipio yang selalu menyebut dirinya Pangeran Pencuri.
Set in the streets of Venice, this book has it all: Italian culture, street savvy kids, the Robin Hood-like notion of stealing from the rich to give to the poor, all the while echoing a sort of Les Miserables-like Griviche type thing.Everybody loves a gang of orphans!
Two new boys are taken in by the gang, which also means a private detective (sort of a Lou Grant a la Mary Tyler Moore character, gruff on outside but totally soft on the edges), trails them from afar, one espresso at a time.There are specialty shops all around the place, fountains, marble and antiques, mansions and canals, and of course, that romantic run down movie house as a back drop.
I was always generally healthy, which didn't serve me well when my body and mind seemed to break apart gradually but ever so steadily.
I needed to let my mind run far elsewhere, but fear kept drawing me back..
until I picked up The Thief Lord (and Harry Potter again <3)This book follows two orphaned brothers, Prosper and Bo, who ran away to Venice, the enchanted land that their mother spoke about in her night time stories, in order to stay together.
And because it's quite a short book, I couldn't get deep back stories from all of them, but they each made a strong impression to fuel my imagination.
This book is so good, what a wonderful mix of reality and fantasy! I enjoyed it a lot, even though adventure is not my favourite genre. My favourite character is Scipio, let's applaud him for how much he has changed :)
Penggambaran sungai yang dipenuhi gondola, jalanan selayak labirin, dan patung/bangunan museum di Venesia, menjadi latar yang sangat mendukung petualangan Prosper-Bo bersama Pangeran Pencuri dan kawan-kawan.
Venesia, kota ajaib yang selalu didongengkan sang ibu menjadi tujuan mereka, meski tidak ada sanak saudara.
Luntang-luntung di Venesia mempertemukan Prosper-Bo dengan gadis cilik bernama Tawon, dan mengajak mereka bergabung serta tinggal di sebuah gedung bioskop tak terpakai.
Prosper-Bo pun akhirnya berkenalan dengan sosok Pangeran Pencuri.Petualangan dalam buku ini sebenarnya tidak terlalu “wah” tapi menyimpan pesan yang dalam.
I loved this book as a kid. ❤
The Thief Lord, by Cornelia Funke, is a fantasy novel about a two orphaned kids.
After being told Prosper, a boy around twelve years of age, and his younger brother, Bo, were going to be separated through adoption, they run away to Venice, Italy.
The children learn the dark truth of the Thief Lord, and how he came to be, and they find something powerful that will change their lives forever.
Then this one little thing happens that changes the whole book, from the children having a pretty simple and quiet life, to much running and excitement.
