He was Han Seldon, the last great scientist of the First Empire, and it was he who perfected psychohistory-the science of human behavior reduced to mathematical equations»The story so far: a large part of the galaxy is under is controlled by the Foundation, and the Seldon Plan, in place for 500 years, is perfectly progressing.
Erano secoli che si stava sgretolando e disfacendo, e solo un uomo si rendeva pienamente conto della cosa.
Un Isaac Asimov più maturo, che distribuisce a destra e a manca fantascientifiche teorie di colonizzazione dell'Universo sempre più convincenti e stuzzicanti.
First published in 1982 almost 30 years after the last volume of the iconic original Foundation Trilogy, namely Second Foundation, I was skeptical that Asimov would be able to maintain his mojo post the Golden Age of Science Fiction when he was publishing his most iconic sci-fi stories and novels.
It is also lovely to see the robots and their “Three Laws” worked into the Foundation universe, plus a clever explanation for the absence of aliens in the Foundation universe.Asimov is often criticized for his utilitarian prose and thin characters (the same criticisms leveled toward most Golden Age authors).
Christmas 2010: I realised that I had got stuck in a rut. I was re-reading old favourites again and again, waiting for a few trusted authors to release new works. Something had to be done.On the spur of the moment I set myself a challenge, to read every book to have won the Locus Sci-Fi award. That’s 35 books, 6 of which I’d previously read, leaving 29 titles by 14 authors who were new to me.While working through this reading list I got married, went on my honeymoon, switched career and became

was one of the six winning books I had previously read before I began my Locus Quest.The first time I read the Foundation series as an awe-struck pre-teen, I’d have instantly given the whole series a 5-star review: it was a story that became a foundation stone (excuse the pun) of my love for sci-fi.
Let's get this out of the way: Asimov's Foundation series is required reading for anyone with more than a passing interest in science fiction.
مجموعهٔ بنیاد نام مجموعهای ۷ جلدی از آیزاک آسیموف است که مشهورترین مجموعهٔ علمی-تخیلی خوانده شدهاست. داستان این مجموعه به ترتیب زمان انتشار پیش نمیرود، بلکه آسیموف ابتدا جلدهای سوم (بنیاد)، چهارم(بنیاد و امپراطوری) و پنجم (بنیاد دوم) را نوشت و سپس با وقفهای طولانی مدت و بر اثر اصرار خوانندگان جلدهای ششم (لبه بنیاد) و هفتم (بنیاد و زمین) را به آن افزود. پس از آن با وقفهای نسبتاً طولانی جلد اول مجموعه (سرآغاز بنیاد) و در نهایت نیز اندکی پیش از مرگش جلد دوم (پیشبرد بنیاد) را نوشتهاست.

Digamos que solo deja de meterse tanto con los problemas sociales y nos adentramos más a una aventura espacial mientras el Plan de Hari Seldon está a mitad de camino.Como siempre, este Plan se ve amenazado por alguna disputa y/o pensamiento desviado y ahora para prevenir la catástrofe se debe enderezar el camino.
Y como siempre, la resolución final es contundente, imaginativa e ingeniosa al mismo tiempo, lo que hace del libro una experiencia increíble de forma redonda.
Ha sido muy interesante y te deja con muchas ganas de leer Fundación y Tierra...es una pena que no lo encontrara en la Feria del Libro.
This one, like the second, also operates in secrecy in order to achieve its goals, and so *again* Asimov comes back to ignorance as a key to solving problems created by knowledge, and that just seems like a huge betrayal of the principles he seems to be trying to embrace.
Although written much later than the original Foundation trilogy, this book in my opinion is on a par with them. Not only is it a great story, well written as ever by Asimov, but after having read the Foundation novels, the Robot novels and the Empire novels (some many times), you realise how cleverly this book starts to bring everything together the way Asimov intended.
[2018]Questo è l'unico libro di Asimov che ho riletto, una ventina di anni dopo la prima volta, con sensazioni miste, non prive di una certa delusione. In seguito, ho pensato che fosse meglio tenersi stretti i ricordi - vaghi ma meravigliosi - delle prime letture quindicenni.[1987]Quarto capitolo della trilogia della fondazione, questo libro prende in considerazione un tempo meno lungo della storia galattica asimoviana.[2010]Le tre stelle sono la media tra le quattro della prima e le due della seconda lettura.
4.0 to 4.5 stars. Excellent book, but not as good as the original trilogy. Winner: Hugo Award for Best Science Fiction Novel (1983)Winner: Locus Award for Best Science Fiction Novel (1983)Nominee: Nebula Award for Best Science Fiction Novel (1983)
:)Having written this much later in life (early 1980s, 32 years after the publication of the previous Foundation book Second Foundation), Asimov's writing style seems to have had improved than from the 1950s.
However, I was glad to see those embedded themes, and the series' integration with Asimov's other series of his books.Some of my questions which I had conceived while reading the original trilogy were particularly attended to by the author, for which I am glad, such as the question of Earth in the Galactic Empire's History, and the possibility of other life-forms.
These concepts have now been well-integrated.Now on to the next in the series: Foundation and Earth :)
You might think that would be enough to give Socrates a headache, but, as the master storyteller he always was, Asimov keeps you hanging on every unexpected but perfectly reasoned turn of plot.By "logical argument" I mean a warring of intensely bright minds trying to one-up each other's motivations and uncover the structure behind a constantly reorganizing viewpoint of political and social organization.
The Foundation believes that the secretive Second Foundation has been exterminated, but we (of course) know that it still lurks on the former Empire home world of Trantor, controlling the unfolding fate of the galaxy through subtle but benevolent mind-tuning.
It is really amazing that got me with lot of surprises. I knew something from the second book and I given the task to theorise that I was right and it was. I think for book fair on October I'm going to buy the other books. Damn, I'd like to ask much questions to Asimov, but that's maybe in other life when I die. xD ha ha ha. Let's go for the fifth!
How wrong I was.This is quite possibly my favourite of the Foundation novels so far, not including the early robot/Lije Baley books, it would have received 5 stars if it was for the final three parts of the story letting it down with its wishy washy 'communing with nature' nonsense.
The great news is that you don't need to have read the preceding 13 books in the Foundation universe to enjoy this one, the self-contained storyline works completely for once and can be enjoyed by newcomers to the series and old fans alike.
Sort of brick-like sequel to the earlier Foundation books.One can read and enjoy this book and the one that comes after it and as a pair they serve to tie the Foundation series back to the Bailey/robot books.
They take the Foundation idea in a slightly different direction by introducing a factor and the possibility of a factor outside of the original psychohistorical calculations made by Seldon.
Which rather renders the original stories superfluous.
The drive of late Azimov to completeness and neatness, tying all of his stories together into one superbundle is accomplished at the cost of the integrity and cleverness of those original stories from the 40s and 50s.
Think about it: The Mayor wouldn't even have thought to look at Seyshell if Gaia hadn't have orchestrated events to have Trevise go there, and the Second Foundation wouldn't even have had to the inclination to deal with the new physical power of the Foundation if the Gaian's hadn't have, again, revealed themselves to the Second Foundation by interfering with a corrected Seldon Plan.
If anything, the Gaian's should have destroyed the mentalic shields of the First Foundation as an apology for destroying the whole Seldon Plan by shrugging of responsibility for The Mule.
Needless to say, when the First Foundation becomes aware of the Second Foundation, they hate the idea of being guided and manipulated – they want to be able to direct their own course, instead of being puppets to the “shadow government” of the Second Foundation.In this, the four book in the series, Golan Trevise, Councilman of the First Foundation is sent on a mission, ostensibly to find the legendary Earth (supposed home of humanity as the planet on which we first developed), but in reality to seek out the Second Foundation so that they can be destroyed forever.
Less a dramatic history and more of a suspense/mystery tale, Foundation's Edge focuses on Councilman of the Foundation Golan Trevize whose conspiracy theories concerning the existence of the Second Foundation get him in a lot of trouble.
Two mysteries intertwine and combine in a wonderfully new direction for the Foundation series that leaves so many more questions than before.I loved the brilliant new twist to this storyline comes in Golan's companion, Historian Jan Pelorat, a fringe academic who believes, astonishingly, that human beings, now spread over millions of habitable planets across the galaxy, actually originated on a single planet: Earth.
Görüşümü saptıran sebepler şunlar olabilir:1) Bu kitap diğerlerinin aksine bir ereader'da okundu, içinde bir teknoloji iması taşıyan bir üslubun insanı haliyle daha bir bilimkurgu sever kılması olası.2) Bu kitap vakıf serisinin çekirdeğini oluşturan üç kitaptan neredeyse yirmi yıl sonra yazıldı.
Bunun yanında, sadece bir eseri -bu dil ingilizce olsa bile- orjinal dilinde okuyor olmak kibrimi okşamıştır, sonra bu kibri daha hayırlı bir yöne sevketmiş, kitabın dilinin bende yaşattığı komik gururu kitaba dair bir beğeniye dönüştürmüş olabilirim.5) Bir seriden 6 kitap okuyunca, harcadığınız zamanın boşa gitmediğini düşünmek için, seriyi en nihayetinde sevmeye başladığınıza inanmak zorundasınız.Sözün özü, kitabı cidden beğendim, keyifle okudum, ama Asimov'dur yani, bu derece beğenmemem gerekirdi.
Gaia ahh gaia...Bir kitapta finali okurken kafamdaki kurgu tutsun ya. Çok sey mi istiyorum. 😊Heyecanla ilerliyorum bakalım.
Of course you did.How unfortunate for you, as people - even future people - love a conspiracy theory and will hold to it with incredible tenacity even to the point of making a second attempt at eradicating the Second Foundation the key plot point of yet another novel by Asimov.
(If you are curious, I have been tracking Asimov's unconscious attitudes toward women across all of his novels and noting his growth in that area.) This female mayor, Branno, and a few others are believers in the conspiracy of the continued existence of the Second Foundation and wish to eliminate the Second Foundation.
The characters feel a bit livelier and there are far more descriptions around technologies and the galaxy.
Half the book is spent on the lame romantic adventure of a speaker and some barbarian woman that had no purpose in the plot.
[/SPOILER] Seriously, this is all that happens in this book and you have probably seen every single one of those ideas a thousand times by now in some Star Trek episode with more plot and interesting characters.
And damn it was fun to read how people in this galaxy have no idea of what robots are.
He and his accompanying professor ‘Janov Pelorat’, discover many mysteries of human history, following Pelorat’s belief in an original human planet.Meanwhile ‘Speaker Gendibal’, who can be seen as Trevize’s opposite number, has been expelled from the Second Foundation, to track down Trevize and stop him discovering the Second Foundation.
Remember that the mind controlling and universe steering Second Foundation is completely secret and unknown to the First Foundation guys.Various other interesting characters are introduced, and eventually all parties are heading towards a mysterious planet called Gaia.
Great stuff though.An nice and unexpected ending for me.A story of galactic pursuit, discovery, secrets and mind control!
Isaac Asimov returns to the Foundation series some 30 years later, bringing with him some good twine to reel in his other series (Robots and Empire).
I found the schemes inferior to the earlier trilogy, and some of the connections to Robots tenuous.I can completely understand Asimov's fans and publishers clamoring to hear more of the 1000 year interregnum period - the original trilogy covered less than 400 of those years.
Well, everything in the book.
This was a good example of way so many people get turned off by sci-fi and think that you can't have entertaining narratives that are scientifically accurate.
Stereotyped, single dimensional characters and don't even get me started on the portrayal of women - in one scene a university professor's wife leaves the dining room because she's offended by the topic of conversation.
(hide spoiler)] But none of the are really as well developed as the two-dimensional male characters.
Oh well, I still have one more of these Foundation books to read.
Some say that the two books he wrote later in the Foundation story aren't as good as those that he wrote in the 50's.
Don't believe it, this is every bit as good as the best of the original trilogy.
Why wait another 500 years?
Only the Second Foundation can possibly stand in their way...or is there something else?The second time I've read this book and I very much enjoyed it as I did the first time.
Now I can't wait to re-read the conclusion to the Foundation saga: Foundation and Earth.
I'm reasonably sure I've read this before but so long ago that I forgot a lot of it. In any case Asimov is always a pleasure to read. Asimov is still considered one of the three great masters of Science Fiction. Sometimes I just need a break from Mt. Readmore and want to read a book reliably good. Asimov often fills the bill in that case. In this case, we find there are organizations involved besides just the First and Second Foundations. But are there other extra organization(s) involved or not? To be continued.....

My favorite of the Foundation series so far. They just keep getting better!
Štvrtý diel sa konečne dostal z osídiel Seldonovho plánu a už predvídateľných kríz a ich riešení. Celé to dostáva nový náboj a doslova vesmírne rozmery. Obrovský oblúk Asimovových kníh cez tisícročia vyráža dych. Jediná výhrada, ktorú mám, je obrovská rola individuálnych hrdinov a ich činov. Myslím, že história je omnoho menej psychologická a omnoho viac sociologická, ale taký scifi román by sa samozrejme ťažko písal a ešte horšie čítal.
Con questo sequel Asimov dimostra tutta la sua bravura. Tirare fuori un'altra trama avvincente, per di più non contemplata durante la stesura della prima saga, e renderla comunque originale è da maestri.
