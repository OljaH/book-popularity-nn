I'm glad to see this reissued! I had my mother's old cloth-bound copy, a greenish color with a simple drawing in gold of the two children. This was my favorite in Perkins "Twins" series. Each book has a different pair of kids in a different place and time. Each book provides a little historical education, a touch of moral lesson, and some adventures. They are pretty easy to under stand so parents can read aloud to child who aren't up to chapter books yet.
I borrowed a lot of the Twins books from the library in the 1970's, but I had completely forgotten about this one. Re-reading it now is interesting, but I don't think I'd recommend for family reading--I think some people would find it a bit heavy on gods and omens.
My favorite of Perkins' charming, if dated, "Twins" books for young readers. Felipe and Carlos make much mischief in the Spanish countryside.
I love the twins series. they are so interesting.
