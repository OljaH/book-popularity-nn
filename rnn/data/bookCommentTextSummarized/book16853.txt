I love the movie, but if you think that was sappy, do not pick up this book.
The book was so frustratingly simple and obvious and laid out.
I'll come back and add a real quote, but it was something like this:"Do you want to stay for dinner?" he asked, wondering what she would say."Okay," she said, and than asked, "What should we eat?""Crabs," he said.
She never had crabs.
They began to cook the crabs...
Could the book be any more contrived and gimicky?
Unless you like getting dumber by the minute, don't pick this one up.
I’m just gonna say it: I expected less.Not being inexperienced in the reading of Nicholas Sparks novels, I somewhat knew this book would contain tons and tons of corny and cheesy replies and gestures.
Moreover, when Noah sees Allie again, she is engaged to a super rich attorney.
That super rich attorney, to whom I forgot the name of, is madly stressed out when he discovers that Allie has been with Noah the whole time she claimed to needing time to make some purchases in a specific city.
Noah is an angel, how can anyone despise him?And finally, the mother.
I was unfortunate enough to be forced to buy it because there were no other English Language novels to choose from.I know this is a beloved book, by a beloved author, but if I could give it any sort of negative rating, I would.
Esh - I was sorely disappointed.My favorite memory is reading the scene between the two young (and I'm assuming attractive) lovers...they are in a boat on a lake, romantic setting, yes?
He starts to comment, "Oh, they're on the lake in a boat...okay, it's raining...oh geeze, why do you girls read this crap?"And that's what I think about this book...why would anyone read this (unless there were no other choices)?!?
This is the worst book I have EVER READ.
And the fact that this guy is so popular continues to astound me.
My sister tricked me into reading this book, and I wish I could gain that time back into my life so I could read a different book.
This book teaches you that ANYONE could write a bestseller.
As you can tell, I don't read shit that I think I won't like.
I have rated many books as a 4 or 5, and this book pisses me off to no end because it had the audacity to waste my time as a reader.
Have you ever come across something so undeniably cute that you feel like you may be crushed by the weight of squee that’s about to explode from you chest.Kind of like when you see this?That’s what reading The Notebook was like.
Similarly, in The Notebook, the long, romantic verses filled with poetry and stunning imagery will ultimately become tiresome the longer you read it.Probably it’s just me.
If you’re a sentimental, sweet kind of person (two adjectives nobody has ever applied to me) then I’m sure you’d like this book and it would do you justice.
4 Stars -  Also reviewed at: Lady Jayne's Reading Den Sweet and romantic, but I liked the movie much more. In fact, I LOVED the movie and watched it before reading this. In the movie, the characters of Noah and Allie had more intensity and passion. It is one of those rare moments, for me, when the movie was better than the book.There are some great quotes in this book though. These were my favourite:"I am a common man with common thoughts, and I've led a common life. There are no monuments dedic
In fact, I LOVED the movie and watched it before reading this.
There are no monuments dedicated to me and my name will soon be forgotten, but I've loved another with all my heart and soul, and to me, this has always been enough.""We sit silently and watch the world around us.
For me, love like that has only happened once, and that's why every minute we spent together has been seared in my memory.
It's going to be really hard; we're gonna have to work at this everyday, but I want to do that because I want you.
everyday.""I love you.
quite possibly the sweetest love story ever. I wept like a baby.
Seriously, what the fuck was this?
People who don't like this book have never truely been loved, because if you have it hits home.Here are a few of my favorite quotes from the book:"I am a common man with common thoughts, and I've led a common life.
There are no monuments dedicated to me and my name will soon be forgotten, but I've loved another with all my heart and soul, and to me, this has always been enough." "We sit silently and watch the world around us.
It draws people together because only those who are comfortable with each other can sit without speaking."
كالعادة نيكولاس سباركس يطلع لينا لسانهويقولضحكت عليكم وثبتكمالراجل دا ليه بيعمل معانا كدا؟؟ليه عاوزا
Vanessa bought me this book after I watched Fracture and developed a serious crush on Ryan Gosling. Well, that led me to this movie and, unfortunately, this book. How does this man have a career as a writer?! Who is paying him to write stories with the most obvious choices in plot/dialogue/decisions. Wow. Lowest common denominator.
I read this book because my sister loved it.
Not because it was a sad story, but because it was so poorly written.
This Sparks character had a fantastic idea for a story, a truly painful and passionate story of love and devotion.
But the book?
It was like my 14 year old nephew watched this brilliant movie, then tried to write about it on his myspace blog.
Sad. The fact that so many people are willing to overlook Sparks' lack of creativity and inability to, well, write, is also sad.
Sad, I say.
Sad, I say.
I loved this book!!!
I would recommend it to anyone, and it's by far the best romance book I've ever read.
I just watched the movie, and that was really good too!
And like my eighth grade English teacher said, it included everything that was in the book, which is really rare!
I don't know which I liked better; the book or the movie!
Maybe the book, but only because you get to see how hard it is for Allie to decide who she really wants to be with-Noah or Lon. Either way, everyone should read the book and watch the movie!
What?!It irritated me to no end that Sparks felt the need to not leave anything unexplained, describing things in excruciating detail, boring me but more so putting me off reading any of his other books.
His voice is kind of suited for the old Noah but his imitation of a young Allie is just really off-putting.
Plus, he's got that kind of voice that makes me want to fall asleep straight away.
Combine that with the terrible style and plot, this book can only be described as indigestible.
You love to groan as the plot points are written in big crayon pages before they appear, roll your eyes at the overwrought descriptions of love, and wince at Trio of Terrible Writing, Cardboard Characters, and Zero Subtlety.Guess which one I was?This book was bad; bad as in "so good it's bad" category.
I guess you can give Sparks credit for being able to write a concept that would make a good movie, but when I read a book, I have certain criteria: namely characters, plot, writing.
The Notebook (The Notebook #1), Nicholas Sparksتاریخ نخستین خوانش: هشتم فوریه سال 2000 میلادیعنوان: دفتر خاطرات ؛ نویسنده: نیکولاس اسپارکس؛ مترجم: نفیسه معتکف؛ مشخصات نشر: تهران، لیوسا، 1378، در 213 ص، شابک: 9645634032؛ موضوع: داستانهای نویسندگان امریکایی قرن 20 ممهدی سجودی مقدم نیز تحت عنوان: دفترچه خاطرات (و با عنوان فرعی: شورِ عشق) کتاب را ترجمه و توسط انتشارات مهراندیش منتشر شدهرمانی عاشقانه است از نیکلاس اسپارکس، که براساس داستانی واقعی نوشته شده.
اگرچه نوا تلاش می‌کند پس از جدایی نیز با آلی ارتباط داشته باشد، نامه‌ هایش بی‌ پاسخ می‌ماند.
عاقبت نوآ در آخرین نامه‌ اش به عشق جاودان و نامیرایش اعتراف می‌کند.
نوآ به شمال سفر می‌کند تا شغلی مناسب پیدا کند، و یاد و خاطره آلی را از یاد ببرد، و عاقبت به جنگ می‌رود.
Here's the deal: it's an old guy at the end of his life, showing how undyingly committed and in love he is with his elderly wife, who is dying of Alzheimer's.
There is no way you can go wrong picking a life partner if you are horny and running away from responsibility and commitment, as this book clearly shows.
That is the only way to find a man who will love you and change your diapers for you when you get old.Okay, so he wasn't changing her diapers, but you get the point.
Does such true love really exist? Nicholas Sparks, all I can tell is that your wife Cathy has been lucky to marry you!I cried like a baby.Yes, true love will return to you, maybe not in a very perfect condition, maybe with a fiancee, maybe not with a good heart, but surely it'll return.
Also song lyrics.)BoredomThe yawns set in big time once we got into the Twoo Luv story of how Allie decides to cheat on her fiancé by looking up her old boyfriend, making sure her dress gets REALLY WET so that her nipples stand out like hard little diamonds or something, and then rubbing her hands all over Noah's chest.
Only to be bounced back by an even MORE clichéd scene involving Mom and, I swear I'm not making this up, the words Follow Your Heart.DepressionAnd then the story jumps forward half a century and everyone's dying which SHOULD cheer me up, given what I think about these two, but in fact it reminds me that all Twoo Luv stories pretty much end this way.
RESEÑA EN EL BLOG: https://bookstwins.wordpress.com/2018...Es el primer libro que leo de Nicholas Sparks y debo decir que me sorprendió.
Los protagonistas ya desde jovenes toman muy enserio en amor que se sienten y por esto la historia se diferencian de otras porque no hay caprichos sino que es un amor maduro.A lo largo del libro vemos como tienen que superar los obstaculos para poder estar juntos.
Lo que más me gustó fue como los superan pues demuestra la seriedad de la historia.
I remember really loving the miracle aspect of the novel, of how Sparks thought that miracles really do happen, of hoping I’d encounter a miracle myself and be forced to believe the same.
But I loved reading the very realistic concerns of an old man groping over his upcoming death, reminiscing his long life and feeling ancient – they felt real and believable, as if the author himself had such thoughts bothering him.
(If you haven't read the book, be aware that rest of this review will contain spoilers.) When the main character's love for his wife of forty-nine years triumphs even through Alzheimer's relentless blanket of memories, I was inspired.
Allie too is taken in by their wonder, and little by little we get to know each other again.My goal is to say and truly believe that line in the middle every day: "This is the pinnacle of my life." That is the best lesson of the novel: to find happiness in simply being alive and appreciating the beauty and love around us.(What?
Los amores verdaderos son los que pasan las pruebas mas tremendas.Esta es una verdadera historia de amor.La película es hermosa, aunque no es 100% fiel al libro.
1 star In a Word : boring Initial thoughts *Opens book**Reads book**Wonders if watching paint dry might actually be more exciting**Closes book**Yawns* The Story We’ve all seen the movie right? So it's that... but with all the emotion sucked out of it. Pros The beauty of lifetime love was represented in this story. The kind of love that leaves you falling in love with that person every day no matter what life brings your way. Like, real life love.  Cons The romance was a snooze fest.So here’s wha
Like the kind of ugly emotional kissing where you can’t tell whose tears are whose or where your soul ends and his begins.
I expected to be rendered an utter emotional mess by this book!This is not what I gotI don’t know if it’s Spark’s writing style or the perspective of the story or what.
I wanted to be heartbroken and feel struggle and longing and pain and really and truly the only emotion I felt was boredom.It went beyond meh and into the realm of “Please make it stop I can’t handle the extreme nothingness of this book anymore”.
I would suggest watching the movie and maybe using the book as a doorstop.
کلیشه و دیگر هیچ
Nicholas Sparks has created a poignant story about two people who try to recapture the love they once shared despite the passage of time.Noah Calhoun is a simple boy with simple dreams.
However, circumstances pull them apart for over 14 years and they are faced with trying to find a way to get back what they once had.I enjoyed the story, but I feel the author could have spent a little more time telling the readers about Noah and Allie’s reunion and a little more of what they went through to make a life for themselves.
4.5⭐⭐⭐⭐Stars I actually liked that I watched the movie before reading the book (I know I am shocked lol 😂). The narrator was on point and made me feel a lot. I might have fell asleep with teary eyes or with waterfalls... Same difference whatever lol 🙄🤔😒😂 hahaha Listening to the audio copy, I can't stop picturing Ryan Gosling 😝
De las pocas historias en las que puedo afirmar que la película es mejor que el libro mismo.
A good buy, a lucky buy, and I've learned that not everyone can say that about his life."A living poem" had always been the words that came to mind when he tried to describe her to others.Our lives can't be measured by our final years, of this I am sure.We sit silently and watch the world around us.
But most of all, I learned that life is about sitting on benches next to ancient creeks with my hand on her knee and sometimes, on god days, for falling in love.It is life, I think, to watch the water.
I have, in my lifetime, come across so few people that I can honestly say the following about "Straight to a fault".
Mr. Sparks steals the cake in this book.
Not only does he play up to every hopelessly/sappily romantic notion pop-culture has ever churned out for women over the age of 10, he does this in a sexist/uber macho yet trying to come of as sweet but rough around the edges kind of way.
Oh male privilege....
The book was wholly unbelievable, trite and painful to read.
