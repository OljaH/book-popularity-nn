Read from time to time, just to keep in contact with real literature, which is something I really have to do considering my average books....Ogni tanto lo prendo e ne leggo qualcosa, giusto per restare in contatto con la vera letteratura, che Ã© qualcosa che mi manca, considerando la media dei libri che leggo....
Don't assume I know the stories as well as you do.So I continued reading the book, except I was now skipping the commentaries.
I call those "word soup." If I read the first paragraph three times and still have no idea what you are saying, I skip the story.
Like I said above, tastes are subjective, and I'm sure the stories were chosen because the editors understood the stories and decided they were hallmarks of classic literature.And then the book descends into five hundred pages or so of poetry.
Note to staff: the page count for this book is wrong. Not including the forward and indexes, the page count for this edition is 2165.This was a text book for an English course I took in while in university.
I read the book in a Theatre class I had in college. It was a very good read for the class. We had fun discussing it and reading aloud, which helped me understand and critique plays.
This was the first Literature Text I ever had to buy. I still find myself picking it up from time to time in order to find something to read.
i want to get the reference
Amazing...I love it. I periodically pick it up and just open it up and start reading....I actually have the Third Edition that was published in 1981 and it is 1968 pgs.
