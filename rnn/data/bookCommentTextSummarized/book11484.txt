As soon as I realised this was a love story (at about page one hundred and something), I remembered that Baldwin once wrote, in a letter to his nephew which can be found in "The Fire Next Time", words to the effect that it was love that helped his (and their) ancestors survive the brutality of White America / white people / Whiteness.
Love = survival.And that's what - I think - Baldwin tried to capture in this book.
I think it possible that people are being myopic about this.The title is a reference to "Beale Street Blues" by W.
I've never come across a Baldwin read I didn't love.
This book is very different from the lyricism that is Go Tell It on the Mountain and Giovanni's Room, but the love story and angst is Baldwinian.
What I'll say is this: in these times, when the truth is too harsh, and when it sometimes manifests itself into hateful rhetoric, as it did with Fonny's father, this book may not be for everyone.
The novel ends in a commune in France and if you know Baldwin's life story, you know at some point he became so disheartened, he left America to live in France.
Fucking hell. Reeling. I can't wait to see what Barry Jenkins does with the film adaptation.
A lyrical, rapturous, beautifully written short novel about love in the face of brutal injustice.Fonny and Tish are a young Black couple in early 1970s New York City.
Fonny has been falsely accused of raping a Puerto Rican woman and is in prison; Tish, who narrates most of the book, is pregnant.
Their families ‚Äì especially Tish's ‚Äì are working to get Fonny out of jail, but then, as now, the odds are stacked against a young Black man, especially when there's a racist cop looking to pin something on you.
My first read by Baldwin & now I know the reason why he's a renowned great writer.
The lesson, of course, is that it is not possible to walk a mile in another man's shoes (and therefore impossible to ever really know him), and therefore we should never judge.So if it is impossible to walk in another man's shoes, as an author James Baldwin gets us as close to this as is possible.
I've yet to come across a character in any of his novels that are cardboard cutouts of the characters they are portraying, and in this sad tale of two black families in New York City during the early '60s, you feel like you are sitting in the homes of these people as their tragedy is played out.This is the third Baldwin book I've read in the past year - I've thoroughly enjoyed all three.
It is the purest form and most glaring example in American History, to me, of resistance." - Reginald Cunningham from "Black Love is Revolutionary" via the Huffington Post (2017).A classic novel that showcases two participants in this revolution, Tish & Fonny.
A book that also lives up to its eponymous street through James Baldwin's effortlessly poetic prose, hard earned wisdom, and blues references to spare.I look forward to this novel, that centered Black people and Blackness, as a movie.
Barry Jenkins centered Black lives beautifully with his Academy Award winning Moonlight, and I look forward to him directing, what I hope will be, another Oscar winner.
Atrav√©s de constantes recuos ao passado das suas inf√¢ncias e a um passado mais recente, o leitor rapidamente de familiariza com a bonita hist√≥ria de amor dos dois, num texto que se destaca pela sua singela sensibilidade e pela forma aparentemente simples como relata um amor que parece capaz de vencer todos os obst√°culos.√â certo que a linguagem do amor √© algo universal e que o amor entre dois negros n√£o ser√° diferente de qualquer outro, mas ao colocar as personagens na Nova Iorque do in√≠cio dos anos 1970, a rela√ß√£o de Tish e Fonny √© inevitavelmente condicionada pelas repress√µes raciais ainda existentes, que amea√ßam o futuro risonho sonhado por ambos.Ainda que James Baldwin nos mostre situa√ß√µes que marcam pela revolta que suscitam no leitor, achei Se esta rua falasse um livro muito otimista.
‚ÄúTwas More Like Rap Gone BadI wanted to learn about Beale Street, and the blues, and the lives of the artists that lived there, but this book was about a man and a woman who had fallen in love.When reading the first three pages I saw the corner of a dark room,a home of a black friend‚Äôs friendor maybe I knew her too, butI don‚Äôt remember who she was,only that we went to the same church.Across the street from her housethere was a white picket fence, andI only knew that I was in Richmond.And then the image was gone,and I could not get it back.
She put on a Ray Charles record and sat on the sofa.I listened to the music and the sounds from the streets and Daddy's hand rested lightly on my hair.
And everything seemed connected--the street sounds, and Ray's voice and his piano and my Daddy's hand and my sister's silhouette and the sounds and the lights coming from the kitchen.
As someone had wondered, not, after all, so very long ago, about the eyes of Joseph, my father, whose hand rested on my head.
But this book is expertly written, and so I could read it, I could understand it just well enough, to not only recognize the horrifying dissonance of the black life in America - the one in which you are treated as an incomplete form of humanity while you and the small world of other black bodies that you are in know the contrary is entirely true - but to, beyond recognition, actually get a sense, for an instant or two, for less than 200 hundred pages, just what that dissonance can feel like, just how deeply it can cut, just how closely you can feel the freedoms and rights which don't exist, just how much hope there must be in a future of liberty.
No que toca ao g√©nero romance, este existe para todos os gostos, mas por norma tenho sempre prefer√™ncia por dois tipos: o indefinido, em que tanto a estrutura como a hist√≥ria fogem ao par√¢metro tradicional, e aqueles elevam a fasquia, mostrando-me realidades que de outra maneira me seriam desconhecidas.
Na minha opini√£o estamos perante um romance abismal sobre o amor, n√£o deixando de parte a viol√™ncia e a repress√£o inerente √† situa√ß√£o.O belo de Se esta rua falasse, incide precisamente nessa for√ßa avassaladora que √© o amor, descrevendo-o na inoc√™ncia e simplicidade na rela√ß√£o entre Tish e Fonny, mas tamb√©m descrevendo-o na for√ßa motriz necess√°ria para se lutar por aqueles que amamos.
I love James Baldwin.
What I enjoy about Baldwin is his unwillingness to sugar-coat anything while still remaining captivating.
You always get the feeling that Baldwin is speaking to you through his characters but it never seems like a wild case of writer-on-board syndrome.
For example, Aaron Sorkin, sometimes appears to be working out his issues through his characters.
Love him but sometimes it is so plainly obvious when a character stops being himself and starts being Sorkin.
I don't get that from Baldwin whose characters may act as mouthpieces but remain fully fleshed and distinctive.
MY GOD WHAT I'VE JUST READ !!!Brilliant , absolutely Brilliant is what I call this book.The story is about a Black young man charged with rape and trust me it's nothing like To kill a mocking bird & The hate U give .
but most importantly , this book is brilliant in the way he chose to end it .Beale Street talked something sexual & insightful after all .Will be reading a lot more James Baldwin this year , that's for sure.
Livra√ßo!!!
Finished this over the weekend and I'm still staring at the wall dumbfounded that I just experienced one of the most heartfelt love stories and I am not one who typically gravitates towards romance üòÖ.Set in Harlem New York we Follow the love story of Fonny and Tish who at the beginning of the narrative are torn apart as we find out Fonny is being falsely accused of a heinous crime and Tish discovers she's pregnant.
But at the same time, and even on the self-same day-- and this is what is hard to explain--you see people like you never saw them before.‚Äù
"One of the most terrible, most mysterious things about a life is that a warning can be heeded only in retrospect: too late." That this novel, first published in 1974, rings so true 43 years later, is an indicator that James Baldwin is indeed correct: the life of the black man in America is marked by constant belated warnings that leave our previous brothers marked as a target for the corrupt justice system that is intent on shackling us or killing us, or both.
The emotional center of everything that Baldwin has ever written is rage, and this novel is no different.
Two and a half years earlier, if somebody would have tried explaining me the prowess of love, I would have refused to believe or acknowledge the person.
A year and a half earlier, if somebody would have come to me with the askance for it, I would have certainly tormented my guts out.
However, had that person been James Baldwin, things would have taken a different turn.Love is revolutionary and so are the people who know how to love.
Now that I have finished reading it, I don't know what to do with myself.
"It's a miracle to realize that somebody loves you."
Something hardens in him, something changes forever, his tears freeze in his belly. But he has leaped from the promontory of despair. He is fighting for his life. It was heartbreaking to witness how life hardened the pure hearts of two young people ‚Äì Fonny and Tish. Tears filled my eyes every couple of pages while reading. Tears of anger and helplessness and sadness caused by what happened to them. But.This book had so much love in it. Love between lovers, between parents and children, between

Fourth buddy read with my lovely partner in the James Baldwin Quest, Sofia.
He's been teaching us empathy while breaking our hearts a little more with every book.
Anything by James Baldwin is good, but this was the first of his books I read and it soaked my mind in a sweet broth.

Wow! What frank in your face writing. Love reading this story about two lovers who have everything to be happy, except her fianc√© has been accused of a crime he didn't commit. Check review at http://didibooksenglish.wordpress.com on Wednesday.
He grins again, and everything inside me moves. Oh, love. Love.
I admire all of those authors immensely, but James Baldwin is in a class of his own.One of the greatest benefits of reading good fiction comes from authors who can make you know and feel and comprehend people you otherwise have not had much experience with before.
The huge talent of James Baldwin is his ability to make Black people burst out of all stereotypes and loom large as living, loving, feeling human beings.
But I like to imagine a huge One Country One Book event during which the majority of literate American citizens read and discuss If Beale Street Could Talk.
I usually like to read a book and then have some space before seeing the film version so this should work out nicely.
I've also had an itch to read more Baldwin ever since seeing I AM NOT YOUR NEGRO earlier this year.
IF BEALE STREET COULD TALK is a story set in the context of a racist justice system and what it is like to be young and black in that world, how there is so much fear and so much hope simultaneously.
Tish and Fonny are young, in love, and getting married until everything is upended and Fonny is arrested for a crime he didn't commit.
Baldwin has caught the true reality of life, particularly of a young Afro-American man, exploited in the hands of white policemen.
I came across this book accidentally, but its theme seems so relevant still today, particularly in the contexts of all those recent killings in America of young African-American men by white policemen that we see in the press.
It doesn‚Äôt get better necessarily, but it always ends.‚Äù The other place is, at the beginning, when Tish is returning after seeing Fonny, and she is feeling very weak, and Baldwin compares the lawyers and the bondmen to vultures circling over a dying man in the desert‚Ä¶that is just so accurate!!I really love the insights Baldwin has into life.
Mr. Baldwin continues to move my soul as he juxtaposes love with the hatred, stench, and hopelessness found for many blacks in 1970s New York City.
Tish loves Fonny.Fonny loves Tish.New York City works its damndest to push them apart while pressing them together.Their world, fraught with tragedy, comic relief, and struggle, closes in by the actions of those outside, constantly tapping at their door.Read this book (I suggest before the coming film adaptation).
Your heart and soul, like via Baldwin's other works, will tug, surrender, and tug again for more.
While this may not be as memorable as Giovanni's Room or Another Country I feel that this is the novel in which Baldwin just sits back and let's his prose do the talking. I must admit that the storyline may not be his greatest but it is endowed with marvellous writing and just gorgeous cynicism. Baldwin is god.
What is it about Mr. Baldwin‚Äôs writings that makes them so timeless? The events and situations that he touches upon in the 60‚Äôs and 70‚Äôs parallels the issues we are experiencing today. Simply amazing.
It is a bruised thing now; beating hot blood, but with the soft pain of being reminded that life (and especially the lives of people of color) can so often be f*cking unfair.The story as a whole is a necessary one‚Äî there were many emotions that it stirred up in me, and I haven‚Äôt read many books lately that can manage to make me feel so much all in one.
It is at once both a terrible reality‚Äî a reminder of ignorance, hate, and injustice‚Äî and a life-affirming look at love, family, and hope.
