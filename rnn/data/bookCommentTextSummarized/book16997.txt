I recall my mom reading me this story when I was a kid.
So that meant I already knew the story ending beforehand.
I have read the exact same copy that that mom read for me that turned up to be a vintage now with all its pages transformed into yellowish colour and cracked cover which adds to the story horror!Anyhow, as the story is aimed to teens and kiddos it would be quite an adrenaline stimulatant, which, however, wasn't the case for me.I enjoyed reading it on the beach and trying to picture their fears along with my scenary.First book to finish on my vacation 😃, EXCITED AND THRILLED 😍🙌WOOOOHOOOO 😄😆
#22 "No swimming. No surfing. No haunting."Terri and Jerry are visiting their cousins for the summer. They live in a small beach town where there's not really a lot to do. But when some friends get together with Terri and Jerry and start telling them a ghost story involving a cave Jerry has to explore. Besides, ghosts are real...

Creepy. Ending predictable. Still a solid Goosebumps story that I enjoyed.
I don't believe in ghosts, but I really enjoy ghost stories.Jerry (12) and his sister Terri (11) are spending the summer in New England with their ancient cousins, Brad and Agatha.
They meet three other children in the woods - Sam, Louisa and Nat. They tell the kids not to go into that cave on the hill!
He wants to explore it and find out what's really going on......I love these types of stories.
But perhaps a child, new to the horror genre, would be surprised.(view spoiler)[ Sam, Louisa, and Nat are the real ghosts!
And they want Jerry and Terri to be ghosts, too!
Αγαπώ τις ιστορίες με φαντάσματα και ως εκ τούτου, το συγκεκριμένο βιβλίο, κερδίζει επιπλέον πόντους επειδή καταπιάνεται με αυτά, την ύπαρξή τους και την τρομακτική τους παρουσία στον κόσμο των ανθρώπων. Βέβαια, για έναν ενήλικο, η λύση του μυστηρίου βρίσκεται πολύ εύκολα μπροστά στα μάτια μου, όμως σε εκείνα τα παιδικά που δεν έχουν την απαραίτητη εμπειρία, οι εξελίξεις και οι ανατροπές της ιστορίας μπορούν να οδηγήσουν στην κορύφωση του σασπένς και σε μια έκπληξη που δεν την περίμεναν με τίποτα.
They just made it up.me: Would you read it again?Jack: Maybe…me: What about other kids reading it, would you recommend it?Jack: It’s pretty scary, so they would have to be at least 6 years and older to read it.me: Was it hard for you to read, like lots of big words?Jack: Not really.me: What do you do if you come across a word that you don’t know.Jack: Uhhh, just sound it out.me: But what if you don’t know what it means?Jack: Mom, I just ask YOU!me: Oh, true… So should we get more Goosebumps books?Jack: That’s probably the only one.me: Why do you think that?Jack: It doesn’t have a number or anything.me: I think there are like hundreds of Goosebumps books.Jack: No. How do you know?me: I’ve seen them before.
Goosebumps ghost beach #22 by R.L. Stine is about a brother and sister that visit their relatives and they get some friends that tell them the legend.This book reminds me of the time in California when we went to the beach and there was a old hermit that lived there, similar to the old man is this story.
Little did we know that there was a great white shark by the beach.
The old hermit ended up saving us all from the shark.I think that the book was very good with all the lies especially when their relatives were ghosts and the graves already prepared for them and the dog that senses ghost overall this is a very good book that deserves a 3 star from me.
One the better books in this series, hands-down. Ghost Beach is a classic ghost story with many different plot twists and surprises. I'm a little too old for it nowadays but when I was a kid, I loved it.
Jerry and Terri are spending their summer vacation at their elderly distant cousins on the beachfront. Jerry can't wait to explore the mysterious cave down by the beach, but the local kids say that it’s haunted.Will Jerry and Terri discover the secrets of the cave?A really creep entry in the series, spooky ghost stories are always fun!One of my favourites!
I'm giving this 4 stars instead of 5 because I read it right after "A Night in Horrorland" which in my opinion, as the kids say was "epic" (I did say in my opinion) For some reason Jerry acted more like the little sister in the story to me.
His little sister was really brave and smarter.
I wish RL could have made Jerry a little more boyish.
Maybe I haven't read many books in male first person or what but I didn't like Jerry.
I'm trying to write this review with two kids jumping off the couch making thunder like landings and adults yelling at them to stop.
Jerry and his sister, Terry, visit their relatives, Brad and Agatha, who live in a cottage near a beach and a cave.
The cave often shows suspicious flicking lights from inside, and their trio friends claim that a ghost lives inside.
However, accidentally Jerry and Terry meet the old ghost.
But the old ghost claims that the actual ghosts are their trio friends, and he has investigated the area for so long to trap the trio inside.
It is similar in the way they find out the anomaly by reading the names of their friends and their relatives on the cemetery.
Ma devo ammetterlo, inizialmente avevo confuso questa storia con un’altra.
Non ricordo il titolo (anche perché devo aver visto la trasposizione televisiva), tuttavia era basata anch’essa su cimiteri e fantasmi, e per questo il mio cervello continuava a fare collegamenti errati.
Per fortuna, tutto ciò si è risolto a metà della vicenda XDHo sempre apprezzato moltissimo i cliffhanger di Stine (è semplicemente un genio), ma questa volta non mi sono sentita molto coinvolta.
La storia è fresca e lineare, ma un po’ sotto le righe a mio avviso, forse anche per i personaggi un po’ fastidiosi XDAd ogni modo è comunque piacevole.
Well hello there nostalgia.
I thought I had this book figured out early on, and I did! It's a book for kids. But the extra twist at the end still got me!SPOOOOOKY
il fuoco nella caverna A volte è bello ripercorrere le tappe fondamentali della propria infanzia.Certo, le storie di "Piccoli brividi" avevano lo scopo di intrattenere con spensieratezza e semplicità, limitando al massimo la componente prettamente horror.Questo approccio narrativo, eternamente in bilico fra lo spaventare e il divertire, spesso anche in maniera vistosamente scrausa, funzionò da bambino e ha sortito effetto anche stamattina.La storia regge bene ed il colpo di scena finale - anticipabilissimo con un attimo di malizia - è inquietante il giusto.Bravo Stine...e grazie!
Goosebumps was so popular when I was a kid, we would get in fights in the library over who got to check the new one out next. No joke.
I started to read this to my son but halfway through, he just was not liking it. I finished reading it and was a little mystified at the ending. Nic elittle twist.
Its the highest number of major characters in Goosebumps and also the living kids do not believe in ghosts (at the beginning of the book.) I live the graveyard, the tombstone, the beach and the cave.
A considerable book from the Not- so- horrifying Goosebumps series .PlotThe novel starts out with the Sadler siblings, Jerry and Terri, investigating a graveyard.
Jerry and Terri decline and the old man is trapped with the ghosts in the cave forever.
The two human siblings go back to tell Brad and Agatha all about their adventure and the elderly couple is very relieved that the children are safe.Suddenly the old man's dog conveniently bursts into the beach home and starts barking at the elderly couple.
لحد دلوقتى يُعتبر دا أفضل كتاب فى السلسله ، هو دا الرُعب الحقيقى فعلًا ، وخصوصًا إن تيمه الأشباح ليها مكانه خاصه عندى ، الكتاب بسيط كالعاده وسهل تتوقع أحداثه من البدايه بس هنا بيظهر إبداع الكاتب فى إنه يخليك تشُك فى كُل توقع حياله وبتحط إحتمالات تانيه خالص غير اللى فى دماغك .
That ending was interesting. Didn’t see that coming lol I love goosebumps books. I’m glad I participated in the goosebumps-a-long because I got to read some awesome stories.
آخرش خیلی بامزه تموم میشه....😂
On their first explorative venture along the deserted shore, Jerry and Terri meet up with three other kids who bear the surname Sadler, a boy named Sam and his younger siblings Louisa and five-year-old Nat. Jerry and Terri's natural curiosity and the nervous disposition of the three locals soon swings the conversation to the matter of a ghost rumored to live in an ominous-looking cave by the beach.
Ghost Beach isn't the most unpredictable of Goosebumps novels, but a few intriguing twists are to be had, and the ending is classic R.L. Stine.
Goosebumps: Ghost Beach By R. L. Stine By Michael HickeyThe book starts out with a boy named Jerry. He is having a dream about ghost coming up from the grave and grabbing him and his sister Terri. Jerry wakes up and he is in a bed at his cousin’s house. His cousin's names are Brad and Agatha. They live in New England, and Jerry and Terri are visiting them for the summer. Jerry and Terri decided to go exploring around the area that their cousins live at. They find and old cemetery, a beach, and a
Jerry and Terri decided to go exploring around the area that their cousins live at.
The next day they told the three kids and they said they need to trap it in the cave to save themselves.
During the day, Jerry and Terri went back to the cemetery and saw that there was graves that had their cousin's names on them and their three friends names.
They went up and started to do that as the ghost appeared it grabbed Jerry and Terri as the other three ran.
Jerry and Terri went home to tell their cousins.
"Ghost Beach" is probably one of the most consistent books in the Goosebumps story.
While others rely on chapter ending cliffhangers that don't actually end up being scary, "Ghost Beach" actually enough scares throughout.
As the story progresses, we learn that there is a cave where a supposedly a ghost lives.
And that's what makes "Ghost Beach" so good.
Unlike the plots of some Goosebumps books, I could definitely see parts of this story happening.
Maybe not the ghosts, but the creepy woods, the strange cave, the reclusive hermit.
Ghost Beach8.
I admit when I began this book, all I could think was "I loved this book as a kid!" My mom went to some obscure store all the way across town and bought it for me one day and I thought I was the bacon AND the hash browns.
Nope, but it is better written than some before it.(view spoiler)[If you remove the supernatural element from this book, it's about three children who are plotting to murder a homeless man who lives in a cave.
And said homeless man believes those children are evil, and he abducts the main characters at the end and forces them to listen to his "children are evil" speech.
But it all comes back around in the end, leaving everything hanging, including Jerry and his sister!Stine's got the MG voice down pat.
And I have to say it again, it all comes back to the ending.
You'll probably see it coming but where Stine leaves the story off, you have to give him credit for it.
No nice neat, tidy endings for him.GOOSEBUMPS is a great series to get the young ones hooked on horror early.
But for the better protected youth who needs their horror a touch watered down but not entirely forgiving, GOOSEBUMPS is the way to go and GHOST BEACH is an excellent addition to that classic series.
L. StineJerry and Terri are visiting their old, ancient cousins for the last month of the summer on a little island in New England.
Besides being pretty deserted, this island has a unique feature – nearly everyone there has the same last name as Jerry and Terri, and have for hundreds of years.
So when they meet three kids on the beach who share the same last name, they don’t question it.The kids tell them about an old ghost who lives in a cave that they are forbidden to enter.
First, Terri drags them to an old cemetery, where they notice something weird...Everyone is called 'Sadler.' Freaked out by this, they move to the beach and find an old cave.
Meeting three friends near here, they unravel the local legend about a ghost who lives in the cave and cleans the bones of animals and people.
But what Jerry and Terri must unravel: who are the real ghosts in town?This book had an interesting plot, I've never read this one before and I was really interested.
the character strength is teamwork because they help each other with getting away.
