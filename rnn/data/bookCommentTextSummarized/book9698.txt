He writes of how the "grain grew high in its harvest, in you, in good time the flour swelled; as the dough rose, doubling your breasts, my love was the coal waiting ready in the earth." Employing deeply sensuous language, Neruda in the first thirty three sonnets, hopes and prays that he can woo Matilde to live with him in Isla Negra, his home overlooking the sea in central Chile.
I often found myself reading both the Spanish and English versions of the poems in order to fully appreciate both the depth of Neruda's work and quality of Tapscott's translations.Awarded the Nobel Prize in 1971 for his life's body of work, 100 Love Sonnets is one of Pablo Neruda's crowning jewels.
شاید به همین دلیل بود که هماره از حمایت بیدریغ مردمانش برخوردار بود، هرجا که میرفت، در هر مقامی، سناتور یا مجرمی فراری، مورد احترام و حمایت مردمانش بود… او دیگر یک شاعر نبود، قلبی شده بود به وسعت یک کشور!
او شاعر طبیعت و زیبایی بود، شاعر صلح، عشق و مردم، و سرانجام: شاعر خویشتن خویش.
نرودا بیشتر از همه در دو کتاب: «ابدیت یک بوسه»؛ و «هوا را از من بگیر خنده ات را نه»؛ به بیان همین عشق و اثر آن پرداخته است.
Some of it was just beautiful:I love you straightforwardly, without complexities or pride;......so close that your hand on my chest is my hand,so close that your eyes close as I fall asleep.and:because love cannot always fly without resting,our lives return to the wall, to the rocks of the sea:our kisses head back home where they belong.and:By night, Love, tie your heart to mine, and the twotogether in their sleep will defeat the darknessLuckily I got over the phase where I copied tragic poetry into notecards to express my unrequited passions.
I will go long loveless periods through life, happy and unthinking of what passions I am missing, unenvious of people paired in love, like a bright new boat at sea not thinking at all of the harbor.
But I think it may be better to be mad than never to feel that madness ever, always to love on a level plane.What I love in poetry is that it is always, when done right, an attempt at saying what can never be said.
Neruda knows, and writes of in his Love Sonnets, that love is an ache.
Go away.This is part of Pablo's dedication: "When I set this task for myself, I knew very well that down the right sides of sonnets, with elegant discriminating taste, poets of all times have arranged rhymes that sound like silver, or crystal, or cannon fire.
The words so powerful that you feel each time, you age with him, you are his day.
My comment would be: 'written on the wings of butterflies.'"I want you to knowone thing.You know how
I do not love you as if you were salt-rose, or topaz,or the arrow of carnations the fire shoots off.
All I can add is, if you haven't read Neruda, or haven't read him lately, do your soul a favour and pick up this little book, even if you borrow it from the library, and go sit quietly for an hour.How many times, love, I loved you without seeing youand maybe without recollection,not recognizing your glance, not looking at you, a centaur,in adverse regions, in a burning midday:you were just the scent of grains I love.Perhaps I saw you, I imagined you in passing lifting a glassin Angol, by the light of the moon in June,or you were the waist of that guitarI played in the darkness, and it sounded like the excessive seas.I loved you without knowing it, and I looked for your memory.In the empty houses I entered with a lantern to steal your portrait.But I already knew how you were.

Σ' αγαπώ καθώς κάποιο φυτό που δεν ανθίζει,μα που μέσα του κρύβει το λουλουδόφως όλο,και ζει απ' τον έρωτα σου σκοτεινό στο κορμί μουτ' άρωμα που σφιγμένο μ' ανέβηκε απ' το χώμα.Σ' αγαπώ μη γνωρίζοντας πως, από που και πότε,σ' αγαπώ στα ίσια δίχως πρόβλημα ή περηφάνια :σ' αγαπώ έτσι γιατί δεν ξέρω μ' άλλον τρόπο,παρά μ' ετούτον όπου δεν είμαι μήτε είσαι,που το χέρι σου πάνω μου το νιώθω σα δικό μου,που όταν κοιμάμαι κλείνουν και τα δικά σου μάτια.
Kuambil gaun musim panasku dan berjalan ke pintu, memandang hujan rintik halus yang indah, dan berkata kepadanya,Aku mencintaimu tanpa tahu bagaimana, atau kapan, atau dari mana.Aku mencintaimu dengan lugas, tanpa banyak soal atau rasa bangga;begitulah aku mencintaimu sebab aku tak tahu jalan lain.
Hembusan angin memberi suara pada kemerisik tanaman tropis di ujung danau.Ya: siang hari meretih seperti api, atau laksana kawanan lebahmelaju dengan karyanya yang hijau, mengubur dirinya di dedaunan:sampai di pucuk daun merengkuhbuana gemilang yang berkedipan dan berbisikan.(XLII)Lalu kulihat sepasang merpati yang sedang bercanda, seolah bersapa minta pengertian sebelum mereka terbang dipeluk angkasa,Cintaku mempunyai dua kehidupan, untuk mencintaimu;sebab itulah aku mencintaimu ketika aku tak mencintaimudan pula mengapa aku mencintaimu ketika aku mencintaimu.(XLIV)Kulempar batu ke danau yang memantulkan cahaya langit.
and to me she quoted him..."no one else, love, will sleep in my dreams. you will go,we will go together, over the waters of time.no one else will travel through the shadows with me,only you, evergreen, ever sun, ever moon."thus, i knew for sure.
I am not a love poems lover, but these sonnets are so nakedly a lover's poems that in this case I'm head over heels.
(And my Spanish is wobbly at best).And organic is really the only word I'd use to describe these...Neruda himself, probably self-depricatingly (but un-self-consciously razor-accurate at the same time) described his poems relative to the rest of the genre as made out of wood, versus "silver, crystal, or cannonfire" of others.
«Amo il pezzo di terra che tu sei,perché delle praterie planetariealtra stella non ho.»Non si può fare a meno di tremare di fronte a una visione dell'amore come quella di Neruda: totalizzante. Nei suoi versi, il sentimento (quanto riduttiva mi sembra adesso questa parola!) amoroso diventa soverchiante, inebriante, conquistatore, è panico perché diventa tutto: terra, cielo, mare, «colomba e geografia». E il lettore amante non può far altro che chiudere gli occhi e inchinarsi.
And of course, my hands-down, all-time favorite, these unbearably romantic lines to his muse and wife:It was beautiful to livewhen you lived!The world is bluer and of the earthat night when I sleepenormous, within your small handsNow I know how it feels to fell in love with words, with beautiful, beautiful, sexy and romantic words:I love you as certain dark things are to be lovedIn secret, between the shadows and the soulAnd to have my heart broken by it:I can write the saddest poem of all tonight.I loved her and sometimes she loved me too.Although this may be the last pain she causes me,And this may be the last poem I write for her.There is nothing like sublime poetry to feed the soul.
XVIINo te amo como si fueras rosa de sal, topacioo flecha de claveles que propagan el fuego:te amo c
Neruda uses language and nature to bring out the truthfulness of beauty, desire, love, and lust.
The honesty and comparisons of love to simple and pure things in nature makes me wish I knew spanish and could read his writings in his native language.He also divides his sonnets into the catagories of morning, afternoon, and night, with each infiltrating new or different dimensions of love.
Not always happy or unrealalistic, Neruda is honest in his declarations of love.
We are not always in the beginning of love with someone, which is what I believe is what the 'morning' sonnets describe.
The 'afternoon' sonnets are more honest and discerning of his object.
I'm willing to admit that it's possible that other people in the world have been as in love with someone as Pablo Neruda was, but no one has ever expressed it so beautifully or ardently. With the eloquence and passion of a hundred poets, Neruda crafts lines that honor love so well that most people don't even know that love could BE so consuming or so light, so natural or so still. What Pablo Neruda does for love poetry- and for all poetry, for that matter- is a gift to the world. Muchas gracias, Senor Neruda.
Conhecia a poesia de Pablo Neruda através de vídeos no youtube.
Apaixonei-me pelo poema "Te amo" e mas tarde li a sua autobiografia.
Fiquei absolutamente encantada com todo o que este escritor viveu.
Deve ter sido uma pessoa maravilhosa....Estes sonetos descrevem vários tipos de amor.
Não apenas o carnal.
Há o amor puro, o amor amigo, o amor pela natureza, o amor pelo universo, o amor pelo seu país, entre outros.
Os meus preferidos são aqueles que ele escreve para a sua ama.
Li no original.
E só daquelas pessoas que considera que a poesia traduzida perde as suas sensações.

But these two following sonnets: XVII & LXXXI by Neruda took a hold of my heart, my soul, touch me so deeply and intensely.
They make me long for the day that I am in a relationship that will encompass & possess both the true essence and magnitude of unconditional love that is written in each one of these sonnets.
I fully know that one day it will happen and when it does, it will take hold of me, my CORE and I will experience things I never have but always dreamed of!
" Σε θέλω γιατί μόνο εσένα θέλω,σε μισώ μα γι' αγάπη σου προσπέφτω,κι ειν' της αθώας αγάπης μου το μέτροσαν τυφλός που αγαπά για να μη σε βλέπω.""Μόνος στην ιστορία αυτή πεθαίνωκαι πεθαίνω απ' αγάπη αφού σε θέλω,σε θέλω, αγάπη, ώς το αίμα και ώς το τέλος" " Καμιά άλλη δε θα κοιμηθεί με τα όνειρα μου, αγάπη.Θα πλέεις, θα πλέουμε αντάμα μες στα νερά του χρόνου.Καμιά δε θ' αρμενίσει στον ίσκιο πια μαζί μου,μόνο εσύ πανταζώντανη, πάντα ήλιος και φεγγάρι." Αφιερωμένο. Έμπνευση. Ταύτιση.
Se vi trasportano nel loro universo (nelle loro  praterie planetarie ), allora questa raccolta vi piacerà.it.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Il_bacio_(Hayez)it.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viandante_sul...
E riesce a farlo in una maniera estremamente semplice, prendendo spunto dalla natura.Queste poesie mi hanno ricordato quei due quadri.
Quando anni fa l'ho visto dal vivo sono rimasto minuti e minuti avvolto nel suo abbraccio.Ma soprattutto questa raccolta mi ha ricordato"Viandante sul mare di nebbia".
Non deve riflettere sullo stile, deve farsi circondare dalle emozioni.Se volete avere ulteriori informazioni sule due opere:it.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Il_bacio_(Hayez), dove sono descritte anche le tematiche politiche del quadro.it.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viandante_sul..., dove potete avere notizie sul pittore Casper David Friedrich e su altre opere della scuola romantica.Se vi piacciono i quadri e la letteratura vi consiglio  La ragazza con l'orecchino di perla.
need I say more......Love Sonnet XVII by Pablo NerudaI do not love you as if you were a salt rose, o
tie your heart at night to mine, loveand both will defeat the darkness like twin drums beating in the forest against the heavy wall of wet leaves
Out of sheer taciturnity the ceiling listens to the fall of the ancient leafless rain, to feathers, to whatever the night imprisoned: so I wait for you like a lonely house till you will see me again and live in me.

Achei essa edição argentina de 1960 por cinco reais num sebo, o que fatalmente me deixou feliz.Voltando ao Neruda, o livro é um estouro, passando por quatro fases, cada uma delas instila fases da relação amorosa, seja num aspecto temporal (o tipo de relação que temos no decorrer da vida), seja num aspecto espacial (uma única relação passando pelas intempéries da manhã, meio-dia, tarde e noite). Enfim,é brilhante.
You're probably expecting me to say something...scholarly. I can only say:1) This is probably one of the best books of poetry ever2) It should be treated with caution. Do not read under the following circumstances:A. out loudB. in the original languageC. in the presence of anyone of the opposite sexD. while under the influenceE. all of the above3) Don't ask me how I came to the above conclusions.
But, unfortunately, I couldn't find a free pdf copy available online, and I was so disappointed, kept searching and I found them translated by Alan Davison, but the translation wasn't good enough "wouldn't say bad for the exerted effort to translate them".Although the 1st and the 2nd attempt were unsuccessful, I didn't give up, I got the titles of the 100 sonnet from the book's page on Wikipedia, and I looked for each of them individually, and as long as it went, I was praying it'd be worth it..
