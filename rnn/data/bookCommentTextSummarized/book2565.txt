This is an early work, and especially having read before this such works by Moliere as The Misanthrope and Tartuffe this comes across as rather slight.The School for Husbands (L'École des maris) - has a similar plot to The School for Wives but isn't nearly as good, although still amusing.
As with almost all the other plays by Moliere I read this then involves tricking tyrannical parents into letting young love take its course.
Las comedias incluidas tienen muchas veces personajes totalmente definidos por un sólo ideal. Esto los convierte en seres extraordinarios dadas las circunstancias en que se sucede cada escena tan oportuna para la historia e inoportuna para el personaje que ponen en entredicho tales ideales.
