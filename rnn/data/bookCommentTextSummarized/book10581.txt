Some feel guilt and shame and are constantly seeking approval doubting themselves and not being able to decide or process their feelings to acheive compromise or a rational result.
The best thing about this book is it gives you a very nice little test to take to determine which areas you really need to work on, Approval, Self-Love, Perfectionism, etc...
You think relationship books helps?
So stop beating yourself up, compromise, disarm those who feed your negativity, and rationalize by taking nothing personally and start living your life the way you want and stop worrying about what others think of you.

أذكر أنني قرأته قبل ثلاثة أعوام ..وكان واحد من أفضل الكتب التي ساعدتني على فهمبعض نقاطي السيئة ، ومواطن ضعفي .. أعتبرته كتاب ملهم ، وساعدني في الحقيقة على إيجادالحلول الكثيرة ..ومازلت حتى الآن أقوم بقراءة بعض إقتباساته بين فترة وآخرى ..

This book just makes a lot of sense.
It completely blew my mind!
Herein, Dyer presents us with a completely different paradigm, a new lens from which to look at ourselves and the world.
I'm giving myself time digest everything I've read, the paradigm shift I've experienced, then read the book AGAIN before attempting a "proper" review of this amazing piece of work.

قرأت الكتاب بالعربية، الترجمة بها الكثير من العيوب، وبعض الجمل غير مفهومة. الكتاب من الأروع في التغيير، كان يغيرني في نفس اللحظة. أتمنى أن لا أنسى نصائحه، سجلتها بعناية، وسأجتهد لإزالة جميع مواطن الضعف لدي. أندم على كوني كنت مبتعدا عن هذه الكتب الفترة الماضية، كانت حياتي ستكون مختلفة. أنصح به، وبشدة!
We have the choice of how we process other people's opinion.
What am I avoiding?" Teach people that guilt no longer applies.Worry immobilizes you in the present about the future.
If you want to get ahead in life and all that you know you can make of it, then you have to say to yourself, "Why am I choosing not to do that?"What you think about expands.
If you argue for limitations in your life, that's what you'll get.
It's how you process the act that does.
I highly recommend this book to anyone looking to read something inspiring that helps you to change your mindset.
I love Wayne Dyer so when I was helping my MIL clear out and organize her huge book collection and found this old gem, I asked if I could have it. Let me tell you, it does not disappoint. Written in 1976 and his first book, it reads like he wrote it last week. Straight forward and real, this book will hit home for everyone! I'm going slow and learning, learning.
There are many, many false ideas, assumptions, conclusions that violate human physiology and how our mind works (which can also affect our health!), such as- Our thoughts create our feelings- You can choose your thoughts by decision and that will change your feelings- You can choose health over illness- By changing the words you use, you can change your reality- You can replace you erroneous beliefs by new positive ones just because you want to- You can ignore your negative emotions like they don't exist...
Your Erroneous Zones is simply one of the greatest self-help books ever written.
For people just beginning to read self-help or spiritual books, this book is a great place to start.
Dr. Dyer has written so many books, but important books to follow with this one are "Pulling Your Own Strings," "Your Sacred Self," and "Manifest Your Destiny." Later works include "Change Your Thoughts - Change Your Life: Living the Wisdom of the Tao." Your Erroneous Zones is a book for people who are just beginning to discover that we all have thoughts that do not serve us towards living a self-fulfilled life.
"Psychotherapist Albert Ellis wrote that Dyer's book Your Erroneous Zones was probably "the worst example" of plagiarism of Ellis' Rational Emotive Therapy (RET).
that [the book] was clearly derived from RET." Dyer never apologized nor expressed any sense of wrongdoing.
Ellis admonished Dyer for unethically and unprofessionally failing to credit Ellis's work as the book's primary source, but expressed overall gratitude for Dyer's work, writing: "Your Erroneous Zones is a good book, ...
it has helped a great number of people, and ...
with great simplicity and clarity." ...hat's off to Albert Ellis!c/o Wikipedia ...what an apple...RIP
این اولین کتابی بود که از وین دایر خواندم .
این کتاب حدود ده باور غلط است که به تفصیل شرح داده شده و راه برطرف کردن آن هم به دنبالش آمده .
شاید قبل از این کتاب فکر کنید که هیچ باور غلطی ندارید اما توصیه میکنم نتیجه گیری را به پایان مطالعه موکول کنید !!
وقتی کتاب را وق میزدم تا متن های منتخبم را پیدا کنم ، مشتاقانه آرزو کردم در اولین فرصت سراغ دوباره خوانی این کتاب بروم !شاید جزو معدود کتابهای خودیاری که از خواندنش پشیمان نشده ام.
Fantastic! I read it when I was still a teen and then I have read it again a few years ago. The best book of its kind. All those new cheesy, overly simplistic authors who are proclaming they 'know how to find happiness and will take you there'and are now at Harvard delivering subjects on 'Happiness', should probably learn from Dyer. That said, Dyer's writing style has changed and I don't enjoy his actual work as much as I enjoyed his early work...but I don't buy 'happiness' books anymore, anyway.
While the ideas were revolutionary back in 1976 when it was first published. Today this kind of ideas have been over exploited and is difficult to judge based on who published his book first, who has the better system or who goes into more detail.The true thing is that no matter who you like or how many self-help books you read. Is until you give it a try and start living by these ideas that you'll notice how you are actually and truly able to accomplish whatever you want.
Ultimately, though, the lines are ephemeral, the boundaries nonexistent, and the direction for finding a happy life is simply to do whatever you want and ignore anyone else who suggests that you are making bad choices.I'm not one for social and societal correctness; I'm pretty bad at it, actually.
The author just assumes that his readers will not go there, without any clear explanation of why.Now, I am probably not the right audience for this book.
It was a bestseller, and probably found its audience among middle and upper middle class businessmen and housewives and others--people whose problems in life are mostly that they are stressed about little things.
الكتاب لطيف بالعموم يخبرك ببعض المشاكل اتي يتعرض لها الناس, كلامه كثير في أمور لا تستحق كثرة الكلام, أعجبني الجانب العملي فيه, بالنسبة لي .. كتب د.فيليب ماكجرو كانت أفضل وأعمق ؛ استراتيجيات الحياة و اهتم بذاتك :)
90 percent of our happiness is our own reaction to things and only 10 percent what happens to us.I like this book. I don't agree with all of it but I like it. Good, positive message.
هذه الكتب لطيفة نوعا ما في استعادة بعض اللياقة وكذلك كجرعة ودفعة معنوية بسبب التكرار الزائد لبعض الافكار
Me gustaría recalcar el hecho de que nuestro objetivo no tiene que ser ser felices el 100% del tiempo.
Todas las emociones son necesarias.No deseo contar mucho más porque creo que es un libro que debe descubrirse por uno mismo.
Analizar nuestros comportamientos mientras lo leemos.
Como todo ensayo no a todo el mundo le va a ver los mismos significados para su propia persona.Te ayude o no lo recomiendo a todo el mundo.✍🏼Iratxe
It's a really amazing book that changed the way I think and act in many aspects of my life. I thought that I didn't like self-help books but this book learnt me in many ways that I should get out of my comfort zone. I think that anyone should read it at least once in his/her life. I will read it again for sure.
This is the very first "inspirational" or "personal growth" book I read.
I read it when I was a senior at the University of Miami and I was taking an inter-personal communications course, and we were required to give a presentation on a book that may have changed our life in some way.
But for now, I would say that anyone who needs a good shot of inspiration and/or motivation to make some major life changes (and/or changes in your way of thinking about things), would benefit greatly from any of Wayne Dyer's books.
Un libro que leí de adolescente y que afectó profundamente a mi forma de ver el mundo pero que con el tiempo, la formación y la experiencia veo de otra manera y no me aporta tanto.
Creo que abarca muchos problemas en los que mucha gente se atasca y que puede ayudar a dar un zarandeo a los que, sin padecer un trastorno mental en sí, tengan sus neurosis dando un poco de guerra.
Aclara, es directivo y ameno y, por la época en que fue escrito y consiguió ser best-seller, se le considera bastante original.
Hay otros más actuales que no dan la talla.
Sigue siendo un poco de luz entre tanta autoayuda rancia e inservible.
This book is O.K. It attempts to correct and manage a culture of excuses. It is a book about the self - about how the individual can activate thoughts and agency to transform their life. The problem is that the book is a context-free zone. In other words, no matter what an individual may experience, it can be changed by thinking differently about it.Unfortunately, this is an inaccurate assumption. Certainly, there are solid elements of self empowerment in this book. But the understanding of power and injustice is absent.
Aunque por lo general no disfruto mucho de leer libros considerados de auto-ayuda, este libro logró atraparme con su objetividad y su realismo, me encantó la forma en que se ejemplifican las zonas erróneas con casos de la vida real, debo admitir que me sentí identificado con bastantes zonas erróneas en las que debo trabajar. Lo recomiendo mucho para cualquier persona.
Son zonas erróneas el resultado de procesos cognitivos de mentes que generan pensamientos estrictamente negativos que inmovilizan, limitan y perjudican. Estos procesos o pensamientos están estrechamente relacionados con el ego, pues proceden de su voz.
مواطن الضعف كتاب يستحق الاحتفاظ به بعد الانتهاء من التعمق به .. اسلوب فكري راقي سلس، يشرح ما هي مواطن ضعف كل واحد على حدى و يساعدك لفهم مواطن ضعفك وكيفيةالتخلص منها...اعجبني ^_^
به جرات میتونم بگم این کتاب از بهترینهای دکتر دایر هست.نکاتی که توی این مجموعه در 12 فصل ارائه شده در کمترکتابی آورده شدهمطالعه کتاب برام لذتبخش بود و بسیار آموزنده
Terrible title. Life changing book if you are open.
