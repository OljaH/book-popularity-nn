This is one of these books.You can't imagine how enthusiastic I was when I started reading this.
It seemed like one of these books that you can't make mistake with, high rating, really good reviews, everyone seemed hypnotized by it, and most of all it's about angels and I'm fascinated by them since...ever.
Let me tell you about this story, there can be some small spoilers but I'll try to mark them (I don't promise anything):1.
What I mind is that form the moon you can see that he is (view spoiler)[ an angel and of course she is nothing less special.
(view spoiler)[There is also another guy (can you imagine that!).
Do you want to learn a secret? I'm such a liar : a year ago I've sworn to myself that I'll finish this [insert sarcasm here] wonderful piece of a book. So, 2014 Anna, I solemnly declare that Reed and what's-her-name will never see me again. #SorryNotSorry. But as I just came back from vacations and therefore am in a great mood, I'm still going to explain why. You never read this book? Lucky you! Here's what you missed :  A stupid heroine who never, ever takes a hint. That's simple, she's never s
The guy obviously means trouble but hey, why don't ask him why you've got nightmares?
The only things that I do know are : ✔ He spends his time glaring at her and menacing her and her friend.
She still wants to touch his fucking cheek after that so you know, I must be mean.
► I will never EVER be attracted by a male-lead who says things like (chapter 9, just before I stopped) : 
Therefore : Controlling male-lead + TSTL heroine + annoying writing = I can't bother finishing.For more of my reviews, please visit:
I tried really, really hard to like this book.
ugh, I just couldn't.
Everything was so one-dimensional, I didn't feel anything for any of the characters.
There was no build up, it was like crap would pop out of no where.
"Oh, I hate you Reed because you're mean to me *wahh* but I love you because I can't stay away from you.
Oh Russel with an annoying country accent (I'm from Texas and it was still annoying)who is supposed to be my 'soul-mate' but yet I still love Reed...
I'm in love with you too!" Give me a break!
Review to come.
lol Just because I write soul mate books and that would never happen.It's definitely a new take on the concept and I'm definitely intrigued how the Reed\Russell\Evie deal will play out.
If I had to pick now, I'd pick Russell,(Though by the end I was completely in love with Mr. Reed) but I'm not sure if that's just about the soul mate thing or just because Russell was a sweet, southern boy and I'm all about that ;) Amy wrote him very well.Overall, I was perplexed, sighing, growling and even crying at my kindle over this book.
"I want those thousand years with you Evie, you have no idea how much I want them. I want a thousand years, and then I want a hundred thousand more." This was a very twilight-like story, and I really didn’t like the love triangle.Well, I’m not 100% sure, but I think that Evie might actually be more irritating than Kricket! Who’d have thought it? At least Kricket is feisty, Evie is more pathetic than Bella Swan! All she seemed to do was whine, and whine, and then whine some more. I love you! My
"I want those thousand years with you Evie, you have no idea how much I want them.
This was a very twilight-like story, and I really didn’t like the love triangle.Well, I’m not 100% sure, but I think that Evie might actually be more irritating than Kricket!
First we had Russell who seemed alright (although personally I wouldn’t have wanted to date him), and then we had Reed who was just rude, jealous, generally an ass, and often downright irritating, not to mention the self-entitled.
The pace in this was also really slow, and ‘Inescapable’ is a fitting title, because I really wanted to escape this story.
4.5 Stars Really great YA/PNR book! If you enjoy series such as Existence or the Twilight books- you will most likely love this!  Evie is a college freshman starting at a new school. She got a full academic scholarship, but she knows no one. She is leaving the only family she has ever had- her Uncle Jim. Her mother died when she was just a baby and she never knew her father. The last few months have been rough on Evie. She has felt different. She’s been having nightmares and some strange things
If you enjoy series such as Existence or the Twilight books- you will most likely love this!
Evie is a college freshman starting at a new school.
She meets a geeky/loner guy named Freddie, who she befriends, and a football star, Russ, who she feels like she has known forever.
Reed has something against Evie from the start.
Reed knows something Evie doesn’t.
With time, Reed starts to accept Evie and they develop strong feelings for one another.
Evie knows she is head over heels for Reed, and he feels the same.
So I'm chatting with Amy on Faceboook and we're like hey nice to meet you, I write books, you write books yada, yada.
Then I'm like, well crap I haven't read her books.
So I sit down in my recliner, when I should be working on book 4 in my series, and settle in...well I shouldn't have tried to get settled because this book is action packed.
Amy has created a world of characters that you can't help but love (I mean seriously I want a Bun and Brownie in my life please).
The story never dragged, the romance was intense and the support characters really made the book for me.
Excellent job Amy!
WTF is with all the ridiculous high ratings???Inescapable is just another tiresome retread of Twilight.
Don't believe me?
5) Weird things soon start to happen to her, but..6) She's too helpless and needs others to assist her.7) #3 & #4 become possessive and overly protective of her.8) This is the first book of a SERIES.9) And it's just as poorly written.10) I rest my case.Oh. And instead of vampires, we have angels.
After 5 months of trying, I couldn't continue reading and DNF.
Great book! Now when is book #2 coming to ebook format? I'm tempted to break down and buy the paperback.
Fuck my life this book fucking OWNS ME!!!The story completely just sucked me in from start to finish.Reed and Evie! Omg I loved them!!I loved all the fucking characters!!I was swooning one minute and on the edge of my seat the next.Something so magical about a Paranormal books and this fucker is up there with the very best for me!I LOVE ANGELS!!!BEST. AUDIO BOOK. EVER!!! The girls voice was AMAZING!!! Now onto Intuition <3
I deleted my reviews for the Premonition series because ALL my thoughts and feelings have changed from 2012
This might possibly be the most boring book ever.I picked it up and the beginning was like, "Wow, not bad Bartol."Then Evie becomes immersed in Reese in that predictable way and I’m like, I’ll plow ahead and hope it gets better from here.
It would have seemed smart if she was stalling, but NO she really wanted to know!I would have been pulled a Britney and been like f**** you, I’m out.
Why are all heroines nowadays forced to be stupid, forgetful, naïve, dependent clingy, idiots?
I mean I can stand love triangles but when the answer is glaringly obvious, I feel like slapping the girl upside the head.
I mean, HONESTLY!
(❗Alıntılar kimi seçtiğiyle ilgili spoiler içerebilir, ama zaten Evie’nin kimi seçtiği konunun çok başında belli 😃) 📚”Bunun ne olduğunu çözeceğiz ve ben icabına bakacağım. Seni koruyacağım.”“Neden? Neden beni koruyasın ki? Reed, en son gözlemlediğimde, bana zar zor katlanıyordun. Benden hoşlanmaya başladığını söyleme sakın?” dedim dalga geçerek.“Genevieve, peki ya sana o kıpırtıları hisseden kişinin tek sen olmadığını söylesem, burada hafif bir his,” dedi karnını göstererek. “Birlikteyken? Oryan
Herkesin sevmediği, eleştirdiği kitapları daha çok okumak istiyorum, bu da ayrı bir psikolojik rahatsızlık sanırım.
Bu seriyle ilgili çok olumsuz yorum okudum, aşk üçgeni var diye yerden yere vurulduğunu gördüm.
Hiçbir şey bilmeden okumak bu kitap için daha keyifli bence.
Son sayfaları çok heyecanlıydı ve ilk kitap için tatmin edici bir final yaptı.
📚”Umarım bana bir şeyleri açıklayacak kadar güvenmen önümüzdeki bin yılı almaz.”Reed gözlerimin içine bakarak fısıldadı.
“Seninle o bin yılı geçirmek istiyorum Evie, ne kadar istediğime dair hiçbir fikrin yok.
Bu kaba bir çeviri ama melek dilinde kulağa daha iyi geliyor.”“Benim için böyle hissettiğini ne zaman fark ettin?”“Gölde beni şok tabancasıyla vurduğunda.
This book had many, many redeeming qualities, but I have to be honest: my absolute favorite parts were when Reed randomly spouted off how long she was asleep, down to the minute.Killed me Every.
Reed fascinated me, I love how through most of the book you see him as what you'd expect: old fashioned billion year old angel who lacks an obvious sense of humor--then every so often he goes all Jason Bourne and you're just like oh.
Damn.In a good way.I can't stand when supernatural characters are portrayed as regular guys with fangs, wings, or who randomly turn into an oversize dog or whatever.
İçinde aşk binbeşyüzdokuzgeni olmasaydı konusu fena değildi. Karakterlerden de Zee dışında kimseyi sevmedim. Evie zaten ayrı bir kategoride benim için; evlerden ırak.
You know it's bad when you have to stop and translate what the character is trying to say even if he's talking in plain English.Other than that, Russell might be my favorite character in this book (actually, the only one I liked).I liked it when Evie and Reed "broke up".
I think, had the main characters been different (and when I say different, I mean, not-Evie-and-Reed), I would have loved this book.Unfortunately, they were carbon copies of every naive heroine and controlling hero out there.
Do you understand what I’m saying?” Of course, this was a tip of the iceberg compared to other love words.The last part of the story where Evie accidentally changed Russell into something like her by healing him made me have a feeling of déjà vu because that scene resembled the one from Jennifer L.
It's been a really long time that I had a book hold my attention like the way this one did. It kind of reminded me of the way I felt when I read Twilight the first time. That was definitely meant as a compliment. I was completely surprised by the way the story ending, and loved it. I also loved the location, because I lived in Michigan for a long time. It felt like home. I do like that Evie and Reed are on equal footing by the end. Can't wait to read the next book!!!
I’m not going to say too much about the plot because it would take away some of the mystery surrounding the paranormal element (view spoiler)[it’s about angels (hide spoiler)].
I would have liked to connect to the characters a bit more, but ultimately I liked them and nothing they did actually bothered me.(view spoiler)[Except when Reed and Evie kept talking about everything with that shark metaphor.
(hide spoiler)] I liked that even though Evie shows some vulnerability and makes mistakes she’s strong and brave.
I did not anticipate (view spoiler)[Freddie being bad (hide spoiler)] and I actually liked how that was done.
Through several close encounters, Evie discovers that her fate is inescapable*.There is action, self discovery, unexpected twist and turns, a betrayal and an irreversible decision that will change everyone's lives forever.Honestly I did not like the first book because it was a bit slow at times.
The first books are always the basis of what is to come and how the characters will start off.As I am on the last book of the Premonition series and I have to say, continue reading, you will discover some evil yet sophisticated villains that you will hate and then love.
I read the whole series in a week. That's how good Amy Bartol is.
I love Amy!!
He firstly appears as this giant hardass and then we see that he is actually the sweetest thing ever and I just admire him for loving Evie so much.
Well, Russel, I kind of didn't like him at first.
He is kind of sweet and I love how much he cares for Evie.Buns and Brownie.
These two are Evie's pals and they're totes amazing and I'm sure they'll be your favorite thing in this book if against all odds you dislike the rest of it.Mrs. Bartol is an exceptional author.
Whenever he’s near, I feel an attraction to him–a magnetic kind of force pulling me towards him. I know what you’re thinking…that sounds fairly awesome.I mean seriously? Is she for real? Good lord, does this sound like a carbon copy of Fallen. Otherwise known as BLEAURGH.
One of my favorite scenes in this book was at a dance, where Russell, Reed, and Evie all go with their own dates and are forced to sit with each other at a table.
I've gone on and on about the romance blooming in this story, but Evie's discovery of what she and Reed really are and the dangers that come along with it are such an exciting part of this book.
I absolutely LOVE this story and these awesome characters, and I plan to dive right into Intuition so I can get back into Bartol's amazing world!!
ÖMRÜMÜ YEDİN. Bitmese kafayı yiyecektim. Gerçekten ilk 100 sayfasını beğenmedim. Tabi sonra o markette yaşananlar ve Evie' nin markete Reed'le gittiği sahneyle kitap açıldı. Ya son sahnede Russel gıcığının bir tavrı var geberdim sinirden. Ya of Evie benim istediğim kişiyi seçti, baştan beri onu seviyordu falan mutluluk dansı yaptım ama ötekine çok iyi davranıyo. Davranmasın.
I had just read Under Different Stars and I thought that this lady, Bartol, has some good ideas running through her mind, even if she didnt do a great job executing them and perhaps this was better.
But, even if it was quite weak and transparent at least it was well done.It irks me that there are some really good ideas in here, and that this could have been such a great book.
Because I already paid for the next 2 books- I know, Im a sucker for good ratings and an impulsive buyer.
He is the nicest and sweetest guy ever but he's just to nice and reminds me of how a brother should be always wanting to protect Evie.
The only person she knows is Freddie from a party she attended before it started.
But she also meets Reed and arrogant and miserable rich boy who seems to want nothing to do with her and who scares her but despite that she gets butterflies and feelsan overwhelming attraction to him whenever he's near.
This book will take you on an epic ride and is thrilling to the point where you will not want nor be able to put it down.
Awkward dialogue was one of the biggest problems for me, Russel's accent made me embarrassed for him and all the conversations between the characters are stiff or just weird.
Russel and Evie, I kid you not, know each other for not even twenty four hours and Evie starts telling him how she feels she needs to protect his necklace and she has awful nightmares about it.
By page 72 Russel had been put under mind control 3 times by Reed, and neither Evie nor Russel are really freaking out.
And Evie is so fake as a character.
Just plain awful.
İlk başlarken yorumları hiç okumamıştım ve "Ya bu Alacakaranlık gibi değil mi?" demiştim içten içten. Sonra baktım ki zaten olay oymuş.(Shame on you! o.o) Mübarek fanfiction! Ama o kadar akıcı ve konu o kadar güzel ilerledi ki... Gerçekten bayıldım. Uzun süredir bu tadı bulamıyordum. Not:Yabancı Yayınları'nın tasarladığı ayracı da ayrı güzel!
Sorry. i just can't care about these people. DNFed at 20% I didn't even get to the actual mythology which is so sad. I was so desperate to get into it, I read a couple of reviews and saw one explicitly comparing it to Twilight.Now I don't feel so bad DNFing this mother.
güzeldi be :)
I despise love triangles and the only thing saving this one for me is that her mind is made up even if her heart is warring with itself, but it's something she literally cannot control.The names are a little tiring.
I always do that for some reason even when I know I'm going to continue and to my MAJOR disappointment, I find out we don't see a lot of Reed in the next book.
As I mentioned...despise triangles!What to do.
What to do?Frustrating as hell authors.I should also mention I'm not a major fan of ya because the lack of steam, so the fact that I really liked this surprised me a bit.4.75 starsAmazon KU!
But as things start to get stranger and stranger, Reed becomes an almost constant presence in Evie’s life, especially when she is in trouble, and when he finally reveals his secrets, Evie discovers that her life is about to change in a way she could never have imagined.(I’m keeping things vague because unravelling the mystery is half the fun, but click here if you’re interested in the paranormal nature of the book - (view spoiler)[ It turns out that Reed is an angel, and Evie is half angel, but with no idea who her father is, it’s not clear whether she is good or evil… dun dun duuuuuun (hide spoiler)]).It’s all very exciting, and the story moves at a quick pace as the paranormal element is blended with Evie’s everyday adventures as a young college girl, and I thought the mix was really well done.
Reed, ofering mixed signals about his opinion about Evie, makes her understand that her existence would change everything.“Okay, so when is the mother ship coming to pick us up?” I ask worriedly.“The what?” Reed asks with confusion clouding his eyes.“The mother ship, you know, aliens?” I ask tensely.He gives me an impatient look.
Evie loses what she loves the most, and the Angels fly around her vowing that they’ll protect her with the price of their own lifes.
Welp, that's what I get for going back to read an author's first book, I guess.
It wasn't the worst thing I've ever read, but as other reviewers have pointed out, it IS very Twilight-esque.
And that's not a selling point for me.
Yet, I've really enjoyed the author's newer works, especially Secondborn, which just released.
So, I thought, reasonably enough, that I'd probably enjoy her backlist.
I even wasted my last Hoopla credit on the second book because the start of Inescapable was relatively auspicious.
I'm sure if I'd read this back when I read Twilight, I probably would have liked it.
Maybe even really liked it.
4****!!! So good, on too the next one!
My first impression while reading this book remind me about Fallen series but unlike Fallen there is some different.The chapters of this book are always pack with huge action or some emotional moments. Not to mention there's a lot of element of surprise!I also like the concept of this story. Fresh and refreshing! I wonder who will Evie choose in the end?
Oh My God! What the heck was that ???I can not believe I delayed half a year to read this series. A well planned composition written so well that you do not let the book down. If you liked Hush, hush, hush series by Becca Fitzpatrick or Covenant series by Jennifer L Armentrout you will devoured this series.6 stars by far!
Kitabı beğendim. Kısa sürede okunan bir kitaptı. Yine bir aşk üçgeni diye kafamı duvarlara vurmama az kala biraz değişti olaylar. Serinin diğer kitapları ilkinden daha güzelmiş. Heyecanla bekliyorum !
It started very very slow but then Boom! Especially last parts of the book was so intense. And I'm definitely continue to read this story. :)
Author posted on her blog her version of Reed which I really like.
I love paranormal romance stories and I was looking forward to read this one.
But I read it in less than 24 hours, so it must be a good sign, righ?
The one thing that really frustrated me when reading this book was a love triangle.
It seems like they are in every single YA book these times.
I liked her sarcasm, it made this book quite different comparing to other YA paranormal stories I have read.
Than there was Reed and Russell.
Inescapable is only the first out of five books in Premonition series.
Throughout the course of my Goodreads experience, I've read many angel and paranormal books that have ranged from extremely corny to the most excellent and well thought out stories I have ever read.
I instantly fell for the grouchy, pushy Reed the minute Evie layed eyes on him.
That can’t be a bad thing, can it?”As the story unravels, we begin to see Reed change his tune as he becomes enamored with the spunky red head who just won't leave despite his best efforts.
Reed lifts his lips from mine, and looking into my eyes, he murmurs, “I want those thousand years with you, Evie, you have no idea how much I want them.
Meaning self-published and it is spectacularly done!Amy writes about angels and soul-mates, love and loss, friends and enemies in such a way that you are gripping a pillow to your chest one moment and yelling at the characters the next.In our MC Evie we have a girl who is strong but yet like all college freshman she is unsure of herself and her feelings.
I didn't like it at first but it grew on me and the second time I read the book I actually adored it.And that is the beauty of Amy's writing!
