The writer of Exercises in Style is hardly known for writing We Always Treat Women Too Well--in fact, it was ignored by "serious" Queneau fans/scholars for twenty years after its publication--and yet this is where I decided to start.
It's less shocking now than (I imagine) it was then, and it's funnier than it has a right to be (Queneau is a great writer; Barbara Wright is a great translator), and it's still a strange book to start with if one wants to read Raymond Queneau.
Ο Ρεϊμόν (υπαρξιακό) Κενό σπάει χοντρή -έως και χοντροκομμένη, έως και κακόγουστη- πλάκα σε αυτό το βιβλίο. Διασκεδαστικότατο «σίγουρα», που λεν κι οι κλωτσοσκουφισταί, αναρωτιέσαι όμως αν θα τύγχανε της ίδιας αποδοχής εάν ήταν γραμμένο από κάποιον Φούφουτο συγγραφέα ή αν -έστω- εξακολουθούσε να φέρει την ψευδώνυμη υπογραφή Σάλι (Σάρα Σαχλα) Μάρα και το Κακό Συναπάντημα, όπως όταν πρωτοκυκλοφόρησε.
Dublino 1916: un gruppo di giovani fanatici Repubblicani assalta l’ufficio postale di Eden Quai per mettere ( secondo loro) il regime in difficoltà.
Sette uomini scalcinati, dal grilletto facile, beoni e curiosi, lanciano una resistenza armata contro le truppe britanniche.
Sono pronti a dare la vita, fra una ceretta, un mal di pancia e spogliarelli improvvisati ma non hanno fatto i conti con…Un romanzo divertente, dissacrante, che sottolinea la differenza fra uomini e donne, giocandoci, rendendola palese e grottesca in un crescendo di simpatia e humor.
Un quasi primo Queneau per me dopo piccoli frammenti degli “ esercizi di stile” , piacevolissimo.
Troppo buoni con le donne?
There is already a substantive synopsis on offer so no point in my rehashing.I know that many readers have rated this shorter novel far higher but it didn't quite "gel" with me even though I love books set in Ireland and I love the period of history that the novel was set in.
The very dark humor, and references to James Joyce sailed over my head as I've never read Joyce I'm afraid.
The novel itself is written at a cracking pace, and the chapters are short which gave the story a 'static feel".I realize that the novel was meant to be a parody but it just didn't resonate, parts that were meant to be humorous weren't to me.

If a coherent Alfred Jarry wrote Dog Day Afternoon after reading Joyce you would end up something like this.
Reading the description you might think there's better use of your time than literary smut but you'd be doing yourself a disservice to miss this.
Much is made about the Joyce-influenced character names and locations but to best understand this work I think Rabelais is the true parent of most of Q's work.
But - why should a book that parodies crap try to do better than that?
If, like me, you watched Pulp Fiction and felt dumber for having sat throughout the experience - you'll probably appreciate this mock black humor.
What distinguishes Queneau's treatment of such material is his amusingly discreet approach; a more passive reader might not even catch his description of, say, an act of fellatio, which lurks beneath the surrounding action.
One might say that Queneau cleverly writes with the "correctitude" that preoccupies the novel's male characters.
As in any good satire about the battle of the sexes, both genders fare pretty badly--this may be an implicitly pro-feminist novel, but only in the sense that the central female humiliates the men through her sexuality alone.
The reader, perhaps as intended, doesn't come away with a particularly positive impression of human beings in general.
A number of Irish rebels take over the (fictitious) post office at Eden Quay, killing several of the employees in the process.
Before long, they start striking attitudes as brave and highly principled rebels, when suddenly it is discovered that one of the female employees has locked herself in the loo.
Although she is supposedly virginal, she practically rapes all the rebels in turn.
As one of the rebels remarks, "If it hadn't been for you we'd have been dead without any trouble, but, just because you went to have a pee at the precise moment of our insurrection, our glory may well be tarnished by vile gossip and filthy slander."
queneau parodies bad writing in every conceivable aspect, taking the overt form of a ludlumesque action thriller - the evil twin brother of "exercises in style"
Despite these violent acts being visited upon her, Gertie Girdle (yes, that's really her name) continuously gives the impression that she's not overwhelmed, that she is in control of both herself and the situation, and even if things aren't going exactly according to some carefully-laid-out master plan, things are at least going her way even as they appear to not be at all.The story also manages to lampoon the sense of nationalistic pride felt by its characters, making them all seem a little ridiculous for the strong feelings they have for the institutions of their countries, which drive them to say and do things they clearly don't fully understand.
Mai prima di questo avevo letto un libro di Raymond Queneau, dunque non sapevo cosa aspettarmi da qu
I don't even think I'm prudish as the humour for example of Tom Sharpe is sexual but it's irony and satire pokes fun at the institutions it seeks to undermine, in this book it is simply sexual assaults apparently made acceptable because the heroine enjoys the experience!!The plot, well bizarrely in 1916 Dublin a fictionalized post office is taken over by rebels, gertie is locked in the toilet but emerges to cause sexual havoc amongst the revolutionaries.
Mám rád tyhle knihy, kdy příběh rovnou obsahuje pointu knihy, tak jako třeba Jak se plave ke dnu od Jirky Pomejeho.Tento příběh se odehrává během první světový války, chvíli před vznikem Irský republiky.
Irský rebelové spolejhaj na to, že britský flotily maj na práci drancovat někoho jinýho a tak v Dublinu začnou obsazovat britský úřady.
Queneau se soustředí na jeden poštovní úřad, kterej obsadí několik rebelů a co čert nechtěl, nevyhodí z úřadu všechny zaměstnance.
Zapomenou totiž na záchodě jednu poštovní úřednici.
No a tady je kámen úrazu - jak už to na poštách chodí, jen co se zavřou dveře, úřednice začne ouřadovat a kalhotky za chvíli letí komínem.
Could anything this well named be bad?
Of course not.
I heard about this by way of somebody's very distraught ex secret boyfriend who related to the title rather personally.
The form here is unique.
The characters are undescribed and undeveloped -they are just names that things happen to.
This only makes the story more exemplary.I am fascinated by the fact that Queneau originally published this book under the pseudonym Sally Mara because this piece is so intricately masculine -even misogynistic when it can manage to be.
The story is terse and tragic and a very valid literary creation.
I read this book nearly 30 years ago and absurd images from it still haunt me. I'm the first to agree that Queneau was a genius, for Elements of Style, The Bark Tree, and The Last Days, and I have nothing against parody or satire as such, but this story doesn't connect with any of his other works. The effect is juvenile in the extreme, a quality which Queneau shares with Alfred Jarry, but really it's the title and the attitude it pronounces upon the subject which makes it reckless and belligerent. Any comic effect is quickly overwhelmed by disgust.
this is kind of snubbed by Queneau scholars. i seem to run into these types of novels often. but that's because i've found the novelists that i like, and you can't win 'em all when you come to their novels. this one has a great story though. nowhere near as amazing as Zazie in the Metro or Pierrot Mon Ami, but that's by Queneau standards. by normal standards, this deserves the four point rating. i say the same of this as i said of Exercises in Style (also Queneau)--read if you're a Queneau fan
From the back cover blurb this promised to be a dark tale with an erotic subtext, but unfortunately it's a farce in many senses of the word and never gets as interesting as it might have done. It's difficult to see why this French writer would have written such a book and it is impossible to give a hoot about any of the characters. It might be funny, but it didn't appeal to my sense of humour (or rather, the writing style didn't appeal). Flooded with stereotypes and littered with misogyny I was bored by this nevertheless swift read.
Sometimes time just passes a book by. This has its moments, but it primarily a curiousity at this point. Yes, yes, I understand Queneau (a smart and creative author) was spoofing a particularly low-class style of sadistic/erotic thriller. And he does that well, and there are definitely some funny little toss-offs along the way.But is it worth the read at this point, 60 years later?I don't know. Maybe. I guess I read it. It's quick, and definitely has its coldheartedly funny moments.(I've just talked myself up from two stars to three stars. But really it's probably a 2.5.)
this bizarre send-up of hostage drama written in 1948 has a great conceit: Irish rebels storm a post office of English sympathizers. They removed all the workers except one Gertie Girdle. Erotic & violent chaos ensues. All the rebels' names are taken from Ulysses and they shout "finnegan's wake!" as a salute. Despite it being very funny in parts, it's a bit of a let down. But, it's pretty short if you're that curious.
Wonderfully bizarre with quite possibly the oddest punchline I have ever encountered. The back summary describes it as a send-up of 1940s pulp erotica, and in that aim it did a fabulous job: one can't help but to simultaneously laugh and squirm uncomfortably during certain scenes between Gertie and the Irish rebels holding her hostage within the Dublin post office. Wickedly hilarious and just a fun and quick read overall.
This was actually a great follow-up to Ulysses because all of the character's names, some locations,and the text are a parody of Joyce's works. I had no idea that was the case when I chose to read this though. The style reads sort of like Joyce meets Quentin Tarantino with maybe a slight dash of Douglass Adams. If that sounds like a strange mix, it is, but it works quite well. It's absurd and interesting and funny. I recommend it.
This book might have felt more relevant if I gave two shits about James Joyce but I don't. It does however prove my point that you don't have to like Object A's influences B &C to like Object A (in popular music, A would equal the White Stripes and B would equal Robert Johnson and C would equal ever more obscure blues musician captured by Ken Burns.)Having not read much Joyce, this book was nonetheless engaging, funny, and a bit slutty- all qualities I enjoy in the world.
"Le corps continua quelques secondes encore son mouvement rythmique, tout comme le male de la mante religieuse dont la partie superieure a ete a moitie devoree par la femelle et qui persevere dans la copulation. " (p 156). Une petite nouvelle pleine d'humour et de sexe sur un fond de guerre civile irlandaise dans le style des livres de "pulp fiction" des annees 1940s.
A hilarious and smutty joke, much like Boris Vian's ridiculous noirs. Just try to read the opening lining with some twit shouting "God Save the Queen!" and ending up puking blood out of a newly acquired eighth orifice without laughing and plunging full speed ahead into this dark sick joke of a book.
Queneau's homage to Joyce's Dublin was much more fun than I expected. An English hussy hides in the bathroom during a Republican raid on a bank, and as they decide the most honorable way of getting rid of her, manages to guilefully corrupt them all. Silly rewards for reading Ulysses abound.
Not as good as exercises in style, a mix of Marquise de Sade, James Joyce and Jerome K. Jerome. Dark humor, self-analysis and eroticism. If this would be attempted to be transformed into a movie, it would be a pornographic Tarantino movie (if such a thing exists).
Paradossale e divertente come ci si aspetti che sia ogni opera di Queneau. Pi� che appartenenti all'Irish Republican Army, gli assaltatori dell' ufficio postale di Dublino, sembrava l'Armata Brancaleone. Non l'ho trovato onirico come altre sue opere ma merita certamente una lettura
This title is a sister to Boris Vian's "I Spit on Your Graves." Queneau wrote this for the same publisher under the name 'Sally Marr.' I think it was Sally Marr, but maybe I got Morrissey on my brain. Nevetheless it's a masterful piece of fiction by one of France's great writers.
Nationalism, heroism, rebellion, everything just pales in front of sexuality! Even if considered ironic this book presents us with very true aspects of human nature, differences between sexes, primal instincts, all wrapped in a very funny narrative!
Emoustillant et hilarant, mais ô combien cruel.
