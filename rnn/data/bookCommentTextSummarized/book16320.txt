‘’There are some tales not for telling, whether because they are too long, too precious, too laughable, too painful, too easy to need telling or too hard to explain.’’ I feel that this quote describes the essence of Donoghue's book in a poignant and clear way. This isn’t a collection of short stories in the traditional sense of the word. It is a series of tales closely linked to each other. The stories of women who loved, yearned, who were hurt by others, who sought revenge, justice, comfort. E
If nothing else, this shows that those we have come to regard as the ‘’good’’ or the ‘’bad’’ characters of a tale are not very different from each other.If you read my reviews, you’ll notice that Emma Donoghue is a writer I swear by.
‘’Kissing the Witch’’ is a book that contains the best retellings of the most well- known and beloved fairy tales of our childhood.
The world Donoghue has chosen is the one of fairy tales passed down from generation to generation.Each story bears the title ‘’The Kiss of…’’.
I like the idea of lesbian friendly fairy tales - I, for one, am someone who always wanted to kiss the witch, as the title proclaims - but there must be a way of telling those stories without leeching all the power of the original.
And if Snow White is going to stay with the stepmother who did threaten to kill her, I'd like a little more of the emotional complexity behind that decision.I'm so hard on these stories partly because they came so near to being something that I would love.
The stories tantalise because at the end of each I wanted more detail and follow up for characters I had bonded with but the book's progress was always on to another story.
The pace of the stories may be simple but the "bad guys" are not really bad they each have a place in society that constructs who they are as do our heroines.
The balance between what society makes each character and how they fight to define themselves over-against social determinism is part of what I loved.And for me (here's the part not everyone will like) I like women loving women in a story...and there is plenty of that.
4.5 stars. This is a very creative, atmospheric book of fairy tale retellings, with some of the best writing I've ever seen. I love how three-dimensional some of the tales are, and how she got these lovely characters developed in so short a time. The Tale of the Shoe: 5 stars. I don't think anyone can ever understand how much I love this Cinderella retelling. It's about being who you're supposed to be, or being who you truly are.  And then, because I asked, she took me to the ball. Isn't that wh
Isn't that what girls are supposed to ask for?
The Tale of the Rose: This retelling of Beauty and the Beast gets five stars simply for its last line, which is one of my favorite quotes of all time.
This isn't a typical retelling; I suppose you could call it The Goose Girl, but it comes from the point of view of that story's villain.
I don't love this story; it's not very strong thematically, and the main character is slightly obnoxious.
The Tale of the Skin: 5 stars.
The Tale of the Voice: 5 stars.
"Climbing to the witch's cave one day, / I called out, / Who were you / before you came to live here?/ And she said, / Will I tell you my own story?
/ It is a tale of a kiss."Do you ever find a book and just know it's going to be everything you love in the world?
/ It is a tale of a handkerchief."Kissing the Witch was like that for me.
I love retellings of fairy tales, especially when they come in collections of short stories!
/ Tale of cottage."Luckily for me, Kissing the Witch was all I wanted it to be and more!
At first glance, Kissing the Witch appears to be a simple anthology of fairy-like tales.
Upon deeper reading, it becomes clear that the separate stories are fragments—or different points of viewing one continuous thread.
The way that the fragments are woven together is brilliant.Early, the reader is aware that there are continual suggestions of tales that he/she has heard since childhood.
The images are repeatedly revisited; and the reader is invited to gather them and piece them into any of several possible interpretations.Reading the book is like following behind Hansel and Gretel -- picking up the strewn clues and seeking the the messages hidden along the paths.
I picked this up because Kirsty Logan of The Gracekeepers said that it was very influential for her. These are fairytale retellings with a feminist twist. They’re also stacked like Russian dolls, so at the end of one retelling you’ll have the ‘villain’ tell their backstory, and the witch of one tale becomes the heroine of the next. Your favourite fairy tale will probably be in here. There’s a Little Mermaid retelling which was probably my favourite.
"Climbing to the witch’s cave one day, I called out,Who were youbefore you came to live here?And she said, Will I tell you my own story?It is a tale of a kiss."I had heard of Emma Donoghue mostly because people kept talking about her novel Room.
Kissing the Witch is a clever little book that takes well known fairy tales and tells them from the perspective of different women involved in the stories.
Each story is then linked through the characters who each tell their own story.It's a lovely structure and the book made for captivating reading.
If I were to use one word to describe this book, it would be clever.
“Change for your own sake, if you must, not for what you imagine another will ask of you.” These are considered fairytale re-tellings with a feminist twist, but the best part is that they are all connected as a woman asks the other who they were "before", and together they make a novel that leaves you begging for more.They were girls, princesses, innocent or not so, all before they became witches, stepmothers, crones.
After all, after years and travels my secrets are all I have left to chew on in the night.”
Kissing the Witch is a quirky collection with the sub-title 'Old Tales in New Skins' - it contains thirteen re-imagined fairy tales by Irish writer Emma Donoghue.
Gay readers should especially enjoy this twist on some of the traditional 'boy meets girl' fairy tales.As a long-time student and lover of traditional stories, I found Kissing the Witch beautifully crafted and highly entertaining.
I enjoyed the way Donoghue used a traditional storytellng style to present the reader with something fresh and new, yet as wise as the ancient tales that were its inspiration.
Donoghue combines self-righteous messages with blatantly didactic interior monologues which can only appeal to those already believing everything she says. She spurs no thought which was not already there, and in writing a book which never aspired to art, has done what your average writer does: increase the general volume of words in print, and nothing more. A string of random monkey-typed characters would have aided mankind as well.
Mmm... A complete failure when it comes to grabbing and maintaining my attention, and I can't give even bonus points for creativity because, although the author does try, she didn't really surprise me with any of the retellings here.
If there's one thing I love more than fairytale retellings, it is a bunch of gorgeously written fairytale retellings with a splash of gay and a feminist flair to it, that kicks all the mothereffing tropes right in their faces.
Interesting that I really like this author’s work, but this was published nearly 20 years ago and she has obviously improved over time! These were ok but not terribly memorable.
The book begins with "The Tale of the Shoe," told by Cinderella.
Donkeyskin's tale is also part of the problem, because the ending of each of these is just a bit too happy for me.
I'd have liked to see a little more dialog and negotiation between each pair (and some pairings are a bit too cross-generational for me, like Snow White and her stepmother, or Rapunzel and her adopted mother), but ah well.
Probably my favorite of them all is "The Tale of the Kiss," told by the witch from the Little Mermaid story.
I've wanted to read this for ages, so when I had insomnia last night seemed like a good time. This book is a series of interlinked, usually traditional, fairytales, featuring the voices of women trapped within them -- sometimes with lesbian relationships, sometimes just (just!) the complicated relationships between women. For me, it felt a little flimsy, maybe not quite as magical as I'd hoped, but overall it was enjoyable. Mostly, I wished it was longer, that there was more of it. I think I enjoyed the Little Goose Girl story the most.
Kissing the Witch is absolutely beautiful.
So many of these are women taking charge of their destinies, of their fates, of their bodies.
I also thought that connecting every tale through the "Will I tell you my own story?" bit was a nice way to intertwine these women like what a pleasure!!My independent ratings for each tale is:The Tale of the Shoe: 4The Tale of the Bird: 4.5
The Tale of the Kiss: 5++++
On the whole I am inclined to think that a witch should not kiss.
The best way to end the book, in my opinion.
I believe that a reader who is very familiar with fairy tale lore will receive even greater enjoyment from this book then I did.I did enjoy each story equally and did not find them to be horrifying or particularly magical.
But, when you meet the character in the previous chapter many years have past between the stories.
I guess that's relatively common in short stories.I will definelty have to read this again as I cannot remember how the characters are connected from one chapter to the next.
The stories have become a bit muddled but it's probably due to the speed in which I read devoured this selection.
adhgakgf this was everything i hoped it would be. written in a classical fairytale style but minus the magic of the untouchable and adding the magic of the reachable. beautiful, and dark, with princesses, witches, spinsters, and thieves galore.
Now maybe it was because I started recognizing more obscure fairy tales from my recent reading of Philip Pullman's translation of Fairy Tales from the Brothers Grimm: A New English Version, like "Donkey Skin," which is so disturbing in the original and even more so when psychologized from a novelistic retelling.
Also, it seems as the collection went on that Donoghue allowed more of wonderful sense of her humor to sneak in; see the final story narrated by the "witch" from the Little Mermaid fairy tale.It wasn't that the stories became less didactic as they went on (such is often the nature of fables and fairy tales); it's just that they gripped me more.
Donoghue's feminist retellings of fairy tales is not as original as it would have been when first published, but the beauty and power of her prose is undiminished.
The short first-person accounts flow fluidly (sometimes more fluidly than logically) from one to the next, connected by overlapping characters, a technique that elides the traditional good/evil dichotomy of fairy tales.
I am sympathetic to Donoghue's rejection of the model of female powerlessness, objectification, and loss of identity as present in many popular tales, but I would have liked to see a greater variety of responses.
A solid 3.75—I guess I was expecting more stories about women loving women.
YES - this is such an amazing... AMAZING read.

A collection of 13 short stories, Kissing the Witch takes fairy tales (many of them easily recognizable) and revises them: poetic and magical, they take a fresh look at their stories and protagonists, instilling feminine independence, wisdom, and romance missing in the original tales.

A collection of 13 short stories, Kissing the Witch takes fairy tales (many of them easily recognizable) and revises them: poetic and magical, they take a fresh look at their stories and protagonists, instilling feminine independence, wisdom, and romance missing in the original tales.
The narrative that ties the stories together is stretched thin, but everything else about the book is wonderful: it's a strong, uniform collection which is beautiful, liberating, and quietlyyet stronglyrevolutionary.
Fortunately, that's the book's only real weakness.Most short story collections vary in quality, but Kissing the Witch maintains uniform high quality while featuring a variety of content.
There was nothing wrong with this book.
From the three tales I read, this struck me as Francesca Lia Block with a lesbian feminist bent, i.e. beautifully written, but a lot more style than substance.
Which is all very well, and I realize that these are fairytale retellings, and fairytales deal more in types than characters, et cetera.
Again, had I not glutted myself on FLB (and Angela Carter) this summer, I probably would have been more patient here and treated it like a book of prose poems.
But damn it, I want snappy narratives that involve characters.
Maybe it's Maybelline.
I really enjoyed this! It was an easy, quick read, but the writing didn't suffer for that. It was my kind of dark fairy tales (not that dark, but not happy, fluffy unicorns), with feminist subversion that was so great to see! I would highly recommend this for those who are fans of fairy tales and want a fresh palate cleanser of a book.
I absolutely love this book! I read it at a time where I was reading all these re-told fairy tales, but none of them were told quite like this. After I read it I couldn't get enough of Emma Donoghue, and she's become one of my favorite authors.
im always skeptical of things comp'd to the bloody chamber, but i had a need for the good prose, and boy did this deliver. not all the stories hit me right in the center, but the ones that did were amazing. very happy to have read this and will probs buy a hardcopy.
I like the concept of this book, and the stories were good. However, because the stories are short there isn't much character development, & because there are different characters it was difficult to keep track of whose story I was on. Overall though, I liked it.
