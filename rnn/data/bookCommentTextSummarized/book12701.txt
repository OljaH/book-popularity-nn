Desilude-me que o interior do livro não seja também com páginas duras, pois a ideia que tinha era que o livro era todo em "cartão". (ISBN 0736421971)Excepto isto, adorei!! 4 estrelas e não cinco, pela pequena desilusão.
She cast a spell upon the handsome prince, a spell that transformed him into an ugly beast, his personality now reflected by his appearance.
The spell was signified by a rose, if the prince found true love before the last rose petal fell, he would be himself again, if he did not however, he would remain the beast for ever.In a village close by, there lived a beautiful girl with an equally beautiful personality, her name was Belle.
My children and grandchildren loved this book. Pure nostalgia.

5/5
This a great classical story that many have read growing up. This story is about a prince who was turned into a beast and lives alone in his castle. In this story there are many house hold items like tea cups, spoons, and candle holders all talk. Far from all this fictional characters the message in the story is great for children to learn about. It teaches us that beauty is not about appearance but what's with in, and you can't make assumptions on what you see.
I wonder why my family has the “Beauty And The Best” ‘Little Golden Book’ from 1991.
It never interested me to see “Beauty And The Best”, even though I enjoyed others that came out after high school, like “Alladin” and “Jumanji”.
I didn't know if “Beauty And The Best” was a new story and a new Walt Disney film.
A castle full of magic and incredible objects, all helpful but secretly needing Belle to save them, is stirring.
Belle had the run of a nearly empty castle but her Father searches for her in the snow?
This story is about a prince who was turned into a Beast, because he refused to allow her to live in his castle.
His servants were turned into servants as a consequence of the refusal, as well.
If the Beast wanted to break the horrid spell, he had to make someone love him, before the last petal fell off of a rose.
A woman named Belle ended up being the one who fell in love with the Beast, which then caused them to live happily ever after, once he turned back to a prince.
It is a classic story.
I am a huge fan of Beauty and the Beast and enjoy rereading various books that Disney publishes for it and this one from Golden Books made me a very happy camper. I don't care if you are 2 or 100+, if you enjoy a book then enjoy that book even if it is below your 'reading level'. Sometimes you just need something short and sweet.The illustrations are true to the designs of the movie for the most part and help retell the story and make great drawing reference for Belle and Beast.
All I have to say is it's Disney! What a great book for kids (Adult Jeff's as well) of all ages. This book makes me want to go to Disney work so that I can give Gaston a hard time at the park. If you haven't read this book to your kids, they are missing out. This book will show them that it's what's on the inside that counts.
This book is about a girl who takes the place for her father, in captivity. At first she hated the person who held her captive, the Beast, but over time she grew to love him. This book has many pictures and has a cute story, so I would say this book is for kindergarten/ preschool. I gave this book four stars because this is a beloved book of mine.
This is a wonderful book to use to teach children that beauty is not only on the outside, but also on the inside. You can't only like someone for what is on the outside, as inside they may be very caring, loving, and affectionate. Children will love how the beast transforms into a prince at the end of the story.
This book is about a father who picks a rose at the Beast's kingdom and must sacrifice himself to live in the castle the rest of his life as punishment for taking a rose for his daughter. His daughter Belle decides she doesn't want him to suffer so she takes his place and ends up falling in the love with the beast and breaking the spell.
I love this story!!!!!

My most favorite Disney princess story. Loved watching the movie again - this time with my son and then reading this small book.
I honestly love this book and it is my book of a foundation, meaning the book that got me into the love of reading in the first place. I relate to the main character of belle not fitting in trying to help the world. I would recommend this book to preschoolers to read and honestly think they can learn how to be respectful and kind children as they develop their developing skills.

The classical Beauty and the Beast tells a story of a beast who was once a prince who was under a spell for being selfish.
In order for the beast to turn into a prince again, he must find true love to undo the spell before all the rose petals fell.
However, the beauty and the beast then fall in love with each other, where the spell is then broken.
It furthermore, can devise a discussion based on not to judge someone by what they look like but what really counts is within ourselves.
Beauty and the beast is my all-time favorite fairy tale, ever.
Belle is my favorite Disney princess and this book does a great job of telling the story.
I always found this story so interesting how a beast would steal Belle in order to break a curse, but in the end fall in love with each other.
I like how when the beast is sad the book seems to have darker colors versus when the beast changes to the prince or when belle is happy in the beginning all the colors are so bright and I love her bright yellow dress I think it helps enlighten the mood of the happy parts of the book.
The Beast was once a man, but a witch cast a spell on him for being rude to her and turning her away when she asked for help.
I believe this is a very good example of a fantasy story.
In the story there is a witch who casts a spell on a man and turns him into an ugly beast.
The moral of the story was to always be kind to those who need help, because one day karma might get you for turning away someone you should have helped.
Beauty and the Beast will always be one of my favorite fantasy books.
This is a great read for children even though you might here a couple of "ewws" and "noo"'s out of the crowd once you read this story to them.
This is a great read because children love books with animals in it, especially when they find out that they are talking animals.
The objects and materials in the story coming to life and having musicals and talking to each other are really important I this book to the child's imagination.
I really believe this book can be read by any age.
