Because of this Collingwood argues that history ends in the present; the historian's task is to understand how it came to be, but can say nothing about the future because it no more exists than the past.
Hence Collingwood's lapidary assertion, a stone cast into the very foundations of history itself: "The history of thought, and therefore all history, is the re-enactment of past thought in the historian's own mind" (ibid.) A stunning claim, and a controversial one.
Metaphysical, for history is an attempt to unite in the concrete reality of the present the wholly ideal existences of the past and the future.
This is a highly specialized topic written for a book.
His main points were repeatedly reiterated throughout the book.
And he used common and shared experiences to drive his ideas home; that history is a different kind of science than what's being oftenly accepted, but its a science nevertheless; and historical thought is achieved by reenacting the historical events in one's own mind and reliven it.
I view the Idea of History as a book that describes whats going on inside a historian's mind: his hopes and fears, his assertions and contentions, and the pursuit of objectivity within an intrinsically subjective-minded kind of inquiry.
Rather than an overt view of mankind with the Greco-Roman History, the optimistic idea of human nature was replaced with an understanding of mankind’s downfall of original sin.
According to Collingwood, due to the overly optimistic view of mankind in the enlightenment, many rejected and had no sympathy for the non-rationalistic period of human history within the Medieval period.
While each period’s historiography and view of mankind is formed from pendulum swings and revolts, as students of the Bible we need to keep in mind that the scriptures form and inform our anthropology and our presuppositional lenses in which we assess and understand history.

Self-knowledge is not anatomy and physiology, nor feeling, sensation, or emotion, but thought understanding, or reason [205]b) To understand the human mind we must use the same approach in which we study naturec) Observe the ways in which the mind works, then establish the laws which govern them.
So, history is the re-enactment of past thought in the historians mind, and criticized within the context of his own thoughts and time.e) Thus, the field of historical knowledge is limited to human affairs, because only here lies human thought [216]3.

As a text, he assigned Patrick Gardiner's Theories of History (1959) (The field does not move quickly.) Included in that book were readings from R.G. Collingwood's The Idea of History.
Professor Addis also listed Collingwood's book in the syllabus as a work to read in its entirety if we wanted to write about it.
Curious, but still behind the curve.Since then, reading E.H. Carr, John Lukacs, John Lewis Gaddis, Niall Ferguson, Owen Barfield and others writing about history as a way of knowing, Collingwood's name kept popping up.
His presentation of the major thinkers in the realms of history and of philosophy has him fitting the forebears of thought into a larger geometry of which functions as a set of records in the architecture of the past.
This book subsequently gave rise to my thoughts about the existence of an architecture of imagination present in the writing of historical novels.
Ultimately, Collingwood's clear thought on a web of ideas in The Idea of History is a treat presented as a philosophical treatise and {set} of answers for the writers and recipients of historical writing - by answering a capital Q question, Why do historians write?
The view that history has an inner and outer contingency is the salvation of the study of history itself.
Reading Von Ranke or Mommsen is like reading a chronicler, whereas Tuchman is like reading a novelist.
This is extreme, but the two movements toward understanding are both necessary to get any enriching contribution to the study of history - ultimately the study of humanity in the present.
Read this along with Spengler, Toynbee, Marx - any theorist of history, and you will see the sweep of Collingwood's erudition.
Importantly, he brings the task of history back under the scope of philosophy itself.
A quarter of the text or so covers developments in how older periods/cultures conceived history, ending up with the Germans/Hegel.
There are then a few essays of his own where he explicitly covers his own "idea" of history.I read this in parts, first as a grad student getting my feet wet with this stuff.
In light of some more recent reading on Hegel and the ubiquity of that Zizek guy, I'd like to reread the second part of this book and see what parallels may or may not be warranted!
Lots of good thoughts on what it means to "recapture" history and what the limits of history are.
We can only work our way closer to a more ideal version of the past...we never have "the past as it actually was." All history is the history of thought, since the past is ideal and therefore only exists in interpretations.
Nothing is evidence until we've asked it a question.
He gets strangely Hegelian toward the end, but his other thoughts are good enough (and he changes Hegel enough) that it's almost okay.

Reads much more modern than 1936 in my opinion... well, until you get to the parts where C recommends getting into your chosen people's heads to reenact the past.The historical part is kind of a fun philosophical and wooly ride, and so's the murder mystery in the epilogue.
Do they still require undergrads in history to read this? I thought it wasn't too great in 1988, and even reading it again more than a decade later, I'm still not impressed. I would have benefitted so much more from a solid research "how to" text than this jargon.
Collingwood explains the development of the philosophy of history from the Greco-Roman period to modern times before laying out his conception of what the philosophy of history should be.
There is a tendency to expect the reader to have knowledge of the work of some of the great philosophers and there are sprinklings of Greek, Latin and German that could beneficially be translated for those who do not understand these languages.
It was written at a time when scholars would have had a greater knowledge of these languages and concepts perhaps, which leaves the modern reader slightly adrift.
The majority of the book is a critique of various historians and approaches to history over the last few centuries going back to Ancient Greece and Rome.
In many cases, prior knowledge of the works is assumed, which makes this challenging for those without a detailed knowledge of academic history.
This is a shame because the idea of the idea of history is quite interesting to explore.
The final section is an attempt by Collingwood to draw all the themes and critiques together into a central theory.
It is no doubt an academic theory of history by an academic for academics when it could easily have been made more accessible.
As it approaches Kant and Hegel, becomes a difficult and troublesome read, requiring knowledge of german idealism.The last part of the book is the essay on the idea of history properly, according to the view of Mr. Collingwood.
The so called re-enactment vision is an interesting novelty, that might suppport modern attempts to revive narrative history and the role of individuals.
Arriving at the end of the book, the reader falls short in receiving a practical and clear explanation of what such a vision would mean in practice.
While I appreciate a good analysis of what "history is" this one sort of made my head hurt.
The psychology of history is a tough one for the mind to grasp and I think without an immersion into the topic it certainly not something the amateur historian is going to grasp to the extent this book presents.
I believe I have a decent grasp of analyzing and researching history but certainly nowhere close to the extent it would take to employ the techniques Mr. Collingwood presents.
All that being said it is still a good topic and the book presents it in detail.
Summary of Historical ThoughtCollingwood attempts a massive diagnosis of the philosophy of history and the history of historical methodology. The best part of the book is when he talks about Greek and Roman historians.Since Collingwood died without finishing the book it would be unfair to put the problems in the later part of the book at his door.The books, though flawed, leaves the reader with an appreciation of what goes into the creation of history.
This book was compiled posthumously from unfinished essays, fragments and notes that Collingwood didn’t get around to integrating into a coherent whole before his death. It is repetitive and in places half-baked. But that hasn’t stopped it from being hugely influential. I am not sure what to make of it yet but am going to read the Reader’s Guide by Peter Johnson next to see if that helps.
Excellent study of how history has been written and the concept of history from earliest days until the beginnings of the twentieth century. Wish I had discovered this when I first began my major in history. At one time from what I gather this was one the reading list for classes in historiography. Primed now to go back and read the early Greek historians again.

3.5 stars. A really important contribution to the philosophy of history. I don't agree with all of Collingwood's assertions, but his ideas have made a distinct impact on the discipline.
Excellent book on historiography. One of the best books on philosophy of history, published back in c. 1950s. It is a work of high scholarship yet you may not agree with it at certain times.

This is pretty interesting.
Collingwood seems like on of the first historians to really utilize ideas from evolutionary theory and modern psychology in his ideas about history.
He manages to create a view of history that is centered on the individual attempting to inhabit and understand the mental states of the past, and while I have some major issues with that, the way he structures it feels nuanced and genuine instead of cheaply nostalgic.
And sometimes out of the blue he will just throw out an observation that's about 60 years ahead of its time.
For an Oxford don, he's pretty damn quirky
"history is historically contingent" -- surely a revolutionary thesis in it's time (1946) -- now feels a bit like old news. The writing is exceedingly clear and analytical, which maybe says something interesting about the necessity of high-falutin syntax for the promulgation of said revolutionary thesises.
Intriguing to analyze, albeit tedious and slow to read. Well worth the effort, but remember to keep an open mind and explore other history philosophies, too, in order to gain a thorough appreciation of Collingwood.
antiguo pero necesario a la hora de ordenar algunos conceptos.
I did not find his views or arguments convincing; not very practical.
