Massive, massive, MASSIVE disappointment.Obvious spoilers ahead.The premise for this book is amazing; a boy named Bartholomew loses his sight at the age of three, when surgeons remove his eyes to save him from fast spreading cancer, and then, though eyeless, regains it at the age of thirteen.Thinking that it could be a fun, fast paced daredevil-like story, with quantum theory involved, I was setting my hopes high.
MY VERY FAVORITE KOONTZ WORK OF ALL TIME!!!
(I would also like to note that it is his favorite accomplishment as well.) This book was recommended to me when I was 17 by my husband to-be and was the first Dean Koontz book I ever read.
I don't know how a person fits so many dimensions into one book but Dean pulls it off like it's child's play.
The writing style is so fluid you almost forget you are reading and the pages turn by themselves.
This is my all-time favorite book and a MUST READ!
Ok read! intriguing and twisted but a little rushed with the storyline (paperback!)
yay!" Boy, was I fooled.The book then went on to detail the boy being born and growing up (all before he loses his sight).
Yay!Psycho discovers that a girl he once raped gave birth to a baby, and determines that this baby must be the boy whose name he muttered in his sleep (logical, yes?).
Oh, except that when psycho comes up to kill blind boy, the little girl (who just so happens to ALSO have super powers-- crazy) shoves him, and he falls through their little hole in reality, and is gone forever.
I guess I would give this a 1.5 if I could.
It's readable but you kind of regret spending the time on this.
Maybe if it was half the size it wouldn't have pissed me off - but 768 pages?
And I felt like it was doing some preachy religious allegory crap at me.
What the hell is your point with this book Dean Koontz?
I feel like there were huge holes in the plot on this one and it was just the weakest thing I had read by him.
WTF DEAN KOONTZ?
Each smallest act of kindness—even just words of hope when they are needed, the remembrance of a birthday, a compliment that engenders a smile—reverberates across great distances and spans of time, affecting lives unknown to the one whose generous spirit was the source of this good echo, because kindness is passed on and grows each time it’s passed, until a simple courtesy becomes an act of selfless courage years later and far away.
There are good number of biblical references, with most characters having a biblical corollary; especially Bartholomew, one of the heroes of the story, who has as his namesake one of the lesser known Apostles.In the end, it's clear that Koontz is mixing a good stalker-murder-thriller with an interesting theory about religion and quantum physics...
namely, that religion and quantum physics can not only coexist but actually support each other.If none of that makes sense, you probably just need to read the book.
Actual rating is 3.5 stars.In this novel, we have three different stories that will eventually come together.
She is pregnant from this incident.This was a difficult novel to rate.
In fact, out of all the books I have read this book is in my top five for emotional impact.
With the previous sentiments about this book why not a five star rating?
The author could have written some more pages about the climax (ironic since I just said this book needed to be trimmed) and my fulfillment would have been satisfied.Emotionally, I adore this book.
Within the horror/suspense genre, Koontz generally writes two types of novels: 'government conspiracies', or 'madman chasing an innocent man/child/woman/dog/couple/ all of the above.' The gov't ones are fine, as a matter of fact, it was "Strangers" that got me hooked on DK.
But there's only so much you can do with 'black ops' and 'the government within the government.'While "From the Corner of His Eye" DOES have a madman chasing innocent people (WHAT?
"From the Corner of His Eye" is far more than suspense (and there IS still plenty of it)...it is a deep, powerful SPIRITUAL book.The characters are some of Koontz's best.
There are several of his more recent offerings that I have really enjoyed and this is one.Also he has one of his more "interesting" villains here.
You can't laugh at the evil bloody acts, but the interesting "mental gymnastics" of this guy are well done.
Koontz moves into the realm of science fiction/science fantasy here and it's an interesting "take".
As mentioned the story very much circles around the many (somewhat esoteric) characters.
But by far our Villain (Enoch Cain Jr) is one of Koontz'z more weird and fairly original creations.
The villain's evil, the kids are cute.
I really enjoyed this Koontz book.
Yes, it got a bit overly sentimental at times, but on the whole I preferred it to some of the other Koontz books I've read lately, which have been hugely formulaic and so very predictable!
I enjoyed the multiple universe aspects (not sure how a few of the explanations would go with real scientists, but I'm not one of them, so no problem there) and the twists and turns.
Of course, if you don't enjoy drama, detail, deep character development, a bit of a spiritual journey, and, of course, a dog - isn't there always a dog somewhere in a Koontz novel??

From The Corner Of His Eye	Bantam Books, 2000, 729pp., $7.99Dean Koontz ISBN 0553582747 Imagine being in labor, with your husband lying dead beside you.

Dean Koontz thought up this terrible scene- among others- in one of his great page-turners, From the Corner of His Eye. At first this story seems bland and confusing because of its two seemingly separated plots.
Some of them are plain strange and make you wonder what he was smoking when he sat down that day...and why he wasn't sharing.This book had the benefit of being both brilliant in many ways, and of being one of the stories that makes you scratch your head and wonder.I loved the separate yet slowly intertwining stories of all the characters.
I want to do that, too!"Some of the delusional characters that Koontz writes up, man...like Junior, in this one...wow.
Each smallest act of kindness reverberates across great distances and spans of time, affecting lives unknown to the one whose generous spirit was the source of this good echo, because kindness is passed on and grows each time it's passed, until a simple courtesy becomes an act of selfless courage years later and far away.
Likewise, each small meanness, each expression of hatred, each act of evil.-THIS MOMENTOUS DAY, H.R. White (As created & mentioned by Dean Koontz in  One Door Away From Heaven)This great saga reaffirms my belief in alternate realities and parallel universes.
He's the antagonist, evil personified, yet thinks he's God's gift.Covering aspects of religion, faith, love, family and quantum physics, may at first glance, seem a strange mix, but it works really well.
The physics side of things is explained well so is easy to understand and see why it was used.There's a line towards the end of the book that says, "More often than not, God weaves patterns that become perceptible to us only over long periods of time, if at all." Koontz has woven patterns throughout the book, which does take a long period of time to read, but I think everyone should.
Mixed thoughts... review later.
I am a huge Koontz fan but this just did not do it for me.
The beginning was shocking and twisted....
But then the story got bloated and complicated and at the end died a quick death (fortunately).
Why did the author spend all that time (and pages) developing the evil Enoch Cain only to have him evaporate in one sentence!?
And in the beginning the reader was subjected to painfully articulate hour by hour, day by day accounts of 3 story lines.
Then at the end it was rushed to decades by decades.
This was truly a story I couldn't wait to finish, but only because I had to justify all the time I spent turning pages!
However, at his worse moments he comes up with great ideas but does nothing with them.
The action was both slow and silly, and the villain dispatched too easily after a great build up.
The connection between God and quantam physics was introduced but not fleshed out very well.
I don't know if he wanted us to feel stupid by not explaining why he introduced these concepts, or awed by the child prodigy hero.
I disliked writers who introduce ideas then don't flesh them out.
In the Corner of his Eye was an interesting but disappointing read.
From the Corner of His Eyeby Dean KoontzBantam, 729 pages, paperback, 2001; reissue of a bookoriginally published in 2001Dean Koontz is probably, right now, the most underestimatedwriter at work in the field of fantastic literature. The reasonsare not hard to fathom. Unlike most authors, who go through thelearning process before they ever see print, Koontz had themisfortune  although of course it must have seemed far fromthat to him at the time  to find publishers for his early,clumsy attempts,
There are other books inCain's library  almost all purchased from the Book of theMonth Club, of which he is inordinately proud to be a member but somehow he has never quite had the time to read morethan a page or two of any of them, obviously believing that,through their very possession, he has transformed himself intoLiterary Man through some sort of osmotic process.But Cain is not the only character in this long and much-woven novel to leap out of the page and permanently imprint onthe mind.
It’s a book which introduces us to many different characters in many different places, and in the end it all comes together.Koontz has hinted at his fascination with quantum theory and the possibility of other worlds in parallel dimensions in his Chris Snow books, and here he takes it one step further by introducing characters that have some kind of special sense about the way things are, and who can also manipulate those dimensions.
The book really resonates with me, which is probably the reason why I often place it on my number one spot of favourite Koontz books.The most intriguing character in the novel is the villain, Junior Cain.
We think we sense a sweetness in Junior Cain’s character, until it takes an unexpected turn.Junior Cain isn't a religious man.
He is a man on a quest for self perfection while believing that life is for pleasure, ungoverned by the concept of right or wrong.
Even as he envisions a future of perfection and pleasure, his choices lead him down the twisted and thorny path of evil and suffering.
We pull for them, feel for them, and want to protect them from the guy with twisted thoughts and purposes.Good versus evil.
Koontz’s writing is poetic and in this novel perhaps a bit too beautiful for the attention it calls to itself.
Although I enjoyed this book, for the most part, it's got major flaws.If you're familiar with Dean Koontz, you know that sometimes (well, most of the time), he overdoes it.
Describes things in entirely too much detail, takes 5 pages to explain something that could be told in 3 paragraphs, etc.
In my opinion, it could have been cut by about 200 pages and still told the story just fine.The story centers around 2 characters, mainly: a boy named Bartholomew, who is born under extreme circumstances and loses his sight at the age of 3, and a man named Junior, who is a nutcase of the first order, basically.
What makes this book special is the mix of several themes that work in superb harmony - a psychotic killer, quantum physics and faith.
Koontz uses Enoch Cain's obsessed journey to find Bartholomew as a background to highlight the connection between human beings' lives, a sort of 'Butterfly effect' among people's destinies.
There is an underlying theme of hope that runs through this book, and Koontz does a great job of balancing it with the pure evil that is Enoch Cain.
The pace never slacks, and while I like all the author's works (that I have read so far), this one just went beyond the regular gripping thriller category.
Wow, this book kept me interested for some 750+ pages!
His delusions and more than that-his pure evil drive him towards what I think he sees as his survival.
That survival, in his mind involves the death of someone named Bartholomew, who turns out to be a child.
Dean Koontz must have really thought that this was the ultimate evil character (I Agree) --I say that because it seems everyone else in the book is ultimate good--It was going to take a lot of goodness to bring this guy down!
This book has many interesting themes and I enjoyed them all.
The major themes are chase versus emotions.
Junior recovers in a hospital bed with a hounding detective Tom Vandadium always at his beside waiting for a confession.
But why does Junior say "Bartholomew" from his bed when in a comma?
The major chases are Junior for Barty (Bartholomew) and Tom for Junior.
The emotions are with Barty's (Bartholomew) supernatural talents and blindness at age 3 with Agnes (mom) plus Angel and her aunt Celestina (adopted for her murdered sister, Phimie White).
When Barty is blind, in chapter(s) he is told God is always looking "from the corner of his eye".
I thought that this was one of the most unusual books that Dean Koontz has ever written and those who read and follow his works can attest that he has written some very unusual ones in the past.
The two characters that really carry the story are Bartholomew and Angel...who were born on the same day...born surrounded by death...and an entire continent apart...
The character of Enoch is a man that carries something that demands a sacrifice occasionally causing the reader to be undecided if you should like him...feel pity for him...or just outright hate him.
It's a long, long book but a story that you just have to see to the last page.
Enoch Cain has you believing he is a good and loving man as the book begins, but then he does something that totally leaves you in shock, and after a while you begin to see what an evil person he is.
The way Dean Koontz brings all the characters together is very clever.
This book has everything, but what I particularly like is that there is a moral tone all the way through.
This book is a thriller with spirituality.
It has your pulse racing, a few tears here and there and the spiritual side (you may die here, but in other parallel worlds you didn't die) leaves you thinking and wondering..........
I only give 5 stars to page turners I am obsessed with.
Not an obsessive page turner but a very good book.
This is the only book I have ever read that I cried when a character died.
For Dean Koontz fans some of the story lines will be familiar but presented in a different way.
(view spoiler)[ The villain is a severely mentally ill person.
Dean Koontz presents this illness through the villains own eyes showing his warped sense of reality which is an amazing view point.
(view spoiler)[ Complex story that comes together well.
I’m a big Koontz fan but dear God I hate it when he goes off on a quasi-religious bent. This book is simply awful. I’ll save you a coupe of weeks of your life ploughing through the 500 pages. Everything is cool, God has a plan.
