Whilst Vampires are still unaccountably evil in this novel, they are also relatable, capable of sparking our empathy and intimate to us on a level not really seen previously to this novel.Published in 1976, it is the story of the world's most boring vampire, Louis.
The dark seducer, Lestat, and the repressed sexual being, Claudia, both destroy Louis in vastly different ways and it's a nice, depressing change from the usual state of affairs.But still, on its own, it's not a fantastic book.
It may have popularized Vampire Empathizing, but it's probably also responsible for a lot of terrible gothic poetry.And in case you're wondering if the movie is better than the book?
It's probably more a 3 1/2 star book, but I'm going to go for four stars because of the amazing characters.  “The world changes, we do not, therein lies the irony that kills us.”    Twilight jokes aside, I really enjoyed reading this novel.Make room on your book bucket lists because Anne Rice's Interview with the Vampire is a must read. One of my casual resolutions this year was to catch up on some of the books I've been meaning to read for a while, but just never got around to. I'm so glad I fi
Twilight jokes aside, I really enjoyed reading this novel.Make room on your book bucket lists because Anne Rice's Interview with the Vampire is a must read.
I'm so glad I finally picked up this book.
There was nothing but the soft roar of the waves.”   What I loved most about the book The bromance of Lestat and Louis.
And I saw my last sunrise.
I remember it completely; yet I do not think I remember any other sunrise before it.”  
Maybe my love for vampires isn't dead after all.P.S. I finished the book, Patty!
I have to say I liked the movie better. I mean eye candy! I have wanted to read this series forever and since one of my groups is doing a challenge for a badge I thought now would be perfect. BUT, if they don't get better I'm not going to waste my time. Too many books to waste time any more 😊Happy Reading! Mel ❤️
You begin.It seems like it might be fun.
A little bit trashy, but fun.
It seems pointless.You are bored, your mind wanders.You keep reading.You cannot stop.It is dark.So dark.The atmosphere.Dark.
Haunting.Erotic.You are trapped.Trapped in someone's twisted fantasy.Kinky.Until pain and suffering and anguish and loneliness are beautiful.Alluring.Seductive.But you know that they are not, and no book will make it so.You keep reading.You are bored.
You put the book down.But you have to finish it.You keep reading.
You read.Waiting for gratification.Waiting for something to happen.Waiting.You cannot look away.You keep reading.It is a beautiful day outside.You keep reading.So dark.So sensual.So strange.The plot shifts.A small climax.You groan.Sigh.Still a hundred and fifty pages left.You keep reading.Repelled.Attracted.You shift positions.You ache for more.You keep reading....Blam!
One of the rare few books I couldn't finish.
The forest was beautiful, the night sky was beautiful, the homeless people were beautiful...not normally, mind you, only when seen through vampire eyes.These special vampire eyes might be the reason why Louis (narrator) and Lestat (sort of bad guy) spend most of their time making moon eyes at one another.
Aside from the characters adopting a girl (which was entertaining), Louis spends most of his time admiring things or arguing with Lestat.
Skip the book, watch the movie.
I first read this book in High School and my sad gothic self immediately fell in love with its beautiful, damaged characters.
For years this book haunted me.
Louis is turned into a vampire and continues his search for the answers: who he is, why he is, what his place is.
He wars with lovers, family and friends in his search to define his own life only to discover that nothing he does matters and that everyone is just as lost as he is, an ultimately there are no answers but the ones we make ourselves.
Not only that, you made me read a vampire book with a cover made entirely of shiny ostentatious material that shouted to everyone in the library as I checked this out, "Look everyone!
God, I miss those days - to the point where I considered giving this an extra star, just because I was so grateful to read a story about vampires who do actual vampire stuff and it's sexy and scary instead of boring and schmoopy.
For in becoming immortal they want all the forms of their life to be fixed as they are and incorruptible...When, in fact, all things change except the vampire himself; everything except the vampire is subject to constant corruption and distortion.
The whole story comes along with a good measure of dark sensuality, which I particularly like.
How many people in reality live tortured by guilt and loneliness and feel different than everybody else the way Louis does?
Or how many people are forced to live and suffer with someone they can never quite connect to, out of necessity, loneliness, because they love them despite all, or all three at once?
I think many people can relate to the heroes (I should say anti-heroes, really) of this dark tale.What is loneliness?
What does it mean to be good?
What does it mean to be evil?
Anne Rice shows an amazing skill in reflecting people's feelings and struggles.
The old mouse, eating the pure clean flesh of new born mice, gets younger.
I don't know whether this video is real or fake.
So explains why Vampires predate, as in hunt, feed off, suck the blood of humans.
So, the Vatican probably owns the Alfa Romeo car company, secretly it would appear.
They are swords.Now let's look at the Alfa Romeo badge.
The outer circle, enveloping around, spells the words Alfa Romeo.
To the left of the inner circle is the Red Cross of St. George.
So Rome is top dog.To left of the inner circle is the St. George Flag.
He caminado por las calles de Nueva Orleans como el Segador Maldito y me he alimentado de vida humana para mantener mi propia existencia. No soy un mortal, padre; soy inmortal y condenado, como los ángeles puestos en el infierno por Dios. Soy un vampiro.  Hacía tiempo que no leía sobre vampiros, y quería darle una oportunidad a los famosos vampiros de Rice, conocidos por algunos (como yo) por la icónica película de “Entrevista con el vampiro” que lleva el mismo nombre del primer libro de la sag
A diferencia de otros libros de vampiros que he leído, acá, la historia está totalmente centrada en los inmortales, se nos presentan tres vampiros que van a formar una especie de familia moderna conviviendo gran parte de la historia, cada vampiro tiene una personalidad muy marcada, tenemos a Louis el protagonista, él es quien nos narrara su vida, su muerte y su inmortalidad.Louis representa la melancolía, la tristeza y autocondenación, él se odia a si mismo por ser vampiro, desprecia el tener que matar para sobrevivir, y tiene una búsqueda personal de lo sobrenatural y lo ético, ¿existe Dios?
And Louis gave way more personal insight (imho) than you would give in an interview, if that makes sense...And then there's Lestat...
But I've been assured by TL that The Vampire Lestat will change my mind, so I'm looking forward to reading the next book in the series.
After all, Anne Rice is a great writer and I love vampires.Overall, looking past the interview format (which may bother only me) and Louis' whining (which should bother everyone), the book was really good.
I couldn't handle horror movies or scary books at the time, but Brad Pitt, Antonio Banderas and a surprisingly good Tom Cruise really got my attention.
I'm working toward reading everything Rice has written, and now I enjoy many other authors who write about vampires.
Rice was the first author to make her vampires complex enough to keep my attention and, more importantly, make me actually **LIKE** them as they go around ripping people's throats out.
I'm a sucker for well-developed characters, but in this book and the rest of Rice's work, it's the setting that draws me in most of all.
Alternatively, forever is a long time to go without a solid meal and you know you'll eventually start complaining that dinner always tastes the same.Flight/ surprisingly speedy turns of movement - being super fast is a handy skill to have if you need to face the pacey modern lifestyle of the 21st century.
On the downside no one ever said eternal rest would be a comfortable one.Interview with the Vampire takes itself pretty seriously (a lot more seriously than this review), and despite the fact Louis' hand wringing and tortured immortal soul act did start to grate on me towards the end, overall I enjoyed this and was able to stop raising my eye brows long enough to appreciate the detail and originality of the story.
As it stands I have been exposed to far too many broody, I-am-a-monster-look-at-me-punish-myself vampires to feel much of anything for Louis.
This story is told from the perspective of Louis, and while it strives to pull away and make history feel like present day it never succeeded at actually pulling me from that dimly lit kitchen into the history he was sharing.
Now none of this is me saying I didn’t like Interview with the Vampire, I just didn’t love it.
She was horrifying and monstrous, the way child vampires tend to be in any story.
I thought it was slow, difficult to read. I finished it only by sheer determination, not out of pleasure.
The pace drags along and, for being a horror novel, it's not horrific, mainly dull.Now, as back in high school, I wanted more information about what happened to Louis's brother at the very start.
(view spoiler)[If he had not lost his brother, he would not have been undone by grief, and then he wouldn't have wandered the streets and been found by Lestat.
Louis was simply too "sensitive" to do what was necessary.Anyway, between the whining, the incomplete background information, and black/white view of good and evil, I did not enjoy Interview with the Vampire nearly as much as I had hoped I would.
*** 4.5 'Shut Up,Louis' Stars ***  .
. Okay, okay, I haven't actually read the twilight series but you have to admit Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt make a much hotter couple than Robert Pattison and Kristen Stewart.
** liars!**To those who haven't read Interview with the Vampire ( 'the' ?..
. all this time I thought it was "Interview with a Vampire")  because you've already watched the film---> READ IT.
While Hollywood managed to capture the essence of the story to a cinematic degree, in my humble opinion they fell short in regards to the characters themselves.
So will I continue reading the series ?
Still, though, this first book of the series continues to be surprisingly strong, even if it single-handedly brought about an entire "goth industry" that threatens to turn all of Rice's original material into parodies of itself.
A sprawling epic that is as much a vivid fictional history of the multicultural founding of America as it is a tale about vampires, it is this tale that forever entwined this particular horror staple with the dandiness of the Southern Gothic style, a union that wasn't so obvious before Rice, lest we forget.
This year's glut of filmed Vampire adaptations -- HBO's True Blood, based on Charlaine Harris's Sookie Stackhouse books, and Stephanie Meyer's Twilight -- got me longing for a good Vampire fix again, something well written, something weighty, something inventive, something that was targeted for an audience with literary tastes rather than your regular purveyor of pop culture.The hunt was on.My mind slipped straight through its familiar fondness for Anne Rice's Vampire Chronicles and dismissed her work as the wrong place to go to find my fix.
Anne Rice has Louis tell his entire life story to some idiot journalist that reflects the reader's supposed ignorance to the world of the vampire.
Instead there is Louis telling us his life story in a conversational, and confiding, manner to an idiot journalist who barely understands it as signified by the ending.
“I lived like a man who wanted to die but who had no courage to do it himself.”Despite knowing the ending in advance, and still being excited to reach it, the final payoff was as disappointing as the movie version.
It's hard to admit that a movie with Tom Cruise in it could actually be less boring than a book.But there you go.I read this when I was a teen, and I had a much higher tolerance for meandering bullshit plots than I do now, so my review was originally 3 stars. However, on reflection...Yeah. This was pretty much crap.Sorry if this offends any Rice fanatics.Hmmm. No, on reflection I really don't care who it offends.
The subsequent paperback release did marginally better, but the book’s reputation grew steadily over time, and eventually a cult following developed, especially among the goth subculture, the LGBT community and female readers.Before I say anything else about Interview, I have to say how unusually dark it is and I have read some really dark books in my time.
This is the story about Louis’ struggle with coping with the fact that he is an immortal and destined to live forever.
As the novel progresses it becomes simply passionate in its language, coinciding with Louis’ appreciation of his new-found perception of life, which is integrated with periods of frustration.
Can a book be disappointing if I expected not to like it?
Impressive endorsement, eh?So, OK, here's the book, Cliffs Notes version: There is a vampire giving an interview to a mortal "boy", telling his life story.
They travel around and find zombie vampires, ask some more questions about them...
I mean MY point, because I still don't think the book has one.
I've finished two of Rice's books, ever, out of a combined 7 or 8 or so attempts, if I remember correctly, and I didn't like either of them.
The writing in this book is beautiful. Ms. Rice can describe a scene with alluring clarity. The story itself is unlike any other I have read in the vampire genre. I will absolutely be continuing with this series, but not right away. Too many reading obligations at the moment. I am looking forward to the next chapter in this story. 3.75 stars
Anne Rice's vampire chronicles made me love reading books.
Louis is a dreadful vampire.
I like to read about unapologetic vampires who thrive and are confident and kick-ass.
This is NOT that kind of story.It does read like a "new" classic with lots of literary phrases and descriptions.
Lestat is sort of a villainous caricature here (readers know he is fleshed out in future books and becomes much more complex than any of the vampires in this series, for better or worse).
I think I like a little more bite in my vampire books now.
It's really difficult (read: impossible) for me to care enough to bother with reading a book by an author who thinks:1) that negative reviews are "bullying"2) that Amazon reviewers deserve to be put on blast for her followers to harass3) that anyone who dislikes her books "just didn't get it"
This is one of those books that I’ve wanted to read for ages but always put off because I’m scared it won’t meet my expectations.
I’m really glad I finally read it because it absolutely surpassed my expectations and I loved it!
This is definitely one of THE best vampire books I’ve ever read and I’m so glad I finally got up the courage to read it.
Anne Rice has such a captivating writing style, it’s beautifully poetic and I’m looking forward to reading more of her work.

Πρωτοεκδόθηκε το 1976, έγινε ταινία το 1994 (σε ένα καστ όπου χώρεσαν ο Τομ Κρουζ, ο Μπραντ Πιτ και ο Αντόνιο Μπαντέρας και μάλιστα ήταν πολύ καλοί), βέβαια στα ελληνικά έπρεπε να φτάσουμε στο 2012 για να εκδοθεί (κάτι που έμαθα από τη βάση biblionet, καθώς δεν θυμάμαι ποτέ να πέτυχα το βιβλίο σε κάποιο βιβλιοπωλείο).
Η ματιά της Rice στο σύμπαν που δημιούργησε για μένα κάνουν το βιβλίο βαθιά υπαρξιακό και διαχρονικό, διαφορετικό από οτιδήποτε σύγχρονο "παραμυθάκι" ίσως έχετε διαβάσει!
La soledad, la miseria, el odio y el amor, son emociones humanas, no vampíricas, por lo tanto, no es difícil comprender por qué tantas personas se "enamoraron" de sus vampiros y siguieron toda la saga de novelas vampíricas que esta mujer creo.
Otro de los puntos importantes, es que en alguna medida, todos hemos fantaseado con la inmortalidad, pero muy pocos hemos considerado el precio a pagar por ella (y no me refiero solamente a sobrevivir asesinando gente).
De todos sus libros vampíricos, creo que es el más logrado.
