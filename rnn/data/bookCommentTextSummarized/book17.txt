The book is divided into four parts: (1) the first part deals with the transition from household and clan communities to villages and manors; (2) part two covers the rise of industry and mining up to the industrial revolution; (3) the third part zooms in on the history of commerce and trade in pre-capitalistic societies; (4) in the last part Weber describes the rise of capitalism in the West and tries to explain this rise with his famous Protestant-ethic theory.I will explain some more about each of the parts, but considering the scope of this book, it is a very hard to give every topic in Weber's book a fair hearing (so read the book yourself, it is defintely worth it!).1.
A must read for everyone.
It is true that we find all through history struggles between cliques, factions of nobles, and office-seekers, but nowhere outside the occidental cities are there parties in the present-day sense of the word, and as little are there demagogues in the sense of party leaders and seekers for ministerial posts.
So also the city produced science in the modern sense.
In the city civilization of the Greeks the discipline out of which scientific thinking developed, namely mathematics, was given the form under which it continuously developed down to modern times.
That a peasant could function as a member of a religious group is a strictly modern phenomenon.
Bastante pesada la lectura, sin previas nociones de economía resultaría difícil comprenderlo a totalidad. Weber asocia los fenómenos de una estructura económica definida por los clásicos con los ciclos culturales (para nada estacionarios).
