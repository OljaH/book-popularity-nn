But more on that later.What I really want to talk about is the treatment of the female characters.I don't know how this was even possible, but reading Life and Death actually made me hate Twilight even more than I originally did.
It reads like Meyer decided last minute that she wanted to only do 2 chapters of the gender swap (which she mentions in the Forward), realized she spent all of her deadline time on re-writing the entire book, and quickly wrote an ending hours before she emailed it to her editor.
e.l. james runs out of ideas and desperately rewrites Fifty Shades of Grey from christian's perspective.stephenie meyers "celebrates" Twilight by swapping genders but maintaining heteronormative ideals.e.l. james rewrites Fifty Shades of Grey but where they're all dalmatians this time.stephenie meyers sets Twilight in johannesburg e.l. james makes fifty shades of paper dollsladies - it's time to cut the cord on this and write some new shit.come to my blog!
For one beautiful moment, I thought this wasn't so bad. I mean, yeah, it's Twilight... but "gender bent retelling"? An LGBT Twilight?! That's cool!But no. This is not a gay Twilight between Beau and Edward, but another straight Twilight between Beau and Edythe. She just swapped the genders. Not in a transgender way either... in a "I don't have any new ideas" way.Meyer, please:
This was funny and weird and FASCINATING and I had such a good time reading it! I just loved seeing how everything unfolded from this different perspective. It made Twilight fresh and exciting again, and I really enjoyed it!
(Somewhere in the distance, Robert Pattinson's mouth is agape in a silent scream of terror.)Meanwhile, the fanfiction spinoff is already in the works...
*shrugs*Not a bad deal for me.And sometime in the future, I plan on going back and rereading the bestselling romance that made abstinence seem like the way to go.Because death by vampire penis is kinda scary.
It was just about the least manly thing I've ever read.Or this little gem from Beau:"Outside, I threw the quilt into the middle of the sunniest spot in Charlie's small square yard, then threw myself on top of it."Was that seriously a sentence from a guy's point of view!?Are you for fucking real, Meyer?!The deal was, you were supposed to switch genders.
Great. Just imagine the fan fiction...
(disclaimer: i love stephenie's writing and the twilight saga)This is the only book that I have EVER bought and in the same day, returned it.
I jumped into this blindly because it's been so long since Stephanie Meyer has done ANYTHING (seriously) and although at first I was skeptical, I had to admit, I missed her writing, so I picked this up from target today.
I know that some things are changed, like apparently the ending is different, but this is bullshit.
You can't just change the pronouns of all the characters in a book and then rerelease it.
I think it's utter bullshit, because anyone can take their book and republish it giving the characters different names.
I bet E. L. James is doing the happy dance right now.
The Twilight series is a vampire. It won't die unless you burn it with fire.
Seriously??Seriously.
3ish stars... Everyone has that one book or one series that really turned them into a reader. I’ve been a reader for as long as I can remember, but I was one of those readers that read maybe 2-3 books a month. Then the month after I graduated nursing school in 2008, I picked up this book called Twilight. I was OBSESSED. I bought all 4 of those books and read them in less than 4 days. I didn’t sleep, I didn’t study for my nursing boards. I was consumed. Then, a month or two later, I dragged my hu
It was Team Edward shirts, midnight releases at book stores when the DVD came out… yes- I was 22 years old when I started reading these books… I’m not even embarrassed I was so obsessed with these books (even though I probably should be)Now that you have a little Twilight history, you know that I know these aren’t the best books ever.
I will forever love Twilight, and fans of the story that want a fun way to re-read with the characters genders swapping, then I say pick this up and you will probably LOVE it.
When does it end?
EDIT:Gonna add more Jimmy.Just because.Some trees are going to be sacrificed for this shit.
I know there were/are things utterly wrong with Twilight, trust me, I know, and if I re-read the whole saga now, I may even dislike it but that won’t ever erase the fact that these books gave me a lot of happiness.And that is my reason/excuse for reading this.
I felt like I owed it to Stephenie but now I’m not so sure.See, this book (if I may call this a book) is so crappy I don’t know how I managed to actually read it.
Stephenie said Beau wasn’t flowery as Bella was but that’s not an excuse for a poor plain writing just to make it all mainly.
I love the idea of a gender-bent re-imagining of a story but this, I just don't know if I hate myself enough to read this.
I know from the reviews already posted that many people just automatically gave it a 1 star without even reading it so I hope this review and my video will help people deciding if they should read it or not.Overall, I think if you are a fan of the saga you will enjoy reading this book :)__________________________________________________10/09/15Finally have it in my possession going to start reading it, wish me luck!__________________________________________________10/06/15I know many people hate Twilight but for me it was everything.
Twilight along with the rest of the books in the saga were the reason I started reading and if it wasn't for them I probably would have never joined Booktube.
dude, that shit don't work on me no more.this is what happens when the fanfic ethos of gleeful theme-spelunking meets the cold, hard, sixth avenue reality of having to come up with the odd original idea now and again.call me crazy, but if this thing were free, queer, and set in AU england with steampunk accoutrement i would srrsly read the absolute shit out of it.
I can see that I wasn't the only one hoping that this "gender-bending twist" was a gay version of Twilight.
I put my head down, pretending to stare at my book, as soon as her eyes released me. It bothered me—the rush of emotion pulsing through me, just because she’d happened to look at me for the first time in six weeks. It wasn’t normal. It was actually pretty pathetic, and probably more than that. Unhealthy.  And yet here we are....DNF at 30% because life's too short for shitty books.I made the huge mistake of thinking this could actually be something good. I thought Stephenie Meyer wanted to fix h

I thought Stephenie Meyer wanted to fix her past mistakes with a different version of Twilight.
why having the same book?
Why would you change the names and genre but not the pathetic, lifeless and zombie-like personalities of your characters?
What did the world do to deserve this, Meyer?
This must be a joke, right?
From the synopsis of this edition:This special double-feature book includes the classic novel, Twilight, and a bold and surprising reimagining, Life and Death, by Stephenie Meyer.I'm seriously worried about the future of the human race. "The classic novel Twilight" and its "bold and surprising reimagining"... Excuse me while I weep for the future generations.
I mean, the movies were bad (which didn't keep me from going to the cinema on the day of the release) but there is so much hate for the books.
Same thing goes for the Cullens and Bella's/Beau's school friends.(view spoiler)[ The ending surprised me though.
And while Bella stays human until the very end, Beau turns into a vampire after being bitten by the tracker in the ballet studio.
But please Stephenie, give us some new original reading material!Find more of my books on Instagram
Q: What's little and brown, stinks, and might be found down a toilet?Give up?A: Life and Death: Twilight Reimagined. [Well, it's published by Little and Brown and it stinks. But you should restrain your natural impulses if you don't want to spend the rest of the evening fishing things out from the U-bend. I'm afraid 752 pages just won't flush away like you're hoping it will]
No no no no no.Okay, I admit I had my doubts at first, but then because I love Twilight so much, I decided I had no choice but to read this and ended up looking forward to this "reimagined" version.
If anything, she should have released a short story with just the alternate ending.
The characters weren't different enough to make this seem like a true "reimagining" - or worth making an entire new book about.
I know that if this had been the original story, I would not have liked the series as much.
I would have much preferred a short story about another character.
Why the hell can't Meyer write something else? Edythe? Beau? Ew.I'm totally reading the fuck out it.
WELL THAT ENDING WAS UNEXPECTED! I have so much to say about this! Here's my video review - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo0XP...
