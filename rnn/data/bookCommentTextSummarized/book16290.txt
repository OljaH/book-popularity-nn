The events in it read like Pelzer imagined the worst child abuse possible and then said, "And it all happened to me!" Yeah, right.
Pelzer also bought his own book in bulk so the sales numbers would put it on the bestseller list -- he just doesn't have a whole lot of credibility.
You see, what really pisses me off with this book is this: I have known kids that have come from horribly abusive situations that are more genuine than Pelzer is in his "memoir." The stories of his life in this book contradict one another, are extremely over-the-top and, dare I say, fabricated some.
(Again, I can concede that he was only helping his writing along by wanting his book to be seen by a greater audience.)However, and here is the kicker for me, if this story is true, then shouldn't just writing it and getting the story told redemption enough for Pelzer?
you do, however, come away with having read some very disturbing and disgusting passages that describe in detail a case of horrendous child abuse.
and if its intention is to provide hope to victim's of abuse, i don't know what the take-away is other than 'if i lived through this, you can live through just about anything'.
i really don't know what to make of this book, as a piece of literary work.
there seems to be very little grey area in pelzer's book.
the grey area is exactly what needs to be illuminated in a book about abuse.
I experienced this book in a fairly odd way, during a week-long cheerleading camp my sophomore year of high school.
I remember with almost painful clarity the way in which we sat at her feet listening to this story of a boy who endured a long childhood of astonishing, sadistic abuse at the hands of his mother.
After every single part of the reading, I was convinced it couldn't get worse, that she couldn't possibly do anything worse to that little boy.
Not light reading, and not a feel-good "I survived the odds" story.

A Child Called "It" HCI, 1995 $9.95By Dave Pelzer ISBN 1558743669	One very common issue that goes around in our world is child abuse, it happens everywhere and it is something that is horrible and cannot be stopped.
This made me say to myself, “wow, life can be so messed up, but you can survive even the most horrible things, as long as you follow your dream, and keep it with you as close as possible.” I believe this is the message, Dave Pelzer is trying to reach out, not only to the people who get abused consistently, but also to those who suffer a great deal of pain from something terrible everyday.
I did not like this book.
The mother was obviously sick and needed help.
Nowhere in the book was it stated that he seemed afraid of his wife, so why did he allow her to treat their son so horribly?
If his mother had had some kind of reason, just something that set him apart, it would at least be part of an explanation even if it's no excuse, but it seemed totally random.
Most of you would never treat a child like that anyway, and if you would, no amount of reading about it would change your opinion that you're in the 'right'.
I could really understand how he felt but one thing about this book I don't get at all is how his own mother transformed from a loving mother to a nightmarish, abusive mother so quickly.
I mean, the author was only, like a little boy when his mother started abusing him.This book is extremely emotional and can make you feel so bad for the author and even cry so.
This also showed how bad things happen to good people - the author's own father didn't even help out at all - he was once a fun, loving fireman, turned into an alcoholic, carless father.
I've sat with this book on my desk for a couple weeks, unable to decide what I would write for a review.
There is absolutely no process of recovery or explanation or psychological background, and the book leaves huge questions open, saying "Please understand that many of your questions will be answered in the next two books in the trilogy series." That made me want to throw it across the room.
All that being said, I am going to try to take this book for what it is: an excellent awareness-raiser about child abuse; a survival story that may help many think "if he can get through that, I can get through anything"; and a simple, quick, can't-look-away-from-the-train-wreck read that kids and teens have given a cult following.
Why the hell did I pick this book up?
And I think abuse is too mild a term for what he went through.
I came away from this book depressed.
And I had several thoughts that kept running through my head.
What was the point of this book?
The only thing I could think of was to expose to the world that such treatment did happen to someone at some point in the recent past.
It had the potential to be educational or thoughtful and instead it was just a car crash from cover to cover.
In The Child Called "It", a true story that can bring tears to the eyes of anyone with a beating heart, Dave, the protagonist, is abused in the most horrifying ways possible.
What kind of mother would want to hurt their own little child?
The book tells of a little child, Dave, the protagonist, who goes through many troubles throughout the book.
He lives with his crazy, obnoxious, abusive mother who would go out of her way to torture David.
After reading this book, you'll then understand the what really goes on in the world.
But I'm going to say what I can...This book was a hard one to read yet I couldn't put it down.
But that's something people involved in child abuse cases ask themselves every day.You really do feel for Dave.
All of which he accomplished magnificently.What we learn in Dave's story is that child abuse is real.
Another thing we learn is to not back down in that fight, of course there will be road blocks, but if you champion for a child as those special people in Dave's life did, you can help.
A Child Called "It" (Dave Pelzer #1) , Dave PelzerDavid James "Dave" Pelzer (born December 29, 1960 in San Francisco, California) is an American author, of several autobiographical and self-help books.

I feel I have a duty to face other true stories of horrific child abuse, if only to put on the armor of bravery and show children that they don't need to run from the horror of their abuser's glee; that life can be good and it can feel somewhat safe.
We just need to love ourselves and each other enough to let the light shine in.
This is a man's account of the severe abuse he suffered as a young child through the hands of his mother.
Apparently, there is some doubt on whether the story is actually true, or whether the author merely made the whole thing up.
A book that describes overcoming any kind of extreme hardship, ending with a message about hope and the ability of the human spirit to triumph, can be both moving and inspiring.
However, a book that merely describes abuse in vivid detail one scene after another and does little else?
I'm a little annoyed...Tonight I read a book entitled "A Chiled Called 'It'" and I believe it's fiction, to say the least."A Child Called 'It'" is a story about a boy who survives horrendous over-the-top abuse at the hands of his mother.
It basically reads as a long list of horrors that the author describes in grisly detail and sometimes depicts with startling clarity...My problems with the book are many, For the sake of brevity however, I'll just list a few:--He couldn't remember the color of his mothers eyes or hair, yet he remembered even the dates of certain abuses, the number of hits, the words said, and every fleeting thought.
And these pages are small, with large type!P.S. Now that I am finished reading it and have read some other reviews of the book on Goodreads, plus a NY Times article linked from another Goodreads review, I am inclined to believe the author is a liar.
Plus, how are you going to believe someone can recall graphic scenes from their childhood, but not what their mother looked like?
Would have been nice if the Times reporter had interviewed the teachers who reported his abuse (if, in fact those people and reports weren't fabricated) or if the reporter had looked for the police report taken when Pelzer was removed from his home.
This book is a true story about a child’s devastating childhood in which he experienced child abuse physically and verbally.
David’s childhood was filled with multiple events involving abuse.
David Pelzer blew me away with A Child Called It. His life story brought so much sympathy to heart and tears to my eyes.
I definitely couldn’t stop reading without wanting to know what was next in this amazing book.
I recommend this book to anyone who wants to know a real life experience of someone who dealt with child abuse in full detail.

I wanted so badly to pluck David out of the story and hide him away from this vicious woman who to me was never truly a mother, but a monster who took her anger out on a weak small child.Being able to push out a baby does not make you a mother.
It's loving and nurturing that baby, protecting that child to the bitter end.I am not a violent person, but by God I wish I could have just five minutes alone with this woman...five minutes.Abuse is never okay for anyone.
I don't understand it and I'll never accept any reason for why someone would hurt a child.
His brothers treat him like a door mat and I dont know how he takes it without doing something.
It is a great book none the less no matter how sad it is and I highly recommend it.
I will probably read this book again in the future over and over again.
If you want to know more than read the book.
This a great book I will say again and it is a really quick read if you are looking for one.
Once again I highly recommend this book and its sequel which I have read.
I love a book that stands for something. I admire people who have to suffer through such unspeakable acts, but to come out on the other side and take action to help raise awareness is very noble indeed. This book had me cringing in disgust. Is it well written? No. Does it need to be? No. Unbelievable that this sort of thing goes on in our / every society. This book has made me think and feel. I'd highly recommend it, just not for the squemish!!
This book was very interesting. It showed me what really goes on in some families in this world. It also showed me to never take anything that i have for granted because some kids have that kind of life at home.
كتابي السادس لعام 2018.الكتاب هو الجزء الأول من سيرة ذاتية للكاتب دايف بيلزر يتكلم فيها عن الظلم الذي كانت تلحقه به أمه، من ضرب واهانات ومعاملة ك "عبد" وكل ذلك لسبب لا يعلمه.كل ما سأقوله: لعنة الله على الظالمين💔
Pelzer weaves a horrifying tale of abuse, neglect, and torture he undergoes as a child at the hands of his psychotic mother.
Dave Pelzer’s entire tale comes together from the real-life experiences of the author.
The bravery shown by one little boy left me speechless.The book begins when Dave is a tiny child.
Dave loves his mother deeply and admires his firefighter father.The story turns dark quickly.
The mother always gets her way because Dave’s father always ends up backing down.The entire book is filled with tragedy and stomach turning horror at the depravity a little boy goes through but there is also something very prominent that begins to show itself.
He is telling about his life when he was young.
He had three brothers and mom and a dad.
His dad was a local firefighter and his mom was a stay at mom kind of person.
They had a really good life they went on vacations and had picnics.He looked up to his dad and loved his mom very much.
He use to been able to play with his brothers but his dad stared to not come home because of his job he had to stay there 24/7.

He had three brothers and mom and a dad.
They had a really good life they went on vacations and had picnics.He looked up to his dad and loved his mom very much.
He use to been able to play with his brothers but his dad stared to not come home because of his job he had to stay there 24/7.
So his mom started to take out her frustrations on David and not his brothers.
One time he planned out how long it took to go to school, then he stool food from the local gas station.
I can't believe that anyone would do such things to their own flesh and blood.If i was David, i would have tried to run away or tell somebody at my school of the things that were happening at home.The person that i actually hated more that the mother in the book was David's father.How can you sit around watching a sick person torture your son and not do anything?
Even if he was scared of the mother, he could have anonymously called the police and report that a boy was being abused.I'm glad that he finally got away from his mother.
I first found out about this book when I saw my mother reading it. She was making weird faces and sometimes crying. But when she finished is when I realized why she made those faces and why she cried."A Child Called 'It'" really is my favourite book. It's a book about a child's worst nightmare. What he goes through is something no child should go through.....

Everything revolves around his mother and punishments; the book touches on nothing else.
Normally I don't really care about that, but the lack of writing skills has, honestly, made this book quite bland.A little synopsis of the book: Dave Pelzer was born the third of five children.
These punishments Dave had gotten since four years old or so are so radical and crude that I am skeptical of what have really happened.
The book has never explained why the mother suddenly turned crazy and why Dave was the hapless scapegoat.
The unusualness of Dave's punishments.
The response from Dave's family after the book was published.
Some parts of it were very disturbing, which when coupled with vivid details of the abuse that the author had to endure, making it one of the most depressing books I ever read.A Child Called “It” portrayed the childhood life of Dave Pelzer, where he was severely abused by his own mother.
What kind of mother that has a heart to beat her son till he passed out?
What kind of mother that so sick till she can feed her son with poisonous stuffs?
