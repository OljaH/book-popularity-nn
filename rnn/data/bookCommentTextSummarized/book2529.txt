What's not to like about coats of arms and shields and crests? Well-told and properly explained. Loved this.

I'm actually in the Project Gutenberg edition at http://www.gutenberg.org/files/48573/... and hoping that this and that are the same, but it's a lovely pick up and browse sort of a book. I'd expected more about the art and less about the weaponry, but I'm pleasantly surprised indeed. Very much a browsing book rather than a cover-to-cover one for anyone outside of specialty research, but I'll definitely be going back over this a few more times.
If someone is interested in heraldry, this is a good book for teaching the basics of blazon - the rules that are followed in designing and "reading" a coat of arms. But that is all it is. It's a primer, not an advanced text. Nor is it a reference work for determining if a design is in conflict with extant arms. Regard it in that light, and it deserves a place on your reference shelf.
Love this book. Classical heraldry book from the Victorian perspective, very clear and easy to understand.
honorable subject
