Yet another short story favourite :)
Poirot ontvangt een brief van een oudere dame die hem wil raadplegen. Voordat er echter een afspraak bevestigd kan worden, sterft de vrouw onverwacht. Poirot onderzoekt de zaak. Alle sporen leiden naar het Russische kamermeisje, maar het zou natuurlijk Poirot niet zijn als hij geen andere details zou opmerken.Kort verhaal, eigenlijk veel te kort om op details in te gaan of voor een meer uitgebreide voorstelling van de personages.
Poirot receives a letter indicating a potential client wishes to have him investigate something discreetly.
It is not specified in the letter, but Poirot accepts and sends a note.
A few days later, Miss Lemon indicates that the woman is dead, suddenly.
Poirot has her send another note.
This time, a response is sent indicating that his services are no longer required.Poirot goes to visit the house and finds a Russian maid and a married couple that is related to the deceased.
The verdict is that the woman was poisoned by strychnine.
(view spoiler)[The female relative.

Hercule Poirot solves it yet againWith his smooth moves Hercule Poirot has solved another mystery with his finesse and ease that makes him my all time favorite sleuth!
I know it is a short story from the moment I bought it. I expected high but it turned out I am pretty disappointed reading it. Well, it's a murder and Poirot case, but somehow in my opinion there is something lack of from the story plot and the characters themself, which I am not sure I can't tell what it is.
Short and pithyIt seemed this one was over as soon as I began. Good little plot by motherless well developed as I had hoped.
Hadn't read before. I loved it.Kept me entertained. I did not guess the culprit until I was close to the end of the story. I loved it.
