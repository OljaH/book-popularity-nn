A typical Wilbur Smith book. Although this time he focuses on the working of a gold mine in South Africa. Good for reading as a break. An easy, fast read. I enjoyed this one, never got bored. Nice to read about how Gold Mines work, and the people's involvement in it.
David Rintoul reads Wilbur Smith's novel Gold Mine with a huge amount of passion & excitement right from the start.I love the 1974 film version starring Roger Moore as Rod Slater (Rod Ironsides in the novel) which follows most of the novel quite faithfully, even lifting dialogue straight from it. It's a fairly straightforward action adventure, but Smith keeps the story moving along at a fast pace & manages to create some good characters along the way.
I personally found the book much more exciting then the movie because it was more detailed and had more action in it.
The book had quite a few differences for example Manfred's character isn't as great as he is in the novel.
The book and the movie are very old, but are both great entertainment.
The most interesting quote of the book for me was ''stay alive!!
believe!'' because its a subliminal message saying ''never give up'' and ''have faith.'' Wilbur smith deliberately makes this quote to provide tension and excitement to the scene in the book.
There's liberal exposition in the story but the thing I find about this author is that he makes such exposition interesting and entertaining in itself rather than a chore to sit through.Once the characters had revealed themselves into various roles - hero, villain, love interest etc.
The scenes set inside the mine are brief but effective and brutally realistic, as always.One thing I found particularly good was the climax, full of breathless excitement and a ruthless, absolutely horrible villain.
I also adored the character of Big King, another hulking African character, realistically flawed but never less than gripping when on the page.A short read but a splendid one.
Wibur Smith is an entertaining author. I learn a bit about the area he writes about or I learn some history about the area or the people. He develops characters I develop intense feelings for - rooting for abused women, despising arrogant people who mistreat others or who flaunt safety rules or laws. Anything he writes I will read. He has never disappointed and Gold Mine is n exception.
A Wilbur Smith thriller. Straightforward narrative, suspense and hard men. If you know what you're going to get going in, it's entertaining. Mind the age of this thing, though and the occurrences of prejudice and bigotry. Was made into (changed into) a Roger Moore-movie that I seem to have forgotten most about, but I'm pretty sure wasn't a faithful adaption.
A typical Wilbur Smith thriller but a little too gory for my liking although it certainly kept me entertained on a long drive down to Somerset.Plenty of action throughout and well read by David Rintoul.
A typical Wilbur Smith thriller which one can read on a relaxing holiday. The world building here is not as good as his other works as the book is somewhat short. But the unique plot of mining in the depths keep you at the edge of your seat right till the end.
Formulaic and predictable they may be, but unlike many other books of which the same could be said, Wilbur Smith’s stories are nearly always well written, his characters are nicely (if stereotypically) depicted, and historical/specific settings are carefully researched and entirely credible.
If you want to immerse yourself in a different world and your swash is in need of a little buckling, he’s hard to beat.Having said all of that, it does get a bit boring after you’ve read quite a few of Smith’s books, as I have.
I’m not sure if I’ve ever read a Wilbur Smith book before.
Probably the main reason I ended up with this book in my possession is that this edition (retitled “Gold”) was a film tie-in cover featuring Bond-era Roger Moore.
Rodney Ironsides is less pompous and snobby than 007, more of a blue-collar, rough-hands, testosterone-leaking version, a REAL MAN – and reading the book I found it difficult to imagine refined, almost-effeminate Roger Moore as the character (I’m guessing he took it to “toughen up” his image).
The book is fine, it moves at a cracking pace, with interesting settings and predictable yet satisfying resolutions for all the main characters.

Wilbur Smith is a man who has done justice to his African roots by bringing out the beauty of the continent time and again in his books. This book talks about the working of gold mines and the members of the Bantu and Shangaan tribes employed in the gold mines of Africa. Relatively short, this story has a strong plot evolving around the gold mine and the fortune it stands to create for people, either in its running or closed state.
A romping easy read. The characters are stereotyped, the plot is pre-determined and ends the way it should in this type of a book. The bad men are defeated and the good guy always gets the girl. Still it is worth while.
Exciting story!Wealth of insight into world of gold mining. Characters are real. Africa is portrayed as beautiful as ever. Rhere is even mention of Sean Courtney.
Very quick easy read but most of the action happens at the end of the book. Enjoyed the plot but was lacking something for me.
A little underdeveloped compared to his other novels. But for a short book it was entertaining.
De bouquet (of schrijf je dit anders?) reeks voor mannen. Meer is het niet.
My first Wilbur Smith and quite enjoyed it. Very to the point story about a gold mine. Probably a bit too simply written for me and not enough detail but good quick read
The book was ok, dated, slow, but ended well.
A good read. Kept me engrossed and wanting to turn the pages.
This wasn't my cup of tea but the storie concept was brilliant and the writing was good. I just didn't like this book. I would like to read some of his other books.
Reminds me of the Clive Cussler Dirk Pitt books except in a South African gold mine instead of underwater.
And Rod is definitely a man's man (or is that woman's man?) The usual hero stuff with the macho guy who is falling off a cliff, or diving underwater, or falling out of a plane, or hanging on to the top of the train, or, in this instance, heading down into a flooding gold mine.
Of course he gets the girl----no spoiler here.
But Wilbur keeps one reading right along, unless perhaps the reader is clueless as to what he is getting into with a Smith book.
Dare I say that this may be more of a man's book!Rodney Ironsides is the main character and his rise through the ranks of the Sonder Ditch gold mine is aided by his boss, Manfred Steyner, in return for blind obedience.
Manfred is, in turn being manipulated from higher up in a scam that could net a huge profit on the stock market.
I'm glad I listened to it, but I doubt I'll become a great Wilbur Smith fan as a result.
Probably better to listen to the unabridged version or read the book.
Fanfiction #2 Sudafrica, Sonder Ditch: una miniera d'oro di straordinaria ricchezza, crogiuolo di speranze, ambizioni, sofferenze e passioni.
Manfred Steyner, che la possiede, la sfrutta selvaggiamente per le sue deliranti ambizioni di potere; i possenti e orgogliosi minatori bantu, che vi si calano silenziosi ogni giorno, ne attendono una promessa di riscatto; e Rod Ironsides, che ne conosce e rispetta ogni cunicolo e ogni segreto, la vuole trasformare in un inaudito sogno di libert�...
Se scrive che una miniera d'oro � fatta cos� e cos� potete crederci.
Lamentablemente esta es una de sus novelas menos logradas; no digo que sea mala, al contrario tiene una trama bastante interesante pero que comienza a desarrollarse bastante tarde, y con la contra de que es el libro más corto que ha escrito en su carrera hasta ahora (ronda las 230 páginas).
El iniciado en este autor tal vez al leer "Operación Oro" no quiera leer más del autor, pero esta totalmente equivocado.
Hay muchos libros perfectos de este autor.Sin ser nada del otro mucho, me hubiera gustado y había esperado mucho más de este gran autor que tanto estimo; pero esto demuestra que hasta los más grandes cometen errores y se duermen en sus laureles de gloria.
Outstanding at his job but without the academic qualifications that would allow him to rise to the position of General Manager at Sonder Ditch gold mine, Rod Ironsides does get the promotion following the death, in a mining accident, of the man who held that role, but only at the insistence of Dr Manfred Steyner, who is related to the owner through marriage.
Soon it becomes apparent what Steyner has in mind, and the foolhardy task Ironsides is given puts many lives at risk and could destroy not only Sonder Ditch but also the neighbouring mines.
Typical Wilbur Smith - an enjoyable pot-boiler! It's not great literature and in places the prose is excruciatingly bad, but he does write a good story. Rodney Ironsides is promoted to General manager of the Sonder Ditch gold mine and unwittingly becomes involved in the machinations of one of its board members who is trying to inflate the price of the company's shares by flooding the mine. A ripping yarn but in places reads like a mediocre GCSE essay.
A pretty good thriller in the course of which the reader learns lots about how the gold mining business works in South Africa. The characters were well drawn and their motivations make sense. Some interesting twists and turns along the way to the outcome. Overall pretty good if undemanding adventure story.
I wandered across the movie based on this book from 1974 with Roger Moore on Amazon a couple of years ago. I loved the movie and decided to check out the book afterwards and just loved it as well. Set in a gold mining community in 1970s South Africa, this novel is gritty, complex, and and seriously engrossing. You don't hear this very much, but you have to read this book AND see the movie.
