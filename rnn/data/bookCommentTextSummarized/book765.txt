Thanks to Volume 2 I quickly fell in love with folk tales and fairy tales at an early age, especially the ones with more sinister plots.Volume 1 and Volume 2 of Collier's Junior Classics were read to my sister and me every night for several months.
Then I started reading it by myself, over and over and over.
I'm holding onto this 10-volume set - the same set I've had all my life - so I can hand it down to my daughter to read to her kids someday.
kumpulan dongeng dari penjuru dunia. waktu baca ini buku, ah hati saya membuncah bahagia serasa kembali ke masa kecil dulu. banyak cerita bagus dan juga disertai pesan moral, seperti di The Fox and The Grapes yang ditulis di situ pesan moralnya: It is easy to despise what you cannot get. trus baru tau juga kalo rapunzel itu dongeng dari jerman dan the sleeping beauty itu dari prancis. saya juga kadang membaca dengan suara keras dan tiap karakter beda juga suaranya, semacam mendongen untuk diri sendiri :D
one of my absolute favorite books from when I was a young child!!!!!
This book The Young Folks Shelf of Books had a lot of good stories but after a while it just got boring to me. If you like books that just have a bunch of short stories then I would recommend this book for you, but if you are into fast paced books I wouldn't' recommend this book to you.

A clever, tongue-in-cheek fantasy that reminds me of James Thurber. Considering the sometimes silly wordplay, I didn't quite expect it to get as dark as it did, and there are many questions it never answers about itself. But it was fun when it needed to be, moving when it needed to be, and sometimes downright hilarious.
