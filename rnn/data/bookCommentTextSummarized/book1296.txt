For those of you, including me, who have never heard of this word, it means:“Epiphenomenalism is a position in the philosophy of mind according to which mental states or events are caused by physical states or events in the brain but do not themselves cause anything.”And I am none the wiser for reading that I must confess.Probably the most well-known sentences of Santayana’s is also one of the least accurately quoted: “Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it” (The Life of Reason: Reason in Common Sense.
Like a sage having a mystical vision, the experience absorbs him entirely—so entirely that the idea of him somehow being a distinct entity, or somehow possessing a quality called ‘existence’, couldn’t even be thought.There’s no logical or philosophical way to return from this kind of skepticism.
But Santayana thinks that essences exist independently of both mind and matter; they are eternal and infinite.
But how could a quality exist independently of a perceiving mind to take note of it?This quote made it more clear to me: "Substance is the speaker and substance is the theme; intuition is only the act of speaking or hearing, and the given essence is the audible word.” Let us recall Santayana’s view of the mind.
This is an excellent introduction to George Santayana's philosophy. His epiphenomenalistic approach to the world reinforces his non-reductive naturalism as well as sets the stage for the further development of his system of philosophy 'The Realms of Being.'
This book is extremly hard to read. Most of the concepts I already beleive so it was easy enough to follow along, but the author gets really far out their with some of his ideals.
