You wouldn't think so based on the title and the subject, but 15-year-old Jeff will have you laughing out loud throughout his story.
I did, however, appreciate the author's choice to make Jeff's secret both more complex and less of an extreme situation (view spoiler)[i.e., it was not abuse in his case that led to his suicide attempt (hide spoiler)], as I think it's important that we see more stories from this standpoint.
We don't get to read stories like this nearly often enough, but they are such an important part of the human experience and I hope we'll see more of them.
This book is an stealthy, cat-like emotional NINJA...The story started off all whistling and nonchalant like it was going to be a light dose of fluffy teenage angst.
I will just say that this is a book I would recommend both teenagers (despite some very frank language and sexuality) and their parents as I think Ford does an excellent job of realistically portraying teens struggling through life-changing moments.Whether or not you personally relate to Jeff, I think this is a pretty universal story about what it means to be a teen and try to find your place in the cold, chaotic cacophony of the world.
Posted at Shelf InflictedSuicide Notes has 45 chapters, each one representing a day in the life of 15-year-old Jeff, who is in the psychiatric ward of a hospital after his suicide attempt on New Year‚Äôs Eve. Trust me; this story is not nearly as depressing as it sounds.
During his 45-day ‚Äúsentence‚Äù, Jeff learns more about himself as he endures individual and group therapy, makes friends, experiences grief and loss, and comes to terms with his sexuality.The story takes a more serious turn when Jeff gradually opens up to Cat Poop, and details of his family life, his friendships, the events that led to his suicide attempt, and the reason for it begin to unfold.
The way the book was going I thought I would be okay and not cry.
I WAS WRONG!The main character is Jeff, he wakes up in the psych ward and finds out he's going to be there for a bit of time.
I had a love/like relationship with Jeff, at times he would say things that got on my nerves but don't we wall do that?
He won't talk about it in group or with the doctor.
Am I lucky that, compared to the other kids here, my life doesn't seem so bad?
I thought this was a really good book.
4 Stars!!  "That sounds so weird: kill yourself. It makes it sound like you tried to murder someone, only that someone is you. But killing someone is wrong and I don't think suicide is. It's my life, right?"  ‚ÄúSuicide Notes‚Äù it was like nothing I‚Äôve expected. Despite the title and despite the blurb this was a quite entertaining read. It‚Äôs a YA novel/coming of age/realistic fiction that was interesting and refreshing and hold my interest not only with its plot, but with its main character as well
The story is about Jeff a 15 years old boy, who after he tried to slit his wrists on New Year‚Äôs Eve he‚Äôs committed by his parents in a hospital.
I really had to know more about Jeff and why did he want to commit suicide.In the first half we met the other patients in the psychiatric ward.
In the second half we get to know Jeff better, his relationship with his sister (I loved them together and their banter) and his parents, his relationship with his best friend Allie and why he wanted to commit suicide.
I really liked the write style feel like you're reading book of 2018 not 2008 funny book i really enjoyed üíúüíú‚ú®‚Äô
It feels a little weird to say that I felt a book about a 45-day program in a juvenile psychiatric unit was really funny.
This book, written in journal entries from day one of the program until the last day, focuses on Jeff‚Äôs evaluation of why he tried to kill himself.
(hide spoiler)]While this book definitely deals with a lot of morbid topics, the feel is decidedly optimistic for the most part.
His doctor/patient relationship with Dr. Katzrupus was a highlight as well.I‚Äôd definitely recommend this book to anyone looking for a male voice in the female-saturated YA world.
What struck me most about this book - and unsettled me, to be honest - is the brutality of it, sugarcoated by Jeff's self-deprecating irony, witticism and sarcastic outlook on adolescence.
The themes approached in this book are not light, despite seemingly narrated in a light-hearted way: teen suicide, familial dysfunctions, personal identity.
So we, the readers, are completely left in the dark about pretty much everything that took place before him being hospitalized.But slowly, as Jeff gradually comes around and faces the bitter consequences of what he's done, we discover bits and pieces of the puzzle that eventually will give him, and consequently us, realization of his real problem.
‚ÄúIf you ever manage to become perfect, you have to die instantly before you ruin things for everyone else.‚Äù   It was my third book of Michael Thomas Ford and he didn't disappoint me. The first one, The Road Home, a contemporary romance about coming home with a nice unexpected twist of mystery in it, has sparked my interest for his works. The second one, Full Circle, an amazing epic story of love, friendship and male bonding, touched me greatly and made me feel and think about even days after I
Michael Thomas Ford wrote it with a such skilful feeling of lightness and freshness as if he has never written nothing else in his life than YA books.
Michael Thomas Ford is one of them.Fifteen-year-old Jeff wakes up on New Year's Day to find himself in the hospital.
45 days of the Jeff's life(I have to say here-his POV is hilarious, sarcastic, thoughtful and simply brilliant!), 45 chapters of pure reading enjoyment(believe me, this book is better than 10 blockbusters together!), 295 pages that won't leave your indifferent(if you have your heart on the right side, of course.)I laughed LAUD, I cry quietly, I finished it with a broad smile on my face.
I laughed out loud various times in the book due to really hilarious scenes and also because Jeff mentions a wide variety of objects and ideas that really come out of nowhere.
What makes this even better is that Ford kept me laughing even though the entire plot itself was supposed to be depressing.
The plot speed was just right - it moves fast, but nothing is rushed.One more thing great about this book is that Jeff was an awesome character, inside and out.
Although you might figure out the big "secret" ahead of time, the other plot devices kept me occupied and yearning for more.
Rating: 2.5* of fiveAll the points are for the ending, which is entirely worth the long, tedious, acne-inducing slog to get there.Seriously...does the world NEED to hear about adolescence anymore? Is there something we missed, as adults, while going through that training ground for evil demons called "junior high" (that's middle school for the under-fifty set)? If so, is it something that we actually *need*?Basically...no more. No no no. Poke me with a fork, I'm done. This work is licensed under

4.5 stars "That sounds so weird: kill yourself. It makes it sound like you tried to murder someone, only that someone is you. But killing someone is wrong and I don't think suicide is. It's my life, right?" There was a period in my life when all I read were issue-driven contemporaries. Eating disorders, suicides, rape... the works. But then all that excess of Jodi Picoult and Laurie Halse Anderson made me seriously depressed and I moved on to the bestselling Paranormal Romances at the time. Boy,
Boy, was that a whole different bucket of depression.Let's hear it for bad life choices.Suicide Notes is unlike any YA issue-driven contemporary I have ever read.
I laughed more while reading this book than Tina Fey's autobiography, which, by the way, isn't all that funny.
I think that‚Äôs what happens when you look too deep inside for the truth.

Moving through these 45 chapters he gets to know the other kids in the ward (Alice, Bone, Juliet, Rankin, Sadie, Martha, Squirrels), talks to his therapist, Dr. Katzrupus(‚ÄúCat Poopus?
Jeff is forced to acknowledge what is its role after Rankin‚Äôs confusing behavior, and face up to everything that led up to his suicide attempt.The heart and¬†realism of the book creates a space for recognizable characters.'I wonder how many of us there are all over the world, how many kids in how many hospitals.
In some ways I feel like the major themes in this book need to be spoiled, because it will attract more readers.
When Jeff finally lets himself remember the circumstances leading up to his suicide, I was so consumed by his feelings that I found myself cringing with shame and embarrassment.
And I like how he presents another side of this coin in Rankin, who so completely hates and rejects himself that he‚Äôs incapable of seeing anything clearly.
(view spoiler)[And I felt so much pain for Jeff.
He doesn‚Äôt want to and he‚Äôs determined not to cooperate, but his stay isn‚Äôt optional and his parents refuse to take him home.
Avoidance is his way to handle everything, but every now and again, a real feeling shines trough, be it anger at his parents for daring to save his life, resentment towards his doctors and nurses and the complete and utter hopelessness he feels about his situation.I want to make this very clear: Suicide Notes is a book that deals with serious issues, but it‚Äôs rarely a sad read and it‚Äôs never angsty.
There were a few things that Jeff said that made me laugh but I didn't actually like him until like 2/3's of the way in.
I mean he doesn't tell us the whole story straight away and I don't understand why not.(view spoiler)[ Sure, he comes to terms with his sexuality and understanding that it is a part of him but why didn't he tell us the real reason why he tried to kill himself?
Of course, I didn't actually buy that but  (hide spoiler)] I just don't like narrators who only tell us half the story and kind of leave it until the book is nearly over for some shock factor.
I‚Äôm going to have to apologise in advance for the vagueness of this section but I don‚Äôt want to go into too much detail because I think this book is best read knowing nothing.
I know not all kids out there going through these issues will get the happy ending that Jeff does, but it‚Äôs comforting to know that there is somewhere for them to turn even when there isn‚Äôt.I feel like I‚Äôm doing this book a huge disservice by dwelling on this side of things because, yes it‚Äôs dark‚Ä¶ but it‚Äôs also one of the most hilarious and heart-warming books I‚Äôve read in a while.
All of these authors write fairly realistic portrayals of gay teens without drawing on the old 'being gay makes you want to kill yourself' stereotype.Add to this fundamental problem of an outdated storyline some fairly mundane, if not downright weak, writing, a main character who is not particularly interesting (generic teenage standoffish behavior seems to be his only real personality trait), and a 'mystery' that was obvious within the first couple of chapters, and you come up with a book that is pretty lackluster.And then it gets downright offensive.
While I did enjoy this, it didn't quite tickle my funny bone or have the emotional impact it seems to have had for a lot of other reviewers. It is, however, an important topic that needs to be talked about more without all the taboos that surround it.
Throughout the novel, Jeff repetitively finds himself in sexually compromising situations with two other patients, a pixie-ish girl named Sadie and a football player named Rankin.
He says that since he was unable to have sex with Sadie, it showed that girls were not for him, and that his sexual encounters with Rankin felt "right", despite the sickly feelings that accompanied them.
Sadie seemed like she would have remained a part of his life once they had left the ward, and he barely thinks of her once she is gone, a highly unrealistic reaction.Overall, I would not recommend this book unless a reader was extremely desperate for books about mental illness and/or LGBT youth.
What might look like the perfect life‚Äîor even an okay life‚Äîto you might not be so okay for the person living it.‚Äù   This book is so important & powerful.
It's an hilarious read that had me in fits of laughter in several places -- the humour and sarcasm in this book were top notch!I just love what messages this book conveys and I think everyone will appreciate the importance of honesty with yourself & others around you that this book highlights.One of my favourite books of the year!
He says some very witty things, and for a book about suicide, there were some pretty funny moments that made me LOL.
He also says some very introspective things too.I like that (view spoiler)[ the author made Jeff an LGBT character without making his sexuality all that there is to him.
Jeff is a very complex character, and since you don't find out he's gay until the end, you get to see Jeff as a person and not just as a gay guy  (hide spoiler)]Ugh, I can't even find the words to describe the brilliance of this book.
RIGHT NOW.I've read some pretty amazing books these last few weeks, and Suicide Notes is one of them.
This was to be a brief, light read between heavier books.
Brief, yes.
Light, not so much.
It was definitely humorous, a 15 year old wakes up in a mental ward after trying to kill himself.
Ok, I know that doesn't sound funny, but it's in the delivery.
I knew that part going into it, but around the halfway mark more issues are revealed, to us and the narrator himself.
The journey is short, only 45 days in the ward, but there's certainly a lot going on, involving therapy, parental visits, and other kids in the ward.
Another YA book with adult situations.
This had zero emotional impact on me. It wasn't even bad or boring, but it just didn't affect me at all.
What kind of name is that?‚Äù‚ÄúI don‚Äôt belong here,‚Äù I informed Cat Poop, thinking maybe this just hadn‚Äôt occurred to him.
‚ÄúBut usually the patients just sit in a circle and look at each other until someone decides to talk.‚Äù‚ÄúAs I told you earlier,‚Äù Cat Poop continued, ‚Äúyou‚Äôll participate in group sessions, as well as individual sessions with me.‚Äù ‚ÄúAre those supervised too?‚Äù I asked him.
Then he said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll see you later this afternoon.‚ÄùI kept answering no to everything, because I really haven‚Äôt ever done drugs, and she kept looking at me like maybe I was lying just to get her out of there.
Oh book, what do I do with you?You started off great, got me laughing so hard at times, preventing from going to bed for just a bit longer, bit longer I promise!, and then you turned into just another ya novel.I absolutely loved the narrator's voice and his on point sense of humor, but I didn't care about him.And the other characters... I'm pretty sure that by tomorrow I won't even remember their names.
4.5 starsFull review can be found at Greedy Bug Book Reviews.
Suicide Notes is told in first person from Jeff's point of view.
Jeff has been placed in a psychiatric facility for forty-five days after a suicide attempt.
Each day at the facility is chronicled in Jeff's own words.
While the subject of the book is quite serious (and should be taken as such) there are a few humorous parts as well.
Jeff is a typical fifteen-year-old boy and his words and actions prove this.
some funny, some heartbreaking, but all entertaining.
Otherwise, a very entertaining read.
