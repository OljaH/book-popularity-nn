"The drowned and the saved" is a thoughtful, lucid reflection on the Holocaust phenomenon. Primo Levi tries to find answers for different aspects of the concentration camps. He explains the behavior of the inhabitants and of those who guard them. This book tries to explore the psychology of this tragedy, and to offer insight in the human condition. It is very different from his memoir Survival in Auschwitz (and his second book The Reawakening) which gave a more thorough, detailed account of his
It is very different from his memoir Survival in Auschwitz (and his second book The Reawakening) which gave a more thorough, detailed account of his life and experiences in the Lager.
Although Survival in Auschwitz was written several decades before this book, It should be read first, as Levi refers to it often.
This can also be applied to the victims of the Holocaust, especially to Primo Levi.
In each of his essays in this book, Levi offers an intellectually stimulating viewpoint of the human condition.
Primo Levi argues that the survivors, who were the opportunists, are not the true witnesses.
These are simplifying, comforting untruths.In the first essay, “The Memory of the Offense”, he notes the optimistic self-generated rumours of the prisoners in the camps - the war will be over in two weeks, there will be no more selections, Polish partisans will liberate the camp soon – and sets them beside the similarly comforting lies of the surviving perpetrators – only following orders, we knew nothing about this, I was not a Nazi.For Levi, the simple statement is usually self-deluding.

This can also be applied to the victims of the Holocaust, especially to Primo Levi.
In each of his essays in this book, Levi offers an intellectually stimulating viewpoint of the human condition.
Primo Levi argues that the survivors, who were the opportunists, are not the true witnesses.
"Veramente si è indotti a pensare che, nel Terzo Reich, la scelta migliore, la scelta imposta dall'alto, fosse quella che comportava la massima afflizione, il massimo spreco di di sofferenza fisica e morale. Il nemico non doveva soltanto morire, ma morire nel tormento".E' un dovere leggere e rileggere le parole lucide e pacate di Primo Levi, e prestare la massima attenzione al suo ammonimento: " è avvenuto, quindi può accadere di nuovo".
Levi's last book is about several things: - the necessity of witnessing to what happened in the Lager (camps), even though memory is fallible.
It is "the shame which the just man experiences when confronted by a crime committed by another, and he feels remorse because of its existence, because of its having been irrevocably introduced into the world of existing things, and because his will has proven nonexistent or feeble and was incapable of putting up a good defense." (The quote is from Levi's book The Awakening.) He sees shame written on the faces of the Russian soldiers who liberate his camp.
What I admire most about Levi is his refusal to accept any of the easy answers that have been provided since the Shoah to "explain" the events that took place in Europe in the '30s and '40s.
Instead of laying blame or bestowing forgiveness, he simply accepts historical events, and looks at how people behaved in those historical events.
Furthermore, by looking for easy blames, we ignore the potential culpability that we ourselves have, and in doing so fail to prevent future genocide.As dark as that sounds, they're still stunning essays.
The voices of these Holocaust survivors become ever more important as attrition takes them from us and their story becomes doubted by some.The Drowned and the Saved is a powerful metaphor for the concentration camp experience.
Those who emerged became the Saved, those who perished became the Drowned.
As in the two books that I referenced above, Levi tells us that those who appear to be the Saved had to do some brutal things to get that status.
He says that the Saved were the prisoners who didn’t actually touch bottom while in the camps.
lettura perenneQuesto libro non lo finirò mai.Perchè non riesco a leggerlo dall'inizio alla fine, ma
Riletto per non dimenticare. Crudeltà e orrori inimmaginabili vengono descritti in uno stile analitico, piano e pacato che rende il resoconto delle vicende vissute dall'autore e le sue considerazioni in merito ancora più toccanti, terribili e sconvolgenti. Bellissimo.
His chapters cover: the fallibility of memory of the perpetrators and the German people who let it happen; the levels of culpability for the many in the "gray zone" of responsibility; the sources of the sense of shame felt by the victims; the barriers to understanding and communication between the lower class Germans who ran the camp and the polyglot mixture of Jews and political prisoners; the origins and destructiveness of the pervasive "useless" violence employed on the interned; the special hell experienced by intellectuals in the camp; answers to stereotyped thinking in naive questions on why so few Jews escaped or rebelled; and reflections on the letters he exchanged over the years with German readers of Levi's books.
This desire for simplification is justified, but the same does not always apply to simplification itself, which is a working hypothesis, useful as long as it is recognized as such and not mistaken for reality.Here, as with other phenomena, we are dealing with a paradoxical analogy between victim and oppressor, and we are anxious to be clear: both are in the same trap, but it is the oppressor, and [they] alone, who has prepared it and activated it, and if [they] suffer[] from this, it is right t
The work's not perfect, as in addition to the usual ableist mumbo jumbo there's the mystical way in which generally worded arguments somehow pass over various nationalizities and socioeconomic systems as many a European-birthed morality bulwark does, but Levi is not a saint, and the skeleton he built will always need the flesh that has been brought forth between now and the time he put forth his incalculably valuable philosophy.
I felt compelled to read this (and other Holocaust literature) after the travesty that was the election of Donald Trump and the re-elevation of white supremacy and the entrenchment of Republican rule at all levels of government.
Because it is not hyperbole to say that it *is* happening again now.
I read this to try to figure some way that it might be stopped this time.
But I don't think it can..."It took place in the teeth of all forecasts...
it happened that an entire civilized people...
followed a buffoon...
It only awaits its new buffoon...
Five deep 5 stars...Primo Levi became a thinker and an intellectual after his experience as lager prisoner.
He survived the Holocaust, but never acknowledged the reason why.
He defined him self as a non believer and died the same way.
Ironically, His books prove that he was wrong, because after all this time, the reason of his survival is undenieable: He lived to become a witness and give testimony to all of us, so we can learn, so we can avoid evilness and try to be tolerant, respectful and peaceful, because otherwise we could only be instrument of our own destruction...LZM
The author looks on such stories with nothing in the way of moral judgment; naturally it is shocking and repulsive that men like Rudolph Hoss might absolve themselves in their own memories, that they might in fact not be tormented by the guilt we’d expect them to feel — but these failings are depicted as entirely human, and the end product of a totalitarian state which enabled the individual to point only towards the regime when queried as to their motives.
Era quello scelto da Levi per la sua opera prima ( che l'editore poi cambiò in 'se questo è un uomo') ed è stato quello definitivo della sua ultima opera.'I sommersi e i salvati' apre e chiude il cerchio di una testimonianza letteraria e storica, si presenta come un binomio, ma si risolve in un equivalenza, nell'idea che l'opzione in realtà non esiste.Nella proposizione iniziale i sommersi sono coloro che l'olocausto ha travolto e, di contro, i salvati sarebbero coloro che hanno avuto la possibilità di riemergere dal campo di sterminio alla vita, per fortuna e contingenze.
Chissà quanta sofferenza è costata la stesura di questo saggio a Primo Levi.
Lavora sul senso di colpa del “salvato” cui pesa come macigno la domanda “perché io e non un altro?”.
Non si trovano le parole per dare una dimensione allo scritto di Levi.
Per onorare i sommersi, per dare un senso al dolore dei salvati è nostro dovere ricordare, tramandare le loro testimonianze.
È nostro dovere per loro, per noi e per chi sarà dopo di noi.
Perché la vittoria del male avverrà il giorno in cui ciò che è stato sarà dimenticato.
Nei vari capitoli vengono affrontati gli aspetti del “fenomeno Lager che ancora appaiono oscuri”: la natura delle testimonianze; la capacità dei sopravvissuti di ricordare e di farsi comprendere da chi non ha condiviso con loro la lotta per l’esistenza nei Lager; la zona grigia, preponderante rispetto alle dicotomie buoni-cattivi o vittime-carnefici, irrealistiche e semplificatorie; la vergogna di essere sopravvissuti; l’incomunicabilità e la babele delle lingue nei campi di concentramento; l’uso della violenza fine a se stessa (uno dei capitoli più “duri”); la vita degli intellettuali nei campi (capitolo scritto come risposta alle tesi del filosofo di origine austriaca Jean Améry, sopravvissuto ad Auschwitz, anche lui morto suicida nel 1978); la questione della presunta incapacità dei prigionieri di ribellarsi al sistema.
Witness protection has been a matter that most legal systems have been trying to achieve both at the national and international levels.
Most court cases will fail if witnesses do not attend.
Other witnesses may attend but the question is whether they can remember what happened to them.
When Mr. Levi says that no witnesses can give the same account about what happened, he is right.
Suspects will easily lie in court by stating that they have either forgotten or do not know what happened.
Ci viene chiesto dai giovani tanto pi� spesso e tanto pi� insistentemente quanto pi� quel tempo si allontana, chi erano, di che stoffa erano fatti, i nostri "aguzzini".
Invece erano fatti dell nostra stessa stoffa, erano esseri umani medi, mediamente intelligenti, mediamente malvagi: salvo eccezioni, non erano mostri, avevano il nostro stesso viso, ma erano stati educati male.
Erano in massima parte gregari e funzionari rozzi e diligenti: alcuni fanaticamente convinti del verbo nazista, molti indifferenti, o paurosi di punizioni, o desiderosi di fare carriera o troppo ubbidienti Qualunque altra parola mi sembra inessenziale su questo libro cos� necessario.
The third of a sort of Primo Levi Trilogy about Auschwitz and the holocaust, these books are really touching and teach a lot about the way people survived (or died) not only in the camps themselves, but also even after liberation.All sorts of "schemes" existed for those who wanted to stay alive, and the Author has a keen awareness that sometimes not all who survived were the "best" people, but those that somehow managed to find a way to stay alive.An incredible testimony.Maria Carmo,Lisbon, 15 August 2015.
Un lucido ragionare su fatti atrocemente vissuti, subiti dal protagonista di questo libro. Come scrive l'autore:"La vendetta non mi interessava... A me spettava capire, capirli."
If you study WW II, you must read this book. It answers questions both spoken and unspoken.
"Nós sobreviventes somos uma minoria anómala além de exígua: somos os que, por prevaricação ou habilidade ou sorte, não tocaram o fundo. Quem o fez, quem viu a Górgona, não regressou para contar, ou regressou mudo; mas são eles, os que sucumbiram, as testemunhas integrais, aqueles cujo depoimento teria um significado geral. São eles a regra e nós a excepção."   Os que sucumbem e os que se salvam é o livro de Primo Levi que encerra a  Trilogia de Auschwitz , iniciada com  Se Isto é um Homem  e
Sentimo-lo como um dever, e ao mesmo tempo como um risco: o risco de parecermos anacrónicos, e de não sermos ouvidos.” Entre os temas abordados nos oito ensaios destaco:“A memória da ofensa”, onde o autor reflecte sobre as justificações criadas para os actos cometidos e o nível de consciência dos agressores (activos ou cúmplices passivos) relativamente aos mesmos: “… há de facto quem minta conscientemente falsificando a frio a própria realidade, mas são mais numerosos os que levantam ferro e se afastam, momentaneamente ou para sempre, das recordações genuínas e fabricam uma realidade mais cómoda“ .
Willingly or not we come to terms with power, forgetting that we are all in the ghetto, that the ghetto is walled in, that outside the ghetto reign the lords of death, and that close by the train is waiting.""Are you ashamed because you are alive in place of another?
It is no more than a supposition, indeed the shadow of a suspicion: that each man is his brother's Cain, that each one of us (but this time I say "us" in a much vaster, indeed, universal sense) has usurped his neighbor's place and lived in his stead.
Careful, complex, painful, and a great challenge (though certainly not the author's intent) to be the kind of person Levi was.
I think "The Gray Zone" should be required reading for all ethics courses, and "The Memory of the Offense," "Shame," and "Communicating" would be excellent additions to a psychology course curriculum.
That chapter made me feel a bit uneasy, for reasons I'm having a hard time articulating.
I think about it and I always appreciate the particular kind of loss he describes, but always alongside some uneasiness.
Maybe later I'll figure out what that uneasiness stems from and why.
There are many memoirs about the holocaust, but I'd argue that there are not many that are as intellectually stimulating, morally conflicting, thought-provoking and philosophically interesting as "The Drowned and the Saved." Levi--an Italian Jew who was captured and tortured after 1943 when the Nazis came to his native Turin, Italy--was sent to Auschwitz and subjected to all the horrors of the death camps.
In this striking work, the author looks back many years later and writes a series of eight essays asking impossible questions, offering no substantive answers (how can one possibly answer for the horrors committed?) and speculating on the variety of human behaviors and self-deceptions on the part of the Nazis AND prisoners of all backgrounds (including Jews, gypsies, political prisoners).
If you are still thinking that America is like Nazi Germany after reading William Shirer’s Rise and Fall of the Third Reich, then there is no hope for you.
But if you are a thoughtful, reflective person and sometimes wonder how it was that Germany went astray, then you might read this book.
SPOILER ALERTThere is a letter from a German at the end of the book that makes one think.
The letter writer, a German who supported the Nazi Party, explains that as between the Communists and the Nazis, he simply chose the lesser of two evils.

Wow. This novel is different from any other that I've read on the Holocaust, and I've read quite a few.
Levi told his story through narrative in "Survival in Auschwitz" but in "The Drowned and the Saved," he's taking a look back at that and his other works, and his experience in general.
This book is worth reading for everyone because of Levi's articulate and well-thought out points about the Holocaust, but especially insightful for someone who's been interested in the subject in a long time and wants a more philosophical viewpoint by a survivor.
Never bitter and always logical, Levi's honesty shows through beautifully in his last masterpiece.
