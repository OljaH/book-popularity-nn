Golden has done his research and is well-educated on his subjects, and I have no problem with people reading from, taking interest in, and even learning from this book; I do, however, think it is important that readers don't conflate the American novel with Japanese reality.
They aren't the same thing, no matter how much research Golden did, and if we take the book as an accurate representation we're actually underestimating and undervaluing geisha, Japan, and Japanese culture.Because Golden attempts to write from within the geisha culture, as a Japanese woman, he must do more than report the "facts" of that life--he must also pretend to be a part of it.
If you're looking to learn something deep about the psychology of Japanese culture, or meet nuanced characters, then I'd steer you elsewhere.
There's a way in which the book, written by a man and a westerner, is slightly fetishistic, but less so than you might imagine.Another reader suggested that perhaps the superficiality of the story is intentional, and that the book, in a way, resembles a geisha.
Beautiful and eager to please, yet too distant to really learn much from and ultimately little more than a beautiful, well-crafted object to be appreciated.
If that's the case, Arthur Golden is remarkably clever, and I applaud him.

Geisha Mineko Iwasaki basis for Chiyo/Sayori.Chiyo, with her sister Satsu, and her mother and father live in a shack by the sea on the coast of Japan.
There are people in the way, keeping them from being together, and so even though there were many geishas who wished for her level of success she still couldn’t help feeling sad.
I really did feel like I was sitting down for tea with Sayori, many years later, and she, as a way of entertaining me, was telling me her life story.
It feels like Golden thought it would be a good idea to emphasize all the Japan-and-nature clichés to the point of ridiculousness : I still can't believe how many times he compares something to the nature.
I know it's the way she's supposed to behave, but still, it's infuriatingly boring to read about such a character.
He wrote a whole book about someone's life, and the final chapter is soo rushed and it goes like "So that was forty years ago, now I'm seventy and I'm old and I'm gonna tell you what happened in my life between then and now in like, two sentences.
This book was wonderful. I absolutely love the movie, which I now need to watch! In many ways, this was a sad story for me. I would really like to read a biography of a geisha and watch a documentary to really look into their world.  We lead our lives like water flowing down a hill, going more or less in one direction until we splash into something that forces us to find a new course. Happy Reading! Mel 🖤🐶🐺🐾
Damn if you aren't one of the most problematic things I've ever read, Memoirs of a Geisha.Like much of non-Asian America, I was swept up in the delight of reading this book in 2000.
An insightful, curious, and caring look into the mysterious world of geisha, Arthur Golden peels away the ignorance and labeling that westerners have covered the secretive Japanese profession.
Her witty anecdotes and thoughtful mannerisms in speaking make Memoirs of a Geisha a delightful and unstoppable read."Then I got older, went to college and graduate school, and developed a critical, thinking eye.And I'm mad at myself.insightful?
I see the geisha in that light: like La Marilyn, the geisha are symbol of tragedy and misplaced youth and beauty.The plot is orchestrated in that well-intentioned Great Novel tradition.
Metaphors and similes are very effectively used here, & their dual purpose is clear: it tells the life story in a very non-nebulous manner, in clear, concise, not-to-be-misconstrued mode; and the words seem authentic enough to evoke an actual geisha-- it is her telling you her memoirs, sitting there with you, drinking tea.Also, Hastumomo, in the role of ugly stepsister, is an adversary from hell.
For in Gion, Japan, the geisha are treated like a lot of women have been, like objects, pawns, or even disembodied ideas.
I admit, as I reached the end of the book, I came to realize why the author tried to portray this story as a real life story when writing the introduction but I will write about that later.I liked the writing style.
And even though I wanted Chiyo to reach the love of her life and therefore happiness more than anything, I liked Nobu a lot too.
Somewhere along the way, I had started to dream of a fairy-tale style happy ending for little Chiyo and reading the last pages of the book left me a little sad.
I read this a long time ago ---(a favorite) --- Its amazing a 'male' wrote this book. (sure 'felt' like a female speaking).

Just skews things a bit.- Kind of slow - even thought I thought the storytelling was great, there were a few times where it started to drag and I was ready to move on to the next part of the story.- Accuracy - Without Goodreads, I would have probably never have known this, but it seems there is some question as to the accuracy of the account in this book.
I am not completely sure, but it should provide some interesting follow up research.So, I am going to go with 4 stars because it was an interesting story and despite some slow spots and creepers, it was pretty entertaining.
Pretty Chiyo, with beautiful eyes, to become a geisha after a long apprenticeship and the unlucky, plain Satsu, an abused prostitute....In a house that never becomes a home, in the former royal capital of Kyoto, in the section called Gion, where most geisha live, and the tea houses to entertain rich men, there, the scared girl is under the complete control of three money- hungry women, who show no pity, Granny, (she has coins in her heart) the matriarch, and her two adopted daughters, Mother, the real boss, and Auntie, they love nicknames, both are as unfeeling as Granny.
I never wrote a review of it because when I first joined GR I didn't really know what it was all about.
It took a bit before it sunk in for me.Now GR members get spammed at times.
The newest form of spam is review bumping.
Several times a day.
Now my friend Kat decided to take a stand..she made a awesome little badge to show we are all fabulous..not just the top reviewers, and my friend Kelly has a great idea..we are gonna spread some love.
Everyone on GR is Goodreads Fabulous.Here's my friend Argona's review for this book.
Her's is much better than anything I could have written..Go show her some love.Argona..you are Goodreads Famous baby!
I knew absolutely nothing about the Geisha tradition going into this book, and I feel like I've learnt so much!
I never would have guessed that I could become so invested in the life of a single girl, who is growing up in a country I don't have any connection to, and who is living a lifestyle I've never thought all too much about before.I thing the exquisite writing style is what truly makes this book.
Of course the plot is interesting as well (especially if, like me, you don't know anything about all the work that goes into becoming a Geisha), but without  Arthur Golden's wonderful storytelling it would have been only half as good.
I can finally cross Memoirs of a Geisha off my list. I had my doubts about this book, but I'm happy to say I was wrong.

A beautiful, poingnant story that is so incredibly, lyrically captivating you are seduced from the very first word. An absolute work of art, each page overflows with beautiful, sensual, evocative images. Such is the skill and authority of Golden's writing, I feel as though I have spent hours, being entertained by the most gifted of all Geisha. Utterly Satisfying. I want to read it again for the very first time!
Very entertaining, but kind of made me gag. Everything was written in this faux-asian "My heart ached like cherry blossom petals floating on the river..." bullshit.
Loved the book and the writing but there was something about it that I passionately disliked as well. I can’t explain it as I myself don’t understand it but it definitely hindered my enjoyment to the full. I was also somewhat take aback by my sheer dislike for Sayuri. I feel like I’m the only one who actively disliked her to this extent but there were moments where I felt so infuriated by her, by her selfishness, her utter lack of loyalty, her self-importance... I just couldn’t stand her.
Memoirs of a Geisha is a book that is based on a true story and let’s us catch a glimpse	of the world where the women paint their faces and don’t deserve to love.Based in the 1920’s in Kyoto, Japan a young girl named Chiyo lives with her sister Satsu, in a poor town called Yoriodo along with her sick mother and elderly father.
Sayuri then becomes a geisha, and unexpectedly is adopted by oka-san and is the head of the okiya.
The door opens and instead of bringing Nobu as Sayuri asked, Pumpkin brought the Chairmen!
Sayuri runs to Pumpkin and asks why she would bring the Chairmen.
A Cinderella romance that unexpectedly swept me away!
Memoirs of a Geisha is a very picturesque and dramatic tale of a young village girl taken from her family and raised in Kyoto as a geisha.
Usually I don't go in for romance.
But I prefer my love stories to be true.
Well, that's good enough for me!I was dazzled by the details and enchanted by the well-paced plot.
Around the time I read Memoirs...
I got the chance to visit Kyoto and made a point, as many tourists do, of seeking out the Gion District.
The pain she suffered is well-depicted in the novel, we almost start to feel that pain with her; we often share the same surprises with her about the different things a geisha should or should not do, and even share the pleasures of success regardless of the fact that most of us despise the geisha way of life.A slave, sold by your own family, and trained for the sole purpose of pleasuring men, whether you like it or not.
On the surface, the book presents an interesting subject.
The life of a geisha is fascinating, especially to a westerner who has little knowledge of Japanese culture.
Golden does do a fine job describing the day to day rituals, life and culture of a Kyoto geisha in the 1930's.
The Chairman comforts Sayrui when she is very young and distressed; she then falls in love with him after this brief encounter and spends the next 20 years or so of her life attempting to find some way to be with him.
Jesus! This is one long-a$$ book. It took me two weeks to finish but I did it. And in the end, it made me cry. Now I am sad that its over. I wish this book was never-ending on paper as much as this is everlasting in my mind. Perfect. Sad. Beautiful. A great love story.
I read this book for the Goodreads' book club Diversity in All Forms! If you would like to join the discussion here is the link: https://www.goodreads.com/topic/show/...This is a realistic-fiction story about geishas in Japan. The book is based off of a lot of research the author did and what their lives were like. The book was very good and detailed their everyday experiences. Geisha's whole purpose was to be trained to beguile the most powerful men. Their whole life as a geisha is to be surrounded by men.
The book in itself presents an interesting story, and makes for an entertaining read, but what bothers me about this book is that the vast majority of Western readers interpret it as a historically accurate memoir, when in fact it was written by an American author for an American audience, and therefore has achieved its success through appealing to and reinforcing the stereotypes about Japanese culture in America.
What disappoints me the most is that Golden holds a degree in Japanese History, and still the inaccuracies and stereotypes that he was raised with win out over historical fact in his writing.
Absolutely  stunning  and flawless. Promoted to one of my all-time favorite books.I've no clue how the author wrote this, being that he is not a geisha, not Japanese, not a woman, not from the World War II era, etc., etc.... but it is absolutely incredible.
Chiyo and her sister, Satsu, live in the fishing village of Yoroido, on coastal Japan.
He sells Satsu into a brothel and Chiyo into a geisha house.
Because Chiyo tried to run away with her sister, she is demoted to a maid for two years.Life in the okiya (geisha house) is difficult.
Hatsumomo, a geisha who lives in the okiya, is cruel and manipulative.
Soon Chiyo's training as a geisha begins and her name will change to Sayuri.I found this novel intriguing and captivating.
I recommend this novel to those interested in the life of a geisha.
The story reads like an autobiography.
Memoirs is about the life of this peasanth girl, Sayuri, in pre and post-WW2 Japan who is sold into life as an apprentive Geisha, and then ultimately, an actual Geisha.
So the Geisha are women in Japan who are trained in the arts - playing music, dancing, acting, performing tea ceremonies, etc.
They make their living entertaining wealthy Japanese men (business men, doctors, political figures), usually in large groups, in tea houses.
There are some pretty disgusting scenarios in the book where they just come off like highly-paid prostitutes, but for the most part, the girls in the book are very colorful, strong-willed, and interesting.
Allowing for the author's creativity, this book is a brilliant telling of Chio's life in her own words. I was immediately drawn into her story to make a moving thought-provoking memoir. Told in such a way as you the reader can almost palpably feel every emotion. From overwhelming sadness, fear, to tears of joy and elation. I loved everything about this book. The characters are interesting and well developed and the plot is riveting.
