Weirdly, though, aside from the lack of cell phones and Google, the book didn't feel particularly dated to me.
I enjoyed all the threaded stories, especially Rachel's, even though it was very easy to see to from very early on who she was going to turn out to be.
My one complaint is that by the end of the book, I was a bit tired of so many story lines, and it all ended up being just a bit too long.
(hide spoiler)]I am including the following Trigger Warning list, though, because this book does have a gritty side to it and there are a number of issues that keep popping up throughout the narrative.
4 "An Empire Built to Destroy Another" for the story and 4.5 Stars for the narration!The best phrase to describe this epic saga that spans decades and transcends dozens of interconnected lives is: "Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned." Lovers of deep meticulous revenge plots will love the message of this novel.
All are extremely successful women and all have very special reasons for needing a place like Butterfly where their secret desires can be catered to or where they can be free to let go of their particular inhibitions and fears in order to experience pleasure.
The book is MUCH better than I remembered, with a good story that spans decades providing the framework for the private club that provides the book with its name.
The "current day" portion of the book covers four women who visit Butterfly for their own reasons, following not only the encounters they have there but also how they learn from them for their own lives.
I'm glad I reread the book, and pleased that the depth and layering of the story turned out to be so much better than what I remembered.
As her story unfolds you begin to see how she fits into the story being told in the present, but really she is the main character of the book and she is phenomenal.This story is all about revenge and women taking charge of their own lives.
Her writing was just a joy to read and I know that I am going to be seeking out more of her books.I would recommend this to anyone who likes a good mixture of things in their books.
This isn't really a romance, lovey-dovey book.
4,5 🌟Sencillamente genial! Una historia que tiene de todo. Historias sobre las relaciones y lo que buscamos en ellas. Una historia de venganza al mejor estilo de El Conde de Montecristo... vaya que si la he disfrutado...Me han encantado los personajes y sus historias de superación y descubrimiento.100% recomendada - Comenzaré de una vez con la segunda parte
Butterfly is a well written novel, with believable characters and a strong plot.Kathryn Harvey's Butterfly is a story about life.
The book follows Rachel for 35 years as she works extremely hard to earn money, prestige, and power.
Danny was the one person in Rachel's life that she thought she could count on, however he ended up hurting her the most.
Butterfly has found a place on the highly coveted Top Shelf of my bookcase; reserved only for the books I truly appreciate.If you are looking for a great summer read, Butterfly is for you.
While I've seen others write that this book is not really erotica or that it's about a poor making it rich story, I'm not really interested in classifying it as either.
It let me know that there were other females out there who have felt as I did.
It helped me pull myself out of a funk and roughly 2 decades later, I assess where I am compared to my bruised 16 year old self.
I recommend this book to other women who have experienced unfortunate circumstances and think it will never get better.
Your success and overcoming them makes them lose.
It is the story of Rachel Dwyer, and how far she will go to right the wrongs done to her.This book is a fascinating look at the lengths one smart and determined woman will go to, in order to cause the utter humiliation of the one person who ruined her life.
Above all, this is the story of Rachel Dwyer and Danny McKay, and how things can go so terribly wrong sometimes.This book begins in the late seventies, at Butterfly, with the women who want to fulfill their fantasies and feel something.
Bu yorum 5. ÜKG Blog Tur çerçevesinde  Kitap Hayvanı'nın Günlüğü 'nde yayınlandı.Öncelikle belirtme gereği duyuyorum ki, Kelebek sanıldığı gibi Fifty Shades ve benzeri kitaplara benzemiyor. Tamam, yalan söylemeyeceğim; ilk başta ben de öyle sanmıştım. Ancak hem yayınevinin söylemi üzerine hem de okuduğum yorumlardan sonra öyle olmadığını düşünmeye başladım. Ta ki kitabı okuyana kadar. O zaman erotic romance diye bildiğimiz, yani cinsellik üzerine kurulu aşkı anlatan kitaplara hiç de benzemediğin
O zaman erotic romance diye bildiğimiz, yani cinsellik üzerine kurulu aşkı anlatan kitaplara hiç de benzemediğini anladım.Kelebek, sıradan bir aşk romanı değil.
Ve bir de Rachel Dywer var.Rachel, henüz on dört yaşındayken hayatın pislikleriyle tanışmak zorunda kalmış.
Hayatının en kötü gecelerinden birinde evden kaçmak zorunda kalan Rachel aslında bunun sadece bir başlangıç olduğundan bihaber.
Bu henüz çocuk sayılabilecek yaştaki saf kız, sırılsıklam âşık olduğu Danny Mackay'in ona neler yapabileceğinin elbette farkında değil.Kitap Kelebek'in müdavimlerinin hikâyelerini anlatırken, sık sık geçmişe dönüp Rachel'ın öyküsünü aktarıyor.
Tam kıvamındaydı.Kelebek, pek çok kadının içindeki feministi ortaya çıkaracak türden bir kitap.
Butterfly is a book with something of a split personality, as if it's not quite sure if it wants to be women's erotica or one of those "woman rises from poverty and makes multimillions" sagas that were so popular in the eighties.
(It's not hard to figure out who she is!) But Beverly has a few surprises up her sleeve.The other plotline centers on Butterfly, a high-class brothel for women.
I can see him being shocked at a regular affair, but when you add prostitution into the mix, a guy like that would be more likely to retort that she had to pay for sex because she's not pretty enough to attract a lover.
Kitap kesinlikle +18 değil.Kitabı gerek kapak tasarımı gerekse arka kapak konusunda merak uyandırıcı tanıtımı ile Tüyap'ta almıştım ve o zamandan beri de biraz sallıyordum çünkü erotik bir kitap olduğunu sanıyordum.
Bunun yanında günümüze dönüp de Kelebek ile ilgili sayfalarda insanda Rachel ve Danny ile nasıl bağlantı kurulacağı merakını uyandırıyor.Yaşadıklarına rağmen Rachel'in ayakta kalması ve yükselmesi kesinlikle en çok okunmaya değer sayfalardı...
Onlar açısından güzel olan kısım aşklarını bulup, Kelebek'e ihtiyaçlarının artık kalmaması...Eğer daha uzun bir yorum yaparsam kitap içeriğine gireceğim sizlerde de okuma isteği bırakmayacağım.
Bu yüzden kısa kesip şiddetle okumanızı tavsiye edeceğim bir kitap olduğunu söyleyerek yorumumu bitireceğim.
I found this one on the trashy book dollar rack at my local bookstore but I wouldn't classify this as glitter trash or smut, even though the back cover teases this.
It's more of a slow, patient, obsessive revenge story with some Butterfly client stories thrown in.
I think Beverly's character is a bad-ass but in a kind of cold, and borderline one-dimensional way like Clint Eastwood.
Her lack of true character development made the climatic revenge scene the novel builds to sort of dissatisfying.
I think the book would have worked better if Beverly had been given a tighter focus.
Lots of successful women show up at Butterfly to pay for and recieve what they do not get at home.
I found it to be a very original idea and enjoyed reading about women that shun traditional society and just get what they want, even if they have to pay for it.
Danny is the current television evangelist that years before ruined Beverly's young life by throwing her into a world of prostitution at the tender age of 14.
I also found I enjoyed reading about young Beverly more than older Beverly.
Revenge, Religion and PoliticsYou can be deceived by the cover, but open up and start reading. The main character Rachel will keep you engaged in her strive to get revenge on Danny. Kathryn Harvey truly crafted a amazing story taking you through decades of an artfully plotted revenge,touching all areas of sex, Religion and politics. No spoilers, so start reading.
Kadınların başrolda olduğu bir roman okumak güzeldi :) Ve belkide en güçlü kadın karakterler Top 10 listesine yeni giren ve yerini sağlamlaştıran Beverley'i okumak hoştu. Ama En Bastar/Asshole/SonofBitch erkek karakterler listesine 1. sırdan giren Danny'i okumak o kadar da güzel değildi malesef.
A friend let me read her paperback copy of this years ago. I loved it then, and I loved the rereading. I still have never found a copy of this, except for Kindle, so I bought the whole set. Once you read this, the concept of a women's fantasy coming true just kind of sticks with you. I have never forgotten Beverly and her messed up life either. Now onto the second book..
Bu yorum aynı zamanda ÜKG Blog Turu adına Romancekolikte yayınlanmıştır.Romance'ten biraz sıkılıp farklı şeylere yönelmek istediğim bir dönemde Kelebek'i okuduğuma seviniyorum.Benim için oldukça değişik bir kurguydu. Sanırım ben böyle kitapları seviyorum. Daha önce de aynı bu şekilde çoklu anlatımı olan, geçmiş ile geleceğin anlatıldığı kitaplar okumuştum. Sanırım en güzel örnek Dantel - Shirley Conrad olacaktır. Beni sürekli okumaya yönelten hep bir entrika bulunuyor hikayelerinde. Kathryn'in
Bu yorum aynı zamanda ÜKG Blog Turu adına Romancekolikte yayınlanmıştır.Romance'ten biraz sıkılıp farklı şeylere yönelmek istediğim bir dönemde Kelebek'i okuduğuma seviniyorum.Benim için oldukça değişik bir kurguydu.
Beklediğim, ummadığım bir çok olayı boş yakalandığım anlarda karşıma çıkardı.Yalnız kitap insanı feministliğe yönlendiren bir tarzı var.
Kadınların sadece amacının hala cinsel öğe ya da doğuracak bir kısrak gibi görüldüğü dönemlerde yaşayan baş karakterimiz Rachel'ın başına gelenler insanı içini cızlatacak derecede.
Adamdan öyle bir intikam aldı ki, süründürdü bir güzel.
Mutlu sonla bitmeyen kitaplara antipatim vardır.Özetle gelgitlerle - duygusal açıdan - okuduğum bu kitap bende çok hoş bir his bıraktı.
O tür bir beklentiyle alıp okursanız, elinizde çok farklı bir şey bulacaksınızdır.
Als die 14 jähre Ausreißerin Rachel dem charismatischen Danny begegnet, schenkt sie ihm all ihre Liebe, nur um zwei Jahre später sich in der Gosse wiederzufinden.
Sie wird Inhaberin einer riesigen Fastfoodkette, Komiteemitglied zur Neugestaltung von Hollywood und Besitzerin eines Clubs für Frauen mit besonderen Wünschen.
Als Danny Mackay für das Amt des Präsidenten der Vereinigten Staaten kandidiert, lässt sie sein Machtgefüge zusammenstürzen wie ein Kartenhaus und weidet sich an seinem tiefen Fall.Barbara Wood schrieb den Roman „Butterfly“ unter dem Pseudonym Kathryn Harvey.
Vor mehr als 10 Jahren habe ich dieses Buch schon einmal gelesen und es hat in den Jahren für mich nichts an seiner Originalität eingebüsst.
En umutsuz zamaninda karşısina cıkan bu yakışıklı genç adam onu çok zor bir durumdan kurtardi Rachel'de ona o an aşık oldu.O kadar ki onu eli ile teslim edip fahişelik yapmasına bile sesini cıkarmadi.
Rachel onun gercek yüzü ile tanıstıginda ise yemin etti intikam icin yasayacakti.
Danny'i yıllarca izledi o intikam saati icin yasadı..Ona en yüksekten uçuruma indirmeye yemin etmişti..İşte bu Kelebek Klubü de onun için harika araçtı..Kimse bu kulübün sahibini kim çalıştırdığını bilmiyordu..Kulübün ana amacı Danny Mackay'ı mahvetmek için kurulması idi.
I then got more and more frustrated as it became more apparent that Harvey thought that a past is enough to shape a characters personality when it really really really doesn't.
True she dedicated word space to them but I don't think she really thought about their characters beyond giving them each a female empowerment issue.
Which I am also against, seeing as I feel that the past shapes you as a person which therefore impacts your future but does not shape it as I think Harvey beleives.So. All in all I would say never ever read this book.
Above an exclusive men's store on Rodeo Drive there is a private club called Butterfly, where women are free to act out their secret erotic fantasies.
Only the most beautiful and powerful women in Beverly Hills are invited to join ...Jessica—The lawyer, who longs for the days when men were men, and women dressed to please themTrudie—The builder, who wants a man who will challenge her-all of her-with no holds barredLinda—The surgeon, who uses masks to unmask the desires she hides even from herselfBut the most mysterious of them all is the woman who created Butterfly.
And now she is about to reveal everything to realize the dream that has driven her since childhood—the secret obsession that will carry her beyond ecstasy, or destroy her and everyone around her!
This book wasn't bad, but it was long and took me a while to get into.
The main storyline was actually an interesting tale of revenge and could have stood alone.
I found the stories about the women who went to Butterfly however, didn't really add anything to the storyline and were a bit of a distraction.
Contrary to reviews that promote this book as sexy, or erotic, some even lumping it in with 50 Shades, it is none of that.
The main story was a 3.5 for me but the distraction of the other storylines, which could have been a book on their own, loses a half star.
You ever crave a a delicious, sinful treat?
I remember reading this book as a teenager and loving it in all its trashy goodness.
I had a yen to revisit this story, so I picked it and started reading from the beginning.
And it was as good as I remembered.
No spoilers, but fair warning - this book has NO redeeming social value.
It exists for a fun read.
If you read this expecting some degree of literary value, you'll be disappointed.
Read it because it's fun and you can enjoy every last drop of goodness.
"Butterfly" by Kathryn Harvey gives out the message of "watch your back". Influencing the reader to be careful of who you trust. This story is about starting from the lowest you can be to becoming someone strong and powerful. That women shouldn't let men determine her capabilities. Of all the books I have read as a young adult, this one had a massive impact on me. It's one of my favorite books of all time.
this is not my normal book but because of a friend's recommendation I decided to give it a try. I am not really into romance novels or trashy novels as you would call them but this one actually has a pretty involved story which makes the reading fun and interesting. there's not as many romance type-scenes as to be expected in this type of a novel which helped me get through it a little bit faster. I am excited to read the second one to see where they take the storyline.
It was a good story of revenge, but it could have been told in about half the 520 pages. There were several off-shoot stories that could have been left out of the book because they didn't add anything, other then they visited Butterfly. I found myself skimming the book after about 300 pages because I just wanted the story over.
Read this book when I was in high school and loved it. All my high school girl friends read this book as well and this was definitely a favorite of ours. Until now! After more than 15 years, we are still talking about this book.
This was a good book. It just was not the book for me. Also, I feel like the characters and plot were well developed. The story just made me confused and it made me put the book down a couple of times. Overall, an okay book.
I was close to putting it down at the beginning, then it took a turn. The backstory was great connecting it with the present story. Yes it is a girl book, but very interesting plot from a guys point of view.
This book is soooo corny. So bad you have to like it. Kathryn Harvey must watch a lot of dayime soaps & Lifetime movies ;)
