I know I keep barking on about these classics but, it is where imagination blooms. The time machine film with Rod Taylor was brilliant and the old 1950's film the War Of The Worlds too. The remakes not so much. The album by Jeff Wayne narrated by Richard Burton...Timeless.🐯👍
The narrator of TTM actually uses the term "utopia" several times, and I wondered while reading if his own book made Wells want to explore his own ideas further.
Since this is the film version of a book, I thought I'd add it here by way of comparison.What I really liked about the movie was how the beginning was handled.
Wells wrote the book in 1894, but the movie is set at the fin-de-siècle, which contributes to the tension of the time travelling and of what George discovers through his travels.
Okay I am biased I cannot praise this book enough for either story.
considering how it was described the version from the 1960 film still has massive influence even today with caricatures and impressions still finding their way in to popular culture even today.Both books I can read and re-read (and have) but for now I wanted to read the time machine again in preparation for the Morlock Nights - so I will not dwell too long here but say I forgot how much I love these two stories.
I really enjoyed The Time Machine.
Wells didn't batshit around with science, he just went in, said 'he built a time machine', and you dealt with it.
They want to know how the time machine was built.
The narrator admitted he didn't know what was going on the black smoke, or how the Martians flew, or what the deal with the Heat Ray was.
There was a bit more sci in the sci-fi, but it was still easy to read.Unfortunately, I didn't enjoy The War of the Worlds as much as The Time Machine.
But still an easy, fun read.
It is astounding that he wrote such great science fiction in the 1800s that you'd expect to read in the pulp fiction popularization of the 1960s!
Mentions of things like lasers (though not named as such) are impressive.Moreover Wells's works are just great reads and the opening to The War of the Worlds is second to none!
So chilling - I recommend listening to an audiobook version where these lines are read out:"...across the gulf of space, minds that are to our minds as ours are to those of the beasts that perish, intellects vast and cool and unsympathetic, regarded this earth with envious eyes, and slowly and surely drew their plans against us."
I read a combined edition of these two books for the SF Masterworks Reading Challenge and the Science Fiction Masterworks Book Club here on Goodreads.The Time MachineRead for the Need to Reread Challenge.I have, of course, read most of H.G. Wells before.
Powerful stuff, and of course, a must read for every fan of science fiction, if not everyone in our culture, period.The War of the WorldsRead for the Need to Reread Challenge.I've read this before, of course.
That's good writing.Finally, I know this line of critique has been advanced, and challenged, before, but it seems clear to me that Wells was doing what a good science fiction writer is supposed to do.
That way, he could tell the story that he wanted to without worrying about the nitty gritty details.
Something I didn't expect in War of the Worlds is that it isn't a story about defeating the invaders.
Not only is the first person narrator not a part of the military resistance, and he spends most of his time hiding and running, but the final downfall of the Martians has nothing to do with human efforts at all.
They all behave in different extreme ways to the emergency situation and that is the true story.
I had read The Time Machine some years ago and found it just as enjoyable on a second read.The War of the Worlds is my favorite between these two stories.
It's science-fiction set in our past, rather than our future, and as such presents all sorts of interesting asymmetries (the Victorian era didn't have firepower that could compete with the Martians' firepower, etc.).
It's a classic with good reason."At the time there was a strong feeling in the streets that the authorities were to blame for their incapacity to dispose of the invaders without all this inconvenience." (p.
I love these two stories. Reading them is a lot more rewarding than watching them as movies, only because of the visions others have sometimes don't gel with mine. The recent War of the Worlds came close to the way the planet ended up looking like in my mind. I love creating the picture and scene myself. That is in a good book. The Time Machine is one of my favorites and I have had many a child I tutored read it also! War of the Worlds too, though it is pretty gruesome the way Wells wrote it!
A great two in one science novel. The Time Machine is the best time travel story I've ever read, plus it leaves few to none headaches. The War of the Worlds is the first alien invasion story, and is the finest of the era. If you haven't read either of those I would highly recommend it. H.G Wells is one of the best science fiction authors out there. So if you are wary of science fiction dispel those woes, H.G Wells is the best writer to start reading science fiction from.
Finally heard the original. Wish I had read it decades ago. The book is so much better than the films that have attempted to bring this classic to life. Mr. Wells' social commentary is definitely lost in the screen adaptations. A must read/listen.
In the book there was really only three characters, there were other characters but they didn't have a big role and were barely mentioned in the story.1) The Time Traveller: 5- This character was described more that another character in the book, "His grey eyes shone and twinkled, and his usually pale face was flushed and animated"(Wells 1).
We are never told what his name is because the narrator of the story wants to keep his identy a secret, "Where's ---?" said I, naming our host" (Wells 13).This is really the only description of the Time Traveller that we get except for this following quote, after his journey through time, "He was amazing plight.
Maybe he didn't want to go that route and instead just stick on the science fiction path story without going into social commentary or what it all could mean.
I actually felt instead of ending the book where he did he could have written just as many pages about what happened with the aliens here and in control.
But the plot that was there I really enjoyed and wanted to know what was going to happen.I actually thought for a book published in 1898, the technology in the book was quite forward thinking.
The more I think about the book the more I like it.
Did not start. This is a long ago favourite(s) that I kept around to re-read. Every time I have gone to pick it up, I have put it back down again almost straight away. Certainly a classic(s), but I don't think I need to revisit it.
It was as if Wells, fully imbibing the progressive religion of the era saw how much further beyond the limits of his day technology could go--and then he saw just where that technology could take us, and it wasn't always upwards on a sure path of progress.And then he hit his stride with War of the Worlds, an almost shocking revelation to read in the original, because unlike the most well-known adaptations (the famously disturbing 1938 radio play and the 2005 Hollywood blockbuster) the original is set in Wells' time and space.
In the great country of England, the country side of London becomes an evil layer for the Martians who begin to attack with heat rays.
The plot is a bit lengthy so in a few sentences; the narrator is one of the first to find out about the Martians and quick on his feet to send his wife away to safety.
Without making the detail so lengthy, H.G. Wells attacks the scientific part of it awakening our imagination with the construction of the advanced technology that the Martians brought to Earth.
In this volume we have two shorter novels - the Time Machine and War of the Worlds.
The film also provides a lens that links the science fiction of the Victorian novel with the state of the world in 1960.
Wells sees the Eloi and the Morlocks as the culmination of the class war anticipated in late Victorian Britain.
It is an interesting twist that, eventually, the poor eat the rich!The novel of the War of the Worlds is far better than any fictional adaptation of it.
At the time of writing the book, it was assumed that it would be the German Empire that invaded Britain.
I still have quite a few more Wells and Verne books to read.The Time Machine: (4.5/5)I found some interesting parts in this book like how Wells described in the future that the beings were all vegetarians which I believe might be the case since its the best way to go to have a sustainable environment if we want earth to survive, but that's my opinion.
Wells was the first to write about a alien invasion that started the standard for science fiction to come later on (with a little influence from Jules Verne ^.^).
I think it actually, truly, added to my experience reading these books.The Time Machine.
It got a little slower for me when he was actually time travelling.
It's funny to me that this book caused people who heard it on the radio go into a panic.
The Martians came to earth and attacked the English for two weeks.
Wells did an excellent job of describing the chaos that ensued when the people were trying to escape the martians.
The Martians were killed by the bacteria of Earth since Mars has none.
The War of the Worlds was a simple, entertaining read.
The Time Machine was really interesting. It cast a picture of what might happen to our species in millions of years, if we're still around that long. The War of the Worlds was kind of silly. It might have seemed probable at the time it was written, but today we're so much more creative about aliens! This is too tame for our day and age.
If you're going to read either of these two books, get this edition. It has a really nifty introduction by Isaac Asimov that details the history of science fiction and H.G. Wells's enormous contribution thereto. Ha, I just used "thereto."
The Time Machine was terrifyingly wonderful in all of its dystopian glory. The War of the Worlds was so fantastically boring that I couldn't finish it (and it took about three weeks to read sixty effing pages). A mixed bag, to say the least.
Two timeless classics of early science fiction in one volume.
Wells at his best.
It was fascinating, but somewhat of a difficult read due to when it was published.
If you fell down yesterday, stand up today - H.G wellsGreat Classic
Loved it! It's when your imagination stops and the writer's story begins. the book was published in 1895 and it caught my attention
This is good fiction.
The Time Machine is a great story with some interesting social commentary; The War of the Worlds is beautifully intense.
