I love all of them.We all love Eve, don't we?Nixie is now an orphan and Eve needs to protect her and find the killers that murdered her family.
But kids and Eve don't mix.
And from across the room a child's voice demanded, "Where is Dallas?""Shit!
Shit a brick!"
Yep, Eve, a kid in the house will fairly cockblock any kind of intimacy!!
I think we'd both be good at it, either despite or because of where we came from."
"Sister and family moved to Nebraska.""Nebraska?
Sorry my Nebraska friends.
Even in a series of over 40 books which are consistently good, one or two have to stand out as being exceptional and Survivor In Death is probably one of them.
The best parts of the book as usual came from the relationships between the characters.
There is lots of humour to even up the gruesomeness of the crime and Peabody pushes back against Eve a lot more than usual, which is an entertainment all of its own!The ending arrived suddenly and was quick and violent, but ultimately satisfactory.
"But I want children with you, my lovely Eve. One day.""One day being far, far in the future. Like, I don't know, say a decade when...Hold on. Children is plural."He eased back, grinned. "Why, so it is--nothing slips by my canny cop.""You really think if I ever actually let you plant something in me--they're like aliens in there, growing little hands and feet." She shuddered. "Creepy. If I ever did that, popped a kid out--which I think is probably as pleasant a process as having your eyeballs

Thanks, Obama!Is it any wonder that we become bat-shit crazy?This book has a lot of emotions in it.
She was the lone survivor and witness, and now she is staying with Roarke and Eve to keep her safe while they look for the murderers.Dealing with this broken little girl also brings up a lot of emotional junk for both Roarke and Eve. They each have to deal with it in their own ways.
Suspense 4.5 stars / Romance 4.5 starsA perfect loving family was brutally murdered, 9-year-old girl survived.
I love how Eve handled the girl, I guess for those, who adore children, it could be too harsh; but I think Eve’s attitude was exactly what the girl needed.Romance.
Roarke and Eve spoke about kids.
Not the usual romance point of view, but it’s what they are.
I hope some day we read about them as parents!But also me secretly hoped they would adopt the girl :-( Well, they found a perfect solution, a new loving family for the child.Eve… I just love her!
:'( My heart broken for Nixie but I'm also so happy that she met with Eve & Roarke and the rest of Eve's team.
<3Ahhhh I just LOVE Eve & Roarke so, so much.
“I didn't even know how far off balance I'd been, and here you steady me.” He took her hands, kissed them.
“I want children with you, Eve.” The sound she made brought on a quick and easy grin.
“But I want children with you, my lovely Eve. One day.”“One day being far, far in the future.
“I do love you, and the rest is all in the vague and misty future.
Eve struggles with this case emotionally, and nearly cracks when the circumstances surrounding the tragedy hit a little too close to home for her.
Although the formula in this series is generally the same, each book brings about growth in the characters.
The tables are turning, and where in the past Peabody has held her tongue when she was around Eve, hesitant to express herself for fear of being reprimanded, she let loose in the book and gave as good as she got.
She is every bit a part of this series as Eve, Roarke, Peabody...the whole gang...she nails them every time!!
”Now Eve turned her head. “My pride in you bubbles in my heart. Unless it’s that soy dog you talked me into earlier.”“Gosh, Dallas, a blush rises to my cheeks. Unless that, too, is the soy dog.”She thumped a fist on her chest, gave a small, somehow ladylike belch. “Guess it was the dog.”“Now that we’ve established that, let’s have the next on the list.”  ”His skinny frame was festooned—Eve figured that was the word for it—in a neon orange skin-tank with sizzling blue pants that had some sort of

”… I’m not taking you off this case because I know if I were in your shoes—which would never happen, as I’d have to be beaten unconscious before you’d get those pink airboots on my feet—”Peabody’s lips twitched.
I’m really going to wear fish shoes.
The little girls pain when she says goodby to her parents was a really tear-jerker!
I’m addicted!!!
Another solid read in what I am deeming  THE BEST SERIES  I have read to date!J.D. Robb never fails to draw my emotions out while reading one of these books.The case that Eve and her team is working on strikes close to home for both Eve and Roarke. In their own way they each battle back their past to protect the young person at the center of the chaos. When Nixie Swisher’s life is turned upside down Eve does whatever it takes to protect this little girl and find the evil people who took her fami
When Nixie Swisher’s life is turned upside down Eve does whatever it takes to protect this little girl and find the evil people who took her family away from her.
If you know Eve you will understand what I mean.
She may not know how to talk to a little girl or even act around one but the moments she had with Nixie were perfect.
But my favorite in this one was Peabody.
There was a moment in this one where Peabody laid into Eve!!!
Galahad was very present in this one too!I know I sound like a broken record but I’m loving this series.
10++++++ stars!!!! Need I say more?

Rating above a 4.5,...as usual. ;)
There are a couple of scenes that I found too outrageous to be believed (the ending with Nixie), anyone allowing Dallas to take a kid to live with her and Roarke instead of having her in foster care, etc.
We actually in this book get to see how would Eve be with a child of her own (honest, probably to a fault, still loving, but not outwardly so) and we get to see how much Roarke desires to one day have children (yep plural) with Dallas.
Heck, if you don't think Roarke would not be a stay at home dad and or taking the kids to work with him, you have not read an "In Death" book before.
11/6/17 - Finished another reread of Survivor - another of my favorites!
Love, love, love this book and these characters!Original Review: Just pure raw emotion...heart-wrenching, heart-breaking, heart-touching.
Character/relationship development is superb as always - the characters carry this story to a higher level.
The plot development is brilliant per vintage JD Robb...she never lets me down.
Nothing else to say except this is a Must Read, not only for In Death series fans but also fans of suspense, murder mysteries, & dark, emotional gut-wrenching books that rip your heart out.
Oh, and yes, fans of love & hope & justice delved out by Lt. Eve Dallas.
So, this one hit me really hard, I had to stay up all night to know who the killer was and see that justice was served.In this book, we have an entire family slain as they sleep in their beds with only one survivor, a 9 y/o girl(view spoiler)[whose friend was mistaken for her while she went down to drink some soda (hide spoiler)] .
I was angry at the people that were supposed to look after her (view spoiler)[ Linnie's parents (hide spoiler)] but I understood and it made it much sadder.
Form her hiding place in the kitchen, Nixie witnesses intruders in her home who methodically and quickly murder her entire family including their housekeeper and her friend Lennie who was staying the night for a sleep over.Eve Dallas gets the call and quickly realizes that this was not a simple B and E.
And in that vein she lets it play out like a pure police procedural.Three major things I loved:1) Eve hides Nixie at her house and they all rally around the little girl.
In the end when Nixie meets the killer and looks him in the eye, the repeats her mantra again, this time with deep satisfaction.3) The scene at the morgue.
1st Read July 07-20 20132nd read 13-21 October 2015
Lt. Eve Dallas is called to the Swisher Residence.
The youngest child, Nixie Swisher, is an eyewitness.
And why will the killers do anything to get their hands on nine year old Nixie?
When Eve takes her only witness home with her, Child Protective Services are not happy.
But Eve knows the killers will find it nearly impossible to breach the security that Roarke has on their home.
The interaction between Eve, Roarke and Nixie was first-rate.
Eve and Roarke have no idea how to handle a nine year old girl, especially one that is grieving for her family.
Eve struggles with the young victim and her circumstances that hit a vulnerable spot for Eve and she turns to Roarke and the rest of her acquired family for support.
It's nice to see Eve and Roarke thinking about a child sometime in the future and Eve's reaction to Mavis's kicking tummy is hilarious.
Eve's horror when Nixie hero worships her and turns to her for answers shows just how skilled Robb/Roberts is in her characterizations.
The scene where Nixie says goodbye to her family was heart-wrenching and I have to say brought out a few tears.
This is an outstanding book! A horrific crime that leaves five members of a family slaughtered and a lone nine year old witness that just lost her entire family. A fast paced read that will keep you riveted until the shocking truth is revealed.
A good kick-a book. Great characters (some throw back and some new), some hi-ya moments, definitely some hold-your-breath parts, humor, some scariness (for E&R anyway :)), truly evil bad guys, woo-hoo parts, some good down time in the holoroom, some sweet and sad scenes, more holding-your-breath, and a great ending! Packed full to bursting and had me turning pages like a mad person. I was diggin' the dojo too. Don't see that part of Eve much and I liked it even if it was a small part. Can't wait to dig into the next! Enjoy!!!
My favourite ID book - love all the emotions in this one, some really good bantering, and the story line is just excellent!If anyone can have a dry eye while reading the part where Nixie is in the morgue, I don't understand you.The re-introduction of past characters bodes well with this book and leads one to wonder if they will surface again down the road.Love this book every time I read it.2 thumbs up, 5 stars!
En sevdiğim çiftime sürekli dönüyorum elimde değil. Bu seferki kitabı bir öncekine göre birazcık daha başarısız buldum ama bizim ikilinin 9 yaşındaki bir kız çocuğuyla çırpınmalarını görmek biraz komikti de :D Hele hele Roarke "I want children" diyip de Eve'in bunun çoğul olduğunu anladığı an iyi güldüm diyebilirim.
Just gets better every time! I haven't re-read Survivor for awhile. Sometimes with re-reads, there is some skim. Not here, not this time. There are so many good parts/ poignant scenes/ nuances that you pick up with each read. Gearing up for Echoes In Death...coming soon!!!
I really enjoyed this installation. The cases with an emotional connection to Eve's past and present are definitely the most addictive to read. This one had some lovely moments. One of my faves so far for the case solely.
I really can't seem to stop with this series. I just get a craving to spend more time with Eve and Roarke, so what is a girl to do??This one particularly broke my heart. Eve and Roarke are clearly not ready to have children of their own, but seeing them with a child who had gone through so much trauma was kind of important for them. I'm looking forward to see them grow into the idea, which I think will happen more once Mavis has her baby.
I was very impressed by this story.
It threw Eve way the heck out of her comfort zone, and forced her to take a good, hard look at motherhood.
It was interesting to see her reactions to it, even outside what she had experienced through Mavis.
What I loved most about this case was that it tied back to an earlier case in the series, specifically the story in Loyalty in Death.
This story tied up a loose thread or two from that one.
Quite the enjoyable way to spend a Sunday afternoon!
Valuables at the scene were left untouched, there was no sign of vandalism -- just the corpses of five people murdered in their sleep...In Survivor In Death we get some truly mysterious, cold-blooded and evil bad guys.
Dallas, Peabody & Co. have complicated task to uncoil the mystery behind the deaths and protect little Nixie from further harm.
It was amusing to see how someone so tough and gritty like Eve Dallas can be afraid of little kids.
"Why, so it is--nothing slips by my canny cop.""You really think if I ever actually let you plant something in me--they're like aliens in there, growing little hands and feet." She shuddered.
Adoro esta série 💜
Book #59 of 2011I've taken quite a break from the "In Death" series, so there were a couple of references that I'd forgotten about.
#20.) So that's not all that surprising.What I found interesting about this particular book was the introduction of a child into Eve and Roarke and Summerset's lives, even if only temporarily.
Roarke has made not secret of the fact that he wants children and Eve has made no secret of the fact that she's terrified by the thought.
its very clear that they are not ready for children.
And Nora Roberts has made it clear that a child would mean the end of the series.
Another great read (listen)! I wish there had been an epilogue to this one because I had some questions and felt it ended a little abruptly but the mystery and action in this one were great. I also loved that Eve's character stayed true and that she didn't start acting all maternal. The way she interacted with Nixie was spot on to who she is and hilarious at times.
